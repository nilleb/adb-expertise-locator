In  2003,  the  per  capita  gross \ndomestic  product  of  Gansu  was  only  55%  of  the  national \naverage.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  strategy by \nbuilding  an  important  section  of  the  national  trunk  highway \nsystem connecting the two growth centers of Lanzhou, the capital \nof Gansu province, and Xi\u2019an, the capital of Shaanxi province  by \n(i) constructing an expressway across hilly to mountainous terrain \n(where  the  poverty  incidence  is  high);  (ii) improving local roads \ntownships;  and  (iii) providing \nservicing  poor  counties  and \nconsulting services and training to enhance construction quality, \nroad safety, and project monitoring and evaluation. \n \nDespite  considerable  investment  in  the  road  sector  to  date,  the \nPRC  road  network  is  still  inadequate,  and  does  not  provide \nefficient  access  to  large  parts  of  the  country,  particularly  in  the \npoorer inland regions, including Gansu province. Better transport \nlinks  are  necessary  to  improve  economic  efficiency,  foster \ndomestic and international trade, facilitate interregional economic \nintegration,  and  facilitate  efficient  economic  growth,  thereby \nreducing  poverty.  Western  PRC \nroad \ninfrastructure.  The  road  network  must  therefore  be  developed, \nthus spreading economic and social benefits widely. To enhance \neconomic development and reduce poverty in the western region, \nthe  Government \nthe  Western  Region \nimplementing \nDevelopment Strategy, the key theme of the 10th Five-Year Plan  \n(2001\u20132005).  The  strategy  aims \nreduce  development \ndisparities between the western and coastal regions. The Project \nwill  support  this  strategy.  Gansu  provincial  government  (GPG) \nhas identified the Project as a priority investment, which  will also \ncomplement  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  developing  the  Lanzhou-Xi\u2019an-\nTaiyuan section of the national trunk highway system. \n \nThe  principal  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  promote economic \ngrowth  and  thus  reduce  poverty  in  eastern Gansu  province  by \nlowering  the  cost  of  transport,  relieving  traffic  congestion,  and \nimproving  access  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  aims  to \n\nlacks  high-class \n\nto \n\nis \n\n\fto  accommodate  growing \n\nimproving  access  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  aims  to \n(i) reduce \ntraffic  accidents  and  vehicle  operating  costs; \n(ii) improve  access  between  Lanzhou  and  Xi\u2019an,  two  major \ngrowth  centers  in  northwestern  PRC;  (iii) provide  additional \ntraffic;  and \ntransport  capacity \n(iv) provide  improved  access  to  markets  and  social  services  in \npoor  areas.  The  Project  will  also  support  reforms  relating  to \npoverty \nreduction,  corporate  governance,  private  sector \ndevelopment, and road safety and vehicle emissions. The Project \ncomprises  the  following  components:  (i) construction  of  a  231-\nkilometer  (km),  four-lane  access-controlled toll expressway from \nLuohandong to Dingxi, including access roads, interchanges with \ntoll stations, tunnels, bridges, administrative stations, and service \nareas;  (ii) the  upgrading  of  470 km  of  local  roads  to  improve \nto  remote  poor  areas,  and  of  roadside  stations; \naccess \n(iii) procurement  of  equipment \ntoll \ncollection,  surveillance  and  communications,  tunnel  operation \nfacilities,  vehicle  weigh  stations,  road  safety,  and  office \nadministration;  (iv) \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and \n(v) consulting  services  for  construction  supervision,  road  safety \naudit, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building. The key \ninputs  needed  to  implement  the  Project  include  civil  works, \nconsultants,  equipment,  and  staff  of  Gansu  Provincial \nCommunications Department (GPCD). \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies  and  interest  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$882 million  equivalent,  of  which  $394 million  (45%) is in foreign \nexchange and $488 million equivalent (55%) is in local currency. \n \n\nfor  road  maintenance, \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nMinistry of Communications  \nGansu Provincial Government  \nChina Development Bank  \n\nTotal \n% \n\nForeign \nExchange \n300.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n94.0 \n394.0 \n45 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\n0.0 \n195.3 \n123.3 \n169.4 \n488.0 \n55 \n\n ($ million) \nTotal \nCost \n300.0 \n195.3 \n123.3 \n263.4 \n882.0 \n\n   100 \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\nA $300 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility.

GPG  will  bear  the  interest  rate  variation  and  foreign \nexchange risks. \n \nUntil 30 June 2010 \n \n31 December 2009 \n \n \nThe project implementation unit established within  GPCD will be \nresponsible  for  the  expressway.  GPG  will  implement  the  local \nroad component through local government communications units. \n \nGansu Provincial Communications Department (GPCD) \n \nGoods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. Civil works \nfor  the  expressway  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive  bidding.  Civil  works  for  local  roads  will  be  procured \nthrough local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \nOn 15 July 2004, ADB approved advance action for procurement \nof  civil  works  for  the  expressway  and  local  roads.  ADB further \napproved  retroactive  financing  in  principle  in  an  amount  not \nexceeding  $5 million  equivalent  for  the  local roads.  Equipment \nwill be procured through international competitive bidding. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  61  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services  to  (i) help  with  project  management  during \nthe construction period; (ii) provide expertise in tunnel and bridge \nconstruction; (iii) conduct a safety audit of the project design, and \nmake  safety  recommendations  on  the  completed  construction \nworks; (iv) help set up and implement quality control procedures; \n(v) monitor  the  environmental  impact  of  the  Project  and  provide \nguidance  on  environmental  mitigation  measures  as  well  as  help \ndevelop  capacity  in  vehicle  emissions;  (vi) help  implement  the \ncorporate development  plan;  (vii) assist  in  formulating  a  human \nresource  development  and  training  program;  and  (viii) help \nestablish  and  implement  a  project  performance  management \nsystem,  including  assessing  the  impact  on  poverty  reduction. \nAbout  6,370  person-months of domestic consulting services will \nbe  required  for  construction  supervision.  The  international \nconsultants  will  be  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  and  will  be \nrecruited based on the quality- and cost-based selection method \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe  domestic  consultants  for  construction  supervision  will  be \nfinanced  by  GPCD  and  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with \ngovernment procedures. \n \nBy  developing  an  integrated  expressway  and  complementary \nlocal road network, the Project will help improve access to market \nopportunities  and  social  services  for  the  rural  poor  residents  in \n\n\f \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nopportunities  and  social  services  for  the  rural  poor  residents  in \nthe project area. The Project will reduce transport time and costs, \nthereby helping develop an enabling environment for  investment, \ncreate  employment  opportunities,  and  enhance  incomes.  The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n16.6%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  expressway \ncomponent  is  6.1%,  which  is  higher  than  the  real  weighted \naverage cost of capital. There are 1.6 million poor people, or 36% \nof the total population in the project area, living below the income \nlevels of CNY900 in rural areas and minimum living standards in \nurban  areas.  The  main  project  beneficiaries  of  the  local  road \ncomponent will be households in poor counties and townships in \nthe  project  area,  providers  of  rural  transport  services,  industrial \nand  agricultural  businesses,  agriculture-based  households \nproducing grains and vegetables for local markets, people living \nin the project area who will have easier access to long-distance \ntransport  services,  people  visiting  historical  sites  along  the \nexpressway,  and  transport  operators  and  their  customers  for \ntransit  traffic.  The  Project  will  also  help  reduce  traffic  accidents, \nvehicle emissions, and traffic noise on the existing roads. \n \nThe  Project  was  formulated  to  keep  to  a  minimum  the  potential \ntechnical, safety, economic, financial, and resettlement risks. The \nmain technical risks, which could result in implementation delays \nand  cost  overruns,  are  associated  with  the  tunnel  and  bridge \nstructures.  To  mitigate \ninternational  consultants \nthe  risks, \nreviewed \nthe  proposed  design  and  construction  methods. \nPrequalification  of  contractors  focuses  on  their  financial  and \nin  handling  complex  works.  During \ntechnical  capability \nconstruction,  monitoring  and  contract  management  information \nsystems will be set up and implemented, with the assistance of \nthe  international  consultants,  for  timely  identification  of  technical \nproblems and implementation of corrective measures. Given the \nsafety hazards associated with bridge works, the contractors will \nbe required to strictly enforce working safety rules and measures. \nGPCD  has  proven  experience  and  has  shown  satisfactory \nperformance in implementing internationally financed projects. \n \nEconomic performance in the project-influenced area would have \nto  deteriorate  substantially  for  the  Project  to  lose  economic \nviability.  The  financial  risks  associated  with  construction  and \noperation  of \nthe  actual \nthe  expressway  will  depend  on \nconstruction  costs,  ability  of  the  commercial  management,  and \nappropriate  tolls.  To  mitigate  the  financial  risks,  the  Gansu \nLuoding  Expressway  Company  will  build  up  a  commercial \nbusiness  environment  for  expressway  operations,  the  project \nexpressway  will  receive  substantial  equity  from  the  central  and \nprovincial  governments,  and  an  appropriate  toll  structure  will  be \nadopted.  Appropriate  coordination  and  monitoring  mechanisms \nwill be put in place to mitigate resettlement risks. \n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation (RRP) on a proposed \n\n \n1. \nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Gansu Roads Development Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe PRC\u2019s economic growth since the 1980s has substantially increased the demand for \ntransport services. The economy\u2019s changing structure and increasing diversification have altered \nthe  pattern  of  transport  demand.  The  demand  for  road  transport  has  outpaced  that  of  other \ntransport  modes.  There  is  a  rapidly  increasing  movement  of  goods  and  passengers  by  road, \nwhich is more flexible and responsive than other modes to the needs of a market economy.  The \nshift  in  transport  demand  also  reflects  the  loosening  of  anticompetitive  restrictions  in  the  road \ntransport industry itself. Between 1990 and 2003, road traffic grew by 9.6% per annum (p.a.) for \npassenger traffic, reaching 769.6 billion passenger\u2013kilometers (km); and by 5.7% p.a. for freight, \nreaching  708  billion  ton\u2013km.  In  2003,  road  traffic  accounted  for  55.7%  of  the  country\u2019s  total \npassenger traffic and 13.2% of  the total freight traffic. With the country\u2019s rapid economic growth, \nlow vehicle ownership rates, lower automobile prices after World Trade  Organization accession, \nincreasing access to loans to finance automobile purchases, and  large investment in automotive \nmanufacturing, the rapid expansion in the vehicle fleet will continue in the coming years. \n \n3. \nTo  meet  the  growing  demand  for  improved  transport  infrastructure  and  services,  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy for the road sector, as reflected in its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005), calls \nfor (i) accelerating the construction of the network of highways and national roads, with a focus on \nfive  north-south  and  seven  east-west  sections  of  the  national  trunk  highway  system;  (ii) starting \nconstruction  of  eight  new  highways  in  the  western  region  (total  18,000 km);  and  (iii) by  2005, \nhaving  approximately  1.95 million km  of  highways  open  to  traffic,  with  expressways1 accounting \nfor  35,000 km.  In  2003,  the  Government  announced  plans  for  5,300  rural  road  projects  with  a \ntotal length of 78,000 km. A total of 176,000 km of rural roads was slated for construction in the \nfollowing  3  years,  with  an  investment  of  CNY50  billion  provided  by  the  central  Government. \nCurrently,  184  towns  and  54,000  villages,  most  of  which  are  in  the  western  region,  have  no \naccess to roads. The plan is to develop a road network that will reach 99.8% of towns and 96.0% \nof villages by 2005. By the end of 2010, all towns and villages will be connected to roads. This \nmajor program will be a pro-poor initiative since in many surveys the poor ranked improved roads \nas  one  of  their  high  infrastructure  development  priorities.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to \nreducing poverty through transport infrastructure investment is reflected in the poverty partnership \nagreement  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  project  framework  summarizing  the  main \nfeatures of the proposed Project is in Appendix 1. \n \n4. \nThe  significant  road  sector  development  during  the  9th  Five-Year  Plan  (1996\u20132000) \nresulted in road investments totaling CNY924 billion, or CNY185 billion per year. The road sector \ninvestment grew at an average annual rate of 16% during this period. During the 10th Five-Year \nPlan, the total investment is expected to reach about CNY1,800 billion, almost double that in the \nprevious  5  years.  A  road  sector  analysis  is  given  in  Appendix 2.  In  Gansu  province,  Gansu \nProvincial Communications Department (GPCD) invested about CNY4.9 billion in the road sector \n\n                                                                 \n1  The People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC\u2019s) expressway length reached 29,745 km in 2003, the second longest in the \n\nworld after the United States. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nin  2003,  of  which  65%  was  allocated  to  construction  and  9%  to  maintenance.  During  the  10th \nFive-Year Plan, road investment is expected to be about CNY24 billion. GPCD plans to increase \nthe road investment to CNY44 billion during the 11th Five-Year Plan. Road sector revenues and \nexpenditures in Gansu province are given in Appendix 3. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nGansu province is  one  of  the  PRC\u2019s  five  northwestern  provinces.  Remote  and  isolated \nwith  harsh  natural  conditions,  it  is  one  of  the  least  developed  provinces.  The  key  problem  in \nGansu province is poverty: the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of the province  in 2003 \nwas  CNY4,984,  only  55%  of  the  national  average  of CNY9,057.  Per  capita  rural  income  was \nCNY1,673, or 64% of the national average of CNY2,622. There are 1.6 million poor people in the \nproject area, equivalent to 36% of the total population,  living below the income levels of CNY900 \nin  rural  areas  and  the  minimum  living  standards  in  urban  areas.  One  of  the  reasons  for  high \npoverty incidence is slow economic growth, partly because of inadequate infrastructure.  Despite \nthe considerable investments, the road network is still inadequate, and does not provide efficient \ntransport access to markets and social services, such as education and health.  \n \n6. \nThe impact of road investments on poverty reduction is supported by the results of studies \nand evaluations of several completed road projects financed by ADB2 and the World Bank.3 Well-\nintegrated road  development  helps  ensure  that  the  benefits  derived  from  the  expressway  filter \ndown to the poor. These results affirm the relevance of ADB\u2019s strategy in the road sector (paras. \n8\u20139).  A  technical  assistance  (TA)4 will help the Government  formulate  a  road  network  strategy \nthat promotes better integration of expressways and local roads to meet communities\u2019 needs and \nsupport economic growth, and that provides road agencies with cross-disciplinary skills and tools \nthrough  capacity  building.  A  case  study  in  Shaanxi  province  found  that  improved  roads  were \ncorrelated  with  poverty  reduction. 5  Benefits  for  rural  poor  areas  include  lower  transport  costs; \nlower cost of inputs; expanded agricultural support services; improved  farming practices; greater \naccess to employment opportunities in urban areas; and better access to health, education, and \nsocial services.6  \n \n7. \nTo help the Government develop its road sector strategy and investment projects, external \nassistance has been provided mainly from ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), \nand  World  Bank  (Appendix 4).  Since  1991,  ADB  has  provided  29  loans,  totaling  nearly  $5.3 \nbillion, to finance about 3,900 km of road development, together with 7,100 km of associated local \nroad networks. Since 1995, local roads have been included in the scope of road projects to make \n\n                                                                 \n2  In  Liaoning  and  Yunnan  provinces,  construction  of  expressways  complemented  by  upgrading  local  roads  was \nassociated with a significant increase in rural incomes in the project area.

Of the  ADB-financed  projects,  18  have \nbeen completed and are open to traffic. ADB  has also provided 50 TAs, totaling $26.9 million, to \nthe  road  sector.  The  advisory  TAs  have  addressed  poverty impact of road projects,  policy and \ninstitutional  issues,  including  highway  planning,  road  safety, 7  human  resources  development, \ntransport pricing, commercialization and corporatization, and the mobilization of private financial \nresources.  The  World  Bank  and  JBIC  have  provided  about  $6.1  billion  and  \u00a5111  billion \nrespectively to finance road investments.  ADB coordinates with the World Bank and JBIC. Each \nmajor  development  partner  focuses  on  different  corridors,  while  information  related  to  policy \nadvice is shared across the development community. \n \nC. \n \nTargeting Poor Beneficiaries. Since 1995, complementary  local road improvement has \n8. \nbeen  integrated  into  the  design  of  road  projects  to  improve  access  to  markets  and  social   \nservices.8 The integrated approach will help  target  the  poor  in  terms  of  bringing  them  benefits. \nBetter  integration  of  the  local  roads  into  the  trunk  highway  system  will  help  rural  agricultural \nproduce  reach  markets.  As  reliable  transport  to  markets  becomes  more  readily  available,  cash \ncrop farming in remote areas is stimulated and the access to off-farm employment opportunities is \nbroadened. \n \nFive  sections  of  the  local  roads  of  470 km  were  selected  as  part  of  the  broadly  defined \n9. \nProject,  on  the  basis  of  population  density,  poverty  incidence,  and  road  network  efficiency  from \nthe Gansu Provincial Rural Road Development Plan for 2001\u20132010. The Project will upgrade the \nroads from Class IV to III, costing about $53 million, of which $10 million from the ADB loan will \nhelp finance the two road sections: Guochengyi-Houjiachuan (118 km) and Dingxi-Longxi (80 km). \nThis will complement the expressway component in benefiting about 1.6 million poor people living \nin  the  project  area.  This  component  will  (i) be  implemented  concurrently  with  the  expressway \ncomponent  and  will  be  maintained  by  the  county  governments  under  the  guidance  of  GPCD, 9 \n(ii) use  the  Ministry  of  Communications  (MOC) technical  designs  and  standards,  (iii) follow the \nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB, and (iv) be monitored and evaluated to \nensure that their poverty impacts are enhanced.10 \n \nCorporate  Governance.  GPCD  currently  manages  expressway  construction  and \n10. \noperations. Based on ADB\u2019s experience in the road sector,11 separation of expressway operations \nfrom the government functions will promote corporate governance. GPCD has agreed to establish \na corporation, by 31 December 2007, tentatively called the Gansu Luoding Expressway Company \n(GLEC). GLEC will be responsible for operating and managing the project expressway. At least 1 \nyear  before  commencement  of  operations,  the  project  expressway  will  be  transferred  to  GLEC, \n\n                                                                 \n7  In January 2001, ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department completed a performance audit report on traffic safety TAs. \n\nThe two road safety TAs involving the PRC were rated highly successful. \n\n8  Since 1995, the scope of the 17 ADB-financed road projects has been expanded to enhance their impacts on poverty \nreduction by integrating local road improvements to improve the accessibility of poor communities. The local road \ncomponents of these projects are being implemented or have been completed successfully, helping improve living \nstandards  of the poor people in the project area. \n\n9  They have sufficient capacity and financing for maintenance works. The road maintenance expenditures in Gansu \n\nprovince were CNY479 million in 2003 and this is expected to increase in the next 5 years by 4\u20135% annually. \n\n10 While  improving  infrastructure  is  important,  competition  in  providing  road  transport  services  is  also  important  to \n\nensure that some of the savings in transport costs are passed onto local farmers through reduced tariff. \n\n11 ADB has been involved with road projects in 14 provinces since 1992, and corporatization has been implemented in \nmost of the provinces by separating expressway construction and operations from the provincial government. The \nexperience is generally positive in improving corporate governance. \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\nwhich  will  be  entitled  to  collect  and  retain  tolls  and  will  repay  the  proposed  loan  for  the \nexpressway.  Details  of  the  creation  of  GLEC  and  the  transfer  of  assets  and  debt  service \nobligations  from  GPCD  to  GLEC,  including  GLEC\u2019s  financial  statements  for  the  Project, will be \nsubmitted for ADB\u2019s  approval  6 months prior to  establishment of  GLEC.  GPCD  and  GLEC  will \nenter into a concession framework agreement (outlined in Appendix 5  with the full agreement in \nSupplementary  Appendix A) by 30 June 2008 to ensure autonomy of operations, encourage the \nestablishment  of  road  performance  indicators,  and  facilitate  future  refinancing  of  road  sector \nassets. GLEC will implement a corporate development plan (also outlined in Appendix 5 with the \nfull  plan  in  Supplementary  Appendix A)  by  31  December  2008  to  assure  high  standards  of \ncorporate  governance,  management  practices,  and  financial  reporting.  These  agreements  and \nplans  will  be  implemented  with  the  help  of  the  loan-financed  consultants  during  project \nimplementation.  The  model  documents  needed  for  such  process  were  developed  under  ADB- \nfinanced  TA12  and  are  available  from  a  web  site. 13 To help with the process of corporatization, \ntraining will be provided under the loan to the staff of GPCD and GLEC. \n \nPrivate Sector Development. In line with ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Strategy, 14 \n11. \nconsideration  was  given  to  various  approaches  to  highway  financing  recommended  under  an \nADB-financed  TA, 15  including  securitization. 16  The  potential  for  pursuing  these  options  for \nfinancing the project expressway were examined. Capacity to attract private financing, particularly \nequity capital, for road projects such as the project expressway with low initial demand and low \nfinancial returns, but with high long-term economic returns, is limited. Therefore, the construction \nof  the  Project  will  be  financed  from  public  sources .  Private  sector  financing  options  will  be \nexamined  before  operations  start.  ADB  will  favorably  consider  such  refinancing  for  the  Project, \nprovided  that  advance  notice  is  received  and  the  proposal  meets  ADB\u2019s  standards  of  good \ngovernance, transparency, and project viability. GPCD is pursuing private sector participation in \ndeveloping the road sector, and has offered three existing highways for lease concessions with a \ntotal length of 330 km, costing about CNY7.5 billion. An overview of private sector involvement in \nthe PRC road sector is given in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n12. \nRoad Safety and Vehicle Emissions. Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC, and in \nGansu province. In 2003, there were 667,507 accidents, involving 104,372 fatalities and 494,174 \ninjuries in the PRC. This is equivalent to a fatality rate of 43 deaths per 10,000 vehicles, which is \nvery  high  by  international  standards.17 Gansu  province had  13,403 accidents,  involving  1,837 \nfatalities and 7,833 injuries. The Ministry of Public Security, which is responsible for enforcement \nof  traffic  laws  and  regulations,  is  committed  to  reducing  accidents  through  improved  safety  of \nvehicles, driver training, and improved traffic management.  The road traffic safety law was made \neffective in May 2004. ADB maintains a dialogue with the Ministry, based on the findings of the  \n \n\n                                                                 \n12 ADB. 1997.

The  main  findings  of  the  TA  were  disseminated  to  the  public  through  The New Frontier\u2014Investing  in  Toll \nRoads,  published by  ADB  and  the  State  Development  Planning  Commission  (2003,  Manila).  The  TA  was  rated \nsuccessful in the TA completion report. \n\n13 Available: http://www.chineseinfrastructure.com . \n14 ADB. 2003.

Under the two projects, the expressways' future toll revenue was securitized through \nan initial public offering in August 1999 and January 1999, respectively. \n\n17 Comparative figures for other countries in deaths per 10,000 vehicles are 26.5 for India, 11.8 for Indonesia, 8.5 for \n\nThailand, 2.3 for Australia, and 1.9 for Japan. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\ncompleted  TA, 18  and  will  strengthen  its  involvement  through  a  planned  TA  for  improving  road \nsafety.  Also  in  May  2004,  an  interministerial  committee,  coordinated  by  MOC,  involving  seven \nministries,19 was established to develop and implement special measures to enforce regulations \nnationwide  on  overloaded  trucks.  In  Gansu  province,  this  program  is  being  implemented  by  an \ninterdepartmental task force under the governor. Road safety issues are being addressed through \n(i) setting  up  an  accident  prevention  division  in  the  Gansu  Public  Security  Bureau  to  analyze \naccident data to help draw up  prevention  measures;  (ii) strengthening  driver  training  and  police \npatrols  on  the  roads  to  enforce  traffic  laws  and  regulations;  and  (iii) promoting  a  road  safety \ncampaign,  including  the  use  of  seat  belts  and  infant  seats  and  warning  against  intoxicated  and \ndangerous driving, using pamphlets, posters, and other communications means. To address road \nsafety  issues,  the  Project  will  include  the  following  measures:  (i) vehicle  weighing  stations; \n(ii) road  safety  training  for  staff  of  GPCD;  (iii) safety  audit during design  and  construction; and \n(iv) public awareness campaigns  and signage, promoting  road  safety  and  accident  prevention. \nThese will be carried out with the assistance of a road safety specialist financed  under the loan \n(Appendix 6). \n \n13.  With  a  rapid  increase  in  vehicle  ownership,  vehicle  emissions  have  become  a  serious \nissue  in  the  PRC.  They  will  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  environment  if  mitigation  measures \nare  not  taken.  Fragmented  responsibility,  lack  of  interdepartmental  coordination,  and  an \ninadequate  database  and  monitoring  system  prevent  the  formulation  of  specific  targets  for  a \nreduction in vehicle emissions.  Gansu provincial government (GPG) has an annual program for \ntesting  vehicle  emissions.  Roadside  testing  is  also  carried  out  along  the  major  national  and \nprovincial  roads.  To  address  the  motor  vehicle  emissions  issue,  international  consultants  will \nprovide  training  to  staff  of  the  environmental  protection  bureau  involved  with  vehicle  emissions \ninspection  and  testing  in  light  of  the  findings  of  the  ADB-financed  TA 20  on  vehicle  emissions \n(Appendix 6). \n \nD.  \n \n14. \nGPCD has experience in preparing and implementing three internationally financed road \nprojects.21  These  projects  were  prepared  well  and  are  being  implemented  or  operated  without \nmajor  problems.  The  relevant  safeguard  policies  have  been  met.  Performance  reviews 22  of \ncompleted  ADB-financed  road  projects  elsewhere  in  the  PRC  indicate  that,  in  general,  the \nprojects  have  been  or  are  being  implemented  to  meet  development  objectives  of  facilitating \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  as  originally  envisaged  during  project  preparation. \nCompleted  projects  show  that  (i) ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  were  met;  (ii) loan covenants were \ngenerally complied with; (iii) poverty reduction impact is evident as people\u2019s living standards have \n                                                                 \n18 ADB. 1999.

The main findings of this TA, including training materials, are available in the road safety \nsection  of  ADB\u2019s  web  site,  available:  http://www.adb.org/Projects/PRCRoadSafety/introduction.asp.  The  TA  was \nrated highly successful in the TA completion report. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n19 These are Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Public Security, National Development and Reform Commission, \nNational Quality  Control  Bureau,  National  Safety  Bureau,  National  Industry  and  Commerce  Bureau,  and  State \nCouncil\u2019s Law and Regulations Office. \n\n20 ADB. 2000.

Project completion reports (PCRs) prepared for 10 \nroad  projects  concluded that  nine  of  them 24 were  highly or  generally  successful,  and  one 25 was \npartly successful. The project performance audit reports (PPARs) for four road projects26 rated the \nprojects  as  either  highly  successful  or  successful.  The  lessons  learned  from  previous  ADB-\nfinanced  road  projects  are  reflected  in  the  project  design.  A  development  impact  study27 of the \n1,867 km Beijing-Tongjiang expressway route, for which ADB provided loans totaling $1.2 billion, \nshowed  that  the  improved  road  network  significantly  contributed  to  the  development  of  the \nnortheastern  part  of  the  PRC.  Some  lessons  from  these  projects  have  been  brought  to  the \nattention  of  GPCD,  particularly  with  reference  to  implementation-related  matters.  To  avoid \ndelayed loan effectiveness due to delays in the procurement process, a tendering company  has \nbeen  recruited  to  prequalify  the  civil  works  contractors.  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines  and \nrequirements  were  discussed  extensively  during  missions.  Emphasis  was  put  on  the  need  to \n(i) strictly  follow  ADB\u2019s  mandatory  bidding  documents,  (ii) evaluate  bids  according  to  ADB-\napproved evaluation criteria, and (iii) substantiate clearly the conclusions of the bid evaluation.  \n \nE. \n \nADB's  operational  strategy 28  in  the  road  sector  supports  (i) construction  of  roads  that \n15. \nconnect major growth centers and promote linkages with hinterland economies; (ii) integration of \nthe network so that the national trunk highway system is supported by a system of local roads, \nparticularly  those  that  provide  access  to  poor  areas;  (iii) promotion  of  road  safety  and  vehicle \nemission  reduction;  (iv) institutional  strengthening  to  increase  the  commercial  orientation  and \nefficiency  of  expressway  organizations;  (v) improvement  of  highway  planning  and  evaluation \ntechniques; (vi) adoption of appropriate pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport \ncapacity;  and  (vii) use  of  alternative  methods  of  investment  financing,  including  private  sector \nparticipation.  ADB is targeting its assistance in the road sector to the less developed central and \nwestern provinces where the majority of the poor live. The proposed Project is consistent with the \nPRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s strategy. \n                                                                 \n23 ADB. 1998.

This  lower rating  is mainly  due  to \ninadequate  safety  facilities  and  enforcement,  as  well  as  partial  compliance  with  environmental  mitigation  measures. \nRemedial actions were subsequently taken by rectifying the infrastructure deficiencies, enforcing harsher penalties \nfor  traffic  violations,  and  implementing  the  environmental  mitigation  measures.

Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132007): the PRC. Manila. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nDespite  the  considerable  investments  in  the  road  sector,  the  PRC  road  network  is  still \n16. \ninadequate,  and  does  not  provide  efficient  transport  access  to  large  parts  of  the  country, \nparticularly in the poorer inland regions, including  Gansu province. Transport and logistics costs \nin the western region are high. Western PRC lacks high-class road infrastructure in and out of the \nregion, and between and within provinces in the region. The road network must be  developed to \nlower  transport  costs  and  facilitate  sustainable  economic  development.  The  Government  is \nimplementing  the Western  Region  Development  Strategy,  which  is  the  key  theme  of  the  10th \nFive-Year Plan. The strategy aims to reduce development disparities between the western region \nand  the  coastal  region.  The  Project  will  support  this  strategy,  and  will  connect  the  two  growth \ncenters of Lanzhou and Xi\u2019an. GPG  has identified the Project as a priority investment, which  will \nalso  complement  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  developing  the  Lanzhou-Xi\u2019an-Taiyuan  section  of  the \nnational trunk highway system.29 \n \n17. \nDuring the 2004 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \nfor ADB assistance for the Project.30 A feasibility study was completed by GPCD in May 2003. An \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was prepared in July  2004,  and  a  resettlement  plan  in \nSeptember 2004.  ADB provided TA31 to supplement the government studies.  A final TA tripartite \nmeeting-cum-loan fact finding for the Project was held from 21 June  to 2 July 2004. The Project \nwas  formulated  on  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  ADB  missions,  information  provided  by  the \nGovernment,  stakeholder  consultations,  discussions  with  other \nfunding  agencies,  and \nrecommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nObjectives \n\n \nA. \n \n18. \nThe  principal  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  promote  economic  growth  and  reduce \npoverty in  eastern Gansu province by lowering the cost of transport, relieving traffic congestion, \nand  improving  access  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  aims  to  (i) reduce  traffic  accidents  and \nvehicle  operating  costs,  (ii) improve  access  between  Lanzhou  and  Xi\u2019an,  two  major  growth \ncenters in northwestern PRC, (iii) provide additional transport capacity to accommodate growing \ntraffic, and (iv) provide improved access to markets and social services in poor areas. The Project \nwill  also  support  reforms  relating  to  poverty  reduction,  corporate  governance,  private  sector \ndevelopment, and road safety and vehicle emissions. \n \nB. \n \n19. \n \n\nThe Project has the following components: (i) construction of a 231 km, four-lane access- \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n                                                                 \n29 The  Lanzhou-Xi\u2019an-Taiyuan  section  is  a  priority  section  of  the  national  trunk  highway  system  for  ADB  assistance, \nwhich  includes  the  Shanxi  Road  Development  Project  (Qixian-Linfen),  approved  in  1999;  Shaanxi  Roads \nDevelopment Project (Yanliang-Yumenkou), approved in 2001; Shanxi Roads Development II Project (Yumenkou-\nHouma), approved in 2002; and Xi\u2019an Urban Transport Project, approved in 2003. These loans total $895 million. \n30 The  Project  has  been  processed  as  a  pilot  test  designated  by  the  Strategy  Working  Group  on  Infrastructure  and \nUtility Finance Initiative with the objective of achieving improved processing efficiency, greater responsiveness to the \nGovernment\u2019s  needs,  and  better  cost-effectiveness  while  ensuring  project  quality  and  safeguarding  policy \ncompliance. \n\n31 ADB. 2003.

The key inputs \nneeded to implement the Project include civil works, consultants, equipment, and staff of GPCD. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nRoadside  Stations.  Road  projects  have  traditionally  focused  on  expanding  transport \ncapacity  to  maximize  economic  impact.  To  contribute  to  achieving  the  Millennium  Development \nGoals through transport development, innovative approaches are needed to enhance multisector \nand  multipurpose  dimensions  of  infrastructure  investment.  The  Project  will  introduce  roadside \nstations33 to facilitate community development along the Project local roads by linking roads with \ncommunity  activities  and  to  provide  a  conducive  environment  for  safe  driving  for  road  users. \nRoadside stations normally provide parking areas and ancillary facilities, such as bus terminals, \ngasoline  stations,  information  centers  about  roads,  road  safety,  tourism,  and  HIV/AIDS,  local \nspecialty markets, restaurants, and agro-processing facilities. Details of facilities will be firmed up \nduring  project  implementation.  The  Project  will  develop  four  roadside  stations  along  the  project \nlocal roads. \n \n21. \nTransport  Services.  To  enhance  the  benefit  flow  to  local  communities  through \ninfrastructure improvement, efficient and safe transport services should be widely available in the \nproject  area.  Current  constraints  and  opportunities  were  reviewed  under  the  TA.  The  main \nfindings are provided in Appendix 7. One of the issues relates to the nonavailability of bus stops \non the expressways. As the interprovincial expressway system is developed, long-distance public \ntransport  services  are  becoming  available.  However,  bus  stops  are  unavailable  on  the \nexpressways primarily for safety reasons, given that expressways are access controlled. MOC\u2019s \nnew  highway  design  standards,  effective  1  March  2004,  provide  for  installing  bus  stops.  During \nproject  implementation,  GPCD  will  review  the  possibility  of  providing  bus  stops  on  the  project \nexpressway  in  consultation  with  bus  operators,  keeping  in  view  the  safety  issues. Other issues \ninclude  a  lack  of  competition  in  the  transport  services  market,  and  regulations  on  tariffs  and \nroutes  for  bus  and  trucking  services.  MOC  is  addressing  these  aspects  of  road  transport,  with \nassistance from a recently approved TA, 34 which aims to develop a road transport policy reform \naction  plan  by  reviewing  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  in  the  road  transport  industry  and \nfactors affecting efficiency and safety of the industry. \n                                                                 \n32 The project expressway is divided into two parts by the section in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which is not part \nof the Project for reasons of administrative jurisdiction. The eastern part of this section (37 km) is being implemented \nby an ADB-financed Ningxia Roads Development Project, approved in 2003, while the western part (30 km) will be \nconstructed  in  accordance  with  the  same  technical  standards  as  those  of  the  project  expressway  by  the  Ningxia \nCommunications Department during 2007\u20132009. \n\n33 The concept of roadside stations was developed in Japan to link the road users and communities, thereby facilitating \nlocal  economic  development.  They  are  different  from  ordinary  service  areas  provided  along  the  roads  because \n(i) they are designed through the involvement of local communities, (ii) they provide links between road users and \nlocal communities, (iii) they provide business opportunities for local people, and (iv) they can possibly provide public \nservices, including health care, education, and cultural activities in addition to the normal restaurant and commercial \nservices. This experience was replicated in Thailand with assistance from JBIC and is being pilot tested in the PRC \n(Anhui, Gansu, and Hunan provinces) as well as Kenya with assistance from the World Bank and JBIC.  Guidelines \nfor Roadside Stations have been prepared by the World Bank, and will be used by GPCD as a guide. \n\n34 ADB. 2004.

During the feasibility study, EIA and resettlement planning, \n22. \nconsultations  were  conducted  with  representatives  of  local  government  agencies,  civil  society, \nand affected people to discuss project alternatives, environmental concerns, land acquisition and \nresettlement issues, and economic development potential. The findings of the consultations are \navailable  in  Appendix 8.  During  TA  (footnote  31)  implementation,  about  6,700  people  were \ninterviewed in public opinion surveys, social assessments, and for resettlement planning, which \nhelped  raise  the  level  of  awareness  and  gain  local  support.  These  processes  enabled  local \nstakeholders to express their opinions and to make relevant suggestions for project design and \nimplementation.  Consultations  with  the  rural  poor,  women,  minority  population,  and  other \nvulnerable groups were carried out during the socioeconomic survey on project impact and during \nlocal road selection. The participatory activities are an ongoing process that will continue during \nproject implementation. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $882 million, with a foreign exchange cost of \n$394 million (45%) and a local currency cost of $488 million (55%) (Appendix 9). The total costs \ninclude  physical  contingencies,  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction. \n \n\nCost Estimates \n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n  \n\n1.

The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  The  Government  has  provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.

The  remaining  foreign  exchange  cost  will  be  financed  by  the  China \nDevelopment  Bank.  The  local  currency  cost  will  be  financed  by  MOC, GPG,  and  cofinancing \nthrough a loan from the China Development Bank, which has appraised the Project. This loan is \nrepayable  over  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  at  a  variable  lending  rate, \ncurrently 5.76% per annum. The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to GPG on the same \nfinancial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \n \nF. \n \n26. \nProject  Management.  GPCD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  GPG  will  implement  the  local  road  component  through  local \ngovernments. The project director will be responsible for overall project management, approval of \ncontracts, and payments. A project implementation unit, which has been established within GPCD, \nwill monitor and follow up implementation. The unit  is headed by a project manager responsible \nfor  physical  implementation  activities  on  a  day-to-day  basis  and  the  preparation  of  progress \nreports.  GPCD  has  sufficient  technical  capability  to  handle  the  Project  as  its  engineers  have \nexperience  in  implementing  internationally  financed  road  projects.  The  financial  management \nassessment  of  GPCD  shows  that  the  Project  will  have  in  place  an  adequate  financial \nmanagement  system .  The  financial  management  assessment  questionnaire  as  completed  is \navailable  in  Supplementary  Appendix C.  After  GLEC  is  established,  the  project  facilities  and \nGPCD\u2019s responsibilities for day-to-day operations for the Project will be transferred from GPCD to \nGLEC. Organization charts for GPCD and GLEC are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n27. \nwith preconstruction activities in early 2005 and completion in December 2009 (Appendix 10). \n \n28. \nProcurement.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance with the \nADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  civil  works  for  the  expressway  will  be  divided  into  16 \npackages to be procured through international competitive bidding. Four equipment packages will \nbe  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Under  government  financing,  the  traffic \nengineering facilities and the telecommunications, monitoring, and toll-collection facilities will be \nprocured  through  local  competitive  bidding.  Ancillary  buildings  and  facilities  will  be  procured \nthrough  domestic  financing  in  four  packages  through  local  competitive  bidding.  For  the  local \nroads component, 10 ADB-financed packages will be procured  through local competitive bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB (Appendix 11). International bidding will be handled by a tendering \ncompany that is well qualified to perform these tasks.  \n \n29. \nConsulting  Services. Construction supervision activities, involving  6,370 person-months \nof  consulting  services,  will  be  undertaken  by  domestic  consulting  teams  under  government \n\nPeriod  of  Implementation.  The Project will be implemented over about  5 years starting \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nfinancing,  headed  by  a  chief  supervision  engineer.  Besides construction supervision, domestic \nconsultants for a project performance management system, including the monitoring of the social \ndevelopment action plan, will be engaged. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  61  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  to  (i) help \n30. \nwith  project  management  during  the  construction  period;  (ii) provide  expertise  in  tunnel  and \nbridge  construction;  (iii) conduct  a  safety  audit  of  the  project  design,  and  make  safety \nrecommendations  on  the  completed  construction  works;  (iv) help  set  up  and  implement  quality \ncontrol procedures; (v) monitor the environmental impact of the project and provide guidance on \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  as  well  as  help  develop  capacity  in  vehicle  emissions; \n(vi) help implement the  corporate development plan; (vii) assist in formulating a human resource \ndevelopment and training program; and (viii) help establish and implement a project performance \nmanagement system. The team leader will be in the field during the construction period and will \nact  as  assistant  chief  supervision  engineer,  (i) helping  the  chief  supervision  engineer  certify \nvariation orders, contractor\u2019s monthly payments, and subcontracting documents; and (ii) helping \nestablish a contracts management system. All consultants to be financed under the ADB loan will \nbe selected and engaged based on the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  Outline terms of reference for consultants are \nin Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nAdvance  Action  and  Retroactive  Financing.  Given  the  high  priority  accorded  to  the \n31. \nProject and the need to commence works in  July 2005, ADB approved on 15 July 2004  advance \nprocurement  action  for  civil  works. 35  While  advance  action  for  the  expressway  covers  the \nprequalification  of  contractors,  bidding,  and  bid  evaluation, but will not include contract awards, \nadvance  action  for  local  roads  covers  up  to  contract  awards.  The  advance  action  is  being \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. ADB also approved retroactive \nfinancing in principle to cover expenditures incurred within 12 months prior to loan effectiveness \nand not earlier than 21 June 2004 on the civil works for the local road component in the amount \nnot exceeding $5 million. The Government has been advised that approval of the advance action \nand retroactive financing in principle does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n32. \nDisbursement Arrangeme nts. All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Since most payments will be made for \nlarge contracts well above $100,000, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to \nwithdraw the loan funds. If the government funds are used first for eligible expenditures, ADB's \nreimbursement  procedure  will  be  used.  Statement  of  expenditures  will  be  applied  to reimburse \neligible expenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $200,000 to expedite fund flows. \n \n33. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting. GPCD  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for the \nProject and related financial statements and will have them audited annually in accordance with \nindependent  auditors,  whose \nappropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied  by \nqualifications, experience, and  terms of reference  are acceptable to ADB.  GPCD  will submit to \nADB  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  related  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project \naccounts  and  financial  statements  and  an  auditor\u2019s  report  on  the  Project,  all  in  the  English \nlanguage.  A  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  statement  of  expenditures,  if  any,  will  be \nincluded as part of the auditor\u2019s report. During project implementation, GPCD will submit quarterly \n\n                                                                 \n35 Advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  were  reported  in  the  July  2004  Internet  edition  of  ADB  Business \n\nOpportunities. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nprogress  reports.  To  facilitate  project  postevaluation,  GPCD  will  furnish  to  ADB  a  completion \nreport within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n34. \nProject  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  To  demonstrate  the  development \neffectiveness  of  its  operation  and  to  be  accountable  for  its  performance  to  stakeholders,  ADB \nuses  the  project  performance  management  system,36  which  is  a  coherent  and  results-based \napproach to monitoring and evaluating implementation performance and development impact at \nvarious  stages  of  the  project  cycle.  For  this  purpose,  a  set  of  indicators  for  evaluating  project \nperformance in relation to the project goals, purposes, outputs, and conditions has been agreed \nwith GPCD. The indicators were selected on the basis of the  findings of an ADB-financed TA for \nSocioeconomic Impact of Road Projects, which confirmed the contribution of road investments to \neconomic growth and poverty reduction in the PRC as well as the validity of the geographic focus \nof the road portfolio on the  poorer western region.37 The results also showed that complementary \ninvestments in local roads strengthen the impact of expressway investments. These indicators will \nbe refined at the start of project implementation and  may include (i) economic development  and \npoverty indicators for the project area,  (ii) industrial and agricultural outputs,  (iii) transport costs \nand  time,  (iv) transport  services  and  transport  charges,  (v) accident  rates,  (vi) financial \nsustainability,  (vii) level of  social services,  including school enrollment and infant mortality,  and \n(viii) jobs  created  in  construction  and  maintenance.  Employment  impact  indicators  will  include \ninformation  about  unskilled  laborers,  poor  laborers,  and  women  laborers,  and  will  be  monitored \nthrough  an  annual  report.  At  the  beginning  of  project  implementation,  GPCD  will  establish  a \nbaseline  and  target  values  for  the  indicators.  The  indicators  will  be  measured  at  project \ncompletion and 3 years later, and will be compared with the baseline, and a report summarizing \nthe key findings will be submitted to ADB. A full-time staff member of GPCD will be designated to \nundertake monitoring and evaluation with the consultants. \n \n35. \nProject  Review. In 2007, GPCD and ADB will carry out a midterm review of the Project, \ncovering  all  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical,  environmental,  social,  poverty \nreduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact \non the performance of the Project and its continuing viability.  \n \n36. \nAnticorruption  Measures.  The  Government  has  made  significant  efforts  to  address \ncorruption in the road sector. To date, 15 government officials from 10 provincial communications \ndepartments 38  have  been  found  to  be  involved  in  corruption.  Information  related  to  these \ncorruption cases is in the public domain. There is no evidence that any of the reported corruption \nwas related to ADB-financed road projects. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy \nwas explained to central  and  local  government  officials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on \nfraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants to \nobserve  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  the  procurement  and  execution  of  ADB-financed \n\n                                                                 \n36 A review of the project performance management system was undertaken by the Operations Evaluation Department \nin  2003  and  its  findings  and  recommendations  are  available  in  ADB.  2003.  Special  Evaluation  Study  on  Project \nPerformance  Management  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  its  Projects  in  Development  Member  Countries. \nManila. Based on the findings of this report, a Project Performance Management Sys tem (PPMS) Action Plan was \nissued for implementation during 2004\u20132005. The PPMS comprises five components: project framework (Appendix \n1),  project  performance  report,  government  monitoring  and  evaluation,  project  completion  report,  and  project \nperformance audit report. \n\n37 An  ADB-assisted  TA  for  Developing  a  Poverty  Monitoring  System  at  County  Level  is  assisting  rural survey \norganizations  to  develop  a  county  poverty  monitoring  system  that  provides  timely,  relevant,  and  high-quality \ninformation useful for poverty-related analysis of ADB-financed transport projects. \n\n38 Namely, Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu,  Sichuan,  Xinjiang, and Yunnan. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\ncontracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. ADB's program for the PRC \nincludes  assistance  to  the  Government  that  will  improve  governance  and  provide  incentives  to \nreduce the incidence of corruption in the longer term. Based on the recommendations of the July \n2004  PRC  Country  Performance  Portfolio  Mission,  a  seminar  on  how  to  detect  fraud  and \ncorruption during procurement will be organized by ADB in 2005. \n \n37. \nBased on GPCD\u2019s experience in fighting corruption, the following actions have been taken \nto  prevent  corruption:  (i) officials  from  the  Discipline  and  Inspection  Bureau  will  be  resident  in \nproject  offices  for  bidding,  construction,  and  operations;  (ii) an  internal  audit  unit  will  be \nestablished in the Project Company; (iii) a two-contract system has been established where the \nwinner  of  a  civil  works  contract  must  also  sign  an  anticorruption  contract  with  the  employer; \n(iv) liaison  meetings  between  GPCD  and  the  Prosecutor's  Office  are  held  on  a  regular  basis \nwhere  warnings  about  or  information  on  corrupt  practices  can  be  discussed;  and  (v) periodic \ninspections of contractors have been instituted to ensure procedures related to fund withdrawals \nand settlements are being followed. \n \nCapacity  Building.  To  cope  with  its  increased  road  construction  and  management \n38. \nactivities,  GPCD needs to develop  its capacity to manage sector development and expressway \noperations effectively and efficiently.  A human resource development plan will be drawn up with \nthe  help  of  the  international  consultants.  The  plan  will  consider  the  needs,  and  the  recruitment \nIt  will  cover  expressway  operations,  commercial \nand \ndevelopment  of  expressways  and  business  planning,  expressway  maintenance,  road  safety, \nvehicle  emissions,  project  management,  highway  development  planning,  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  environmental  management,  bridge  and  tunnel  design,  traffic  engineering,  toll \nmanagement,  and  pavement  design.  In  addition,  GPCD  staff  will  undertake  about  34  person-\nmonths  of  international  training.  With  the  assistance  of  the  international  consultants,  GPCD will \nprepare a program of training activities, including the location and a list of  participants. Findings \nfrom the training will be disseminated in Gansu province through an appropriate institute. \n \n\ntraining  requirements \n\nidentified. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n \nA. \n \n39. \nThe traffic volume on the existing roads in the project area has been increasing at about \n9% per annum in the last  5 years, reaching about 3,300 vehicles per day in 2002. The roads are \nalready  at  capacity  in  certain  sections.  If  the  new  road  is  not  constructed,  traffic  growth  will be \nsuppressed  and  transport  costs  will  increase.  The  congested  traffic  movements  will  slow  the \neconomic growth of the  project area. Based on the  findings of the TA (footnote 31), the forecast \ntraffic  volume  on  the  expressway  is  expected  to  grow  from  7,600  passenger  car  units  (pcu) in \n2010 to 15,100 pcu in 2020, a 7.1% average annual growth rate.  It will then grow more slowly at \n6.0% per annum thereafter to reach 25,600 pcu in 2029 (Appendix 12). \n \nB. \n \nTo  meet  the  growing  transport  demand  in  the  project  area,  possible  alternatives  were \n40. \nconsidered  as  part  of  the  national  and  provincial  transport  network  plan.  Alternative  analysis \nreviewed  various  options  in  terms  of  transport  modes,  alignments,  technical  designs,  timing  of \ninvestments,  and  financing  modalities.  The  conclusion  was  to  improve  road  transport  by \nconstructing  an  expressway  supported  by  a  complementary  local  road  improvement.  The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and without-project \nsituations.  Without  the  Project,  the  traffic  volume  would  exceed  the  optimum  capacity  of  the \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nexisting National Highway  312, which would become congested, thereby increasing travel time, \nvehicle operating costs (VOCs), and the number of accidents. With the Project, travel time will be \nreduced because of higher speeds and shorter distance; VOCs will be reduced because of faster \nand  smoother  travel  on  the  expressway;  and  the  accident  rate  will  be  reduced  through  the \nelimination  of  congestion,  provision  of  safety  features,  and  separation  of  fast-  and  slow-moving \ntraffic.  Similar  benefits  also  accrue  to  the  traffic  on  the  existing  road.  If  local  roads  are  not \nupgraded,  people  in  the  remote  parts  of  the  project  area  will  have  less  mobility  and  the  mainly \npoor  inhabitants  will  not  be  able  to  participate  in  the  mainstream  of  economic  activities.  The \neconomic costs of the expressway reflect the resource costs for construction, O&M, and the value \nof  agricultural  production  from  land  lost  permanently.  The  economic  benefits  generated  by  the \nexpressway include (i) savings in VOCs as a result of reduced road length and improved traffic \nconditions, (ii) time savings for road users, (iii) savings from avoided physical damage as a result \nof fewer accidents, and (iv) benefits from generated traffic. \n \n41. \nThe EIRR for the Project is estimated at 16.6%, indicating that the Project is economically \nviable  (Appendix 13).  Results  of  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  Project's \neconomic  viability.  Changes  in  the  key  variables,  such  as  a  10%  reduction  in  benefits, do not \nsignificantly  impact  on  the  economic  viability.  The  capital  cost  would  have  to  increase  by  68% \nfrom the estimate for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. The benefit level would have to \ndecrease by  38%  to  achieve  the  same  effect.  In  light  of  previous  experience  in  the  PRC  road \nsector,  variations  of  such  magnitude  are  unlikely.  The  EIRR  was  also  calculated  separately  for \nthe  expressway  and  for  local  roads.  The  EIRR  was  16.1%  for  the  expressway  component  and \n25.7%  for  the  local  road  component.  The  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  extended  to \nanalyze  the  distribution  of  project  net  benefits  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  various \nbeneficiaries,  including  road  users,  the  local  economy,  labor,  and  government. Road users will \nreceive  the  largest  share  of  net  benefits,  accounting  for  79%  of  the  total  net  benefits \n(Appendix 13). \n \nC. \n \n42. \nThe proposed toll rates for the expressway are considered reasonable to attract sufficient \ntraffic to meet economic and financial rate of return criteria.  GPCD will undertake a toll analysis \nbefore opening the expressway, and each year for 5 years thereafter, to confirm the appropriate \nlevel of toll, and it will submit the results for ADB\u2019s concurrence. If an adjustment of the toll levels \nis  required  based  on  this  principle,  GPCD  will  submit  its  toll  adjustment  plans  for  ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence before finalizing and submitting it to GPG for approval. \n \n43. \nFinancial projections have been prepared for GLEC in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \nfor  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB  to \nassess  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  Project  (Appendix 14).  The  projected \nfinancial statements indicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to cover O&M costs, income \ntaxes, and debt service. The financial evaluation of the expressway was undertaken in real terms \nusing  constant  2004  prices.  Incremental  costs  and  revenues  were  derived  by  evaluating  the \nfinancial  position  of  the  GLEC  under  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  An  FIRR  for  the \nexpressway, computed on an after-tax basis, is 6.1%. This compares favorably with the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 2.9%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR for the expressway is \nrobust  under  adverse  conditions.  Based  on  the  financial  projections  and  financial  evaluation  of \nthe  expressway  component,  the  Project  is  considered  financially  viable  and  sustainable \n(Appendix 14). \n \n\nFinancial Analysis and Projections \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\nD. \n \n44. \nCauses  of  poverty  in  the  project  area  include  degraded  land  and  a  lack  of  water \nresources, 39  weaknesses  in  the  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector,  and  poor \ninfrastructure  and  access.  The  last  point  is  true  especially  in  the  rural  areas  due  to  poor  and \nseasonally accessible roads, preventing timely delivery of goods and services, and discouraging \ncash crop production, off-farm work, and labor migration, some of the main factors needed to lift \nthe  poor  out  of  poverty.  In  urban  areas,  the  main  causes  of  poverty  are  lack  of  employment \nopportunities. The project area consists of areas with the potential to develop cash crops, tourism, \nand  mining  industries.  There  are  4.4 million  people  living  in  the  project  area:  3.9 million in the \nrural  area  and  0.5 million  in  the  urban  area.  Of  these,  1.6 million  (36%)  are  poor,  living  on \nincomes  below  CNY900  in  rural  areas  and  the  minimum  living  standards 40  in  urban  areas.  A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 15 and a full poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n45. \nThe Project design includes several measures to maximize its poverty reduction. The poor \nwill use the Project local roads to sell their produce to others who will use the roads to transport \nthe goods to markets.  Agricultural  inputs  will  be  transported  via  the  expressway  and  improved \nlocal roads more efficiently and cheaply to rural areas. There are many complementary poverty \nreduction  activities  funded  by  government  agencies.  In  addition  to  the  time  and  transport  cost \nsavings,  these  initiatives  will  improve  the  rural  poor  farmers\u2019  terms  of  trade  and  reduce  income \npoverty.  The  expressway  and  local  roads  will  facilitate  the  access  of  the  poor  to  off-farm \nemployment  opportunities.  The  Project  will  create  about  7,000  jobs  annually  during  project \nimplementation and about 490 jobs during operations.  The nonincome dimension of poverty will \nbe  reduced  with  better  access  to  health  and  education.  The  Project  will  encourage  civil  works \ncontractors and service operators to employ the poor. \n \nThe incidence of HIV/AIDS in Gansu is low41 relative to other provinces. To help address \n46. \nthe  issue  nationwide,  the  Action  Plan  to  Contain,  Prevent  and  Control  HIV/AIDS  is  being \nimplemented  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  with  support  from  the  United  Nations. 42  This  plan \narticulates  specific  actions  focusing  on  blood  safety,  care,  and  raising  public  awareness.  In  the \ncontext of the proposed Project,  improved  transport  and  greater  population  mobility  due  to  the \nProject might lead to a short-term increase in the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Project might facilitate \nthe  migration  of  poor  and  seasonal  workers  to  other  provinces,  whose  high-risk behavior could \nspread  HIV/AIDS.  To  address  this  issue,  an  awareness-building  campaign  and  prevention \nmeasures  are  important,  and  some  measures  are  being  taken  by  the  Gansu  Provincial  Health \nDepartment.  Consultations  with  nongovernment  organizations,  health  institutes,  and  transport \noperators during project preparation revealed that, while HIV/AIDS incidence is low in the project \narea, dissemination of HIV/AIDS information during construction is important and will be included \n\n                                                                 \n39 Gansu  is  one  of  the  six  western  provinces  eligible  for  assistance  under  the  ADB  formulated  PRC/GEF Strategic \n\nPartnership on Land Degradation. \n\n40  Minimum  living  standard  for  urban  areas  as  measured  by  the  annual  per  capita  urban  income  is  in  a  range  of \n\nCNY1,248 in Huining to CNY1,404 in Kongtong. \n\n41 The HIV positive rate among injecting drug users in Gansu province was 5% compared with 18% in Guangxi Zhuang \nAutonomous Region in 2001 (Source: United Nations AIDS. 2002.  HIV/AIDS: China\u2019s Titanic Peril\u20142001 Update of \nthe  AIDS  Situation  and  Needs  Assessment  Report.  Beijing:  United  Nations  Theme  Group  on  HIV/AIDS in China, \nBeijing). \n\n42 The PRC is a signatory to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS, and its assistance is \n\nbeing provided through the United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the PRC. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\nin the civil works contract documents. The Epidemic and Disease Control Center in Lanzhou, with \nbranch offices in county hospitals, has the capacity to implement and monitor the programs.43 \n \n47. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  indigenous  people  category  B.  The  only  potential  adverse \nimpact on ethnic minorities relates to  land  acquisition and resettlement. Since  the  Hui (Muslim \nminority) are integrated in the current social system, the compensation and rehabilitation adopted \nfor affected Hui people will be the same as those for Han people. To respect their customs and \nmaintain  their  social  relationships,  all  affected  minority  people  will  be  resettled  within  the  same \nvillages and village groups.  Assistance will be provided to affected Hui villages to improve their \nmosques and other social infrastructure. Any vulnerable households, including ethnic minorities, \nwill receive special assistance for relocation and will have priority  for  job training. GPCD agreed \nto  implement  a  Social  Development  Action  Plan  (SDAP)  to  enhance  the  project  benefits  to  the \npoor and ethnic minorities along the alignment and the broader project area, such as promotion of \ngender equity and prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking (Supplementary Appendix G).  \n \nE. \n \n48. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  A.   An  EIA  for  the  expressway  was \nprepared by GPCD, and an initial environmental examination for the local roads was prepared by \nthe TA consultants. A summary EIA for the Project was prepared and circulated to the Board, and \nmade  public  through  ADB\u2019s  web  site  on  30  July  2004,  based  on  the  EIA  and  the  initial \nenvironmental  examination.  To  ensure  that  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  project \ndesign,  construction,  and  operation  are  mitigated,  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP), \ncontaining  monitoring  program,  mitigation  measures,  and  acquisition  of  necessary  permits,  as \nspecified in the EIA, will be implemented. Permits for individual construction work will be obtained \nprior  to  the  works.  The  project  highway  will  pass  through  the  experimental  zone  of  Kongtong \nMountain  Provincial  Nature  Reserve,  where  multiple  land  uses  are  allowed.  Environmental \nimpacts  on  the  reserve  areas  will  be  minimized  by  implementing  the  EMP.  Environmental \nmitigation measures will be incorporated in the civil works contracts. \n \nF. \n \nThe  project  expressway  will  affect  23  townships,  93  administrative  villages,  and  374 \n49. \nvillage  groups  in  five  counties\u2014Jingchuan,  Kongtong,  and  Jingning  counties  in  Pingliang  city, \nHuining county in Baiyin city, and Anding district in Dingxi city. Based on preliminary design data, \n1,150  ha  of  land  will  be  acquired,  63%  of  which  is  farmland.  The  remaining  land  is  forestland, \nhousing plots, and wasteland. Approximately 100 ha of land will be occupied temporarily during \nthe construction phase. The farmland acquisition involves 4,285 persons losing all their farmland. \nInvestigations and past experience in Gansu reveal that  each affected household loses one third \nof  their  farmland.  Consequently,  land  acquisition  is  estimated  to  affect  2,840  households  with \n13,150  persons.  About  55,612  square  meters  of  houses  will  be  demolished,  necessitating \nrelocation  of  520  households  with  2,350  persons.  All  displaced  households  can  be  relocated  a \nshort distance to another site within their original village. During route selection, adjustments were \nmade  to  minimize  impacts  on  farmland  and  housing.  Consequently,  the  adverse  impact of the \nProject is relatively small and localized. Once the design for each of the road has been finished, \nGPCD will send ADB an updated resettlement plan.  \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n                                                                 \n43 An ongoing Technical Assistance for Preventing HIV/AIDS on Road Projects in Yunnan Province will provide a guide \n\nin addressing the HIV/AIDS issues for the Project. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nRisks \n\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  involuntary  resettlement  category  A.  ADB  has  reviewed  the \n50. \ndraft  resettlement  plan  (see  Appendix 16  for  a  summary  and  a  full  resettlement  plan  in \nSupplementary Appendix H) and has discussed it with GPCD, other government agencies, village \nleaders, and affected people. The draft resettlement plan was endorsed by GPCD and circulated \nto  the  affected  city  and  county  and  district  officials  for  their  feedback.  GPCD  distributed \nresettlement information booklets to affected townships, villages, village groups and households \nto  be  relocated,  on  12  August  2004.  The  resettlement  information  booklets  describe  the \nresettlement  impact,  resettlement  policy,  compensation  rates  and  policies,  organizational \narrangements,  rehabilitation  options,  consultation  and  participation  process,  and  grievance \nprocedures. The resettlement plan was uploaded on the ADB web site on 6 October 2004. \n \nG. \n \n51. \nThe Project was formulated to reduce potential technical, economic, financial, and social \nrisks. The main technical risks are associated with the tunnel and bridge structures. To mitigate \nthe  risks,  international  consultants  reviewed  the  proposed  design  and  construction  methods. \nPrequalification  of  contractors  focus es  on  their  financial  and  technical  capability  in  handling \ncomplex  works.  During  construction,  monitoring  and  contract  management  information  systems \nwill  be  set  up  and  implemented,  with  the  assistance  of  the  international  consultants, for timely \nidentification  of  technical  problems  and  implementation  of  corrective  measures.  GPCD  has \nproven  experience  and  has  shown  satisfactory  performance  in  implementing  internationally \nfinanced projects. Economic performance in the project-influenced area would have to deteriorate \nsubstantially  for  the  Project  to  lose  its  economic  viability.  The  financial  risks  associated  with \nconstruction and operation of the expressway will depend on the actual level and composition of \ntraffic,  construction  costs,  ability  of  the  commercial  management,  and  appropriate  tolls.  To \nmitigate  the  financial  risks,  GLEC  will  build  up  a  commercial  business  environment  for \nexpressway  operations,  the  project  expressway  will  receive  substantial  equity  from  the \ngovernment,  and  an  appropriate  toll  structure  will  be  adopted.  For  a  project  that  generates \nrevenue in domestic currency, a risk is related to exchange rate changes, and is partly accounted \nfor in the base case calculations.  An adverse exchange rate change of 30% would have only a \nsmall effect on the financial return. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, GPG, and GPCD have given the \n\n \n52. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n53. \nConstruction  Quality.  GPCD  will  ensure  that  the  Project  is  constructed  in  accordance \nwith  2004  technical  standards  of  MOC  for  highway  engineering.  The  international  consultant \ndesignated  as  the  team  leader  and  assistant  chief  supervision  engineer  will  review  and certify \nvariation orders and contractors\u2019 monthly payments, before  submission to  the chief supervision \nengineer. \n \n54. \nRoad Safety. Prior to project construction and operations, GPCD will carry out road safety \naudits,  the  recommendations  of  which  will  be  implemented  prior  to  project  construction  and \noperations.  For  the  project  expressway,  GPCD  will  implement  the  road  safety  signage, \ncommunication, hazard barriers, traffic monitoring, and vehicle weighing in accordance with MOC \nregulations and other regulations and standards; and will cooperate closely with the Gansu Public \nSecurity  Bureau  to  implement  necessary  road  safety  measures.  Before  opening  of  the  project \nexpressway, GPCD in consultation with the Gansu Public Security Bureau will submit a report on \nthe emergency response plan to ADB for review.  \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nto  ensure  autonomy  of  operations,  encourage \n\nRoadside Stations and Transport Services. Prior to completion of the local roads under \n55. \nthe  Project,  GPCD  will  establish  four  roadside  stations  to  facilitate  community  development  by \nlinking such roads with community activities. Facilities to be provided at the roadside stations may \ninclude  parking  areas;  bus  terminals;  gasoline  stations;  information  centers  about  roads,  road \nsafety, tourism and HIV/AIDS; local specialty markets; restaurants; and agro-processing facilities. \nThese  will  be  reviewed  by  GPCD  by  the  time  of  the  midterm  review.  GPCD  will  also  review  by \nthen the possibility of providing bus stops along the project expressway, in consultation with bus \noperators, with due regard for safety. \n \n56. \nCorporatization.  By  31  December  2007,  GPCD  will  establish  a  company,  tentatively \ncalled the  Gansu Luoding Expressway Company (GLEC), to operate and manage the proposed \nproject  expressway.  At  least  1  year  before  start  of  operations,  the  project  expressway  will  be \ntransferred  to  GLEC.  Details  on  the  creation  of  GLEC  and  transfer  of  assets  and  debt  service \nobligations  from  GPCD  to  GLEC,  including  GLEC\u2019s  financial  statements  for  the  Project,  will  be \nsubmitted for ADB approval 6 months prior to the establishment of GLEC. GLEC will implement a \ncorporate  development  plan  by  31  December  2008  to  assure  high  standards  of  corporate \ngovernance,  management  practices,  and  financial  reporting.  The  concept  of  an  interprovincial \nexpressway corporation will be reviewed by GPCD prior to project completion. \n \nPrivate  Sector  Development.  By  30  June  2008,  GPCD  will  enter  into  a  concession \n57. \nthe \nframework  agreement  with  GLEC \nestablishment  of  road  performance  indicators,  and  facilitate  future  refinancing  of  road  sector \nassets. Six months before the opening of the project facilities, GPCD will analyze the feasibility of \nattracting  private  sector  investment  funds  for  future  road  sector  investment,  including  private \nsector participation in O&M of the project expressway, and report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n58. \nTolls. In determining toll level, GPG will take into consideration levels sufficient to satisfy \nGLEC\u2019s  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  a  minimum  of  1.2. Six months before the expressway is \nopened,  GPCD  will  seek  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  on  the  proposed  toll  structure  and  levels  prior  to \nseeking GPG approval. For the first 5 years of operation, GPCD will review the toll structure and \nlevels  annually,  and  submit  a  report  to  ADB.  GPCD  will  seek  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  on  toll  level \nadjustment before seeking GPG approval. \n \n59. \nFinancial  Ratios. To ensure financial sustainability, GPCD will cause  GLEC to maintain \n(i) a debt-to-equity ratio of not more than 65:35 from the third year of operation; (ii) a working ratio \n(annual O&M cost, but excluding periodic maintenance cost, to revenue) of not more than 15%; \nand (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.2 from the third year of operation. \n \n60. \nHuman  Resource  Development  and  Training.  GPCD  will  prepare  a  human  resource \ndevelopment plan. Before undertaking international training, GPCD will prepare, among others for \nADB\u2019s concurrence, a training plan, a program of workshops to be delivered at GPCD by those \ntrained internationally, and a list of training equipment and aids to strengthen GPCD\u2019s domestic \ntraining programs.  \n \nEnvironment. GPCD will ensure that the Project is designed, constructed, and operated \n61. \nin  accordance  with  government  rules  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002). \nGPCD  will  implement  the  EMP  set  out  in  the  EIA  and  summary  EIA  to  mitigate  any  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  arising  from  the  Project;  mitigation  measures  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nbidding  documents  and  civil  works  contracts.  GPG  will  re-demarcate  the  boundary  of  nature \nreserve appropriately in accordance with government regulations and procedures.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19 \n\nVehicle Emissions. GPG will (i) provide to ADB the national emission standards and the \n62. \npenalties for infringement of such standards, and (ii) ensure that Gansu Environmental Protection \nBureau (GEPB), Gansu Public Security Bureau, and other relevant agencies enforce the national \nvehicle  emission  standards,  and  fulfill  requirements  of  the  government  strategies,  at  least  6 \nmonths prior to the opening of the expressway. \n \n63. \nLand  Acquisition  and  Resettlement. GPG and GPCD  will ensure that  land acquisition \nand  resettlement are  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently  following  the  resettlement plan agreed \nwith  ADB,  in  line  with  the  Land  Administration  Law  and  ADB's  Policies  on  Involuntary \nResettlement  (1995)  and  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  GPG  and  GPCD  will  ensure  that \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan  is  monitored  and  evaluated  and  reported  to  ADB  as \nrequired in the plan. \n \n64. \nEthnic Minorities. GPCD will implement the SDAP to ensure that ethnic minorities benefit \nfrom  the  Project  in  at  least  an  equitable  manner  and  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998),  and  that  implementation  of  the  SDAP  will  be  monitored  and \nevaluated by an independent agency. \n \n65. \nPoverty Reduction. The Government will cause GPG to implement the SDAP in a timely \nmanner. GPCD will cause the contractors to maximize the employment of local poor people who \nmeet the job and efficiency requirements for construction of the project roads. Such workers will \nbe provided with on-the-job training. The Government will cause GPG to extend the coverage and \nquality  of  public  utilities,  basic  health,  and  basic  education  in  the  project  area  to  enhance  the \nProject\u2019s  poverty  reduction  impacts.  The  Poverty  Alleviation  Office,  in  consultation  with  GPCD, \nwill monitor the impacts on poverty with the assistance of a designated local institute based on a \nset of indicators as outlined in the SDAP, and will submit annual monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n66. \nLabor  Standards.  GPCD  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable  labor  legislation.  Bidding  documents  will  include  a  clause  on  the  prohibition  of  child \nlabor for construction and maintenance activities, as well as a clause ensuring equal pay for men \nand women for work of equal value. \n \nGender and Development. GPCD will follow ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n67. \n(1998) during project implementation, and will take all necessary actions to encourage women to \nparticipate  in  planning  and  implementing  the  Project.  GPCD  will  monitor  the  effects  on  women \nduring  project  implementation  through  gender-disaggregated  data  where  relevant  in  the \nresettlement plan and the monitoring and evaluation system. \n \n68. \nHealth  Risks.  The  Department  of  Health  and  GPCD,  together  with  the  appropriate \nauthorities, will ensure that contractors disseminate information on the risks of HIV/AIDS to those \nemployed during project implementation. The Department of Health and GPCD will also ensure \nthat similar information is disseminated to transport operators and local communities living in the \nproject area during project operation, at roadside stations and other suitable facilities. \n \nAxle  Loads. GPCD will install vehicle axle-weighing equipment at selected entry points. \n69. \nBefore  opening  the  project  expressway,  GPCD  will  submit  to  ADB  the  plan  for  operation  of  the \nvehicle weigh stations, including the prescribed axle-load limits and penalties for infringement. \n \nChange  in  Ownership.  If  (i) any  change  in  ownership  of  the  project  facilities,  or  (ii) any \n70. \nsale,  transfer,  or  assignment  of  GPCD\u2019s  interest  in  the  project  expressway  is  anticipated,  the \nGovernment, GPG, and GPCD will consult ADB at least 6 months before the change.  \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nCoordination  Arrangement. The Government will ensure that (i) prior to the opening of \n71. \nthe project expressway, Ningxia government  will  construct the section of the expressway in the \nregion, linking the two parts of  the project expressway in Gansu, to maximize the benefits of the \nproject  expressway,  and  (ii) such  section  is  constructed  in  accordance  with  the  same  technical \nstandards as those of the project expressway. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n72. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the  Gansu Roads Development Project from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17 November 2004 \n\n  Tadao Chino \n     President \n\n \n \n      \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n21\n\nMonitoring Mechanism \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance \nIndicators/Targets \n\n \nGross domestic product \n(GDP) is forecast to increase \nduring 2009\u20132020 at 4.5% to \n5.4% per annum for Gansu \nprovince and 6.6% to 7.4% for \nthe project area.  \n \nPer capita rural income will \nincrease from CNY1,673 in \n2003 to CNY3,000 in 2013. \n \nThe poverty incidence in the \nproject area will be reduced \nfrom 36% in 2003 to 15% in \n2013.  \n \nSocial indicators, including \nschool enrollment and infant \nmortality rates, will improve. \n \nTraffic volume for the \nexpressway increased from \n7,600 passenger car units \n(pcu) in 2010 to 15,100 pcu in \n2020 and 25,600 pcu in 2029. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nGDP and other related data \nthrough periodic reporting by \nthe statistics office at the \nprovincial and county levels. \n \n \n \nProject performance \nmanagement system \n(PPMS) at inception, \ncompletion, and 3 years \nthereafter with emphasis on \nsocioeconomic improvement \nimpacts. \n \n \nA social development action \nplan. \n\n \nTraffic counts by the Gansu \nProvincial Communications \nDepartment (GPCD) and \nPPMS. \n \n\nTravel time for the expressway \nreduced from 6.5 hours before \nproject to 3 hours after project. \n\nReduced bus fares and freight \nrates by 10% by 2015. \n \n\nTraffic counts and travel time \nsurvey for the expressway \nby GPCD. \n \nMonitoring of fares and rates \nby GPCD. \n\nBy 2015, the number of road \naccidents and fatalities in \nGansu province will be \nreduced by 20% from 13,403 \nand 1,837, respectively, in \n2003.

Of this, 1.44 million km were classified. Class II \nand  above  roads  accounted  for  271,600 km,  15%  of  the  total  length.  The  road  density  has \nincreased from 12.1 km per 100 square km (km2) in 1995 to 18.9 km per 100 km2 in 2003. That \nyear,  Gansu\u2019s  road  network  accounted  for  2.2%  of  the  country\u2019s  total,  with  a  length  of \n40,224 km. Of this total,  30,806 km  (76.6 %) were classified:  319 km  of  expressways  (0.8%), \n154 km of Class I roads (0.4%), 4,134 km of Class II roads (10.3%), and 26,199 km of Class III\u2013\nIV roads (65.1%). Unclassified roads amounted to 9,418 km (23.4%). The road density in Gansu \nwas 8.9 km per 100 km2, significantly lower than the national average. \n \n2. \nThe  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  is \npromoting a trans-regional Asian Highway Network, extending 140,000 km, of which 26,000 km \nare in the PRC. Road projects funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are contributing to \nthe development of this network through a total of 13 completed or planned projects comprising \n2,100 km, with a total loan amount of about $2.4 billion. \n  \nB. \n \n3. \nIn 2003, the  PRC vehicle fleet totaled  24 million trucks, cars, and buses, and  72 million \nother  motorized  vehicles  (motorcycles  and  agricultural  vehicles).  The  privately  owned  fleet  of \nmotor  vehicles  increased  more  than  20  times  during  1985\u20132003,  from  0.3 million vehicles to \n12 million. Despite the rapid increase in total vehicles, there are only about 1.3 vehicles for 100 \npersons, which is low relative to other Asian countries. The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade \nOrganization  has  increased  investment  in  the  automobile  industry,  reduced  the  tariffs  on \nimported  vehicles,  and  contributed  to  making  motor  vehicle  financing  easier  to  access.  These \nfactors,  plus  rapidly  growing  urban  incomes,  underpin  the  growth  in  road  traffic.  The \nmodernization of the vehicle fleet will improve vehicle safety and reduce individual vehicles\u2019 fuel \nconsumption  and  their  emissions.  In  2003,  the  number  of  vehicles  registered  in  Gansu  was \n134,900 passenger vehicles and  116,600 freight  vehicles. Vehicle ownership in Gansu is lower \nthan the national average. Privately owned vehicles totaled 100,000. Road passenger traffic in \nGansu province measured in terms of passenger-km of travel grew  by more than 70%  between \n1990  and  2002,  reaching  134 million.  Road  freight  traffic,  in  ton-km, grew  by  43%  during  the \nsame period. \n \nC. \n \nGansu Provincial Communications Department (GPCD) is responsible for regulating the \n4. \nroad  transport  industry  in  Gansu  by  licensing  drivers,  vehicles,  and  intercity  bus  services. \nFreight transport is essentially deregulated; however,  interprovincial bus routes require  Ministry \nof Communications (MOC) approval. Through trucking reforms, there has been an increase in \nprivate  operations  resulting  in  improved  transport  efficiency  and  quality  of  services  and \nincreased competition.  ADB  is  supporting  this  process  through  a  technical  assistance  (TA),1 \nwhich aims to help improve the performance of the road transport industry by formulating policy \nreforms in the road freight and passenger services. Road administration is decentralized.  Road \n\nRoad Administration \n\n                                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Policy Reform in Road Transport. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nRoad Sector Revenue and Expenditures \n\ntransport  tariffs  are  allowed  within  a  range  of  plus  or  minus  20% of advisory tariffs set by the \nlocal government. This flexibility, coupled with ease of market entry, will facilitate the passing on \nto transport users of cost reductions resulting from improved road conditions. \n \nD. \n \n5. \nExpenditures  in  highway  infrastructure  are  financed  from  dedicated  user  charges, \ngovernment  grants,  domestic  bank  loans  and  bonds,  and  foreign  loans  and  investments.  Two \ndedicated  user  charges,  the  road  maintenance  fee  and  vehicle  purchase  fee,  have  provided \nmuch  of  the  financing  for  the  road  sector.  During  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  of  1996\u20132000, the \nroad  maintenance  fee  and  vehicle  purchase  fee  provided  53%  and  13%,  respectively,  of  the \ntotal  road  investments.  Government  grants  provided  2%  mainly  to  construct  or  improve  rural \nroads  in  poor  areas.  The  rest  was  financed  from  domestic  loans  and  bonds  (9%),  other \ndomestic investments including financing from local governments and state-owned enterprises \n(12%), foreign loans (8%), and foreign direct investment (3%). \n \nAs  part  of  a  tax  reform  to  bring  off-budget  revenue  and  expenditures  within  the \n6. \nframework of the national budget, the National People\u2019s Congress passed amendments to the \nHighway  Law  on  31  October  1999.  The  amendments  laid  the  foundation  for  future  legislation \nproviding for national taxes to replace provincial and local fees. The vehicle purchase fee was \nreplaced by the vehicle purchase tax effective January 2001, and a fuel tax is being considered \nto replace the road maintenance fee. Based on findings of an ADB-financed TA, 2 the fuel tax is \nlikely to improve financing of the road sector.  \n \nIn Gansu province, GPCD invested about CNY4.9 billion in the road sector in 2003, of \n7. \nwhich  65%  was  allocated  to  construction  and  9%  to  maintenance.  During  the  10th  Five-Year \nPlan  (2001\u20132005),  total  investment  is  expected  to  be  about  CNY24  billion  with  an  annual \naverage growth rate of 5.8% during this period. GPCD plans to nearly double road investment to \nCNY44 billion during the 11th Five-Year Plan. \n \nE. \n \nRoad  projects  are  designed  by  planning  and  design  institutes  at  the  provincial, \n8. \nprefecture, and county levels. MOC reviews the designs of expressways, high-standard roads, \nand  associated  structures.  Design  institutes  are  staffed  with  experienced,  well-qualified \npersonnel. The city and county highway bureaus have their own construction units to carry out \nminor  projects  within  their  administrative  districts.  Drawing  on  the  experience  gained  under \nADB-  and  World  Bank-financed projects, competitive bidding practices were mandated by the \n1999 Tendering and Bidding Law. 3 Many of the largest provincial and urban construction units \nare being reorganized into financially independent companies and have been awarded contracts \nindividually or as partners in joint ventures on several ADB- and World Bank-financed in-country \nor overseas projects. \n \n9. \nRoad  maintenance  is  well  organized  by  the  expressway  companies  and  the  highway \nadministration  bureaus  and  is  carried  out  mainly  through  labor-intensive  operations  but  with \nincreasing  amounts  of  mechanized  works.  Although  maintenance  expenditures  increased \nsignificantly  in  absolute  terms  in  the  past  decade  and  maintenance  is  generally  adequate, \n\nRoad Engineering, Construction, and Maintenance  \n\n                                                                 \n2  ADB. 1998.

For the low-\nclass roads in rural areas, there is a strong tradition of community self-help by which rural roads \nare maintained by local residents by allocating several days of labor. This ensures a high level \nof  awareness  of  the  need  for  adequate  maintenance  and  pressures  the  local  governments  to \nmaintain  an  acceptable  level  of  serviceability.  Thus  maintenance  standards  in  rural  areas  are \nresponsive to public pressures where there is a strong tradition of public accountability. This is \nless  effective  in  towns  where  such  issues  tend  to  be  media-led  and  do  not  normally  result  in \nsustained pressure.4 \n \nF. \n \n10.  MOC  has  prepared  a  National  Rural  Road  Development  Plan.  Under  this  plan,  rural \nroads  will  be  developed  in  three  stages.  By  2005,  the  length  of  rural  roads  will  total \n1.55 million km; by 2010, 1.85 million km, connecting all townships and administrative villages in \nthe  country;  and  by  2020,  2.5 million km,  and  transport  services  will  be  provided  to \nadministrative village level. \n \nG. \n \n11. \nA relaxation of trucking regulations in the 1980s allowed privately owned trucks to haul \ncargo for state-owned factories and cooperatives. Privately owned trucks expanded their market \nshare during the 1990s at the expense of state-owned transport companies, many of which are \nnow  being  privatized.  The  competition  improves  road  transport  efficiency  and  service  quality. \nMOC  is  encouraging  the  private  sector  to  augment  the  overall  capacity  of  the  road  transport \nindustry.  In  the  future  more  small  freight  operators  will  merge  and  there  will  be  more \nprivatization of large state-owned companies. \n \n12. \nTo enhance benefits flowing to local communities through infrastructure improvement, it \nwill  be  necessary  to  ensure  that  efficient  and  safe  transport  services  are  in  place.  One  of  the \nissues relates to the lack of bus stops on the expressways. As the interprovincial expressway \nsystem  is  developed,  long-distance  public  transport  services  are  becoming  available  for  the \npeople living along the expressways. However, bus stops are unavailable on the expressways \nprimarily  for  safety  reasons,  given  that  the  expressways  are  access  controlled.  MOC\u2019s  new \nhighway design standards, effective 1 March 2004, provide for installing bus stops either along \nthe main lanes or at the service areas. GPCD will review the  possibility of providing bus stops \non  the  project  expressway  in  consultation  with  bus  operators  during  project  implementation, \nkeeping in view of the need to address safety aspects. Other issues are lack of competition in \nthe transport services market; regulations on tariff and routes for bus and trucking services; and \ninsufficient  credit  for  purchasing  vehicles,  especially  for  rural  and  informal  vehicles.  These \naspects of road transport are being addressed by MOC and selected provinces with assistance \nprovided under a recently approved TA. 5 \n \nH. \n \nADB  has  been  undertaking  policy  dialogue  on  the  PRC  road  sector  since  1991.  The \n13. \nprincipal  issues  addressed  include  the  poverty  impact  of  road  projects,  highway  design \nstandards,  and  construction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing  policies, \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n                                                                 \n4  ADB. 1998.

About  84%  of  all \naccidents  were  caused  by  driver  error,  with  26%  involving  unlicensed  drivers.  Weather \nconditions  did  not  have  a  large  impact  on  the  number  of  accidents  (79%  of  accidents  occur \nduring fine weather and 9% during cloudy weather). There were more accidents in the day than \nat  night  (75%  of  all  accidents  were  during  the  day).  There  was  no  relationship  between  road \nconditions and accident rates as 82% of accidents occurred on normal road sections, with 73% \nof  these  accidents  taking  place  on  straight,  flat  roads.  The  majority  of  accidents  occur  on  city \ntrunk  roads  and  lower  grade  (Class  II  or  III)  roads.  Lack  of  proper  driver  training,  inadequate \nenforcement of traffic regulations, alcohol, and the lack of use of seat belts and infant car seats \ncontribute to the high accident and death rates. \n \nThe cause of most traffic accidents in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) seems to be \n2. \na neglect of traffic rules and people\u2019s casual attitude toward road safety. Given this situation, the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) supported the development of a comprehensive action plan in \n2001  to  address  critical  road  safety  issues  in  the  PRC.  This  resulted  in  the  revision  of  traffic \nlaws that became effective on 1 May 2004 with the goal of reducing traffic accidents. There has \nalso been a radio publicity campaign to promote driver awareness. \n \n3. \nEvery  year,  the  Traffic  Management  Department  prepares  a  road  safety  action  plan \nbased on the results of analyses of traffic accidents from the previous year. Some strategies to \nreduce traffic accidents are as follows:  \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nestablishing an Accident Protection Division and setting  up branch organizations \nin counties and villages. The work of branch units is carried out with local traffic \npolice and other relevant organizations. GPSB analyzes accident data collected \nfrom each organization to draw up future strategies;  \nstrengthening  police  checks  and  increasing  police  patrols  on  roads  to  enforce \ntraffic laws and regulations; and \npromoting \ntraffic  safety  via  pamphlets,  posters,  and  other  modes  of \ncommunications  that  promote  the  use  of  seat  belts  and  cover  the  adverse \nrelationship between road safety and alcohol consumption. \n\n \n4. \nAccident-prone areas are selected and targeted by GPSB yearly. Measures to eliminate \nthem  include:  (i) educating  drivers  about  safe  driving  and  dangerous  road  conditions; \n(ii) locating  police  checkpoints  at  or  near  black  spots;  (iii) installing  speed  limits  and  other \nwarning  signs  and  plates  in  easy-to-see  locations;  (iv) installing  guardrails,  traffic  barriers,  or \nfences  at  curves;  (v) changing  traffic  lane  markings  when  necessary  from  white  to  yellow  in \ncolor; and (vi) improving the cross grade at sharp curves. \n \nMost  accidents  are  caused  by  driver  error  due  to  speeding,  overloading,  neglecting \n5. \ntraffic  signals,  dangerous  overtaking,  or  consumption  of  alcohol.  Accidents  caused  by  faulty \nroad  structure are small in number and are sometimes due to poor pavement conditions as a \nresult of insufficient maintenance. The structure of the proposed expressway, which is based on \nPRC\u2019s Highway Design Standards presents no problems in terms of road safety. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6        35 \n\nVehicle Emissions \n\nWhile  horizontal  and  vertical  alignments  meet  safety  standards,  there  is  still  room  for \n6. \nimprovement. Safety facilities will be reinforced for the alignment near Pingjiashan Tunnel. For \nexample, a special lane marking consisting of continuous broken lines on either side is effective \nat  sharp  curves  for  visually  informing  drivers  of  a  potentially  dangerous  upcoming  section  of \nroad. \n \n7. \nRoad safety facilities and equipment for expressway operations can be divided into three \ntypes according to their function. The  first type directly affects driver behavior, the second type \nis for responding to accidents, and the third type is for accident prevention. Examples of such \nroad  safety  facilities  are  as  follows  and  will  be  considered  for  the  Project:  (i) facilities  directly \naffecting driver behavior, including (a) crash barriers, (b) special lane marking, (c) variable traffic \ninformation  boards,  and  (d)  traffic  monitoring  systems;  (ii) accident  response,  including \n(a) emergency  telephones,  (b) station  post  signs,  (c) vehicles  and  tools  required  for  accident \nattendance  or  investigation;  and  (iii) accident  prevention,  including  (a) speed  measurement \ndevices,  (b) devices  for  measuring  the  amount  of  alcohol  consumed  by  drivers,  (c) axle load \nmeasurement devices, and (d) accident data recording and analysis system.  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nVehicle  ownership  in  the  PRC  has  been  increasing  sharply,  with much of this growth \noccurring  in  cities.  Nationally,  the  annual  growth  of  vehicles  has  averaged  14%  per  year.  The \ntotal number of motorized vehicles reached 96.5 million by the end of 2003, 21% higher than in \n2002.  One  result  of  this  rapid  growth  has  been  the  emergence  of  motor  vehicle  air  pollution \nproblems, especially in cities. The growth in the vehicle fleet will continue in coming decades, \nresulting  in  concerns  regarding  further  environmental  degradation.  It  is  estimated  that  vehicle \nemissions will account for 79% of air pollution by 2005. \n \n9. \nKey  environment-related  motor  vehicle  programs  include  those  in  the  areas  of \n(i) national  emissions  standards  for  new  vehicles,  (ii) improvement  of  conventional  fuels, \n(iii) alternative  or  cleaner  fuels,  (iv) vehicle  inspection  and  maintenance  programs,  and \n(v) retirement of obsolete polluting vehicles. \n \nThe  government  emission  standards  for  new  vehicles  are  as  follow:  (i) the limits and \n10. \nmeasurement  methods  for  exhaust  pollutants  from  compression  ignition  engines  of  vehicles, \nissued  on  16  April  2001,  has  been  implemented  in  two  stages:  (a) from  16  April  2001  to  1 \nSeptember  2003,  and  (b) from  1  September  2003;  (ii) limits  and  measurement  methods  for \nexhaust pollutants from positive ignition engines of vehicles and vehicles equipped with positive \nignition engines, issued on 27 November 2002, has been implemented in two stages: (a) from 1 \nJanuary  2003  to  1  September  2003;  and  (b) from  1  September  2003;  (iii) limits  and \nmeasurement methods for exhaust emissions from motorcycles under running mode, issued on \n27 November 2002, have been implemented in three stages: (a) from 1 January 2003, (b) from \n1  July  2003  to  31  December  2004,  and  (c) from  1  January  2005;  (iv) limits and measurement \nmethods for exhaust emissions from motorcycles at idle speed, issued on 18 November 2002, \nhave  been  implemented  in  two  stages:  (a) from  1  January  2003,  and  (b) from  1  July  2003; \n(v) limits and measurement methods for exhaust emissions from mopeds under running mode, \nissued on 27 November 2002, have been implemented in two stages: (a) from 1 January 2003 \nand (b) from 1 January 2004. \n \nThese  standards  are  approximately  equivalent  to  the  Euro  II  performance  standards. \n11. \nVehicles  failing  to  meet  the  standards  cannot  be  manufactured,  imported,  sold,  or  registered. \n\n \n\n\f36        Appendix 6 \n\nThe  Vehicle  Emission  Control  Center  will  publicize  the  list  of  vehicles  that  meet  the  above \nstandards.  \n \n12.  Measures have been taken to phase out the distribution of leaded fuels. Since 1 January \n2000 there has been no further production, and since 1 July 2000, no sales of leaded fuels have \nbeen  permitted  in  the  PRC.  Trucks  and  heavy  vehicles  mostly  use  diesel  engines  that do not \nrequire  any  lead  additives.  There  has  been  no  difficulty  in  switching  to  unleaded  fuel  as  it \nbecame available. Leaded gasoline is no longer available in urban areas, although old stocks of \nleaded gasoline in some rural areas may still be sold.  \n \n13. \nSulfur  content  is  regulated  via  petroleum-refining  production  standards  (content-  and \nquality-based). The limitation for sulfur content in the standards of unleaded gasoline for motor \nvehicles  and  the  hazardous  materials  control  standard  for  motor  vehicle  gasoline is less than \n0.08%  (m/m).  The  Government  has  targeted  sulfur  in  fuels  as  part  of  broader  sulfur  dioxide \ncontrol efforts. \n \nTo  reduce  vehicle  emissions,  the  Government  has  established  the  National  Clean \n14. \nAutomobile Working Team led by the Ministry of Science and Technology, which is committed \nto speeding up the development and use of clean fuel vehicles. A pilot program for the utilization \nof  clean  fuel  has  been  implemented  in  12  cities,  including  Beijing,  Tianjin,  Shanghai,  and \nChongqing.  The  PRC\u2019s  four  leading  vehicle  makers  have  been  designated  as  production \ncenters for natural gas-powered vehicles. By October 2003, the number of natural gas-powered \nvehicles reached 190,000 and 560 gas stations had been built in 16 major cities to support the \nmove.  \n \n15. \nThe  environmental  protection  departments  in  the  provinces,  autonomous  regions,  and \nmunicipalities directly under the central Government can commission units undertaking annual \ntests on motorized vehicles that have obtained qualification certification from the public security \ndepartments  to,  in  accordance  with  relevant  codes,  conduct  annual  checks  on  emission \npollution of motorized vehicles. \n \n16. \nThe environmental protection departments of local people\u2019s governments at the county \nor above levels can conduct random tests of in-use motorized vehicles to check their pollutant \nemission level. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7        37 \n\nTRANSPORT SERVICES IN THE PROJECT AREA \n\n \n1. \nVillage-Based  Transport.  Within  the  30  villages  surveyed  by  the  TA  consultants, \nmotorized tricycles  (45%)  and motorcycles  (38%)  are  the  most  common  vehicles  followed by \nutility vehicles  (11%),  trucks  (2.5\u20135  ton)  (4%),  and  minivans  (2%).  Vehicles  are an important \nsource of income for most owners. Almost every household has at least one bicycle, but  during \nwinter  the  poor  road  conditions  and  the  weather  prevent  their  use.  Motorized  tricycles are  the \nmost common method of transporting goods and agricultural produce to markets as well as from \nfarmlands to houses, and occasionally passengers. These are relatively less expensive vehicles \ncosting  in  a  range  of  CNY2,000\u2013CNY20,000  in  the  project  area  depending  on  the  type. \nUpgrading local roads will contribute to lower maintenance costs and greater safety of tricycles.  \n \nBus Services. The quality of bus services varies from place to place. Most villages are \n2. \nlocated  along  a  road  where  regular  bus  services  are  available.  Within  the  villages  surveyed, \nmost  people  are  satisfied  with  the  level  of  bus  services  available.  People  use  bus  services  to \n(i) go shopping, (ii) visit a doctor or hospital, (iii) attend middle school, (iv) travel for employment \npurposes,  (v) carry  out  trade  activities,  and  (vi) visit  family  or  friends.  The  villages  were \nsurveyed for frequency of bus services; 52% had 5\u201310 buses per day; 22% had 11\u201330 buses \nper day; 11% had more than 30 buses per day; and 15% had less than 5 buses per day. Those \nvillages with the best access are those located along National Highway 312. Other villages are \nless well served. The quality of the bus services ranges from moderate to good.  \n \n3. \nFreight  Companies.  Of  the  three  freight  companies  interviewed,  two  companies \ntransport  mainly  consumer  durables,  dry  foods,  construction  materials,  and  coal.  Of  the \nproducts shipped out of the province by one company, 70% is agricultural produce. Attitudes to \ntoll  roads  vary.  One  company  believes  that  tolls  have  little  impact  on  freight  charges,  another \nthat  the  total  freight  cost  is  reduced  due  to  better  road  conditions,  and  the  third  that  the \nadditional cost is equally shared between the company and the customer. All three companies \nnoted  that  rural  poor  roads  result  in  higher  oil  consumption  and  vehicle  wear  and  tear,  which \nundermine  profits.  Rates  charged  are  based  on  various  criteria  depending  on  each  company, \nsuch  as  (i) weight  of  goods,  (ii) an  underloaded  truck  counted  as  a  full  load,  (iii) tons  per \nkilometer, and (iv) higher rates for transporting fresh produce. \n \n4. \nManufacturers  also  use  freight  companies.  Five  manufacturers  operating  in  Lanzhou \ncity, Pingliang city, and three in the project area counties were interviewed. All used the existing \nhighway,  the  benefits  being  (i) shorter  driving  time,  (ii) reduction  of  wear  and  tear  on  vehicles \nleading to lower maintenance costs, (iii) little damage to goods, and (iv) safety. Transport costs \nas a share of the price of goods ranges from 10% to 40%. All respondents agreed that the road \nquality  affects  the  efficiency  of  their  business  and  that  narrow  roads  of  poor  quality  seriously \naffect  driving  speeds  and  cause  congestion,  which  damages  or  delays  delivery  of  goods, \njeopardizes the company\u2019s image, and reduces profits. \n \n5. \nWholesalers.  Agricultural wholesalers collect produce from villagers as shown in Table \nA7.  Most  of  the  produce  handled  by  these  wholesalers  is  shipped  outside  the  county  or \nprovince. The maximum proportion sold within the county is 25%. All those interviewed used toll \nroads due to (i) smooth traffic flow and consistent speed with few obstacles, no poor or rugged \nsections,  and  no  need  to  drive  through  population  centers;  and  (ii) savings  on  time,  vehicle \noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  fuel  costs.  Disadvantages  include  (i) traffic congestion \ndue to a limited number of opened toll gates or a long time taken for police vehicle inspection at \nthe toll gates, and (ii) high tolls.  \n \n\n \n\n\f38        Appendix 7 \n\n \n\nTable A7: Wholesalers and Transport \n\n% Produce \nBrought to \nWholesaler \nby Farmers \n29 \n\n% Brought to \nWholesaler \nby Other \nTransporters \n35 \n\n% Collected \nfrom Villages \nby Wholesaler \n36 \n\n% of Payment by \nFarmer to Cover \nCost of Transporta \n20\u201330 \n\nBase \nLongde County \n\nMethod of Calculation \nof Cost of Transportb  \nUnit freight is CNY0.4\u2013\n0.6 km/ton.

Local roads are developed and maintained \nby the government at the county, township, and village levels and they are often underfunded \nfor  construction  and  maintenance.  Village  roads  are  sometimes  impassable  during  the  wet \nseason. For example, only 16 out of the 30 villages in the project area have all-weather village \nroads. There is some correlation between the level of vehicle ownership and the condition of the \nroads from the village to the township. Those villages with all-weather roads have three times as \nmany  vehicles  per  household  as  those  without  seasonal  roads.  Provision  of  all-weather roads \nand availability of vehicles are both essential to provide better access to rural areas.  \n \n7. \nThe  Project  will  include  four  roadside  stations  planned  by  the  Gansu  Provincial  Public \nTransport  Bureau.  Since  the  March  2004  Highway  Design  Standard  includes  a  provision  that \nexpressways  can  include  bus  stops  for  long-distance  transport,  the  current  situation  in  the \nproject area will be reviewed to examine the applicability of this provision in the project design. \n \nTo  improve  transport  services  in  the  project  area,  the  following  areas  pertaining  to \n8. \nregulations  will  need  to  be  addressed:  (i) the  regulations  for  motorized  tricycles  should  be \nimproved,  especially  on  vehicle  licensing  and  registration,  fees,  entry  restrictions,  emissions, \nand  vehicle  standards;  tax  incentives  could  be  used  to  help  manufacturers  meet  these \nstandards; (ii) promotion of competition for the provision of transport services; (iii) measures to \nincrease the supply of public transport services to rural areas, such as introducing the universal \nservice  obligation  concept  to  the  service  providers  and  using  some  regulatory  instruments; \n(iv) comprehensive review of the transportation tariff to ensure competitive pricing; (v) measures \nto extend public transport services to specific groups such as providing discounts for students, \nthe disabled, and the elderly or discounts for people traveling at certain hours in urban transport \nservices,  without  compromising  competition;

Based on these surveys, a \ntraffic  demand  model  was  constructed  and  traffic  forecasts  carried  out  and  subsequently \nupdated in 2002.  The  model  was  refined  under  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  by  carrying  out \nadditional  surveys  consisting  of  rail  and  bus  user  interviews  and  traffic  counts.  Based  on  the \nwork of the TA team, the traffic forecasts for the Project, which focused on the Lanzhou-Xi\u2019an \ntransport corridor, have been finalized and are described below. \n \n2. \nThe road network that extends from Lanzhou to Xi\u2019an has four existing routes, consisting \nof  national  highways  and  a  provincial  highway  (PH)  and  are  as  follows:  (i) NH312,  (ii) NH309, \n(iii) NH310-NH316-PH209,  and  (iv) NH310-NH045.  The  traffic  volume  for  the  existing  NH312 \nincreased  during  1995\u20132000  at  8.6%  per  annum.  Then  there  was  a  drop  in  2001  due  to  the \nopening of an alternative road between Chankou and Tianshui. Traffic volume started to make a \nstrong recovery in 2002. \n \n3. \nAnalysis of future traffic demand took into account four modes of road travel: passenger \nvehicles,  buses,  trucks,  and  large  trucks.  The  technique  applied  to  forecasting  future  traffic \ndemand is the four-step estimation method and predicts traffic in a four-step process that covers \ntrip generation/attraction, trip distribution, modal split, and traffic assignment. The forecast years \nfor the Project are 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2029. \n \n4. \nTrip  Generation.  Trip  generation  and  attraction  models  were  constructed  for  nine \ninternal zones to cover the 10 counties of the project area that lie on either side of NH312, while \ngrowth  rate  factors  were  applied  to  derive  the  generated  and  attracted  trips  for  16  external \nzones.  The  generation  and  attraction  models  were  constructed  after  examining  and  applying \nsuch socioeconomic factors as gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, population, and \nvehicle ownership. Based on these models, it was possible to derive total trips for each of the \ntarget years.  \n \n5. \nTrip  Distribution.  Trip  distribution  was  carried  out  using  the  total  trips  generated/ \nattracted  for  each  of  the  target  years  and  applied  to  the  updated  origin-destination  (OD) \nmatrixes in order to make direct use of observed traffic flows. The validity of these matrixes was \nfirst confirmed by comparing actual link flows with flows obtained from the assignment of the OD \nmatrixes for the base year.  \n \n6. \nModal  Split.  Modal  split  for  rail-  and  road-based  modes  was  carried  out  based  on the \nfollowing principles:  (i) a  modal  split  model  using  an  exponential  function  as  a  diversion  curve \nwith time as a variable was applied to forecast the shifting of passengers between rail and bus; \n(ii) based on survey data, it was assumed that there would be virtually no shifting between bus \nand private passenger cars, given that only 1% of bus users own a car; (iii) it was assumed that \nthere would be a shift of about 8% of rail passengers to private passenger vehicles based on \nsurvey data; and (iv) in the case of cargo diversion, it was assumed that a shift in non-bulk high-\nvalue cargo, which accounts for  only about 5% of total rail cargo, would occur as a result of the \nconstruction of the project expressway. \n \n7. \nAssignment. Based on the updating and validation of the OD matrixes of the feasibility \nstudy  and  then  the  future  prediction  of  trips  via  the  construction  of  the  above  models,  future \ninterzonal  trips  for  each  of  the  target  years  were  assigned  to  the  road  network  of  the  corridor \nusing  an  incremental  traffic  assignment  model.  This  model  operates  on  the  principle  of  equal \n\n \n\n\f46        Appendix 12 \n\ntravel times. That is, in terms of OD pairs, increased traffic volume on a given route causes a \nslowdown of travel time on that route, and part of the traffic then diverts to another route with a \nshorter travel time. This process of diversion will repeat itself until no shorter alternative route is \navailable,  or  until  the  point  of  equal  travel  times  is  reached.  Of  the  trips  that  use  the  project \nexpressway, 56% pass through the project area and do not stop there. The next largest type of \ntrip  consisted  of  in-in  trips,  or  trips  that  both  originated  and  ended  in  the  nine  internal  zones. \nFinally, the trip type smallest in number was the in-out trips, accounting for 25% of total trips. \n \nThere will be significant improvements in terms of the performance and efficiency of the \n8. \nroad network of the Lanzhou-Xi\u2019an transport corridor as a result of the construction of the project \nexpressway.  For  example,  without  the  expressway,  average  travel  speed  will  decrease  to \n45.9 kilometers  per  hour  (km/h)  by  2029.  On  the  other  hand,  with  the  expressway,  average \nspeed  in  the  corridor  in  2029  will  be  66.3 km/h.  In  terms  of  travel  time,  which  is  a  function  of \ncongestion and road network connectivity, without  the  Project  there  would  be  an  increase  in \ntotal travel time of 45.3%. Given this, the project expressway will divert significant vehicle trips \n(especially through trips) from other roads, and this will reduce the number of accidents, vehicle \noperating  costs  (VOCs),  and  travel  time  on  many  roads  in  the  corridor  and  thereby  directly \nbenefit  the  project  area.  Growth  in  traffic  demand  was  determined  based  on  future \nsocioeconomic  trends  that  took  into  account  changes  in  variables  such  as  gross  domestic \nproduct,  population,  and  vehicle  ownership.  The  forecast  traffic  volume  on  the  expressway  is \nexpected to grow from 7,600 passenger car units (pcu) in 2010 to 15,100 pcu in 2020, a 7.1% \naverage annual growth rate. It will then grow more slowly at 6.0% per annum thereafter to reach \n25,600 pcu in 2029. The traffic on the local roads will grow more slowly because of slow growth \nprospects in the project area. The forecast traffic volume is expected to grow from 1,700 pcu in \n2010 to 2,800 pcu in 2020. It will then grow more slowly to reach 4,000 pcu in 2029. \n \n\nTable A12: Average Annual Daily Traffic of Project Expressway \n(passenger car units) \n\n \n\nRoad Section \nDingxi-Shiqiaoopu \n\nShibalipu-Huining \n\nHuining-Taipingdian \n\nTaipingdian-Jingning \n\nJingning-Cailian \n\nCailian-Longde \n\nLongde-Dongshanpu \n\n2010 \n\n2015 \n\n    6,559       9,934  \n\n    6,437       9,743  \n\n    5,285       7,433  \n\n    5,477       7,958  \n\n    5,939       9,204  \n\n    6,032       9,326  \n\n    5,929       9,093  \n\nDongshanpo-Pingliang West \n\n  10,531  \n\n  15,714  \n\nPingliang West-Pingliang East \n\n    8,608     12,981  \n\nPingliang East-Siqiaopu \n\n  10,351  \n\n  15,214  \n\nSishilipu-Chongbai \n\nChongbai-Jingchuan \n\n  10,339  \n\n  13,927  \n\n  10,440  \n\n  14,551  \n\n  15,543  \nJingchuan-Luohandong \n  15,130  \nWeighted Average \nSource: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n    8,828     11,555  \n    7,621     11,069  \n\n5.5 \n7.8 \n\nGrowth \nRate \n(%) \n8.7 \n\nGrowth \nRate \n(%) \n7.0 \n\nGrowth \nRate \n(%) \n5.9 \n\n2020 \n  13,928  \n\n  13,381  \n\n  10,336  \n\n  11,094  \n\n  12,002  \n\n  13,170  \n\n  12,780  \n\n  20,331  \n\n  17,805  \n\n  20,933  \n\n  19,507  \n\n  20,150  \n\n8.6 \n\n7.1 \n\n7.8 \n\n9.2 \n\n9.1 \n\n8.9 \n\n8.3 \n\n8.6 \n\n8.0 \n\n6.1 \n\n6.9 \n\n2029 \n  23,260  \n\n  23,399  \n\n  18,877  \n\n  20,162  \n\n  21,446  \n\n  23,342  \n\n  22,359  \n\n  33,657  \n\n  29,789  \n\n  33,032  \n\n  33,123  \n\n  32,447  \n\n  24,674  \n  25,562  \n\n6.6 \n\n6.8 \n\n6.9 \n\n5.5 \n\n7.1 \n\n7.0 \n\n5.3 \n\n6.5 \n\n6.6 \n\n7.0 \n\n6.7 \n\n6.1 \n6.4 \n\n6.4 \n\n6.9 \n\n6.9 \n\n6.7 \n\n6.6 \n\n6.4 \n\n5.8 \n\n5.9 \n\n5.2 \n\n6.1 \n\n5.4 \n\n5.3 \n6.0 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13        47 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n \nThe project expressway1 traverses the eastern part of Gansu province. Local roads are \n1. \nconnected to the expressway through the road network system. The economic analysis covers \nthe 25 years of construction and operation. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the \nproject  expressway  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  situation  with  and  without  the  Project. \nWithout  the  Project,  traffic  will  use  the  existing  road  network,  which  will  be  congested  and \nexpensive to maintain due to the rapidly increasing volume of traffic. Some travel may not take \nplace because of the congestion and the resulting increasing travel times and vehicle operating \ncosts (VOCs). With the Project, congestion on the existing roads will be reduced, and traffic on \nthe expressway and the existing roads will benefit from faster, cheaper, and safer travel. Some \nadditional trips will be generated as the economy responds to lower transport costs and better \nservice. \n \n2. \nAlternative  Analysis.  Possible  alternative  interventions  were  considered  to  meet  the \ngrowing  transport  demand  in  the  project  area  as  part  of  the  national  and  provincial  transport \nnetwork  plan.  Alternative  analysis  reviewed  various  options  in  terms  of  transport  modes, \nalignments, technical designs, timing of investments, and financing modalities. While enhancing \nthe existing railway capacity may be an option to partly meet the increasing demand, it will not \ncompletely satisfy the various kinds of traffic, particularly high-value general cargo that requires \na more flexible and responsive mode to meet the needs of a market economy. Six alternative \nalignments  were  reviewed  based  on  geologic  and \nterrain \nconsiderations, consultations with community representatives, cost estimates, relative impacts \non environment and resettlement, and integration with the national and local transport network. \nThe  expressway  technical  design  was  proposed  after  consideration  of  the  national  highway \nnetwork,  consistency  in  the  standards  of  contiguous  sections  at  each  end  of  the  project \nexpressway,  and  forecast  traffic.  Alternative  financing  modalities  were  considered,  including \nprivate  sector  investment.  However,  private  sector  investment  was  not  found  attractive  due  to \nrisks associated with construction and low estimated rates of return. Hence public financing was \nconsidered appropriate. \n \n3. \nExpressway  Component.  The  economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  using  constant \n2004 prices. The project costs and benefits were revalued at economic prices by separating the \ncost  items  into  tradable  materials  and  equipment  and  nontradable  materials,  labor,  and  land. \nThe  prices  were  expressed  in  yuan  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow \nexchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow price was used to put an \neconomic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages for skilled labor since \nthere was no surplus of skilled workers. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.5 was used to convert \nthe financial wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of labor. The costs of the expressway \ninclude:  (i) the  capital  costs, \nland  acquisition,  and \nresettlement;  and  (ii) the  costs  of  operating  and  maintaining  the  expressway.  The  land  and \nresettlement costs were based on their opportunity costs, i.e., agricultural output forgone and re-\nsiting of displaced activities. \n \nThe  economic  benefits  include  (i) savings  in  VOCs  resulting  from  the  reduced  travel \n4. \ndistance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the value of passenger time and of freight \n\nincluding  physical  contingencies, \n\ntopographical  conditions, \n\n                                                                 \n1  The portion of the expressway that passes through Ningxia, while not included in the project scope, is considered \nin the economic analysis, given that it is an indivisible part of the Project for the purposes of traffic forecasting and \neconomic analysis. \n\n \n\n\f48        Appendix 13 \n\ntied  up  in  transit,  (iii) savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents,  (iv) benefits  to  generated  traffic, \nand (v) savings in capital and operation and maintenance costs for National Highway (NH) 312. \nA reduction in VOCs is the main source of economic benefits for the Project. Traffic diverting to \nthe expressway would travel at high, more economical speeds on a smoother road, with better \nvertical  and  horizontal  alignment,  less  congestion,  and  a  shorter  journey  distance.  Traffic \nremaining on the alternative  NH312 route would also benefit from a reduction in traffic volume \nand congestion. All these changes affect vehicle speeds and VOCs, which were estimated for \nall vehicle types likely to use the corridor. Savings in travel time will be seen both on the project \nexpressway and the existing roads.  Work-related  travel  time,  which  accounts  for  38%  of  daily \ntotal travel time, was evaluated for private vehicles. As for public transport, the results of the rail \nuser  and  bus  service  surveys  were  used  to  derive  this  figure.  Nonwork-related  trips  were \nevaluated  as  10%  of  the  value  of  a  work-related trip.  The  economic  cost  of  accidents  was \nestimated  on  direct  property  damage.  The  EIRR  for  the  expressway  component was 16.1%, \nindicating  that  the  project  is  economically  viable,  with  a  net  present  value  (NPV) of  CNY2.9 \nbillion. \n \nLocal Road Component. About 470 km of local roads in five counties will be improved \n5. \nconcurrently with the expressway component. The costs of this component include capital costs \nand  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The  principal  benefits  of  the  local  road \nimprovements  were  identified  as  reduced  VOCs,  the  producer  surplus  that  is  the  value  of \nadditional  production  minus  production  costs,  and  these  are  mainly  for  fruits  and  vegetables. \nTransport  cost  savings  will  accrue  to  normal  traffic  on  the  improved  roads.  The  local  roads \nrecommended for upgrading were chosen based on poverty incidence, the effect on overall road \nnetwork  efficiency,  economic  development  potential,  and  population  density.  The  five  local \nroads have a combined EIRR of 25.7%. \n \n6. \nThe  Whole  Project.  The  Project  as  a  whole  generates  an  estimated  EIRR  of  16.6% \n(Table  A13.1).  The  VOC  savings  from  the  expressway  are  the  major  economic benefit (67%) \nfollowed by passenger time savings 19%. Avoided accident costs, savings to generated traffic, \nand other benefits are all relatively small. The benefits of the local road component  account for \n7%  of  the  total  benefits  (Table  A13.1).  The  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  confirm  the \nrobustness of the Project\u2019s economic viability: changes in the key variables\u2014construction costs, \n1-year delay in completion of the Ningxia section,2 without Ningxia section\u2014and benefits do not \nsignificantly affect the economic viability (Table A13.2). The capital cost would have to be 68% \nhigher  than  estimated  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  below  the  cutoff  rate  of  12%.  Considering  the \nexperience of ADB in the PRC, such an increase in capital cost is unlikely. ADB-financed road \nprojects in the PRC have not encountered major cost overruns. A risk analysis was carried out \nto determine the degree of uncertainty on the Project. Each uncertainty factor (such as capital \ncost, traffic growth, and VOC value) was varied at random within the limits. The results showed \nthat an EIRR exceeding 12% will be achieved with a 96% probability. The economic analysis of \nthe  Project  was  extended  to  analyze  distribution  of  project  net  benefits  by  determining  the \nproject  effects  for  various  beneficiaries,  including  road  users,  local  economy,  labor,  and \ngovernment. It was found that road users will receive the largest share of net benefit, accounting \nfor 79% of the total net benefits (Table A13.3). \n \n\n                                                                 \n2  Under this scenario, the traffic was assumed to be 20% less in 2010, 10% less in 2011, and 5% less in 2012. \n\n \n\n\fTable A13.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2004 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBenefits \n\n \n\nCost \n\nOperation \n\nYear \n\nCapital \n\nand \n\nTotal \n\nMaintenance \n\nVOC \nSavings \n\nTime \nSavings \n\nAccident \nSavings \n\nGenerated \nTraffic \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSavings in Capital \n\nand O&M Costs   \n\nfor Other Roads \n\nLocal Road \nComponent \n\nTotal \n\nNet        \n\nBenefit \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,063 \n1,679 \n2,579 \n1,880 \n897 \n16 \n32 \n34 \n35 \n37 \n38 \n40 \n41 \n43 \n44 \n668 \n48 \n50 \n52 \n54 \n607 \n58 \n60 \n63 \n(3,984) \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n842 \n910 \n984 \n1,064 \n1,151 \n1,244 \n1,361 \n1,489 \n1,630 \n1,783 \n1,951 \n2,112 \n2,287 \n2,476 \n2,681 \n2,903 \n3,142 \n3,402 \n3,684 \n3,988 \n\n \n\n1,063 \n1,679 \n2,579 \n1,880 \n897 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n622 \n\n551 \n\n \n \n \n(4,049) \n \n \n\n \n\n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n2028 \n2029 \n \n \n\n \n\n16 \n32 \n34 \n35 \n37 \n38 \n40 \n41 \n43 \n44 \n46 \n48 \n50 \n52 \n54 \n56 \n58 \n60 \n63 \n65 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nO&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost.  \nSource: Technical assistance consultants and As ian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n157 \n207 \n225 \n244 \n265 \n288 \n334 \n387 \n446 \n514 \n591 \n643 \n699 \n760 \n827 \n899 \n977 \n1,063 \n1,155 \n1,256 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n15 \n16 \n16 \n17 \n17 \n17 \n18 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n20 \n21 \n21 \n22 \n22 \n23 \n23 \n23 \n23 \n23 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n58 \n68 \n81 \n95 \n113 \n133 \n145 \n159 \n174 \n190 \n207 \n217 \n228 \n239 \n250 \n262 \n275 \n288 \n301 \n316 \n\n(71) \n(71) \n(71) \n(71) \n(71) \n125 \n132 \n139 \n146 \n153 \n161 \n170 \n179 \n188 \n198 \n208 \n218 \n230 \n242 \n254 \n267 \n281 \n295 \n311 \n327 \n\n(1,134) \n(1,750) \n(2,650) \n(1,951) \n(968) \n1,181 \n1,301 \n1,411 \n1,531 \n1,662 \n1,931 \n1,989 \n2,191 \n2,414 \n2,661 \n2,620 \n3,163 \n3,415 \n3,687 \n3,980 \n3,746 \n4,640 \n5,010 \n5,358 \n9,841 \nEconomic Net Present Value =  CNY3,513 \n16.6% \n\n(71) \n(71) \n(71) \n(71) \n(71) \n1,197 \n1,333 \n1,445 \n1,567 \n1,698 \n1,969 \n2,028 \n2,232 \n2,457 \n2,705 \n3,288 \n3,211 \n3,465 \n3,739 \n4,034 \n4,353 \n4,698 \n5,071 \n5,421 \n5,856 \n\n \n\n \n\n126 \n \n \n \n \n310 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(53) \n(53) \n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return = \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n3\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4\n9\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f50        Appendix 13 \n\nScenario \n\nTable A13.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n \n\nChange \n(%) \n\nEIRR \n(%) \n\nEconomic Net \nPresent Value \n(CNY million) \n\nSwitching \nValue \n(%)a \n\n \n\n \n\n \n1.

The  assumed  inflation  rates  are:  (i) foreign:  1.5%  for  2005;  0.9%  for \n2006  and  2007;  1.0%  for  2008  and  1.5%  from  2008  onward;  and  (ii) local:  2.7%  in  2005;  and \n3.0% per year from 2008 onward. The cost estimates are presented in current  terms taking into \naccount the potential impacts of domestic and international inflation.  \n \nB. \n \nOperating revenues from tolls are projected based on forecast traffic and a base toll rate \n2. \nof  CNY0.40  per  passenger  car  per  kilometer.  Corresponding  tolls  for  other  vehicle  types  are \nCNY0.55 for a small truck; CNY0.75 for a bus; CNY1.20 for a medium truck; and CNY1.50 for a \nlarge  truck  and  CNY1.90  for  a  trailer.  The  toll  charges  will  increase  in  current  terms  every  5 \nyears to keep up with  inflation.  There  would  be  no  real  increase  in  tolls  during  operation. Toll \ncharges  are  set  to  take  into  account  full  cost  recovery,  including  provision  for  periodic \nmaintenance, and to be adjusted to meet user affordability. 1 \n  \n3. \nAnnual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are calculated based on 2004 prices as \nfollows:  (i) wages  and  salaries  estimated  at  CNY8.2 million  in  2010  (386  toll  booth  staff  with \nannual average wages of CNY12,000 at 14 toll stations and 146 administration staff with annual \naverage salaries of CNY24,000).  The  number  of  toll  booth  staff  increases  as  traffic  grows  but \nthe  number  of  administrative  staff  remains  constant;  (ii) administration  costs  are  assumed  at \nCNY18,500 per staff year; (iv) routine and spot maintenance costs are estimated at CNY32,000 \nand  CNY20,000  per km  per  year,  respectively;  (v) materials  and  utilities  cost  an  average  of \nCNY5.3 million per year; (vi) environmental monitoring is budgeted at CNY300,000 per year. All \nincremental  O&M  costs  are  projected  to  increase  annually  in  line  with  domestic  inflation.  In \ncurrent  prices,  the  annual  O&M  costs  are  projected  to  rise  from  CNY35 million  in  2010  to \nCNY44.3 million in 2015 and CNY53.4 million by 2020. Periodic maintenance would be required \nafter 10 years of operation.   \n \n4. \nDepreciation  was  calculated  on  a  declining  balance  depreciation  method  with  an \naverage life of about 40 years for the main expressway component, 20 years for the pavement, \nand 15 years for equipment. \n \n5. \nTwo types of taxes were considered in the financial evaluation: business taxes of 5.5% \non gross revenue and corporate income tax at 33% of net profit. The Project will be exempted \nfrom corporate income tax fully for 2010\u20132011, receive a 50% corporate income tax exemption \nfor 2012\u20132014, and from 2015 onward it will pay full the corporate income tax rate on its profit.  \n \n6. \nThe  Project  will  be  funded  36%  by  equity  or  grants  and  64%  by  long-term loans.  The \ninterest rates on the China Development Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) loans are \n5.76%  and  5.48%  per  annum,  respectively.  The  China  Development  Bank  loan  will  be \nrepayable  over  25  years,  including  a  5-year  grace  period.  ADB\u2019s  loan  will  have  a  25-year \n\n                                                                 \n1  The  existing  toll  rates  in  Gansu  are  CNY0.35,  CNY0.55,  CNY0.80,  CNY1.25,  CNY1.60,  and  CNY2.00  for  small \n\ncars, small truck, bus, medium truck, large truck, and trailer, respectively.  \n\n \n\n\f52        Appendix 14 \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\nmaturity, including a 5-year grace period and will be a US dollar London interbank offered rate-\nbased loan. Interest expenses are capitalized during the construction period.  \n \n7. \nThe summary financial statement is presented in Table 14.1. The main conclusions are \nsummarized as follows: (i) the projected financial statement indicates that the forecast revenues \nunder  the  base  assumptions  are  sufficient  to  cover  annual  recurrent  costs,  depreciation,  and \ndebt repayments, and generate reasonable profits from expressway operations; (ii) the working \nratio will remain below 15%; (iii) the debt service coverage ratio will be above 1.2 from the third \nyear of operations; and (iv) the debt-to-equity ratio will decrease steadily from 67% in 2010 to \n56% by 2015 and 34% by 2020. These financial results indicate an acceptable financial position \nfor the expressway under the proposed financing plan and toll structure. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe major assumptions used to calculate the  financial internal rate of return (FIRR)  are: \n(i) all  calculations  are  in  2004  prices,  covering  a  period  from  2005  to  2029;  (ii) capital  costs \ninclude  all  capital  expenditures  related  to  the  construction  and  equipment  for  the  expressway, \nbut exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) O&M includes all expenses \nincurred  in  operating  the  expressway,  but  excludes  depreciation  and  debt  repayment; \n(iv) operating revenues from tolls used in financial projections were adjusted to 2004 prices; and \n(v) the residual value of the expressway was estimated based on weighted depreciation of 3.4% \nper year. \n \n9. \nThe  estimated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC),  after  tax,  in  real  terms  was \ncalculated based on the capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as follows: \n(i) the applicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% is used for \nADB  debt;  (ii) the  estimated  fixed  interest  costs  of  5.76%  per  annum  is  used  for  the  domestic \nloan funds; and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted \nto reflect the impact of income tax of 33%. The nominal cost of debt is converted to the real cost \nof debt by applying domestic and international average inflation rates for domestic and foreign \ncurrency denominated debt.  \n \nThe  FIRR  for  the  Project,  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  6.1%.  This compares \n10. \nfavorably  with  the  WACC,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  2.9%  (Table  14.2).  The \nProject is considered both financially viable and sustainable.  Sensitivity tests indicate that the \nconditions causing the Project's viability to fall below WACC are unlikely to occur. The sensitivity \nof the Project's financial indicators to cost and revenue variations is shown in Table 14.3. \n \n\n \n\n\fTable A14.1: Projected Financial Statements\n(CNY

Poor  accessibility  or  isolation  inhibits  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.  Research  has  shown  that  good  roads  are  one  of  the  most  important  types  of  infrastructure \nfor  poverty  reduction.  Good  roads  improve  access  for  the  poor  to  external  markets,  employment \nopportunities,  and  social  services;  lower  transport  costs  of  agricultural  inputs  and  products;  increase \ninteraction  with  other  regions  and  provide  opportunities to develop competitive advantages; and increase \nlocal  employment  opportunities  due  to  increased  economic  activities  in  the  project area, such as mining \nindustrial  development,  commercial  agriculture,  and  tourism.  The  Project\u2019s  local  road  component  will \nreduce  transport  barriers  and  help  add  economic  values  to  their  fruits,  vegetables,  and  livestock.  The \ncomponent will also increase access to social and physical infrastructure services (e.g., health, education, \nwater,  electricity,  and  telecommunications). The Project will create local employment opportunities for the \npoor, such as servicing local specialty foods and products and tourist information at the construction sites, \nservice areas, and roadside stations. Increased revenue from economic activities promoted by the Project \nwill enable the Government to spend more on social services. \n \nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?   \n  \nIn 2003, Gansu\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was  CNY4,984, the second lowest  among  the \nPRC\u2019s provinces and autonomous regions, and about half of the national average. In the project area, per \ncapita  GDP  was  even  lower  (CNY2,536),  about  one  fourth of the national average. The total population in \nthe  project  area  is  4.4 million,  of  whom  3.6 million  people,  or  82%,  are  project  beneficiaries.  Of  the  total \npopulation,  1.6 million  people  (36%)  are  poor,  living  on  annual  incomes  less  than  CNY900  per  capita for \nrural poverty (39%) and below the minimum living standards for urban poverty. About 1.1 million people or \n31% of the project beneficiaries are poor. This compares with the provincial rural poverty incidence of 40% \nbelow  CNY900.  Urban  poverty  ranged  from  7%  to  20.7%  in  five  project  counties  in  2003.  The  causes  of \npoverty in the project area include land degradation, a lack of water resources, a weak environment for the \nprivate sector and  poor infrastructure and access. In  the rural areas, poor  and seasonally accessible roads \nprevent  the  timely  delivery  of  goods  and  services,  and  discourage  cash  crop  production.  There  is  a  need \nfor  off-farm  work  and  labor  migration,  which  are  among  the  main  factors  to  lift  the  poor  out  of  poverty.  In \nurban  areas,  the  main  cause  of  poverty  is  lack  of  employment  opportunities.  The  project  area  has  the \npotential  to  develop  cash  crops  such  as  fruits,  as  well  as  livestock,  tourism,  and  coal  mining.  The  project \nexpressway  and  local  roads  will  improve  access  and  will  contribute  to  the  removal  of  these  development \nconstraints  and  promote  social  and  economic  development.  Poverty  reduction  activities  by  government \nagencies  (e.g.,  cash  crop  promotion,  irrigation,  and  livestock  activities)  will  complement  the  Project  and \nthus  contribute  to  improving  the  trade  of  rural  poor  farmers  and  reducing  poverty.  With  the  project \nexpressway,  other  main  highways,  and  rural  roads,  more  investment  and  business  activities  are  expected \nin  the  project  area  to  help  develop  its  economic  and  social  potential.  More  employment  will  be  created \nduring  and  after  project  construction  either  directly  in  construction  and  roadside  service  jobs  or  indirectly \nby  economic  development  in  the  project  area.  The  reduced  time  and  transport  cost  saving  from  the  local \nroads will benefit women and children by reducing their agricultural and household work and by improving \naccess to health and education. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15        57 \n\n  No \n\n  No  \n\n  Yes \n\n  Yes             \n\nimplementation.  Local  governments, \n\nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  \n \nStakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  during  project  preparation.  The  roles  of  each  stakeholder  group  are \nwell defined. Gansu Provincial Communications Department (GP CD) is the Executing Agency (EA), and is \nresponsible for  overall  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  project  director  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nproject  management,  and  approval  of  contracts  and  payments.  A  project  implementation  unit  established \nwithin  GPCD  will  monitor \nlocal  communities,  and  relevant \nstakeholders  will  assist  the  EA  in  implementing  the  resettlement  plan,  monitoring  and  implementing \nenvironmental  mitigation  activities,  and  organizing  local  labor  for  the  expressway  and  local  road \nconstruction and operations, including service areas and roadside stations.  The local roads component will \nbe  implemented  by  the  communications  bureaus  in  the  prefectures  of  Dingxi,  Baiying,  Pingliang,  and \nQingyang,  and  will  be  supported  by  the  subsidiary  offices  in  the  respective  counties,  and  under  the \nsupervision  of  GPCD.  Complementary  activities  to  enhance  the  social  and  poverty  impacts  of  the  Project \nwill be implemented by concerned agencies. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nDuring  project  preparation,  socioeconomic  surveys  and  public  meetings  were  conducted  among  potential \nbeneficiaries  to  raise  the  level  of  awareness  and  gain  local  support.  These  processes  enabled  local \nstakeholders  to  express  their  opinions  and  to  make  relevant  suggestions  to  the  project  design  and \nimplementation. Consultations with the rural poor, women, minorities,  and  vulnerable  groups were carried \nout during the project preparation socioeconomic survey on project impact and during local  road selection. \nThe participatory activities are ongoing and will continue during project implementation. \n \nFor  inclusion  and  selection  of  unskilled  labor  during  the road  construction,  contractors  will  consult  with \ncounty  poverty  reduction  offices,  labor  security  bureaus,  women\u2019s  federations,  and  villagers  along  the \nexpressway.  Training  will  be  provided  as  needed.  During  the  detailed  design  and  construction  of  the \nexpressway,  local  leaders  from  the  affected  villages  and  townships  will  be  consulted  in  order  to  further \nminimize  the  loss  of  land  and  structures.  For  the  local  roads  component,  villagers  will  provide  unskilled \nlabor at local market rates.  Service contractors at the roadside stations/service areas will be encouraged \nto  employ  local  poor  and  to  offer  places  for  the  sale  of  local  products  and  services.  Local  government \nresettlement offices and village committees will implement village rehabilitation plans.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nWomen  play  an  important  role  in  economic  and  agricultural  activities  as  well  as  in  the  domestic  sphere, \naccounting for 45% of the rural labor force in the project area. The Government promotes the social status \nof  women;  the  legal  framework  requires  women  be  given  equal  opportunities  with  men  in  respect  of \neducation, employment, and political rights. The women\u2019s federations at county and township levels play a \nsignificant role in protecting the rights and interests of women. An analysis of the data from the household \nsurvey reveals no difference in traveling patterns between Han and Hui women.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  young  women  by  providing  better  access  to  off-farm employment. The Project will \nbenefit  women  with  children  by  reducing  their  time  required  to  go  to  the  village  markets  for  household, \nagricultural,  and  off-farm  work.  Women  in  general  will  benefit  through  improved  access  to  health  and \neducation,  and  increased  employment  opportunities  in  roadside  services  during  and  after  the  Project. \nWomen, including ethnic minorities, will be given priority for different enhancement measures as indicated \nin the Social Development Action Plan (SDAP). \n \n\n  No        \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n\f58       Appendix 15 \n\nE.   Social Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n Item \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \n\nPlan Required \n\nThe land acquisition for the construction of the \nProject will result in some loss of land, houses, \nand other assets. A draft resettlement plan based \non the feasibility study and preliminary design \nestimates was prepared by EA for the affected \npeople in line with the 1998 Land Administration \nLaw and provincial guidelines. About 13,150 \npeople will be affected. Among these, 2,350 \npeople will lose either their houses or buildings. \nThose losing land will be compensated through \nvillage land reallocation. The Project will \npermanently acquire about 1,150 hectares of land.  \nThe socioeconomic survey found that most local \npeople could generally afford the transport \nservices. With the local roads, more transport \nservices at lower cost will be available to the poor. \nExpressways will require about 7,000 construction \nworkers, including 2,450 unskilled workers (mostly \nlocals) paid at CNY2,400 to CNY3,600 annually. \nExpressway operation will require a total of 489 \npeople for toll booths, service stations, and the \nmanagement unit. These include some relatively \nlow-skilled labor such as drivers, cleaners, and \nadministrative staff. During and after project \nconstruction, preference will be given to \ncontractors who offer local people employment \nand training opportunities, especially the poor, and \nvulnerable people, and Hui people. These \ncontractors will also buy goods and services from \nlocal people. \nThe population of the project area includes about \n140,000 Hui people (3.6% of total).  The Hui are \nmainly located in Kongtong and Huating counties, \nand are not vulnerable due to ethnicity. The \nresettlement plan includes mitigation measures for \nHui people. Specific actions to enhance the \nsocioeconomic status of Hui people are included \nin the SDAP. \n\nThe incidence of HIV/AIDS is low in Gansu, but \nthe risk of HIV/AIDS and other sexually \ntransmitted infections might increase during and \nafter the Project due to the increased migration \nand mobility of people into and out of the project \narea. The EA and contractors will take special \nmeasures during and after the Project by \nstrengthening existing county-level prevention \nprograms in the project area, as per the SDAP. \n\n Full \n Short \n None \n\n Yes \n No \n\n Yes \n No  \n\n Yes \n No  \n\nResettlement \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nAffordability \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nLabor \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n Yes \n No \n Specific Actions \n\n\fAppendix 16        59 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n\nThe  resettlement  plan  covers \n\n \n1. \nthe  construction  of  an  expressway  between \nLuohandong and Dingxi, related connecting roads, and complementary local roads. The Gansu \nprovincial government has assured the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that the affected people \nfor  the  local  roads  will  receive  the  same  compensation  and  other  assistance  provided  in  the \nresettlement plan. The Gansu Provincial Communication Department (GPCD) is the Executing \nAgency.  Once  the  detailed  measurement  survey  is  completed,  the  resettlement  plan  will  be \nupdated, distributed to affected people, and submitted to ADB for concurrence. \n \n2. \nThe project expressway will affect 23 townships, 93 administrative villages, and 374 \nvillage  groups  in  five  counties  (Jingchuan  county,  Kongtong  district,  and  Jingning  county  in \nPingliang  municipality,  Huining  county  in  Baiyin  municipality,  and  Anding  district  in  Dingxi \nmunicipality).  About  1,150  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be  acquired,  63%  of  which  are  farmland, \ncomprising  paddy  (16%)  and  dryland  (47%),  and  100  ha  of  land  will  be  occupied  temporarily. \nBased on per capita farmland in the affected villages, the farmland acquisition is equivalent to \n4,285  persons  losing  all  of  their  farmland.  Most  people  will  in  fact  only  lose  part  of  their \nfarmland. For this project, it is estimated that the average loss is one-third, which means land \nacquisition will directly affect about 13,150 persons. About 55,612 square meters (m2) of houses \nwill be demolished, necessitating relocation of 520 households (2,350 persons). Most of these \nhouseholds will be moved a short distance to another site within their original village. All land, \nhousing, and other assets will be compensated at replacement value. The local road component \nmay also involve land acquisition, which will be reported in the updated resettlement plan. Due \ndiligence  was  carried  out  for  the  Ningxia  section,  linking  two  parts of the project expressway. \nThe report on the due diligence is annexed to the resettlement plan. \n \n3. \nThe resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better income and living standards \nin  line  with  the  PRC  Land  Administration  Law  (1998)  and  the  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement. GPCD will ensure that people losing land, housing, other assets, or income source \nwill be helped to fully restore their income and living standards. The land compensation rate will \nbe  CNY12,000/mu  for  irrigated  farmland;  CNY6,000/mu  for  dry  land  and  housing  plots;  and \nCNY1,900/mu for forest land. For demolished structures, the replacement value will be provided \nto  the  affected  households  based  on  compensation  rates,  which  range  from  CNY350\u2013\nCNY460/m2  for  brick-concrete  structures, CNY200\u2013CNY300/m2  for  brick-wood structures, and \nCNY200/m2  for  earth-wood  structures.  Households  will  be  provided  funds  to  purchase  a  new \nhousing  site  serviced  with  road,  electricity,  and  water  within  the  current  village  group  or \nadministrative village.  There  will  be  no  reduction  in  compensation  for  depreciation  and  people \nwill be allowed to salvage materials from their old houses. Seventeen urban households will be \nrelocated and the compensation rate is in the range of CNY630\u2013CNY830/m2. GPCD will ensure \nthat compensation provided will be sufficient to purchase replacement housing. \n \n4. \nResettlement  effects  were  minimized  during  project  preparation  after  consultations \nwith  local  officials  and  local  residents.  Since  the  impacts  are  widely  dispersed  and  per  capita \nland  holdings  are  relatively  high,  land-loss  impacts  are  not  serious  and  their  effects  can  be \nmitigated.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  economic  rehabilitation  plans  for  seriously  affected \nvillages  based  on  consultation  with  affected  villagers.  Affected  people  will  be  provided  either \nwith  direct  compensation  or  replacement  land  through  village  land  readjustment  and  new \nfarmland  development.  Those  villages  adopting  land  readjustment  could  utilize  the  land \ncompensation  funds  collectively  to  improve  farm  conditions, develop cash crops, and finance \nvarious  nonfarm  activities.  New  employment  and  income  generation  opportunities  will  arise \nonce the expressway and local roads are constructed. \n \n\n \n\n\f60        Appendix 16 \n\n5. \nGPCD  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement  entitlements  are  provided  to  the affected \npeople  prior  to  demolition.  Land  compensation  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  village  groups  or \nindividuals.  Housing  compensation  and  compensation  for  crops  and  other  assets  will  be \nprovided directly to people losing those assets. The resettlement plan has provisions for moving \nallowances.  Also,  expressway  contractors  will  be  requested  by  GPCD  to  give  priority  to \nresettlement-affected households in the allocation of unskilled jobs during construction. \n \n6. \nA  project  resettlement  office  within  GPCD  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the \nplanning, implementation, financing, and reporting of resettlement for the expressway and local \nroads.  Leading  groups  and  resettlement  offices  will  be  established  in  each  of  the  three  cities \nand  five  affected  counties.  The  county  resettlement  offices  will  have  primary  responsibility  for \nresettlement consultation, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements.  \n \nOf  the  affected  people,  557  (4.2%  of  affected  persons)  are  Hui  (Muslim  minority). \n7. \nAmong 93 affected villages, only one village has 100% Hui population and three villages have \nmore than 10% Hui population. Since the Hui people are closely integrated in the current social \nsystem, the compensation and rehabilitation adopted for affected Hui people will be the same as \nthose for Han people. To respect their cultural customs and maintain their social relationships, \nall  affected  Hui  people  will  be  resettled  within  the  same  villages.  For  economically  vulnerable \npeople, including the elderly living alone, the disabled, households headed by women, and very \npoor  households,  the  Project  will  provide  additional  financial  and  physical  support.  About  407 \nhouseholds  and  1,893  persons  belong  to  this  group  and  they  will  receive:  (i) physical help in \nhousing construction and relocation free of charge, and (ii) a special subsidy to enable them to \nmaintain their living standards while constructing their houses. For this purpose, GPCD agreed \nto budget 1% of total resettlement cost. \n \n8. \nThe land acquisition and resettlement cost includes land compensation, resettlement \nsubsidy,  payments  for  housing  and  other  assets,    moving  allowances,  subsidy  for  vulnerable \ngroups,  fees  for  administration,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  GPCD  will  guarantee  to \nsupplement the resettlement budget to meet any shortfall that may occur. Land acquisition will \nbegin  by  April  2005  and  will  be  completed  by  December  2006.  Households  will  be  relocated \nbetween April 2005 and October 2006. \n \n9. \nThe affected people have been notified about the key elements of the resettlement \nplan during meetings and interviews. Prior to implementation, there will be further consultations \narranged by township and village officials to discuss specific impacts on each village and how \nthey will be addressed. Villagers will have input in decisions on how to utilize the collective land \ncompensation  funds.  GPCD  and  relevant  county  resettlement  offices  distributed  resettlement \ninformation  booklets  to  all  affected  townships,  villages  and  households  on  12  August  2004. \nThere is a procedure to raise grievances and seek redress. \n \n10. \nGPCD  will  engage  a  qualified  agency  to  carry  out  independent  resettlement \nmonitoring and evaluation. The monitoring agency will ascertain the extent to which the affected \npeople  have  (i) received  their  full  entitlements  on  time,  and  (ii) fully restored their livelihoods, \nincome levels, and living standards.
