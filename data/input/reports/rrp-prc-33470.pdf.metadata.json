An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nundertaken, and the summary was circulated to the Board and \nmade public through the ADB web site on 30 July 2004. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  is  located  in  Gansu  province  in  the  poor \nnorthwestern region of the PRC. In 2003, the per capita gross \ndomestic  product  of  Gansu  was  only  55%  of  the  national \naverage. The Project will support the Government\u2019s strategy by \nbuilding  an  important  section  of  the  national  trunk  highway \nsystem connecting the two growth centers of Lanzhou, the capital \nof Gansu province, and Xi\u2019an, the capital of Shaanxi province by \n(i) constructing an expressway across hilly to mountainous terrain \n(where the poverty incidence is high); (ii) improving local roads \nservicing  poor  counties  and  townships;  and  (iii) providing \nconsulting services and training to enhance construction quality, \nroad safety, and project monitoring and evaluation. \n   \nRationale  Despite considerable investment in the road sector to date, the \nPRC  road  network  is  still  inadequate,  and  does  not  provide \nefficient access to large parts of the country, particularly in the \npoorer inland regions, including Gansu province. Better transport \nlinks  are  necessary  to  improve  economic  efficiency,  foster \ndomestic and international trade, facilitate interregional economic \nintegration,  and  facilitate  efficient  economic  growth,  thereby \nreducing  poverty.  Western  PRC  lacks  high-class  road \ninfrastructure. The road network must therefore be developed, \nthus spreading economic and social benefits widely. To enhance \neconomic development and reduce poverty in the western region, \nthe  Government  is  implementing  the  Western  Region \nDevelopment Strategy, the key theme of the 10th Five-Year Plan  \n(2001\u20132005).  The  strategy  aims  to  reduce  development \ndisparities between the western and coastal regions. The Project \nwill support this strategy. Gansu provincial  government (GPG) \nhas identified the Project as a priority investment, which will also \ncomplement ADB\u2019s assistance in developing the Lanzhou-Xi\u2019an-\nTaiyuan section of the national trunk highway system. \n   \nObjectives  The principal objectives of the Project are to promote economic \ngrowth and thus reduce poverty in  eastern Gansu  province by \nlowering the cost of transport, relieving traffic congestion, and \nimproving  access  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  aims  to ", "iv   \nimproving  access  in  the  project  area.  The  Project  aims  to \n(i) reduce  traffic  accidents  and  vehicle  operating  costs; \n(ii) improve  access  between  Lanzhou  and  Xi\u2019an,  two  major \ngrowth  centers  in  northwestern  PRC;  (iii) provide  additional \ntransport  capacity  to  accommodate  growing  traffic;  and \n(iv) provide improved access  to markets and social services in \npoor  areas.  The  Project  will  also  support  reforms  relating  to \npoverty  reduction,  corporate  governance,  private  sector \ndevelopment, and road safety and vehicle emissions. The Project \ncomprises the following components: (i) construction of a  231-\nkilometer (km), four-lane access-controlled toll expressway from \nLuohandong to Dingxi, including access roads, interchanges with \ntoll stations, tunnels, bridges, administrative stations, and service \nareas; (ii) the upgrading of  470 km of  local roads to improve \naccess  to  remote  poor  areas,  and  of  roadside  stations; \n(iii) procurement  of  equipment  for  road  maintenance,  toll \ncollection,  surveillance  and  communications,  tunnel  operation \nfacilities,  vehicle  weigh  stations,  road  safety,  and  office \nadministration;  (iv)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement;  and \n(v) consulting services for construction supervision, road safety \naudit, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building. The key \ninputs  needed  to  implement  the  Project  include  civil  works, \nconsultants,  equipment,  and  staff  of  Gansu  Provincial \nCommunications Department (GPCD). \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies  and  interest  during  construction,  is  estimated  at \n$882 million equivalent, of which $394 million (45%) is in foreign \nexchange and $488 million equivalent (55%) is in local currency. \n   \nFinancing Plan    ($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \n    Source  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n    Asian Development Bank   300.0  0.0  300.0 \n    Ministry of Communications   0.0  195.3  195.3 \n    Gansu Provincial Government   0.0  123.3  123.3 \n    China Development Bank   94.0  169.4  263.4 \n    Total  394.0  488.0  882.0 \n%  45  55     100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A $300 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. \n \n \n ", "  v\nAllocation and  Relending  The ADB loan proceeds will be re-lent by the Borrower to GPG \nTerms  on the same financial terms and conditions as those of the ADB \nloan.  GPG  will  bear  the  interest  rate  variation  and  foreign \nexchange risks. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date   \n   \nImplementation  The project implementation unit established within GPCD will be \nArrangements  responsible for the expressway.  GPG will implement the local \nroad component through local government communications units. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Gansu Provincial Communications Department (GPCD) \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works \nfor  the  expressway  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive bidding. Civil works for local roads will be procured \nthrough local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \nOn 15 July 2004, ADB approved advance action for procurement \nof civil works for the expressway and local roads. ADB further \napproved  retroactive  financing  in  principle  in  an  amount  not \nexceeding $5 million equivalent for the local roads.  Equipment \nwill be procured through international competitive bidding. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  provide  61  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services to (i) help with project management during \nthe construction period; (ii) provide expertise in tunnel and bridge \nconstruction; (iii) conduct a safety audit of the project design, and \nmake safety recommendations on the completed construction \nworks; (iv) help set up and implement quality control procedures; \n(v) monitor the environmental impact of the Project and provide \nguidance on environmental mitigation measures as well as help \ndevelop capacity in vehicle emissions; (vi) help implement the \ncorporate development plan; (vii) assist in formulating a human \nresource  development  and  training  program;  and  (viii) help \nestablish  and  implement  a  project  performance  management \nsystem, including assessing the impact on poverty reduction. \nAbout 6,370 person-months of domestic consulting services will \nbe  required  for  construction  supervision.  The  international \nconsultants  will  be  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  and  will  be \nrecruited based on the quality- and cost-based selection method \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe domestic consultants for construction supervision will be \nfinanced  by  GPCD  and  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with \ngovernment procedures. \n   \nProject Benefits and  By  developing  an  integrated  expressway  and  complementary \nBeneficiaries  local road network, the Project will help improve access to market \nopportunities and social services for the rural poor residents in \n ", "vi   \nopportunities and social services for the rural poor residents in \nthe project area. The Project will reduce transport time and costs, \nthereby helping develop an enabling environment for investment, \ncreate employment opportunities, and enhance incomes. The \neconomic internal rate of return for the Project is estimated at \n16.6%. The financial internal rate of return for the expressway \ncomponent is  6.1%,  which  is  higher  than  the  real  weighted \naverage cost of capital. There are 1.6 million poor people, or 36% \nof the total population in the project area, living below the income \nlevels of CNY900 in rural areas and minimum living standards in \nurban areas.  The main project beneficiaries  of the local road \ncomponent will be households in poor counties and townships in \nthe project area, providers of rural transport services, industrial \nand  agricultural  businesses,  agriculture-based  households \nproducing grains and vegetables for local markets, people living \nin the project area who will have easier access to long-distance \ntransport  services,  people  visiting  historical  sites  along  the \nexpressway,  and  transport  operators  and  their  customers  for \ntransit traffic. The Project will also help reduce traffic accidents, \nvehicle emissions, and traffic noise on the existing roads. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project was formulated to keep to a minimum the potential \ntechnical, safety, economic, financial, and resettlement risks. The \nmain technical risks, which could result in implementation delays \nand cost overruns, are associated with  the tunnel and bridge \nstructures.  To  mitigate  the  risks,  international  consultants \nreviewed  the  proposed  design  and  construction  methods. \nPrequalification  of  contractors  focuses  on  their  financial  and \ntechnical  capability  in  handling  complex  works.  During \nconstruction, monitoring and contract management information \nsystems will be set up and implemented, with the assistance of \nthe international consultants, for timely identification of technical \nproblems and implementation of corrective measures. Given the \nsafety hazards associated with bridge works, the contractors will \nbe required to strictly enforce working safety rules and measures. \nGPCD  has  proven  experience  and  has  shown  satisfactory \nperformance in implementing internationally financed projects. \n   \n  Economic performance in the project-influenced area would have \nto  deteriorate  substantially  for  the  Project  to  lose  economic \nviability.  The  financial  risks  associated  with  construction  and \noperation  of  the  expressway  will  depend  on  the  actual \nconstruction costs, ability of the commercial management, and \nappropriate  tolls.  To  mitigate  the  financial  risks,  the  Gansu \nLuoding  Expressway  Company  will  build  up  a  commercial \nbusiness  environment  for  expressway  operations,  the  project \nexpressway will receive substantial equity from the central and \nprovincial governments, and an appropriate toll structure will be \nadopted. Appropriate coordination and monitoring mechanisms \nwill be put in place to mitigate resettlement risks. \n \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation (RRP) on a proposed \nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Gansu Roads Development Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The PRC\u2019s economic growth since the 1980s has substantially increased the demand for \ntransport services. The economy\u2019s changing structure and increasing diversification have altered \nthe pattern of transport demand. The demand for road transport  has outpaced that of other \ntransport modes. There is a rapidly increasing  movement of goods and passengers by road, \nwhich is more flexible and responsive than other modes to the needs of a market economy. The \nshift in transport demand also reflects the loosening of anticompetitive restrictions in the road \ntransport industry itself. Between 1990 and 2003, road traffic grew by 9.6% per annum (p.a.) for \npassenger traffic, reaching 769.6 billion passenger\u2013kilometers (km); and by 5.7% p.a. for freight, \nreaching 708 billion ton\u2013km. In 2003, road traffic accounted for 55.7% of the country\u2019s total \npassenger traffic and 13.2% of the total freight traffic. With the country\u2019s rapid economic growth, \nlow vehicle ownership rates, lower automobile prices after World Trade Organization accession, \nincreasing access to loans to finance automobile purchases, and large investment in automotive \nmanufacturing, the rapid expansion in the vehicle fleet will continue in the coming years. \n \n3.  To meet the growing demand for mi proved transport infrastructure and services, the \nGovernment\u2019s policy for the road sector, as reflected in its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005), calls \nfor (i) accelerating the construction of the network of highways and national roads, with a focus on \nfive north-south and seven east-west sections of the national trunk highway system; (ii) starting \nconstruction of eight new highways in the western region (total 18,000 km); and (iii) by 2005, \nhaving approximately 1.95 million km of highways open to traffic, with expressways1 accounting \nfor 35,000 km. In 2003, the Government announced plans for 5,300 rural road projects with a \ntotal length of 78,000 km. A total of 176,000 km of rural roads was slated for construction in the \nfollowing 3 years, with an investment of CNY50 billion provided by the central Government. \nCurrently, 184 towns and 54,000 villages, most of which are in the western region, have no \naccess to roads. The plan is to develop a road network that will reach 99.8% of towns and 96.0% \nof villages by 2005. By the end of 2010, all towns and villages will be connected to roads. This \nmajor program will be a pro-poor initiative since in many surveys the poor ranked improved roads \nas one of their  high  infrastructure development priorities. The Government\u2019s  commitment to \nreducing poverty through transport infrastructure investment is reflected in the poverty partnership \nagreement between the Government and ADB. The project framework  summarizing the main \nfeatures of the proposed Project is in Appendix 1. \n \n4.  The significant road sector development during the 9th Five-Year Plan (1996\u20132000) \nresulted in road investments totaling CNY924 billion, or CNY185 billion per year. The road sector \ninvestment grew at an average annual rate of 16% during this period. During the 10th Five-Year \nPlan, the total investment is expected to reach about CNY1,800 billion, almost double that in the \nprevious 5 years. A road sector  analysis is given in Appendix 2. In Gansu province, Gansu \nProvincial Communications Department (GPCD) invested about CNY4.9 billion in the road sector \n                                                                 \n1  The People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC\u2019s) expressway length reached 29,745 km in 2003, the second longest in the \nworld after the United States. ", "2  \nin 2003, of which 65% was allocated to construction and 9% to maintenance. During the 10th \nFive-Year Plan, road investment is expected to be about CNY24 billion. GPCD plans to increase \nthe road investment to CNY44 billion during the 11th Five-Year Plan. Road sector revenues and \nexpenditures in Gansu province are given in Appendix 3. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  Gansu province is one of the PRC\u2019s five northwestern provinces. Remote and isolated \nwith harsh natural conditions, it is one of the least developed provinces.  The key problem in \nGansu province is poverty: the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of the province in 2003 \nwas CNY4,984, only 55% of the national average of CNY9,057.  Per capita rural income was \nCNY1,673, or 64% of the national average of CNY2,622. There are 1.6 million poor people in the \nproject area, equivalent to 36% of the total population, living below the income levels of CNY900 \nin rural areas and the minimum living standards in urban  areas. One of the reasons for high \npoverty incidence is slow economic growth, partly because of inadequate infrastructure. Despite \nthe considerable investments, the road network is still inadequate, and does not provide efficient \ntransport access to markets and social services, such as education and health.  \n \n6.  The impact of road investments on poverty reduction is supported by the results of studies \nand evaluations of several completed road projects financed by ADB2 and the World Bank.3 Well-\nintegrated road development helps ensure that the benefits derived from the expressway filter \ndown to the poor. These results affirm the relevance of ADB\u2019s strategy in the road sector (paras. \n8\u20139). A technical assistance (TA)4 will help the Government formulate a road network strategy \nthat promotes better integration of expressways and local roads to meet communities\u2019 needs and \nsupport economic growth, and that provides road agencies with cross-disciplinary skills and tools \nthrough capacity building. A case study in Shaanxi  province found that improved roads were \ncorrelated with poverty reduction.5 Benefits for rural poor areas include lower transport costs; \nlower cost of inputs; expanded agricultural support services; improved farming practices; greater \naccess to employment opportunities in urban areas; and better access to health, education, and \nsocial services.6  \n \n7.  To help the Government develop its road sector strategy and investment projects, external \nassistance has been provided mainly from ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), \nand World Bank (Appendix 4). Since 1991, ADB has provided 29 loans, totaling nearly $5.3 \nbillion, to finance about 3,900 km of road development, together with 7,100 km of associated local \nroad networks. Since 1995, local roads have been included in the scope of road projects to make \n                                                                 \n2  In Liaoning and Yunnan provinces, construction of expressways complemented by  upgrading local roads was \nassociated with a significant increase in rural incomes in the project area.

Of the  ADB-financed projects, 18 have \nbeen completed and are open to traffic. ADB has also provided 50 TAs, totaling $26.9 million, to \nthe road sector. The advisory TAs have addressed poverty impact of road projects, policy and \ninstitutional issues, including highway planning, road safety,7 human resources development, \ntransport pricing, commercialization and corporatization, and the mobilization of private financial \nresources.  The  World  Bank  and  JBIC  have  provided  about  $6.1  billion  and  \u00a5111  billion \nrespectively to finance road investments. ADB coordinates with the World Bank and JBIC. Each \nmajor development partner focuses on different corridors, while information related to policy \nadvice is shared across the development community. \n \nC.  Policy Dialogue \n \n8.  Targeting Poor Beneficiaries. Since 1995, complementary local road improvement has \nbeen integrated into the  design of road projects to improve access to markets and social  \nservices.8 The integrated approach will help  target the poor in terms of bringing them benefits. \nBetter integration of the local roads into the trunk highway system will help rural agricultural \nproduce reach markets. As reliable transport to markets becomes more readily available, cash \ncrop farming in remote areas is stimulated and the access to off-farm employment opportunities is \nbroadened. \n \n9.  Five sections of the local roads of 470 km were selected as part of the broadly defined \nProject, on the basis of population density, poverty incidence, and road network efficiency from \nthe Gansu Provincial Rural Road Development Plan for 2001\u20132010. The Project will upgrade the \nroads from Class IV to III, costing about $53 million, of which $10 million from the ADB loan will \nhelp finance the two road sections: Guochengyi-Houjiachuan (118 km) and Dingxi-Longxi (80 km). \nThis will complement the expressway component in benefiting about 1.6 million poor people living \nin the project area. This component will  (i) be implemented concurrently with the expressway \ncomponent and will be maintained by the county governments under the guidance of GPCD,9 \n(ii) use the Ministry of Communications (MOC) technical designs and standards, (iii) follow the \nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB, and (iv) be monitored and evaluated to \nensure that their poverty impacts are enhanced.10 \n \n10.  Corporate  Governance.  GPCD  currently  manages  expressway  construction  and \noperations. Based on ADB\u2019s experience in the road sector,11 separation of expressway operations \nfrom the government functions will promote corporate governance. GPCD has agreed to establish \na corporation, by 31 December 2007, tentatively called the Gansu Luoding Expressway Company \n(GLEC). GLEC will be responsible for operating and managing the project expressway. At least 1 \nyear before commencement of operations, the project expressway will be transferred to GLEC, \n                                                                 \n7  In January 2001, ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department completed a performance audit report on traffic safety TAs. \nThe two road safety TAs involving the PRC were rated highly successful. \n8  Since 1995, the scope of the 17 ADB-financed road projects has been expanded to enhance their impacts on poverty \nreduction by integrating local road improvements to improve the accessibility of poor communities. The local road \ncomponents of these projects are being implemented or have been completed successfully, helping improve living \nstandards of the poor people in the project area. \n9  They have sufficient capacity and financing for maintenance works. The road maintenance expenditures in Gansu \nprovince were CNY479 million in 2003 and this is expected to increase in the next 5 years by 4\u20135% annually. \n10 While improving infrastructure is important, competition in providing road transport services is also important to \nensure that some of the savings in transport costs are passed onto local farmers through reduced tariff. \n11 ADB has been involved with road projects in 14 provinces since 1992, and corporatization has been implemented in \nmost of the provinces by separating expressway construction and operations from the provincial government. The \nexperience is generally positive in improving corporate governance. \n ", "4  \nwhich  will  be  entitled  to  collect  and  retain  tolls  and  will  repay  the  proposed  loan for the \nexpressway.  Details  of  the  creation  of  GLEC  and  the  transfer  of  assets  and  debt  service \nobligations from GPCD to GLEC, including GLEC\u2019s financial statements for the Project, will be \nsubmitted for ADB\u2019s approval 6 months prior to establishment of GLEC. GPCD and GLEC will \nenter into a concession framework agreement (outlined in Appendix 5 with the full agreement in \nSupplementary Appendix A) by 30 June 2008 to ensure autonomy of operations, encourage the \nestablishment of road performance indicators, and facilitate future refinancing of road sector \nassets. GLEC will implement a corporate development plan (also outlined in Appendix 5 with the \nfull  plan  in Supplementary  Appendix A) by 31 December 2008 to  assure high standards of \ncorporate governance, management practices, and financial reporting. These agreements and \nplans  will  be  implemented  with  the  help  of  the  loan-financed  consultants  during  project \nimplementation. The model documents needed for such process were developed under ADB- \nfinanced TA12 and are available from a web site.13 To help with the process of corporatization, \ntraining will be provided under the loan to the staff of GPCD and GLEC. \n \n11.  Private Sector Development. In line with ADB\u2019s Private Sector Development Strategy,14 \nconsideration was given to various approaches to highway financing recommended under an \nADB-financed  TA, 15 including  securitization.16 The  potential  for  pursuing  these  options  for \nfinancing the project expressway were examined. Capacity to attract private financing, particularly \nequity capital, for road projects such as the project expressway with low initial demand and low \nfinancial returns, but with high long-term economic returns, is limited. Therefore, the construction \nof the Project will be financed from public sources. Private sector  financing options will be \nexamined before operations start. ADB will favorably consider such refinancing for the Project, \nprovided that advance notice si received and the proposal meets ADB\u2019s standards of good \ngovernance, transparency, and project viability. GPCD is pursuing private sector participation in \ndeveloping the road sector, and has offered three existing highways for lease concessions with a \ntotal length of 330 km, costing about CNY7.5 billion. An overview of private sector involvement in \nthe PRC road sector is given in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n12.  Road Safety and Vehicle Emissions. Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC, and in \nGansu province. In 2003, there were 667,507 accidents, involving 104,372 fatalities and 494,174 \ninjuries in the PRC. This is equivalent to a fatality rate of 43 deaths per 10,000 vehicles, which is \nvery high by international standards.17 Gansu province had  13,403 accidents,  involving 1,837 \nfatalities and 7,833 injuries. The Ministry of Public Security, which is responsible for enforcement \nof traffic laws and regulations, is committed to reducing accidents  through improved safety of \nvehicles, driver training, and improved traffic management. The road traffic safety law was made \neffective in May 2004. ADB maintains a dialogue with the Ministry, based on the findings of the  \n \n                                                                 \n12 ADB. 1997.

The main findings of the TA were disseminated to the public through The New Frontier\u2014Investing in Toll \nRoads, published by  ADB and the State Development Planning Commission (2003, Manila). The TA was rated \nsuccessful in the TA completion report. \n13 Available: http://www.chineseinfrastructure.com. \n14 ADB. 2003.

Under the two projects, the expressways' future toll revenue was securitized through \nan initial public offering in August 1999 and January 1999, respectively. \n17 Comparative figures for other countries in deaths per 10,000 vehicles are 26.5 for India, 11.8 for Indonesia, 8.5 for \nThailand, 2.3 for Australia, and 1.9 for Japan. \n ", "  5\ncompleted TA,18 and will strengthen its involvement through a planned TA for improving road \nsafety. Also in May 2004, an interministerial committee, coordinated by MOC, involving seven \nministries,19 was established to develop and implement special measures to enforce regulations \nnationwide on overloaded trucks. In Gansu province, this program is being implemented by an \ninterdepartmental task force under the governor. Road safety issues are being addressed through \n(i) setting up an accident prevention division in the Gansu Public Security Bureau to analyze \naccident data to help draw up prevention measures; (ii) strengthening driver training and police \npatrols on the roads to enforce traffic laws and regulations; and (iii) promoting a road safety \ncampaign, including the use of seat belts and infant seats and warning against intoxicated and \ndangerous driving, using pamphlets, posters, and other communications means. To address road \nsafety  issues,  the  Project  will  include  the  following  measures:  (i) vehicle  weighing  stations; \n(ii) road safety training for staff of GPCD; (iii) safety audit during design and construction; and \n(iv) public awareness campaigns and signage, promoting road safety and accident prevention. \nThese will be carried out with the assistance of a road safety specialist financed under the loan \n(Appendix 6). \n \n13.  With a rapid increase in vehicle ownership, vehicle emissions have become a serious \nissue in the PRC. They will have an adverse impact on the environment if mitigation measures \nare  not  taken.  Fragmented  responsibility,  lack  of  interdepartmental  coordination,  and  an \ninadequate database and monitoring system prevent the formulation of specific targets for a \nreduction in vehicle emissions. Gansu provincial government (GPG) has an annual program for \ntesting vehicle emissions. Roadside testing is  also carried out  along the major national and \nprovincial roads. To address the motor vehicle emissions  issue, international consultants will \nprovide training to staff of the environmental protection bureau involved with vehicle emissions \ninspection and testing in light of the  findings of the ADB-financed TA20 on vehicle emissions \n(Appendix 6). \n \nD.   Lessons Learned \n \n14.  GPCD has experience in preparing and implementing three internationally financed road \nprojects.21 These projects were prepared well and are being implemented or operated without \nmajor problems. The relevant safeguard policies have been met.  Performance reviews22 of \ncompleted ADB-financed road  projects elsewhere in the PRC indicate  that, in general, the \nprojects have been  or are being  implemented to meet development objectives of facilitating \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  as  originally  envisaged  during  project  preparation. \nCompleted projects show that (i) ADB\u2019s safeguard policies were met; (ii) loan covenants were \ngenerally complied with; (iii) poverty reduction impact is evident as people\u2019s living standards have \n                                                                 \n18 ADB. 1999.

The main findings of this TA, including training materials, are available in the road safety \nsection of ADB\u2019s web site, available: http://www.adb.org/Projects/PRCRoadSafety/introduction.asp. The TA was \nrated highly successful in the TA completion report. \n19 These are Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Public Security, National Development and Reform Commission, \nNational Quality  Control Bureau, National Safety Bureau, National Industry and Commerce Bureau, and State \nCouncil\u2019s Law and Regulations Office. \n20 ADB. 2000.

These projects have shown positive cash flow at the beginning of operations based on \nthe strong initial traffic build up. The ongoing Liuzhaike-Baiyin expressway is financed by the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation. \n22 ADB. 2001. PRC Procurement Review 2001 and PRC Portfolio Performance Review in the Road Sector. Manila.  \n ", "6  \nbeen improved through better access to markets, jobs, and social services; (iv) operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  of  ADB-financed  roads  were  generally  satisfactory  as  reported  in  an \nevaluation report;23 (v) corporatization was an effective option to strengthen corporate governance \nand to raise funds for future road development in Hunan and Jilin provinces; and (vi) recent \nprojects helped raise awareness among policy makers of the importance of addressing key sector  \nissues on road safety and vehicle emissions. Project completion reports (PCRs) prepared for 10 \nroad projects concluded that nine of them24 were highly or generally successful, and one25 was \npartly successful. The project performance audit reports (PPARs) for four road projects26 rated the \nprojects as either highly successful or successful. The lessons learned from previous ADB-\nfinanced road projects are reflected in the project design.  A development impact study27 of the \n1,867 km Beijing-Tongjiang expressway route, for which ADB provided loans totaling $1.2 billion, \nshowed that the improved road network significantly contributed to the development of the \nnortheastern part of the PRC. Some lessons from these projects have been brought to the \nattention  of  GPCD,  particularly  with  reference  to  implementation-related  matters.  To avoid \ndelayed loan effectiveness due to delays in the procurement process, a tendering company has \nbeen  recruited  to  prequalify  the  civil  works  contractors.  ADB\u2019s  procurement  guidelines  and \nrequirements were discussed extensively during  missions. Emphasis was put on the need to \n(i) strictly  follow  ADB\u2019s  mandatory  bidding  documents,  (ii) evaluate  bids  according  to  ADB-\napproved evaluation criteria, and (iii) substantiate clearly the conclusions of the bid evaluation.  \n \nE.  Rationale \n \n15.  ADB's operational strategy28 in the road sector supports (i) construction of roads that \nconnect major growth centers and promote linkages with hinterland economies; (ii) integration of \nthe network so that the national trunk highway system is supported by a system of local roads, \nparticularly those that provide access to poor areas; (iii) promotion of road safety and vehicle \nemission reduction; (iv) institutional strengthening to increase the commercial orientation and \nefficiency of expressway organizations; (v) improvement of highway planning and evaluation \ntechniques; (vi) adoption of appropriate pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport \ncapacity; and (vii) use of alternative methods  of investment financing, including private sector \nparticipation. ADB is targeting its assistance in the road sector to the less developed central and \nwestern provinces where the majority of the poor live. The proposed Project is consistent with the \nPRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s strategy. \n                                                                 \n23 ADB. 1998.

This lower rating is mainly due to \ninadequate safety facilities and enforcement, as well as partial compliance with environmental mitigation measures. \nRemedial actions were subsequently taken by rectifying the infrastructure deficiencies, enforcing harsher penalties \nfor traffic violations, and implementing the environmental mitigation measures. As a result, the project was rated \nsuccessful by the project performance audit report (PPAR) (footnote 26). \n26 ADB. 1999. PPAR on the Shanghai Nanpu Bridge Project in the PRC. Manila; ADB. 2000.

Despite the considerable investments in the road sector, the PRC road network is still \ninadequate,  and  does  not  provide  efficient  transport  access  to  large  parts  of  the  country, \nparticularly in the poorer inland regions, including Gansu province. Transport and logistics costs \nin the western region are high. Western PRC lacks high-class road infrastructure in and out of the \nregion, and between and within provinces in the region. The road network must be developed to \nlower  transport  costs  and  facilitate  sustainable  economic  development.  The  Government  is \nimplementing the Western  Region Development Strategy, which is the key theme of the 10th \nFive-Year Plan. The strategy aims to reduce development disparities between the western region \nand the coastal region. The Project will support this strategy, and will connect the two growth \ncenters of Lanzhou and Xi\u2019an. GPG has identified the Project as a priority investment, which will \nalso complement ADB\u2019s assistance in developing the Lanzhou-Xi\u2019an-Taiyuan section of the \nnational trunk highway system.29 \n \n17.  During the 2004 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request \nfor ADB assistance for the Project.30 A feasibility study was completed by GPCD in May 2003. An \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) was prepared in July 2004, and a resettlement plan in \nSeptember 2004. ADB provided TA31 to supplement the government studies. A final TA tripartite \nmeeting-cum-loan fact finding for the Project was held from 21 June to 2 July 2004. The Project \nwas formulated on the basis of the findings of ADB missions, information provided by the \nGovernment,  stakeholder  consultations,  discussions  with  other  funding  agencies,  and \nrecommendations of the feasibility study and TA consultants. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n18.  The principal objectives of the Project are to promote economic growth and reduce \npoverty in eastern Gansu province by lowering the cost of transport, relieving traffic congestion, \nand improving access in the project area. The Project aims to (i) reduce traffic accidents and \nvehicle operating costs, (ii) improve access between  Lanzhou  and  Xi\u2019an, two major  growth \ncenters in northwestern PRC, (iii) provide additional transport capacity to accommodate growing \ntraffic, and (iv) provide improved access to markets and social services in poor areas. The Project \nwill also support reforms relating to poverty reduction,  corporate governance, private sector \ndevelopment, and road safety and vehicle emissions. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n19.  The Project has the following components: (i) construction of a 231 km, four-lane access- \n \n                                                                 \n29 The Lanzhou-Xi\u2019an-Taiyuan section is a priority section of the national trunk highway system for ADB assistance, \nwhich  includes  the  Shanxi  Road  Development  Project  (Qixian-Linfen),  approved  in  1999;  Shaanxi  Roads \nDevelopment Project (Yanliang-Yumenkou), approved in 2001; Shanxi Roads Development II Project (Yumenkou-\nHouma), approved in 2002; and Xi\u2019an Urban Transport Project, approved in 2003. These loans total $895 million. \n30 The Project has been processed as a pilot test designated by the Strategy Working Group on Infrastructure and \nUtility Finance Initiative with the objective of achieving improved processing efficiency, greater responsiveness to the \nGovernment\u2019s  needs,  and  better  cost-effectiveness  while  ensuring  project  quality  and  safeguarding  policy \ncompliance. \n31 ADB. 2003.

Manila.  \n ", "8  \ncontrolled toll expressway from  Luohandong to  Dingxi,32 including access roads, interchanges \nwith toll stations, tunnels, bridges, administrative stations, and service areas; (ii) the upgrading of \n470 km  of  local  roads  to  improve  access  to  remote  poor  areas,  and  of  roadside  stations; \n(iii) procurement  of  equipment  for  road  maintenance,  toll  collection,  surveillance  and \ncommunications,  tunnel  operation  facilities,  vehicle  weigh  stations,  road  safety,  and  office \nadministration; (iv) land acquisition and resettlement; and (v) consulting services for construction \nsupervision, road safety audit, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building. The key inputs \nneeded to implement the Project include civil works, consultants, equipment, and staff of GPCD. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n20.  Roadside Stations. Road projects have traditionally focused on expanding transport \ncapacity to maximize economic impact. To contribute to achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals through transport development, innovative approaches are needed to enhance multisector \nand multipurpose dimensions of infrastructure investment. The Project will introduce roadside \nstations33 to facilitate community development along the Project local roads by linking roads with \ncommunity activities and to provide a conducive environment for safe driving for road users. \nRoadside stations normally provide parking areas and ancillary facilities, such as bus terminals, \ngasoline stations, information centers about roads, road safety, tourism, and HIV/AIDS, local \nspecialty markets, restaurants, and agro-processing facilities. Details of facilities will be firmed up \nduring project implementation. The Project will develop four roadside stations along the project \nlocal roads. \n \n21.  Transport  Services.  To  enhance  the  benefit  flow  to  local  communities  through \ninfrastructure improvement, efficient and safe transport services should be widely available in the \nproject area. Current constraints and opportunities were reviewed under the TA. The main \nfindings are provided in Appendix 7. One of the issues relates to the nonavailability of bus stops \non the expressways. As the interprovincial expressway system is developed, long-distance public \ntransport  services  are  becoming  available.  However,  bus  stops  are  unavailable  on  the \nexpressways primarily for safety reasons, given that expressways are access controlled. MOC\u2019s \nnew highway design standards, effective 1 March 2004, provide for installing bus stops. During \nproject implementation, GPCD will review the possibility of providing bus stops on the project \nexpressway in consultation with bus operators, keeping in view the safety issues. Other issues \ninclude a lack of competition in the transport services market, and regulations on tariffs and \nroutes for bus and trucking services. MOC is addressing these aspects of road transport, with \nassistance from a recently approved TA,34 which aims to develop a road transport policy reform \naction plan by reviewing the policy and regulatory framework in the road transport industry and \nfactors affecting efficiency and safety of the industry. \n                                                                 \n32 The project expressway is divided into two parts by the section in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which is not part \nof the Project for reasons of administrative jurisdiction. The eastern part of this section (37 km) is being implemented \nby an ADB-financed Ningxia Roads Development Project, approved in 2003, while the western part (30 km) will be \nconstructed in accordance with the same technical standards as those of the project expressway by the Ningxia \nCommunications Department during 2007\u20132009. \n33 The concept of roadside stations was developed in Japan to link the road users and communities, thereby facilitating \nlocal economic development. They are different from ordinary service areas provided along the roads because \n(i) they are designed through the involvement of local communities, (ii) they provide links between road users and \nlocal communities, (iii) they provide business opportunities for local people, and (iv) they can possibly provide public \nservices, including health care, education, and cultural activities in addition to the normal restaurant and commercial \nservices. This experience was replicated in Thailand with assistance from JBIC and is being pilot tested in the PRC \n(Anhui, Gansu, and Hunan provinces) as well as Kenya with assistance from the World Bank and JBIC. Guidelines \nfor Roadside Stations have been prepared by the World Bank, and will be used by GPCD as a guide. \n34 ADB. 2004.

During the feasibility study, EIA and resettlement planning, \nconsultations were conducted with representatives of local government agencies, civil society, \nand affected people to discuss project alternatives, environmental concerns, land acquisition and \nresettlement issues, and economic development potential. The findings of the consultations are \navailable  in  Appendix 8. During TA (footnote 31) implementation, about 6,700 people were \ninterviewed in public opinion surveys, social assessments, and for resettlement planning, which \nhelped raise the level of awareness and gain local support. These processes enabled local \nstakeholders to express their opinions and to make relevant suggestions for project design and \nimplementation.  Consultations  with  the  rural  poor,  women,  minority  population,  and  other \nvulnerable groups were carried out during the socioeconomic survey on project impact and during \nlocal road selection. The participatory activities are an ongoing process that will continue during \nproject implementation. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n23.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $882 million, with a foreign exchange cost of \n$394 million (45%) and a local currency cost of $488 million (55%) (Appendix 9). The total costs \ninclude  physical  contingencies,  price  contingencies,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n        Foreign     Local     Total   \n   Item  Exchange     Currency     Cost   \n A.

Financing Plan \n \n24.  The Government has requested a $300 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nto help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan  and Project Agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. A \nfinancing plan for the Project is in Table 2. \n ", "10   \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n Item  Foreign    Local      Total  % \n    Exchange   Currency   Cost    \nAsian Development Bank  300.0    0.0    300.0     34 \nMinistry of Communications  0.0    195.3    195.3     22 \nGansu Provincial Government  0.0    123.3    123.3     14 \nChina Development Bank    94.0    169.4    263.4    30 \n   Total  394.0    488.0    882.0   100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n25.  The loan will finance about 76% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project and 34% of \nthe total project cost. The remaining foreign exchange cost will be financed by the China \nDevelopment Bank. The local currency cost will be financed by  MOC, GPG,  and cofinancing \nthrough a loan from the China Development Bank, which has appraised the Project. This loan is \nrepayable over 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and at a variable lending rate, \ncurrently 5.76% per annum. The ADB loan proceeds will be made available to GPG on the same \nfinancial terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  Project  Management.  GPCD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation of the Project.  GPG will implement the local road component through local \ngovernments. The project director will be responsible for overall project management, approval of \ncontracts, and payments. A project implementation unit, which has been established within GPCD, \nwill monitor and follow up implementation. The unit is headed by a project manager responsible \nfor physical implementation activities on a day-to-day basis and the preparation of progress \nreports. GPCD has sufficient technical capability to handle the Project as its engineers have \nexperience in implementing internationally financed road projects.  The financial management \nassessment  of  GPCD  shows  that  the  Project  will  have  in  place  an  adequate  financial \nmanagement system. The  financial management assessment questionnaire as completed  is \navailable in  Supplementary Appendix C.  After GLEC is established, the project facilities and \nGPCD\u2019s responsibilities for day-to-day operations for the Project will be transferred from GPCD to \nGLEC. Organization charts for GPCD and GLEC are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n27.  Period of Implementation. The Project will be implemented over about 5 years starting \nwith preconstruction activities in early 2005 and completion in December 2009 (Appendix 10). \n \n28.  Procurement. All ADB-financed procurement will be carried out in accordance with the \nADB Guidelines for Procurement. The civil works for the expressway will be divided into  16 \npackages to be procured through international competitive bidding. Four equipment packages will \nbe procured through  international competitive bidding. Under government financing, the traffic \nengineering facilities and the telecommunications, monitoring, and toll-collection facilities will be \nprocured through local competitive bidding.  Ancillary buildings and facilities will be  procured \nthrough domestic financing in four packages  through local competitive bidding. For the local \nroads component, 10 ADB-financed packages will be procured through local competitive bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB (Appendix 11). International bidding will be handled by a tendering \ncompany that is well qualified to perform these tasks.  \n \n29.  Consulting Services. Construction supervision activities, involving 6,370 person-months \nof consulting services, will be undertaken by domestic consulting teams under government \n ", "  11 \nfinancing, headed by a chief supervision engineer. Besides construction supervision, domestic \nconsultants for a project performance management system, including the monitoring of the social \ndevelopment action plan, will be engaged. \n \n30.  The Project will provide 61 person-months of international consulting services to (i) help \nwith project management during the construction period; (ii) provide expertise in tunnel and \nbridge  construction;  (iii) conduct  a  safety  audit  of  the  project  design,  and  make  safety \nrecommendations on the completed construction works; (iv) help set up and implement quality \ncontrol procedures; (v) monitor the environmental impact of the project and provide guidance on \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  as  well  as  help  develop  capacity  in  vehicle  emissions; \n(vi) help implement the corporate development plan; (vii) assist in formulating a human resource \ndevelopment and training program; and (viii) help establish and implement a project performance \nmanagement system. The team leader will be in the field during the construction period and will \nact as assistant chief supervision engineer, (i) helping the chief supervision engineer certify \nvariation orders, contractor\u2019s monthly payments, and subcontracting documents; and (ii) helping \nestablish a contracts management system. All consultants to be financed under the ADB loan will \nbe selected and engaged based on the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of reference for consultants are \nin Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n31.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing. Given the high priority accorded to the \nProject and the need to commence works in July 2005, ADB approved on 15 July 2004 advance \nprocurement  action  for  civil  works.35 While  advance  action  for  the  expressway  covers  the \nprequalification of contractors, bidding, and bid evaluation, but will not include contract awards, \nadvance action for local roads covers up to contract awards. The advance action  is being \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. ADB also approved retroactive \nfinancing in principle to cover expenditures incurred within 12 months prior to loan effectiveness \nand not earlier than 21 June 2004 on the civil works for the local road component in the amount \nnot exceeding $5 million. The Government has been advised that approval of the advance action \nand retroactive financing in principle does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n32.  Disbursement Arrangements. All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Since most payments will be made for \nlarge contracts well above $100,000, direct payment and commitment procedures will be used to \nwithdraw the loan funds. If the government funds are used first for eligible expenditures, ADB's \nreimbursement procedure will be used. Statement of expenditures will be applied to reimburse \neligible expenditures for any individual payment not exceeding $200,000 to expedite fund flows. \n \n33.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. GPCD will maintain separate accounts for the \nProject and related financial statements and will have them audited annually in accordance with \nappropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied  by  independent  auditors,  whose \nqualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable to ADB. GPCD will submit to \nADB within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal year, certified copies of audited project \naccounts and financial statements and an auditor\u2019s report  on the Project, all in the English \nlanguage. A separate audit opinion on the use of the statement of expenditures, if any, will be \nincluded as part of the auditor\u2019s report. During project implementation, GPCD will submit quarterly \n                                                                 \n35 Advance action and retroactive financing were  reported in the July 2004 Internet edition of  ADB Business \nOpportunities. \n ", "12   \nprogress reports. To facilitate project postevaluation, GPCD will furnish to ADB a completion \nreport within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n34.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. To demonstrate the development \neffectiveness of its operation and to be accountable for its performance to stakeholders, ADB \nuses the project performance management system,36 which is a coherent and results-based \napproach to monitoring and evaluating implementation performance and development impact at \nvarious stages of the project cycle. For this purpose, a set of indicators for evaluating project \nperformance in relation to the project goals, purposes, outputs, and conditions has been agreed \nwith GPCD. The indicators were selected on the basis of the findings of an ADB-financed TA for \nSocioeconomic Impact of Road Projects, which confirmed the contribution of road investments to \neconomic growth and poverty reduction in the PRC as well as the validity of the geographic focus \nof the road portfolio on the poorer western region.37 The results also showed that complementary \ninvestments in local roads strengthen the impact of expressway investments. These indicators will \nbe refined at the start of project implementation and may include (i) economic development and \npoverty indicators for the project area, (ii) industrial and agricultural outputs, (iii) transport costs \nand  time,  (iv) transport  services  and  transport  charges,  (v) accident  rates,  (vi) financial \nsustainability, (vii) level of social services, including school enrollment and infant mortality,  and \n(viii) jobs created in construction and maintenance. Employment impact indicators will include \ninformation about unskilled laborers, poor laborers, and women laborers, and will be monitored \nthrough an annual report. At the beginning of project implementation,  GPCD will establish a \nbaseline  and  target  values  for  the  indicators.  The  indicators  will  be  measured  at  project \ncompletion and 3 years later, and will be compared with the baseline, and a report summarizing \nthe key findings will be submitted to ADB. A full-time staff member of GPCD will be designated to \nundertake monitoring and evaluation with the consultants. \n \n35.  Project Review. In 2007, GPCD and ADB will carry out a midterm review of the Project, \ncovering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty \nreduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact \non the performance of the Project and its continuing viability.  \n \n36.  Anticorruption  Measures. The Government has made significant efforts to  address \ncorruption in the road sector. To date, 15 government officials from 10 provincial communications \ndepartments38 have  been  found  to  be  involved  in  corruption.  Information  related  to  these \ncorruption cases is in the public domain. There is no evidence that any of the reported corruption \nwas related to ADB-financed road projects. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy \nwas explained to central and local government officials. Attention was drawn to the section on \nfraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants to \nobserve the highest standards of ethics in the procurement and execution of ADB-financed \n                                                                 \n36 A review of the project performance management system was undertaken by the Operations Evaluation Department \nin 2003 and its findings and recommendations are available in ADB. 2003. Special Evaluation Study on Project \nPerformance Management in the Asian Development Bank and its Projects in Development Member Countries. \nManila. Based on the findings of this report, a Project Performance Management System (PPMS) Action Plan was \nissued for implementation during 2004\u20132005. The PPMS comprises five components: project framework (Appendix \n1), project performance report, government monitoring and evaluation, project completion report, and project \nperformance audit report. \n37 An  ADB-assisted TA for Developing a Poverty Monitoring System at County Level is  assisting rural survey \norganizations to develop a county poverty monitoring system that provides timely, relevant, and high-quality \ninformation useful for poverty-related analysis of ADB-financed transport projects. \n38 Namely, Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu,  Sichuan,  Xinjiang, and Yunnan. \n ", "  13 \ncontracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. ADB's program for the PRC \nincludes assistance to the Government that will improve governance and provide incentives to \nreduce the incidence of corruption in the longer term. Based on the recommendations of the July \n2004  PRC  Country  Performance  Portfolio  Mission,  a  seminar  on  how  to  detect  fraud  and \ncorruption during procurement will be organized by ADB in 2005. \n \n37.  Based on GPCD\u2019s experience in fighting corruption, the following actions have been taken \nto prevent corruption:  (i) officials from the Discipline  and Inspection Bureau  will be resident in \nproject  offices  for  bidding,  construction,  and  operations;  (ii) an  internal  audit  unit  will  be \nestablished in the Project Company; (iii) a two-contract system has been established where the \nwinner of a civil works contract must also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; \n(iv) liaison meetings between  GPCD and the Prosecutor's Office are held on a regular basis \nwhere warnings about or information on corrupt practices can be discussed; and (v) periodic \ninspections of contractors have been instituted to ensure procedures related to fund withdrawals \nand settlements are being followed. \n \n38.  Capacity  Building.  To  cope  with  its  increased  road  construction  and  management \nactivities, GPCD needs to develop its capacity to manage sector development and expressway \noperations effectively and efficiently. A human resource development plan will be drawn up with \nthe help of the international consultants. The plan will consider the needs, and the recruitment \nand  training  requirements  identified.  It  will  cover  expressway  operations,  commercial \ndevelopment of expressways and business planning, expressway maintenance, road safety, \nvehicle  emissions,  project  management,  highway  development  planning,  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  environmental  management,  bridge  and  tunnel  design,  traffic  engineering,  toll \nmanagement, and pavement design. In addition,  GPCD staff will undertake about  34 person-\nmonths of international training. With the assistance of the international consultants, GPCD will \nprepare a program of training activities, including the location and a list of participants. Findings \nfrom the training will be disseminated in Gansu province through an appropriate institute. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n \n39.  The traffic volume on the existing roads in the project area has been increasing at about \n9% per annum in the last 5 years, reaching about 3,300 vehicles per day in 2002. The roads are \nalready at capacity in certain sections. If the new road is not constructed, traffic growth will be \nsuppressed and transport costs will increase. The congested  traffic movements will slow the \neconomic growth of the project area. Based on the findings of the TA (footnote 31), the forecast \ntraffic volume on the expressway is expected to grow from 7,600 passenger car units (pcu) in \n2010 to 15,100 pcu in 2020, a 7.1% average annual growth rate. It will then grow more slowly at \n6.0% per annum thereafter to reach 25,600 pcu in 2029 (Appendix 12). \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n40.  To meet the growing transport demand in the project area, possible alternatives were \nconsidered as part of the national and provincial transport network plan. Alternative analysis \nreviewed various options in terms of transport modes, alignments, technical designs, timing of \ninvestments,  and  financing  modalities.  The  conclusion  was  to  improve  road  transport  by \nconstructing  an  expressway  supported  by  a  complementary  local  road  improvement.  The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and without-project \nsituations. Without the Project, the traffic volume would exceed the optimum capacity of the \n ", "14   \nexisting National Highway 312, which would become congested, thereby increasing travel time, \nvehicle operating costs (VOCs), and the number of accidents. With the Project, travel time will be \nreduced because of higher speeds and shorter distance; VOCs will be reduced because of faster \nand smoother travel on the expressway; and the accident rate will be reduced through the \nelimination of congestion, provision of safety features, and separation of fast- and slow-moving \ntraffic. Similar benefits also accrue to the traffic on the existing road. If local roads are not \nupgraded, people in the remote parts of the project area will have less mobility and the mainly \npoor inhabitants will not be able to participate in the mainstream of economic activities. The \neconomic costs of the expressway reflect the resource costs for construction, O&M, and the value \nof agricultural production from land lost permanently. The economic benefits generated by the \nexpressway include (i) savings in VOCs as a result of reduced road length and improved traffic \nconditions, (ii) time savings for road users, (iii) savings from avoided physical damage as a result \nof fewer accidents, and (iv) benefits from generated traffic. \n \n41.  The EIRR for the Project is estimated at 16.6%, indicating that the Project is economically \nviable  (Appendix 13). Results of sensitivity analysis confirm the robustness of the Project's \neconomic viability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 10% reduction in benefits, do not \nsignificantly impact on the economic viability. The capital cost would have to increase by 68% \nfrom the estimate for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. The benefit level would have to \ndecrease by 38% to achieve the same effect. In light of previous experience in the PRC road \nsector, variations of such magnitude are unlikely. The EIRR was also calculated separately for \nthe expressway and for local roads. The EIRR was 16.1% for the expressway component and \n25.7% for the local road component. The economic analysis of the Project was extended to \nanalyze the distribution of project net benefits by determining the project effects for various \nbeneficiaries, including road users, the local economy, labor, and government. Road users will \nreceive  the  largest  share  of  net  benefits,  accounting  for  79%  of  the  total  net  benefits \n(Appendix 13). \n \nC.  Financial Analysis and Projections \n \n42.  The proposed toll rates for the expressway are considered reasonable to attract sufficient \ntraffic to meet economic and financial rate of return criteria. GPCD will undertake a toll analysis \nbefore opening the expressway, and each year for 5 years thereafter, to confirm the appropriate \nlevel of toll, and it will submit the results for ADB\u2019s concurrence. If an adjustment of the toll levels \nis  required  based  on  this  principle,  GPCD  will  submit  its  toll  adjustment  plans  for  ADB\u2019s \nconcurrence before finalizing and submitting it to GPG for approval. \n \n43.  Financial projections have been prepared for GLEC in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \nfor the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB to \nassess  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  the  Project  (Appendix 14). The projected \nfinancial statements indicate that financial revenues will be sufficient to cover O&M costs, income \ntaxes, and debt service. The financial evaluation of the expressway was undertaken in real terms \nusing constant 2004 prices. Incremental costs and  revenues were derived by evaluating the \nfinancial  position  of  the  GLEC  under  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  An  FIRR  for  the \nexpressway, computed on an after-tax basis, is 6.1%. This compares favorably with the weighted \naverage cost of capital of 2.9%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR for the expressway is \nrobust under adverse conditions. Based on the financial projections and financial evaluation of \nthe  expressway  component,  the  Project  is  considered  financially  viable  and  sustainable \n(Appendix 14). \n \n ", "  15 \nD.  Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \n44.  Causes  of  poverty  in  the  project  area  include  degraded  land  and  a  lack  of  water \nresources,39  weaknesses  in  the  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector,  and  poor \ninfrastructure and access. The last point is  true especially in the rural areas due to poor  and \nseasonally accessible roads, preventing timely delivery of goods and services, and discouraging \ncash crop production, off-farm work, and labor migration, some of the main factors needed to lift \nthe poor out of poverty. In urban areas, the main causes of poverty are lack of employment \nopportunities. The project area consists of areas with the potential to develop cash crops, tourism, \nand mining industries. There are 4.4 million people living in the project area: 3.9 million in the \nrural area and 0.5 million in the urban area. Of these, 1.6 million (36%) are poor, living on \nincomes below CNY900 in rural areas and the minimum living standards40 in urban areas. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 15 and a full poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n45.  The Project design includes several measures to maximize its poverty reduction. The poor \nwill use the Project local roads to sell their produce to others who will use the roads to transport \nthe goods to markets. Agricultural inputs will be transported via the expressway and improved \nlocal roads more efficiently and cheaply to rural areas. There are many complementary poverty \nreduction activities funded by government agencies. In addition to the time and transport cost \nsavings, these initiatives will improve the rural poor farmers\u2019 terms of trade and reduce income \npoverty.  The  expressway  and  local  roads  will  facilitate  the  access  of  the  poor  to  off-farm \nemployment opportunities.  The Project will create about 7,000 jobs annually during project \nimplementation and about 490 jobs during operations. The nonincome dimension of poverty will \nbe reduced with better access to health and education. The Project will encourage civil works \ncontractors and service operators to employ the poor. \n \n46.  The incidence of HIV/AIDS in Gansu is low41 relative to other provinces. To help address \nthe  issue  nationwide,  the  Action  Plan  to  Contain,  Prevent  and  Control  HIV/AIDS is being \nimplemented  by  the  Ministry  of  Health  with  support  from  the  United  Nations.42 This plan \narticulates specific actions focusing on blood safety, care, and raising public awareness. In the \ncontext of the proposed Project, improved transport and greater population mobility due to the \nProject might lead to a short-term increase in the spread of HIV/AIDS. The Project might facilitate \nthe migration of poor and seasonal workers to other provinces, whose high-risk behavior could \nspread  HIV/AIDS.  To  address  this  issue,  an  awareness-building  campaign  and  prevention \nmeasures are important, and some measures are being taken by the Gansu Provincial Health \nDepartment. Consultations with nongovernment organizations, health institutes, and transport \noperators during project preparation revealed that, while HIV/AIDS incidence is low in the project \narea, dissemination of HIV/AIDS information during construction is important and will be included \n                                                                 \n39 Gansu is one of the six western provinces eligible for assistance under the ADB formulated PRC/GEF Strategic \nPartnership on Land Degradation. \n40  Minimum living standard for urban areas as measured by the annual per capita urban income is in a range of \nCNY1,248 in Huining to CNY1,404 in Kongtong. \n41 The HIV positive rate among injecting drug users in Gansu province was 5% compared with 18% in Guangxi Zhuang \nAutonomous Region in 2001 (Source: United Nations AIDS. 2002. HIV/AIDS: China\u2019s Titanic Peril\u20142001 Update of \nthe AIDS Situation and Needs Assessment Report. Beijing: United Nations Theme Group on HIV/AIDS in China, \nBeijing). \n42 The PRC is a signatory to the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS, and its assistance is \nbeing provided through the United Nations Development Assistance Framework for the PRC. \n ", "16   \nin the civil works contract documents. The Epidemic and Disease Control Center in Lanzhou, with \nbranch offices in county hospitals, has the capacity to implement and monitor the programs.43 \n \n47.  The Project is classified as indigenous people category B.  The only  potential adverse \nimpact on ethnic minorities relates to land acquisition and resettlement. Since the Hui (Muslim \nminority) are integrated in the current social system, the compensation and rehabilitation adopted \nfor affected Hui people will be the same as those for Han people. To respect their customs and \nmaintain their social relationships, all affected minority people will be resettled within the same \nvillages and village groups. Assistance will be provided to affected Hui villages to improve their \nmosques and other social infrastructure. Any vulnerable households, including ethnic minorities, \nwill receive special assistance for relocation and will have priority for job training. GPCD agreed \nto implement a Social Development Action Plan (SDAP) to enhance the project benefits to the \npoor and ethnic minorities along the alignment and the broader project area, such as promotion of \ngender equity and prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking (Supplementary Appendix G).  \n \nE.  Environmental Assessment \n \n48.  The Project is classified as environment category A. An EIA for the expressway was \nprepared by GPCD, and an initial environmental examination for the local roads was prepared by \nthe TA consultants. A summary EIA for the Project was prepared and circulated to the Board, and \nmade  public  through  ADB\u2019s  web  site  on  30  July  2004,  based  on  the  EIA  and  the  initial \nenvironmental examination. To ensure that potential adverse environmental impacts of project \ndesign, construction, and operation are mitigated, the environmental management plan (EMP), \ncontaining monitoring program, mitigation measures, and acquisition of necessary permits, as \nspecified in the EIA, will be implemented. Permits for individual construction work will be obtained \nprior to the works. The project highway will pass through the experimental zone of Kongtong \nMountain  Provincial  Nature  Reserve,  where  multiple  land  uses  are  allowed.  Environmental \nimpacts  on  the  reserve  areas  will  be  minimized  by  implementing  the  EMP.  Environmental \nmitigation measures will be incorporated in the civil works contracts. \n \nF.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n49.  The project expressway will affect 23 townships, 93 administrative villages, and 374 \nvillage groups in  five counties\u2014Jingchuan, Kongtong, and Jingning counties in Pingliang city, \nHuining county in Baiyin city, and Anding district in Dingxi city. Based on preliminary design data, \n1,150 ha of land will be acquired, 63% of which is farmland. The remaining land is forestland, \nhousing plots, and wasteland. Approximately 100 ha of land will be occupied temporarily during \nthe construction phase. The farmland acquisition involves 4,285 persons losing all their farmland. \nInvestigations and past experience in Gansu reveal that each affected household loses one third \nof their farmland. Consequently, land acquisition is estimated to affect 2,840 households with \n13,150  persons.  About  55,612  square  meters  of  houses  will  be  demolished,  necessitating \nrelocation of 520 households with 2,350 persons. All displaced households can be relocated a \nshort distance to another site within their original village. During route selection, adjustments were \nmade to minimize impacts on farmland and housing. Consequently, the adverse impact of the \nProject is relatively small and localized. Once the design for each of the road has been finished, \nGPCD will send ADB an updated resettlement plan.  \n                                                                 \n43 An ongoing Technical Assistance for Preventing HIV/AIDS on Road Projects in Yunnan Province will provide a guide \nin addressing the HIV/AIDS issues for the Project. \n ", "  17 \n50.  The Project is classified as involuntary resettlement category A. ADB has reviewed the \ndraft  resettlement  plan  (see  Appendix 16  for  a  summary  and  a  full  resettlement  plan  in \nSupplementary Appendix H) and has discussed it with GPCD, other government agencies, village \nleaders, and affected people. The draft resettlement plan was endorsed by GPCD and circulated \nto  the  affected  city  and  county  and  district  officials  for  their  feedback.  GPCD  distributed \nresettlement information booklets to affected townships, villages, village groups and households \nto  be  relocated,  on  12  August  2004.  The  resettlement  information  booklets  describe  the \nresettlement  impact,  resettlement  policy,  compensation  rates  and  policies,  organizational \narrangements,  rehabilitation  options,  consultation  and  participation  process,  and  grievance \nprocedures. The resettlement plan was uploaded on the ADB web site on 6 October 2004. \n \nG.  Risks \n \n51.  The Project was formulated to reduce potential technical, economic, financial, and social \nrisks. The main technical risks are associated with the tunnel and bridge structures. To mitigate \nthe risks, international consultants reviewed the proposed design and construction methods. \nPrequalification  of  contractors  focuses on their financial and technical capability in handling \ncomplex works. During construction, monitoring and contract management information systems \nwill be set up and implemented, with the assistance of the international consultants, for timely \nidentification  of  technical  problems  and  implementation  of  corrective  measures.  GPCD  has \nproven  experience  and  has  shown  satisfactory  performance  in  implementing  internationally \nfinanced projects. Economic performance in the project-influenced area would have to deteriorate \nsubstantially for the Project to lose its economic viability. The financial risks associated with \nconstruction and operation of the expressway will depend on the actual level and composition of \ntraffic,  construction  costs,  ability  of  the  commercial  management,  and  appropriate  tolls.  To \nmitigate  the  financial  risks,  GLEC  will  build  up  a  commercial  business  environment  for \nexpressway  operations,  the  project  expressway  will  receive  substantial  equity  from  the \ngovernment, and an appropriate toll structure will be adopted. For a project that generates \nrevenue in domestic currency, a risk is related to exchange rate changes, and is partly accounted \nfor in the base case calculations. An adverse exchange rate change of 30% would have only a \nsmall effect on the financial return. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n52.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, GPG, and GPCD have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n53.  Construction Quality. GPCD will ensure that the Project is constructed in accordance \nwith 2004 technical standards of MOC for highway engineering.  The international consultant \ndesignated as the team leader and assistant chief supervision engineer will review and certify \nvariation orders and contractors\u2019 monthly payments, before submission to the chief supervision \nengineer. \n \n54.  Road Safety. Prior to project construction and operations, GPCD will carry out road safety \naudits, the recommendations of which will be implemented prior to project construction and \noperations.  For  the  project  expressway,  GPCD  will  implement  the  road  safety  signage, \ncommunication, hazard barriers, traffic monitoring, and vehicle weighing in accordance with MOC \nregulations and other regulations and standards; and will cooperate closely with the Gansu Public \nSecurity Bureau to implement necessary road safety measures. Before opening of the project \nexpressway, GPCD in consultation with the Gansu Public Security Bureau will submit a report on \nthe emergency response plan to ADB for review.  \n ", "18   \n55.  Roadside Stations and Transport Services. Prior to completion of the local roads under \nthe Project, GPCD will establish four roadside stations to facilitate community development by \nlinking such roads with community activities. Facilities to be provided at the roadside stations may \ninclude parking areas; bus terminals; gasoline stations; information centers about roads, road \nsafety, tourism and HIV/AIDS; local specialty markets; restaurants; and agro-processing facilities. \nThese will be reviewed by GPCD by the time of the midterm review. GPCD will also review by \nthen the possibility of providing bus stops along the project expressway, in consultation with bus \noperators, with due regard for safety. \n \n56.  Corporatization. By 31 December 2007, GPCD will establish a company, tentatively \ncalled the Gansu Luoding Expressway Company (GLEC), to operate and manage the proposed \nproject expressway. At least 1 year before start of operations, the project expressway will be \ntransferred to GLEC. Details on the creation of GLEC and transfer of assets and debt service \nobligations from GPCD to GLEC, including GLEC\u2019s financial statements for the Project, will be \nsubmitted for ADB approval 6 months prior to the establishment of GLEC. GLEC will implement a \ncorporate  development  plan  by  31  December  2008  to  assure  high  standards  of  corporate \ngovernance, management practices, and financial reporting. The concept of an interprovincial \nexpressway corporation will be reviewed by GPCD prior to project completion. \n \n57.  Private Sector Development. By 30 June 2008,  GPCD will enter into a concession \nframework  agreement  with  GLEC  to  ensure  autonomy  of  operations,  encourage  the \nestablishment of road performance indicators, and facilitate future refinancing of road sector \nassets. Six months before the opening of the project facilities, GPCD will analyze the feasibility of \nattracting private sector investment funds for future road sector investment, including private \nsector participation in O&M of the project expressway, and report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n58.  Tolls. In determining toll level, GPG will take into consideration levels sufficient to satisfy \nGLEC\u2019s debt service coverage ratio of a minimum of 1.2. Six months before the expressway is \nopened, GPCD will seek ADB\u2019s concurrence on the proposed toll structure and levels prior to \nseeking GPG approval. For the first 5 years of operation, GPCD will review the toll structure and \nlevels annually, and submit a report to ADB. GPCD will seek ADB\u2019s concurrence on toll level \nadjustment before seeking GPG approval. \n \n59.  Financial Ratios. To ensure financial sustainability, GPCD will cause GLEC to maintain \n(i) a debt-to-equity ratio of not more than 65:35 from the third year of operation; (ii) a working ratio \n(annual O&M cost, but excluding periodic maintenance cost, to revenue) of not more than 15%; \nand (iii) a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.2 from the third year of operation. \n \n60.  Human Resource Development and Training. GPCD will prepare a human resource \ndevelopment plan. Before undertaking international training, GPCD will prepare, among others for \nADB\u2019s concurrence, a training plan, a program of workshops to be delivered at GPCD by those \ntrained internationally, and a list of training equipment and aids to strengthen GPCD\u2019s domestic \ntraining programs.  \n \n61.  Environment. GPCD will ensure that the Project is designed, constructed, and operated \nin accordance with government rules and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002). \nGPCD will implement the EMP set out in the EIA and summary EIA to mitigate any adverse \nenvironmental impacts arising from the Project; mitigation measures will be incorporated in the \nbidding documents and civil works contracts. GPG will re-demarcate the boundary of nature \nreserve appropriately in accordance with government regulations and procedures.  \n ", "  19 \n62.  Vehicle Emissions. GPG will (i) provide to ADB the national emission standards and the \npenalties for infringement of such standards, and (ii) ensure that Gansu Environmental Protection \nBureau (GEPB), Gansu Public Security Bureau, and other relevant agencies enforce the national \nvehicle emission standards, and fulfill requirements of the government strategies, at least 6 \nmonths prior to the opening of the expressway. \n \n63.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. GPG and GPCD will ensure that land acquisition \nand resettlement are carried out promptly and efficiently following the resettlement plan agreed \nwith  ADB,  in  line  with  the  Land  Administration  Law  and  ADB's  Policies  on  Involuntary \nResettlement  (1995)  and  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  GPG  and  GPCD  will  ensure  that \nimplementation of the resettlement plan is monitored and evaluated and reported to ADB as \nrequired in the plan. \n \n64.  Ethnic Minorities. GPCD will implement the SDAP to ensure that ethnic minorities benefit \nfrom the Project in at least an equitable manner and in accordance with ADB's Policy on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998),  and  that  implementation  of  the  SDAP  will  be  monitored  and \nevaluated by an independent agency. \n \n65.  Poverty Reduction. The Government will cause GPG to implement the SDAP in a timely \nmanner. GPCD will cause the contractors to maximize the employment of local poor people who \nmeet the job and efficiency requirements for construction of the project roads. Such workers will \nbe provided with on-the-job training. The Government will cause GPG to extend the coverage and \nquality of public utilities, basic health, and basic education in the project area to enhance the \nProject\u2019s poverty reduction impacts. The Poverty Alleviation Office, in consultation with GPCD, \nwill monitor the impacts on poverty with the assistance of a designated local institute based on a \nset of indicators as outlined in the SDAP, and will submit annual monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n66.  Labor  Standards.  GPCD  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable labor legislation. Bidding documents will include a clause on the prohibition of child \nlabor for construction and maintenance activities, as well as a clause ensuring equal pay for men \nand women for work of equal value. \n \n67.  Gender and Development. GPCD will follow ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998) during project implementation, and will take all necessary actions to encourage women to \nparticipate in planning and implementing the Project. GPCD will monitor the effects on women \nduring  project  implementation  through  gender-disaggregated  data  where  relevant  in  the \nresettlement plan and the monitoring and evaluation system. \n \n68.  Health  Risks.  The  Department  of  Health  and  GPCD,  together  with  the  appropriate \nauthorities, will ensure that contractors disseminate information on the risks of HIV/AIDS to those \nemployed during project implementation. The Department of Health and GPCD will also ensure \nthat similar information is disseminated to transport operators and local communities living in the \nproject area during project operation, at roadside stations and other suitable facilities. \n \n69.  Axle Loads. GPCD will install vehicle axle-weighing equipment at selected entry points. \nBefore opening the project expressway, GPCD will submit to ADB the plan for operation of the \nvehicle weigh stations, including the prescribed axle-load limits and penalties for infringement. \n \n70.  Change in Ownership. If (i) any change in ownership of the project facilities, or (ii) any \nsale, transfer, or assignment of GPCD\u2019s interest in the project expressway is anticipated, the \nGovernment, GPG, and GPCD will consult ADB at least 6 months before the change.  \n ", "20   \n71.  Coordination Arrangement. The Government will ensure that (i) prior to the opening of \nthe project expressway, Ningxia government will construct the section of the expressway in the \nregion, linking the two parts of the project expressway in Gansu, to maximize the benefits of the \nproject expressway, and (ii) such section is constructed in accordance with the same technical \nstandards as those of the project expressway. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n72.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Gansu Roads Development Project from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n                 \n                    Tadao Chino \n                            President \n \n17 November 2004 \n ", "Appendix 1  21\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanism  Assumptions and Risks \nGoal       \n1.

Road Network \n \n1.  The People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s (PRC\u2019s) road network was 1.81 million kilometers (km) \nin 2003, an increase of 44,600 km from 2002. Of this, 1.44 million km were classified. Class II \nand above roads accounted for 271,600 km, 15% of  the total length.  The road density has \nincreased from 12.1 km per 100 square km (km2) in 1995 to 18.9 km per 100 km2 in 2003. That \nyear,  Gansu\u2019s  road  network  accounted  for  2.2%  of  the  country\u2019s  total,  with  a  length  of \n40,224 km. Of this total, 30,806 km (76.6 %) were classified: 319 km of expressways (0.8%), \n154 km of Class I roads (0.4%), 4,134 km of Class II roads (10.3%), and 26,199 km of Class III\u2013\nIV roads (65.1%). Unclassified roads amounted to 9,418 km (23.4%). The road density in Gansu \nwas 8.9 km per 100 km2, significantly lower than the national average. \n \n2.  The  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  is \npromoting a trans-regional Asian Highway Network, extending 140,000 km, of which 26,000 km \nare in the PRC. Road projects funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are contributing to \nthe development of this network through a total of 13 completed or planned projects comprising \n2,100 km, with a total loan amount of about $2.4 billion. \n  \nB.  Vehicle Fleet and Traffic \n \n3.  In 2003, the PRC vehicle fleet totaled 24 million trucks, cars, and buses, and 72 million \nother motorized vehicles (motorcycles and agricultural vehicles). The privately owned fleet of \nmotor vehicles increased more than 20 times during 1985\u20132003, from 0.3 million vehicles to \n12 million. Despite the rapid increase in total vehicles, there are only about 1.3 vehicles for 100 \npersons, which is low relative to other Asian countries. The PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade \nOrganization  has  increased  investment  in  the  automobile  industry,  reduced  the  tariffs  on \nimported vehicles, and contributed to making motor vehicle financing easier to access. These \nfactors,  plus  rapidly  growing  urban  incomes,  underpin  the  growth  in  road  traffic.  The \nmodernization of the vehicle fleet will improve vehicle safety and reduce individual vehicles\u2019 fuel \nconsumption and their emissions. In 2003, the number of vehicles registered in  Gansu was \n134,900 passenger vehicles and 116,600 freight vehicles. Vehicle ownership in Gansu is lower \nthan the national average. Privately owned vehicles totaled 100,000. Road passenger traffic in \nGansu province measured in terms of passenger-km of travel grew by more than 70% between \n1990 and 2002, reaching 134 million. Road freight traffic, in ton-km, grew by 43% during the \nsame period. \n \nC.  Road Administration \n \n4.  Gansu Provincial Communications Department (GPCD) is responsible for regulating the \nroad transport industry in  Gansu by licensing drivers, vehicles, and intercity bus services. \nFreight transport is essentially deregulated; however, interprovincial bus routes require Ministry \nof Communications (MOC) approval. Through trucking reforms, there has been an increase in \nprivate  operations  resulting  in  improved  transport  efficiency  and  quality  of  services  and \nincreased competition.  ADB is supporting this process through  a technical assistance (TA),1 \nwhich aims to help improve the performance of the road transport industry by formulating policy \nreforms in the road freight and passenger services. Road administration is decentralized. Road \n                                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Policy Reform in Road Transport. Manila. \n ", "Appendix 2  25\ntransport tariffs are allowed within a range of plus or minus 20% of advisory tariffs set by the \nlocal government. This flexibility, coupled with ease of market entry, will facilitate the passing on \nto transport users of cost reductions resulting from improved road conditions. \n \nD.  Road Sector Revenue and Expenditures \n \n5.  Expenditures  in  highway  infrastructure  are  financed  from  dedicated  user  charges, \ngovernment grants, domestic bank loans and bonds, and foreign loans and investments. Two \ndedicated user charges, the road maintenance fee and vehicle purchase fee, have provided \nmuch of the financing for the road sector. During the Ninth Five-Year Plan of 1996\u20132000, the \nroad maintenance fee and vehicle purchase fee provided 53% and 13%, respectively, of the \ntotal road investments. Government grants provided 2% mainly to construct or improve rural \nroads in poor areas. The rest was financed from domestic loans and bonds (9%), other \ndomestic investments including financing from local governments and state-owned enterprises \n(12%), foreign loans (8%), and foreign direct investment (3%). \n \n6.  As  part  of  a  tax  reform  to  bring  off-budget  revenue  and  expenditures  within  the \nframework of the national budget, the National People\u2019s Congress passed amendments to the \nHighway Law on 31 October 1999. The amendments laid the foundation for future legislation \nproviding for national taxes to replace provincial and local fees. The vehicle purchase fee was \nreplaced by the vehicle purchase tax effective January 2001, and a fuel tax is being considered \nto replace the road maintenance fee. Based on findings of an ADB-financed TA,2 the fuel tax is \nlikely to improve financing of the road sector.  \n \n7.  In Gansu province, GPCD invested about CNY4.9 billion in the road sector in 2003, of \nwhich 65% was allocated to construction and 9% to maintenance. During the 10th Five-Year \nPlan (2001\u20132005), total investment is expected to be about CNY24 billion with an annual \naverage growth rate of 5.8% during this period. GPCD plans to nearly double road investment to \nCNY44 billion during the 11th Five-Year Plan. \n \nE.  Road Engineering, Construction, and Maintenance \n \n8.  Road  projects  are  designed  by  planning  and  design  institutes  at  the  provincial, \nprefecture, and county levels. MOC reviews the designs of expressways, high-standard roads, \nand  associated  structures.  Design  institutes  are  staffed  with  experienced,  well-qualified \npersonnel. The city and county highway bureaus have their own construction units to carry out \nminor projects within their administrative districts. Drawing on the experience gained under \nADB- and World Bank-financed projects, competitive bidding practices were mandated by the \n1999 Tendering and Bidding Law.3 Many of the largest provincial and urban construction units \nare being reorganized into financially independent companies and have been awarded contracts \nindividually or as partners in joint ventures on several ADB- and World Bank-financed in-country \nor overseas projects. \n \n9.  Road maintenance is well organized by the expressway companies and the highway \nadministration bureaus and is carried out mainly through labor-intensive operations but with \nincreasing  amounts  of  mechanized  works.  Although  maintenance  expenditures  increased \nsignificantly in absolute terms in the past decade and maintenance is generally adequate, \n                                                                 \n2  ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n ", "26        Appendix 2 \nmaintenance expenditures decreased as a percentage of total road expenditures. For the low-\nclass roads in rural areas, there is a strong tradition of community self-help by which rural roads \nare maintained by local residents by allocating several days of labor. This ensures a high level \nof awareness of the need for adequate maintenance and pressures the local governments to \nmaintain an acceptable level of serviceability. Thus maintenance standards in rural areas are \nresponsive to public pressures where there is a strong tradition of public accountability. This is \nless effective in towns where such issues tend to be media-led and do not normally result in \nsustained pressure.4 \n \nF.  Government\u2019s Rural Road Development Program \n \n10.  MOC has prepared a National Rural Road Development Plan. Under this plan, rural \nroads  will  be  developed  in  three  stages.  By  2005,  the  length  of  rural  roads  will  total \n1.55 million km; by 2010, 1.85 million km, connecting all townships and administrative villages in \nthe  country;  and  by  2020,  2.5 million km,  and  transport  services  will  be  provided  to \nadministrative village level. \n \nG.  Road Transport Services \n \n11.  A relaxation of trucking regulations in the 1980s allowed privately owned trucks to haul \ncargo for state-owned factories and cooperatives. Privately owned trucks expanded their market \nshare during the 1990s at the expense of state-owned transport companies, many of which are \nnow being privatized. The competition improves road transport efficiency and service quality. \nMOC is encouraging the private sector to augment the overall capacity of the road transport \nindustry.  In  the  future  more  small  freight  operators  will  merge  and  there  will  be  more \nprivatization of large state-owned companies. \n \n12.  To enhance benefits flowing to local communities through infrastructure improvement, it \nwill be necessary to ensure that efficient and safe transport services are in place. One of the \nissues relates to the lack of bus stops on the expressways. As the interprovincial expressway \nsystem is developed, long-distance public transport services are becoming available for the \npeople living along the expressways. However, bus stops are unavailable on the expressways \nprimarily for safety reasons, given that the expressways are access controlled. MOC\u2019s new \nhighway design standards, effective 1 March 2004, provide for installing bus stops either along \nthe main lanes or at the service areas. GPCD will review the possibility of providing bus stops \non the project expressway in consultation with bus operators during project implementation, \nkeeping in view of the need to address safety aspects. Other issues are lack of competition in \nthe transport services market; regulations on tariff and routes for bus and trucking services; and \ninsufficient credit for purchasing vehicles, especially for rural and informal vehicles. These \naspects of road transport are being addressed by MOC and selected provinces with assistance \nprovided under a recently approved TA.5 \n \nH.  Policy Dialogue \n \n13.  ADB has been undertaking policy dialogue on the PRC road sector since 1991. The \nprincipal  issues  addressed  include  the  poverty  impact  of  road  projects,  highway  design \nstandards,  and  construction  quality,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  pricing  policies, \n                                                                 \n4  ADB. 1998.

Road Safety \n \n1.  The  Traffic  Management  Department  of  Gansu  Public  Security  Bureau  (GPSB)  is \nresponsible for recording and managing accident data for Gansu province. About 84% of all \naccidents  were  caused  by  driver  error,  with  26%  involving  unlicensed  drivers.  Weather \nconditions did not have a large impact on the number of accidents (79% of accidents occur \nduring fine weather and 9% during cloudy weather). There were more accidents in the day than \nat night (75% of all accidents were during the day). There was no relationship between road \nconditions and accident rates as 82% of accidents occurred on normal road sections, with 73% \nof these accidents taking place on straight, flat roads. The majority of accidents occur on city \ntrunk roads and lower grade (Class II or III) roads. Lack of proper driver training, inadequate \nenforcement of traffic regulations, alcohol, and the lack of use of seat belts and infant car seats \ncontribute to the high accident and death rates. \n \n2.  The cause of most traffic accidents in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) seems to be \na neglect of traffic rules and people\u2019s casual attitude toward road safety. Given this situation, the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) supported the development of a comprehensive action plan in \n2001 to address critical road safety issues in the PRC. This resulted in the revision of traffic \nlaws that became effective on 1 May 2004 with the goal of reducing traffic accidents. There has \nalso been a radio publicity campaign to promote driver awareness. \n \n3.  Every year, the Traffic Management Department prepares a road safety action plan \nbased on the results of analyses of traffic accidents from the previous year. Some strategies to \nreduce traffic accidents are as follows:  \n \n(i)  establishing an Accident Protection Division and setting up branch organizations \nin counties and villages. The work of branch units is carried out with local traffic \npolice and other relevant organizations. GPSB analyzes accident data collected \nfrom each organization to draw up future strategies;  \n(ii)  strengthening police checks and increasing police patrols on roads to enforce \ntraffic laws and regulations; and \n(iii)  promoting  traffic  safety  via  pamphlets,  posters,  and  other  modes  of \ncommunications  that  promote  the  use  of  seat  belts  and  cover  the  adverse \nrelationship between road safety and alcohol consumption. \n \n4.  Accident-prone areas are selected and targeted by GPSB yearly. Measures to eliminate \nthem  include:  (i) educating  drivers  about  safe  driving  and  dangerous  road  conditions; \n(ii) locating police checkpoints at or near black spots; (iii) installing speed limits and other \nwarning signs and plates in easy-to-see locations; (iv) installing guardrails, traffic barriers, or \nfences at curves; (v) changing traffic lane markings when necessary from white to yellow  in \ncolor; and (vi) improving the cross grade at sharp curves. \n \n5.  Most accidents are caused by driver error due to speeding, overloading, neglecting \ntraffic signals, dangerous overtaking, or consumption of alcohol. Accidents caused by faulty \nroad structure are small in number and are sometimes due to poor pavement conditions as a \nresult of insufficient maintenance. The structure of the proposed expressway, which is based on \nPRC\u2019s Highway Design Standards presents no problems in terms of road safety. \n \n ", "Appendix 6        35 \n6.  While horizontal and vertical alignments meet safety standards, there is still room for \nimprovement. Safety facilities will be reinforced for the alignment near Pingjiashan Tunnel. For \nexample, a special lane marking consisting of continuous broken lines on either side is effective \nat sharp curves for visually informing drivers of a potentially dangerous upcoming section of \nroad. \n \n7.  Road safety facilities and equipment for expressway operations can be divided into three \ntypes according to their function. The first type directly affects driver behavior, the second type \nis for responding to accidents, and the third type is for accident prevention. Examples of such \nroad safety facilities are as follows and will be considered for the Project: (i) facilities directly \naffecting driver behavior, including (a) crash barriers, (b) special lane marking, (c) variable traffic \ninformation  boards,  and  (d)  traffic  monitoring  systems;  (ii) accident  response,  including \n(a) emergency telephones, (b) station post signs, (c) vehicles and tools required for accident \nattendance or investigation; and (iii) accident prevention, including (a) speed measurement \ndevices, (b) devices for measuring the amount of alcohol consumed by drivers, (c) axle load \nmeasurement devices, and (d) accident data recording and analysis system.  \n \nB.  Vehicle Emissions \n \n8.  Vehicle ownership in the PRC has been increasing sharply, with much of this growth \noccurring in cities. Nationally, the annual growth of vehicles has averaged 14% per year. The \ntotal number of motorized vehicles reached 96.5 million by the end of 2003, 21% higher than in \n2002. One result of this rapid growth has been the emergence of motor vehicle air pollution \nproblems, especially in cities. The growth in the vehicle fleet will continue in coming decades, \nresulting in concerns regarding further environmental degradation. It is estimated that vehicle \nemissions will account for 79% of air pollution by 2005. \n \n9.  Key  environment-related  motor  vehicle  programs  include  those  in  the  areas  of \n(i) national  emissions  standards  for  new  vehicles,  (ii) improvement  of  conventional  fuels, \n(iii) alternative  or  cleaner  fuels,  (iv) vehicle  inspection  and  maintenance  programs,  and \n(v) retirement of obsolete polluting vehicles. \n \n10.  The government emission standards for new vehicles are as follow: (i) the limits and \nmeasurement methods for exhaust pollutants from compression ignition engines of vehicles, \nissued on 16 April 2001, has been implemented in two stages: (a) from 16 April 2001 to 1 \nSeptember 2003, and (b) from 1 September 2003; (ii) limits and measurement methods for \nexhaust pollutants from positive ignition engines of vehicles and vehicles equipped with positive \nignition engines, issued on 27 November 2002, has been implemented in two stages: (a) from 1 \nJanuary  2003  to  1  September  2003;  and  (b) from  1  September  2003;  (iii) limits  and \nmeasurement methods for exhaust emissions from motorcycles under running mode, issued on \n27 November 2002, have been implemented in three stages: (a) from 1 January 2003, (b) from \n1 July 2003 to 31 December 2004, and (c) from 1 January 2005; (iv) limits and measurement \nmethods for exhaust emissions from motorcycles at idle speed, issued on 18 November 2002, \nhave been implemented in two stages: (a) from 1 January 2003, and (b) from 1 July 2003; \n(v) limits and measurement methods for exhaust emissions from mopeds under running mode, \nissued on 27 November 2002, have been implemented in two stages: (a) from 1 January 2003 \nand (b) from 1 January 2004. \n \n11.  These standards are approximately equivalent to the Euro II performance standards. \nVehicles failing to meet the standards cannot be manufactured, imported, sold, or registered. \n ", "36        Appendix 6 \nThe Vehicle Emission Control Center will publicize the list of vehicles that meet the above \nstandards.  \n \n12.  Measures have been taken to phase out the distribution of leaded fuels. Since 1 January \n2000 there has been no further production, and since 1 July 2000, no sales of leaded fuels have \nbeen permitted in the PRC. Trucks and heavy vehicles mostly use diesel engines that do not \nrequire any lead additives. There has been no difficulty in switching to unleaded fuel as it \nbecame available. Leaded gasoline is no longer available in urban areas, although old stocks of \nleaded gasoline in some rural areas may still be sold.  \n \n13.  Sulfur content is regulated via petroleum-refining production standards (content- and \nquality-based). The limitation for sulfur content in the standards of unleaded gasoline for motor \nvehicles and the hazardous materials control standard for motor vehicle gasoline is less than \n0.08% (m/m). The Government has targeted sulfur in fuels as part of broader sulfur dioxide \ncontrol efforts. \n \n14.  To  reduce  vehicle  emissions,  the  Government  has  established  the  National  Clean \nAutomobile Working Team led by the Ministry of Science and Technology, which is committed \nto speeding up the development and use of clean fuel vehicles. A pilot program for the utilization \nof clean fuel has been implemented in 12 cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and \nChongqing.  The  PRC\u2019s  four  leading  vehicle  makers  have  been  designated  as  production \ncenters for natural gas-powered vehicles. By October 2003, the number of natural gas-powered \nvehicles reached 190,000 and 560 gas stations had been built in 16 major cities to support the \nmove.  \n \n15.  The environmental protection departments in the provinces, autonomous regions, and \nmunicipalities directly under the central Government can commission units undertaking annual \ntests on motorized vehicles that have obtained qualification certification from the public security \ndepartments  to,  in  accordance  with  relevant  codes,  conduct  annual  checks  on  emission \npollution of motorized vehicles. \n \n16.  The environmental protection departments of local people\u2019s governments at the county \nor above levels can conduct random tests of in-use motorized vehicles to check their pollutant \nemission level. \n ", "Appendix 7        37 \nTRANSPORT SERVICES IN THE PROJECT AREA \n \n1.  Village-Based  Transport. Within  the  30  villages  surveyed  by  the  TA  consultants, \nmotorized tricycles (45%) and motorcycles (38%) are the most common vehicles followed by \nutility vehicles (11%), trucks (2.5\u20135 ton) (4%), and minivans (2%). Vehicles are an important \nsource of income for most owners. Almost every household has at least one bicycle, but during \nwinter the poor road conditions and the weather prevent their use. Motorized tricycles are the \nmost common method of transporting goods and agricultural produce to markets as well as from \nfarmlands to houses, and occasionally passengers. These are relatively less expensive vehicles \ncosting  in  a  range  of  CNY2,000\u2013CNY20,000  in  the  project  area  depending  on  the  type. \nUpgrading local roads will contribute to lower maintenance costs and greater safety of tricycles.  \n \n2.  Bus Services. The quality of bus services varies from place to place. Most villages are \nlocated along a road where regular bus services are available. Within the villages surveyed, \nmost people are satisfied with the level of bus services available. People use bus services to \n(i) go shopping, (ii) visit a doctor or hospital, (iii) attend middle school, (iv) travel for employment \npurposes,  (v) carry  out  trade  activities,  and  (vi) visit  family  or  friends.  The  villages  were \nsurveyed for frequency of bus services; 52% had 5\u201310 buses per day; 22% had 11\u201330 buses \nper day; 11% had more than 30 buses per day; and 15% had less than 5 buses per day. Those \nvillages with the best access are those located along National Highway 312. Other villages are \nless well served. The quality of the bus services ranges from moderate to good.  \n \n3.  Freight  Companies.  Of  the  three  freight  companies  interviewed,  two  companies \ntransport  mainly  consumer  durables,  dry  foods,  construction  materials,  and  coal.  Of  the \nproducts shipped out of the province by one company, 70% is agricultural produce. Attitudes to \ntoll roads vary. One company believes that tolls have little impact on freight charges, another \nthat the total freight cost is reduced due to better road conditions, and the third that the \nadditional cost is equally shared between the company and the customer. All three companies \nnoted that rural poor roads result in higher oil consumption and vehicle wear and tear, which \nundermine profits. Rates charged are based on various criteria depending on each company, \nsuch as (i) weight of goods, (ii) an  underloaded  truck counted as a full load, (iii) tons per \nkilometer, and (iv) higher rates for transporting fresh produce. \n \n4.  Manufacturers also use freight companies.  Five manufacturers operating in Lanzhou \ncity, Pingliang city, and three in the project area counties were interviewed. All used the existing \nhighway, the benefits being (i) shorter driving time, (ii) reduction of wear and tear on vehicles \nleading to lower maintenance costs, (iii) little damage to goods, and (iv) safety. Transport costs \nas a share of the price of goods ranges from 10% to 40%. All respondents agreed that the road \nquality affects the efficiency of their business and that narrow roads of poor quality seriously \naffect driving speeds and cause congestion, which damages or delays delivery of goods, \njeopardizes the company\u2019s image, and reduces profits. \n \n5.  Wholesalers. Agricultural wholesalers collect produce from villagers as shown in Table \nA7. Most of the produce handled by these wholesalers is shipped outside the county or \nprovince. The maximum proportion sold within the county is 25%. All those interviewed used toll \nroads due to (i) smooth traffic flow and consistent speed with few obstacles, no poor or rugged \nsections, and no need to drive through population centers; and (ii) savings on time, vehicle \noperation and maintenance costs, and fuel costs. Disadvantages include (i) traffic congestion \ndue to a limited number of opened toll gates or a long time taken for police vehicle inspection at \nthe toll gates, and (ii) high tolls.  \n \n ", "38        Appendix 7 \nTable A7: Wholesalers and Transport \n \n% Produce  % Brought to \nBrought to  Wholesaler  % Collected  % of Payment by \nWholesaler  by Other  from Villages  Farmer to Cover  Method of Calculation \nBase  by Farmers  Transporters  by Wholesaler  Cost of Transporta  of Cost of Transportb  \nLongde County  29  35  36  20\u201330  Unit freight is CNY0.4\u2013\n0.6 km/ton.

Road Conditions and Vehicle Ownership. Local roads are developed and maintained \nby the government at the county, township, and village levels and they are often underfunded \nfor construction and maintenance.  Village roads are sometimes impassable during the wet \nseason. For example, only 16 out of the 30 villages in the project area have all-weather village \nroads. There is some correlation between the level of vehicle ownership and the condition of the \nroads from the village to the township. Those villages with all-weather roads have three times as \nmany vehicles per household as those without seasonal roads. Provision of all-weather roads \nand availability of vehicles are both essential to provide better access to rural areas.  \n \n7.  The Project will include four roadside stations planned by the Gansu Provincial Public \nTransport Bureau. Since the March 2004 Highway Design Standard includes a provision that \nexpressways can include bus stops for long-distance transport, the current situation in the \nproject area will be reviewed to examine the applicability of this provision in the project design. \n \n8.  To improve transport services in the project area, the following areas pertaining to \nregulations will need to be addressed: (i) the regulations for motorized tricycles should be \nimproved, especially on vehicle licensing and registration, fees, entry restrictions, emissions, \nand  vehicle  standards;  tax  incentives  could  be  used  to  help  manufacturers  meet  these \nstandards; (ii) promotion of competition for the provision of transport services; (iii) measures to \nincrease the supply of public transport services to rural areas, such as introducing the universal \nservice obligation concept to the service providers and using some regulatory instruments; \n(iv) comprehensive review of the transportation tariff to ensure competitive pricing; (v) measures \nto extend public transport services to specific groups such as providing discounts for students, \nthe disabled, and the elderly or discounts for people traveling at certain hours in urban transport \nservices, without compromising competition; and (vi) establishing transport service standards, \nwhich include special measures for the disabled and the elderly. \n \n ", "Appendix 8        39 \nSTAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATION AND CONSULTATIONS \n \nNo. of \nAgencies  People  Purposes  Date  Main Topics \nConsulted \nState Environmental Protection  31  Discussion on the outline April\u2013July  \u2022 Evaluation on outline EIA \nAdministration, Ministry of  environmental impact  2003  \u2022 Transprovince environmental \nCommunications, Gansu  assessment (EIA), and  management issues \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau,  site investigation  \u2022 Major environmentally sensitive \nand Design Institute.    areas \nEnvironmental protection bureau,  4,500  Consultation on route  May  \u2022 Possible alternatives of the route \nforest bureau, water resource  selection, social and  2003  \u2022 Social, environmental, and \nbureau, agricultural bureau, etc.   economic impact  economic issues and solutions \nfrom Anding, Huining, Jingning,  assessment,  \u2022 Comments on route selection from \nKongtong, Jingchuan counties.  resettlement option, and  local perspective \nVillagers along the possible  EIA \nalignment-traversed villages \nDingxi and Pingliang city  73  Introduction of road  1\u201317 July  \u2022 Route selection of expressway \ngovernment and line agencies,  alignment, and major  2003  within Dingxi and Pingliang \nincluding water resource bureau,  engineering work   prefectures \nforest bureau, environmental  \u2022 Major engineering and \nprotection bureau, agricultural  environmental issues \nbureau, and city construction bureau  \u2022 Land acquisition and resettlement \nissues \nEnvironmental protection bureau,  600  Discussion on initial  October  \u2022 Possible alternatives of the route \nforest bureau, water resource  route selection, initial  2003  \u2022 Social, environmental, and \nbureau, agricultural bureau from  social and economic  economic concern on the route \nAnding, Huining, Jingning,  impact assessment, and  selection \nKongtong, Jingchuan counties  EIA    \u2022 Comments on route selection from \nlocal perspective \nProvincial poverty reduction and  22  Introduction of proposed  22 March  \u2022 Role of the proposed Project in \ndevelopment office.

Traffic surveys were made initially in May and June 2000 in and around the area of \nNational Highway (NH) 312 under the feasibility study for the Project. Based on these surveys, a \ntraffic  demand  model  was  constructed  and  traffic  forecasts  carried  out  and  subsequently \nupdated in 2002. The model was refined under the technical assistance (TA) by carrying out \nadditional surveys consisting of rail and bus user interviews and traffic counts. Based on the \nwork of the TA team, the traffic forecasts for the Project, which focused on the Lanzhou-Xi\u2019an \ntransport corridor, have been finalized and are described below. \n \n2.  The road network that extends from Lanzhou to Xi\u2019an has four existing routes, consisting \nof national highways and a provincial highway (PH) and are as follows: (i) NH312, (ii) NH309, \n(iii) NH310-NH316-PH209, and (iv) NH310-NH045. The traffic volume for the existing NH312 \nincreased during 1995\u20132000 at 8.6% per annum. Then there was a drop in 2001 due to the \nopening of an alternative road between Chankou and Tianshui. Traffic volume started to make a \nstrong recovery in 2002. \n \n3.  Analysis of future traffic demand took into account four modes of road travel: passenger \nvehicles, buses, trucks, and large trucks. The technique applied to forecasting future traffic \ndemand is the four-step estimation method and predicts traffic in a four-step process that covers \ntrip generation/attraction, trip distribution, modal split, and traffic assignment. The forecast years \nfor the Project are 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2029. \n \n4.  Trip Generation.  Trip  generation  and  attraction  models  were  constructed  for  nine \ninternal zones to cover the 10 counties of the project area that lie on either side of NH312, while \ngrowth rate factors were applied to derive the generated and attracted trips for 16 external \nzones. The generation and attraction models were constructed after examining and applying \nsuch socioeconomic factors as gross domestic product (GDP), GDP per capita, population, and \nvehicle ownership. Based on these models, it was possible to derive total trips for each of the \ntarget years.  \n \n5.  Trip Distribution. Trip distribution was carried out using the total trips generated/ \nattracted for each of the target years and applied to the updated origin-destination (OD) \nmatrixes in order to make direct use of observed traffic flows. The validity of these matrixes was \nfirst confirmed by comparing actual link flows with flows obtained from the assignment of the OD \nmatrixes for the base year.  \n \n6.  Modal Split. Modal split for rail- and road-based modes was carried out based on the \nfollowing principles: (i) a modal split model using an exponential function as a diversion curve \nwith time as a variable was applied to forecast the shifting of passengers between rail and bus; \n(ii) based on survey data, it was assumed that there would be virtually no shifting between bus \nand private passenger cars, given that only 1% of bus users own a car; (iii) it was assumed that \nthere would be a shift of about 8% of rail passengers to private passenger vehicles based on \nsurvey data; and (iv) in the case of cargo diversion, it was assumed that a shift in non-bulk high-\nvalue cargo, which accounts for only about 5% of total rail cargo, would occur as a result of the \nconstruction of the project expressway. \n \n7.  Assignment. Based on the updating and validation of the OD matrixes of the feasibility \nstudy and then the future prediction of trips via the construction of the above models, future \ninterzonal trips for each of the target years were assigned to the road network of the corridor \nusing an incremental traffic assignment model. This model operates on the principle of equal \n ", "46        Appendix 12 \ntravel times. That is, in terms of OD pairs, increased traffic volume on a given route causes a \nslowdown of travel time on that route, and part of the traffic then diverts to another route with a \nshorter travel time. This process of diversion will repeat itself until no shorter alternative route is \navailable, or until the point of equal travel times is reached. Of the trips that use the project \nexpressway, 56% pass through the project area and do not stop there. The next largest type of \ntrip consisted of in-in trips, or trips that both originated and ended in the nine internal zones. \nFinally, the trip type smallest in number was the in-out trips, accounting for 25% of total trips. \n \n8.  There will be significant improvements in terms of the performance and efficiency of the \nroad network of the Lanzhou-Xi\u2019an transport corridor as a result of the construction of the project \nexpressway. For example, without the expressway, average travel speed  will  decrease  to \n45.9 kilometers per hour (km/h) by 2029. On the other hand, with the expressway, average \nspeed in the corridor in 2029 will be 66.3 km/h. In terms of travel time, which is a function of \ncongestion and road network connectivity, without the Project there would be an increase in \ntotal travel time of 45.3%. Given this, the project expressway will divert significant vehicle trips \n(especially through trips) from other roads, and this will reduce the number of accidents, vehicle \noperating costs (VOCs), and travel time on many roads in the corridor and thereby directly \nbenefit  the  project  area.  Growth  in  traffic  demand  was  determined  based  on  future \nsocioeconomic trends that took into account changes in variables such as gross domestic \nproduct, population, and vehicle ownership. The forecast traffic volume on the expressway is \nexpected to grow from 7,600 passenger car units (pcu) in 2010 to 15,100 pcu in 2020, a 7.1% \naverage annual growth rate. It will then grow more slowly at 6.0% per annum thereafter to reach \n25,600 pcu in 2029. The traffic on the local roads will grow more slowly because of slow growth \nprospects in the project area. The forecast traffic volume is expected to grow from 1,700 pcu in \n2010 to 2,800 pcu in 2020. It will then grow more slowly to reach 4,000 pcu in 2029. \n \nTable A12: Average Annual Daily Traffic of Project Expressway \n(passenger car units) \n \nGrowth  Growth  Growth \nRate  Rate  Rate \nRoad Section  2010  2015  (%)  2020  (%)  2029  (%) \nDingxi-Shiqiaoopu      6,559       9,934   8.7    13,928   7.0    23,260   5.9 \nShibalipu-Huining      6,437       9,743   8.6    13,381   6.6    23,399   6.4 \nHuining-Taipingdian      5,285       7,433   7.1    10,336   6.8    18,877   6.9 \nTaipingdian-Jingning      5,477       7,958   7.8    11,094   6.9    20,162   6.9 \nJingning-Cailian      5,939       9,204   9.2    12,002   5.5    21,446   6.7 \nCailian-Longde      6,032       9,326   9.1    13,170   7.1    23,342   6.6 \nLongde-Dongshanpu      5,929       9,093   8.9    12,780   7.0    22,359   6.4 \nDongshanpo-Pingliang West    10,531     15,714   8.3    20,331   5.3    33,657   5.8 \nPingliang West-Pingliang East      8,608     12,981   8.6    17,805   6.5    29,789   5.9 \nPingliang East-Siqiaopu    10,351     15,214   8.0    20,933   6.6    33,032   5.2 \nSishilipu-Chongbai    10,339     13,927   6.1    19,507   7.0    33,123   6.1 \nChongbai-Jingchuan    10,440     14,551   6.9    20,150   6.7    32,447   5.4 \nJingchuan-Luohandong      8,828     11,555   5.5    15,543   6.1    24,674   5.3 \nWeighted Average      7,621     11,069   7.8    15,130   6.4    25,562   6.0 \nSource: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "Appendix 13        47 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The project expressway1 traverses the eastern part of Gansu province. Local roads are \nconnected to the expressway through the road network system. The economic analysis covers \nthe 25 years of construction and operation. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the \nproject expressway was estimated by comparing the situation with and without the Project. \nWithout the Project, traffic will use the existing road network, which will be congested and \nexpensive to maintain due to the rapidly increasing volume of traffic. Some travel may not take \nplace because of the congestion and the resulting increasing travel times and vehicle operating \ncosts (VOCs). With the Project, congestion on the existing roads will be reduced, and traffic on \nthe expressway and the existing roads will benefit from faster, cheaper, and safer travel. Some \nadditional trips will be generated as the economy responds to lower transport costs and better \nservice. \n \n2.  Alternative Analysis. Possible alternative interventions were considered to meet the \ngrowing transport demand in the project area as part of the national and provincial transport \nnetwork  plan.  Alternative  analysis  reviewed  various  options  in  terms  of  transport  modes, \nalignments, technical designs, timing of investments, and financing modalities. While enhancing \nthe existing railway capacity may be an option to partly meet the increasing demand, it will not \ncompletely satisfy the various kinds of traffic, particularly high-value general cargo that requires \na more flexible and responsive mode to meet the needs of a market economy. Six alternative \nalignments  were  reviewed  based  on  geologic  and  topographical  conditions,  terrain \nconsiderations, consultations with community representatives, cost estimates, relative impacts \non environment and resettlement, and integration with the national and local transport network. \nThe expressway technical design was proposed after consideration of the national highway \nnetwork,  consistency  in  the  standards  of  contiguous  sections  at  each  end  of  the  project \nexpressway, and forecast traffic. Alternative financing modalities were considered, including \nprivate sector investment. However, private sector investment was not found attractive due to \nrisks associated with construction and low estimated rates of return. Hence public financing was \nconsidered appropriate. \n \n3.  Expressway Component. The economic evaluation was undertaken using constant \n2004 prices. The project costs and benefits were revalued at economic prices by separating the \ncost items into tradable materials and equipment and nontradable materials, labor, and land. \nThe  prices  were  expressed  in  yuan  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow \nexchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow price was used to put an \neconomic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages for skilled labor since \nthere was no surplus of skilled workers. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.5 was used to convert \nthe financial wage rate to an economic opportunity cost of labor. The costs of the expressway \ninclude:  (i) the  capital  costs,  including  physical  contingencies,  land  acquisition,  and \nresettlement; and (ii) the costs of operating and maintaining the expressway. The land and \nresettlement costs were based on their opportunity costs, i.e., agricultural output forgone and re-\nsiting of displaced activities. \n \n4.  The economic benefits include (i) savings in VOCs resulting from the reduced  travel \ndistance and improved road conditions, (ii) savings in the value of passenger time and of freight \n                                                                 \n1  The portion of the expressway that passes through Ningxia, while not included in the project scope, is considered \nin the economic analysis, given that it is an indivisible part of the Project for the purposes of traffic forecasting and \neconomic analysis. \n ", "48        Appendix 13 \ntied up in transit, (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents, (iv) benefits to generated traffic, \nand (v) savings in capital and operation and maintenance costs for National Highway (NH) 312. \nA reduction in VOCs is the main source of economic benefits for the Project. Traffic diverting to \nthe expressway would travel at high, more economical speeds on a smoother road, with better \nvertical  and  horizontal  alignment,  less  congestion,  and  a  shorter  journey  distance.  Traffic \nremaining on the alternative NH312 route would also benefit from a reduction in traffic volume \nand congestion. All these changes affect vehicle speeds and VOCs, which were estimated for \nall vehicle types likely to use the corridor. Savings in travel time will be seen both on the project \nexpressway and the existing roads. Work-related travel time, which accounts for 38% of daily \ntotal travel time, was evaluated for private vehicles. As for public transport, the results of the rail \nuser and bus service surveys were used to derive this figure. Nonwork-related trips were \nevaluated as 10% of the value of a work-related trip.  The economic cost of accidents was \nestimated on direct property damage. The EIRR for the expressway component was 16.1%, \nindicating that the project is economically viable, with a net present value (NPV) of CNY2.9 \nbillion. \n \n5.  Local Road Component. About 470 km of local roads in five counties will be improved \nconcurrently with the expressway component. The costs of this component include capital costs \nand  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The  principal  benefits  of  the  local  road \nimprovements were identified as reduced VOCs, the producer surplus that is the value of \nadditional production minus production costs, and these are mainly for fruits and vegetables. \nTransport cost savings will accrue to normal traffic on the improved roads.  The local roads \nrecommended for upgrading were chosen based on poverty incidence, the effect on overall road \nnetwork efficiency,  economic  development  potential,  and  population  density. The five local \nroads have a combined EIRR of 25.7%. \n \n6.  The Whole Project. The Project as a whole generates an estimated EIRR of 16.6% \n(Table A13.1). The VOC savings from the expressway are the major economic benefit (67%) \nfollowed by passenger time savings 19%. Avoided accident costs, savings to generated traffic, \nand other benefits are all relatively small. The benefits of the local road component account for \n7% of the total benefits  (Table  A13.1). The results of the sensitivity analysis confirm the \nrobustness of the Project\u2019s economic viability: changes in the key variables\u2014construction costs, \n1-year delay in completion of the Ningxia section,2 without Ningxia section\u2014and benefits do not \nsignificantly affect the economic viability (Table A13.2). The capital cost would have to be 68% \nhigher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering the \nexperience of ADB in the PRC, such an increase in capital cost is unlikely. ADB-financed road \nprojects in the PRC have not encountered major cost overruns. A risk analysis was carried out \nto determine the degree of uncertainty on the Project. Each uncertainty factor (such as capital \ncost, traffic growth, and VOC value) was varied at random within the limits. The results showed \nthat an EIRR exceeding 12% will be achieved with a 96% probability. The economic analysis of \nthe Project was extended to analyze distribution of project net benefits by determining the \nproject  effects  for  various  beneficiaries,  including  road  users,  local  economy,  labor,  and \ngovernment. It was found that road users will receive the largest share of net benefit, accounting \nfor 79% of the total net benefits (Table A13.3). \n \n                                                                 \n2  Under this scenario, the traffic was assumed to be 20% less in 2010, 10% less in 2011, and 5% less in 2012. \n ", " \nTable A13.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(constant 2004 economic prices, domestic price numeraire, CNY million) \n  OpCeroastti on               Benefits  Savings i n Capital      Net                     \nYear  VOC  Time  Accident  Generated  Local Road \nCapital  and  Total    and O&M Costs   Total  Benefit \nSavings  Savings  Savings  Traffic  Component \nMaintenance    for Other Roads \n                         \n2005  1,063    1,063              (71)  (71)  (1,134)   \n2006  1,679    1,679              (71)  (71)  (1,750)   \n2007  2,579    2,579              (71)  (71)  (2,650)   \n2008  1,880    1,880              (71)  (71)  (1,951)   \n2009  897    897              (71)  (71)  (968)   \n2010    16  16    842  157  15  58    125  1,197  1,181   \n2011    32  32    910  207  16  68    132  1,333  1,301   \n2012    34  34    984  225  16  81    139  1,445  1,411   \n2013    35  35    1,064  244  17  95    146  1,567  1,531   \n2014    37  37    1,151  265  17  113    153  1,698  1,662   \n2015    38  38    1,244  288  17  133  126  161  1,969  1,931   \n2016    40  40    1,361  334  18  145    170  2,028  1,989   \n2017    41  41    1,489  387  18  159    179  2,232  2,191   \n2018    43  43    1,630  446  19  174    188  2,457  2,414   \n2019    44  44    1,783  514  20  190    198  2,705  2,661   \n2020  622  46  668    1,951  591  20  207  310  208  3,288  2,620   \n2021    48  48    2,112  643  21  217    218  3,211  3,163   \n2022    50  50    2,287  699  21  228    230  3,465  3,415   \n2023    52  52    2,476  760  22  239    242  3,739  3,687   \n2024    54  54    2,681  827  22  250    254  4,034  3,980   \n2025  551  56  607    2,903  899  23  262    267  4,353  3,746     A\n2026    58  58    3,142  977  23  275    281  4,698  4,640    pp\ne\n2027    60  60    3,402  1,063  23  288    295  5,071  5,010    n\nd\n2028    63  63    3,684  1,155  23  301  (53)  311  5,421  5,358    ix 1\n3\n2    029     (4,049)  65     (   3,984)          3,988      1,256      23      316  E(c5o3n)E ocmoinco Imntiecr nNael3t  R2P7ar etes eonf tR Ve5atu,lu8r5ne6  ==     CNY1396,,58.614%31                      4\nO&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost.   9\nSour ce: Technical assistance consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates.

General \n \n1.  The projected financial statements for the project expressway were prepared in current \nterms for the period 2005\u20132029. Construction will be completed in 2009, and the first full year of \noperation will be 2010. The assumed inflation rates are: (i) foreign: 1.5% for 2005; 0.9% for \n2006 and 2007; 1.0% for 2008 and 1.5% from 2008 onward; and (ii) local: 2.7% in 2005; and \n3.0% per year from 2008 onward. The cost estimates are presented in current terms taking into \naccount the potential impacts of domestic and international inflation.  \n \nB.  Financial Projections \n \n2.  Operating revenues from tolls are projected based on forecast traffic and a base toll rate \nof CNY0.40 per passenger car per kilometer. Corresponding tolls for other vehicle types are \nCNY0.55 for a small truck; CNY0.75 for a bus; CNY1.20 for a medium truck; and CNY1.50 for a \nlarge truck and CNY1.90 for a trailer. The toll charges will increase in current terms every 5 \nyears to keep up with inflation. There would be no real increase in tolls during operation. Toll \ncharges  are  set  to  take  into  account  full  cost  recovery,  including  provision  for  periodic \nmaintenance, and to be adjusted to meet user affordability.1 \n  \n3.  Annual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are calculated based on 2004 prices as \nfollows: (i) wages and salaries estimated at CNY8.2 million in 2010 (386 toll booth staff with \nannual average wages of CNY12,000 at 14 toll stations and 146 administration staff with annual \naverage salaries of CNY24,000). The number of toll booth staff increases as traffic grows but \nthe number of administrative staff remains constant; (ii) administration costs are assumed at \nCNY18,500 per staff year; (iv) routine and spot maintenance costs are estimated at CNY32,000 \nand CNY20,000 per km per year, respectively; (v) materials and utilities cost an average of \nCNY5.3 million per year; (vi) environmental monitoring is budgeted at CNY300,000 per year. All \nincremental O&M costs are projected to increase annually in line with domestic inflation.  In \ncurrent prices, the annual O&M costs are projected to rise from CNY35 million in 2010 to \nCNY44.3 million in 2015 and CNY53.4 million by 2020. Periodic maintenance would be required \nafter 10 years of operation.   \n \n4.  Depreciation  was  calculated  on  a  declining  balance  depreciation  method  with  an \naverage life of about 40 years for the main expressway component, 20 years for the pavement, \nand 15 years for equipment. \n \n5.  Two types of taxes were considered in the financial evaluation: business taxes of 5.5% \non gross revenue and corporate income tax at 33% of net profit. The Project will be exempted \nfrom corporate income tax fully for 2010\u20132011, receive a 50% corporate income tax exemption \nfor 2012\u20132014, and from 2015 onward it will pay full the corporate income tax rate on its profit.  \n \n6.  The Project will be funded 36% by equity or grants and 64% by long-term loans. The \ninterest rates on the China Development Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) loans are \n5.76%  and  5.48%  per  annum,  respectively.  The  China  Development  Bank  loan  will  be \nrepayable over 25 years, including a 5-year grace period. ADB\u2019s loan will have a  25-year \n                                                                 \n1  The existing toll rates in Gansu are CNY0.35, CNY0.55, CNY0.80, CNY1.25, CNY1.60, and CNY2.00 for small \ncars, small truck, bus, medium truck, large truck, and trailer, respectively.  \n ", "52        Appendix 14 \nmaturity, including a 5-year grace period and will be a US dollar London interbank offered rate-\nbased loan. Interest expenses are capitalized during the construction period.  \n \n7.  The summary financial statement is presented in Table 14.1. The main conclusions are \nsummarized as follows: (i) the projected financial statement indicates that the forecast revenues \nunder the base assumptions are sufficient to cover annual recurrent costs, depreciation, and \ndebt repayments, and generate reasonable profits from expressway operations; (ii) the working \nratio will remain below 15%; (iii) the debt service coverage ratio will be above 1.2 from the third \nyear of operations; and (iv) the debt-to-equity ratio will decrease steadily from 67% in 2010 to \n56% by 2015 and 34% by 2020. These financial results indicate an acceptable financial position \nfor the expressway under the proposed financing plan and toll structure. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis \n \n8.  The major assumptions used to calculate the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) are: \n(i) all calculations are in 2004 prices, covering a period from 2005 to 2029; (ii) capital costs \ninclude all capital expenditures related to the construction and equipment for the expressway, \nbut exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) O&M includes all expenses \nincurred  in  operating  the  expressway,  but  excludes  depreciation  and  debt  repayment; \n(iv) operating revenues from tolls used in financial projections were adjusted to 2004 prices; and \n(v) the residual value of the expressway was estimated based on weighted depreciation of 3.4% \nper year. \n \n9.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after tax, in real terms was \ncalculated based on the capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as follows: \n(i) the applicable 10-year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% is used for \nADB debt; (ii) the estimated fixed interest costs of 5.76% per annum is used for the domestic \nloan funds; and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted \nto reflect the impact of income tax of 33%. The nominal cost of debt is converted to the real cost \nof debt by applying domestic and international average inflation rates for domestic and foreign \ncurrency denominated debt.  \n \n10.  The FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 6.1%.  This compares \nfavorably with the WACC, also computed on an after-tax basis, of 2.9% (Table 14.2).  The \nProject is considered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity tests indicate that the \nconditions causing the Project's viability to fall below WACC are unlikely to occur. The sensitivity \nof the Project's financial indicators to cost and revenue variations is shown in Table 14.3. \n \n ", "Table A14.1: Projected Financial Statements\n(CNY million)\nProject Year 2005

No    No \npartnership agreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC):  \n \nThe increasing income inequality between rural and urban areas, and western and eastern regions, is \namong the main concerns of the Government. Poor accessibility or isolation inhibits economic and social \ndevelopment. Research has shown that good roads are one of the most important types of infrastructure \nfor  poverty  reduction.  Good  roads  improve  access  for  the  poor  to  external  markets,  employment \nopportunities, and social services; lower transport costs of agricultural inputs and products; increase \ninteraction with other regions and provide opportunities to develop competitive advantages; and increase \nlocal employment opportunities due to increased economic activities in the project area, such as mining \nindustrial development, commercial agriculture, and tourism. The Project\u2019s local road component will \nreduce transport barriers and help add economic values to their fruits, vegetables, and livestock. The \ncomponent will also increase access to social and physical infrastructure services (e.g., health, education, \nwater, electricity, and telecommunications). The Project will create local employment opportunities for the \npoor, such as servicing local specialty foods and products and tourist information at the construction sites, \nservice areas, and roadside stations. Increased revenue from economic activities promoted by the Project \nwill enable the Government to spend more on social services. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                     Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?   \n  \nIn 2003, Gansu\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was CNY4,984, the second lowest among the \nPRC\u2019s provinces and autonomous regions, and about half of the national average. In the project area, per \ncapita GDP was even lower (CNY2,536), about one fourth of the national average. The total population in \nthe project area is 4.4 million, of whom 3.6 million people, or 82%, are project beneficiaries. Of the total \npopulation, 1.6 million people (36%) are poor, living on annual incomes less than CNY900 per capita for \nrural poverty (39%) and below the minimum living standards for urban poverty. About 1.1 million people or \n31% of the project beneficiaries are poor. This compares with the provincial rural poverty incidence of 40% \nbelow CNY900. Urban poverty ranged from 7% to 20.7% in five project counties in 2003. The causes of \npoverty in the project area include land degradation, a lack of water resources, a weak environment for the \nprivate sector and poor infrastructure and access. In the rural areas, poor and seasonally accessible roads \nprevent the timely delivery of goods and services, and discourage cash crop production. There is a need \nfor off-farm work and labor migration, which are among the main factors to lift the poor out of poverty. In \nurban areas, the main cause of poverty is lack of employment opportunities. The project area has the \npotential to develop cash crops such as fruits, as well as livestock, tourism, and coal mining. The project \nexpressway and local roads will improve access and will contribute to the removal of these development \nconstraints and promote social and economic development. Poverty reduction activities by government \nagencies (e.g., cash crop promotion, irrigation, and livestock activities) will complement the Project and \nthus  contribute  to  improving  the  trade  of  rural  poor  farmers  and  reducing  poverty.  With  the  project \nexpressway, other main highways, and rural roads, more investment and business activities are expected \nin the project area to help develop its economic and social potential. More employment will be created \nduring and after project construction either directly in construction and roadside service jobs or indirectly \nby economic development in the project area. The reduced time and transport cost saving from the local \nroads will benefit women and children by reducing their agricultural and household work and by improving \naccess to health and education. \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 15        57 \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes    No  \n \nStakeholder analysis was conducted during project preparation. The roles of each stakeholder group are \nwell defined. Gansu Provincial Communications Department (GPCD) is the Executing Agency (EA), and is \nresponsible for overall implementation of the Project. The project director will be responsible for overall \nproject management, and approval of contracts and payments. A project implementation unit established \nwithin  GPCD  will  monitor  implementation.  Local  governments,  local  communities,  and  relevant \nstakeholders will  assist  the  EA  in  implementing  the resettlement plan, monitoring and implementing \nenvironmental  mitigation  activities,  and  organizing  local  labor  for  the  expressway  and  local  road \nconstruction and operations, including service areas and roadside stations. The local roads component will \nbe implemented by the communications bureaus in the prefectures of Dingxi, Baiying, Pingliang, and \nQingyang, and will be supported by the subsidiary offices in the respective counties, and under the \nsupervision of GPCD. Complementary activities to enhance the social and poverty impacts of the Project \nwill be implemented by concerned agencies. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes                No \n \nDuring project preparation, socioeconomic surveys and public meetings were conducted among potential \nbeneficiaries to raise the level of awareness and gain local support. These processes enabled local \nstakeholders  to  express  their  opinions  and  to  make  relevant  suggestions  to  the  project  design  and \nimplementation. Consultations with the rural poor, women, minorities, and vulnerable groups were carried \nout during the project preparation socioeconomic survey on project impact and during local road selection. \nThe participatory activities are ongoing and will continue during project implementation. \n \nFor inclusion and selection of unskilled labor during  the road construction, contractors will consult with \ncounty poverty reduction offices, labor security bureaus, women\u2019s federations, and  villagers along the \nexpressway. Training will be provided as needed. During the detailed design and construction of the \nexpressway, local leaders from the affected villages and townships will be consulted in order to further \nminimize the loss of land and structures. For the  local roads component, villagers will provide unskilled \nlabor at local market rates. Service contractors at the roadside stations/service areas will be encouraged \nto employ local poor and to offer places for the sale of local products and services.  Local government \nresettlement offices and village committees will implement village rehabilitation plans.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nWomen play an important role in economic and agricultural activities as well as in the domestic sphere, \naccounting for 45% of the rural labor force in the project area. The Government promotes the social status \nof women; the legal framework requires women be given equal opportunities with men in respect of \neducation, employment, and political rights. The women\u2019s federations at county and township levels play a \nsignificant role in protecting the rights and interests of women. An analysis of the data from the household \nsurvey reveals no difference in traveling patterns between Han and Hui women.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?    Yes    No        \n \nThe Project will benefit young women by providing better access to off-farm employment. The Project will \nbenefit women with children by reducing their time required to go to the village markets for household, \nagricultural, and off-farm work. Women in general will benefit through improved access to health and \neducation, and increased employment opportunities in roadside services during and after the Project. \nWomen, including ethnic minorities, will be given priority for different enhancement measures as indicated \nin the Social Development Action Plan (SDAP). \n \n ", "58       Appendix 15 \nE.

The  resettlement  plan  covers  the  construction  of  an  expressway  between \nLuohandong and Dingxi, related connecting roads, and complementary local roads. The Gansu \nprovincial government has assured the Asian Development Bank (ADB) that the affected people \nfor the local roads will receive the same compensation and other assistance provided in the \nresettlement plan. The Gansu Provincial Communication Department (GPCD) is the Executing \nAgency. Once the detailed measurement survey is completed, the resettlement plan will be \nupdated, distributed to affected people, and submitted to ADB for concurrence. \n \n2.  The project expressway will affect 23 townships, 93 administrative villages, and 374 \nvillage groups in five counties (Jingchuan county, Kongtong district, and Jingning county in \nPingliang municipality, Huining county in Baiyin municipality, and Anding district in  Dingxi \nmunicipality). About 1,150 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired, 63% of which are farmland, \ncomprising paddy (16%) and dryland (47%), and 100 ha of land will be occupied temporarily. \nBased on per capita farmland in the affected villages, the farmland acquisition is equivalent to \n4,285 persons losing all of their farmland. Most people will in fact only lose part of their \nfarmland. For this project, it is estimated that the average loss is one-third, which means land \nacquisition will directly affect about 13,150 persons. About 55,612 square meters (m2) of houses \nwill be demolished, necessitating relocation of 520 households (2,350 persons). Most of these \nhouseholds will be moved a short distance to another site within their original village. All land, \nhousing, and other assets will be compensated at replacement value. The local road component \nmay also involve land acquisition, which will be reported in the updated resettlement plan. Due \ndiligence was carried out for the Ningxia section, linking two parts of the project expressway. \nThe report on the due diligence is annexed to the resettlement plan. \n \n3.  The resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better income and living standards \nin line with the PRC Land Administration Law (1998) and the ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement. GPCD will ensure that people losing land, housing, other assets, or income source \nwill be helped to fully restore their income and living standards. The land compensation rate will \nbe CNY12,000/mu for irrigated farmland; CNY6,000/mu for dry land and housing plots; and \nCNY1,900/mu for forest land. For demolished structures, the replacement value will be provided \nto  the  affected  households  based  on  compensation  rates,  which  range  from  CNY350\u2013\nCNY460/m2 for brick-concrete structures, CNY200\u2013CNY300/m2 for brick-wood structures, and \nCNY200/m2 for earth-wood structures. Households will be provided funds to purchase a new \nhousing  site  serviced  with  road,  electricity,  and  water  within  the  current  village  group  or \nadministrative village. There will be no reduction in compensation for depreciation and people \nwill be allowed to salvage materials from their old houses. Seventeen urban households will be \nrelocated and the compensation rate is in the range of CNY630\u2013CNY830/m2. GPCD will ensure \nthat compensation provided will be sufficient to purchase replacement housing. \n \n4.  Resettlement effects were minimized during project preparation after consultations \nwith local officials and local residents. Since the impacts are widely dispersed and per capita \nland holdings are relatively high, land-loss impacts are not serious and their effects can be \nmitigated. The resettlement plan includes economic rehabilitation plans for seriously affected \nvillages based on consultation with affected villagers. Affected people will be provided either \nwith direct compensation or replacement land through village land readjustment and new \nfarmland  development.  Those  villages  adopting  land  readjustment  could  utilize  the  land \ncompensation funds collectively to improve farm conditions, develop cash crops, and finance \nvarious nonfarm activities. New employment and income generation opportunities will arise \nonce the expressway and local roads are constructed. \n \n ", "60        Appendix 16 \n5.  GPCD will ensure that the resettlement entitlements are provided to the affected \npeople prior to demolition. Land compensation will be paid to the affected village groups or \nindividuals.  Housing  compensation  and  compensation  for  crops  and  other  assets  will  be \nprovided directly to people losing those assets. The resettlement plan has provisions for moving \nallowances.  Also,  expressway  contractors  will  be  requested  by  GPCD  to  give  priority  to \nresettlement-affected households in the allocation of unskilled jobs during construction. \n \n6.  A project resettlement office within GPCD will  be responsible for coordinating the \nplanning, implementation, financing, and reporting of resettlement for the expressway and local \nroads. Leading groups and resettlement offices will be established in each of the three cities \nand five affected counties. The county resettlement offices will have primary responsibility for \nresettlement consultation, implementation, and timely delivery of entitlements.  \n \n7.  Of the affected people, 557 (4.2% of affected persons) are Hui (Muslim minority). \nAmong 93 affected villages, only one village has 100% Hui population and three villages have \nmore than 10% Hui population. Since the Hui people are closely integrated in the current social \nsystem, the compensation and rehabilitation adopted for affected Hui people will be the same as \nthose for Han people. To respect their cultural customs and maintain their social relationships, \nall affected Hui people will be resettled within the same villages. For economically vulnerable \npeople, including the elderly living alone, the disabled, households headed by women, and very \npoor households, the Project will provide additional financial and physical support. About 407 \nhouseholds and 1,893 persons belong to this group and they will receive: (i) physical help in \nhousing construction and relocation free of charge, and (ii) a special subsidy to enable them to \nmaintain their living standards while constructing their houses. For this purpose, GPCD agreed \nto budget 1% of total resettlement cost. \n \n8.  The land acquisition and resettlement cost includes land compensation, resettlement \nsubsidy, payments for housing and other assets,  moving allowances, subsidy for vulnerable \ngroups,  fees  for  administration,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  GPCD  will  guarantee  to \nsupplement the resettlement budget to meet any shortfall that may occur. Land acquisition will \nbegin by April 2005 and will be completed by December 2006. Households will be relocated \nbetween April 2005 and October 2006. \n \n9.  The affected people have been notified about the key elements of the resettlement \nplan during meetings and interviews. Prior to implementation, there will be further consultations \narranged by township and village officials to discuss specific impacts on each village and how \nthey will be addressed. Villagers will have input in decisions on how to utilize the collective land \ncompensation funds. GPCD and relevant county resettlement offices distributed resettlement \ninformation booklets to all affected townships, villages and households on 12 August 2004. \nThere is a procedure to raise grievances and seek redress. \n \n10.  GPCD  will  engage  a  qualified  agency  to  carry  out  independent  resettlement \nmonitoring and evaluation. The monitoring agency will ascertain the extent to which the affected \npeople have (i) received their full entitlements on time, and (ii) fully restored their livelihoods, \nincome levels, and living standards. It will also conduct a baseline survey prior to resettlement, \nsemiannual investigations during resettlement, and annual survey updates for 2 years after the \ncompletion of resettlement. A quarterly reporting system is being established in the project \nresettlement office in GPCD and they will submit regular resettlement progress reports to ADB. \nGPCD will also provide ADB with copies of the independent monitoring and evaluation reports \nto be prepared twice a year during resettlement and once a year after resettlement completion. \nAlso, GPCD will prepare a resettlement completion report and submit it to ADB. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041222161514+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041122192047+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R251-04", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
