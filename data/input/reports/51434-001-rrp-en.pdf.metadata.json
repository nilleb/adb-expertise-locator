It  aims  to  increase  the  total  number  of  children  receiving  quality  3-year  early \nchildhood  education  (ECE)  in  Shangrao  Municipality,  which  lags  the  national  ECE  goals.  The \nproposed program is the first loan to comprehensively support a municipal ECE program and the \nthird results-based lending (RBL) program in the PRC\u2019s education sector. The program will be \nfully incorporated into the municipal government\u2019s upcoming Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u2013\n2025, and will provide essential support to narrow the gap in ECE outcomes between Shangrao \nand the rest of the PRC.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \nAlthough  the  PRC  has  achieved  remarkable  success  in  alleviating  poverty,  reducing \n3. \ninequality remains a challenge. Inequality reflects disparities in income and access to quality basic \nservices  between  rural  and  urban  areas  and  between  provinces  and  regions.  Whereas  high-\nquality  ECE  brings  social  and  economic  benefits,  especially  to  children  from  disadvantaged \nbackgrounds,  and  reduces  intergenerational  inequality  and  poverty,3 such  gains  have  largely \nbeen  unrealized  because  of  limited  access  to  quality  ECE,  particularly  in  rural  areas  and  for \ndisadvantaged  children.  Public  funding  for  ECE  is  generally  insufficient  and  depends  on  the \nmanagement and financing capacity of local governments, resulting in large disparities in per child \nfunding for ECE across municipalities and counties. Households bear the cost of ECE in the form \nof tuition and other fees regardless of whether ECE provision is public or private. This discourages \nlow-income families from enrolling children in ECE. Recognizing the gap, the Government of the \nPRC has been scaling up its efforts to expand the provision of 3-year ECE since 2010, through \nthe implementation of the first (2010\u20132013), second (2014\u20132016), and third (2017\u20132020) action \nplans  for  ECE  development  and  through  the  national  policy  on  ECE  reform  and  standardized \ndevelopment (2018).4 \n \nShangrao  is  one  of  the  11  municipalities  comprising  Jiangxi  Province,  located  in  the \n4. \nsoutheastern part of the PRC.5 With mountains and hills accounting for 75% of its total land area, \nShangrao remains largely rural with an urbanization rate of 52%. It ranked second lowest in gross \ndomestic product per capita (CNY36,836) among the 11 municipalities of Jiangxi Province in 2019. \n\n \n\n1  Communist Party of China Shangrao Municipal Committee and Shangrao Municipal People\u2019s Government. 2020. \nEarly Childhood Education Reform and Standardized Development Implementation Plan, 2020\u20132035.

Several Opinions on Deepening the \n\nReform and Standardized Development of Preschool Education, 2020\u20132035. Beijing. \n\n5  The  population  in  Shangrao  was  6.81  million  in  2018  (Shangrao  Municipal  Bureau  of  Statistics.  2020.  Shangrao \n\nStatistical Yearbook 2019. Shangrao). \n\n\fPer capita disposable income in rural areas has grown slowly to CNY13,346 in 2018, which is \nonly about one-third of that in urban areas (CNY34,656). The population living below the minimum \nliving standards (0.29 million or 4.3% of the total population) is concentrated in the rural areas. \nEthnic minorities (12,900 people or 0.19% of the total population) live mainly in the mountainous \nrural  areas.  Since  the  1990s,  Shangrao  has  seen  large  numbers  of  out-migrants,  mainly  from \nrural areas, to the surrounding municipalities with higher gross domestic product per capita, and \nconsequently, large numbers of children have been left behind by their parents. \n \nDespite  significant  progress  in  the  gross  enrollment  ratio  (GER)  in  3-year  ECE,  which \n5. \nincreased  from  72.1%  in  2017  to  80.3%  in  2019,6 access  to  quality  ECE  has  been  severely \nconstrained,  particularly  in  rural  areas.  The  public  provision  of  ECE  has  been  uneven  across \nShangrao and reached only 42.4% of all children enrolled in ECE in 2019. Filling a gap in public \nECE provision, private kindergartens have proliferated, accounting for 56.7% of all kindergartens \n(1,618 of 2,852). Yet the quality and affordability of private kindergartens vary considerably, with \nhigh-standard  private  kindergartens  in  urban  areas  charging  fees  more  than  four  times  higher \nthan public kindergartens, and substandard private kindergartens charging marginally higher fees. \nOut of growing concern over the accessibility, affordability, and quality of ECE, local governments \nsubsidize private kindergartens that meet their standards, while setting limits to the tuition fees \nthey  charge.  These  kindergartens  are  classified  as  \u201cinclusive\u201d  private  kindergartens,  and  they \nenroll 43.5% of all children in ECE. \n \n6. \nThe limited access to quality ECE in rural areas also stems from ECE teacher shortages \nand a lack of qualified ECE teachers. The ECE teacher\u2013child ratio in rural public kindergartens \nwas as high as 1:25.2, compared with the municipal average of 1:18.1 in 2019. Almost half of \nECE  teachers  (43.7%)  work  without  teaching  licenses.  Overall,  the  ECE  teaching  force  in \nShangrao  is  weak,  with  only  7.9%  of  ECE  teachers  holding  a  bachelor\u2019s  degree  and  above \n(compared  with  a  national  average  of  23.9%  in  2018)  and  43.4%  having  senior  secondary \neducation and below (compared with a national average of 18.1%). The main reason for the weak \nECE teaching force is low salaries and benefits, and challenging working conditions, which makes \nthe ECE teaching profession unattractive. Only 12.0% of ECE teachers, mostly working in public \nkindergartens in urban areas, have public employee status, while the rest work on a contractual \nbasis  without  the  benefits  enjoyed  by  public  employee  teachers  and  the  prospects  of  career \nprogression.7 ECE teacher turnover is high and many local ECE teachers choose to work outside \nShangrao to obtain better salaries, benefits, and working conditions. \n \n7. \nThe current systems for pre- and in-service ECE staff (teachers, principals, and childcare \nstaff)  are  incomplete.  The  national  ECE  curriculum  guidelines  are  yet  to  be  reflected  in  the \ncurriculum  of  ECE  teacher  preparation  programs.  Moreover,  existing  in-service  ECE  teacher \nprofessional  development  programs  do  not  meet  the  practical  needs  of  ECE  teachers \nimplementing the  national  curriculum  guidelines.  Although professional  development  programs \nfor principals exist, they are organized on an ad hoc basis and do not consider the fact that most \nprincipals were selected from primary schools without ECE experience. There are no in-service \nchildcare  staff  training  programs  in  Shangrao.  Competency  standards  for  ECE  teachers, \nprincipals, and childcare staff do not exist to ensure the quality of training programs and guide \ncontinuous professional development. \n\n \n\n6  Accordingly, the number of children enrolled in ECE increased from 224,597 in 2017 to 235,115 in 2019.  The national \nGER average was 81.7% in 2018, which is generally considered on track to achieve the national GER target of 85.0% \nby  2020.  (Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Ministry  of  Education.  2019.  Overview  of  Educational \nAchievement in China in 2018. Beijing. http://en.moe.gov.cn/documents/reports/201910/ t20191022_404775.html.) \n7  The structure of senior, intermediate, and junior ECE teacher positions that applies to public employee teachers is \n\nnot applicable to most nonpublic employee teachers. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fThe lack of qualified ECE teachers, principals, and childcare staff is compounded by the \n8. \nabsence  of  stimulating  learning  environments  rich  in  quality  ECE  support  and  resources, \nespecially in rural areas. As a result, the quality of ECE staff\u2013child interactions appear to be low, \nalthough  no  data  are  available  because  ECE  quality  assessment  and  monitoring  are  not \nconducted systematically  in Shangrao.  The  municipal  government\u2019s  plan  to  expand the  use  of \ninformation  and  communication  technology  platforms  in  ECE  has  the  potential  to  increase  the \nquality of ECE support and resources and facilitate systematic quality assessment and monitoring. \nIn addition to kindergarten-based programs, home-based ECE and community-based parenting \nprograms may be necessary because many left-behind children and other disadvantaged children \nin rural areas are less likely to receive stimulation, care, and protection from stress at home and \nto enroll in kindergartens. Other countries and other parts of the PRC have adopted such models, \ntargeting children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but they have not yet been implemented in \nShangrao. \n \n9. \nIn  April  2020,  the  municipal  government  approved  the  ECE  Reform  and  Standardized \nDevelopment Implementation Plan, 2020\u20132035 (footnote 1), drawing on the national ECE policy \n(footnote 4) and Jiangxi Provincial Government\u2019s ECE Reform and Standardized Development \nImplementation  Plan.  The  municipal  government\u2019s  ECE  program  aims  to  achieve  universal \ncoverage  of  3-year,  affordable,  safe,  and  quality  ECE  by  (i)  expanding  ECE  provision, \n(ii) improving  ECE  financing  mechanisms,  (iii)  strengthening  ECE  staffing  and  teaching  force, \n(iv) enhancing  ECE  management  systems,  (v)  improving  regulations  and  support  for  private \nkindergartens,  (vi)  enhancing  ECE  quality,  and  (vii)  establishing  adequate  ECE  governance \nmechanisms. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe program builds on the experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndevelopment  partners  with  ECE  and  RBL  programs  in  the  education  sector  in  the  PRC.8 The \nprogram reflects lessons learned, including the importance of targeting disadvantaged areas and \nchildren,  expanding  ECE  delivery  models  beyond  a  kindergarten-based  model,  assessing  the \nquality of ECE, and strengthening program monitoring and management systems.9 The program \nis in line with the strategic priority of supporting inclusive economic growth (reducing poverty and \ninequality) set out in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020.10 It will support \nthe following key operational principles and priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  approaches  to  upper  middle-income  countries:11 (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and \nreducing  inequalities  and  promoting  rural  development  by  improving  access  to  quality  ECE, \nespecially  in  rural  areas  and  for  disadvantaged  children;  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender \nequality by promoting girls\u2019 enrollment in 3-year ECE, labor force participation, and leadership for \n\nProgram Rationale \n\n \n\n8  World  Bank.  2016.

The  program  will  involve  more  than \n2,800 public  and  private  kindergartens  across  the  12  counties  and  districts  of  Shangrao,  and \npreservice  ECE  staff  preparation  program  providers.  The  municipal  government  shows  strong \nownership  of  the  program,  providing  $289.4  million (38.5%  of the  total  financing,  Table  4)  and \ncommitment \nfor  system \nto  results-based  planning  and  management  as  opportunities \nimprovement  and  institutional  strengthening,  which  have  been  demonstrated  in  the  ongoing \neducation sector RBL programs in the PRC (footnote 8). The Government of the PRC considers \nRBL  as  a means  to  push  its  reform  processes.  RBL  leverages  counterpart  resources  under  a \nsingle results framework and expands the development impact of ADB financing, which accounts \nfor  13.3%  of  the  total  program  financing.  Due  diligence  assessments  provide  assurance  for \neffective achievement of results through RBL, and measures to strengthen government program \nsystems are built into the program design.12 \n \nADB value addition. ADB\u2019s involvement in the municipal government\u2019s ECE program will \n12. \nadd value by driving policy and system reforms as laid out in the national ECE policy, which is still \nin  the  early  stages  of  implementation  across  the  country.  Drawing  on  more  than  25  years  of \nengagement  in  the  education  sector  in  the  PRC,13 ADB  will  bring  knowledge,  expertise,  and \nnational and international good practices to support the reforms ahead of the other provinces and \ncities;  and  will  develop  replicable  models  and  practices  in  areas  such  as  professional \ndevelopment  of  ECE  staff,  ECE  delivery,  pedagogy,  quality  assessment, and research.  These \nareas  are  also  where  global  evidence  remains scarce.  ADB  will  support  the  development  and \nregional  sharing  of  knowledge,  models,  and  practices  under  the  program  using  centers  of \nexcellence and knowledge platforms.14 ADB will design and conduct an impact evaluation study \nof selected program interventions on children\u2019s learning and developmental outcomes. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  RBL  program  will  be  a  time  slice  of  the  municipal  government\u2019s  ECE  program, \ncovering 2020\u20132025, and will focus on key interventions designed to improve access to quality \nECE, establish pre- and in-service ECE staff professional development systems, and strengthen \nECE program monitoring and management systems. The scope of the municipal government and \nRBL programs is summarized in Table 1. \n \n\nProgram Scope \n\n \n\n \n\n12 RBL is considered a suitable modality for programmatic interventions across extensive areas and covering a wide \nrange of activities that are difficult to deliver under a project loan. Unlike in a sector loan, key design elements of the \nRBL program, including capacity development and system strengthening, apply to the entire program. \n\n13 An  overview  of  ADB\u2019s  education  sector  operations since  1993  is  provided  in  Education  Sector  Operations  in the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n14 ADB  entered  into  a  knowledge  partnership  agreement  with  Peking  University  in  2018  to  develop  a  regional \nknowledge  base  in  education.  Since  2011,  ADB  has  organized  eight  international  skills  forums  to  exchange  and \nshare innovative practices and solutions in education. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fTable 1: Program Scope \n\nBroader Government Program \n\nUniversal coverage of 3-year, affordable, \nsafe, and quality ECE achieved \nProvision of ECE expanded, ECE financing \nmechanisms improved, ECE staffing and \nteaching force strengthened, ECE \nmanagement systems enhanced, regulations \nand support for private kindergartens \nimproved, and adequate ECE governance \nmechanisms established \n\nPhysical infrastructure improvement, \nenhanced regulations and support for private \nkindergartens, establishment of pre- and in-\nservice training systems for ECE staff, \nrecruitment of ECE teachers and childcare \nstaff, enhanced support systems for rural \nkindergartens, ECE research, and \ndevelopment of ECE quality assessment and \nmonitoring systems \n$3,350.4 million \n\nGovernment: $1,949.2 million, households \n(tuition and other fees): $959.2 million, ADB: \n$100.0 million, financing gap: $341.9 million \n\nShangrao Municipality \n\nResults-Based Lending Program \nChildren receiving quality 3-year ECE \nincreased \nProvision of affordable 3-year ECE \nincreased; systems for preparation and \nprofessional development of ECE \nteachers, principals, and childcare staff \nestablished; models and mechanisms for \nimproving the quality of ECE developed; \nand systems for assessing, monitoring, \nand ensuring the quality of ECE \nstrengthened \nSame as the broader government \nprogram, with a focus on key \ninterventions to improve access to and \nquality of ECE, establish pre- and in-\nservice ECE staff preparation and \nprofessional development systems, and \nstrengthen ECE program monitoring and \nmanagement systems \n\n$750.8 million \n\nGovernment: $289.4 million,a households \n(tuition and other fees): $240.1 million,a \nADB: $100.0 million, financing gap: \n$121.3 million \nShangrao Municipality \n\nItem \nOutcome \n\nKey outputs \n\nActivity types \n\nProgram \nexpenditure \nMain financiers \nand the respective \nfinancing amounts \n\nGeographic \ncoverage \nImplementation \nperiod \n\n2020\u20132035 \n\n2020\u20132025 \n\nProgram Results \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, ECE = early childhood education. \na  Excludes financing from Dexing City, Hengfeng County, and Yugan County. \nSources: ADB and Shangrao Municipal Government. \n \nD. \n \nThe  RBL  program\u2019s  impact  will  be  universal  coverage  of  quality  3-year  ECE  achieved \n14. \n(footnote 1). The outcome will be children receiving quality 3-year ECE increased. More children \nwill receive 3-year ECE (disbursement-linked indicator [DLI] 1), whose quality will be enhanced \nthrough improved ECE teacher\u2013child interactions (DLI 2). The program will have four outputs.15 \n \n15. \nOutput 1: Provision of affordable 3-year early childhood education increased. The \nprogram will improve access to affordable ECE by creating more spaces for children in public and \ninclusive private kindergartens. The percentage of children enrolled in public and inclusive private \nkindergartens  will  increase  (DLI  3).  The  program  will  also  alleviate  ECE  staff  shortages  by \nattracting and retaining qualified ECE staff through increased government-financed ECE teacher \nand childcare staff positions with better salaries and benefits (DLI 4). All children from families \nliving  below  the  minimum  living  standards  will  continue  to  benefit  from  government  financial \nassistance to receive 3-year ECE. \n \n16. \nOutput 2: Systems for preparation and professional development of early childhood \neducation teachers, principals, and childcare staff established. The program will support the \nestablishment of competency frameworks for ECE teachers, principals, and childcare staff, based \n\n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\non which ECE staff preparation and professional development programs will be updated or newly \ndeveloped. Candidates for ECE teachers and childcare staff who have completed competency-\nbased preservice education programs in Shangrao will increase (DLI 5). The majority of in-service \nECE staff will complete updated (for new and in-service ECE teachers) and newly developed (for \nprincipals  and  childcare  staff)  professional  development  programs  that  are  aligned  with  the \ncompetency  frameworks  (DLI  6).  Moreover,  through  those  updated  and  newly  developed \npreparation  and  professional  development  programs,  the  percentage  of  ECE  teachers  and \nprincipals who have passed the national teacher qualification exam and obtained an ECE teacher \nlicense will increase. \n \n17. \nOutput  3:  Models  and  mechanisms  for  improving  the  quality  of  early  childhood \neducation developed. The program will support research projects to be conducted by an ECE \nexpert  committee  established  under  the  Shangrao  Municipal  Bureau  of  Education  (SBE), \ncomprising ECE teachers and principals of model kindergartens, and researchers from colleges \nand universities, to address pressing issues with access to quality ECE in Shangrao. The program \nwill  also  support  the  development  and  activities  of  professional  learning  communities  led  by \nprovincial model kindergartens and involving ECE teachers, principals, and childcare staff from \nparticipating kindergartens, to reflect on and improve instructional, management and leadership, \nand  childcare  practices  as  a  mechanism  for  job-embedded  professional  development  (DLI  7). \nMoreover, the program will pilot play-based learning reform to engage children in deeper learning \nexperiences  (DLI  8)  and  community-based  parenting  programs  in  villages  to reach  out  to  left-\nbehind children and their caregivers, usually grandparents.16 \n \n18. \nOutput  4:  Systems  for  assessing,  monitoring,  and  ensuring  the  quality  of  early \nchildhood education strengthened. The program will introduce ECE quality assessment and \nmonitoring tools that focus on specific dimensions of ECE quality (program, and ECE teacher\u2013\nchild interactions)  associated  with  children\u2019s  learning  and developmental  outcomes.  It  will  also \nimprove  regulations  for  private  kindergartens  by  applying  strict  licensing  and  registration.  The \nprogram will expand the Smart Education Platform for primary and junior secondary schools to \ncover kindergartens for improved management and reporting (DLI 9).17 \n \n19. \nTo provide more focus on key results, nine DLIs have been selected and ambitious targets \nhave been set. Large portions (55%) of ADB financing will be allocated to outcome-level DLIs 1 \nand 2, which measure key dimensions of the program outcome\u2013\u2013improved access to and quality \nof 3-year ECE in Shangrao. By the end of the program, the GER will have increased to 88.0% \nfrom 80.3% in 2019, with 9,000\u201320,000 more children to be enrolled annually during the program \nimplementation  period.  The  quality  of  ECE  teacher\u2013child  interactions  will  be  enhanced  by \nimproving  the  ECE  teacher\u2013child  ratio,  especially  in  rural  public  kindergartens,  from  1:25.2  to \n1:15.0. The DLIs and their disbursement allocations are summarized in Table 2. \n\n \n\n \n\n16 Community-based parenting programs are initiatives based in communities to provide a set of resources or services \ndesigned  to  increase  the  capacities  of  parents,  grandparents,  and  other  caregivers  to  foster  children\u2019s  health, \ndevelopment, and education. \n\n17 The Smart Education Platform, developed and operated based on the WeChat platform by the Shangrao Municipal \nCenter  for  Educational  Technology  in  partnership  with  Tencent  Holdings  Ltd.,  provides  integrated  solutions  for \neducation management, online education, teacher research and collaboration, resource sharing, student\u2013teacher \nevaluation, school\u2013home communication, home\u2013school communication, and safety management. \n\n\fTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \n\nDisbursement \nAllocated ($ million) \n\nShare of Total ADB \nFinancing (%) \n\n  \n\n  \n\nIndicator \nOutcome \n1.

The government will finance $289.4 million, while households (tuition \nand other fees for public kindergartens) will contribute $156.4 million, and private kindergartens \n(mostly including tuition and other fees paid by households) will contribute $83.7 million. Loans \nfrom  commercial  banks  may  be  sought  to  fill  the  financing  gap.  The  government  will  fund  the \nprogram if loans or other financing cannot be obtained.18 The government has requested a regular \nloan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the program. The loan \n\n18 As the PRC and local governments continue to attach high priority to ECE, the government budgets for ECE have \nbeen  growing  steadily  in  Shangrao  and  are  expected  to  grow  further,  with  the  possibility  of  providing  additional \nfinancing. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fwill have a 26-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and program agreements. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 15.75 \nyears,  and  the  maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB  is  0.10%  per  year.

Disbursement  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to an account to \nbe designated by the government based on the verified achievement of DLIs. Financing of prior \nresults achieved not more than 12 months before loan signing will be applied to DLIs 1 and 9.19 \nThe municipal government\u2019s ECE program, which the RBL program will support, has been under \nimplementation since the beginning of 2020, and measuring the achievement of the program in \nthe  first  year  (DLI  1)  is  critical  to  gauge  the  level  of  efforts  needed  to  achieve  the  DLI  for  the \nsubsequent years. The quality, reliability, and timely availability of disaggregated data (DLI 9) are \nalso  crucial  to  monitor  the  program  performance  and  quickly  address  problems  as  they  arise. \nDisbursements are allowed for early or late achievement of DLIs. All DLIs should be achieved on \nor before the program completion date. Before the disbursement of loan proceeds, the municipal \ngovernment  will  prepare  and  submit,  after  approvals  by  the  relevant  government  agencies,  a \nwithdrawal application, along with evidence to support the achievement of the DLIs in accordance \nwith the verification protocols. \n \nF. \n \n25. \nThe program will support actions to ensure the achievement of its outcomes, including the \ndevelopment of measures to address issues with the accessibility of public and inclusive private \nkindergartens in urban, rural, and disadvantaged areas and improve the attractiveness of the ECE \nteaching  profession.  It  will  also  strengthen  the  program  systems,  notably,  monitoring  and \nevaluation  (M&E),  fiduciary,  and  safeguards  systems,  as  well  as  gender  and  social  inclusion. \nCapacity development activities are in the program action plan (PAP).20 \n \n\nCapacity Development and Program Action Plan \n\n19 The total amount of such financing will not exceed 20% of the total amount. \n20 PAP (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fImplementation Arrangements \n\nG. \n \n26. \nThe Shangrao Municipal Government is the executing agency. Although this will be the \nfirst  ADB  loan  for  the  municipal  government,  through  World  Bank-financed  projects,  it  has \ndeveloped and demonstrated solid capacity to manage and implement challenging projects. The \nSBE is the implementing agency and will implement and manage the program through its program \nmanagement office in coordination with the 12 county and district education bureaus (CEBs). By \nimplementing  the  three  action  plans  for  ECE  development  and  leveraging  partnerships  with \nShanghai Municipality,21 the SBE has proved its capability to quickly improve the GER to a level \nclose  to  the  national  and  provincial  averages  and  to  adopt  good  practices.  The  municipal \ngovernment has established a leading group for the utilization of foreign loans, comprising  the \nmunicipal  government,  the  Shangrao  Municipal  Bureau  of  Finance,  the  Shangrao  Municipal \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, the SBE, and other relevant bureaus, to provide strategic \nguidance  and  direction.  An  ECE  expert  committee  is  planned  to  be  set  up  under  the  SBE  to \nprovide technical guidance based on ECE research. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  municipal  government\u2019s  ECE  program  aims  to  implement  the  national  ECE  policy \n27. \n(footnote  4)  through  a  wide  range  of  interventions.  Technical  assessments  concluded  that  the \nECE system in Shangrao needs to (i) develop measures and models to address issues with the \naccessibility of kindergartens in addition to building new kindergartens; (ii) develop and strengthen \nthe  ECE  workforce,  while  improving  the  attractiveness  of  the  ECE  teaching  profession; \n(iii) support ECE teachers and childcare staff in interacting with children in more meaningful ways \nand improving children\u2019s learning and developmental outcomes; and (iv) introduce ECE quality \nassessment and monitoring. The program results framework, DLIs, and PAP incorporate these \nfindings. Analysis of historical and predicted revenues, budgets, and expenditures, and results \nachieved  in  the  past  several  years  confirmed  that  the  program  expenditure  framework  and \nfinancing plan are robust. \n \nEconomic analysis. The benefits of quality ECE last a lifetime as it provides a basis for \n28. \nhuman  capital  accumulation  and  higher  labor  productivity,  and  improves  long-term  health \noutcomes. In rural areas, where many children are left behind when their parents migrate to work \nelsewhere and are cared for by their grandparents or other caregivers, quality ECE that provides \nnurturing care and support is essential. Parents who cannot rely on other caregivers also benefit \nfrom  ECE  as  they  can  free  up  their  time  to  work.  The  measurable  economic  benefits  of  the \nprogram include (i) increased lifetime earnings of children receiving ECE who are likely to achieve \nhigher educational attainment, and (ii) improved lifetime earnings of their parents whose time to \ntake care of children is freed up with the availability of ECE services. The program is deemed \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 8.3%, higher than the minimum \nrequired discount rate of 6.0% for social sector projects. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken for \na 20% reduction in benefits and a 20% increase in costs to reflect the potential impacts of the \ncoronavirus  disease (COVID-19)  pandemic.  Under  this  scenario, the  economic internal  rate of \nreturn drops to 6.8%.22 \n \n\n21 Shangrao  Municipal  Government  entered  into  a  partnership  agreement  with  Shanghai  Municipal  Government  to \n\nreceive support for ECE development in March 2018.  \n\n22 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f29. \nPoverty, social, and gender. The program has a strong pro-poor and gender focus. It will \nbenefit children from low-income families, disadvantaged backgrounds, and rural areas who are \nless  likely  to  receive  stimulation,  care,  and  protection  from  stress  at  home  and  to  enroll  in \nkindergartens.  Gender  analysis  revealed  gender  bias,  including  unreported  or  delayed \nregistration of female births; and a higher likelihood of girls enrolling in ECE later than the age of \n3, dropping out, or not enrolling at all. Moreover, because of gender stereotypes in childcare, and \nthe  low  salaries  and  social  status  of  the  ECE  profession,  men  are  underrepresented  in  ECE \nworkforce.  The  program  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  program  results \nframework,  DLIs,  and  PAP  include  gender  targets  and  actions  to  address  the  gender  gaps  in \nenrollment and ECE staff preparation and professional development. The program will enhance \nthe attractiveness of ECE profession by improving salaries, benefits, and working conditions; and \nproviding professional development opportunities and support for ECE staff. \n \n30. \nImpact  of  coronavirus  disease.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  led  to  the  closure  of \nkindergartens  and  loss  of  jobs  and  household  incomes,  which  have  negatively  impacted,  in \nparticular, the operation of private kindergartens and the ability of households to pay tuition and \nother fees for ECE. The program will ensure the affordability and availability of space for children \nin  both  public  and  private  kindergartens,  especially \nfamilies, \ndisadvantaged  backgrounds,  and  rural  areas;  and  the  quality  of  ECE  in  the  context  of  post-\npandemic recovery where the municipal government\u2019s revenues, budgets, and expenditures may \nhave been affected.23 By ensuring that children receive ECE in kindergartens, their parents, in \nturn, will be able to work and restore household incomes. \n\nlow-income \n\nthose \n\nfrom \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n31. \nClimate change impact. The climate risk and vulnerability assessment concluded that \nthe  overall  climate  change  impact  on  the  program  is  low  but  identified  intense  precipitation \ncausing  potential  damage  to  construction  sites  and  flooding  as  risks.  Kindergartens  and  other \nfacilities  to  be  supported  under  outputs  1  and  2  will  adopt  flood  resilience  measures,  such  as \nalarm systems and evacuation equipment, as climate adaptation measures. By conserving and \nreusing existing buildings instead of constructing new ones and adopting renewable energy (solar \nwater heaters) and one-star green building standards, the program will reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions by 381 tons per annum.24 \n \nB. \n \n32.  Monitoring and evaluation system. The program M&E systems assessment confirmed \nthat,  in  general,  robust  M&E  arrangements  for  ECE  exist,  although  the  following  weaknesses \nwere  identified:  (i)  lack  of  reliable  data  on  the  number  of  children  aged  3\u20136  because  of  out-\nmigration and other reasons, which affects the method of calculating the GER; (ii) lack of data on \nout-of-kindergarten children and children that have difficulty accessing kindergartens; (iii) lack of \ndata  on  unregistered  private  kindergartens;  and  (iv)  limited  quality,  reliability,  and  timely \navailability  of  data  disaggregated  by  lower  administrative  unit.  The  program  will  support  the \nupgrading of the Smart Education Platform for primary and junior secondary education to cover \nkindergartens  (DLI  9).  The  achievement  of  the  outcome  and some output  DLIs  will  be  verified \nthrough  independent  third-party  verification  in  accordance  with  the  verification  protocols.  The \n\n \n\n23 Kindergartens  in  Shangrao  gradually  started  to  reopen  in  late  May  2020  with  strict  health,  hygiene,  and  social \ndistancing measures. Since the municipal government commenced its preparation work for the program before the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and plans to start registering children for the next school year as usual following the reopening \nof kindergartens, no significant effects on the prior results are expected.  Therefore, there is no need to adjust the \nmunicipal government\u2019s ECE program or the RBL program. \n\n24 Climate  Change  Assessment,  and  Climate  Risk  and  Vulnerability  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fselection of an independent verification agency will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval to ensure \nthat the selected agency has no conflict of interest with the municipal government or the SBE and \ndemonstrates  experience  and  capacity  to  conduct  scientifically  rigorous  evaluation  and/or \nresearch  in  the  education  and/or  ECE  sector.  The  qualification  requirements  and  tasks  of  the \nverification  agency  are  in  the  program  implementation  document. 25  The  PAP  includes  the \npreparation  of  an  M&E  manual,  regular  training  of  staff  responsible  for  M&E,  the  conduct  of \nstudies on out-of-kindergarten and left-behind children, and the collection of disaggregated data. \n \nFiduciary systems. The RBL program will use the financial management, procurement, \n33. \nand  anticorruption  systems  for  ECE  in  Shangrao.  The  program  fiduciary  systems  assessment \nconfirmed that the SBE and the CEBs have adequate financial management systems and staff \ncapable  of  carrying  out  budgeting,  accounting,  financial  reporting,  payment,  and  cash \nmanagement tasks. There is room for improvement in internal controls, which are mainly geared \ntoward transactions and give insufficient attention to the efficiency and effectiveness of fund use. \nThe financial management capacity of the CEBs is low, especially in relation to timely preparation \nand submission of consistent financial statements. The program fiduciary systems assessment \nalso  confirmed  that  the  procurement  framework  in  place  is  aligned  with  the  principles  of \ncompetition, efficiency, economy, transparency, fairness, and equal opportunities, in line with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). Staff involved in procurement at \nthe SBE and the CEBs are generally experienced in the procurement of civil works (kindergarten \nand school buildings) and goods, while they are less experienced in procurement of consulting \nand  nonconsulting  services.  The  RBL  program  will  exclude  high-value  procurement  packages \nand  contracts.  The  Guidelines  to  Prevent  or  Mitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited \nActivities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for  Programs  were  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment and the Shangrao Municipal Government.26 The PAP includes actions to strengthen \nthe fiduciary systems. \n \n34. \nSafeguard  systems.  The  RBL  program  is  categorized  B  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  safeguards.  Outputs  1  and  2  will  involve  civil  works  on \npublic or collective lands or within existing kindergarten premises that may have some temporary \nand site-specific environmental impacts, and potential involuntary resettlement impacts. Outputs \n3 and 4 will not trigger environmental or involuntary resettlement impacts. Considering the nature \nand size of the kindergarten facilities to be included under the program, the environmental and \nsocial impacts are deemed insignificant.27 Any physical activities that may be classified category \nA for the ADB environment and involuntary resettlement safeguards are excluded from the RBL \nprogram.  The  ethnic  minority  population  of  Shangrao  is  well  integrated  into  the  majority  Han \npopulation  and  has  no  specific  issues  with  access  to  ECE,  except  for  the  She  ethnic  minority \ngroup for whom distance from home to kindergartens and the language may be barriers. While \nno adverse impacts on the She ethnic minority population are expected, the PAP includes actions \nto enhance the benefits for the She ethnic minority population. The program safeguard systems \nassessment  (PSSA)  confirmed  that  the  programmatic,  institutional,  and contextual  risks  of  the \nprogram will not be significant and that the municipal government, the SBE, and the CEBs have \nadequate  capacity  to  manage  the  social  and  environmental  risks  associated  with  the  RBL \nprogram activities. \n \n35. \nThe PSSA identified the following gaps: (i) lack of institutional arrangements and staffing \nfor  environmental,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  safeguards;  (ii)  lack  of \n\n \n\n25 Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. 2013.
