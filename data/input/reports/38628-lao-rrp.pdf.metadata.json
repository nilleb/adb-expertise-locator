An initial environmental examination was prepared. \n\n \nThe  project  will  (i)  construct  398  kilometers  (km)  of  115-kilovolt  (kV) \ntransmission  lines  with  associated  115/22 kV  substations,  and  erect \nabout 1,100 km of new 22 kV medium- and low-voltage distribution lines \nto  expand  access  to  grid  electricity  to  consumers  in  western  Vientiane, \nXaignabouli,  and  Phongsali  provinces  of  the  Lao  PDR;  (ii)  provide  no-\ninterest  credit  to  poor  households  in  the  project  areas  to  help  them \nconnect  to  the  distribution  grid;  and  (iii)  provide  consulting  services, \nincluding a project implementation consultant to Electricite du Laos (EDL) \nand advisory services to the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM).  \n \nThe  construction  of the  transmission  and  distribution facilities  comprises \nthree  modules.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance \nmodule 1,  and  Korea  Eximbank  will  finance  modules  2  and  3.  Module  1 \nconsists of (i) a 98 km single-circuit 115 kV transmission line from Paklay \nto Nonhai, and (ii) a 74.6 km single-circuit 115 kV transmission line from \nPaklay to the Lao PDR\u2013Thailand border near Kenthao for interconnection \nwith  the  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT)\u2013Provincial \nElectricity Authority via the Thali substation in Loei province in Thailand. \nModule 1 will also construct a new 115kV/22kV substation at Paklay and \nexpand two existing 115kV/22kV substations at Nonhai and Xaignabouli. \nThe  cross-border  interconnection  between  Paklay  (Lao  PDR)  and  Thali \n(Thailand)  will  facilitate  power  trading  between  the  EDL  and  EGAT\u2013\nProvincial Electricity Authority systems. \n \nThe  project  under  module  2  will  extend  a  new  115 kV  transmission \nnetwork from the proposed Paklay substation to be built under module 1 \nnorthward to the existing Xayabury substation, where it will connect with \nEDL's  transmission  network.  Module  3  will  consist  of  a  115  kV \ntransmission  line  linking  the  existing  Namo  substation  in  Oudomxai \nprovince with a new substation at Boun Nua in Phongsali province. Under \nmodules  2  and  3, the  project  will  erect  distribution  lines  emanating from \nNonhai, Paklay, Xayabury, Namo, and Boun Nua substations. \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFor the Lao PDR, poverty reduction and improvement of living standards \nare  important  development  goals  that  are  not  achievable  without  the \nprovision of basic essential services such as access to education, health \ncare, clean water, and electricity. Of the total 960,000 households in the \ncountry,  about  560,000  (58%)  have  access  to  electricity.  In  Xaignabouli \nprovince, only 50% of households are electrified, which is lower than the \nnational  average.  Phongsali  province  has  the  lowest  percentage  of \nelectrified  households  in  the  country\u2014only  13%.  Poverty  is  widespread \nwhere  electricity  is  not  made  available  to  households.  For  example,  in \nPhongsali  province,  60%  of  households  are  considered  poor,  while  in \nsome  districts  of  Xaignabouli  province, \nthe  percentage  of  poor \nhouseholds  is  as  high  as  50%.  Recognizing the  importance  of  provision \nof  electricity  for  poverty  reduction  and  for  raising  living  conditions,  the \ngovernment  has  set  a  target  of  electrifying  70%  of  total  households  by \n2010, 80% by 2015, and 90% by 2020.  \n \nA  strong  transmission  and  distribution  (T&D)  network  nationwide  is \nnecessary  to  ensure  reliable  electrical  supply  to  the  population  and  to \nachieve  the  electrification  targets.  Presently,  the  T&D  network  of  EDL \ndoes  not  cover the  entire  country.  For  example, Phongsali  province  and \nparts of Xaignabouli are not covered by EDL's T&D system.  \n \nThe  ADB-financed  Northern  Area  Rural  Power  Distribution  Project  is \ncurrently  building \nfrom \nthe  T&D  system  covering \nLouangphrabang Phrabang to Oudomxai and onward to Louang-Namtha. \nAt  Louangphrabang  it  interconnects  with  the  existing  Nam  Ngum  1 \ntransmission  system  that  covers  Vientiane  capital  and  central  region  of \nthe Lao PDR. This project will construct the much needed T&D system in \nXaignabouli and Phongsali provinces and in western Vientiane province. \nTogether with previous ADB-financed projects, it will help gradually build \nup  a  nationwide  T&D  system  to  allow  the  government  reach  the  rural \nelectrification and poverty reduction goal. \n \nConsumers  in  Phongsali  province  currently  rely  on  limited  electricity \nimports  from  the  People's  Republic  of  China  or  from  individual  privately \nowned  diesel  generation  sets.  Similarly,  consumers  in  Xaignabouli \nprovince  rely  on  electricity  imports  from  Thailand.  Electricity  imports  in \nthese  two  provinces  are  supplied  at  22  kV  and  are  more  expensive \n($0.08 per kilowatt-hour [kWh]) than EDL's supply (about $0.05 per kWh). \nBut  more  importantly,  many  households  still  do  not  have  access  to \nimported \nelectricity.  Currently,  a  22 kV \nelectricity  from  Thailand  to  southern  Xaignabouli  province.  Once  the \nproject's  115 kV  cross-border  interconnection  line  is  built,  it  will  replace \nthe  current  22  kV  transmission  line  used  for  power  import.  This  115 kV \ncross-border  interconnection  will  have  a  much  higher  load-carrying \ncapacity  and  lower  voltage  drop;  hence,  it  will  deliver  a  higher  quality \nelectricity  supply.  The  115  kV  interconnection  can  be  utilized  for  both \nimport  and  export  of  electricity.  Such  a  two-way  power  trade  will  be \npossible  and  beneficial  to  the  Lao  PDR  and  Thailand  by  making  use  of \nthe seasonal variations of hydro energy. \n \n\nline  provides \n\ntransmission \n\nthe  area \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\nDuring  the  wet  season  (August\u2013October),  hydropower  is  normally \nabundantly available in the Lao PDR, and EDL has excess capacity. With \nthe  project,  excess  power  can  be  exported  to  Thailand,  offsetting \nelectricity generated from fossil fuel there. On the other hand, during the \ndry  season  (April\u2013May)  when  EDL  experiences  power  shortages,  it  can \nimport electricity from Thailand through the 115 kV transmission line from \nthe  Thali  substation  to  supply  Xaignabouli  province,  thereby  ensuring  a \nreliable supply of electricity to consumers. In addition, the interconnection \nallows  the  two  systems  to  back  each  other  up  during  line  maintenance \nand power outages. \n \nThe  cross-border  interconnection  under  the  project  has  received  strong \nsupport  from  both  governments  and  from  EDL  and  EGAT.  On  13  May \n2009,  the  governor  of  EGAT  and  the  managing  director  general  of  EDL \nsigned a memorandum of understanding in Bangkok officially announcing \nthe agreement for the proposed interconnection. The interconnection line, \nto  be  built  under  the  project  and  the  ongoing  Northern  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) Transport Network Improvement Project to improve the \nroads  from  the  Lao  PDR\u2013Thailand  border  along  Xaignabouli  province \nand northward to Louangphrabang, will accelerate economic cooperation \nactivities  and  cross-border  trade  between  northeast  Thailand  and \nXaignabouli  province.  According  to the  National  Economic  Development \nBoard of Thailand, this corridor is one of the priority areas for Thailand\u2019s \nofficial  development  assistance  to  the  Lao  PDR  because  of  the  strong \nin  commercial  agriculture \ninterest  of  Thailand\u2019s  private  sector \ndevelopment. Availability of a reliable supply of electricity is essential for \nbusiness in the project area. \n\nThus, the project supports the government's rural electrification program \nby  building  a  nationwide  unified  T&D  system  for  EDL,  particularly  in \nPhongsali  and  Xaignabouli  provinces,  with  cross-border  interconnection \nbetween the EDL and EGAT systems. Of the 18,800 new households in \nthe  two  provinces  to  be  provided  access  to  electricity,  more  than  6,000 \nare poor households and will receive financial support for connections to \nthe  grid.  Reliable  supply  of  electricity  will  not  only  improve  living \nconditions  of  the  population  but  also  boost  economic  activities  in  the \nproject area. In the long term, as more hydropower capacity is added to \nEDL's system, and power demands on both side of the border grow, this \ninterconnection  will  bring  further  benefits  to  consumers  in  the  Lao  PDR \nand Thailand. \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome  The impact will be the realization of the government's goal of electrifying \n90%  of  the  country\u2019s  households  by  2020.  The  household  electrification \nrate in the project area (Phongsali and Xaignabouli provinces combined) \nwill increase from 39% in 2009 to 79% in 2020.  \n \nThe  outcome  will  be  increased  access  to  reliable  electricity  supply  for \nhouseholds,  villages,  and  towns  within  the  project  area.  About  18,800 \nnew  households  (among  them  about  6,000  poor  households)  in  the \nproject area will be supplied with reliable grid electricity. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProject Investment \nPlan  \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\nThe  investment  cost  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  $65.32  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $3.18 million.  \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nGovernment of the Republic of Koreaa  \nElectricite du Laos \nTotal \na Through Export\u2013Import Bank of Korea. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n20.00 \n37.88 \n7.44 \n65.32 \n\nShare of \ntotal (%) \n30.6 \n58.0 \n11.4 \n100.0 \n\n \n \nThe government will make the proceeds of the ADB grant and the Korea \nEximbank loan available to EDL subject to the subsidiary loan agreement \nand project agreement. \n \nThe project will have a 4-year utilization period from the time of approval.   \n \nJune 2013 \n\n \nEDL will implement the project. \n\n \nEDL \n \nAll procurement to be financed by ADB will be carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime)  and  the  procurement  plan  prepared  and  agreed  to  by  the \ngovernment  and  ADB.  The  threshold  limits  to  be  followed  under  the \nprocurement  plan  are  (i) international  competitive  bidding  for  (a)  supply \ncontracts estimated to cost above $500,000, and (b) civil works contracts \nabove $1 million; (ii) national competitive bidding for (a) works contracts \nbetween  $100,000  and  $1 million,  and  (b)  supply  of  goods  between \n$100,000  and  $500,000;  and  (iii) shopping  procedures  for  supply  of \ngoods  contracts  less  than  $100,000.  All  procurement  contracts  will \ncontain  anticorruption  provisions  as  specified  by  ADB.  Procurement  for \nworks and equipment and materials financed under the Korea Eximbank \ncofinancing will be carried out in accordance with the Korea Eximbank's \nprocurement procedures. These procedures were discussed and agreed \nwith the government and EDL. ADB shall be satisfied that the procedures \nused for the Korea Eximbank-financed procurement will be used to fulfill \nthe borrower's obligations to cause the project to be carried out diligently \nand  efficiently,  and  that  the  goods  and  works  to  be  procured  (i)  are  of \nsatisfactory quality and compatible with the balance of the project; (ii) will \nbe  delivered  or  completed  in  a  timely  fashion;  and  (iii)  are  priced  so  as \nnot  to  affect  adversely  the  economical  and  financial  viability  of  the \nproject. \n \n\n \nConsulting Services  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  assist  EDL  in \nimplementing  the  project.  The  firm  will  be  responsible  for  assisting  the \n\n\f \n\nv \n\nproject  management  unit  implement  the  whole  project  (both  ADB  and \nKorea  Eximbank  financing),  particularly  in  (i)  procuring  goods  and \nservices  for  the  ADB-financed  component;  (ii) supervising  construction \nand  installation;  (iii)  completing  system  final  testing  and  commissioning; \n(iv) conducting social and environmental assessment, management, and \nmonitoring;  (v) strengthening  EDL  capacity  in  social  and  environmental \nassessment,  management,  and  monitoring;  (vi) undertaking  project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation; and (vii) reporting on the project. \nThe  firm  will  provide  175  person-months  of  consulting  services  (80 \nperson-months  by  international  and  95  person-months  by  national \nexperts)  following  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (ratio  80:20) \nand using full technical proposal procedures. Advance recruitment will be \nused for the project implementation consultant. However, ADB support of \nadvance recruitment of consultants does not commit ADB to approve the \nproject nor to finance the recruitment costs. A procurement specialist will \nbe  recruited  under  Korea  Eximbank  financing  to  help  EDL  in  the \nprocurement process of Korea Eximbank-financed packages. In addition, \na senior advisor will be recruited to provide EDL and MEM with strategic \nissues related to energy sector development. All consultants under ADB \nfinancing  will  be  selected  and  engaged  under  the  project  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nThe  significant  benefits  of  the  project  are  expansion  of  EDL's  T&D \nnetwork and increased access of grid electricity to rural poor households \nand  new  businesses  in  the  remote  provinces  of  the  Lao  PDR.  About \n18,800  new  households,  including  more  than  6,000  poor  households  in \nPhongsali and Xaignabouli provinces, will be connected to the grid. This \nis  a  very  important  condition  for  improving  living  standards  for  rural \npopulations  in  these  provinces.  Availability  of  reliable  electricity  will \nincrease  income-earning  opportunities  for  the  poor  and  boost  economic \ngrowth and social development in Xaignabouli and Phongsali provinces.  \n \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  evaluated  at  42%.  The  financial \ninternal rate of return, estimated at 11.5% after tax, exceeds the weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  (2.7%).  The  project  will  also  generate  moderate \nemployment during its implementation.  \n \nWith the cross-border interconnection between the Paklay substation and \nthe Thali substation, consumers in Xaignabouli province will be provided \nwith a more reliable and better quality electricity supply, and at the same \ntime,  consumers  in  Loei  Province  in  northern  Thailand  will  benefit  from \nhydroelectricity  imported  through  the  Thali  substation.  Reliability  of  both \nEDL and Provincial Electricity Authority systems will be improved.  \n \nMEM is another beneficiary of the project; it will be assisted by a resident \nadvisor  in  making  informed  policy  decisions  on  the  development  of  the \nenergy  sector  as  a  whole,  including  power  system  development, \ntendering of IPPs, negotiation of power purchase agreements, renewable \nenergy strategy, and energy efficiency and conservation policy.  \n \n\n \n\n \nProject  Benefits  and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nThe project is not expected to face any significant technical risks. State of \nthe art technology is widely available. EDL has good experience and has \nperformed  well  in  implementing  similar  T&D  projects.  In  particular,  EDL \nmanagerial  skill  and  capacity  for  such  projects  have  improved  through \nimplementation of the ongoing ADB-financed Northern Area Rural Power \nDistribution Project.  \n \nSmooth  coordination  between  packages financed  by  the  ADB grant  and \nthe  Korea  Eximbank  loan  is  critical  to  the  success  of  the  project.  To \nensure  coordinated \nthe  project  design  envisages \nengaging  one  project  implementation  consultant  to  help  EDL  take \nmeasures to ensure procurement is undertaken diligently and efficiently, \nand in overseeing implementation of all three project modules.  \n\nimplementation, \n\n\fo\n101  00'E\n\nLAO PEOPLE\u2019S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\nGREATER MEKONG SUBREGION\nNORTHERN POWER TRANSMISSION PROJECT\n\nN\n\n50\n\n0\n\n100\n\n22  00'No\n\nKilometers\n\nPEOPLE\u2019S\nREPUBLIC OF\nCHINA\n\n(3) 102 km\n\nBoun Nua S/S\n\nPHONGSALI\n\n.\n\nm\nk\n \n2\n0\n1\n\nM Y A N M A R\n\nLouang-Namtha\n\nLOUANG-NAMTHA\n\nNamo S/S\n\nM EK O N G RIVER\n\nNam Ko\n(1.5 MW)\n\nOudomxai\n\n102  00'Eo\n\n106  00'Eo\n\nPHONGSALI\n\nLOUANG-\nNAMTHA\n\nLAO PEOPLE\u2019S\nDEMOCRATIC\nREPUBLIC\n\nBOKEO\n\n20  00'No\n\nOUDOMXAI\n\nHOUAPHAN\n\no\n20  00'N\n\nLOUANGPHRABANG\n\nXIANGKHOUANG\n\nXAIGNABOULI\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nBOLIKHAMXAI\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nVIENTIANE\nMUNICIPAL\n\nKHAMMOUAN\n\no\n16  00'N\n\no\n22  00'N\n\n102  00'Eo\n\n104  00'Eo\n\nSAVANNAKHET\n\nSALAVAN\n\nCHAMPASAK\n\no\n16  00'N\n\nXEKONG\n\nATTAPEU\n\n106  00'Eo\n\nProposed 115 kV Transmission Line\n(1): Module 1, (2): Module 2, (3): Module 3\n\nAsian Development Bank\nOngoing Project (115 kV)\n\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation\nOngoing Project (115 kV)\n\nPrivate Sector Funded\n\nExisting 115 kV Transmission Line\n\nNational Capital \n\nHydropower\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nSubstation (existing/ongoing/proposed)\n\nPakmong\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nHouayxay S/S\n\nChiang Kong S/S\n\nTHAILAND\n\nBOKEO\n\nOUDOMXAI\n\nLOUANGPHRABANG\n\nHOUAPHAN\n\nNam Dong\n(1 MW)\n\nLouangphrabang\n\n Ngeun S/S\n\nHongsa S/S\n\nXiang-Ngeun\n\nXIANGKHOUANG\n\nPhonsavan\n\n18  00'No\n\n(2) 123 km\n\nXayabury\n\nXAIGNABOULI\n\nVang Vieng\n\nMEKONG RIVER\n\n98 km.\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nBan Don\n\nThalat\n\nPhonhong\n\nNonhai\n\nNaxaythong\n\nPaklay S/S\n\nNam Ngum 1\n(155 MW)\n\nNam Leuk\n(60 MW)\n\nNam Mang 3\n(80 MW)\n\nThangone\n\nKhoksa-at\n\nThanaleng\n\nPhontong\n\nVIENTIANE\n\nV I E T  N A M\n\n18  00'No\n\nPakxan\n\nBOLIKHAMXAI\n\nBung Kan\n\nM\n\nE\n\nK\n\nTheun Hin Boun\n(210 MW)\n\nO\n\nN\n\nG\n\n \n\nR\n\nI\n\nV\n\nE\n\nR\n\nKHAMMOUAN\n\n(1) 75 km\n\nVIENTIANE MUNICIPAL\n\nKenethao\n\n(1) 98 km\n\nThali S/S\n\nNong Khai\n\n101  00'Eo\n\n(1) 12 km\n\nT H A I L A N D\n\n104  00'Eo\n\n09-2337 HR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nNorthern Power Transmission Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic Performance \n\n2. \nDuring 2001\u20132008, the Lao economy grew at an average 6.5% per annum, with highest \ngrowth  of  7.9%  in  2007.1 Agriculture  is  the  largest  contributor  to  the  economy  accounting  for \nalmost  45%  of  the  gross  domestic  product  followed  by  industry  (30%)  and  services  (25%). \nHowever, industry is the fastest growing sector with average annual growth of more than 12%, \nwhereas services have been expanding at about 7.5% and agriculture at 3.5% per annum since \n2004.  \n \nThe country's 6th National Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 emphasizes \n3. \neradication of poverty and accelerating the pace of socioeconomic development as the nation\u2019s \nmost important long-term strategic goals.2 It mainstreams priority sectors, including agriculture, \nhealth,  education,  and  infrastructure.  Development  of  these  sectors  will  directly  contribute  to \nrealization of the agenda for poverty reduction: (i) expansion of economic opportunities, with an \nemphasis  on  commercial  agriculture,  rural  development,  infrastructure  development,  and \nsupport for small and medium-sized enterprises; (ii) improved provision of basic social services \nwith  a  focus  on  health,  education,  and  clean  drinking  water;  (iii)  stronger  human  security, \nincluding  measures  aimed  at  fostering  food  security,  reducing  threats  from  unexploded \nordnance, and ensuring protection against natural disasters; (iv) enhanced participation by and \nempowerment of the poor; and (v) concentrated efforts to develop the poorest areas through a \nrange of targeted interventions. The 6th plan envisages an acceleration of average annual real \ngross domestic product growth to 7.5%.  \n \n4. \nIn  the  medium  term,  development  of  energy  and  power  will  be  central  to  infrastructure \ndevelopment  in  the  country.  Power  infrastructure  development  will  (i)  ensure  the  supply  of \naffordable  electricity\u2014a  basic  need\u2014for  the  entire  population;  and  (ii)  create  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  (a)  significantly  improving  living  conditions,  (b)  generating  incomes,  and  \n(c) continuing economic growth. \n \n\n2. \n\nPower System Performance \n\n \n5. \nThe power system serves two vital purposes: (i) providing electricity to meet increasing \ndomestic  demand;  and  (ii)  earning  hard  currency  revenues  by  exporting  electricity  to \nneighboring  countries.  Electricite  du  Laos  (EDL)\u2014a  state-owned  utility\u2014is  responsible  for \nsupplying electricity for consumers in the country. Currently, EDL-installed generating capacity \ntotals  330  megawatts  (MW)  (98%  hydro-based  capacity  and  2%  small  diesel-based  capacity). \n\n                                                \n1  The government recognizes that gross domestic product this year will slow to 5% due to the global economic crisis. \n2   Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment.  2006.  National \n\nSocio-Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010). Vientiane. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nSeveral of EDL's large hydropower plants (HPPs) are Nam Ngum 1 HPP (150 MW), Nam Leuk \nHPP  (60  MW),  Xeset  1  HPP  (45 MW),  and  Nam  Mang  3  HPP  (40  MW).  Three  HPPs  are \npresently  under  construction  for  domestic  supply:  Nam  Lik  1/2  HPP  (120  MW),  Nam  Ngum  5 \nHPP (120 MW), and Xeset 2 HPP (76 MW). \n \n6. \nIn  addition  to  facilities  owned  by  EDL  for  domestic  supply,  several  independent  power \nproducers  (IPPs)  export  electricity  to  Thailand,  such  as  Theun  Hinboun  (210  MW,  EDL  share \n60%) commissioned in 1998 and Houay Ho (150 MW, EDL share 20%) commissioned in 1999. \nBy  the  end  of  2008,  total  IPP  installed  generating  capacity  was  360  MW.  Thus,  the  whole \ncountry has a total of 690 MW.  \n \n7. \nThe  country's  generating  capacity  is  mostly  hydro  based.  This  is  to  make  use  of  the \nhuge  hydropower  potential,  which  is  estimated  at  18,000  MW.  To  date,  only  about  3.3% \n(690 MW) of this potential has been developed serving the Lao grid and for export to Thailand. \nA further 2,250 MW of capacity is in various stages of development. The Lao PDR has signed \nmemorandums of understanding for exporting 3,000 MW of power to Viet Nam and 5,000 MW \nto Thailand. \n \n8. \nEDL's  transmission  and  distribution  (T&D)  system  is  fragmented;  it  has  three  separate \n115 kilovolt (kV) transmission subsystems. The Nam Ngum 1\u2013Nam Leuk\u2013Nam Mang 3 115 kV \nsystem  serves  Vientiane  capital,  Louangphrabang,  Xiangkhouang,  Xaignabouli,  and  provinces \nin the central region. The Khammoune 115 kV system imports power from Nakhon Phanom in \nThailand  via  Thakhek's  115/22  kV  substation  to  supply  Thakhek  and  its  surrounding  areas. \nSavannakhet's 115 kV system imports power from Thailand to supply Savannakhet province. \n \n9. \nFrom  2000  to  2008,  domestic  demand  for  electricity  increased  at  an  average  14%  per \nyear  with  higher  year-on-year  growth  at  the  end  of  the  period.  This  demand  increase  is  being \nmet by a corresponding increase in electricity production (6%) and increase in electricity imports \n(11%). 3  The  central  region  around  Vientiane  accounted  for  almost  90%  of  total  electricity \nconsumption.  The  southern  and  northern  regions  account  for  the  remaining  10%  as  these \nregions are poor.  \n \nBecause  of  EDL  system  expansion  and  increased  capacity,  household  electrification \n10. \nserved  by  the  EDL  grid  has  grown  steadily  from  19%  in  1996  to  58%  in  2008.  Similar  to \nconsumption patterns, electrification is higher in the central region, whereas the northern region \nhas the lowest rate (13% in Phongsali province compared with the 58% national average).  \n \n11. \nThe Power Development Plan for 2007\u20132016 envisages a fourfold increase in electricity \ndemand  from  350  MW  in  2006  to  1,216  MW  in  2015.  Correspondingly,  annual  electricity \nconsumption will grow from 1,700 gigawatt-hours (GWh) to 7,000 GWh. To meet this demand, \ntimely  development  of  the  Lao  power  system  must  be  ensured,  both  in  generation  and  the \ntransmission and distribution (T&D) network. \n \n12. \nIn  the  past,  EDL's  retail  tariff  has  been  low  and  included  cross-subsidies  by \nnonresidential customers to residential customers and agriculture. Since 2005, the government \nand  EDL  have  implemented  a  tariff  adjustment  program  to  remove  these  subsidies.  This  tariff \nadjustment  program  coupled  with  the  program  that  settles  government  arrears  resulted  in  an \n\n                                                \n3  In 2008, the Lao PDR imported a total of 510 GWh to supply 11 provinces. The largest import was from Thailand \n(470  GWh)  to  supply  seven  provinces  including  Xaignabouli,  followed  by  imports  from  Viet  Nam  (22.6  GWh)  for \nthree provinces in northeast and 17.8 GWh from the People's Republic of China for Phongsali province. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\nimproved financial situation for EDL in 2008. In 2008, the EDL average sale price (KN542 per \nkilowatt-hour [kWh]) covered its production cost (KN468/kWh). \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems and Constraints  \n\n13. \nThe  power  system  is  at  a  nascent  stage  of  development,  characterized  by  small \ngenerating capacity and fragmented T&D systems. Presently, EDL's T&D systems do not cover \nthe entire country. For example, Phongsali province and a large part of Xaignabouli province are \nnot  covered  by  EDL's  T&D  system.  The  absence  of  a  strong  and  reliable  T&D  system  in  the \ncountry  necessitates the  import  of  expensive  electricity  at  22 kV.  At  this low  voltage,  imported \nelectricity  is  more  expensive  ($0.08/kWh)  than  EDL's  supply  ($0.05/kWh\u2013$0.06/kWh).  To  deal \nwith  this  problem,  the  Lao  government  plans  to  phase  out  the  import  of  medium  voltage \nelectricity  by  2015  by  building  up  its  national  high  voltage  grid  system  and  exchanging  high \nvoltage  power  (e.g.,  115  kV  and  above)  with  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam.  The  115  kV \ninterconnection proposed in this project is to meet this government objective. \n \n14. \nBecause  of the  lack  of a  unified T&D  network, electrification  in the  Lao  PDR  is  among \nthe lowest of the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In the project \narea, rural  electrification  is  particularly  low  in  Phongsali  province  (13%). Xaignabouli  province, \ndue  to  its  relative  vicinity  to  Vientiane  and  increasing  trade  with  Thailand,  has  a  higher \nelectrification rate (50%) but it is still below the national average (58%). Poverty is widespread \nwhere electricity is not made available to households. For example, in Phongsali province, 60% \nof  households  are  considered  poor4 according  to  the  government's  statistics,  while  in  some \ndistricts of Xaignabouli province, the percentage of poor households is as high as 50%. \n \n15. \nLack  of  institutional  capacity  represents  a  key  constraint  in  managing  sustainable \ndevelopment of the country's huge hydro resource for domestic and export use. The balancing \nof  these  two  objectives  requires  proper  long-term  planning.  In  addition,  potential  negative \nimpacts  on  the  environment  and  communities  living  in  the  river  basins  require  a  systemic \napproach  in  planning  and  implementing  mitigation  measures,  livelihood  development,  and \nenvironmental conservation programs for which the need for capacity building is urgent. \n \n16. \nEDL's  financial  robustness  depends  on  its  ability  to  generate  sufficient  capital  to  cover \noperating  expenses  and  future  investment.  EDL's  investment  requirement  for  2007\u20132016  is \nestimated  at  $1.3  billion.  This  requires  an  electricity  tariff  that  meets  the  system\u2019s  marginal \nproduction costs. In the future, to meet the estimated investment requirements and to maintain \nEDL's  financial  sustainability,  the  government  and  EDL  will  need  to  continue  the  tariff  reform \nprogram  that  will  apply  time-of-use  rates  distinguished  by  voltage  for  customers.  Such  a  tariff \nwill align with the supply costs, and ensure financial and economic efficiencies. An independent \nregulatory agency is necessary to manage the tariff regulation. The absence of such an agency \nputs a burden on the government and makes the tariff adjustment time consuming. An authority \nto manage the tendering of hydro IPPs is also needed. \n \n\n                                                \n4  According  to  the  government's  definition,  households  considered  poor  are  those  with  an  income  of  less  than \nKN85,000 equivalent in cash per person/month (based on 2001 prices). This sum allows purchasing 16 kilograms \nof milled rice per person/month, but the balance is insufficient to cover other necessary expenses, such as clothing, \nshelter, children\u2019s schooling costs, and medical treatment. According to the latest survey carried out by the National \nCommittee on Rural Development and Poverty Reduction, 1.5 million of the population are poor, representing 27% \nof the country\u2019s population.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n17. \nImproving  access  to  electricity  and  rural  electrification  targets.  Recognizing  the \nimportance of the provision of electricity for reducing poverty and improving living conditions, the \ngovernment  has  specific  plans  to  provide  electricity  from  the  national  grid  to  70%  of  all \nhouseholds in the country by 2010, 80% by 2015, and 90% by 2020. For the provinces under \nthe  project,  these  national  targets  mean  an  increase  of  the  household  electrification  rate  from \n13%  to  28%  in  Phongsali  province  and  from  50%  to  98%  in  Xaignabouli  province.  The  other \nnorthern provinces will also have to increase their electrification rates accordingly from 33% to \n79% in Louang-Namtha province, and from 41% to 90% in Bokeo province.  \n \n18.  Meeting  increasing  demand  with  grid  extension.  To  achieve  the  ambitious  rural \nelectrification targets requires an expansion of EDL's T&D network.5 The government and EDL \nplace  great  emphasis  on  building  a  unified  national  T&D  grid  with  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  Japan,  the  World  Bank,  other  development  partners,  and \ninternational private investors. \n \n19. \nSustainable hydropower development. Development of large hydropower projects will \ncontinue  to  play  an  important  role  in  meeting  domestic  demand  as  well  as  for  export.  The \nrevenues generated from increased export earnings will be vital to improving basic government \nservices,  including  education,  health,  and  infrastructure  services  in  poor  areas  of  the  country. \nThe  government  can  obtain  benefits  from  hydropower  projects  through  concession  fees, \nroyalties,  taxation,  and  returns  on  its  equity  stake  in  particular  projects.  The  government\u2019s \nHydropower  Sustainable  Development  Policy  provides  guidance  for  exploration  of  national \nresources  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Currently,  the  Water  Resource  and  Environment \nAdministration is responsible for implementation of environmental protection policies and social \nresettlement policies. It has asked ADB to help build capacity to meet this challenge. \n \nPrivate  sector  participation. Private sector participation in power development will be \n20. \nneeded  especially  because the government  expects  half  of the  investment requirements to  be \nsecured from the private sector, particularly for power generation. The government is working to \ncreate  a  favorable  investment  environment  for  the  private  sector  by  defining  appropriate  roles \nfor  the  public  and  private  sectors,  establishing  institutions  to  facilitate  IPP  participation, \nintroducing a transparent bidding mechanism, and adopting best practices for formulating power \npurchase  agreements.  The  government  is  also  taking  steps  to  put  in  place  an  appropriate \nregulatory  framework  to  encourage  private  sector  participation.  The  Department  of  Energy \nDevelopment  and  Promotion  has  requested  ADB  assistance  to  enhance  its  capacity  for \nmanaging IPP projects. \n \n21. \nLong  tradition  of  power  exchange  with  Thailand. The Lao PDR has a long tradition \nand  good  experience  in  exchanging  power  with  Thailand.  The  Lao  PDR  exports  to  Thailand \npower  generated  from  its  large  HPPs  at  220  kV  such  as  Theun  Hinboun  and  Houay  Ho,  and \nfrom  Nam  Ngum  1  at  115  kV,  and  it  imports  power  from  Thailand  at  115  kV  and  22  kV.  The \ncountries have five operating interconnections at 115 kV and five at 22 kV.  \n \n22. \nCurrently,  a  22  kV  transmission  line  connects  the  Thali  substation  (in  Loei  province  of \nThailand) with Paklay district in Xaignabouli province. This 22 kV transmission line now provides \n                                                \n5   The electrification of households in Vientiane which has a 115 kV network linking generation sources with demand \ncenter, was 96% (2007) compared to 13% in Phongsali province which does not have access to the transmission \nnetwork. The project will construct almost 398 km of 115 kV line, this is a significant addition to the network given \nthat the total length of the central backbone 115 kV system was 1,498 km in 2007. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\nto  Xaignabouli  province.  Once \n\nthe  project's  115  kV  cross-border \nimported  electricity \ninterconnection is built, it will replace the current 22 kV transmission line used for power import. \nThe  115  kV  cross-border  interconnection  will  have  a  much  higher  load-carrying  capacity  and \nlower voltage drop; hence, it will deliver more reliable and improved quality of electricity supply. \nUnlike the existing 22 kV transmission line, which is used only for importing power, the 115 kV \ninterconnection  can  be  utilized  for  both  import  and  export  of  electricity.  Such  two-way  power \ntrade  will  be  possible  and  beneficial  to  the  Lao  PDR  and  Thailand  by  making  use  of  the \nseasonal  variation  of  hydro  energy.6 In  addition, the  interconnection  allows the  two  systems to \nback each other up during line maintenance and power outages. \n \n23. \nBoth  governments,  EDL,  and  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT) \nstrongly  support  the  cross-border  connection  under  the  project.  On  13  May  2009,  the  EGAT \ngovernor  and  the  EDL  managing  director  general  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  in \nBangkok  officially  announcing  the  agreement  for  the  proposed  interconnection.  Two  countries \nhave  joint  operation  committees  supervising  power  exchange  between  EGAT  and  EDL.  The \ncommittees  meet  regularly,  involving  technical  and  senior  staff,  to  discuss  cooperation.  The \ninterconnection  under  this  project  will  be  part  of  the  current  Nam  Ngum  1  system.  Thus,  the \narrangement  for  power  buying  and  selling  will  be  looked  at  by  the  joint  committees  as  an \nintegral part of the Nam Ngum 1 system interconnection with EGAT.  \n \nThe  interconnection  line  to  be  built  under  the  project  and  the  ongoing  Northern  GMS \n24. \nTransport  Network  Improvement  Project  to  improve  the  roads  from  the  Lao  PDR\u2013Thailand \nborder along Xaignabouli province and northward to Louangphrabang will accelerate economic \ncooperation  activities  and  cross-border  trade  between  northeast  Thailand  and  Xaignabouli \nprovince. According to the National Economic Development Board of Thailand, this corridor is a \npriority area for Thailand official development assistance to the Lao PDR because of the strong \ninterest  of  Thailand\u2019s  private  sector  in  commercial  agriculture  development.  Availability  of  a \nreliable supply of electricity is essential for business in the project area. \n \n25. \nThe project area has large hydropower potential. Two HPPs totaling 240 MW mainly for \ndomestic  supply  are  under  construction  (Nam  Lik1/2  and  Nam  Ngum  5  HPPs),  and  several \nother  HPPs  have  been  identified  for  development  in  the  coming  years  to  supply  electricity \ndirectly  into  EDL's  transmission  network.  The  Nam  Tha  1  HPP  (168  MW)  is  to  be  built  in \nLouang-Namtha  province,  and  the  electricity  generated  can  be  transmitted  to  the  Louang-\nNamtha substation (built under an ADB loan).7 The Nam Ham HPP (5 MW) is near Paklay town \nand its power will be transmitted to the Paklay substation under this project. Similarly, the Nam \nOu  HPP  (50 MW)  in  Phongsali  province  will  be  connected  to  the  Namo  substation.  With  the \ndevelopment  of  generation  in  synchronization  with  the  T&D  network  expansion,  EDL's  system \nwill be significantly strengthened and the Lao PDR will greatly benefit from using its own hydro \nresources for socioeconomic development and poverty reduction.  \n \n26. \nThe  Ministry  of  Energy and  Mines  (MEM)  is  mandated to  provide  the  policy  framework \nand strategic vision for long-term development of the energy sector in the Lao PDR. The sector \nis  facing  tremendous  challenges,  for  example,  optimal  utilization  of  the  country\u2019s  abundant \nhydro resources, and balancing between domestic use of electricity and demand for export. The \nproject  will  provide  a  senior  policy  advisor  to  advise  EDL  and  MEM  on  strategic  policy  issues \n                                                \n6  Similarly,  with  the  interconnection  between  Huyaxay  and  Xiangkhouang  to  be  constructed  and  with  the \ntransmission line between Namo and Boun Nua to be constructed under this project, two-way power trade at 115 \nkV will be possible. \n\n7   ADB.  2003.

These  include  (i)  power  system  development,  \n(ii)  development  of  large  IPP  HPPs,  (iii)  development  of  a  transmission  company  in  charge  of \nthe high voltage transmission system, (iv) tendering of IPPs, (v) negotiation of power purchase \nagreements,  and  (vi)  synchronization  between  hydropower  development  and  environmental \nprotection.   \n  \n\n3. \n\nGovernment Strategy   \n\nto  clarify  responsibilities,  strengthen  commercial \n\nThe  Lao  Power  Sector  Strategy  (2002)  identifies  the  main  pillars  for  power  system \n27. \ndevelopment,  including  (i)  maintaining  and  expanding  an  affordable,  reliable,  and  sustainable \nelectricity  supply  in  the  Lao  PDR  to  promote  economic  and  social  development;  (ii)  promoting \npower generation for export; (iii) developing and enhancing the legal and regulatory framework \nto effectively direct and facilitate power system development; and (iv) reforming institutions and \ninstitutional  structures \nfunctions,  and \nstreamline administration.  \n \nBetween 1995 and 2008, the government increased household connections from 16% to \n28. \n58%. The government's goal is to achieve supply of 90% of households with electricity by 2020 \n(70%  of  households  by  2010,  80%  by  2015).  As  this  target  is  being  achieved,  electrification \nmoves increasingly to remote areas and the remaining villages and households in rural areas. \nEDL's  development  plan  calls  for  expansion  and  strengthening  of  the  T&D  system  with \nemphasis on (i) increasing the length of new transmission systems, (ii) building new substations \nand  expanding  existing  substations,  (iii)  developing  high-voltage \ninterconnections  with \nneighboring  countries,  (iv)  overhauling  and  reinforcing \nthe  distribution  network,  and  \n(v)  developing  national  and  regional  dispatch  centers.  According  to  the  Power  Development \nPlan  (para.  11),  the  project  components  constitute  a  noticeable  part  of  the  planned  T&D \nexpansion during 2011\u20132016.8  \n \n\n4. \n\nADB Sector Strategy \n\n29. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  the  Lao  PDR  aims  to  promote  sustainable \neconomic development through infrastructure investments. For power, the country strategy and \nprogram  emphasizes  the  importance  of  helping  the  country  build  and  expand  its  power \ninfrastructure  in  a  sustainable  manner  and  build  human  resource  capacity  for  efficient \nmanagement of energy and power development.9  \n \nThe  Lao  energy  sector  strategy  study  (Appendix  2)  identifies  several  key  areas  that \n30. \nwould  benefit  from  ADB  assistance:  (i)  improving  access  to  electricity;  (ii)  strengthening  T&D \nsystems through network integration; (iii) maximizing the benefits of hydropower; (iv) promoting \nrenewable energy, and energy efficiency and conservation; and (v) building capacity for energy \npolicy planning and formulation including energy efficiency and renewable energy strategies.  \n \n31. \nImproving  access  to  electricity.  More  rural  electrification  projects  will  need  to  be \nimplemented  to  achieve  the  government\u2019s  rural  electrification  targets.  ADB  will  continue  to \nprovide  loan  and  grant  assistance  to  future  rural  electrification  projects,  both  on-grid  and  off-\ngrid.  ADB\u2019s  focus  will  continue  to  be  on  the  northern  region,  because  of  its  very  low \nelectrification  rates.  EDL  estimates  that  about  46,000  new  connections  will  be  required  during \n\n                                                \n8   All project components are included in the Power Development Plan 2007\u20132016, including the interconnection with \n\nThailand at the border near Kenethao in Xaignabouli province. \n\n9   ADB. 2009. Country Strategy and Program: Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 2007\u20132011. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\n2010\u20132013,  and  a  further  41,000  during  2014\u20132016,  to  reach  the  national  goals  of \nelectrification.  No  other  development  agencies  are  making  major  investments  for  rural \nelectrification in the northern region. \n \nStrengthening  the  T&D  system.  Intra-  and  interregional  transmission  development  is \n32. \nkey  to  meeting  the  country\u2019s  demand  for  hydropower  resources.  ADB  will  assist  EDL  in \ndeveloping  its  network  to  (i)  provide  hydropower  from  EDL  or  domestic  IPPs  to  the  EDL  grid,  \n(ii) enable EDL to fully use its entitlement from export projects (existing and new), and (iii) serve \ncustomers in urban and remote areas. \n \n33.  Maximizing  the  benefits  of  hydropower  exports. ADB support will focus on creating \nan  enabling  environment  for  investors  to  continue  with  the  development  of  hydropower  and \nother resources for exports, while ensuring that the benefits to the Lao PDR and its institutions \nare maximized. In this respect, ADB will support (i) developing transmission interconnections to \nserve the 10% entitlement of export projects to EDL customers, and (ii) enabling EDL customers \nand  the  network  to  be  interlinked  to  the  transmission  line  serving  export  customers  to  ensure \nmaximum benefits of such infrastructure to the country. \n \n34. \nPromoting  investments  in  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency.  ADB  support \nwill  build  MEM  capacity  to  promote  renewable  energy  development  and  implementation  of \nenergy  efficiency.  Specific  areas  of  assistance  to  promote  use  of  renewable  energy  are  \n(i) development of a renewable energy strategy and action plan, and (ii) investment support for \non-  and  off-grid  small  and  mini-hydropower.  Specific  areas  of  support  to  promote  energy \nefficiency and conservation are development of (i) an energy efficiency strategy and action plan, \n(ii) energy efficiency in government buildings (to complement World Bank capacity building work \nand  sample  audits),  (iii)  capacity  to  conduct  energy  audits  and  formulate  projects  for  energy \nefficiency standards and labeling, and (iv) legislation to promote energy efficiency. \n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance  \n\n35. \nADB,  with  its  support  for  various  transmission  and  hydropower  projects,  is  the  largest \nsource of development assistance to the power system: about $323 million in loans and grants \nand $17 million in technical assistance (TA) since the early 1970s. TA projects focused on the \ndevelopment  of  HPPs,  power  system  strategy,  power  planning,  and  rural  electrification.  Loans \nand grants were provided to develop hydropower and T&D systems. Given that hydropower is a \nvital  resource  that  can  serve  domestic  need  as  well  as  generate  revenues  of  hard  currency, \nADB assistance has enabled the Lao PDR to harness this important renewable energy resource \nboth  for  domestic  use  and  for  exports.  ADB  assistance  also  facilitated  strengthening  the  T&D \nnetwork and interconnection with neighboring countries.  \n \nThe World Bank has also provided TA and loans and grants targeting the development \n36. \nof  hydropower,  rural  electrification,  and  institution  building.  The  two  latest  World  Bank  power \nprojects (i) the Rural Electrification Project, phase 1, approved in March 2006 and (ii) the GMS \nPower Trade Project approved in May 2008. Apart from T&D system development, these World \nBank projects help EDL build national dispatching center in Vientiane and regional dispatching \ncenters  in  provinces.  A  tariff  study  will  be  implemented  under  the  GMS  Power  Trade  Project. \nOther multinational and bilateral agencies involved in the power system are Japan International \nCooperation  Agency,  Nordic  Development  Fund,  and  Danish  International  Development \nAgency. Development partner coordination is described in Appendix 3. \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nDonor  coordination  in  the  GMS  power  sector  is enhanced  through the  Regional  Power \n37. \nTrade  Coordinating  Committee  that  meets  once  a  year  and  through  the  Planning  Working \nGroup  that  meets  three  to  four  times  a  year  to  discuss  regional  power  master  plans  and  to \nprioritize  cross  border  power  interconnections.  The  World  Bank,  Japan,  Agence  Francaise  de \nDeveloppement  (AFD),  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (SIDA)  and \nMekong River Commission participate in these meetings that are coordinated by ADB. \n \n\n6. \n\nLessons  \n\n38. \nProject performance audit reports rate the Nam Leuk HPP project, Theun Hinboun HPP \nproject,  and  Nam  Ngum\u2013Louangphrabang  Prabang  transmission  project  successful.  The \nperformance evaluation of past ADB transmission projects identifies several important lessons, \nsuch  as  (i) transmission  projects  that  traverse  populated  rural  areas  should  provide  for  the \ndistribution  of  electricity  to  such  areas  and  thereby  minimize  objections  and  enhance  the \nsocioeconomic impact; (ii) feasibility estimates that are dependent on detailed engineering after \nloan  approval  should  include  a  wider  contingency  margin  to  avoid  the  possible  need  for \nsupplementary financing and delays; (iii) nonuniform design considerations, including provision \nfor  variable  tower  heights,  tower  spans,  and  tower  support  structures,  should  be  applied  to \ntransmission  projects  for  provinces  with  mountainous  topography;  (iv)  EDL  staff  and \nimplementation  consultants  should  become  more  familiar  with  ADB  procurement  procedures; \n(v) financial  loan  covenants  for  EDL  should  be  set  realistically;  and  (vi)  the  average  cost  of \nconnection to the electric system for rural households should be kept at a reasonable amount.  \n \n39. \nThese  lessons  were  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  In  fact,  this  project  builds  not \nonly  transmission  lines  but  more  importantly  substations  and  associated  distribution  networks \nthat bring electricity to villages and households. To help poor households overcome connection \nfee  barriers,  the  project  includes  a  provision  to  provide  no-interest  credit  for  connections. \nPhysical contingencies are at 11%, and topography of the project area is taken into account in \nthe technical design. Regarding the financial covenant, the ADB mission reached an agreement \nwith  the  World  Bank  that  both  institutions  will  apply  similar  financial  covenant  ratios  for  all \nprojects to be approved by ADB and the World Bank starting in 2009. Other lessons identified \nthrough  consultation  with  EDL  and  MEM  were  also  incorporated  in  the  project.  For  example, \none  lesson  is  that  substations  and  transmission  lines  must  be  bundled  into  a  single  contract \npackage to achieve synchronous completion for energizing. The approval process developed for \nthe  resettlement  plan  by  the  Department  of  Electricity  and Water  Resources  and  Environment \nAdministration will reduce the time required for approvals.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  project10 will  extend  EDL\u2019s  T&D  system  to  Phongsali  and  Xaignabouli  provinces, \n40. \nand  the  western  part  of  Vientiane  province.  It  will  link  with  the  EGAT  system  to  provide \nelectricity  in  an  efficient  and  reliable  manner  to  rural  villages,  towns,  and  industrial  and \ncommercial consumers that do not have access to electricity supply or rely on limited high-cost, \noff-grid power supplies. The project will directly contribute to achievement of the government's \ngoal of electrifying 90% of the country\u2019s households by 2020. The household electrification rate \n\n                                                \n10 The  project  preparatory  TA  was  completed  in  December  2008.  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing the Greater Mekong Subregion Northern Power Transmission Project. \nManila (TA 4816-LAO). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\nin the main project area (Phongsali and Xaignabouli provinces) will increase from 39% (2009) to \n79% by 2020.  \n \n41. \nThe  project  outcome  will  be  increased  access  to  electricity  by  households,  small \nbusinesses,  and  commercial  and  industrial  customers.  Increased  access  is  being  enabled  by  \n(i)  new  115  kV  transmission  lines  with  associated  substations  and  interconnection  with  the \nEGAT\u2013Provincial  Electricity  Authority  system;  and  (ii)  extended  medium-  and  low-voltage \ndistribution systems. About 18,800 new households (6,000 poor households) in the project area \nwill  be  connected  to  the  national  grid.  Given  the  current  absence  of  a  nationwide  unified \ntransmission system, this project, in addition to the ongoing ADB-supported project (footnote 7), \nhelps to construct a national transmission network covering the whole country. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n42. \nThe  project  will  construct  several  115  kV  transmission  lines,  substations,  and  medium-\nand  low-voltage  distribution  networks.  The  project  will  also  increase  the  two-way  transfer  of \npower  between  EDL  and  EGAT's  grids.  Geographically,  the  project  spans  three  provinces\u2014\nVientiane, Phongsali, and Xaignabouli (see map)\u2014and is provide in three modules: \n \n\n(i) \n\nModule 1 (to be financed by ADB) includes \n115 kV transmission lines (173 km) \n(a) \n(1) \n\n74.6  km  single-circuit  transmission  line  from  Paklay  to  the  Lao \nPDR\u2013Thailand  border  near  Kenethao  for  connection  with  EGAT \nvia Thali substation \n98.0 km single-circuit transmission line from Paklay to Nonhai  \n\n(2) \n115/22 kV substations \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n\nPaklay: 20 megavolt-ampere (MVA) new substation \nNonhai: existing substation extension \nXayabury: existing substation extension \n\n  \n\n  \n\n(ii) \n\nModule  2  (to  be  financed  by  Export\u2013Import  Bank  of  Korea  [Korea  Eximbank])11 \nincludes \n(a) \n\n115 kV transmission lines\u2014122.74 km single-circuit transmission line \nfrom Paklay to Xayabury \nassociated medium-voltage (755 km) and low-voltage12 distribution \n(1) \n(2) \n(3) \n7,020 households supplied from Xayabury substation  \n7,553 households supplied from Paklay substation  \n1,541 households supplied from Nonhai substation \n\n263 km 22 kV feeders from Paklay substation  \n156 km 22 kV feeders from Nonhai substation \n336 km 22 kV feeders from Xayabury substation \n\n(iii)  Module 3 (to be financed by Korea Eximbank) includes \n\n115 kV transmission lines\u2014102.4 km single-circuit transmission line from \nNamo to Boun Nua \n115/22 kV substation \n(1) \n\nBoun Nua 20 MVA new substation (transformer feeder) \n\n(b) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n                                                \n11  Korea Eximbank financing does not cover the credit to poor households, which will be funded by the ADB grant. \n12  Low-voltage  line  lengths  and  stepdown  distribution  transformers  are  estimated  on  a  per-household  basis,  and \n\nincluded in the cost estimates. Exact lengths will be confirmed during project implementation. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nNamo 115 kV switching station \n\n(2) \nAssociated medium- and low-voltage distribution\u2014361 km 22 kV feeders \nfrom Boun Nua substation \n2,645 households supplied from Boun Nua substation  \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n \n43. \nThe  project's  low-voltage  distribution  networks  include  low-voltage  lines,  step-down \ntransformers, and connection to electric poles adjacent to households. For poor households, the \nproject provides a free meter of 3/9 ampere. To help poor households finance the connection, \nthe project design includes a credit scheme that will provide no-interest credit of KN700,000 to \neach eligible poor household so that they can pay for the wiring from the poles to their houses \nand  wiring  inside  the  houses.  The  credit  to  the  poor  scheme  works  as  follows:  the  district \nauthorities  will  be  responsible for  identifying  households  eligible for  receiving  no-interest  credit \nof  up  to  KN700,000.  Once  certified  by  the  district  authorities,  the  households  will  sign  an \nagreement  with  EDL  provincial  offices  for  accepting  the  credit  and  committing  to  repay  EDL \nKN20,000  together  with  the  monthly  electricity  bill.  Payment  will  continue  for  35  months. \nHouseholds  will  also  sign  an  agreement  with  their  chosen  local  contractors  based  on  a \npredetermined form for wiring their  houses.  Upon  certification  of these  contracts,  EDL  will  use \nthe  credit  fund  to  pay  contractors.  This  credit  scheme  was  successfully  implemented  by  the \nWorld Bank's Rural Electrification Project, phase 1, power to the poor component implemented \nin  seven  southern  provinces  of the  Lao  PDR. To  date,  3,500  households  have  received  credit \nand have their houses connected. This credit scheme has been well received and appreciated \nby the population. Based on provincial statistics, more than 6,000 poor households in Phongsali \nand Xaignabouli provinces will benefit from this assistance under this project. \n \nBased  on  the  government\u2019s  request,  the  project  will  provide  a  senior  policy  advisor  to \n44. \nadvise  on  strategic  policy  issues  related to  long-term  energy  sector  development,  such  as the \npower  development  plan,  tendering  of  large  hydro  IPPs,  and  negotiation  of  power  purchase \nagreements.  The  senior  policy  advisor  will  also  assist  in  drafting  of  a  strategy  framework  on \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nLink with Greater Mekong Subregion Power Trading \n\n45. \nCurrently under the coordination of the Regional Power Trade Coordination Committee, \nan  institutional  framework  for  power  trade  among  the  GMS  countries  is  being  developed.  To \ndevelop  the  grid  connection  infrastructure,  the  GMS  power  master  plan  is  being  updated  to \nidentify  the  most  viable  cross-border  interconnections.  With  significant  hydro  resources  and \nsituated  in  the  center  of  GMS,  the  Lao  PDR  can  play  an  important  role  in  GMS  power  trade \ndevelopment. One of the project outputs is the 115 kV line connecting Paklay substation in the \nLao PDR with Thali substation in Thailand. The project will promote power trade between EDL \nand EGAT, especially in the long term when more hydro capacity will be constructed in the Lao \nPDR  and  also  as  demand  grows  on  both  sides  of  the  border.  The  project  is  part  of  a  wider \nexpansion  of  a  Lao  PDR\u2013Thailand \nin  EDL's  Power \nDevelopment Plan 2007\u20132016. By 2015, two 115 kV interconnections will be developed in the \nnorthern region: Paklay\u2013Thali (proposed in this project) and Huyaxay\u2013Xiangkhouang.  \n \n\ninterconnection  plan  developed \n\n2. \n\nPartnership in Project Financing  \n\n46. \nADB and the Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) of Korea Eximbank will \nfinance  the  project.  By  mobilizing  funds  from  Korea  Eximbank,  in  addition  to  ADB's  Asian \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n\nDevelopment  Fund,  the  construction  of  about  400  km  of  transmission  lines  and  associated \nsubstations, and a vast medium- and low-voltage distribution system can be implemented in a \nshort time frame.  \n \n\n3. \n\nConnections for Poor Households   \n\n47. \nTo  support  the  poor,  the  project  design  includes distribution  equipment  up  to the  poles \nand  inclusive  of  the  meter  of  3/9  ampere  for  poor  households.  The  project  will  also  allocate \n$750,000 for the Credit to the Poor Fund, which was successfully implemented in the southern \nprovinces. The project is replicating this scheme with more than 6,000 poor households. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  project  cost \n\n48. \nincluding  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  implementation \n(Table 1).  \n\nis  estimated  at  $65.32  million, \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\n  \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nInvestment costsa \n1  Land acquisition and resettlement \n2  Civil works \n3  Equipment and materials \n4  Unexploded ordnance clearance and pathfinding \n5  Consulting services \n6  Poor households wiring credit \n7  Senior advisory service \n8  Taxes and duties \n \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB.

The  government  has  also  asked  Korea  Eximbank  to  provide  $37,880,000  from  the \nEDCF to help finance the project (modules 2 and 3). EDL will finance $7,440,000 to cover land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  during  construction \n($1,850,000). Table 2 shows the financing plan. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 4. The government will relend the ADB grant and the Korea Eximbank loan to EDL \nthrough  subsidiary  loan  agreements.  The  terms  and  conditions  for  subsidiary  loans  will  be \ndetermined  jointly  by  EDL,  MEM,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  subject  to  government \napproval. Based on past projects, the relending interest for a subsidiary loan is usually 4%\u20137%, \nand maturity is 10\u201320 years with a grace period of 3\u20135 years. \n \n50. \nThe  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  through  Korea  Eximbank,  will  provide  loan \ncofinancing  equivalent  to  $37,880,000.  Korea  Eximbank  cofinancing  will  be  parallel  and  tied, \nand denominated in won. The loan has interest of 0.01% per annum, with 40-year maturity and \na  15-year  grace  period.

The project management unit (PMU) currently implementing the ADB loan \n(footnote  7)  will  serve  as  the  implementing  agency.  The  PMU  will  implement  the  project  with \nassistance from EDL\u2019s provincial branch offices in the project areas. An international consulting \nfirm  serving  as  the  project  implementation  consultant  (PIC)  will  be  engaged  to  help  the  PMU \nwith project implementation for all three modules. Figure 1 shows the organization structure. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n\nFigure 1: Project Management Organization \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n        EDL \n\n \n\nDistrict Compensation and \nGrievance Committees  \n\n \n\nPMU \n\nContractors \n\nEDL Branches \n\nPIC \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nEDL = Electricite du Laos, PIC = project implementation consultant, PMU = project management unit. \nSources: EDL and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n52. \nThe  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  overall  project  implementation  planning,  budgeting, \nfinance planning, and accounting; (ii) consultant recruitment; (iii) supervision and coordination of \ndetailed project design; (iv) procurement of goods and services; (v) implementation, supervision, \nand  commissioning  of  all  project  components  including  administration  of  the  no-interest  credit \nscheme  to  poor  households;  (vi) implementation  of  environmental  impact  mitigation  measures \nand  resettlement  plans;  (vii)  organization  of  the  project  performance  monitoring  system;  and \n(viii) preparation of periodic project progress reports and project completion report. \n \n53. \nThe  EDL  provincial  branch  in  each  province  will  appoint  staff  to  assist  the  PMU  in \nimplementing  the  project.  They  will  be  responsible  for  local  liaison  and  coordination  with \ncontractors,  processing  household  connections,  local  site  supervision,  and  supervision  of \nproject  construction  and  commissioning.  They  will  update  all  data  relating  to  project  progress \nmonitoring, contractor performance, and financial reports.  \n \n54. \nDistrict  and  provincial  authorities  will  provide  assistance  to  the  project  in  various \nresettlement  planning  and  implementation  activities.  This  support  will  be  utilized  to  form \ncompensation  and  grievance  committees,  which  will  comprise  representatives  from  EDL, \nprovincial  MEM  departments,  provincial  cabinets,  provincial  water  resources  and  environment \nadministrations, and provincial land offices. The committees will be responsible for planning and \nimplementing compensation and resettlement in accordance with the resettlement plan.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe  project  will  be  implemented  over  42  months13 from  the  effectiveness  of  the  grant. \n55. \nAdvance  recruitment  of  the  PIC  was  requested  to  ensure  timely  project  implementation. \nHowever,  ADB  approval  of  the  advance  recruitment  of  consultants  does  not  commit  ADB  to \napprove the project or to finance the recruitment costs. The detailed implementation schedule is \nin Appendix 5.  \n\n                                                \n13  The  42-month  implementation  schedule  was  a  result  of  concrete  discussion  with  the  PMU.  In  the  past  a  major \nreason  for  longer  implementation  was  approval  of  resettlement  plans  and  particularly  compensation  rates.  ADB \nand the PMU agreed that the PMU will prepare an updated resettlement plan to avoid delays. In addition, turnkey \ncontracts will be used for the construction, which will save time. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nAll  grant-financed  procurement  will  be  carried  out \n\n56. \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  procurement  plan \nprepared  and  agreed  to  by  the  government  and  ADB.  The  ADB-financed  turnkey  contract  will \nfollow  international  competitive  bidding  with  prequalification  and  follow  the  one-stage  two-\nenvelope procurement method. All procurement contracts will contain anticorruption provisions \nas specified by ADB.  \n \n57. \nProcurement for modules 2 and 3 to be financed under the Korea Eximbank cofinancing \nwill  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  Procurement  under  the  EDCF  Loan. \nSupply of goods and services under the Korea Eximbank financing will be procured from among \nRepublic  of  Korea firms using  the  one-stage  two-envelope  procedure. These  procedures  were \ndiscussed and agreed to by Korea Eximbank and the government. Packages under the Korea \nEximbank financing include (i) a contract for a procurement specialist and (ii) a turnkey contract \nfor modules 2 and 3. ADB shall be satisfied that the procedures used for the Korea Eximbank-\nfinanced procurement will fulfill the borrower's obligations to cause the project to be carried out \ndiligently  and  efficiently,  and  that  the  goods  and  works  to  be  procured  (i)  are  of  satisfactory \nquality  and  compatible  with  the  balance  of  the  project;  (ii)  will  be  delivered  or  completed  in  a \ntimely  fashion;  and  (iii)  are  priced  so  as  not  to  affect  adversely  the  economic  and  financial \nviability of the project. Appendix 6 shows the procurement plan for modules 1, 2, and 3.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n58. \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) will \nbe applicable throughout the consulting services. An international consulting firm to serve as the \nPIC will be engaged to help EDL implement the entire project, in particular in (i) procuring goods \nand  services;  (ii)  supervising  construction  and  installation;  (iii) conducting  system  final  testing \nand  commissioning;  (iv)  conducting  social  and  environmental  assessment,  management,  and \nmonitoring;  (v)  strengthening  EDL  capacity  for  social  and  environmental  assessment, \nmanagement,  and monitoring;  (vi)  undertaking  project  performance monitoring  and  evaluation; \nand  (vii)  project  reporting.  The  firm  will  be  hired  to  deliver  175 person-months  of  consulting \nservices  (80  person-months  by  international  and  95  person-months  by  national  experts) \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (80:20)  procedures  using  the  full  technical \nproposal.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  PIC  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  In \naddition to the PIC, the project will recruit a Republic of Korea procurement expert to assist EDL \nprepare  part  of  the  bidding  documents,  in  particular  the  invitation  for  bids  (as  part  of  the  ADB \nstandard  bidding  document)  and  contract  documents  following  Korea  Eximbank  procurement \nguidelines, evaluation of bidding proposals, and other technical supports related to the bidding \nprocess for procurement for modules 2 and 3. The cost of this consultant is included in Korea \nEximbank financing.  \n \n59. \nA  senior  international  energy  policy  advisor  will  be  engaged  using  single-source \nselection  to  provide  advice  on  strategic  policy  issues  related  to  energy  sector  development  in \nthe  Lao  PDR,  e.g.,  power  system  strategy,  development  of  large  IPP  hydropower  plants, \ntendering  of  IPPs,  and  negotiations  of  power  purchase  agreements.  The  indicative  terms  of \nreference  for  the  senior  advisor  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  All  consultants  under  the \nADB financing will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n60. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  EDL.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To \nsupport  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the \ngrant regulations and bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  project.  EDL  will  publish  on  its \nwebsite for each contract the following information: participating bidders, name of wining bidder. \nThe EDL legal department will closely supervise the bidding and bid evaluation processes. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nDisbursement  will  be  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \n61. \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed to by the government and ADB. \nDisbursement will be for consulting services (inclusive of the senior advisor), and for supply and \ninstallation  of  power  transmission  and  distribution  equipment  and  accessories  (inclusive  of \nwiring  for  poor  households).  Disbursement  of  the  EDCF  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  in \naccordance with the disbursement procedures to be constituted as an integral part of the loan \nagreement between the government and Korea Eximbank. \n \nTwo  imprest  accounts  will  be  established  to  provide  credit to  poor  households for their \n62. \nconnections.  According  to  the  government  requirement,  a  first  generation  imprest  account  will \nbe  created  at  Bank  of  the  Lao  PDR  owned  by  MOF,  to  receive  the  ADB  funds.  A  second \ngeneration imprest account will be opened at Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Laos owned \nby EDL for receiving funds from MOF. EDL, with MOF authorization, will request advance and \nreplenishment of the imprest accounts. The advance and replenishment will be no more than a \n6-month  projected  disbursement  to  be  financed  from  the  imprest  account  or  $250,000, \nwhichever  is  lower.  EDL's  provincial  branches  in  Xaignabouli  and  Phongsali  provinces  have \nworked with the district authorities to identify eligible poor households to receive the credit. The \npoor households will enter into an agreement with EDL for the credit, and an agreement with a \nlocal contractor for wiring the houses. EDL will use the funds in the second generation imprest \naccount to pay the contractors the expenditures incurred for wiring the poor households. ADB's \nstatement-of-expenditure procedure will be followed when liquidating all individual payments not \nexceeding $25,000. MOF assures that it will facilitate fast-track channeling of the funds from the \nfirst to the second generation imprest accounts during project implementation. The fund flow is \nshown in Appendix 7.  \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n63. \nEDL will maintain a separate account exclusively for project-related disbursements. The \nPMU  will  consolidate  the  account  and  have  it  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound \nauditing  practices  by  the government\u2019s sovereign  audit  agency  or  other  auditors  acceptable to \nADB.  The  audit  report  will  include  audited  financial  statements  and  detail  fund  sources  and \nexpenditures. Copies of the audited accounts and auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB and \nKorea Eximbank within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. A separate audit opinion will \nbe  issued  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement-of-expenditure  procedures.  The \ngovernment will maintain separate records and account for each of the ADB grant fund imprest \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\naccounts,  have  such  records  and  accounts  appropriately  audited,  and  regularly  submit  the \naudits to ADB.  \n \n64. \nThe PMU will prepare and submit quarterly project reports to ADB and Korea Eximbank. \nThe  reports  will  describe  the  physical  progress  for  the  reporting  period,  procurement  and \ncontractual status, highlights of implementation issues including changes to the implementation \nschedule,  total  number  of  consumers  connected,  and  a  summary  of  project  components,  with \ndetails  of  the  latest  project  disbursements  of  incremental  expenditures  and  contract  amounts. \nThe reports will also describe the works to be carried out in the next quarterly reporting period. \nEDL will submit to ADB and Korea Eximbank a project completion report within 6 months after \nproject  completion.  Aside  from  assessing  project  execution  and  operation,  the  quarterly \nprogress reports and the completion report will indicate compliance with the grant covenants. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n65. \nEDL will ensure that a comprehensive program for project performance monitoring and \nevaluation (PPME) acceptable to ADB will be carried out during implementation and subsequent \noperation to assess the achievement of the project\u2019s objectives. With help from the consultants \nand in consultation with local communities, the PMU will develop a set of PPME indicators at the \nstart of the project. The PMU will be responsible for implementing the PPME. EDL will submit a \ndetailed PPME implementation plan for ADB review and concurrence within 6 months of grant \neffectiveness, as well as annual PPME reports. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n \n66. \nThe project performance will be reviewed twice a year jointly by ADB, Korea Eximbank, \nand  the  government.  These  reviews  will  assess  implementation  performance,  review  financial \nprogress, identify issues and constraints affecting the project, work out a time-bound action plan \nfor  their  resolution,  and  verify  compliance  with  covenants.  The  government,  ADB,  and  Korea \nEximbank  will  jointly  undertake  a  detailed  midterm  review  of  the  project  after  2  years  of \nimplementation, or earlier if major difficulties threaten the project objectives. The midterm review \nwill  appraise  the  project  scope,  cost  estimates,  implementation  arrangements,  number  of \nconnections,  and  compliance  with  covenants;  and  identify  issues  to  be  resolved  to  improve \nproject impact and sustainability. The government, ADB, and Korea Eximbank will jointly decide \non  any  changes  needed  in  project  design  and  implementation  as  appropriate,  given \nimplementation experience, to achieve the project objectives. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits \n\nA. \n \n67. \nThe government has set a goal to electrify 80% of all villages and 90% of all households \nby 2020. The area targeted by the project, comprising the provinces of Phongsali, Xaignabouli, \nand the far west of Vientiane, is currently among the poorest and least electrified in the country. \nMore than 30% of the poorest districts in the Lao PDR are in the target provinces. The project \nwill  provide  grid  connection  for  195  villages  and  electrify  about  18,800  households.  Table  3 \nprovides details on provinces, substations, and households to be electrified. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n\nTable 3: Households to be Electrified in the Project Area \n \n\nTotal \nHouseholds  \n2,645 \n1,541 \n7,553 \n7,020 \n18,759 \nSources: Electricite du Laos and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nSubstation \nBoun Nua \nNonhai \nPaklay \nXayabury \nTotal \n\nProvince \nPhongsali \nVientiane  \nXaignabouli  \nXaignabouli  \n\n \n\n \n\n68. \nThe  electricity  provided  by  the  project  will  benefit  newly  connected  households  and \nexisting  consumers,  who  can  increase  their  consumption  because  of  the  more  reliable  and \nhigher  quality  supply  of  electricity.  For  some,  the  project  will  replace  electricity  now  imported \nfrom  Thailand  through  long  medium-voltage  distribution  system.  Nonresidential  consumers, \nsuch as small-scale enterprises, schools, clinics, public services entities, and commercial users, \nalso  have  the  opportunity  to  increase  their  electricity  consumption.  The  Paklay  and  Boun  Nua \nsubstations  are  designed  with  20  MVA  transforming  capacity  anticipating  demand  from  future \nindustrial mining projects registered in the area.   \n \n69. \nInterconnection  makes  use  of  the  seasonal  availability  of  hydropower,  which  is  98%  of \nthe EDL generating capacity. During the dry season (March\u2013May), due to lower hydro energy, \nEDL can import power. During the wet season (August\u2013October), EDL can export power. With \nthe  interconnection  provided  by  the  project,  expected  power  flows  between  Paklay  and  Thali \nsubstations can reach 28 MW.  \n \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n \nThe  economic  analysis assesses the  economic viability  of  the  project from the  societal \n70. \nresource  utilization  point  of  view.  Such  analysis  compares  the  project\u2019s  social  benefits  with  its \nsocial  costs.  Project  benefits  resulting  from  delivery  of  electricity  to  consumers  are  valued \nseparately for  nonincremental  and  incremental consumption.  Electricity output  of  the  project  is \ndefined  as  nonincremental  if  it  replaces  the  existing  supply  of  alternative  sources  of  energy  in \nthe absence of the project. It is defined as incremental if it meets additional or induced demand. \nCosts  include  the  project\u2019s  capital  investment  valued  at  economic  prices;  operation  and \nmaintenance costs equivalent to 1% of capital cost for the first 10 years, and 2% thereafter; and \nthe  economic  costs  associated  with  power  generation  and  future  distribution  investment \nrequirements.  \n \n71. \nAt a 12% discount rate, the economic net present value of the project is $203.7 million. \nThe  project's  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  to  be  42.2%  well  above  the  real \neconomic opportunity cost of 12%. Sensitivity and risk analyses carried out demonstrate that the \neconomics of the project are robust with respect to possible variations of the key inputs, such as \n20% increase of capital costs and 40% reduction of incremental benefits due to lower demand. \nThe distribution analysis shows that electricity consumers (including nonresidential) benefit most \nfrom the project followed by local laborers. Details of the analysis are in Appendix 8. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n72. \nThe financial viability of the project is assessed by comparing the financial internal rate \nof  return  (FIRR)  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  The  FIRR  is  estimated  at \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n11.5% after tax, exceeding the WACC of 2.7%. Sensitivity tests show that the FIRR exceeds the \nWACC  even  under  a  range  of  adverse  scenarios.  Thus,  the  project  is  considered  financially \nviable. Detailed calculations are in Appendix 9. \n \nEDL\u2019s financial viability was assessed using EDL's past financial statements. Historically, \n73. \nEDL\u2019s  retail  tariffs  have  been  low  relative  to  its  cost  of  supply  due  to  a  cross-subsidy  from \nnonresidential customers to residential customers and agriculture customer groups. In 2005, the \ngovernment  approved  an  annual  tariff  adjustment  program  to  be  implemented  each  year  for \n2005\u20132011;  it  progressively  removes  existing  subsidies.  With  implementation  of  the  program, \nEDL's tariff reached cost recovery in 2008 (average tariff of KN542/kWh compared with the cost \nof supply of KN468/kWh).  \n \nIn  the  past,  government  arrears  impacted  negatively  on  EDL's  shorter-term  liquidity \n74. \nposition.  To  address  this  situation,  MOF  and  EDL  began  implementing  an  arrears  settlement \nprogram in 2005. MOF increased its annual fund allocation to settle arrears from KN52 billion in \n2006 to KN118 billion in 2009. As a result, the KN140 billion accumulated arrears in 2006 were \nreduced  to  KN96  billion  by  2009.  Further,  the  government  approved  a  new  action  plan  in \nDecember  2008  to  allocate  adequate  funding  to  each  central,  provincial,  and  municipal \ngovernmental institution based on agreed annual electricity budgets to allow these institutions to \nsettle their electricity bills in a timely manner. MOF and EDL are working together to determine \nthe precise amount of outstanding arrears to settle all the arrears in the near future.  \n \n75. \nTo meet future investment requirements (estimated at $1.3 billion for 2007\u20132016) and to \nmaintain  EDL's  financial  sustainability,  EDL  is  planning  to  implement  a  new  tariff  adjustment \nprogram to be designed based on the results of the tariff update study (completed in June 2009 \nunder World Bank TA). The new tariff will be designed to incorporate a new tariff classification \nfor  high-voltage  customers,  capital  requirements  of  the  Power  Development  Plan,  and  an \nannual  adjustment  based  on  inflation  and  exchange  rates.  The  new  tariff  is  envisaged  to  be \napproved in the first quarter of 2010.  \n \n76. \nEDL's  financial  projections  for  2009\u20132016  indicate  overall  financial  performance  to  be \nwithin an acceptable range: profit margin of at least 15%, debt\u2013equity ratio of 0.5\u20131.0 times, and \ndebt  service  coverage  ratio  of  more  than  1.5  times.  Detailed  analysis  of  EDL's  past  financial \nperformance and projections are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \nB. \n \n\nImpacts \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nThe initial environmental examination (IEE) (Supplementary Appendix D) concludes that \n\n77. \nthe project will generate only minor environmental impacts for the following reasons: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe 115 kV transmission line routes and substation sites were selected to avoid \nenvironmentally sensitive areas; villages; settlements; and religious, cultural, and \nor  heritage  sites.  The  transmission  line  routes  broadly  follow  existing  road \ncorridors to minimize the impacts. \n\nNatural  habitats  along  selected  transmission  line  alignments  are  generally \ndegraded due to forest removal through logging, swidden agriculture, conversion \nto  plantations,  paddy  farming,  and  human  settlement.  The  zone  of  degradation \ngenerally  extends  for  at  least  a  few  kilometers  on  either  side  of  the  road  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n\nencompasses the location of the transmission line alignments. The transmission \nlines do not encroach upon any national protected area. \n\n(iii) \n\nThe 22 kV distribution systems will mainly follow existing road rights-of-way, and \nwill be constructed so that local residents in villages through which the lines will \npass can connect for electricity. The installation of the system within existing road \nrights-of-way  ensures  that  environmentally  sensitive  areas  outside  of  the  road \nrights-of-way will not be adversely affected. \n\n \nEven  though  the  environmental  impacts  will  be  minor,  the  IEE  has  an  environmental \n78. \nmitigation  and  monitoring  plan  with  specific  mitigation  measures  to  reduce  the  impacts.  It \nincludes institutional arrangements for implementing the plan to ensure its effectiveness. Based \non  the  IEE,  the  PIC  will  prepare  a  project  environmental  management  plan  (PEMP)  covering \npreconstruction, construction,  and  operation  stages for  modules  1,  2,  and  3. The  PIC  will  also \nprepare site or construction environmental management plans (CEMPs) for implementation by \nthe contractors for modules 1, 2, and 3. Provisions of the CEMPs will be specific to the activities \nor  work  packages  to  be  undertaken  by  the  contractors.  The  PEMP  and  CEMPs  will  be \nconsistent  with  the  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures,  reporting,  institutional  arrangements, \nand training programs indicated in the IEE. The content of the PEMP and CEMPs will conform \nto the environmental management plan requirements specified in the ADB Environment Policy \n(2002). \n \n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement  \n\n \nThe project does not involve any relocation, and has very limited land acquisition since \n79. \nthe transmission line route is designed to minimize land acquisition and eliminate the need for \nphysical resettlement and relocation of dwellings and other assets. This includes attention to the \ntransmission route to avoid impacts, use of government land for the new substation and most of \nthe towers, and support for structure designs with the least land acquisition requirement. \n   \n80. \nBased  on  the  current  transmission  line  route,  physical  construction  will  involve \npermanent  acquisition  of  approximately  1,000  square  meters  (m2)  for  tower  footprints  from  \n28  households  (36  m2  per  tower).  No  affected  households  will  lose  more  than  10%  of  their \nagricultural land. The project will also require temporary access roads to straining towers during \nline  stringing.  Such  temporary  land  acquisition  may  affect  crops;  therefore,  land  rental  and \ncompensation will be provided and the land will be returned to its original condition.  \n  \n81. \nA  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  to  establish  the  involuntary  resettlement  screening \nand planning procedures for the project. The resettlement plan and its policies and entitlements \nwere  discussed  during  a  stakeholder  workshop  held  in  March  2007.  The  resettlement  plan \nincludes measures for stakeholder participation and full disclosure of all information relating to \nthe  project.  In  addition,  a  project  information  booklet  prepared  by  EDL  was  distributed  to \naffected  people  in  July  2009  as  part  of  the  resettlement  plan  disclosure.  A  resettlement \nframework  was  prepared  and  provides  policies  and  entitlements  for  the  substations  and \nmedium-  (22  kV)  and  low-voltage  (400  V)  power  distribution  facilities.  The  resettlement \nframework  will  be  used  as  a  basis  for  the  preparation  of  detailed  resettlement  plans  after \ndetailed design and measurement surveys. The resettlement plan and resettlement framework \nwere  uploaded  onto  the  ADB  website  on  22  September  2009.  A  summary  of  the  resettlement \nplan and resettlement framework is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nAmong  the  28 families  affected  by  permanent  land  acquisition for  towers,  10  belong to \n82. \nethnic  minorities,  including  two  Hmong  families  affected  by  module  1  and  eight  families \n(Phounoi and Yang) affected by module 3. To ensure that ethnic minority households and those \nheaded  by  women  are  not  marginalized  during  the  process  of  compensation,  ethnic  minority \nand gender-specific actions are included in the resettlement plan.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSocial and Poverty Impacts \n\nIn the Lao PDR, many rural poor households do not have access to electricity. The cost \n83. \nof connecting a house to the power pole in rural areas (including wires, fuses, nuts, and bolts), \nis  approximately  KN700,000.  However,  poor  households  may  have  difficulty  paying  for  the \nconnection. To specifically help the poor, each poor household, identified by the district authority, \nwill be given a credit up to KN700,000 to cover the cost of wiring from the pole to the house and \ninside  house  wiring.  The  project  will  include  community  consultations  for  information \ndissemination to  poor  households  about this  credit  scheme.  About  80% of  poor  households  in \nthe  project  area  are  expected  to  benefit. The  social  analysis  of the  project  shows  that  47%  of \nthe  respondents  rank  electricity  as  their  first  priority.  Electricity  is  perceived  as  a  contributing \nfactor  for  improving  living  conditions  and  enhancing  learning  opportunities  for  children.  The \naccess  to  electricity  will  increase  access  to  information  technology,  and  utilization  of  electric \nequipment and computers in schools and health facilities. This would result in quality education \nand health services. Street lighting will contribute to safer environments at night in villages.  \n \n\na. \n\nGender  \n\n \nThe increased access to electricity will reduce the drudgery of women\u2019s domestic work \n84. \nthrough  use  of  appliances,  such  as  electric  water  pumps,  rice  cookers,  grinders,  and  food \nprocessing  equipment.  Community  meetings  will  be  conducted  in  collaboration  with  the  Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union to disseminate information on the credit scheme available to poor households \nfrom all ethnic groups and households headed by women; these will be given special attention \nto ensure their access to electricity. The safer environment at night will have a positive impact \non  women's  mobility.  A  project-specific  gender  strategy  is  included  in  the  summary  of  poverty \nreduction and social strategy (Appendix 11).  \n \n\nb. \n\nRisk \n\n \n85. \nTo ensure that rural communities who will get access to electricity under this project will \nhave sufficient knowledge on the safe use of electricity and safety around the power line, EDL \nwill provide an electricity safety booklet to the communities. During construction, the number of \nworkers will increase considerably; this presents a potential risk of HIV and trafficking of women. \nTo minimize this risk, an awareness campaign on HIV and human trafficking will be conducted \nunder the project.  \n \nC. \n\nRisks and Assumptions  \n\nThe project is not likely to face any significant technical difficulties as the technology is \n86. \nstandard and widely available. EDL has good experience and performed well in similar projects; \nin  particular,  managerial  skills  of  staff  have  improved  through  implementation  of  the  Northern \nArea Rural Power Distribution Project (footnote 7). With the opportunity to apply their skills and \nlessons from the previous project, EDL staff are expected to have improved by the end of this \nproject. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n\nThe project may face a risk of cost overrun. To counter this risk, the cost estimate was \n87. \nupdated and appropriate price and physical contingencies are allowed. International competitive \nbidding will be used for ADB-financed packages. The Korea Eximbank fund includes sufficient \ncontingencies for packages to be financed by Korea Eximbank (14%). Another issue of possible \nconcern  is  the  coordination  between  packages  and  project  components.  Having  a  single  PIC, \nthat will be in charge of detailed design, preparation of bidding documents, and implementation \nof  environmental  management  plan  and  resettlement  plan,  ensures  that  coordination  will  be \nsatisfactory.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n88. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n\nFinancial Matters \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  and  EDL  have  given  the \n\nThe  government  shall  ensure,  through  appropriate  tariff  adjustment  and  other \nmeans, that EDL maintains (a) a self-financing ratio of 30% or above, (b) a debt \nservice  coverage  ratio  of  1.5  or  above,  and  (c)  a  debt\u2013equity  ratio  of  1.5  or \nbelow.

In  case  of  discrepancy  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  will  apply.  The  resettlement  activities  will  be  carried  out \naccording  to  the  resettlement  plans  agreed  between  the  government  and  ADB. \nThe executing agency will endorse and disclose all plans to the public and submit \nthem  to  ADB  for  approval.  The  resettlement  plans  will  be  updated  as  soon  as \npracticable  after  completion  of  detailed  designs  and  detailed  measurement \nsurvey. .  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAny  civil  works  will  be  commenced  only  after  the  resettlement  plan  has  been \napproved by ADB and required land has been acquired and affected households \nhave been compensated at full replacement cost. \n\nAdequate  budgetary  support  will  be  committed  by  the  government  and  made \navailable to cover the costs of land acquisition and resettlement. \n\nPrior to the commencement of any civil works in a given construction site under \nthe  project,  the  government  and  EDL  shall  cause  and  ensure  that  a  company, \nwhich  is  licensed  under  the  government's  law  to  undertake  the  clearance  of \nunexploded  ordnance  in  the  Lao  PDR,  has  been  engaged  under  the  project  to \nclear  all  unexploded  ordnance  in  such  construction  site  and,  after  the  relevant \nclearance work is completed, has issued a certificate to that effect. \n\n \nB. \n\nGrant Effectiveness Conditions \n\n89. \nThe  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  shall  have  duly  signed  a  loan  agreement  with  the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea concerning the Korea Eximbank loan, and all conditions \nprecedent  to  the  effectiveness  of  such  loan  agreement  (other  than  a  condition  requiring  the \neffectiveness of the ADB grant) shall have been fulfilled. \n \nThe  government  and  EDL  shall  have  duly  signed  one  (or,  if  necessary,  two  separate) \n90. \nsubsidiary loan agreement(s), through which the government shall make available the proceeds \nof the ADB grant and the Korea Eximbank loan to EDL for the purposes of the project, and such \nsubsidiary loan agreement(s) shall be in the form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n91. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding  $20,000,000  to  the  Lao  People's  Democratic  Republic  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Northern  Power  Transmission  Project,  on  terms \nand  conditions  that  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant  and \nproject agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n21 December 2009 \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nAchieving the government \ngoal of rural electrification \nin 2020 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData Sources/ \nReporting \nMechanisms  \n\n \nGovernment and \nEDL statistics \n \n\nPerformance Targets/Indicators \n\n \nBy 2020, 80% of villages and 90% of \nhouseholds in the Lao PDR are \nelectrified as compared with 43% of \nvillages and 58% of households in 2007 \n\nBy 2020, 28% of households in \nPhongsali province and 98% households \nin Xaignabouli province will be electrified \n(project area combined: 79%) \n\nOutcome \nIncreased access to \nelectricity for households in \nthe northern provinces of \nthe Lao PDR  \n \n \n\n \n18,800 new households (among which \n6,000 poor households) in Phongsali, \nXaignabouli, and Vientiane provinces will \nbe electrified by 2013: \n\n \nEDL annual reports \n\nProvincial statistics \n \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\nAssumptions \nLao\u2019s Power Development \nPlan 2007\u20132016 is \nimplemented successfully \naccording to the schedule. \n \nNew tariff adjustment based \non the recently completed \ntariff study will be \nimplemented starting in 2010 \nand government arrears \ncompletely settled by 2011 \nto ensure EDL's financial \nsustainability. \nAssumptions \nProject resources are \nefficiently and timely used to \nimplement all project \npackages.  \n \n \n \n \n\n7,000 households connected from \nXayabury substation  \n\n7,600 households connected from \nPaklay substation  \n\n1,500 households connected from \nNonhai substation \n\n2,700 households connected from \nBoun Nua substation \n\nA total of 398 km of 115 kV transmission \nlines constructed according to technical \ndesign by 2013 \n\nSubstations at Paklay (20 MVA) and \nBoun Nua (20 MVA) and extension of the \nexisting Namo and Nonhai substations \ncompleted according to technical design \nby 2013 \n\nMedium- and low-voltage distribution \nsystem constructed according to \ntechnical design by 2013, including  \n\n361 km of 22 kV feeders from Boun \nNua substation \n263 km of 22 kV feeders from Paklay \nsubstation  \n156 km of 22 kV feeders from Nonhai \nsubstation \n336 km of 22 kV feeders from \nXayabury substation \n \n\nCredit scheme established by December \n2010 \n\n6,000 poor households provided with no-\n\nOutputs \n\n1.

The  country  has  significant  energy  resources \nespecially  hydropower\u2014about  18,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  hydropower  can  be  developed. \nHowever, to date only 3.3% of the hydropower resources are being utilized. High-quality lignite \n(estimated  at  220  million  tons)  was  found  in  Hongsa  district  of  Xaignabouli  province  near  the \nborder with Thailand. Private investors plan to develop the lignite mines for power generation at \nHongsa  (1,800  MW)  and  to  export  power  to  Thailand.  Renewable  energy  sources  in  the  Lao \nPDR are still in the development stages. Biomass resources essentially consist of wood fuels, \nused for cooking and heating, normally by the rural population. The potential for wind energy is \nlimited.  Small  hydropower  and  photovoltaic  modules  are  already  used  in  remote  areas.  Small \nhydropower will play an increasing role as a means of rural electrification. \n \n2. \nThe  power  system  serves  two  vital  national  priorities:  (i)  it  provides  a  reliable  and \naffordable supply of power to facilitate business and provide social benefits to urban and rural \ncommunities,  and  (ii)  it  earns  foreign  exchange  revenues  from  electricity  exports.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  power  policy  facilitates  these  objectives  by  encouraging  optimal  use  of  the \ncountry\u2019s natural resources, and creating a conducive environment for responsible infrastructure \ninvestment, both public and private. \n \n3. \nThe  power  system  currently  has  small  generating  capacity  and  a  fragmented \ntransmission and distribution (T&D) system. The total installed generating capacity is 692 MW, \ncomprising 310 MW owned by Electricite du Laos (EDL), 362 MW owned by independent power \nproducers (IPPs),1 and 20 MW belonging to provincial authorities. About 98% of this capacity is \nhydro based, the remaining 2% is diesel based. The existing power system covers four isolated \nT&D regions\u2014northern, central 1, central 2, and southern\u2014serving about 250,000 customers in \ntotal.  The  existing  domestic  power  grids  include  115  kilovolt  (kV)  and  22  kV  transmission  and \ndistribution systems. Transmission lines interconnect between the Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet \nNam for power export and import. The largest EDL hydropower plants providing power mainly \nfor domestic supply are Nam Ngum 1 (155 MW), followed by Nam Leuk (60 MW), Nam Mang 3 \n(45 MW), and Xeset (40 MW). Several new large IPP hydropower plants are under construction, \nmostly  for  export,  including  Nam  Theun  2  hydropower  project  (1,070  MW,  with  70 MW  for \ndomestic  supply);  Nam  Ngum  2  (615 MW  for  export);  Theun  Hinboun  extension  (220  MW  for \nexport  to  Thailand  plus  60  MW  for  domestic  supply)  to  be  commissioned  in  2012;  and  Xe \nKaman 3 (250 MW for export to Viet Nam).   \n \n4. \nEDL was incorporated as a public company under a charter approved by the Ministry of \nIndustry  and  Handicrafts  in  1997  (renamed the Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines  [MEM]  in  2007). \nEDL  is  responsible  for  the  design,  construction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  its \ngenerating plants, T&D and substation facilities, and power exports.  \n \nA. \n \n5. \nAccess  to  electricity  and  rural  electrification  target.  Rural  electrification  is  an \nimportant  aspect  of  poverty  reduction\u2014a  highest  priority  of  the  government\u2019s  6th  National \nSocio-Economic  Development  Plan,  which  aims to graduate  the  country from  least  developing \ncountry  status  by  2020.  Currently,  58%  of  households  in  the  country  have  access  to  grid \n                                                \n1  These are Theun Hinboun hydropower plant (210 MW) with 60% shareholding by EDL, and Houay Ho hydropower \n\nSector Issues and Development Challenges \n\nplant (150 MW) with 20% shareholding by EDL. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nelectricity.  The  government  has  set  a  plan  to  electrify  the  country  by  2020,  with  specific \ntargets\u201480%  of  the total  number  of  villages  and  90%  of  the  total  households  will  be  supplied \nwith  electricity  from  the  national  grid. 2 Northern  provinces  are  currently  the  least  electrified \nbecause the national grid does not reach many provinces. To achieve the national targets, an \nincrease  in  the  electrification  rate  for  the  northern  and  southern  provinces  should  be \naccelerated.  This  would  require  an  increase  in  the  household  electrification  rate  from  13%  to \n28% in Phongsali, and from 14% to 32% in Oudomxai by expanding the current EDL electricity \nT&D network. \n \n6. \nGrid  extension to  meet  increasing  demand.  A significant challenge is the integration \nof  the four regional  grids  presently  operating  in isolation.  EDL\u2019s  Power  Development  Plan  has \ndeveloped  a  demand  forecast  to  include  the  electrification  plan  for  each  area,  to  be  satisfied \nwith a combination of additional generation, imports and/or exports from other areas, and cross-\nborder  imports  and  exports.  The  plan  up  to  2020  includes  a  general  policy  of  building  more \nhydropower plants in each region, striking a balance between the regions, and selling increasing \nsurplus  energy  to  neighboring  countries.  By  2020,  the  country  is  expected  to  have  a  fully \nintegrated  national  grid,  largely  at  230  kV  and  115  kV.  The  unified  national  grid  will  help  to \nachieve  rural  electrification  targets  as  well  as  boost  the  socioeconomic  development  of  the \ncountry. \n \nSustainable hydropower development. Development of large hydropower projects will \n7. \ncontinue  to  be  justified  if  social  and  environmental  impacts,  resettlement,  and  compensation \nmatters  are  carefully  assessed  and  mitigated,  and  if  the  net  benefits  are  shared  equitably \nbetween investors and the population, who are ultimately the owners of the natural resources. \nThe  revenues  generated  from  increased  export  earnings  will  be  vital  to  improving  basic \ngovernment  services,  including  education,  health,  and  infrastructure  services  in  poor  areas  of \nthe country. The government can obtain benefits from hydropower projects through concession \nfees,  royalties,  taxation,  and  returns  on  its  equity  stake  in  particular  projects.  While  past \nhydropower  projects  have  generated  substantial  revenues,  these  have  primarily  been  used  to \nfinance  the  operations  of  EDL.  Revenues  from  future  hydropower  projects  will  need  to  be \nmanaged  to  ensure  they  increase  public  spending  for  poverty  reduction.  The  government\u2019s \nHydropower  Sustainable  Development  Policy  provides  guidance  for  exploration  of  national \nresources in a sustainable manner. The challenge is developing the capacity to implement the \npolicy  while  developing  hydropower  projects.  Currently,  the Water  Resource  and  Environment \nAdministration is responsible for implementing the environmental protection policies and social \nresettlement  policies.  The  Water  Resources  and  Environment  Administration  has  asked  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to help build its capacity to meet this challenge.  \n \n8. \npower system to 2016 total $1,260 million (Table A2.1). \n \n9. \nPrivate sector participation. Private sector participation in power system development \nwill  be  needed  to  achieve  the  government\u2019s  power  development  targets.  The  government \nexpects  half  of the  investment requirements to  be  secured from  the  private  sector,  particularly \nfor generation. Although many private investors are interested in participating in export-oriented \nIPP  projects,  greater  efforts  are  required  to  create  a  favorable  investment  environment.  The \ngovernment needs to define appropriate roles for the public and private sectors, as the country \nis  still  in transition  to  a market-based  economy.  Sector restructuring  will  be required,  including \n\nMobilization of financial resource for investment. The investment requirements in the \n\n                                                \n2  In 2007, 5,289 villages (about 50% of the national total) with a population of about 2.6 million did not have access \n\nto electricity. \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nestablishing  institutions  to  facilitate  IPP  participation,  introducing  a  transparent  bidding \nmechanism,  and  adopting  best  practices  for  formulating  power  purchase  agreements.  The \ngovernment  is  also  taking  steps  to  put  in  place  an  appropriate  regulatory  framework  to \nencourage private sector participation. The Department of Energy Development and Promotion \nhas asked ADB to help enhance its capacity for managing IPP projects. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Investment Requirements for System Development \n($ million) \n\nProjects \nGenerating plantsa \nTransmission lines \nSubstations \nDispatch control center \nRural electrification \nOverhaul and distribution reinforcement \n \na Excluding all investments on IPPs. \nSource: Power Development Plan, 2007\u20132016. \n\nTotal \n\nForeign Cost  \n484.3 \n253.4 \n70.5 \n13.4 \n131.3 \n25.8 \n978.7 \n\nLocal Cost \n121.1 \n105.2 \n10.4 \n5.8 \n32.8 \n6.4 \n281.7 \n\nTotal Cost  \n605.4 \n358.6 \n80.9 \n19.2 \n164.1 \n32.2 \n1,260.4 \n\n \n10.

This  amount  of  internal  cash \ngeneration is clearly inadequate to finance an investment requirement of about $1.3 billion over \n2007\u20132016 to meet the fast-growing demand. To be able to raise funds for development, a plan \nto  increase  the  average  customer  tariff  from  the  present  $0.06/kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  in  2007  to \n$0.10/kWh in 2016 was suggested. The tariff adjustments proposed are based on the following \ncriteria: (i) self-financing ratio at least 30%, (ii) debt service coverage ratio to be more than 1.5, \nand (iii) the debt\u2013equity ratio less than 1.5. A progressive tariff increase of an average 1% per \nyear 3  has  been  implemented  since  2006  and  will  continue  until  2011.  This  tariff  revision \nremoves  cross-subsidies  that  existed  between  low-income  households  and  agriculture,  and \ncommerce  and  industry.  In  addition,  the  unsatisfactory  settlement  of  electricity  bills  affects  the \nfinancial  viability  of  EDL.  With  continued  assistance  and  support  from  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  partners,  the  government  has  taken  concrete  steps  to  introduce  a  more \nappropriate  tariff  adjustment  mechanism,  and  to  settle  overdue  payment  arrears  from \ngovernment  agencies.  Adherence  to  progressive  tariff  adjustment  and  strict  payment  policies \nare  critical  to  improve  EDL\u2019s  financial  performance,  especially  in  view  of  the  large  investment \nrequirement  for  the  upcoming  decade.  Key  financial  ratios,  such  as  debt  service  ratio,  self-\nfinancing ratio, and debt\u2013equity ratio are expected to be under pressure. \n \n11. \nInstitutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building.  In  parallel  with  infrastructure  \ndevelopment,  the  power  system  needs  institutional  development  to  cope  with  the  increasing \nrequirement  to  manage  the  system  rationally  and  sustainably.  This  institutional  strengthening \nincludes (i) reform of the electricity tariff to full cost recovery, (ii) setting up a legal framework for \nmore  efficient  utilization  of  energy  resources  and  energy  products,  (iii) capacity  building  for \nimplementation  of  environmental  protection  and  social  and  resettlement  policies,  and  \n(iv)  establishment  of  best  practices.  Institutional  and  national  capacity  becomes  ever  more \nimportant  given  integration  of  the  Lao  PDR  with  neighboring  countries  in  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS). \n\n                                                \n3   Decision No. 845/PMO dated 6 June 2005.  \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\nGovernment\u2019s Development Strategy  \n\n \nB. \n \n12. \nAlthough the Lao PDR has a vast quantity of economically viable hydropower resources \nand  is  developing  a  major  regional  export  market  for  its  hydropower  resources,  its  per  capita \nconsumption rate (223 kWh) and electrification rate (54%) in 2007 are among the lowest in Asia. \nRecognizing  both  the  economic  and  social  advantages  of  electrification  and  the  low  rate  of \ndomestic  consumption,  the  government\u2019s  power  development  strategy  states  that  energy \nresources  represent  a  major  opportunity  for  economic  development  and  assist  in  reducing \npoverty  and  increasing  development  of  the  country.  It  has  four  medium-term  priorities: \n(i) maintain  and  expand  affordable,  reliable,  and  sustainable  electricity  supply  to  promote \neconomic and social development; (ii) promote power generation for export to provide revenues \nto meet development objectives; (iii) develop and enhance the legal and regulatory framework \nto  direct  and  facilitate  power  system  development;  and  (iv)  reform  institutions  and  institutional \nstructures \nfunctions,  and  streamline \nadministration.  The  government\u2019s  plan  to  2020  for  power  involves  rapid  and  simultaneous \ndevelopment  on  several  fronts  by  (i)  expanding  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  and  off-\ngrid development to increase the electrification rate for the country from about 58% in 2008 to \n90%  by  2020;  (ii)  increasing  government  revenues  from  IPP  investments  and  honoring  power \nexport  commitments  with  Thailand  (7,000  MW)  and  Viet  Nam  (5,000  MW)  by  promoting  IPP \ngeneration development; (iii) building a national unified T&D system to cover all regions of the \ncountry;  and  (iv)  promoting  the  development  of  a  500  kV  transmission  grid  with  neighboring \nGMS countries to integrate the Lao PDR power system with their power systems.  \n \nC. \n \n\nto  clarify  responsibilities,  strengthen  commercial \n\nPriority Areas for ADB Support  \n\n1. \n\nImproving Access to Electricity  \n\nTargets of electrification. The government's target of electrifying 90% of households in \n13. \n2020  requires  an  average  addition  of  41,000  new  electrified  households  every  year  from  now \nuntil  2019.  EDL  estimates  that  six  rural  electrification  projects  would  have  to  be  initiated  to \nimplement  the  work  during  2009\u20132020. 4  Owing  to  its  clear  benefits  and  alignment  with \ngovernment  policy,  ADB's  continued  assistance  to  future  rural  electrification  projects  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy. ADB\u2019s focus will continue to be on the northern region, \nowing to its very low electrification rates seen in its provinces, some as low as 7%. Apart from \nrural  electrification,  which  requires  specific  attention  by  way  of  concessionary  loans,  regular \ndistribution  upgrades  and  maintenance  should  be  the  responsibility  of  EDL,  with  investment \ncoming from internal cash generation. No other development agencies have major investments \nin the northern region for rural electrification.   \n \nIntra-  and \n14. \ninterregional transmission development is key to harnessing hydropower resources for the Lao \nPDR's own requirements. Good transmission connectivity would decrease the need for higher-\npriced  imports,  and  enable  exports  through  existing  links.  These  are  in  addition  to  the  export \nhydropower  projects,  which  have  their  own  dedicated transmission  system.  A further  objective \nof  developing  the  local  transmission  network  would  be  to  ensure  that  the  entitlement  of  EDL \nfrom  existing  and  new  export  IPPs  can  be  fully  utilized  and  distributed  among  customers. \nAccordingly,  from  EDL\u2019s  perspective,  transmission  investments  can  fulfill  one  of  the  three \nprincipal objectives: (i) to provide hydropower from EDL or domestic IPPs to the EDL grid, (ii) to \n\nto  strengthen  regional  grid \n\nTransmission  system \n\nintegration. \n\n                                                \n4   EDL. 2007.

Vientiane (Appendix 3). \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nenable EDL to fully use it entitlement from export projects (existing and new), and (iii) to serve \ncustomers in urban and remote areas. Transmission connections to provide hydropower to the \ngrid are usually included in such power project development.  \n \n\n2. \n\nMaximizing Benefits of Hydropower Exports \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s  support  will  focus  on  creating  an  enabling  environment for  investors to  continue \nwith  the  development  of  hydropower  and  other  resources  for  export,  while  ensuring  that  the \nbenefits  to  the  Lao  PDR  and  its  institutions  are  maximized.  In  this  respect,  ADB  will  support  \n(i) developing transmission interconnections to serve the 10% entitlement of export projects to \nEDL  customers,  and  (ii)  enabling  EDL  customers  and  the  network  to  be  interlinked  to  the \ntransmission line serving export customers to ensure maximum benefits of such infrastructure to \nthe Lao PDR. \n \n\n3. \n\nPromoting Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \n\nA  demand-side  management  (DSM)  unit  at  EDL  is  presently  functioning,  conducting \n16. \nnetwork  loss  improvement  programs  (in  association  with  distribution  areas),  and  implementing \ntasks  under  the World  Bank-assisted  DSM  program  focusing  on  capacity  building  and  energy \nauditing. The DSM unit needs to developed, but more important is the development a national \npolicy  framework  for  energy  efficiency  and  conservation.  ADB  has  started  assisting  the  Lao \nPDR  on  this  front.  Much  of  the  support  will  be  for  capacity  building  for  MEM  to  promote \nrenewable  energy  development  and  implementation  of  energy  efficiency.  On-grid  and  off-grid \ndevelopment  of  nonconventional  renewable  energy  is  being  promoted  by  various  government \nand  international  agencies.  Future  ADB  assistance  will  focus  on  developing  two  small \nhydropower projects. \n \n\n4. \n\nDeveloping Energy Policy and Planning \n\n17. \nThe  Lao  PDR  lacks  a  comprehensive  energy  sector  database,  a  planning  and  policy \nanalysis framework, and associated key human resources. Electricity statistics are available to a \nlarge  extent,  but  a  national  energy  balance  including  other  sources  (biomass,  petroleum,  coal \nand lignite) is not prepared regularly. ADB assistance will aim to assist MEM in developing an \nenergy  policy  analysis  and  development \nframework,  energy  planning,  and  database \ndevelopment functions.  \n \nTogether with other development partners, ADB, through grants, technical support, and \n18. \npolicy  dialogue,  will  continue  to  support  the  (i)  commercialization  of  EDL;  (ii) development  of \nappropriate regulatory  arrangements;  (iii)  expansion  of  an  affordable, reliable,  and  sustainable \nelectricity supply system; (iv) adoption of off-grid power generation and alternative technologies \nwhere  grid-fed  electrification  is  not  feasible,  especially  small  and  mini  hydro;  and  (v)  private \nsector participation in developing and operating the power system. Given the export orientation, \nforging  suitable  public\u2013private  partnerships  to  develop  the  country\u2019s  tremendous  hydropower \nresources in an environmentally, socially, and fiscally responsible manner is central to the long-\nterm  development  of  the  Lao  PDR.  ADB  support  for  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  the  energy \nsector  will  be  provided  primarily  through the GMS  Program  and  the  Private  Sector Operations \nDepartment. Priority will be accorded to development of the transmission system in the northern \nregion of the country, along the north\u2013south economic corridor. With the development of high-\nvoltage  transmission  and  distribution  facilities,  the  national  electrification  rate  will  steadily \nimprove and regional power trade will be facilitated. \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\nDEVELOPMENT PARTNER COORDINATION \n\n \n1. \nVarious  development  partners  provide  assistance  and  support  to  the  energy  sector, \nespecially for power in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The key partners are \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA), and recently the Government of Finland.  \n \nADB. ADB\u2019s cumulative lending to the country\u2019s energy sector stood at $323 million by \n2. \nthe  end  of  2008.  ADB  has focused  on  hydropower  development, transmission  and  distribution \ndevelopment, and rural electrification. Technical assistance (TA) has largely served the various \nneeds  of  the  loans,  but  additional  support  was  provided  for  (i)  institutional  development  and \ncapacity  building,  (ii) strategy  and  planning  studies,  and  (iii)  development  of  mini-hydro  power \nplants.  Through  its  significant  lending  to  power  generation  projects,  ADB  has,  in  general, \nprovided more assistance to the energy sector than other development agencies. \n \n \nWorld Bank. The World Bank is engaged in TA and financing projects in the sector. Its \n3. \nfocus areas for TA are tariff reforms and energy efficiency, and the areas of investment support \nare  energy  efficiency  and  loss  reduction,  and  rural  electrification.  Currently,  the  following \nprograms are active: (i) strengthening capacity building for hydropower and mining, (ii) electricity \ntariff study, (iii) rural electrification, and (iv) demand-side management. \n \n4. \nJICA.  The  TA  focus  areas  are  planning  and  feasibility  studies  on  hydropower  plants; \ninvestment  support  focuses  on  power  transmission,  with  limited  support  for  distribution,  and \npossible  future  assistance  for  capacity  expansion  of  hydropower  plants.  JICA\u2019s  policy  is  that \nsupport will be provided only to improve services to customers in the Lao PDR. Its assistance is \nlimited to projects and programs executed by Electricite du Laos (EDL), not those for export.  \n \nGovernment  of  Finland.  The  focus  area  for  Finland\u2019s  support  is  renewable  energy \n5. \ndevelopment.  Currently,  it  is  financing  the  Preparation  of  Renewable  Energy  Strategy  and \nCapacity  Building  project.  The  work  may  include  some  capacity  building  on  energy  efficiency \nimprovement. \n \n6. \nIn  the  past,  assistance  by  ADB  and  other  agencies  has  been  in  line  with  government \npolicies  and  plans  to  increase  electrification,  improve  transmission  within  the  regional  grids, \ninterconnect  the  presently  separated  regional  grids,  increase  hydropower  generating  capacity, \nand provide associated technical support and capacity building. Support to the following areas \nappears to be low: (i) small hydropower development and engagement of the private sector in \nsuch efforts; (ii) capacity building in national energy planning, policy analysis, and information; \nand (iii) energy efficiency including demand-side management. In the future, ADB will assist the \ngovernment  in  energy  planning,  energy  efficiency,  renewable  energy  development,  and \nassociated capacity building. These will be coordinated with key development partners, such as \nthe World Bank and JICA.

Such  analysis  compares  social  benefits  generated  by  the \nproject with its economic costs for with- and without-project scenarios. The analysis begins with \nthe demand analysis, followed by system least-cost planning, and identification of the project's \nbenefits  to  consumers.  The  benefits  are  quantified  and  differentiated  as  incremental  or \nnonincremental.  The  costs  are  adjusted  using  shadow  conversion  factors  to  reflect  their  true \neconomic values.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe demand forecast is based on the demand forecast made by Electricite du Lao (EDL) \nup to 2020 and extended to 2035 (Table A8.1). The forecast projects demand for residential and \nnonresidential  consumers  and  committed mining  loads for  each  module under the  project.  For \nthe  calculation  in  the  analysis,  the  project  demand  is  the  difference  between  the  with-project \ndemand and without-project demand. \n \n\nDemand Projection \n\nTable A8.1: Summary Demand Forecast by Module \n\nDemand, GWh \nModule 1 \nModule 2 \nModule 3 \nTotal  \n\n2008 \n13.98 \n12.35 \n2.11 \n28.44 \n\n2012 \n269.63 \n21.50 \n3.85 \n294.98 \n\n2016 \n279.53 \n30.25 \n251.72 \n561.50 \n\n2020 \n292.30 \n41.52 \n254.68 \n588.50 \n\n2025 \n308.53 \n55.85 \n258.41 \n622.79 \n\n2030 \n330.35 \n75.12 \n263.63 \n669.10 \n\n2035 \n359.71 \n101.04 \n270.92 \n731.67 \n\nLeast Cost Analysis \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nEDL  has  prepared  several  power  system  expansion  plans  in  recent  years,  both \nindependently  and  with  the  support  of  international  consultants.  The  latest  plan  is  the  Power \nDevelopment Plan 2007\u20132016 (PDP) signed into effect by EDL management in 2008. The PDP \nspecifies  the  demand  forecast  up  to  2020,  which  is  used  in  the  demand  analysis;  generation \nexpansion plan; and transmission and distribution expansion plan. \n \n4. \nTransmission  planning  for  the  project  area  aims  to  deliver  power  from  the  existing \nnational  grid  and  its  least-cost  generation  expansion  mix  to  the  load  centers  in  the  area.  This \nanalysis  was  conducted  with  the  powerful  PSS/E  (power  systems  simulator  for  engineering) \nsoftware  package.  The  PSS/E  model  designs  the  least-cost  system,  taking  into  account  the \ndemand,  system  losses,  and  capital  costs,  subject  to  power  system  security  and  stability \nconstraints. The load-carrying requirements of the transmission lines and their operating voltage \nare selected using least-cost planning criteria, and the locations and capacity of substations are \nselected to deliver the power to load centers at least cost. The PSS/E analysis concludes that \n115  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  lines  can  be  expected  to  meet  the  long-term  electricity \nrequirements of the project provinces. Preliminary designs and costs were developed for single-\ntower  single-circuit  and  double-tower  single-circuit  configurations.  The \nis \nrecommended  as  the  least  cost  means  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  forecast  over  the \n\nlatter  option \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n43 \n\nProject Costs \n\nanticipated  life  of  the  transmission  investments,  and  is  adopted  for  purposes  of  this  economic \nanalysis. The PDP and the transmission planning establish that the project is part of the least-\ncost plan. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  costs  of  the  project  include  (i)  cost  of  supply,  construction,  installation,  and \ncommissioning of the 115 kV transmission lines, 115/22 kV substations, and medium- and low-\nvoltage  distribution  network  (including  connections  to  poor  households),  and  (ii)  consulting \nservices.  The  project's  costs  are  estimated  based  on  the  detailed  breakdown  of  components, \nequipment, and works associated with them. For economic analysis, the project's cost includes \nphysical  contingencies  but  excludes  taxes  and  duties.  Total  project  cost  amounts  to  $56.44 \nmillion. \n \n\nTable A8.2: Estimated Project Costs \n\nLand acquisition and resettlement \n\n365 \n\n0 \n\n \n\n Item \n\nCivil works \n\nEquipment and materials \n\nUnexploded ordnance clearance \n\nConsulting services \n\nPoor households wiring credit \n\nSenior advisory service \nExecuting and implementing agency \nmanagement and administration \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConversion \nFactors \n\n \n\nForeign \n\nLocal \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \n\nLocal \n\nTotal \n\n0 \n\n9,801 \n\n22,315 \n\n111 \n\n2,619 \n\n0 \n\n600 \n\n102 \n\n365 \n\n5,659 \n\n6,182 \n\n472 \n\n655 \n\n750 \n\n0 \n\n827 \n\n15,460 \n\n28,497 \n\n583 \n\n3,274 \n\n750 \n\n600 \n\n929 \n\n1.08 \n\n1.08 \n\n1.08 \n\n1.08 \n\n1.08 \n\n1.08 \n\n1.08 \n\n1.08 \n\n1.00 \n\n0.92 \n\n1.00 \n\n0.92 \n\n0.92 \n\n1.00 \n\n0.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n1.00 \n\n365 \n\n15,791 \n\n30,282 \n\n554 \n\n3,431 \n\n750 \n\n648 \n\n937 \n\n6,347 \n\n59,106 \n\nPhysical contingencies \n\n4,597 \n\n1,382 \n\n5,979 \n\nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n40,145 \n\n16,292 \n\n56,437 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n6. \nTo reflect true economic values of costs, shadow price conversion factors are used. The \nproject preparatory technical assistance study carefully examined the shadow prices for the Lao \nPDR and suggests the following conversion factors: (i) 1.08 for tradable goods of foreign origin, \n(ii)  1.00  for  nontradable,  (iii)  1.08  for  foreign  labor,  and  (iv)  0.90  for  local  unskilled  labor. \nApplying  these  conversion  factors  to  the  cost  components,  the  economic  cost  of  the  project \namounts  to  $59.11  million.  In  addition  to  this  investment  cost,  the  economic  evaluation  takes \ninto  account  the  operation  and  maintenance  cost,  which  is  estimated  at  1%  of  the  investment \ncost  for  the  first  10  years,  and  2%  thereafter.  Since  benefits  are  estimated  at  end  use,  the \ngeneration  cost  must  be  subtracted.  This  is  to  avoid  double  counting  even  though  the \ngeneration cost is not part of the project costs. Generation cost is estimated to be 53% of EDL's \nlong-run marginal cost of supply according to the latest tariff study. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n44  \n \n\nProject Benefits \n\n \nD. \n \n7. \nThe  benefits  of the  project manifest  in  the  increase  of  electricity  sales to  consumers  in \nthe  with-project  scenario.  By  projecting  demand  forecasts  and  comparing  the  demand  without \nthe  project  with  the  demand  forecast  with  the  project,  the  increase  in  electricity  consumption \nwas established. \n \n\n1. \n\nProject Benefits from Domestic Power Sales \n\n \n8. \nThe  benefits  are  classified  as  incremental  and  nonincremental,  and  are  additive  to  the \ntotal  benefits.  They  are  quantified  based  on  the  gross  benefits  model  (Figure  A8).  Electricity \noutput of the project is defined as nonincremental if it replaces the existing supply of energy\u2014\nthe  without-project  source,  and  it  is  defined  as  incremental  if  it  meets  additional  or  induced \ndemand. \n \n\nFigure A8: The Gross Benefits Model \n\n \n\nSupply Curve Without Project\n\nDemand Curve (D)\n\n  Supply Curve With Project\n\nPwo        \n\nPw \n\na\n\nc\n\n b\n\n d\n\nQwo\n\nQw\n\nNon-Incremental\n\nIncremental\n\n \n\nNotes: \n1.

The  cost  of  electricity  substitutes  are \nestimated  for  residential  and  nonresidential  consumers  (including  industry,  commercial,  and \nagricultural users): \n(i) \n\nBased  on  data  from  the  socioeconomic  survey,  in  the  absence  of  electricity, \nhouseholds usually have to rely on diesel or kerosene and batteries (e.g., dry cell \nbatteries for radios and cassette players and 12-volt batteries for televisions). \nNonresidential  consumers  are  all  assumed  to  derive  energy  from  small  diesel \ngeneration sets.  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n10. \nIncremental consumption is valued as the weighted average of the cost of the alternative \nenergy source and the anticipated electricity tariff. For currently importing consumers, the value \nof  electricity  is  the  weighted  average  of  the  postproject  tariff  and  the  cost  of  supply  in  the \nabsence of the project (i.e., the import tariff). Similarly, in the case of other induced demand of \nresidential and nonresidential consumers, it is valued at the weighted average of the postproject \ntariff and the cost of substitutes in the absence of electricity. The project preparatory technical \nassistance study has developed detailed estimates of economic benefits of project electricity by \nconsumer category, and incremental and nonincremental consumption (Table A8.3). The values \nare applied for economic evaluation. \n \n\nTable A8.3: Estimates of Economic Values of Kilowatt-Hours of Electricity by Category \n \n\nItem \nNonincremental Benefits \nResidential \nNonresidential \nIncremental Benefits \nResidential \nNonresidential \nNonresidential (major loads) \nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\nKN/kWh \n \n\n3,128 \n2,756 \n\n1,742 \n1,806 \n1,317 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nProject Benefits from Exports to Thailand \n\nIn  addition  to  the  benefits  associated  with  domestic  power  sales,  the  project  will  make \n11. \npossible  incremental  power  exchange  with  Thailand  on  an  as-available  basis.  The  load  flow \nstudies  indicate  that  the  Paklay\u2013Thali  border  crossing  will  support  the  export  maximum  of  \n28 megawatts (MW) in 2014. In the dry season, imports reach 17 MW in 2014. The net export is \nconsidered  variable  and  nonfirm.  The  net  export  is  estimated  to  be  32.4  gigawatt-hours \n(GWh)/year, equivalent to $275,000 in net economic benefit. This resulting net benefit is added \nto project domestic sales revenues to estimate project economic benefits. \n \nE. \n \n12. \nThe evaluation of project costs and benefits are summarized in Table A8.4, which is an \neconomic resource statement for the life of the project. The economic net present value of the \nproject is $203.7 million. The project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated to be \n42.2%, well above the real economic opportunity cost of 12%. \n \n\nResults of the Analysis \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n46  \n \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\nF. \n \n13. \nA  sensitivity  analysis  was  undertaken  with  respect  to  key  risk  factors  and  assumptions \nexpected to influence the viability of the investment. The most important factor is the impact of \nindustrial loads on the benefits. To test this influence, the mining load is reduced to 40% below \nthe base case. The second factor is the project cost. The analysis allows for cost overruns up to \na  20%  increase  (very  high  according  to  EDL).  The  impact  of  net  export  is  also  analyzed  by \nlooking at the case that excludes the revenue from exports. The sensitivity analysis shows that \nthe  project's  economics are robust (Table  A8.5).  Even  in the  extreme  case  when  the  negative \nevents  are  considered  in  combination,  the  project  is  still  viable  with  net  present  value  of  \n$23.7 million and EIRR of 16%.  \n \n\nTable A8.4: Project Economic Resource Statement  \n($'000) \n\nYear\n\nBenefits\n\nCosts\n\nNet benefit\n\nNon-Incremental\n\nIncremental Total benefits Capital\n\nGeneration Distribution O&M\n\nTotal costs\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n18029\n\n23405\n\n17672\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2721.2\n\n2939.8\n\n3175.3\n\n3429.2\n\n3698.4\n\n3989.0\n\n4302.7\n\n4641.8\n\n5008.6\n\n5311.0\n\n5647.5\n\n5997.0\n\n6368.1\n\n6762.3\n\n7180.8\n\n7625.3\n\n8097.4\n\n8598.7\n\n9131.2\n\n9696.6\n\n10297.1\n\n10934.9\n\n11612.2\n\n12331.5\n\n12701.5\n\n13082.5\n\n13475.0\n\n13879.3\n\n14295.6\n\n14724.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n35493.1\n\n68681.1\n\n69001.0\n\n70073.2\n\n71365.0\n\n71855.7\n\n72357.5\n\n72908.9\n\n73472.0\n\n73926.3\n\n74400.2\n\n74908.1\n\n75447.7\n\n76021.0\n\n76630.0\n\n77277.0\n\n77964.4\n\n78694.6\n\n79470.5\n\n80294.7\n\n81170.4\n\n82100.8\n\n83089.3\n\n84139.4\n\n84676.5\n\n85229.7\n\n85799.4\n\n86386.3\n\n86990.7\n\n87613.3\n\n38214.2\n\n71620.9\n\n72176.3\n\n73502.4\n\n75063.4\n\n75844.6\n\n76660.2\n\n77550.7\n\n78480.6\n\n79237.2\n\n80047.7\n\n80905.1\n\n81815.9\n\n82783.3\n\n83810.8\n\n84902.3\n\n86061.8\n\n87293.4\n\n88601.6\n\n89991.3\n\n91467.5\n\n93035.7\n\n94701.4\n\n96471.0\n\n97378.0\n\n98312.2\n\n99274.4\n\n100265.5\n\n101286.4\n\n102337.8\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n14899.4\n\n28055.5\n\n28272.7\n\n28501.1\n\n28735.4\n\n28984.7\n\n29246.7\n\n29533.1\n\n29834.2\n\n30079.3\n\n30339.5\n\n30616.0\n\n30909.7\n\n31221.7\n\n31553.0\n\n31905.1\n\n32279.0\n\n32676.2\n\n33098.2\n\n33546.4\n\n34022.6\n\n34528.4\n\n35065.8\n\n35636.6\n\n35929.1\n\n36230.3\n\n36540.5\n\n36860.1\n\n37189.2\n\n37528.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n1258.6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n578.6\n\n591.2\n\n603.8\n\n616.4\n\n629.0\n\n641.5\n\n654.1\n\n666.7\n\n679.3\n\n691.9\n\n1409.0\n\n1434.1\n\n1459.3\n\n1484.5\n\n1509.6\n\n1534.8\n\n1560.0\n\n1585.2\n\n1610.3\n\n1635.5\n\n1660.7\n\n1685.8\n\n1711.0\n\n1736.2\n\n1736.2\n\n1736.2\n\n1736.2\n\n1736.2\n\n1736.2\n\n1736.2\n\n18029.1\n\n23405.1\n\n17672.2\n\n16736.6\n\n29905.3\n\n30135.1\n\n30376.0\n\n30622.9\n\n30884.9\n\n31159.4\n\n31458.5\n\n31772.1\n\n32029.8\n\n33007.1\n\n33308.7\n\n33627.6\n\n33964.7\n\n34321.3\n\n34698.5\n\n35097.6\n\n35520.0\n\n35967.1\n\n36440.5\n\n36941.9\n\n37472.9\n\n38035.4\n\n38631.4\n\n38923.9\n\n39225.1\n\n39535.3\n\n39854.9\n\n40184.0\n\n40523.0\n\n-18029.1\n\n-23405.1\n\n-17672.2\n\n21477.6\n\n41715.6\n\n42041.2\n\n43126.4\n\n44440.5\n\n44959.7\n\n45500.8\n\n46092.3\n\n46708.5\n\n47207.5\n\n47040.6\n\n47596.4\n\n48188.3\n\n48818.5\n\n49489.5\n\n50203.9\n\n50964.2\n\n51773.4\n\n52634.5\n\n53550.8\n\n54525.7\n\n55562.8\n\n56666.0\n\n57839.6\n\n58454.1\n\n59087.1\n\n59739.1\n\n60410.7\n\n61102.4\n\n61814.8\n42.2%\n\nEIRR =\n\n \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; O&M= operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n2026\n\n2027\n\n2028\n\n2029\n\n2030\n\n2031\n\n2032\n\n2033\n\n2034\n\n2035\n\n2036\n\n2037\n\n2038\n\n2039\n\n2040\n\n2041\n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n47 \n\nTable A8.5: Project Sensitivity Analysis \n\nNPV ($ million)  EIRR (%) \n\n Item \nBase \nExcluding export \n+20% cost \n\u201340% benefits \nCombined \n\n203.7 \n202.0 \n194.2 \n33.2 \n23.7 \n\n42.2 \n42.0 \n37.3 \n18.6 \n16.1 \n\nNPV = net present value; EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank calculation. \n \nRisk Analysis \n\nG. \n \n14. \nThe  risk  analysis  examines  the  range  of  project  outcomes  by  allowing  multiple  risk \nfactors  to  vary  randomly  (within  a  defined  range).  Three  key  risk  factors  identified  include  \n(i) capital and operating costs, (ii) sales ratio (i.e., the ratio of actual to planned GWh sales), and \n(iii)  the  value  of  nonincremental  benefits.  Probability  distributions  were  assigned  to  each \nvariable as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCapital  costs  during  construction  and  operating  costs  over  the  project  life  were \nallowed to vary randomly from 85% (low) to 115% (high), with a most likely value \n(mode) of 100% (i.e., their point-value in the model). \nProject  GWh  sales  were  allowed  to  vary  randomly  within  a  specified  range  to \nreflect  uncertainty  regarding  achievement  of  new  household  connection  targets \nnecessary to realize project benefits. The assumed range was 25% (low), 100% \n(mode), and 110% (high). \nThe  value  of  nonincremental  benefits  were  allowed  to  vary  from  85%  to  115% \n(around an average of 100%), reflecting uncertainty surrounding the point values \nassigned in estimating these benefits. \n\nThe  risk  analysis  was  conducted  based  on  10,000  Monte-Carlo  iterations,  with  the \n\n \n15. \noutput variable being the expected EIRR (Table A8.6).  \n \n\nTable A8.6: Risk Analysis\u2014Distribution of EIRR \n\n \n\n Item \nExpected EIRR (mean), % \nStandard deviation \nStandard error \nMaximum EIRR, % \nMinimum EIRR, % \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n Value \n42.2 \n\n2.35 \n0.00024 \n\n48.5 \n37.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n48  \n \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT \n\nCapital Costs \n\n \n1. \nThe  project's  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects1 of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  analysis \nassesses the financial viability of the project from the perspective of Electricite du Laos (EDL), \nthe  project  operating  entity.  The  financial  costs  and  benefits  employed  in  the  analysis  are \nexpressed in 2009 prices on an after-tax basis. Costs include only capital costs and operating \nand maintenance costs directly associated with the project. Likewise, benefits are restricted to \nanticipated  end-user  sales  from  the  project  based  on  the  average  retail  tariff  yield.  Financial \nviability is assessed on the basis of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) over the project\u2019s \neconomic useful life (2009\u20132041) relative to the cost of capital used to fund the project, which is \nmeasured by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The net present value is calculated \nas the net financial benefit of the project discounted at the WACC over its economic useful life. \n \nA. \n \nCapital  costs  include  a  115  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  (398  kilometers  [km])  and \n2. \nassociated  substations,  as  well  as  a  22  kV  distribution  line  (1,116  km)  and  medium-  and  low-\nvoltage substations. Capital costs include the base project costs plus physical contingencies but \nexclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction.  Costs  for  unexploded  ordnance \nclearance  are  included  in  the  capital  costs.  Annual  operating  and  maintenance  costs  are \nestimated  at  1%  of  capital  investment  costs  for  the  first  10  years,  and  2%  thereafter.  All  the \nworks are assumed to be completed over 3 years, commencing in 2010. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe weighted average residential tariff for the project areas will be KN502/kilowatt-hour \n(kWh)  ($0.0588/kWh)  in  2009,  and  will  be  increased  as  in  Table  A9.1.  The  project  area  tariff \nyield  for  the  base  case  is  assumed  to  be  set  at  85%  of  the  national  revenue  requirement  for \nresidential consumption. Nonresidential customers are assumed to receive electricity at medium \nvoltage at a tariff that is 76% of the national retail tariff as recommended in EDL\u2019s tariff study. \nSales  revenue  is  based  on  demand  forecast  per  customer  category  and  reflects  a  planned \nincrease in retail tariffs from 2009 to 2016. \n \n\nTariff \n\nTable A9.1: Tariff Table (Project Area) \n(constant prices) \n\nItem \n\nUnit  \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\nResidential tariff \n\n(KN/kWh) \n\nNon-residential \n\n(KN/kWh) \n\n(US cents/kWh) \n\n(US cents/kWh) \n\n502 \n\n5.88 \n\n452 \n\n5.29 \n\n555 \n\n6.50 \n\n499 \n\n5.84 \n\n597 \n\n6.99 \n\n538 \n\n6.30 \n\n628 \n\n7.35 \n\n565 \n\n6.62 \n\n647 \n\n7.58 \n\n582 \n\n6.81 \n\n641 \n\n7.51 \n\n577 \n\n6.76 \n\n667 \n\n700 \n\n7.81 \n\n8.20 \n\n600 \n\n631 \n\n7.03 \n\n7.39 \n\nKN = Lao kip; kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  project\u2019s  WACC  is  estimated  to  be  2.7%  expressed  on  an  after-tax  basis  (Table \nA9.2).

The cost of equity incorporated into the WACC is estimated on \nthe  basis  of  the  capital  asset  pricing  model,  which  provides  a  methodology  for  estimating  the \nrequired  equity  return  as  a function  of the  relative  risk  of the  investment. The cost  of  equity  is \nthe  rate  of  return  on  a  risk-free  investment,  such  as  government  bonds,  plus  a  risk  premium \nappropriate  for  the  project.2 The  cost  of  debt  is  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  assumption  that \nthe proceeds of the ADB grant and the Export and Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) loan \nare relent by the government to EDL at the 4.5% annual fixed rate. EDL is assumed to bear the \nforeign  exchange  risk  on  this  loan.  The WACC  is  then  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  costs  of \nequity  and  debt  weighted  by  the  inputs  of each.  Based  on  the  current financing  plan,  the total \nADB and Korea Eximbank financing represents 88.6% of the total project cost. This includes the \nrelent proceeds of the ADB grant, presently proposed to be $20 million, and a loan from Korea \nEximbank,  presently  proposed  to  be  $37.8 million  equivalent.  Based  on  this  weighting  of  debt \nand equity, the WACC is calculated at 2.7%. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nThe  FIRR  is  estimated  at  11.5%,  which  exceeds  the  WACC  of  2.7%.  Financial  net \npresent  value  of  the  project  is  positive  ($108.2 million).  Therefore, the  project  is  considered  to \nbe  financially  viable.  Overall,  these  results  are  encouraging  given  the  high  proportion  of \nrelatively  low-consumption  household  consumers  and  the  relatively  high  cost  of  providing \nservices  to  these  consumers.  This  is  supported  by  substantial  load  growth  forecast  from  new \nmining and industrial projects. \n \n\nResults \n\n                                                \n2  Estimating  the  risk-free  rate  and  risk  premium  for  the  project  is  complicated  by  the  lack  of  functioning  debt  and \nequity  markets  in  the  Lao  PDR.  An  estimate  of  the  risk-free  rate  was  calculated  on  the  basis  of  US  dollar \ndenominated  bonds  issued  by  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  and  then  adjusted  for  the  Lao  PDR.  Based  on  this \nmethodology, the risk-free rate is estimated at 11.5%. The risk premium is estimated on the basis of an analysis of \nstandard  risk  indicators  for  81  power  utilities;  64  in  the  United  States,  three  publicly  listed  independent  power \nproducers  in  Thailand,  and  11  power  utilities  in  other  countries.  Adjustments  were  then  made  to  reflect  the \nadditional market, tax, and country risks of the Lao PDR. Based on this methodology, the estimated cost of equity \nis 17.9% in nominal terms, which after adjusting for inflation is equivalent to a real cost of equity of 12.3%. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n50  \n \n\nRESETTLEMENT PLAN AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nProject Area \n\nA. \n \nThe  project  will  construct  three  115-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  lines  and  two  new \n1. \nsubstations;  upgrade  other  substations;  and  develop  medium-  and  low-voltage  distribution \nnetworks  in  Vientiane,  Phongsali,  and  Xaignabouli  provinces.  The  project  will  also  install  a \nmedium-voltage  distribution  network  for  approximately  18,800  new  households.  This  entails \nsmall  conductors  (wires)  from  the  nearest  substation  or  transformer,  supported  by  wooden  or \nconcrete  poles  of  small  (about  30  centimeters)  diameter,  along  roads  and  to  houses  requiring \nelectrification. \n \nBased  on  the  current  transmission  line  route,  physical  construction  will  involve \n2. \npermanent acquisition of a total of approximately 1,000 square meters (m2) for tower footprints \nfrom  28  households  based  on  tower  footprints  of  36  m2  per  tower.  The  project  will  require \ntemporary access roads to straining towers during line stringing.  \n \nB. \n\nResettlement Plan and Resettlement Framework \n\nLegal Framework \n\n3. \nA  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  for  the  115  kV  transmission  lines  and  new \nsubstations,  and  a  resettlement  framework  for  the  distribution  network.  The  resettlement  plan \nwill need to be updated after detailed design to ensure impacts are properly addressed and that \ncompensation methods and rates are appropriate at that time. Resettlement plans will need to \nbe  prepared  for  the  medium-voltage  distribution  facilities  in  accordance  with  the  approved \nresettlement framework. \n \n4. \nThe  overriding  principle  of  the  resettlement  plan  and  resettlement  framework  is  that \nwhere  a  person  or group  is  affected  by  land  acquisition,  damage  to  income-generating  assets \nand  activities  or  resettlement  as a result  of the project,  compensation  will  be  allocated  so that \nlivelihoods  are  the  same  or  better  than  before  the  project.  The  entitlement  matrix,  and \nresettlement policies and procedures set out in this resettlement plan reflect this principle. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe resettlement plan was prepared for the project in accordance with the requirements \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Operations \nManual  section  on  involuntary  resettlement. 1  The  plan  also  complies  with  the  laws  of  the \nGovernment  of  the  Lao  PDR  comprising  (i) Constitution  of  the  Lao  PDR,  1991;  (ii)  Decree \n192/PM  on  Compensation  and  Resettlement  of  People  Affected  by  Development  Projects, \n2005;  and  (iii)  associated  government  policies,  practices,  and  technical  guidelines  in  the \nRegulation  on  Resettlement  and  Compensation,  2005.  Also  relevant  are  the  Lao  PDR  Land \nLaw, 1997; the Forestry Law, 1996; the Electricity Act 2049, 1992; and the Electricity Law, 1997. \nADB policy provisions apply wherever gaps exist. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nProject entitlements are designed to provide for compensation and rehabilitation for lost \nland,  assets,  infrastructure,  resources,  income  sources,  and  services,  using  the  principle  of \nreplacement  cost  so  that  affected  people  will  be  at  least  as  well-off  after  the  project.  No \n\nEntitlements \n\n                                                \n1   ADB. 2006. Involuntary Resettlement. Operations Manual. OM F2.

All  affected \npeople  who  are  identified  in  the  project-impacted  areas  on  the  cut-off  date  will  be  entitled  to \ncompensation  for  their  affected  assets.  The  detailed  entitlement  matrix  illustrates  the  type  of \nlosses, entitled persons, entitlements, and possible implementation issues (Table A10.1).  \n \nE. \n \n7. \nIn  updating  the  resettlement  plan,  women  from  affected  households,  including  ethnic \nminority  women  and  households  headed  by  women,  will  be  consulted  during  socioeconomic \nsurveying  and  the  detailed  measurement  survey.  The  socioeconomic  profile  of  the  affected \npeople  and  detailed  measurement  survey  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender  and  ethnicity. \nWomen's  participation,  especially  ethnic  minorities,  poor  women,  and  households  headed  by \nwomen will be ensured during participation and disclosure activities. Information will be provided \nin the local language and in information booklets. Where the project involves granting new land \nor replacement land for acquired land, the title of land will be in the name of both spouses.   \n \nF. \n \n8. \nThe resettlement plan includes measures for stakeholder participation and full disclosure \nof  all  information  relating  to  the  project.  In  addition  a  project  information  booklet  prepared  by \nElectricite  du  Laos  (EDL)  was  distributed  to  affected  people  as  part  of  the  resettlement  plan \ndisclosure. All resettlement plan updates will be fully disclosed in accordance with ADB policy. \nSuch  disclosure  will  be  undertaken  orally  at  village  meetings  in  each  project  area  and  project \naffected  families  will  be  provided  with  an  information  booklet  outlining  the  methods  for \nmeasurement  of  losses,  detailed  asset  valuations,  entitlements  and  special  provisions, \ngrievance procedures, timing of payments, and displacement. \n \nG. \n \n9. \nThe project implementation unit and EDL field offices will establish and maintain ongoing \ninteraction with the affected people and communities to identify problems and undertake timely \nremedial  actions.  Formal  district  and  provincial  grievance  redress  committees  will  be  created \nand  include  representatives  of  local  institutions,  organizations,  nongovernment  organizations, \nwomen\u2019s unions, and community-based organizations.  \n \n10. \nIf a complainant is not satisfied with a grievance redress committee's determination, they \nmay take the matter to EDL and Water Resources and Environment Administration head offices \nand, if necessary, to court to resolve the matter. A detailed grievance procedure is in place and \nthe project will cover all administrative and legal costs incurred relating to the grievance redress \nprocedures. \n \nH. \n \n \n \n11. \nEDL  has  an  environmental  office  in  its  technical  department.  This  department  has  two \nsections  covering  environment  and  social,  and  a  total  of  11  staff,  one  of  whom  is  primarily \nresponsible  for  resettlement  planning.  This  office  is  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of \norganizations  involved  in  resettlement  including  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans,  and \nsupervision and management of resettlement plan implementation. The environmental office will \nwork in close conjunction with the project implementation unit. \n\nGrievance Redress Mechanism \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n1. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n52  \n \n\n2. \n\nLocal and Provincial Authorities  \n\n \n \n \n12. \nResettlement  committees  will  be  established  in  provinces  and  districts.  District \ncommittees  assume  the  key  role  in  assisting  the  project  in  various  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation  activities,  while  provincial  committees focus  on  ensuring consistent  application \nof the approved resettlement plan in the province. This is the same process being used for the \nADB-funded Northern Area Rural Power Distribution Project2 and other projects in the Lao PDR. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n4. \n\nto  be  satisfactorily \n\nimplemented  before \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n \n13. \nEDL proposes to use a turnkey contract to deliver the project. All resettlement activities \nwill  be  coordinated  with  the  civil  works  schedule,  so  that  adequate  time  will  be  planned  for \nresettlement  activities \nthe  commencement  of \nconstruction. ADB will not approve physical  works affecting affected peoples until resettlement \nactivities  are  satisfactorily  completed  and  agreed  rehabilitation  assistance  is  in  place. \nResettlement  implementation  will  not  commence  until  ADB  has  reviewed  and  approved  the \nresettlement  plan.  A  detailed  schedule  is  included  in  the  full  resettlement  plan  included  as  a \nsupplementary appendix to this report. \n \n \n \n14. \nThe resettlement plan will be monitored by the Vientiane-based and district-based EDL \nproject teams and the project implementation consultant, who will be required to have extensive \nsocioeconomic  monitoring  experience.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  undertaken  using \ndisaggregated  indicators  so  that  impacts  on  women,  and  ethnic  minorities,  can  be  clearly \nunderstood  and  acted  upon.  The  Vientiane-based  EDL  project  team  will  be  responsible  for \ndetermining if any follow-up actions are necessary and ensuring these actions are undertaken. \nThe  Water  Resources  and  Environment  Administration  will  conduct  its  own  monitoring  of  the \nproject\u2019s social and environmental impact, as required under Lao legislation. Monitoring will be \ncarried  out  for  the  duration  of  resettlement  plan  implementation  and  for  an  appropriate  period \nafter  commissioning  of  the  project  until  the  objectives  of  the  resettlement  plan  are  achieved. \nADB will receive quarterly monitoring reports and key aspects will be followed up during review \nmissions. \n \n\n5. \n\nBudget Estimates \n\n \n15. \nThe  current  budget  estimate  to  cover  the  resettlement  plan  implementation  costs  is \n$363,720, comprising permanent acquisition ($3,849), easement fee ($220,866), temporary use \nof  land  ($4,645),  consultation  and  dissemination  ($29,160),  monitoring  ($14,500),  HIV  and \nhuman trafficking mitigation ($30,000), contingency ($60,620). \n \n16. \nEDL  will  finance  the  costs  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  EDL  is  committed  to \nproviding  funds  for  necessary  updates  to  the  resettlement  plan  and  the  preparation  of \nresettlement  plans  as  required,  and  to  implement  the  resettlement  plan(s)  in  an  efficient  and \ntimely manner during the course of the project. \n\n                                                \n2   ADB.  2003.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n\nThe  government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  under  its  6th  National  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  reaffirms  that \nreducing poverty and accelerating the pace of social development are the most important long-term strategic goals. Its 5-year \nplan agenda for poverty reduction includes a concentrated effort to develop the poorest areas through a range of targeted \ninterventions. The project is located in the poor northern region, which is a focus of poverty reduction efforts under the 6th \nplan.  The  main  pillars  of  the  Lao  national  strategy  for  power  development  include  (i)  maintaining  and  expanding  an \naffordable, reliable, and sustainable electricity supply to promote economic and social development; and (ii) promoting power \ngeneration for export to provide revenues to meet the government\u2019s development objectives.   \n \nAccess  to  electricity  is  vital  for  poverty  reduction,  improvement  of  human  life,  and  socioeconomic  development.  The \ngovernment emphasizes development of infrastructure enabling business opportunities and pro-poor development as a key \npillar  of  the  strategy.  Accordingly,  the  government  has  set  the  target  of  achieving  90%  electrification  of  all  households  by \n2020  mainly  through  grid  extension.  About  50%  of  households  are  electrified  in  Xaignabouli  province,  one  of  the  project \nareas, still lower than the national average (58%). The northern provinces are among the poorest in the Lao PDR, as over \n58% of  households are poor, compared with 4.4% in Vientiane municipality. To eradicate poverty and promote sustainable \neconomic growth, one priority measure is to increase electrification by extending transmission lines in the north. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program  for  the  Lao  PDR  promotes  sustainable  economic  development \nthrough infrastructure investments and gives assistance to the power system with emphasis on rural electrification. Under the \nproject, grid expansion and distribution lines provide opportunities for rural electrification, and employment generation in the \nproject areas. \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: TI - Geographic \n1.  Key Issues  \nExpansion of the power transmission grid and rural electrification are crucial for development in the Lao PDR. Presently only \n58%  of  households  have  access  to  electricity,  which  is  one  of  the  lowest  electrification  rates  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  115 \nkilovolt (kV) system of Electricite du Lao (EDL) is fragmented and does not cover the whole country. Outside the grid, rural \nhouseholds must rely on expensive import, off-grid power supply, or do without. Expensive energy hinders rural development \nand exacerbates the rural\u2013urban income gap. Poverty is high with 29% living below the national line of $1.50 a day and nearly \n77% on less than $2 a day. The Poverty Reduction Fund (January 2007) defines households as being poor if they have an \nincome of less than KN85,000 per person per month. The project is designed with special focus to geographically target the \nnorthern  provinces  with  high  incidence  of  poverty.  The  project  will  include  remote  communities  of  these  provinces  for  grid \nconnection. Twenty-nine percent of all households in project areas are poor.  \n \nThe northern provinces have experienced an annual rate of poverty reduction of 2.1%, compared to Vientiane municipality at \n13.9%.  In  addition  to  isolation,  lack  of  education  is  a  contributing  factor  to  poverty.  Under  the  project,  18,800  households \n(among them 6,000 poor households) will be supplied with grid electricity. The project will support the government\u2019s effort to \nprovide all households in the country with electricity by 2020 as part of rural infrastructure provision in the government\u2019s 6th \nNational  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan.  The  household  electrification  rate  in  the  main  project  area  (Phongsali  and \nXaignabouli  provinces)  will  increase  from  39%  today  to  79%  by  2020.  New  small  businesses,  district  commerce,  and \nindustries in Phongsali and Xaignabouli provinces will also be provided with reliable electricity supply. The project outcome \nwill be increased access to electricity not only by households but also by small commercial, district, and industrial customers. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  northern  provinces  through  investment  in  economic \ndevelopment,  industrialization,  and  employment  generation.  The  provision  of  electricity  to  households  would  improve \nsocioeconomic  and  living  standards  in  high-poverty  geographic  areas.  Electricity  distribution  will  benefit  all  ethnic  groups \nequally in terms of access.  \n \n2. Design Features \nThe  cost  of  connecting  the  distribution  drop-down  to  a  house  is  approximately  KN700,000.  Most  poor  households  in  rural \nareas  have  difficulty  meeting  this  cost.  The  project  will  provide  poor  households  with  a  free  meter  (3/9  A)  and  a  credit  of \nKN700,000  to  connect  their  houses.  The  project  is  expected  to  reach  80%  of  poor  households  in  the  project  area.  It  will \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n56  \n \n\ninclude community information dissemination consultations to provide households with information on the project\u2019s pro-poor \nactivity.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe project area is divided into three modules. Module 1 is the Nohai\u2013Paklay\u2013Kentho component located in eastern Vientiane \nand  Xaignabouli  provinces.  Module  2  is  the  Paklay\u2013Xayabury  component  located  in  Xaignabouli  province.  Module  3  is  the \nNamo\u2013Boun Nua component situated in Oudomxai and Phongsali provinces. The project area includes 27 ethnic groups and \nsubgroups.  The social  analysis  indicates  that for a majority of  the  households  in  the  project  area  farming  and  livestock are \nimportant sources of livelihood. \n \nThe module 1 project area has a population of 23,317 and is notable for a large percentage (41%) of ethnic minority Hmong \n(Hmong-Mien)  and  Khmou  (Austro-Asiatic).  The  average  percentage  of  household  expenditure  on  energy  for  those  with \naccess  to  grid  electricity  was  5%;  nonconnected  households  with  lower  mean  incomes  spend  12%.  The  nonconnected \nhouseholds use batteries and generators to meet household energy needs, which is costly. Similarly the socioeconomic data \ndemonstrates  that  the  project  would  provide  considerable  potential  to  benefit  households  whose  total  energy  expenditure \ncould  easily  be  replaced  in  terms  of  affordability  by  grid  electricity,  which  in  real  terms  would  result in  more  energy  for  the \nsame  expenditure.  Social  and  poverty  assessment of households in  the  project  area  indicates  that  households  without  grid \nconnection use electricity (using rechargeable battery and generator) for household purposes such as lighting, television, and \nwater pump.  \n \nThe project\u2019s social analysis shows that 47% of respondents rank electricity as their first priority. Electricity is perceived as a \ncontributing  factor  for  improving  living  conditions  and  enhancing  learning  opportunities  for  children.  At  present  kerosene \nprovides a significant source of lighting; health problems related to its use are a concern. Access to electricity will increase \naccess  to  information  technology,  and  utilization  of  electric  equipment  and  computers  in  schools  and  health  facilities.  This \nwould result in improved education and health services. Street lighting will contribute to a safer night environment in villages.  \n\nThe construction of a substation for a transmission line will engage workers; this can pose potential risk of HIV and human \ntrafficking  in  the  campsites  and  surrounding  villages.  The  construction  contractors  will  undertake  an  awareness-raising \ncampaign to minimize risk of HIV and human trafficking in and around campsites. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Participants at a workshop conducted in March 2007 discussed the social and environmental impacts of the project, and \nthe resettlement plan. They included representatives of the Lao National Commission for Advancement of Women, the Lao \nWomen\u2019s  Union,  the  Centre  for  HIV/AIDS  and  STDs  (Ministry  of  Health),  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines,  Department  of \nElectricity, Environment Department, the EDL Environment and Resettlement Department, the Ethnic Minorities Department, \nLao National Front for Construction, the Water Resource of Environmental Agency, and the Project and Cooperation Division \nof the Department of Forestry.  \n \nThe project resettlement plan includes a gender strategy and ethnic minority specific actions, which will facilitate participation \nof  the  affected  households  in  a  detailed  measurement  survey,  and  discussion  on  land  acquisition  and  compensation.  The \nproject will disseminate information about provision of free electricity meters to poor households during the consultation with \npoor households. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nNo  C&P  plan  was  prepared.  However  consultation  will  be  carried  out  by  the  resettlement  committee  during  project \nimplementation. Expenses are already included in the resettlement plan. \n \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \nGender analysis of the project shows that most of women in the project area are engaged in farming, and 20% are operating \nsmall businesses from home. Eight percent of households are headed by women. Social assessment indicates that lack of \nelectricity in the project area is a constraint for women's household work, improved living conditions, and children's education. \nThe increase in access to electricity will reduce domestic drudgery of women through use of appliances such as electric water \npumps,  rice  cookers,  grinders,  and  food  processing  equipment,  and  would  have  a  positive  impact  on  poor  women's  daily \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nhousehold work. The safer environment at night will have a positive impact on women's mobility.  \nThe negative impact of the project relates to land acquisition and potential risk of HIV and human trafficking. The number of \nworkers during construction can pose potential risk of HIV and trafficking of women. Land acquisition for the project may have \nsome minor impacts on women's work that contributes to family subsistence. \n \n2.  Key  Actions.
