It will include a new 500-kV/220-kV substation to connect \nto the grid in Kabul, Afghanistan\u2019s capital.2 The project will be complemented by a second Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) power project under the proposed tranche 5 of ADB\u2019s Energy Sector \nDevelopment  Investment  Program  (footnote  2)  to  build  a  500-kV  substation  to  connect  to  the \ngrid at the northern end of the line in Dashte Alwan. Tranche 5 is expected to be endorsed by \nADB  Management  soon  after  the  ADB  Board  consideration  of  the  North\u2013South  Power \nTransmission  Enhancement  Project.  After  domestic  generation  projects  planned  in  northern \nAfghanistan  are  implemented  and  proposed  arrangements  for  greater  power  imports  from  the \ncountry\u2019s northern neighbors are put in place, the  projects would transmit the additional power \nfrom  these  sources  to  the  south  and  allow  for  the  export  of  power  in  excess  of  Afghanistan\u2019s \ndomestic  needs  to  Pakistan  over  a  planned  connection  between  the  country\u2019s  two  grids.  The \nline will also allow Afghanistan to facilitate power export to Tajikistan during winter.  \n \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nAfghanistan is a net energy importer. Power demand in major load centers is growing at \n25% per year. While indigenous renewable energy and fossil fuels resources exist, these need \nto be developed. During 2012, peak demand in Afghanistan stood at 670 MW, of which 500 MW \nwas  met  through  imports.  With  the  three  times  increase  in  electrification  rate  anticipated  by \n2032,  peak  demand  will  reach  3,500  MW  with  an  annual  power  consumption  of  18,400 \ngigawatt-hours.  Meeting  this  demand  requires  development  of  all  viable  import  and  local \ngeneration options. The project will connect northern indigenous generation and imported power \nsupply sources to the eastern and southern load centers in Afghanistan. \n \nThe  power  sector  in  Afghanistan  has  made  significant  progress  in  addressing  its \n4. \ntechnical,  fiscal,  and  governance  challenges  since  2001.  The  proportion  of  the  population \nconnected to the power grid increased from a mere 5% in 2002 to about 25% in 2012. System \nlosses (technical and commercial) dropped during the same period from more than 70% to 42%, \nand collection rates rose from less than 50% to more than 90%. Revenues have increased by \n15%  every  quarter  since  2009.  An  autonomous,  corporate  state-owned  power  utility\u2014Da \nAfghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS)\u2014has been established and is gaining ground. Currently, \n73%  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  power  supplies  are  being  imported\u201422%  from  Iran,  4%  from  Tajikistan, \n17% from Turkmenistan, and 57% from Uzbekistan. Import tariffs ranging from $0.020 to $0.065 \nper kilowatt-hour are subsidized by the exporting countries.  \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  project,  including  10  other  investment  projects,  was  prepared  under  a  subcomponent  of  ADB.  2008.  Report \nand  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Multitranche  Financing  Facility  and \nAdministration  of  Grant  Energy  Sector  Development  Investment  Program.  Manila  (MFF  0026-AFG,  $570  million, \napproved on 2 December). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nAfghanistan currently has 10 isolated power grid islands that are fed by different power \n5. \nsystems  through  220-kV  and  110-kV  links.  This  split  creates  system  inefficiencies,  increases \noperational  cost,  and  reduces  reliability  of  power  supply.    An  ADB-supported  government \nstrategic  power master plan for  2012\u20132032  calls for  the  connection  of  these separate  network \nsegments  via  a  ring  structure  of  500-kV  transmission  lines  and  the  expansion  of  distribution \nnetworks across urban and rural load centers.3 \n\n \n6. \n Kabul  and  provincial  capitals  in  all  eastern  and  southern  provinces  experience  load-\nshedding  due  to  a  power  shortage.  A  key  challenge  is  to  strengthen  infrastructure  capacity \nneeded  to  transmit  power  to  Afghanistan\u2019s  eastern  and  southern  provinces,  including  Kabul. \nThe power imports are expected to grow from 300 MW in 2012 to 600 MW by 2018.4  Currently \nthe only transmission link connecting northern Afghanistan to the south is a 220-kV transmission \nline  with  a  capacity  of  300  MW.  This  limits  the  supply  of  power  in  the  areas  south  of  the \nHindukush  mountain  range.  This  in  turn  constrains  economic  growth  and  opportunities  in  the \nsouth; creates disparities in the country\u2019s economic development; and fuels ethnic and regional \ntensions, insecurity, and discontent.  \n\n \n7. \nThe transmission line and substation to be provided under the project, combined with the \nsubstation needed to complete the system to be financed under tranche 5 of the Energy Sector \nDevelopment  Investment  Program,  will  be  central  to  the  envisaged  regional  power  trade  and \nAfghanistan\u2019s important future role in it as an energy resource corridor connecting Central Asia\u2019s \npower  systems  with  its  own  and  those  of  South  Asia.  A  proposed  Turkmenistan\u2013Uzbekistan\u2013\nTajikistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan  (TUTAP)  power  transmission  interconnection  would  boost \nregional  cooperation  and integration through  this  energy trade  by  enabling  exporting  countries \nto  make  profitable  use  of  their  surplus  resources  and  importing  countries  to  effectively  meet \ntheir energy needs at cost.5 \n\n \n8. \nThe project is identified in the power master plan and in the Afghanistan National Energy \nSupply Program as the link most needed to meet the country\u2019s future power needs. The project \nis  connected  to  upstream  power  generation  and  power  transmission  and  downstream  power \ntransmission and distribution projects. The power link between Central Asia and South Asia is a \nstrategic objective of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation program countries and is \nincluded  in  the  program\u2019s  Strategy  2020  and  energy  work  plan,  2013\u20132015.  The  project  is \nincluded  in  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u201320136 and  country  operations  business \nplan, 2013\u20132014 for Afghanistan.7 \n\n \nDABS  has  been  undertaking  a  comprehensive  program  since  2008  to  import  power, \n9. \ndevelop  domestic generation,  and  expand  its grids  to  close  a gap  between demand for  power \n\n                                                \n3   ADB.  2010.  Technical  Assistance  to  Afghanistan  for  the  Power  Sector  Master  Plan.  Manila  (TA  7637-AFG,  $1.5 \n\nmillion, approved on 6 November). \n\n4   The  220-kV  import  lines  from  Tajikistan  and  Uzbekistan  are  operational  and  were  financed  by  ADB  under  the \nEmergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project  and  the  Regional  Power  Transmission \nInterconnection Project. Under the power purchase and sales agreement, power imports from Tajikistan are up to \n300 MW during March\u2013October each year and are up to as 300 MW all year round from Uzbekistan. Afghanistan is \ncurrently importing 50 MW of power from Turkmenistan. The new 500-kV transmission line from Turkmenistan, to \ninterconnect  power  grids  of  Afghanistan  and  Turkmenistan,  will  be  completed  by  2018  and  will  import  up  to  300 \nMW of power from Turkmenistan.  \n\n5 TUTAP is a regional power project under Central Asia South Asia Regional Electricity Markets framework. \n6 ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n\n\fand supply.8  Afghanistan\u2019s National Energy Supply Program is based on plans to combine the \ndevelopment of domestic power generation from domestic fossil fuel and renewable energy with \nan increase in power imports.9 In addition to meeting its domestic needs on time and in a cost-\neffective  manner  through  diversified  imports,  Afghanistan  also  plans  to  develop  a  transit \ntransmission  system  through  the  country  to  move  power  from  energy-rich  Central  Asian \ncountries to consumers in energy-scarce South Asia. \n  \n10. \nThe  government  has  developed  the  country\u2019s  power  sector  strategy,  road  map,  policy \nframework, and envisaged investment plan in line with the power sector master plan 2012\u20132032. \nThe power  master  plan builds  upon  the  Afghanistan  National  Development  Strategy  crafted  in \n2008.  The  power  sector  in  Afghanistan  has  made  substantial  progress  in  meeting  strategic \nobjectives and road map milestones set out in 2008, including (i) greater efficiency from existing \noperations (rehabilitation of hydropower plants and transmission and distribution networks); (ii) \nimprovement  in  sector  governance  (formulation  of  an  electricity  law,  renewable  energy  policy, \nand creation of an autonomous power utility); (iii) promotion of rural electrification (development \nof  off-grid  solutions  and strengthening  on-grid networks);  and (iv)  investments  in  new  capacity \n(development  of  additional  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  systems).  Lessons \nincorporated from ADB\u2019s ongoing investments in Afghanistan\u2019s energy sector include the need \nto  (i)  build  security  provisions  into  project  design  and  financing,  (ii)  simplify  procurement  and \nimplementation  through  use  of  turnkey  contracting  as  the  default  choice,  (iii)  improve  project \nreadiness through advance actions, and (iv) provide capacity support to DABS.   \n\n11. \nDABS  has  institutionalized  operations  and maintenance (O&M)  protocols  and systems. \nAn  O&M  unit  under  the  operations  department  has  been  established  and  strengthened,  with \nadequate budgetary resources allocated from  utility\u2019s internal revenues. ADB, the World Bank, \nand  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  are  providing  capacity  support \nthrough  training  programs.  In  total,  nearly  $45  million  of  O&M  capacity  support  programs  are \ncurrently being implemented.  \n\n12. \nSince  2010,  the  ADB-financed  program  management  and  project  implementation \nconsultants  recruited  under  ADB\u2019s  multitranche  financing  facility  (footnote  2)  have  been \nproviding  on-the-job \nfinancial  management, \nprocurement, and social safeguards areas. In parallel, the Government of the United States is \nimplementing  $200  million  in  capacity  support  programs  to  strengthen  DABS\u2019  capacity  in \ntechnical, governance, financial management, and planning functions. \n\nto  DABS  personnel \n\ntechnical, \n\ntraining \n\nin \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe impact will be increased power trade between Afghanistan and its neighbors, and a \nhigher rate of electrification within the country. The outcome of the project will be an increased \nsupply of power from the north of Afghanistan to its southern and eastern regions.  \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  output  will  be  a  500-kV  transmission  line  constructed from  Dashte Alwan  to  Kabul \n\n14. \nand a 500-kV/220-kV substation built at Arghundy in Kabul.  \n\n                                                \n8  The  program  includes  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  new  hydropower  plants  in  Afghanistan\u2019s  eastern  and \nsouthern provinces, gas-powered thermal plants in northern provinces, and diesel-generated plants in major load \ncenters across Afghanistan. \n\n9  The National Energy Supply Program is one of 24 national priority programs that have been jointly endorsed by the \n\nGovernment of Afghanistan and the country\u2019s international development partners. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nD. \n \n16. \n\n  \n\nA.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nThe project will add up to 1,000 megawatts (MW) to the existing 300 MW of transmission \n15. \ncapacity  between  northern  and  southern  Afghanistan.

This  is  in line  with \n\n                                                \n10 Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and detailed cost estimates by financier are included in the project \n\nadministration manual (PAM) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 A  country's  eligibility  for  the  ADF  grants  under  the  revised  grant  framework  is  determined  by  its  risk  of  debt \ndistress.  The  latest  debt-sustainability  analysis  determined  that  Afghanistan  had  a  high  risk  of  debt  distress  and \nwas therefore eligible to receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n\n12 AITF is an ADB-administered fund for infrastructure development financing in Afghanistan. The contributors include \nthe  governments  of  Japan,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  United  States  of  America.  The  AITF  financiers  have \napproved and confirmed cofinancing of $57 million for the project. \n\n13 Taxes  and  duties  costs  are  the  business  receipt  tax,  estimated  at  2%;  the  fixed  tax  on  imports  of  2%\u20137%;  and \ncustom  duties  of  2.5%\u201316%.  They  do  not  represent  an  excessive  share  of  the  financing  plan  and  are  within \napplicable country partnership strategy  parameters. ADB. 2005.

The  Board  is  requested  to  approve  the \nproposed  additional  AITF  grant,  and  administration  thereof,  in  the  event  that  such  additional \nfunds are contributed to AITF.14 Application of such additional AITF funds to the project shall be \nreported to the Board in accordance with standard reporting procedures. \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n20. \nDABS  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  is  a  100%  state-owned  corporate  entity \nresponsible  for  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  in  Afghanistan.  DABS  was \nincorporated in March 2008 and operationalized on 30 September 2009 through a presidential \ndecree.  DABS  is  the  legal  successor  to  all  rights  and  obligations  of  Da  Afghanistan  Breshna \nMousasa. \n \n21. \nDABS has an established, full-time program management office (PMO) that administers \nthe  ADB-assisted  Energy  MFF  (footnote  2).  The  PMO  administers  all  consulting  and \nprocurement  contracts  and  is  responsible  for  preparing  project  plans,  bid  evaluation  reports, \nprogress reports, applications for withdrawal of funds, and any other  reports required by ADB. \nThe  PMO  has  30  personnel.  The  staff  comprises  a  project  director,  engineers,  procurement \nspecialists, financial specialists, and safeguards specialists.  \n\n \n22. \nThe project\u2019s turnkey transmission line and substation package and the implementation \nsupervision  consulting  package  will  be  cofinanced,  with  AITF  funds  being  front-end  loaded  for \ndisbursement  purposes  for  both  the  turnkey  and  consulting  services  contracts.  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) resources will be disbursed only after 100% of the AITF funds have \nbeen disbursed. It is expected that AITF funds will finance the first $54.0 million of the turnkey \ncontract and the first $3.0 million a project supervision consultancy contract, with ADB financing \n\n                                                \n14 By a letter dated 23 October 2013, the Government of Afghanistan agreed to such substitution of financing for the \n\nproject in the event of such additional AITF contribution. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nthe  remaining  components.  The  use  of  contingency  funds  will  follow  the  same  disbursement \nprocedure. \n\n \n23. \n  Procurement of works and goods to be financed under the project will be undertaken in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nInternational  competitive  bidding  will  be  used  for  the  500-kV  transmission  line  and  the  500-\nkV/220-kV  substation  turnkey  contract  package,  comprising  two  lots:  one  for  transmission  line \ncomponent and one for the substation component. \n\n \n24. \nAll  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  A  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  using \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  under  a  full  technical  proposal.  This  is  required  due  to  the \ncomplex  nature  of  the  consulting  tasks  and  the  critical  nature  of  the  project\u2019s  projected \ndownstream impact.  \n \n25. \ncommitment procedures.  \n\nADB will disburse the funds for the turnkey contract package through direct payment and \n\n \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n26. \nthe PAM (Appendix 2).15 \n \n\nAspects \n\nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurementa  \n\nConsulting services  \n\nRetroactive financing and/or \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nApril 2014\u2013December 2016 \n31 December 2016 \n\nMinistry of Finance \nDa Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) \nProgram Management Office established in DABS, with 30 staff members \nInternational competitive bidding \n(single-stage, two-envelope) \n\n1 contract with \n2 lots \n\n$181 million \n\nQuality- and cost-based selection \n\n$6 million \n\n219 person-\nmonths \n\nImplementation consultant and contractor will be engaged under advance \ncontracting.

The  consultant  firm  undertook  due  diligence  of  the  proposed  transmission  line  and  the \nsubstation  project.  The  firm  confirmed  that  forecast  demand  and  export  potential  justified  the \nconstruction  of  the  500-kV  transmission  line  and  a  500-kV/220-kV  substation,  and  that  the \nlinking upstream and downstream investments were adequate.17 Firms qualified to perform the \nturnkey contract are available in the international market. The turnkey contractor will train DABS \nstaff in operation and maintenance. \n \n28. \nADB conducted technical due diligence on the proposed project and is satisfied with the \nquality of the cost estimates, operating cost structures, appropriateness of the technology, and \nthe execution plan. The project readiness level is high, and the technical solutions proposed are \nconsidered to be more cost-effective than the alternatives.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n29. \nThe  economic  and  financial  analysis  considered  the  500-kV  transmission  line  and  the \n500-kV/220-kV substation at Dashte Alwan of the project, together with the 500-kV substation at \nthe Arghundy end of the line expected to be financed under the MFF, as one undertaking. While \nfinanced  separately  under  two  ADB \nindividual  power  system \ninterventions, \ncomponents\u2014the  transmission  line  and  the  two  end-line  substations\u2014are  complementary, \ninterdependent and mutually inclusive, and will produce overall incremental benefits as a whole \nthat cannot be broken down financially or economically into parts.  \n\nthe  three \n\n30. \n The analysis found the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) under the base case to be \n8.97%. Based on sensitivity testing, the FIRR remained at 7.32% under a scenario of a 20.00% \nincrease in estimated capital costs. The FIRR decreased to 6.26% if the line capacity was only \n80.00% used due to lower-than-expected demand development. The FIRR was 8.37% with an \nincrease  of  20.00%  in  estimated  O&M  costs.  These  FIRRs  are  higher  than  the  estimated \nweighted average cost of capital of 0.87%. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that \nthe financial viability of the project would remain robust under adverse conditions.  \n\n31. \n The  analysis  showed  a  base  case  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  26.19%. \nThe  EIRR  was  also  robust  under  the  adverse  conditions  projected  by  sensitivity  analysis.  An \nincrease in estimated capital costs by 20.00% reduced the EIRR to 22.88%, still well above the \n12.00% benchmark. The EIRR remained well over 12.00% with a 20.00% decrease in estimated \nenergy transmission and with a 20.00% increase in projected O&M costs. If willingness-to-pay \nwas measured with the long-run marginal cost as a basis, the EIRR would increase to 41.57%.  \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n32. \nADB\u2019s  financial  management  assessment  of  DABS  found  that  it  follows  accrual \naccounting, double-entry bookkeeping, and other generally accepted accounting principles and \nconventions  in  compliance  with  international  standards.  Its  annual  financial  statements  for  the \nfirst 3 years, FY2010\u2013FY2012, have been audited and considered acceptable by ADB. Project \nfinancial  statements for ADB-financed  projects  have been  prepared,  audited,  and  submitted  to \nADB on time since 2010. \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \n16 Tranche  1  had  a  component  for  conducting  due  diligence  and  preparing  future  projects  listed  under  the \n\ngovernment\u2019s national priority program for the energy sector. \n\n17 The 500-kV/220-kV substation at the northern end of the 500-kV transmission line is to be financed under tranche 5 \n($49.1 million) of the multitranche financing facility (MFF-0026). Tranche 5 is being processed in parallel with this \nproject. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fTo continue improving the corporate and financial management capacities of DABS and \n\n33. \nto ensure appropriate governance arrangements for project-related activities, the project will  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nmake use of the existing PMO and maintain separate project accounts, \nrecruit an international consulting firm to assist in project implementation, \nestablish  a  direct  payment  procedure  and/or  commitment  procedure  for \ndisbursements to contractors and consultants, and \nrequire that an independent auditor acceptable to ADB be engaged by DABS to \naudit  project  and  corporate  financial  statements  annually  in  accordance  with \napplicable ADB requirements. \n\n \n34. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and DABS. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nThe  project  does  not  entail  direct  impacts  on  affordability  or  operational  employment \n35. \nopportunities. During construction, the contractor will be required to ensure equal opportunities \nfor  all  social  groups,  equal  pay  for  equal  work  regardless  of  gender,  and  prohibition  of  child \nlabor.   \n \n36. \n \nE. \n\nThe project has no gender elements, therefore, gender monitoring is not required.  \n\nSafeguards \n\n37. \nThe  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  DABS  prepared  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IIE) report, including an environmental management plan (EMP) in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  environmental  impacts \nanticipated during the construction are site-specific and temporary and can be mitigated through \nimplementation  of  the  EMP.  Potential  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  during  operations \ninclude fragmentation of the bird habitats and the electrocution or injury of birds through collision \nand contact with wires in the vicinity of Salang-Kotal bird habitat. The EMP mitigation measures \nare  adequate  and  include  the  careful  routing  of  the  transmission  line  to  be  undertaken  during \ndetailed  design,  which  will  consider  a  baseline  ornithological  survey  in  the  vicinity  of  Salang-\nKotal bird habitat; specially designed poles, conductors, and insulators; and the provision of bird \ndiverters. The draft initial environmental examination report was disclosed on the ADB\u2019s website \non  23  August  2013.  The  current  security  situation  along  the  line  route  has  made  it  difficult  to \nconsult effectively with communities. The public consultations will be conducted and the IIE and \nEMP  updated  prior  to  construction.  Implementation  of  the  EMP  will  be  reported  through \nenvironmental monitoring reports, which will be submitted to ADB semiannually. Environmental \nspecialists of the implementation consultant will provide additional support to the PMO. \n \n38. \nThe project is category C for indigenous peoples. The field social survey found that no \nethnic minority, as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), will be involved in or \naffected  by  the  project.  The  project  is  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Based  on  the \npreliminary project design, a land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) has been prepared \nin  close  consultation  with  12  affected  households.  It  was  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  22 \nAugust 2013, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. A detailed socioeconomic \nsurvey was carried out in May 2013. Once the contractor completes the detailed design, DABS \nwill update the LARP and submit it to ADB for approval. No civil works will start until the LARP is \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\ffully  implemented  by  DABS.  The  transmission  line  will  run  mainly  through  government  land \nalong the existing 220-kV transmission line. The substation site is owned by the government. \n \n39. \nImplementation  of  the  LARP  will  be  monitored  semiannually  and  a  report  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB.  The  report  will  include  the  number  of  affected  households  that  have  been \npaid  compensation,  the  amount  paid,  and  the  locations  where  compensation  was  completed \nand structures demolished, if any.  \n\n \nADB will review the periodic environment and resettlement monitoring reports submitted \n40. \nsemiannually  by  DABS  during  project  construction.  DABS  will  develop  and  implement  an \nappropriate corrective action plan agreed upon with ADB to rectify any default on the safeguard \nrequirements covenanted in the legal agreements or any other failure to comply with safeguards. \nThe environment and resettlement monitoring reports and any corrective action plan submitted \nby DABS during project implementation will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website upon receipt. ADB's \nmonitoring and supervision activities will continue until a project completion report is issued. \n\nF. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n41.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n \n\nRisks \n\nExecuting agency\u2019s non-\nexperience with 500-kV \ntechnology. \n\nProcurement and \nimplementation of \nturnkey contract could be \ndelayed. \nGovernance and capacity \nissues could negatively \naffect the project. \n\nMitigating Measures \nProcurement packaging will be minimized with one implementation consultant package \nand one turnkey contract package. \nInternational consulting firms will be recruited to help DABS in the procurement of the \nturnkey contract and in supervising project implementation. \nAll procurement and consultant recruitment will require prior approval by ADB. \nProcurement oversight will be complemented by a credible protest review mechanism \nand access to procurement-related information on the DABS and ANDS websites. \nThe procurement and financial management reviews by ADB and other development \npartners have confirmed that adequate systems have been institutionalized. DABS is \ngaining financial autonomy and has an independent board. Internal audit system is \nbeing strengthened by USAID intervention. \nUnder its ongoing MFF since 2009, ADB is providing extensive capacity support to \nDABS to improve its technical, financial/ economic, social safeguards, and procurement \nfunctions. This has strengthened the project preparation and implementation areas. \nSufficient technical training is being imparted to DABS by other development partners \nand by ADB. The training will be provided during project design and implementation by \nthe contractor. This will be the second 500-kV line in Afghanistan and the first one is \nunder procurement under another project. \nThe cost estimates are consistent with the engineers\u2019 design and recent turnkey \ncontract awards. Adequate contingency is provided in the project financing plan. \nWhile security remains a key concern, experience in attracting qualified bidders and in \nimplementing similar projects indicates the project can be successfully implemented.  \nAdequate funds have been budgeted for security and demining activities during project \nconstruction and implementation. The turnkey contractor will prepare the project \nsecurity plan which will be endorsed by the consultant, government and ADB  \n\nThe project could \nencounter cost overruns. \nDifficult security \nenvironment could affect \nprocurement of quality \ncontractors/consultants \nand thereby delay project \nimplementation. \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ANDS  =  Afghanistan  National
