THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nadministration of a loan of up to $6,000,000, to be provided by the Clean Technology Fund \n(CTF)1 to Simpa Energy India Private Limited (Simpa) for the Off-Grid Prepaid Solar Leasing \nProject in India.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  More people in India lack access to electricity than in any other nation in the world. In \n2012, the International Energy Agency estimated the number at 304 million, most of whom live \nin  rural  areas  outside  the  reach  of  conventional  electricity  grid  networks,  so  they  rely  on \nkerosene as their primary source of lighting, if and when available.3 According to a recent report \nby the Climate Group, about 77 million households in India (or about 360 million people) lack \nadequate access to grid electricity, with an additional 20 million underserved households (about \n95  million  people)  receiving  less  than  4  hours  of  reliable  electricity  per  day.4 While  the \navailability  of  grid  electricity  is  expected  to  improve  by  2025\u2014if  the  current  rate  of  grid \nexpansion, urbanization, and population growth continue to hold\u2014it is estimated that 70 million\u2013\n75 million households will still lack access to grid electricity in India by 2024. Over 90% of these \nhouseholds live in rural areas where population growth rates are higher and grid expansion \nrates are lower than in urban areas, so it is unlikely that the number of rural households that are \ncurrently not served or underserved by the electricity grid will fall significantly by 2024. Solar \nphotovoltaic  technology  offers  a  clean  alternative  to  address  off-grid  access  to  electricity. \nHowever, the effective decentralized energy solutions using solar photovoltaic technology, such \nas solar home systems (SHSs) and community-scale solar micro-grids, involve significant up-\nfront costs for rural consumers and have, as a result, very limited market penetration. \n  \n3.  Simpa, a wholly owned subsidiary of Simpa Networks Inc., targets the underserved and \nunelectrified  rural  population  in  India  by  providing  simple,  affordable, and  accessible  solar \nenergy to consumers (households and microenterprises).  \n \n2.  Project Design   \n4.  Simpa is an entrepreneurial company that offers a secure, prepaid payment platform to \nmake clean energy solutions simple and affordable for underserved electricity consumers in \nIndia. The \u201ctechnology + service + finance\u201d platform leverages cell phones to unlock demand \nfrom  consumers  while  providing  risk  mitigation  for  the  company,  which  finances  the  solar \nequipment. Simpa\u2019s clients are typically (i) rural households with no connection to the national \nelectricity grid; (ii) rural households getting less than 12 hours of electricity supply per day from \nthe grid; and (iii) microenterprises such as tea stalls, village shops, and small restaurants. \n                                                \n1  See the Climate Investment Funds. http://www.cif. climateinvestmentfunds.org \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  International  Energy  Agency.  World  Energy  Outlook.  http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/resources/ \nenergydevelopment/energyaccessdatabase/ (accessed 17 August 2015). \n4  Climate Group (in partnership with Goldman Sachs). 2015. The Business Case for Off-grid Energy in India. New \nDelhi (with data and analysis from International Finance Corporation. 2015. Assessment of the Off-Grid Solar \nAppliance Lighting Market in India. Market research report. New Delhi). \n ", "2 \n \n \n5.  Under  the  prepaid  pricing  for  SHSs,  Simpa\u2019s  customers  make  a  small  initial  down \npayment for the installation of a solar photovoltaic system and then prepay an availability charge \non a per day basis for the energy usage, with the flexibility to top up their systems in small user-\ndefined increments using a cell phone. Once a payment (e.g., 30 days of usage) is made using \nthe short message service (SMS), the user immediately receives an SMS with a (top-up) code \nthat can be entered using the keypad on the SHS meter. Thereafter, the system debits the \nuser\u2019s account based on the actual energy usage. Each payment for energy contributes toward \nthe amortization of the system purchase price, with the customer having the option to buy the \nsystem at predetermined prices at various intervals throughout the product lifecycle. Once fully \npaid  (typically  2\u20133  years  after  the  initial  purchase),  the  system  unlocks  permanently  and \ncontinues to produce electricity for the customer without any further payments. This transforms \nthe recurrent energy expenditure, which used to be spent on kerosene, into an asset purchase. \n \n \n3.  The Borrower \n6.  Simpa is a wholly owned (and the only) subsidiary of Simpa Networks Inc., a company \nincorporated in the State of Delaware.  \n \n7.  Paul  Needham  is  the  chief  executive  officer  of  Simpa  and  is  supported  by  an \nexperienced management team. Simpa\u2019s management team comprises a mix of local and \nforeign professionals with experience across a variety of fields including solar finance, energy \naccess, micropayments, and information technology.  \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n8.  Impacts. The project will (i) improve access to off-grid electricity supply to the rural \npopulation in India, the availability of which can yield benefits such as improved education \noutcomes as children can study after sunset and improved hygiene; (ii) reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions by substituting kerosene with solar energy, also improving air quality and benefiting \nthe respiratory health of household members; and (iii) improve access to gender benefits for \nfemale beneficiaries. Successful implementation of this off-grid energy solution across India \ncould also have a demonstration effect in neighboring Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan, which \nhave chronic power shortages and a high percentage of unelectrified rural households. Further \ncapital infusion will also give credence to the case for increasing financing for innovative off-grid \nrenewable energy solutions in South Asia. \n \n9.  Outcome. The project will result in increased access to clean energy for a quarter of a \nmillion households by 2017, while avoiding 77,108 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. \n \n10.  Output. The output of the project is installation of sustainable solar systems for houses \nand microenterprise. Project\u2019s successful implementation will result in the production of at least \n103.3 gigawatt-hours per annum from clean energy with locally purchased goods and services \namounting to Rs1.6 billion by 2017. Simpa\u2019s marketing initiative will also reach 25,000 women \nbeneficiaries. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n11.  Consistency with ADB Strategy and country strategy. The financing is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 as it relates to two of the five core focus areas\u2014\n ", "  3 \ninfrastructure and environment.5 Under its Strategy 2020, ADB is committed to expanding the \nsupply of energy in an environmentally sustainable way.6 The investment is also aligned with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2013\u20132017, which highlights access to energy as \none of key areas of ADB\u2019s engagement.7 \n \n12.  Consistency with energy policy. The investment will directly contribute to the outcome \nof increasing the number of households with access to electricity and, thereby, will be consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy for All Program initiative under which commitments have been made for \nscaling up access to affordable, modern, and clean energy for the rural poor. \n \n13.  Consistency with ADB operations. ADB has been one of the leaders in supporting \nprivate sector initiatives for solar energy in India, and has been instrumental in supporting utility \nscale and off-grid solar initiatives. The investment highlights ADB\u2019s multi-product approach to \nsupporting private sector investors for both utility scale and off-grid solar projects, and its ability \nto customize its financial products to cater to market needs and take associated risks. \n \nD.

A loan of up to $6,000,000 to Simpa funded entirely by the CTF and administered by \nADB is proposed.8  The proceeds of the loan will be used to finance an estimated 30,000 SHSs. \nThe facility has been structured keeping in view the long-term objectives of the CTF, including \nachieving  scale,  potential  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  development  impact, \nminimum concessionality, and catalyzing more financing into the renewable energy space (such \nas Simpa\u2019s off-grid solar venture).   \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n16.  ADB\u2019s participation allows the company to access long-term debt presently unavailable \nfrom commercial lenders. ,. This transaction allows Simpa to access ADB\u2019s network, knowledge, \nand experience in the solar sector, especially in India where ADB has deep understanding of \nboth utility level and off-grid needs and has played an important role from both the policy and \nproject perspectives. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n17.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the project were assessed, as well as the institutional \ncapacity  and  commitment  of  Simpa  for  environmental  and  social  management.  Simpa\u2019s \nbusiness activities have minimal or no adverse environmental, health, and safety impacts and \nare unlikely to entail impacts on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Simpa will \ncomply with applicable national laws and regulations on environment, health, and safety. \n \n18.  A  gender  action  plan  is  prepared  to  capture gender  measures  implemented  in the \nproject. 9  Gender  measures  include  launching  marketing  initiatives  targeting  women \nbeneficiaries, monitoring the number of women in households who have improved access to \nelectricity through the use of Simpa\u2019s products, and prioritizing and monitoring the number of \nwomen staff and village level entrepreneurs. Simpa will comply with national labor laws and, \npursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  social  protection  strategy,  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the \ninternationally recognized core labor standards.10 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on \n(i) its compliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people will be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements.11 \n \n                                                \n8  In May 2014, the trust fund committee of the CTF approved a $34.5 million regional program\u2014the Renewable \nEnergy Mini-Grids and Distributed Power Generation Program\u2014to be administered by ADB over a 3-year period \nthrough private sector operations. Approval of individual investments has been fully delegated to ADB in line with \nCTF governance arrangements. An investment in Simpa is referenced in the proposal and was well received. The \nproposal and approval for this program can be found at \n    http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org/cif/content/approval-mail-renewable-energy-mini-grids-and-distributed-\npower-generation-program-india-i-0 \n9  Gender Action Plan  \n10 ADB. 2003.

Simpa was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n20.  The proposed loan will not count toward the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle-project  exposure  limits  for  nonsovereign  investments,  as  it  will  be  funded  by  CTF \nresources, not ADB ordinary capital resources. \n \nD.  Assurances \n21.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter), 12  ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the \nGovernment of India has no objection to the proposed assistance to Simpa. ADB will enter into \nsuitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval \nof the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n22.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the administration by ADB of a loan of up to $6,000,000 to be provided by the Clean \nTechnology Fund to Simpa Energy India Private Limited for the Off-Grid Prepaid Solar Leasing \nProject in India, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \nStephen Groff \nVice-President \n \n \n5 November 2015 \n \n                                                \n12 ADB. 1966.
