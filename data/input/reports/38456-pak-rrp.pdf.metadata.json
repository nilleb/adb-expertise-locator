This  represents  15%  of  the  total \npower  distribution  sector  investment  plan  for  2008\u20132017  of \n$5.2 billion.  The  MFF  has  a  maximum  utilization  period  of \n10 years,  and  the  periodic  financing  requests  (PFRs)  will  be \nconverted into separate loans. \n \nfinancing \nThe  Government  has  entered \nagreement  (FFA)  with  ADB  for  up  to  $810  million  through \nindividual loans to finance the Investment Program in July 2008.  \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  FFA,  the  Government  has  submitted  the \nfirst  PFR  to  ADB  in  an  amount  of  $242  million  from  ordinary \ncapital  resources  (OCR)  and  in  an  amount  of  $10  million \nequivalent \nfrom  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) resources. The first PFR for these two \nloans  will  be  presented  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  at  the  same \ntime as this paper and the FFA. \n \nPakistan\u2019s  power  sector  faces  difficulties  in  its  efforts  to  support \nthe Government\u2019s strategy of increasing the electricity supply to its \nurban  and  rural  population  and  of  securing  overall  economic \ngrowth.  The  key  problems  are  (i)  lack  of  generation  capacity,  (ii) \ntransmission  and  distribution \nincreasing  constraints \nsystems, (iii) weak financial management and sustainability of the \nsector  entities,  and \ninadequate  corporate  governance \nstructures for the power companies.  \n \nTo  support  development  of  the  power  sector  and  to  encourage \nprivate sector participation, the Government has approved power \nsector  policies,  strategies,  and \n(i)  ensure \nindependent  regulation  of  the  power  sector;  (ii)  complete  the \npower  sector  unbundling  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development \nAuthority \nfour  generation,  one \ntransmission,  and  eight  distribution  companies;  (iii)  begin  the \n\n(WAPDA)  by  establishing \n\nin  special  drawings \n\nroad  maps \n\nframework \n\n(SDR) \n\nrights \n\nthe \n\n(iv) \n\nto \n\nin \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nSector Road Map  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nto \n\nthree  main  outcomes:  (i) sector  reforms \n\npower sector privatization program; and (iv) evaluate and optimize \nthe fuel sources of the power sector to ensure energy security and \nminimize overall tariff requirements.  \n \nImplementation of the Government\u2019s power sector strategy would \nhave \nincrease \nefficiencies  and  effectiveness  and \nto  create  an  enabling \nenvironment for more private sector participation and investment; \n(ii) capacity building in all sector organizations, covering financial \nmanagement,  efficiency  improvement,  the  clean  development \nmechanism, and project management; and (iii) completion of large \ninfrastructure  development  projects  in  generation,  transmission, \nand distribution. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  closely  linked  to  Pakistan\u2019s  power \nsector  strategy  and  is  an  integral  part  of  the  power  distribution \ndevelopment program. The Investment Program will enhance the \nefficiency of the overall power distribution system; and provide an \nadequate  and  reliable  power  supply  to  a  greater  number  of \nindustrial, commercial, and residential customers.  \n \nThis  Investment  Program  focuses  on  power  distribution.  In  order \nto enable the power to be effectively, reliably, and safely delivered \nto existing and new customers, the power distribution companies \n(DISCOs),  in  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power \n(MOWP), have prepared the Power Distribution Sector Road Map, \n2008\u20132017.  Based  on  current  system  demand  and  load  growth \nforecasts  in  each  region,  the  road  map  recommends  short- \n(priority),  medium-,  and  long-term  system  improvement  projects \nand details the investment needs.  \n \nThe  objective  of  the  road  map  is  to  show  how  the  eight  DISCOs \ncan  deliver  reliable  and  high-quality  power  supply  to  the  rising \nnumber  of  industrial,  commercial,  agricultural,  and  domestic \ncustomers. \nthe  Government\u2019s  poverty \nreduction strategy and has the following intended outcomes: (i) a \nmore efficient power system; (ii) high-quality power supply through \na  more  reliable  and  stable  system;  (iii)  greater  geographic \ncoverage; and (iv) greater availability of and access to affordable \nelectricity, by relieving the power distribution constraints. \n \nThe  eight  DISCOs  were  established  as  part  of  Pakistan\u2019s  power \nsector unbundling in 1999. Among them, they cover the whole of \nPakistan, except areas serviced by the Karachi Electricity Supply \nCompany,  tribal  areas,  and  the  Northern  Areas.  Each  DISCO  is \nrequired  by  incorporation  and  by  regulatory  requirements  to \n(i) maintain  and  upgrade  its  current  system;  (ii) plan,  design,  and \nimplement  system  expansion;  and  (iii) operate \nthe  system \naccording to operational needs and distribution license conditions \nto ensure effective, reliable, and safe distribution of electricity from \nthe  supply  points  to  customers\u2019  premises  across  its  licensed \nterritory. \n\nis  consistent  with \n\nIt \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n \nThe  total  investment  requirement  for  the  DISCOs  from  2008  to \n2017  is  estimated  at  $5.2  billion.  The  investments  consist  of \nimprovements \n(STG), \nloss  reduction  (ELR), \ndistribution  of  power  (DOP),  energy \ncapacitors,  and  miscellaneous  investments  to  the  distribution \nsystem.  \n \n\ntransmission  grid \n\nthe  secondary \n\nto \n\nDistribution Companies\u2019 Investment Plan Summary \n($ million) \nSubprojects (OCR) \n\nSource \n\n \nADB \nOther Financiers \nDISCOs \n    Total \n\nAmount \n   800 \n2,400 \n2,043 \n5,243 \n\nShare (%) \n 15 \n 46 \n 39 \n100 \n\nProgram Support (ADF) \nShare (%) \nAmount \n 80 \n10.0 \n   0 \n  0.0 \n 20 \n  2.5 \n       100 \n12.5 \n\n    ADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund,  \n    DISCO = distribution company, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \n    Sources: Asian Development Bank and DISCO estimates. \n \nThe immediate priority for investment in the distribution systems is \nto  address  the  capacity  shortfalls  that  currently  result  in  regular \nsystem  outages  and  supply  interruptions  to  customers.  These \nworks  need  to  be  done  urgently  to  avoid  rapid  deterioration  of \npower  transformers  which  could  result  in  prolonged  outages  and \nload shedding.  \n \nthese \nTranche-1  under \nidentified  priorities  and \ninclude  (i)  addition  of  circuit  and \ntransformer capacity to enable the already overloaded systems to \ndeliver  present  demand  reliably  and  meet  the  expected  load \ngrowth,  (ii)  loss  reduction,  and  (iii)  refurbishment  of  distribution \nnetworks.  Benefits  to  be  delivered  from  the  subprojects  in \nTranche-1  include  addition  of  about  2,200  megavolt-amperes \n(MVA)  of  transformer  capacity,  improved  security  of  supply  to \ncustomers  by  moving  toward  compliance  with  regulatory  security \nstandards  governing  planning  and  operation  of  the  distribution \nsystem, and reliability improvements on the lower voltages. \n\nInvestment  Program  will  cover \n\nthe \n\n \nTranche-1 Financing Plan Summary \n($ million) \n\nSource \n\nAmount \n\nPercentage \n\n242 \n  10 \n  75 \n327 \n\nAsian Development Bank (OCR) \nAsian Development Bank (ADF) \nDISCOs \n    Total \nADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund,  DISCO  =  distribution  company,  OCR  = \nordinary capital resources. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and DISCO estimates. \n \nThe  power  sector  entities,  specifically  the  DISCOs,  lack  the \nrequired  level  and  mix  of  skills  or  support  systems  necessary  to \noperate  as  independent  entities  covering  the  whole  range  of \nelectricity  business  requirements.

The  total  cost  of  the  Investment  Program\u2019s \nsupport component is estimated at $10 million for the duration of \nthe  Investment  Program.  The  objective  of  the  component  is  to \nprovide  both  resources  and  capacity  to  enable  the  DISCOs  to \nimprove  and  expand \ntheir  current  project  preparation, \nimplementation, and monitoring capabilities. Support activities will \nbe  developed  to  cover  (i)  general  power  distribution  business \nmanagement  including  project  implementation,  portfolio  review, \nproject  management,  and  program  management;  (ii) technical \nfinancial  and \noperation  and  maintenance; \neconomic  management,  and  financial  reporting;  (iv)  contracting, \nprocurement,  and  inventory  management;  (v)  a  management \ninformation  system  and  economics  of  cost  recovery  and  tariff \nincluding  policy \nsetting;  and \ndevelopment,  a  feasibility  study,  site  identification,  and  project \ndesign. \n \nThe Government has completed the legal unbundling of the power \nsector.  The  regulator,  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory \nAuthority  (NEPRA),  determined  distribution  tariffs  for  each  of  the \neight  DISCOs  in  2007.  Timely  submissions  of  tariff  applications \nwill be ensured and DISCOs\u2019 financial and operational autonomy \nsafeguarded.  During  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program, \nfurther  improvements  and  refinements  will  be  encouraged,  and \nmeasures  will  be  put  in  place  to  ensure  further  progress  toward \noperational and financial autonomy.  \n \nPower  is  an  essential  commodity  for  the  economic  and  social \ndevelopment  of  Pakistan.  Supply  of  reliable  electricity  to  all \ncustomers  throughout  the  country  raises  living  standards  and \nstimulates  commercial  and  industrial  growth.  Historically,  power \ngeneration  and  transmission  subsectors  have  received  more \nattention than distribution. Inadequate distribution of electricity has \nbecome a bottleneck, inhibiting economic growth and affecting all \ncustomers.  The  Investment  Program  will  address  this  bottleneck \nand  improve  future  performance,  as  well  as  increasing  efficiency \nand effectiveness through technical and other improvements.  \n \nPakistan\u2019s  power  sector  is  experiencing  severe  shortfalls  in \nmeeting the country\u2019s current electricity demand. The Government \nis implementing a series of the integrated activities in line with the \npower  sector  development  strategy  set  in  the  Medium Term \nDevelopment  Framework,  2005\u20132010  (MTDF)  in  May  2005.  The \nMTDF  envisages  additional  power  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution  capacities  to  ensure  sufficient  electricity  supply  to \nmeet  the  projected  8%  per  annum  growth  in  demand  over  the \nplanning  period.  The  growth  in  demand  was  about  16%  in \nFY2007.  \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nto  grow \n\nis  expected \n\n \nPower  generation \nfrom  about \n19,540 megawatts (MW) in 2005 to 162,590 MW in 2030. ADB is \nactively  working  with \nthe  Government  and  private  power \ngeneration  developers  to  finance  public-  and  privately-owned \ngeneration  stations  to  meet  the  current  and  future  demand  for \nelectricity.  In  addition,  there  are  bottlenecks  in  the  power \ntransmission  subsector.  To \nfacilitate  efficient  and  effective \nevacuation  of  power  from  existing  and  new  power  stations,  the \nGovernment is implementing multiple activities in accordance with \nits Power Transmission Sector Road Map, 2007\u20132016. In 2006, at \nthe  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  agreed  to  a  long-term \nfinancing  arrangement  to  rehabilitate,  augment,  and  expand  the \npower transmission system; and allow power evacuation from the \nplanned power stations in the least-cost power generation plan.  \n \nEven with increased generation and improved transmission, there \nwill  be  power  shortages  caused  by  distribution  constraints.  The \ndistribution  system  suffers  from  high  technical  and  commercial \nlosses,  outdated  design,  and  poor  performance.  It  is  heavily \nloaded and in parts already overloaded, with high losses and poor \nreliability  levels.  Power  shortages  and  customer  disconnections \nare becoming much more regular and will worsen unless all power \ndistribution  elements  are  significantly  improved  urgently.  There \nremain significant investment requirements in the eight DISCOs to \nimprove reliability and reduce losses alongside system extensions \nto  unserved  areas.  In  addition,  the  DISCOs  need  to  observe  the \nregulatory requirements, and environmental and social safeguard \nstandards. \n \nThis  Investment  Program  will  (i)  improve  power  distribution \ninfrastructure  through  system  rehabilitation,  augmentation,  and \nexpansion;  and  relieve  the  power  system  from  distribution \nbottlenecks  and  constraints;  (ii)  enable  continued  operation  and \nmaintenance in accordance with best international practices; and \n(iii) commercialize DISCO operations. Specifically, (i) DISCOs will \nadhere  to  regulatory  requirements  and  comply  with  the  security \nstandards;  (ii)  about  12,000  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of  additional \nenergy will be supplied through the national grid annually; (iii) the \nsystem  will  be  capable  of  meeting  peak  demand,  with  electricity \noutages significantly reduced; and (iv) 30 million additional people \nwill have access to electricity from the national grid. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  provide  grid-connected \ncustomers  with  adequate  and  reliable  supply  of  electricity,  which \nwill  support  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  8%  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  growth  per  annum.  Substantial  investments  in \nrehabilitation,  augmentation,  and  expansion  of  the  eight  power \ndistribution  systems  will  increase  the  reliability  of  supply  to \nresidential,  agricultural,  commercial,  and  industrial  customers  in \nPakistan.  A  secure  and  predictable  electricity  supply  will  lead  to \nsocial and economic benefits and improve conditions for schools, \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nInvestment Program \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nMultitranche Financing \nFacility Amount and \nTerms \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nDisbursement \n\nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nAdvance Contracting \nand Retroactive \nFinancing \n \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nhospitals, and other social services. \n \nThe  maximum  financing  amount  available  under  the  MFF  is \n$810,000,000.

The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR POLICY, STRATEGY, AND PERFORMANCE \n\nA. \n\nStrategic Context \n\n2. \nPakistan\u2019s  power  sector  faces  tremendous  challenges  in  its  efforts  to  support  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan\u2019s  strategy  of  increasing  the  electricity  supply  to  its  urban  and  rural \npopulation  and  of  securing  overall  economic  growth.  The  key  challenges  are  (i)  lack  of \ngeneration  capacity,  (ii)  increasing  constraints  in  the  transmission  and  distribution  systems, \n(iii) weak  financial  management  and  sustainability  of  the  sector  entities,  and  (iv)  inadequate \ncorporate governance structures for the power companies. A detailed assessment of the power \nsector is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n3. \nTo  support  development  of  the  power  sector  and  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation, the Government has approved power sector policies, strategies, and action plans \nto  (i)  ensure  independent  regulation  of  the  power  sector;  (ii)  complete  the  power  sector \nunbundling  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  by  establishing  four \ngeneration,  one  transmission,  and  eight  distribution  companies;  (iii)  begin  the  power  sector \nprivatization  program;  and  (iv) evaluate  and  optimize  the  fuel  sources  of  the  power  sector  to \nensure energy security and minimize overall tariff requirements.  \n \n4. \nImplementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  power  sector  strategy  would  have  three  main \noutcomes: (i) sector reforms to increase efficiencies and effectiveness and to create an enabling \nenvironment  for  more  private  sector  participation  and  investment,  (ii)  capacity  building  in  all \nsector  organizations,  covering  financial  management,  efficiency  improvement,  the  clean \ndevelopment  mechanism,  and  project  management;  and  (iii) completion  of  large  infrastructure \ndevelopment projects in generation, transmission, and distribution. \n \n\n1. \n\nPower Sector Policy Framework \n\nIn  2000,  the  Government  unveiled  the  \u201cVision  2025\u201d  program  and  in  2006  the  \u201cVision \n5. \n2030\u201d, both stressing accelerated development of new generation facilities, with greater reliance \nplaced  on  indigenous  fuel  sources\u2014hydropower,  thermal  generation  using  local  coal  reserves \nor  local  gas  supplies,  and  renewable  technologies.  The  2002\u20132004  power  policy  includes  an \nincrease  in  power  generation  capacity  and  encompasses  private,  public,  and  private-public \nmodels.  The  policy  continues  the  underlying  theme  of  Vision  2030  by  encouraging  the  use  of \nindigenous  resources,  principally  hydroelectric  power  and  coal.  A  number  of  thermal  and \nhydroelectric projects are currently being processed under the policy. \n \n6. \nThe  power  sector  restructuring  and  reform  process,  developed  in  various  stages  and \nthrough  different  initiatives,  is  reflected  today  in  various  policies,  such  as  the  Power  Policy, \n1994;  Hydel  Policy,  1995;  Transmission  Line  Policy,  1995;  Power  Policy,  1998;  and  Power \nPolicy,  2002.  These  were  largely  designed  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in  a  newly \nrestructured  power  sector.  This  characterization,  at  least  in  terms  of  outright  government \ncontrol, has changed over the last decade, and Pakistan today enjoys significant private sector-\n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nled  generation  through  21 independent  power  producers  (IPPs),  19  of  which  were  sanctioned \nunder the Power Policy 1994, and which together represent in excess of 30% of total generation \ncapacity. \n \n\n2. \n\nPower Sector Strategy \n\n7. \nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  the  power  sector  has  three  main  intended  outcomes: \n(i) sector  reforms  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  participation;  (ii) more \ncapacity  development  in  all  sector  organizations,  including  financial  management,  efficiency \nimprovement,  use  of  the  clean  development  mechanism,  and  project  management;  and \n(iii) completion  of  large  infrastructure  development  projects  in  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution. \n \n8. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Framework,  2005\u20132010  (MTDF) \nenvisages an ambitious investment program for the power sector in order to achieve consistent \n8% annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP). The power sector will need to increase its \ncapacity to support this growth target and to meet the demand for and consumption of electricity \nimplied  by  such  growth.  In  addition,  about  34%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  population  has  no  access  to \nelectricity  from  the  national  grid  and  the  Government  is  implementing  an  ambitious  plan  to \nextend coverage significantly in rural areas. The lack of generation capacity is being addressed \nthrough  increased  power  generation  projects  that  apply  public-private  partnership  models. \nConstraints in the power transmission network that were expected to result in significant system \ncapacity shortfalls and to restrict GDP growth by almost 0.8% in FY2008, are being addressed \nunder a targeted Asian Development Bank (ADB) MFF.1 \n \n9. \nThe  MTDF  contains  a  medium-  and  long-term  integrated  national  energy  security  plan \nfor the country. The objectives of the MTDF are to (i) increase power generation; (ii) enhance \nthe exploitation and production of oil, gas, and coal resources and to increase the share of coal \nand alternative energy in the energy mix; (iii) optimize the use of indigenous sources and reduce \ndependence on imported sources; and (iv) encourage and facilitate private sector involvement.  \n \n10. \nThe  MTDF  also  sets  out  an  investment  strategy  for  the  power  transmission  and \ndistribution  sectors.  It  recognizes  that  the  existing  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure \nand  grid  stations  are  overloaded,  that  they  need  to  be  strengthened,  and  new  generation \nprojects  be  commissioned  and  connected  to  the  national  grid.  The  MTDF  also  addresses  the \nproblems  of  the  distribution  network,  including  overloaded  substations  and  high  distribution \nlosses,  and  recommends  that  the  network  be  expanded  and  efficiency  improved.  The  MTDF \nmakes other recommendations, among them to (i) ensure independent regulation of the power \nsector,  (ii)  unbundle  WAPDA  and  establish  and  fully  operationalize  the  successor  companies, \nand  (iii)  strengthen  the  privatization  program.  The  MTDF  also  specifies  the  need  to  further \nstrengthen the regulatory role of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).  \n \n11. \nAlthough the energy sector parameters are spelled out in the MTDF, currently there is a \nlack  of  integrated  energy  planning  to  analyze/plan  a  consolidated  action  plan  to  address \ncountry\u2019s  energy  needs  in  the  short,  medium,  and  long  terms.  To  achieve  the  objectives  of \nadequacy and security of energy supplies as well as ensuring long-term viability of the sector, \nthe  Government  aims  to  adopt  an  approach  based  on  implementation  of  integrated  energy \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2006.

The Government would focus on the following \nareas: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nindigenous  energy  resources \n\nPolicies and plans in place target further development of indigenous conventional \nenergy  resources  (including  oil  and  gas,  hydro,  and  coal)  by  providing \nappropriate incentives and a level playing field to the private sector.  \nPlans  for  meeting  the  energy  needs  of  rural  areas  give  special  emphasis  to \nexploitation of renewable energy potential, taking into account the economic cost \nof  delivering  energy  from  alternative  sources  and  benefits  associated  with \ndecentralized resource development.  \nLong-term  strategies  focus  on  meeting  the  energy  deficits  by  establishment  of \nenergy trade corridors to capitalize on the proximity of Pakistan to resource rich \ncountries  in  the  Middle  East  and  Central  Asia.  An  action  framework  comprising \nimport  of  energy  through  implementation  of  gas  pipeline  projects,  liquefied \nnatural  gas  projects,  and  projects  for  import  of  electricity  from  Central  Asia  are \nbeing formulated on a fast-track basis. \nDevelopment  of \nthrough \nenhanced oil and gas production, detailed technical and economic assessment of \ncoal  mining  and  coal  based-power  generation,  increased  hydroelectric  power \ngeneration,  and  mainstreaming  renewable  energy.  Finally,  energy  efficiency \nmeasures  are  being  implemented  through  optimizing  the  energy  mix,  improving \nexisting  transmission  and  distribution  infrastructure,  and  managing  demand  in \nindustrial and domestic sectors. \nUtilization  of  recent  financial  and  technical  modalities  (such  as  the  clean \ndevelopment mechanism and clean energy) would enhance Pakistan\u2019s ability to \ndiversify its energy security, and ensure that benefits from these initiatives would \noptimize energy utilization and financing capabilities.  \nThe  Government  is  implementing  an  ambitious  privatization  agenda  and  a \nnumber  of  energy  sector  entities  are  up  for  privatization  through  initial  public \noffering, outright sales, and management buyouts. These include stakes in the oil \nmarketing  company,  gas  transmission  and  distribution  companies,  power \ngeneration and distribution companies, and petroleum exploration and production \ncompanies. \n\nis  being  pursued \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPower Sector Road Map \n\n12. \nThe power sector is central to the current and future prosperity of Pakistan through the \nsupply of low-cost electricity to domestic customers throughout the country2 and by virtue of its \ncapacity to stimulate commercial and industrial development. The key challenges of the power \nsector  are  (i)  lack  of  generation  capacity,  (ii)  increasing  constraints  in  the  transmission  and \ndistribution  systems,  (iii) weak  financial  management  and  sustainability  of  the  sector  entities, \nand (iv) inadequate corporate governance structures for the power companies. \n \nThe availability of power remains insufficient to meet peak system demand or to provide \n13. \nan adequate level of spinning reserve.3 The current installed generation capacity in Pakistan is \n19,550  megawatts  (MW),  of  which  17,395  MW  is  in  the  regions  formerly  covered  by  WAPDA. \n\n                                                 \n2  The Government is currently implementing an ambitious program to electrify all villages.  \n3  The sum of the unutilized net generating capability of all units of the electric utility company that are synchronized \n\nto the power distribution system and that are capable of immediately accepting additional load. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fHowever,  the  available  generation  capacity  in  the  WAPDA  regions  is  only  about  13,000  MW \nbecause (i) hydropower plants are dependent on reservoir capacity and hence are affected by \nrainfall, reservoir silting, and irrigation; (ii) the generation portfolio is aging and subject to rating \nlimitations  and  increased  maintenance  requirements;  and  (iii)  the  plants  are  increasingly \nunreliable.  Additional  generating  capacity  is  being  planned  through  the  thermal  and  hydro \ngeneration  section  of  WAPDA,  and  the  Private  Power  Investment  Board  by  encouraging  and \ngranting  licenses  for  private  sector  investment  in  IPPs.  According  to  the  Government\u2019s  power \nsystem estimates, around 8% annual growth in electricity demand in Pakistan is forecast during \n2005\u20132015.  Pakistan  will  require  an  additional  2,000  MW  of  power  annually  to  meet  this \ndemand and this additional power will need to be evacuated through the transmission systems \nand delivered through the distribution systems of the eight distribution companies (DISCOs). \n   \nBased  on  the  MTDF,  the  Government  developed  a  long-term  power  generation  plan. \n14. \nThis identified the demand for increased generation capacity, and addressed the size and timing \nof  the  commissioning  of  the  new  plants.  The  overall  power  transmission  strategy  is  to  ensure \nthat the electricity from the new power generation plants is evacuated to the load centers.  \n \n15. \nThe  effective  evacuation  of  power  from  all  of  the  existing  generating  stations,  and \nconnection of the stations to be commissioned in future, is vested in the National Transmission \nand  Despatch  Company  (NTDC),  which  in  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power \n(MOWP)  prepared  the  power  transmission  sector  road  map  and  corresponding  investment \nplans. In 2006, at the request of the Government, ADB agreed to long-term financing support of \nthe  power  transmission  subsector  through  an  MFF  to  NTDC  to  realize  the  investment  needs. \nThe  power  transmission  investment  subprojects  are  currently  under  implementation.  These \ndevelopments together address the generation and primary transmission of electric power to the \neight geographically split power DISCOs. \n \n\n4. \n\nPower Distribution Sector Road Map  \n\n16. \nDISCOs  receive  electric  power  from  NTDC  in  their  respective  geographic  areas  and \nhave inherited the distribution assets at operating voltages of 132 kilovolts (kV) and below. With \nthis  goes  the  obligation  to  distribute  electricity  and  make  supplies  available  within  their \ngeographic boundaries under rules, service conditions, and tariffs laid down by NEPRA.  \n \n17. \nDISCOs face several challenges, as their power distribution systems (i) do not provide \ncomplete  geographic  coverage,  (ii)  have  a  shortage  of  capacity  in  areas  they  do  cover,  and \n(iii) suffer from the consequences of years of inadequate maintenance and underinvestment. \n \n18. \nHigh  growth  in  electricity  demand  in  Pakistan  is  putting  the  existing  power  distribution \ninfrastructure  under  severe  stress  and  there  is  a  clear  need  for  investment.  Substantial \ninvestments  in  rehabilitation,  augmentation,  and  expansion  of  the  eight  power  distribution \nsystems  will  increase  the  reliability  of  supply  to  residential,  agricultural,  commercial,  and \nindustrial  customers  in  Pakistan.  A  secure  and  predictable  electricity  supply  will  lead  to  social \nand economic benefits and improve conditions for schools, hospitals, and other social services. \nThis power distribution sector development road map is a comprehensive plan that specifies the \ndetails  of  system  renovation  and  expansion  to  provide  all  grid-connected  customers  with \nadequate and reliable supply of electricity, which will support the Government\u2019s objective of 8% \nGDP growth per annum.  \n \n19. \nThe  objective  of  the  road  map  is  to  show  how  the  eight  DISCOs  can  deliver  a  reliable \nand  high-quality  power  supply  to  the  rising  number  of  industrial,  commercial,  agricultural,  and \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fdomestic customers. It is consistent with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and has \nthe following intended outcomes: (i) a more efficient power system; (ii) high-quality power supply \nthrough  a  more  reliable  and  stable  system;  (iii) greater  geographic  coverage;  and  (iv)  greater \navailability of and access to affordable electricity, by relieving the power distribution constraints. \nThe Power Distribution Sector Road Map, 2008\u20132017, is in Appendix 2. \n  \n\n5. \n\nPower Distribution Sector Investment Plan  \n\nTo support the power distribution sector expansion, the Government prepared the Power \n20. \nDistribution Sector Road Map, 2008\u20132017, and approved the corresponding Investment Plan for \nDISCOs  (Appendix  3).  The  total  investment  requirement  for  the  DISCOs  for  2008\u20132017  is \nestimated  at  $5.2  billion.  The  investments  consist  of  improvements  to  the  secondary \ntransmission grid (STG), distribution of power (DOP), energy loss reduction (ELR), capacitors, \nand  other  required  investments  to  the  distribution  system.  These  investments  have  been \nsummarized in Table 1. \n \n\nTable 1: Distribution Companies\u2019 Total Investment Requirement by Year \n($ million) \n\nFiscal Year \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \nTotal \n\nAmount \n 262 \n 315 \n 367 \n 472 \n 577 \n 682 \n 786 \n 891 \n 577 \n 315 \n             5,243 \n\n \n\n \n\n                       Sources: Distribution companies\u2019 5-year plans and consultant estimates. \n\n \n21. \nThe  distribution  systems  are  heavily  loaded  and  in  parts  already  overloaded,  with  high \nlosses and poor reliability levels. If recent increases in demand continue, power shortages and \nthe already frequent customer disconnections or load shedding will become much more regular \nunless  all  elements  of  the  power  sector  are  significantly  improved  urgently.  Significant \ninvestment requirements remain on the distribution systems of the eight DISCOs to enable the \npower to be effectively, reliably, and safely delivered to satisfy the demands of existing and new \ncustomers, observing the necessary environmental and social safeguard requirements. There is \nalso  the  need  to  address  compliance  with  regulatory  requirements.  To  date,  these  have  not \nbeen  priority  issues  for  the  DISCOs\u2014they  are  generally  aware  of  the  regulatory  requirements \nbut will not be able to achieve compliance at this stage (e.g., (n-1) criterion).4  \n \nThe  immediate  priority  for  investment  in  the  distribution  systems  is  to  address  the \n22. \ncapacity  shortfalls  that  currently  result  in  regular  system  outages  and  supply  interruptions  to \ncustomers.  There  is  a  degree  of  urgency  on  this  work  to  avoid  rapid  deterioration  of  power \ntransformers  caused  by  overloading,  which  can  result  in  failures  with  lengthy  return  to  service \n                                                 \n4   (n-1)  criterion  expresses  the  ability  of  the  power  transmission  and  distribution  system  to  lose  a  linkage  without \ncausing an overload failure elsewhere. DISCOs in Pakistan are required to meet this criterion in accordance with \nthe grid code.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\ftimes. The identified priorities begin with the addition of circuit and transformer capacity at the \nsub-transmission  level  to  enable  the  already  overloaded  systems  to  deliver  present  demand \nreliably and meet the expected load growth.  \n \nA  second  priority  is  loss  reduction.  The  primary  and  secondary  distribution  system \n23. \nsuffers  from  high  technical  and  commercial  losses,  outdated  design,  and  poor  performance. \nImprovements  to  system  reliability  and  further  downstream  loss  reduction  are  required  on  the \nlower voltage systems of all DISCOs alongside system extensions to unserved villages. \n \n24. \nThe  power  sector  entities,  specifically  the  DISCOs,  do  not  have  the  required  level  and \nmix  of  skills  or  support  systems  necessary  to  operate  as  independent  entities  covering  the \nwhole  range  of  electricity  business  requirements.  Improvements  to  corporate  governance  and \nsupport systems are required.  \n \n\n6. \n\nADB Strategy \n\nIn the short and medium term, ADB will prioritize assistance for economic infrastructure \n25. \nprojects  that  address  critical  gaps  and  constraints  in  the  overstressed  transmission  and \ndistribution  systems  and  that  rehabilitate  and  modernize  the  power  infrastructure.  However, \ninvestment in additional generation is only justifiable if the transmission and distribution system \ncan  handle  the  additional  load.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  energy  sector  also  prioritizes  power \nsector reform, energy efficiency and renewable energy development.  \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  recommends  careful  prioritization  of  new  public  sector \ninvestments, with an emphasis on creating a favorable environment for privatization and private \nsector  involvement.  Priority  areas  include  (i)  increasing  energy  efficiency  (both  supply  and \ndemand);  (ii)  optimizing  hydropower  and  support  for  public-private  partnerships  in  hydropower \ngeneration;  (iii)  balanced  energy  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;  and  (iv)  sector \nrestructuring, rationalization of tariffs, and greater private sector participation.  \n \nB. \n\nPower Distribution Sector Overview \n\n1. \n\nThe Power Distribution Companies \n\n27. \nIn Pakistan, for the uninitiated power it is evacuated from generation plants first via the \ntransmission  system  (kV)  then  via  the  distribution  system  to  the  consumer.  The  power \ndistribution system is defined to cover any lines and substations at 132 kV and lower voltages. \nMore  specifically,  the  system  contains  (i)  overhead  lines  at  voltages  of  132  kV,  66  kV,  33  kV, \nand 11 kV, as well as an extensive low voltage network; and (ii) substations for stated voltage \nlevels.  The  system  serves  a  nationwide  customer  base,  but  access  to  grid  connections  is \ncurrently at 66%, resulting in a relatively large requirement for rural electrification.  \n \n28. \nUnder  a  business  transfer  agreement  implemented  on  1  March  1999,  the  distribution \nsystem  assets  previously  owned  by  WAPDA  were  vested  in  eight  newly  incorporated \ngeographically based DISCOs. Each company took over properties, rights, assets, obligations, \nand  liabilities  of  the  distribution  system  within  its  geographic  area.  The  eight  DISCOs  are \nobliged to provide a connection to their distribution systems to all eligible customers as defined \nby  NEPRA,  and  included  in  license  conditions.  The  DISCOs  further  have  the  obligation  to \nmaintain  the  distribution  system  to  enable  the  effective,  efficient,  and  safe  distribution  of \nelectricity  to  customers.  The  obligations  upon  the  DISCOs  are  set  out  in  the  individual \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fdistribution license held by each company, and reinforced by generally applicable requirements \nof the national grid and distribution codes and customer service standards. \n \n29. \nThe  eight  DISCOs  among  them  cover  the  whole  of  Pakistan,  except  Karachi,  tribal \nareas, and the Northern Areas, each taking its power requirements primarily from NTDC. Each \nDISCO is required by incorporation and by regulatory requirements to (i) maintain and upgrade \nits  current  system;  (ii)  plan,  design,  and  implement  system  expansion;  and  (iii) operate  the \nsystem  according  to  operational  needs  and  distribution  license  conditions  to  ensure  the \neffective,  reliable,  and  safe  distribution  of  electricity  from  the  supply  points  to  customers\u2019 \npremises across its licensed territory. \n \n30. \nIn  terms  of  human  resources,  the  transition  of  staff  from  WAPDA  to  the  DISCOs  has \nbeen  completed.  The  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  has  also  been  substantially  completed. \nIndependent  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  and  audited,  in  compliance  with \ndistribution  license  requirements,  for  independent  DISCO  operations  from  FY2004  to  FY2006. \nHowever,  the  financial  independence  of  the  DISCOs  has  yet  to  reach  the  level  required  of  an \nautonomous corporation.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDISCOs\u2019 Performance \n\nThe  distribution  systems  are  old  and  in  many  cases  not  built  for  the  capacity  now \n31. \ndemanded.  It  is  known  that  many  transformers  are  heavily  loaded  or  overloaded.  Lack  of \nmaintenance  of  the  distribution  systems  has  resulted  in  ongoing  deterioration  of  system \ncomponents  and  increased  losses.  The  performance  of  the  distribution  companies  does  not \ncurrently comply with the distribution license conditions, in the areas of service standards or the \ntechnical  codes  produced  by  NEPRA.  Currently,  these  standards  are  not  actively  enforced  by \nNEPRA.  \n \nTotal DISCOs\u2019 system losses averaged 20% in 2006. The range across the DISCOs is \n32. \nfrom 39% in the worst case to 10% in the best case. In the distribution system, high losses are \ncaused by the excess load on the transformers and lines, exacerbated by the poor power factor5 \nof the load. Even the highest performing DISCO has scope to address the current situation, and \none  of  the  stated  objectives  of  this  investment  facility  from  all  DISCOs  is  to  address  system \nlosses. The  overall  distribution  system  losses  are  a  combination  of  technical  and  nontechnical \nlosses. The total distribution losses as of 30 June 2006 are shown in Table 2. These losses are \ncalculated  based  on  the  difference  between  electricity  purchase  and  electricity  sale  (both  in \ngigawatt-hours [GWh]).  \n \n\n                                                 \n5 Power  factor  describes  the  relationship  between  real  and  apparent  power  of  alternating  current  (AC)  power \nsystems. In an AC power system, current may flow into and back out of a load without delivering any energy. This \nreactive  current  gives  rise  to  \u201capparent  power\u201d  which  is  larger  than  the  actual  power  consumed.  Power  factor  is \nexpressed as the ratio of the actual power to the apparent power. All current  will cause losses in the supply and \ndistribution system. A load with a power factor of 1.0 results in the most efficient loading of the supply and a load \nwith a power factor of 0.5  will result in much higher losses in the supply system. A poor power factor can be the \nresult of either a significant phase difference between the voltage and current at the load terminals, or it can be due \nto a high harmonic content or distorted/discontinuous current waveform. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nTable 2: Distribution Companies\u2019 Losses \n(GWh) \n \n\n  8,459 \n12,660 \n33.18% \n\n  9,571 \n11,767 \n18.70% \n\nIESCO \n7,065 \n8,044 \n12.20% \n\nItem  \nElectricity Sales  \nElectricity Purchased  \nDistribution Losses \n\nLESCO  MEPCO  PESCO  QESCO \nFESCO  GEPCO  HESCO \n3,965 \n13,947 \n4,843 \n6,110 \n8,600 \n5,043 \n15,977 \n7,681 \n6,915 \n9,714 \n21.40% \n12.70% \n36.99% \n11.64% \n11.50% \nFESCO  =  Faisalabad  Electric  Supply  Company,  GEPCO  =  Gujranwala  Electric  Power  Company,  GWh  =  gigawatt-\nhour,  HESCO  =  Hyderabad  Electric  Supply  Company,  IESCO  =  Islamabad  Electric  Supply  Company,  LESCO  = \nLahore Electric Supply Company, MEPCO = Multan Electric Power Company, PESCO  = Peshawar Electric Supply \nCompany, QESCO = Quetta Electric Supply Company. \nSource: Distribution companies\u2019 estimates. \n \nOn nontechnical losses,6 the target has to be elimination over a period of time. However, \n33. \nthe economic situation in the country determines that there is a high probability of nontechnical \nlosses existing for the foreseeable future. \n \n34. \nOn technical losses, the situation is more complex. Direct comparison with international \nbest  practice  may  indicate  that  technical  losses  (indeed  total  losses)  should  be  below  10%  of \nconsumption,  probably  as  low  as  6\u20137%.  In  Pakistan  and  other  developing  countries,  the \nsituation is quite different. A number of issues have to be taken into account that will impact on \nthe target technical loss percentage. These include the actual consumption, ratio of high to low \nvoltage network, uneconomic conductor sizes, overall length of network, poor power, and load \nfactors.  \n \nThe  reliability  of  the  distribution  networks  is  also  a  cause  for  concern\u2014customer \n35. \ninterruptions  and  customer  downtime  while  the  fault  is  being  fixed  are  well  beyond  an \nacceptable  level.  Even  after  allowing  for  the  fact  that  the  power  sector  is  still  developing, \nsignificant  improvements  are  required  even  to  approach  the  industry  benchmarks  of  customer \ninterruptions and customer minutes lost.  \n \n36. \nThe DISCOs are not meeting regulatory requirements for the (n-1) reliability criterion on \ntheir  higher  voltage  networks,  resulting  in  interruptions  that  would  be  unacceptable  in  strict \nregulatory regimes. However, the investment required to achieve this level of redundancy is not \ngenerally considered by the DISCOs to be within their financially sustainable capabilities. Other \nregulatory  standards  relating  to  supply  failures  and  customer  service  standards  are  not  being \ncomplied  with,  such  as  (i)  new  customer  connection  periods,  (ii)  maximum  interruption  per \nannum, and (iii) return to service following interruption.  \n \n37. \nThe  total  income  of  each  DISCO  is  regulated  by  NEPRA  through  tariff  determination \nfrom  time  to  time.  Within  the  determination,  NEPRA  considers  the  required  operating  costs  of \nthe  DISCO  including  (i)  the  requirement  to  service  debt  for  longer-term  investment  in  the \ndistribution  system,  and  (ii)  replacement  of  time-expired  assets  with  a  return  on  investment  in \naddition to the pass-through costs of the energy supplied. \n \nNEPRA  issued  separate  tariff  determinations  for  each  DISCO  in  February  2007.  All \n38. \nDISCOs consider these determinations inadequate for their needs and contend that they would \nnot  allow  them  to  comply  with  regulatory  requirements.  Appeals  were  made  in  each  case. \nNEPRA determined that an additional tariff of about 10% was required. \n \n                                                 \n6  Nontechnical (commercial) losses = total losses \u2013 technical losses. It includes metering errors, illegal connections, \n\nnon-billing, etc.  \n\n \n\n\fA further financial issue for the DISCOs is that the tariff approved by NEPRA is not the \n39. \nselling price they have been allowed to charge their customers. This is set by the Government \nat a rate lower than the NEPRA-determined tariff. The shortfall between the NEPRA tariff and \nthe price that is billed to the customer is then billed by the DISCO to the Government in the form \nof a subsidy payment. There can be significant delay in payment or failure to pay this subsidy, \neffectively leaving the DISCOs operating at a loss, with severe cash flow constraints.   \n \n40. \nExternal  investment  sources  will  be  required  to  secure  effective  distribution  systems, \nespecially  for  development  of  the  capacity  of  the  sub-transmission  system  and  addressing \nreliability and loss reduction requirements at the lower voltages. System extensions are required \nto work toward the government target of 100% electrification of villages. The original target date \nfor completion was December 2007. The Government is considering to extend the target date. \nSome of the more financially secure DISCOs have already arranged financing from commercial \nsources  and  other  development  agencies  to  commence  their  expansion  and  development \nprograms. Given the current financial arrangements of the remainder, it will be difficult for them \nto attract the large investments necessary from commercial sources, particularly since they do \nnot have full control over their own cash flow from customers.  \n \nC. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities of the Power Distribution Sector \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems \n\n41. \nPakistan\u2019s  power  distribution  sector  faces  three  major  challenges:  (i)  the  system \nreliability  prevents  continuous  supply,  (ii)  high  distribution  losses,  and  (iii)  severe  financial \nshortcomings. The system is unable to meet the current demand, and is already falling behind \npower generation expansion targets. To enable the increased generating capacity to support the \nGovernment\u2019s economic growth targets, the power distribution system (in addition to the power \ntransmission  system)  must  (i)  be  strengthened  to  meet  current  system  requirements  and  fulfill \ndemand, and (ii) keep pace with the increasing customer demand. \n \n42. \nThe  power  distribution  system  is  negatively  impacted  by  aging,  overloading,  and  poor \nmaintenance.  It  is  unreliable,  and  at  times  there  is  load  shedding  and  delivery  of  supplies \noutside statutory voltage limits. The system needs immediate rehabilitation, augmentation, and \nexpansion to meet customer demands and system security requirements. Ensuring the safe and \nreliable distribution of electricity will be a major challenge for Pakistan.  \n \nThe financial weaknesses affecting the power distribution sector are severely impacting \n43. \nthe financial sustainability of DISCOs and the power sector in general. The financial shortfall in \ndistribution  is  the  primary  cause  of  circular  debt  problems  in  Pakistan.  There  is  an  urgency  to \nresolve  the  financial  weaknesses  to  ensure  (i)  elimination  of  the  circular  debt,  (ii)  reduction  in \nthe  requirements  for  subsidies,  and  (iii)  development  of  financially  sustainable  DISCOs. \nFocusing  on  the  future  investment  requirements  of  DISCOs,  it  would  be  difficult  to  secure \nfinancing if the current financial parameters and procedures continue. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Issues \n\n44. \nThe  financial  sustainability  of  the  power  sector  is  dependent  on  timely  and  accurate \n(i) submission  of  tariff  applications  by  the  DISCOs;  (ii)  execution  of  the  tariff  determination  by \nNEPRA; (iii) notification of the tariff determination by the Government; (iv) metering, billing, and \ncollection by the DISCOs; (v) payment of subsidy allocations by the Government; (vi) payment \nfrom  DISCOs  to  the  Central  Power  Purchasing  Agency  (CPPA)  for  electricity  purchased; \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f(vii) payment from DISCOs to NTDC for transmission charges; and (viii) settlement of purchases \nand sale of electricity by CPPA, which has recently been established and is preparing to take up \nthis role.  \n \nThe current regime allows DISCOs to retain only that portion of income that is agreed as \n45. \nnecessary  to  cover  their  routine  operating  costs  (primarily  salaries).  The  remainder  is \ntransferred  to  WAPDA  for  onward  disbursement  to  power  producers  and  NTDC.  The  current \ntariff levels result in shortfall of funds that impact on both the DISCOs and NTDC.  \n \n46. \nThe  Government  has  determined  that  the  single  buyer  function  presently  licensed  to \nNTDC will be handed to an independent agency, CPPA. Tariff determinations made for CPPA, \nand  agreements  with  generation  companies  and  IPPs,  have  been  revised  to  reflect  CPPA  as \nthe single buyer. When CPPA comes into effect, it is expected that the DISCOs will achieve a \nfurther  degree  of  autonomy  by  the  establishment  of  an  escrow  account  for  each  DISCO,  into \nwhich  all  revenues  will  be  paid.  CPPA  will  have  first  call  on  each  escrow  account  to  settle \nenergy purchased accounts, and the balance will be under the control of the DISCO. \n \n47. \nDespite  the  power  purchase  cost  increases,  end  user  electricity  tariffs  have  not  been \nincreased  correspondingly  and  the  DISCOs\u2019  profitability  has  suffered.  During  the  year  ended \n30 June  2006,  only  one  DISCO  (Lahore  Electric  Supply  Company  [LESCO])  recorded  a  small \nprofit.  In  February  2007,  NEPRA  issued  determinations  on  tariff  petitions  submitted  by  the \nDISCOS  in  2005.  The  determinations  allowed  significant  tariff  increases  for  all  DISCOs. \nHowever, all DISCOs appealed against the decisions on the basis that the assumptions used by \nNEPRA in the tariff formula should be adjusted based on current data and plans. Hearings with \nNEPRA were held in May 2007; in each case, NEPRA has reached a determination, but these \nhad not been announced at the time of the Appraisal Mission. \n \n48. \nIn  the  meantime,  the  Government  has  issued  a  tariff  determination  that  sets  out  tariffs \napplicable  from  24  February  2007  payable  by  customers.  The  rates  set  out  are  consistent \nacross all DISCOs. These rates are lower than those originally determined by NEPRA but the \nnotification confirms that the difference between the relevant rates determined by NEPRA and \nthe  rates  charged  from  customers  shall  be  paid  by  the  Government.  The  timely  payment  of \nthese  tariff  subsidies  by  the  Government  is  crucial  for  the  financial  independence  of  the \nDISCOs. The Government budgeted PRs57 billion for power sector subsidies in FY2007. \n \n49. \nThe  tariff  formula  allows  a  pass-through  of  power  costs  (subject  to  an  adjustment  for \nallowed  losses),  recovery  of  operating  and  maintenance  costs  (including  depreciation),  and  a \nreturn  on  investment.  Under  the  formula,  the  DISCOs  have  the  potential  to  earn  reasonable \nprofits in the future provided that realistic and achievable assumptions are adopted by NEPRA. \n \nThe  time  lag  between  raising  customer  tariffs  in  line  with  power  purchase  costs  has \n50. \nmeant that DISCOs have been unable to pay NTDC for the full cost of power purchased and a \nlarge outstanding balance remains due. At the year ended 30 June 2006, the total balance due \nfrom  all  DISCOs  (excluding  Karachi  Electric  Supply  Company  [KESC])  was  PRs128.6  billion. \nThis represents a significant financial burden for the sector, which has yet to be resolved. \n \n51. \nDISCOs  currently  have  satisfactory  accounting  capacities  and  established  accredited \nexternal  audit  processes  in  accordance  with  international  audit  standards.  They  have  also \ndeveloped  sufficient  in-house  functions  and  systems  to  handle  payments,  billings,  and \ncollections.  Accounting  systems  are  well  developed  but  continue  to  rely  on  significant  manual \nprocesses.  Several  DISCOs  are  actively  pursuing  computerization  of  accounting  systems  to \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fimprove control and efficiency in financial management. However, financial management, which \nwould benefit from some external assistance in capacity building, is in need of strengthening in \nsome DISCOs. \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Matters  \n\n52. \nAs  the  unbundling  transition  period  is  coming  to  an  end  and  DISCOs  are  building \ncapacity to enable their independence from WAPDA, the corporate governance structure of their \nboards of directors needs to be in accordance with best international practice. Currently, each \nboard  consists  of  a  chair,  three  members  from  the  private  sector,  and  three  officials \nrepresenting  the  owner,  the  Government.  The  nomination  of  the  board  members  is  made  by \nchair of Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO) in accordance with a presidential directive. \nA  situation  where  the  same  individual  holds  positions  on  several  boards  of  directors  is \ncounterproductive to the Government\u2019s power sector policy and in contradiction with corporate \ngovernance principles. For example, the chair of NTDC and another director concurrently hold \nseats in WAPDA and PEPCO. There is an inherent conflict of interest if a DISCO board member \nalso sits on the board of WAPDA or another company that holds transmission and/or generation \nassets. Such conflicts of interest would make it difficult for individuals to exercise their fiduciary \nduties and carry out their oversight role. \n \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n53. \nThe  Government  is  acutely  aware  of  the  need  for  private  sector  participation  in  the \npower sector. In 2002, it set out a policy for power generation projects that provided a clear set \nof  incentives,  along  with  a  regulatory  regime,  to  attract  private  capital.  Pakistan  has  been \nsuccessful  in  attracting  private  sector  investment  and  is  working  to  improve  the  enabling \nenvironment.7 The 15 commissioned IPPs make up about 4,000 MW of generating capacity.  \n  \nIn  line  with  overall  power  sector  policies,  the  power  distribution  subsector  promotes \n54. \nprivate  sector  economic  activities  by  making  available  power  through  distribution  of  electricity \nfrom the IPPs. A robust distribution system is the anchor for private sector investments in power \ndistribution  companies.  Through  substantial  investments  in  the  distribution  system,  the \nGovernment will be able to establish an environment conducive to private sector investments. At \nthe  same  time,  it  will  remove  concerns  about  the  ability  to  distribute  power  from  IPPs  and \nensure  a  continuous  supply  of  electricity  to  end  customers.  Two  of  the  DISCOs,  namely \nFaisalabad  Electric  Supply  Company  (FESCO)  and  Peshawar  Electric  Supply  Company \n(PESCO),  are  currently  being  prepared  for  privatization  by  the  Privatization  Commission.  The \nprivate  sector  is  showing  strong  interest  in  the  two  companies,  but  is  uncomfortable  with  the \nsurrounding environment, as it negatively impacts the operations and financial performance of \nthe  companies.  Through  this  MFF,  ADB  will  assist  the  Government  to  strengthen  the \nenvironment  for  private  sector  investments  in  the  power  sector,  by  (i)  making  further \nimprovements  to  the  enabling  conditions  for  power  distribution,  and  (ii) providing  financial \nsecurity for the funding of power distribution facilities that would ensure distribution of electricity \nfrom IPPs. \n \n55. \nThe Government is considering additional privatizations in the power distribution sector \nwith  details  to  be  decided  after  FESCO  has  been  privatized.  In  addition  to  privatization,  the \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Program \nCluster  of  Loans  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Private  Participation  in \nInfrastructure Program. Manila. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fprivate  sector  is  envisioned  to  participate  in  the  MFF  in  the  form  of  equipment  suppliers,  civil \nworks  contractors,  and  consultants  in  a  wide  variety  of  areas  covering  technical  design  of \nsubprojects, environmental and social impact assessment, and financial services.  \n \n56. \non the same terms and conditions as the non-privatized DISCOs.  \n \n\nThe Facility would allow any privatized DISCO to continue its participation in the Facility \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n57. \nThe major sources of external assistance to the power sector are ADB, the Government \nof  Japan,  and  the  World  Bank.  Together,  they  provide  more  than  half  of  the  official  external \nassistance.  ADB  has  supported  both  KESC  and  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority \n(WAPDA),  while  the  World  Bank  has  mainly  provided  assistance  to  WAPDA.  Pakistan\u2019s \ndevelopment  partners  have  been  working  together  to  evolve  a  strategy  for  the  privatization  of \nthe  power  sector.  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  Government  have  prepared  a  policy  matrix, \nwith a clear delineation of the division of labor between ADB and the World Bank.  \n\n58. \nBilateral  Support.  The  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  has  supported \nWAPDA to rehabilitate the Warsak Hydroelectric Power Station. It has also provided assistance \nto strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources to develop and \nimplement  sound  policies  and  regulatory  frameworks  to  encourage  private  sector  investment \nand \nto  enforce  effective  conservation  and  environmental  regulations.  The  Canadian \nInternational Development Agency also supports public and private companies to develop and \nmanage  hydrocarbon  resources.  The  Government  of  Germany  is  supporting  a  hydropower \npromotion  program  and  a  grid  station  in  Ghakkar  for  power  transmission  from  Ghazi  Barotha. \nThe Government of Japan is considering assistance for energy efficiency enhancement through \nimprovements to the national grid, the load dispatch system, and area-specific electrification. \n \n\n6. \n\nADB Operations and Sector Strategy   \n\n59. \nADB Operations. Since the start of ADB operations in Pakistan in 1968, total lending to \nthe energy sector in Pakistan amounts to about $4.2 billion, of which $3.6 billion is to the power \nsubsector  and  $0.6  billion  to  the  natural  gas  and  petroleum  subsectors.  During  recent  years, \nADB\u2019s overall lending to the energy sector accounted for about 28% of total lending to Pakistan. \nAbout three fourths of the assistance to the power subsector ($1,575 million for 13 loans) has \nbeen  provided  to  WAPDA  and  the  rest  to  KESC.  ADB  has  been  the  major  source  of  external \nassistance  to  the  energy  sector  in  Pakistan,  having  provided  about  one  third  of  total  external \nresources to the sector. ADB\u2019s nonlending activities have also been important in the sector, with \na total of $16.0 million provided for 30 technical assistance (TA) projects.  \n \nSector  Portfolio  Description. The energy sector portfolio currently has two MFFs and \n60. \neight  ongoing  TA  projects.  The  two  ongoing  MFFs  in  the  renewable  energy  and  power \ntransmission  subsectors  are  in  the  early  stages  of  implementation  and  are  satisfactory.  TA \nimplementation  performance  is  generally  in  line  with  Pakistan  and  ADB-wide  averages.  The \ncountry operational framework emphasizes the need to strengthen governance and improve on \nportfolio performance, both of which are important in the energy sector. \n \n\n7. \n\nLessons  \n\n61. \nTen ADB-financed power projects approved before 1983 have been post-evaluated. All \nwere  classified  \u201cgenerally  successful\u201d.  The  post-evaluation  findings  showed  an  average \n\n12 \n\n \n\n\fimplementation  delay  of  2.4  years  (78%).  Five  of  the  projects  experienced  an  average  cost \noverrun  of  about  82%,  and  the  other  five  an  underrun  of  28%.  The  post-evaluations  drew \nattention  to  the  need  for  an  in-depth  analysis  of  all  technical  issues  before  a  project  is \nformulated,  and  the  need  to  review  cost  estimates  comprehensively  at  appraisal.  The \nperformance of ADB-financed projects after 1983 has improved. However, KESC and WAPDA \nhave been unable to meet the system loss targets, so they have not been able to comply with \nthe financial covenants. ADB loans are listed in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nTariff  adjustments  have  been  based  on  social  equity  and  affordability  considerations, \n62. \nwhich has led to a lack of commercial focus and inhibited KESC and WAPDA from generating \nenough funds to meet all expansion, rehabilitation, and reinforcement requirements. The utilities \nhave lacked focused leadership, good management practices, and transparency in operational \nand  financial  matters.  Most  ADB-financed  projects  have  been  sector  loans  and  more  recently \ntwo  MFFs.  This  allows  considerable  flexibility  in  selection  of  subprojects,  and  in  the  use  of \nconsultants  for  formulating  the  subprojects.  As  a  result,  cost  overruns  have  been  greatly \nreduced. However, slow project implementation remains a problem. Delays have been caused \nby  slow  procurement  of  consultants  and  goods,  bureaucratic  procedures,  organizational  and \ninstitutional weaknesses, changes in project scope, and shortages of qualified staff.  \n \n63. \nLessons  learned  from  previous  projects  are  reflected  in  three  specific  measures  in  the \nInvestment  Program:  (i)  in-depth  preparation  of  the  subprojects  included  in  each  tranche, \n(ii) early  action  on  procurement  and  consulting  services,  and  (iii)  measurable  milestones  and \nclose  implementation  facilitation  and  supervision.  To  ensure  quality  at  entry,  each  subproject \nhas  been  evaluated  using \n(iii) economic; \n(iv) environmental  assessment;  and  (v) social  assessment,  including  land  acquisition  and, \nwhere necessary, a resettlement plan. Such early attention to procurement will ensure that bid \ndocument  preparation  and  review  procedures  do  not  lead  to  delays.  Close  follow-up  during \nmanufacturing  of  goods,  construction  of  civil  works,  and  installation  should  ensure  timely \ncorrective measures where needed and an early completion of each subproject.  \n \n\nfive  criteria: \n\ntechnical; \n\nfinancial; \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n64. \nThe proposed Investment Program is closely linked to Pakistan\u2019s long-term power sector \nstrategy and is an integral part of the power distribution development program. The Investment \nProgram  will  enhance  the  efficiency  of  the  overall  power  distribution  system  and  provide  an \nadequate  and  reliable  power  supply  to  a  greater  number  of  industrial,  commercial  and \nresidential  customers.  The  power  sector  is  a  key  infrastructure  area  for  economic  growth  and \nsocial  development,  and  the  Investment  Program  will  be  a  vital  way  of  strengthening  and \nexpanding the power sector and supporting economic growth in Pakistan.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  proposed  Investment  Program  will  (i)  improve  power  distribution  infrastructure \n65. \nthrough  rehabilitation,  augmentation,  and  expansion  of  the  secondary  (132  kV  and  66  kV) \ntransmission  network,  and  relieve  the  power  system  from  distribution  bottlenecks  and \nconstraints;  and  (ii)  assist  in  commercializing  DISCO  operations.  Specifically,  (i)  about \n12,000 GWh  of  additional  energy  will  be  supplied  through  the  national  grid  annually;  (ii)  the \nsystem will be capable of meeting peak demand, with electricity outages significantly reduced; \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f(iii)  30  million  additional  people  will  have  access  to  electricity  from  the  national  grid;  and \n(iv) DISCOs will adhere to regulatory requirements and comply with the security standards.  \n \n66. \nare part of the DISCOs\u2019 investment plan, through individual loans for each tranche. \n \nC. \n\nThe  MMF  will  finance  the  proposed  Investment  Program,  comprising  subprojects  that \n\nInvestment Program Benefits and Beneficiaries  \n\nThe  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  provide  grid-connected  customers  with \n67. \nadequate  and  reliable  supply  of  electricity.  The  rehabilitation,  augmentation,  and  expansion  of \nthe  eight  power  distribution  systems  will  increase  the  reliability  of  supply  to  residential, \nagricultural,  commercial,  and  industrial  customers  in  Pakistan.  A  reliable  electricity  supply  will \nlead to social and economic benefits and improved conditions for schools, hospitals, and other \nsocial services.  \n \nD. \n\nTechnical Justification and Selection Criteria  \n\n68. \nThe subprojects under the proposed Investment Program for the eight DISCOs cover the \nwhole  country.  The  Investment  Program  is  divided  into  tranches,  with  Tranche-1  covering \napproximately  150  subprojects  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  Some  of  these  subprojects  are \nfurther subdivided into numerous smaller jobs at multisite locations on the distribution systems. \nThese  subprojects  are  urgently  needed  for  the  system  to  meet  system  security  reliability  and \nsafety  requirements.  The  following  criteria  were  used  to  identify  the  subprojects:  (i)  technical \njustification,  (ii)  financial  and  economic  viability,  and  (iii)  minimal  residual  environmental  and \nsocial  impacts.  Some  subprojects  to  address  health  and  safety,  operating  cost  reduction,  and \nimproved management information are also included. \n \n69. \nEach subproject in Tranche-1 has been tested for financial and economic viability, and \nassessed  for  environmental  or  social  impact.  In  the  case  of  the  sub-transmission  subprojects, \nload  flow  studies  by  NTDC  and  the  technical  merits  of  subprojects  were  assessed  and  the \nfeasibility  reports  presented  to  ADB.  Almost  60%  of  the  value  of  subprojects  proposed  for \nTranche-1  relates  to  the  secondary  transmission  system,  and  most  of  these  are  additions  or \naugmentations  to  transformers  within  existing  substations.  Two  subprojects  deliver  a  new \nsubstation,  with  an  associated  transmission  line  and  power  transformers,  and  four  involve \nconstruction of transmission lines.  \n \nThe  benefits  to  be  delivered  from  the  subprojects  in  Tranche-1  include  addition  of \n70. \napproximately 2,200 megavolt-amperes (MVA) of transformer capacity, improved the security of \nsupply to customers by moving toward compliance with regulatory security standards governing \nplanning  and  operation  of  the  sub-transmission  system,  with  reliability  and  availability \nimprovements on the lower voltages. \n \nE. \n \nThe DISCOs are relatively young entities and their capacity is in some cases limited, so \n71. \nthat they are dependent on external technical service providers (including NTDC) for a number \nof  technical  service  issues,  for  which  they  are  charged.  At  an  individual  level,  most  of  the \nDISCO  staff  are  well  motivated  to  improve  the  situation,  and  possess  the  necessary  technical \nskills to identify and prioritize the work required to improve their distribution systems. However, \nin  some  cases,  training  in  modern  distribution  planning  and  utility  management  in  a  regulated \nenvironment, as well as in information and communications technology, is needed to bring the \n\nSubproject Preparation, Implementation, and Monitoring Capabilities \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\fDISCOs  up  to  date.  DISCOs  still  require  adequate  project  management  and  implementation \nskills to implement a large loan with multiple location, size, and technology subprojects. \n \nADB  is  providing  support  through  the  Infrastructure  Development  loan 8 to  assist  the \n72. \nDISCOs  in  preparing  subprojects  for  Tranche-2.  The  objective  is  to  establish  resources  and \ncapacity in each DISCO to enable it to become autonomous and expand subproject preparation \nand implementation skills.  \n \n73. \nIn addition, an investment program support component will be provided to help DISCOs \nprepare, implement, and monitor the subprojects under the Investment Program (Appendix 3). It \nwill  cover  (i)  power  distribution  subproject  implementation,  including  general  business \nmanagement,  portfolio  review,  project  management,  and  program  management;  (ii)  technical \noperation and maintenance; (iii) accounting, financial, and economic management, and financial \nreporting; \n(v)  management \ninformation system and economics of cost recovery and tariff setting; (vi) project development, \nincluding  policy  development,  feasibility  studies,  site  identification,  and  project  design;  and \n(vii) utility management in a regulated environment. \n \nF. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n(iv) contracting,  procurement,  and \n\ninventory  management, \n\nThe total investment requirement for the DISCOs from FY2008 to FY2017 is estimated \n\n74. \nat $5.2 billion.

It  has  been  nominated  by  MOWP  to  act  as  the  Executing  Agency  (EA), \nwith each DISCO being the Implementing Agency (IA) for work in its own area. PEPCO\u2019s role in \nthe  processing  and  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program  is  that  of  a  coordinator  of \nactivities, such as preparation of Planning Commission (PC-1) forms and PFRs, and monitoring \nimplementation  activities.  The  DISCOs  are  responsible  for  (i)  selecting  and  preparing  the \nsubprojects,  (ii)  submitting  their  requirements  for  inclusion  in  PC-1  documents  to  PEPCO,  (iii) \nsubmitting  withdrawal  applications  to  ADB,  and  (iv)  timely  implementation  of  respective \nsubprojects.  \n \n81. \nAn implementation consultant will be employed under the Investment Program to assist \nthe DISCOs in project implementation, albeit providing different levels of assistance to different \nDISCOs. The implementation consultant will be staffed with international and local experts. The \nimplementation consultant will report to PEPCO on administrative issues and to each DISCO on \noperational issues. Each DISCO will establish a project management unit (PMU). The PMU will \nundertake project preparation, implementation, and reporting duties; and will ensure compliance \nwith ADB regulations. \n \n\n2. \n\nInvestment Program Management  \n\n82. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  follow  MFF  implementation  procedures.  Each  DISCO  will \nbe  responsible  for  preparing  its  own  subprojects,  which  will  be  combined  into  a  single  multi-\nDISCO PFR. Preparation of the combined PFR will be the responsibility of PEPCO, which will \nsubmit  the  PFR  to  ADB  through  the  Economic  Affairs  Division  when  (i)  the  PFR  has  been \nprepared  in  accordance  with  MFF  requirements,  and  (ii)  PEPCO  has  received  the  required \ngovernment  approvals.  The  DISCOs  will  make  their  PFR  submissions  to  PEPCO  in  a  timely \nmanner  to  meet  the  implementation  plan  in  Appendix  5.  Prior  to  ADB  acceptance  of  a  PFR, \nADB  will  conduct  due  diligence  to  ensure  that  the  Government  complies  in  full  with  the  terms \nand conditions of the FFA.  \n \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fEach  DISCO  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  from  the  date  of  loan  effectivity \n83. \ncovering preparation and implementation of each PFR. A combined progress report, covering all \nparticipating DISCOs, will be compiled by the implementation consultant during its tenure. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n84. \nThe  Investment  Program  will  be  implemented  over  10  years,  inclusive  of  procurement \nand  construction  activities,  from  2008  to  2017.  The  subprojects  are  expected  to  have \nimplementation periods of 3 years. The last PFR should be submitted not later than the end of \n2014. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement and Consulting Services \n\nEach DISCO will conduct the procurement of goods and services for its own subprojects. \n\n85. \nRecruitment of the implementation consultant will be conducted by PEPCO. \n \nProcurement of goods and services to be financed under the Investment Program will be \n86. \nimplemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time). International competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for the supply of goods and works \nbeing funded under the Investment Program. ICB will be used for goods contracts estimated to \ncost  the  equivalent  of  $1  million  or  more,  and  for  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent of $5 million or more. A tentative procurement plan for the subprojects to be financed \nunder  Tranche-1,  indicating  the  detailed  thresholds  of  each  procurement  method,  is  in \nAppendix 6. The procurement plan will be updated annually to cover the next 18-month period. \n \n87. \nConsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Firms  carrying  out  consulting \nservices  will  be  selected  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method.  Individual \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nBecause  of  the  continuation  of  a  number  of  tasks  during  implementation,  it  is  envisioned  that \nsingle source selection may be used for certain assignments with the prior approval of ADB. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n88. \nA separate Loan Agreement will be established between the Government and ADB for \neach  PFR.  The  Loan  Agreement  will  describe  the  detailed  disbursement  arrangements  for  a \nspecified  PFR.  All  loan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Imprest  accounts  will  be  established  for  all \nDISCOs, which will be invited to ADB\u2019s loan disbursement seminars conducted in Pakistan. An \nimprest  account  for  the  ADF  loan  will  be  opened  by  PEPCO.  Statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment  under \n$100,000 for the OCR loan and $50,000 for the ADF loan. \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing  \n\n89. \nBecause of the urgent nature of the subprojects, the Government and the DISCOs have \nrequested ADB approval to carry out advance contracting for procurement of works and goods \nfor each tranche. The Government has also requested retroactive financing of up to 20% of the \nloan amount for each tranche under the Investment Program.  \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\fThe  Mission  agreed  to  seek  ADB  Management  approval  for  advance  contracting  and \n90. \nretroactive  financing  of  expenditures  for  the  first  and  subsequent  tranches  (up  to  20%  of  the \nproceeds from individual loans under the MFF) provided that those expenditures are incurred in \naccordance  with  agreed  procedures  and  during  the  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding  individual  Loan  Agreement  and  loan  effectiveness  under  the  MFF.  Retroactive \nfinancing  is  sought  for  eligible  expenditures  including  civil  works,  goods,  and  consulting \nservices.  Such \ninvoluntary  resettlement \nrequirements stated in the subproject resettlement plan. The Government and the DISCOs have \nbeen informed that approval of advanced contracting and retroactive financing does not commit \nADB to finance any of the proposed subprojects. It should also be noted that the Government \nand  the  DISCOs  must  comply  with  all  ADB  procurement  procedures  in  order  to  qualify  for \nretroactive financing. \n \n\nfinancing  will  be  subject \n\nto  compliance  with \n\n7. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n91. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  DISCOs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nsubprojects  under  the  Investment  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for \nthe  Investment  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nInvestment  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine \nthe  records  and  accounts  of  all  DISCOs,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  and  consultants  and \nother service providers as they relate to the Investment Program. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n92.  Within 6 months of the close of each fiscal year, PEPCO and each DISCO will submit to \nADB  audited  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  to  which  they  relate.  An  independent \nauditor  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  hired  by  PEPCO  and  each  DISCO  to  conduct  audits  on  all \nassociated accounts. The auditor will also review and provide separate opinions at the proper \nuse of statement of expenditure procedures. \n \n93. \nThe DISCOs inherited an internal audit system from WAPDA. The system provides for \nthe internal audit to be involved in the procurement and disposal process as well as to perform \nannual audits. In addition, most DISCOs have established an audit committee with an external \nprofessional  chair.  This  committee  reports  to  the  board  of  directors.  However,  most  DISCOs \nhave  not  yet  developed  policies  to  reflect  their  independent  status  fully  because  of  lack  of \nresources. The  requested  program  support  component  would  include provisions  to  hasten  the \ndevelopment of audit policies and procedures and to strengthen the capacity of staff.  \n \nH. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  quarterly  progress  reports  prepared  by  each  DISCO  will  provide  (i)  a  narrative \n94. \ndescription of progress made during the period (progress on compliance with environmental and \nsocial  requirements,  including  the  environmental  management  plan  [EMP]  and  resettlement \nframework, will also be included); (ii) changes in the implementation schedule; (iii) problems or \ndifficulties encountered; and (iv) work to be carried out in the next period. The progress reports \nwill  also  include  a  summary  financial  account  for  the  subproject  components,  consisting  of \nsubproject  expenditures  during  the  period,  total  expenditure  to  date,  and  benefit  monitoring  in \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\faccordance with procedures and details acceptable to ADB. Performance will be evaluated on \nthe  basis  of  indicators  and  targets  stipulated  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  ADB \nManagement  will  prepare  periodic  reports  to  inform  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  of  overall \nprogress.  A  Board  information  report  will  be  submitted  annually,  and  progress  reports  will  be \nsubmitted to inform the Board of the approval of Loan Agreements. \n \n\n1. \n\nReview \n\nADB  will  regularly  field  review  missions  to  review  implementation  and  operations, \n95. \nincluding  resettlement  and  environmental  aspects  based  on  quarterly  progress  reports.  It  will \nmeet  with  the  Government  and  DISCOs  semiannually  to  discuss  implementation  progress.  A \nmidterm review will be carried out 2 years after each loan becomes effective. This will focus on \nthe  engineering,  financial,  resettlement,  environmental,  and  social  aspects  of  ADB-supported \ninvestments  of  all  DISCOs.  Representatives  of  ADB  and  DISCOs  will  take  part  in  the  review. \nThe  midterm  review  will  evaluate  compliance  with  warranties  and  representations  of  the  FFA, \nand assurances in individual Loan Agreements. The review will allow for necessary midcourse \ncorrections  to  ensure  successful  implementation  and  achievement  of  objectives.  A  project \ncompletion  report  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of  the  completion  of  the  subprojects \nfinanced  under  individual  Loan  Agreements.  An  Investment  Program  completion  report  will  be \nprepared  after  the  completion  of  all  ADB-supported  activities  and  subprojects  under  the \nInvestment Program. \n \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE OF THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nTechnical Analysis  \n\n96. \nSubprojects  to  extend  and  augment  existing  grid  substations,  or  build  new  grid \nsubstations  have  been  selected  following  routine  operational  load  readings  and  system \nmanagement.  They  have  then  been  confirmed  by  load  flow  studies,  including  analysis  of  any \nalternative solutions. The studies are based on expected 2013 conditions and follow the NTDC \ndemand forecast for the transmission system and the individual distribution companies, modified \nby  the  DISCOs  and  ADB.  As  such,  the  distribution  investments  are  optimized  and  prioritized, \nand represent a least-cost approach.  \n \n97.  With  the  current  demand  on  the  network  and  the  anticipated  growth,  the  risk  of  any \ninvestment in Tranche-1 subsequently being found to be avoidable, or significantly in advance \nof need, is considered minimal. The subprojects to be included in Tranche-1 will not be affected \nby  any  drastic  changes  in  the  long-term  system  expansion  plan.  Detailed  subproject \ndescriptions are provided in Supplementary Appendix C. They are considered urgent and have \nbeen  selected  to  address  previous  inadequate  planning,  underinvestment,  and  lack  of \nmaintenance. The Tranche-1 subprojects are summarized below: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ntwo subprojects will build new substations, adding a total of 100 MVA of capacity; \n111  subprojects  will  add  transformers  or  replace  existing  transformers  in \noverloaded/heavily loaded locations, adding a further 2,100 MVA of capacity; \nseven  subprojects,  with  multiple  subcomponents,  address  power \ncorrection; \n18 subprojects, with multiple subcomponents, address system rehabilitation and \nextension of networks to improve system losses and reliability; \nfour  subprojects  address  health  and  safety,  operating  cost  reduction,  and \nimprove management information and control; and \n\nfactor \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\f(vi) \n\nfour  subprojects  will  upgrade  voltage  levels  on  existing  secondary  transmission \nsystems to improve power transfer capacity. \n\n \nFinancial Management and Financial Analysis  \n\nB. \n\nInternational  Accounting  Standards.  However, \n\n98. \nFinancial management assessment was carried out to evaluate each DISCO\u2019s ability to \nundertake  and  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  (Appendix  7).  Questionnaires  and  field \ninterviews  were  used  to  review  the  present  standing  of  financial  management  of  the  eight \nDISCOs.  The  assessment  recognizes  that  the  DISCOs  are  in  a  transitional  phase  toward \nachieving  financial  and  operational  independence.  Accounting  diagnostic  tools\u2014such  as  the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  Comprehensive  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment, 12  Public \nExpenditure  Review,13 and  ADB  TA14\u2014were  further  reviewed  to  examine  fiduciary  risk  at  the \nmacro  level.  This  identified  issues,  constraints,  and  recommendations  covering  budgeting, \naccounting,  internal  controls,  funds  transfer,  audit,  and  legislative  compliance  to  ensure \ninvestment funds are utilized efficiently and effectively. \n \nThe  financial  management  risk  of  each  DISCO  is  deemed  manageable,  with  varying \n99. \ndegrees of financial management needs. Each DISCO would benefit from external assistance in \nfinancial  management.  QESCO,  HESCO,  and  PESCO  would  benefit  most,  all  of  which  are \nfacing  financial  difficulties.  The  financial  statements  are  prepared  on  an  accrual  basis  in \ninherited \naccordance  with \naccounting  systems  from  WAPDA,  involving  manual  intervention.  At  present,  all  DISCOs  are \nactively  seeking  to strengthen  accounting  and management  information  systems  and  controls; \nsome  are  more  advanced  in  the  selection  and  planning  for  the  use  of  computerized  systems, \nwhich  will  improve  the  accuracy,  timeliness,  and  relevance  of  financial  and  management \ninformation.  \n \n100.  Although DISCOs were unbundled from WAPDA in 1998, they continue to be financially \ndependent on WAPDA. Despite having their own bank accounts, cash collected by the DISCOs \nhas  in  the  past  been  controlled  by  WAPDA.  Increase  in  customer  retail  tariffs  has  been \ninsufficient to cover DISCOs\u2019 power purchase costs, and delayed tariff determination by NEPRA \nconstrains  DISCOs  to  rely  on  government  support.  Cost-reflective,  transparent,  and  timely \ndetermination  and  notification  of  DISCO  tariffs  by  NEPRA  and  the  Government  will  provide \ngreater  financial  independence  for  DISCOs.  A  summary  of  DISCO  financial  performance  and \nprojections is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n101.  The financial analysis of the proposed Tranche-1 (Appendix 8) has been carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.15 Financial viability was \ngauged by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of with- and without-project investment \nscenarios  over  FY2008\u2013FY2028.  All  financial  costs  and  benefits  have  been  expressed  at  a \nconstant  mid-2007  price  level.  Cost  streams  used  for  the purposes  of  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  (FIRR)  determination  (i.e.,  capital  investment,  and  operation  and  maintenance)  reflect \ncosts of delivering the estimated financial benefits. The current tariff, determined by NEPRA and \nnotified by the Government for each DISCO in February 2007, was reviewed and recalculated to \n\nthe  DISCOs \n\n                                                 \n12 World  Bank.  2003.

The combined preliminary FIRR estimate of 17.6% on the secondary transmission grid \ncomponent compares favorably with the estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of \n8.3%, indicating financial viability of Tranche-1 subprojects. \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n102.  The  proposed  investments  to  be  funded  by  ADB  are  part  of  Pakistan\u2019s  integrated \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution expansion program; and an integral component of the \ntransmission and distribution system development plan prepared based on NTDC load forecast \nusing  least-cost  planning  principles.  The  economic  analysis  was  based  on  a  \u201ctime-slice\u201d \napproach  to  the  distribution  sector  development  plan,  as  individual  subprojects  are  not  stand-\nalone  investments  and  would  not  yield  all  their  benefits  if  considered  in  isolation.  The \nInvestment Program will ease chronic supply shortages and help meet the projected growth in \ndemand  for  electric  power.  Demand  forecasts  and  cost-benefit  projections  were  prepared  and \nanalyzed and the Investment Program was judged to be economically viable. A summary of the \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 9.  \n \n103.  The  main  benefits  stem  from  (i)  allowing  for  system  expansion  to  meet  load  growth; \n(ii) improving  efficiency,  reliability,  and  system  security;  and  (iii)  reducing  losses.  The  physical \noutput\u2014rehabilitated, augmented, and expanded distribution infrastructure\u2014will add to existing \nsupply (incremental benefits).  \n \n104.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  to  be  23%,  based  on  the \nincremental  cost-benefit  streams  associated  with  the  proposed  investments.  Economic \nperformance  was  evaluated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  EIRR \ncompares the annual streams of economic capital and operating costs against benefits, based \non willingness-to-pay. All costs, benefits, and revenues are expressed in 2007 constant prices. \nThe  analysis  period  includes  the  construction  period  and  30  years  of  operation.  Economic \nbenefits  accrue  to  customers  and  the  economy  as  a  result  of  the  Investment  Program. \nIncremental consumption occurs because of the extended availability of adequate and reliable \npower  supplies.  The  economic  feasibility  of  the  proposed  subprojects  in  Tranche-1  has  been \ntested  by  establishing  the  need  for  the  subprojects,  and  establishing  that  they  represent  the \nleast-cost means of achieving their objectives. The analysis results in an EIRR of 30%, justifying \nthe viability of Tranche-1 investment. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment  \n\n105.  Environmental  assessment  for  all  the  subprojects  of  Tranche-1  has  been  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \n(2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines. 16  Subprojects  prepared  under \ntranches  will  all  have  environmental \nassessment  to  comply  with  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF) \nagreed  by  the  Federal  (Pakistan)  Environmental  Protection  Agency  and  ADB,  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  assessment  regulations  and  guidelines  under  the  Pakistan \nEnvironmental  Protection  Act,  1997.  The  Tranche-1  subprojects  have  been  categorized  as  B. \nInitial environmental examination (IEE) reports have been prepared for all the subprojects that \ninclude an environmental management plan (EMP) with implementation budget. A summary IEE \nis  in  Supplementary  Appendix F.  No  component  of  any  Tranche-1  subproject  falls  in  an \nenvironmentally sensitive or protected area. \n\nfuture \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n\n\f106.  To  mitigate  the  potential  adverse  impacts  of  the  construction  stages  of  subprojects, \ndetailed EMPs have been prepared as part of the IEEs. The numerous subprojects in Tranche-1 \nare far apart, with many in different provinces, so there is little potential for cumulative impacts \nin  the  design,  construction,  or  operational  phases.  However,  the  objective  of  the  Investment \nProgram  is  to  produce  cumulative  benefits  to  the  secondary  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems in the operational phase. Therefore, there is minimal negative impact expected on the \nsector. \n \n107.  The  DISCOs  will  implement  and  monitor  the  submission  and  clearance  of  IEEs  and \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  under  statutory  provisions.  They  will  ensure  that  bidding \ndocuments  and  contracts  include  the  mitigation  measures,  as  required by  the  EMPs,  and  that \nthe  mitigation  measures  are  implemented  by  the  contractors.  The  Project  requires  the \nestablishment of an environmental and social cell within each DISCO, and the appointment of \nenvironmental  and  social  specialists  within  that  cell  as  a  condition  for  Tranche-2  of  the \nInvestment Program to be effective.  \n  \nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards  \n\n108.  Minimal land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) or livelihood impacts may be expected \nfor  subprojects  requiring  the  construction  of  new  grid  substations  or  transmission  lines.  For \nsubprojects  entailing  the  construction  of  distribution  lines  (up  to  11  kV)\u2014a  subproject  type \nwhere poles are to be sited within public roads corridors\u2014no LAR will be needed, nor allowed \nunder the LAR framework (LARF; see FFA, schedule 5).   \n\n109.  LAR for new grid stations is expected to be carried out through mechanisms that will not \ntrigger ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy such as purchase/sale between willing buyer and \nwilling seller, use of unoccupied government land, or voluntary donations from DISCOs\u2019 clients. \nIn these cases, a due diligence report (DDR) will be prepared to provide proof that the land was \nacquired  through  the  mechanisms  specified  above,  but  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nplan (LARP) will be required. LAR for transmission lines, on the contrary, will have to be carried \nout through the application of the right of eminent domain and will thus trigger implementation of \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy and require the preparation of LARPs. This will also be \nthe  case  of  subprojects  involving  substation  construction  if  the  above  detailed  mechanism \ncannot be applied and LAR will entail the exercise of eminent domain. \n\n110.  The LARF is summarized in Appendix 10 and shown in Supplementary Appendix G. The \nLARF details all mechanisms for the preparation and implementation of LARPs in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and  the  MFF  guidelines.  The  LARF  has  been \nprepared by PEPCO and endorsed by each DISCO. The appraisal of successive tranches will \nrequire a review of the LARF to ensure that its content fits the conditions of the new subprojects. \nUnder  Tranche-1  of  this  Investment  Program,  seven  secondary  transmission  lines  will  require \nthe preparation of a short LARP and two substations will require the preparation of a DDR (one \nof the DDRs is included in the short LARP for one transmission line).  \n \n111.  To fit this project context, it has been agreed that the term \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d used by \nADB  fully  corresponds  to  the  term  \u201ctribal  peoples\u201d  used  in  Pakistan.  Indigenous/tribal  peoples \nmay  be  affected  only  by  projects  in  the  North-West  Frontier  Province\u2019s  tribal  areas.  However, \ndue diligence also needs to be carried out for projects in Baluchistan where groups not officially \ndefined  as  \u201ctribal\u201d  practice  a  collective  system  of  land  property,  reside.  For  some  of  these \nprojects,  documentation  inclusive  of  social  assessment  and  mechanics  for  the  acquisition  of \ncollective  property  will  have  to  be  prepared.  An  indigenous  peoples  development  framework \n\n23 \n\n \n\n\f(IPDF) for the Investment Program has been prepared by PEPCO and agreed with DISCOs and \nADB  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  No  indigenous  peoples  are  affected  by  Tranche-1 \nsubprojects.  Appraisal  of  successive  tranches  will  require  a  review  of  the  IPDF  to  reflect  the \nspecificities of the new subprojects. \n \nF. \n\nPoverty Assessment  \n\n112.  The  overall  strategy  of  the  Investment  Program  is  to  address  bottlenecks  to  economic \ngrowth  and  the  delivery  of  high  quality  supply  of  electricity  to  the  unserved  population \n(Appendix 11).  The  Investment  Program  will  benefit  grid-connected  customers  with  adequate \nand  reliable  supply  of  electricity,  which  would  support  the  projections  for  growth  in  energy \ndemand  and  the  Government\u2019s  confirmed  intent  to  make  affordable  grid-based  electricity \nsupplies  available  to  the  entire  population  through  the  Village  Electrification  Program.  The \nbeneficiaries will be the population residing in unserved areas, and existing customers receiving \nimproved quality of supply. These areas are currently not benefiting from subsidized electricity \ntariffs, but are indirectly paying for them in terms of taxes, forgone access to electricity, or other \nforgone investments. A secure and predictable electricity supply will enable social and economic \nbenefits to materialize. Poor and vulnerable customers\u2014including hospitals, schools, and other \nsocial  utilities\u2014are  often  hardest  hit  by  inadequate  power  supply,  load  shedding,  and  poor \npower quality. They will also benefit directly from the investments.  \n \n113. \nImprovements  in  quality  and  reliability  of  supply  that  will  accrue  from  targeted \ninvestments are expected to improve living conditions in the rural areas through the creation of \njob  and  income  opportunities.  Businesses  as  well  as  farmers  are  expected  to  increase  their \nproductivity.  Demand  for  electric  installations,  supplies,  and  maintenance  is  expected  to \nincrease, creating further new job opportunities. In addition, a reliable electricity supply improves \nhouseholds\u2019  quality  of  life,  especially  for  women  who  are  traditionally  responsible  for  activities \ninside the house. A comprehensive poverty impact assessment for the Investment Program  is \nbeing  prepared.  The  preliminary  data  show  that  unserved  areas  are  among  the  most \neconomically deprived, with the highest proportion of poor people in Pakistan.  \n \nG. \n\nPotential Risks and Assumptions  \n\n114.  Key  assumptions  are  (i)  macroeconomic  growth  will  remain  stable;  (ii)  federal  and \nprovincial  governments  will  remain  committed  to  power  sector  reforms  and  there  will  be \ncontinued progress on policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms; and (iii) counterpart funds will \nbe mobilized in a timely manner. \n \n115.  Risks to the Investment Program include (i) delays in power sector reforms, both in tariff \ndeterminations  and  in  notifications  of  the  rates  applicable  to  the  distribution  companies  by \nNEPRA  and  the  Government;  (ii)  delays  in  tariff  determinations  and  notifications  of  rates \napplicable  for  NTDC\u2019s  wheeling  charges  by  NEPRA  and  the  Government,  to  facilitate \ninvestments  in  power  transmission  facilities;  (iii)  lack  of  and  untimely  payment  by  the \nGovernment  of  subsidies  to  DISCOs;  (iv)  increases  in  prices  of  cement,  steel,  fuel,  and  other \nraw  materials  that  would  render  the  Investment  Program  financially  nonviable;  (v)  delays  in \nsubproject  implementation;  (vi)  failure  to  complete  environmental  and  social  assessments  and \nto  actively  pursue  and  secure  environmental  clearances \nfor  all  subprojects  before \ncommencement  of  construction;  and  (vii)  failure  to  mobilize  the  necessary  counterpart  funds. \nThese risks all appear low: DISCOs are committed to expanding power supply within Pakistan \nthrough  increased  investments  in  distribution  facilities.  The  lack  of  capacity  in  DISCOs  to \nfacilitate environmental and resettlement compliance is a concern, but this can be mitigated by \n\n24 \n\n \n\n\fmaking  dedicated  resources  and  staffing  a  requirement  of  the  loan,  as  specified  in  the  FFA. \nRisk  analyses  will  be  expanded  to  include  sensitivity  analyses  at  a  later  stage  of  Investment \nProgram processing.  \n \n116.  Specific assumptions for the subprojects under the Tranche-1 are: (i) counterpart funds \nwill  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner;  (ii)  there  will  be  no  delay  in  the  notification  of \ndistribution  company  tariffs;  and  (iii)  CPPA  will  be  established  and  empowered  in  a  timely \nfashion,  since  without  it,  the  financial  viability  of  DISCOs  and  NTDC  cannot  be  ensured.  The \nrisks are: (i) there will be a delay in recruitment of consultants and in procurement of contracts in \nthe  approval  process  within  DISCOs;  and  (ii)  prices  of  equipment  and  materials,  such  as \ncement,  steel,  fuel,  and  other  raw  materials,  will  increase,  possibly  making  the  subprojects \nfinancially  nonviable.  Contingency  funds  will  be  allocated  to  respond  to  any  unforeseen \nchanges. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n117.  The  Government  and  DISCOs  have  agreed  to  the  following  specific  assurances,  in \naddition  to  the  standard  assurances  and  assurances  agreed  to  in  the  FFA,  which  will  be \nincorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n118.  Policy  Dialogue.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  ADB  is  kept  informed  about  the \nGovernment\u2019s  policies  and  programs  related  to  the  power  sector  that  will  materially  affect  the \nfinancial  viability  of  DISCOs  and  each  subproject  under  the  Investment  Program,  and  in \nparticular  the  power  generation  and  transmission  policies  and  program,  as  well  as  the  power \ndistribution policies and program.  \n\n \n\n119.  Tariff. DISCOs will submit petitions for tariff revision as required to maintain its financial \nviability. Following tariff determination by NEPRA, the Government will undertake to notify such \ntariff determination in a prompt manner. Starting 2009, the Government will ensure that the tariff \nformulated for DISCOs are adequate to cover operating costs, maintenance, depreciation, and \nfinancing cost and to allow an acceptable return on the equity of DISCOs.  \n \n\n1. \n\nCounterpart Funding \n\n120.  The  Government  will  ensure,  and  cause  DISCOs  to  ensure,  the  availability  and  timely \nrelease of counterpart funding for the timely implementation of subprojects financed under the \nInvestment Program. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Management and Performance Indicators \n\n121.  Financial Performance. The Government will ensure that each DISCO maintains a debt \nservice coverage ratio of at least 1.2 from 2011 onward and a self-financing ratio of at least 20% \nfrom 2011 onward. \n \n122.  Financial  Autonomy.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  DISCOs  bill  all  customers \ndirectly  and  in  a  timely  manner  for  the  power  distribution  services  rendered.  The  Government \nwill  ensure  that  all  government  paying  authorities  provide  prompt  payment  to  DISCOs,  and  in \ncase  of  any  shortfall  from  the  paying  authority,  the  Government  finances  such  shortfall  in  a \ntimely manner. \n\n25 \n\n \n\n\f \n123.  Auditing  and  Accounting.  The  Government  will  cause  DISCOs  to  ensure  that  proper \naccounts  and  records  are  maintained  in  a  timely  manner  to  adequately  identify  the  use  of \ntranche  proceeds  in  such  a  manner  and  details  as  may  be  specified  in  each  loan  agreement \nand project agreement. Audited financial reports of each DISCO will be submitted to ADB within \n6 months of the end of fiscal year to which they relate. \n \n124.  Financial  Governance.  The  Government  will  cause  each  DISCO  to  ensure  that  its \ninternal controls are in accordance with the National Accounting Standards, and an independent \nand autonomous internal audit department is set up within each DISCO.  \n \n\n3. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement   \n\n125.  Medium/low voltage lines up to 11 kV causing LAR or income impacts will not be eligible \nto  financing  under  the  Facility.  However,  lines  at  voltages  of  33  kV  and  above  and  substation \nsubprojects causing LAR or income impacts will be fully eligible for financing under the Facility. \nIn the case of these subprojects, the Government will cause each DISCO to ensure that (i) all \nland  and  rights-of-way  required  by  the  subprojects  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner; \n(ii) the provisions of the relevant LARP are implemented promptly and efficiently according to its \nterms, applicable laws and regulations of Pakistan, ADB\u2019s  Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, \nADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual  F2  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (2003),  and  the  LARF;  (iii)  the \nrelevant  LARP  is  updated  based  on  the  detailed  design,  prepared  in  full  consultation  with  the \naffected  persons  and  disclosed  to  them  prior  to  submitting  the  LARP  to  ADB;  (iv)  the \ncontractors\u2019 activities are in compliance with requirements of the relevant LARP and the LARF, \nand  (v)  an  independent  monitor  acceptable  to  ADB  is  engaged  to  carry  out  monitoring  and \nevaluation and report to ADB in accordance with the requirements of the LARPs. The signing of \ncivil  work  contracts  or  a  similar  milestone  will  be  subject  to  ADB\u2019s  review  and  approval  of  the \nrelevant  LARP  and  award  of  civil  works  will  be  subject  to  ADB  review  and  approval  of \nimplementation  of  the  relevant  LARPs,  including  the  provision  of  full  compensation  to  the \naffected people. \n \n\n4. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n126.  The  Government  will  cause  each  DISCO  to  ensure  that  all  subprojects  affecting  tribal \npeoples are constructed and operated in accordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous  Peoples  as  specified  in  the  IPDF  and  indigenous  peoples  development  plans \n(IPDPs) agreed with ADB. Each DISCO will ensure that the IPDP are monitored and evaluated \nby an independent agency. \n \n\n5. \n\nEnvironment  \n\n127.  The Government will cause each DISCO to ensure that (i) the subprojects are designed, \nconstructed, operated, and maintained in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations of \nPakistan  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy;  (ii)  all  subprojects  will  strictly  follow  the  mitigation \nmeasures  in  the  IEE, including  the EMPs  and  the  EARF;  (iii)  mitigation  measures  identified in \nthe EMPs will be incorporated in bidding documents and civil work contracts and implemented \nunder supervision of the DISCOs; and (iv) environmental monitoring reports will be submitted to \nADB  twice  annually  during  the  construction  and  operation period,  including  progress  made  on \nthe mitigation measures, monitoring data, problems encountered, enforcement plan, complaints, \nviolations, or modifications to mitigation measures to take account of unexpected environmental \nimpacts and the acceptability of the residual impacts. \n\n26 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n6. \n\nSocial Impacts  \n\n128.  The  Government  will  cause  each  DISCO  to  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contractors \n(i) comply with all applicable labor laws of Pakistan and pertinent occupational health and safety \nregulations,  (ii)  use  their  best  efforts  to  employ  women  living  in  the  vicinity  of  the \nproject/subproject  area,  (iii)  disseminate  information  at  worksites  on  the  risks  of  sexually \ntransmitted  diseases  and  HIV/AIDS  for  those  employed  during  construction,  and  (iv)  are \nrequired  not  to  differentiate  between  men  and  women\u2019s  wages  or  benefits  for  work  of  equal \nvalue, and not to use child labor. Contracts for all projects to be financed under the Investment \nProgram  must  include  specific  clauses  on  these  undertakings,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly \nmonitored. \n \n129.  The  Government  will  cause  each  DISCO  to  monitor  the  subproject  effects  on  women \nduring  each  subproject  implementation,  through,  where  relevant,  gender-disaggregated  data \ncollected  pursuant  to  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  referred  to  in  the  subproject \nperformance monitoring system. \n \n\n7. \n\nExecution of Civil Works Contracts  \n\n130.  Each  DISCO  will  ensure  that,  subsequent  to  award  of  civil  works  contract  under  any \nsubproject, no section or part thereof under the civil works contract will be handed over to the \ncontractor  unless  (i)  the  applicable  provisions  of  the  LARF  and  LARPs,  including  in  particular \nthe  timely  delivery  of  compensation  to  affected  families,  (ii)  the  IPDF  and  IPDPs,  and  (iii)  the \nEARF/EMPs have been complied with. \n \n131.

The key challenges of the power \nsector  are  (i)  lack  of  generation  capacity,  (ii)  increasing  constraints  in  the  transmission  and \ndistribution  systems,  (iii) weak  financial  management  and  sustainability  of  the  sector  entities, \nand (iv) inadequate corporate governance structures for the power companies. \n   \n2. \nAccording to government estimates, electricity demand in Pakistan is forecasted to grow \nby at least 8% a year during 2005\u20132015. To meet this increasing demand, it is estimated that \nPakistan  will  require  an  additional  2,000  megawatts  (MW)  annually,  which  will  need  to  fed \nthrough  the  distribution  system.  The  Medium  Term  Development  Framework,  2005\u20132010 \n(MTDF)  spells  out  the  Government\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy,  including  investments  in  power \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Based  on  the  MTDF,  the  Government  developed  a \nlong-term power generation plan. This identified the demand for increased generation capacity, \nand addressed the size and timing of the commissioning of the new plants. The overall power \ntransmission  strategy  is  to  ensure  that  the  electricity  from  the  new  power  generation  plants  is \nevacuated to the load centers.  \n \n3. \nThe  effective  evacuation  of  power  from  all  the  existing  generating  stations,  and \nconnection of the stations to be commissioned in future, is vested in the National Transmission \nand  Despatch  Company  (NTDC).  In  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power \n(MOWP),  NTDC  prepared  the  power  transmission  sector  road  map  and  corresponding \ninvestment plans. In 2006, at the request of the Government, ADB agreed to long-term financing \nsupport  of  the  power  transmission subsector  through  a  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to \nNTDC  to  realize  the  investment  needs.  The  power  transmission  investment  subprojects  are \ncurrently  under  implementation.  These  developments  together  address  the  generation  and \nprimary  transmission  of  electric  power  to  the  eight  geographically  split  power  distribution \ncompanies (DISCOs). \n \n4. \nDISCOs  receive  electric  power  from  NTDC  in  their  respective  geographic  areas  and \nhave inherited the distribution assets at operating voltages of 132 kilovolt (kV) and below. With \nthis  goes  the  obligation  to  distribute  electricity  and  make  supplies  available  within  their \ngeographic  boundaries  under  rules,  service  conditions,  and  tariffs  laid  down  by  the  National \nElectric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).  \n \n5. \nDISCOs  face  several  challenges  as  their  power  distribution  systems  (i)  do  not  provide \ncomplete  geographic  coverage,  (ii)  have  a  shortage  of  capacity  in  areas  they  do  cover,  and \n(iii) suffer from the consequences of years of inadequate maintenance and underinvestment. \n \n6. \nHigh  growth  in  electricity  demand  in  Pakistan  is  putting  the  existing  power  distribution \ninfrastructure  under  severe  stress  and  there  is  a  clear  need  for  investment.  Substantial \ninvestments  in  rehabilitation,  augmentation,  and  expansion  of  the  eight  power  distribution \nsystems  will  increase  the  reliability  of  supply  to  residential,  agricultural,  commercial,  and \nindustrial  customers  in  Pakistan.  A  secure  and  predictable  electricity  supply  will  lead  to  social \nand economic benefits and improve conditions for schools, hospitals, and other social services. \nThis power distribution sector development road map is a comprehensive plan that specifies the \ndetails  of  system  renovation  and  expansion  to  provide  all  grid-connected  customers  with \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n33 \n\nadequate and reliable supply of electricity, which will support the Government\u2019s objective of 8% \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth per annum.  \n \nB. \n\nObjective \n\n7. \nThe objective of the road map is to show how the eight DISCOs can deliver reliable and \nhigh-quality  power  supply  to  the  rising  number  of  industrial,  commercial,  agricultural,  and \ndomestic customers. It is consistent with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and has \nthe following intended outcomes: (i) a more efficient power system; (ii) high-quality power supply \nthrough  a  more  reliable  and  stable  system;  (iii) greater  geographic  coverage;  and  (iv)  greater \navailability of and access to affordable electricity, by relieving the power distribution constraints. \nThe Power Distribution Sector Road Map, 2008\u20132017, is in Table A2.1. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Power Distribution Sector Road Map, 2008\u20132017 \n\n \nImpact  \n\n \nPerformance \n\n \nMeasurement \n\n \n\n \nObjective \n\n \n\n1.

Without a stable and reliable distribution system, \nany additional generated power will not be delivered to customers. The total investment needs \nfor the next 10 years are estimated to be $5.2 billion (Table A4.1).  \n \n\nTable A4.1: DISCO\u2019s Total Investment Requirement by year \n($ million) \n \n\n Fiscal Year \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \nTotal \n\nAmount  \n262 \n315 \n367 \n472 \n577 \n682 \n786 \n891 \n577 \n315 \n            5,243 \n\n        \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSources: Project preparatory technical assistance consultants  \nestimates based on distribution companies\u2019 plans. \n\n \n2. \nThe  distribution  companies  (DISCOs)  plan  to  fund  40%  of  this  through  self-generated \nfunds  and  the  rest  through  borrowing  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other \nfinanciers (Table A4.2). The Government is actively looking for funding from the private sector \nand other agencies, but other financiers have not been confirmed. ADB\u2019s proposed multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF)  will  act  as  the  anchor  for  the  investment  plan.  Financing  of  the \nimmediate and urgent subprojects planned for tranches 1 and 2 will provide additional revenues \nfor  DISCOs  to  carry  out  further  system  enhancements.  The  investment  program  support \ncomponent, funded from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources, will assist DISCOs \nto structure the subprojects so they can attract investment from other sources. \n  \n\nTable A4.2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nSubprojects (OCR) \n\nShare \n 15% \n 46% \n\nProgram Support (ADF) \nAmount \n10.0 \n  0.0 \n\nShare \n80% \n  0% \n\n \nTotal Program  Amount\n  800 \nADB \n2,400 \nOther \nFinanciers \nDISCOs \nTotal \n\n2,043 \n5,243 \n\n 39% \n100% \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund, \nDISCO = distribution company, OCR ordinary capital resources. \nSource:Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n20% \n     100% \n\n  2.5 \n12.5 \n\n \n\nThe  immediate  priority  for  investment  in  the  distribution  systems  is  to  address  the \n3. \ncapacity  shortfalls  that  currently  result  in  regular  system  outages  and  supply  interruptions  to \ncustomers.  These  works  need  to  be  done  urgently  to  avoid  rapid  deterioration  of  power \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n39 \n\ntransformers which could result in prolonged outages and load shedding. Tranche-1 under the \nInvestment  Program  will  cover  these  identified  priorities  and  include  (i)  addition  of  circuit  and \ntransformer capacity to enable the already overloaded systems to deliver present demand and \nmeet the expected load growth reliably, (ii) loss reduction, and (iii) refurbishment of distribution \nnetworks.  The  benefits  to  be  delivered  from  the  subprojects  in  Tranche-1  include  addition  of \napproximately  2,200  megavolt-amperes  (MVA)  of  transformer  capacity,  improved  security  of \nsupply to customers by moving toward compliance with regulatory security standards governing \nplanning and operation of the distribution system, and improved reliability improvements on the \nlower voltages.  \n \n4. \nTable A4.3 shows the summary of cost estimates for Tranche-1 (detailed cost estimates \nare provided in Supplementary Appendix I.

The \nPakistan  Electric  Power  Company  (PEPCO)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Investment \nProgram,  with  each  distribution  company  (DISCO)  being \nImplementation  Agency \nresponsible for projects in its license area. PEPCO will be responsible for coordinating with each \nDISCO to obtain the required government approvals and submit the periodic financing requests \n(PFRs)  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Each  DISCO  will  be  responsible  for \nidentification, preparation, and implementation of its own projects.  \n \n2. \nPEPCO  is  a  government  holding  company  for  power  assets  and  is  not  structured  for \nproject  management  or  distribution  engineering  roles.  It  has  no  internal  capability  for \nimplementing distribution projects.  \n \n3. \nThe  Tranche-1  subprojects  have  been  identified  by  each  individual  DISCO  and  are \nsubstantively based on the Government Planning Commission applications previously made by \nthe  DISCOs.  An  international  consultant,  financed  by  an  ADB  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  (PPTA) 1 ,  has  compiled  the  DISCOs\u2019  subprojects  to  produce  Tranche-1  of  the \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF).  The  PPTA  consultant  has  developed  technical,  financial, \nand  economic  justification  and  ensured  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies  for  each \nsubproject.  \n \n4 \nIt is envisaged that Tranche-2 project preparation will be carried out by an international \nconsultant to be recruited using funds from TA Loan 21782. For preparation of tranches 3 and 4, \nif  applicable,  a  consultant  will  be  recruited  using  funds  from  the  investment  program  support \ncomponent.   \n\nthe \n\nFor  implementation  of  Tranche-1,  it  is  proposed  that  an  implementation  consultant  will \n5. \nbe  employed  by  PEPCO  under \ninvestment  program  support  component.  This \nimplementation  consultant,  an  international  consultant  based  in  Lahore,  will  coordinate  with \neach of the DISCOs through eight project management units (PMU) to be established by each \nDISCO  at  their  respective  DISCO  headquarters.  The  implementation  consultant  will  assist  the \nPMUs  in  procurement,  progress  reporting,  and  project  management;  and  assist  PEPCO  in \npreparing combined progress reports and being the communication point between the DISCOs \nand ADB. The implementation consultant will audit project performance in each DISCO. \n \n6. \nPEPCO will initiate advance procurement activities for the implementation consultant so \nthat  the  consultant  will  be  recruited  and  mobilized  within  3  months  of  the  effectiveness  of  the \nfirst tranche. The DISCOs will establish their respective PMUs shortly after mobilization of the \nimplementation  consultant.  Each  PMU  will  be  staffed  to  the  satisfaction  of  ADB  and  led  by  a \nsuitably qualified director. The PMUs will remain in operation for the duration of the Program.   \n \n7. \nFor  tranches  3  and  4,  an  implementation  consultant  will  continue  to  be  required  to \ncoordinate between the DISCOs and interface with ADB. A decision will be made based on the \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Preparing  the  Power  Distribution \nEnhancement Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila (TA 4876-PAK, approved on 27 November, for $900,000). \n2 ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Technical \nAssistance  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Infrastructure \nDevelopment. Manila (Loan 2178-PAK, approved on 18 August, for $17,163,000). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n43 \n\nexperience  during  Tranche-1  as  to  whether  a  national  or  international  consultant  will  be \nrecruited. This consultant will be funded using the investment program support component.  \n \n8. \nThe  eight  DISCOs  have  expertise  in  project  management  and  distribution  engineering, \nalbeit  to  varying  levels.  It  is  considered  that  subproject  implementation  is  generally  within  the \ntechnical  capability  of  all  DISCOs.  However,  capacity  may  be  insufficient,  particularly  during \nearly tranches, in areas such as project preparation, procurement, and project management of \nenvisaged  investments.  The  DISCOs\u2019  capacity  will  be  strengthened  by  use  of  a  capacity \nbuilding consultant and expanded by use of employment of engineering design consultants. \n   \n9. \nDISCO  capacity  will  be  developed  by  training  programs  in  modern  distribution  system \nplanning, utility management, and information communications and technology as needed. The \ninvestment  program  support  component  will  be  used  to  strengthen  DISCOs\u2019  (i)  planning, \n(ii) design, (iii) project management, (iv) operations, and (iv) maintenance capabilities. Bilateral \nexchange  programs  will  be  developed  with  foreign  power  companies  to  develop  role  models \namong current and potential managers. An institutional capacity building support project will be \ndeveloped  for  each  DISCO  based  on  its  individual  needs.  An  international  consultant,  to  be \nemployed by PEPCO, will identify each DISCO\u2019s needs and deliver a tailored program.   \n \n10. \nBecause  of  the  significant  volume  of  work,  DISCO  engineering  capacity  will  be \nexpanded  during  project  execution  by  recruitment  of  services  from  external  engineering \ncompanies.  To  this  end,  the  procurement  plan  proposes  recruiting  an  engineering  services \ncontractor for each DISCO. It is considered that sufficient domestic engineering capacity exists \nin Pakistan to meet this requirement.   \n \n11. \nBecause of the urgent nature of the subprojects, the Government and the DISCOs have \nrequested ADB\u2019s approval to carry out advance contracting for procurement of works and goods \nfor each tranche. ADB Management approval for advance contracting and retroactive financing \nof expenditures for the first and subsequent tranches will be sought. The Government and the \nDISCOs  have  been  informed  that  approval  of  advanced  contracting  and  retroactive  financing \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any of the proposed subprojects. It should also be noted that \nthe Government and the DISCOs must comply with all ADB procurement procedures in order to \nqualify for retroactive financing.

They took over the business assets and liabilities of the Water and Power \nDevelopment Authority (WAPDA). Their main activity is the distribution of electricity within their \nrespective  geographical  boundaries.  Shares  in  the  companies  are  held  by  the  Government  of \nPakistan  and  its  nominee  directors  through  the  Pakistan  Electric  Power  Company  (PEPCO). \nThis section addresses the general financial management assessment of the DISCOs; specifics \nfor each DISCO are contained in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n\nFinancial Management Assessment \n\nB. \n \n2. \nA financial management assessment was conducted to evaluate each DISCO\u2019s ability to \nundertake and fulfill the fiduciary requirements of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Financial \nmanagement  assessment  questionnaires,  financial  management  internal  control  and  risk \nassessments, and field interviews were used to review the standing of financial management at \nall  DISCOs.  Part  of  this  exercise  involved  the  assessment  of  country-specific  risks.  This  was \nundertaken by a review of previous analytical works.2   \n \n3. \nIn general, all DISCOs follow international practices. The articles of association for each \nDISCO specify that the board of directors comprise at least seven members, each appointed for \na term of 3 years, and that board meetings are held every quarter. Members consist of a chief \nexecutive officer and individuals from the private sector as well as representatives from WAPDA \nand  PEPCO.  The  audit  committee  for  all  DISCOs  comprises  at  least  two  members  from  the \nboard  of  directors,  either  from  the  private  sector  or  WAPDA/PEPCO.  All  DISCOs  operate \naccording to a Book of Financial Powers that sets out the rules governing transactions.   \n \n4. \n\nThe results of the risk assessment are summarized in Table A7.1. \n\n                                                 \n1 Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (FESCO), Gujranwala Electric Power Company (GEPCO), Hyderabad Electric \nSupply  Company  (HESCO),  Islamabad  Electric  Supply  Company  (IESCO),  Lahore  Electric  Supply  Company \n(LESCO), Multan Electric Power Company  (MEPCO), Peshawar Electric Supply  Company (PESCO), and Quetta \nElectric Supply Company (QESCO). \n\n2 Review  of  ADB.  2000.

Capital  costs  were  derived  from  local  sources,  including  5%  physical \ncontingencies  with  the  exclusion  of  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  implementation  for \ncapital  cost  estimation.  Financial  viability  was  examined  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs \nand benefits of with- and without-investment scenarios.  \n \nB. \n  \n2. \nThe  subproject  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  were  calculated  for  three \ncomponents:  (i)  secondary  transmission  grid  (STG),  (ii)  distribution  of  power  (DOP),  and \n(iii) installation  of  capacitors.  These  subproject  FIRRs  were  aggregated  at  the  distribution \ncompany (DISCO) level and for the overall project.  \n \n3. \nFor  the  STG  component,  incremental  benefits  arise  from  the  increased  evacuation  of \npower  through  the  distribution  system  because  of  additional  transformer  capacity.  The \nincremental  demand  was  translated  into  incremental  sales  using  DISCO-specific  load  factors, \npower  factors,  and  projected  growth  in  demand.  The  distribution  margin,  using  the  National \nElectric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) methodology to fulfill the DISCO annual revenue \nrequirement, was used to convert the incremental energy into monetary terms. The \u201cfirst circuit \nout\u201d benefit arises as a result of investment in a second circuit with the ability to service demand \nin the event the first one fails. This was valued at the distribution margin on the assumption of a \n1% probability. The loss reduction benefit was valued at the power purchase price to reflect the \nneed for lower energy purchase to serve demand.  \n \n4. \nFor the analysis, projected demand growth rates of 6\u20138% per annum and load factors of \n55\u201362%  were  used,  depending  on  the  DISCO.  Power  purchase  price  rates  ranging  from \nPRs3.49 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to PRs3.86/kWh were used. Actual losses at both 132 kilovolts \n(kV)  and  11  kV  of  9.9\u201334.2%  were  used  to  determine  the  effective  tariff  and  the  distribution \nmargin, independent of generating capacity.  \n \nDOP  components  involve  the  extension  of  11  kV  distribution  networks  and  installing \n5. \nadditional  distribution  transformers  to  make  electricity  grid  connections  available  to  additional \ncustomers,  primarily  in  rural  areas.  FIRRs  were  developed  using  a  generic  model,  as  it  is  not \npossible  at  this  stage  to  identify  the  precise  locations  of  all  of  these  schemes.  The  generic \nmodel involves a 10-kilometer extension of the 11 kV line, connecting a remote village with the \nexisting 11 kV overhead line network. There are three distribution transformers connected to the \nline  (each  transformer  with  a  0.4  kV  network  connecting  10  new  customers)  so  30  new \ncustomers  will  be  connected.  Variations  on  this  scheme  will  depend  on  the  distance  from  the \nproposed customers\u2019 locations to the nearest existing 11 kV line, the number of customers to be \nconnected, and the collective demand in kilowatts (kW) of those customers. The FIRR assumed \nthat  30  new  customers  would  consume  2,000  kWh  of  electricity  annually.  This  incremental \nbenefit was valued at the average distribution margin after adjusting for losses for each DISCO. \nOperation and maintenance (O&M) expenses are likely to be quite high. Routine maintenance \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\ncosts were assumed to be small but the ongoing potential for system faults causing outages and \nrequiring repair was assumed to be costly.  \n \n6. \nThe installation of capacitors results in a higher power factor, resulting in the reduction of \ndistribution system losses. The model assumed 1 megawatt (MW) of demand being supplied at \na power factor of 0.85 and revised up to 0.95 using a capacitor. The reduction of the distribution \nlosses results in savings in power purchases, therefore the benefit was valued at the average \npurchase price. No allowance was assumed for incremental O&M cost of the capacitor as it is \nconsidered negligible.     \n \nC. \n \nThe  procedure  for  tariff  petition  and  methodology  used  in  the  tariff  determination  by \n7. \nNEPRA is as follows. DISCOs make a petition for revision of tariff to NEPRA. After receipt of the \napplication,  NEPRA  notifies  the  stakeholders  and  the  public  of  the  most  important  features  of \nthe  petition  through  publication  in  a  local  newspaper.  NEPRA  receives  comments  and \ninterventions  from  stakeholders  and  gives  DISCOs  a  chance  to  respond  before  making  its \ndetermination. The tariff becomes effective after a government notification in the official gazette. \nThis tariff will remain effective until the next petition by DISCOs, determination by NEPRA, and \nnotification by the Government. \n\nTariff Methodology    \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital  \n\n \n8. \nIn  the  last  determination  by  NEPRA,  the  tariff  was  based  on  the  power  purchase  price \n(dependent on the generation mix and fuel price), which is a pass-through cost to the customer \nand  adjusted  for  line  losses.  NEPRA  allowed  the  addition  of  a  distribution  margin,  which  was \nbased on an annual revenue requirement for O&M, administration, depreciation, income tax and \na return on assets, and net of other income. The return on assets was based on the regulatory \nasset base, comprising the average net fixed assets and capital work in progress, and reduced \nby  the  extent  of  deferred  credit  and  other  income.  The  rate  of  return  was  based  on  NEPRA\u2019s \nassessment of each DISCO\u2019s weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The cost of debt was \nbased  on  the  actual  cost  of  existing  borrowings.  The  rationale  of  determination  of  the  cost  of \nequity has not been stated, while the actual debt-to-equity ratios for each DISCO were used.  \n \nD. \n \n9. \nFor  estimating  the  WACC,  it  is  assumed  that  ADB  will  finance  74%  of  overall  project \ncosts through Tranche-1. It is expected that the Government will relend the funds to DISCOs in \nPakistan  rupees  with  the  same  duration,  at  about  13%  per  annum  on  an  ad  hoc  basis \n(substantially lower than 17% per  annum, as  stated in the 1996 government circular). Foreign \nexchange risk will not be borne by DISCOs. The balance will be financed through self-generated \nfunds (equity). Fifteen percent is assumed for nominal cost under equity contribution, consistent \nwith  the  rate  of  return  allowed  for  DISCOs.  Domestic  inflation  is  assumed  to  be  7.5%  per \nannum. The WACC is estimated at 10% (Table A8.1). Tax benefits on interest were not taken \ninto account since DISCOs currently do not pay taxes.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n55 \n\nTable A8.1: Combined Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n\nADB \nLoan \n\n     242 \n\nADB  \nGrant \n\nInternally Generated \nFunds \n\n                              75  \n\n  \nTranche 1 Combined \nAmount ($ million) \nWeighting \nNominal Cost \nTax Rate \nTax-Adjusted Nominal Cost \nInflation Rate \nReal Cost \nWeighted Component of WACC \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital (Real) \n\n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n74.0% \n13.0% \n0.0% \n13.0% \n1.2% \n11.7% \n8.6% \n10.2% \n\n                 10  \n                   3.1% \n                   0.0% \n                   0.0% \n                  0.0% \n                   1.2% \n                  (1.2%) \n                   0.0% \n  \n\n  \n\n23.0% \n15.0% \n0.0% \n15.0% \n7.5% \n7.0% \n1.6% \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = weighted average cost of capital, MFF = multitranche financing facility. \nNote: 7.5% is the average of domestic cost escalation forecasts by ADB for 2006\u20132010. \nSources: ADB and project preparatory technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nThe overall Tranche-1 project FIRR is calculated at 19% (Table A8.2).

There  is  little  risk  of  downward \nrevision of the tariff. Delays in tariff filing by DISCOs, tariff determination by NEPRA, and tariff \nnotification  by  the  Government  pose  some  risks,  which  could  be  eliminated  with  prudent  time \nmanagement by each party concerned. The tariff determined by NEPRA is never fully recovered \nfrom customers by DISCOs because of a lower government mandated tariff. The difference is \nreimbursed by the Government through a subsidy payment, but it is often not on a regular basis, \nplacing the DISCOs in cash flow difficulties. This poses risks to the Project that are outside the \nDISCOs\u2019 direct control. The Government has taken measures to pay subsidy liabilities to each \nDISCO  on  time.  The  fundamental  structure  of  fund  flow  that  allows  DISCOs  direct  control  of \ncustomer  collections  instead  of  remittances  through  the  Water  and  Power  Development \nAuthority (WAPDA) is in the process of reform.   \n \n13. \nGeopolitical and political risks are present as for all projects in Pakistan. The number of \ninvestments  and  their  geographical  spread  lessen  the  risk  of  a  significant  number  of  projects \nbeing disabled to make Tranche-1 unsustainable. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n57 \n\nSUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nThe  proposed  Power  Distribution  Enhancement  Investment  Program  (Investment \n1. \nProgram)  subprojects  to  be  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  are  part  of \nPakistan\u2019s  integrated  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  sector  investment  plans.  The \nsubprojects  are  an  integral  component  of  the  distribution  sector1 development  road  map  and \nexpansion  program  prepared,  based  on  the  National  Transmission  and  Despatch  Company \n(NTDC) load forecast using least-cost planning principles. The economic analysis is based on a \ntime-slice  approach  to  the  distribution  sector  investment  plans  for  the  distribution  companies \n(DISCOs), since individual subprojects are not stand-alone investments and in some instances \nwould  not  yield  all  their  benefits  if  they  were  considered  in  isolation.  The  economic  analysis \nconfirms  that  the  Investment  Program  will  ease  chronic  electricity  supply  shortages  in  the \ncountry and help meet projected growth in demand for electricity. Demand forecasts and cost-\nbenefit  projections  were  prepared  and  analyzed,  and  they  indicated  that  the  Investment \nProgram is economically viable. \n \nB.  \n\nAssumptions \n\nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) compares the annual streams of economic \n2. \ncapital and operating costs against benefits based on willingness-to-pay. All costs, benefits, and \nrevenues  are  expressed  in  July  2007  prices.  A  discount  rate  of  12%  has  been  used  for \ncalculating  the  net  present  value.  The  analysis  period  includes  the  construction  period  and \n30 years  of  operation.  Details  of  the  assumptions  and  calculations  used  for  the  economic \nanalysis are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nC. \n\nDemand Analysis \n\n3. \nThe nationwide electricity demand is projected to grow at 7.9% during 2006\u20132010 and to \nincrease from 15,500 megawatts (MW) in FY2006 to 21,500 MW in FY 2010 (Table A9.1). To \ncope with the growth in electricity demand, it is estimated that Pakistan would require about an \nadditional 2,000 MW of newly installed capacity annually. The additional generated power would \nneed to be evacuated through the transmission system and brought to the customers through \nthe distribution networks, which would require corresponding increases in capacity.  \n \n\nTable A9.1: Physical Targets: Power Sector \n\nItem \n\n \n\n \n\nBenchmark \nFY2005 \n\nFY2006 \n\nFY2007 \n\nFY2009 \n\nFY2010 \n\nTargets \nFY2008 \n\nTotal \nACGR \n\n(%) \n\n(%) \n\nMW \n\nGWh  \n\n21,426 \n\n21,426 \n\n19,534 \n\n15,511 \n\n14,621 \n\n16,526 \n\n87,992 \n\n93,257 \n\n99,247 \n\n17,904 \n\n       6.5 \n\n       6.1 \n\n       3.4 \n\n       8.3 \n\n       3.2 \n\n       9.1 \n\nMaximum \nDemand \n     Growth Rate \nAnnual Energy \nGeneration \n     Growth Rate \nAnnual Energy \nSales \n     Growth Rate \n      8.2 \nFY = fiscal year, GWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt, ACGR = annual compound growth rate.  \nSource: Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan. \n                                                 \n1  The  distribution  networks  (excluding  the  Karachi  area)  are  now  managed  by  eight  independent  distribution \ncompanies (DISCOs).

The \n4. \nlatest forecast, covering FY2005 to FY2025, was prepared using a regression-based approach. \nHistorical data suggest that from 1995 to 2005 system demand grew at 3.1% per year, but for \nthe  second  half  of  this  period  (2000\u20132005)  the  growth  rate  increased  to  5.6%  annually.  In \nFY2005, actual demand increased by 7.4%. The relatively low growth rates experienced during \nthe late 1990s gave rise to a degree of complacency and new system additions were not made. \nThis  period  also  saw  some  reduction  in  maintenance  budgets,  all  of  which  resulted  in \ndistribution systems that are now unable to meet the demand for electricity. The high economic \ngrowth rates of recent years have necessitated plans for accelerated and large investments in \nthe power sector. For the least-cost analysis, NTDC\u2019s base case demand and energy forecast \nwere  considered.  The  forecasts  result  in  an  average  load  growth  of  8%  per  year  over  the  20-\nyear period.  \n \n5. \nPower  distribution  level  load  forecasts  assume  average  annual  load  growth  rate  of  7% \nfor 2005\u20132010, 9% for 2010\u20132015, 7% for 2015\u20132020, and 8% for 2020\u20132025. The forecast is \nsummarized  in  Table  A9.2.  Load  forecast  prepared  by  the  DISCOs  over  2007\u20132010  was  also \nreviewed,  and  forecasts  prepared  for  each  DISCO  to  2025,  based  on  individual  historic  load \ngrowth over 2000\u20132006, and compared with the NTDC forecast. On the basis of this review, the \nNTDC  top-down  forecast  was  accepted  as  a  reasonable  basis  to  plan  future  investments  and \nassess the economic viability of the overall Investment Program and Tranche-1 investment. \n \n\nTable A9.2: Energy Demand for Distribution Companies (MW) \n \n\nFESCO  GEPCO  HESCO \n1,183 \n1,259 \n1,347 \n1,449 \n1,571 \n1,713 \n1,869 \n2,052 \n2,250 \n2,444 \n2,646 \n2,844 \n3,049 \n3,270 \n3,504 \n3,764 \n4,051 \n4,372 \n4,729 \n5,125 \n5,559 \n\n1,159 \n1,233 \n1,319 \n1,420 \n1,539 \n1,678 \n1,830 \n2,010 \n2,203 \n2,394 \n2,591 \n2,786 \n2,986 \n3,202 \n3,431 \n3,687 \n3,968 \n4,281 \n4,632 \n5,019 \n5,444 \n\n1,708 \n1,817 \n1,944 \n2,092 \n2,268 \n2,473 \n2,697 \n2,962 \n3,247 \n3,528 \n3,818 \n4,105 \n4,400 \n4,719 \n5,057 \n5,433 \n5,847 \n6,310 \n6,825 \n7,397 \n8,023 \n\nIESCO \n1,220 \n1,298 \n1,389 \n1,494 \n1,620 \n1,766 \n1,926 \n2,116 \n2,319 \n2,520 \n2,727 \n2,932 \n3,143 \n3,371 \n3,612 \n3,881 \n4,177 \n4,507 \n4,875 \n5,283 \n5,731 \n\nLESCO  MEPCO \n1,806 \n1,920 \n2,055 \n2,211 \n2,398 \n2,614 \n2,851 \n3,131 \n3,433 \n3,730 \n4,037 \n4,340 \n4,652 \n4,989 \n5,346 \n5,744 \n6,182 \n6,670 \n7,215 \n7,820 \n8,481 \n\n2,684 \n2,855 \n3,055 \n3,287 \n3,564 \n3,886 \n4,238 \n4,655 \n5,103 \n5,544 \n6,000 \n6,451 \n6,915 \n7,415 \n7,946 \n8,538 \n9,189 \n9,915 \n10,726 \n11,624 \n12,607 \n\nPESCO  QESCO \n671 \n714 \n764 \n822 \n891 \n971 \n1,059 \n1,164 \n1,276 \n1,386 \n1,500 \n1,613 \n1,729 \n1,854 \n1,987 \n2,134 \n2,297 \n2,479 \n2,681 \n2,906 \n3,152 \n\n1,769 \n1,881 \n2,013 \n2,167 \n2,349 \n2,561 \n2,793 \n3,068 \n3,363 \n3,654 \n3,955 \n4,252 \n4,558 \n4,887 \n5,237 \n5,627 \n6,056 \n6,535 \n7,069 \n7,661 \n8,309 \n\nTotal \n12,200 \n12,977 \n13,886 \n14,942 \n16,200 \n17,662 \n19,263 \n21,158 \n23,194 \n25,200 \n27,274 \n29,323 \n31,432 \n33,707 \n36,120 \n38,808 \n41,767 \n45,069 \n48,752 \n52,835 \n57,306 \n\nFESCO  =  Faisalabad  Electric  Supply  Company,  FY  =  fiscal  year,  GEPCO  =  Gujranwala  Electric  Power  Company,  HESCO  = \nHyderabad Electric Supply Company, IESCO = Islamabad Electric Supply Company, LESCO = Lahore Electric Supply Company, \nMEPCO  =  Multan  Electric  Power  Company,  PESCO  =  Peshawar  Electric  Supply  Company,  QESCO  =  Quetta  Electric  Supply \nCompany. \nSource: Power System Statistics, National Transmission and Despatch Company. \n \n\nFY \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n59 \n\nThe  Government  of  Pakistan  (the  Government)  has  embarked  on  an  ambitious  village \n6. \nelectrification program as part of its poverty reduction policy. The number of villages electrified \nhas increased sharply in the last few years\u2014from 68,292 in 2000 to 103,231 in 2006\u2014adding \nan estimated demand of about 3,500 MW. Rural electrification needs new grid substations to be \nbuilt and therefore requires expansion of the secondary and primary distribution systems. It also \nadds to the primary transmission load transfer requirements. \n \n7. \nThe power distribution system is stretched and this is expected to continue in the near \nfuture. Without intervention, system performance is expected to deteriorate further. The supply-\ndemand balance analysis based on the medium-term NTDC forecast shows that, even when all \nongoing and committed projects are included, the distribution system will continue to experience \ncapacity shortfalls in the near future. The system is unable to meet the demand. The maximum \ndemand  (at  NTDC  network)  recorded  in  2006  is  13,066  MW,  compared  with  an  installed \ncapacity  of  17,395  MW  in  2006  (which  can  deliver  the  peak  demand  without  any  spinning  or \nother  reserves).  Likewise,  the  power  distribution  systems  are  not  able  to  meet  maximum \ndemand.  \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\n8. \nInvestments at the power distribution system level are based on immediate needs where \ntransformers are being augmented and replaced because of existing transformers approaching \n100%  capacity.  Given  rapid  load  growth,  it  is  not  expected  that  these  investments  will  be \ndemonstrated as suboptimal in the future. At an individual feeder level, load flow analyses are \nundertaken  to  support  system  improvement  investment  decisions  and  to  select  the  least-cost \noptions. While these investments are not analyzed in the context of the overall DISCO network, \nthe additions can be said to be least cost in the immediate area being examined.  Given rapid \ndemand growth, it is unlikely that these investments will become suboptimal in the future.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCost-Benefit Analysis \n\nThe  EIRR  calculation  was  based  on  incremental  cost  and  benefit  streams  associated \n9. \nwith each tranche of investment. Economic performance was evaluated by comparing with- and \nwithout-project scenarios. Incremental consumption occurs because of the extended availability \nof grid-sourced electricity. Economic benefits accrue to customers and the economy as a result \nof the investments.  \n \n10. \nThe  main  benefits  stem  from  (i)  allowing  for  system  expansion  to  meet  load  growth; \n(ii) improving  efficiency,  reliability,  and  system  security;  and  (iii)  reducing  losses.  The  physical \noutput\u2014rehabilitated, augmented, and expanded distribution infrastructure\u2014will add to existing \nsupply  (incremental  benefit)  and  will  be  substitute  for  alternative  forms  of  energy  supply.  The \nincremental benefits were valued for each category of customer, using customers\u2019 willingness-\nto-pay for electricity. \n \n\n3. \n\nCalculation of Willingness-to-Pay \n\n11. \nThe  value  of  each  unit  of  electricity  to  customers  was  estimated  by  comparing  current \nprices  against  the  price  of  alternative  sources  of  electricity.  Particular  customer  classes  were \nassumed to be willing to pay the difference between the present cost for an alternative source of \nelectricity  and  the  amount  charged  for  incremental  grid-supplied  units.  This  was  used  as  the \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nbasis  for  the  willingness-to-pay  calculation.  The  analysis  identified  four  classes  of  electricity \ncustomer: agricultural, residential, commercial, and industrial. The focus is on the main energy \nuse  (and  the  alternative  source),  rather  than  on  the  full  range  of  appliances  used  by  the \ncustomer  category  to  calculate  the  real  value  for  lost  load.  Analysis  was  based  on  three \nscenarios for oil price: $30, $60, and $80 per barrel. Table A9.3 shows the willingness-to-pay for \neach customer category. \n\n \nTable A9.3: Willingness-to-pay Estimates (WTP) a \n \n\nSector \n\nResidential \nAgricultural \nCommercial \nIndustrial \nWeighted average \nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \na Assuming $30/barrel. \nSource: Consultant estimates. \n\n4. \n\nResults  \n\n \n\nWTP (PRs/kWh) \n\n9.30 \n6.37 \n6.71 \n5.88 \n7.67 \n\na. \n\nSector Investment Plan \n\n12. \nThe economic cost-benefit analysis results in an EIRR of 23% for the overall $5.2 billion \npower  distribution  sector  investment  plan.  The  net  benefits  are  estimated  to  be  $2.2  billion  at \nwillingness-to-pay  low  scenario  of  $30  per  barrel  (Table  A9.4).  The  sensitivity  analyses  show \nthat the Investment Program remains justified even if various risks materialize. Tranches 3 and \n4  are  sensitive  to  reductions  in  demand,  but  this  is  considered  a  relatively  small  risk  given \nPakistan\u2019s long history of unmet demand.  \n \n\nTable A9.4: Summary of EIRR Calculations for the Sector Investment Plan \n \n2011\n\n2008\n\n2018\n\n2009\n\n2016\n\n2010\n\n2013\n\n2017\n\n2014\n\n2012\n\n2015\n\n2038 NPV\n\n0\n0\n\n      \n      \n\n463\n463\n\n   \n   \n\n1,079\n1,079\n\n   \n   \n\n1,760\n1,760\n\n   \n   \n\n2,506\n2,506\n\n   \n   \n\n3,389\n3,389\n\n   \n   \n\n4,338\n4,338\n\n   \n   \n\n5,273\n5,273\n\n   \n   \n\n6,240\n6,240\n\n   \n   \n\n7,195\n7,195\n\n   \n   \n\n8,178\n8,178\n\n   \n   \n\n9,238\n9,238\n\n \n35,658\n\nItem\n\n1.

The  poverty  reducing  impact  of  the \nProject  has  been  identified  by  evaluating  the  expected  distribution  of  net  benefits  to  different \ngroups  benefiting  from  implementation  of  the  Project.  Poverty  impact  ratios  have  been \ncalculated for each DISCO, varying from 10.62% in Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO) \nto  22.29%  in  Quetta  Electric  Supply  Company  (QESCO).  Benefits  to  the  poor  will  accrue  via \nconsumer surplus to the poor (customers that consume less than 50 kilowatt-hours [KWh] per \nmonth, equal to the percentage of lifeline consumers in each DISCO). \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n62 \n \n \n\nSUMMARY SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS \n\nBackground \n\nA. \n \nThe  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  has  requested  an  $810  million  multitranche  financing \n1. \nfacility  (MFF)  (the  Facility)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  undertake  the  Power \nDistribution  Enhancement  Program.  The  Facility,  with  the  Pakistan  Electric  Power  Company \n(PEPCO) as executing agency (EA) and eight regional power distribution companies (DISCOs) \nas  implementing  agencies  (IA)  will  target  all  Pakistan provinces. The Facility includes a minimum of \nthree  tranches  providing  funding  for  the  construction  and  improvement  of  secondary  transmission \nfacilities  (including  substations  and  secondary  transmission  lines)  and  distribution  facilities \n(including distribution lines). New substation and transmission line construction may cause land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts of small magnitude. LAR for substations is expected \nto adopt mechanisms not requiring the application of the right of eminent domain and thus not \ntriggering ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). New transmission lines, however, are \nexpected  to  require  the  application  of  the  right  of  eminent  domain  and  the  ADB  resettlement \npolicy  to  project  preparation  and  implementation.  Finally,  the  distribution  lines  will  not  cause \nLAR effects or impacts on incomes.  \n \n2. \nProject  appraisal  of  Tranche-1  includes  eight  core  subprojects  relating  to  the \nconstruction of new secondary transmission lines and two substations. Two of these subprojects \ninvolve  voluntary  land  acquisition  because  of  substation  construction,  and  seven  will  cause \nminor  livelihood  impacts  caused  by  transmission  line  construction.  No  subproject  requires \ninvoluntary resettlement or causes impacts on indigenous peoples.  \n  \nB. \n \n3. \nLAR will follow Pakistan law and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and Operations \nManual  F2  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (2003).  The  MFF  and  each  tranche  appraisal  and  the \napproval/implementation of each subproject with LAR or indigenous peoples issues will require \nthe preparation of the following documents:  \n\nGeneral Procedures \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\na  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  and  an  indigenous \npeoples  development  framework  (IPDF)  for  the  whole  MFF  to  be  reviewed, \nupdated,  and  reapproved  by  ADB  annually  and  before  the  preparation  of  each \ntranche; \n\nan  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  indicating  whether  LAR  or  indigenous \npeoples  impacts  are  expected,  and  if  so,  their  type  and  magnitude  for  each \ntranche and;  \n\na  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  with  detailed  design/impact \nfigures  and  compensation  budgets  and  schedules  for  each  project  with  LAR \ntriggering  the  principle  of  eminent  domain  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy;1 \n\n                                                 \n\n1   As  noted  in  ADB.  1998.  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice.  Manila,  the  complexity  of  a \nresettlement  plan  depends  on  the  severity  of  impacts.  If  impacts  are  severe  (>  200  affected  persons  resettled  or \nwith  >10%  income  losses),  a  subproject  is  classified  category  \u201cA\u201d  and  a  full  resettlement  plan  is  prepared.  If \nimpacts  are  non-severe  (<200  affected  persons  resettled  or  with  <10%  income  losses),  a  subproject  is  classified \ncategory \u201cB\u201d and only a short resettlement plan is prepared. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n63 \n\n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n \n\n \n\na LAR due diligence report (DDR) for each subproject with LAR but not triggering \nthe principle of eminent domain and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy; and  \n\nan  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  (IPDP)  for  each  project  affecting \nindigenous peoples.   \n\nThe appraisal of the MFF and of each tranche, and the approval/implementation of each \n\n \n4. \nsubproject under a tranche, will be in accordance with the following LAR-related conditions: \n \n\n(i)  MFF  and  tranche  1  appraisal:  preparation  of  LARF  and  IPDF  for  the  MFF,  and \nLARPs/DDRs and IPDPs for all tranche 1 projects with LAR and IP impacts.  \n\n(ii)  Appraisal  of  other  tranches:  LARF  and  IPDF  review/update  and  preparation  of \n\nLARP/DDR and IPDP for all tranche projects with LAR or IP impacts. \n\n(iii)  Start of subproject civil works: LARP and IPDP implementation. \n\nTo  comply  with  these  conditions,  PEPCO  has  prepared  a  LARF  and  an  IPDF  for  the \n5. \nwhole  MFF;  and  a  LARP  +  DDR  for  one  subproject,  six  short  LARPs  for  six  subprojects,  and \none DDR for one final subproject.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nImpacts  on  land  and  assets,  resettlement,  and  incomes  vary  according  to  the  type  of \ninfrastructure  built  under  The  Facility,  namely:  (i)  new  substations,  (ii)  secondary  transmission \nlines, and (iii) distribution lines.  \n\nExpected Project Impacts \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nSubstations. For new grid substations, land acquisition may be needed. If this is \nthe case, land will be acquired based on various modalities which in some cases \nmay  trigger  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and  the  right  of  eminent \ndomain (paras. 7\u201310). \n\nSecondary transmission/distribution lines (33 kilovolts [kV] and above). For \nlines  above  33  kV,  land  acquisition  is  needed  when  towers  permanently  affect \nland. For urban/rural residential-commercial land, this will always be the case; for \nrural/agricultural land, this will be so if access/cultivation under a new tower is no \nlonger  possible.  Towers  and  transmission  lines  construction  may  require  the \nacquisition of houses and the rehabilitation for income losses caused by impacts \non businesses, crops, or tree losses. \n\nDistribution lines (up to 11 kV). For lines up to 11kV, land will not be acquired \nas these are small lines built on small poles/supports that are sited in public land \nalong  roadsides  before  entering  the  plot  of  the  final  beneficiary  who  requested \nthe line extension and normally pays for it. To ensure that this is always the case, \nthe  Loan  Agreement  includes  a covenant  stating  that  distribution  lines  requiring \nland  acquisition  or  affecting  land  under  private  use  are  not  eligible  under  the \nFacility. \n\n \nApplicability of ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n\nD. \n \n7. \nthe different land acquisition modes available under the Facility. These include: \n\nThe LARF defines the applicability of ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy relative to \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n64 \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nvoluntary  provision  (donations)  of  unoccupied  land  for  the  installation  of  a \nstation by the community/interest requesting connection to the power grid, such \nas housing development schemes or industrial estates; \n\nacquisition  of  unoccupied  government  owned  land  against  a  negotiated \nprice; \n\nfree  purchase  of  unoccupied  land  from  a  willing  seller  at  a  negotiated  price; \nand \n\ninvoluntary  land  acquisition  under  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894  (amended), \nthrough  the  Provincial  Board  of  Revenue  and/or  district\u2019s  land  acquisition \ncollector concerned. This is always the last option, when all the previous options \nare  unfeasible,  as  this  option  often  involves  (a)  adverse  impacts  on  affected \npersons/families  and  communities,  (b)  high  costs,  (c)  lengthy  procedures,  and \n(d) processing delays. \n\n \n\n8. \nThe  above  modes  1,  2,  and  3  are  adopted  for  facilities  that  do  not  imply  the  right  of \neminent  domain  nor  trigger  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  These  facilities  are  grid \nsubstations that do not need a specific construction location. Mode 4, on the contrary, implies \nthe  possibility  of  land  expropriation  and  is  fully  subjected  to  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy, including the preparation/implementation of LARPs as required \nby  the  ADB  policy.  Mode  4  may  be  the  only  viable  option  for  the  acquisition  of  land  for  a \nsubstation to be located in one specific place, or for a distribution line. \n \n9. \nBased on the above, ADB will approve the selection of projects with land acquired under \nmodes 1, 2, and 3 without the preparation of a LARP and based only on a land acquisition due-\ndiligence document, clearly documenting:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nidentity and legitimate property (title) of the previous owner;  \nmarket value of plot and proof of purchase with amount value paid for it;  \nthe fully voluntary nature of the sale or donation through signatures, and  \nthat the acquired plot is not rented, encroached, encumbered, or with liens. \n\n \n10. \nFor subprojects with LAR to be carried out under mode 4 or even under the other modes \nif the plots are rented out or occupied by encroachers, ADB will approve implementation only if \na  LARP  as  defined  below  is  prepared  and  fully  carried  out  before  the  implementation  of  the \nsubproject.  \n  \nE. \n \n\nLARP Preparation and Implementation \n\n1. \n\nPolicy Provisions, Eligibility, and Entitlements \n\nThe  LARF  lists  the  following  principles:  (i)  LAR  will  be  avoided  or  at  least  minimized, \n11. \n(ii) compensation  will  guarantee  the  maintenance  of  affected  persons\u2019  pre-project  living \nstandards,  (iii)  affected  persons  will  be  fully  informed/consulted  on  compensation  options, \n(iv) affected  persons\u2019  sociocultural  institutions  will  be  supported  and  used,  (v)  LAR  provisions \nwill  equally  apply  to  women  and  men,  (vi)  lack  of  formal  title  will  not  be  a  bar  to \ncompensation/rehabilitation, (vii) particular attention will be paid to women-headed households \nand  vulnerable  groups,  (viii)  LAR  will  be  conceived  and  executed  as  an  integral  part  of  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n65 \n\n \n \n\nsubprojects  and  LAR  budgets  will  be  included  in  project  costs,  and  (ix)  compensation  will  be \nfully provided before impacts occur. The LARF also covers all LAR implementation issues and \nsets the following eligibility/entitlement provisions described in Table A10.  \n \nInstitutional  Responsibilities.  The  DISCOs  as  IAs  will  have  direct  responsibility  for \n12. \nLARP preparation, implementation and financing of LAR tasks, and cross-agency coordination. \nWithin  the  DISCOs,  all  day-to-day  LAR  tasks  will  be  managed  by  a  Social  Development  Cell, \nwhich  will  organize  and  monitor  LARP  preparation/implementation  internally  (including  surveys, \nasset  valuation,  public  consultation);  cross-agency  coordination;  and  LARP  approval.  The  cell \nwill be assisted by (i) a resettlement/social development team under the supervision consultants, \n(ii)  a  local  nongovernment  organization,  and  (iii)  an  independent  agency  hired  to  conduct \nexternal monitoring and evaluation of LAR activities.  \n \n13. \nDistrict governments have jurisdiction of land administration, valuation, and acquisition. \nAt province level, these functions rest on the Board of Revenue; at district level, they rest on the \nDistrict  Revenue  Office  and  land  acquisition  collectors.  Minor  agents  as  the  Patwaris  (land \nrecords  keeper)  execute  specific  tasks,  such  as  title  identification  or  verification.  The \ncompensation of non-land assets (i.e., buildings and crops) or income rehabilitation also falls on \nlocal governments, specifically on the relevant district department. \n\nTable A10: Compensation Eligibility and Entitlements Matrix \n\nAsset \n\nSpecification \n\nAffected Persons \n\nCompensation Entitlements \n\nLand  \npermanently \nacquired for \nsubstation \n\n1.

A  land  acquisition  collector  will  be \ndirectly  assigned  to  each  DISCO  and  three  coordination/consultation  committees  will  be \nestablished at different levels of the LAR process2 as follows:  \n \n\n(i)  A provincial LAR steering committee gathering executives of the relevant DISCO, \ndirectors of the local Planning and Development Department, Board of Revenue, \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA), and project director. The LAR steering \nformation  of  advisory \ncommittee  will  meet  periodically \ncommittees in relevant districts, and facilitate LARP approval and implementation \nprocesses.  \n\nto  ensure \n\ntimely \n\n(ii)  A LAR coordination committee at district level to coordinate the preparation and \n(surveys,  asset  valuation,  affected  persons \nimplementation  of  LARPs \nconsultation,  and  local  approval  of  LARP  provisions).  The  LAR  coordination \ncommittee will be initiated by the relevant DISCO and include representatives of \nSocial  Development  Cell  (SDC),  District  Officer  Revenue  (DOR),  and  union \ncouncils.  \n\n(iii) A grievance redressal committee to include a representative of the DISCO, SDC, \nunion  council,  consultant  resettlement  specialist,  and  a  local  nongovernment \norganization. The Grievance Redress Committee (GRC) will be organized at the \nstart of project implementation by the district Nazim\u2019s office on the request of the \nDISCO,  and  will  be  triggered  by  grievances  at  district  level.  The  committee  will \nhear complaints; if they are found to be justified, it will support filing them with the \nDISCO. \n\n \n15. \nADB  clearance  of  category  B  LARPs  and  category  C  (no  impacts:  involuntary \nresettlement  &  indigenous  peoples  categorization  forms)  subprojects  will  be  provided  by  an \nADB  resettlement  specialist  at  the  Pakistan  Resident  Mission,  or  by  a  third  party  organization \nwith LAR capacity chosen by ADB. Category A projects will be cleared at ADB Headquarters.  \n \n16. \nDisclosure/Public  Consultation.  LARP  tasks  will  need  intense  consultation  with \naffected  persons.  As  an  appraisal  condition,  LARF  and  relevant  LARPs  in  English  will  be \ndisclosed on the ADB website while LARF and LARPs in local language will be disclosed in the \naffected communities. \n \n17. \nGrievance  Procedures.  Affected  persons  will  first  lodge  complaints  with  the  land \nacquisition collector. If settlement is not reached within 2 weeks, the complaint is then lodged to \nthe  project  management  unit  (PMU).  If  the  grievance  is  not  settled  within  a  further  2  weeks, \naffected  persons  can  seek  redress  at  the  appropriate  court.  The  GRC,  composed  of  senior \nmembers  of  affected  communities  and  their  elected  representatives,  will  assist  the  affected \npersons in these cases.   \n\n \n\n18.  Monitoring and Evaluation. PMUs  will  monitor  LAR  implementation  internally.  The  EA \nwill report to ADB on a quarterly basis. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent \nagency and external monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB annually. At the end of project \nimplementation, the independent monitoring agency will carry out a general evaluation of LAR \nimplementation. \n                                                 \n2  The administration of tribal areas is radically different from that of settled districts, which has been assumed as model in \nthis LARF. For subprojects in tribal areas, the local government is represented by the political agent and his deputies; \nlocal  communities  are  represented  by  tribal  jirgas  (assembly  of  male  elders)  and/or  the  officially  recognized  Maliks \n(leader of a town or community). LARP for subprojects in tribal areas will be organized to fit local specificities. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n68 \n \n \n\n \n19. \nFinances  and  Schedules.  The  LARF  prescribes  that  each  LARP  will  detail  LAR \nbudgets  and  provide  clear  schedules  linking  LAR  tasks  with  the  initiation  of  civil  works.  LARP \nfinances will be provided by the relevant DISCO as a counterpart financing fund. \n \nF. \n \n20. \nOne subproject required the preparation of a short LARP with DDR; six needed a short \nLARP;  and  one  required  only  a  DDR.

This  subproject \nrequires the construction of a new 132 kV substation and a 270 meter-long 132 kV \ntransmission  line  linking  the  station  to  the  132  kV  Multan\u2013Bahawal  Nagar  line. \nSubstation  construction  requires  a  2.94  hectare  (ha)  plot  already  purchased  by \nMEPCO from one owner on a willing seller/buyer basis. The new transmission line \nrequires the construction of two towers affecting four families (54 affected persons), \n9,286  square  meters  of  crops,  and  five  trees.  No  LAR  is  needed.  The \ncompensation/rehabilitation  program  cost  is  $232,004.  To  document  these  minor \nimpacts and related compensation tasks, MEPCO has prepared a short LARP for \nthe transmission line and a DDR for the grid station, which is included in Appendix \n3 of the resettlement plan. \n\nFazilpur 132 kV transmission line (MEPCO). This subproject will link the existing \nFazilpur station with the Rajan Pur-DG Khan transmission line through a new 1.06 \nkilometer  (km)  132  kV  line.  This  will  require  the  construction  of  five  towers  and \ncause  the  loss  of  3.05  ha  of  crops  and  14  wood  trees  affecting  four  families  (47 \naffected  persons).  No  LAR  is  required.  The  total  compensation/rehabilitation \nprogram cost is $7,561. As this impact is less than significant, a short LARP has \nbeen prepared.  \n\nShahdan Lund 132 kV transmission line (MEPCO). This subproject will link the \nexisting  Shahdan  station  with  the  Kot  Adu-DG  Khan  line  through  a  new  2.95  km \n132 kV line requiring the construction of 13 towers. The subproject will cause the \nloss of 2.8 ha of crops from one affected family (14 affected persons). No tree is \naffected  or  LAR  needed.  The  total  compensation/rehabilitation  program  cost  is \n$17,173.  In  accordance  with  this  less  than  significant  impact,  a  short  LARP  has \nbeen prepared. \n\nFatehpur  132  kV  transmission  line  (Gujranwala  Electric  Power  Company \n[GEPCO]).  This  subproject  involves  the  construction  of  a  new  17.23  km  132  kV \nline.  This  requires  the  construction  of  63  towers,  will  cross  four  villages  and  will \naffect  a  total  of  45.76  ha  of  crops,  48  wood  trees,  and  54  families  (639  affected \npersons).

No  LAR  is  needed.  The  compensation/rehabilitation \nprogram cost is $70,168. Based on this less than significant impact, a short LARP \nhas been prepared. \n\n \n(viii) \n\n132 kV Sukh Chayn Gardens Grid station (Lahore Electric Supply Company \n[LESCO]).  This subproject entails the construction of a 132 kV substation at the \nSukh  Chayn  Gardens  Estate.  The  1.47  ha  plot  was  voluntarily  donated  by  the \nestate to allow electricity delivery to its premises. Based on the LARF provisions \nfor these cases, a DDR has been prepared to document the transaction details.  \n\nIndigenous Peoples Issues \n\n \nG. \n \nIndigenous  peoples  will  be  affected  only  by  projects  in  tribal  areas  of  the  North-West \n21. \nFrontier  Province  or  possibly  in  Baluchistan.  As  no  project  affecting  indigenous  peoples  is \nincluded in Tranche-1, no IPDP or specific indigenous peoples action has been prepared so far. \nHowever, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), PEPCO has drafted \nan  IPDF  detailing:  (i)  project  processing  conditions  related  to  indigenous  peoples,  (ii)  IPDP \npreparation/implementation  requirements,  (iii)  indigenous  peoples  definition  in  Pakistan, \n(iv) results of a general social assessment, (v) indigenous peoples strategy for the Program and \ntype of indigenous peoples action needed, (vi) IPDP participation instruments, and (vii) general \nprocessing and implementation. \n \n22. \nBased  on  IPDF  provisions  and  the  social  assessment  results,  it  is  assumed  that \nPakistan\u2019s  definition  of  \u201ctribal  peoples\u201d  fits  with  ADB\u2019s  classification  of  indigenous  peoples.  As \nsuch, \u201ctribal peoples\u201d will substitute indigenous peoples in the preparation of specific documents \nfor  the  Program.  Also  based  on  IPDF  provisions,  the  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment \nprepared  for  the  appraisal  of  each  tranche  will  include  an  indigenous  peoples  identification \nassessment  providing  (i)  general  information  on  projects  likely  to  affect  indigenous  peoples, \nrelative impact magnitude expected, and number/type of IPDP to be prepared; and (ii) an outline \nof  indigenous  peoples\u2019  groups  to  be  affected,  with  an  overview  of  their  demography,  social \norganization, livelihood/land tenure features, relations with government/other groups, adaptation \nto outside society/culture, and local governance.  \n \n23. \nas follows: \n\nBased on impacts magnitude/situation, the IPDF sets the action required for tribal people \n\n(i) \n\nIf  a  subproject  affects  tribal  peoples\u2019  groups  but  causes  impacts  (a)  limited  to \nstandard  LAR  with  no  broad  community  or  systemic  effect  requiring  the \nrehabilitation of an entire productive system, or (b) impacts without socioculturally \nsignificant  effects,  special  tribal  peoples  action  will  be  included  with  the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n70 \n \n \n\n \n(ii) \n\nindigenous peoples identification assessment and clear operational directions in \nthe LARP. It is expected that most of the subprojects affecting tribal peoples will \nrequire this type of action. \n\nIf a subproject affects tribal peoples\u2019 groups and causes (a) impacts with broad \ncommunity  or  systemic  effects  requiring  the  rehabilitation  of  a  whole  productive \nsystem,  or  (b)  impacts  that  are  socioculturally  significant,  a  stand-alone  IPDP \n(inclusive of a detailed action plan, schedule, and budget) will be prepared. The \nstand-alone  IPDP  will  not  only  cover  LAR  issues,  but  will  also  provide  a  broad \nrehabilitation plan. If land tenure is held collectively by whole communities, it may \ninclude  specific  compensation  provisions  for  direct  land  users  and  generalized \nprovisions for communal land property. \n\n \n24. \nInstitutional  Responsibilities.  As  the  IA,  each  DISCO  will  have  direct  IPDP \npreparation,  implementation,  and  financing  responsibility  and  cross-agency  coordination \nfunctions  in  its  licensed  area.  At  the  DISCO,  day-to-day  indigenous  peoples\u2019  tasks  will  be \nmanaged  by  the  Social  Development  Cell,  which  will  organize  and  internally  monitor  IPDP \npreparation/implementation  (surveys,  asset  valuation,  public  consultation).  In  implementing \nthese  tasks,  the  cell  will  be  assisted  by  (i)  the  resettlement/social  development  team  of  the \nsupervision  consultants;  (ii)  a  local  nongovernment  organization;  and  (iii)  an  independent \nagency  hired  externally  to  monitor  and  evaluate  IPDP  tasks.  The  DISCOs  will  coordinate  with \nstate  authorities  in  tribal  areas  and  with  indigenous  peoples\u2019  organizations,  and  will  carry  out \nactivities related to indigenous peoples in accordance with the administrative/political processes \nprevalent in tribal areas. DISCOs will execute these tasks together with political agents; through \nthem, they will make workable arrangements with relevant tribal leaders (maliks, sardars and/or \nkhans)  who  will  in  turn  consult  their  tribal  councils  (Jirgas)  and  communities  to  take  final \ndecisions  and  actions  related  to  implementation.  To  ensure  coordination  with  tribal  area \ngovernments, the political agents will be members of the steering committee in the North-West \nFrontier Province and Baluchistan and of the LAR coordination committees at district level. ADB \nclearance of category B LARP/IPDPs will be provided by a social development specialist hired \nat the Pakistan Resident Mission; category A projects (with stand-alone IPDPs) will be cleared \nat ADB headquarters.  \n \nComplaints  and  Grievances.  Complaints  from  affected  indigenous  peoples  will  be \n25. \naddressed  to  the  Political  Agent  Office  via  tribal  leaders  and  councils.  If  needed,  the  political \nagent will then call on the PMU or PEPCO headquarters to discuss, negotiate, and resolve the \nissues.  If  PEPCO,  the  political  agent,  and  the  tribal  leaders  cannot  find  mutually  agreeable \nsolutions to a grievance, the relevant subproject will not be implemented.  \n \n26. \ntasks  will  be \nplanned/executed based on intense public consultation. As an appraisal condition, the IPDF and \nIPDPs in English will be posted on the ADB website while the IPDF and IPDPs in local language \nwill be disclosed in project offices.   \n\nPublic  Consultation  and  Disclosure. \n\nIndigenous  peoples \n\n27.  Monitoring and Evaluation. PMUs will monitor IPDP implementation internally. The EA, \nsupported  by  implementation  consultants,  will  report  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  External \nmonitoring will be assigned to an independent agency by the EA and external monitoring reports \nwill be submitted to ADB annually. At the end of implementation of the Facility, the independent \nagency will carry out a general evaluation of IPDP implementation. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n71 \n\n \n \n\nFinances  and  Schedules. The IPDF prescribes that each stand-alone IPDP will detail \n28. \nbudgets  and  provide  clear  schedules  linking  LAR  tasks  with  the  initiation  of  civil  works.  IPDP \nfinances will be provided by the relevant DISCO as a counterpart financing fund. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n72 \n \n \n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title:  Pakistan/Power Distribution Enhancement Investment Program \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nMultitranche Financing Facility \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nCentral and West Asia Department/ \nInfrastructure Division \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nMajor interventions in the energy sector are designed to achieve economic progress through infrastructure development. Both \nphysical  investment  support  and  sector  reform  are  necessary  so  that  the  benefits  from  economic  growth  will  accrue  to  the \npoor.  \n\nBy strengthening and expanding distribution capacity, the proposed Investment Program is expected to result in quality and \nreliable  delivery  of  services  to  customers,  particularly  benefiting  commercial,  residential,  and  agricultural  customers  in \nPakistan.  \n\nPoor  and  vulnerable  customers,  including  social  utilities  such  as  hospitals  and  schools,  are  often  the  hardest  hit  by \ninadequate  power  supply,  load  shedding,  and  poor  power  quality.  They  will  benefit  directly  from  the  subprojects.  Direct \npositive economic and social benefits will result from the Investment Program.  \n\nA positive, direct impact on local labor is expected during implementation and an indirect impact will be due to the increased \nincome-earning opportunities generated by increased access to electricity and job opportunities during construction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nProject  preparatory  technical  assistance  consultants  have  prepared  a  social  impact  assessment  and  a  poverty  impact \nassessment. A socioeconomic survey was undertaken to provide a basis for the assessments. The primary objective of this \nstudy is to (i) assess whether the benefits of the Project will flow primarily to poor/nonpoor customers; (ii) design the poverty \nintervention  component  of  the  Project;  and  (iii)  identify  and  deal  effectively  with  any  social  risks  such  as  involuntary \nresettlement, gender, labor, affordability, including the need to prepare any mitigating measures or plans. \n\nMost poor people in Pakistan are  wage laborers or are self-employed. Over 40% of them live close to the poverty line; this \nindicates  that  shocks,  such  as  illness,  death,  or  drought,  have  the  potential  to  drive  large  numbers  into  poverty.  Most  are \nlandless and less likely to have access to a health clinic or to send their children to school than those with higher incomes. A \ndisruption of their daily routine makes them more vulnerable than other groups as they do not have the resources to insure \nagainst such disruptions. \n\nThe Investment Program is expected to create new full-time employment opportunities in civil works. Improved power supplies \nwill induce light industrial and commercial activity, creating employment and improving the productivity and quality of outputs \nin manufacturing and agriculture sectors.   \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Investment Program will benefit all grid-connected customers with adequate and reliable supply of electricity, which would \nsupport the projections for growth in energy demand and the Government\u2019s confirmed intent to make  affordable  grid-based \nelectricity  supplies  available  to  the  entire  population  through  the  village  electrification  program.  A  secure  and  predictable \nelectricity supply will enable social and economic benefits to materialize. Poor and vulnerable customers, including hospitals, \nschools, and other social utilities, are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality. \nThey will benefit directly from the investments. \n\nImprovements in the quality and reliability of supply that will accrue from targeted investments are expected to improve living \nconditions in the rural areas through the creation of job and income opportunities. Businesses as well as farmers are expected \nto  increase  their  productivity.  Demand  for  electric  installations,  supplies,  and  maintenance  is  expected  to  increase,  creating \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n73 \n\n \n \nfurther new job opportunities. In addition, a reliable electricity supply improves households\u2019 quality of life, especially for women \nwho are traditionally responsible for the activities inside the house. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nStakeholder analysis has been undertaken. All stakeholders have been actively involved in order to reduce the likelihood of \ngrievances and to ensure that benefits are distributed fairly. In addition, for the selection of unskilled labor in the project area, \nthe contractors will consult with local township labor officials, local village leaders, and jirgas (tribal assembly of elders); and \nwill ensure that labor is hired on a nondiscriminatory basis.   \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.
