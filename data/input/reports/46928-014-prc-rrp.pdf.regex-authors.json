I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nprogram of $275 million (or CNY equivalent) to up to five financial leasing companies (FLCs) for \nfinancing of clean buses 1 in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).2 \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Since 1990, the response by most cities in the PRC to rapid growth in urban population, \nincomes, and car ownership has been to invest massively in roads. This has not solved the \nproblem of heavy congestion in many cities because demand for road space has far outstripped \nsupply despite these large expansion programs. Rapid growth in motor vehicles has also made \nair pollution a major problem. The large, dense concentrations of motor vehicles and their \nemissions in relatively small areas have raised air pollution in many urban centers to levels \ncommonly  considered  harmful  to  human  health.  The  fine  particles  often  associated  with \nvehicular emissions can increase morbidity and premature mortality. As a result, the national \nand municipal governments have agreed that the development of public transport is needed to \navert a potential transport crisis in the PRC\u2019s urban areas. By encouraging urban residents to \nshift from the use of private cars to public transport, governments can alleviate congestion and \nair pollution, including the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that contribute to global \nclimate change. More and better public transport will also directly benefit the poor, who depend \nmore heavily than other income groups on public transport and often suffer from inadequate \nservices.  \n3.  Since 2006, the national and local governments have made the promotion of public \ntransport a strategic priority and have increased their efforts to providing flexible, low-cost, \nefficient bus transport. Many cities have set ambitious targets for replacing and adding to \nexisting bus fleets. Some provide generous subsidies to bus operators to partly offset the high \nupfront capital costs of new vehicles. Increasingly, local governments are also promoting clean \nbuses by building the compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) fueling \nstations and electric bus charging stations needed to run them and providing financial incentives \nto encourage the switch from high emission vehicles.  \n4.  This  expansion  of  clean  bus  transport  has  been  limited  by  significant  financing \nconstraints, however. Local bus operators typically have high debt\u2013asset ratios and, without the \ngovernment subsidies they receive, would operate at a loss.3 They are also subject to significant \nrefinancing risks because they rely on bank loans with terms of 1\u20133 years to finance bus \npurchases. Banks are also usually unwilling or unable to approve the large amounts of credit \nneeded to meet the operators\u2019 ambitious plans to add new buses and replace existing fleets.  \n5.  Financial leasing can be an effective way to supplement bank finance and address this \nfunding bottleneck. Leasing allows bus operators to tap additional financing that has longer \ntenors and potentially more competitive rates than bank loans. Leasing also allows a more \n                                                \n1  A clean bus is defined as a bus that meets the emission standards of Euro III equivalent and falls within at least \none of the following categories: (i) buses running on cleaner fuel such as compressed or liquefied natural gas, and \nbiomethane; (ii) \u2015energy-efficient and new-energy buses\u2016 as defined by the national government of the PRC \n(currently including hybrid buses with fuel-saving rates of more than 10%, battery-only electric buses, and fuel-cell \nelectric buses); and (iii) buses that meet the most advanced emission standards of Euro IV equivalent or above. \nEuro III and Euro IV are European emission standards that define the acceptable limits for exhaust emissions of \nvehicles. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  Bus fares in the PRC are regulated and typically set at very low levels (e.g., a cash fare of CNY1 per trip, with up to \n50% discount if an integrated circuit card is used). \n ", "2 \nefficient  use  of  funds.4 These  benefits  can  help  operators  improve  their  overall  financial \nperformance. For their part, financial leasing companies (FLCs) are being attracted to the bus \nindustry by the strong government support for public transport development. They are further \ncomforted by their ownership rights over the vehicles under lease. Due to strong demand from \nbus operators, many of the PRC\u2019s FLCs expect 2012\u20132017 to be a golden period for bus \nleasing and have made aggressive plans to expand into the market.  \n6.  The financial leasing industry in the PRC has grown exponentially in recent years. The \ntotal value of new lease contracts increased from $0.9 billion in 2001 to $63.7 billion in 2010. \nDespite this rapid growth, the industry is still in a relatively early stage of development. Market \npenetration was only 3.8% in 2010, compared with an average rate of 13.8% in the world's 10 \nother largest financial leasing markets. To sustain its rapid growth and fulfill its potential to \nbecome the second most important source of financing in the PRC after bank credit, financial \nleasing, which is a capital intensive industry but lacks a deposit base, will need access to long-\nterm funding. Many FLCs are constrained by their limited access to the capital markets and to \nlong-term bank loans. This results in serious mismatches between the maturities of their assets \nand their liabilities.5 \n7.  The program will offer long-term funding to up to five FLCs to support the leasing of \nbuses running on cleaner fuel, hybrid buses with fuel-saving rates of more than 10%, electric \nbuses, and conventional buses that meet the most advanced emission standard.6 The program \nwill also fund information technology (IT) systems that increase the fleet operating efficiency of \nurban, suburban, and intercity bus services.  \n8.

ADB will assess the funding needs of each participating FLC borrower and tailor each \nloan  to  the  company\u2019s  individual  circumstances.  By  providing  long-term  funding  that  is \nearmarked for financing the leases of clean buses, ADB will help promote a shift from private to \npublic transport in the PRC. The funding will also mitigate the participant FLCs\u2019 risks of maturity \nmismatches  and  will  diversify  their  sources  of  funding.  The  program  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first \nnonsovereign loan program to support sustainable transport in the PRC. \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n11.

This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n14.  National statistics also show a high demand for clean buses. As of December 2011, \n152,000 CNG and LNG buses were operating in the PRC, more than one-third of the total \nnumber worldwide.7 According to data compiled by an industry research center,8 5,541 CNG \nbuses were sold in the PRC in 2011. In January\u2013June 2012, sales totaled 3,813, a 55.2% \n                                                \n4  Unlike the structure for short-term bank loans, which have bullet repayments, the repayment structure under a \nlease contract is typically mortgage-style and, therefore, better suited to good cash flow management by bus \noperators. \n5  Sector Overview (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides further information on the \nurban transport sector and the financial leasing industry. \n6  Well maintained and state-of-the-art diesel buses are comparable in energy efficiency to electric buses, especially \nwhen the electricity being used is produced by coal-fired power plants. \n7  NGV Communication Group. 2012. Asian NGV Communications, Number 63. Chuncheon. (May).  \n8  chinabuses.com. 2012. 2011 PRC CNG Bus Market Analysis; 2011 PRC LNG Bus Market Analysis. Beijing. ", "  3 \nincrease over the same period in 2011. In 2011, 3,022 LNG buses were sold in the PRC, and \nsales totaled 1,332 buses in January-April 2012, a 93% increase from the same period in 2011. \n15.  Three factors have contributed to this strong sales growth. First, the price of natural gas \nhas remained relatively low, which has kept the costs of operating CNG and LNG buses 30%\u2013\n40% lower than those of running diesel buses. Second, the extra cost of purchasing natural gas \nbuses rather than comparable diesel vehicles is relatively small\u2014about $3,000 for CNG buses \nand $10,000 for LNG buses. In addition, these differences are often covered by augmented \nsubsidies from local governments.9 Finally, the number of CNG and LNG fueling stations has \nbeen increasing significantly and this trend is expected to continue. During the 2011\u20132015 \ntwelfth Five-Year Plan period, the number of CNG stations in the PRC is projected to rise from \n2,500 to 5,000. LNG stations are to rise in number from 300 to 2,000. \n16.  Market  demand  for  hybrid  and  electric  buses  is  also  very  strong  and  has  greatly \nbenefited from strong government support. In January 2009, three ministries10 and the National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NDRC) launched a joint pilot program that offered \nsubsidies of CNY600,000 for each purchase of a fuel-cell electric bus, CNY500,000 per battery-\nonly electric bus, and up to CNY420,000 per hybrid bus, depending on the battery type and fuel \nsavings rate.11 By July 2010, 25 cities were participating in the program, which aimed to spur \nthe introduction of 24,220 hybrid or electric buses in these cities by the end of 2012. In the \nprogram\u2019s first year (2009), 3,001 of the buses were sold, an increase of 285% from 779 in \n2008. A total of 5,623 of the buses were sold in 2011, bringing cumulative sales for 2009\u20132011 \nto 14,491.12 \n17.  This pilot program is expected to expand, which will help keep the demand for hybrid \nand electric buses strong. In April 2012, the PRC\u2019s State Council issued the Energy Efficient \nand New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan, 2012\u20132020, which set a sales target of \n500,000 hybrid and electric vehicles for 2012-2015 and 5 million for 2012-2020. To reach these \ntargets, annual sales need to average 120,000 per annum during 2012\u20132015. Assuming that \nbuses account for 10% of these overall sales,13 and the average price per bus is CNY900,000, \nannual sales of hybrid and electric buses would average CNY10.8 billion over the 2012\u20132015 \nperiod. To support the State Council plan, the three ministries and the NDRC extended their \npilot  program  to  all  cities  in  the  PRC  in  September  2012.  The  program  will  now  provide \nsubsidies of up to CNY420,000 per bus for the purchase of up to 5,000 hybrid buses. \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n18.

FLCs  participating  in  the  program  are  expected  to  comply  with  the  requirements \nimposed by their PRC regulators.

Local governments participating in the pilot program provide \nfurther subsidies and support. \n12 chinabuses.com. 2012. 2011 PRC New Energy Bus Market Analysis.

Subject to the program limit of $275 million, ADB will provide term loans under the \nprogram of up to $100 million (or CNY equivalent) per borrower to finance the leasing of clean \nbuses.14  These loans will have maturities of up to 8 years from the date of the signing of legal \ndocumentation. Subject to demand, up to 10% of loan proceeds per borrower can be used to \nfinance  the  leasing  of  IT  and  management  systems  that  will  increase  bus  fleet  operating \nefficiency.

This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \n24.  The program will seek to mobilize commercial cofinancing of at least $100 million and up \nto $200 million in the form of parallel loans from other development finance institutions, specialty \nfunds,  and  commercial  banks.15 (This  sentence  has  been  redacted  due  to  commercially \nsensitive information.) \n25.  The program is expected to be supported by an associated ADB technical assistance \n(TA) grant to strengthen the capacity of bus operators. The TA will include development of \ninformation resources and training materials aimed at maximizing the service performance of \nthe bus fleets through the proper selection of bus types, optimization of fleet operations, a \ntraining program on driving in an eco-conscious way, advice on maintenance, and assistance \nwith management reporting and IT systems.16 \nB.

Value Added by ADB Assistance \n29.  ADB adds value to  the program in the following ways: \n(i)  ADB will provide critical long-term finance and help leverage cofinancing. This \nwill help address current funding constraints in the financial leasing industry and \npromote the development of the clean bus leasing business in the PRC. \n(ii)  ADB, through its contacts with provincial and local governments, is in a unique \nposition to help the leasing companies reach potential clients. So far, ADB has \nintroduced five  public  transport  operators  in  the  cities  of Wuhan,  Xi\u2019an,  and \nKunming  to  leasing  companies,  as  well  as  one  transport  software  system \ndeveloper based in Shanghai. \n(iii)  ADB recognizes and is responsive to the technical and operational needs of bus \noperators. The program is expected to be supported by an associated TA to \n                                                \n14 The borrowing entity for ADB\u2019s loan can be the selected FLC, its parent, or a special funding vehicle that is covered \nby appropriate guarantees and/or security arrangements. The program limit will be $275 million and/or the CNY \nequivalent, with the CNY loan balance to be determined at or about the time of each loan signing, using the \nexchange rate at or about the time of the relevant loan signing date. \n15 ADB will introduce the program and the participating FLCs to potential cofinancing partners and share due \ndiligence materials with these partners. The participating FLCs will negotiate financing terms separately with each \nlender. \n16 The TA will be processed separately, pending confirmation of funding sources. Funding of up to $2.5 million has \nbeen sought from the Global Environment Facility. If the application is not successful, funding of up to $1 million \nwill be sought from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund for TA with a smaller scope.

This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information. \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n31.  The program\u2019s impact will be an increase in clean bus transport services in the PRC. \nThe program is fully in line with the multilateral development banks\u2019 Rio+20 (United Nations \nConference on Sustainable Development) commitment to provide $175 billion for transport in \ndeveloping countries during 2012-2022. By financing the lease of clean buses, the program will \nsupport the expansion of a low-cost, flexible mode of public transport. Although these benefits \nwill not be measured, the expansion of clean bus services under the program is expected to \ndirectly  benefit  millions  of  low-income  commuters,  improve  air  quality,  and  reduce  GHG \nemissions. 17  \n2.  Outcome \n32.  The program outcome will be an increase in the deployment of clean buses in the urban, \nsuburban, and intercity public transport markets.18 The program is expected to finance the \nleasing of at least 5,000 clean buses by 2018. From 2019, the program will help avoid GHG \nemissions of 1.31 million tons per annum through a shift from the use of private cars to the use \nof public transport and through the use of low emission buses.19 The program will result in 420 \nmillion vehicle-kilometers of service operation by clean buses per annum in the PRC.20 \n3.  Output \n33.  The program output will be expanded clean bus leasing operations of FLCs in the public \ntransport market.  \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n34.  Strategy 2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support for environmentally sustainable growth and \nthe expansion of ADB\u2019s promotion of sound environmental management. 21 It also seeks to meet \nthe  region\u2019s  growing  energy  demands  by  helping  DMCs  develop  environment-friendly \ntechnologies. A key action is to mitigate climate change by moving DMCs on to low-carbon \ngrowth paths by (i) improving energy efficiency, (ii) expanding the use of clean energy sources, \n(iii)  reducing  fugitive  GHG  emissions,  (iv)  modernizing  public  transport  systems,  and  (v) \narresting deforestation. The program is fully consistent with these strategic objectives. \n                                                \n17 The environmental impacts will be achieved through a shift from travel in private vehicles to public transport, \nadoption of clean fuel, energy-efficient and low emission vehicles, and deployment of IT systems to help bus \nnetworks operate more efficiently.  \n18 Subject to demand, the program may also support wider adoption of IT systems that increase the operating \nefficiency of bus fleets. \n19 The use of each clean bus is estimated to avoid the emission of 0.75 tons of greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalent) per \nday on average. Assuming 350 operating days per year per bus, 5,000 buses avoid 1.31 million tons of \ngreenhouse gas emissions (CO2 equivalent) per annum. \n20 Assuming average speed of 20 kilometers per hour; 12 operating hours per day, and 350 operating days per year. \n21 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "6 \n35.  Financial sector development is one of ADB\u2019s five core areas of specialization under \nStrategy 2020. Development of the finance sectors of DMCs is seen as essential to ensuring \nsustainable private sector-led economic growth. Under Strategy 2020, ADB seeks to strengthen \nits support to the finance sector at the regional and national levels by helping to develop \nfinancial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services. The program will provide critical \nlong-term  financing  to  support  the  nascent  leasing  industry  in  the  PRC,  while  promoting \ninnovative financing mechanisms for sustainable growth and the development of the capital \nmarkets.  \n2.  Consistency with Country Strategy \n36.  The program is fully in line with the priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2011\u20132015  for  the  PRC.22 It  is  aligned,  in  particular,  with  the  strategy\u2019s  emphasis  on \nmainstreaming climate change considerations and support for green finance.23 The program \nsupports financial sector development, one of the private sector operational focuses identified in \nthe country partnership strategy. It also supports the implementation of the PRC's twelfth Five-\nYear Plan, which accentuates resource conservation and environmental protection and attaches \ntop priority to improving energy efficiency, reducing pollution emissions, and developing cleaner \nand renewable energy. \n3.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n37.  Transport  sector  development.  The  program  fully  supports  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \nTransport Initiative (STI), which focuses on creating transport systems that are accessible, safe, \naffordable, and environment-friendly. According to the STI operational plan, ADB should focus \non roles where it can significantly add value to sustainable transport activities. To optimize its \ncontribution, ADB should design its operations to build on ADB-wide and international best \npractices in sustainable transport and channel its financing to projects and activities where ADB \ninvolvement will result in increased sustainability. ADB assistance should help DMCs overcome \nsector obstacles to wider adoption of sustainable transport. Based on these principles, urban \ntransport is identified as an area in which ADB should scale up support for sustainability. The \nSTI operational plan also emphasizes private sector participation and mobilization of additional \nfinance.  \n38.  Financial  sector  development.  Financial  sector  development  is  a  focus  of  ADB's \nPrivate  Sector  Development  Strategy24 and  Enhanced  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,25 which \nregard economic growth, stimulated by private sector investment, as a key factor in reducing \npoverty. The program is consistent with the overall sector strategy. It will help develop the \nPRC\u2019s financial sector, give public transport operators better access to financial services, make \nprivate sector development in the country more sustainable, and contribute to ADB\u2019s mission to \nhelp its DMCs reduce poverty and improve living conditions and quality of life. \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n39.  The program is classified as category FI (treated as C) under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples impacts. \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2012.

Compliance  with  emission  standards \ncovering bus engines is mandatory in the PRC and the program is expected to have minimal \nenvironmental or social impacts. Clean buses leased as a result of the program will have to \nmeet the PRC\u2019s permit, testing, and registration requirements and follow national and local \nvehicle  emission  standards  and  regulations.  No  land  acquisition,  physical  or  economic \ndisplacements, or impacts on indigenous peoples are expected from the activities of the FLC \nborrowers. All participating FLCs will apply the Prohibited Investment Activities List in Annex 5 \nof ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and comply with relevant national laws and regulations. \n40.  The borrowers will need to comply with national labor laws and relevant internationally \nrecognized core labor standards. The program is expected to benefit all commuters, including \nwomen, and therefore is classified as having no gender element. \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n41.  The participating FLCs will be advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting \ncorruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event \nof noncompliance. \nC.  Investment Limitations \n42.  The  loan  program  is  within  the  medium-term  country,  industry,  group,  and  single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \nD.  Assurances \n43.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),26 the PRC Government\u2019s no objection to the proposed Program will be obtained. ADB \nwill enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n44.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  program  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nproposed loan program of $275,000,000 (or CNY equivalent) to up to five financial leasing \ncompanies for financing clean buses in the People\u2019s Republic of China, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n19 December 2012 \n                                                \n26 ADB. 1966.
