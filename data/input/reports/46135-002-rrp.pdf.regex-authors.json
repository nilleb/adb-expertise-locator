THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Djizzak Sanitation System Development Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Uzbekistan in improving urban wastewater \nservices for the city of Djizzak. Responding directly to the needs of urban communities, it will \nupgrade and expand the existing sewerage system, provide wastewater treatment services, \nstrengthen institutional capacity, and assist with development of a new provincial water supply \nand wastewater utility. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Djizzak  city  is  the  administrative  and  economic  center  of  Djizzak  Province,  located \nstrategically  between  the  nation\u2019s capital, Tashkent,  which  lies  170 kilometers  (km) to the \nnortheast, and Samarkand, which is 90 km to the southwest. With an area of over 21,000 \nsquare kilometers, Djizzak Province is an important agro-industrial region, and is rich in mineral \nresources.2 The province is home to over 200 industrial enterprises, including over 30 major \nindustries,3 and had an estimated population in excess of 1.2 million in 2012. As the primary \nadministrative  and  economic  hub  in  the  province,  Djizzak  city  is  a  key  driver  of  regional \neconomic growth and development. The city is approximately 11 km (north\u2013south) by 10 km \n(east\u2013west), and has good road and rail networks. The city\u2019s population was estimated at \n163,000 in 2013.4  Growth from population increase and city expansion is anticipated to average \nover 5% per year through 2020. \n \n4.  The city\u2019s strategic importance is highlighted by the government\u2019s recent approval of a \nlong-term  development plan  to  transform the  city  into  a  regional  administrative,  economic, \nindustrial, and cultural center.5 Under the plan, urbanization will be accelerated, industrial zones \nexpanded, existing industries relocated, and residential areas developed. A special industrial \nzone (SIZ) is also being developed to encourage foreign direct investment into high-technology \nindustries.6 These  initiatives  will  dramatically  increase  the  city\u2019s  population,7 strengthen  its \neconomy,  create  jobs,  and,  as  a  consequence,  increase  household  incomes  and  living \nstandards. \n \n5.  The city\u2019s sewerage system lags seriously behind other infrastructure. Although it serves \nless than a quarter of the city\u2019s current population, the system is plagued by frequent overflows \nand  blockages.8 Originally  constructed  in  1975,  and  with  poor  subsequent  maintenance, \nsections of the 131-kilometer long sewerage network have now deteriorated well beyond their \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  These include barite, limestone (cement) gypsum, and facing stone. \n3  The province\u2019s industrial production includes the chemical, light industry, food production, agricultural processing, \nengineering, and metalwork industries. The province is also considered a regional leader in the production of alkali \nbatteries, knitted garments, mixed fodder, and flour. \n4  Based on the Institute of Forecasting and Macroeconomic Research. \n5  Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 266: Approval of the Master Plan of Development of Djizzak City by the \nYear 2030, 30 September 2013. \n6  Presidential Decree No. 4516: Establishment of a Special Industrial Zone, Djizzak, 18 March 2013. \n7  Current estimates project the population will increase to about 260,000 by 2020, and 310,000 by 2035. \n8  In 2013, the system had a roster of 12,871 domestic consumers and 308 consumers categorized as \u201cother\u201d, \nserving a population of approximately 38,500. The network also receives effluents from industrial facilities within \nthe vicinity of the WWTP and from the Uch-Tepa district center located north of Djizzak city. \n ", "2 \n \nuseful  life,  resulting  in  extensive  and  frequent  network  malfunctions.9 Also,  following  the \npermanent breakdown of the system\u2019s wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in 2002 due to weak \ninstitutional  capacity  and  financial  constraints,  untreated  sewage  from  the  entire  network \ncompletely bypasses the WWTP and discharges directly into surface water channels, resulting \nin serious environmental damage and threats to public health. Epidemiological records for \nDjizzak reveal increasingly disturbing trends of diseases such as acute intestinal infections and \nviral hepatitis that are commonly associated with poor sewerage and sanitation. The Djizzak \nCity Sewerage Company is responsible for provision of sewerage within the city, but struggles \nto operate and maintain even basic elements of the existing sewerage network. Its financial \nmanagement  is  not  well  established  and  performance  requires  improvement;10 revenues \ngenerally cover only salaries and essential network repairs. \n \n6.  The government plans to improve sanitary conditions through phased investments to \nrehabilitate and expand the sewerage system and reform the responsible institutions. A new \nprovincial  water  supply  and  sewerage  enterprise  is  currently  being  created  that  will  own, \nmanage, and operate all urban water supply and wastewater systems in Djizzak Province. \nDjizzak city\u2019s existing water supply and sewerage companies will be absorbed as a branch \noperation of this provincial administration.11 Overall, the government understands that in parallel \nto  significant  physical  investments,  widespread  institutional  reform  and  cost-recovery \nimprovements will be essential to improve sector conditions, mitigate acute public health and \nenvironmental impacts in the city, and support planned economic growth. \n \n7.  The project will support the government\u2019s development plans for Djizzak city by both \nrevitalizing and expanding the city\u2019s sewerage system and providing substantial assistance to \nimplement  the  planned  institutional  reform  process.  It  is  consistent  with  (i)  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  Strategy  2020  midterm  review  action  plan;12 (ii)  ADB\u2019s  Country \nPartnership  Strategy  for  Uzbekistan,  2012\u20132016;13 (iii)  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  by \nsupporting increased investment in wastewater management and sanitation;14 (iv) the Program \nof Integrated Development and Modernization of Water Supply and Sewerage Systems of the \nRepublic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Years  2009\u20132020;  and  (v)  previous  and  ongoing  ADB \ninterventions in the sector.15 Lessons that have been incorporated in the project design include \n                                                \n9  Sewer network breakdowns increased from 428 (2011) to 503 (2013), corresponding to 3.84 breakdowns per km \nannually; over the same period, breakdowns from the four pump stations increased from 7 to 18 per year. In a \nrecent survey, 40% of consumers reported sewerage breakdowns during the previous year. \n10  The company currently generates a small profit, but this is primarily the result of a dramatic reduction in operating \ncosts caused by its wastewater treatment facility being inoperative, and is not representative of normal operations. \n11 Prime Minister\u2019s decree 3/8960 (March 2014) confirms that provincial water supply and sewerage companies are to \nbe transformed into provincial water supply and sewerage enterprises, which will absorb municipal water and \nwastewater companies within their jurisdictions. The name of the provincial enterprise for Djizzak is the Djizzak \nRegional Water Supply and Sewerage Enterprise. \n12 ADB. 2014.

The \ncurrent rating of these projects is on-track. \n ", "3 \n \nthe need to (i) avoid project commencement delays; (ii) provide early counterpart funding; (iii) \nrecruit qualified consultants in a timely manner; (iv) ensure project management unit (PMU) and \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  staff  salaries  are  competitive  and  include  incentive \nmechanisms; and (v) maintain quality standards for civil works structures. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the project will be improved living standards, environment, and public \nhealth in Djizzak. The outcome of the project will be improved and expanded access to reliable, \nsustainable, and affordable water supply and sanitation services in Djizzak. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  The project will have two outputs: \n  \n(i)  Output 1: Wastewater management system in Djizzak city improved. Output \n1  will  construct trunk  sewers  (45.80 km  in  length),  a  new WWTP,  and  one \npumping  station;  rehabilitate  trunk  sewers  (16.75  km)  and  three  pumping \nstations; procure equipment; and decommission obsolete components. Support \nwill be provided to operate and maintain the new facilities. By project completion, \nthe system will collect and treat 30,000 cubic meters of sewage per day from \ndomestic and nondomestic consumers, including at least 85,000 residents of \nDjizzak city and the Uch-Tepa district center.  \n \n(ii)  Output 2: Institutional capacity of the Djizzak Regional Water Supply and \nSewerage Enterprise improved. A transitional support program will support the \nestablishment  and  operations  of  the  Djizzak  Regional  Water  Supply  and \nSewerage Enterprise (DWSE) that will absorb the Djizzak city water supply and \nsewerage companies. The DWSE\u2019s capacity will be further strengthened through \nmanagement support and training. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n10.

In addition to works, goods, consulting services, and interest during implementation, \nADB funding for the project is also expected to include the financing of (i) costs of the PMU and \nPIU, including staff salaries and operating costs;16 and (ii) land acquisition and resettlement \ncosts.17 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  Advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  has  been  requested  by  the  Uzbekistan \nCommunal  Services  Agency  (UCSA),  the  executing  agency  for  the  project,  for  the  early \nrecruitment of the project development consultants (PDCs) and detailed design consultant.18 An \ninvitation for expressions of interest for the PDCs is expected by late 2015. \n \n15.  As the executing agency for the project, UCSA will establish an internal PMU to monitor \nand evaluate project activities, outputs, and safeguards compliance, and prepare review reports. \nDWSE  will  be  the  project  implementing  agency  and  responsible  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation. While DWSE is being established and becoming operational, a PIU will perform \nthe implementing agency functions.19 The PIU will be located in Djizzak city, and will report \ndirectly to UCSA and the PMU. UCSA will report quarterly to the project steering committee. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).20 \n                                                \n16  ADB financing of project management costs is considered necessary to ensure timely availability of funds for a \nfunction critical to the overall success and timely completion of the project. In addition, the budgeted costs for the \nPMU and PIU are viewed as reasonable and consistent with project management costs incurred and financed by \nADB under the projects financed under the ongoing MFF: ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the \nWater Supply and Sanitation Services Investment Program. Manila. \n17  ADB has funded land acquisition and resettlement costs for the projects financed under the ongoing MFF. \nAdditional rationale and justification for ADB financing of land acquisition and resettlement costs, in line with the \nrequirements set forth in ADB. 2012. Cost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditures for ADB Financing. Operations \nManual. OM H3/BP and H3/OP. Manila, are in paragraph 19 of this report. Resettlement costs will be eligible for \nADB financing only if they are incurred in compliance with all applicable requirements under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) and the ADB-approved resettlement plan. \n18  Established by presidential decree in 2000, UCSA is a central government body that is directly accountable to the \nCabinet of Ministers. With overall responsibility to improve water supply and wastewater services, it formulates \npolicy, advises on reforms and decrees, and is a focal execution agency for foreign investments in the sector. \nUCSA\u2019s activities are financed by a combination of government, utility, and development bank project funding. \nUCSA is the executing agency for the projects referenced in footnote 15. \n19  The PIU staff will include a director, a wastewater engineer, an accountant, a social and gender specialist, and an \nenvironment and social safeguard specialist. This arrangement is similar to the PIU for the ongoing MFF. \n20  The Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) details the project \nsteering committee\u2019s tasks and responsibilities. \n ", "5 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  February 2016\u2013April 2021 \nEstimated completion date  30 April 2021 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee; chair: Ministry of Financea \n(ii)   Executing agency  UCSA \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  Djizzak Regional Water Supply and Sewerage Enterprise \n(iv)  Implementation unit  PIU, 5 staff \nProcurement  International competitive  1 contract \u2013 design and build  $39,000,000 \nbidding  (with extended defect \nnotification period and \noperation maintenance) \nInternational competitive  3 contracts  $42,733,000 \nbidding \u2013 works \nNational competitive  1 contract  $1,802,000 \nbidding \u2013 works \nNational competitive  3 contracts  $2,702,000 \nbidding \u2013 equipment \nShopping  5 contracts  $208,000 \nConsulting services  Project development  International: 85 person-months  $3,300,000 \nconsultant  National: 132 person-months \nQCBS \nDetailed design sewerage  National: 130 person-months  $800,000 \nnetwork consultant \nQCBS \nTransition Support  National: 1,200 person-months  $2,500,000  \nProgram \nGovernment financing \nPIU\u2013PMU auditing  International: 8 person-months  $294,000 \nLCS  National: 20 person-months \nRetroactive financing and/or  Retroactive financing is available for up to 20% of the loan amount of advance \nadvance contracting  contracts for the project development consultant and the detailed design. \nDisbursement   The ADB loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, LCS = least-cost selection, PIU = project implementation unit, PMU = project \nmanagement unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, UCSA = Agency \u201cUzkommunkhizmat\u201d (Uzbekistan \nCommunal Services Agency). \na The  project  steering  committee  composition  has  not  yet  been  confirmed,  but  it  is  envisioned  to  include \nrepresentatives of UCSA, Djizzak Regional Water Supply and Sewerage Enterprise, the provincial government \nadministration, the governor\u2019s office, and Djizzak city government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n16.  Due diligence undertaken during project preparatory technical assistance confirmed the \ntechnical viability of the project. Analysis of alternative technical options identified appropriate \nwastewater treatment process technology and sewerage system design in terms of economic \nand safeguards aspects. The project option recommends construction of a new WWTP with a \ntreatment capacity of 30,000 cubic meters per day and rehabilitation and expansion of the \nexisting sewerage system in accordance with international design and construction standards. \nThe system will serve domestic and nondomestic consumers, including a population of at least \n85,000.21 The project will meet the government\u2019s effluent water quality standards, optimize \n                                                \n21  It is anticipated that the project will rehabilitate connections for at least 38,000 people, and add new connections for \nat least 47,000 people. Further expansion will be considered based on the city\u2019s needs and financial capacity. \n ", "6 \n \nelectricity consumption,  and  improve  the  environment  and  natural  water  bodies  of  the  \nproject areas. Operation and maintenance (O&M) equipment, a laboratory, and specialized \nservice  equipment  will  be  procured.  Support  provided  by  the  project\u2019s  Transition  Support \nProgram will ensure that the DWSE is fully established and operational. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n17.  Economic analysis. The economic viability of the overall project is assessed from a \nnational perspective, based on the benefits of rehabilitating and improving the sewerage system \nfor Djizzak city. The main quantified benefits for the population from improved sanitation include: \nimproved health and reduced infant mortality, time savings, and saved costs of constructing and \nmaintaining alternative sanitation facilities. The project will also support the growth of the SIZ in \nDjizzak by providing essential wastewater collection and treatment facilities, and contributing to \neconomic benefits. Additional benefits accrue from the use of treated effluent and the greater \npublic goods benefits brought about by an improved environment and water resources. The \nproject is assessed to be economically viable, as the economic internal rate of return of 14.12% \nexceeds the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The sensitivity analysis \nshows that the economic internal rate of return is most sensitive to increased capital costs, and \nless sensitive to increased O&M costs and reduced benefits. \n \n18.  Financial  analysis. The financial analysis is conducted from the perspective of an \nindependent, stand-alone entity that is solely responsible for the management and operation of \nsewage collection and treatment for Djizzak city and Uch-Tepa district center. Income and \nexpenditures  over  a  25-year  period  were  estimated  based  on  internationally  acceptable \nparameters  and  a  tariff  regime  appropriate  for  the  customer  base,  differentiating  between \nresidential  households,  nonrevenue-generating  institutions,  commercial  enterprises,  and \nindustrial operations in the SIZ. The analysis shows that the potential tariff revenues will cover \nall direct O&M and depreciation costs from the outset, but continuing government support will be \nneeded to service the ADB loan. The entity\u2019s financial position will improve over time, however, \nas the debt is paid off and depreciation charges diminish. Moreover, absorption of the existing \nDjizzak City Sewerage Company into the DWSE will also improve the financial viability of the \nproject. With financial support from the central government and appropriate tariff adjustments, \nthe project could be financially viable and generate a financial internal rate of return of 2%, \nwhich is higher than the weighted average cost of capital of 1.60%. The sensitivity analysis \nshows that the financial performance is sensitive to increases in capital investment and O&M \ncosts, and changes to the future revenue stream. \n \n19.  Managing  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  risks\u2014such  as  environmental \nmitigation,  monitoring,  and  land  acquisition  impacts22\u2014will  require  funding  that  may  not \nnecessarily  accord  with  the  government\u2019s  annual  budget.  Funds  for  land  acquisition \ncompensation will be required following completion of the detailed design, but before the award \nof civil works contracts; it is easier to include this funding in the project costs rather than relying \non the government\u2019s annual budget.  The government\u2019s administrative arrangement under the \nresolution for land acquisition ensures that payment of compensation will be effective and \ntransparent, but to ensure compensation is paid in accordance with the land acquisition and \nresettlement plan (LARP), an independent monitoring agency will be recruited by the PMU, with \ndisbursements for land acquisition costs based on verification of payment by the independent \nmonitoring agency. \n \n                                                \n22 The  land  is  owned  by  the  government;  compensation  payments  reflect  the  economic  loss  resulting  from \ndiscontinued use of the land by farmers. However, when the LARP is updated, other impacts may be realized.  \n ", "7 \n \nC.  Governance \n20.  A financial management  assessment  has  concluded  that the  existing Djizzak  water \nsupply and sewerage companies, and the existing provincial water enterprise, currently meet \nADB\u2019s financial management requirements, although auditing functions need to be improved. \nFinancial  management  is  being  strengthened  through  the  government\u2019s  institutional  reform \ninitiatives, which  will  result  in  the  creation  of  the  DWSE,  which  will  implement  \nstandardized    reporting  systems  and  improved  financial  management  and  internal  control \nsystems. The DWSE will be established with assistance from the project\u2019s Transition Support \nProgram. \n \n21.  Procurement  management  assessments  concluded  that  UCSA  satisfies  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements for an executing agency. Its system is adequate to (i) prepare qualified bidding \ndocuments; and (ii) conduct the procurement of civil works, goods, equipment, and consulting \nservices.23 The PMU will be staffed with experienced personnel that have received training on \nADB  project  administration  and  implementation.  ADB  will  provide  additional  procurement \noversight. The PMU staff will also be familiar with ADB\u2019s Handbook for Borrowers on the \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects (2006),24 Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended from time to time), and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n22.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the Ministry of Finance, and UCSA. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n23.  Based on household budgets survey (Goskomstat), the poverty level in Djizzak province \nwas 27.90%, compared with 23.60% nationally.25 The project will contribute indirectly to poverty \nreduction  in  the  project  area  through  the  provision  of  an  improved  sewerage  system  and \nimplementation  of  sanitation  awareness  and  hygiene-promotion  activities  and  associated \ninstitutional  and  management  strengthening  of  the  utility.  This  will  reduce  health  care \nexpenditures  caused  by  unsanitary  environmental  conditions  and  improve  health  and  well-\nbeing.26 More than 85,000 persons will benefit from the project investments, including through \nimprovements to existing services and provision of expanded access to services.27 \n \n24.  Constraints related to the lack of sanitation in homes negatively affect the quality of life \nfor all family members, especially women. As detailed in the project gender action plan, the \nproject  will  (i)  recruit  a  PMU  and  PIU  social  and  gender  specialist;  (ii)  facilitate  women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  project-associated  activities;  (iii)  provide  employment  opportunities  in  the \nWWTP, with jobs such as sanitation operator available to women (at least 50% of WWTP \nlaboratory staff and 50% of customer care workers will be women); (iv) include women in the \nproject management and implementation team, who will be equitably paid; (v) provide gender \nand development awareness training for relevant organizations; (vi) provide equal opportunity \n                                                \n23  The project's procurement capacity assessment report and recommendation is available on request. \n24  ADB. 2006. Handbook for Borrowers on the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n25  Data from the 2007 Household Budgets Survey (Goskomstat), conducted by the State Statistics Committee. \n26  A project preparatory technical assistance household survey of 280 households in Djizzak (April 2014) revealed \nthat  almost  two-thirds  (64.3%)  of  households  surveyed  are  not  connected  to centralized  sewerage.  These \nhouseholds use pit latrines, 44% of which are not concreted (sealed); given that 15% of households use water from \nshallow wells for drinking and household purposes (often located only a few meters from unsealed pit latrines), \ncross contamination is likely, posing a serious threat of infectious and parasitic diseases. \n27 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nand access to training for female DWSE staff; (vii) establish a gender-sensitive customer care \nand  complaints  unit;  and  (viii)  conduct  gender-sensitive  sanitation  and  hygiene  promotion \ntraining  and  outreach  activities  linked to  the  sewerage  system to  reduce  disease  and the \nassociated burden on women who provide care.28 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n25.  Environmental safeguards. The project is classified as category B for environmental \nimpacts in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). An initial environmental \nexamination was undertaken regarding the construction of the new WWTP and supporting \nfacilities.  It  assesses  impacts  and  includes  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  to \nminimize or avoid these impacts. Public consultations were also completed in Djizzak. The \nproject  will  not  cause  significant  environmental  impacts,  and  almost  all  environmental \ndisturbances will primarily occur during construction. Most of the impacts are temporary in \nnature, and can be addressed during construction by employing good construction practices. An \nenvironmental monitoring report covering EMP implementation must be submitted biannually to \nADB. \n \n26.  The project is considered to be environmentally feasible. The PMU, on behalf of UCSA, \nwill have overall responsibility for implementing the EMP throughout project preparation and \nimplementation. The contractor will be responsible for implementing the EMP and mitigating all \nimpacts relating to construction activities. UCSA has limited capacity to address environmental \nconcerns,  and  consequently  the  PMU  team  will  include  an  environment  specialist.29 The \nsupervision consultant will also include an environment specialist on its team to supervise the \ncontractor in implementing the EMP during the construction phase. \n \n27.  Social safeguards. The project will require the permanent and temporary acquisition of \nland. Permanent acquisition of approximately 30.65 hectares will be required for the WWTP, its \naccess road, and a new pumping station in Halkabad, while temporary acquisition of 43.99 \nhectares will be required during reconstruction of the sewerage network. On this basis, the \nproject  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The new WWTP will be constructed on reserve land of the \nDjizzak region, and an involuntary resettlement compliance audit indicates that the land used by \nthe existing and new facilities is not in dispute or subject to current or past claims by other \nparties,  with  no  future  claims  expected.  The  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  close \nconsultation with affected people. There are 13 households with 132 residents affected by land \nacquisition;  during  consultation,  all  expressed  a  willingness  to  accept  land-for-land \ncompensation. \n \n28.  The LARP was prepared in accordance with national laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The LARP assessment was carried out from May to July \n2014. Four consultations were performed with affected people and other relevant parties such \nas local government agencies and local communities. Implementation of the LARP, including \nland acquisition, consultants, and monitoring, will cost approximately $440,000, of which about \n$375,000 is to compensate for permanent and temporary acquisition. In addition, training will be \nprovided by the PDC on LARP implementation. UCSA has experience in dealing with LARP \n                                                \n28  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The project is classified effective \ngender mainstreaming. \n29  The specialist will be responsible for (i) ensuring that all environmental concerns are taken into account during the \ndetailed design, (ii) ensuring that the procurement and contract documents cover all environmental requirements, \n(iii) monitoring EMP implementation being performed by supervision consultants and contractors, and (iv) preparing \nbiannual environmental monitoring reports to be submitted to ADB and UCSA. \n ", "9 \n \nimplementation; for this project, a qualified resettlement consultant will assist the PMU. The \nconsultant will update the LARP after the detailed design is available, and then submit it to ADB \nfor approval prior to processing of the procurement contract. Compensation to affected farmers \nmust be fully paid prior to the award of the civil works contracts. In the event that the project \nincludes a design-and-build contract, the PMU will issue a notice to proceed with civil works only \nafter ADB has formally concurred that all compensation payments have been paid in full. The \nPMU will be responsible for submitting formal reports to ADB,30 and for establishing a grievance \nredress mechanism to address complaints. The poverty and social assessment survey indicates \nthat there are no communities or groups in the project area that maintain a particular culture, \nlanguage, or properties. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples and \nethnic minorities requirements in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). To \ncomply with ADB information disclosure requirements, the initial environmental examination and \nLARP reports were disclosed on the ADB website on 28 August 2014. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs.  \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nNo regular internal audit for PMU; staff  A  project  management  team,  including  a  qualified  international \nrecruited  for PIU in  Djizzak may  have   financial  management specialist  and  a qualified national  financial \nlimited experience with ADB financial  management  specialist,  will  be  recruited  to  provide  necessary \nmanagement requirements  support  and  to  strengthen  internal  control  of  the  PMU,  PIU,  and \nDWSE. \nGovernment unable to finance and sustain  DWSE has been established to improve water supply and sanitation \nproject operation and maintenance over the  sector management in Djizzak Province.
