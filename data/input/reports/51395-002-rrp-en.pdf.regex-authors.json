I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Uttar Pradesh Power Distribution Network \nRehabilitation Project. The report describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Enhancing \nCommunity Participation, Gender Mainstreaming, and Institutional Capacity Building of Uttar \nPradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL); and if the Board approves the proposed MFF, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  improve  the  quality  and  reliability  of  electricity  supply,  reduce  the \naggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses in electricity distribution, and restore the \nfinancial sustainability of the rural electricity supply. These will be achieved by converting low-\nvoltage distribution lines to aerial bundle conductors (ABCs), separating the 11-kilovolt (kV) \nfeeders supplying agriculture consumers from those supplying rural households to facilitate the \nrationing of electricity supply to agriculture consumers, improving the financial management of \nUPPCL, and deepening community engagement to improve electricity supply cost recovery and \ngender inclusivity in rural electricity distribution\u2013related activities. \n \nII.  RATIONALE \n \n3.  Access to electricity. Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state with close to 220 million \npeople, has a poverty rate (29%), higher than the national average (21%) and suffers from lack \nof economic opportunities. In FY2018, its per capita electricity consumption of about 400 kilowatt-\nhours (kWh) was lower than the national per capita consumption of 960 kWh.2 UPPCL added 8 \nmillion rural connections and 1 million urban consumers from 2017 to 2019, raising the rural and \nurban consumer base to 17 million and 9 million, respectively under the SAUBHAGYA scheme \nsupported by government of India.3 With the completion of this scheme, Uttar Pradesh has \nsubstantially advanced the \u201cenergy for all\u201d objective with a household electrification rate of over \n80% in 2020 compared to around 55% in 2016.   \n  \n4.  Affordability of electricity and cost recovery. The Uttar Pradesh government has the \npolicy of subsidizing the electricity supply to its poor consumers, and maintained the lifeline tariff \n(for consumption below 100 kWh/month) for residential consumers at \u20b93.35/kWh compared with \nthe supply cost of \u20b97.85/kWh. Based on the socio-economic survey undertaken during project \npreparation, this rate is considered affordable for the poor with estimated expenditure outlay of \n$200/month/household to meet 60 kWh/month electricity requirement of a typical poor household. \nIn  addition,  the  electricity  tariffs  for  residential  consumers  consuming  above  the  lifeline \nconsumption and agriculture consumers for water pumping are also maintained below cost \nrecovery level. UPPCL, a state-owned enterprise responsible for bulk power purchase and power \ndistribution in Uttar Pradesh, required about \u20b960 billion fiscal transfer to cover its cost of electricity \nsupply in FY2018.  \n \n5.   Furthermore, UPPCL has low collection efficiency, collecting only 77% of billed revenue \nin FY2019. Collection efficiency in rural areas is below 50%, mainly due to rural households\u2019 poor \npayment discipline. Agriculture consumers are supplied by unmetered connections and billed a \nfixed monthly charge based on normative electricity consumption linked to the contracted water \n \n1  TA financing includes (i) $500,000 from the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB); and (ii) $1,500,000 from Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to be administered by ADB. \n2  Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, Central Statistics Office. 2019. Energy \nStatistics 2019. New Delhi. \n3  \u201cPower for All\u201d scheme aimed at providing electricity access to all population.  \n ", "2   \npump capacity. The tariff regime does not provide any incentive to conserve electricity, and \nsurveys indicate that farmers tend to overuse electricity. \n \n6.  Technical issues of electricity distribution. The rural electricity supply in Uttar Pradesh \nis  characterized  by  (i) frequent  power  interruptions  and  (ii)  an  overloaded  and  dilapidated \nelectricity distribution network. From 2011 to 2019, the Government of India\u2019s Deen Dayal \nUpadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) scheme4 and its precursors provided \u20b9190 billion in \ngrants and loans to UPPCL to improve the rural medium-voltage distribution network (33 kV and \n11 kV), including separating the 11 kV feeders supplying residential consumers from those \nsupplying agriculture consumers in selected areas. Although these investments have improved \nthe medium-voltage network, the rural distribution network still requires investment of about \u20b960 \nbillion. \n \n7.  The investments under the DDUGJY as well as SAUBHAGYA schemes have led to \nimproved average supply duration in rural Uttar Pradesh from 12\u201313 hours/day before 2017 to \n16\u201318 hours/day in 2019. However, rural electricity supply is still saddled with low performance \nof  distribution  infrastructure,  overuse  of  electricity  by  agriculture  consumers,  low  collection \nefficiency, and poor service to customers. ATC losses stood at 36.8% across Uttar Pradesh in \nFY2019. The poor quality of electricity supply is one of the contributory factors to low socio-\neconomic development in Uttar Pradesh compared to more progressive states in India. The \nproposed project is designed to resolve long-standing technical and financial management issues \nthat continue to significantly hamper electricity sector performance. The project is the first \ninvestment in Uttar Pradesh\u2019s electricity sector financed by an external development partner since \n2001. \n \n8.  Coronavirus disease impacts. As a result of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic, India\u2019s economy is projected to contract by 9% in the fiscal year 2020/21, before \nrebounding sharply with  8.0% growth in FY2021/22, assuming the pandemic wanes in 2021.5 \nWith revenue falling sharply  and expenditure rising to fight the pandemic and support the \neconomy, the fiscal deficit at both central and state level is expected to rise  sharply in FY 2020/21. \nThe government of India has arranged a liquidity injection facility to overcome the short-term \ncashflow  constraints  of  distribution  companies  such  as  UPPCL  due  to  COVID-19-related \neconomic downturn, and to enable the timely payment to generation companies by distribution \ncompanies.  The  proposed  project  will  complement  post-COVID-19  recovery  efforts  by  the \ngovernment by providing (i) short-term benefits through construction-related jobs including to \nmigrant workers who were displaced by containment measures; (ii) medium-term improvement to \nUPPCL\u2019s performance, reducing the need for fiscal subsidies; and (iii) long-term benefits through \nimproved electricity supply, attracting investments to industry and commerce. The fiscal space \ncreated  by  reduced  fiscal  subsidy  requirement  to  the  power  sector  will  enable  the  state \ngovernment to allocate additional resources to poverty reduction and social safety nets. \n \n9.  Sector road map. The Government of India and the Uttar Pradesh government have \nagreed on a sector road map under the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) scheme for \nUPPCL\u2019s financial turnaround through debt restructuring and operational efficiency improvement \nin 2016.6 The UDAY road map consists of (i) a financial restructuring plan to improve UPPCL\u2019s \ndebt sustainability, and (ii) an operational improvement plan. The UDAY road map sets out key \n \n4  Government of India, Ministry of Power. 2020. Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY). India. \n5  ADB. September 2020.

Tripartite Memorandum of Understanding on Ujwal DISCOM \nAssurance Yojana amongst Ministry of Power, Government of India and Government of Uttar Pradesh, and UP \nPower Corporation Limited. New Delhi. \n ", "  3 \nperformance indicators for UPPCL to rectify its structural weaknesses (paras. 4\u20137): (i) reduction \nin ATC losses from 42.6% in FY2016 to 15.0% by FY2020; and (ii) complete elimination of the \ngap between the average cost of supply (ACS) and the average revenue realized (ARR) by \nFY2020, which stood at \u20b90.43/kWh in FY2016.7  \n \n10.  In line with UDAY\u2019s financial restructuring plan, the Uttar Pradesh government took over \n75% of UPPCL\u2019s debt, totaling \u20b9392 billion (as of September 2015, the outstanding debt was \u20b9532 \nbillion). The government then transferred that amount back to UPPCL and its DISCOMs in the \nform of equity (\u20b998 billion), a grant (\u20b9196 billion), and interest-free loans (\u20b998 billion). The \nexercise, completed on 31 March 2017, significantly reduced financial losses in FY2016 and \nFY2017.  \n  \n11.  Under  UDAY\u2019s  operational  improvement  plan,  several  operational  measures,  and \ninvestments to reduce ATC losses are under implementation, along with the measures supported \nunder DDUGJY. UPPCL has entered into an agreement with Energy Efficiency Services Limited \nto install 4 million smart meters in urban areas, of which more than 1.35 million had been installed \nas of 31 July 2020.8 Since 2018, UPPCL has also installed more than 8.5 million conventional \nmeters in rural areas to convert unmetered connections to metered ones; the remaining 2 million \nrural consumers will have metered connections by 31 March 2021. All new consumers connected \nsince 2017 have metered connections that enable the poor to maintain their monthly electricity \nconsumption at an affordable level. All 11 kV feeders are now metered and subjected to regular \nenergy audit to identify feeders with high ATC losses and requiring corrective action. \n \n12.  The above measures reduced ATC losses from 42.6% in FY2016 to 36.8% in FY2019 but \nraised the ACS\u2212ARR gap from \u20b90.43/kWh in FY2016 to \u20b90.74/kWh in FY 2019. The expansion \nof distribution network and addition of large number of rural consumers under SAUBHAGYA \nscheme have adversely impacted the progress in ATC loss reduction and narrowing of ACS\u2212ARR \ngap, while delayed tariff adjustment in 2019 also widened the ACS\u2212ARR gap. In partnership with \nADB, UPPCL intends to undertake investments towards achieving the performance targets \nspecified under UDAY, including (i) completing segregation of 11 kV feeders supplying unmetered \nagriculture consumers from those supplying residential consumers, which is a prerequisite for \nrestricting  the  duration  of  electricity  supply  to  the  separated  feeders  supplying  agriculture \nconsumers; and (ii) converting rural low voltage distribution lines to ABCs to prevent illegal \nconnections.  \n \n13.  The project is designed to enable UPPCL to undertake the investments described in para. \n12 to achieve the key performance indicators of UDAY road map. Implementation of the project, \nincluding  the  financial  management  action  plan  (FMAP)  along  with  other  measures  being \nimplemented as above, is expected to enable UPPCL to reduce ATC losses to 14.9% and \neliminate the gap between ACS and ARR by FY2029, originally targeted to be achieved by \nFY2020  under the  UDAY  memorandum  of  understanding. Improved cost  recovery  of rural \nelectricity supply resulting from the project will enable UPPCL to increase supply duration in rural \nareas.9 The improved electricity supply will expand non-farm employment opportunities for the \nrural poor. Reduced fiscal transfers to the electricity sector because of improved cost recovery \nwill enable the Uttar Pradesh government to allocate additional fiscal resources for poverty \n \n7  The ACS\u2013ARR gap is calculated after considering the state government\u2019s revenue subsidies to UPPCL for supplying \nelectricity below supply cost.  \n8  ADB. 2019.

Manila.  \n9  Power supply to rural areas is limited to 16\u201318 hours/day to contain the financial losses of electricity supply. \n ", "4   \nreduction. The project is also increasing collection efficiency in rural areas by supporting UPPCL \nin  pilot  testing  the  mobilization  of  community  agents,  including  women\u2019s  self-help  groups \n(WSHGs),10 to collect electricity bills.  \n \n14.  Policy framework. The policy and regulatory framework governing the electricity sector \nin India and Uttar Pradesh aims to promote least-cost electricity supply and full cost recovery \nthrough appropriate electricity tariffs, coupled with revenue subsidies from the state government. \nThe Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) regulates the electricity sector in \nUttar Pradesh. UPERC determines the tariffs for different consumer categories to recover ACS \nafter allowing for certain level of cross subsidies from industrial and commercial consumers to \nagriculture and residential consumers. The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to keep the \ntariff below the cost recovery level for residential consumers using less than 100 kWh/month and \nfor agriculture consumers. It has been compensating UPPCL through statutory transfers as \nrequired under the Electricity Act, 2003 to supply electricity to poor households and agriculture \nwith a tariff below the ACS. \n \n15.  UPERC determines the aggregate revenue requirement of UPPCL to provide adequate \ncashflows to meet the eligible expenses based on certain normative efficiency standards and earn \na regulated rate of return on the equity capital. However, because of operational inefficiencies \nand the prevalence of unmetered connections, UPPCL does not operate at the normative \nefficiency standards set by UPERC for ATC losses. The regulatory framework is designed to \nencourage UPPCL to operate at the  normative efficiency standards stipulated by UPERC, \nhowever UPPCL\u2019s underperformance in reducing ATC losses and improving collection efficiency \nis resulting in financial losses. The proposed investments under the project will provide substantial \nassistance to UPPCL to improve its operational performance and meet UPERC\u2019s normative \nefficiency standards. This will enable UPPCL to eliminate the gap between ACS and ARR and \nreduce its financial losses. \n \n16.  Strategic context. Improving the rural electricity distribution and ensuring cost recovery \nin electricity sector are recognized as key developmental challenges in India due to its impacts \non rural economic development and the state\u2019s fiscal sustainability. The proposed project is \nclosely aligned with all three pillars of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India11 on (i) boosting \neconomic competitiveness by expanding infrastructure networks through improved electricity \ndistribution in rural Uttar Pradesh; (ii) providing inclusive access to electricity network to poor and \nvulnerable in rural areas in Uttar Pradesh; and (iii) addressing climate change by reducing the \nwasteful energy and water consumption in agriculture and residential sectors through illegal use \nof electricity. It is also consistent with the recent Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s Sector-\nWide Evaluation of ADB Energy Policy and Program, 2009\u22122019 which recommended ADB to \nincrease  the  support  to  sector  reforms  and  distribution  network  enhancement  to  promote \noperational efficiency improvement. The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan, 2021\u20132023 for India.12  \n  \n17.  Alignment with ADB Strategy 2030.

THE PROJECT  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The project is aligned with the following impact: quality and financial cost recovery in the \npower supply in Uttar Pradesh improved.14 The project will have the following outcome: efficiency, \nreliability, and sustainability of power supply in rural areas improved.15 \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n19.  Output 1: Rural electricity distribution network improved. This will consist of 22 \nsubprojects that will convert 65,000 km of rural voltage distribution network from bare conductors \nto ABC in about 46,000 rural habitations in Uttar Pradesh (each with more than 1,000 people) \nwith a total population of about 70 million. Rural communities, including women, will be trained on \nsafe and efficient use of electricity. These measures will improve the reliability and safety of \nelectricity distribution, and boost cost recovery by discouraging illegal connections.  \n \n20.  Output 2: Systems for separating electricity distribution for agriculture consumers \nfrom residential consumers established. This will consist of 13 subprojects to separate  11 kV \nfeeders  (1,100  feeders  with  a  total  length  of  17,000  km),  that  supply  273,000  agriculture \nconsumers and 2.42 million households. A parallel network of 11 kV feeders, with a total length \nof about 17,000 km, will be built under this component to connect the distribution transformers \nsupplying residential consumers, while using the existing 11 kV feeders to supply agriculture \nconsumers. The project will enable UPPCL to increase the duration of power supply to rural \nhouseholds from 18 hours/day to 22\u201324 hours/day and control the supply duration to agriculture \nconsumers to match the seasonal water requirement. The expected result is reduced wastage of \n \n14 Government of India and Government of Uttar Pradesh. 2017. 24X7 Power For All.

Output 3: Systems for bill collection in rural areas and financial management \nimproved,  and  gender-sensitive  workplaces  created.  The  attached  TA  will  finance  (i) \nsupporting  the  implementation  of  FMAP16 to  improve  UPPCL\u2019s  corporate  governance;  (ii) \nstrengthening the capacity of UPPCL and its subsidiary DISCOMs to manage accounts receivable \nby, for example, reconciling receivable balances, conducting aging analysis, and developing a \nprovisioning policy for the accounts receivable; (iii) developing and pilot testing innovative pro-\npoor bill collection strategies involving active participation of 1,000 rural individuals, including rural \nwomen\u2019s self-help groups (WSHG) as collection agents; and (iv) pilot testing gender-sensitive \nworkplace practices and improving working conditions for contractual workers, especially women, \nin 10 contractors of UPPCL.  \n \n22.  Use of multitranche financing facility. These outputs are best financed by an MFF to \nachieve the outcome.17 The Uttar Pradesh government has a well-structured sector road map and \npolicy framework to improve the quality, reliability, and financial sustainability of electricity supply, \nas described in the UDAY memorandum of understanding (footnote 6). Although the targets set \nin the memorandum of understanding have not been met within the stipulated time frame, UPPCL \nhas  initiated  the  agreed  measures  and  the  Government  of  India  closely  monitors  their \nimplementation. ADB\u2019s long-term engagement through the project will provide financing certainty \nduring the MFF period to UPPCL and the contractors while minimizing the risk to the state \ngovernment of project implementation delays and the resulting financial charges. The MFF \nmodality provides a framework for ADB to monitor the implementation progress of the sector road \nmap, consistency of subprojects with the policy framework, and project implementation over the \nduration of the MFF.  \n \n23.  The project consists of two tranches, time-sliced on  disbursement basis, and divided into \n35 subprojects, of which 26 will be financed by ADB under the MFF and 9 by UPPCL using \ncounterpart funds. The implementing agencies have already awarded the contracts for the nine \nsubprojects (under output 1) to be financed with counterpart funds, using national procurement \nprocedures. Out of the 26 subprojects to be financed by ADB under tranche 1, 13 subprojects will \nsupport output 1 (para. 19) and 13 subprojects will support output 2 (para. 20). Each subproject \ncovers project activities in 3\u20134 administrative districts. The MFF modality using time-sliced, \ndisbursement-based tranches enables the approval of ADB financing under tranche 2 to be linked \nto progress in contract execution and disbursement. \n \n24.  Scope of tranche 1. All 26 ADB-financed subprojects (as described in para. 23) will be \nstarted under tranche 118 and continued under tranche 2 by the same contractor procured under \ntranche 1. This will ensure that tranche 1 project activities will be representative of the overall \nproject, and that tranche 1 will cover 70% of the MFF ceiling amount. The nine subprojects \nfinanced from  counterpart funds,  and  output  3  to  be financed  by  the  attached  TA  will  be \nimplemented and completed during the tranche 1 implementation period. All work contracts and \nconsulting contracts under the project have been tendered, and tender evaluation has been \nsubstantially completed. Upon achieving 75% of disbursement under tranche 1, the government  \n \n16 Financial Management Action Plan is available in the Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n17 Comparison of Financing Modality (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Periodic Financing Request for Tranche 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  7 \nwill submit the periodic financing request for tranche 2 to complete the remaining scope of each \ncontract.  \n \n25.  Innovative  approaches.  The  proposed  pro-poor community  electricity  bill  collection \ninitiatives using WSHGs will facilitate more regular bill collection and increase the income of the \nrural women engaged as collection agents. ADB will assist UPPCL in pilot testing models and \nincentive structures to engage community organizations, including WSHGs, as electricity bill \ncollection agents. Upon successful demonstration, this scheme can be replicated in other parts \nof the country and solve the problem of bill collection in rural areas where use of smart meters is \nnot viable, provide income to women, and increase gender inclusivity in the electricity sector. \n \n26.  Value added by ADB. The technical specification for distribution network rehabilitation \nincorporates the latest performance standards for distribution network design. UPPCL followed \nADB Procurement Guidelines in procuring the contractors. ADB, in consultation with UPPCL, \ndesigned an elaborate two-tier project implementation monitoring and supervision arrangement \nto ensure construction quality. ADB has trained UPPCL staff members on ADB procurement, \nproject implementation, and safeguard requirements. UPPCL is expected to use these good \npractices  in  domestically  financed  investments.  The  FMAP  implementation  will  strengthen \nUPPCL\u2019s financial management capacity and corporate governance. Although UPPCL\u2019s financial \nsituation  is  not  conducive  for  nonsovereign  financing,  improved  financial  performance  and \ncorporate  governance  will  enable  UPPCL  to  explore  nonsovereign  financing  after  project \ncompletion. \n \n27.  Lessons learned. ADB financed power distribution network expansion in the state of \nMadhya Pradesh under two MFF programs.19 They included the separation of 11 kV feeders \nsupplying  agriculture  and  from  those  supplying  residential  consumers.  The  performance \nevaluation report for the first MFF program20 noted a reduction in ATC losses from 42.4% in \nFY2007 to 29.1% in FY2019. It also noted that while technical losses could have been reduced \nthrough the project interventions, the project design did not include a specific component to \nreduce commercial losses and improve bill collection efficiency. The design of the proposed \nproject incorporates these lessons by including components that specifically address collection \nefficiency and commercial loss reduction. \n \nC.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n28.  The project is estimated to cost $800 million, including taxes and duties, physical and price \ncontingencies,  interest,  and  other  charges  during  implementation  (table  2).  Detailed  cost \nestimates of the project and tranche 1 are in the facility administration manual (FAM).21 \n \n \n19 ADB. 2007.

Financing plan. The government has requested an MFF totaling up to $430 million from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance a part of the project. The MFF will consist of two \ntranches,  subject  to  the  government\u2019s  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests, \nexecution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms \nand conditions and undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. Tranche 1 of \nthe MFF will comprise a regular loan of $300 million and will have a 20-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.

Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $263 million and climate adaptation $6 million under \nthe project. ADB will finance 53.75% of mitigation and adaptation costs, respectively, under the \nMFF. Climate mitigation is estimated using the share of financial benefits from the technical loss \nreduction to the project\u2019s overall financial benefits.22 This will contribute to India\u2019s nationally \n \n22 ADB. 2017.

Details are in the climate \nchange assessment.23 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n32.  The Uttar Pradesh government will execute the project through UPPCL, whose four \nsubsidiary companies handling electricity distribution will be the implementing agencies. As the \nexecuting agency and holding company of the implementing agencies, UPPCL will have overall \nresponsibility for project execution, while the implementing agencies will be responsible for day-\nto-day implementation. UPPCL will be assisted by project management consultants, and each \nimplementing agency by a separate project management agent. The summarized terms of \nreference for the project management consultants and the project management agents and the \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in table 4 and described in detail in the FAM \n(footnote 21). \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nMFF availability period  1 January 2021\u201331 December 2029 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2025 (tranche 1), 31 December 2028 (overall project) \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Department of Energy, Government of Uttar Pradesh \n(ii)  Executing agency  UPPCL \n(iii)   implementing agencies,  DVVNL, MVVNL, PVVNL, PuVVNL \n(iv)  Implementation units  UPPCL: Lucknow, 5 staff members supported by project management consultants \nDVVNL: Agra, 5 staff members supported by the PMA \nMVVNL: Lucknow, 5 staff members supported by the PMA \nPVVNL: Meerut, 5 staff members supported by the PMA \nPuVVNL: Varanasi, 5 staff members supported by the PMA \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  26 contracts  $400 million \nQuality- and cost-based selection   5 contracts  $10 million \nRetroactive financing and  Retroactive financing and advance contracting are proposed for works, goods and \nadvance contracting  services, and consultant recruitment.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n33.  UPPCL  will  be  the  executing  and  implementing  agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be \nimplemented from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2022. The TA will (i) pilot test innovative bill \ncollection strategies involving active participation of rural women, including awareness building \n \n23 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \non safe and efficient use of electricity; (ii) establish gender sensitive workplace practices in \nUPPCL; (iii) improve revenue management capacity of electricity DISCOMs by supporting FMAP \nimplementation; and (iv) improve UPPCL group\u2019s project management and safeguard compliance \ncapacity. \n \n34.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,250,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others) and (ii) $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. UPPCL will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and other in-kind contributions. \n \nV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n35.  ADB staff members undertook technical due diligence of the project to establish the need \nto rehabilitate the distribution network by (i) converting the low-voltage network to ABCs, and (ii) \nseparating the 11 kV feeders supplying residential consumers from those supplying agriculture \nconsumers. Electricity  distribution companies in several Indian states have converted their low-\nvoltage networks to ABCs and successfully reduced technical and commercial losses in electricity \ndistribution. Feeder separation enables the DISCOM to control the duration of electricity supply \nto agriculture consumers to limit overconsumption by unmetered agriculture consumers. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n36.  Economic analysis.  ADB staff members conducted the economic analysis of the project \nfollowing ADB guidelines. The analysis evaluated the economic costs and benefits in FY2019 \nconstant  prices  for  FY2020\u2013FY2050.  The  economic  benefits  mainly  come  from  behavioral \nchanges to conserve electricity induced by project interventions as described in the economic \nanalysis.24 The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with- and \nwithout-project scenarios. The project is economically viable with an EIRR of 14.5%, and the \nproject\u2019s expected net present value is \u20b922.6 billion at an economic discount rate of 9.0% per \nyear. The sensitivity of the EIRR was assessed for the following adverse scenarios: (i) insignificant \nconsumer behavior changes, (ii) reduction in the generation cost, and (iii) reduction in willingness \nto pay for electricity. The project\u2019s economic viability is robust under these adverse scenarios. \n \n37.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis of the project followed ADB\u2019s guidelines for \nfinancial management and analysis of projects.25 The analysis did not quantify COVID-19\u2019s \nfinancial and economic impacts as these are expected to last 12\u201318 months and  will not \nsignificantly affect the project over its lifetime. However, sensitivity analysis has been run on \npossible project implementation delays because of COVID-19. The project\u2019s estimated financial \ninternal rate of return in real terms is 10.38% compared with the project\u2019s weighted average cost \nof capital in real terms of 4.0%. ADB staff members performed an analysis to assess the sensitivity \nof the financial internal rate of return to adverse changes in key variables, including (i) less-than-\nexpected decrease in distribution losses, (ii) increase in operation and maintenance costs, and \n(iii) delay in project completion. The results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed the project\u2019s \nfinancial viability under these adverse scenarios. \n \n \n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  11 \n38.  UPPCL\u2019s historical financial performance (FY2015\u2013FY2019) and financial projections \n(FY2020\u2013FY2029) are summarized in the financial analysis (footnote 25). UPPCL\u2019s financial \nlosses were \u20b970 billion and accounts receivable totaled \u20b9689 billion in FY2019. Key factors that \nadversely affect UPPCL\u2019s financial performance include (i) low collection efficiency that has led \nto a buildup of an unsustainable level of accounts receivable, contributing to an operating cash \nflow deficit and inability to timely settle power purchase dues, and compelled UPPCL and its \nsubsidiaries to borrow additional funds for working capital; (ii) distribution loss exceeding the \nnorms set by UPERC for tariff determination, leading to higher power purchase cost which is not \nallowed to be recovered from approved tariff by UPERC; and (iii) a highly leveraged debt position \nthat has made it difficult for UPPCL to service its debt obligations. UPPCL\u2019s weak financial status \nprecludes private financing of the sector. \n \n39.  UPPCL has agreed on key financial covenants in the loan agreement26 to progressively \nimprove its financial health. The covenants will help ensure that UPPCL (i) is able to service its \ndebt obligations in a timely manner; (ii) increases its collection efficiency and progressively brings \ndown its accounts receivable; (iii) receives adequate equity injections from the state government \nto finance capital expenditure, reduce its leverage, and strengthen its financial position; and (iv) \nsubmits annual requests for tariff revision. The project supports various technical measures that \nUPPCL is implementing to reduce ATC losses, reduce the accounts receivable from 498 days of \nrevenue billed in FY2019 to 90 days of revenue billed in FY2029, and lower its power purchase \nrequirements. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n40.  UPPCL\u2019s operations and tariffs are regulated by UPERC. UPPCL subsidiary companies, \nthe project\u2019s implementing agencies, have limited autonomy and UPPCL manages their finances. \nUPPCL has successfully implemented several large projects financed by domestic financial \ninstitutions, such as Power Finance Corporation and Rural Electrification Corporation, under \ngovernment procedures. However, UPPCL\u2019s overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is \nsubstantial because of unreconciled interunit and intercompany balances, the lack of a completed \nfixed assets registry, high levels of accounts receivable, delays in annual external audits, and \ninadequate internal control systems. \n \n41.  A breach of fiduciary management of the Uttar Pradesh State Power Sector Employees \nTrust (UPSPSET)27 was exposed in 2019.  UPSPSET financial assets were allegedly invested in \na  nonbank  financial  institution  without  requisite  approvals  from  UPSPSET  trustees,  and \nUPSPSET might lose a significant amount of its assets because of the liquidation of the nonbank \nfinancial institution. UPPCL has informed ADB that it will take actions to strengthen UPSPSET\u2019s \nfiduciary management and prevent similar incidents. Actions include (i) the election of employee \nrepresentatives  to  the  UPSPSET  board  of  trustees  and  investment  committee,  (ii)  strict \ncompliance with investment norms stipulated by the Government of India for pension funds, and \n(iii) the provision of online information on UPSPSET\u2019s investment performance. \n \n42.  UPPCL with the assistance of ADB prepared an FMAP to improve UPPCL\u2019s corporate \ngovernance and financial management as described in the FMA.28 Key time-bound actions to \nimprove corporate governance include (i) appointing independent directors to the UPPCL board, \n \n26 Loan Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 UPPCL has established UPSPSET to manage the pension fund of its employees, and senior managers of UPPCL \nact as the trustees of UPSPSET. \n28 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12   \n(ii) updating the financial management manuals and training staff, (iii) preparing fixed assets \nregisters, (iv) reconciling interunit and intercompany balances and preventing the recurrence of \nunreconciled balances, and (v) strengthening the finance function by filling vacancies. Key \nelements of the FMAP are included in the framework financing agreement and as loan covenants. \nThrough the attached TA, ADB is helping prepare a policy to recognize the impairment of accounts \nreceivable to enable UPPCL to comply with the Indian Accounting Standards. \n \n43.  UPPCL  has  a  well-developed  procurement  system  based  on  state  government \nprocurement regulations. The procurement processes are adequate to satisfy ADB requirements \nwith  only  minor  adjustments.  The  project  procurement  activities  have  been  substantially \ncompleted following ADB's Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). The overall \nprocurement risk is assessed as moderate. Value for money is achieved through (i) strategic \ncontract packaging, (ii) use of the borrower\u2019s e-procurement system, and (iii) the application of \nlowest evaluated cost as the evaluation criterion. \n \n44.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the central and state governments and UPPCL. ADB undertook integrity due diligence and \nidentified no significant integrity risks, except for the incident described in para. 42. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n45.  Uttar Pradesh\u2019s rural areas are plagued by a lack of jobs, high labor migration to urban \nareas such as Delhi, and water stress because of depleted groundwater. A large proportion of the \nareas\u2019 population lives below the poverty line. The project will improve the quality, reliability, and \nduration of electricity supply in selected rural areas, which would encourage investment in industry \nand commerce, and creation of employment opportunities for the poor. Proposed revisions to the \nElectricity Act, 2003 require the state government to make direct cash transfers to subsidize the \nlifeline consumption of the poor. The direct cash transfers will alleviate the short-term impacts on \nthe poor caused by enforcement of payment discipline and prevention of illegal connections.29 \n \n46.  Gender.  Tranche  1  of the MFF  is  categorized  effective  gender mainstreaming  and \nincorporates specific measures as described in the gender action plan.30 The project will pilot test \nengaging rural women through WSHG as community collection agents and use of incentive-based \ncompensation scheme for the collection agents. The project will develop UPPCL\u2019s institutional \ncapacity  to  promote  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion,  including  establishing  gender-\nresponsive human resource practices for UPPCL staff members and contract workers. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n47.  Following the special MFF requirements in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \nADB, in consultation with UPPCL, prepared a safeguard assessment and review framework \n(SARF).31 The SARF combines the requirements of an environmental assessment and review \nframework,  and  a  resettlement framework  as  the  environmental  and social  impacts  of the \nsubprojects are anticipated to be limited. The SARF provides guidance to UPPCL and the \nimplementing  agencies  on  environmental  and  resettlement  safeguard  due  diligence  to  be \nundertaken during project implementation. ADB has disclosed the SARF on the ADB website. \n \n29 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Safeguard Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  13 \nUPPCL  and  the  implementing  agencies  have  committed  to  implement  the  safeguard \nrequirements. ADB will provide training through the attached TA. \n \n48.  Environment (category B). The potential project impacts will generally be minor and \ntemporary during construction, although health and safety risks to workers and the community \nwill remain during operation and maintenance. ADB, in consultation with UPPCL, has prepared \nan initial environmental examination (IEE)32 based on potential sample project activities following \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and national environment, health, and safety requirements. \nThe IEE has been disclosed on the ADB website. The IEE includes a project environmental \nmanagement  plan  reflecting  international  good  practice.  The  IEE  and  the  environmental \nmanagement plan will be updated if required to reflect any site-specific requirements before \nconstruction work starts. \n \n49.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project involves installing 11 kV distribution \ninfrastructure in the substations without requiring land acquisition. Potential impacts of the \ndistribution infrastructure on involuntary resettlement are not anticipated to be significant. The \ndistribution lines will follow the right-of-way of the roads in most cases, but might require installing \nelectricity poles on private land in some cases (less than 2%) and only after obtaining the consent \nof the private landowners. Impacts will be avoided and mitigated, and compensation will be given \nfor the residual impacts. ADB has prepared a resettlement plan33 for the project based on a \nrepresentative sample survey of project activities for the 11 kV feeder separation component. \n \n50.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project areas are not inhabited by indigenous \npopulations, and the project will not impact indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n51.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nUPPCL does not have experience in implementing a  UPPCL  and  the  project  implementing  agencies  are \nproject financed by a development finance institution.  supported by experienced project management consultants \nCOVID-19 might further exacerbate the project  financed under the loan.
