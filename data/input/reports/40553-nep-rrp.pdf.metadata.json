The  Government  of  Nepal  has  undertaken  initial \nAssessment  environmental  examinations  and  developed  an  environmental \nmanagement  plan.  The  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  consists  of  seven  components  under  three  main \ncategories: (i) energy access, (ii) clean energy, and (iii) capacity \nbuilding. \n \nEnergy Access \nComponent 1: Facilitating Access to Clean Energy. Component 1 \nconsists  of  (i)  constructing  the  Middle  Marsyangdi\u2013Damauli\u2013\nMarsyangdi  transmission  line  and  associated  facilities  to \nstrengthen the evacuation of power from the 70 megawatt (MW) \nMarsyangdi hydropower station, (ii) constructing the second circuit \nof the Butwal\u2013Kohalpur transmission line to improve cross-border \npower import capacity, and (iii) constructing and expanding the \nChapali  and  Matatirtha  grid  substations  and  installation  of \ncapacitor banks to strengthen the capability of the transmission \nnetwork to transfer power. \n \nComponent 2: Energy Access Quality Enhancement. Component \n2 consists of constructing eight primary distribution substations \nand three switching stations to strengthen the electricity system\u2019s \nability to connect new consumers and to improve the quality of \nelectricity supply to existing consumers. \n   \n  Clean Energy \nComponent 3: Clean Energy Plant Improvement. Component 3 \ninvolves  rehabilitating  two  small-scale  run-of-river  hydropower \nplants at Marsyangdi (69 MW) and Gandak (15 MW) to increase \nthe efficiency. \n ", "ii   \nComponent  4:  Supply-Side  Energy  Efficiency  Improvement. \nComponent  4  will  develop  a  pilot  project  to  rebuild  selected \ndistribution  feeders  and  low-voltage  networks  which  have \nunacceptably  high  losses,  using  international  best  practice  to \nreduce both technical and commercial losses.  \n \nComponent  5:  Energy  Efficiency  in  Lighting.  Component  5 \ninvolves distributing approximately 1 million compact fluorescent \nlamps  to  households  and  implementation  support  to  improve \nenergy efficiency in lighting. \n \nComponent 6. Renewable Energy for Street Lighting. Component \n6  consists  of  the  installation  of  1,000  solar  and  solar-wind \nstreetlights  in  Bhaktapur,  Kathmandu,  and  Lalitpur  municipal \nareas to reduce the burden on the main electricity grid. \n \nCapacity Building \nComponent  7:  Component  7  involves  assisting  the  Nepal \nElectricity  Authority  (NEA)  by  providing  expert  services  to \nformulate,  design,  and  implement  public\u2013private  partnerships \n(PPPs) in three identified distribution areas, and capacity building \nand implementation support to the NEA for component 4. \n   \nRationale  Years  of  underinvestment  in  Nepal\u2019s  electricity  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution facilities have led to chronic supply \nshortages and network bottlenecks. As a consequence, the quality \nand reliability of supply provided to end consumers is one of the \npoorest  in  South  Asia.  Electricity  supply  is  characterized  by \nfrequent unscheduled interruptions and long periods of scheduled \nsupply outages. The power sector in Nepal presents a severe \ninfrastructure constraint on economic growth. \n \nThe  Government's  policies  and  actions  on  power  sector \ndevelopment  are  set  out  in  policy  documents  such  as  the \nHydropower  Development  Policy  2001,  the  National  Water \nResources Strategy 2002, and the 10th Five-Year Plan (2002\u2013\n2007). The latest policy document is the Interim Plan of 2008\u2013\n2010. The main strategies contained in the Interim Plan include, \namong other things, (i) promoting good governance and effective \nservice  delivery,  and  (ii)  increasing  investment  in  physical \ninfrastructure including electricity. The targets set for the sector in \nthe long-term (up to 2027) are (i) generation of 4,000 MW of \npower  to  meet  domestic  demand;  (ii)  expansion  of  electricity \nservices to ensure coverage of 75% of the population through the \nnational grid, 20% through isolated small and micro-hydropower \nsystems, and 5% through other alternative energy sources; and \n(iii) increasing per capita annual electricity consumption to 400 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh). Further, existing legislative provisions and \nlaws  are  to  be  modified  to  support  establishing  the  Nepal \nElectricity Regulation Commission and restructuring the NEA to \ncreate an environment more conducive to sector development. ", "iii \n \n   \nThe Government has progressed on the Interim Plan to improve \nsector governance. First, as an interim measure, the Electricity \nTariff Fixation Commission, which was established in 1994 and \nhas recently been inactive, has been reactivated as the economic \nregulator. The legislation to establish an independent regulator \nand restructuring of the NEA is at an advanced stage. Second, the \nNEA  already  has  an  internal  structure  separating  generation, \ntransmission, distribution, electrification, and other functional units \nwhich facilitates efficient management and effective regulation of \nthe NEA by the economic regulator. Making these divisions into \nindependent business units with their own balance sheets will be \nimportant  for  effective  regulation.  Third,  in  2009,  the  Cabinet \nappointed a high-level task force to provide recommendations on \nthe financial restructuring of the NEA. Finalizing and implementing \nthe  financial  restructuring  plan  will  be  an  important  factor  in \nensuring NEA financial sustainability. \n \nThe proposed loan and grants will directly address the urgent \nneeds attributed to the electricity supply crisis in Nepal, through \nrehabilitation  of  two  hydropower  plants,  supply-side  energy \nefficiency,  and  demand-side  management.  The  transmission \nnetwork strengthening will also add supply capacity by increasing \nevacuation  of  power  from  hydropower  stations  in  the  western \nregion and allow increased energy imports across the western \nborder in the short term. \n \nIn the medium term, the transmission network strengthening will \nallow cross-border energy exports, while distribution strengthening \nwill  facilitate  additional  consumer  connections  and  increased \nenergy efficiency. PPPs in distribution will help the NEA to pilot \nprivate sector involvement in improving distribution efficiency.  \n \nThese project interventions will also lead to improved financial \nperformance of the NEA and sustainability of the sector through \nincreased revenues, reduced losses, and improved efficiency. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be increased access to electricity \nacross Nepal.  \n \nThe outcome will be a reliable and energy efficient power supply \nwith increased access and operational efficiency in the project \nareas. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $93.7 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $2.0 million. \n   \n ", "iv   \nFinancing Plan  Project Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Amount  % \nADB (ADF Loan)a  65.0  69.0 \nCCFb   0.3  0.3 \nCEFc   4.2  4.7 \nSubtotal  69.5  74.0 \nGovernment /NEA  24.2  26.0 \nTotal Cost  93.7  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, CCF = \nClimate Change Fund, CEF = Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean \nEnergy Financing Partnership Facility, NEA = Nepal Electricity Authority. \na For components 1\u20134 and 7.  \nb For component 5. \nc For component 6. \nSources: Nepal Electricity Authority and ADB estimates. \n \nA loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n41,127,000 ($65 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources will be provided to finance components 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nGrants of $4,500,000 will be provided, comprising $300,000 from \nthe Climate Change Fund to finance component 5 and $4,200,000 \nfrom the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility to finance component 6, both to be \nadministered by ADB.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will make the loan and grant proceeds available \nTerms  to the NEA and will cause the proceeds to be applied to the \nfinancing of subproject expenditures through separate, subsidiary \nloan and grant agreements, the terms of which will be acceptable \nto ADB. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The Asian Development Fund loan will be utilized up to 31 March \n2015.

A  project  management  unit  will  be  set  up  with \nresponsibility  for  day-to-day  coordination,  monitoring,  and \nreporting on project implementation. ", "v \n \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under the ADB grant will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n \nInternational competitive bidding procedures will be used for all \nthe components, except one contract package under component 3 \n(clean energy plant improvement) and the single package under \ncomponent 5 (energy efficiency in lighting).  \n \nUnder  component  3,  direct  contracting  will  be  adopted  for \nprocurement  of  a  generator  excitation  system  which  will  be \nprocured  from  the  original  supplier  on  a  turnkey  basis.  The \ngenerator excitation system has a powerful impact on generator \ndynamic performance and availability, and accordingly ensures \nquality  of  generator  voltage  and  reactive  power.  Only  the \nequipment  manufactured  by  the  original  supplier  and/or \nmanufacturer will be compatible with and maintain the functional \nguarantees of the original plant. National competitive bidding will \nbe used for selection of the compact fluorescent lamp supplier \nunder component 5. Shopping procedures will be used for the \nprocurement of standard specification goods in component 5 with \nestimated costs of less than $50,000. \n \nAdvance contracting for procurement of equipment and civil works \nand  recruitment  of  consultants  has  been  approved  for  all \ncomponents of the project, subject to these being in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and safeguard \npolicies. The NEA has been informed that approval of advance \ncontracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n   \nConsulting Services  Capacity  building  consulting  services  in  component  7  will  be \nrequired  to  provide  the  NEA  with  support  for  project \nimplementation  works,  including  design,  supervision  of \nconstruction, and management for component 4, and design and \nimplementation of PPPs in distribution. \n \n  The Climate Change Fund will finance national and international \nconsultancy  services  for  implementation  support  under \ncomponent 5. Under component 6, the Multi-Donor Clean Energy \nFund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility will \nfinance national consultancy services for implementation support, \nsupervision, monitoring, and capacity building. \n \nThe NEA will select and engage consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. For component 4, \nindividual experts will be recruited based on biodata submitted in \nspecific terms of reference for assignments. \n   \n ", "vi   \nProject Benefits and  Benefits  will  flow  from  the  incremental  electricity  consumption, \nBeneficiaries  increased  reliability  of  electricity  supply,  and  resource  cost \nsavings. These benefits will be made possible by (i) increased \ncapacity  to  efficiently  and  reliably  evacuate  power  from \ntransmission  (132  kilovolt  [kV])  and  distribution  (33  kV) \nsubstations to serve existing and forecast demand, (ii) reduced \ntechnical and non technical losses at transmission and distribution \nlevels, (iii) increased capacity for cross-border power trade, (iv) \nefficient management, and (v) increased efficiency of electricity \nend use. \n \nThe Project will improve access to an estimated 20,000 additional \nhouseholds  by  strengthening  the  distribution  network.  It  will \nimprove the supply reliability to about 1.5 million of all existing \nconsumers  with  increased  power  import  capacity,  additional \ngeneration  capability,  efficient  management,  energy  efficiency, \nand demand management. \n \nThe  demand-side  management  components  of  the  project  will \nresult in the reduction of an estimated 15,000\u201320,000 tons (t) of \ncarbon  dioxide  (CO )  emissions  annually.  Human  safety\u2014\n2\nparticularly  of  women  and  children  using  the  main  streets  in \nBhaktapur,  Kathmandu,  and  Lalitpur  will  also  improve  due  to \nbetter street lighting. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  There is an overall risk to the Project from a potential deterioration \nof the political situation with possible changes in government and \nprolonged and disruptive political transition. This could impede \nproject implementation and the pace of the proposed institutional \nand  policy  reforms  in  the  sector.  However,  given  the  critical \nimportance of improving power supply and the efficiency of the \npower sector in the face of the acute power shortages the country \nhas  been  facing,  the  proposed  project  activities  and  reform \nactions should be high on any incoming government's agenda. \nAlso,  given  the  nature  of  the  proposed  reforms  (financial \nrestructuring of the NEA, strengthening the regulatory authority, \nand  internally  separating  the  NEA's  operations)  and  project \nactivities (expanding transmission and distribution lines, improving \nenergy  efficiency,  and  developing  renewable  energy),  political \ndisturbances  such  as  those  being  experienced  currently  are \nunlikely to have any major adverse implications for effective and \ntimely implementation. However, the fragile political situation and \nweak  governance  situation  does  pose  a  risk  to  procurement \nactivities under the Project. Special efforts to closely monitor the \nproject and procurement activities along with regular and intensive \npolicy  dialogue  on  the  proposed  reform  actions  will  help  to \nmitigate these potential risks. \n \nThe  other  risks  specific  to  the  Project  are  (i)  delayed  project \nimplementation, (ii) inadequate capacity to implement the Project, \n(iii) failure to resolve safeguard issues in a timely manner, and (iv) ", "vii \n \nthe impact of external macroeconomic and financial cost factors \nand revenue projections on the viability of the Project. \n \nAdequate measures have been taken to ensure a high level of \nproject readiness through training of executing agency staff and \nthe approval of advance contracting. Potential safeguard issues \nhave  been  mitigated  through  preparation  and  early \nimplementation  of  environmental  management  plans  and \nresettlement plans. The sensitivity analyses carried out in relation \nto the economic and financial analysis indicate that the rates of \nreturn are robust. \n \nADB is preparing a capacity development technical assistance \nproject  for  the  Government  and  the  NEA  to  strengthen  their \ncapacity in power system planning, regulation, best practices in \nrural electrification, and materials management. ADB support will \nalso be provided for the Government to finalize the NEA financial \nrestructuring  plan  in  the  form  of  consultancy  services  to  the \nCabinet-appointed  committee  through  the  ongoing  small-scale \nproject preparatory technical assistance.  \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of grants to be provided by the Climate Change Fund1 \nand the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund2 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nto Nepal for the Energy Access and Efficiency Improvement Project. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Background, Performance Indicators, and Analysis \n2.  The power sector in Nepal, with its vast hydropower potential, could be expected to \ncontribute to the country's economic development in a significant way. Instead, the years of \nunderinvestment in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution facilities have led to \nchronic supply shortages and network bottlenecks. The quality and reliability of supply provided \nto end-consumers are among the poorest in South Asia. An analysis of these issues is provided \nin Appendix 2. \n \n3.  The total installed generation capacity of Nepal was 615 megawatts (MW) at the end of \n2008 and the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) owned 75% of it. The transmission network, \nwhich is almost totally owned and operated by the NEA, has 1,900 kilometers (km) of 132 \nkilovolt (kV) and 66 kV lines. The grid electrification rate is 33% of households, and 98% of \nthese 1.5 million electricity consumers are served by the NEA. The private sector is responsible \nfor 25% of installed generation capacity; a private sector distribution company and community \norganizations serve about 2% of consumers.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Infrastructure \n4.  Nepal\u2019s  electricity  generation  mix  is  dominated  by  run-of-river  and  daily  storage \nhydropower plants, which represent around 80% of total installed capacity. The dominance of \nthese plants has led to periods of acute capacity and energy shortages during the dry season. \nIn FY2008, an estimated 430 gigawatt-hours (GWh) equivalent of planned power interruptions \nwere carried out. The transmission infrastructure is in moderate condition and related energy \nlosses are estimated at around 6%. While timely commissioning of certain new transmission \nlines is critical to maintaining system stability, inadequate transmission capacity is hampering \nfurther private investment in power generation. Several independent power producers (IPPs) \nhave been unable to undertake new power development initiatives because of the difficulties in \npower  evacuation.  The  grid  electricity  coverage  in  the  country  is  limited  to  only  33%  of \nhouseholds. Technical and commercial losses in the distribution networks have been high for \nmany years due to underinvestment. \n \n2.  Financial Sustainability of the Sector \n5.  In recent years the NEA\u2019s financial performance has been poor, due to energy costs and \noperating  expenses  increasing  faster  than  revenues.  It  has  only  been  able  to  meet  cash \n                                                 \n1  Administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2  Contributors to the fund are the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden; the fund is administered by \nADB. ", "2 \noperating expenses and maintain ongoing capital investment by deferring payment of interest \nduring construction, debt service, and royalty payments. Thus, the NEA\u2019s finances require \nsubstantive restructuring, principally by converting some Government loans to equity, reducing \nGovernment onlending rates on loans, and utilizing royalties paid to the Government to partly \ncover the NEA\u2019s rural electrification losses. The Government is examining the restructuring \noptions for the NEA, and has given a firm commitment that action will be taken. The World Bank \nhas already provided capacity development technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the financial \nmanagement system of the NEA with necessary support for hardware, software, and related \ntraining.  \n \n6.  The financial performance of the sector can also be improved by full exploitation of \nhydropower potential and related investment in transmission and distribution networks which will \nincrease revenue. Creating an effective regulatory environment by developing capacity and \noperational  independence  within  the  Electricity  Tariff  Fixation  Commission  (ETFC)  and \nDepartment  of  Electricity  Development  (DOED)  will  substantially  contribute  to  increased \nperformance in the sector through consumer tariffs which reflect costs. The investments in loss \nreduction and efficiency improvements through demand- and supply-side management will also \nenhance sector performance by reducing the cost of supply. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has been providing assistance to implement these measures through its technical and \ninvestment support, including this proposed Project. \n \n3.  Private Sector Participation \n7.  Nepal\u2019s first official hydropower policy in 1992, which was followed by the Electricity Act \n1992, provided a provisional legal and policy basis for private participation in the power sector. \nSoon IPPs began setting up and operating small power plants. The build-own-operate-transfer \nmodality laid out in the Hydropower Policy 1992 still provides the framework for public\u2013private \npartnerships  (PPPs)  in  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Of  the  total  installed \ngeneration capacity of 617 MW, 17 IPPs contribute 156 MW. The NEA has signed power \npurchase  agreements  with  22  additional  IPPs  totaling  68  MW  of  capacity,  which  is  under \nconstruction. In the transmission subsector, 107 km of transmission lines are privately owned. In \naddition  to  one  large  privately  owned  electricity  distribution  company  supplying  23,000 \nconsumers, there are many community-managed distribution schemes scattered across the \ncountry. \n \n8.  To increase private sector participation in generation, ADB initiated the ongoing TA on \nPPPs  in  hydropower  development 3  This  TA  has  three  main  objectives:  (i)  providing \nrecommendations for an enabling framework for private sector participation, (ii) assisting and \nadvising the bidding process, and (iii) capacity building in the licensing authority\u2014the DOED. \n \n4.  Government Policies and Sector Road Map \n9.  In  July  2007  the  National  Planning  Commission  released  the  3-year  interim  plan \ncovering 2008\u20132010, identifying the major development interventions in Nepal. The long-term \nvision for the power sector is the utilization of water resources to meet domestic power demand \nand the export of surplus power to increase the country\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. The \ntargets set for the sector in the long-term (up to 2027) are (i) generating 4,000 MW of power to \nmeet domestic demand; (ii) expanding electricity services to ensure coverage of 75% of the \npopulation  through  the  national  grid,  20%  through  isolated  small  and  micro-hydropower \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Power Sector. Manila. \n ", "3 \nsystems, and 5% through other alternative energy sources; and (iii) increasing per capita annual \nelectricity consumption to 400 kWh. \n \n10.  Some of the key strategies adopted to achieve these targets are (i) introducing effective \nregulation of generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and related businesses; (ii) \nadopting a one-stop-shop approach to encourage investments in hydropower development to \nallow  investors  to  obtain  all  approvals  from  a  single  agency;  (iii)  consistent  efforts  in  the \nexpansion of electricity generation potential; (iv) expanding transmission capacity, targeting both \nlocal consumption and export potential; and (v) strengthening and expanding the electricity \ndistribution system. \n \n11.  Existing  legislation  is  being  modified  to  support  establishing  the  Nepal  Electricity \nRegulation Commission and restructuring the NEA and other sector participants for efficient \nsector operation. Electricity tariffs will be rationalized, taking into account the cost of supply and \nthe need to ensure lifeline tariffs or other measures to protect the poor. The transmission \nsystem  will  be  strengthened  to  ensure  effective  transmission  of  new  hydropower-derived \nelectricity to demand centers. Electricity losses will be minimized. Consumers\u2019 interests will be \nprotected by ensuring that electricity services are of adequate quality and are dependable and \neasily accessible. Appropriate pricing signals will be sent to consumers to encourage efficient \nelectricity consumption. \n \n5.  Policy Dialogue \n12.  Effective Regulatory Intervention. The ETFC has not given approval to the NEA to \nrevise consumer electricity tariffs since 2001, and hence tariffs have declined by around 40% in \nreal terms. Presently, the NEA\u2019s average cost of supply is greater than the average consumer \ntariff, which seriously affects its ability to invest in and maintain its assets. This issue, among \nothers,  highlights  the  need  for  effective  regulation  in  the  power  sector.  ADB  has  ongoing \ndialogue with the Government on the new electricity act, which provides for the establishment of \nan independent electricity regulator, and on the interim arrangement for the ETFC to function as \nthe economic regulator. ADB will provide TA support for capacity building in the ETFC and in \nthe  new  regulatory  agency.  The  TA  will  also  help  the  NEA  to  respond  to  regulatory \nrequirements.  \n \n13.  System Loss Reduction. Energy losses in the NEA\u2019s transmission and distribution \nnetworks are significant. Systemwide losses are approximately 25% of generation. Inadequate \nattention to regular maintenance in low-voltage distribution networks, overextension of medium \nvoltage and low-voltage lines, and pilferage contribute to the high loss levels. ADB\u2019s dialogue \nwith the Government on system losses focuses on (i) the need for independent regulation to \nenforce realistic loss reduction targets for the NEA, and (ii) the need to design and maintain \nmedium  voltage  and  low-voltage  networks  so  that  technical  and  commercial  losses  are \nminimized. \n \n14.  Hydropower Development. Despite the large hydropower potential, Nepal experiences \nmajor generation capacity constraints. This potential can be harnessed to at least satisfy the \nlocal demand by establishing small and medium-sized plants by removing barriers to their \ndevelopment. ADB has ongoing TA to provide recommendations to overcome these barriers. \nThese include creating an enabling framework for private sector participation and developing \nrelated  capacity  within  the  licensing  authority.  ADB  will  have  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment to implement those recommendations.  \n \n ", "4 \n6.  ADB\u2019s Power Sector Strategy for Nepal \n15.  ADB\u2019s power sector strategy in Nepal is aligned with Nepal's Three Year Interim Plan \n(2008\u20132010)4. Further, it is based on all four pillars of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \n2010\u22122014 5 :  (i)  broad-based  and  inclusive  high  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social \ndevelopment, (iii) governance and state strengthening, and (iv) climate change and environment \nsustainability. ADB\u2019s assistance for the power sector in Nepal will have six main priorities: (i) \nimproving access to electricity, (ii) increased energy efficiency, (iii) clean power development, \n(iv) regional cooperation, (v) strengthening sector governance, and (vi) promoting private sector \nparticipation. \n \n7.  Lessons Learned \n16.  In the past, the efficiency and sustainability of ADB-funded projects6 were affected by the \npolitical instability leading to lack of policy, institutional reforms, and capacity constraints in the \npower sector. With the improved political environment, ADB has been assisting to address \nthese issues through its TA. The proposed project and the proposed capacity development TA \nalso  provide  assistance  in  this  regard.  The  past  ADB-financed  power  projects  suffered \nimplementation  delays  due  to  failures  in  meeting  loan  effectiveness  conditions  and  slow \nrecruitment of consultants and procurement. Once the contracts were awarded, implementation \ngenerally proceeded smoothly, except for one project component that encountered difficulties in \nacquiring land for a substation and obtains agreement on the compensation for the transmission \nline right of way. The lessons learned have been considered in the design and preparation of \nthe proposed project to avoid implementation delays. A procurement capacity assessment of \nthe NEA (as the executing agency) was conducted, and on-the-job training provided during due \ndiligence to ensure the early preparation of consultants recruitment documentation and bid \ndocuments.  The  proposed  project  components  are  now  at  a  high  level  of  readiness  for \nimplementation, and advance contracting has been approved. Environmental management and \nresettlement plans have been prepared and the sites for project components and routing of \ntransmission lines have been designed to avoid densely populated and ecologically sensitive \nareas  to  minimize  environmental  and  involuntary  resettlement  problems.  Impractical  and \nunrealistic loan effectiveness conditions, in terms of actions and time frame, have been avoided. \n \n8.  External Assistance \n17.  The  power  sector  in  Nepal  has  received  assistance  from  various  international \ndevelopment partners. In addition to ADB being a major development partner in the power \nsector, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the World Bank have been \nmajor sources of external funding to the sector, focusing on sector reforms, strengthening of \nfinancial  management  systems,  generation,  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  generation \nfacilities,  and  development  of  renewable  energy  resources.  In  addition,  bilateral  donors \nincluding  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (Credit  Institute  for  Reconstruction  [KfW]),  United \nStates Agency for International Development (USAID), Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische \nZusammenarbeit (GTZ), Danish International Development Agency, and Norwegian Agency for \nDevelopment Cooperation have been active in the power sector. Further, the European Union, \nKuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, Saudi Fund for Development, United Nations \nDevelopment  Programme,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  Department  for \n                                                 \n4 National Planning Commission, Nepal. 2008. Three Year Interim Plan. Kathmandu \n5 ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy Nepal 2010\u22122014. Manila \n6 ADB. 2009. Evaluation Study: Nepal Delivering Assistance in a Challenging Environment. Manila \n ", "5 \nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  Finnish  Department  for  International \nDevelopment, Government of France, and Japan International Cooperation Agency have all \nprovided TA to the power sector. A description of external assistance to the Nepal power sector \nin the past is given in Appendix 3. \n \n  9.  Rationale for the Project \n \n18.  The proposed loan will address urgent needs in the Nepal power sector by providing \nimmediate relief to the supply crisis in Nepal directly through rehabilitation of two hydropower \nplants, supply-side energy efficiency, and demand-side management (DSM). The component on \ntransmission network strengthening will assist increased evacuation of power from hydropower \nstations in the western region and increased cross-border energy imports in the short term. In \nthe medium term, the transmission network strengthening will allow cross-border energy exports \nwhile distribution strengthening will facilitate additional consumer connections and increased \nenergy efficiency. PPPs in distribution will help the NEA to pilot private sector involvement in \nimproving  distribution  efficiency.  These  project  interventions  will  lead  to  improved  financial \nperformance of the NEA and sustainability of the sector \n  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The impact of the Project will be increased access to clean electricity across the country. \nThe Project will address major infrastructure barriers to improved access by investments in the \ntransmission system, generation rehabilitation, distribution system, and efficiency in supply and \ndemand which will increase supply capacity and operational efficiency. \n \n20.  The Project\u2019s outcome will be reliable and energy efficient power supply with increased \naccess and operational efficiency in the project areas.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n21.  The ADB loan will support investments under seven main components each consisting \nof one or more subprojects. The proposed new transmission and distribution components form \npart of the least-cost network expansion plans of the NEA planning process based on the \nnational  demand  forecast  produced  by  the  NEA.  The  proposed  generation  rehabilitation \ncomponent forms part of the optimal generation rehabilitation plans of the NEA. Best practice \ndesign standards and construction techniques\u2014including adaptations to counter climate change \nincidents, e.g., flood and extreme weather\u2014will be applied to all investments. \n \n(i)  Component 1: Facilitation of access to clean energy. This component will \ninclude the following subprojects: \n(a)  Middle  Marsyangdi\u2013Marsyangdi,  Dumre\u2013Damauli  132  kV \ntransmission  line  and  related  substation  works.  This  subproject \ninvolves construction of the transmission line and the related substation \nthat  will  improve  the  security  of  power  evacuation  from  the  newly \nconstructed  70  MW  Middle  Marshyangdi  hydropower  station,  and  will \nprovide general reinforcement through the Damauli substation. \n(b)  Butwal\u2013Kohalpur 132 kV transmission line. This 200 km line section is \npart  of  the  400  km  Mahendranagar\u2013Butwal  transmission  line.  This \nsubproject involves stringing a transmission line along the second circuit \n ", "6 \nof the existing 132 kV line built on double circuit towers. Upgrading of the \nentire  Mahendranagar\u2013Butwal  transmission  line  could  increase  cross-\nborder trade by up to 100 MW.  \n(c)  Construction  of  Chapali  substation.  This  subproject  involves \nconstruction  of  the  Chapali  grid  substation,  extending  the  Lainchaur \nsubstation,  and  laying  an  underground  cable  between  Lainchaur  and \nChabel required to strengthen the transmission capability in the central \nregion. \n(d)  Expansion  of  Matatirtha  substation.  The  western  part  of  the \nKathmandu  valley  is  relatively  well  served  with  132  kV  transformer \ncapacity. However, the area experiences poor power supply due to the \nload imposed upon, and the length of, 11kV feeders, resulting in frequent \nfeeder tripping and high losses. This subproject will reduce the average \n11 kV feeder length by converting the Matatirtha 132 kV switching station \ninto a full 132 kV substation. \n(e)  Installation of capacitor banks. This subproject involves installation of \napproximately 220 megavolt-ampere reactive (MVAr7) capacitor banks for \nreactive power compensation at eight transmission substations, improving \nthe voltage profile of the transmission network. \n \n(ii)  Component 2: Energy access quality enhancement. This component consists \nof constructing eight new 33/11 kV, 6/8 MVA primary distribution substations and \nthree new 11 kV switching stations to strengthen the electric system\u2019s ability to \nconnect  new  consumers  and  to  enhance  the  quality  of  electricity  supply  to \nexisting  consumers.  These  new  substations  will  reduce  the  incidence  of \nscheduled  and  unscheduled  power  supply  interruptions,  reduce  distribution \nsystem losses, and improve power supply quality. \n(iii)  Component 3: Clean energy plant improvement. This component involves \nrehabilitating two run-of-river hydropower plants at Marsyangdi (69 MW) and \nGandak (15 MW) to increase the efficiency of their electricity generation and \nreduce self-consumption of electricity. As a result, an estimated additional 4 \ngigawatt-hours (GWh) of energy will be supplied each year to the power system.  \n(iv)  Component 4: Supply-side energy efficiency improvement. This component \nwill develop a pilot project to rebuild selected distribution feeders and low-voltage \nnetworks with unacceptably high losses, using international best practice for \ndesign, construction, and commercial operation, to reduce both technical and \ncommercial  losses  in  the  Kathmandu  valley.  Sixteen  11  kV  feeders  and \ndownstream  low-voltage  networks  with  unacceptably  high  losses  have  been \nidentified by the NEA. This pilot project will become a model network that can be \nreplicated across Nepal. \n(v)  Component  5:  Energy  efficiency  in  lighting.  This component involves the \ndistribution of 1 million compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) to households and \nCFL program implementation support to improve energy efficiency in lighting. \nThe project will target domestic consumers in all electrified areas. It is expected \nthat this program will free up a minimum of 10 MW of power plant capacity and \npotentially  reduce  23  GWh  of  annual  consumption.  Assistance  will  also  be \nprovided for a public awareness campaign, an implementation consultant (local), \nand resources to establish a demand-side management (DSM) unit in the NEA.  \nAdditional details of this component are provided in Appendix 10. \n                                                 \n7 The reactive power capacity of the capacitor banks.  \n ", "7 \n(vi)  Component 6: Renewable energy for street lighting. This component consists \nof installation of 1,000 solar and solar-wind streetlights in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, \nand Kathmandu municipal areas to reduce street lighting demand on the main \nelectricity grid. The activities include purchase of solar and solar-wind hybrid \nstreet lighting systems, and replacing/installing and setting up a system to ensure \nproper maintenance through the NEA. It is estimated that this subproject will \nreduce peak load demand by about 0.2 MW and save about 700 megawatt-hours \n(MWh) per year. Consulting services will be provided to assist the NEA with \nprogram design and implementation.  Additional details of this component are in \nAppendix 11. \n(vii)  Component 7: Capacity building. This component involves providing the NEA \nwith expert services to formulate, design, and implement pilot PPP projects in \nthree  identified  distribution  areas.  This  will  involve  reviewing  legislation, \nidentifying appropriate PPP modalities, identifying pilot areas, preparing legal \nagreements,  developing  bid  documents,  making  recommendations  for \nimplementation, developing an implementation plan, monitoring the bid process, \nand overseeing final implementation. This component will also assist the NEA in \nimplementation support for component 4. \n \nC.  Special Features \n22.  Supply-Side Energy Efficiency. The high network losses represent a heavy burden in \na power system with limited supply. Relieving this burden is the least-cost means of reducing \nthe demand and supply gap. The Project will tackle this problem by addressing inefficiencies on \nthe supply side and introducing long-term, replicable solutions. The \u201cmodel networks\u201d concept \nwill demonstrate that loss minimization in distribution networks is a function of planning, design, \nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance.  When  best  practices  of  these  are  adhered  to, \nparticularly in the often-ignored low-voltage parts of the network, more efficient networks will \nresult. Clean Development Mechanism benefits will also be explored. \n \n23.  Demand-Side  Management.  DSM will be adopted to reduce energy consumed for \nlighting, which represent a significant component of total electricity demand at the peak load \ntimes. This involves introducing energy efficient lighting for households and solar or solar-wind \nbased  street  lighting  on  a  pilot  scale.  DSM  efforts  will  reduce  electricity  flowing  through \nupstream networks, which will reduce losses and free up generation output for other productive \nuses. Implementation and capacity building support will also be provided for this component. \nFurther, Clean Development Mechanism benefits under these subprojects will be explored. \n \n24.  Strategic  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships  Scheme.  Under  the  Project,  strategic \nfranchising partnerships with the private sector will be developed in selected urban areas to \nreduce distribution losses and improve the quality of service to consumers. If successful, this \nscheme will be extended into other semi-urban and urban areas across Nepal. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n25.  The project investment cost is estimated at $93.7 million, including taxes and duties of \n$2.0 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, and interest and other \ncharges during implementation.

Financing Plan \n26.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $65 million equivalent from its \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund [ADF]) to finance components 1, 2, 3, 4, \nand 7 of the Project. Component 5 of $2.0 million will be financed by the Climate Change Fund \n($0.3 million) and by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund ($1.7 million) under the Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility. Component 6 ($2.5 million) will be financed by the Multi-Donor \nClean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. The Government \nand the NEA will finance $24.2 million equivalent.

The \nADF loan and the grants from the Climate Change Fund and the Multi-Donor Clean Energy \n ", "9 \nFund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  will  be  transferred  by  the \nGovernment to the NEA as a grant. A summary financing plan is provided in Table 2.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Executing Agencies and Project Management \n28.  The NEA will be the executing agency with overall responsibility for the execution of all \ncomponents of the Project. A project management unit, headed by senior officers, will be set up \nby  October  2009  specifically  for  the  Project  for  necessary  coordination,  monitoring,  and \nreporting on the day-to-day project implementation activities with the concerned groups of the \nNEA.  Necessary  guidance  and  training  on  the  latest  ADB  procurement  guidelines  and \nprocedures  has  been  provided  to  the  NEA.  Based  on  the  assessment  of  its  procurement \ncapacity,  the  NEA  is  considered  to  be  fully  capable  of  implementing  the  Project.  The \nprocurement  capacity  assessment  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  The  implementation \nstructure is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n29.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, including procurement and construction \nactivities, from 2010 to 2014. The project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 5. \nComponents 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 will be completed by 30 September 2014 and the corresponding \nfunds will be utilized for a period ending on 31 March 2015. Components 5 and 6 will be \ncompleted by 30 September 2012 and the corresponding funds will be utilized for a period up to \n31 March 2013. \n \n3.  Procurement \n30.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). With the exception of \none contract package under component 3 (clean energy plant improvement) and procurement \nunder component 5 (energy efficiency in lighting), international competitive bidding procedures \nwill be used for all contracts (11 turnkey and 8 supply contracts). While eight packages for \ncomponents 2 and 4 will be based on single-stage:one-envelope bidding procedures, all the \nother 11 packages will follow single-stage:two-envelope procedures. \n \n31.   Under component 3, direct contracting will be adopted for procurement of a generator \nexcitation  system,  which  has  a  powerful  impact  on  generator  dynamic  performance  and \navailability, and accordingly ensures quality of generator voltage and reactive power. Only the \nequipment  manufactured  by  the  original  supplier/manufacturer  will  be  compatible  with  and \nmaintain the functional guarantees of the original plant. Therefore, it will be procured from the \noriginal supplier on a turnkey basis. National competitive bidding will be used for selection of the \nCFL supplier under component 5. Shopping procedures will be used for the procurement of \nstandard specification goods in component 5 with estimated costs less than $50,000. The CFL \nsupplier will be paid by the NEA (who will in turn be reimbursed by ADB) based on the quantity \nof CFLs distributed to electricity consumers through its distribution network and documentary \nevidence of such distribution. The procurement plan including an indicative list of contract \npackages is in Appendix 6. \n \n ", "10 \n4.  Advance Contracting \n32.  In order to expedite implementation, the NEA has requested ADB to approve advance \ncontracting actions for procurement of works, goods, and services subject to them being in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time) and safeguard policies. ADB has already approved \nadvance contracting and has informed the NEA that approval of advance contracting does not in \nany  way  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  The  project  readiness  schedule  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n \n5.  Consulting Services  \n33.  For component 4 (distribution loss reduction), the NEA requested consulting services to \nassist  its  implementation  of  the  project.  The  NEA  will  select  and  engage  one  individual \ninternational consultant and one individual national consultant based on biodata submitted in \nresponse to terms of reference for the assignment. The process of advance contracting action \nfor recruiting consultants has been initiated by the NEA as normal procedures. These consulting \nservices are part of component 7. \n \n34.  Component  7  also  includes  capacity  building  and  implementation  support  for  the \nintroduction of distribution PPPs. The NEA will select and engage one individual international \nconsultant and one individual national consultant based on biodata submitted in response to \nterms of reference for the assignment. The NEA will also engage a national legal consultant to \nassist with a review of legislation and with legal drafting. The NEA has initiated the process of \nadvance contracting action for recruiting consultants as normal procedures.  \n \n35.  The Climate Change Fund grant will provide finance for one national consultant and one \ninternational individual consultant for implementation support under component 5. The Multi-\nDonor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility grant will \nprovide finance for two individual national consultants for implementation support, supervision, \nmonitoring, and capacity building under component 6. The ADF grant will provide finance for \ninternational consulting services for component 7. \n \n36.  The NEA will select and engage consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Supplementary \nAppendix H. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n37.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  and  the  NEA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the grant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the NEA and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. Table 3 summarizes major \nproject-specific governance measures.  \n \n \n ", "11 \nTable 3: Governance Measures \nArea  Measure \nProcurement  (i)  Use of ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) \n(ii)  Use of ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents and standard request for proposal \ndocuments for procurement and recruitment of consultants \n(iii) Project management unit headed by a senior officer directly reporting to the \nmanaging director of the NEA  \n(iv) Bid specifications and packaging to be prepared to ensure maximum competition \nunder international competitive bidding procedures \n(v)  Information on procurement to be disclosed on a project website. \nFinancial  (i)   Measurable financial performance indicators for the NEA  \nManagement  (ii)   Regular monitoring of expenditures, other financial transactions, and safe custody of \nand Audit  project-financed assets by the accounting and control systems of the NEA  \n(iii) Expanded use of advanced financial management systems to ensure efficient and \naccountable financial management \n(iv) Ensure scoped internal audit of the NEA including revenue audit and internal audit \nreports to the audit committee of the NEA board \n(v)  Financial statements to be audited by external auditors acceptable to ADB and \nregularly published and reported to the shareholders \nInstitutional  (i)  The NEA board will delegate operational authority to its business units. \n/Corporate  (ii)  Business units will be operated as independent units with their accounts and assets \nGovernance  fully separated facilitating regulation by the ETFC and its successor. \n(iii) Reconstituted ETFC will entertain tariff filing by the NEA along the lines of its \nbusiness unit structure. \nAnticorruption  (i)  ADB to review and examine any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the Project  \n(ii)  Information on the Project to be made public through publication of leaflets and their \navailability in the provinces and districts within which the Project operates \nGrievance  (i)  A grievance redress mechanism to be established to address issues relating to \nReview   project implementation \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ETFC = Electricity Tariff Fixation Commission, NEA = Nepal Electricity Authority. \nSources:  Asian Development Bank and Nepal Electricity Authority \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n38.  Disbursement  procedures  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements agreed upon by \nthe  Government,  the  NEA,  and  ADB.  Imprest  fund  procedures  will  be  used  to  facilitate \ndisbursement for investment in component 5 funded by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund \nunder the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. The imprest account will be established \nand managed by the NEA. The ceiling of the initial advance of the imprest account 8 will not \nexceed ADB\u2019s estimated share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through the \nimprest  account  for  the  next  6  months,  or  10%  of  the  grant  amount,  whichever  is  lower. \nstatement of expenditure procedures may be used for reimbursement under all the components \nand liquidating/replenishing advances under component 5. The statement of expenditure ceiling \nwill  be  $50,000  for  individual  payments  applicable  to  reimbursement  and  imprest  fund \nprocedures. Financial management capacity assessment and previous experience shows that \nthe NEA has adequate capacity and controls to implement these procedures. \n \n                                                 \n8 Bank charges for imprest account operations will be charged to the Asian Clean Energy Fund.  \n ", "12 \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n39.  The accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the Project will be \nestablished in accordance with accounting principles and practices satisfactory to ADB. The \nNEA will maintain separate accounts for the different components. Within 6 months of the close \nof the financial year, the NEA will submit (i) annual project accounts, with detailed descriptions \nof the sources of receipts and expenditures; (ii) annual financial statements comprising an \nincome statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and related notes to the financial \nstatements and consolidated for all operations; and (iii) procedures for the imprest accounts \nand/or statement of expenditures. The auditors will also prepare a memorandum on issues \nidentified during the audit process, to be submitted with the respective reports. The auditors will \nbe required to provide an opinion on the NEA's compliance with ADB\u2019s financial covenants. For \ncomponent  5,  the  NEA  will  report  to  ADB  every  quarter,  without  limitation,  on  the  overall \nportfolio performance. If requested by ADB, the NEA will provide ADB with certification that ADB \nfunds have been used to provide CFLs to households and that those who received funds \nactually purchased CFLs under this component. The use of imprest accounts and statement of \nexpenditure will also be part of the annual audit, as will a separate opinion on the use of imprest \naccounts and statement of expenditure. \n \n9.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n40.  The NEA will prepare progress reports for its respective parts and submit these to ADB \nwithin 30 days from the end of each quarter. Each report will provide a narrative description of \n(i) progress made during the period, (ii) changes in the implementation schedule, (iii) problems \nor difficulties encountered, (iv) the performance of the project implementation consultants, and \n(v) the work to be carried out in the next period. The report will also include summary financial \naccounts for each component, consisting of project expenditures for the year to date and total \nexpenditure to date. Performance will be evaluated based on indicators and targets stipulated in \nthe design and monitoring framework. \n \n10.  Project Review \n41.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of loan approval. ADB will review the \nimplementation and operation of the projects based on the quarterly progress reports and meet \nwith the NEA and the Government twice a year to discuss the progress of each part of the \nProject and any changes to implementation arrangements or remedial measures that need to be \ntaken. A midterm review will be carried out 2 years after loan effectiveness, focusing on the \nengineering, resettlement, and environmental aspects of the investment program, and reviewing \nthe financial status of the NEA. The NEA will submit a project completion report to ADB within \n3 months of physical completion of the projects. \n \nIV.  CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT \n42.  ADB has been providing capacity development support to the Nepal power sector on a \ncontinuous basis, addressing its needs from time to time. Table 4 provides a description of the \nADB assistance for capacity building, both ongoing and planned, under the proposed loan. \n ", "13 \n \nTable 4: Capacity Development Support \nItem  Area of Support \nPublic\u2013Private  (i) Hydropower development: Assist DOED review policies, identify \nPartnership  projects, prepare and issue bidding documents, award contracts, and \nmanage contracts  \n(ii) Distribution franchising: Identify franchise areas, develop bid \ndocuments, monitor bidding process, develop selection criteria, and \naward contracts \nPower Sector  (i) Licensing and tariff regulation \nRegulation  (ii) Financial management in line with the business unit structure and the \nemerging regulatory environment \nPolicy formulation  (i) Assist the Cabinet-appointed committee to finalize the NEA financial \nand planning  restructuring plan \n(ii) Share experience on best practices of rural electrification in other \ncountries \n(iii)Transmission, distribution, and operational planning including training \nand purchase of necessary software \nProject  (i) Train NEA personnel on material management \nManagement  (ii) Prepare bid documents, award contracts, and manage contracts for the \nand/or  distribution loss reduction and solar street lighting project components \nImplementation  (iii) Establish the DSM unit and implement the CFL program \nDOED  =  Department  of  Electricity  Development,  NEA  =  Nepal  Electricity  Authority,  DSM  =  demand  side \nmanagement, CFL = compact fluorescent lamp. \nSources:  Asian Development Bank and Nepal Electricity Authority. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Financial and Economic Justification \n1.  Financial Management \n43.  The financial management assessment, conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects9 during project preparation is in Supplementary Appendix \nC. The NEA with the assistance of the World Bank is upgrading and computerizing its system of \ncontrols and accounting, including segregation of costs into internal business units, to allow \ngreater transparency for regulatory intervention. The updated financial accounting system will \nmeet the requirements of national and international accounting standards and will include cost \nand management information systems to support timely business decision making by NEA's \nmanagers.  Capacity  building  will  include  on-the-job  training  for  NEA  staff  in  financial \nmanagement, internal control, and internal audit. The proposed project financial management \narrangements are considered satisfactory. \n \n2.  Past Financial Performance and Future Projections \n44.  Over the past 10 years, NEA's financial position has continued to deteriorate with no \ntariff increases since FY2001 and rising costs of energy purchases and operations. The NEA \nhas been implementing the Government\u2019s rural electrification policy, which is characterized by \nhigh costs and low revenues. The NEA has only been able to meet its cash operating expenses \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "14 \nand maintain ongoing capital investment in recent years by deferring payment of interest during \nconstruction, interest, and principal repayments, and by delaying royalty payments. \n \n45.  The  future  financial  performance  of  the  NEA  was  analyzed  under  various  financial \nrestructuring scenarios, including (i) converting some Government loans to equity; (ii) reducing \nonlending rates on Government loans to the NEA from 8% to 5%; (iii) utilizing a share of \nroyalties  currently  paid  by  the  NEA  to  cover  the  NEA  losses  on  rural  electrification;  (iv) \nGovernment to fund unit cost escalation, on FY2009 prices, for the NEA\u2019s electricity purchases \nfrom India and IPPs necessary to meet generation shortfalls; and (v) a combination of these \nscenarios. Details are provided in Appendix 7. The cumulative cash flow benefit to the NEA from \nthe scenarios analyzed is NRs42.6 billion during 2010\u20132015. Tariff increases are therefore \nunavoidable; increases in the order of 8% per annum from 2012 through to 2015 would produce \na positive cash flow for the NEA by the end of 2015. A high-level task force has been appointed \nby the Government to provide recommendations on the financial restructuring of the NEA.  \n \n3.  Financial Analysis \n46.  Financial analysis was undertaken for the major components (1, 2, and 4) of the Project \nby comparing project-related incremental revenues at the present average tariff with incremental \ncapital and operating costs. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is calculated at 12.2% for \ncomponent 1, 8.0% for component 2, and 5.9% for component 4. The overall FIRR for the three \ncomponents is 11.0%. The FIRR compares favorably with the estimated weighted average cost \nof  capital  of  1.3%,  substantiating  the  Project\u2019s  financial  viability.  The  sensitivity  analyses \ndemonstrated the results were robust to standard sensitivities. Details of the financial analysis \nare in Appendix 8. \n \n4.  Economic Analysis \n47.  Economic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  major  components  of  the  Project.  The \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  were  calculated  by  comparing  with-project  and \nwithout-project scenarios. Incremental consumption occurs because of the extended availability \nof  electricity  during  peak  demand  periods.  Incremental  consumption  was  valued  using \nconsumers\u2019 willingness to pay. Non-incremental consumption occurs as other forms of energy \nare displaced by the project outputs (the resource cost saving). This was valued using the \nmarginal cost of generation on the grid against the long term average economic cost of captive \ngeneration or kerosene for lighting. Analysis was undertaken on a time-of-year and time-of-day \nbasis.  The  EIRR  for  component  1  was  19.3%,  for  component  2  it  was  16.9%,  and  for \ncomponent 4 it was 18.7%. The EIRR of the aggregated subprojects is estimated to be 18.0%. \nThe  Project  also  demonstrates  robust  economic  performance  under  a  range  of  downside \nsensitivity tests. A summary of the economic analysis is presented in Appendix 9. Detailed \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nB.  Social and Poverty Analysis \n48.  A  full  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  consultation  with  affected  parties,  local \nauthorities, and the NEA, in accordance with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and \nthe relevant sections of the Operations Manual. Because no impact is expected on indigenous \npeoples communities, but only on individual households, no indigenous peoples development \nplan was prepared. However, in accordance with ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), \nadditional compensation will be awarded to vulnerable groups, including indigenous people, as \nper the provisions in the resettlement plan.  \n ", "15 \n \n49.  The project will entail limited permanent acquisition of agricultural land (4.66 hectares \n[ha]) and temporary restriction of use for 21.39 ha. To minimize and avoid damage and crop \ndisruption, tower construction and line stringing will be carried out in the off-season whenever \npossible. A total of 314 households will be affected by the project, of which only 22 will be \nsignificantly affected. Of these only two will be affected by the loss of more than 10% of their \nland; the remaining 20 households will be affected by the loss of structures. The entitlement \nmatrix provides for compensation at full replacement cost. Among these, 14 households fall \nunder  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples.  Special  provisions  were  included  in  the \nresettlement plan to address their needs. \n \n50.  The resettlement plan was translated into the local language and is being disclosed to all \naffected people. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12.  The \nsummary resettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix I and the full resettlement plan is in \nSupplementary  Appendix  F  (i).  A  detailed  socioeconomic  analysis  of  the  project-affected \npopulations is as in Supplementary Appendix F (ii). \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects \n51.  Environmental assessments have been carried out for all the subprojects in the seven \nproject components, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  NEA  has  either  completed  or  is  carrying  out  the \nenvironmental assessment process for the subprojects under the Environmental Protection Act \n(1997) and Environmental Protection Rules (1997 as amended). The Project has been assigned \ncategory B under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. An initial environmental examination (IEE) and a \nsummary IEE have been prepared covering all the subprojects regardless of the exemption of \nall except one subproject from IEE/environmental impact assessment requirements under the \nprevailing environmental laws in Nepal.  \n \n52.  Environmental impacts of the subprojects on transmission lines and substations are not \nsignificant  and  are  mostly  confined  to  the  right-of-way  of  those  facilities.  There  are  some \nnegative impacts on natural and socioeconomic resources during the land acquisition for some \nsubprojects and construction activities. The construction of the Dumre\u2013Damauli transmission \nline involves only small-scale excavation for tower foundations at scattered locations that are \nrefilled with excavated materials. Therefore, uncontrolled silt run-off is not expected. The best \nengineering practices will be used to prevent soil erosion during erection of transmission towers \non slopes and erosion-prone soils. Adequate steps will be taken to resurface the area after \nconstruction. On the sites which are likely to be affected by active erosion or landslides, both \nbiological and engineering treatment will be carried out, including provision of retaining walls, \nsowing soil-binding grasses at the site, and routine bioengineering measures. Construction \nactivities will be discouraged in the rainy season. During operation, the land area under the \ntransmission  line  can  be  used  for  agriculture.  The  footings  of  the  towers  are  acquired \npermanently and compensated for at 100% of the land value. Vegetation will be trimmed for \nminimum required clearance for the conductors. To minimize the risk of accidents and exposure \nto electric fields, houses and other structures will not be allowed within the right-of-way. \n \n53.  It is concluded that there is no significant environmental or social impact of the project \ncomponents,  in  either  the  short  or  long  term.  Some  impacts  that  may  arise  during  the \nconstruction stage are temporary and insignificant and can be made to be at the acceptable \nlevel with the application of appropriate mitigation measures. There are negligible impacts \nduring  the  operation  stage.  The  components  on  generation  rehabilitation,  distribution  loss \n ", "16 \nreduction, CFLs, and solar street lighting contribute to reduction in emissions and hence have \npositive environmental impacts. These reductions result from avoidance of petroleum products \nuse  in  domestic  lighting,  standby  generation,  and  even  coal-based  cross-border  electricity \nimports. However, the contractor and the NEA need to incorporate recommended mitigation \nmeasures in all stages of the Project. Although the contractors have the primary responsibility \nfor implementation of the mitigation measures during construction, the NEA will be responsible \nfor overall implementation of the environmental management plan.  \n \nD.  Benefits and Beneficiaries  \n54.  The Project will improve access for an estimated 20,000 additional households through \nstrengthening the distribution network. It will improve the reliability of supply to about 1.5 million \nexisting  consumers  with  increased  power  import  capacity,  additional  generation  capability, \nefficient management, energy efficiency, and demand management. The DSM components of \nthe Project will result in the reduction of an estimated 15,000\u201320,000 t of CO  emissions \n2\nannually.  Human  safety\u2014particularly  of  women  and  children  using  the  main  streets  in \nBhaktapur, Kathmandu, and Lalitpur\u2014will also improve due to better street lighting. \n \n55.  The Project is likely to have a positive effect on households below the poverty level in \nterms of per capita cash income. Semiskilled and unskilled local laborers are likely to have \naccess to employment opportunities during the construction of towers, stringing of new 132 kV \ntransmission  lines,  substation  construction,  and  even  post-construction  for  repair  and \nmaintenance and vegetation clearance along the right of way of the transmission lines. \n \n56.  Poverty  reduction  impacts  of  the  project  are  expected  in  a  few  areas.  The  rural \ncommunities will benefit from the access to cleaner energy improving health and sanitation, \neducation, and access to information. The newly electrified households will have the opportunity \nto  start  different  income-generating  activities.  Local  income-generation  activities  will  be \ndeveloped in the project sites. The local economy will improve due to the increased business for \nrestaurants, markets, and retail premises after the mobilization of construction teams. Reliable \nelectricity will create industrial growth and increase production in the existing industries. This will \ngenerate  employment  opportunities.  Project  areas  as  well  as  other  adjoining  locations  will \nbenefit from an increased industry activity. \n \nE.  Assumptions and Risks \n57.  There is an overall risk to the Project from a potential deterioration of the political \nsituation with changes in government and prolonged political transition. However, given the \ncritical importance of improving power supply and efficiency of the power sector, the proposed \nproject activities and reform actions should be high on any government's agenda. Also, given \nthe nature of the proposed reforms and project activities, political disturbances are unlikely to \nhave major adverse implications for effective and timely implementation, although the fragile \npolitical and weak governance situation pose a risk to procurement activities under the Project. \nSpecial efforts to closely monitor the project and procurement activities along with regular and \nintensive policy dialogue on the proposed reform actions will help to mitigate these potential \nrisks. \n \n58.  The  other  risks  specific  to  the  Project  are  (i)  delayed  project  implementation,  (ii) \ninadequate capacity to implement the Project, (iii) failure to resolve safeguard issues in a timely \nmanner, and (iv) the impact of external macroeconomic and financial cost factors and revenue \nprojections on the viability of the Project. Adequate measures have been taken to ensure a high \n ", "17 \nlevel of project readiness through training of NEA staff and the approval of advance contracting. \nPotential safeguard issues have been mitigated through preparation and early implementation \nof environmental management and resettlement plans. The sensitivity analyses carried out in \nrelation to the economic and financial analysis indicate that the rates of return are robust. \n  \n59.  In addition, ADB is preparing capacity development TA for the Government and the NEA \nto  strengthen  their  capacity  in  power  system  planning,  regulation,  best  practices  in  rural \nelectrification,  and  materials  management.  ADB  support  will  also  be  provided  for  the \nGovernment to finalize the NEA financial restructuring plan. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n60.

If the Government takes any decision that has a direct and adverse financial impact \nupon the NEA, the Government shall compensate the NEA by a line item in the budget to offset \nthe entire amount of the negative impact, including any subsidy for a lifeline tariff.   \n \n72.  The Government shall cause (i) all government institutions to ensure payment of their \nelectricity bills and dues for street lighting to the NEA within 90 days of receiving the bill; and (ii) \nthe  Government  shall cause  the NEA  to  improve  accounts  receivable  to  3 months  by  31 \nDecember 2010. \n \n73.  The Government shall exempt the NEA from all taxes and duties on project-related \nprocurement, except for 1% customs levy on imported equipment and 13% value added tax on \nconstruction. \n \n4.  Technical and Commercial \n \n74.  The NEA shall take measures to reduce the overall transmission and distribution losses \nfrom the present levels of 25.2% to (i) 24.5 % by 15 July 2011, (ii) 23.5% by 15 July 2012, and \n(iii) 22% by 15 July 2013. \n \n75.  The NEA shall present to ADB by 1 December 2010 a plan for reducing technical and \nnontechnical losses in the geographical areas under the component on supply-side energy \nefficiency improvement, acceptable to ADB. Such plans should be replicable across all the \nNEA's distribution networks. The NEA shall start implementing the plan by 30 June 2011. \n \n5.  Social Safeguards \n \n76.

Power Sector Institutional Structure  \n1.  The Ministry of Energy is the line ministry with primary jurisdiction and authority over the \nenergy sector. The Ministry of Energy\u2019s Department of Electricity Development is responsible for \npromoting the development of hydropower resources, preparing standards for transmission and \ndistribution  of  electricity,  and  inspection  and  monitoring.  The  Electricity  Tariff  Fixation \nCommittee was established to review and approve tariff filings by the Nepal Electricity Authority \n(NEA) and other licensed entities under the Electricity Act 1992. The Electricity Tariff Fixation \nCommittee  is  expected  to  be  replaced  by  an  independent  Nepal  electricity  regulatory \ncommission; the legislation is awaiting Parliamentary approval. The NEA, a wholly government-\nowned  corporation,  dominates  Nepal\u2019s  power  sector.  It  is  responsible  for  most  of  Nepal\u2019s \nelectricity generation, dispatch, transmission, distribution, and retailing. It operates hydropower \nplants with a total installed capacity of 407 megawatt (MW), two diesel plants with total installed \ncapacity of 53 MW, and two small (50 kilowatt [kW]) solar power stations. \n \n2.  There has been private sector participation in the Nepal power sector since 1992, with \nthe Hydropower Development Policy 19921 and the Electricity Act 1992. Since the legislative \nchanges required to implement certain components of the Hydropower Policy 2001 have not yet \nbeen enacted, The Hydropower Policy 1992 still provides the framework for private sector \nparticipation. Seventeen independent power producers (IPPs) contribute 156 MW of generation. \nThe NEA has signed power purchase agreements with 22 additional IPPs totaling 68 MW of \ncapacity, and this is under construction. About 107 kilometers (km) of transmission lines are \nprivately owned. One large privately owned distribution company supplies electricity to 23,000 \nconsumers, and there are many community-managed distribution schemes scattered across the \ncountry. \n \nB.  Power Sector Policy \n3.  Hydropower Development Policy 2001. This policy sets out a list of specific objectives \nand rules to govern the hydroelectric sector. It provides for (i) the functions pertaining to the \noperation of the power centers, operation of electricity transmission and national grid, and \nelectricity distribution owned by the NEA; (ii) the creation of an independent (power) system \noperator; and (iii) encouragement of local body, community, and private sector participation in \nthe operation of the electricity distribution system. \n \n4.  National Water Resource Strategy 2002. The key policy directives pertaining to the \npower sector contained in this document are that (i) the NEA is to become commercially viable \nthrough  corporatization,  improved  management,  and  separation  of  its  rural  electrification \noperations; (ii) the NEA is to be unbundled by separately creating a transmission/load dispatch \ncenter;  (iii)  generation  will  be  the  responsibility  of  a  separate  corporation;  (iv)  distribution \noperations will be sold or contracted out to municipal or private operators; and (v) the NEA will \noperate as a holding company. \n \n5.  Interim Plan (2008\u20132010). The long-term vision for the power sector is the utilization of \nwater resources to meet domestic power demand and the export of surplus power to increase \nthe country\u2019s foreign earnings. Some of the key strategies to be adopted are (i) introducing \neffective  regulation  of  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity  and  related \n                                                 \n1 Government of Nepal. 1992.

Sector Issues  \n6.  Generation. Of the total hydropower capacity, storage-type hydropower represents only \n14%. The dominance of run-off-river and daily storage hydropower plants has led to acute \ncapacity shortage during the dry season when the demand rises sharply. The wet season sees \na glut of energy available in the system which has yet to find a market. The Interim Plan (2008\u2013\n2010) envisaged hydropower projects with a total capacity of 105 MW being commissioned \nwithin the plan period to meet domestic electricity demand, with 85 MW of this coming from the \npublic sector and the balance coming from the private sector. This has largely been achieved. \nInitiation of 2,085 MW of new capacity was also envisaged within the plan period. However, \nconstraints on funding and process inefficiencies mean that this target will not be achieved. \n \n7.  Transmission. The NEA transmission system consists of 1,563 km of 132 kV power \nlines, 350 km of 66 kV power lines, and 2,500 km of 33 kV power lines. A 132 kV transmission \nring around the Kathmandu valley is being completed by the NEA. The completion of this series \nof projects, due in 2009, will cater for demand growth in the Kathmandu valley and will reduce \nlosses and improve supply quality and reliability. Timely commissioning of transmission lines is \ncritical for evacuation of much-needed new hydropower generation. Several IPPs are unable to \nundertake new power development initiatives because of the difficulties in power evacuation. \nThe NEA completed its most recent comprehensive transmission planning study in July 2006. \nHowever, the study does not directly address increased transmission connectivity with India, an \nissue that has far-reaching implications for Nepal\u2019s power sector and the development of large-\nscale  export-focused  hydropower  plants  in  Nepal.  Construction  of  175  km  of  high-voltage \ntransmission line and 377 megavolt-amperes (MVA) of transmission substation capacity was \nprogrammed for the Interim Plan period. Construction of the first of three planned 400 kV India\u2013\nNepal transmission interconnections is to be completed within the Interim Plan period. \n \n8.  Distribution. The NEA presently serves 1.5 million customers across all 75 districts of \nthe country. It sold 2,204 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity in FY2007, an increase of 10% \nover the previous year. Domestic and industrial consumers represent almost 80% of sales. Only \n40% of the population has access to electricity services, with 33% having access to the grid and \nthe NEA off-grid facilities, with the remaining 7% served by micro-hydro plants developed by \nlocal  entrepreneurs  and  other  alternate  sources.  The  Interim  Plan  expresses  the  need  to \nconnect an additional 450,000 rural households to the national electricity grid and has identified \n651 km of 33 kV lines, 3,163 km of 11 kV lines, 5,978 km of low-voltage lines, and 113 MVA of \n33/11 kV substation capacity to be added during the plan period. \n \n9.  Barriers to Private Sector Participation. The Government has already taken some \nsteps to attract private investment in the power sector. With the exception of some run-of-river \nhydropower plants funded by domestic investors, little investment has taken place. Reasons for \nthe  reluctance  of  the  private  sector  to  become  involved  in  the  sector  include  (i)  lack  of \ntransparency  and  accountability  in  the  licensing  process,  (ii)  incompatibilities  and \ninconsistencies  in  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks,  (iii)  difficulties  in  raising  non-recourse \nfinance,  (iv)  discriminatory  tariff  setting  for  projects  greater  than  5  MW,  (v)  inadequate \ntransmission network capacity to evacuate power, and (vi) political risk. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.1: ADB Energy Sector Results Framework \n \nRelevant

The  power  sector  in  Nepal  has  received  assistance  from  various  international \ndevelopment partners. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the World \nBank have been the major source of external funding to the sector, focusing on reforms in \ngeneration,  facility  rehabilitation  and  improvement,  and  development  of  renewable  energy \nresources. In addition, bilateral donors including Danish International Development Agency, \nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), KfW, Norwegian Agency for \nDevelopment Cooperation and United States Agency for International Development have been \nactive in the power sector.

The current power crisis that Nepal faces is a result of lack of investment in large, \nstorage-based hydropower plants to provide base-load generation during the dry winter months. \nInvestment has not occurred due to confused and conflicting legislation that has done little to \nencourage  private  participation  in  the  sector,  lack  of  domestic  financial  resources,  and \ninadequate  transmission  infrastructure  to  transmit  large  blocks  of  power  to  load  centers. \nConsequently, with a few exceptions, most generation development has been on a small scale \nin recent years, which has done little to relieve the power crisis. ADB\u2019s interventions in Nepal\u2019s \npower sector and those of its development partners have mostly focused on transmission, \ndistribution, and small hydropower. While these interventions have mostly produced useful and \nmeasurable results, they have not directly contributed to addressing the power crisis. The \nproposed Project is also largely transmission and distribution focused, but it directly addresses \nthe power crisis by improving capacity to import power from India, increasing transmission \ncapacity  for  evacuation  of  power  from  planned  large  storage-based  hydropower  stations, \ntargeting loss reduction in urban areas, dramatically increasing end-use energy efficiency, and \nincreasing the output of two existing hydropower stations. However, it must be recognized that \nthe Project itself will not solve the power crisis\u2014ongoing and targeted interventions from ADB \nand its development partners will be essential if the gains made by the Project are to be \nsustained and built upon. \n ", "30   Appendix 4 \n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES a \nTable A4.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \nNRs Million $ Million\nForeign Local Total Foreign Local Total % of \nItem Exchange Currency Cost Exchange Currency Cost Base Cost\nA.

Nepal Electricity Authority Past Financial Performance \n1.  Since 2001, the already poor financial position of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) \nhas been steadily deteriorating. The NEA last made a profit from operations in FY1998 (NRs154 \nmillion). In FY2007, the NEA made an accounting profit of NRs262 million; this resulted from \nforeign  exchange  rate  gains  on  Japanese  yen  loans.  Details  of  past  performance  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n2.  The NEA\u2019s underlying performance has been one of declining profitability, with no tariff \nincreases since FY2001, but rising costs of energy purchases and other operating costs. The \nbudgeted loss for FY2009 was NRs2,700 million, the highest in the NEA\u2019s history. The NEA has \nonly been able to meet its cash operating expenses and maintain ongoing capital investment in \nrecent years by deferring interest and principal repayments, and delaying royalty payments. At \nthe end of FY2008, interest during construction and interest arrears totaled NRs18.8 billion, and \nunpaid royalties1 totaled NRs602 million. Meanwhile debtors represented 4.8 months of sales \nwith municipal street lighting arrears accounting for NRs2.0 billion2 and representing 39% of \naccounts receivable at the end of FY2008. In its FY2009 budget, the NEA projected NRs1,748 \nmillion of debt service out of the NRs4,671 million that was actually due for payment. \n \n3.  Existing Asian Development Bank (ADB) financial covenants are (i) rate of return of \n6.0% per annum on revalued net fixed assets in service,3 (ii) self-financing ratio of 23% on an \naverage of 3 years capital expenditure, (iii) debt service ratio of 1.2 times debt service, and (iv) \naccounts receivable of less than 3 months. For FY2008 none of these covenants were met, with \nthe NEA being in partial or full noncompliance for most of the last 5 years. \n \nTable A7.1: Nepal Electricity Authority Key Financial Indicators  \nCovenant  2001 2004 2005 2006  2007  2008\nReturn on average NFA  6.7%  1.8%  4.3%  2.8%  6.1% a  1.3% \nDebt-service ratio  1.8  0.9  0.9  0.8  1.1  1.0 \nSelf financing ratio (3 year average)  11.3%  18.5%  26.3%  18.7%  47.4%  12.4% \nAccounts receivable (months)  2.5  3.8  3.5  3.7  4.3  4.8 \nNFA = net financial assets. \na  Includes revaluation on yen loans.

A financial management assessment questionnaire was completed for the NEA, and a \nfinancial management review and assessment of existing accounting and reporting procedures \nis set out in Supplementary Appendix C. While internal controls are in place, they are not \n                                                 \n1  The Nepal Electricity Act (1989) provided for 1% of the electricity sales as royalty to be paid by the NEA and \nindependent power producers (IPPs). In the case of IPPs the royalty is based on costs of generation. Those of the \nNEA are based on sales revenues from hydro generation. Later, the NEA argued for royalty payments to be also \nbased on its generation costs. The compromise agreed upon was that the NEA\u2019s royalty calculation would be \nbased on the average generation costs of IPPs times NEA\u2019s total generation from hydropower sources. \n2  Subsequent to balance date, the Ministry of Local Development has paid the NEA NRs1.0 billion and the NEA has \nwritten off NRs1.0 billion of street lighting arrears. The ministry has appointed a consultant to devise a long-term \npayment procedure for street lighting satisfactory to the NEA. \n3  It is proposed that this covenant be revised to read \u201crate of return of 6% on net fixed assets in service on a historic \nbasis\u201d so that it is consistent with World Bank covenants. \n ", "  Appendix 7  41 \n \n \nadequate. This has led to a series of audit queries surrounding cash, stock, and fixed assets \nover the years. The NEA sets up task forces to deal with these matters, which were never \nproperly  resolved  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  auditors.  The  NEA's  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement systems are being upgraded and computerized with support from the World Bank. \nThis includes computerization and integration of all systems, revised manual procedures, and \nextensive staff training. This should result in improved and timely management and financial \nreporting and a marked reduction in auditing issues. As a consequence of these initiatives,4 the \nproposed project financial management arrangements are considered satisfactory. \n \nC.  Financial Projections and Nepal Electricity Authority Financial Restructuring \n5.  Financial projections were prepared for the NEA up to FY2020. There is unlikely to be \nany major additions to generation capacity prior to FY2013, with power purchases needing to \nincrease to bridge the gap in generation, and the NEA needing to find funding to meet both \ngeneration and transmission investments necessary to improve the present supply. Accordingly, \nthe discussion below concentrates on FY2010\u2013FY2015. In the absence of tariff increases, the \nNEA\u2019s cash shortfall after meeting forecast capital expenditure and all debt service obligations \nwould be NRs60.2 billion. Tariff increases necessary to ensure a positive cash position by \nFY2015 would be 10.0% per annum, with the average tariff increasing from NRs6.74 per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh) to NRs11.95/kWh. Accordingly, in the absence of any major tariff increases \nto improve the NEA\u2019s cash flow, other options such as financial restructuring of the NEA need to \nbe examined to improve the NEA\u2019s financial position. These are outlined below. While capital \nexpenditure could be deferred, this would exacerbate the present supply situation. However, \nprioritization of expenditure is essential. \n \nD.  Restructuring Plan for the Nepal Electricity Authority \n6.  Balance  Sheet  Items. These are to (i) convert grants to the Government that are \ncurrently onlent to the NEA as loans to equity (value of loans was NRs188 billion at 15 July \n2008), (ii) convert Government loans to the NEA for Middle Marsyangdi hydropower station to \nequity (value of loan was NRs5.0 billion as at 15 July 2008), (iii) convert ADB\u2019s Eighth Power \nProject5 loan for rural electrification to equity (value of loan was NRs3.5 billion as at 15 July \n2008), (iv) convert current interest arrears and interest during construction arrears to equity, and \n(v) pass ADB\u2019s proposed loan to the Government of $65 million for the Clean Energy Access \nImprovement Project and ADB\u2019s proposed grant of $4.5 million from the Climate Change Fund \nand Clean Energy Fund to the NEA as grant or equity. \n \n7.  Revenue and Expense Items. These are (i) to reduce onlending rates on all other \nGovernment loans to the NEA from 8% to 5%; (ii) to utilize a share of royalties paid by the NEA \nto the Government (about 40% of total royalties) to partly cover the NEA\u2019s operating losses on \nrural electrification; (iii) for the Government to fund unit cost escalation, on FY2009 prices, for \nthe NEA\u2019s electricity purchases from India and independent power producers;6 (iv) to capitalize \ninterest during construction rather than being paid out by the NEA; (v) for future street lighting \narrears for municipalities and village development committees to be paid by the Government \nonce these are 3 months in arrears; (vi) for the Government to finance all rural electrification \ninvestments as equity with no contribution from the NEA; (vii) for the Government to directly \n                                                 \n4 ADB is also proposing technical assistance for 2010 that will include financial management as one of its areas of \nattention, with the objective of strengthening the NEA's financial management skills, especially in the area of \nfinancial planning, so that the NEA will be better placed to assess its long-term funding and tariff requirements. \n5 ADB.1999.

Manila. \n ", "42   Appendix 7 \n \ncompensate the NEA for the recently announced elimination of the demand charge and for any \nfuture adverse changes to the NEA\u2019s earnings; and (vii) to defer a proportion of remaining debt \nrepayments as required for FY2010\u2013FY2015 until such time as the NEA is able to meet its \nreduced debt service. \n8.  Converting onlent grants has a total cash flow benefit of NRs16.0 billion, and reducing \ninterest rates has a total cash flow benefit of NRs13.6 billion. Converting the Middle Marsyangdi \ngovernment loan and ADB\u2019s Eighth Power Project loan to equity adds a further NRs6.4 billion of \ntotal cash flow benefit during FY2010\u2013FY2015.  Using a share of royalties (40%) to cover rural \nelectrification operating losses results in a NRs3.7 billion total cash flow benefit to the NEA. A \nfurther  NRs8.7  billion of  total  cash  flow  benefit  accrues  to  the  NEA  with  the Government \nmeeting the unit cost escalation, on FY2009 prices, for the NEA\u2019s electricity purchases from \nIndia  and  independent  power  producers.  When  these  measures  are  combined  with  debt \nrestructuring, the total cash flow benefit to the NEA is NRs42.6 billion over FY2010\u2013FY2015. \n \n9.  Financial  projections  for  the  restructured  NEA,  following  the  above  Government \ninitiatives, require tariff increases of 8.0% per annum from FY2012 to FY2015 (i.e., 4 years of \n8% annual tariff increases) to achieve a cash-neutral position for the NEA by FY2015. Such \nincreases would be acceptable to the public once the NEA\u2019s electricity supply and service \nimproves. This tariff increase would allow ADB and World Bank loan covenants of a debt \nservice ratio of 1.2 times debt service and the rate of return on historic net fixed assets of 6.0% \nto be achieved by FY2013 (Table A7.2). \n \n10.  To allow the NEA to meet essential capital expenditure requirements, the Government \nwill need to provide additional debt repayment relief by deferral of principal repayment on debt. \nThis will be required until tariff increases take effect and purchases from India decline from 23% \nof the electricity sales mix in FY2013 to approximately 1% of the mix in FY2015. A total of \nNRs13.6 billion of debt repayment deferral will be necessary through to FY2013. \n \nTable A7.2: NEA Financial Projections after Restructuring Options and Tariff Increases \nFY (15 July)  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2020 \nSummary Ratios and Tariffs                 \nReturn on Average NFAs (%)  -0.7  4.7  2.9  5.6  9.2  9.4  9.3  6.0 \nDebt-service Ratio (DSR, times)  0.5  1.2  1.1  1.4  1.5  1.7  1.8  1.5 \nSelf Financing Ratio (%),3-year average  10  21  -2  4  11  38  127  392 \nDebt (LT)/Debt+Equity Ratio (%)  53  38  44  48  49  48  46  32 \nAverage Tariff (NRs/kWh)  6.74  6.74  6.74  7.28  7.87  8.50   9.18  9.18 \n% Change per annum  0.0  0.00  0.00  8.00  8.00  8.00  8.00  0 \nIPP Purchases (NRs/kWh)  5.77  5.94  6.12  6.30  6.49  6.69   6.89  7.98 \nIndian Purchases (NRs/kWh)  5.52  5.83  6.15  6.49  6.84  7.22   7.62  9.96 \nAverage Costs (NRs/kWh)  7.87  6.93  7.37  7.40  7.17  7.04   7.16  8.33 \nDSR = debt service ratio, IPP = independent power producer, kWh = kilowatt-hour, LT = long tern, NFA = net financial assets, RoR \n= rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                                                                                                                          \n6  Forecast electricity generation and sales are based on: NEA. 2008.

The financial analysis of the proposed subprojects has been carried out in accordance \nwith  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects1.  All \nfinancial costs and benefits have been expressed in constant 2009 price levels. Cost streams \nused for the purposes of financial internal rate of return (FIRR) determination reflect the costs of \ndelivering the estimated benefits. Financial analysis was undertaken for the major components \n(1, 2, and 4) of the Project.  \n  \n2.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) \nwas calculated for the proposed subprojects and compared with the project FIRRs to ascertain \nthe financial viability of the subprojects. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the \nunderlying assumptions was also assessed. \n \n3.  Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of the \nwith-investment and without-investment scenarios. The incremental benefits arise through the \nincreased electricity sales and avoidance of incremental generating costs at peak and off-peak \ntimes over both the summer and winter supply periods. Average incremental generation costs \nwere determined based on the NEA\u2019s generation expansion plan, and average incremental \ntransmission costs were added to derive total costs of supply to transmission subprojects. To \nthis, estimated distribution average incremental costs were added to give total costs of supply to \ndistribution subprojects. \n \n4.  It is assumed that the subprojects will have a 30-year economic life and residual value of \n33% of the original investment at the end of the 20-year evaluation period. \n \n5.  The  current  average  the  NEA  retail  tariff  of  NRs6.74  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  was \nadopted for evaluation purposes because sales, although predominantly in the Kathmandu \nvalley, would also benefit other parts of the country as a result of improved reliability and \nincreased transmission capacity. In the case of grid interconnections with India, the current \npurchase price of energy is valued at NRs5.24/kWh. \n \nB.  Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n6.  To compute the WACC, it is assumed that the financing sources would consist of the \nNEA and Government equity contributions and foreign sources by way of the proposed Asian \nDevelopment Fund grant. On this basis, project funding might be described as being \u201call equity.\u201d \nHowever, this does not reflect the cost of capital faced by the NEA for the bulk of its projects, \nand also its current poor financial status. The NEA is borrowing funds on the domestic bond \nmarket at around 10.5%, essentially to provide equity contributions to the Project and other \nprojects. The NEA\u2019s standard project funding structure is 80% foreign loan\u2014currently at an \ninterest  rate  of  8%\u2014and  equity  contributions  with  75%  from  the  NEA  and  25%  from  the \nGovernment.  \n \n7.  The  NEA\u2019s  equity  was  therefore valued  by  adding  issuing  costs  (1.5%)  and  a  risk \npremium (3.0%) to the domestic bond rate (10.5%), giving an estimated cost of equity of 15.0%. \nThe analysis assumes that, for standard project financing, any concessional loans or grants are \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

As shown in Table A8.1, the average WACC is calculated as 1.3%. \n \nTable A8.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n Item  ADB Loan  Equity  Total \nWeighting  80.0%  20.0%  100.0% \nNominal Cost  8.0%  15.0%    \nTax Rate  0.0%   0.0%    \nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost  8.0%         15.0%    \nInflation Rate  8.0%   8.0%    \nReal Cost   0.0%   6.5%    \nWACC  0.0%  1.3%   1.3% \nWACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.

Only subproject T1 has an FIRR below the WACC of 1.3%. This subproject is primarily \ndriven by the need to improve security of supply for evacuation of electricity from Marshyangdi \nhydropower station, and a secondary benefit arises from improvement to security of supply \nthrough an important transmission corridor. Since Marshyangdi hydropower station represents \naround  10%  of  the  NEA\u2019s  installed  capacity,  a  tripping  of  the  single  circuit  that  currently \nevacuates electricity from this station could cause severe instability in the system, and may \nresult in a cascade outage over the entire network. The cost of this low-probability event would \nbe  extreme.  Therefore,  this  subproject  needs  be  considered  as  an  integral  part  of  the \ntransmission investment program even though its FIRR is below the hurdle rate. \n \n                                                 \n2 Subproject T3 as considered in this financial analysis involves stringing a second 132 kV transmission circuit from \nButwal to Mahendranagar. However, the proposed loan will only fund the line from Butwal to Kohalpur (the line\u2019s \nmidpoint), with an expectation that the balance of the second circuit stringing will be funded from a follow-up ADB \nloan or from NEA\u2019s own resources. Analysis of the entire line has been undertaken to overcome the difficulties \ninherent in attempting to ascribe benefits to an upgrade to only part of a transmission line \n ", "  Appendix 8  45 \n \n \n10.  The FIRR for component 2 (distribution) is estimated at 8.0%, and for component 4 (loss \nreduction)  it  is  estimated  at  5.9%.  The  aggregate  FIRR  is  11.0%.  These  FIRRs  compare \nfavorably with the estimated value of WACC at 1.3%. Therefore, the analysis substantiates the \nfinancial viability of the subprojects and the overall project. \n \nD.  Risk Assessment and Sensitivity Analyses  \n11.  External Risks. Regulatory or tariff revision risk for the subprojects is minimal as no \ntariff increases have been assumed in the financial analysis. The current tariff has not been \nincreased since May 2001 and the Government has assured that any declines in nominal tariff \nwill be directly compensated.  \n \n12.  Electricity demand risk is minimal since the country is already experiencing daily load \nshedding of 16\u201318 hours during winter months. Geopolitical and political risks are present for all \nprojects in Nepal. However, the nature of the investments and the overall shortage of power in \nNepal serve to diversify this risk. Therefore, the overall risk to the financial sustainability of the \nNEA is deemed to be minimal, with the Project seen as a necessary step in improving the \nsupply situation, especially through improved interconnection with India, thus improving the \nNEA\u2019s financial situation. \n \n13.  Project-Specific Risks. Financial risks at subproject level include (i) increase in price of \ncivil works and equipment, (ii) delays in project implementation, and (iii) failure to have access \nto necessary counterpart funds. These risks are considered to be low because (i) the cost \nestimates were based on recent tenders received, and advanced procurement will lessen the \ntime between loan effectiveness and disbursement; (ii) the NEA\u2019s implementation capacity is \nlow  but  adequate,  and  consulting  support  will  be  provided  for  implementation  of  the  loss \nreduction component; and (iii) the projections prepared for the NEA demonstrate that, with \nrestructuring and Government support, cash flows will improve by 2015 and that thereafter the \nNEA will be able to meet the repayment of debt associated with the investments.  \n \n14.  Sensitivity Analysis. Separate analyses were carried out to examine the sensitivity of \nprojected financial returns to adverse changes in key variables. The variables considered for the \nsensitivity analyses were (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10% increase in operating and \nmaintenance costs, (iii) a 10% decrease in revenues, and (iv) a 2-year implementation delay \nwith a 20% increase in costs and no allowance for residual values. Table A8.3 demonstrates \nthat the results are robust for each component and for the overall Project, with the sensitivities \nexceeding the WACC.

Background and Approach \n1.  Economic  analysis  was  undertaken  to  determine  the  economic  viability  of  project \ncomponents. The analysis sought to \n \n(i)  verify electricity demand and supply projections,  \n(ii)  review the least-cost approach to system and project planning in Nepal, \n(iii)  undertake cost\u2013benefit analysis of the proposed transmission and distribution \nloan components, and \n(iv)  identify distribution of project costs and benefits among key stakeholders. \n \n2.  Economic  benefits  will  accrue  from  incremental  electricity  consumption  and  from \ndisplacement of more expensive sources of energy. The incremental costs and benefits of \nsubprojects  were  estimated  by  comparing  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios. \nTransmission subprojects were analyzed separately; distribution subprojects were aggregated \nfor the purposes of analysis, as were loss reduction subprojects. The generation component \nfocuses  on  minor  plant  modernization  for  which  benefits  are  difficult  to  quantify,  and  has \ntherefore been excluded from the analysis. \n \nB.  Calculation of Economic Internal Rate of Return, Risk Assessment, and Sensitivity \nAnalysis \n3.  Demand  Forecast.  The  demand  forecasting  methodology  and  model  of  the  Nepal \nElectricity Authority (NEA) were originally prepared during the 1998 Power System Master \nPlan1. The NEA has updated key model assumptions periodically since 1998. The model \nestimates demand for electrical energy and peak power on the integrated Nepal power system. \nIt uses a standard econometric approach, linking the demand for electrical energy to economic \nand income growth (measured by growth in gross domestic product) and electricity prices \n(measured by real changes in electricity tariffs). The NEA translates this aggregate demand \nforecast to a regional and substation demand forecast by pro-rating on the basis of previous \nyears\u2019  demand.  The  NEA  models  five  customer  groups:  domestic,  industrial,  irrigation, \ncommercial, and others (government, religious, and temporary). Overall, the NEA forecasts \nelectricity demand to grow by 9.9% per annum in 2009\u20132017. Peak demand is forecast by the \nNEA to grow by 9.7% over the same period, with a decline in losses from 23% to 18.5%. \n \n4.  Least-Cost  Planning.  For  all  subprojects,  the  NEA\u2019s  planners  have  identified  and \nanalyzed alternatives where they exist, and have confirmed that the proposed subprojects are \nleast-cost. The NEA conducts informal least-cost analysis for its distribution subprojects. This \nmeans that that desired outcomes are identified, and the NEA\u2019s senior engineers discuss and \nidentify the best approach to achieving the desired outcomes. While not ideal, this approach \ndoes implicitly include consideration of technical practicalities and expected costs, and given \nthat the distribution network is almost entirely radial with no interconnection, there are typically \nfew if any alternatives open to the NEA. The NEA\u2019s standard distribution substation and circuit \ndesigns are considered reasonable from a cost perspective, striking a good balance between \nsimplicity, reliability, and flexibility for future upgrading. For all distribution subprojects, the NEA \nhas confirmed that it has considered a reasonable range of alternatives and that the proposed \nsubprojects represent the least-cost means of achieving the desired outcomes.  \n                                                 \n1 Nepal Electricity Authority. 1998. Power System Master Plan. Kathmandu. \n ", "  Appendix 9  47 \n \n \n \n5.  Project Costs. All costs and benefits have been expressed at a constant 2008 price \nlevel; the world price numeraire was used. Traded inputs were valued at their border price \nequivalent values. Nontraded inputs were valued at domestic prices and then adjusted to the \nworld price numeraire by multiplying by the estimated standard conversion factor of 0.94. The \nstandard conversion factor was calculated using a simple trade-weighted approach. Capital \ncosts included physical contingencies but excluded taxes, price contingencies, and financial \ncharges during construction. Based on international experience, the operating costs for the \ntransmission subprojects were estimated at 1.5% of capital costs, and 2% for the distribution \nsubprojects. It was assumed that there are no significant distortions in the wage rates for skilled \nlabor. In the case of unskilled labor, underemployment exists in the economy, and a shadow \nwage rate of 0.75 was adopted. The World Bank\u2019s projections of crude oil prices, which were \nextended to 2030 by assuming flat real prices beyond 2020, were used for establishing the \ninternational parity values of petroleum fuels that would be consumed if electricity was not \navailable due to electricity supply constraints. These prices were also used for estimating the \ncost of thermal electricity generation. Average incremental generation costs were determined \nbased on the NEA\u2019s generation expansion plan. Average incremental transmission costs were \nadded to derive total costs of supply to transmission subprojects. To this, estimated distribution \naverage incremental costs were added to give total costs of supply to distribution subprojects. \n \n6.  Project  Benefits.  Current  capacity  constraints  in  both  transmission and  distribution \nnetworks mean that frequent supply interruption is required to ensure that networks are not \noverloaded. The proposed subprojects are primarily concerned with removing these network \nconstraints, improving reliability of supply, and reducing losses. This will be achieved through \nadditional line and substation capacity, network reconfiguration, and the addition of capacitor \nbanks to reduce reactive power flows. Analysis of the current and forecast electricity demand \nand supply balance in Nepal reveals that during winter there is always a generation shortage \nthrough to 2013. This means that during winter through to 2013 any reduction in losses will lead \nto  reduction  in  unserved  demand  and  displace  other  forms  of  alternative  power  supplies, \nincluding captive generation. During other periods any reduction in losses will result in only a \nresource cost savings as generation is reduced. Further, any increases in network capacity to \nrelieve  constraints  will  only  have  value  during  generation  surplus  periods  since  demand \ndownstream of constraints can only be supplied if there is a generation surplus. \n \n7.  Nonincremental outputs from transmission and distribution components of the Project \nwere valued at the resource cost savings that would accrue if the Project were to proceed. In \nvaluing the output of subprojects, it was assumed that most captive generation and kerosene \nlighting would be displaced before incremental consumption occurs. Benefits were allocated \nacross consumer groups on the basis of estimated use of alternative energy sources for each \ngroup. \n \n8.  Incremental outputs were valued using the estimates of willingness of Nepali consumers \nto pay for additional electricity, adjusted to the appropriate voltage level of each subproject. \nDemand functions relating energy price to energy demand were estimated for each of the four \nmain  consumer  types  (domestic,  commercial,  industrial,  and  agricultural).  The  form  of  the \ndemand function follows ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department Technical Note No. 3 \nMeasuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity.2 Demand functions were derived using two data \npoints  for  each  consumer  type:  (i)  the  long  term  average  economic  cost  and  quantity  of \nalternative energy sources; and (ii) the NEA\u2019s marginal tariffs for consumers consuming the \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "48   Appendix 9 \n \naverage quantity of electricity, adjusted for reported and estimated suppressed demand and \ncollection efficiency. Regression analysis was then used to derive the four demand functions. \nThe derived demand functions were then applied and solved, on a year-by-year basis, to value \nthe incremental consumption enabled by each subproject and for each consumer type. Benefits \nwere allocated across consumer groups on the basis of the current consumer mix.  \n \n9.  Some of the transmission subprojects aim to reduce the high number of unscheduled, \nshort-duration  power  outages  that  are  currently  experienced.  These  outages  carry  a  high \neconomic cost in terms of lost production and output. For the purposes of analysis, Nepal\u2019s \ndomestic product per unit of electricity sold, adjusted downwards to account for the fact that a \nfew large industries and commercial consumers self-generate, was taken as a proxy for the \nvalue of energy not served due to unscheduled short-duration outages. \n \n10.  Benefit quantities and unit values for the first few years after Project commissioning are \nsummarized  in  Table  A9.1.  The  ongoing  and  extreme  generation  shortages  that  Nepal  is \nexperiencing are apparent in this table. Generation shortages mean that benefits cannot be fully \nrealized and actually decline for the first few years as generation shortages worsen. The high \neconomic cost of these shortages is apparent in the initially increasing average unit benefit of \nProject output through to 2014, especially when compared to the current average tariff of $0.07 \nper kilowatt-hour (kWh). \n \nTable A9.1: Economic Benefits \nEconomic Benefits     Units  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018 \n                     \nQuantity                   \n \nIncremental output    GWh  38.4  23.7  13.7  19.6  24.8  46.1  64.8 \n \nNon-Incremental output    GWh  13.4  10.0  5.3  5.4  10.7  19.2  26.5 \n \nReduced energy not served    GWh  2.0  2.0  2.1  2.1  2.1  2.1  2.2 \n                     \nUnit Value                   \n \nAverage willingness to pay    $/kWh  0.09  0.09  0.09  0.09  0.09  0.09  0.09 \n \nAverage resource cost saving    $/kWh  0.41  0.41  0.41  0.41  0.41  0.41  0.41 \n \nAverage value of energy not served  $/kWh  2.85  2.85  2.85  2.85  2.85  2.85  2.85 \n \nAggregate average unit benefit    $/kWh  0.27  0.34  0.56  0.44  0.38  0.28  0.25 \n                                \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.             \n \n \n11.  Estimated Economic Internal Rate of Return. A period of 25 years was used for \neconomic evaluation. The detailed cost\u2013benefit calculations show investments are expected to \ndeliver significant economic benefits, as summarized in Table A9.2.3 The aggregated estimated \nEIRR is 19.1% (Table A9.2). Only the Marshyangdi transmission line and substation upgrade \nsubproject has an EIRR below the hurdle rate of 12%. This subproject is primarily driven by the \nneed to improve security of supply for evacuation of electricity from Marshyangdi hydropower \nstation.  Marshyangdi  hydropower  station  represents  around  10%  of  the  NEA\u2019s  installed \n                                                 \n3  Subproject T3 as considered in this economic analysis involves stringing a second 132 kilovolt (kV) transmission \ncircuit from Butwal to Mahendranagar. However, the proposed loan will only fund the line from Butwal to Kohalpur \n(the line\u2019s midpoint), with an expectation that the balance of the second circuit stringing will be funded from a \nfollow-up ADB loan or from the NEA\u2019s own resources. Analysis of the entire line has been undertaken to overcome \nthe difficulties inherent in attempting to ascribe benefits to an upgrade to only part of a transmission line. \n ", "  Appendix 9  49 \n \n \ngenerating capacity, and a tripping of the single circuit that currently evacuates electricity from \nthis station could cause severe instability in the system.

Sensitivity and Risk Analysis. The risks that the subprojects do not achieve such high \nlevels of economic returns were identified from both cost and benefit side.

Distribution Analysis. The distribution of costs and benefits among stakeholders was \nassessed by comparing financial costs and benefits to economic costs and benefits. Overall, the \neconomic  net  present  value  exceeds  the  financial  net  present  value  by  $75.8  million. \nConsumers are the greatest beneficiaries, with net benefits of about $42.2 million. Unskilled \nlabor benefits by approximately $0.7 million, and Nepal\u2019s economy benefits by approximately \n$32.8 million. The NEA is a net loser in this analysis ($34.8 million), as its weighted average \ncost of capital and therefore its expected financial internal rate of internal on the investment is \nwell below the 12% discount rate used in the analysis. \n  \n14.  Sustainability.  The  proposed  investments  represent  the  most  urgent  subprojects. \nTaken  together  they  will  make  a  discernable  difference  to  the  quality  of  electricity  supply \nreceived  by  many  consumers.  With  appropriate  institutional  support  to  the  NEA  and  the \nGovernment, economic benefit flow is expected to be financially and institutionally sustainable. \nIn the medium term, the sector will be supported by a more transparent tariff-setting regime that \nwill, over time, permit full recovery of efficient costs. This tariff regime will ensure that the NEA \ncan  implement  its  proposed  investment  program  in  the  knowledge  that  new  capital  and \noperating costs are recoverable and that it will earn an acceptable return on capital. Investment \nfunds will come from different sources including government equity, bilateral partners, the World \nBank, and the Asian Development Bank. Internal generation of funds is not forecast to be a \nviable financing source for the NEA until 2015 at the earliest, as a consequence of the current \ngap between cost of supply and tariffs. \n \nC.  Conclusion \n15.  The  economic  analysis  confirms  that  the  proposed  investment  is  least-cost  and \neconomically viable. The analysis yields an overall EIRR of 19.1%. Sensitivity and risk analysis \ndemonstrates  that  the  expected  economic  performance  is  robust.  From  an  economic \nperspective the proposed investment should proceed. \n                                                 \n4  A switching value measures the percentage change in the variable required to reduce the EIRR to the assumed \nhurdle rate. \n ", "  Appendix 10  51 \n \n \nDESCRIPTION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN LIGHTING COMPONENT \n \nA.  Background and Rationale \n1.  Nepal is presently experiencing critical power shortages. Both supply- and demand-side \noptions can be used to reduce the gap between the demand for and the supply of electricity. \nSupply-side  management  measures  tend  to  have  medium-  to  long-term  gestation  periods, \nwhereas demand-side management (DSM) options can be implemented in a short period of \ntime, are often low cost, and are characterized by high benefit\u2013cost ratios. Among various DSM \nalternatives that can be implemented quickly, a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) distribution \nprogram has been identified as a viable option. \n \n2.  The proposed CFL program provides for the distribution of 1 million energy-efficient \nCFLs to residential consumers drawing electricity from Nepal\u2019s electricity grid. CFLs will be \ndistributed  free  of  charge  to  lifeline  households1 and  on  a  buy-one-get-one-free  basis  to \nnonlifeline households. CFL models of 9\u201311 watts (W) will replace 40 W incandescent bulbs, \n12\u201315 W CFLs will replace 60 W incandescent bulbs, and 20\u201323 W CFLs will replace 100 W \nincandescent bulbs. \n \n3.  The Government has approved the National Electricity Crises Mitigation Plan 20652 to \nmanage the present acute energy supply shortages. Under the plan, the government intends to \nmobilize its resources to mitigate the adverse impacts of the power sector supply deficits. The \nplan  identifies  the  CFL  buy-one-get-one-free  scheme  as  a  pilot  program  for  immediate \nimplementation. It is estimated that there are more than 3.6 million incandescent bulbs currently \nsold every year in the market. Although the use of CFLs has significantly increased in the last \nfew years, the proliferation of low-quality CFLs has distorted consumer perceptions of CFLs as \nreliable substitutes for incandescent bulbs. It is expected that the distribution of high-quality \nCFLs to residential customers will influence the consumption habit toward the adoption of CFLs \nin light points previously fitted with incandescent bulbs.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The impact of the proposed CFL program will be more efficient electricity end-use. The \noutcomes of this CFL program component include \n \n(i)  peak demand reduction of about 10 megawatts (MW),  \n(ii)  deferred investments in new generating capacities amounting to $18 million, \n(iii)  energy savings of about 23 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per annum, \n(iv)  increased sales and reduced price of good quality CFLs, and \n(v)  proportionally decreased sales of incandescent bulbs and low-quality CFLs. \n \nC.  Outputs \n5.  The outputs of the proposed CFL program will be the replacement of approximately 1 \nmillion incandescent bulbs with CFLs for residential consumers. \n \n                                                 \n1 Typically households with a 5 ampere electricity connection and/or consuming less than 20 units per month. \n2 Government of Nepal. 2009.

The DSM unit will be responsible for technical, \nprocurement, due diligence, evaluation, monitoring, and reporting aspects of implementation. \nThe NEA will work with CFL suppliers and distribution channels as program partners. \n \n8.  International voluntary product specifications and energy performance standards will be \nused for the CFLs purchased. In no case will the adopted CFL standards fall below those \nrequired under the efficient lighting initiative (ELI) technical specifications. Bayonet-capped self-\n ", "  Appendix 10  53 \n \n \nballasted CFLs will typically be used. Power ratings and distribution quantities will be finalized \nafter the baseline survey of domestic consumers across different meter-type classifications, \nmonthly  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  consumption  brackets,  and  geographical  areas  has  been \nconducted. \n \n9.  CFL suppliers will be accredited by the NEA to establish a network of transaction and \nredemption points within existing CFL distribution and sales networks in Nepal. The sale or \nhandover of each CFL will remain between the CFL supplier and the participating domestic \nconsumer. A $1.5 million portion of the proposed grant assistance will be used to reduce the \neffective selling price in each transaction. Both the NEA and ADB will pursue discussions on the \npossibility of collecting incandescent bulbs from participating domestic consumers as a measure \nto help ensure the attainability of the virtual power plant capacity target, as well as other detailed \nmechanics of the CFL transaction. The NEA will secure ADB clearance prior to the adoption of \nthe final distribution plan and the accreditation of CFL suppliers. \n \n10.  As soon as the target consumers have received all 1 million CFLs, the NEA will perform \na random verification survey involving households with a sampling methodology similar to that \nof the baseline survey. ADB will be provided with a copy of this verification survey report. Both \nthe  NEA  and  ADB  shall  then  jointly  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  program  and  discuss  the \nfeasibility of further expanding the program through a subsequent CFL program phase to cover \nremaining incandescent bulb light points and low-quality CFLs among domestic consumers, if \nany. \n \n11.  The  duration  of  this  project  will  be  24  months  including  activities  such  as  design, \nprocurement and distribution, and monitoring. \n \nF.  Benefits  \n12.  The CFL program will result in reduced peak demand on the national electricity grid of \napproximately 10 MW, and 23 GWh of annual energy savings. Given the peak demand and \nenergy constraints frequently experienced in Nepal, these savings have high economic value to \nthe nation and high financial value to the NEA.  \n \n ", "54   Appendix 11 \n \nDESCRIPTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR STREET LIGHTING COMPONENT  \n \n \nA.  Background \n1.  This component under the proposed Energy Access and Efficiency Improvement Project \nwill assist the Government of Nepal to promote solar powered streetlights and wind-solar hybrid \nstreetlights in urban areas of Nepal. This will include purchase of solar-powered street lighting \nand hybrid systems, replacements, and setting up a system to ensure proper maintenance and \nsystem reliability. Under this pilot project, around 1,000 streetlights will be installed in selected \nareas in Kathmandu valley municipalities, focusing mainly on heritage areas, major temples or \nother religious areas, tourist hotspots, major shopping streets, and some other main road areas. \n  \n2.  Presently, Nepal faces significant electricity supply constraints and consumers have to \nundergo long periods of power interruptions, especially during evening peak hours. By replacing \n1,000 streetlights with solar-powered streetlights, around 0.2 megawatts (MW) of peak load on \nthe grid and 750 megawatt-hours (MWh) of annual energy can immediately be saved. The \nGovernment and the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) have therefore identified solar-powered \nstreet lighting as a priority activity. \n \n3.  Municipal streetlights are owned and managed by municipalities, although the NEA is \ncarrying out maintenance on them in a few areas. Nonpayment or delay in payment of electricity \narrears owed by the municipalities to the NEA for street lighting has been a contentious issue \nthat has aggravated the financial situation of the NEA. Use of solar-powered streetlights would \nprovide some relief to the NEA through (i) avoided diesel-fired generation at a unit cost of \napproximately NRs30 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for around 40% of the year,1 and (ii) avoided \npurchases from India for the rest of the year at around NRs5.24/kWh. The benefit to the NEA \nwould be around NRs12 million per year.  \n \n4.  Existing streetlight installations are mostly sodium vapor lamps, halogen lamps, mercury \nvapor lamps, and incandescent bulbs of 70 watts (W), 150 W, 250 W, and 400 W. The larger \nsizes tend to be used in main streets; the smaller sizes are used in less important streets, \ntemples, and government offices. It is estimated that around 45,000 streetlights are currently \ninstalled in the Kathmandu valley.  \n  \n5.  Justifications  for  implementation  of  a  solar-powered  streetlight  program  include  the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Solar power is a clean and renewable source of energy.  \n(ii)  Nepal has a good solar resource (300 sunny days per year, with approximately \n4.5 kWh per square meter per day of energy intensity). \n(iii)  Payment for street lighting energy is a problem for municipalities. This problem \nwill be resolved by solar-power streetlights, and the NEA\u2019s revenue leakage will \nbe reduced. \n(iv)  The program will mitigate the effects of capacity and energy shortages during \npeak demand periods. \n                                                 \n1  The current supply shortfalls that affect the integrated Nepal power system for most of winter mean that any peak \ncapacity and energy that is freed up through the introduction of solar-powered streetlights will be consumed by \nother consumers, and there will actually be an increase in sales rather than a reduction in generation. \n ", "  Appendix 11  55 \n \n \n(v)  Where solar-powered streetlights are deployed to areas that currently have no \npublic  lighting,  there  will  be  reductions  in  crime  and  fear  of  crime,  and \nimprovements in the safety and security of pedestrians. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n6.  The impact of the solar street lighting component will be reduced burden on the national \nelectricity grid allowing greater energy access to people. The outcome would be gradual shifting \nof street lighting load away from the national electricity grid through renewable energy-based \nstreet lighting systems.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n7.  The program will have the following outputs:  \n \n(i)  Replacement of incandescent bulbs, sodium vapor lamps, and mercury vapor \nlamps with compact fluorescent, low-pressure sodium, or light-emitting diodes \n(LEDs) powered by solar and wind energy.  \n(ii)  Retrofitting of existing conventional street lighting systems with solar lights and \nwind-solar hybrid lights systems. \n(iii)  Installation of turnkey package systems of solar-powered street lighting systems \nand wind-solar hybrid street lighting systems. \n \nD.  Cost Estimate and Financing Plan \n8.  The total program cost will be $2.7 million, as shown in Table A11. The Government will \nfinance $0.2 million of this and the balance will be financed from ADB's Multi-Donor Clean \nEnergy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. \n \nTable A11: Solar and Solar-Wind Streetlight Program Cost Estimate \n($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n9.  The NEA will be the executing and implementing agency for this component. The NEA \nwill establish a technical team that will procure the solar streetlight components following ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and install and maintain them. \nConsulting services will be provided to the NEA to help (i) identify the exact locations of the \nstreetlights to be replaced and/or installed, (ii) design the system, (iii) assist in preparing bids \nand procurement, and (iv) supervise the installation of solar streetlights. NEA staff will also be \ntrained in operation and maintenance of solar streetlights. \n \n10.  A  coordination  committee  will  be  established  comprising  representatives  from  the \nMinistry of Local Development (chair), NEA, participating municipalities, the Alternative Energy \nPromotion Center, and other relevant personnel. The committee will identify key areas for \ninstallation of solar streetlights and oversee the implementation of the program. The Alternative \nEnergy Promotion Center will assist in testing the solar equipment, and will provide other \ntechnical inputs to the technical team in the NEA and the committee. Community groups and/or \ncommittees will be mobilized in each program area to work with the NEA to maintain the \nstreetlights.  \n \nF.  Benefits \n11.  The energy consumed by 1,000 conventional streetlights is equivalent to about 750 \nMWh per year, all of which is drawn from the grid. If this amount of energy at the user end is \nreplaced by solar-powered streetlights, the potential energy savings is 750 MWh annually. The \nbenefit to the NEA would be around $0.15 million (cost of avoided diesel generation plus cost of \navoided purchases from India). The total physical investment cost of the program is $2.1 million. \nOn this basis, the simple payback period would be around 14 years. \n \nG.  Potential Program Areas \n12.  The  following  have  been  identified  as  potential  pilot  areas  for  the  program  (with \nproposed number of streetlight installations in parentheses); all are in the Kathmandu valley. \n \n(i)  Thamel (63 installations); \n(ii)  New Road (62 installations); \n(iii)  Pashupatinath, Bouddha, and Swoyambhunath stupas (40 installations); \n(iv)  Patan and Bhaktapur heritage sites (25 installations); \n(v)  Kingsway (33 installations); and \n(vi)  main roads leading to Kathmandu Airport (245 installations). \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  57 \n \n \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry and Project Title: Nepal/Energy Access and Efficiency Improvement Project \n \nDepartment/  South Asia Department/ \nLending/Financing Modality:  Project \nDivision:  Energy Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nNepal is one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita gross domestic product of around $383. More \nthan 80% of the country\u2019s population lives in rural areas, where poverty is more prevalent and severe than in \nurban areas. Poverty incidence in Nepal is high, and is more severe among unprivileged social groups. The \n2003\u20132004 Nepal Living Standard Survey shows that, although poverty in Nepal declined between 1995\u20131996 \nand 2003\u20132004, 31% of Nepalese people are still below the national poverty line as of 2003\u20132004. The rate of \npoverty reduction was lower in rural areas (20%) compared with urban areas (56%) between 1995\u20131996 and \n2003\u20132004.   \n \nIn Nepal, electricity has been considered as important to improving quality of life and is the most important factor \nin increasing economic development.  \n \nAbout 39% of the population have an electricity connection, although there are regional and urban and/or rural \ndisparities. Lack of grid connectivity and network capacity shortfalls have proved to be an impediment to efficient \nenergy consumption. Severe bottlenecks impinge on day-to-day operation, and energy losses in some parts of \nthe network are large. Lack of transmission connectivity and capacity has been hindering development of \nhydropower generation spread across the country. The distribution network capacity constraints as well as \noutdated network planning, design, operation, and maintenance have led to inefficient supply of electricity to \nconsumers. The Project aims to improve the efficiency of supply and use, improve grid connectivity, and control \nelectricity leakage. Benefits of the Project will be contributing to meeting the daily energy requirements and to \nproviding  efficient  services.  This  will  result  in  enhanced  economic  activity  and  employment  opportunities, \nincluding for poor and socially disadvantaged people during the implementation phase.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1. Key Issues  \nThe Government of Nepal formulated its 10th Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007) as its principal policy and strategy for \npoverty reduction. The plan is based on four pillars of poverty reduction: (i) sustainable and broadly based \neconomic growth, (ii) social sector development, (iii) a targeted program for excluded groups, and (iv) good \ngovernance. The key goals and targets of the plan include increasing gross domestic product growth rates by \nimproving  social  and  physical  facilities  and  infrastructure.  The  Government\u2019s  Interim  Plan  2008\u20132010  is \ncommitted to the policies and strategies adopted by the 10th Five-Year Plan. Among other things, the underlying \nconstraints on achieving the goals of poverty reduction include low access to social and economic facilities and \nservices including electricity, limited economic opportunities, and low income and consumption.   \n \nThe transmission network expansion components will increase power transfer capacity between hydropower \ngeneration areas (including export-oriented hydropower schemes) and the load centers, while the distribution \nnetwork capacity will reduce distribution losses and improve access to efficient electricity. Economic benefits of \nthe project are expected to accrue through the delivery of efficient energy to consumers. Removal of network \nconstraints will reduce the need for consumers to use less-efficient energy sources, and reduced losses will allow \nelectricity to be delivered more efficiently to consumers. This will also contribute to using the Government's \nInterim Plan priority of expanding hydropower as the foundation of overall economic development. The project\u2019s \nbenefits are directly and indirectly related to the increased economic activity, particularly due to creation of \nincome-generating opportunities through small-enterprise and industrial development.  \n ", "58   Appendix 12 \n \n \nThe poverty reduction potential of this project is significant since Nepal is currently facing peak supply constraints \ndue to lack of generation and network capacity. Grid-connected consumers in Nepal are facing as much as 100 \nhours (or more) of planned supply interruption per week in winter. The project\u2019s benefits are directly linked to \nproviding efficient electricity, thus significantly improving the overall social and economic situation, as efficient \nelectricity supply directly contributes to increased production and creates employment opportunities.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe proposed project aims to improve (i) grid connectivity, (ii) efficiency of electricity distribution, and (iii) \ndemand-side management through appropriate interventions to ease the supply and shortage constraints in the \nproposed project locations and in other parts of the country. \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  transmission  system  and  distribution  capacity  in  the  northern  part  of  the \nKathmandu valley where demand is growing rapidly due to urban and commercial expansion to the north of the \ncity and extension of the Budhanilkantha residential area. The strengthened system will also meet the demand \nfor electric supply in the western part of Kathmandu, and improve reliability. The Kathmandu valley is one of the \nmain load centers, consuming about 37% of the total energy.  \n \nFinally, the project will provide adequate power supply to western Nepal, thereby promoting industrial growth. It \nwill also help to import more power from Tanakpur (India), and evacuate the power from the Chameliya and \nUpper Karnali hydropower plants which are under construction in the western region. The second circuit stringing \nwill also help to meet the demand of additional energy (19 megavolt-amperes [MVA]) required for the Danish \nInternational Development Agency (Danida)-funded Rural Electrification Project by 2012, and add around 13 \nMVA for the Asian Development Bank-funded Eighth Power Rural Electrification Project a.   Implementation of the \nproject will contribute to filling the daily energy requirements and provide efficient services resulting in increased \neconomic activity and employment opportunities.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation: \n \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation \n \nConsultation with NEA officials was focused to solicit project-related data and documents and to gather further \ninformation required for project preparation activities. District stakeholders were consulted to inform them about \nthe project, collect required information and suggestions relevant to the project, and seek their support for project \npreparation. Consultation with the local community, including the project-affected families, was undertaken to (i) \ndisseminate information about the proposed project and likely impacts, (ii) solicit their view and suggestions, (iii) \ncollect socioeconomic and census data, (iv) assess the scope of effects on private and community assets, (v) \ncollect information about different assets likely to be affected, and (vi) make provisions and determine other \nfinancial assistance to be made to the affected people. \n \n2.

Key Issues: \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  59 \n \n \nBased on the findings of field observation, socioeconomic survey, and community consultation in different project \nlocations, women (particularly in rural areas) have secondary status compared to their male counterparts. Low \nlevels of literacy, high unemployment, the tradition of early marriage, and women's extensive involvement in \nhousehold activities are socially prescribed roles of women in the study area.  \n \nThe findings of the study also reveal that women's role in decisions related to financial and social matters are \nlimited. However, more than 90% of decisions on household chores are made by women. Collectively (i) the \nmajority of the women are illiterate, (ii) women have a higher level of vulnerability, (iii) incomes for female heads \nof households are less than those of male heads, (iv) women\u2019s daily wage rates in the study area are about \n10%\u201325% less than those of men, and (v) none of the households were using clean energy (electricity) for \ncooking purposes. Instead, firewood is main the source of cooking energy and most of the women's time is spent \non household activities and cooking food in a smoky environment. Women are expected to continue using \nfirewood for cooking, but will use a cleaner source of energy for lighting. \n \nThe Project is expected to improve health conditions for women (who mainly remain at home), and increase \nsecurity on the streets as a result of the improved street lighting. \n \nAn increased trend of mobility (mostly male population) in search of employment in India and overseas has \nincreased the risk to women of both trafficking and HIV/AIDS.  \n \n2.
