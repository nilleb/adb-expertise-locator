The  Government  of  Nepal  has  undertaken  initial \nenvironmental  examinations  and  developed  an  environmental \nenvironmental \nplan.  The \nmanagement \nexamination is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nThe  Project  consists  of  seven  components  under  three  main \ncategories:  (i)  energy  access,  (ii)  clean  energy,  and  (iii)  capacity \nbuilding. \n \nEnergy Access \nComponent 1: Facilitating Access to Clean Energy. Component 1 \nconsists  of  (i)  constructing  the  Middle  Marsyangdi\u2013Damauli\u2013\nMarsyangdi \nto \nstrengthen  the  evacuation  of  power  from  the  70  megawatt  (MW) \nMarsyangdi hydropower station, (ii) constructing the second circuit \nof the Butwal\u2013Kohalpur transmission line to improve cross-border \npower  import  capacity,  and  (iii)  constructing  and  expanding  the \nChapali  and  Matatirtha  grid  substations  and \ninstallation  of \ncapacitor  banks  to  strengthen  the  capability  of  the  transmission \nnetwork to transfer power. \n \nComponent 2: Energy Access Quality Enhancement. Component \n2  consists  of  constructing  eight  primary  distribution  substations \nand three switching stations to strengthen the electricity system\u2019s \nability  to  connect  new  consumers  and  to  improve  the  quality  of \nelectricity supply to existing consumers. \n \nClean Energy \nComponent  3:  Clean  Energy  Plant  Improvement.  Component  3 \ninvolves  rehabilitating  two  small-scale  run-of-river  hydropower \nplants  at  Marsyangdi  (69  MW)  and  Gandak  (15  MW)  to  increase \nthe efficiency. \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\nfeeders  and \n\ninvolves  assisting \n\nImprovement. \nComponent  4:  Supply-Side  Energy  Efficiency \nComponent  4  will  develop  a  pilot  project  to  rebuild  selected \ndistribution \nlow-voltage  networks  which  have \nunacceptably  high  losses,  using  international  best  practice  to \nreduce both technical and commercial losses.  \n \nComponent  5:  Energy  Efficiency  in  Lighting.  Component  5 \ninvolves  distributing  approximately  1  million  compact  fluorescent \nlamps  to  households  and  implementation  support  to  improve \nenergy efficiency in lighting. \n \nComponent 6. Renewable Energy for Street Lighting. Component \n6  consists  of  the  installation  of  1,000  solar  and  solar-wind \nstreetlights  in  Bhaktapur,  Kathmandu,  and  Lalitpur  municipal \nareas to reduce the burden on the main electricity grid. \n \nCapacity Building \nthe  Nepal \nComponent  7:  Component  7 \nElectricity  Authority  (NEA)  by  providing  expert  services \nto \nformulate,  design,  and  implement  public\u2013private  partnerships \n(PPPs) in three identified distribution areas, and capacity building \nand implementation support to the NEA for component 4. \n \nYears  of  underinvestment \nin  Nepal\u2019s  electricity  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution facilities have led to chronic supply \nshortages and network bottlenecks. As a consequence, the quality \nand  reliability  of  supply  provided  to  end  consumers  is  one  of  the \npoorest  in  South  Asia.  Electricity  supply  is  characterized  by \nfrequent unscheduled interruptions and long periods of scheduled \nsupply  outages.  The  power  sector  in  Nepal  presents  a  severe \ninfrastructure constraint on economic growth. \n \nThe  Government's  policies  and  actions  on  power  sector \ndevelopment  are  set  out  in  policy  documents  such  as  the \nHydropower  Development  Policy  2001, \nthe  National  Water \nResources  Strategy  2002,  and  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2002\u2013\n2007).  The  latest  policy  document  is  the  Interim  Plan  of  2008\u2013\n2010.  The  main  strategies  contained  in  the  Interim  Plan  include, \namong other things, (i) promoting good governance and effective \nservice  delivery,  and  (ii) \nin  physical \ninfrastructure including electricity. The targets set for the sector in \nthe  long-term  (up  to  2027)  are  (i)  generation  of  4,000  MW  of \npower  to  meet  domestic  demand;  (ii)  expansion  of  electricity \nservices to ensure coverage of 75% of the population through the \nnational  grid,  20%  through  isolated  small  and  micro-hydropower \nsystems,  and  5%  through  other  alternative  energy  sources;  and \n(iii)  increasing  per  capita  annual  electricity  consumption  to  400 \nkilowatt-hours  (kWh).  Further,  existing  legislative  provisions  and \nlaws  are  to  be  modified  to  support  establishing  the  Nepal \nElectricity  Regulation  Commission  and  restructuring  the  NEA  to \ncreate an environment more conducive to sector development. \n\ninvestment \n\nincreasing \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\niii \n\n \n\n \nThe  Government  has  progressed  on  the  Interim  Plan  to  improve \nsector  governance.  First,  as  an  interim  measure,  the  Electricity \nTariff  Fixation  Commission,  which  was  established  in  1994  and \nhas recently been inactive, has been reactivated as the economic \nregulator.  The  legislation  to  establish  an  independent  regulator \nand restructuring of the NEA is at an advanced stage. Second, the \nNEA  already  has  an  internal  structure  separating  generation, \ntransmission, distribution, electrification, and other functional units \nwhich  facilitates  efficient  management  and  effective  regulation  of \nthe  NEA  by  the  economic  regulator.  Making  these  divisions  into \nindependent business units with their own balance sheets will be \nimportant  for  effective  regulation.  Third,  in  2009,  the  Cabinet \nappointed a high-level task force to provide recommendations on \nthe financial restructuring of the NEA. Finalizing and implementing \nthe  financial  restructuring  plan  will  be  an  important  factor  in \nensuring NEA financial sustainability. \n \nThe  proposed  loan  and  grants  will  directly  address  the  urgent \nneeds  attributed  to  the  electricity  supply  crisis  in  Nepal,  through \ntwo  hydropower  plants,  supply-side  energy \nrehabilitation  of \nefficiency,  and  demand-side  management.  The  transmission \nnetwork strengthening will also add supply capacity by increasing \nevacuation  of  power  from  hydropower  stations  in  the  western \nregion  and  allow  increased  energy  imports  across  the  western \nborder in the short term. \n \nIn  the  medium  term,  the  transmission  network  strengthening  will \nallow cross-border energy exports, while distribution strengthening \nwill  facilitate  additional  consumer  connections  and  increased \nenergy  efficiency.  PPPs  in  distribution  will  help  the  NEA  to  pilot \nprivate sector involvement in improving distribution efficiency.  \n \nThese  project  interventions  will  also  lead  to  improved  financial \nperformance  of  the  NEA  and  sustainability  of  the  sector  through \nincreased revenues, reduced losses, and improved efficiency. \n\n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  increased  access  to  electricity \nacross Nepal.  \n \nThe outcome will be a reliable and energy efficient power supply \nwith  increased  access  and  operational  efficiency  in  the  project \nareas. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $93.7  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $2.0 million. \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n\n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProject Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmount \n\nSource \nADB (ADF Loan)a \nCCFb \nCEFc \nSubtotal \nGovernment /NEA \nTotal Cost \n\n65.0 \n 0.3 \n 4.2 \n69.5 \n24.2 \n93.7 \n\n% \n69.0 \n0.3 \n4.7 \n74.0 \n26.0 \n100.0 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  ADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund,  CCF  = \nClimate Change Fund, CEF = Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean \nEnergy Financing Partnership Facility, NEA = Nepal Electricity Authority. \na For components 1\u20134 and 7.  \nb For component 5. \nc For component 6. \nSources: Nepal Electricity Authority and ADB estimates. \n \nA loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n41,127,000  ($65  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources will be provided to finance components 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nGrants of $4,500,000 will be provided, comprising $300,000 from \nthe Climate Change Fund to finance component 5 and $4,200,000 \nfrom the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility to finance component 6, both to be \nadministered by ADB.  \n \nThe Government will make the loan and grant proceeds available \nto  the  NEA  and  will  cause  the  proceeds  to  be  applied  to  the \nfinancing of subproject expenditures through separate, subsidiary \nloan and grant agreements, the terms of which will be acceptable \nto ADB. \n \nThe Asian Development Fund loan will be utilized up to 31 March \n2015.  The  grants  from  the  Climate  Change  Fund  and  the  Multi-\nDonor  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing \nPartnership Facility will be utilized up to 31 March 2013.  \n \nAsian Development Fund loan components: 30 Sept 2014 \nGrant components: 30 Sept 2012 \n \nNepal Electricity Authority \n \nThe  NEA  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  of  all  project \ncomponents.  A  project  management  unit  will  be  set  up  with \nresponsibility \nfor  day-to-day  coordination,  monitoring,  and \nreporting on project implementation. \n\n\f \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n \n\nv \n\n \n\n \nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB grant will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). \n \nInternational  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  used  for  all \nthe components, except one contract package under component 3 \n(clean  energy  plant  improvement)  and  the  single  package  under \ncomponent 5 (energy efficiency in lighting).  \n \nUnder  component  3,  direct  contracting  will  be  adopted  for \nprocurement  of  a  generator  excitation  system  which  will  be \nprocured  from  the  original  supplier  on  a  turnkey  basis.  The \ngenerator  excitation  system  has  a  powerful  impact  on  generator \ndynamic  performance  and  availability,  and  accordingly  ensures \nquality  of  generator  voltage  and  reactive  power.  Only  the \nthe  original  supplier  and/or \nequipment  manufactured  by \nmanufacturer  will  be  compatible  with  and  maintain  the  functional \nguarantees  of  the  original  plant.  National  competitive  bidding  will \nbe  used  for  selection  of  the  compact  fluorescent  lamp  supplier \nunder  component  5.  Shopping  procedures  will  be  used  for  the \nprocurement of standard specification goods in component 5 with \nestimated costs of less than $50,000. \n \nAdvance contracting for procurement of equipment and civil works \nand  recruitment  of  consultants  has  been  approved  for  all \ncomponents  of  the  project,  subject  to  these  being  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and safeguard \npolicies.  The  NEA  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance \ncontracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \nCapacity  building  consulting  services  in  component  7  will  be \nfor  project \nrequired \nimplementation  works, \nsupervision  of \nconstruction, and management for component 4, and design and \nimplementation of PPPs in distribution. \n \nThe  Climate  Change  Fund  will  finance  national  and  international \nconsultancy \nsupport  under \ncomponent 5. Under component 6, the Multi-Donor Clean Energy \nFund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  will \nfinance national consultancy services for implementation support, \nsupervision, monitoring, and capacity building. \n \nThe  NEA  will  select  and  engage  consultants  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  For  component  4, \nindividual experts will be recruited based on biodata submitted in \nspecific terms of reference for assignments. \n \n\nthe  NEA  with  support \nincluding  design, \n\nimplementation \n\nto  provide \n\nservices \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n(132  kilovolt \n\nto  efficiently  and \n\n[kV])  and  distribution \n\nreliably  evacuate  power \n\nBenefits  will  flow  from  the  incremental  electricity  consumption, \nincreased  reliability  of  electricity  supply,  and  resource  cost \nsavings.  These  benefits  will  be  made  possible  by  (i)  increased \ncapacity \nfrom \n(33  kV) \ntransmission \nsubstations  to  serve  existing  and  forecast  demand,  (ii)  reduced \ntechnical and non technical losses at transmission and distribution \nlevels,  (iii)  increased  capacity  for  cross-border  power  trade,  (iv) \nefficient  management,  and  (v)  increased  efficiency  of  electricity \nend use. \n \nThe Project will improve access to an estimated 20,000 additional \nhouseholds  by  strengthening  the  distribution  network.  It  will \nimprove  the  supply  reliability  to  about  1.5  million  of  all  existing \nconsumers  with  increased  power  import  capacity,  additional \ngeneration  capability,  efficient  management,  energy  efficiency, \nand demand management. \n \nThe  demand-side  management  components  of  the  project  will \nresult  in  the  reduction  of  an  estimated  15,000\u201320,000  tons  (t)  of \ncarbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emissions  annually.  Human  safety\u2014\nparticularly  of  women  and  children  using  the  main  streets  in \nBhaktapur,  Kathmandu,  and  Lalitpur  will  also  improve  due  to \nbetter street lighting. \n \nThere is an overall risk to the Project from a potential deterioration \nof the political situation with possible changes in government and \nprolonged  and  disruptive  political  transition.  This  could  impede \nproject implementation and the pace of the proposed institutional \nand  policy  reforms  in  the  sector.  However,  given  the  critical \nimportance  of  improving  power  supply  and  the  efficiency  of  the \npower sector in the face of the acute power shortages the country \nhas  been  facing,  the  proposed  project  activities  and  reform \nactions  should  be  high  on  any  incoming  government's  agenda. \nAlso,  given \nthe  proposed  reforms  (financial \nrestructuring  of  the  NEA,  strengthening  the  regulatory  authority, \nand  internally  separating  the  NEA's  operations)  and  project \nactivities (expanding transmission and distribution lines, improving \nenergy  efficiency,  and  developing  renewable  energy),  political \ndisturbances  such  as  those  being  experienced  currently  are \nunlikely  to  have  any  major  adverse  implications  for  effective  and \ntimely implementation. However, the fragile political situation and \nweak  governance  situation  does  pose  a  risk  to  procurement \nactivities  under  the  Project.  Special  efforts  to  closely  monitor  the \nproject and procurement activities along with regular and intensive \npolicy  dialogue  on  the  proposed  reform  actions  will  help  to \nmitigate these potential risks. \n \nThe  other  risks  specific  to  the  Project  are  (i)  delayed  project \nimplementation, (ii) inadequate capacity to implement the Project, \n(iii) failure to resolve safeguard issues in a timely manner, and (iv) \n\nthe  nature  of \n\n\fvii \n\n \n\nand \n\npreparation \n\nbeen  mitigated \n\nthe  impact  of  external  macroeconomic  and  financial  cost  factors \nand revenue projections on the viability of the Project. \n \nAdequate  measures  have  been  taken  to  ensure  a  high  level  of \nproject  readiness  through  training  of  executing  agency  staff  and \nthe  approval  of  advance  contracting.  Potential  safeguard  issues \nhave \nearly \nthrough \nimplementation  of  environmental  management  plans  and \nresettlement plans. The sensitivity analyses carried out in relation \nto  the  economic  and  financial  analysis  indicate  that  the  rates  of \nreturn are robust. \n \nADB  is  preparing  a  capacity  development  technical  assistance \nproject  for  the  Government  and  the  NEA  to  strengthen  their \ncapacity  in  power  system  planning,  regulation,  best  practices  in \nrural electrification, and materials management. ADB support will \nalso be provided for the Government to finalize the NEA financial \nrestructuring  plan  in  the  form  of  consultancy  services  to  the \nCabinet-appointed  committee  through  the  ongoing  small-scale \nproject preparatory technical assistance.  \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan,  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  grants  to  be  provided  by  the  Climate  Change  Fund1 \nand the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund2 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nto Nepal for the Energy Access and Efficiency Improvement Project. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nBackground, Performance Indicators, and Analysis \n\nThe  power  sector  in  Nepal,  with  its  vast  hydropower  potential,  could  be  expected  to \n2. \ncontribute  to  the  country's  economic  development  in  a  significant  way.  Instead,  the  years  of \nunderinvestment  in  electricity  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  facilities  have  led  to \nchronic supply shortages and network bottlenecks. The quality and reliability of supply provided \nto end-consumers are among the poorest in South Asia. An analysis of these issues is provided \nin Appendix 2. \n \n3. \nThe total installed generation capacity of Nepal was 615 megawatts (MW) at the end of \n2008  and  the  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  (NEA)  owned  75%  of  it.  The  transmission  network, \nwhich  is  almost  totally  owned  and  operated  by  the  NEA,  has  1,900  kilometers  (km)  of  132 \nkilovolt  (kV)  and  66  kV  lines.  The  grid  electrification  rate  is  33%  of  households,  and  98%  of \nthese 1.5 million electricity consumers are served by the NEA. The private sector is responsible \nfor 25% of installed generation capacity; a private sector distribution company and community \norganizations serve about 2% of consumers.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nInfrastructure \n\n4. \nNepal\u2019s  electricity  generation  mix  is  dominated  by  run-of-river  and  daily  storage \nhydropower  plants,  which  represent  around  80%  of  total  installed  capacity.  The  dominance  of \nthese plants has led to periods of acute capacity and energy shortages during the dry season. \nIn FY2008, an estimated 430 gigawatt-hours (GWh) equivalent of planned power interruptions \nwere  carried  out.  The  transmission  infrastructure  is  in  moderate  condition  and  related  energy \nlosses  are  estimated  at  around  6%.  While  timely  commissioning  of  certain  new  transmission \nlines  is  critical  to  maintaining  system  stability,  inadequate  transmission  capacity  is  hampering \nfurther  private  investment  in  power  generation.  Several  independent  power  producers  (IPPs) \nhave been unable to undertake new power development initiatives because of the difficulties in \npower  evacuation.  The  grid  electricity  coverage  in  the  country  is  limited  to  only  33%  of \nhouseholds.  Technical  and  commercial  losses  in  the  distribution  networks  have  been  high  for \nmany years due to underinvestment. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Sustainability of the Sector \n\n5. \nIn recent years the NEA\u2019s financial performance has been poor, due to energy costs and \noperating  expenses  increasing  faster  than  revenues.  It  has  only  been  able  to  meet  cash \n                                                 \n1  Administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2  Contributors to the fund are the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden; the fund is administered by \n\nADB. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\noperating  expenses  and  maintain  ongoing  capital  investment  by  deferring  payment  of  interest \nduring  construction,  debt  service,  and  royalty  payments.  Thus,  the  NEA\u2019s  finances  require \nsubstantive restructuring, principally by converting some Government loans to equity, reducing \nGovernment  onlending  rates  on  loans,  and  utilizing  royalties  paid  to  the  Government  to  partly \ncover  the  NEA\u2019s  rural  electrification  losses.  The  Government  is  examining  the  restructuring \noptions for the NEA, and has given a firm commitment that action will be taken. The World Bank \nhas already provided capacity development technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the financial \nmanagement  system  of  the  NEA  with  necessary  support  for  hardware,  software,  and  related \ntraining.  \n \n6. \nThe  financial  performance  of  the  sector  can  also  be  improved  by  full  exploitation  of \nhydropower potential and related investment in transmission and distribution networks which will \nincrease  revenue.  Creating  an  effective  regulatory  environment  by  developing  capacity  and \noperational  independence  within  the  Electricity  Tariff  Fixation  Commission  (ETFC)  and \nDepartment  of  Electricity  Development  (DOED)  will  substantially  contribute  to  increased \nperformance in the sector through consumer tariffs which reflect costs. The investments in loss \nreduction and efficiency improvements through demand- and supply-side management will also \nenhance  sector  performance  by  reducing  the  cost  of  supply.  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  has  been  providing  assistance  to  implement  these  measures  through  its  technical  and \ninvestment support, including this proposed Project. \n \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n7. \nNepal\u2019s first official hydropower policy in 1992, which was followed by the Electricity Act \n1992, provided a provisional legal and policy basis for private participation in the power sector. \nSoon IPPs began setting up and operating small power plants. The build-own-operate-transfer \nmodality laid out in the Hydropower Policy 1992 still provides the framework for public\u2013private \npartnerships  (PPPs)  in  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  Of  the  total  installed \ngeneration  capacity  of  617  MW,  17  IPPs  contribute  156  MW.  The  NEA  has  signed  power \npurchase  agreements  with  22  additional  IPPs  totaling  68  MW  of  capacity,  which  is  under \nconstruction. In the transmission subsector, 107 km of transmission lines are privately owned. In \naddition  to  one  large  privately  owned  electricity  distribution  company  supplying  23,000 \nconsumers,  there  are  many  community-managed  distribution  schemes  scattered  across  the \ncountry. \n \n8. \nTo  increase  private  sector  participation  in  generation,  ADB  initiated  the  ongoing  TA  on \nPPPs  in  hydropower  development 3  This  TA  has  three  main  objectives:  (i)  providing \nrecommendations  for  an  enabling  framework  for  private  sector  participation,  (ii)  assisting  and \nadvising the bidding process, and (iii) capacity building in the licensing authority\u2014the DOED. \n \n\n4. \n\nGovernment Policies and Sector Road Map \n\n9. \nIn  July  2007  the  National  Planning  Commission  released  the  3-year  interim  plan \ncovering  2008\u20132010,  identifying  the  major  development  interventions  in  Nepal.  The  long-term \nvision for the power sector is the utilization of water resources to meet domestic power demand \nand  the  export  of  surplus  power  to  increase  the  country\u2019s  foreign  exchange  earnings.  The \ntargets set for the sector in the long-term (up to 2027) are (i) generating 4,000 MW of power to \nmeet  domestic  demand;  (ii)  expanding  electricity  services  to  ensure  coverage  of  75%  of  the \npopulation  through  the  national  grid,  20%  through  isolated  small  and  micro-hydropower \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Power Sector. Manila. \n\n\fsystems, and 5% through other alternative energy sources; and (iii) increasing per capita annual \nelectricity consumption to 400 kWh. \n \n10. \nSome of the key strategies adopted to achieve these targets are (i) introducing effective \nregulation of generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and related businesses; (ii) \nadopting  a  one-stop-shop  approach  to  encourage  investments  in  hydropower  development  to \nallow  investors  to  obtain  all  approvals  from  a  single  agency;  (iii)  consistent  efforts  in  the \nexpansion of electricity generation potential; (iv) expanding transmission capacity, targeting both \nlocal  consumption  and  export  potential;  and  (v)  strengthening  and  expanding  the  electricity \ndistribution system. \n \n11. \nExisting  legislation  is  being  modified  to  support  establishing  the  Nepal  Electricity \nRegulation  Commission  and  restructuring  the  NEA  and  other  sector  participants  for  efficient \nsector operation. Electricity tariffs will be rationalized, taking into account the cost of supply and \nthe  need  to  ensure  lifeline  tariffs  or  other  measures  to  protect  the  poor.  The  transmission \nsystem  will  be  strengthened  to  ensure  effective  transmission  of  new  hydropower-derived \nelectricity to demand centers. Electricity losses will be minimized. Consumers\u2019 interests will be \nprotected by ensuring that electricity services are of adequate quality and are dependable and \neasily  accessible.  Appropriate  pricing  signals  will  be  sent  to  consumers  to  encourage  efficient \nelectricity consumption. \n \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n12. \nEffective  Regulatory  Intervention.  The  ETFC  has  not  given  approval  to  the  NEA  to \nrevise consumer electricity tariffs since 2001, and hence tariffs have declined by around 40% in \nreal terms. Presently, the NEA\u2019s average cost of supply is greater than the average consumer \ntariff,  which  seriously  affects  its  ability  to  invest  in  and  maintain  its  assets.  This  issue,  among \nothers,  highlights  the  need  for  effective  regulation  in  the  power  sector.  ADB  has  ongoing \ndialogue with the Government on the new electricity act, which provides for the establishment of \nan independent electricity regulator, and on the interim arrangement for the ETFC to function as \nthe  economic  regulator.  ADB  will  provide  TA  support  for  capacity  building  in  the  ETFC  and  in \nthe  new  regulatory  agency.  The  TA  will  also  help  the  NEA  to  respond  to  regulatory \nrequirements.  \n \n13. \nSystem  Loss  Reduction.  Energy  losses  in  the  NEA\u2019s  transmission  and  distribution \nnetworks are significant. Systemwide losses are approximately 25% of generation. Inadequate \nattention to regular maintenance in low-voltage distribution networks, overextension of medium \nvoltage  and  low-voltage  lines,  and  pilferage  contribute  to  the  high  loss  levels.  ADB\u2019s  dialogue \nwith  the  Government  on  system  losses  focuses  on  (i)  the  need  for  independent  regulation  to \nenforce  realistic  loss  reduction  targets  for  the  NEA,  and  (ii)  the  need  to  design  and  maintain \nmedium  voltage  and  low-voltage  networks  so  that  technical  and  commercial  losses  are \nminimized. \n \n14. \nHydropower Development. Despite the large hydropower potential, Nepal experiences \nmajor  generation  capacity  constraints.  This  potential  can  be  harnessed  to  at  least  satisfy  the \nlocal  demand  by  establishing  small  and  medium-sized  plants  by  removing  barriers  to  their \ndevelopment.  ADB  has  ongoing  TA  to  provide  recommendations  to  overcome  these  barriers. \nThese  include  creating  an  enabling  framework  for  private  sector  participation  and  developing \nrelated  capacity  within  the  licensing  authority.  ADB  will  have  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment to implement those recommendations.  \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n6. \n\nADB\u2019s Power Sector Strategy for Nepal \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s  power  sector  strategy  in  Nepal  is  aligned  with  Nepal's  Three  Year  Interim  Plan \n(2008\u20132010)4.  Further,  it  is  based  on  all  four  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for \n2010\u22122014 5 :  (i)  broad-based  and  inclusive  high  economic  growth,  (ii)  inclusive  social \ndevelopment, (iii) governance and state strengthening, and (iv) climate change and environment \nsustainability.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for  the  power  sector  in  Nepal  will  have  six  main  priorities:  (i) \nimproving  access  to  electricity,  (ii)  increased  energy  efficiency,  (iii)  clean  power  development, \n(iv) regional cooperation, (v) strengthening sector governance, and (vi) promoting private sector \nparticipation. \n \n\n7. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nIn the past, the efficiency and sustainability of ADB-funded projects6 were affected by the \n16. \npolitical instability leading to lack of policy, institutional reforms, and capacity constraints in the \npower  sector.  With  the  improved  political  environment,  ADB  has  been  assisting  to  address \nthese issues through its TA. The proposed project and the proposed capacity development TA \nalso  provide  assistance  in  this  regard.  The  past  ADB-financed  power  projects  suffered \nimplementation  delays  due  to  failures  in  meeting  loan  effectiveness  conditions  and  slow \nrecruitment of consultants and procurement. Once the contracts were awarded, implementation \ngenerally proceeded smoothly, except for one project component that encountered difficulties in \nacquiring land for a substation and obtains agreement on the compensation for the transmission \nline  right  of way.  The  lessons  learned  have  been  considered  in  the  design  and  preparation  of \nthe  proposed  project  to  avoid  implementation  delays.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  of \nthe NEA (as the executing agency) was conducted, and on-the-job training provided during due \ndiligence  to  ensure  the  early  preparation  of  consultants  recruitment  documentation  and  bid \ndocuments.  The  proposed  project  components  are  now  at  a  high  level  of  readiness  for \nimplementation, and advance contracting has been approved. Environmental management and \nresettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  and  the  sites  for  project  components  and  routing  of \ntransmission  lines  have  been  designed  to  avoid  densely  populated  and  ecologically  sensitive \nareas  to  minimize  environmental  and  involuntary  resettlement  problems.  Impractical  and \nunrealistic loan effectiveness conditions, in terms of actions and time frame, have been avoided. \n \n\n8. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n17. \nThe  power  sector  in  Nepal  has  received  assistance  from  various  international \ndevelopment  partners.  In  addition  to  ADB  being  a  major  development  partner  in  the  power \nsector,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  the  World  Bank  have  been \nmajor  sources  of  external  funding  to  the  sector,  focusing  on  sector  reforms,  strengthening  of \nfinancial  management  systems,  generation,  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  generation \nfacilities,  and  development  of  renewable  energy  resources.  In  addition,  bilateral  donors \nincluding  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (Credit  Institute  for  Reconstruction  [KfW]),  United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit (GTZ), Danish International Development Agency, and Norwegian Agency for \nDevelopment Cooperation have been active in the power sector. Further, the European Union, \nKuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic  Development,  Saudi  Fund  for  Development,  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  Department  for \n\n                                                 \n4 National Planning Commission, Nepal. 2008.

Manila \n\n\f9. \n\nRationale for the Project \n\nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  Finnish  Department  for  International \nDevelopment,  Government  of  France,  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  have  all \nprovided TA to the power sector. A description of external assistance to the Nepal power sector \nin the past is given in Appendix 3. \n \n \n \n18. \nThe  proposed  loan  will  address  urgent  needs  in  the  Nepal  power  sector  by  providing \nimmediate  relief  to  the  supply  crisis  in  Nepal  directly  through  rehabilitation  of  two  hydropower \nplants, supply-side energy efficiency, and demand-side management (DSM). The component on \ntransmission network strengthening will assist increased evacuation of power from hydropower \nstations in the western region and increased cross-border energy imports in the short term. In \nthe medium term, the transmission network strengthening will allow cross-border energy exports \nwhile  distribution  strengthening  will  facilitate  additional  consumer  connections  and  increased \nenergy  efficiency.  PPPs  in  distribution  will  help  the  NEA  to  pilot  private  sector  involvement  in \nimproving  distribution  efficiency.  These  project  interventions  will  lead  to  improved  financial \nperformance of the NEA and sustainability of the sector \n  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n19. \nThe impact of the Project will be increased access to clean electricity across the country. \nThe Project will address major infrastructure barriers to improved access by investments in the \ntransmission system, generation rehabilitation, distribution system, and efficiency in supply and \ndemand which will increase supply capacity and operational efficiency. \n \n20. \naccess and operational efficiency in the project areas.  \n \nB. \n\nThe Project\u2019s outcome will be reliable and energy efficient power supply with increased \n\nOutputs \n\nThe ADB loan will support investments under seven main components each consisting \n21. \nof one or more subprojects. The proposed new transmission and distribution components form \npart  of  the  least-cost  network  expansion  plans  of  the  NEA  planning  process  based  on  the \nnational  demand  forecast  produced  by  the  NEA.  The  proposed  generation  rehabilitation \ncomponent  forms  part  of  the  optimal  generation  rehabilitation  plans  of  the  NEA.  Best  practice \ndesign standards and construction techniques\u2014including adaptations to counter climate change \nincidents, e.g., flood and extreme weather\u2014will be applied to all investments. \n \n\n(i) \n\nComponent  1:  Facilitation  of  access  to  clean  energy.  This  component  will \ninclude the following subprojects: \n(a) \n\nDumre\u2013Damauli \n\nMiddle  Marsyangdi\u2013Marsyangdi, \nkV \ntransmission  line  and  related  substation  works.  This  subproject \ninvolves  construction  of  the  transmission  line  and  the  related  substation \nthat  will  improve  the  security  of  power  evacuation  from  the  newly \nconstructed  70  MW  Middle  Marshyangdi  hydropower  station,  and  will \nprovide general reinforcement through the Damauli substation. \nButwal\u2013Kohalpur 132 kV transmission line. This 200 km line section is \npart  of  the  400  km  Mahendranagar\u2013Butwal  transmission  line.  This \nsubproject involves stringing a transmission line along the second circuit \n\n132 \n\n(b) \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\nof the existing 132 kV line built on double circuit towers. Upgrading of the \nentire  Mahendranagar\u2013Butwal  transmission  line  could  increase  cross-\nborder trade by up to 100 MW.  \nConstruction  of  Chapali  substation.  This  subproject \ninvolves \nconstruction  of  the  Chapali  grid  substation,  extending  the  Lainchaur \nsubstation,  and  laying  an  underground  cable  between  Lainchaur  and \nChabel  required  to  strengthen  the  transmission  capability  in  the  central \nregion. \nthe \nExpansion  of  Matatirtha  substation.  The  western  part  of \nKathmandu  valley  is  relatively  well  served  with  132  kV  transformer \ncapacity.  However,  the  area  experiences  poor  power  supply  due  to  the \nload imposed upon, and the length of, 11kV feeders, resulting in frequent \nfeeder  tripping  and  high  losses.  This  subproject  will  reduce  the  average \n11 kV feeder length by converting the Matatirtha 132 kV switching station \ninto a full 132 kV substation. \nInstallation  of  capacitor  banks.  This  subproject  involves  installation of \napproximately 220 megavolt-ampere reactive (MVAr7) capacitor banks for \nreactive power compensation at eight transmission substations, improving \nthe voltage profile of the transmission network. \n\nComponent 2: Energy access quality enhancement. This component consists \nof constructing eight new 33/11 kV, 6/8 MVA primary distribution substations and \nthree  new  11  kV  switching  stations  to  strengthen  the  electric  system\u2019s  ability  to \nconnect  new  consumers  and  to  enhance  the  quality  of  electricity  supply  to \nexisting  consumers.  These  new  substations  will  reduce  the  incidence  of \nscheduled  and  unscheduled  power  supply  interruptions,  reduce  distribution \nsystem losses, and improve power supply quality. \nComponent  3:  Clean  energy  plant  improvement.  This  component  involves \nrehabilitating  two  run-of-river  hydropower  plants  at  Marsyangdi  (69  MW)  and \nGandak  (15  MW)  to  increase  the  efficiency  of  their  electricity  generation  and \nreduce  self-consumption  of  electricity.  As  a  result,  an  estimated  additional  4 \ngigawatt-hours (GWh) of energy will be supplied each year to the power system.  \nComponent 4: Supply-side energy efficiency improvement. This component \nwill develop a pilot project to rebuild selected distribution feeders and low-voltage \nnetworks  with  unacceptably  high  losses,  using  international  best  practice  for \ndesign,  construction,  and  commercial  operation,  to  reduce  both  technical  and \ncommercial  losses  in  the  Kathmandu  valley.  Sixteen  11  kV  feeders  and \ndownstream  low-voltage  networks  with  unacceptably  high  losses  have  been \nidentified by the NEA. This pilot project will become a model network that can be \nreplicated across Nepal. \nComponent  5:  Energy  efficiency  in  lighting.  This  component  involves  the \ndistribution  of  1  million  compact  fluorescent  lamps  (CFLs)  to  households  and \nCFL  program  implementation  support  to  improve  energy  efficiency  in  lighting. \nThe project will target domestic consumers in all electrified areas. It is expected \nthat this program will free up a minimum of 10 MW of power plant capacity and \npotentially  reduce  23  GWh  of  annual  consumption.  Assistance  will  also  be \nprovided for a public awareness campaign, an implementation consultant (local), \nand resources to establish a demand-side management (DSM) unit in the NEA.  \nAdditional details of this component are provided in Appendix 10. \n\n                                                 \n7 The reactive power capacity of the capacitor banks.  \n\n\f(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nComponent 6: Renewable energy for street lighting. This component consists \nof  installation  of  1,000  solar  and  solar-wind  streetlights  in  Bhaktapur,  Lalitpur, \nand  Kathmandu  municipal  areas  to  reduce  street  lighting  demand  on  the  main \nelectricity  grid.  The  activities  include  purchase  of  solar  and  solar-wind  hybrid \nstreet lighting systems, and replacing/installing and setting up a system to ensure \nproper  maintenance  through  the  NEA.  It  is  estimated  that  this  subproject  will \nreduce peak load demand by about 0.2 MW and save about 700 megawatt-hours \n(MWh)  per  year.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  assist  the  NEA  with \nprogram design and implementation.  Additional details of this component are in \nAppendix 11. \nComponent  7:  Capacity  building.  This component involves providing the NEA \nwith  expert  services  to  formulate,  design,  and  implement  pilot  PPP  projects  in \nlegislation, \nthree \nidentifying  appropriate  PPP  modalities,  identifying  pilot  areas,  preparing  legal \nagreements,  developing  bid  documents,  making \nfor \nimplementation, developing an implementation plan, monitoring the bid process, \nand overseeing final implementation. This component will also assist the NEA in \nimplementation support for component 4. \n\nidentified  distribution  areas.  This  will \n\ninvolve  reviewing \n\nrecommendations \n\n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n22. \nSupply-Side Energy Efficiency. The high network losses represent a heavy burden in \na  power  system  with  limited  supply.  Relieving  this  burden  is  the  least-cost  means  of  reducing \nthe demand and supply gap. The Project will tackle this problem by addressing inefficiencies on \nthe  supply  side  and  introducing  long-term,  replicable  solutions.  The  \u201cmodel  networks\u201d  concept \nwill demonstrate that loss minimization in distribution networks is a function of planning, design, \nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance.  When  best  practices  of  these  are  adhered  to, \nparticularly  in  the  often-ignored  low-voltage  parts  of  the  network,  more  efficient  networks  will \nresult. Clean Development Mechanism benefits will also be explored. \n \n23. \nDemand-Side  Management.  DSM  will  be  adopted  to  reduce  energy  consumed  for \nlighting,  which  represent  a  significant  component  of  total  electricity  demand  at  the  peak  load \ntimes. This involves introducing energy efficient lighting for households and solar or solar-wind \nbased  street  lighting  on  a  pilot  scale.  DSM  efforts  will  reduce  electricity  flowing  through \nupstream networks, which will reduce losses and free up generation output for other productive \nuses.  Implementation  and  capacity  building  support  will  also  be  provided  for  this  component. \nFurther, Clean Development Mechanism benefits under these subprojects will be explored. \n \n24. \nthe  Project,  strategic \nfranchising  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  will  be  developed  in  selected  urban  areas  to \nreduce  distribution  losses  and  improve  the  quality  of  service  to  consumers.  If  successful,  this \nscheme will be extended into other semi-urban and urban areas across Nepal. \n \nD. \n\nStrategic  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships  Scheme.

A summary financing plan is provided in Table 2.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nExecuting Agencies and Project Management \n\n28. \nThe NEA will be the executing agency with overall responsibility for the execution of all \ncomponents of the Project. A project management unit, headed by senior officers, will be set up \nby  October  2009  specifically  for  the  Project  for  necessary  coordination,  monitoring,  and \nreporting  on  the  day-to-day  project  implementation  activities  with  the  concerned  groups  of  the \nNEA.  Necessary  guidance  and  training  on  the  latest  ADB  procurement  guidelines  and \nprocedures  has  been  provided  to  the  NEA.  Based  on  the  assessment  of  its  procurement \ncapacity,  the  NEA  is  considered  to  be  fully  capable  of  implementing  the  Project.  The \nprocurement  capacity  assessment  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  E.  The  implementation \nstructure is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n29. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  including  procurement  and  construction \nactivities,  from  2010  to  2014.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  shown  in  Appendix  5. \nComponents 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 will be completed by 30 September 2014 and the corresponding \nfunds  will  be  utilized  for  a  period  ending  on  31  March  2015.  Components  5  and  6  will  be \ncompleted by 30 September 2012 and the corresponding funds will be utilized for a period up to \n31 March 2013. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\nAll procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \n30. \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  With  the  exception  of \none contract package under component 3 (clean energy plant improvement) and procurement \nunder component 5 (energy efficiency in lighting), international competitive bidding procedures \nwill  be  used  for  all  contracts  (11  turnkey  and  8  supply  contracts).  While  eight  packages  for \ncomponents  2  and  4  will  be  based  on  single-stage:one-envelope  bidding  procedures,  all  the \nother 11 packages will follow single-stage:two-envelope procedures. \n \n Under  component  3,  direct  contracting  will  be  adopted  for  procurement  of  a  generator \n31. \nexcitation  system,  which  has  a  powerful  impact  on  generator  dynamic  performance  and \navailability, and accordingly ensures quality of generator voltage and reactive power. Only the \nequipment  manufactured  by  the  original  supplier/manufacturer  will  be  compatible  with  and \nmaintain the functional guarantees of the original plant. Therefore, it will be procured from the \noriginal supplier on a turnkey basis. National competitive bidding will be used for selection of the \nCFL  supplier  under  component  5.  Shopping  procedures  will  be  used  for  the  procurement  of \nstandard specification goods in component 5 with estimated costs less than $50,000. The CFL \nsupplier will be paid by the NEA (who will in turn be reimbursed by ADB) based on the quantity \nof  CFLs  distributed  to  electricity  consumers  through  its  distribution  network  and  documentary \nevidence  of  such  distribution.  The  procurement  plan  including  an  indicative  list  of  contract \npackages is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n4. \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\n32. \nIn  order  to  expedite  implementation,  the  NEA  has  requested  ADB  to  approve  advance \ncontracting  actions  for  procurement  of  works,  goods,  and  services  subject  to  them  being  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  safeguard  policies.  ADB  has  already  approved \nadvance contracting and has informed the NEA that approval of advance contracting does not in \nany  way  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  The  project  readiness  schedule  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix K. \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\nFor component 4 (distribution loss reduction), the NEA requested consulting services to \n33. \nassist  its  implementation  of  the  project.  The  NEA  will  select  and  engage  one  individual \ninternational  consultant  and  one  individual  national  consultant  based  on  biodata  submitted  in \nresponse to terms of reference for the assignment. The process of advance contracting action \nfor recruiting consultants has been initiated by the NEA as normal procedures. These consulting \nservices are part of component 7. \n \n34. \nComponent  7  also  includes  capacity  building  and  implementation  support  for  the \nintroduction  of  distribution  PPPs.  The  NEA  will  select  and  engage  one  individual  international \nconsultant  and  one  individual  national  consultant  based  on  biodata  submitted  in  response  to \nterms of reference for the assignment. The NEA will also engage a national legal consultant to \nassist with a review of legislation and with legal drafting. The NEA has initiated the process of \nadvance contracting action for recruiting consultants as normal procedures.  \n \n35. \nThe Climate Change Fund grant will provide finance for one national consultant and one \ninternational  individual  consultant  for  implementation  support  under  component  5.  The  Multi-\nDonor  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  grant  will \nprovide finance for two individual national consultants for implementation support, supervision, \nmonitoring,  and  capacity  building  under  component  6.  The  ADF  grant  will  provide  finance  for \ninternational consulting services for component 7. \n \n36. \nThe NEA will select and engage consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services are in Supplementary \nAppendix H. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n37. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  and  the  NEA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  grant  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the NEA and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.

Imprest  fund  procedures  will  be  used  to  facilitate \ndisbursement  for  investment  in  component  5  funded  by  the  Multi-Donor  Clean  Energy  Fund \nunder the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. The imprest account will be established \nand  managed  by  the  NEA.  The  ceiling  of  the  initial  advance  of  the  imprest  account 8 will  not \nexceed  ADB\u2019s  estimated  share  of  eligible  project  expenditures  to  be  financed  through  the \nimprest  account  for  the  next  6  months,  or  10%  of  the  grant  amount,  whichever  is  lower. \nstatement of expenditure procedures may be used for reimbursement under all the components \nand liquidating/replenishing advances under component 5. The statement of expenditure ceiling \nwill  be  $50,000  for  individual  payments  applicable  to  reimbursement  and  imprest  fund \nprocedures.  Financial  management  capacity  assessment  and  previous  experience  shows  that \nthe NEA has adequate capacity and controls to implement these procedures. \n \n\n                                                 \n8 Bank charges for imprest account operations will be charged to the Asian Clean Energy Fund.  \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n39. \nThe accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the Project will be \nestablished  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  and  practices  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The \nNEA will maintain separate accounts for the different components. Within 6 months of the close \nof the financial year, the NEA will submit (i) annual project accounts, with detailed descriptions \nof  the  sources  of  receipts  and  expenditures;  (ii)  annual  financial  statements  comprising  an \nincome  statement,  balance  sheet,  statement  of  cash  flows,  and  related  notes  to  the  financial \nstatements  and  consolidated  for  all  operations;  and  (iii)  procedures  for  the  imprest  accounts \nand/or  statement  of  expenditures.  The  auditors  will  also  prepare  a  memorandum  on  issues \nidentified during the audit process, to be submitted with the respective reports. The auditors will \nbe required to provide an opinion on the NEA's compliance with ADB\u2019s financial covenants. For \ncomponent  5,  the  NEA  will  report  to  ADB  every  quarter,  without  limitation,  on  the  overall \nportfolio performance. If requested by ADB, the NEA will provide ADB with certification that ADB \nfunds  have  been  used  to  provide  CFLs  to  households  and  that  those  who  received  funds \nactually purchased CFLs under this component. The use of imprest accounts and statement of \nexpenditure will also be part of the annual audit, as will a separate opinion on the use of imprest \naccounts and statement of expenditure. \n \n\n9. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n40. \nThe NEA will prepare progress reports for its respective parts and submit these to ADB \nwithin 30 days from the end of each quarter. Each report will provide a narrative description of \n(i) progress made during the period, (ii) changes in the implementation schedule, (iii) problems \nor difficulties encountered, (iv) the performance of the project implementation consultants, and \n(v) the work to be carried out in the next period. The report will also include summary financial \naccounts for each component, consisting of project expenditures for the year to date and total \nexpenditure to date. Performance will be evaluated based on indicators and targets stipulated in \nthe design and monitoring framework. \n \n\n10.  Project Review \n\nADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of loan approval. ADB will review the \n41. \nimplementation and operation of the projects based on the quarterly progress reports and meet \nwith  the  NEA  and  the  Government  twice  a  year  to  discuss  the  progress  of  each  part  of  the \nProject and any changes to implementation arrangements or remedial measures that need to be \ntaken.  A  midterm  review  will  be  carried  out  2  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  focusing  on  the \nengineering, resettlement, and environmental aspects of the investment program, and reviewing \nthe financial status of the NEA. The NEA will submit a project completion report to ADB within \n3 months of physical completion of the projects. \n \n\nIV. \n\nCAPACITY DEVELOPMENT \n\n42. \nADB has been providing capacity development support to the Nepal power sector on a \ncontinuous basis, addressing its needs from time to time.

The NEA with the assistance of the World Bank is upgrading and computerizing its system of \ncontrols  and  accounting,  including  segregation  of  costs  into  internal  business  units,  to  allow \ngreater  transparency  for  regulatory  intervention.  The  updated  financial  accounting  system  will \nmeet the requirements of national and international accounting standards and will include cost \nand  management  information  systems  to  support  timely  business  decision  making  by  NEA's \nmanagers.  Capacity  building  will  include  on-the-job  training  for  NEA  staff  in  financial \nmanagement,  internal  control,  and  internal  audit.  The  proposed  project  financial  management \narrangements are considered satisfactory. \n \n\n2. \n\nPast Financial Performance and Future Projections \n\n44. \nOver  the  past  10  years,  NEA's  financial  position  has  continued  to  deteriorate  with  no \ntariff  increases  since  FY2001  and  rising  costs  of  energy  purchases  and  operations.  The  NEA \nhas been implementing the Government\u2019s rural electrification policy, which is characterized by \nhigh costs and low revenues. The NEA has only been able to meet its cash operating expenses \n\n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fand maintain ongoing capital investment in recent years by deferring payment of interest during \nconstruction, interest, and principal repayments, and by delaying royalty payments. \n \n45. \nThe  future  financial  performance  of  the  NEA  was  analyzed  under  various  financial \nrestructuring scenarios, including (i) converting some Government loans to equity; (ii) reducing \nonlending  rates  on  Government  loans  to  the  NEA  from  8%  to  5%;  (iii)  utilizing  a  share  of \nroyalties  currently  paid  by  the  NEA  to  cover  the  NEA  losses  on  rural  electrification;  (iv) \nGovernment to fund unit cost escalation, on FY2009 prices, for the NEA\u2019s electricity purchases \nfrom  India  and  IPPs  necessary  to  meet  generation  shortfalls;  and  (v)  a  combination  of  these \nscenarios. Details are provided in Appendix 7. The cumulative cash flow benefit to the NEA from \nthe  scenarios  analyzed  is  NRs42.6  billion  during  2010\u20132015.  Tariff  increases  are  therefore \nunavoidable; increases in the order of 8% per annum from 2012 through to 2015 would produce \na positive cash flow for the NEA by the end of 2015. A high-level task force has been appointed \nby the Government to provide recommendations on the financial restructuring of the NEA.  \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n46. \nFinancial analysis was undertaken for the major components (1, 2, and 4) of the Project \nby comparing project-related incremental revenues at the present average tariff with incremental \ncapital and operating costs. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is calculated at 12.2% for \ncomponent 1, 8.0% for component 2, and 5.9% for component 4. The overall FIRR for the three \ncomponents is 11.0%. The FIRR compares favorably with the estimated weighted average cost \nof  capital  of  1.3%,  substantiating  the  Project\u2019s  financial  viability.  The  sensitivity  analyses \ndemonstrated the results were robust to standard sensitivities. Details of the financial analysis \nare in Appendix 8. \n \n\n4. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nEconomic  analysis  was  undertaken  for  the  major  components  of  the  Project.  The \n47. \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  were  calculated  by  comparing  with-project  and \nwithout-project scenarios. Incremental consumption occurs because of the extended availability \nof  electricity  during  peak  demand  periods.  Incremental  consumption  was  valued  using \nconsumers\u2019 willingness  to  pay.  Non-incremental  consumption  occurs  as  other  forms  of  energy \nare  displaced  by  the  project  outputs  (the  resource  cost  saving).  This  was  valued  using  the \nmarginal cost of generation on the grid against the long term average economic cost of captive \ngeneration or kerosene for lighting. Analysis was undertaken on a time-of-year and time-of-day \nbasis.  The  EIRR  for  component  1  was  19.3%,  for  component  2  it  was  16.9%,  and  for \ncomponent 4 it was 18.7%. The EIRR of the aggregated subprojects is estimated to be 18.0%. \nThe  Project  also  demonstrates  robust  economic  performance  under  a  range  of  downside \nsensitivity  tests.  A  summary  of  the  economic  analysis  is  presented  in  Appendix  9.  Detailed \nanalysis is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Poverty Analysis \n\nA  full  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  consultation  with  affected  parties,  local \n48. \nauthorities, and the NEA, in accordance with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), and \nthe relevant sections of the Operations Manual. Because no impact is expected on indigenous \npeoples  communities,  but  only  on  individual  households,  no  indigenous  peoples  development \nplan was prepared. However, in accordance with ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), \nadditional compensation will be awarded to vulnerable groups, including indigenous people, as \nper the provisions in the resettlement plan.  \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f \n49. \nThe  project  will  entail  limited  permanent  acquisition  of  agricultural  land  (4.66  hectares \n[ha])  and  temporary  restriction  of  use  for  21.39  ha.  To  minimize  and  avoid  damage  and  crop \ndisruption,  tower  construction  and  line  stringing  will  be  carried  out  in  the  off-season  whenever \npossible.  A  total  of  314  households  will  be  affected  by  the  project,  of  which  only  22  will  be \nsignificantly  affected.  Of  these  only  two  will  be  affected  by  the  loss  of  more  than  10%  of  their \nland;  the  remaining  20  households  will  be  affected  by  the  loss  of  structures.  The  entitlement \nmatrix  provides  for  compensation  at  full  replacement  cost.  Among  these,  14  households  fall \nunder  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples.  Special  provisions  were  included  in  the \nresettlement plan to address their needs. \n \n50. \nThe resettlement plan was translated into the local language and is being disclosed to all \naffected  people.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in  Appendix  12.    The \nsummary resettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix I and the full resettlement plan is in \nSupplementary  Appendix  F  (i).  A  detailed  socioeconomic  analysis  of  the  project-affected \npopulations is as in Supplementary Appendix F (ii). \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n51. \nEnvironmental  assessments  have  been  carried  out  for  all  the  subprojects  in  the  seven \nproject  components,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  NEA  has  either  completed  or  is  carrying  out  the \nenvironmental assessment process for the subprojects under the Environmental Protection Act \n(1997) and Environmental Protection Rules (1997 as amended). The Project has been assigned \ncategory B under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. An initial environmental examination (IEE) and a \nsummary IEE have been prepared covering all the subprojects regardless of the exemption of \nall  except  one  subproject  from  IEE/environmental  impact  assessment  requirements  under  the \nprevailing environmental laws in Nepal.  \n \n52. \nEnvironmental impacts of the subprojects on transmission lines and substations are not \nsignificant  and  are  mostly  confined  to  the  right-of-way  of  those  facilities.  There  are  some \nnegative impacts on natural and socioeconomic resources during the land acquisition for some \nsubprojects  and  construction  activities.  The  construction  of  the  Dumre\u2013Damauli  transmission \nline  involves  only  small-scale  excavation  for  tower  foundations  at  scattered  locations  that  are \nrefilled  with  excavated  materials.  Therefore,  uncontrolled  silt  run-off  is  not  expected.  The  best \nengineering practices will be used to prevent soil erosion during erection of transmission towers \non  slopes  and  erosion-prone  soils.  Adequate  steps  will  be  taken  to  resurface  the  area  after \nconstruction.  On  the  sites  which  are  likely  to  be  affected  by  active  erosion  or  landslides,  both \nbiological  and  engineering  treatment  will  be  carried  out,  including  provision  of  retaining  walls, \nsowing  soil-binding  grasses  at  the  site,  and  routine  bioengineering  measures.  Construction \nactivities  will  be  discouraged  in  the  rainy  season.  During  operation,  the  land  area  under  the \ntransmission  line  can  be  used  for  agriculture.  The  footings  of  the  towers  are  acquired \npermanently  and  compensated  for  at  100%  of  the  land  value.  Vegetation  will  be  trimmed  for \nminimum required clearance for the conductors. To minimize the risk of accidents and exposure \nto electric fields, houses and other structures will not be allowed within the right-of-way. \n \n53. \nIt  is  concluded  that  there  is  no  significant  environmental  or  social impact  of the  project \ncomponents,  in  either  the  short  or  long  term.  Some  impacts  that  may  arise  during  the \nconstruction  stage  are  temporary  and  insignificant  and  can  be  made  to  be  at  the  acceptable \nlevel  with  the  application  of  appropriate  mitigation  measures.  There  are  negligible  impacts \nduring  the  operation  stage.  The  components  on  generation  rehabilitation,  distribution  loss \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\freduction, CFLs, and solar street lighting contribute to reduction in emissions and hence have \npositive environmental impacts. These reductions result from avoidance of petroleum products \nuse  in  domestic  lighting,  standby  generation,  and  even  coal-based  cross-border  electricity \nimports.  However,  the  contractor  and  the  NEA  need  to  incorporate  recommended  mitigation \nmeasures in all stages of the Project. Although the contractors have the primary responsibility \nfor implementation of the mitigation measures during construction, the NEA will be responsible \nfor overall implementation of the environmental management plan.  \n \nD. \n\nBenefits and Beneficiaries  \n\nlines,  substation  construction,  and  even  post-construction \n\n54. \nThe Project will improve access for an estimated 20,000 additional households through \nstrengthening the distribution network. It will improve the reliability of supply to about 1.5 million \nexisting  consumers  with  increased  power  import  capacity,  additional  generation  capability, \nefficient  management,  energy  efficiency,  and  demand  management.  The  DSM  components  of \nthe  Project  will  result  in  the  reduction  of  an  estimated  15,000\u201320,000  t  of  CO2  emissions \nannually.  Human  safety\u2014particularly  of  women  and  children  using  the  main  streets  in \nBhaktapur, Kathmandu, and Lalitpur\u2014will also improve due to better street lighting. \n \n55. \nThe  Project  is  likely  to  have  a  positive  effect  on  households  below  the  poverty  level  in \nterms  of  per  capita  cash  income.  Semiskilled  and  unskilled  local  laborers  are  likely  to  have \naccess to employment opportunities during the construction of towers, stringing of new 132 kV \ntransmission \nfor  repair  and \nmaintenance and vegetation clearance along the right of way of the transmission lines. \n \nPoverty  reduction  impacts  of  the  project  are  expected  in  a  few  areas.  The  rural \n56. \ncommunities  will  benefit  from  the  access  to  cleaner  energy  improving  health  and  sanitation, \neducation, and access to information. The newly electrified households will have the opportunity \nto  start  different  income-generating  activities.  Local  income-generation  activities  will  be \ndeveloped in the project sites. The local economy will improve due to the increased business for \nrestaurants, markets, and retail premises after the mobilization of construction teams. Reliable \nelectricity will create industrial growth and increase production in the existing industries. This will \ngenerate  employment  opportunities.  Project  areas  as  well  as  other  adjoining  locations  will \nbenefit from an increased industry activity. \n \nE. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nThere  is  an  overall  risk  to  the  Project  from  a  potential  deterioration  of  the  political \n57. \nsituation  with  changes  in  government  and  prolonged  political  transition.  However,  given  the \ncritical importance of improving power supply and efficiency of the power sector, the proposed \nproject  activities  and  reform  actions  should  be  high  on  any  government's  agenda.  Also,  given \nthe  nature  of  the  proposed  reforms  and  project  activities,  political  disturbances  are  unlikely  to \nhave  major  adverse  implications  for  effective  and  timely  implementation,  although  the  fragile \npolitical and weak governance situation pose a risk to procurement activities under the Project. \nSpecial efforts to closely monitor the project and procurement activities along with regular and \nintensive  policy  dialogue  on  the  proposed  reform  actions  will  help  to  mitigate  these  potential \nrisks. \n \n58. \nThe  other  risks  specific  to  the  Project  are  (i)  delayed  project  implementation,  (ii) \ninadequate capacity to implement the Project, (iii) failure to resolve safeguard issues in a timely \nmanner, and (iv) the impact of external macroeconomic and financial cost factors and revenue \nprojections on the viability of the Project. Adequate measures have been taken to ensure a high \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\flevel of project readiness through training of NEA staff and the approval of advance contracting. \nPotential  safeguard  issues  have  been  mitigated  through  preparation  and  early  implementation \nof  environmental  management  and  resettlement  plans.  The  sensitivity  analyses  carried  out  in \nrelation to the economic and financial analysis indicate that the rates of return are robust. \n  \n59. \nIn addition, ADB is preparing capacity development TA for the Government and the NEA \nto  strengthen  their  capacity  in  power  system  planning,  regulation,  best  practices  in  rural \nelectrification,  and  materials  management.  ADB  support  will  also  be  provided  for  the \nGovernment to finalize the NEA financial restructuring plan. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  the  NEA  have  given  the \n\n60. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n1. \n\nProject Execution and Implementation Arrangements \n\n \n61. \nThe Government shall also ensure that (i) the project management unit is managed and \noperated  by  a  full-time  project  director  reporting  to  the  managing  director,  acceptable  to  ADB; \nand  (ii)  the  project  director  is  supported  by  competent  full-time  senior  officers  of  the  NEA  and \nother personnel acceptable to ADB. \n \nThe  NEA  shall  appoint  a  separate  project  manager  to  ensure  that  all  day-to-day \n62. \noperations  for  each  subproject  under  components  1  and  3,  and  for  components  2  and  4, \nincluding  procurement  and  accounting,  are  conducted  by  persons  within  the  relevant  NEA \ndivision.

The Ministry of Energy\u2019s Department of Electricity Development is responsible for \npromoting the development of hydropower resources, preparing standards for transmission and \ndistribution  of  electricity,  and  inspection  and  monitoring.  The  Electricity  Tariff  Fixation \nCommittee was established to review and approve tariff filings by the Nepal Electricity Authority \n(NEA)  and  other  licensed  entities  under  the  Electricity  Act  1992.  The  Electricity  Tariff  Fixation \nCommittee  is  expected  to  be  replaced  by  an  independent  Nepal  electricity  regulatory \ncommission; the legislation is awaiting Parliamentary approval. The NEA, a wholly government-\nowned  corporation,  dominates  Nepal\u2019s  power  sector.  It  is  responsible  for  most  of  Nepal\u2019s \nelectricity generation, dispatch, transmission, distribution, and retailing. It operates hydropower \nplants with a total installed capacity of 407 megawatt (MW), two diesel plants with total installed \ncapacity of 53 MW, and two small (50 kilowatt [kW]) solar power stations. \n \n2. \nThere has been private sector  participation in the Nepal power sector since 1992, with \nthe  Hydropower  Development  Policy  19921 and  the  Electricity  Act  1992.  Since  the  legislative \nchanges required to implement certain components of the Hydropower Policy 2001 have not yet \nbeen  enacted,  The  Hydropower  Policy  1992  still  provides  the  framework  for  private  sector \nparticipation. Seventeen independent power producers (IPPs) contribute 156 MW of generation. \nThe  NEA  has  signed  power  purchase  agreements  with  22  additional  IPPs  totaling  68  MW  of \ncapacity,  and  this  is  under  construction.  About  107  kilometers  (km)  of  transmission  lines  are \nprivately  owned.  One  large  privately  owned  distribution  company  supplies  electricity  to  23,000 \nconsumers, and there are many community-managed distribution schemes scattered across the \ncountry. \n \nB. \n\nPower Sector Policy \n\n3. \nHydropower Development Policy 2001. This policy sets out a list of specific objectives \nand  rules  to  govern  the  hydroelectric  sector.  It  provides  for  (i)  the  functions  pertaining  to  the \noperation  of  the  power  centers,  operation  of  electricity  transmission  and  national  grid,  and \nelectricity  distribution  owned  by  the  NEA;  (ii)  the  creation  of  an  independent  (power)  system \noperator;  and  (iii)  encouragement  of  local  body,  community,  and  private  sector  participation  in \nthe operation of the electricity distribution system. \n \n4. \nNational  Water  Resource  Strategy  2002.  The  key  policy  directives  pertaining  to  the \npower sector contained in this document are that (i) the NEA is to become commercially viable \nthrough  corporatization,  improved  management,  and  separation  of  its  rural  electrification \noperations; (ii) the NEA is to be unbundled by separately creating a transmission/load dispatch \ncenter;  (iii)  generation  will  be  the  responsibility  of  a  separate  corporation;  (iv)  distribution \noperations will be sold or contracted out to municipal or private operators; and (v) the NEA will \noperate as a holding company. \n \n5. \nInterim Plan (2008\u20132010). The long-term vision for the power sector is the utilization of \nwater resources to meet domestic power demand and the export of surplus power to increase \nthe  country\u2019s  foreign  earnings.  Some  of  the  key  strategies  to  be  adopted  are  (i)  introducing \neffective  regulation  of  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity  and  related \n\n                                                 \n1 Government of Nepal. 1992.

Kathmandu. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nbusinesses;  (ii)  adopting  a  one-stop-shop  approach  to  encourage  investments  in  hydropower \ndevelopment  to  allow  investors  to  obtain  all  approvals  from  a  single  agency;  (iii)  consistent \nefforts in the expansion of electricity generation potential; (iv) expanding transmission capacity, \ntargeting both local consumption and export potential; and (v) strengthening and expanding the \nelectricity distribution system. \n \nC. \n\nSector Issues  \n\nGeneration. Of the total hydropower capacity, storage-type hydropower represents only \n6. \n14%.  The  dominance  of  run-off-river  and  daily  storage  hydropower  plants  has  led  to  acute \ncapacity shortage during the dry season when the demand rises sharply. The wet season sees \na glut of energy available in the system which has yet to find a market. The Interim Plan (2008\u2013\n2010)  envisaged  hydropower  projects  with  a  total  capacity  of  105 MW  being  commissioned \nwithin the plan period to meet domestic electricity demand, with 85 MW of this coming from the \npublic sector and the balance coming from the private sector. This has largely been achieved. \nInitiation  of  2,085  MW  of  new  capacity  was  also  envisaged  within  the  plan  period.  However, \nconstraints on funding and process inefficiencies mean that this target will not be achieved. \n \n7. \nTransmission.  The  NEA  transmission  system  consists  of  1,563  km  of  132  kV  power \nlines, 350 km of 66 kV power lines, and 2,500 km of 33 kV power lines. A 132 kV transmission \nring around the Kathmandu valley is being completed by the NEA. The completion of this series \nof projects, due in 2009, will cater for demand growth in the Kathmandu valley and will reduce \nlosses and improve supply quality and reliability. Timely commissioning of transmission lines is \ncritical for evacuation of much-needed new hydropower generation. Several IPPs are unable to \nundertake  new  power  development  initiatives  because  of  the  difficulties  in  power  evacuation. \nThe  NEA  completed  its  most  recent  comprehensive  transmission  planning  study  in  July  2006. \nHowever, the study does not directly address increased transmission connectivity with India, an \nissue that has far-reaching implications for Nepal\u2019s power sector and the development of large-\nscale  export-focused  hydropower  plants  in  Nepal.  Construction  of  175  km  of  high-voltage \ntransmission  line  and  377  megavolt-amperes  (MVA)  of  transmission  substation  capacity  was \nprogrammed for the Interim Plan period. Construction of the first of three planned 400 kV India\u2013\nNepal transmission interconnections is to be completed within the Interim Plan period. \n \n8. \nDistribution.  The NEA presently serves 1.5 million customers across all 75 districts of \nthe  country.  It  sold  2,204  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of  electricity  in  FY2007,  an  increase  of  10% \nover the previous year. Domestic and industrial consumers represent almost 80% of sales. Only \n40% of the population has access to electricity services, with 33% having access to the grid and \nthe  NEA  off-grid  facilities,  with  the  remaining  7%  served  by  micro-hydro  plants  developed  by \nlocal  entrepreneurs  and  other  alternate  sources.  The  Interim  Plan  expresses  the  need  to \nconnect an additional 450,000 rural households to the national electricity grid and has identified \n651 km of 33 kV lines, 3,163 km of 11 kV lines, 5,978 km of low-voltage lines, and 113 MVA of \n33/11 kV substation capacity to be added during the plan period. \n \n9. \nBarriers  to  Private  Sector  Participation.  The  Government  has  already  taken  some \nsteps to attract private investment in the power sector. With the exception of some run-of-river \nhydropower plants funded by domestic investors, little investment has taken place. Reasons for \nthe  reluctance  of  the  private  sector  to  become  involved  in  the  sector  include  (i)  lack  of \ntransparency  and  accountability \nincompatibilities  and \ninconsistencies  in  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks,  (iii)  difficulties  in  raising  non-recourse \nfinance,  (iv)  discriminatory  tariff  setting  for  projects  greater  than  5  MW,  (v)  inadequate \ntransmission network capacity to evacuate power, and (vi) political risk. \n\nlicensing  process, \n\nthe \n\n(ii) \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable A2.1: ADB Energy Sector Results Framework \n\n

international \ndevelopment  partners.  The  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  and  the  World \nBank  have  been  the  major  source  of  external  funding  to  the  sector,  focusing  on  reforms  in \ngeneration,  facility  rehabilitation  and  improvement,  and  development  of  renewable  energy \nresources.  In  addition,  bilateral  donors  including  Danish  International  Development  Agency, \nDeutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ),  KfW,  Norwegian  Agency  for \nDevelopment Cooperation and United States Agency for International Development have been \nactive  in  the  power  sector.  Further,  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  Department \nfor International Development of the United Kingdom, Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nKuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic  Development,  Saudi  Fund  for  Development,  the  European \nUnion,  the  Finnish  Department  for  International  Development,  the  Government  of  France  and \nthe United Nations Development Programme have all provided assistance to the power sector. \n \n2. \nNepal  has  received  substantial  external  assistance  for  the  development  of  its  power \nsector.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  11  loans  totaling  $349.5  million \n(including  $35.1  million  for  a  private  hydropower  project)  and  19  technical  assistance  grants \ntotaling $8.8 million. \n \n\nTable A3: ADB\u2019s Assistance to the Power Sector in Nepal \n\n \n\nLoan \n\nA. \n\nPublic Sector Loans \n\nProject Name \n\n102  Gandak\u2013Hetauda Power \n249  Gandak\u2013Hetauda Power (Supplementary) \n250  Second Power \n447  Third Power \n512  Mini-Hydropower \n533  Fourth Power \n670  Fifth Power \n708  Sixth Power \n1011  Seventh Power \n1452  Kali Gandaki \u201cA\u201d Hydroelectric \n1732  Rural Electrification, Distribution, and Transmission \n\n  Subtotal (A) \n \n\n \nPrivate Sector Loans \nHimal Power Limited \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nB. \n\nC. \n\n1430/ \n1431 \n \n\nTA 399  Mini Hydropower  \nTA 417 \nTA 418 \nTA 420 \nTA 478 \nTA 837 \n\nFourth Power \nFourth Power Part B (Rural Electrification Study) \nPower Development Study \nFormulation of Fifth Power \nFormulation of Seventh Power \nInstitutional Support for Distribution Planning and Commercial \nOperations \n\nTA 1267 \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nYear of \nApproval \n\n \n\n \n\n   2.7 \n   2.5 \n   3.8 \n 18.6 \n   8.3 \n 19.4 \n 20.0 \n 28.1 \n 51.0 \n160.0 \n 50.0 \n364.4 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n     820,000  \n     740,000  \n     150,000  \n       45,000  \n       50,000  \n       75,000  \n\n1972 \n1975 \n1975 \n1979 \n1981 \n1981 \n1983 \n1984 \n1990 \n1996 \n1999 \n\n1981 \n1981 \n1981 \n1981 \n1982 \n1986 \n\n 35.1 \n\n1996 \n\n     780,000  \n\n1990 \n\n\fLoan \n\nProject Name \n\nTA 1394  Equitable and Efficient Energy Pricing Study \nTA 1737  Kali Gandaki \"A\" Hydroelectric Detailed Design \nInstitutional Strengthening in Rural \nTA 2342 \nEnergy Planning and Implementation \n \nTA 2613 \nInstitutional Strengthening of NEA's Environment Division \nTA 2614  Power System Master Plan \nTA 2911  Rural Electrification and Distribution Improvement \nTA 3193  Transmission Plan for Kathmandu Valley \nTA 4493  Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy \nTA 4985  West Seti Hydroelectric  \nTA 4997  Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Power Sector \nTA 7076  Preparing Transmission and Distribution Project \n\nTA 7176 \n\nPreparing Electricity Connectivity and Energy Efficiency \nProject \n\n  Subtotal (B) \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n     600,000  \n  2,000,000  \n \n     400,000 \n     534,000  \n     600,000  \n     450,000  \n     100,000  \n     600,000  \n     300,000  \n     600,000 \n     150,000 \n\nYear of \nApproval \n1990 \n1992 \n \n1995 \n1996 \n1996 \n1997 \n1999 \n2004 \n2007 \n2007 \n2008 \n\n     150,000 \n9,144,000 \n\n \n\n2008 \n\n ADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n3. \nThe  current  power  crisis  that  Nepal  faces  is  a  result  of  lack  of  investment  in  large, \nstorage-based hydropower plants to provide base-load generation during the dry winter months. \nInvestment  has  not  occurred  due  to  confused  and  conflicting  legislation  that  has  done  little  to \nencourage  private  participation  in  the  sector,  lack  of  domestic  financial  resources,  and \ninadequate  transmission  infrastructure  to  transmit  large  blocks  of  power  to  load  centers. \nConsequently, with a few exceptions, most generation development has been on a small scale \nin recent years, which has done little to relieve the power crisis. ADB\u2019s interventions in Nepal\u2019s \npower  sector  and  those  of  its  development  partners  have  mostly  focused  on  transmission, \ndistribution, and small hydropower. While these interventions have mostly produced useful and \nmeasurable  results,  they  have  not  directly  contributed  to  addressing  the  power  crisis.  The \nproposed Project is also largely transmission and distribution focused, but it directly addresses \nthe  power  crisis  by  improving  capacity  to  import  power  from  India,  increasing  transmission \ncapacity  for  evacuation  of  power  from  planned  large  storage-based  hydropower  stations, \ntargeting loss reduction in urban areas, dramatically increasing end-use energy efficiency, and \nincreasing the output of two existing hydropower stations. However, it must be recognized that \nthe Project itself will not solve the power crisis\u2014ongoing and targeted interventions from ADB \nand  its  development  partners  will  be  essential  if  the  gains  made  by  the  Project  are  to  be \nsustained and built upon. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30   Appendix 4 \n \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES a \nTable A4.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nNRs Million\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\n$ Million\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n% of \nBase Cost\n\nItem\n\n4.\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nA.\n\nInvestment Costs a\n1.

The NEA last made a profit from operations in FY1998 (NRs154 \nmillion).  In  FY2007,  the  NEA  made  an  accounting  profit  of  NRs262  million;  this  resulted  from \nforeign  exchange  rate  gains  on  Japanese  yen  loans.  Details  of  past  performance  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n2. \nThe NEA\u2019s underlying performance has been one of declining profitability, with no tariff \nincreases  since  FY2001,  but  rising  costs  of  energy  purchases  and  other  operating  costs.  The \nbudgeted loss for FY2009 was NRs2,700 million, the highest in the NEA\u2019s history. The NEA has \nonly been able to meet its cash operating expenses and maintain ongoing capital investment in \nrecent years by deferring interest and principal repayments, and delaying royalty payments. At \nthe end of FY2008, interest during construction and interest arrears totaled NRs18.8 billion, and \nunpaid  royalties1 totaled  NRs602  million.  Meanwhile  debtors  represented  4.8  months  of  sales \nwith  municipal  street  lighting  arrears  accounting  for  NRs2.0  billion2 and  representing  39%  of \naccounts receivable at the end of FY2008. In its FY2009 budget, the NEA projected NRs1,748 \nmillion of debt service out of the NRs4,671 million that was actually due for payment. \n \n3. \nExisting  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financial  covenants  are  (i)  rate  of  return  of \n6.0% per annum on revalued net fixed assets in service,3 (ii) self-financing ratio of 23% on an \naverage of 3 years capital expenditure, (iii) debt service ratio of 1.2 times debt service, and (iv) \naccounts receivable of less than 3 months. For FY2008 none of these covenants were met, with \nthe NEA being in partial or full noncompliance for most of the last 5 years. \n \n\nTable A7.1: Nepal Electricity Authority Key Financial Indicators  \n\nCovenant \nReturn on average NFA \nDebt-service ratio \nSelf financing ratio (3 year average) \nAccounts receivable (months) \n\n2001\n6.7% \n1.8 \n11.3% \n2.5 \n\n2004\n1.8% \n0.9 \n18.5% \n3.8 \n\n2005\n4.3% \n0.9 \n26.3% \n3.5 \n\n2006 \n\n2.8% \n0.8 \n18.7% \n3.7 \n\n2007 \n6.1% a \n1.1 \n47.4% \n4.3 \n\n2008\n1.3% \n1.0 \n12.4% \n4.8 \n\nNFA = net financial assets. \na  Includes revaluation on yen loans.

While  internal  controls  are  in  place,  they  are  not \n\n                                                 \n1  The  Nepal  Electricity  Act  (1989)  provided  for  1%  of  the  electricity  sales  as  royalty  to  be  paid  by  the  NEA  and \nindependent power producers (IPPs). In the case of IPPs the royalty is based on costs of generation. Those of the \nNEA are based on sales revenues from hydro generation. Later, the NEA argued for royalty payments to be also \nbased  on  its  generation  costs.  The  compromise  agreed  upon  was  that  the  NEA\u2019s  royalty  calculation  would  be \nbased on the average generation costs of IPPs times NEA\u2019s total generation from hydropower sources. \n\n2  Subsequent to balance date, the Ministry of Local Development has paid the NEA NRs1.0 billion and the NEA has \nwritten off NRs1.0 billion of street lighting arrears. The ministry has appointed a consultant to devise a long-term \npayment procedure for street lighting satisfactory to the NEA. \n\n3  It is proposed that this covenant be revised to read \u201crate of return of 6% on net fixed assets in service on a historic \n\nbasis\u201d so that it is consistent with World Bank covenants. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n41 \n\nadequate.  This  has  led  to  a  series  of  audit  queries  surrounding  cash,  stock,  and  fixed  assets \nover  the  years.  The  NEA  sets  up  task  forces  to  deal  with  these  matters,  which  were  never \nproperly  resolved  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  auditors.  The  NEA's  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement systems are being upgraded and computerized with support from the World Bank. \nThis  includes  computerization  and  integration  of  all  systems,  revised  manual  procedures,  and \nextensive  staff  training.  This  should  result  in  improved  and  timely  management  and  financial \nreporting and a marked reduction in auditing issues. As a consequence of these initiatives,4 the \nproposed project financial management arrangements are considered satisfactory. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Projections and Nepal Electricity Authority Financial Restructuring \n\n5. \nFinancial  projections  were  prepared  for  the  NEA  up  to  FY2020.  There  is  unlikely  to  be \nany  major  additions  to  generation  capacity  prior  to  FY2013,  with  power  purchases  needing  to \nincrease  to  bridge  the  gap  in  generation,  and  the  NEA  needing  to  find  funding  to  meet  both \ngeneration and transmission investments necessary to improve the present supply. Accordingly, \nthe discussion below concentrates on FY2010\u2013FY2015. In the absence of tariff increases, the \nNEA\u2019s cash shortfall after meeting forecast capital expenditure and all debt service obligations \nwould  be  NRs60.2  billion.  Tariff  increases  necessary  to  ensure  a  positive  cash  position  by \nFY2015  would  be  10.0%  per  annum,  with  the  average  tariff  increasing  from  NRs6.74  per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh) to NRs11.95/kWh. Accordingly, in the absence of any major tariff increases \nto improve the NEA\u2019s cash flow, other options such as financial restructuring of the NEA need to \nbe  examined  to  improve  the  NEA\u2019s  financial  position.  These  are  outlined  below.  While  capital \nexpenditure  could  be  deferred,  this  would  exacerbate  the  present  supply  situation.  However, \nprioritization of expenditure is essential. \n \nD. \n\nRestructuring Plan for the Nepal Electricity Authority \n\n6. \nBalance  Sheet  Items.  These  are  to  (i)  convert  grants  to  the  Government  that  are \ncurrently  onlent  to  the  NEA  as  loans  to  equity  (value  of  loans  was  NRs188  billion  at  15  July \n2008), (ii) convert Government loans to the NEA for Middle Marsyangdi hydropower station to \nequity  (value  of  loan  was  NRs5.0 billion  as  at  15  July  2008),  (iii) convert  ADB\u2019s  Eighth  Power \nProject5 loan  for  rural  electrification  to  equity  (value  of  loan  was  NRs3.5  billion  as  at  15  July \n2008), (iv) convert current interest arrears and interest during construction arrears to equity, and \n(v)  pass  ADB\u2019s  proposed  loan  to  the  Government  of  $65  million  for  the  Clean  Energy  Access \nImprovement Project and ADB\u2019s proposed grant of $4.5 million from the Climate Change Fund \nand Clean Energy Fund to the NEA as grant or equity. \n\n \n\n7. \nRevenue  and  Expense  Items.  These  are  (i)  to  reduce  onlending  rates  on  all  other \nGovernment loans to the NEA from 8% to 5%; (ii) to utilize a share of royalties paid by the NEA \nto the Government (about 40% of total royalties) to partly cover the NEA\u2019s operating losses on \nrural  electrification;  (iii)  for  the  Government  to  fund  unit  cost  escalation, on  FY2009 prices,  for \nthe NEA\u2019s electricity purchases from India and independent power producers;6 (iv) to capitalize \ninterest during construction rather than being paid out by the NEA; (v) for future street lighting \narrears  for  municipalities  and  village  development  committees  to  be  paid  by  the  Government \nonce  these  are  3  months  in  arrears;  (vi)  for  the  Government  to  finance  all  rural  electrification \ninvestments  as  equity  with  no  contribution  from  the  NEA;  (vii)  for  the  Government  to  directly \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB is also proposing technical assistance for 2010 that will include financial management as one of its areas of \nattention,  with  the  objective  of  strengthening  the  NEA's  financial  management  skills,  especially  in  the  area  of \nfinancial planning, so that the NEA will be better placed to assess its long-term funding and tariff requirements. \n5 ADB.1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Nepal for \n\nthe Rural Electrification, Transmission and Distribution Project. Manila. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n42  \n \n\ncompensate the NEA for the recently announced elimination of the demand charge and for any \nfuture adverse changes to the NEA\u2019s earnings; and (vii) to defer a proportion of remaining debt \nrepayments  as  required  for  FY2010\u2013FY2015  until  such  time  as  the  NEA  is  able  to  meet  its \nreduced debt service. \n\n8. \nConverting  onlent grants has a total cash flow benefit of NRs16.0 billion, and reducing \ninterest rates has a total cash flow benefit of NRs13.6 billion. Converting the Middle Marsyangdi \ngovernment loan and ADB\u2019s Eighth Power Project loan to equity adds a further NRs6.4 billion of \ntotal cash flow benefit during FY2010\u2013FY2015.  Using a share of royalties (40%) to cover rural \nelectrification operating losses results in a NRs3.7 billion total cash flow benefit to the NEA. A \nfurther  NRs8.7  billion  of  total  cash  flow  benefit  accrues  to  the  NEA  with  the  Government \nmeeting  the  unit  cost  escalation,  on  FY2009  prices,  for  the  NEA\u2019s  electricity  purchases  from \nIndia  and  independent  power  producers.  When  these  measures  are  combined  with  debt \nrestructuring, the total cash flow benefit to the NEA is NRs42.6 billion over FY2010\u2013FY2015. \n \n9. \nFinancial  projections  for  the  restructured  NEA,  following  the  above  Government \ninitiatives, require tariff increases of 8.0% per annum from FY2012 to FY2015 (i.e., 4 years of \n8%  annual  tariff  increases)  to  achieve  a  cash-neutral  position  for  the  NEA  by  FY2015.  Such \nincreases  would  be  acceptable  to  the  public  once  the  NEA\u2019s  electricity  supply  and  service \nimproves.  This  tariff  increase  would  allow  ADB  and  World  Bank  loan  covenants  of  a  debt \nservice ratio of 1.2 times debt service and the rate of return on historic net fixed assets of 6.0% \nto be achieved by FY2013 (Table A7.2). \n \n10. \nTo  allow  the  NEA  to  meet  essential  capital  expenditure  requirements,  the  Government \nwill need to provide additional debt repayment relief by deferral of principal repayment on debt. \nThis will be required until tariff increases take effect and purchases from India decline from 23% \nof  the  electricity  sales  mix  in  FY2013  to  approximately  1%  of  the  mix  in  FY2015.  A  total  of \nNRs13.6 billion of debt repayment deferral will be necessary through to FY2013. \n \n\nTable A7.2: NEA Financial Projections after Restructuring Options and Tariff Increases \n\nFY (15 July) \n\n2009  2010 \n\n2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2020 \n\nSummary Ratios and Tariffs \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReturn on Average NFAs (%) \n\nDebt-service Ratio (DSR, times) \n\nSelf Financing Ratio (%),3-year average \n\nDebt (LT)/Debt+Equity Ratio (%) \n\nAverage Tariff (NRs/kWh) \n\n% Change per annum \n\nIPP Purchases (NRs/kWh) \n\nIndian Purchases (NRs/kWh) \n\n-0.7 \n\n0.5 \n\n10 \n\n53 \n\n6.74 \n\n0.0 \n\n5.77 \n\n5.52 \n\n4.7 \n\n1.2 \n\n21 \n\n38 \n\n6.74 \n\n0.00 \n\n5.94 \n\n5.83 \n\n2.9 \n\n1.1 \n\n-2 \n\n44 \n\n6.74 \n\n0.00 \n\n6.12 \n\n6.15 \n\n5.6 \n\n1.4 \n\n4 \n\n48 \n\n7.28 \n\n8.00 \n\n6.30 \n\n6.49 \n\n9.2 \n\n1.5 \n\n11 \n\n49 \n\n7.87 \n\n8.00 \n\n6.49 \n\n6.84 \n\n9.4 \n\n1.7 \n\n38 \n\n48 \n\n8.50  \n\n8.00 \n\n6.69  \n\n7.22  \n\n9.3 \n\n1.8 \n\n127 \n\n46 \n\n9.18 \n\n8.00 \n\n6.89 \n\n7.62 \n\n6.0 \n\n1.5 \n\n392 \n\n32 \n\n9.18 \n\n0 \n\n7.98 \n\n9.96 \n\nAverage Costs (NRs/kWh) \n\n8.33 \nDSR = debt service ratio, IPP = independent power producer, kWh = kilowatt-hour, LT = long tern, NFA = net financial assets, RoR \n= rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n7.04  \n\n7.40 \n\n7.37 \n\n7.87 \n\n6.93 \n\n7.17 \n\n7.16 \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \n6  Forecast electricity generation and sales are based on: NEA. 2008.

All \nfinancial costs  and  benefits  have  been  expressed  in  constant  2009  price  levels.  Cost  streams \nused for the purposes of financial internal rate of return (FIRR) determination reflect the costs of \ndelivering the estimated benefits. Financial analysis was undertaken for the major components \n(1, 2, and 4) of the Project.  \n  \n2. \nThe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  the  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  (NEA) \nwas calculated for the proposed subprojects and compared with the project FIRRs to ascertain \nthe financial viability of the subprojects. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse movements in the \nunderlying assumptions was also assessed. \n \nFinancial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of the \n3. \nwith-investment  and  without-investment  scenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  through  the \nincreased electricity sales and avoidance of incremental generating costs at peak and off-peak \ntimes over  both the summer and  winter supply periods. Average incremental generation costs \nwere  determined  based  on  the  NEA\u2019s  generation  expansion  plan,  and  average  incremental \ntransmission  costs  were  added  to  derive  total  costs  of  supply  to  transmission  subprojects.  To \nthis, estimated distribution average incremental costs were added to give total costs of supply to \ndistribution subprojects. \n \n4. \n33% of the original investment at the end of the 20-year evaluation period. \n \nThe  current  average  the  NEA  retail  tariff  of  NRs6.74  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  was \n5. \nadopted  for  evaluation  purposes  because  sales,  although  predominantly  in  the  Kathmandu \nvalley,  would  also  benefit  other  parts  of  the  country  as  a  result  of  improved  reliability  and \nincreased  transmission  capacity.  In  the  case  of  grid  interconnections  with  India,  the  current \npurchase price of energy is valued at NRs5.24/kWh. \n \nB. \n \nTo  compute  the  WACC,  it  is  assumed  that  the  financing  sources  would  consist  of  the \n6. \nNEA  and  Government  equity  contributions  and  foreign  sources  by  way  of  the  proposed  Asian \nDevelopment Fund grant. On this basis, project funding might be described as being \u201call equity.\u201d \nHowever, this does not reflect the cost of capital faced by the NEA for the bulk of its projects, \nand  also  its  current  poor  financial  status.  The  NEA  is  borrowing  funds  on  the  domestic  bond \nmarket  at  around  10.5%,  essentially  to  provide  equity  contributions  to  the  Project  and  other \nprojects.  The  NEA\u2019s  standard  project  funding  structure  is  80%  foreign  loan\u2014currently  at  an \ninterest  rate  of  8%\u2014and  equity  contributions  with  75%  from  the  NEA  and  25%  from  the \nGovernment.  \n \n7. \nThe  NEA\u2019s  equity  was  therefore  valued  by  adding  issuing  costs  (1.5%)  and  a  risk \npremium (3.0%) to the domestic bond rate (10.5%), giving an estimated cost of equity of 15.0%. \nThe analysis assumes that, for standard project financing, any concessional loans or grants are \n\nCalculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

As shown in Table A8.1, the average WACC is calculated as 1.3%. \n \n\nTable A8.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n\n Item \nWeighting \nNominal Cost \nTax Rate \nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost \nInflation Rate \nReal Cost  \nWACC \n\nWACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nADB Loan \n80.0% \n8.0% \n0.0% \n8.0% \n8.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n\nEquity \n20.0% \n15.0% \n 0.0% \n       15.0% \n 8.0% \n 6.5% \n1.3% \n\nTotal \n100.0% \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n 1.3% \n\n \nC. \n\n \n8. \n \n\nCalculation of Financial Internal Rate of Return, Risk Assessment, and Sensitivity \nAnalyses \n\nFIRRs for component 1 (transmission) subprojects are shown in Table A8.2.2 \n\nTable A8.2: Summary of Subproject Financial Internal Rates of Return for Transmission \nComponent \n\nTransmission Subprojects \nT1.

This subproject is primarily \ndriven by the need to improve security of supply for evacuation of electricity from Marshyangdi \nhydropower  station,  and  a  secondary  benefit  arises  from  improvement  to  security  of  supply \nthrough  an  important  transmission  corridor.  Since  Marshyangdi  hydropower  station  represents \naround  10%  of  the  NEA\u2019s  installed  capacity,  a  tripping  of  the  single  circuit  that  currently \nevacuates  electricity  from  this  station  could  cause  severe  instability  in  the  system,  and  may \nresult in a cascade outage over the entire network. The cost of this low-probability event would \nbe  extreme.  Therefore,  this  subproject  needs  be  considered  as  an  integral  part  of  the \ntransmission investment program even though its FIRR is below the hurdle rate. \n \n\n                                                 \n2 Subproject T3 as considered in this financial analysis involves stringing a second 132 kV transmission circuit from \nButwal to Mahendranagar. However, the proposed loan  will only fund the line from Butwal to Kohalpur (the line\u2019s \nmidpoint), with an expectation that the balance of the second circuit stringing will be funded from a follow-up ADB \nloan  or  from  NEA\u2019s  own  resources.  Analysis  of  the  entire  line  has  been  undertaken  to  overcome  the  difficulties \ninherent in attempting to ascribe benefits to an upgrade to only part of a transmission line \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n45 \n\nThe FIRR for component 2 (distribution) is estimated at 8.0%, and for component 4 (loss \n10. \nreduction)  it  is  estimated  at  5.9%.  The  aggregate  FIRR  is  11.0%.  These  FIRRs  compare \nfavorably with the estimated value of WACC at 1.3%. Therefore, the analysis substantiates the \nfinancial viability of the subprojects and the overall project. \n \nD. \n\nRisk Assessment and Sensitivity Analyses  \n\n11. \nExternal  Risks.  Regulatory  or  tariff  revision  risk  for  the  subprojects  is  minimal  as  no \ntariff  increases  have  been  assumed  in  the  financial  analysis.  The  current  tariff  has  not  been \nincreased since May 2001 and the Government has assured that any declines in nominal tariff \nwill be directly compensated.  \n \nElectricity  demand  risk  is  minimal  since  the  country  is  already  experiencing  daily  load \n12. \nshedding of 16\u201318 hours during winter months. Geopolitical and political risks are present for all \nprojects in Nepal. However, the nature of the investments and the overall shortage of power in \nNepal serve to diversify this risk. Therefore, the overall risk to the financial sustainability of the \nNEA  is  deemed  to  be  minimal,  with  the  Project  seen  as  a  necessary  step  in  improving  the \nsupply  situation,  especially  through  improved  interconnection  with  India,  thus  improving  the \nNEA\u2019s financial situation. \n \nProject-Specific Risks. Financial risks at subproject level include (i) increase in price of \n13. \ncivil works and equipment, (ii) delays in project implementation, and (iii) failure to have access \nto  necessary  counterpart  funds.  These  risks  are  considered  to  be  low  because  (i)  the  cost \nestimates  were  based  on  recent  tenders  received,  and  advanced  procurement  will  lessen  the \ntime  between  loan  effectiveness  and  disbursement;  (ii)  the  NEA\u2019s  implementation  capacity  is \nlow  but  adequate,  and  consulting  support  will  be  provided  for  implementation  of  the  loss \nreduction  component;  and  (iii)  the  projections  prepared  for  the  NEA  demonstrate  that,  with \nrestructuring and Government support, cash flows will improve by 2015 and that thereafter the \nNEA will be able to meet the repayment of debt associated with the investments.  \n \n14. \nSensitivity  Analysis.  Separate  analyses  were  carried  out  to  examine  the  sensitivity  of \nprojected financial returns to adverse changes in key variables. The variables considered for the \nsensitivity analyses were (i) a 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) a 10% increase in operating and \nmaintenance  costs,  (iii)  a  10%  decrease  in  revenues,  and  (iv)  a  2-year  implementation  delay \nwith  a  20%  increase  in  costs  and  no  allowance  for  residual  values.  Table  A8.3  demonstrates \nthat the results are robust for each component and for the overall Project, with the sensitivities \nexceeding the WACC. Components are most sensitive to cost overruns and delays.  \n \n\nTable A8.3: Financial Internal Rate of Return Sensitivity Analyses \n\nTransmission  Distribution Loss Reduction  Aggregate \n\nComponent \n\n \n\n \nSensitivity Parameter \nBase Case \nCapital \nOperating \nBenefits \nAll the above \n \nTwo-year delay and 20% capital \ncost increase \nNo Residual Value \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n\n+10% \n+10% \n-10% \n\n12.2% \n11.2% \n12.1% \n11.0% \n  9.9% \n\n 9.1% \n      12.0% \n1.3% \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n8.0% \n7.3% \n7.9% \n7.1% \n6.2% \n\n6.0% \n7.6% \n1.3% \n\n \n\n11.0% \n10.0% \n10.8% \n 9.8% \n 8.8% \n 8.2% \n\n       10.7% \n1.3% \n\n5.9% \n5.1% \n5.7% \n4.8% \n3.8% \n\n3.9% \n5.0% \n1.3% \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n46  \n \n\n \nA. \n\nBackground and Approach \n\n1. \ncomponents.

The  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of \nsubprojects  were  estimated  by  comparing  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios. \nTransmission  subprojects  were  analyzed  separately;  distribution  subprojects  were  aggregated \nfor  the  purposes  of  analysis,  as  were  loss  reduction  subprojects.  The  generation  component \nfocuses  on  minor  plant  modernization  for  which  benefits  are  difficult  to  quantify,  and  has \ntherefore been excluded from the analysis. \n \nB. \n\nCalculation of Economic Internal Rate of Return, Risk Assessment, and Sensitivity \nAnalysis \n\nDemand  Forecast.  The  demand  forecasting  methodology  and  model  of  the  Nepal \n3. \nElectricity  Authority  (NEA)  were  originally  prepared  during  the  1998  Power  System  Master \nPlan 1 .  The  NEA  has  updated  key  model  assumptions  periodically  since  1998.  The  model \nestimates demand for electrical energy and peak power on the integrated Nepal power system. \nIt uses a standard econometric approach, linking the demand for electrical energy to economic \nand  income  growth  (measured  by  growth  in  gross  domestic  product)  and  electricity  prices \n(measured  by  real  changes  in  electricity  tariffs).  The  NEA  translates  this  aggregate  demand \nforecast  to  a  regional  and  substation  demand  forecast  by  pro-rating  on  the  basis  of  previous \nyears\u2019  demand.  The  NEA  models  five  customer  groups:  domestic,  industrial,  irrigation, \ncommercial,  and  others  (government,  religious,  and  temporary).  Overall,  the  NEA  forecasts \nelectricity demand to grow by 9.9% per annum in 2009\u20132017. Peak demand is forecast by the \nNEA to grow by 9.7% over the same period, with a decline in losses from 23% to 18.5%. \n \n4. \nLeast-Cost  Planning.  For  all  subprojects,  the  NEA\u2019s  planners  have  identified  and \nanalyzed alternatives where they exist, and have confirmed that the proposed subprojects are \nleast-cost.  The  NEA  conducts  informal  least-cost  analysis  for  its  distribution  subprojects.  This \nmeans that  that desired outcomes are identified, and the NEA\u2019s senior engineers discuss and \nidentify  the  best  approach  to  achieving  the  desired  outcomes.  While  not  ideal,  this  approach \ndoes  implicitly  include  consideration  of  technical  practicalities  and  expected  costs,  and  given \nthat the distribution network is almost entirely radial with no interconnection, there are typically \nfew if any alternatives open to the NEA. The NEA\u2019s standard distribution substation and circuit \ndesigns  are  considered  reasonable  from  a  cost  perspective,  striking  a  good  balance  between \nsimplicity, reliability, and flexibility for future upgrading. For all distribution subprojects, the NEA \nhas confirmed that it has considered a reasonable range of alternatives and that the proposed \nsubprojects represent the least-cost means of achieving the desired outcomes.  \n\n                                                 \n1 Nepal Electricity Authority. 1998.

All  costs  and  benefits  have  been  expressed  at  a  constant  2008  price \nlevel;  the  world  price  numeraire  was  used.  Traded  inputs  were  valued  at  their  border  price \nequivalent  values.  Nontraded  inputs  were  valued  at  domestic  prices  and  then  adjusted  to  the \nworld price numeraire by  multiplying by the estimated standard conversion factor of 0.94. The \nstandard  conversion  factor  was  calculated  using  a  simple  trade-weighted  approach.  Capital \ncosts  included  physical  contingencies  but  excluded  taxes,  price  contingencies,  and  financial \ncharges  during  construction.  Based  on  international  experience,  the  operating  costs  for  the \ntransmission  subprojects  were  estimated  at  1.5%  of  capital  costs,  and  2%  for  the  distribution \nsubprojects. It was assumed that there are no significant distortions in the wage rates for skilled \nlabor.  In  the  case  of  unskilled  labor,  underemployment  exists  in  the  economy,  and  a  shadow \nwage  rate  of  0.75  was  adopted.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  projections  of  crude  oil  prices,  which  were \nextended  to  2030  by  assuming  flat  real  prices  beyond  2020,  were  used  for  establishing  the \ninternational  parity  values  of  petroleum  fuels  that  would  be  consumed  if  electricity  was  not \navailable  due  to  electricity  supply  constraints.  These  prices  were  also  used  for  estimating  the \ncost  of  thermal  electricity  generation.  Average  incremental  generation  costs  were  determined \nbased on the NEA\u2019s generation expansion plan. Average incremental transmission costs were \nadded to derive total costs of supply to transmission subprojects. To this, estimated distribution \naverage incremental costs were added to give total costs of supply to distribution subprojects. \n \nProject  Benefits.  Current  capacity  constraints  in  both  transmission  and  distribution \n6. \nnetworks  mean  that  frequent  supply  interruption  is  required  to  ensure  that  networks  are  not \noverloaded.  The  proposed  subprojects  are  primarily  concerned  with  removing  these  network \nconstraints,  improving  reliability  of  supply,  and  reducing  losses.  This  will  be  achieved  through \nadditional  line  and  substation  capacity,  network  reconfiguration,  and  the  addition  of  capacitor \nbanks  to  reduce  reactive  power  flows.  Analysis  of  the  current  and  forecast  electricity  demand \nand  supply  balance  in  Nepal  reveals  that  during  winter  there  is  always  a  generation  shortage \nthrough to 2013. This means that during winter through to 2013 any reduction in losses will lead \nto  reduction  in  unserved  demand  and  displace  other  forms  of  alternative  power  supplies, \nincluding  captive  generation.  During  other  periods  any  reduction  in  losses  will  result  in  only  a \nresource cost savings as generation is reduced. Further, any increases in network capacity to \nrelieve  constraints  will  only  have  value  during  generation  surplus  periods  since  demand \ndownstream of constraints can only be supplied if there is a generation surplus. \n \n7. \nNonincremental  outputs  from  transmission  and  distribution  components  of  the  Project \nwere  valued  at  the  resource  cost  savings  that would  accrue  if  the  Project  were  to proceed.  In \nvaluing  the  output  of  subprojects,  it  was  assumed  that  most  captive  generation  and  kerosene \nlighting  would  be  displaced  before  incremental  consumption  occurs.  Benefits  were  allocated \nacross consumer groups on the basis of estimated use of alternative energy sources for each \ngroup. \n \n8. \nIncremental outputs were valued using the estimates of willingness of Nepali consumers \nto  pay  for  additional  electricity,  adjusted  to  the  appropriate  voltage  level  of  each  subproject. \nDemand functions relating energy price to energy demand were estimated for each of the four \nmain  consumer  types  (domestic,  commercial,  industrial,  and  agricultural).  The  form  of  the \ndemand  function  follows  ADB\u2019s  Economics  and  Research  Department  Technical  Note  No.  3 \nMeasuring  Willingness  to  Pay  for  Electricity.2 Demand  functions  were  derived  using  two  data \npoints  for  each  consumer  type:  (i)  the  long  term  average  economic  cost  and  quantity  of \nalternative  energy  sources;  and  (ii)  the  NEA\u2019s  marginal  tariffs  for  consumers  consuming  the \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2002.

Regression  analysis  was  then  used  to  derive  the  four  demand  functions. \nThe derived demand functions were then applied and solved, on a year-by-year basis, to value \nthe incremental consumption enabled by each subproject and for each consumer type. Benefits \nwere allocated across consumer groups on the basis of the current consumer mix.  \n \n9. \nSome  of  the  transmission  subprojects  aim  to  reduce  the  high  number  of  unscheduled, \nshort-duration  power  outages  that  are  currently  experienced.  These  outages  carry  a  high \neconomic  cost  in  terms  of  lost  production  and  output.  For  the  purposes  of  analysis,  Nepal\u2019s \ndomestic product per unit of electricity sold, adjusted downwards to account for the fact that a \nfew  large  industries  and  commercial  consumers  self-generate,  was  taken  as  a  proxy  for  the \nvalue of energy not served due to unscheduled short-duration outages. \n \n10. \nBenefit quantities and unit values for the first few years after Project commissioning are \nsummarized  in  Table  A9.1.  The  ongoing  and  extreme  generation  shortages  that  Nepal  is \nexperiencing are apparent in this table. Generation shortages mean that benefits cannot be fully \nrealized  and  actually  decline  for  the  first  few  years  as  generation  shortages  worsen.  The  high \neconomic cost of these shortages is apparent in the initially increasing average unit benefit of \nProject output through to 2014, especially when compared to the current average tariff of $0.07 \nper kilowatt-hour (kWh). \n \n\nTable A9.1: Economic Benefits \n\nEconomic Benefits \n \n \nQuantity \n \n\nIncremental output \n\nNon-Incremental output \n\nReduced energy not served \n \n\n \nUnit Value \n  Average willingness to pay \n \n\nAverage resource cost saving \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAverage value of energy not served \n\nAggregate average unit benefit \n  \n\n  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n  \n\n   Units \n \n \n \n \n\n  GWh \n\n  GWh \n\n  GWh \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n$/kWh \n\n$/kWh \n\n$/kWh \n\n$/kWh \n  \n\n2012 \n \n \n\n38.4 \n\n13.4 \n\n2.0 \n\n \n \n\n0.09 \n\n0.41 \n\n2.85 \n\n0.27 \n  \n\n2013 \n\n2014 \n\n2015 \n\n2016 \n\n2017 \n\n2018 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n\n23.7 \n\n10.0 \n\n2.0 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.41 \n\n2.85 \n\n0.34 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n\n13.7 \n\n19.6 \n\n5.3 \n\n2.1 \n\n5.4 \n\n2.1 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.41 \n\n2.85 \n\n0.56 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.41 \n\n2.85 \n\n0.44 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n\n24.8 \n\n10.7 \n\n2.1 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.41 \n\n2.85 \n\n0.38 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n\n46.1 \n\n19.2 \n\n2.1 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.41 \n\n2.85 \n\n0.28 \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n  \n \n\n64.8 \n\n26.5 \n\n2.2 \n\n0.09 \n\n0.41 \n\n2.85 \n\n0.25 \n\n \n \n11. \nEstimated  Economic  Internal  Rate  of  Return.  A  period  of  25  years  was  used  for \neconomic evaluation. The detailed cost\u2013benefit calculations show investments are expected to \ndeliver significant economic benefits, as summarized in Table A9.2.3 The aggregated estimated \nEIRR  is  19.1%  (Table  A9.2).  Only  the  Marshyangdi  transmission  line  and  substation  upgrade \nsubproject has an EIRR below the hurdle rate of 12%. This subproject is primarily driven by the \nneed  to  improve  security  of  supply  for  evacuation  of  electricity  from  Marshyangdi  hydropower \nstation.  Marshyangdi  hydropower  station  represents  around  10%  of  the  NEA\u2019s  installed \n                                                 \n3  Subproject T3 as considered in this economic analysis involves stringing a second 132 kilovolt (kV) transmission \ncircuit from Butwal to Mahendranagar. However, the proposed loan will only fund the line from Butwal to Kohalpur \n(the  line\u2019s  midpoint),  with  an  expectation  that  the  balance  of  the  second  circuit  stringing  will  be  funded  from  a \nfollow-up ADB loan or from the NEA\u2019s own resources. Analysis of the entire line has been undertaken to overcome \nthe difficulties inherent in attempting to ascribe benefits to an upgrade to only part of a transmission line. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n49 \n\ngenerating capacity, and a tripping of the single circuit that currently evacuates electricity from \nthis  station  could  cause  severe  instability  in  the  system.  The  cost  of  this  low-probability  event \nwould be high. Therefore, it is recommended that this subproject be considered as an integral \npart of the transmission expansion  program and that it be included in the investment program \neven though its EIRR is below the hurdle rate. \n \n\nTable A9.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return Results \n\n  \n \n\nSubproject \nTransmission Component \n  T1.

The risks that the subprojects do not achieve such high \nlevels of economic returns were identified from both cost and benefit side. For each of the risks \nidentified,  the  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  was  tested  and  switching  values  were  calculated.4 On \naggregate,  the  EIRR  exceeds  12%  in  all  cases.  EIRR  sensitivity  results  are  shown  in  Table \nA9.4. Based on these results, the Project appears to be economically viable. \n \n\nTable A9.4: Sensitivity Analysis for Combined Transmission and Distribution \nComponents \n\n  \n\nSensitivity Parameter \n  \n  Base case \n1  Project capital costs \n2  Benefits \n3  Cost of supply \n4  Operation and maintenance \n5  Commissioning Delayed \n6  Combined (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n \n\n  Variation\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n+  10% \n- 10% \n+  20% \n+  20% \n1 year \n  \n\n \n\nEIRR \n  \n19.1% \n17.7% \n17.3% \n18.9% \n18.9% \n16.5% \n13.4% \n\nSwitching\nValue \n \n48.7% \n-38.3% \n532.9% \n752.2% \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nDistribution  Analysis.  The  distribution  of  costs  and  benefits  among  stakeholders  was \n13. \nassessed by comparing financial costs and benefits to economic costs and benefits. Overall, the \neconomic  net  present  value  exceeds  the  financial  net  present  value  by  $75.8  million. \nConsumers  are  the  greatest  beneficiaries,  with  net  benefits  of  about  $42.2  million.  Unskilled \nlabor  benefits  by  approximately  $0.7  million,  and  Nepal\u2019s  economy  benefits  by  approximately \n$32.8  million.  The  NEA  is  a  net  loser  in  this  analysis  ($34.8  million),  as  its  weighted  average \ncost of capital and therefore its expected financial internal rate of internal on the investment is \nwell below the 12% discount rate used in the analysis. \n  \n14. \nSustainability.  The  proposed  investments  represent  the  most  urgent  subprojects. \nTaken  together  they  will  make  a  discernable  difference  to  the  quality  of  electricity  supply \nreceived  by  many  consumers.  With  appropriate  institutional  support  to  the  NEA  and  the \nGovernment, economic benefit flow is expected to be financially and institutionally sustainable. \nIn the medium term, the sector will be supported by a more transparent tariff-setting regime that \nwill, over time, permit full recovery of efficient costs. This tariff regime will ensure that the NEA \ncan  implement  its  proposed  investment  program  in  the  knowledge  that  new  capital  and \noperating costs are recoverable and that it will earn an acceptable return on capital. Investment \nfunds will come from different sources including government equity, bilateral partners, the World \nBank,  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  Internal  generation  of  funds  is  not  forecast  to  be  a \nviable financing source for the NEA until 2015 at the earliest, as a consequence of the current \ngap between cost of supply and tariffs. \n \nC. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe  economic  analysis  confirms  that  the  proposed  investment  is  least-cost  and \n15. \neconomically viable. The analysis yields an overall EIRR of 19.1%. Sensitivity and risk analysis \ndemonstrates  that  the  expected  economic  performance  is  robust.  From  an  economic \nperspective the proposed investment should proceed. \n\n                                                 \n4  A  switching  value  measures  the  percentage  change  in  the  variable  required  to  reduce  the  EIRR  to  the  assumed \n\nhurdle rate. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n51 \n\n \n\n \n\nDESCRIPTION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN LIGHTING COMPONENT \n \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Rationale \n\nNepal is presently experiencing critical power shortages. Both supply- and demand-side \n1. \noptions  can  be  used  to  reduce  the  gap  between  the  demand  for  and  the  supply  of  electricity. \nSupply-side  management  measures  tend  to  have  medium-  to  long-term  gestation  periods, \nwhereas  demand-side  management  (DSM)  options  can  be  implemented  in  a  short  period  of \ntime, are often low cost, and are characterized by high benefit\u2013cost ratios. Among various DSM \nalternatives  that  can  be  implemented  quickly,  a  compact  fluorescent  lamp  (CFL)  distribution \nprogram has been identified as a viable option. \n \nThe  proposed  CFL  program  provides  for  the  distribution  of  1  million  energy-efficient \n2. \nCFLs  to  residential  consumers  drawing  electricity  from  Nepal\u2019s  electricity  grid.  CFLs  will  be \ndistributed  free  of  charge  to  lifeline  households 1  and  on  a  buy-one-get-one-free  basis  to \nnonlifeline  households.  CFL  models  of  9\u201311  watts  (W)  will  replace  40  W  incandescent  bulbs, \n12\u201315  W  CFLs  will  replace  60  W incandescent  bulbs, and  20\u201323  W CFLs  will  replace  100 W \nincandescent bulbs. \n \nThe  Government  has  approved  the  National  Electricity  Crises  Mitigation  Plan  20652 to \n3. \nmanage the present acute energy supply shortages. Under the plan, the government intends to \nmobilize its resources to mitigate the adverse impacts of the power sector supply deficits. The \nplan  identifies  the  CFL  buy-one-get-one-free  scheme  as  a  pilot  program  for  immediate \nimplementation. It is estimated that there are more than 3.6 million incandescent bulbs currently \nsold every year in the market. Although the use of CFLs has significantly increased in the last \nfew years, the proliferation of low-quality CFLs has distorted consumer perceptions of CFLs as \nreliable  substitutes  for  incandescent  bulbs.  It  is  expected  that  the  distribution  of  high-quality \nCFLs to residential customers will influence the consumption habit toward the adoption of CFLs \nin light points previously fitted with incandescent bulbs.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the proposed CFL program will be more efficient electricity end-use. The \n\n4. \noutcomes of this CFL program component include \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\npeak demand reduction of about 10 megawatts (MW),  \ndeferred investments in new generating capacities amounting to $18 million, \nenergy savings of about 23 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per annum, \nincreased sales and reduced price of good quality CFLs, and \nproportionally decreased sales of incandescent bulbs and low-quality CFLs. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  outputs  of  the  proposed  CFL  program  will  be  the  replacement  of  approximately  1 \n\n5. \nmillion incandescent bulbs with CFLs for residential consumers. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 Typically households with a 5 ampere electricity connection and/or consuming less than 20 units per month. \n2 Government of Nepal. 2009.

To  implement  the  program,  the  proposed  DSM  unit  will  be \nestablished and staffed with qualified personnel. The DSM unit will be responsible for technical, \nprocurement,  due  diligence,  evaluation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  aspects  of  implementation. \nThe NEA will work with CFL suppliers and distribution channels as program partners. \n\nInternational voluntary product specifications and energy performance standards will be \n8. \nused  for  the  CFLs  purchased.  In  no  case  will  the  adopted  CFL  standards  fall  below  those \nrequired under the efficient lighting initiative (ELI) technical specifications. Bayonet-capped self-\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\nballasted CFLs will typically be used. Power ratings and distribution quantities will be finalized \nafter  the  baseline  survey  of  domestic  consumers  across  different  meter-type  classifications, \nmonthly  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  consumption  brackets,  and  geographical  areas  has  been \nconducted. \n \n9. \nCFL  suppliers  will  be  accredited  by  the  NEA  to  establish  a  network  of  transaction  and \nredemption  points  within  existing  CFL  distribution  and  sales  networks  in  Nepal.  The  sale  or \nhandover  of  each  CFL  will  remain  between  the  CFL  supplier  and  the  participating  domestic \nconsumer.  A  $1.5  million  portion  of  the  proposed  grant  assistance  will  be  used  to  reduce  the \neffective selling price in each transaction. Both the NEA and ADB will pursue discussions on the \npossibility of collecting incandescent bulbs from participating domestic consumers as a measure \nto help ensure the attainability of the virtual power plant capacity target, as well as other detailed \nmechanics of the CFL transaction. The NEA will secure ADB clearance prior to the adoption of \nthe final distribution plan and the accreditation of CFL suppliers. \n \n10. \nAs soon as the target consumers have received all 1 million CFLs, the NEA will perform \na random verification survey involving households with a sampling methodology similar to that \nof the baseline survey. ADB will be provided with a copy of this verification survey report. Both \nthe  NEA  and  ADB  shall  then  jointly  evaluate  the  impact  of  the  program  and  discuss  the \nfeasibility of further expanding the program through a subsequent CFL program phase to cover \nremaining  incandescent  bulb  light  points  and  low-quality  CFLs  among  domestic  consumers,  if \nany. \n \n11. \nprocurement and distribution, and monitoring. \n \nF. \n\nThe  duration  of  this  project  will  be  24  months  including  activities  such  as  design, \n\nBenefits  \n\nThe CFL program will result in reduced peak demand on the national electricity grid of \n12. \napproximately  10  MW,  and  23  GWh  of  annual  energy  savings.  Given  the  peak  demand  and \nenergy constraints frequently experienced in Nepal, these savings have high economic value to \nthe nation and high financial value to the NEA.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n54  \n \n\nDESCRIPTION OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR STREET LIGHTING COMPONENT  \n \n \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\n1. \nThis component under the proposed Energy Access and Efficiency Improvement Project \nwill assist the Government of Nepal to promote solar powered streetlights and wind-solar hybrid \nstreetlights in urban areas of Nepal. This will include purchase of solar-powered street lighting \nand hybrid systems, replacements, and setting up a system to ensure proper maintenance and \nsystem reliability. Under this pilot project, around 1,000 streetlights will be installed in selected \nareas in Kathmandu valley municipalities, focusing mainly on heritage areas, major temples or \nother religious areas, tourist hotspots, major shopping streets, and some other main road areas. \n  \n\n2. \nPresently,  Nepal  faces  significant  electricity  supply  constraints  and  consumers  have  to \nundergo long periods of power interruptions, especially during evening peak hours. By replacing \n1,000 streetlights with solar-powered streetlights, around 0.2 megawatts (MW) of peak load on \nthe  grid  and  750  megawatt-hours  (MWh)  of  annual  energy  can  immediately  be  saved.  The \nGovernment  and  the  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  (NEA)  have  therefore  identified  solar-powered \nstreet lighting as a priority activity. \n \nMunicipal  streetlights  are  owned  and  managed  by  municipalities,  although  the  NEA  is \n3. \ncarrying out maintenance on them in a few areas. Nonpayment or delay in payment of electricity \narrears owed by the municipalities to the NEA for street lighting has been a contentious issue \nthat has aggravated the financial situation of the NEA. Use of solar-powered streetlights would \nprovide  some  relief  to  the  NEA  through  (i)  avoided  diesel-fired  generation  at  a  unit  cost  of \napproximately  NRs30  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  for  around  40%  of  the  year,1 and  (ii)  avoided \npurchases from India for the rest of the year at around NRs5.24/kWh. The benefit to the NEA \nwould be around NRs12 million per year.  \n \n4. \nExisting streetlight installations are mostly sodium vapor lamps, halogen lamps, mercury \nvapor lamps, and incandescent bulbs of 70 watts (W), 150 W, 250 W, and 400 W. The larger \nsizes  tend  to  be  used  in  main  streets;  the  smaller  sizes  are  used  in  less  important  streets, \ntemples,  and  government  offices.  It  is  estimated  that  around  45,000  streetlights  are  currently \ninstalled in the Kathmandu valley.  \n  \n5. \nfollowing: \n \n\nJustifications  for  implementation  of  a  solar-powered  streetlight  program  include  the \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nSolar power is a clean and renewable source of energy.  \nNepal has a good solar resource (300 sunny days per year, with approximately \n4.5 kWh per square meter per day of energy intensity). \nPayment  for  street  lighting  energy  is  a  problem  for  municipalities.  This  problem \nwill be resolved by solar-power streetlights, and the NEA\u2019s revenue leakage will \nbe reduced. \nThe  program  will  mitigate  the  effects  of  capacity  and  energy  shortages  during \npeak demand periods. \n\n                                                 \n1  The current supply shortfalls that affect the integrated Nepal power system for most of winter mean that any peak \ncapacity  and  energy  that  is  freed  up  through  the  introduction  of  solar-powered  streetlights  will  be  consumed  by \nother consumers, and there will actually be an increase in sales rather than a reduction in generation. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n\n(v)  Where  solar-powered  streetlights  are  deployed  to  areas  that  currently  have  no \npublic  lighting,  there  will  be  reductions  in  crime  and  fear  of  crime,  and \nimprovements in the safety and security of pedestrians. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n6. \nThe impact of the solar street lighting component will be reduced burden on the national \nelectricity grid allowing greater energy access to people. The outcome would be gradual shifting \nof  street  lighting  load  away  from  the  national  electricity  grid  through  renewable  energy-based \nstreet lighting systems.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe program will have the following outputs:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nReplacement  of  incandescent  bulbs,  sodium  vapor  lamps,  and  mercury  vapor \nlamps  with  compact  fluorescent,  low-pressure  sodium,  or  light-emitting  diodes \n(LEDs) powered by solar and wind energy.  \nRetrofitting  of  existing  conventional  street  lighting  systems  with  solar  lights  and \nwind-solar hybrid lights systems. \nInstallation of turnkey package systems of solar-powered street lighting systems \nand wind-solar hybrid street lighting systems. \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimate and Financing Plan \n\n8. \nThe total program cost will be $2.7 million, as shown in Table A11. The Government will \nfinance  $0.2  million  of  this  and  the  balance  will  be  financed  from  ADB's  Multi-Donor  Clean \nEnergy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. \n \n\nTable A11: Solar and Solar-Wind Streetlight Program Cost Estimate \n($'000) \n\n \nItem \nA.

The NEA \nwill establish a technical team that will procure the solar streetlight components following ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and install and maintain them. \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  to  the  NEA  to  help  (i)  identify  the  exact  locations  of  the \nstreetlights  to  be  replaced  and/or  installed,  (ii)  design  the  system,  (iii)  assist  in  preparing  bids \nand procurement, and (iv) supervise the installation of solar streetlights. NEA staff will also be \ntrained in operation and maintenance of solar streetlights. \n \n10. \nA  coordination  committee  will  be  established  comprising  representatives  from  the \nMinistry of Local Development (chair), NEA, participating municipalities, the Alternative Energy \nPromotion  Center,  and  other  relevant  personnel.  The  committee  will  identify  key  areas  for \ninstallation of solar streetlights and oversee the implementation of the program. The Alternative \nEnergy  Promotion  Center  will  assist  in  testing  the  solar  equipment,  and  will  provide  other \ntechnical inputs to the technical team in the NEA and the committee. Community groups and/or \ncommittees  will  be  mobilized  in  each  program  area  to  work  with  the  NEA  to  maintain  the \nstreetlights.  \n \nF. \n\nBenefits \n\n11. \nThe  energy  consumed  by  1,000  conventional  streetlights  is  equivalent  to  about  750 \nMWh per year, all of which is drawn from the grid. If this amount of energy at the user end is \nreplaced by solar-powered streetlights, the potential energy savings is 750 MWh annually. The \nbenefit to the NEA would be around $0.15 million (cost of avoided diesel generation plus cost of \navoided purchases from India). The total physical investment cost of the program is $2.1 million. \nOn this basis, the simple payback period would be around 14 years. \n \nG. \n\nPotential Program Areas \n\nThe  following  have  been  identified  as  potential  pilot  areas  for  the  program  (with \n\n12. \nproposed number of streetlight installations in parentheses); all are in the Kathmandu valley. \n \n\nThamel (63 installations); \nNew Road (62 installations); \nPashupatinath, Bouddha, and Swoyambhunath stupas (40 installations); \nPatan and Bhaktapur heritage sites (25 installations); \nKingsway (33 installations); and \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi)  main roads leading to Kathmandu Airport (245 installations). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \n\nCountry and Project Title: Nepal/Energy Access and Efficiency Improvement Project \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n57 \n\nLending/Financing Modality: \n\nProject \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\nSouth Asia Department/ \nEnergy Division \n\n \n\n \n\nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nNepal is one of the poorest countries in the world with a per capita gross domestic product of around $383. More \nthan  80%  of  the  country\u2019s  population  lives  in  rural  areas,  where  poverty  is  more  prevalent  and  severe  than  in \nurban  areas.  Poverty  incidence  in  Nepal  is  high,  and  is  more  severe  among  unprivileged  social  groups.  The \n2003\u20132004 Nepal  Living  Standard  Survey  shows  that,  although  poverty  in  Nepal  declined  between  1995\u20131996 \nand 2003\u20132004, 31% of Nepalese people are still below the national poverty line as of 2003\u20132004. The rate of \npoverty  reduction  was  lower  in  rural  areas  (20%)  compared  with  urban  areas  (56%)  between  1995\u20131996  and \n2003\u20132004.   \n \nIn Nepal, electricity has been considered as important to improving quality of life and is the most important factor \nin increasing economic development.  \n \nAbout 39% of the population have an electricity connection, although there are regional and urban and/or rural \ndisparities. Lack of grid connectivity and network capacity shortfalls have proved to be an impediment to efficient \nenergy consumption. Severe bottlenecks impinge on day-to-day operation, and energy losses in some parts of \nthe  network  are  large.  Lack  of  transmission  connectivity  and  capacity  has  been  hindering  development  of \nhydropower  generation  spread  across  the  country.  The  distribution  network  capacity  constraints  as  well  as \noutdated  network  planning,  design,  operation,  and  maintenance  have  led  to  inefficient  supply  of  electricity  to \nconsumers. The Project aims to improve the efficiency of supply and use, improve grid connectivity, and control \nelectricity  leakage.  Benefits  of  the  Project  will  be  contributing  to  meeting  the  daily  energy  requirements  and  to \nproviding  efficient  services.  This  will  result  in  enhanced  economic  activity  and  employment  opportunities, \nincluding for poor and socially disadvantaged people during the implementation phase.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1. Key Issues  \nThe Government of Nepal formulated its 10th Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007) as its principal policy and strategy for \npoverty  reduction.  The  plan  is  based  on  four  pillars  of  poverty  reduction:  (i)  sustainable  and  broadly  based \neconomic  growth,  (ii)  social  sector  development,  (iii)  a  targeted  program  for  excluded  groups,  and  (iv)  good \ngovernance.  The  key  goals  and  targets  of  the  plan  include  increasing  gross  domestic  product  growth  rates  by \nimproving  social  and  physical  facilities  and  infrastructure.  The  Government\u2019s  Interim  Plan  2008\u20132010  is \ncommitted to the policies and strategies adopted by the 10th Five-Year Plan. Among other things, the underlying \nconstraints on achieving the goals of poverty reduction include low access to social and economic facilities and \nservices including electricity, limited economic opportunities, and low income and consumption.   \n \nThe  transmission  network  expansion  components  will  increase  power  transfer  capacity  between  hydropower \ngeneration  areas  (including  export-oriented  hydropower  schemes)  and  the  load  centers,  while  the  distribution \nnetwork capacity will reduce distribution losses and improve access to efficient electricity. Economic benefits of \nthe  project  are  expected  to  accrue  through  the  delivery  of  efficient  energy  to  consumers.  Removal  of  network \nconstraints will reduce the need for consumers to use less-efficient energy sources, and reduced losses will allow \nelectricity  to  be  delivered  more  efficiently  to  consumers.  This  will  also  contribute  to  using  the  Government's \nInterim Plan priority of expanding hydropower as the foundation of overall economic development. The project\u2019s \nbenefits  are  directly  and  indirectly  related  to  the  increased  economic  activity,  particularly  due  to  creation  of \nincome-generating opportunities through small-enterprise and industrial development.  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n58  \n \n\n \nThe poverty reduction potential of this project is significant since Nepal is currently facing peak supply constraints \ndue to lack of generation and network capacity. Grid-connected consumers in Nepal are facing as much as 100 \nhours  (or  more)  of  planned  supply  interruption  per  week  in  winter.  The  project\u2019s  benefits  are  directly  linked  to \nproviding  efficient  electricity,  thus  significantly  improving  the  overall  social  and  economic  situation,  as  efficient \nelectricity supply directly contributes to increased production and creates employment opportunities.  \n \n\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe  proposed  project  aims  to  improve  (i)  grid  connectivity,  (ii)  efficiency  of  electricity  distribution,  and  (iii) \ndemand-side management through appropriate interventions to ease the supply and shortage constraints in the \nproposed project locations and in other parts of the country. \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  transmission  system  and  distribution  capacity  in  the  northern  part  of  the \nKathmandu valley where demand is growing rapidly due to urban and commercial expansion to the north of the \ncity and extension of the Budhanilkantha residential area. The strengthened system will also meet the demand \nfor electric supply in the western part of Kathmandu, and improve reliability. The Kathmandu valley is one of the \nmain load centers, consuming about 37% of the total energy.  \n \nFinally, the project  will provide adequate power supply to western Nepal, thereby promoting industrial growth. It \nwill  also  help  to  import  more  power  from  Tanakpur  (India),  and  evacuate  the  power  from  the  Chameliya  and \nUpper Karnali hydropower plants which are under construction in the western region. The second circuit stringing \nwill  also  help  to  meet  the  demand  of  additional  energy  (19  megavolt-amperes  [MVA])  required  for  the  Danish \nInternational  Development  Agency  (Danida)-funded  Rural  Electrification  Project  by  2012,  and  add  around  13 \nMVA for the Asian Development Bank-funded Eighth Power Rural Electrification Project a.   Implementation of the \nproject will contribute to filling the daily energy requirements and provide efficient services resulting in increased \neconomic activity and employment opportunities.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation: \n\n \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation \n \nConsultation with NEA officials was focused to solicit project-related data and documents and to gather further \ninformation required for project preparation activities. District stakeholders were consulted to inform them about \nthe project, collect required information and suggestions relevant to the project, and seek their support for project \npreparation. Consultation with the local community, including the project-affected families, was undertaken to (i) \ndisseminate information about the proposed project and likely impacts, (ii) solicit their view and suggestions, (iii) \ncollect  socioeconomic  and  census  data,  (iv)  assess  the  scope  of  effects  on  private  and  community  assets,  (v) \ncollect  information  about  different  assets  likely  to  be  affected,  and  (vi)  make  provisions  and  determine  other \nfinancial assistance to be made to the affected people. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring?  \n\n\u22a0   Information sharing       \u22a0  Consultation     \u22a0  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n Yes    \u22a0 No  \n\n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including \nbudget, consultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nC&P plan required for project implementation will be included in the resettlement plan. \n\nC.   Gender and Development  \n\n1.  Key Issues: \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n59 \n\n \n\nBased on the findings of field observation, socioeconomic survey, and community consultation in different project \nlocations,  women  (particularly  in  rural  areas)  have  secondary  status  compared  to  their  male  counterparts.  Low \nlevels  of  literacy,  high  unemployment,  the  tradition  of  early  marriage,  and  women's  extensive  involvement  in \nhousehold activities are socially prescribed roles of women in the study area.  \n \nThe  findings  of  the  study  also  reveal  that  women's  role  in  decisions  related  to  financial  and  social  matters  are \nlimited.  However,  more  than  90%  of  decisions  on  household  chores  are  made  by  women.  Collectively  (i)  the \nmajority of the women are illiterate, (ii) women have a higher level of vulnerability, (iii) incomes for female heads \nof  households  are  less  than  those  of  male  heads,  (iv)  women\u2019s  daily  wage  rates  in  the  study  area  are  about \n10%\u201325%  less  than  those  of  men,  and  (v)  none  of  the  households  were  using  clean  energy  (electricity)  for \ncooking purposes. Instead, firewood is main the source of cooking energy and most of the women's time is spent \non  household  activities  and  cooking  food  in  a  smoky  environment.  Women  are  expected  to  continue  using \nfirewood for cooking, but will use a cleaner source of energy for lighting. \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  improve  health  conditions  for  women  (who  mainly  remain  at  home),  and  increase \nsecurity on the streets as a result of the improved street lighting. \n \nAn  increased  trend  of  mobility  (mostly  male  population)  in  search  of  employment  in  India  and  overseas  has \nincreased the risk to women of both trafficking and HIV/AIDS.  \n \n2.
