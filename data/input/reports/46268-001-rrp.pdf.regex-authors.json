I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited \n(IREDA), to be guaranteed by India, for the Clean Energy Finance Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed MFF totaling $500 million consists of financial intermediation loans to \nIREDA. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) funds will support lending by IREDA to eligible \nrenewable  energy  subprojects  in  India,  including  wind,  biomass,  hydropower,  solar,  and \ncogeneration technologies.2 This MFF will leverage private capital to expand sector lending in \norder to add renewable energy capacity in India. \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Background. India has undergone a rapid economic transformation, with an average \nannual gross domestic product growth rate of 6.8% during 2008\u20132013. However, more rapid \neconomic  growth  is  inhibited  by  chronic  electricity  shortages,  which  constrain  commercial \nactivity. Around 300 million citizens (around 25% of India\u2019s population) have no access to \nelectricity,3 while many with access have an intermittent supply. Meanwhile, the government\u2019s \npush to narrow the electricity supply gap has increased India\u2019s dependence on fossil fuels, \nparticularly  imported  oil  (for  diesel-based  captive  generation)  and  coal.  To  balance  the \nconflicting objectives among growth, climate change, and energy security, India is scaling up \nrenewable energy investment.  \n \n4.  Demand  analysis.  The  Government  of  India  has  ambitious  programs  to  target \nrenewable energy development as a key element in the overall expansion of power generation \ncapacity. As of 31 December 2013, India\u2019s total installed electricity-generating capacity was \naround 234 gigawatts (GW), which included around 30 GW of renewable energy.4 Based on \nstrong  policy  incentives,  India\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  targets  an  increase  of  30  GW  of \nrenewable energy generation capacity by FY2017, and a further increase of 45 GW by FY2022 \n(footnote 3). Demand for renewable energy investment is thus expected to be robust during the \n10-year life of this MFF. \n \n5.  Financing challenges. A major challenge to sustaining high levels of renewable energy \ndeployment in India is the lack of sufficient long-term debt financing for project lending. Due to \nthe relatively high upfront (per megawatt) cost of renewable energy projects, loan tenors of 12 \nor more years are usually required to make projects financially viable. However, such long-term \nfunds are scarce in the Indian market, where project lending is predominantly bank-based, and \ncommercial banks have difficulty lending long-term funds from short-term deposits, given the \nimplied asset\u2013liability mismatch. Similarly, the implementation of Basel III capital regulations in \nIndia will lead to banks having to raise additional capital given the stricter requirements on \ncapital adequacy and asset liability management, and to raise additional long-term funds. Both \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  IREDA also lends, on a limited basis, to energy-efficiency subprojects, which are permitted under the MFF. \n3  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2013.

New Delhi. \n(http://www.cea.nic.in/installed_capacity.html). This includes wind power (over 19.5 GW), small hydropower (3.5 \nGW), solar power (2.4 GW), cogeneration (2.4 GW), biomass (1.2 GW), and \u201cother\u201d (0.4 GW). ", "2 \nof these factors are expected to lead to rising long-term funding costs and constrained project \nlending capacity.5 \n \n6.  Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency Limited. Under the administrative \noversight of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, IREDA is a wholly government-owned \nnonbank financial  institution  established  in  1987  to  promote  renewable  energy  investment. \nIREDA is well capitalized with increasing profitability. Taxable bonds issued by IREDA from \n2008 are all rated AAA by local rating agencies, including Credit Analysis and Research Limited \n(known as CARE Ratings) and Brickwork. IREDA\u2019s lending constitutes about 11% of total \nrenewable energy lending in India.6 What differentiates IREDA from other commercial lenders is \nits deep sector knowledge; experience to understand the technical and commercial risks; and its \nadvantageous long-term capital base. This enables IREDA to provide limited recourse, cash \nflow-based financing for up to 15 years, which most commercial banks in India cannot.7 In \naddition, commercial banks typically favor lending based on the balance sheets of their existing, \nlarge  corporate  customers  irrespective  of  the quality  of the  underlying  project,  rather than \nproject, cash flow-based lending. IREDA\u2019s ability to fund renewable energy projects on the \nmerits of their cash flows and risk profiles enables it to fund good projects from smaller, less-\ncapitalized  sponsors.  This  widens  the  pool  of  project  developers  and  investable  projects, \nleverages additional private capital, and facilitates renewable project development. \n \n7.  Road map. In 2008, India launched the National Action Plan for Climate Change to \npromote  sustainable  development  by  using  clean  technologies  to  limit  greenhouse  gas \nemissions, and to increase the share of power generation by renewables to 15% by FY2022. To \nhelp meet this target, the government is leveraging IREDA\u2019s position as a uniquely specialized \nrenewable energy financier. IREDA\u2019s medium- to long-term business plan (FY2014\u2013FY2024) \nincludes a total disbursement of about $6.6 billion, leading to an estimated additional 13.4 GW \nof energy capacity. To accomplish this expansion, IREDA is building its capacity, streamlining \nits operations, and seeking additional capital from ADB and other sources to enable increased \nsupport for renewable energy investments. \n \n8.  Strategic context. ADB support to IREDA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which \nincludes promoting renewable energy to increase energy security and facilitate the transition to \na low carbon economy.8 It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for \nIndia, 2013\u20132017,9 which emphasizes clean and renewable energy expansion. ADB support \naligns with the CPS in terms of its energy sector road map and financial sector development \n(catalyzing infrastructure investments, including through investment funds and credit lines). The \ninvestment program thus directly aligns with multiple facets of the CPS. \n \n9.  Policy  framework.  ADB\u2019s  support  is  consistent  with  India\u2019s  policies  and  initiatives. \nTaking  into  account  India\u2019s  energy  security  concerns  and  the  environment,  the  Integrated \nEnergy Policy 2006 identified the need to expand the use of renewable energy technologies as \n                                                \n5  Reserve Bank of India required that all Indian banks adopt the Basel III standards from April 2013 in a phased \nmanner, with full adoption by 31 March 2019. \n6  Other major lenders include the Power Finance Corporation, the State Bank of India, and the ICICI Bank. Note that \nIREDA\u2019s subprojects are not strategically different from the subprojects funded by other commercial banks. \n7  Commercial banks or private nonbank financial institutions in India can usually provide similar loans of up to 8 or 9 \nyears of tenor, and generally have a higher level of recourse to project sponsors. \n8  ADB. 2009.

The  Jawaharlal  Nehru  National  Solar \nMission, launched in 2010, intends to deploy 20,000 megawatts (MW) of solar power by 2022. \nRenewable energy policy incentives include tax incentives, feed-in (e.g., preferential) tariffs, \ngeneration-based  incentives,11 and  regulations  establishing  minimum  renewable  purchase \nobligations  for  power  distribution  utilities.  By  bringing  critically  needed  longer-term  debt \nfinancing  to  the  renewable  energy  sector  in  India,  ADB\u2019s  support  will  complement  these \ngovernment incentives, catalyze private sector investment, and facilitate sector development. \n \n10.  Investment program. The government has requested ADB to provide a $500 million \nMFF to fund a portion of the long-term credit IREDA needs to meet its renewable energy \ndevelopment target (para. 7). The MFF leverages public sector resources (from IREDA) to \ncatalyze private sector investments in renewable energy. Increasing the power supply through \nrenewable  energy  sources  sustains  economic  activities,  alleviates  poverty,  and  supports \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable growth, while minimizing India\u2019s carbon footprint. The \nMFF will incorporate a comprehensive institutional capacity development program, supported by \nIREDA, development partners, and  ADB technical assistance (TA).12 The preconditions for \nusing the MFF modality are in place, including the road map and strategy, policy framework, \nand investment and financing plans. The MFF is the most suitable modality, and allows ADB to \nmake a long-term commitment to supporting the institution.13 The MFF modality enables ADB to \nwork with IREDA to better match ADB\u2019s energy strategy in India with the country\u2019s renewable \nenergy goals over the medium-term. More specifically, the MFF approach gives IREDA the \nphased funding it needs to match its subproject pipeline growth, and provides flexibility to adjust \nsubloan  terms  and  future  tranche  conditions  as  needed  to  match  IREDA\u2019s  onlending \nrequirements, while preserving the possibility of offering innovative financial products (e.g., local \ncurrency financing, partial risk guarantees, and other credit enhancement products). \n \n11.  Lessons.

That loan leveraged additional investments up to 2.1 \ntimes.

The first tranche of the MFF will be for $200 million, with a 20-\nyear term including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the guarantee and loan agreements. \nThe second and third tranches are expected to be for $150 million each and estimated to occur \nin 2018 and 2021, respectively (Table 2). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  IREDA will be the borrower for the MFF, and will also function as the executing agency. \nIn order to guarantee IREDA\u2019s repayment of the ADB loan under tranche 1, Government of \nIndia  will  enter  into  a  guarantee  agreement  with  ADB.  IREDA  shall  use  ADB\u2019s  funds  in \naccordance with the specified eligibility criteria set out in the facility administration manual \n(FAM). Subprojects will be selected and approved following the procedures set out in the FAM. \nIREDA\u2019s loans to subborrowers will be priced taking into account IREDA\u2019s cost of funds and \nbased on subproject-specific risk (inclusive of subproject cash flows), and guided by technology-\nspecific risks. IREDA will establish a functioning environmental and social management system \n(ESMS)  to  screen  the  subprojects  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009). The ESMS document to govern safeguard activities has been endorsed by IREDA.20 \nThe MFF will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) \napplicable to financial intermediation loans. \n \n18.  Takeout finance. In addition to direct subloans, IREDA may also use up to 20% of the \nADB  funds  to  buy  out  renewable  energy  loans  from  other  financial  institutions.  IREDA\u2019s \nexclusive focus on renewable energy lending gives it a unique ability to manage renewable \nenergy  assets,  such  as  structuring  subprojects  with  cost  overruns  or  providing  additional \nfinance. Takeout finance will also free up the assets of other financial institutions to engage in \n                                                \n19 Unrestricted sources are defined as any sources other than the ADB facility, e.g., any forms of debt or equity. \n20 Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nadditional lending. Takeout finance may include subprojects that are financially closed, under \nconstruction, or fully commissioned. Further details on the takeout finance arrangement are \nprovided in the FAM.

Capacity development. IREDA is implementing a comprehensive institutional capacity \ndevelopment  program  with  the  support  of  its  development  partners\u2014ADB,  the  French \nDevelopment Agency (AFD), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW; the latter has ongoing TA projects totaling over $2 \nmillion  that  cover  risk  management,  treasury  operations,  a  credit  risk-rating  system,  and \ninternational  financial  reporting  standards.  AFD  has  an  ongoing  TA  totaling  \u20ac300,000  and \nfocuses on the development of new renewable energy technologies. JICA is preparing TA \ncovering new renewable energy technologies, financial mechanisms for commercialization, and \na computerized database for project monitoring and performance evaluation.22 ADB currently \nsupports the operationalization of an environment and social safeguard unit (ESSU). ADB will \nalso provide a capacity development TA from 2014 or 2015. During the implementation of \ntranche 1, ADB intends to help IREDA strengthen its financial management practices, including \nby  assessing  IREDA\u2019s  provision  review  and  implementing  liquidity  and  interest  rate  gap \nreporting  (footnote  12).  All  capacity  development  work  will  be  provided  to  IREDA  in  a \ncoordinated,  structured,  and  harmonized  manner  to  ensure  tasks  designed  by  various \ndevelopment partners at different times and/or loan tranches can be incorporated into ADB\u2019s \nMFF implementation. This will provide substantial gains to IREDA, because it will be possible to \napply the resulting systems to all development partner assistance (i.e., one ESMS will meet \ngovernment and development partner requirements). Detailed implementation arrangements \nare provided in the development coordination linked document.23 In view of evolving capacity \n                                                \n21 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 The activities from the development partners are indicative, through ADB\u2019s dialogue with IREDA. \n23 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n ", "7 \ndevelopment needs and the size of ongoing TA programs, ADB\u2019s TA (footnote 12) is estimated \nto be $1 million. \n \n21.  Retroactive  financing.  Under  each  tranche,  ADB  may,  subject  to  its  policies  and \nprocedures, permit retroactive financing of eligible expenditures incurred not earlier than 12 \nmonths before the date of signing of the related loan agreement; the retroactive financing \nrequest may not exceed 20% of each tranche\u2019s total amount. Use of retroactive financing is \nsubject to the subprojects meeting all eligibility, safeguard compliance, and other requirements. \nIREDA acknowledges that approval of retroactive financing will not constitute a commitment by \nADB to finance the subprojects.  \n \n22.  Maximum ADB financing and free limit. ADB funds can be used to finance up to 50% \nof the total subproject cost. Under tranche 1, no free limit will be provided. Under tranches 2 and \n3, ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, permit on request a free limit up to a \nspecified threshold, based on ADB\u2019s assessment of IREDA\u2019s operating performance, appraisal \nstandards, portfolio quality, and average loan size during MFF implementation. \n \n23.  Eligibility criteria. ADB funds shall be used to finance subprojects within the renewable \nenergy  subsectors  (that  generate  electricity  and/or  energy  through  new  and  renewable \nsources).24 The subproject eligibility criteria and approval procedures are outlined in the FAM.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s  due  diligence  consisted  of  detailed  financial,  economic,  technical,  market, \ninstitutional,  and  related  compliance  reviews  to  ensure  IREDA\u2019s  capacity  to  successfully \nimplement the MFF. At the institutional level, ADB conducted financial risk management, credit, \ntechnical, procurement, environment and social safeguard, and climate risk assessments to \nensure IREDA\u2019s ability to comply with ADB\u2019s project implementation requirements. This included \na  review  of  IREDA\u2019s  processes  and  procedures.  ADB  has  also  conducted  integrity  due \ndiligence, and rated IREDA\u2019s capacity to be satisfactory. Safeguards due diligence included \nsubproject sites visits, and interactions with the project promoters, local village leaders, and the \ncommunities to understand the nature of environmental and social issues.  \n \n25.  IREDA has a unique market position in financing renewable energy in India, with access \nto a variety of funding sources to catalyze private sector investments. The viability of the \nsubproject pipeline, which consists mostly of private sector renewable energy projects, also \nbenefits from government policy support and financial incentives. IREDA\u2019s continuous business \nexpansion and improving financial performance since FY2007 have been facilitated by the \npositive business and policy environment.25  \n \n26.  The MFF\u2019s main beneficiaries are private sector renewable energy investors. The MFF is \nalso expected to increase economic activity and employment, improve livelihoods and quality of \nlife, improve environmental conditions, and strengthen India\u2019s public sector institutional capacity \nto institute international best practices, particularly with respect to safeguard compliance. \n \n                                                \n24 Includes wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, and cogeneration projects. Energy-efficiency subprojects will also be \npermitted. \n25 Economic and financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  ADB assessed IREDA\u2019s ability to appraise the technical viability of renewable energy \nsubprojects  and found its  technical  assessment  process to  be strong.  IREDA\u2019s  subproject \nappraisal  process  begins  with  a  \u201cknow-your-customer\u201d  review,  followed  by  more  detailed \nappraisals to confirm the technical and associated financial viability. IREDA includes an in-depth \nanalysis of the proposed renewable energy technology and its risks and performance. IREDA \nanalyzes external technical risks (e.g., electrical grid access and power evacuation concerns), \nand conducts a detailed assessment of subproject preparedness in terms of clearances and \nother  statutory  requirements.  IREDA  has  27  years  of  experience  in  technical  appraisal  of \nrenewable energy projects, and its technical capacity is considered satisfactory by ADB. \n  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  Because ADB\u2019s MFF will finance IREDA operations for a range of eligible subprojects \nover time, the viability of IREDA (the financial intermediary) is the best available proxy for the \neconomic and financial performance of the overall project. According to ADB guidelines,26 the \nmost  important  criteria  for  determining  the  appropriateness  of  a  financial  intermediary\u2019s \nperformance are capital adequacy, asset quality, management quality, earnings, liquidity, and \nsensitivity to market risk. For IREDA, the status of most of these indicators is satisfactory and \nimproved  during  FY2007\u2014FY2013.  IREDA\u2019s  foreign  currency  and  interest  rate  risks  are \nmitigated through swap transactions. Economic and financial internal rates of return on sample \neligible subprojects are provided in the economic and financial analysis (footnote 25). The case \nstudy  provides  a  snapshot  of  the  economic  and  financial  performance  of  typical  eligible \nsubprojects. The incremental economic benefits are the additional power generation and the \npositive externalities from improved IREDA operational efficiency and improvement of debt \nmarket  condition.  Renewable  energy  also  generates  positive  but  difficult  to  quantify \nenvironmental benefits such as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants \ntypically associated with conventional power generation facilities.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n29.  Financial management. IREDA has the financial management capability to administer \nthe MFF. IREDA\u2019s board of directors oversees all operations. IREDA has adequate capacity for \nbudgeting,  accounting,  finance,  assets  and  liabilities  management,  internal  controls,  and \nreporting functions. There are well-defined operating procedures and guidelines and proper \ninternal and external audit controls. IREDA\u2019s accounting system is based on Indian Accounting \nStandard as adapted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and they have a \ncapable  management  information  system  including  financial  accounts,  loan  management, \npayroll, and a reporting system compatible with the Credit Information Bureau (India). IREDA is \nsubject to the Reserve Bank of India prudential regulations for nonbank financial companies, \nand is well within its capital adequacy requirements of 15%.27 The overall financial management \ncontrol risk is moderate.   \n \n                                                \n26 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila (Section 6.4.

IREDA\u2019s capital adequacy ratio was between 25% and 35% from 2010 to 2013 and at 25% as \nper March 2013 unaudited financial statements. \n ", "9 \n30.  Procurement and disbursement.  All procurement to be financed under the MFF will \nbe carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. ADB will encourage IREDA to \nrequire its subborrowers to adopt internationally competitive bidding procedures to the extent \npossible when the amount of the investment is unusually large and economy and efficiency can \nbe gained through such procedures. For procurement of goods and services to be financed by \nsubloans from the ADB loan, IREDA will ensure that prices are reasonable and that relevant \nfactors\u2014e.g.,  time  of  delivery,  efficiency,  reliability,  suitability  for  the  subproject,  and  (for \nconsulting services) quality and competence\u2014are taken into account. ADB loan proceeds will \nbe disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n31.  Anticorruption policy. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to \ntime) was explained to and discussed with the government and IREDA. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  The investment program supports renewable energy development in India. The benefits \nof renewable  energy  capacity  additions  include globalized  benefits  in  the form  of reduced \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions,  national  benefits  in  terms  of  enhanced  energy  security  and \nadditional electricity supply contributing to inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic \ngrowth, and localized benefits of improvement of livelihoods and job creation at the subproject \nsites.  The  poverty  reduction  impact  of  renewable  energy  projects  can  be  both  direct  and \nindirect. Directly, additional power generation supports economic activities and improves the \nlivelihoods  of  individuals  through  the  provision  of  lighting,  heat,  refrigeration,  and  other \nhousehold amenities. The investment also creates employment and income, including economic \nbenefits  for  other  business  sectors,  service  providers,  and  related  industries.  The  strong \nsafeguard measures under ADB\u2019s MFF ensure the compliance of subprojects with environment, \nsocial  (resettlement  and  indigenous  people),  labor,  and  other  requirements.  Indirectly, \nrenewable energy projects minimize the negative environmental impacts and improve general \npublic health conditions. In addition, the investment will improve some basic infrastructure\u2014 \nincluding  roads,  sanitation,  electric  and  water  supplies,  and  community  infrastructure \n \ndevelopment\u2014under IREDA\u2019s corporate social responsibility program. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  The  tranche  1  loan  is  classified  as  category  FI  for  impacts  on  the  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; the \nsame  is  expected  for  all  future  tranches.  Renewable  energy  subprojects  generally  offer \nenvironmental  benefits  because  they  serve  as  an  alternative  to  the  fossil  fuel  extraction, \ntransport, and combustion associated with conventional power generation. Renewable energy \nsubprojects funded under the MFF are generally of a small size. IREDA is committed to working \nto  meeting  international  best  practices  in  subproject  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nimplementation requirements to address subproject impacts, as requested by the international \nlenders. Under the MFF, IREDA will establish a functioning ESSU satisfactory to ADB (and, \nover time, to other development partners), including the nomination of two designated full-time \nstaff  members  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  ESMS,  and  a  responsible  institutional \ncompliance officer. The ESMS will be maintained throughout the term of the MFF. A TA, to be \nprovided in 2014 or 2015, will assist IREDA to attain the required capacity to implement the \nADB safeguard system. If capacity gaps exist, consultant support will be provided to fill gaps \nuntil the required capacity is in place.  \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  At a macroeconomic level, a protracted economic slowdown in the international and \ndomestic markets may reduce investor appetite for renewable energy subprojects. Adverse \npolicy conditions, including changes to the regulatory framework that supports green growth, \ncould also affect the forecasted demand for such  subprojects. However, the policy risk is \nunlikely to significantly impact IREDA\u2019s operations due to the compelling case for government \nsupport to the renewable energy sector. As an institution, IREDA faces business risk from its \nnarrow renewable energy portfolio base. Any adverse impact to the renewable energy sector or \nthe power sector in general could cause the credit quality of IREDA\u2019s portfolio to decline.28 \nHowever, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n35.  The government and IREDA have assured ADB that implementation of the investment \nprogram shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the FAM and loan documents. \n \n36.  IREDA has given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the \nframework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the government and IREDA with \nrespect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan agreement and guarantee \nagreement for the respective tranches.  \n \n37.  As condition precedent to drawdown of tranche 1, IREDA will have established the \nESMS and fully staffed the ESSU or made other arrangements to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the multitranche financing facility to Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency \nLimited, to be guaranteed by India, for the Clean Energy Finance Investment Program in an \naggregate principal amount not exceeding $500,000,000, which comprises the provision of \nloans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest and other terms to be determined in \naccordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and \nsubject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n9 October 2014 \n                                                \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact    For all indicators:  Assumption \nIncreased renewable  Installed renewable energy  Central Electricity  Continued energy sector \nenergy infrastructure  generation capacity is  Authority annual reports  reforms such as \n16.5% of total capacity by    development of a robust \n2027 (2013 baseline:  Ministry of New and  renewable energy \n9.25%).
