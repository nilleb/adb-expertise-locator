The  facility  will  contribute  to  good  portfolio  performance  of  transport \nsector projects. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FACILITY \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nSri  Lanka\u2019s  strategic  position  in  fast-growing  South  Asia,  near  the  main  sea  lanes \n3. \nbetween Europe and Asia, has allowed Colombo to develop very early as an international port \ncity and subsequently as a transshipment point for cargo originating in or destined for the Indian \nsubcontinent.  The  country\u2019s  economy  faces  several  short-term  challenges  in  2016  as  the \ngovernment seeks to undertake difficult reforms to re-start fiscal consolidation and tackle high-\npriority structural reforms, but it has favorable medium-term prospects given that the issues are \nbeing  dealt  with  proactively.2 Real  gross  domestic  product  growth  was  4.8%  in  2015,  slightly \nhigher  than  in  2014.3 The  strong  increase  in  services,  continued  growth  in  agriculture,  and  a \npositive  (albeit  declining)  contribution  from  industry  helped  the  country  maintain  its  growth. \nHowever,  a  slowdown  in  public  and  private  investments,  as  well  as  the  negative  effects  of \nslowing  world  trade,  prevented  Sri  Lanka  from  achieving  even  faster  growth.  To  attain  high, \ninclusive,  and  sustained  growth,  the  country  needs  to  further  invest  in  its  international  and \ndomestic transport infrastructure. \n \n4. \nSri Lanka\u2019s transport sector delivers key functions to international trade and its domestic \neconomy. Taking advantage of its strategic location in global trade, Sri Lanka developed several \ninternational  transport  facilities,  of  which  Colombo  Port  is  the  most  important.  To  serve  a \ndynamic domestic economy, the functions of the transport sector have gradually changed, from \nmoving  agricultural  commodities  toward  Colombo  to  providing  more  diversified  services  and \ncatering  to  the  value-adding  manufacturing  industry.  New  economic  activities  continue  to  be \nestablished close to population centers. They place heavy demands on the country\u2019s transport \nnetwork to provide adequate and high-quality access. \n \n5. \nTo manage the key transport challenges, the government has taken actions to improve \nthe  performance  of the transport  sector  on  three  tiers.  First,  international  trade facilities\u2014such \nas international seaports, airports, and routes on the Asian Highway network\u2014will be operated \nand further improved to international standards. Second, a multimodal trunk network comprising \nhighways and railways will be improved and upgraded to provide reliable and efficient transport \nservices  within  the  country.  Third,  a  comprehensive  road  network  will  be  completed  and \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2016. Sri Lanka: Staff Report for the 2016 Article IV Consultation and Request for a \nThree-Year  Extended  Arrangement  Under  the  Extended  Fund  Facility\u2014Press  Release;  Staff  Report;  Staff \nStatement,  and  Statement  by  the  Executive  Director  for  Sri  Lanka.  IMF  Staff  Country  Report.  No.  16/150. \nWashington, DC. \n\n3  Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nmaintained  to  provide  access  for  rural  populations  to  the  multimodal  trunk  network.  The \ngovernment requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide support for the next stage \nof infrastructure development in the road, railway, and port subsectors. \n \nRoads. Roads are the dominant mode of transportation in Sri Lanka, accounting for 93% \n6. \nof  passenger  transport, and 96%  of freight transport.  The road network  is  dense  and well  laid \nout,  and  provides  basic  spatial  coverage  of  the  country\u2019s  population  and  centers  of  economic \nactivity. Extending across 132,072 kilometers (km), it is classified by function and administrative \nresponsibility  and  is  broken  down  into  expressways  (175  km)  and  national  (11,922  km), \nprovincial (15,975 km), and local roads (about 104,000 km). Expressways were integrated into \nthe  network  only  after  the  Southern  Expressway  was  completed  in  2011.  As  of  31  May  2016, \nthree expressways are in operation. Under the guidance of the Ministry of Higher Education and \nHighways (MOHEH), the Road Development Authority (RDA) is updating its road master plan. \nUnder  the  proposed  facility,  RDA  will  formulate  an  expressway  development  program,  and \nprepare an expressway project and a port access road to directly link the Colombo port area to \nthe expressway network. \n \n7. \nRailways.  The  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Civil  Aviation  (MOTCA)  manages  the  railway \nsubsector  through  Sri  Lanka  Railways  (SLR).  The  development  of  a  railway  network  in  Sri \nLanka started in 1864. SLR currently operates 10 railway lines totaling around 1,500 route-km. \nAlmost  90%  of  the  railway  network  of  the  country  is  single  track;  the  rest  consists  of  double, \ntriple,  or  quadruple  tracks.  All  multiple  lines,  totaling  230  km,  are  on  the  Coastal  Line,  Kelani \nValley  Line,  Main  Line,  and  Puttlam  Line\u2014four  major  corridors  in  the  Colombo  Metropolitan \nRegion. The railway provides an important service during peak hours as it shuttles commuters \nbetween  the  outer  suburbs  and  central  Colombo.  The  government  intends  to  improve  the \nrailway  transport  system  to  complement  the  road  transport  system,  both  for  passengers  and \nfreight.  ADB  provided  a  TA  grant  to  SLR  to  prioritize  the  required  investment  in  Colombo\u2019s \nsuburban  railway  system,  conduct  a  feasibility  study  of  investment  projects,  and  build  the \nnecessary  capacity  of  SLR. 4 The  proposed  facility  will  prepare  the  detailed  design,  bidding \ndocuments,  safeguard  documents,  and  other  technical  studies  required  for  the  priority \ninvestment projects. \n \nPorts.  Maritime  transport  is  essential  for  Sri  Lanka  as  an  island  nation.  Colombo  Port \n8. \nhas  become  the  world\u2019s  76th  busiest  port  in  2013  by  total  shipping  tonnage  and  the  32nd \nbusiest  container  port.  The  total  container  volume  handled  in  Sri  Lanka  ports  increased  by \n108% from 2.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units in 2005 to 5.2 million  twenty-foot equivalent \nunits in 2015. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) develops and operates port facilities under \nthe supervision of the Ministry of Ports and Shipping (MOPS). In addition to Colombo Port, the \ngovernment  is  considering  the  ports  in  Galle,  Hambantota,  Kankasanthurai,  Oluvil,  and \nTrincomalee for future development to meet the demands of growing international and domestic \nmaritime transport. Each port has its own strength and weakness. ADB is processing a TA grant \nto  assist  the  SLPA  in  preparing  a  master  plan  for  the  future  development  of  port  facilities, \ndesigned  to  strategically  allocate  public  sector  resources  for  development  and  operation,  and \nguide  private  sector  investments.  Based  on  the  outcome  of the TA grant, the  proposed facility \nwill prepare the detailed design, bidding documents, safeguard documents, and other technical \nstudies required for priority investments in the port sector. \n \n9. \nGovernment  strategy.  In  its  forthcoming  Public  Investment  Program,  2016\u20132018,  the \ngovernment  aims  to  provide  proper  connectivity  to  the  economic  zones across  the  country  by \n\n                                                \n4  ADB. Sri Lanka: Colombo Suburban Railway Project. http://www.adb.org/projects/49111-002/main. \n\n\froad  transport,  increase  the  share  of  railway  transport  for  both  passengers  and  freight,  and \nenhance  the  competitive position  of  port facilities  in the  region.5 To ultimately  lead the  country \ntoward a status of upper-middle-level development, the government plans to allocate about 70% \nof  public  investment  to  economic  infrastructure,  including  roads,  railways,  and  ports.  Among \nother  sectors,  ADB  plans  to  continue  its  support  of  the  transport  sector  to  contribute  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s targets.6 \n \n10. \nFinancing  modality  and  past  experience.  A  TA  loan  is  proposed  as  the  financing \nmodality.7 The  government  had  a  good  experience  with  this  modality  when  it  implemented  a \nroad project preparatory facility (RPPF) during 2004\u20132015.8 In the past, project readiness in Sri \nLanka  was  problematic  because  detailed  design  and  procurement  documents  were  prepared \nonly  after  ADB  loans  had  been  approved  and  became  effective.  The  RPPF  significantly \nstrengthened  the  implementation  readiness  and  portfolio  performance  of  loans  in  the  road \nsubsector.  The  main  takeaways  include:  (i)  the  RPPF  provided  a  platform  for  policy  dialogue, \ninvestment  programming,  and  project  preparation;  (ii)  improved  the  readiness  of  project \nimplementation  by  decoupling  project  preparation  and  loan  processing;  and  (iii)  the  RPPF \nshould  include  mechanisms  for  capacity  building  to  improve  the  quality  of  project  preparation \nand engineering design. To proactively manage project readiness issues in the new areas of the \ntransport sector, the government, through the facility, intends to continue the successful model \nin  the  road  subsector  with  a  focus  on  developing  an  expressway  network  in  urban  and  rural \nareas, and replicating it to the railway and port subsectors. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  will  be  successfully  implemented  transport  projects.  The  outcome  will  be \n\n11. \nimproved readiness of priority transport projects. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe outputs will be (i) feasibility studies and/or detailed designs of transport projects are \ncompleted, and (ii) implementation support for transport projects is provided. The facility will be \nimplemented through three components: road, railway, and port.9 The components may involve \ncross-cutting  interventions  in  urban transport, regional  cooperation  and integration, multimodal \ntransport connectivity, and other related areas. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  facility  is  estimated  to  cost  $27.7  million,  including  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and \n\n13. \nprice contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 1).10 \n \n\n                                                \n5  Government  of  Sri  Lanka,  Department  of  National  Planning,  Ministry  of  National  Policies  and  Economic  Affairs. \n\nForthcoming.

These assessments will help the government formulate economically and financially \nviable investment transport projects. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n20. \nPolicy  and  legal.  Three  ministries  will  act  as  executing  agencies:  MOHEH,  MOTCA, \nand  MOPS. They  will formulate  the  policies and  monitor  the  performance  of  the  road,  railway, \nand port  subsectors.  RDA, the  implementing  agency for  the  road  component,  was established \nas  a  statutory  authority  with  an  independent  legal  status  through  the  Road  Development \nAuthority  Act,  1981.  RDA\u2019s  chairperson  reports  to  the  MOHEH  secretary.  MOTCA  will \nimplement the railway component through SLR, a department under the ministry and headed by \nthe general manager. SLPA, the implementing agency for the port component, was established \nas a statutory authority with an independent legal status under the Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act, \n1979. \n \n21. \nInstitutional  capacity.  Except for  SLR,  all  executing  and  implementing agencies have \nsufficient  capacity  and  past  experience  to  recruit  consultants  and  administer  contracts.  To \nsupport  SLR  in  project  implementation,  ADB  has  provided  SLR  with  project  preparatory  TA \nunder the Colombo Suburban Railway Project, which is currently being processed (footnote 4). \n \nFinancial management. A financial management assessment was carried out for RDA, \n22. \nSLR, and SLPA. RDA and SLPA have prior experience implementing ADB-funded projects, and \nsatisfactory  capacity  in  project  financial  accounting  and  in  ADB  disbursement  procedures.  All \nthree agencies have project accounting and finance teams with suitably  qualified accountants. \nThe  three  implementation  units  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  to \ntrack  the  financing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  for  the  project  preparatory \nfacility,  to  ensure  an  adequate audit  trail. The government\u2019s  Auditor General\u2019s  Department  will \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fannually  audit  the  facility  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  following  international \nauditing standards. \n \n23. \nProcurement and anticorruption measures. Only consulting services will be procured \nunder  the  facility,  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  The  Bribery  Act,  1954  (as  amended  from  time  to  time);  the  Declaration  of \nAssets  and  Liabilities  Act,  1975;  and the  Permanent  Commission  to Investigate  Allegations  of \nBribery and Corruption Act, 1994 provide the legal basis to deal with bribery and corruption. The \nauditor general monitors procurement activities. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  all  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n24. \nThe facility is not expected to have any impact on gender and social dimensions. Follow-\non  transport  projects  will  be  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB's  Handbook  on  Poverty  and \nSocial Analysis: A Working Document.12 Gender, labor, HIV/AIDS, and other social risks related \nto  follow-on  transport  projects  will  be  assessed,  and  a  mitigation  plan  will  be  prepared  to \nmanage those issues. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n25. \nThe proposed facility will support the development of environmentally and socially viable \ninvestment projects. Because it is focused on preparing investment projects and will not involve \nconstruction  work,  the  facility  is  not  expected  to  have  any  adverse  social  and  environmental \nconsequences.  The  facility  is  categorized  as  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples. Follow-on transport projects will be assessed for safeguards in accordance \nwith  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government  guidelines,  regulations,  and \npolicies.  During  the  feasibility  studies,  the  consultants  will  prepare  environmental  impact \nassessments  or  initial  environmental  examinations  as  applicable,  including  environmental \nmanagement  plans  and  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessments,  for  the  selected  transport \nprojects.  Similarly,  resettlement  planning,  indigenous  peoples  planning,  and  gender  analyses \nwill be done during this stage. Capacity building on safeguard implementation and coordination \nwill be carried out as required. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n26.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.13 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nGovernment delays in the release of \ncounterpart funds \n\nThe Asian Development Bank will finance 88.1% of the total \nexpenditure. The government will finance only taxes and duties. \nThis will ease the government's financial burden of providing \ncounterpart funding and ensure adequate cash flow during \nimplementation.
