I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $48 million to Dahanu Solar Power Private Limited (DSPPL) for the Dahanu Solar \nPower Project in India. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Reliance Power Limited (RPL) is one of the largest private power developers in India \nwith market capitalization of Rs221 billion.1 However, 86% of its portfolio is fossil-fuel based \n(predominantly coal and gas). RPL is looking to reduce its dependency on fossil fuel resources \nand develop a renewable energy portfolio of wind and solar power assets. Solar energy is one \nof the focus areas for RPL as recent regulatory initiatives (such as mandatory renewable \npurchase obligations and revised tariff guidelines) have improved the viability of solar power \nprojects in India. The Dahanu Solar Power Project will be the first solar power project to be \ndeveloped by RPL and will be the largest solar photovoltaic plant in India. \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was approached by RPL in July 2011 to help \nfinance the project. From initial discussions, ADB viewed that the project possessed sound \nfundamentals in various aspects including the financial strength of the sponsor, high-quality \nproject preparatory work, and attractive offtake tariff. In addition, with its direct purchase of \nrenewable energy by a private utility company to satisfy its renewable purchase obligations, the \nproject promotes a sustainable market platform for the development of renewable energy in \nIndia  and  endorses  the  recent  regulatory  reform  in  solar  energy.  The  project  will  strongly \ncomplement ADB\u2019s ongoing initiatives in solar energy in India. \n \n2.  Project Design  \n4.  The project entails the construction of a 40-megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic power \ngeneration plant near the village of Dhursar in Jaisalmer district of Rajasthan state. The project \nsite is 180 kilometers (km) west of the city of Jodhpur and 10 km from the Jodhpur\u2013Jaisalmer \nnational  highway  (NH-114).  The  annual  global  horizontal  irradiance2 at  the  project  site  is \nestimated to be 2,064 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter, one of the highest in the country. \n \n5.  The project will use fixed-tilt cadmium telluride thin film solar photovoltaic modules. \nCadmium telluride technology is suited to warm and dry environment such as Rajasthan where \nambient air temperatures can exceed 40\uf0b0C in summer, which can reduce the net energy yield of \nthe modules. The solar photovoltaic modules have a projected degradation of 1.0% per year for \nthe first 10 years of operation and 0.6% per year for the next 15 years of operations. \n \n6.  The electricity generated from the project will be evacuated from the project site to the \nexisting  220-kilovolt  (kV)  Dechu  substation  of  Rajasthan  Vidyut  Prasaran  Nigam  Limited \n(RVPNL) through a 30 km long, 220 kV double-circuit transmission line to be built by DSPPL. \n                                                 \n1  National Stock Exchange, 14 September 2011. \n2  Measure of intensity and availability of sunlight in a given location, which can be converted to electricity either \nthrough photovoltaic solar panels or concentrating solar thermal power technology. ", "2  \nThe  transmission  line  has  been  sized  to  evacuate  additional  phases  of  DSPPL\u2019s  solar \nphotovoltaic project. \n \n3.  The Borrower and Sponsor \n7.  The borrower, DSPPL, is a special purpose vehicle set up by RPL exclusively to develop \nthe project. DSPPL is a 100% subsidiary of RPL. RPL is a listed group company of the Reliance \nAnil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (Reliance ADA Group), established to develop, construct, and \noperate power projects in India and abroad. The Reliance ADA Group is one of India\u2019s largest \nconglomerates  with  a  strong  presence  in  telecommunications,  media  and  entertainment, \nfinancial services, infrastructure, and energy. \n \n8.  RPL has a portfolio of 33,440 MW of power generation capacity in various stages of \ndevelopment. The operational portfolio is 600 MW while 15,060 MW is under construction and \n17,780 MW is under development. Coal-fired power plants (including the three ultra-mega \npower projects\u2014Sasan, Tilaya, and Krishnapatnam) account for 61% of the total portfolio, gas-\nfired plants comprise 25%, and hydropower plants represent 14%. The proposed project is its \nfirst solar energy project. RPL\u2019s renewable energy pipeline for the next 5 years is in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Renewable Energy Projects Being Developed by Reliance Power Limited  \nCapacity  Year of \nProject  Fuel  (megawatt)  Location  Commissioning \nDahanu Solar Power Project (Phase I)  Solar  40  Rajasthan  2012 \nRajasthan Concentrating Solar Power Project  Solar  100  Rajasthan  2013 \nVashpet Wind Power Project  Wind  200  Maharashtra  2013 \nDahanu Solar Power Project (Phase II)  Solar  60  Rajasthan  2014 \nUrthing Sobla Hydroelectric Project  Hydro  400  Uttarakhand  2016 \nSource: Reliance Power Limited annual reports. \n \n9.  During FY2011, RPL generated revenues of Rs105,478 million and a net profit after tax \nof Rs7,604 million on a consolidated basis. As of 31 March 2011, RPL had a net worth of \nRs168,333 million.3 \n \n10.  RPL is owned 45% by Reliance Infrastructure Limited (R-Infra) and 40% by AAA Project \nVentures Private Limited\u2014both of which are part of the Reliance ADA Group. The remaining \n15% free float is two-thirds held by retail investors and one-third by institutional investors. RPL \nis listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n11.  The project is designed to promote sustainable economic growth by diversifying India\u2019s \nenergy mix through the addition of renewable energy capacity. The development impact of the \nproject also includes environmental benefits through more efficient use of indigenous renewable \nenergy resources with almost no emission of pollutants or greenhouse gases. In addition, the \nbuilding of the project will help prove the feasibility of utility-scale solar power projects in India \nand the operational performance in a location (Rajasthan) where substantial development in \nsolar power is planned during 2012\u20132017. \n \n                                                 \n3  RPL. 2011. Audited Financial Results for the Year Ended March 31, 2011. Mumbai. ", "  3\n2.  Outcome \n12.  The project will demonstrate the profitability and sustainability of utility-scale private solar \npower generation in India by generating 56,160 megawatt-hours (MWh)4 of clean energy per \nannum while delivering adequate returns for the private sponsor. \n \n3.  Outputs \n13.     Successful implementation of the project will result in the construction and operation of \nIndia\u2019s first utility-scale solar photovoltaic power plant and increase solar power generation \ncapacity in the country by 40 MW. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations   \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n14.  The  project  supports  two  of  the  five  core  operational  areas  of  Strategy  2020\u2014\ninfrastructure  and  environment.5 The  project  is  aligned  with  the  India  country  partnership \nstrategy (CPS), 2009\u20132012. One of the four strategy pillars of the CPS is to support inclusive \nand environmentally sustainable growth through continued focus on infrastructure development \nand enhanced focus on renewable energy. The project is consistent with one key outcome \nindicator of the CPS, which targets an addition of at least 70 MW of solar power generation \nthrough ADB assistance by 2012.6  \n \n2.  Consistency with the Energy Policy and the Asia Solar Energy Initiative \n15.  Under ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, ADB\u2019s investments will focus on energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy projects, as well as expansion of energy access. The policy states that \nsupport for renewable energy projects will be prioritized and broadened, with an objective to \ncreate a framework that makes investing in renewable energy commercially viable. The policy \nenvisages that in the process of facilitating private investments in renewable energy, ADB will \nassume greater (but thoroughly assessed) risks and act as a catalyst for investments that the \nprivate sector might not otherwise be willing to make.7 \n \n16.  The project is also directly aligned with ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative, which aims to \n(i) facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer for solar power; (ii) help develop, finance, and \ncommission 3,000 MW of solar power generation capacity in developing member countries \n(DMCs) by May 2013; and (iii) pilot test innovative financing mechanisms and risk mitigation \nmeasures specifically for solar power. The initiative seeks to stimulate solar power development \nin DMCs with the goal of (i) increasing economies of scale to reduce costs and improve solar \nenergy\u2019s competitiveness within the grid; (ii) exploiting select DMCs\u2019 solar radiation resources to \nserve their fast-growing electricity demand and utilize their greater availability of land compared \nwith  most  developed  countries;  and  (iii)  promoting  DMCs\u2019  potential  to  become  global  and \nregional manufacturing hubs for solar technology goods and equipment. \n \n                                                 \n4  Average energy production per annum over the life of the project. \n5  ADB. 2008.

Energy Policy. Manila. \n ", "4  \n3.  Consistency with ADB Operations \n17.  The project strongly complements ADB\u2019s current initiatives in solar energy in India. In \nApril  2011,  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  Solar  Power  Generation  Guarantee \nFacility, which will issue partial credit guarantees in an aggregate principal amount of up to \n$150 million (or its equivalent in Indian rupees or other foreign currency acceptable to ADB), in \nfavor of foreign and local commercial financial institutions (partner commercial banks) lending to \nsolar  power  generation  projects  in  India.  The  facility  will  support  multiple  solar  generation \nprojects up to a maximum capacity of 25 MW under a solar power program with the central or \nstate governments. This facility will catalyze commercial lending and private investment for the \nsmaller solar generation projects, while the proposed project aims to catalyze private investment \nin larger solar generation projects with a capacity greater than 25 MW. This highlights ADB\u2019s \nmultiproduct approach to promote private investment in solar energy and its ability to customize \nbased on market needs and associated risks.  \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $147.5 million. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  Table 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.8 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements\nRegulatory framework  The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission has specified that all \ndistribution licensees in Maharashtra state will have to purchase 0.25% of their \ntotal electricity requirements from solar energy sources from FY2011 to FY2013. \nThis renewable purchase obligation increases to 0.50% beginning FY2014. \nImplementation period  The construction period is from September 2011 to March 2012. The term of the \nenergy purchase agreement is 25 years from COD. \nConstruction arrangements   \nEngineering, procurement,  On the basis of international competitive bidding, DSPPL has entered into a fixed \nand construction   price turnkey EPC contract with R-Infra for (i) procurement and supply of foreign \nand domestic equipment; and (ii) erection, construction, and services for the \nproject.  \nEquipment supplier  Under the EPC contract, R-Infra will source the cadmium telluride solar \nphotovoltaic modules from First Solar (USA).  \nOperations arrangements    \nRevenue structure  DSPPL has entered into an energy purchase agreement with R-Infra to sell 100% \nof the output of the project for a period of 25 years at a fixed tariff as specified by \nthe CERC RE Tariff guidelines 2009.  \nR-Infra distributes electricity to 2.8 million retail, commercial, and industrial \nconsumers in Mumbai. The electricity purchased from the project will be used by   \nR-Infra to offset its renewable purchase obligations stipulated by the Maharashtra \nElectricity Regulatory Commission. \nOperation and maintenance   \n                                                 \n8  Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "  5\nAspects  Arrangements\nDSPPL will enter into a suitable agreement for O&M of the plant. \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators will be reported by DSPPL and monitored by ADB and \nthe Export\u2013Import Bank of the United States. In addition, during the construction \nphase, ADB will appoint an independent lenders technical advisor to monitor \nprogress, attend performance testing, and certify COD. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COD = commercial operations date, DSPPL = Dahanu Solar Power Private Limited, \nEPC = engineering, procurement, and construction, FY = fiscal year, km = kilometer, kV = kilovolt, kWh = kilowatt-\nhour, O&M = operation and maintenance, R-Infra = Reliance Infrastructure Limited, USA = United States of America. \nSource: Dahanu Solar Power Private Limited. \n \nF.  Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n20.   The project is financially viable and is economically sustainable as the economic internal \nrate of return is higher than the social discount rate. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n21.  The proposed ADB loan of up to $48 million to DSPPL to finance the construction of the \nDahanu Solar Power Project will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without \ngovernment guarantee. The ADB loan will have a tenor of up to 17.5 years, including a grace \nperiod of up to 12 months and will be repaid semiannually. The ADB loan will carry an interest \nrate as well as other fees as approved by ADB\u2019s investment committee. \n   \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n22.  The proposed transaction merits ADB\u2019s assistance for the following reasons: \n(i)  The project will promote the efficient use of a relatively untapped, indigenous \nenergy  resource  resulting  in  low-cost,  carbon-efficient  electricity  generation. \nOnce commissioned, the project will be the largest solar photovoltaic project in \nIndia. \n(ii)  The proposed ADB assistance will provide long-term, limited recourse financing, \nwhich is not readily available for large solar power generation projects in India. \n(iii)  ADB participation in the project will help promote global standards for project \ndevelopment and due diligence in a nascent sector, thus enabling long-term \ncommercial financing for future solar power generation projects in India. \n \nC.  Risks  \n23.  Tariff  reset  risk.  The  tariff  is  established  in  the  energy  purchase  agreement  in \naccordance with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) renewable energy tariff \nregulations of 2009, which are in effect until 31 March 2012. In case COD is delayed beyond \n31 March 2012, the tariff will be determined by the new order passed by the CERC to extend \nthe tariff regulations beyond 31 March 2012. A lower tariff will reduce cash flows from the \nproject.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n ", "6  \n \n24.  Technology  risk.  Cadmium  telluride  is  a  proven  technology  that  has  been  in \ncommercial operation globally since 2002. However, its long term reliability has not yet been \nproven and the data evidencing long term degradation in performance is limited. Unique local \nconditions such as high ambient air temperatures and high levels of dust and soiling could \nimpair  module  performance.  The  performance  warranties  provided  by  First  Solar  and \nconservative forecast of energy yields mitigate this risk. The financial analysis has factored in \nthe loss in performance caused by high temperatures, soiling, and other factors. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n25.  Foreign  exchange  risk. The ADB loan will be denominated in US dollars, but the \nproject  revenues  will  be  in  Indian  rupees.  The  loan  documentation  will  specify  hedging \nstrategies to mitigate this risk. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n26.  Interconnection risk. DSPPL is responsible for constructing the 30 km, 220 kV double-\ncircuit transmission line from the project site to the Dechu substation of RVPNL. DSPPL is in the \nprocess of signing a grid connectivity agreement with RVPNL. A delay in construction of the \ntransmission lines will result in loss of revenue for the project. ADB will closely monitor the \ntransmission line construction progress during the implementation period. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n27.  Operation and maintenance risk. O&M for a solar photovoltaic plant is primarily limited \nto ensuring adequate cleaning of the panels and replacement of inverter components after \n10 years. Therefore, the O&M risk is not considered to be significant. After 5 years, the O&M \nactivities will be undertaken in-house by DSPPL. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE  \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions   \n28.  The project is classified under category B for environment, category B for involuntary \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous people under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n2009.  The  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  risks  of  the  project  have  been \nidentified and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts and to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy 2001 are incorporated \nin the safeguard reports and plans. The institutional capacity and commitment of DSPPL to \nmanage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  risks  are  deemed  adequate.  Information \ndisclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements.9 DSPPL will ensure that the project is in compliance with applicable national laws \nand  regulations  and  will  establish  and  maintain  appropriate  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards arrangements to manage impacts and risks, all in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement 2009 and Social Protection Strategy 2001. \n                                                 \n9  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  ", "  7\n \n29.   The project will be constructed on vacant and barren public land. The findings of the \nSocial Safeguards Compliance Audit show that there are no permanent or temporary dwellings \nor cultivation at the site. Initial survey of the 30 km transmission line right of way indicates that it \nwill pass through vacant public and private lands characterized predominantly by sandy dunes, \nlight vegetation and barren land. The route and location of the transmission towers has not been \nfinalized. Hence the project has been conservatively classified under category B for involuntary \nresettlement and a Resettlement Framework has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nrequirements. \n \n30.   Environmental impacts during construction such as dust and noise from transportation of \nmaterials and construction camps are likely to be short term and limited to the project site. \nImpacts during operations are expected to be minor and limited to soil quality, ecology and \noccupational health hazards. Impacts during decommissioning due to the dismantling of the \nsolar  modules  will  be  addressed  by  collection  and  recycling  of  the  solar  modules  by  the \nequipment supplier. \n \n31.   DSPPL and its contractors will enter into covenants in relation to core labor standards \nand formulate a corporate human  resources policy embodying this. Compliance with such \ncovenants will be monitored by DSPPL and included in the regular reporting. DSPPL has \nconducted consultations with various stakeholders including local villagers, village heads, non-\ngovernment organizations, and state officials. During project construction and the operations \nphase,  DSPPL  will  continue  such  consultations  and  promote  women\u2019s  participation  in \ncommunity development programs, which the project will jointly implement with the community \nas part of DSPPL\u2019s corporate social responsibility initiative. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n32.  DSPPL has been advised of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and its policy of implementing \ninternational best practices relating to the combating of money laundering and the financing of \nterrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  loan  documentation  includes  appropriate  anticorruption \nprovisions and remedies for ADB in the event of non-compliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n33.  The proposed loan is within the country, industry, group, and single project exposure \nlimits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nD.  Assurances \n34.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance  to  DSPPL.
