I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Highway Improvement \nProject.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Institutional \nStrengthening of Road Safety and Gender Equality, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, \nI, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will support capacity, quality, and safety improvements of the East\u2013West \nHighway (EWH), which is the main domestic and international trade corridor of Nepal, and which \nforms part of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) corridor 4 linking \nKathmandu to Dhaka and Chittagong through India.1 The project will (i) rehabilitate and widen \nabout 87 kilometers (km) of the EWH between Kanchanpur and Kamala in southeastern Nepal; \n(ii) improve road safety and gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) on the 1,027 km EWH; \nand (iii) strengthen the road safety and GESI capacity of road sector agencies. The project will \npromote economic growth and contribute to improving the competitiveness of Nepal\u2019s exporting \nindustries by enhancing the efficiency of the transport system, strengthening national and regional \nconnectivity, and improving the safety of the road network. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Context. Nepal is landlocked and bordered to the north by the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), and to the south, east, and west by India. Consequently, Nepal relies heavily on its direct \nneighbors for international trade\u2014particularly India, with which it shares 19 official trading posts. \nIn fiscal year (FY) 2017, 65% of Nepal\u2019s imports were from India, and 13% from the PRC; India \nreceived  57%  of  Nepal\u2019s  exports,  and  the  PRC  2.3%.  Biratnagar,  located  68  km  east  of \nKanchanpur, is Nepal\u2019s largest export gateway, handling 29.5% of its exports, while the port of \nKolkata is the primary transit point for seaborne freight. \n \n4.  Economic rationale. The gross domestic product of Nepal grew at an average annual \nrate of 4.5% during FY2007\u2013FY2017 and is forecast to grow at 5.9% in FY2018 and 5.5% in \nFY2019.2 The economy of Nepal suffers from a structural lack of competitiveness\u2014exports have \nalarmingly decreased at an average annual rate of 6.1% in real terms during FY2007\u2013FY2017, \nwhile the agriculture sector still employs 69.4% of the labor force. The trade deficit is widening, \nas foreign remittances have sustained import growth, which increased by 21.3% annually during \nFY2007\u2013FY2017.3  The  economy  is  hampered  by  deficient  domestic  and  cross-border \ninfrastructure networks, which increase transport costs and impede regional integration and trade \nwith indirect neighbors: excluding India, trade with other SASEC and SAARC member countries \naccounts for just 0.8% of Nepal\u2019s total trade.4 \n \n5.  Transport sector. Road transport carries over 90% of passengers and goods in Nepal. \nThe strategic road network (SRN) totals 12,494 km, 51% of which is paved, and is developed and \n                                                \n1  SAARC Secretariat. 2006.

Nepal Foreign Trade Statistics, Fiscal Year 2016/17. \nKathmandu. SASEC members are Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka; SAARC \ncomprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. ", "2 \nmaintained by the Department of Roads (DOR) of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and \nTransport (MOPIT). The SRN provides vital linkages to major economic centers and neighboring \ncountries, and features eight north\u2013south and three east\u2013west corridors, including the 1,027 km-\nlong EWH which carries the highest traffic volumes. The local road network totals 57,600 km, \n3.5% of which is paved. The road density of Nepal, at 2.5 km of road per 1,000 people, is low, \nand there are few alternatives to road transport.5 Although projects supported by development \npartners are expected to increase the capacity and density of airport, railway, and inland waterway \nnetworks, road transport will continue to have a major role in the economic development of Nepal.6 \n \n6.  Road safety. Vehicle ownership remains low, with only 0.08 vehicles per capita, but \nvehicle sales increased by 17.5% annually during FY2007\u2013FY2017, and the number of registered \nvehicles is expected to quadruple in the next decade.7 Motorcycles account for 79.7% of sales, \nwhich further increases road safety risks, particularly on deteriorated or wet pavements. The traffic \nfatality rate is estimated at 302 fatalities per 100,000 vehicles, one of the highest rates in Asia, \nand reported traffic accidents increased from 3,800 in FY2002 to 13,580 in FY2013.8 The \ngovernment responded by preparing a Road Safety Action Plan (2013\u20132020), but its effective \nimplementation requires broader institutional support and capacity strengthening, notably through \nthe operationalization of the road safety council. \n \n7.  Sector road map and regional cooperation. The development of the SRN is guided by \nNepal\u2019s National Transport Policy (2002), Priority Investment Plan (2007\u20132016), and MOPIT\u2019s 5-\nyear strategic plan.9 The road sector strategy of the Fourteenth Plan (FY2017\u2013FY2019) of the \ngovernment aims to (i) expand the SRN and improve interprovincial and national connectivity; (ii) \nstrengthen regional integration; (iii) reconstruct roads damaged by the April 2015 earthquake; (iv) \nprovide greater access to social services and markets; (v) improve road safety and maintenance; \nand (vi) support the development of the agriculture, industry, energy, and tourism sectors.10 The \nallocation for capital expenditures increased from 22.7% of the government\u2019s budget in FY2015 \nto 27.1% in FY2019 to support these objectives. The road sector strategy is aligned with regional \npolicies, including SASEC objectives of facilitating trade and improving access to national and \ntransnational markets via development of multimodal transport systems.11 \n \n8.  Project design. The project road carries an average annual daily traffic of 8,590 vehicles, \nincluding about 28% of heavy vehicles, and this total is forecasted to increase to 25,400 vehicles \nby 2033. The pavement is in fair to poor condition, and the road does not segregate slow-moving \nvehicles and pedestrians. Through the project, the road will be upgraded to a four-lane dual \ncarriageway to cater to the projected increase in traffic demand, and rehabilitated with improved \npavement,  drainage,  structures,  and  safety features.  Service  lanes  in  populated  areas  will \nimprove  safety,  particularly  for  pedestrians,  and  bicycle  and  motorcycle  users.  Civil  works \ncontracts will include a performance-based maintenance period of 5 years after completion of \nconstruction. The project will support economic growth by (i) rehabilitating deteriorated road \n                                                \n5  This compares with 12.2 km of road per 1,000 people in Bhutan, 4.1 km in India, and 5.5 km in Sri Lanka. \n6  The railway network is small (59 km). During 2011\u20132016, (i) international air travel increased by 5.4% annually, from \n2.70 million to 3.51 million passengers, but capacity constraints at the only international airport in Kathmandu impede \ngrowth; and (ii) domestic air travel increased by 2.0% annually, from 1.59 million to 1.76 million passengers. \n7  Vehicle ownership in India is about 0.42 vehicles per capita, and 0.80 vehicles per capita in the United States. \n8  World Health Organization. 2015.

ADB\u2019s interventions. The project is consistent with the objectives set out in the country \npartnership strategy, and is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations \nbusiness plan for Nepal, 2018\u20132020 and SASEC\u2019s operational plan 2016\u20132025.12 ADB has \nprovided ongoing assistance for the development of the strategic road sector through (i) a project \napproved in 2016 for $186.8 million for the rehabilitation and upgrading of 114 km of the EWH to \nthe west of Narayanghat,13 (ii) three projects approved during 2010\u20132015 for a total of $324 million \nfor the reconstruction of other major roads of the SRN, and (iii) a project preparatory facility \napproved in 2010 for $12 million.14 The project incorporates lessons from previous projects, \nnotably related to procurement, project readiness, land acquisition, and sustainability.15 ADB\u2019s \nassistance is expected to continue beyond the project, and a consulting services package will be \nprovided under the loan to prepare the detailed design for the remaining sections of the EWH to \nthe east of Narayanghat, proposed for subsequent projects. \n \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB\u2019s value addition includes improved road design \nfor climate change adaptation, and improved road safety and maintenance planning capacity. The \nattached TA will strengthen the road safety and GESI capacity of MOPIT and DOR at policy, \nmanagement, and operational levels, and improve the facilities and project readiness of the \nProject Directorate (ADB) of DOR. The national road safety policy will be reviewed, and a road \nsafety assessment conducted for the 1,027 km-long EWH corridor. Civil works and equipment \npackages provided under the loan will help mitigate road accident blackspots. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) transport connectivity within Nepal \nand  with  neighboring  countries  improved  (footnote  10),  and  (ii)  physical  connectivity  and \nmultimodal linkages for land-based transport along major trade routes enhanced (footnote 11). \nThe project outcome will be: efficiency and safety of the road transport system improved.16 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output 1: Road network upgraded and maintained. The loan will rehabilitate and \nupgrade about 87 km of road between Kanchanpur and Kamala on the EWH to a four-lane \nstandard, and include a 5-year performance-based maintenance period following construction. \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2017.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  Engineering designs of the project road were prepared by DOR in accordance with Asian \nHighway  Class  1  standard,  and  aimed  to  improve  road  safety  and  geometry,  avoid  land \nacquisition, and minimize social and environmental impacts. The project road will be widened \nfrom two to four lanes, and the completed road will have a design speed of 100 km per hour, dual \ncarriageways separated by a 3.0 meters median, 3.0 meters shoulders on both sides, and new \npavements. The project will integrate safe and socially inclusive design features, such as 42 km \nof footpaths, 69 km of service lanes segregating slow-moving vehicles, 46 disabled-friendly \npedestrian crossings, 92 sheltered bus stops, and reflective lane markers. \n \n22.  The project road is in a tropical climate zone with moderate to high rainfall, and in a seismic \narea with comparatively lower risk than other areas of Nepal. Increased temperatures are the \nmain climate risk in southeastern Nepal, with temperatures forecast to increase by an average of \n1.2\u00b0C\u20131.7\u00b0C during 2019\u20132050. Engineering designs also integrate climate adaptation measures \nto  minimize  climate  change  risks,  including  bioengineering  techniques,  and  increased \nembankment and bridge heights, and increased cross-drainage specifications. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic viability. The economic evaluation of the project was conducted in accordance \nwith ADB guidelines by comparing life cycle economic costs and benefits in with- and without- \nproject scenarios, using a 9.0% discount rate and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as \ndecision criteria.23 The highway development model 4 (HDM-4) was used to estimate road agency \nand road user costs based on input data on traffic; road geometry; pavement condition; and \nmaintenance, improvement, and operating costs. Project benefits include savings associated with \n                                                \n20 Such as international road assessment program (iRAP) or other data- or evidence-based framework. \n21 Government of Nepal, MOPIT. 2017.

Financial sustainability. The project is not revenue-generating. The Roads Board of \nNepal funds maintenance from allocations of the Ministry of Finance and from toll revenues. The \nannual budget for the maintenance of the SRN increased from NRs2.61 billion in FY2012 to \nNRs5.50 billion in FY2019 in nominal terms, equal to an annual growth of 4.7% in real terms. The \naverage  annual  incremental  recurrent  costs  of  the  project  are  estimated  at  1.1%  of  the \nmaintenance budget of DOR, and it is thus reasonable to expect that the budget allocation of \nDOR will be able to meet the incremental maintenance costs of the project, particularly as the \nEWH is the main trade corridor of Nepal. Civil works contracts include 5 years of performance-\nbased maintenance after construction; this will promote maintenance in the initial operating \nphase. The project management unit will also engage a consultant to strengthen road asset \nmanagement. The project will thus improve DOR\u2019s asset management capacity, and promote \nprivate sector participation in the maintenance of the project road with the supervision of DOR. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Institutional capacity. The 2015 Constitution introduced three tiers of government. \nAssociated legal, institutional, financial, and administrative procedures are still being finalized, but \nhighways will remain a federal responsibility, under MOPIT and DOR. The Project Directorate \n(ADB) of DOR, which handles project management for ADB strategic road sector projects, has \ngood technical capacity and significant experience implementing ADB projects. Its project director \nreports to the director general of DOR, who in turn reports to the Secretary of MOPIT. The capacity \nof DOR will be strengthened by consulting service contracts for detailed design and construction \nsupervision, which include training in design, contract management, and quality assurance. \n \n26.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  risk  is  moderate,  as  DOR  has \nadequate  capacity  in  accounting  and  ADB  disbursement  procedures.  All  transactions  are \nrecorded by government accounting systems, reflected in the government accounts, and subject \nto statutory audit by the comptroller. The project management unit prepares annual project \nfinancial statements for development partner projects, which are subject to audit by the Nepal \nOffice of the Auditor General. Improvements are required in internal audit, accounting systems, \nand staff understanding of ADB policies and procedures. The project will engage a full-time \nfinancial expert to conduct internal checks and controls, and improve the integration of project \naccounting with DOR\u2019s financial management information systems. \n \n27.  Procurement. Procurement and consultant recruitment will be conducted in accordance \nwith the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The amended Public \nProcurement Act (2017) and Public Procurement Regulations (2017) of Nepal are generally \nacceptable to ADB and encompass best international procurement practices. Department of \nRoads  has  significant  experience  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement  requirements,  and  the  project \nprocurement risk is moderate. All consulting firms will be using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. Advance actions for the recruitment of \nconstruction supervision consultants started in May 2018, and for the recruitment of detailed \ndesign consultants in July 2018. Invitation for bids for the civil works packages of the project road \nwas published in September 2018. \n ", "8 \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOPIT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  Poverty. The direct area of influence of the project includes 522,206 residents living in 12 \nmunicipalities crossed by the project road in two districts. About 36.5% of residents live below the \nnational poverty standard line, above the national average of 25.2%. The major income sources \nare remittances (47%), trade (20%), agriculture (13%), and services (9%). Access to modern \nsanitation (48%) and piped water (10%) remains limited. The project is expected to improve \naccess to economic opportunities and social services, reduce intraregional disparities, and create \nan estimated 4.43 million person-days of skilled and unskilled employment during construction. \n \n30.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A poverty and social \nanalysis assessed the socioeconomic characteristics of 2,479 women. The mobility of women in \nthe project area is primarily limited to visiting nearby markets, district health and administrative \nservices, and relatives. Walking is the predominant mode of transport, while buses are also used \nby about 70% of women and biking is popular among schoolgirls. Gender benefits of the project \ninclude  improved  public  transport  accessibility,  improved  access  to  services  and  markets, \nimproved safety of the urban environment, and specific activities included in a gender action plan: \n(i) pedestrian-friendly design features for the project road, (ii) gender-friendly features for the \ndesign of service areas along the EWH, (iii) a pilot capacity-building program for women\u2019s groups \nin the project area, (iv) gender targets in construction activities and tree plantation, (v) gender \ntargets in the awareness campaigns conducted under the project, and (vi) implementation of the \nGESI operational guidelines.24 Gender, social development, livelihood restoration, and road \nsafety awareness experts will be hired to implement the gender action plan. \n \n31.  HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Nepal is low, with a \nrate of 0.2% in the population aged 15\u201349.25 About 28 cases of HIV/AIDS were recorded in the \ndistricts affected by the project. Human trafficking is an important problem in Nepal, with an \nestimated 5,957 cases of abducted persons in FY2016 (80% involving women and children). \nWhile the project will facilitate cross-border movements of people and require an important labor \nforce, it will widen an existing corridor and is thus not expected to contribute to a significant \nincrease in HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The GESI action plan includes the recruitment of a \nspecialized  nongovernment  organization  to  conduct  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking \nprevention awareness campaign along the road corridor. The contractors will further conduct \nHIV/AIDS awareness sessions and provide voluntary testing and guidance to their workforce. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.26 \n \n33.  Environment (category B). The project road will be constructed in the existing right-of-\nway and does not pass through or near protected areas. The environmental impacts of the project \nroad and the Project Directorate (ADB) building are not expected to be significant and irreversible, \n                                                \n24 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Government of Nepal, Ministry of Health and Education. 2014.

Other anticipated impacts involve dust, \nnoise, exhaust, construction and domestic waste, water contamination, occupational health and \nsafety, erosion, siltation, traffic congestion during construction, and air pollution during operation. \nInitial environmental examinations for the two subprojects were disclosed on the ADB website in \nJuly  2018,  and  include  environmental  management  plans  providing  mandatory  mitigation \nmeasures  to  be  implemented  by  contractors.  Concerns  voiced  by  affected  persons  and \nstakeholders during project preparation were incorporated in the design, and a grievance redress \nmechanism will alleviate concerns during implementation. About 5,600 trees will need to be \nremoved and a compensatory afforestation program will be implemented, with a ratio of 25 \nsaplings planted for each felled tree. \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project requires no land acquisition and has \nmoderate resettlement impacts. Of 479 affected households (2,492 persons), 25 households (130 \npersons) will be significantly affected, and will have to rebuild their residence or commercial \nstructure outside the corridor of impact. Project impacts will otherwise be mostly minor on 454 \nnon-titled households (2,362 persons), including 205 households (43%) that need to relocate \nmoveable commercial kiosks. Only 25% of surveyed affected households are vulnerable. Other \nimpacts include partial impacts to commercial structures (43%) and impacts on fruit trees (15%); \n125 community structures will have to be rebuilt, including tube wells and other government \nstructures (52%), resting places (30%), and temples (18%). \n \n35.  A resettlement plan was prepared for the project road and disclosed on the ADB website \nin June 2018.27 The entitlement matrix provided under the resettlement plan includes mitigation \nmeasures and resettlement assistance commensurate with the project impacts; incorporates \nlessons from previous projects; and provides compensation at replacement cost for structures \nand trees, shifting and reconstruction assistance, and shifting and loss of income allowance for \nmoveable kiosks. It also includes special measures for significantly affected households that must \nrebuild their commercial structure or residence, including (i) financial assistance for temporary \nloss of income and subsistence allowance, and (ii) additional financial assistance and skill \nenhancement training for vulnerable households. Due diligence for the resettlement impacts of \nthe Project Directorate (ADB) office was carried out and disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project road does not cross traditional customary \nor tribal lands. The social impact assessment established that only 45 indigenous households are \ndirectly affected by the project, representing 10% of affected households; their socioeconomic \ncharacteristics are similar to those of the wider society, and they are well integrated, will not be \nimpacted differently, and will benefit equally from the project. \n \n37.  Implementation. Implementation of the environmental safeguards and resettlement plan \nwill be overseen by DOR. The Project Directorate (ADB) will be supported by resettlement and \nenvironment specialists in guiding and reviewing the implementation of safeguard plans and \ndocumentation. The construction supervision consultant will include a team of environmental, \ngender, resettlement, social experts, and field mobilizers to assist DOR in implementing and \nmonitoring safeguard and GESI activities. Contractors will be required to have environmental, \nhealth,  and  safety  officers  to  ensure  the  environmental  management  plan  is  properly \nimplemented.  The  government  will  finance  and  implement  environmental  and  resettlement \nactivities. Detailed implementation arrangements are in the PAM. \n \n                                                \n27 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n38.
