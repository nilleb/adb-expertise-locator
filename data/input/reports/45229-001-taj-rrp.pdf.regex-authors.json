I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Access to Green Finance Project. The report also describes \nproposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  for  Access  to  Green  Finance,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the \nproposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will leverage Tajikistan\u2019s sound microfinance system to provide credit for \nhouseholds  for  energy-efficient  and  environment-friendly  homes.1The  JFPR  TA  grant  of \n$750,000 will build the capacity of participating microfinance institutions (MFIs) and the project \nmanagement unit (PMU) to facilitate efficient green finance intermediation and promote energy \nefficiency, particularly for rural households and women. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Energy challenges coupled with inefficient energy environment. Tajikistan depends \non hydroelectric sources for 98% of its electricity needs. In summer, when demand is low but \nglacial melt is high, there is an electricity surplus. In winter, since rivers freeze, hydroelectric \npower generation declines by 50%. This results in power outages of up to 18\u201320 hours per day \nduring winter in grid-connected areas. The situation is worse for the 24,000 households located \nin remote off-grid areas. Over 73% of the population lives in rural areas2 and spends much of \nthe winter with limited electricity, with lighting and heating in short supply.3 In addition, more than \n50% (over 500,000 households) of the country\u2019s housing units were built in the 1960 and 1970s. \nMany of these homes are in rural areas, and their residents include a large number of the 46.7% \nof families who live below the poverty line.4 These homes need improvements to increase \nenergy efficiency and reduce household spending on fossil fuels.5  \n \n4.  The  problem  of  energy  poverty  is  complicated  by  inefficient  energy  transmission \nconsumption,  and  inadequate  household  understanding  about  how  to  use  energy  in  cost-\neffective, environmentally friendly ways.6 The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nestimates that the country\u2019s total energy bill was about $1 billion in 2008, which amounted to \n20% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product that year.7 This leaves insufficient energy for other \nproductive investment activities, limiting economic growth potential. Rural households depend \non fuels such as kerosene, diesel, gasoline, firewood, coal, and manure for their energy needs. \nWomen in these households spend a significant amount of time gathering firewood. Use of \n                                                \n1  Subborrowers at household level may include individuals doing microbusiness activities.  \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2012.

Families are \nunaware of available options to lower energy costs and improve household living conditions. \n \n5.  Pilot interventions by other donors. German development cooperation through GIZ \nand Habitat for Humanity have undertaken pilot projects for green finance. The Warm Comfort \nprogram implemented by GIZ has installed thermal insulation and energy-efficient solutions in \nabout 200 households in the Gorno-Badakshan region.8 In this program, home improvement \nsolutions for energy efficiency were manufactured and supplied by local cooperatives.9 The \nHabitat for Humanity program for home energy efficiency improvements collaborates with two \nMFIs\u2014IMON and Arvand\u2013\u2013for household loans to cover costs for energy-efficient roofing and \nother carpentry works (doors, windows, flooring). The program has so far reached over 6,000 \nhouseholds since 2011. Key lessons learned from both projects are that (i) home improvements \nreduce heating requirements up to 40%, resulting to energy savings; (ii) strengthening public \nawareness of energy efficiency and better energy consumption patterns are necessary; and (iii) \nMFIs\u2019 credit assessment capacity for home improvement loan clients must be strengthened. \nBoth pilot projects cannot expand due to lack of funds, particularly in local currency. \n \n6.  Need to scale up and expand pilot interventions. Although small-scale interventions \nhave been initiated by these donors, more than 50% of the country\u2019s households are still in \nneed of home improvements for energy efficiency or off-grid clean power generation. A larger-\nscale intervention with a focus on energy efficiency and environment-friendly solutions\u2014smart \ngreen energy solutions (SGES)\u2014can help address the energy challenges that Tajikistan faces. \nThe proposed project will engage the country\u2019s microfinance system to provide affordable credit \nfor SGES.10 SGES can decrease energy consumption by 15%\u201350%, enabling these households \nto consume less fossil fuel.11 A household survey commissioned by the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  also  indicated  potential  demand  for  solar  SGES,  with  48%  of  households \nexpressing interest in acquiring a solar SGES. 12 Some 91% of these households indicated that \nthey would borrow to purchase solar SGES if loans were available.13 \n \n7.  Provision of better financial access to smart green energy solutions. The project \nwill address the two key barriers limiting effective demand: lack of affordable financing, and \ninsufficient buyer and lender awareness about SGES. The project will provide loans through \nselected MFIs to households and micro entrepreneurs to purchase and install affordable SGES. \nInnovative  promotion  and  delivery  mechanisms  will  be  used  to  help  make  SGES  widely \n                                                \n8  The Warm Comfort program partnered with a microfinance institution, Madina, in the Gorno-Badakhshan region. \n9  GIZ confirmed that local cooperatives are fully operational and making sustainable profits. \n10 For the purpose of this project, SGES are defined as products acquired by households that improve household \nenergy efficiency, or that consume energy more efficiently than existing products, or that generate energy utilizing \nan  environment-friendly  technology.  The  Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2) contains a nonexclusive list of these products that includes energy-efficient roofs and \ndoors, double-glazed windows, advanced water pumps, solar water heaters, and systems generating electricity by \nsolar power. The list will be amended from time to time by agreement between ADB and the government, including \nfollowing the introduction of new technologies or in response to requests by MFIs participating in the project. \n11 Initial List of Smart Green Energy Solutions Products (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nA household survey showed that about 30% of off-grid households currently use diesel generators. They would \nbenefit from solar home solutions, as the operation and maintenance cost is lower than generators. Twenty percent \nof households that currently use firewood and coal for heating purposes expressed interest in credit to purchase \nsolar water heaters, which can be used year-round and have low operation and maintenance expenses. \n12 Tajikistan\u2019s geography and high horizontal solar irradiance (4 kilowatt hours per square meter per day) are \nparticularly suited for harnessing solar energy solutions, especially in off-grid areas. Solar solutions can include \nsolar panel-based electrification solutions and other solar products. \n13 ADB undertook a survey of 560 households in April\u2013May 2012 in on-grid and off-grid areas of 15 districts in \nTajikistan, which found that expenditure for kerosene, diesel, propane, wood, coal, manure, and candles for \nlighting, heating, and cooking needs averaged $200 per annum. \n ", "3 \nacceptable and affordable to low-income households.14 The MFI support will include capacity \nbuilding and technical advice to MFIs and their clients from SGES experts and engineers who \nwill complete needs assessments, discuss options, and advise on SGES loan structuring. \n \n8.  The cost of SGES varies widely. For example, a small household may be able to replace \nall of its incandescent lightbulbs with more energy-efficient bulbs for less than $100. However, \nthe cost of other SGES is several multiples of the average monthly income of low-income Tajik \nhouseholds. Many SGES are unaffordable if they must be paid up front, but are feasible for \nfamilies if credit is made available on reasonable terms and tenor. To achieve meaningful \nhousehold  energy  savings,  complementary  SGES  products  can  be  bundled  together.  For \nexample, a household renovation may include energy-efficient roofs, double-glazed windows, \ninsulated doors, and insulated ceilings and floors. High-cost SGES (such as energy-efficient \nwater pumps) may be shared by multiple households borrowing from an MFI as a group. SGES \nloan size per product financed under the project is expected to range from $200 to $5,000 \nequivalent to accommodate ranges of household income and SGES preferences.15 \n \n9.  Sustainable green finance. During the project, the MFIs will borrow from a Green \nFinance Fund set up by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) with an $8.8 million grant provided by \nADB for the credit line. The credit line will be lent by the MOF to MFIs under subsidiary loans \nwith subsidiary loan interest and principal repayments being revolved on a perpetual basis \nduring and after the project\u2019s implementation period. The Green Finance Fund will provide credit \nline support to MFIs for energy efficiency initiatives. The project\u2019s credit lines to MFIs will be in \nlocal currency with 5-year duration. This will help MFI borrowers without exposing them to \ncurrency risk, as well as provide longer-term liquidity to MFIs. By taking loans to invest in \nhousehold energy efficiency, clients will experience measurable savings in energy expenses. \nThis will help people understand the benefits of energy efficiency investments. \n \n10.  The project aims to support commercial viability for SGES. This approach is recognized \nas an important component of the government\u2019s strategy to provide a sustainable energy-\nefficient environment.16 Pilot interventions (para. 5) have helped develop supplier capacity to \nmeet market demand. Once the commercial viability of green finance is proven, MFIs and banks \nwill use their own capital to finance SGES acquisition by households and businesses.  \n \n11.  The project will help strengthen MFI lending for energy-efficient products, supporting MFI \nportfolio diversification strategies. MFIs that are interested in developing or expanding their \nSGES loan portfolios must meet the eligibility criteria agreed by the MOF and ADB (para. 20).17 \nMFIs  selected for  the project  will  benefit from knowledge  and  capacity  building for  SGES \nproduct  lending,  strengthening  of  client  selection  and  portfolio  management,  and  public \ninformation campaigns.  \n \n12.  Benefits to women. The project will have significant benefits for women. Introducing \nSGES such as energy-efficient cooking stoves, heating units and solar water heaters, and water \npurifiers will reduce time spent in gathering firewood and other fuels for cooking, heating, and \nsafe drinking water, and increase women\u2019s borrowing options.18 SGES enables better house-\n                                                \n14 A previous ADB project was instrumental in the creation of a sound microfinance system in Tajikistan.

Private sector development. Although nascent, a few SGES solutions are currently \nassembled and manufactured locally through local cooperatives and skilled workers. By making \ncredit and information available, the project will help create more effective demand. This will \nstimulate growth in SGES production and trade. To ensure that the quality and service being \ndelivered by the private sector meet appropriate technical standards, the project will provide \ninternational and national experts to help set and prioritize quality benchmarks and facilitate \nlocal cooperative links with other institutions that have relevant experience and knowledge. \n \n14.  Environmental, social, and other benefits. Use of SGES will result in improved local \nenvironmental and health benefits for rural households by substituting fossil and wood fuels with \nclean alternatives or by lowering the volumes of fossil and wood fuels used. These benefits \ninclude  reduced  exposure  to  indoor  air  pollution,  reduced  pressure  on  forestry  and  coal \nresources  to  meet  household  heating  and  cooking  needs,  and  reduced  greenhouse  gas \nemissions. Other benefits include reduced time spent by households to purchase, transport, and \nstore diesel, kerosene, coal, and wood in remote areas for power generation, heating, and \ncooking; improved education opportunities for children during dark hours; and less eye strain as \na result of better household lighting.19 The project will enable (i) reduction of carbon emissions, \n(ii)  support  for  the  development  of  supply  chains  for  SGES,  and  (iii)  demonstration  of \nhouseholds\u2019 willingness to pay for energy solutions, thereby providing a baseline for pricing \nenergy produced by the formal power network.20 \n \n15.  Strategic fit and lessons. The project is consistent with the government\u2019s development \nobjectives and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which promotes inclusive and environmentally sustainable \ngrowth. 21 The project is included in the country operations business plan22 and will help develop \nTajikistan\u2019s private sector, which is a key component of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \n(footnote 16). The project also supports ADB\u2019s Energy for All Initiative to develop innovative \napproaches to affordable, modern, clean energy and to scale up the use of energy-efficient \nproducts for poor households.23 The project reflects good design practice shown in an earlier \nmicrofinance project in Tajikistan, particularly simplicity of design, involvement of more than one \nMFI in the project, and significant capacity building elements.

Investment and Financing Plans \n18.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $10 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project.24 The project is estimated to cost $11.12 million \nequivalent (Table 1).

Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The MOF will be the executing agency. The PMU under the MOF will establish a Green \nFinance Fund26 in a commercial bank acceptable to the MOF and ADB will lend $8.8 million \nequivalent in somoni to eligible MFIs for tenors of 5 years, at an interest rate equal to the \nNational Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) refinancing rate,27 for onlending to subborrowers. \n \n20.  To be eligible to participate, an MFI must (i) comply with capital adequacy requirements \nand other prudential requirements established by the NBT; (ii) have a ratio of equity to total \nassets of not less than 12%; (iii) have a ratio of return on assets greater than zero; (iv) have a \nratio of return on equity of not less than 10%; (v) have a ratio of intermediation costs of less than \n33%; (vi) have a portfolio at risk over 30 days of less than 5%; (vii) have a write-off ratio of less \nthan 5%; (viii) have corporate, financial, management, and governance practices acceptable to \nADB and the MOF; (ix) have satisfied ADB's integrity, anti-money-laundering, and counter-\nfinancing of terrorism due diligence requirements; and (x) have a demonstrated presence in low \nincome urban and rural areas. An MFI that fails to meet one or two of criteria (ii)\u2013(vii) but still \nhas strong implementation capabilities may be considered for participation if it submits an action \nplan to overcome the deficiency, as long as it complies with all other criteria. MFIs will also be \nrequired to submit audited financial statements for the 2 years prior to entering into a subloan \nagreement. \n \n21.  The MOF will enter into subsidiary loan agreements with the selected MFIs and ADB will \nenter  into  project  agreements  with  the  same  MFIs.  MFIs  will  make  loans  to  creditworthy \nhouseholds for the purchase and installation of SGES. These subloans to MFI borrowers, which \nwill be denominated in somoni in principal amounts of up to $5,000 equivalent for tenors of up to \n5 years, will bear interest at rates determined by the MFIs. The MOF will recycle the interest and \nprincipal payments made by MFIs back to the same or different eligible MFIs to enable them to \nmake additional loans for SGES.  \n \n22.  Due diligence was conducted on four MFIs that expressed interest in receiving credit \nlines under the project: Arvand, Humo, IMON International, and Oxus. All four met the agreed \nupon eligibility criteria.28 The government, with ADB concurrence, has selected the two that \nhave existing SGES loan products\u2014Arvand and IMON International\u2014to receive 20% of the total \n                                                \n26 Green Finance Fund is the title of the imprest account for the credit line to MFIs. \n27 This rate is currently 6.5%. The interest rate on the subloans to MFIs will be reset annually based on NBT\u2019s then-\ncurrent refinancing rate. \n28  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \ncredit line amount (10% each). The remaining 80% will be allocated by the PMU, subject to ADB \nconcurrence, to selected and eligible MFIs that express interest in participating in the project.29 \n \n23.  The  MOF,  as  the  executing  agency,  has  created  the  PMU  to  monitor  the  project \ndeliverables  in  consultation  with  ADB.  The  MOF  will  also  establish  a  steering  committee \ncomprising key agencies including the NBT, the Ministry of Energy and Industry, and other \nrelevant stakeholders, to facilitate successful project implementation.30 This steering committee \nwill meet semiannually to review the project\u2019s progress and advise on policy matters. In a key \ninnovation, the PMU will manage funds for three ADB projects with microfinance components \n(the Access to Green Finance Project, the Rural Development Project,31 and the proposed \nBuilding Climate Resilience in the Pyanj River Basin Project) on a cost-sharing basis and \ndevelop skills to operate as a long-term, self-sustaining fund. MFIs will be the implementing \nagencies for the credit line component. Each MFI will establish a project implementation unit \n(PIU) adequately staffed and acceptable to ADB, as agreed with the MOF. Implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration \nmanual (footnote 29). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2013\u2013December 2018  \nEstimated project completion date  31 December 2018 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  MOF \n(ii)  Key implementing agencies  MFIs  \n(iii) Implementation units  PIUs established by each MFI, 3\u20134 staff each \nProcurement  Shopping              Multiple contracts       $133,000 \nConsulting Services  National\u2013ICS        756 person-months     $  4  6  6  , 8  0  0     \n  National\u2013LCS       Lump-suma  $  75,000 \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended \nfrom time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed upon \nbetween the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, LCS = least cost selection, MFI = \nmicrofinance  institution,  MOF  =  Ministry  of  Finance,  PIU  =  project  implementation  unit,  PMU = project \nmanagement unit. \na For project audit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n24.  Procurement waiver. In light of Tajikistan\u2019s extensive trade with non-ADB members and \nthe relatively small size of individual SGES purchases from many different suppliers, it will be \ndifficult and expensive for MFIs to ensure that all procurement of equipment and goods by \nsubborrowers originates in ADB member countries. For example, many energy-efficient wooden \ndoors and windows manufactured in Tajikistan (including those made by suppliers in GIZ\u2019s \nproject)  are  made  using  timber  sourced  from  non-ADB  countries  (principally  the  Russian \nFederation) because regionally grown timber is not of sufficient quality. Accordingly, approval \nfrom ADB\u2019s Board of Directors is requested for procurement by subborrowers of equipment and \ngoods from non-member countries using the proceeds of the grant used for the credit line \n                                                \n29  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 The steering committee composition will be amended from time to time through a mutual agreement between the \nMOF and ADB during project implementation. \n31 ADB. 2005.

Manila.  \n ", "8 \nonly.32 The Board approved similar waivers for other projects in which credit lines were provided \nto  financial  intermediaries  located  in  developing  member  countries  in  Central  Asia \n(i.e., Armenia, Kazakhstan, and the Kyrgyz Republic).33 \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n25.  The JFPR will provide TA equivalent to $750,000 on a grant basis to be administered by \nADB. The MOF will be the executing agency. The TA will have a 5-year implementation period. \nThe TA grant will help improve stakeholders\u2019 capacity to implement the project and enhance the \nproject\u2019s sustainability. The impact will be increased access to green finance. The TA will have \nthree  outputs:  (i)  PMU  capacity  strengthened,  (ii)  public  awareness  campaign  on  SGES \ndeveloped and implemented, and (iii) an enabling market and financing framework for SGES \ndeveloped.  A gender-sensitive  community  public  awareness  campaign  will  disseminate the \ntechnical features and benefits of SGES. The PMU, MFIs, and other project stakeholders will be \nempowered to sustain the green finance market beyond the project implementation period. \n \n26.   ADB  will  select  individuals  and  a firm for  consulting  services  to  provide  a  total of \n85 person-months\u2019 consultancy (comprising 66 person-months\u2019 national and 19 person-months\u2019 \ninternational consultancy). The firm consultant selection shall be by quality- and cost-based \nselection,  and  both  the  firm  and  individuals  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA resources \nwill be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Goods and works will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic  \n27.  In addition to financial and economic benefits to households, this project will result in \npositive benefits to the Tajikistan economy as a result of more efficient energy consumption. \nThese benefits have been estimated and verified based on field experience of similar projects \nimplemented by GIZ and other donor organizations in Tajikistan. The cost\u2013benefit analysis \nestimates the project\u2019s economic internal rate of return at 16%. Sensitivity analysis showed that \nincreased costs and reduced benefits have low impact on the project\u2019s economic returns.34 \n \nB.  Financial and Governance \n28.  Financial management, governance, and integrity due diligence was conducted on four \npotential participating MFIs (para. 22) to ensure market capacity to engage in the project. All \nfour MFIs satisfied ADB\u2019s minimum requirements. They have in place acceptable checks and \nbalances  in the  credit approval  and  treasury functions,  as  well  as  robust  internal  auditing \nprocedures. Their audited financial statements are prepared and audited by reputable audit \n                                                \n32 The Board of Directors must approve the waiver by a vote representing not less than two-thirds of the total voting \npower of the members of the Board. \n33 ADB. 2012.

It  will  be  a  condition  of \ndisbursement of credit line funds to MFIs that adequate anti-money-laundering and counter-\nterrorism financing customer due diligence measures are in place. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 29). \n \n30.  The PMU will prepare and maintain financial statements required by ADB and will have \nthem audited in a timely manner by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. Except as \nprovided in para. 24, all procurement financed by the grant will be in accordance with applicable \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n31.  Tajikistan is among the poorest countries in Central Asia, with 47% of the population \nliving below the national poverty line and 73.5% of the population living in rural areas. Many of \nthe rural poor depend on remittances sent by their male family members from abroad. Tajikistan \nhas a high percentage of households headed by women (20%) because of high numbers of \nwidows from the country's civil war and significant male outmigration. Households experience \nunreliable energy supply, especially in winter. The sample survey showed that both female- and \nmale-headed households are equally interested in SGES and are willing to borrow for SGES. \nThe project will address issues of insufficient knowledge by women, affordability of SGES \ninvestment,  and  improvements  in  livelihoods  through  cost-conscious  SGES  options, \nmicrofinance lending to women, capacity building for all stakeholders, and public information \ncampaigns. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n32.  ADB will work closely with the MOF and the MFIs to ensure that subloans will comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \n33.  The  project  conforms  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  complies  with \nTajikistan\u2019s labor, environment, health, safety, and social laws and regulations. The project falls \nunder the financial intermediation category with respect to environmental and social safeguards \nand is treated as C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples \nsubcategories. It will have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts or risks and will not \ngenerate involuntary resettlement impacts or impacts on indigenous peoples within the meaning \nof the Safeguard Policy Statement. Only subprojects classified category C for environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples will be financed using funds obtained under \nthe project\u2019s subloans. The prohibited investment activity list in the Safeguard Policy Statement \nwill apply. In addition, MFIs whose business activities involve adverse environmental or social \nimpacts  will  be  ineligible  to  participate.  Before  receiving  its  first  disbursement  under  the \nproposed project, each MFI will be required to establish a basic environmental and social \nsafeguards management system with acceptable screening mechanisms.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  The summary of risks and mitigating measures is provided in Table 4.  \n   \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nSummary Risks  Mitigating Measures \nMacroeconomic Risks   \n1.  High capital cost of imported  Some SGES are made locally, which reduces the risk of price \nequipment and spare parts due  increases due to currency devaluation. Increased development \nto devaluation  of local SGES manufacturers should moderate cost increases.  \n2.  Affordability problem due to  MFIs  will  work  with  technology  partners,  such  as  those \nhigh interest rates on loans for  developed by GIZ and Habitat for Humanity, to manage costs; \nSGES  MFIs and the JFPR TA will help households understand and \nprioritize their SGES needs; local currency credit lines to multiple \nMFIs will improve affordability. \nInformation Asymmetry Risks   \n3.  Lack of knowledge about  Increased public awareness campaigns and capacity building of \nSGES  MFIs and their clients will increase knowledge of the costs and \nbenefits of SGES. \nBusiness Risks   \n4.  Poor quality SGES  The project will only include SGES products that meet high-\nquality technical standards developed with assistance provided \nunder the JFPR TA. MFIs will work with clients and monitor \nselected SGES installations to ensure product quality and use. \n5.  MFI default risk  Extensive financial due diligence will be performed on MFIs that \napply and are selected for credit lines under the project. Only \nMFIs that meet ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria will be selected.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, JFPR = Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, MFI = microfinance institution,   \nSGES = smart green energy solutions, TA = technical assistance.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n35.  The government and the MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and grant documents. \n \n36.  The government and the MOF have agreed on certain covenants for the project, which \nare set forth in the grant and project agreements. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding $10,000,000 to the Republic of Tajikistan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for \nthe  Access  to  Green  Finance  Project  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant and project agreements presented to the \nBoard. \n \n38.  I also recommend that the Board approve the proposal in paragraph 24 of this report to \npermit procurement (i) in countries that are not (a) developing member countries of ADB or (b) \ndeveloped member countries of ADB that have contributed to the Asian Development Fund; and \n(ii) of goods produced in such countries. \n \n                Takehiko Nakao \n                                  President \n4 June 2013\n ", "Appendix 1   11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased energy  More than 20,000 households  TAJSTAT  Increased public \nefficiency in Tajik  use energy-efficient and clean    awareness of the \nhouseholds  SGES by 2021 (baseline  MFIs and NGOs  benefits of SGES \n  2012: 6,000)  involved in SGES   \n    Risk \nProject surveys  Low quality of \n  products and \nservices being \nprovided and \nsupplied in the \ncountry \nOutcome      Assumption  \nIncreased access to  Cumulative number of loans  MFI progress reports  Continued credit \nfinance for SGES in  by MFIs for SGES increased    demand for SGES \nTajikistan  to at least 12,000 (totaling at    and sound \nleast $16 million) by 2019  functioning of \n(baseline 2012: 6,200;  microfinance \n$5 million)  institutions  \n \nRisk \nLoan delinquencies \ncaused by poor \nunderwriting or \ndeteriorated \neconomic conditions \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
