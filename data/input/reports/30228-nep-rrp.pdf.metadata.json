It will address the\nissue of food security by providing farmers with cash income\nand important nutritional sources, and landless laborers with\nincome-generating  opportunities.  The  Project  will  adopt  a\nfarmer group approach to agricultural extension as an effective\nmechanism for the dissemination of technology and marketing\ninformation. Agricultural extension services will be improved\nand  provided  for  farmer  groups  based  on  the  groups'\ndemands. Under the Project, an increased number of farmer\ngroups  will  be  mobilized  and  strengthened  by  skilled  and\nexperienced  private  service  providers,  including\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGO).  The  participation  of\nthese private service providers for agricultural extension will be\ngradually increased under the Project on a contractual basis.\nThe  important  role  of  women  in  agriculture  and  rural\ndevelopment  is  fully  recognized,  and  they  will  actively\nparticipate in project implementation.\nClassification Primary:  Poverty reduction\nSecondary:  Gender\nEnvironment\nAssessment Category B\nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken, and\na summary IEE is a core appendix.\nRationale Nepal is one of the lowest-income countries in the world, with\nper capita gross domestic product at $242. An estimated 42\npercent of the country\u2019s population live below the poverty line.\nThe poverty incidence is especially high in the Midwestern and\nFar Western development regions where the Project will be\nimplemented.  Nepal\u2019s  agriculture  largely  depends  on\nsubsistence-oriented  food-grain  production.  However,  the\nproduction  and  marketing  of  secondary  crops  constitute\nimportant sources of cash income for farmers, and can have\ngreater  potential  with  the  rapidly  improving  road  access  in\nthese  regions.  These  crops  also  provide  vital  nutritional\nsupplements such as vegetable protein, vitamins, and minerals\nfor the poor population in the rural area.\nIn  1989,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  the\nSecondary  Crops  Development  Project  (SCDP)  to  improve\nfarm incomes and create rural employment opportunities by\nincreasing  the  production  of  major  secondary  crops  in  six\ndistricts  in  the  Midwestern  Development  Region.  The\nGovernment requested ADB to provide follow-on assistance in", "iii\nthe Midwestern and Far Western development regions of the\ncountry. Despite the progress made under the SCDP, the lack\nof effective agricultural extension services and a weak linkage\nbetween extension and research in the field are still major\nconstraints  to  increased  production  and  marketing  of\nsecondary crops in these regions. To provide more effective\nservices for client farmers, the Government is now committed\nto the involvement and gradual promotion of private service\nproviders  under  the  Project.  The  important  policy  and\ninstitutional reforms that were recently introduced on the supply\nside  of  agricultural  inputs,  in  line  with  the  Government's\nAgriculture Perspective Plan, are expected to lead to increased\nproduction  with  the  improvement  in  the  dissemination  of\nappropriate production technologies and marketing information.\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  operational\nstrategy  for  Nepal  to  reduce  poverty  by  facilitating  the\ntransformation of rural communities for sustainable growth and\nbetter living standards. The Project has been prepared based\non ADB\u2019s past experience in the SCDP and other projects in\nagriculture and rural development, and on the experience of\nother funding agencies.\nObjectives\n  and Scope The primary objective of the Project is to increase farmers'\nincome by promoting production and marketing of agricultural\ncrops, with a particular focus on secondary crops in potential\nareas for increased production and based on a farmer group\napproach  in  agricultural  extension.  This  will  contribute  to\npoverty reduction in the poverty-stricken Midwestern and Far\nWestern  development  regions.  The  Project  has  been\nformulated with due emphasis on the importance of the active\nparticipation of the private sector in agricultural extension and\nresearch as well as of the active involvement of women.\nThe project scope will include (i) the provision of extension\nservices for farmer groups, (ii) promotion of private extension\nservices,  (iii)  promotion  of  client-oriented  research  activities,\nand (iv) support for project management. The Project will be\nfocused on the improvement of agricultural extension services\nand on strengthening of the linkage between extension and\nresearch to address the needs of farmer groups in the project\narea. The Project will utilize and support the district agricultural\ndevelopment  committees  for  better  coordination  with  the\nactivities  of  other  agencies  in  irrigation,  livestock,  and  rural\nfinance. The Project will cover 12 districts in phases.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project, including contingencies and taxes,\nis estimated at $14.04 million, comprising a foreign exchange\ncost of $4.40 million (31 percent) and a local currency cost of\n$9.64 million equivalent (69 percent).", "iv\nFinancing Plan\nSource   Foreign     Local    Total Percent\nExchange   Currency    Cost\n            ($ million)\nADB 4.40 6.60   11.00 78\nGovernment 0.00 3.04  3.04 22\nTotal 4.40       9.64   14.04     100\nLoan Amount and Terms The equivalent in various currencies of SDR 8,526,000 ($11.00\nmillion) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with a maturity of\n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest\ncharge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter to be paid semiannually.\nPeriod of Loan Utilization Until 31 December 2007\nExecuting\n   Agency The  Department  of  Agriculture  (DOA)  of  the  Ministry  of\nAgriculture and Cooperatives\nImplementation\n   Arrangements DOA has established a project coordination unit at the central\nlevel,  and  appointed  a  full-time  project  coordinator.

There will\nbe notable changes in farmers' cropping patterns and intensity\nthrough  the  introduction  of  secondary  crops.  Under  the\nProject,  farmers  will  gradually  adopt  improved  seeds  and\ntechnology through their groups. The annual farm income will\nincrease under the Project by about NRs5,300 ($77), or 44\npercent in the lowland region, while in the hilly region the gain\nwill be about NRs6,300 ($91), or by 66 percent. The gain in\nnet income is higher in the hilly region because of the greater\npotential for growing horticultural crops in the hills. Based on\nthe  aggregate  costs  and  benefits,  the  Project  will  have  a\nfinancial  internal  rate  of  return  of  16.1  percent  and  an\neconomic internal rate of return of 19.6 percent. The Project is\nhighly  justified  from  a  poverty  perspective  as  substantial\nbenefits will accrue to rural people, who are below or near the\npoverty line. Sensitivity analyses conducted on cost overruns,\ndecreases in benefits, and a combination of the two show the\nProject to remain viable.\nProject activities will generate a positive environmental impact\nby increasing the amount of vegetative cover and improving\nsoil  conservation  and  pest  management.  The  Project  will\naddress important social issues in the project area where most\nof the rural population either live below or near the poverty\nline. Project components are also designed to ensure women\u2019s\nactive participation in farmer groups, promote their skills in\nproduction and marketing, and facilitate their direct access to\nproject benefits. The involvement of private service providers,\nincluding  national  and  local  NGOs,  will  enhance  the\neffectiveness of agricultural extension services though farmer\ngroups. The private service providers to be contracted under\nthe  Project  have  had  extensive  experience  with  small  and\nmarginal  farmers,  and  supporting  weak  and  disadvantaged\ngroups of people in rural areas.", "vi", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan\nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Crop Diversification Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In response to the request of His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal (the Government), the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance (TA) for preparing the Crop\nDiversification  Project  to  promote  market-oriented  agricultural  production  and  crop\ndiversification, thereby contributing to poverty reduction in the Midwestern and Far Western\ndevelopment regions of the country.1 The TA started in March 1999 and was completed in\nSeptember 1999. A series of regional and national workshops were organized in the proposed\nproject area to assess local needs and lessons learned from the past projects. The stakeholders,\nwho participated in the workshops, included staff of the relevant Government agencies and local\nadministrations, traders, farmers, nongovernment organizations (NGO), and external funding\nagencies. ADB fielded the Fact-Finding Mission in February 2000 and Appraisal Mission in July\n20002 to examine the details of the Project. A logical framework for the Project is in Appendix\n1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n \n1.  Agriculture Sector\n \n3. Nepal has unique topographic characteristics with its altitude increasing rapidly from\nabout 100 meters (m) above mean sea level in the south to over 8,800 m in the Himalayan\nmountains in the north, within about 200 kilometers. Based on this difference in altitude, the\ncountry is broadly divided into three ecological regions, which are lowland (Terai),3 hilly, and\nmountainous regions. Each region has its own flora, fauna, and climate. The Terai has alluvial\nsoils and is the main area for food-grain production. The hilly region has an altitude ranging\nfrom 250 m to 4,000 m above mean sea level and is less densely populated with a series of\nvalleys. The mountainous region is least populated and has the lowest intensity of agricultural\nactivities.  The  hilly  and  mountainous  regions  are  suited  to  the  production  of  various\nhorticultural  crops.  Maximum  and  minimum  temperatures  differ  widely  by  altitude  and  by\nmonth. About 60 to 80 percent of annual precipitation is concentrated during the monsoon\nseason between June and September.\n \n4. Nepal\u2019s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) at $242 is among the lowest in the\nworld. In the national economy, agriculture has a dominant role, accounting for about 80 percent\nof the total labor force and about 40 percent of GDP. The cultivated land of about 2.9\n                                            \n1 TA 3080-NEP: Crop Diversification Project, for $500,000, approved on 1 October 1998. Nepal's five development\nregions are designated as administrative regions.\n2 The  Mission  comprised  Masahiro  Otsuka  (Sr.  Project  Economist),  Caroline  Vandenabeele  (Counsel),  Ava\nShrestha (Gender and Development Specialist, Consultant), and Ganesh Rauniyar (Agricultural Economist,\nConsultant). ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission assisted the Mission.\n3 The Terai is an ecological zone in southern Nepal and northern India, an extension of the Indo-gangetic plain.", "2\nmillion hectares (ha) constitutes about 20 percent of the total land of the country. Rice is the\ndominant crop in the country, being cultivated on 1.5 million ha or 38 percent of the total cropped\narea of about 4.0 million ha.4 Maize is the second most important cereal crop in Nepal, and is\ngrown on 0.8 million ha or 20 percent of the total cropped area. Maize and millet are mainly\nproduced in the hilly and mountainous regions. Wheat is grown on 0.6 million ha of land.\nIrrigation facilities exist on about 1.1 million ha of cultivated land. More than half of the farm\nhouseholds  are  engaged  in  livestock  activities,  which  contribute  about  15  percent  of  their\nhousehold income.\n5. In view of the importance of agriculture, the sector's growth is essential for achieving\nthe national objective of poverty reduction. High priority is given to agriculture, with about one\nquarter of the Government's development budget being allocated to the sector during the last\nfive years. However, the average growth rate in the agriculture sector in the 1990s was\ndisappointingly low at about 2.2 percent per annum, which was less than the average rate of\npopulation growth at 2.3 percent per annum during the same period. As a result, the per capita\nfood-grain production declined from 315 kilograms in fiscal year (FY)1991 to 290 kilograms in\nFY1998. The yields of major crops in Nepal have been low and stagnant since the 1960s,\nwhile yields in other South Asian countries improved significantly. Nepal did not sufficiently\nbenefit from improved agricultural technology. The average yields of unhulled rice and wheat in\nNepal in the 1990s are estimated at 2.31 and 1.46 tons/ha, respectively. These are lower than\nthose of other countries in South Asia by 10 to 40 percent. Area, production, and yield of major\ncrops in South Asia and in the Midwestern and Far Western development regions in Nepal are\nshown in Appendix 2.\n6. The Government commenced implementing of the Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP)5\nto  reverse  this  trend  and  promote  agricultural  production  through  policy  and  institutional\nreforms to liberalize the agriculture sector. The APP was formulated in a highly consultative\nand  participatory  manner  that  has  not  been  used  before  in  Nepal  and  reflects  a  wide\nconsensus among key stakeholders. The APP's objectives are to (i) accelerate agricultural\ngrowth through focused investment and increased factor productivity, (ii) alleviate poverty and\nimprove  rural  livelihoods,  and  (iii)  transform  a  subsistence-oriented  agriculture  into  a\ncommercialized one through diversification and widespread realization of regional comparative\nadvantages. The APP emphasizes the importance of priority inputs as a package, including\nfertilizer,  irrigation,  technology,  and  rural  infrastructure.  The  APP  aims  at  developing  the\nlowland region through the green revolution package with a combination of improved seeds,\nfertilizer, and controlled water supply for intensified crop production. The strategy for the hilly\nand mountainous regions emphasizes the need to develop high value agricultural products.\nThese  products  offer  the  opportunity  for  high  income  per  unit  area,  which  is  particularly\nimportant  where  agricultural  land  is  scarce.  The  APP  also  stresses  the  need  for  greatly\nexpanded agricultural trade between the hilly and mountainous regions and the lowland region,\nin view of the potential complementarity between them. To establish such linkage, the APP\ncalls for a market-oriented approach based on private sector initiatives.\n7. The Government approved the APP in 1995. The new investment program based on the\nAPP was first reflected in the Government's annual budget for FY1998, and was incorporated\ninto the Ninth Plan (FY1998-FY2002). Results of the first two years of the APP\n                                            \n4 Ministry of Finance, His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal. July 2000.

The APP covers a 20-year period between FY1996 and FY2015.", "3\nwere below expectations and did not augur well for the overall achievement of plan targets.\nHowever, in 1997 the Government introduced under the Second Agriculture Program6 important\npolicy and institutional reforms for (i) the deregulation of the fertilizer trade, which had been\nsolely handled by a state-owned corporation; (ii) the deregulation of shallow tubewell irrigation\ndevelopment and seed distribution; (iii) the organizational reform of public corporations involved\nin the trade of agricultural inputs and outputs; and (iv) the strengthening of rural infrastructure\ndevelopment.  In  the  budget  speech  for  FY2001,  the  Government  reiterated  its  continued\ncommitment to achieving higher growth of the agriculture sector within the overall framework of\nthe APP for market-oriented sector development.\n8. The improved supply of agricultural inputs needs to be met with demand from farmers\nbased on improvements in their knowledge and agricultural technology. However, the lack of\neffective agricultural extension services and a weak linkage with research to address the\nfarmers' needs severely limit the dissemination of improved inputs and technology among\nfarmers and the opportunities for commercialized agriculture. This is indeed a major constraint\nto increased agricultural production and marketing, particularly in the hilly and mountainous\nregions, where the working conditions are difficult for the agricultural extension and research\nstaff. Under these circumstances, support for effective extension services and research is\nurgently needed.\n2. Secondary Crops\n9. Various secondary crops, also called subsidiary crops, cover about 40 percent of the\ntotal cropped area, and provide vital nutritional supplements such as vegetable protein, vitamins,\nand minerals for people\u2019s diet in a country where more than 50 percent of children under three\nyears of age suffer from malnutrition. These crops constitute important sources of cash income\nfor farmers and contribute 10-30 percent of their average household income. Secondary crops\ninclude cereal crops except for rice and wheat, and a large number of cash crops such as\npulses, oilseeds, spices, vegetables, and fruits.\n10. The typical cropping patterns in the lowlands include (i) rice followed by rice, wheat, or\nmustard seeds under irrigation; and (ii) rice or maize followed by lentil, chickpea, or fallow\nunder rainfed conditions. Production of sugarcane and tropical fruits such as bananas and\nmangoes is also popular in the region. On the other hand, the hilly and mountainous regions\nhave a diverse range of cropping patterns, including rice, maize, or millet followed by wheat,\nlentil, soybean, vegetables, mustard seed, or fallow. Maize and millet are important cereal\ncrops  in  these  regions  with  terracing  along  valleys.  All  the  food-deficit  areas  are  in  hilly\ndistricts, which do not have comparative advantages in producing major cereal crops because\nof  their  climate  and  limited  arable  land.  The  APP  emphasizes  complementarity  between\necological regions, and trade between these regions will benefit the food-deficit districts by\nenabling them to obtain more food through increased cash income. It will also benefit the\nlowland region by providing a market for its food grains.\n11. Farmers use improved seeds of vegetables and fruits, which are mainly produced and\npacked in Japan and Europe, and imported through India by private traders. Local production\nof these seeds is being mainly done at the regional agricultural research stations of the Nepal\nAgricultural Research Council (NARC). Farmers prefer imported seeds for their regular\n                                            \n6  Loan 1604-NEP[SF]: Second Agriculture Program, for $50.0 million, approved on 22 January 1998. The second\ntranche of the loan was released in June 2000.", "4\navailability and high germination rates. There is an increasing demand for improved seeds in\nthe Midwestern and Far Western development regions because of a gradual increase in area\nfor the cultivation of secondary crops. Agriculture supply shops in towns near the border with\nIndia indicate that hybrid vegetable seeds are particularly popular among farmers.\n12. The marketing potential is good in the domestic market, primarily in Kathmandu, for\nfresh  vegetables  and  fruits  because  of  climatic  differences  between  regions  and  rapid\nimprovements in road access to transport these products even from remote districts. Reliable\nstatistics on the marketing of agricultural products are scarce. However, domestic vegetables\nand fruits are increasingly preferred to imports from India. Based on the figures obtained from\nthe Marketing Division of the Department of Agriculture (DOA), Nepal imported about 100,000\ntons of vegetables in 1999 mainly from India, which constitutes only about 7 percent of the\ntotal domestic consumption. The average daily inflow of fruits and vegetables from the western\nregions of Nepal into major wholesale markets in Kathmandu has been increasing and now\namounts to about 190 tons, which constitutes about 50 percent of the total inflow.7 External\nmarkets, mainly in India, exist for cash crops such as ginger, and bulk products such as\npulses, maize, and lentils. Pulses, ginger, and cardamon are the major secondary crops\nexported to India. The export potential will be enhanced with improvements in the reliability of\nsupply and quality, and in road connections.\n13. At times, farmers realize a marketable surplus due to favorable weather conditions or\nneed to sell their produce for cash to pay for consumption or other exigencies. Unfortunately,\nno effective market information systems exist, and thus farmers often have to sell their produce\nto local traders or agents at prices that are lower than the prevailing market prices. This\nproblem is more pronounced for secondary crops, which are produced in small quantities. Sale\nin small quantities at market centers that are away from villages involves higher transaction\ncosts and gives little incentive to look for better prices elsewhere. Few formal local market\nfacilities are available in remote areas. Small-scale farmers often find it difficult to access\nmarkets, and do not have the continuity of supply to satisfy wholesalers, who in turn cannot\npredict  adequate  volume  and  prices  effectively.  In  some  areas,  however,  a  few  farmers'\nassociations, with assistance from NGOs and the district staff of DOA, have taken initiatives in\ngroup  marketing  of  farm  produce.  The  formation  of  these  associations  needs  to  be\nencouraged, and there is an increasingly strong demand among farmers for better access to\nmarket information on their products so that they can effectively respond to the current market\nconditions.\n3. Agricultural Research and Extension\n14. DOA's current system of agricultural extension services dates to the early 1960s with\nthe establishment of district agriculture offices in nine districts. At present, all 75 districts have\nthese  offices,  with  their  agricultural  service  centers  at  strategic  locations.  DOA  also  has\nregional directorates in the five development regions, which coordinate and supervise the\nactivities of district offices. Effective linkage and coordination between agricultural research\nand extension activities are critical for attaining improved productivity in the field. However, the\nlinkage is rather weak and, as a result, the achievements in research do not effectively reach\nfarmers. Recently, NARC has tried to establish better linkages through quarterly meetings of\n                                            \n7 The Department of Agriculture. April 2000.

The preparation of a similar master plan for the whole country is now\nbeing considered with assistance from the Government of Japan.", "5\ntechnical working groups at the regional level. These meetings include representatives from\nDOA and NARC, and provide a forum for discussing technical recommendations on the priority\nareas in extension and research. The regional technical working groups can be utilized for\nstrengthening the linkage between activities of DOA and NARC through regular meetings and\nwith active participation of the relevant line agencies and farmer group representatives. In\naddition, DOA staff organize agricultural fairs with the participation of the regional research\nstations of NARC.\n15. The outreach programs of NARC research stations were also formulated to strengthen\nregional linkages between research and extension. However, such linkage is limited to the\noutreach programs in districts neighboring the NARC research station areas due to NARC's\ninadequate outreach capacity. Farm trials conducted in the vicinity of NARC stations are on a\nvery small scale and cannot cover the needs of local communities. These trials are planned by\nNARC scientists without consultation with DOA or farmer groups, and often do not reflect the\npriority needs of local farmers. Active involvement of farmer groups and the DOA extension\nstaff is essential, and needs to be enhanced for designing research programs, which directly\naddress the farmers' needs. There is an urgent need for strengthening the operational linkage\nbetween  agricultural  research  and  extension,  and  for  widening  the  resource  base  for\nagricultural research. In this context, it is also important to facilitate the establishment of a\nnational agricultural research and development fund (NARDF), which will be converted from a\nproject-based  competitive  grant  funding  system  currently  being  supported  under  the  Hill\nAgriculture Research Project, financed by the United Kingdom (UK). The national fund for\nfinancing  agricultural  research  will  help  promote  more  autonomous  research  activities\naddressing the priority needs of farmers.\n16. The progress of the public-private collaboration has been rather slow in the agriculture\nsector  despite  the  Government's  commitment  to  involve  the  private  sector.  There  are\nencouraging  signs  and  instances,  however,  that  attitudes  and  policies  are  beginning  to\nchange. Such instances are found in collaborative research and marketing arrangements in\nthe central region with support from bilateral funding agencies. Although these are still being\ndone on a small scale, it is essential that the process continues and expands as an important\nstrategic element of the APP for further development of agriculture in the country.\n4. Poverty in Nepal\n17. The country\u2019s population reached approximately 22 million in 1998, evenly divided by\ngender. The ratio of population to arable land is one of the world\u2019s highest at approximately\n600 persons per square kilometer. In Nepal, concern is increasing about the high incidence of\npoverty among the rural population despite the Government\u2019s large development expenditures in\nthe past with assistance from external funding agencies. The recent estimate indicates that 42\npercent of the country\u2019s total population were below the poverty line.8 According to the Human\nDevelopment Report of the United Nations Development Programme for 2000, Nepal is ranked\n144th out of 174 countries, with its human development index estimated at 0.474. The poverty\nincidence is highest in the rural areas and in remote districts. Against this background, poverty\nreduction is the primary objective of the Government\u2019s development policy, as indicated in its\nNinth Plan and the APP (para. 6).\n                                            \n8 The poverty line is officially defined as the income (NRs4,404) required to purchase the minimum requirement of\n2,124 calories per capita per day. Nepal Living Standard Survey, Central Bureau of Statistics, Kathmandu, 1996.", "6\n18. The country\u2019s socioeconomic structure is based on subsistence agriculture with high\nunderemployment and low agricultural productivity. Over the last two decades, average life\nexpectancy in Nepal has increased by 13.5 years, to a national life expectancy of 57 years,\nwhich is the lowest in South Asia. The life expectancy rate for women is lower than that for\nmen. Infant mortality continues to be high, with 1 in every 10 children dying in infancy. Infants\nin the rural areas are exposed to higher risk of death than those in urban areas, and infants in\nthe mountainous region are more than twice as likely to die as those in the hilly and lowland\nregions.9 Nepal also has one of the highest incidence of maternal mortality in the world as well\nas a high rate of morbidity. Malnutrition is widespread, with over half of all households suffering\nfrom some degree of food insecurity.\n19. On average, food expenditure accounts for 62 percent of household income, leaving\ninsufficient  income  for  spending  on  health,  education,  and  other  necessities.  The  gender\ndisparity in income is acute resulting from the control of income by the male head of household\nand the near total lack of property rights for women. The disparity in assets and income often\nhas a detrimental effect on household health, nutrition, education, and overall standard of\nliving. To have significant impact on poverty reduction in Nepal, more emphasis needs to be\nplaced on the policies and programs that emphasize capacity building for the poor so they can\nparticipate  in  the  development  process  through  NGOs,  community-based  organizations\n(CBOs), and local governments. It is also important that maximum attention is given to women\nthrough, among other things, appropriate support for their role in agriculture.\n5. Gender and Agricultural Development\n20. Women's roles are critical in agricultural production in Nepal. However, the value of\nsuch roles has been largely diminished, and women have had less access than men to the\ndevelopment process and the resulting benefits. Norms of hierarchy and cultural notions of\nfemale and male roles govern the specific ways in which work is shared. The prevailing gender\ndivision of labor makes men responsible for plowing while women are held responsible for the\nensuing tasks. As a result, regardless of the crop that is being cultivated, labor inputs for\nplanting,  composting,  applying  manure,  transplanting,  weeding,  and  postharvest  activities\nincluding seed selection and storing are mainly provided by women.\n21. DOA\u2019s  training  programs  and  extension  services  have  had  little  impact  on  the\nproductivity of rural women because of (i) extension services not fully taking into account the\ngender division of labor in the agricultural production cycle, (ii) a gender bias toward men in the\nprovision of training and information, and (iii) the absence of institutional support to women\nfarmer groups. Training on subjects like seed trial, selection, and planting should be directed to\nwomen. Usually, men hold title to land. As a result, women\u2019s access to formal credit is limited.\nMen generally control the marketing of agricultural surpluses, and the income from the sale of\ncrops remains with men. Women are able to sell or barter a small amount of grains to meet\nsome of their household needs.\n22. Overall, women account for about 20 percent of farmer group members and less than 2\npercent  of  the  group  leadership.  Women  are  encouraged  by  the  DOA's  district  staff  to\nparticipate in farmer groups and DOA's training programs. However, the degree of women\u2019s\nparticipation and interactions between men and women is still to a great extent determined by\n                                            \n9 United Nations Development Programme. 1998. Nepal Human Development Report, 1998, Nepal South Asia\nCenter, Kathmandu.", "7\nsociocultural  traditions.  Particularly  in  the  lowland  region,  women  prefer  to  participate  in\nwomen-only groups due to cultural barriers. These women-only groups have been formed\naround specific crops such as ginger, vegetables, and mushrooms.\n23. Vegetable  cultivation  has  emerged  as  a  significant  activity  for  marginal  farm\nhouseholds with less than 0.25 ha of land. Vegetables with short gestation periods yield (i)\nquick and high returns when marketed, (ii) a regular source of income for poor households,\nand  (iii)  nutritional  supplements.  Women  with  access  to  water  and  to  local  markets  are\nmotivated to invest more time in vegetable production in their kitchen gardens, as they are able\nto reconcile these activities with their household work. Women in the hilly region directly\ncontrol outputs of homestead vegetable production and actively bring their products to nearby\nmarkets.  Facilitating  women's  involvement  in  marketing  their  products  will  contribute  to\nimproving women's position in their households since the person who markets the produce has\na larger control over cash income. The improvement of women\u2019s access to marketing of\ncommercial crops is crucial in addressing gender issues in agriculture.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n \n 24. The Government's APP provides a central focus for agriculture and rural development\n(para. 6). In line with the APP, the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC)10 introduced\nin March 1998 a specific sector strategy that aims at strengthening its agricultural research and\nextension services through improvements in the relevant institutional arrangements and in the\nadministrative regulations of such institutions. This strategy includes measures to (i) provide\nperformance-oriented incentives for the MOAC\u2019s junior technicians (JTs) and junior technical\nassistants  (JTAs)  in  agricultural  research  and  extension  services;  (ii)  increase  farmers\u2019\nparticipation in the establishment, operation, and maintenance of agricultural service centers\n(ASC) and subservice centers (ASSC); (iii) introduce self-financing management in experimental\nfarms, laboratory facilities, and agricultural training centers; and (iv) develop packages including\nvarious elements for intensified agricultural production. These measures are being gradually\nintroduced to districts.\n25. The APP forms an integral part of the Government's Ninth Plan. Poverty reduction is to\nbe achieved through focused investment mainly in agriculture and agro-based small-scale\nindustries, which are expected to generate significant employment opportunities in rural areas.\nDuring  the  Ninth  Plan  period,  emphasis  is  placed  on  further  commercialization  and\ndiversification of agriculture. Development of cash crops will be increasingly linked with product\nmarketing and the expansion of agro-based industries. Collaboration with the private sector,\nincluding NGOs and CBOs, is also emphasized.\n26. Government policies and plans reflected in APP and the Ninth Plan are wide ranging\nand  aim  at  further  deregulation  of  the  agriculture  sector.  In  line  with  these  policies,  the\namendment of existing rules and regulations needs to be considered for (i) the promotion of\nthe private sector's involvement in agricultural research and extension services, and (ii) the\nimplementation of MOAC's strategy for more effective and efficient public services for research\nand extension. ADB and the Government will continue policy dialogue in this regard.\n \n                                            \n10The Ministry of Agriculture was renamed to the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives in April 2000.", "8\n \n \n C. External Assistance to the Sector\n \n27. Since 1990, ADB assistance for agriculture and rural development in Nepal has totaled\n$308 million for irrigation, rural finance, rural infrastructure, and livestock and crop production.\nTA for agriculture and rural development amounted to $22 million or 24 percent of ADB's total\nTA amount for Nepal. ADB has 10 loan projects ongoing for agriculture and rural development,\nincluding 4 for irrigation; 2 for microfinance; and 1 each for rural infrastructure, livestock, area\ndevelopment,  and  agriculture.  Recently  approved  ADB  projects  are  in  line  with  the\nGovernment's APP.\n28. The World Bank has provided loans amounting to about $176 million during the same\nperiod,  for  the  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  facilities  and  promotion  of  improved  agricultural\ntechnology. Its Agricultural Research and Extension Project (AREP) started in 1997 in the\nlowland region, and is ongoing with DOA and NARC as implementing agencies. In view of the\nAREP's unsatisfactory performance during the first half of the project period, a midterm review\nwas conducted in February 2000 for major refocusing of activities. Although the participation of\nprivate service providers was envisaged at the beginning, there was no formal involvement of\nthe private sector. During the second half of the project, contracts will be awarded to NGOs to\nsupplement DOA's activities under the AREP. Measures to strengthen the linkage between\nresearch and extension, and to reflect farmers' needs for bottom-up planning of project activities,\nwill be introduced by strengthening on-farm outreach programs and increased participation of\nprivate sector institutions.\n29. The International Fund for Agricultural Development and the European Union provided\nfunds, amounting to cumulative totals of $32 million and $34 million respectively, for irrigation,\nforestry, and watershed management. In addition, bilateral funding agencies provided about\n$300 million for agriculture and rural development. The United States Agency for International\nDevelopment is the largest contributor among bilateral funding agencies, with $112 million,\nfollowed by Japan, Denmark, and UK. These have been provided on a grant basis for a wide\nrange of subsectors. UK's Department for International Development (DFID) has long been\ninvolved in agricultural research. Its ongoing Hill Agriculture Research Project aims at improving\nresearch systems for agriculture in hilly areas. It uses a competitive funding system through a\nfund to promote public and private research activities. This project fund is being developed into\nthe NARDF with further assistance. Appendix 3 lists the relevant projects and programs of\nexternal funding agencies for agriculture and rural development in Nepal.\n \n D. Lessons Learned\n \n30. Major lessons learned from ADB projects, include the need for (i) strong local ownership\nof project activities among key stakeholders for sustainable project impact; (ii) strengthening and\nimprovement of operational performance of executing agencies; (iii) increased involvement of\nprivate  organizations,  including  NGOs;  and  (iv)  transparency  and  accountability  for  more\neffective delivery of public support services. These findings were highlighted in the project\ncompletion reports for two recently completed projects.11\n                                            \n11PCR:  NEP19028:  Hill Fruit Development Project,  June  1998;  and  PCR:  NEP20193:  Secondary Crops\nDevelopment Project, February 1999.", "9\n31. Under the Secondary Crops Development Project (SCDP),12 farmers were formed into\ngroups  for  training  and  for  adoption  of  new  crops  and  improved  technologies.  The  group\napproach has been effective in the delivery of training, information, and improved agricultural\ntechnologies. Farmers in the SCDP project area recognize the direct benefits of forming groups.\nAlthough the SCDP was rated partly successful due to the initial delay in implementation, its\nobjective to increase secondary crops production and farmers' income was achieved in a cost-\neffective manner. There were also significant socioeconomic impacts in terms of increased\nsocial awareness among farmers, women's empowerment, and collective efforts in procuring\ninputs and marketing products.\n 32. There have been similar findings of projects of other external funding agencies in the\nagriculture sector, including the World Bank, Swiss Development Cooperation, and UK\u2019s DFID.\nAgriculture  projects  require  intensive  and  regular  monitoring,  and  the  provision  of  timely\nguidance and supervision. Without such guidance, farmer groups tend to be managed and\ncontrolled by a few influential members of rural communities, and may also become politicized.\nWomen must be explicitly identified as full members of the groups. Providing group membership\non a household basis, without explicitly identifying the gender, limits their participation in group\nmanagement  and  decision-making.  Having  women  as  executive  members  of  a  group\nenhances their self-confidence and social status, and can be effective in introducing a large\nnumber of women to decision-making processes, structures, and challenges.\n \n 33. Technical staff of the Government executing agencies have little orientation and few of\nthe skills required to handle the range of social preparation activities at the field level to promote\nthe formation of sustainable farmer groups. In this regard, some private service providers in rural\nNepal, including NGOs, are effectively facilitating group formation processes and disseminating\nbenefits widely in the local community.  It  is  important  to  introduce  alternative  institutional\narrangements into agricultural research and extension with the use of NGOs, CBOs, and other\nprivate entities through contracts and by redefining the role of Government agencies. These\nfindings have been fully taken into account in the project design. More details are included in\nAppendix 4.\n \n E. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n \n34. ADB\u2019s country operational strategy for Nepal13 aims at poverty reduction through (i)\nincreased  income-generating  opportunities  in  the  rural  areas  resulting  from  broad-based\neconomic  growth,  (ii)  equitable  distribution  of  basic  social  services  to  enhance  human\ndevelopment, and (iii) sound environmental management. This is in line with the Government\u2019s\ndevelopment objectives as stated in the Ninth Plan and APP. Under ADB's strategy, priorities\nwill  be  given  to  agricultural  growth,  provision  of  physical  and  social  infrastructure,  and\nenvironmental  protection.  In  recognition  of  the  importance  of  agriculture  in  the  national\neconomy, agricultural development is a key feature of ADB's strategy. To realize effective ADB\nassistance,  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  areas  where  good  performance  is  assured  and\nsocioeconomic returns are expected to be high. Beneficiary participation in the formulation and\nimplementation of project activities is an integral part of ADB\u2019s operational strategy for the\n                                            \n12Loan No.964-NEP[SF]: Secondary Crops Development Project, for $11.4 million, approved on 27 July 1989, and\nclosed on 31 December 1997.  A portion of the loan proceeds (about $4.0 million) was canceled in June 1992 at\nthe time of project reformulation mainly due to reduced scope of the research component.\n13STS: NEP 99006 Nepal - Country Operational Strategy Study, 1999.", "10\nagriculture sector and has been fully incorporated into the formulation of the Project.\n35. In the past, agriculture and rural development in Nepal have been impacted by the\nineffective management by Government agencies, and the policy and institutional environment\nrestricting  private  sector  initiatives.  However,  despite  adverse  political  circumstances,  the\nGovernment has introduced a series of policy and institutional reforms. Significant progress\nhas been made recently in liberalizing the agriculture sector in line with the overall market-\noriented economic policies in the country. At the Nepal consultative group meeting in April\n2000,  the  external  funding  agencies  endorsed  the  Government's  genuine  commitment  to\ncontinue its reform measures. There is a strong rationale for ADB's intervention in the sector in\nview of the need for (i) continued policy dialogue to generate a favorable policy environment\nfor the liberalization of agriculture, and (ii) assistance in sustaining agricultural growth to\nachieve the national development objective of poverty reduction.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n36. ADB has been engaged in an extensive sector dialogue with the Government since the\npreparation of the APP. The Government recognizes the need to actively involve the private\nsector in agriculture as a supplier of inputs and agricultural support services, and to become a\nfacilitator for agricultural growth in the long run rather than a direct implementer. In this context,\nADB, in collaboration with other external funding agencies, promoted dialogue on the future\nvision  of  Nepal's  agricultural  research  system.  To  enhance  agricultural  research  and\ndevelopment activities by involving a wide range of private sector institutions, the Government\nhas decided to establish an autonomous NARDF (para. 15). During project processing, ADB\nagreed with the Government on specific steps for the establishment of the fund.\n37. To effectively implement the APP, MOAC developed a sector strategy in 1998 (para.\n24) that called for increased cost recovery for the use of public facilities and the provision of\nagricultural inputs. However, changes have been disappointingly slow in this area. In relation to\nthe Project, ADB pursued with the Government ways to enhance cost recovery from DOA's\nregional laboratory facilities. Private traders often use these laboratory facilities without fees\nbeing charged. The quality of the services provided by these facilities has deteriorated due to the\nlack of proper maintenance. During project processing, it was agreed that DOA would develop\nand implement guidelines for the cost recovery for the use of its regional laboratory facilities.\n38. With regard to the gender issue in agriculture, it was agreed during project processing to\nspecify that at least 35 percent of the members of farmer groups should be women. This is in\nline with MOAC's recent instruction to its field staff. The setting of this quantitative target itself is\nnot an ultimate solution but is expected to increase the participation of women in farmer groups\nunder the culturally difficult situation in the project area, particularly in the lowland region.", "11\n IV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n \nA.  Rationale\n \n39. Nepal is one of the lowest-income countries in the world with 42 percent of the country\u2019s\npopulation living below the poverty line. Poverty incidence is high in the Midwestern and Far\nWestern development regions, where the Project will be implemented, estimated at 59 percent\nand 65 percent respectively (footnote 9). Nepal\u2019s agriculture depends largely on subsistence-\noriented food-grain production. However, the secondary crops constitute important sources of\nfarmers' cash income, which can be used for purchasing staple foods, and vital nutritional\nsupplements. Rapid improvements in the vehicular access through ADB-financed projects14\nwill further enhance the potential for the production and marketing of secondary crops in these\ndevelopment regions.\n40. The Government requested ADB to provide a follow-on undertaking to the SCDP (para.\n31)  in  Nepal's  Midwestern  and  Far  Western  development  regions.  The  lack  of  effective\nagricultural extension services and a weak linkage between extension and research in the field\nare still major constraints to production and marketing of secondary crops in these regions. To\nprovide  more  effective  research  and  extension  services  for  the  client  farmers  under  the\nProject, the Government and ADB agreed to adopt the group formation and strengthening\nprocesses that have been effectively practiced by NGOs and CBOs in Nepal, and to promote\nthe involvement of private service providers. Important policy and institutional reforms, which\nwere recently introduced on the supply side of agricultural inputs in line with the Government's\nAPP,  are  expected  to  increase  production  with  the  improved  dissemination  of  appropriate\nproduction technologies and marketing information under the Project. The Project addresses the\nissue of food security by providing farmers with cash income and important nutritional sources,\nand  landless  laborers  with  increased  employment  opportunities  through  more  intensive\ncropping activities. The Project will fit in ADB\u2019s country operational strategy for Nepal to reduce\npoverty by facilitating the transformation of rural communities for sustainable growth and better\nliving standards.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n1.  Objectives\n41. The Project will increase farmers' income by promoting production and marketing of\nagricultural crops with a particular focus on secondary crops in potential areas. Activities will\nbe  based  on  a  farmer  group  approach  in  agricultural  extension.  Thus,  the  Project  will\ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  poverty-stricken  Midwestern  and  Far  Western\ndevelopment regions. The Project has been formulated with due emphasis on the importance\nof the active participation of the private sector as well as of the active involvement of women\nfarmers.\n                                            \n14Including Loan 748-NEP: Seti Zone Rural Development, for $20 million, approved on 31 October 1985; and Loan\n1377-NEP: Third Road Improvement, for $40 million, approved on 21 September 1995. Further improvements in\nroad conditions are expected in the Far Western Development Region under ADB's proposed Fourth Road\nImprovement Project.", "12\n2.  Scope\n42. The project scope will include (i) extension services for farmer groups, (ii) promotion of\nprivate  extension  services,  (iii)  promotion  of  client-oriented  research,  and  (iv)  project\nmanagement support. The Project will cover 12 districts in phases (see Map). These districts\nhave been selected based on criteria that include (i) districts covered under the SCDP, (ii)\ndistricts  where  similar  activities  were  implemented  in  the  past  under  other  projects,  (iii)\navailable  vehicular  access  to  district  headquarters,  (iv)  potential  for  the  production  and\nmarketing of secondary crops, and (v) food self-sufficiency status. The security situation in\nthese districts was fully considered and will be closely monitored during project implementation\nin consultation with other external funding agencies. The possibility of including other districts\nin the two development regions may be considered during the midterm review if additional\ndistricts meet the criteria and project activities are progressing well in the 12 districts. The\nProject aims at gradually promoting the provision of private extension services in the project\narea.\n43. The  Project  focuses  on  secondary  crops  that  have  good  potential  for  increased\nproduction and marketing. The marketing potential of various secondary crops was assessed\nduring project formulation through a series of interviews and regional workshops with farmer\ngroups,  dealers  of  agricultural  inputs  and  outputs,  and  the  staff  of  central  and  local\nadministrations. Important crops identified during this process include maize, oilseed, lentil,\nchickpea,  pigeon  pea,  soybean,  and  sunflower.  In  addition,  horticultural  crops  including\nvegetables and fruits are considered to have good potential if extension services and market\ninformation systems are improved. Under the Project, farmers will be encouraged to use the\nexisting savings and credit organizations in the project area so that the members of farmer\ngroups will have easier access to the finance required for increased production and marketing\nof secondary crops. There is adequate liquidity available for rural credit in the project area\nthrough formal and informal financial institutions, including the existing lines of credit under\nADB's ongoing Rural Microfinance Project.15\n3.  Project Components\na. Extension Services for Farmer Groups\n44. The Project will focus on production pocket areas as growth centers,16 which will be\nselected  through  annual  consultation  processes  at  the  district  level  (para.  65).  These\nprocesses  will  be  initiated  and  led  by  the  district  development  committees  through  their\nagricultural  development  committees  and  in  collaboration  with  DOA's  district  agricultural\ndevelopment offices (DADO). Coverage is expected to reach about 20 pocket areas per\nproject district in the lowland region and about 15 pocket areas per district in the hilly region.\n45. DADOs will form field teams to support the strengthening and formation of farmer\ngroups. Each field team will generally consist of one man and one woman, and work for one\npocket area covering an average of about 15 farmer groups. The field teams will be primarily\n                                            \n15 Loan 1650-NEP: Rural Microfinance Project, for $20 million, approved on 8 December 1998.\n16The production pocket area is defined by MOAC as a geographically isolated area with good production and\nmarketing potential of up to 1,000 ha in the lowland region for food crops, 150 ha for fruits, and 100 ha for\nvegetables. The pocket area in the hilly region is smaller: up to 150 ha for food crops, 70 ha for fruits, and 40 ha\nfor vegetables.", "13\nrecruited  by  DADOs  in  collaboration  with  the  concerned  district  and  village  development\ncommittees, and work with JTs and JTAs assigned to the concerned ASCs and ASSCs. The\nfield team members should preferably be from the same locality and have practical experience\nin the social mobilization and formation of farmer groups. They will be paid equally for work of\nequal value irrespective of gender. In addition, there will be at least one team supervisor per\ndistrict to provide day-to-day guidance to the field teams, visiting the field with the teams to\nreview  and  plan  activities.  The  team  supervisor,  who  should  have  at  least  five  years  of\npractical experience in social mobilization, will be responsible for assisting farmer groups in\nforming a cooperative or association, and for facilitating marketing activities of farmer groups.\n46. The field teams and team supervisors will be recruited individually as incremental staff\nof the Project or through contracts with local CBOs or local NGOs. These alternatives will be\nflexibly determined in view of local conditions and availability of appropriate organizations.\nWhere  local  organizations  provide  field  teams  and  team  supervisors,  their  roles  and\nresponsibilities  will  be  clearly  defined  in  their  contracts.  Depending  on  the  amount  of  a\ncontract, each contract will be awarded by DADOs, the project implementation unit (PIU) at the\nregional level, or by the project coordination unit (PCU) at the central level. Field teams will\nprovide farmer groups with intensive support over an initial period of three years. During the\nmidterm review, a possible cost-sharing system among the Government, local administrations,\nand farmer groups will be developed for introduction under the Project, for the recruitment of\nfield teams and team supervisors. This will enhance the financial sustainability of project\nactivities after project completion (para. 76). The Project will support regional training programs\nand workshops for the field teams to improve their skills in group mobilization, participatory\nassessments and planning, group management, and gender analysis. These programs will be\norganized by the PIUs and conducted at the regional training centers in the project area.\n47. The strengthening of existing farmer groups and the formation of new groups will be the\nfirst step to develop a sustainable framework for improved agricultural extension. The existing\nfarmer groups include those of water users, forest users, vegetable growers, crop producers,\nlivestock farmers, savings and credit organizations, and women's and youth groups. These\ngroups will be integrated into the Project to the maximum extent possible in order to avoid\nduplication of group formation activities. Only where groups are not available will the Project\nsupport the formation of new farmer groups. The average size of farmer groups will largely\ndepend on the type of groups used, but is expected to be about 25 farmers in the lowland\nregion and about 20 farmers in the hilly region. Based on the experience of DOA and CBOs in\nthe project area, these averages are considered to be appropriate and manageable for group\nsustainability and the delivery of extension services and training. Sufficient flexibility should be\nallowed in new group formation to determine their size based on local conditions. Each pocket\narea for field crops is expected to have about 20 farmer groups in the lowland region and 15\ngroups in the hilly region, and a pocket area for fruits or vegetables will have about 4 groups in\nboth lowland and hilly regions.\n48. DOA's agricultural extension services, including technical training, crop demonstrations,\nand foundation seed production, will be provided for farmer groups in the project area. Training\nprograms for farmer groups and women's farmer groups will be conducted by JTs and JTAs\nunder  the  Project  on  (i)  the  use  of  improved  seeds  and  other  agricultural  inputs  for  the\nproduction of secondary crops; (ii) postharvest operations, including the availability and use of\nstorage facilities; (iii) marketing of secondary crops; and (iv) rural finance. Training programs\non other subjects will be considered based on the demand from farmer groups and in view of\nother training programs, which farmers receive from other projects and NGOs. Women will be", "14\nparticularly encouraged to participate in training on group marketing of secondary crops as\nthey  have  greater  responsibility  for  marketing  decisions.  Field  team  supervisors  will  also\nprovide training for farmer groups and women farmer groups on group management, self-\nmonitoring of group activities, registration as cooperatives, and group procurement of inputs\nand marketing.\n49. To promote interactions between private dealers and processors, and farmers, DADOs\nwill  organize  agricultural  fairs  in  the  project  area  in  collaboration  with  local  chambers  of\ncommerce and industry. The existing collection centers and local markets in the selected\nproduction pocket areas will be rehabilitated based on the requests from farmer groups and\nthrough consultations with district and village development committees. Under the Project,\nregional facilities will be strengthened for effective collection and dissemination of information\non local markets through (i) collaboration with the existing information network, such as that of\nthe  Agro-enterprise  Center  of  the  Federation  of  Nepalese  Chambers  of  Commerce  and\nIndustry; (ii) improvement of communications facilities, including the increased use of facsimile\nand e-mail; and (iii) provision of service vehicles where necessary. The consultants recruited\nunder the Project will assist DADOs in improving the market information system, making the\nsystem more relevant to farmers in the project area, and conducting and updating market\nresearch for products of good marketing potential.\nb. Promotion of Private Extension Services\n50. The Project will promote the use of private service providers, including NGOs and\nCBOs, to form and strengthen farmer groups and provide agricultural extension services for\nthem. As the number and availability of such private service providers is limited, the private\nextension services will be introduced gradually into the Project. The selection and awarding of\ncontracts to these service providers will be done by the PCU or the concerned regional director\nof DOA through local competitive bidding in consultation with the concerned DADO and district\nand village development committees (para. 70). Each contract will primarily cover the identified\nproduction pocket areas and will include detailed specification of expected outputs in terms of\nthe number and type of farmer groups and training programs to be conducted. The period to\nbe covered under the contract will depend on the specific needs in each area, but should be\nrenewable on a yearly basis subject to satisfactory performance of the service provider. The\nprivate  service  provider  will  be  responsible  for  all  activities  from  the  formation  and\nstrengthening of farmer groups to the delivery of extension services. The social mobilization\nprograms to be carried out by private service providers in the lowland region will include\nprograms for increasing social awareness and skills of agricultural laborers who had been\nworking under the bonded labor practices.17 There is an urgent need for providing these\nlaborers with adequate economic means for self-reliance.\n51. Major national NGOs that are currently providing agricultural extension services under\nprojects financed by bilateral funding agencies have been consulted. Contracts with private\nservice  providers  under  the  Project  will  include  the  provision  for  transportation  costs,\nequipment,  field  staff,  training  programs,  and  recurrent  expenses.  If  the  private  service\nproviders cannot utilize ASCs and ASSCs, appropriate office facilities need to be rented. The\ntechnical staff will include a field supervisor, crop specialists, field technicians, social\n                                            \n17On 17 July 2000, the Government made a landmark decision, outlawing bonded labor in the country. This fulfilled\nits obligation to realize the principles and fundamental human rights set out in the constitution of the International\nLabour Organization.", "15\nmobilizers, and administrative staff. In the first year, the arrangement with private service\nproviders  can  be  adopted  in  Dailekh  or  Surkhet  district  in  the  Midwestern  Development\nRegion, and in Dadeldhura or Baitadi district in the Far Western Development Region. A\nmaximum of two contracts for each of the two development regions will be awarded to private\nservice providers in the first year of project implementation.\nc. Promotion of Client-Oriented Research\n52. The Project will support research proposals on the priority subjects identified for the\nproject area. The quarterly meetings of the regional technical working groups and the monthly\nmeetings of the district agricultural development committees will be used for identifying high\npriority subjects for research, thereby facilitating client-oriented research activities (paras. 63-\n64). Such research proposals will be invited from public and private institutions, including\nNARC,  the  Institute  of  Agricultural  and  Animal  Sciences,  other  Government  agencies,\nuniversities, colleges, private companies, and NGOs. The Project will be focused on the\ngradual commercialization of agriculture through crop diversification in the project area. Thus,\nthe starting point for all activities will be market research to establish what can profitably be\nsold and in which markets. Research activities will then aim at (i) identifying which production\npocket area can best meet the demand of each market, (ii) identifying or developing suitable\nvarieties and agronomic practices to meet this demand, and (iii) using the extension service to\nbring these varieties and practices to the attention of farmer groups.\n53. These research proposals will be financed under the Project through contributions to\nthe NARDF (para. 36), which will be established by the Government to institutionalize a\ncompetitive funding system for agricultural research proposals. This system was originally\nintroduced by DFID's Hill Agriculture Research Project, and has been operational since 1996.\nContributions to this fund will only support applied agricultural research activities, which will be\napplicable to the project area. The NARDF will be established as a fully autonomous body\nthrough new legislation (para. 64). As an interim measure, it was agreed that the Government\nwould establish through its executive order, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, a\nnational  committee  to  administer  funds  for  agricultural  research  and  development.  Loan\nproceeds will not be withdrawn for this component until the Government establishes this\ncommittee, which will comprise seven representatives of the Government, civil society and\nprivate enterprises. The use of the funds for research activities will facilitate a shift of the\nagricultural research system to be more responsive; minimize unnecessary interference; and\ninvolve  the  eventual  clients  in  the  identification  of  problems,  selection  of  proposals,  and\nfunding of research activities.\nd. Project Management Support\n54. Support for project management will be provided at the central, regional, and district\nlevels. The PCU and the PIUs will have service vehicles, communications equipment, and\nincremental staff. These vehicles and equipment will be used solely for project implementation.\nPIU  offices  will  be  constructed  on  the  existing  office  compounds  of  the  Government  in\nNepalganj in the Midwestern Development Region, and in Dadeldhura District in the Far\nWestern Development Region. To promote training activities in the Far Western Development\nRegion, a regional training center will be established at the vegetable seed production farm in\nDadeldhura  District.  At  present,  there  is  no  regional  training  center  in  the  Far  Western\nDevelopment Region, and the trainees selected from farmer groups or local administrations", "16\nneed to travel to other development regions for major training programs. Within three months\nof loan effectiveness, MOAC will notify ADB of final approval of the location of the regional\ntraining center.\n55. Under the Project, JTs and JTAs will be provided with training programs, covering\nsubjects  like  harvest  record  keeping,  postharvest  handling,  integrated  pest  management,\ngender and development, and participatory rural appraisal. The training programs will be\nconducted mainly at the regional training centers and include about 25 JTs and JTAs per\nprogram. Trainers' training programs will be conducted on similar subjects at the centers. The\nProject will include study visits and higher degree courses in Nepal to widen the trainers'\npractical knowledge and improve their qualifications.\n56. DOA\u2019s extension services are currently provided at ASCs and ASSCs. There are 49\nASCs  and  94  ASSCs  in  the  project  area,  with  each  center  covering  about  five  village\ndevelopment committees. Each center belongs to a DADO. The Project will utilize the existing\nASCs and ASSCs in the selected pocket areas for extension services. Under the Project,\nthese centers will receive support for transportation facilities such as bicycles and motorcycles,\nand equipment for communications and soil testing. The ASC, ASSC, and DADO buildings will\nbe rehabilitated as required. The facilities can be utilized by private service providers (para.\n51). Support will be provided to construct buildings in the project area for regional laboratory\nfacilities, which are currently scattered in rented houses. These facilities will be consolidated in\ncompounds in Nepalganj in Banke District for the Midwestern Development Region, and in\nDhangadi in Kailali District for the Far Western Development Region. In line with MOAC's\nsector strategy, the Government will develop guidelines for implementing the policy on cost\nrecovery for the use of its regional laboratory facilities. The guidelines will be developed within\nthree months of loan effectiveness and implemented under the Project (para. 37). Project\nimplementation consultants will assist the PCU and PIUs in facilitating project management\nactivities.\nC. Cost Estimates\n57. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $14.04 million, including physical and price\ncontingencies according to ADB's standard practices, and the interest on the ADB loan during\nproject implementation. The total foreign exchange cost of the Project is estimated at $4.40\nmillion or 31 percent of the total project cost, and the local currency cost at $9.64 million\nequivalent or 69 percent of the total cost.

Financing Plan\n 58. It is proposed that ADB will provide a loan amounting to $11.0 million from the Asian\nDevelopment Fund resources. The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period\nof 8 years, and with an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter. ADB will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the Project\nand  68  percent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  high  proportion  of  local  cost  financing  is\nnecessary in view of the high percentage of local currency expenditures and the Government\u2019s\nfiscal constraints. The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Nepal. The balance of about $3.04\nmillion will be financed by the Government.

Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Organization\n59. The Executing Agency for the Project will be DOA of MOAC. The project organization\nchart  is  presented  in  Appendix  6.  DOA  has  established  a  PCU  at  the  central  level  in\nKathmandu, and will establish one PIU each for the Midwestern and Far Western development\nregions before loan effectiveness. The PCU is headed by a full-time project coordinator, who\nwas appointed in March 1999 when the TA for preparing the Project started. The PCU will\nhave five officers, including the project coordinator, a budget and planning officer, a monitoring\nand evaluation officer, an agricultural engineer, an accounting officer, and supporting staff. All\nPCU  staff  will  be  appointed  within  one  month  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  PCU  will  be\nresponsible for (i) overall project implementation and the central-level coordination within DOA\nand with other relevant agencies; (ii) procurement of service vehicles, equipment, and major\ncivil works; (iii) recruitment of consultants and incremental staff; and (iv) supervision of the\nPIUs.  The  PCU  will  compile  all  project-related  documents  such  as  work  plans,  progress\nreports, budget plans, statements of expenditures, and loan withdrawal applications, which will\nbe prepared by the PIUs in consultation with the PCU.\n60. The main focus of project implementation will be at the regional and district levels. PIUs\nwill assume responsibility for the day-to-day implementation and interagency coordination of\nproject activities in the field. Each PIU will be headed by a full-time project manager, who will\nbe supported by the regional director of DOA and will directly report to the project coordinator.\nIn addition to the project manager, each PIU will have a monitoring and evaluation officer, a\nwomen's development officer, an accountant, and a technical overseer. All PIU staff will have\nbeen appointed within one month of loan effectiveness. The PIUs will provide operational\nlinkages  among  the  production  pocket  areas  of  the  Project,  other  relevant  government\nagencies, and the private sector, and will organize the quarterly meetings of the regional\ntechnical working groups for agricultural research and extension.\n61. At the district level, DADOs will be responsible for coordinating and implementing\nproject activities with assistance from PIUs. DADOs will consult with the district and village\ndevelopment committees in the selection of production pocket areas and recruitment of field\nteam members and team supervisors. The district agricultural development committees, which\nwere established at the district level for the APP activities, will be involved in this process.\n62. The Government will establish an interministerial project steering committee (PSC)\nwithin one month of loan effectiveness. The PSC will be headed by the secretary of MOAC,\nand include (i) the director general of DOA; (ii) representatives from the National Planning\nCommission; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Water Resources; Ministry of Local Development;\nMinistry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare; Central Food Research Laboratory; NARC;\nDepartment of Cooperatives; Nepal Rastra Bank; and Federation of Nepalese Chambers of\nCommerce and Industry; and (iii) the executive director of the NARDF secretariat. The project\ncoordinator will be the member-secretary of the PSC. The PSC will be responsible for (i)\nproviding overall policy and operational guidance for project implementation, (ii) resolving\nissues and conflicts that may emerge during implementation, and (iii) facilitating coordination of\nproject activities with other externally financed projects and programs. The PSC will meet at\nleast semiannually in conjunction with ADB's review missions. The PSC may establish project", "19\nmanagement  subcommittees  with  specific  terms  of  reference  to  resolve  technical  issues\nemerging during project implementation.\n63. The PCU will provide the NARDF and, during an interim period, the national committee\nfor agricultural research and development with funds to promote client-oriented research for\nthe Midwestern and Far Western development regions (paras. 53). The priority subjects will be\nidentified by the regional technical working groups, which will meet quarterly and include\nrepresentatives from DADOs in the region, NARC, NGOs, private traders, and farmers. These\npriority subjects will be included in NARDF's list of research activities to be financed under the\nfunds provided from the Project. PIUs will also ensure that the district agricultural development\ncommittees meet monthly to provide a district-level linkage between research and extension,\nand identify farmers' needs in the field for the Project. The district agricultural development\ncommittee  will  be  headed  by  the  district  development  committee  chairperson  and  have\nrepresentatives from district-level line agencies, NARC, farmer groups, and the private sector.\n64. The NARDF will be established as a fully autonomous institution through the enactment\nof a separate act.18 The interim national committee will be dissolved when the NARDF is\nestablished. It was agreed with the Government that the draft bill for the establishment of the\nNARDF  would  be  approved  by  the  Government  for  submission  to  the  Parliament  by  31\nDecember  2001.  The  NARDF  will  have  a  technical  sub-committee.  The  technical  sub-\ncommittee comprises one chief scientist and several senior agricultural scientists, and will be\nresponsible for the semi-annual technical assessment and screening of research proposals on\nthe priority research subjects. The proposals must meet the selection criteria and be consistent\nwith the national agricultural research policy. The research proposals selected by the technical\nsub-committee will be eligible for funding. The NARDF, in collaboration with the PCU, will\nensure that the research activities are properly carried out to produce quality outputs. Initially,\nthe Government will reallocate for the NARDF's administrative expenditure about $0.1 million,\nwhich is equivalent to about 10 percent of the annual budget to be allocated for agricultural\nresearch and extension.\n2. Selection of Pocket Areas and Farmer Groups\n65. Production pocket areas in each district will be selected at the district level through\nannual  consultation  processes  (para.  44),  which  will  include  the  district  and  village\ndevelopment  committees;  the  district  agricultural  development  committees;  and\nrepresentatives of farmer groups, women's farmer groups, local NGOs, private traders, and\nother relevant local organizations. District-level workshops will be organized under the Project\nto facilitate this process. Minimum criteria for the selection of pocket areas will include (i)\nwillingness  of  local  communities  to  participate  in  the  development  of  a  pocket  area  and\ncontribute time, labor, or other resources for this purpose; (ii) willingness of farmers within the\npocket area to focus on the production and marketing of the identified secondary crops; (iii)\nexistence of rural infrastructure such as rural roads, irrigation facilities or local markets; (iv)\nagronomic suitability for the production of the identified crops; and (v) marketability and interest\nfrom agricultural traders and agro-business enterprises. DADOs in the project area have\n                                            \n18The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. April 2000. Task Force Report on the Establishment of the National\nAgricultural Research and Development Fund, His Majesty's Government of Nepal. Kathmandu.", "20\ntentative lists of these production pocket areas, which can be considered as a basis for\nprioritization.19\n66. Farmers are fully aware of benefits generated from the formation of farmer groups,\nincluding advanced information on improved seeds, quality fertilizers, and marketing. There is\na strong demand among farmers in the project area for technical support and guidance. It was\nobserved during the TA for project preparation that field-level training and extension services,\nwhich emphasize practical demonstrations, are in high demand while lectures and theoretical\ntraining are usually not suitable. Farmers are willing to diffuse gained knowledge within their\ngroups and to neighbors or relatives. If the resulting practices increase farmers' incomes, other\nfarmers are keen to learn and emulate them.\n67. Within the potential pocket areas, the Project will focus on farmer groups, including\nmixed gender and women's groups, for the delivery of extension services, group marketing,\nand postharvest information and technologies. Where farmers have been already formed into\ngroups,  they  will  be  assisted  to  become  more  inclusive  by  bringing  in  women,  poor\nhouseholds, and other disadvantaged members of their communities. Where no groups exist,\nthe project field teams will mobilize farmers into groups. To adequately address the project\nobjectives, at least 50 percent of group members in each pocket area will be from poor\nhouseholds, and at least 35 percent will be women, in line with MOAC's guidelines for the field\nstaff. Poor farming households are defined as (i) below the official poverty line, (ii) with land of\nless than 0.5 ha, or (iii) socially considered to be poor in their communities. This definition of\npoor households will be regularly reviewed and agreed between the Government and ADB.\nWhen selecting the poor for the inclusion in a farmer group, priority will be given to the\ndisadvantaged members of the local community, in particular the formerly bonded agricultural\nlaborers (para. 50).\n68. Some farmer groups will be from ethnic minorities, attached to a particular social\nstratum, or from a particular location. The group membership should be mediated by field\nteams  and  social  mobilizers  to  ensure  cohesion.  Joint  membership  of  groups  should  be\nencouraged where both husband and wife are actively involved in the group activities, but with\nrestricted membership rights for fair representation of households among members. The rules\ngoverning new groups should be established during group formation, and should be built on\nthe experience of farmer groups in the project area. The legal status of farmer groups must be\nconsidered but must not be imposed upon the groups during the initial stages when their\ncapacity to even understand the need for rules may be limited. Experience in the project area\nconfirms  that  farmers  and  social  mobilizers  prefer  a  cooperative  registered  under  the\nCooperative  Act  (1992)  rather  than  an  association  registered  under  the  Association\nRegistration Act (1977). While a formal legal status would provide a mechanism for formal\nsanctions against defaulting members, informal sanctions among group members are usually\nmore important. Once farmer groups become fully operational and active under the Project, the\ndevelopment of a cooperative may be explored.\n3. Participation of Private Service Providers\n69. Private  service  providers,  including  local  and  national  NGOs  and  CBOs,  will  be\ncontracted during project implementation to provide extension services complementing the\n                                            \n19The number of these proposed pocket areas varies between districts in the range of 16 to 22. The list was\nsubmitted to ADB during ADB's Loan Appraisal Mission in July 2000.", "21\nextension activities of the district-level government agencies. Discussions have been held with\nsome national NGOs to determine their interest in participating in the Project for the formation\nand strengthening of farmer groups, and the delivery of extension services. National and\ninternational NGOs have a number of programs and adequate experience in these activities,\nand indicated their willingness to be involved in the Project on a contractual basis. Their view is\nthat they have developed a model that can work and should be applied under their contracts.\nSuch contracts will cover the whole activities from group formation to the delivery of services in\nparticular areas, and will specify the expected outputs. Local NGOs are currently undertaking\nsmaller scale activities in the project area, involving a few farmer groups. These organizations\nmay need to be associated with national NGOs for contracts under the Project so that they can\nalso benefit from capacity-building support of the national NGOs.\n70. Seven major national NGOs are operating agricultural activities in the project area,\nincluding the Center for Environmental and Agricultural Policy, Research, and Development;\nDevelopment  Projects  Service  Center;  Center  for  Self-Help  Development;  Rural\nReconstruction Nepal; Support Activities for Poor Producers of Nepal; Institute for Integrated\nDevelopment Studies; and Rural Self-Reliance Development Center. The size of individual\nprograms  in  a  district  ranges  from  1  to  about  20  village  development  committees.  ADB\nmissions observed a few field activities of some of the NGOs and had discussions with the\nfarmer groups. These farmer groups fully recognize the benefits of the services provided by\nthese NGOs. A large number of local NGOs in the project area are registered with district\nadministrations. The organization and activities of each local NGO should be assessed when it\napplies for participation in the project activities. Private service providers will be required to\nsubmit  externally  audited  financial  statements  during  negotiations  for  contracts  under  the\nProject. Awarding of contracts to private service providers under the Project is subject to ADB's\napproval. In this regard, the PCU will submit to ADB (i) criteria for the selection of private\nservice providers, (ii) their terms of reference, and (iii) evaluation report for the selection.\n71. There is presently no system for farmers to pay from their income for the services\nprovided by private institutions including NGOs. Poor households are not able to pay for the\nextension services. However, even poor farmers are likely to be willing to contribute a part of\ntheir resources if they believe they will benefit. Thus, it is important to build farmers' confidence\nin the quality of the services provided under the Project during the first three years of the\nProject. A cost-sharing system between the Government, local administrations, and farmer\ngroups could be developed during the midterm review for introduction under the Project to\nensure the financial sustainability of the private extension services (para. 76).\n4. Project Performance and Impact Monitoring\n72. The PCU will be responsible for monitoring overall project performance. It will establish\na  central  project  performance  monitoring  system  with  assistance  from  the  project\nimplementation consultants as a part of its management information system linked with the\nPIUs and the NARDF. Appropriate environmental and social impact indicators have been\ndeveloped during project processing and will be used for developing the monitoring system.\nThe monitoring activities will cover the progress of project implementation and the impact of\nproject activities based on the indicators. The NARDF will require the participating institutions\nto report monthly on the progress of research activities financed under the Project. Research\noutputs  and  their  impact  will  be  evaluated  annually  and  recorded  for  overall  project\nperformance monitoring.", "22\n73. Under  the  Project,  pocket  area  profiles  will  be  prepared  using  participatory  rural\nappraisal  techniques  during  social  mobilization  activities.  The  field  teams  will  collect\ninformation on farm households and their socioeconomic conditions, farm area, production,\nquantity and price of produce sold, inputs for agricultural production, gender disaggregated\nbreakdown of labor inputs, and access to inputs. The field teams will be trained initially by the\nimplementation consultants on the methods for developing an appropriate uniform framework\nfor rural appraisal. The PIUs will ensure that the collected information will be stored in a\ncomputerized database and maintained on the performance monitoring system of the Project.\nField teams will ensure that reports in Nepali language generated from the database will be\navailable for periodic reference by farmer groups.\n74. Semiannual  impact  monitoring  will  be  done  through  the  regular  pocket  area-level\nworkshops that will report on improvements in production, marketing, yields, incomes, input\nuse, and postharvesting activities. The first series of these workshops will be commenced\nwithin six months of loan effectiveness. The reporting formats to assess the performance and\nimpact of the Project will be developed at project inception. Enumerators may be recruited by\nthe PIUs as required under the Project. The PCU will ensure that the project performance\nmonitoring system is properly linked to DOA's regular monitoring mechanism.\n5. Project Implementation Schedule\n75. The Project will be implemented over a period of six years from loan effectiveness.\nProject completion is expected in December 2006. Initial activities will include (i) recruitment of\nimplementation  consultants;  (ii)  project  inception  seminars  at  the  regional  level;  (iii)\nestablishment  of  imprest  accounts  for  the  Project;  (iv)  procurement  of  service  vehicles,\nequipment and civil works for PCU and PIUs; (v) recruitment of field teams, team supervisors,\nand private service providers; (vi) selection of production pocket areas to be covered under the\nProject;  (vii)  staff  training;  and  (viii)  establishment  of  the  project  performance  monitoring\nsystem. Project activities will be commenced in four districts each year. During the first year of\nimplementation, project activities for the mobilization of farmer groups and the provision of\nsupport services will be mainly carried out in the hilly areas. Potential private service providers\nwill be identified before project inception so that their field activities can be initiated early in the\nfirst year of the Project. The project implementation schedule is summarized in Appendix 7.\n6. Project Midterm and Completion Reviews\n76. In addition to regular project supervision, the Government and ADB will jointly carry out\na midterm review at the end of the third year of project implementation. Data required for the\nreview should be readily available from the performance monitoring system of the project. The\nreview will cover (i) progress of group formation in pocket areas, (ii) involvement of women and\ndisadvantaged  groups,  (iii)  application  of  improved  technology  and  inputs,  (iv)  level  of\nhousehold incomes, (v) level of production and marketing of secondary crops, (vi) level of\npostharvest operations, (vii) use of rural financial services, (viii) participation and effectiveness\nof private service providers, (ix) progress of research activities funded under the Project, and\n(x) progress in cost recovery for the use of the regional laboratory facilities. During the midterm\nreview, a possible cost-sharing system for the agricultural extension services for farmer groups\nwill be developed for introduction under the Project to ensure the sustainability of project\nactivities. Such cost sharing for the services will be considered among the Government, local", "23\nadministrations, and farmer groups. The project completion review will be undertaken at the\nend of the sixth year of project implementation based on the terms of reference to be agreed\nbetween the Government and ADB.\n7. Procurement\n77. The Project requires the procurement of service vehicles, equipment, and civil works to\nbe  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's Guidelines for Procurement.  Civil  works  to  be\nprocured under the Project are expected to be in small packages costing less than $100,000.\nInternational companies are unlikely to be interested in bidding for these local civil works,\nwhich  will  be  procured  under  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  satisfactory  to  ADB.\nPackages for some service vehicles, which are likely to exceed $100,000 and can be more\neffectively  sourced  from  international  suppliers,  will  be  procured  through  international\nshopping.  Where  appropriate,  procurement  may  be  by  direct  purchase  for  items  below\n$100,000.\n78. A  maintenance  plan  will  be  prepared  for  all  facilities  constructed,  renovated,  or\nupgraded  under  the  Project  before  the  completion  of  such  construction,  renovation,  or\nupgrading. The Government will ensure the provision of adequate budget to implement the\nmaintenance plan. The regional training center in the Far Western Development Region, the\nconsolidated regional laboratory buildings, and the PIU office buildings to be constructed under\nthe Project will be on Government land and will not involve involuntary resettlement. The\nGovernment will also ensure that the buildings constructed, renovated, or upgraded under the\nProject  will  have  appropriate  facilities  to  accommodate  women's  needs,  and  that,  when\nprocuring bicycles, female field staff receive lady's bicycles.\n8. Consulting Services\n79. Under the loan, the Project will finance a total of 20 person-months of international\nconsultants in project management and postharvest operations, and 60 person-months of\ndomestic  consultants  in  performance  monitoring,  agricultural  marketing,  gender  issues,\nenvironment,  and  training.  An  international  consulting  firm  in  association  with  a  qualified\ndomestic firm will be engaged to provide these services. The project management specialist\n(international) will be the team leader. Other than developing the necessary systems and\nprocedures, the major part of the implementation consultants' work will be the successful\ntransfer of skills to the PCU, PIUs, and field staff of the Project and the DADOs. Consulting\nservices  will  be  required  mainly  during  the  first  three  years  of  project  implementation.  If\nproblems occur during the latter part of implementation, additional inputs may be provided on\nan intermittent basis. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of\ndomestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for these consulting services are in\nAppendix 8.\n9. Disbursement\n80. Project funds will be disbursed through DOA's regional and district offices. The PCU\nwill establish an imprest account immediately after loan effectiveness in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The imprest account will be used to pay for civil works,\nlocally purchased vehicles and equipment, contract staff, training, and locally recruited service", "24\nproviders and consultants. An initial amount will be deposited into the account based on the\nprojected expenditures for the next six months. The imprest account will be liquidated and\nreplenished according to ADB's statement of expenditures procedures for contracts below\n$50,000.  No  loan  proceeds  will  be  withdrawn  for  the  component  of  agricultural  research\nactivities until the Government establishes through an executive order a national committee to\nadminister funds for agricultural research and development (para. 53). Disbursement of loan\nproceeds for the component of agricultural research activities will be suspended if the draft bill\nfor the establishment of a fully autonomous NARDF is not approved by the Government for\nsubmission to the Parliament by 31 December 2001.\n10. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n81. The PCU will compile quarterly progress reports on overall project implementation,\nwhich will be submitted to the PSC and ADB before the end of the month following the quarter\nunder review. These reports will have form and detail satisfactory to ADB. An appropriate\nformat will be established at project inception in conjunction with the project performance\nmonitoring system. These reports should cover (i) the progress of project implementation, (ii)\nimplementation  issues  encountered  and  measures  adopted  for  their  resolution,  and  (iii)\nassessment of the project's actual impact against its goals and purposes. The PCU\u2019s quarterly\nprogress  reports  should  also  include  quarterly  information  provided  on  research  activities\nfinanced under the Project.\n82. The PCU will establish and maintain separate accounts for expenditures under the\nProject and have them audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB and in accordance with\nsound auditing principles. All financial transactions for the Project will be recorded separately\nin the project account in a manner that allows identification of expenditures under the Project.\nCertified copies of such audited reports will be submitted to ADB, in English, within 12 months\nafter the end of each fiscal year. To meet these requirements, the PCU will set up a project\naccounting system in accordance with the simplified and integrated project accounting manual\nissued by the Ministry of Finance in September 1995 and its amendments thereafter.\nF.  The Executing Agency\n83. DOA is headed by a director general, who is responsible for implementing MOAC's\npolicies and programs at the field level. DOA has 11 disciplinary divisions, including those for\nagricultural  extension,  market  development,  and  crop  development.  The  five  regional\ndirectorates are responsible for activities in their development regions of the country. They\nprovide DADOs with technical guidance and supervision. The total staff of each district office\nranges between 20 and 45, including subject matter specialists, officers, JTs, and JTAs. JTs\nand JTAs are managing ASCs and ASSCs. In the project area, all positions for the heads of\nDADOs are filled, but the vacant JT and JTA positions must be filled within three months of\nloan effectiveness. The qualifications of the district technical staff, including JTs and JTAs, are\nadequate for project execution.\n84. The main function of DADOs is to disseminate improved agricultural technology among\nfarmer groups by (i) using demonstration kits for on-farm activities \u2014 kits include composite\nvegetable  seed  packets,  fruit  saplings,  and  other  inputs;  (ii)  demonstrating  good  farming\npractices  and  techniques  at  selected  private  farms;  (iii)  conducting  training  programs  for\nfarmers; and (iv) organizing study visits, agricultural fairs, and product contests.  A DADO is", "25\nalso responsible for facilitating access to other support services and inputs, including rural\nfinance and agricultural chemicals. The annual plans and programs of DADOs for providing\nextension services and training are not being properly monitored. Substantial improvements\nare required to make their monitoring activities effective and to increase reliability in their\nprogress reports. These aspects will be examined by the implementation consultants during\nthe first year of the Project.\n85. Despite MOAC's stated strategy for the provision of packaged services and inputs for\nthe selected production pocket areas, essential services and inputs fail to reach farmers as\npackages.  This  is  largely  due  to  the  lack  of  communications  and  coordination  among\nconcerned  line  agencies,  and  often  with  personality  factors.  Annual  programming  and\nbudgeting exercises at the local levels are carried out separately by each agency and mostly\ntend to be dictated by higher authorities. This results in a shortage of resources needed for\npriority areas. During implementation, vertically divided agencies tend to unilaterally implement\ntheir own programs to fulfill their physical and financial targets without close interagency\ncoordination.  The  role  of  the  district  agricultural  development  committees  needs  to  be\nenhanced  for  better  coordination  in  this  regard.  Identification  and  involvement  of  key\nstakeholders in planning and implementation are equally important in generating a true sense\nof  ownership  among  these  stakeholders.  During  the  surveys  conducted  under  the  TA  to\nprepare the Project, JTs and JTAs indicated that they needed increased collaboration with\nother agencies, such as NARC's research stations and rural financial institutions, to help\nprocuring  improved  seeds  and  other  inputs.  Effective  collaboration  among  the  concerned\nagencies at the field level will be enhanced under the Project through the activities of field\nteams, team supervisors, and private service providers.\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environmental Measures\n86. A field survey for an initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out from June\nto July 1999 in the project area. Degradation of soil fertility is an important environmental issue\nrelated to the Project. Maintenance of soil fertility is traditionally left to natural processes and\noften  carried  out  by  farmers  using  farmyard  manure.  With  the  introduction  of  intensified\ncropping,  there  will  be  an  increased  extraction  of  nutrients,  and  the  level  of  fertility\nmaintenance may not be sufficient. Use of chemical fertilizers is likely to increase in the\nproduction  pocket  areas  to  supplement  the  soil  fertility.  Although  the  average  amount  of\nfertilizers used in Nepal is very low at about 30 kilograms per ha, the excessive and improper\nuse  of  chemical  fertilizers  in  some  areas  could  affect  water  bodies,  wetlands,  and  soil.\nIntroduction of an integrated plant nutrient management system will be encouraged under the\nProject  to  avoid  the  excessive  use  of  chemical  fertilizers.  Where  chemical  fertilizers  are\nnecessary,  their  appropriate  use  will  be  promoted  through  training  and  demonstration\nactivities. Under the Project, soil testing kits and soil augers will be procured for ASCs and\nASSCs so that soil samples can be more easily obtained for analysis in the field.\n87. Similarly, soil erosion is a common environmental problem that may be caused by\nincreased development activities in the project area. Soil erosion will have wide environmental\nconsequences,  including  loss  of  fertility  and  frequent  floods,  unless  proper  conservation\nmeasures such as terracing are taken, particularly in the hilly region. Slope, rainfall, vegetation\ncover, and human activities all need to be taken into account for environmental protection", "26\nunder the Project. Training and awareness programs for farmer groups will include the relevant\nsubjects on low-cost soil conservation techniques. The use of chemical pesticides can affect\nthe environment and public health through their adverse impact on soil fauna and micro-\norganisms, by killing untargeted species; and on human, farm animals, and food. Adverse\nimpact  can  arise  from  the  application  of  the  wrong  pesticides,  excessive  amounts,  and\ninappropriate storage; and careless disposal of containers. The inadequate knowledge of\nintegrated pest management will be addressed under the training programs of the Project for\nfarmers and DADO staff.  ADB's Handbook on Incorporation of Integrated Pest Management in\nAgriculture Projects  will  be  used  for  training.  Suitable  courses  will  be  developed  and\nimplemented under the Project in collaboration with DOA's Plant Protection Division and the\nregional plant protection laboratories.\n88. The overall environmental impact of the Project is expected to be positive. Possible\nadverse environmental impacts will be mitigated through the provision of appropriate training\nand  awareness  programs  for  farmer  groups.  Consulting  services  on  environmental\nmanagement will be provided for project management. There is no likelihood of significantly\nnegative environmental impacts that require detailed environmental impact assessment, and\nthe IEE is sufficient for the assessment of the environmental impact expected under the\nProject. IEE is summarized in Appendix 9.\n2.  Social Measures\n89. An initial social assessment was conducted in 10 project districts from March to July\n1999. Five of the districts are in the lowland region, and the other five are in the hilly region.\nHigh  poverty  incidence  exists  in  the  project  area.  The  composite  indexes  of  human\ndevelopment, which reflect life expectancy, adult literacy, mean years of school and per capita\nincome, showed that most districts in the Midwestern and Far Western development regions\nhad indexes substantially below the national average. The gender empowerment measures,\nwhich indicate the degree of gender inequality in important areas of economic and political\nparticipation and decision-making, also fall below the national average.\n90. In the project area, self-employment in agriculture accounts for an estimated 60 percent\nof male employment and 82 percent of female employment. Forty percent of agricultural\nhouseholds have less than 0.5 ha of land and another 26 percent have holdings of 0.5-1.0 ha.\nOperational landholdings are highly fragmented in the hilly region with a farm household\nhaving more than four parcels of land on average. The average size of a parcel is 0.35 ha in\nthe lowland region and just 0.20 ha in the hilly region. Households below the poverty line\nmainly hold less than 1 ha, and farmers with less than 0.5 ha usually cannot meet food\nrequirements of their households. Their economic level also depends on the quality of their\nfarmland  and  access  to  off-farm  employment  opportunities.  About  30  percent  of  farm\nhouseholds in the project area work on rented land along with their own land, and many more\nsharecroppers may not appear in the statistics. Sharecropping is not necessarily a deterrent to\ninvestment in improved agricultural inputs. Several farmers, who are members of the groups\ninterviewed in the project area, are sharecroppers and use improved seeds and chemical\nfertilizers. Sharecropping is also useful where landholdings consist of a number of scattered\nparcels.  A  farmer  may  operate  on  a  piece  of  land  contiguous  to  his  own  under  this\narrangement.", "27\n91. Vegetable  cultivation  has  become  a  very  significant  activity  for  poor  farmers  with\nmarginal  holdings  as  vegetables  can  bring  in  quick  returns  when  marketed  and  provide\nimportant  nutritional  supplements.  The  positive  impact  of  vegetable  production  on  the\nlivelihoods of poor farmers is significant. Farmers usually gain access to knowledge of the\navailability of improved seeds and fertilizer, and market outlets, through their farmer group\nmembers and training programs offered by public extension workers or NGOs. Various groups\nwill  differ  in  the  degree  of  response  to  and  pace  of  adopting  new  ideas.  However,  any\ndemonstrated benefits will gradually reach most members of farmer groups in the production\npocket areas, including landless and marginal farmers.\n92. Women  play  a  major  role  in  agriculture,  particularly  in  vegetable  growing.  The\ntraditional  division  of  labor  has  men  responsible  for  plowing  and  women  for  planting,\ncomposting, weeding, and postharvest activities. Both genders are engaged in harvesting. The\nextent of women's involvement, especially in decision-making for production and marketing,\nvaries  according  to  location,  social  group,  and  scale  of  farm  activities.  Women\u2019s  direct\ninvolvement and responsibility are higher in the hilly region, in middle and lower caste groups,\nand  in  subsistence  farming.  The  gender  issue  in  agriculture  is  whether  women\u2019s  work\ncontribution translates into access to and control over resources in terms of technology and\nincome. For some years, the national policy has been to eliminate obstacles to women\u2019s\nparticipation  in  agricultural  development.  Participation  in  development  should  lead  to\nmainstreaming in terms of recognizing women not just as workers but as key contributors in\nagriculture. The Project will have technical training programs and in-country study tours for\nwomen-only farmer groups, and training programs on gender issues for all farmer groups. To\npromote these activities under the Project, each PIU will have an officer specifically assigned\nto gender-related matters.\n93. Recognizing the increasingly important role in agriculture being played by the private\nsector,  the  Project  will  promote  the  provision  of  private  extension  services.  Initially,\nexperienced  national  NGOs  may  be  engaged  under  the  Project.  Other  potential  service\nproviders  such  as  local  NGOs,  agribusinesses,  agricultural  input  wholesalers,  agriculture\nsupply  shops,  and  universities  will  be  considered  for  participation  during  project\nimplementation. Their capabilities in outreach and competence in group formation and the\ndelivery of extension services will be carefully assessed. Performance monitoring will cover\nindicators for its social impact, including the effectiveness of training and extension services,\nand the gender issues in terms of women\u2019s active participation, capacity development, and\naccess to resources. Qualitative information on these aspects will need to be reflected in\nregular progress reporting. In view of the importance of social dimensions for the Project,\nsocial  aspects  will  be  carefully  monitored  throughout  the  project  period  and  will  form  an\nessential part of project performance monitoring. The social assessment conducted for the\nProject is summarized in Appendix 10.", "28\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Financial and Economic Analyses\n1.  Financial Analysis\na. Outreach\n94. Financial analysis was based on the indicative cropping patterns for the aggregate of\nthe production pocket areas that will benefit under the Project. The benefits included in the\nanalysis were those derived from incremental production of marketable produce and a switch\nto alternative higher value crops. No account was taken of the increased prices that farmers\nmay  obtain  for  their  produce  through  improved  marketing  and  postharvesting  processes,\nalthough these are considered to be substantial. The Project will yield quantifiable direct\nbenefits through pocket area development for 45,300 farmers or about 12 percent of the\nestimated 389,900 farmers in 12 districts.20 The average farm size in the lowland region is 1.4\nha for field crops and 1.0 ha for horticulture. In the hilly region, the average farm size is 0.5 ha\nfor both field and horticultural crops. However, most project beneficiaries are expected to be\nsmall and marginal farmers. Some changes in the cropping patterns of these farmers will be\nintroduced under the Project. In the lowland region, at present, 88 percent of the cropped area\nis for field crops while the remaining area is for horticultural crops. These proportions are\nexpected to change through a reduction in field crops and the increase in horticultural crops in\nthe selected production pocket areas under the Project. In the hilly region, the current use of\n90  percent  for  field  crops  and  10  percent  for  horticulture  will  also  change.  Increases  in\nvegetables and fruits will result largely from shifts out of subsistence-oriented food crops in\nresponse  to  the  increasing  marketing  potential  for  the  secondary  crops.  In  addition,  with\nimproved extension services and the introduction of secondary crops during winter (November-\nFebruary), cropping intensities will increase. The details of financial analysis are included in\nAppendix 11.\n95. Under the Project, farmers will gradually change their cropping patterns with the total\narea of land affected by the Project increasing each year as pocket areas are developed, and\nfarmers utilize project services. New leguminous crops such as peanuts, lentil, and peas, and\nother secondary crops will gradually replace wheat and maize. Particularly in the hilly region,\nthe area currently in millet, maize, and wheat will be converted into a broad range and\nexpanded area of vegetables, including vegetable seeds, and an increased area in citrus fruits.\nThe total area cropped will increase as cropping intensity increases. The impact of farmers'\nadoption of new packages is assumed to be fully realized four years after their introduction.\nb.  Impact on Beneficiaries\n96. Indicative financial crop budgets have been calculated for field crops, vegetables, and\nfruits  for  the  lowland  and  hilly  regions,  and  for  both  without-  and  with-Project  situations.\nRevenues are based on farmgate prices. The with-Project budgets do not include increased\nuse of inputs or higher crop yields as the focus is on crop diversification. The expected\n                                            \n20 Rural households in the project area, excluding municipalities, are estimated at about 487,400, of which 80\npercent are considered to be farmers.", "29\nimprovement in extension services under the Project should ultimately lead to productivity and\nprofit increases but this has not been factored into the budgets, to be conservative in the\nanalysis. Material expenses are defined as those requiring cash, including tractor and pump\nhire, seeds, fertilizers, and crop protection.\n97. Based on these crop budgets, indicative 0.5 ha farm models have been formulated for\nthe lowland and hilly regions to assess possible changes in farm income between the without-\nand  with-Project  situations  (Appendix  11,  Table  A11.4).  There  will  be  a  large  variety  of\ncropping patterns of individual farmers even within each production pocket area. Thus, the\nincome models include all major food and cash crops adopted in these regions to reflect the\nexisting  and  potential  cropping  patterns  of  the  production  pocket  areas.  Based  on  these\nmodels, farmers' net income is expected to increase by about NRs5,300 or 44 percent in the\nlowland  region  mainly  due  to  the  expansion  of  vegetables,  and  by  the  introduction  of\nleguminous  crops.  In  the  hilly  region,  the  net  income  is  expected  to  increase  by  about\nNRs6,300 or 66 percent under the Project. The increase is mainly due to the expansion of\ncash crops with good marketing potential like fresh vegetables, by converting areas previously\nused for millet and wheat production. The gain in net income is higher in the hilly region than in\nthe lowland region because of higher potential for growing horticultural crops in the hills. The\nincome analysis also shows that the return on daily family labor will be substantially higher\nthan the basic wage rate, which is expected to be in the range of NRs50-75. Under the Project,\nfarmers are also expected to change their combination of crops more frequently in response to\nchanges in local market conditions with better access to accurate information on local markets.\n98. Under  the  Project,  the  aggregate  net  income  in  the  205  production  pocket  areas\ncovering an incremental area for secondary crops of about 16,600 ha will increase by NRs230\nmillion ($3.3 million) at full project development. Incremental employment generated will be\nabout 15,300 person-years or 0.34 years per farmer. Whether these benefits accrue to the\nmale or female farmers will be determined during project implementation and depend on the\nsuccess of gender-oriented training programs, but at least 35 percent of these benefits are\nexpected to accrue to women. Discussions in the field suggest that any incremental income is\nwidely regarded as  household income and will improve the well-being of the whole household.\nA positive impact of the Project on the generation of on-farm income earning opportunities will\nreduce migration of male household members seeking work outside the project area.\n99. Based on the financial cash flow for the overall Project, the financial internal rate of\nreturn over 20 years is estimated at 16.1 percent and the financial net present value at a 12\npercent discount rate is NRs214 million ($3.1 million). Sensitivity analyses conducted on cost\noverruns, decrease in benefits, and a combination of the two show the Project to be viable. To\nensure  the  financial  sustainability  of  project  facilities  and  activities  even  after  project\ncompletion, the Government will develop and implement the guidelines for cost recovery for\nthe use of regional laboratory facilities and the maintenance plans for the facilities to be\nconstructed or rehabilitated under the Project. The incremental financial requirements for the\noperation and maintenance of the project facilities will be small, and can be accommodated at\nthe district or regional levels from the annual budget of each DADO, which is about NRs7.5\nmillion ($109,000) on average. During the midterm review, a possible cost-sharing system\namong  the  Government,  local  administration,  and  farmer  groups  will  be  considered  for\nintroduction under the Project for the provision of agricultural extension services for farmer\ngroups (para. 76).", "30\n 2. Economic Analysis\n100. Economic prices were estimated from farm-gate financial prices for outputs and world\nmarket prices of agricultural inputs using a standard conversion factor of 0.9 for nontraded\nitems, and economic budgets were estimated for all of the crops under the with- and without-\nProject situations. With these adjustments, net economic benefits at full project development\nwere estimated at NRs260 million ($3.8 million). Conversion of financial to economic costs\nresults in a substantial reduction in project costs. The economic internal rate of return for the\nProject is estimated at 19.6 percent and the economic net present value is NRs389 million\n($5.6 million) over 20 years. Standard sensitivity analyses show the viability of the Project.\nDetails of the economic analysis are presented in Appendix 11.\n101. All financial benefits will be distributed to farmers and agricultural laborers although a\nmarginal portion of revenue will be recovered from the use of regional laboratory facilities. The\nGovernment will incur all financial costs of the Project. In the Midwestern and Far Western\ndevelopment regions where the Project will be implemented, most farmers are below or near\nthe poverty line. Since at least 50 percent of group members in each pocket area will be from\npoor households, the net present value of total economic gains accruing to poor households\nunder the Project will be NRs525 million ($7.6 million) or NRs11,600 ($168) per household. In\naddition, during the selection of poor farmers for the inclusion in a farmer group, priority will be\ngiven to the disadvantaged members of the local community, in particular the former bonded\nagricultural laborers. These benefits accruing to the rural populations, who are below or near\nthe poverty line, highly justify the Project from a poverty perspective.\nB.  Environment\n102. Project activities are likely to generate a positive environmental impact. The Project will\nresult in increased cropping intensity, which will increase the amount of vegetative cover and\nimprove soil conservation. Various leguminous crops that will be adopted under the Project will\nhelp maintain soil fertility, which is another environmental benefit. Under the Project, integrated\npest  management  and  integrated  plant  nutrition  management  will  be  encouraged  for\nproduction pocket areas. The use of agricultural chemicals is likely to increase particularly for\nhorticultural  crops,  but  the  adverse  environmental  impact  will  be  minimized  through  the\nprovision of appropriate training and awareness programs for farmer groups.\n103. PIUs'  monitoring  officers  will  be  responsible  for  work  activities  on  environmental\nmanagement with a particular emphasis on the provision of adequate information for the\npocket areas to ensure more efficient environmental management. They will also report to the\nPCU about the environmental aspects of the pocket areas and recommend specific measures\nfor improvements. PIUs will regularly monitor the different environmental impacts including (i)\nchanges in vegetative cover in the project area; (ii) soil test records and nutrient level; (iii) type,\nquantity, and method of use of chemical fertilizers; (iv) pollution status including pesticide\nresidue of wetlands; (v) water level of local wells and ponds; (vi) density and discharge of\nshallow tube wells; (vii) the number of farmers receiving environmental training; (viii) erosion\nand landslide incident; (ix) silt accumulation in farmlands; and (x) slope and forest conditions.\nInstitutionalizing these functions into PIUs will ensure that the adverse environmental impacts\nof project activities will be minimized.", "31\nC. Social Dimensions\n1.  Rural Poverty\n104. The Project will address important social issues in the project area. The Project will\nadopt  a  farmer  group  approach,  which  is  well  established  as  an  effective  system  for\nstrengthening the capability of marginal and small farmers, and for the delivery of improved\nagricultural technology and market information. The involvement of private service providers,\nincluding national and local NGOs, will enhance outreach to project beneficiaries. The private\nservice providers to be contracted under the Project have long experience in dealing with small\nand marginal farmers, and supporting weak and disadvantaged groups of people in rural\nareas.\n105. Under the Project, the increased production and marketing of secondary crops will\nprovide farmers with increased cash income. The increased income usually leads to (i) a\nwithdrawal of family members from off-farm casual labor and increased employment on their\nown land, (ii) a shift in diet with more vegetables, (iii) housing improvements with an extra story\nor a corrugated roof, (iv) ability to afford children's school fees right through secondary school,\nand (v) purchase of additional land. In addition to increased cash income for farm households,\nlocal employment opportunities directly linked to agricultural marketing will increase. Small- to\nmedium-scale  farmers  are  responsive  to  new  commercial  opportunities  in  agriculture\nintroduced under the Project. The commercial orientation of the Project will enable farmers,\nwho  can  respond  to  new  opportunities,  to  absorb  and  disseminate  new  information  and\nknowledge among their group members and other farmers in their villages. Farmer groups\nusually include farmers of various landholdings. Poorer and marginal farmers will be gradually\ninvolved in the process once tangible returns from the production and marketing of secondary\ncrops are demonstrated. Effective project implementation is essential to maximize the positive\nimpact of project activities on the reduction of rural poverty.21 In this context, continuous\nmonitoring of project activities needs to be ensured to enhance the project's impact.\n2. Gender and Development\n106. Within farmer groups, the Project will promote women\u2019s participation, involvement in\ndecision-making, and access to increased income. The Project recognizes the important role\nof women farmers in agriculture, and the social and cultural constraints to their effective\ninvolvement in local institutions and economic initiatives. Project components are designed to\nensure women\u2019s active participation in farmer groups, to promote their skills alongside men\u2019s in\nproduction and marketing, and to facilitate their direct access to project benefits. Support\nmeasures have been designed to ensure that capacity building is based on specific needs that\nwomen  have  identified.  These  include  women-only  forums,  development  of  literacy  and\nnumeracy  skills,  and  leadership  training  in  addition  to  the  interventions  that  focus  on\nagriculture and market development.\nD. Risks\n107. Project risks include (i) a policy environment not conducive for the involvement of\nprivate service providers, (ii) weak institutional capability of MOAC and DOA, (iii) shortage of\n                                            \n21The Asian Development Bank. 2000. Nepal: Partnership Agreement on Poverty Reduction between the Asian\nDevelopment Bank and the Government of Nepal, Draft Paper, Manila.", "32\nquality seeds and planting materials, and (iv) unavailability of favorable market outlets. ADB\nhas been engaged in extensive dialogue with the Government for the implementation of a\nmarket-oriented policy for the agriculture sector, in line with the APP. Substantial progress is\nevident in the introduction of important policy and institutional reforms under the ADB-financed\nSecond Agriculture Program (para. 7). However, changes have been rather slow in agricultural\nresearch and extension. Under the Project, the Government is expected to facilitate the private\nsector's initiatives in this area. ADB will continue its policy dialogue in collaboration with other\nexternal funding agencies involved in agricultural research and extension, including the World\nBank and DFID.\n108. Success in effective project implementation significantly depends on the institutional\ncapability of MOAC and DOA. This is well recognized as a major risk for the implementation of\nagriculture projects in Nepal, where the sustainability of the activities and impact of farmer\ngroups are seen to be low. A number of farmer groups were either poorly organized or inactive\ndue to (i) the lack of skills and training among the public extension workers on such specialized\ntasks as group mobilization, (ii) poor management of DOA\u2019s ASCs and ASSCs, and (iii) lack of\nfarmers\u2019 interest in interacting with district extension workers. The DOA's extension staff are\noften young JTs or JTAs, who lack practical experience with farmer groups. Such constraints\nmay be exacerbated by frequent transfers of extension staff, who thus cannot build up local\nknowledge  and  trust  among  farmer  clients.  Under  the  Project,  adequate  support  will  be\nprovided to farmer groups by the field teams, who are recruited from the same locality under\nthe Project. Activities of private service providers will be promoted so that farmer groups will\nhave increased access to marketing information and agricultural technology. Implementation\nconsultants will assist the project management staff in enhancing collaboration between public\nextension staff and private service providers, and institutionalizing these into project activities.\n109. The lack of availability of high quality seeds and planting materials due to the limited\ncapacity of NARC and DOA farms is also a potential risk. This will be addressed under the\nProject by (i) initiating regular seed planning workshops so that public institutions and private\nseed growers and traders are aware of farmers' specific needs for the type and volume of\nseeds, (ii) supporting pocket areas to establish commercial seed farms, and (iii) fostering\nprivate  seed  growers  and  nurseries  through  the  provision  of  training  and  seminars.  The\nfundamental issue of improving NARC's capability to provide an adequate supply of good\nquality seeds with high germination rates is being addressed under the World Bank\u2019s AREP.\n110. The Project has been formulated based on the findings of the TA about the marketing\naspects for secondary crops. Favorable market outlets are available for potential secondary\ncrops to be grown in the project area, if the crops are of adequate quality and are regularly\nsupplied. Based on such assessment, crops with existing and potential markets have been\nrecommended for the study area.

Overview\n1. Important lessons from agriculture projects and programs in Nepal are common across\nprojects with financing from external funding agencies. The Secondary Crops Development\nProject (SCDP)1 financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the ongoing Agricultural\nResearch and Extension Project (AREP) of the World Bank are most relevant to the Project.\nUnder the SCDP, 108 farmer groups were formed with assistance from DOA's junior technical\nassistants  (JTAs)  for  a  relatively  limited  technical  purpose  to  facilitate  the  organization  of\ntraining programs, dissemination of information on technology, and marketing and production of\nseeds.  Groups  were  formed  through  a  process  of  farmer  self-selection  and  participation.\nMembers were encouraged to start group funds, which have been built up mainly through\ncontributions from project activities and partly from member savings. The group fund was used\nfor individual loans and, in a few cases, enterprising group leaders used the fund for collective\nactivities (purchase of equipment and agricultural inputs). However, these farmer groups had\nlimited effectiveness due to (i) weakness because JTAs were not able to provide adequate\nsocial mobilization support; and (ii) lack of effective back-up services by JTAs, including training,\nwhich were often too theoretical and based on group lectures and discussions rather than\npractical demonstrations and follow-up at the field level. Under the AREP of the World Bank,\nsimilar concerns emerged. A number of lessons relevant to the Project also emerged from\nprojects and programs of other funding agencies.2\n2. Under the Project, these common lessons have been fully considered to ensure (i) a\nsense of strong ownership among local communities for project activities through workshops\nwith the prospective beneficiaries, and (ii) the involvement of private service providers for\neffective formation and strengthening of farmer groups. Close monitoring and supervision of\nproject activities will be required during implementation through field team supervisors and\nprivate service providers under the Project. Some of the major findings for lessons learned are\ndescribed below.\nB. Formation of Farmer Groups\n3. Community-based organizations have become central to many development initiatives in\nNepal. They are central to the new paradigm of people-centered development, which aims to\nrespond to the demands of the beneficiaries and be genuinely participatory in that people at the\ncommunity level are organized to be increasingly responsible for planning activities that affect\nthem, and accessing and managing resources for the activities. Consequently, two factors are\nto be taken into account in the process of group formation and development: (i) the need to\naddress issues of social mobilization and local governance, and (ii) the need to focus on specific\ntasks or sets of activities. The main activities around which community groups are organized are\nforestry, irrigation, rural finance, infrastructure maintenance, and agricultural marketing.\n                                                \n1  Loan 964-NEP: Secondary Crops Development Project, for $11.4 million, approved on 27 July 1989.

Effective formation of farmer groups requires time, intensive interaction with farmers,\nand appropriate guidance at the field level. Without such interactions, farmer groups tend to be\ncontrolled and managed by a few elite and powerful members of the community. Some of these\ninfluential people are so powerful that their actions may go against the spirit and purpose of the\ngroup  concept.  Community  leaders  have  limited  skills  in  social  mobilization  and  do  not\nnecessarily respect group bylaws and plan the use of group funds in line with the needs of the\ngroup.\n5. Informal  as  well  as  formal  groups  involved  in  community  management  need  to  be\nprovided with managerial and organizational skills. Lack of training and support hampers the\ngroups\u2019  ability  to  take  more  responsibility  for  group  activities  and  management  of  local\nresources. Devolution of decision-making to groups requires flexibility in program targeting and\nbudgeting. Within the available budget, communities and groups should be setting their own\ntargets, selecting from several technical options. A self-help attitude needs to be generated\namong farmer groups. Groups are not ends in themselves. The purposes of farmer groups must\nbe  clear  and  focused,  and  this  usually  requires  technical  support  for  information  on  input\nsupplies and marketing.\n6. Women must be explicitly identified as full members of community groups along with\ntheir husbands or other male household members. Providing membership on a household\nbasis,  without  explicitly  including  the  women,  limits  their  participation  in  management  and\ndecision-making.  Having  women  as  executive  members  of  a  group  enhances  their  self-\nconfidence and social status and can be effective in introducing a large number of women to\ndecision-making processes. However, this process requires time. They initially need special\ntraining in order to participate more effectively in management. Social preparation programs,\nparticularly on adult literacy and business skills, increase women\u2019s confidence and status when\neffectively implemented. For these reasons, these programs are required at an early stage of\nsocial preparation.\n7. In general, technical staff of Government agencies do not have proper skills, orientation,\nor time to handle the range of social preparation activities initially required at the field level to\ndevelop viable farmer groups, implement participatory interventions, manage conflict resolution,\nand promote accountable leadership. Few such staff are sensitive to the priorities and risk\namong poor households in rural areas. District staff of line agencies are frequently transferred\nand unlikely to be sustained at levels necessary for the intensive extension work required in the\nformation and strengthening of farmer groups. Their area of operations is the provision of\nextension services on technical matters, and they should spend more time on improving their\nown technical knowledge and capabilities, and less on social mobilization activities.\nC. Private Service Providers\n8. Private  service  providers,  including  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  have  an\nimportant role in facilitating group processes, spreading benefits more widely in the community,\ninvolving  target  groups  such  as  women  and  poor  households,  and  negotiating  program\napproaches within the community. Local NGOs may not have the required skills but their\ncapacity  can  be  built  through  long-term  training  and  financial  inputs  from  national  or\ninternational NGOs.\n9. Major  NGOs  have  developed  their  own  systematic  approaches  to  farmer  group\nformation. Their approaches assist the various stages of group development, and aim at group", "46\nAppendix 4, page 3\nsustainability and self-management. Group development also requires technical back up, which\nNGOs increasingly prefer to provide rather than rely on line agencies. With appropriate support,\nfarmer groups are effective in delivering production technology at the grassroots level and can\nbe a focal point for disseminating information on technology and marketing. A Canadian NGO is\ncarrying out such activities in partnership with national and local NGOs. Some major NGOs also\nshow that they can be effective in agricultural extension by providing intensive field-level support\nby trained and motivated staff, over a relatively limited geographical area.\n10. Other  issues  are  emerging  as  NGO  involvement  increases  and  community  groups\nevolve. In particular, due to differences in their approaches and the level of resources, there are\nfew institutional mechanisms for effective cooperation between line agencies and NGOs. Major\nNGOs prefer to operate independently from the line agencies in separately demarcated areas,\nand expect that any collaboration with line agencies has to be on the basis of equal partnership\nand accountability. Government line agencies particularly at the local level often tend not to\nreciprocate  in  terms  of  partnership  and  accountability,  and  they  limit  NGOs'  involvement.\nHowever, there are a few cases of informal arrangements between the district offices of the\nDepartment  of  Agriculture  (DOA)  and  NGOs,  where  collaboration  is  effective  in  providing\ntraining programs. It is thus important to gradually develop collaborative relationships between\ngovernment agencies and private service providers in phases under the Project.\nD. Agricultural Research\n11. The World Bank's AREP has identified some weaknesses in the existing agricultural\nresearch and extension system's development impact and implementation progress. First, there\nis unnecessary duplication of research activities between regional agricultural research stations\nof the National Agricultural Research Council (NARC). This is mainly due to the lack of proper\npolicy and strategy for national agricultural research. There seems to be confusion in NARC\nregarding how the activities of their research stations are to be planned and coordinated.\nSecond, the bottom-up approach in planning of research to meet farmers\u2019 needs is weak. For\nthis purpose, linkages between research and extension exist through regular interactions at\nvillage workshops and regional technical working groups. Increased efforts are required to\nstrengthen these research-extension linkages through the improvement of a holistic approach\ninvolving crops, livestock, agro-forestry, and off-farm activities.\n12. Under the Hill Agriculture Research Project financed by the Government of the United\nKingdom,  a  competitive  funding  system  was  introduced  to  promote  effective  agricultural\nresearch.  In  addition  to  NARC,  other  research  providers,  including  NGOs  and  research\ninstitutes,  are  becoming  involved  in  the  system,  and  other  external  funding  agencies  are\nexpressing interest in contributing to a national fund for agricultural research and development,\nwhich is being established. The competitive funding system has been operational since 1996\nand successfully developed a system to obtain and assess research proposals with assistance\nin  staff  training  and  other  project  inputs.  This  system  can  be  promoted  so  that  a  more\ncoordinated and client-oriented research activities can be done by both public and private\ninstitutes.\n13. Research outcomes are most effectively adopted when all parties are committed to\nchange and have a sense of \"ownership\" of the research and development process. There must\nbe fewer but focused programs, addressing client needs that will quickly bring measurable\nimpact. There is a need to move away from a researcher dominated and Government-fund\ndriven approach to research to a more responsive competitive grant system that involves the\neventual beneficiaries in identifying priority areas, selecting proposals, and financing research.", "47\nAppendix 4, page 4\nThis issue is being considered by an interministerial committee for the establishment of a\nnational research fund.\nE. Marketing and Postharvest Operations\n14. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives does not have adequate resources for\nmarket improvement and rehabilitation. Local resources are required for the maintenance of\nsuch infrastructure. There should be strong local ownership for activities to strengthen market\ninfrastructure by consulting potential market users well before identifying sites and designing\nmarkets. In the past, siting of marketing facilities depended on land availability and was done\nsolely  by  Government  agencies  or  a  district  administration.  The  construction  of  marketing\nfacilities was target oriented rather than led by demand from the potential users. Although the\nmarket center was recommended to be managed by farmer groups, the Government often\nappointed  all  members  of  market  management  committees.  Some  chairpersons  of  these\ncommittees were not from local communities. Farmers and traders were excluded from the\ndecision-making  process  as  market  rules  and  regulations  were  established.3  Thus,  the\ninvolvement of local communities is essential from the initial planning stage for the rehabilitation\nof existing market infrastructure.\n15. In the past, demonstration and service centers were constructed with the intention of\ndemonstrating fruit grading, fruit processing, and jam making to project beneficiaries. These\nfacilities were to be operated under regional food laboratories. The facilities were constructed,\nbut much of the equipment provided was not used apparently because of the lack of personnel\nwho knew how to operate it. The location of these facilities was often not properly planned and,\nas a result, was away from the fruit growing area. Efforts are needed to ensure that adequate\ntrained staff will be available for proposed facilities, and that the facilities are appropriately\nlocated to serve the production area. Under the Project, a postharvest operations specialist will\nbe recruited to assist the project staff in this regard.\n                                                \n3 PCR: NEP 20193: Secondary Crop Development Project, February 1999.", " \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nTable A5.1: Components Project Cost Summary\n(NRs '000) ($ '000)\n% % Total % % Total\nForeign Base Foreign Base\nLocal Foreign Total Exchange Costs Local Foreign Total Exchange Costs\nA.

Introduction\n1. The initial environmental examination (IEE) was conducted from June to July 1999 under\ntechnical assistance financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The IEE report describes\nthe environmental determinants of the project area. The environmental concerns and issues\nrelated to the Project are then identified, and the mitigative measures for possible adverse\nimpacts recommended in the report.\nB. Description of the Environment\n2. The project area is the lowland and hilly regions of 12 districts. The hilly region is a\nbroad zone with altitude ranging from 600 meters (m) to 3,000 m above sea level. This zone is\ncomplex, with low to medium hills and mountains, river valleys, and tectonic valleys. In the hilly\nregion, food crops are grown on leveled or terraced lands mainly along river valleys, slopes, and\nridge  sides.2  Secondary  crops  are  concentrated  on  unirrigated  and  unleveled  slopes.  The\nlowland region in the south has deep alluvial soils deposited by rivers flowing from hills and\nmountains.  The  northern  part  of  the  lowland  region  generally  consists  of  unconsolidated\nmaterials mixed with boulders, pebbles, gravel, and sand making the formation very permeable,\nand has an average gradient of about 2 percent to the south. The southern part of the lowland\nregion is much flatter, marking a change of soil texture to finer particles like clay.\n3. Nepal has a monsoon season from June to September when about 60 to 80 percent of\nthe annual rainfall falls. During the monsoon, the moisture-laden air from the Bay of Bengal\nmoves northwest and enters into the country from the southeast, giving heavy rainfalls. As the\nair  moves  west,  its  moisture  is  gradually  reduced.  Thus,  the  western  part  of  the  country\ngenerally has less rainfall. The postmonsoon period from October to November has the least\namount of precipitation. During winter from December to February, the temperature goes down\nsubstantially and varies with altitude. The premonsoon season from March to May is mostly hot\nand dry. The maximum temperature in the lowland region often exceeds 40 degrees centigrade.\nThese  seasonal  changes  in  climate  and  ecological  differences  between  regions  provide\nopportunities for the production and marketing of a variety of agricultural and horticultural crops\nin Nepal.\nC. Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n4. Positive and negative environmental impacts anticipated during project implementation\nare discussed here and summarized in Table A9. Possible adverse impacts need to be carefully\ndealt with through appropriate mitigative measures under the Project.\n1. Increased Vegetative Cover\n5. Crop cultivation will be intensified in the selected production pocket areas under the\nProject. There will be vegetative cover over a longer period of the year. As new pocket areas\nare identified and added to the Project, the area with vegetative cover will increase further. This\n                                                \n1  TA 3080-NEP: Crop Diversification Project, for $500,000, approved on 1 October 1998.\n2 Farm lands in the hilly and mountainous regions are classified into two types of lands: unirrigated land with\nunleveled slopes where crops requiring no or less irrigation is grown; and irrigated, terraced, and leveled land\nwhere rice and other food crops are grown.", "58\nAppendix 9, page 2\nwill have various environmental benefits, including soil conservation. A number of secondary\ncrops that have been identified for the Project are likely to help maintain the soil fertility by crop\nrotation and adding some nutrients to the soil. Intensified cropping is likely to reduce the\npressure to use marginal lands for growing food crops. However, to realize these environmental\nbenefits, appropriate training programs need to be provided to farmer groups on environmental\nbenefits, and on proper techniques for land preparation and soil conservation techniques.\n2. Use of Chemical Fertilizers\n6. As the crop intensity increases, there will be a pressure on soil nutrients. The use of\nchemical fertilizers is bound to increase since insufficient organic manure is available to provide\nthe needed nutrients. Chemical fertilizers tend to be overused and indiscriminately applied\nbecause  of  the  yield  increases  in  the  short  run.  Indiscriminate  use  of  nitrogenous  and\nphosphatic fertilizers may cause eutrophication and algal blooms in water bodies, affecting the\nquality of water and aquatic life particularly in wetlands. Abundant use of chemical fertilizers\nwithout  appropriate  addition  of  organic  matter  through  recycling  of  crop  residue,  farmyard\nmanure, or compost may harden the soil, and may hasten soil erosion and sedimentation\nprocess.\n7. Depending upon the soil condition and the stage of crop growth, chemical fertilizers\nneed to be used in an appropriate manner in terms of type, quantity, method, and timing. Under\nthe Project, the appropriate use of chemical fertilizers will be encouraged through extension\nservices for farmer groups. Soil sampling and testing will be undertaken in close association\nwith other project activities. Effective monitoring of the use of chemical fertilizers and condition\nof soil fertility in the pocket area will be in place through the district agricultural development\noffices  (DADOs)  with  assistance  from  the  implementation  consultants.  An  integrated\ncombination of organic and chemical fertilizers will be encouraged under the Project, where\norganic matter from recycled crop residue, compost, or farmyard manure will be used with\ninorganic fertilizers as per the requirement of the particular soil to mitigate adverse impact on\nlocal environment and to ensure longer term sustainability of soil fertility.\n3. Use of Chemical Pesticides\n8. To avoid adverse impacts on local environment and human health, the use of chemical\npesticides should be properly controlled under the Project. The improper and indiscriminate use\nof chemical pesticides can (i) affect soil fauna, microorganisms, and untargeted species; (ii)\nresult in pests developing resistance to the pesticides; (iii) cause acute and chronic health\nhazards, including genetic disorders, to human and farm animals; and (iv) increase the amount\nof persistent pesticides, resulting in serious health hazards in the long run. Due to the lack of\nproper knowledge, farmers frequently handle and store chemical pesticides improperly, thus\nincreasing their risk from health hazards. Pesticides and pesticide-treated seeds are often\nstored in places readily accessible to household members, and pesticide containers are often\nimproperly disposed of and are used to store water, oil, or other edibles.\n9. Appropriate and judicious use of chemical pesticides will be encouraged through training\nand awareness programs for farmer groups and extension staff on proper handling of such\npesticides  and  techniques on  integrated  pest  management.  Through  DADOs'  past  training\nprograms, a number of farmer groups are familiar with the techniques for integrated pest\nmanagement such as the use of local plants as insecticides. These training programs will be\nenhanced  under  the  Project.  Under  the  pesticide  act  in  Nepal,  no  extremely  hazardous\npesticides, according to the classification of the World Health Organization, can be registered", "59\nAppendix 9, page 3\nfor use in the country. Twelve highly hazardous pesticides are currently registered with the\nDepartment of Agriculture (DOA); their sale requires official approval of DOA, and they will not\nbe used under the Project.\n4. Groundwater Irrigation\n10. The number of tubewells is expected to increase in the lowland region in the Project\narea. While the Project does not directly finance irrigation development, the formation of farmer\ngroups  and  the  provision  of  extension  services  to  them  will  facilitate  the  installation  or\nrehabilitation of irrigation schemes in the project area. In general, shallow tubewells extract\nwater from unconfined aquifers, which are also the source of water for local ponds, wells and\nsprings. If the rate of extraction is higher than the rate of recharge, the water table will gradually\nlower and water bodies in the area will be reduced. This may adversely affect the water sources\nand aquatic life in the close vicinity of a tubewell.\n11. This adverse impact of groundwater irrigation is likely to occur only where there are too\nmany  tubewells.  The  ground  water  potential  in  the  lowland  region  has  been  adequately\nexamined  and  safe  extraction  levels  established.3  Close  consultation  among  the  project\nimplementation units (PIUs), DADOs, and the Department of Irrigation will be encouraged under\nthe Project through the regional technical working group meetings so that adequate information\non  tubewell  development  will  be  available  for  the  performance  monitoring  activities  of  the\nProject. Other indicators to monitor may be the water levels of local wells, ponds, and wetland\nsites.  PIU  officers  in  charge  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  assess  these  for  their\nenvironmental monitoring with assistance from implementation consultants.\n5. Construction of Buildings and Other Infrastructure\n12. The Project will finance the construction and rehabilitation of buildings and infrastructure\nrequired  for  effective  project  implementation.  The  sites  will  be  selected  during  project\nimplementation through discussions with farmer groups in the concerned area except that sites\nof PIUs will be close to the existing regional DOA offices. No significant environmental impacts\nare anticipated from these activities. The only activity that may have some adverse impact will\nbe the rehabilitation of local collection centers and village markets, where the gathering of a\nlarge number of people may increase the local volume of wastes because sanitation facilities\nand water supply are not usually adequate at such facilities. Adequate provision of sanitary\nfacilities and safe water should be made a compulsory element in planning and designing local\ncollection  centers  and  village  markets.  The  extraction  of  construction  materials  should  be\nmonitored at the source during the construction of these facilities, to minimize any adverse\nimpacts  such  as  over-extraction  of  local  construction  materials,  which  can  affect  riverine\nenvironments or cause landslides and erosion.\nD. Institutional Requirements and Environmental Program\n13. Nepal's Ministry of Population and Environment is responsible for the policy formulation\nand  related  matters  for  environmental  protection  and  management.  The  Environmental\nConservation Act, 1997 is the umbrella act for environmental regulations. In July 1997, the\nMinistry of Population and Environment issued the Environmental Conservation Rules, 1997,\nwhich list projects with IEE requirements by type and scale. The list mainly includes major\n                                                \n3 Department  of  Irrigation,  His  Majesty's  Government  of  Nepal.  1994.

The small-scale agricultural production and marketing to be supported\nunder the Project are not included. However, these environmental aspects will be monitored by\nPIUs based on information given by the field staff and the private service providers recruited\nunder the Project. Indicative environmental monitoring indicators have been developed and will\nbe used for developing the monitoring system for the Project. These will be included in the\nperformance monitoring system to be established under the Project with assistance from the\nimplementation consultants. The list given is not meant to be exhaustive, and PIUs may identify\nadditional  indicators  and  develop  detailed  monitoring  procedures  pertaining  to  different\nenvironmental aspects.\n14. DOA, the proposed executing agency for the Project, does not have a special unit to\noversee environmental aspects of DOA activities. However, DOA's Plant Protection Division is\nresponsible for the registration of chemical pesticides, training on pest management, and other\nrelated matters. The Plant Protection Division will be involved in planning and organizing the\ntraining programs and environmental monitoring under the Project.\nE. Findings and Recommendations\n15. Overall, the environmental impact of the Project is expected to be positive. The main\nthrust of the Project is to promote the production and marketing of potential secondary crops.\nIncreased vegetative cover is expected under the Project, generating positive environmental\nimpacts.  Measures  are  required  to  prevent  or  mitigate  some  possible  moderate  or  minor\nadverse environmental impacts. Therefore, the Project will set up environmental desks in the\nPIUs and establish environmental monitoring systems and procedures. The implementation\nconsultant will assist PIUs with these activities.\nF. Conclusion\n16. No significant adverse impact on environment is anticipated under the Project. Thus, this\nIEE is sufficient for environmental assessment of the Project. However, the Project requires\nregular and systematic environmental monitoring, and training and awareness programs on\nenvironmental management for farmer groups and extension staff, to ensure that possible\nadverse impacts are avoided or minimized.", "61\nAppendix 9, page 5\nTable A9.1: Summary of Possible Environmental Impacts and Mitigative Measures\nActions Possible Impact and Mitigative Measures Degree of\nSignificance\nOrganizing and training farmers (i)  Enhancement of vegetative cover in the Highly positive\nproject area\n(ii)  Maintenance of soil fertility Moderately positive\nUse of chemical fertilizers (i)  Eutrophication  of  water  bodies  and Moderately negative\nwetlands\n(ii)  Hardening of soil Minor negative\n(iii) Hastening of erosion process Minor negative\nMitigation:\n(i)  Use of chemical fertilizer to be based\non soil tests\n(ii)  Promoting  integrated  plant  nutrition\nmanagement\nUse of chemical pesticides (i)  Biodiversity loss Moderately negative\n(ii)  Local ecosystem disruption Minor negative\n(iii) Pollution of local water Moderately negative\nMitigation:\n(i)  Controlled distribution of chemical\npesticides\n(ii)  Training for farmers and extension\nagents on integrated pest\nmanagement\n(iii)  Effective monitoring of the use of\nchemical pesticides\nGroundwater irrigation schemes Lowering  of  water  table  adversely  affecting Moderately negative\nlocal aquatic life\nMitigation:\nMonitoring the tubewell density\nConstruction and rehabilitation of (i)  Pollution due to congregation of people Minor negative\nbuildings and structures, including (ii)  Over-extraction  of  local  construction Minor negative\nagricultural service centers and materials like sand, stone, etc.\nsubcenters, collection centers,\nvillage market facilities, and Mitigation:\ndistrict office buildings (i)  Provide adequate sanitary provisions\nin planning these facilities\n(ii)  Monitor the use of construction\nmaterial", "62\nAppendix 10, page 1\nSUMMARY SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\nA.  Introduction\n1. An initial social assessment was conducted in 10 districts included in the project area.1\nThe survey conducted under the project preparatory technical assistance2 was supplemented by\nfield visits during the February 2000 loan fact-finding mission of the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB). Discussions were held with the staff of the district agricultural development offices\n(DADOs),  farmer  groups,  private  traders,  agriculture  supply  shops,  and  local  and  national\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) working in the project area.\nB. Poverty Profile\n2. Poverty incidence is substantially higher in the project area than the national average.\nAccording  to  the  human  development  indexes  (HDIs)  estimated  by  the  United  Nations\nDevelopment Programme for 1996, the average HDIs for the districts of the Midwestern and Far\nWestern development regions were estimated at 0.286 and 0.276, or 85 and 88 percent,\nrespectively of the national average (0.325). The HDIs of other development regions in the\ncountry are all higher than the national average. The gender development index based on the\ngender empowerment measures was 0.267 for Nepal, which was substantially lower than the\naverage for developing countries of 0.323. The gender indexes for the Midwestern and Far\nWestern  development  regions  were  even  lower  than  the  national  average.  The  highest\nincidence of malnutrition is noted in the Far Western development region.\n3. The country's population comprises about 60 ethnic and caste groups. The hilly districts\nin the Midwestern and Far Western regions are dominated by the Brahmin, Chettri, and Thakuri\ncastes, and to a lesser extent by the Gurung, Magar, Newar, and Sherpa ethnic groups. The\ndominant  caste  groups  in  the  lowland  region  are  Ahir,  Rajbansi,  and  Yadav  castes.\nOccupational groups such as Damai, Kami, and Sarki castes are found in both hilly and lowland\nregions. The incidence of poverty is highest among these occupational castes, being estimated\nat more than 60 percent.\n4. Farmers with small and marginal landholdings constitute the majority of farmers in the\nproject  area.  Their  landholdings  are  highly  fragmented  mainly  due  to  the  long  practice  of\ndividing property when it is inherited. About 40 percent of agricultural households have less than\n0.5  hectares  (ha)  and  26  percent  have  between  0.5  and  1.0  ha.3  The  average  size  of\nlandholdings is 1.3 ha in the lowland region and 0.9 ha in the hilly region. Farmers without\nadequate flat and irrigated land usually cannot produce sufficient food for their household's\nconsumption, and farmers with less than 0.5 ha cannot meet food requirements of a family with\nabout five members. These poor households usually need to supplement their income through\nlocal seasonal labor or temporary migration. Migration of males to other parts of the country or\nto India for off-farm income is very common in the project area.\n5. Official statistics on land tenancy show that only 5 percent of farm households work on\nrented  land  as  tenants.  However,  this  substantially  underestimates  the  actual  situation  of\nlandlessness, as many tenants and sharecroppers are unregistered. Landowners shift their\ntenants from plot to plot each year to prevent tenants from being registered and obtaining\n                                                \n1 Banke, Bardiya, Dang, and Surkhet districts in the Midwestern Development Region; and Achham, Dadeldhura,\nDarchula, Doti, Kailali, and Kanchanpur districts in the Far Western Development Region.\n2 TA 3080-NEP: Crop Diversification Project, for $500,000, approved on 1 October 1998.\n3 Central Bureau of Statistics. 1997. Nepal Living Standards Survey Report 1996. Kathmandu.", "63\nAppendix 10, page 2\npermanent rights to the land. Sharecroppers have the legal right to be registered as tenants\nafter one season. This does not usually happen in western Nepal, where sharecroppers are not\nfully aware of such rights. Even if they are aware of such rights, they are often not able or willing\nto use them due to social constraints.\n6. Under the most common practice of sharecropping, the tenant, whether registered or\nunregistered, works on the land in return for half of the harvest. The lowland region of the\nproject area has about 18,000 households who were formerly debt-bonded agricultural laborers\nand are mainly from the occupational castes of Chamar, Dom, Dusadh, and Musahar groups.\nLandowners charged high interest rates, often as high as 10 percent per month, for their loans\nso that their laborers continued to work under their control. These bonded laborers were given\nlittle wage and food, and were required to do a variety of jobs throughout the year. Their debts\nwere estimated to range from NRs3,000 ($43) to NRs9,000 ($130).4  The bonded laborers could\nbe sold to another landowner, who would pay their debt. In July 2000, the Government decided\nto ban the bonded labor practice, and the relevant bill is being reviewed by the Parliament for\nenactment.  Parliament  is  in  favor  of  the  bill.  The  issue  now  is  to  provide  the  officially\nemancipated laborers with adequate support for social awareness and economic means for self-\nconfidence and self-reliance.\nC. Gender and  Agriculture Development\n7. The  gender  issue  in  agriculture  development  is  whether  women\u2019s  contribution  in\nagricultural production can be translated into their having access to and control over income and\nresources such as technology and inputs. In Nepal, such access and control are constrained\nthrough a number of practices and social conditions.  Men are traditionally responsible for\nplowing and women for the ensuing tasks of planting, composting, weeding, and postharvest\nactivities. Women are the main decision-makers for these activities. Harvesting is usually done\nby all family members. It is estimated that women\u2019s contribution to crop production in terms of\ntime and efforts is about half or less, and their contribution to kitchen gardening and ginger\nproduction is more than 70 percent.5\n8. In the project area, men as household heads, generally control resources, including\nland, labor, and cash. Women's access to such resources is more restricted in the lowland\nregion where attitudes to gender issues are more conservative. Men generally control marketing\nof agricultural surplus and the income gained from the sale of the surplus. Women are usually\nresponsible for the production and application of organic manure. Men also have control over\nthe  purchase  of  chemical  fertilizers  and  improved  seeds.  At  local  markets,  women  sell\nagricultural and vegetable products, and visit agriculture supply shops to purchase inputs and\nreceive advice. During group discussions, women stated that the major reasons for not being\ninvolved in buying agricultural inputs were (i) lack of knowledge on which variety to buy, (ii) fear\nof being cheated as they are often unable to read the labels, and (iii) distance  from the nearest\nshop. Women members of farmer groups are however more able to access improved seeds by\nplacing orders through the male members of their groups. Similarly, by being a member of a\nfarmer group, a woman increases her chance of accessing training opportunities. Such training\nincreases women\u2019s effectiveness but does not necessarily ensure access to or control over the\ncash income that results.\n9. For the last five years, the Government officially committed to increase efforts to bring\nwomen  into  the  mainstream  of  economic  activity  by  providing  them  access  to  training\n                                                \n4  Ministry of Labor. 1995.

Gender Issues in Nepali Agriculture: A Review, Winrock International, Kathmandu.", "64\nAppendix 10, page 3\nopportunities  and  participation  in  farmer  groups.  For  instance,  the  Women  Farmers\nDevelopment  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Cooperatives  (MOAC)  sets  target\nfigures for the proportion of women in farmer groups, the number of women\u2019s groups, and the\nnumber of women receiving training and awareness programs. Women-only farmer groups are\nincreasingly formed around specific crops such as ginger, vegetables, and mushrooms. Such\nMOAC initiatives, have brought some changes in the attitude among the agricultural extension\nstaff, diminishing their opposition to the idea of women's involvement. All the district extension\nstaff now say that, because women who are mostly engaged in farm production, particularly of\nsecondary crops production, it is important to promote women's participation in training and field\nextension. And, NGOs are providing a growing number of agricultural training programs that\ntarget rural women for the provision of microcredit based on joint liability.\nD. Linkage with NGOs\n10. In the project area, local and national NGOs are implementing agricultural training and\nextension programs. They are particularly encouraging the participation of rural women and\ndisadvantaged groups of people. NGOs' activities vary widely in their scope, scale, agenda, and\neffectiveness.  Successful  NGOs  are  effective  in  forming  and  strengthening  farmer  groups,\nproviding social preparation and income-generating programs, and providing intensive follow-up\nwith technical support and guidance.6 The relationship between these NGOs and the public\nextension staff of DADOs varies in the project area. For instance, DADO staff in Surkhet District\nhave good collaboration with NGOs working in the district while in other districts there is little\ncooperation. During a series of discussions with NGOs, they noted that they generally can work\neffectively in specific areas that are geographically demarcated and separated from DADOs'\nactivities.  However,  the  number  of  local  and  national  NGOs  that  can  carry  out  and  are\nexperienced in these activities is limited. The production pocket areas under the Project cannot\nbe covered by NGOs and other private service providers alone. The provision of extension\nservices by private service providers can be initiated and promoted under the Project in some\npocket areas while other areas can be covered by the DADOs' extension staff. Coordination\nbetween them should be maintained at working group meetings at the regional and district\nlevels.\nE. Social Aspects in the Project Design\n1. Intensive Support for Farmer Groups\n11. Intensive support and guidance for farmer groups is particularly important at the initial\nstage of project activities. The role of field teams will be important in this regard. DADO staff are\ntechnical people, and they are not effective in institutional or social development programs. The\nprovision of proper leadership training for leading farmers will be also effective to strengthen the\ngroups. Special focus and attention on weaker groups and farmers are required. During the first\nthree years of the Project, farmer groups will be provided with training programs on group\nmanagement and collective activities. Groups can be formed or strengthened very quickly when\ngroup members see the chance for better access to increased resources and opportunities. The\nestablishment of group savings and provision of individual loans may be the useful first step for\nstrengthening farmer groups, which will lead to collective actions, such as, for the purchase of\nquality seeds and other inputs.\n                                                \n6 In general, NGOs' extension staff have a more intensive coverage with two junior technical assistants for one\nvillage development committee while one junior technical assistant of a DADO covers about 3 village development\ncommittees.", "65\nAppendix 10, page 4\n2. Women\u2019s Proactive Involvement in the Mainstream\n12. The  prevalent  tradition-bound  gender  imbalance  is  reflected  in  a  fairly  widespread\ndichotomy  between  the  private  or  home-based  role  and  the  public  or  outside  role.  This\ndichotomy is seen, on the one hand, in a rural women\u2019s heavy workload in domestic tasks and\nin some activities of agriculture, and her limited access to opportunities outside the home for\nself-development like literacy, wage employment, or political activities. The counterpart is seen\nin men\u2019s greater mobility and access to opportunities outside home. It is also seen in men\u2019s\ndomination of line agencies of the Government, and in men\u2019s domination of farmer group\nactivities at the village level. To counteract this, the Government in their medium- and long-term\nplans (para. 9), made policy statements for increased women's participation. Setting targets,\nalthough  not  a  solution,  is  one  strategy  to  promote  women's  involvement  in  formal  local\norganizations. Under the MOAC's policy, at least 35 percent of farmer group members need to\nbe women. A higher proportion of women's participation will be encouraged in the training and\nawareness programs organized under the Program.\n13. A  genuine  approach  to  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  proactive  involvement  in  the\nmainstream  in  terms  of  access  to  information,  technology,  and  cash  income  requires  an\nintegrated intervention based on an understanding of women\u2019s needs and men\u2019s mindsets. A\nnumber  of  lessons  are  emerging  from  programs  of  NGOs  and  bilateral  agencies  that  are\nworking  effectively  with  women  in  economic  activities.  These  lessons  indicate  that  (i)\nachievement of gender equity and women's economic empowerment take time and effort; (ii) it\nis essential to educate men to change their attitudes to gender issues; (iii) women-only groups\nare effective since mixed groups tend to be dominated by men, particularly in the lowland\nregion; (iv) women-only groups easily help increase women's self-confidence and leadership\nskills, and facilitate integrated interventions such as literacy, numeracy, savings and credit,\nclean drinking water, and nutritional education; and (v) women learn fast through exposure to\noutside institutions, seeing how the market works, and interaction with other women\u2019s groups.\n14. The Project will need to support specific measures to identify activities around which\nwomen-only groups or subgroups may be effectively organized for women to develop the\ncapability and confidence to contribute to decision making, manage operations effectively, and\naccess  the  benefits  directly.  These  measures  will  facilitate  women's  involvement  in  the\nmainstream in development. In this context, gender training and awareness programs will be\norganized under the Project at the regional and district levels, and field teams will include\nwomen  staff  working  with  farmer  groups.  To  guide  and  facilitate  this  process,  an  officer\nresponsible for gender aspects will be assigned to each regional PIU and will be assisted by a\ngender consultant during project implementation.\n3. Role of NGOs\n15. In Nepal, the NGO sector is becoming increasingly important in supporting programs for\npoverty reduction and social development. The Government recognizes the potential of NGO\nprograms.7 The potential strengths of NGOs lie in their ability to invest time in gaining the\nconfidence of the community for subsequent social mobilization processes. NGOs have varied\nlevels  of  outreach  and  competence.  The  national  NGOs,  based  in  Kathmandu,  adopt  an\nincreasingly professional approach undertaking large-scale programs in a number of districts,\noften supplanting rather than supplementing the Government line agencies. The strengths of\nnational  NGOs  lie  in  their  outreach,  results-oriented  approach,  technical  competence  and\n                                                \n7 National  Planning  Commission,  His  Majesty's  Government  of  Nepal.  1998.  Approach to the Ninth Plan,\nKathmandu.", "66\nAppendix 10, page 5\ncapacity to learn, and ability to train and motivate field level staff. These national NGOs usually\nhave local NGOs or community-based organizations as their associates to expand outreach,\nand provide local associates with capacity-building support.\n16. Local NGOs operate in a small geographical area. Their strengths lie in familiarity with\nlocal conditions and people, close contact with local communities, high levels of trust gained\namong local people, and fluency in the local language. Based on their strengths, some NGOs\ncan be effectively involved in the Project. NGOs must be carefully selected based on criteria to\nbe agreed among the Government, NGOs, and ADB. NGOs will be most effective if they are\ninvolved from the initial stage of the formation and strengthening of farmer groups.\n4. Role of Other Private Service Providers\n17. Farmers used to depend solely on DADOs' staff and public corporations for seeds,\nfertilizers, and pesticides. However, an increasingly important role is being played now by local\nagricultural supply shops. In areas where the agricultural input business is growing, particularly\nin the lowland region, agriculture supply shops and other private traders are emerging as\nimportant links in the supply and in the information chain. When farmers visit their shops,\nfarmers  are  not  clearly  aware  of  which  brands  of  seeds  or  fertilizers  to  order  or  of  the\ninstructions for use in terms of quantity and timing. They usually depend on the traders' advice\nand guidance as to what is appropriate and what represents value for money. The shops now\nknow that it is in their own interests to provide useful and accurate advice, if they want to\nestablish a good reputation and build up their business. It is therefore important to link these\nprivate service providers with the Project by collaborating with them for relevant information,\nguiding them in their purchase of supplies, and facilitating links with farmer groups. The linkage\nwill include women. Agriculture supply shops are often family businesses in which men usually\nhandle supplies, and women are also active in managing the shop and interacting with women\ncustomers.\nF. Conclusion\n18. Based on the initial social assessment, the Project has incorporated important social\naspects  into  its  design  by  including  special  features  and  measures  in  the  scope  and\nimplementation  arrangements.  However,  it  is  essential  to  ensure  that  these  measures  will\neffectively achieve the social objectives of the Project during implementation. Thus, the social\nimpact must be monitored properly through appropriate indicators. Monitoring of the Project\nneeds to go well beyond the mere recording of inputs and activities. The indicative indicators will\ninclude  (i)  the  effectiveness  of  training  and  extension  services;  (ii)  group  performance\nappropriate to different stages of organizational development; (iii) progress in gender aspects in\nterms of women\u2019s participation, capacity development, and access to markets and cash income;\nand (iv) effective measures to ensure equity in access to project benefits with a view to group\ndifferentials. Qualitative and usable monitoring cannot be left to DADO staff alone. Participatory\nmonitoring techniques involving farmers should be introduced and promoted. This process will\nbe assisted by the implementation consultant responsible for the gender aspect.", "67\nAppendix 11, page 1\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\nA. Assumptions\n1. Financial  and  economic  analyses  were  undertaken  for  the  Project  based  on  the\nindicative  cropping  patterns  in  the  production  pocket  areas  and  the  aggregate  costs  and\nbenefits generated under the Project. Prices used were those prevailing during fact-finding in\nFebruary 2000 in the project area. It is assumed that the current Government policies will\ncontinue for the foreseeable future, and general inflation relating to project inputs and outputs is\nnot expected to have a significant impact on changes in relative prices. The basic data and\ninformation for the analyses were collected in the districts of the Midwestern and Far Western\ndevelopment regions during the field visits made in conjunction with the social surveys for the\nProject. The data and information for typical cropping patterns and farm households in lowland\nand hilly regions were prepared to construct crop and farm budgets for the project area. Thus,\nfarm inputs and outputs are considered to reflect the actual situation among farm households in\nthe project area.\n2. The economic life of the Project is assumed to be 20 years. The impact of farmers'\nadoption of new technology and input packages will gradually increase until it is fully realized\nfour years after the introduction of the packages. In addition to the farmers, who directly benefit\nfrom the provision of training and extension services in the selected production pocket areas,\nthe remaining farmers in the project area, and, to a lesser extent, those in other districts in the\nMidwestern and Far Western development regions, will receive substantial unquantified benefits\nfrom the demonstration effects of the production pocket areas, the strengthening of the district\nagriculture development offices and agricultural service centers and subservice centers, and the\nimprovement of regional facilities.\n3. The Project will cover 12 districts, including 5 lowland and 7 hilly districts, containing 552\nvillage development committees (VDCs) in rural areas. The project area will include about 205\npocket areas. It is assumed that, in the lowland region, 60 pocket areas with 30,000 farmers will\nbe in intensive cropping for field crops, while 40 pocket areas with 3,000 farmers will be involved\nin fruit and vegetable crops (Table A11.1). The average farm size in the lowland region will be\n1.4 hectares (ha) for field crops and 1.0 ha for horticulture. In the hilly region, 25 pocket areas\nwith 7,500 farmers will be for field crops, and there will be 80 pocket areas with 4,800 farmers in\nhorticultural crops. The average hill farm size for both field and horticultural crops is 0.5 ha.\nAssuming that there are two pocket areas per VDC in the hilly region and one in the lowland\nregion, the Project will reach about 28 percent of VDCs in the area.\nB. Cropping Patterns\n4. Cropping patterns will change with the Project. In the lowland region, 87.5 percent of the\ncultivated land is in field crops and 12.5 percent in horticultural crops. These proportions will\nchange to about 65 percent and 35 percent, respectively. In the hilly region, the proportions of\n90 percent in field crops and 10 percent in vegetables and fruits will also change in a pattern\nsimilar to the lowland region. These changes are estimated based on the field surveys in the\nproject area. Increases in vegetables and fruits will result largely from shifts out of cereal crops.\nIn addition, with improved extension services, cropping intensities will increase from 179 percent\nto 214 percent in the lowland region, and from 177 percent to 194 percent in the hills.\n5. Under the Project, farmers are expected to gradually change their cropping patterns,\nwith the total area of land affected by the Project increasing each year as pocket areas are", "68\nAppendix 11, page 2\ndeveloped and farmers utilize project services. In the lowland region, new leguminous crops\nsuch  as  peanut,  lentil,  chickpea,  and  grass  pea,  and  increased  areas  in  other  field  and\nhorticultural crops will gradually replace cereal crops. In the hilly region, the area currently\ncropped with millet, maize, and wheat, will be converted into a broader range and expanded\narea of vegetables and citrus fruits. Farmers are expected to change their combinations of cash\ncrops frequently in response to changes in local market conditions. With improved access to\ntraders and market information under the Project, farmers and their farmer groups will be able to\nmake such decisions based on more accurate information on market conditions.\nC. Crop Budgets\n6. Indicative crop budgets have been established for field crops, vegetables, and fruits in\nthe project area for both the with- and without-Project scenarios. Revenues are based on\nfarmgate prices. The production costs and revenues based on these crop budgets are used to\nestimate the aggregate costs and revenues for the Project (Tables A11.2 and A11.3). The with-\nProject budgets do not include higher crop yields or increased use of inputs for the same crop,\nas the focus is on crop diversification and many of the crops may be new to project farmers.\nImproved  extension  services  are  expected  to  result  in  crop  diversification  and  increased\nintensity in land use. Labor cost varies in the range of about NRs50-75 per day depending on\nseason  and  locality.  Labor  cost  is  rather  low  during  the  winter  season  and  increases\nsubstantially during the harvest season due to labor shortage. Net return per hectare generated\nfrom the farm budgets is total revenue less all operating expenses excluding the cost of family\nlabor. For field crops in the lowland region, the expected range in net incomes is estimated to\nvary  from  NRs4,474/ha  (maize)  to  NRs57,321/ha  (potato),  and,  in  the  hilly  region,  from\nNRs3,640/ha (maize) to NRs88,253/ha (ginger). For vegetable crops in the lowland region, the\nrange in net income is from NRs27,993/ha (pointed gourds) to NRs55,704/ha (cucumber) and in\nthe hills from NRs10,858/ha (cabbage) to NRs50,760/ha (chili).\n7. Material expenses are the costs that require financing out of equity or debt resources. In\nthe lowland region, there are 16 indicative crops of which 3 (bananas, potatoes, and pointed\ngourds) have average material costs of NRs32,800/ha, 5 crops with an average NRs13,980/ha,\nand 8 with an average NRs3,470/ha. In the hills, there are 25 indicative crops of which 2\n(potatoes and ginger) have material costs averaging NRs30,000/ha, 14 average NRs16,300/ha,\nand 9 averaging NRs2,000/ha.\nD. Financial Analysis\n8. There are a large variety of cropping patterns among individual farmers even within each\nproduction pocket area. To assess possible changes in farmers' income between the without-\nand with-Project situations, indicative models have been formulated for a 0.5 ha farm in the\nlowland and hilly regions (Table A11.4). These models include all major food and cash crops\nadopted in these regions to reflect the existing and potential cropping patterns of the production\npocket areas. Although the models include a wide range of crops, each farmer is expected to\nspecialize in only a few crops.\n9. It is assumed that the areas for rice cultivation remain the same even after the Project is\nimplemented in view of the importance farmers attach to their food security. In the lowland\nregion,  an  increase  in  the  farmers'  net  income  is  expected  from  the  introduction  of  new\nleguminous crops and the expansion of other cash crops, including sunflower and vegetables.\nThe cultivation of sunflowers with the use of improved varieties has been recently introduced\nand expanded in Kailali and Kanchanpur districts in the Far Western Development Region.\nVegetables popular in the lowland districts include cauliflower, gourds, and tomatoes. In the hilly", "69\nAppendix 11, page 3\nregion,  the  conversion  of  areas  from  cereal  crops  like  millet  and  maize  into  a  range  of\nvegetables and citrus fruits may lead to a substantial increase in cash income. Some farmers in\nthe hilly region, who were interviewed during project processing, marketed fresh vegetables in\nthe border towns in the lowland region and easily doubled their cash income.\n10. The income analysis shows that the present net income of about NRs12,100 under the\nwithout-Project situation will increase to about NRs17,400 or by 44 percent under the Project.\nThis increase is largely brought about by the expansion of vegetable production, and by the\nintroduction of leguminous crops. As important items of agricultural exports to the Indian market,\nmany farmers in the lowland region grow lentils and peas. In the hilly region, the net income is\nexpected to increase from about NRs9,500 in the without-Project situation to about NRs15,800,\nor by 66 percent, under the Project. The increase is mainly due to the expansion of cash crops\nwith good marketing potential like fresh vegetables, by converting areas used for millet and\nwheat production. The returns on investment in two typical multiyear fruit crops, including\nbanana for the lowland region and citrus fruits for the hilly region, were separately estimated\nbased on their flows of production costs and revenue. The analysis estimates that the financial\nrate of return for banana cultivation at 51 percent and that for citrus fruits at 26 percent. The\nanalysis also shows that the return on the daily family labor will be substantially higher than the\nbasic wage rate, which is expected to be in the range of NRs50-75.\n11. The aggregate incremental net income has also been estimated for the production\npocket areas as a whole. As a result of crop diversification, consolidated net financial income\nincreases by NRs230 million ($3.3 million) from the eighth year onwards. The gain in net income\nin the hilly region is higher than that for the lowland region because of higher potential for\ngrowing horticultural crops in the hilly region.\n12. Overall project costs include investment and recurrent costs for the project activities over\na period of six years. The recurrent expenditures include costs for repairs and maintenance of\nbuildings, vehicles, and equipment purchased under the Project, and are carried on beyond the\nProject at the annual rate of 2.5 percent of cost for buildings and 5 percent for vehicles,\nfurniture, and equipment. The financial internal rate of return for the Project over 20 years is\nestimated at 16.1 percent and the financial net present value at a 12 percent discount rate is\nNRs214 million ($3.1 million).\nE. Economic Analysis\n13. Economic prices of outputs are estimated at their border price less duties and taxes\nsuch as the value added tax at a flat rate of 10 percent on incremental value added at each\nprocessing stage. The full foreign exchange cost of the balance plus non-foreign exchange cost\n(i.e.,  Nepalese  rupee  costs  such  as  port  handling,  transport,  and  labor  associated  with\nnontradable  items)  then  comprises  the  economic  price.  The  nontradable  items,  including\ntransportation costs and labor, are converted into economic prices with the use of the standard\nconversion factor of 0.9 as generally adopted for project analysis in Nepal.\n14. Farmgate fertilizer costs used in the crop budgets are based on the cessation of all\nsubsidies from 1 November 1999, and fertilizer prices for the year 2000 forecast by the World\nBank at constant 1999 prices. Economic prices exclude taxes and are based on the standard\nconversion  factor  on  non-foreign  exchange  costs  after  the  deduction  of  taxes.  Transport\nexpenses were calculated for the lowland region and for the hilly region separately. Costs are\nbased on actual freight charges for a range of lowland and hilly locations and destinations. The\ncost per load is NRs858 in the lowland region and NRs1,855 in the hilly region. Unit transport\ncosts in the lowland region is NRs2.2 per ton per kilometer (km) and NRs3.5 per ton/km in the", "70\nAppendix 11, page 4\nhilly region. Project vehicle operations and maintenance costs are NRs10/km, NRs300,000 per\nvehicle per year, with foreign exchange cost at 70 percent, local cost 10 percent, and taxes at\n20 percent.\n15. The net economic benefits form the eighth year were estimated at NRs260 million ($3.8\nmillion). Conversion of financial to economic costs results in a reduction in project costs by\nabout 10 percent. Coupled with benefits for farmers, the economic internal rate of return for the\nProject is 19.6 percent and the economic net present value is NRs389 million ($5.6 million). A\nshadow wage rate of 0.80 for unskilled labor, which is used for such labor in the western region,\nwill further improve the Project's economic viability.\n16. Under the Project, all financial benefits will be distributed to farmers and agricultural\nlaborers although there will be a marginal portion of revenue recovered from the farmers' use of\nregional laboratory facilities. The Government will incur all financial costs of the Project. In\nNepal,  the  poverty  line  is  officially  defined  as  the  income  required  to  purchase  the  daily\nminimum requirement of 2,124 calories per capita, which is estimated at NRs4,404 in 1999. In\nthe Midwestern and Far Western development regions where the Project will be implemented,\nthe majority of farmers are either below or near the poverty line. Under the Project, at least 50\npercent of group members in each pocket area will be poor households. Based on this, the net\npresent value of total economic gains accruing to poor households under the Project will be\nNRs525  million  ($7.6  million)  or  NRs11,600  ($168)  per  household.  In  addition,  during  the\nselection of poor farmers for the inclusion in a farmer group, priority will be given to the\ndisadvantaged  members  of  the  local  community,  including  the  former  bonded  agricultural\nlaborers.\nF. Sensitivity Analysis\n17. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for (i) increased costs, (ii) reduced benefits, (iii) a\ncombination of the two, (iv) a one-year lag in benefits, and (v) reduced increase in cropping\nintensity. The analyses show the Project to be viable for these different scenarios (Table A11.5).", " 71\n   Appendix 11, page 5\nTable A11.1:  Project Area and Beneficiaries\n                  Lowland Region                          Hilly Region                          Project\nUnits Field Hortic.
