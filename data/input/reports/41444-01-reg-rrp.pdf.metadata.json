The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.  The \nproject was prepared through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional technical assistance \n(TA).1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe  poor  state  of  such  basic  infrastructure  as  roads  is  a  major  obstacle  to  building \n2. \nsubregional  economic  cooperation  among  the  six  countries  that  border  the  Mekong  River. \nUnder the GMS program, which it helped establish in 1992, ADB has supported the creation of \nstrategic  transport  and  economic  corridors  linking  Cambodia,  the  People's  Republic  of  China, \nthe Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. After a summit of GMS leaders in July 2005 \nhighlighted  the  key  role  of  comprehensive,  efficient  cross-border  transport  in  promoting  trade, \ninvestment,  resource  development  and  sharing,  and  the  free  movement  of  goods  and  people \nbetween  their  countries,  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  to  prepare  the  GMS  transport \nsector  strategy  study. 2  The  study  recommended  the  establishment  of  a  seamless,  well-built, \nmultimodal  subregional  transport  network  to  fully  connect  the  GMS. 3   The  sector  strategy\u2019s \nobjectives were to complete the transport corridors; coordinate GMS country efforts to develop \nthese  transport  routes  into  economic  corridors  of  agricultural  diversification,  industrialization, \nand employment creation; reduce nonphysical barriers to the movement of people, goods, and \nservices within the subregion; and accelerate the implementation of such arrangements as the \nGMS cross-border transport agreement.  \n \n3. \nThe  GMS  cross-border  transport  agreement  was  incorporated  in  the  GMS  program  in \n1999  to  support  trade  facilitation.  The  agreement  covers  various  aspects  of  cross-border \ntransport  facilitation  in  the  GMS.  All  the  GMS  countries  have  finalized  and  signed  all  annexes \nand  protocols  in  the  agreement,  and  most  countries  have  ratified  all  of  the  annexes  and \nprotocols. 4   The  agreement  is  already  under  initial  implementation  at  three  border  crossing \npoints  along  the  Lao  PDR\u2013Viet  Nam,  Thailand\u2013Lao  PDR,  and  PRC\u2013Viet  Nam  borders. \nAgreements  have  been  signed  on  additional  border  crossings  for  implementation  along  the \nPRC\u2013Lao PDR and Cambodia\u2013Viet Nam borders. \n \nThe  GMS  Northeastern  Corridor  (stretching  from  Thanh  Hoa  in  northern  Viet  Nam \n4. \nthrough northern Lao PDR to Bangkok) is one of the corridors identified in the transport sector \nstrategy study and links northeastern Lao PDR with northern Viet Nam and its seaports. Many \nof the corridor roads between Thanh Hoa and Bangkok are in good condition. Others are now \n\n                                                \n \n1   ADB.  2008.

Manila. \n\n4   Thailand and Myanmar have not yet ratified all of the annexes and protocols. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nbeing  improved,  including  a  367-kilometer  (km)  stretch  of  Route  4  in  the  Lao  PDR  from  the \nLouangphrabang  area  to  the  Lao  PDR\u2013Thailand  border  that  is  being  upgraded  under  ADB\u2019s \nNorthern GMS Transport Network Improvement Project, approved in 2007. 5 The section of the \ncorridor  between  the  coast  through  the  provinces  of  Thanh  Hoa  in  northern  Viet  Nam  and \nHouaphanh in northeastern Lao PDR, however, needs to be improved to a higher, all-weather, \ninternational standard if the Northeastern Corridor is to deliver its full potential increase in traffic, \ntrade, and economic development and give the northern region of the Lao PDR valuable year-\nround access to rapidly developing ports on the South China Sea. The proposed project will fill \nthis  key  gap.  It  was  accorded  priority  in  the  GMS  transport  sector  study  and  is  strongly \nsupported  by  the  governments  of  the  Lao  PDR  and  Viet  Nam,  which  believe  it  will  strengthen \nthe  economies  of  both  countries  and  help  reduce  current  high  poverty  rates  in  the  project \nprovinces on both sides of their border. The project is included in the GMS regional cooperation \nbusiness plan for 2010\u20132012.6   \n \nThe  midterm  review  of  the  GMS  strategic  framework  (2002\u20132012) 7 found  that \n5. \nimprovements in physical connectivity infrastructure in the subregion should be complemented \nby investments that enhance competitiveness. The Lao PDR and Viet Nam governments have \nbegun  addressing  this  need  on  the  Northeastern  Corridor  by  building  new  border  posts  at  Na \nMeo  and  Nam  Soi  where  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Highway  217  and  Route  6  in  the  Lao  PDR  join.  ADB\u2019s \nefforts  along  the  Northeastern  Corridor  include  its  socioeconomic  development  project  for \nThanh  Hoa  City,  approved  in  2009, 8   and  the  Small  Towns  Development  Sector  Project, 9  \ncompleted  in  2009,  which  financed  upgrading  of  urban  infrastructure  in  Xam\u2013Nua  in  the  Lao \nPDR. \n \nThe project will address a central need identified by a 2008 evaluation of transport and \n6. \ntrade  facilitation  in  the  GMS  by  providing  one  of  the  missing  infrastructure  links  that  have \nreduced the effectiveness of the GMS network\u2019s completed sections.10 ADB is also responding \nto the assessment of GMS road project evaluations that development of the transport corridors \ninto  economic  corridors  has  been  slow.  The  project  road\u2019s  border  crossing  is  not  part  of  the \ncross-border  transport  agreement  implementation  activities.  However,  the  need  to  boost  trade \nthrough the project road\u2019s border crossing will be addressed as part of a proposed ADB cluster \nregional  policy  and  advisory  TA  for  implementing  the  action  plan  for  transport  and  trade \nfacilitation in the GMS, which is to be considered for approval in the fourth quarter of 2010. The \noutputs of this TA are to include better coordinated border management, enhancements in the \nsanitary  and  phytosanitary  regime,  strengthening  of  national  and  subregional  institutions  for \ntrade facilitation, and the development of a regional trade logistics strategy. The TA includes the \nNa Meo\u2013Nam Soi border crossing as one of its pilot sites for implementing the action plan.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3\n\nThe project will also benefit from new activities that ADB has instituted to strengthen the \n7. \ndevelopment of economic corridors. The Economic Corridors\u2019 Forum is tasked with raising the \nprofile of economic corridor development in the GMS as well as enhancing collaboration among \nGMS  fora  and  working  groups  along  the  GMS  economic  corridors.  As  part  of  the  Economic \nCorridors\u2019 Forum, the Governors\u2019 Forum is providing the framework and mechanism for stronger \ncooperation among provincial and local officials as well as the closer engagement of the private \nsector in addressing economic corridor development issues. \n \nAn evaluation of the Lao PDR transport sector noted the need to assess the local impact \n8. \nof regional road projects.11 The local impact of the project will be assessed through the project \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  system  will  develop  and  monitor  a  set  of \nindicators reflecting transport costs, tariffs, and mobility that will be used to assess the effects of \nimproved  transport  access,  as  well  as  improvements  in  agricultural  productivity,  economic \nactivity, and the health and education sectors, on communities in the project area. \n \n9. \nRoad maintenance and vehicle overloading are key issues affecting the sustainability of \nroad  projects  in  Viet  Nam  and  the  Lao  PDR.  Both  governments  have  agreed  to  maintain  the \nproject  roads  to  the  national  standard.  In  Lao  PDR,  this  will  be  done  through  the  use  of \nperformance-based  maintenance  contracts.  In  Viet  Nam,  performance-based  maintenance \ncontracts  will  also  be  used  for  the  project  road,  subject  to  the  successful  outcome  of  ongoing \npilot  tests  of  these  contracts.  MOT  will  develop  a  program  to  control  vehicle  overloading  of \nvehicles on the project road in Viet Nam. To address vehicle overloading in the Lao PDR, scales \nfor  weighing  vehicles  will  be  procured  under  the  project,  and  checkpoints  to  control  the \noverloading of vehicles will be established along the project roads. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  international  trade  on  the  GMS \nNortheastern Corridor. The expected outcome is more efficient transport across the Lao PDR\u2013\nViet Nam border and on the project sections of the GMS Northeastern Corridor. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11. \nThe expected outputs of the project are the improvement of the Viet Nam and the Lao \nPDR  project  components  of  the  GMS  Northeastern  Corridor  and  of  road  safety  on  these \nstretches. The improved sections will comprise 196 km of Highway 217 in Viet Nam and 143 km \nof routes 6, 6A, and 6B in the Lao PDR, as well as selected sections of routes 6 and 1C where \nroad safety and alignment will be improved. The project also includes clearance of unexploded \nordnance along the project alignment in Viet Nam and the Lao PDR and procurement of scales \nfor weighing vehicles on the project roads in the Lao PDR to control vehicle overloading. \n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $139.7  million,  including  contingencies,  taxes,  and \ninterest  during  construction  (Table  1).  The  costs  are  expected  to  be  $97.4  million  for  the \nVietnamese component and $42.3 million for the Lao PDR component. Taxes and duties will be \nfinanced by the governments. \n \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB.  2010.

ADB will provide a grant \nof  $20  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  for  the  Lao  PDR  component  and  the \ngovernment will provide $10.3 million. Delays in the government providing counterpart financing \nhave caused implementation difficulties on previous road projects in the Lao PDR. However, no \ndelays  are  expected  for  the  government  contribution  for  the  project.  About  29%  of  the \ngovernment  share  is  for  taxes  and  duties  generated  by  the  project,  and  about  17%  is  for \ncontingences,  which  may  not  be  necessary.  Furthermore,  no  substantial  government \nexpenditures  are  expected  until  2013,  when  ADB  expects  government  revenues  to  be  about \n35% higher than in 2010. The Government of Lao PDR is also seeking a loan from OFID in the \namount of $12.0 million equivalent. Cofinancing in this amount is included in OFID\u2019s program, \nand formal approval is expected in March 2011. ADB typically seeks approval from its Board of \nDirectors  for  the  administration  of  grant  and/or  loan  funds  from  cofinanciers  only  when \ncofinancing  commitments  are  in  place.  To  facilitate  project  implementation,  the  Board  is \nrequested to approve the administration of the proposed loan in an amount not exceeding the \nequivalent of $12 million from OFID, which is expected to be confirmed subsequent to the date \nof  Board  approval.  Approval  from  OFID  will  be  reported  to  the  Board  in  accordance  with  the \nstandard reporting procedures. The OFID financing will be provided as joint cofinancing and will \nbe administered by ADB. The Government of the Lao PDR has agreed that if the loan does not \nmaterialize  it  will  secure  an  equivalent  amount  of  financing  from  other  sources  or  agree  to \nreduce the scope of the project accordingly.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOFID \nGovernmenta \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n68.00 \n8.60 \n23.40 \n100.00 \nLAO = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, OFID = OPEC Fund for International Development, VIE = Viet \nNam. \na  Taxes and duties to be financed from government resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n95.00 \n12.00 \n32.70 \n139.70 \n\nLAO \n20.00 \n12.00 \n10.30 \n42.30 \n\nVIE \n75.00 \n0.00 \n22.40 \n97.40 \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  executing  agency  for  the  Vietnamese  component  will  be  the  MOT.

The  forecasts  are  based  on  expected  growth  in  gross  domestic  product,  income \nelasticities of demand, and analysis of regional patterns. The economic analysis was carried out \nfor  the  project  by  comparing  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  In  the  without-\nproject  scenario,  the  road  is  assumed  to  remain  in  its  present  condition.  The  with-project \nscenario  includes  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  of  the  post-project  road,  according  to \ninternational standards. Project economic costs include the resource costs of road improvement \nand  maintenance.  The  primary  economic  benefits  of  the  project  are  vehicle  operating  cost \n(VOC)  savings,  generated  traffic,  and  time  savings.  Economic  benefits  were  calculated  using \nthe  methodology  used  for  costs.  VOC  savings  will  accrue  primarily  from  improvements  in  the \nroad\u2019s  surface  and  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment  and  from  increased  average  speed. \nGenerated traffic is defined as new traffic induced by lower transport costs due to the project. \nBenefits for generated traffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal traffic. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  project  is  14%,  using  a  12%  discount  rate. \nSensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in the key parameters \nthat determine the benefits and costs of the project. The economic internal rates of return for the \nalternatives tested under the sensitivity analysis are more than 12%. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n17. \nA  governance  assessment  was  carried  out  for  both  the  Lao  PDR  and  the  Viet  Nam \nproject components as part of the due diligence. The assessment covered the capacities of the \nMPWT  and  the  DOR  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  the  MOT  and  the  PMU1  in  Viet  Nam,  focusing  on \nfinancial management, institutional issues, policies and procedures, and risks. While significant \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 7\n\ngovernance  issues  exist  in  both  countries  and  both  executing  agencies,  substantial  progress \nhas been made over the last several years. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  governments  and  the  executing  agencies.  In \naddition, the governments have agreed to implement other measures to strengthen governance. \nThese  include  establishment  of  a  grievance-redress  mechanism  for  project-related  issues, \nincluding  corruption,  and  creation  of  project  websites  to  disclose  information  on  procurement \nand  other  project-related  matters  to  the  public.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2).  \n\nC. \n\n Poverty and Social \n\nThe  project  area  encompasses  poor  areas  in  both  Viet  Nam  and  the  Lao  PDR.  An \n18. \nestimated  37%  of  the  households  in  Thanh  Hoa,  the  northernmost  province  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s \ncentral  coastal  region,  have  incomes  under  the  national  poverty  line  and  three  of  the  five \ndistricts  that  the  project  road  passes  through  in  the  province  are  designated  as  poor,  with \npoverty rates ranging from 24% to 59%. The project road crosses Houaphanh on the Lao PDR \nside  of  the  border,  which  is  the  country\u2019s  fifth  poorest  province  and  where  758  villages, \nsubsiding  mostly  on  upland  agriculture,  are  classified  as  poor.  Five  of  its  eight  districts  are \namong the country\u2019s 47 poorest.  \n \n19. \nIn  addition  to  increasing  international  trade  on  the  GMS  Northeastern  Corridor,  the \nproject  will  reduce  poverty  in  the  project  area  by  providing  economic  opportunities.  The  road \nimprovements  will  give  the  poor  better  access  to  health,  education,  and  other  social  services. \nTravel times and transportation costs will decrease while household incomes rise due to easier \ntransport of goods and local produce. Some negative social effects are also possible, however. \nTo  address  the  risk  of  higher  rates  of  HIV  transmission  and  human  trafficking  of  women  and \nchildren  that  will  result  from  an  influx  of  construction  workers,  the  project  will  include  an \nHIV/AIDS  awareness  and  human  trafficking  prevention  program.  Program  activities  during  the \npreconstruction  and  initial  operations  period  will  be  implemented  as  part  of  ADB\u2019s  TA  on  HIV \nprevention  and  infrastructure  in  the  GMS.12  The  project  will  finance  these  activities  during  the \nrest  of  the  implementation  period.  The  project\u2019s  supervision  consultants  will  also  address  the \nneed to mitigate the road safety risks that factors such as higher traffic levels and faster speeds \non the project road will raise.  \n \n20. \nis  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming.  The  project  gender  action  plan  ensures  that  (i)  civil  works  will  employ  labor-\nbased technology as much as possible and that all construction and road maintenance activities \nwill  set  employment  targets  for  women,  (ii)  women  will  have  basic  amenities  at  construction \nsites and be paid fair wages commensurate with those of men, and (iii) road shoulders will have \nsealed  surfaces  for  women\u2019s  safety  and  to  reduce  their  burdens  as  they  carry  goods.  The \nproject\u2019s  road  safety  interventions,  which  will  include  road  safety  signs  and  speed  bumps  or \nother  safety  measures  to  slow  traffic  in  villages,  will  use  community  women  as  facilitators  in \ncommunity-based  information  activities.  The  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  anti-trafficking  activities \nwill be based on consultation with women and men, will stress gender-sensitive awareness and \ninformation  materials,  and  will  include  targets  for  the  participation  of  women  as  community \nfacilitators and beneficiaries. The project will train executing and implementing agency staff on \ngender issues and include gender indicators in project processes and outputs. \n\nGender  and  development.  The  project \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB.  2008.

Manila (TA 6467-REG). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  project\u2019s  environmental  impact  has  been  classified  as  category  B  under  ADB\u2019s \n21. \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Based  on  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE) \nreports prepared for the Lao PDR and Viet Nam components the project is not expected to have \nsignificant  environmental  impacts.  None  of  the  project  roads  traverses  buffer  or  core  zones  of \necologically  or  culturally  protected  areas.  Two  proposed  bypasses  in  Viet  Nam  are  relatively \nshort, ranging from 2 km to 3 km. The adverse environmental impacts will come largely during \nconstruction from dust and noise, surface run-off, erosion, traffic and utility disruptions, potential \noccupational  and  community  health  and  safety  risks,  and  disposal  of  excavated  materials.  Of \napproximately  4  million  cubic  meters  of  soil  and  rock-based  material  that  will  come  from  the \ncutting necessary for road widening in hilly areas in the Lao PDR and about the same volume in \nViet Nam, only about 10%\u201315% can be used for fill on the project. Environmental management \nplans  (EMPs)  detailing  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  have  been  prepared  as \npart  of  the  IEEs  to  avoid  or  reduce  anticipated  negative  project  impacts.  These  plans  also \nrequire  the  design  and  supervision  consultant  (DSC)  to  draft  site-specific  EMPs  (SEMP)  or \nmethod statements during the detailed design phase. The SEMP will include the following sub-\nplans:  (i)  waste  management  and  spoil  disposal  plan,  (ii)  materials  management  plan,  (iii) \ndrainage management plan, (iv) erosion control plan, (v) temporary transport management plan, \n(vi) utilities and irrigation reprovisioning plan, (vii) noise and dust control plan, and (viii) workers \nand public safety plan. The contractor will be required to update these EMPs before work begins \nat the sites.  \n \nIn  compliance  with  ADB  requirements,  public  consultations  were  conducted  during  IEE \n22. \npreparation  with  stakeholders  such  as  local  residents,  road  users,  roadside  business  owners, \nlocally  elected  representatives,  and  local  government  officials.    The  IEEs  have  addressed  the \nissues and concerns these stakeholders raised. To ensure that the project execution complies \nwith the EMPs, the two executing agencies\u2014the MOT in Viet Nam and the MPWT  in the Lao \nPDR\u2014will include the EMPs in the tender documents and civil works contracts. The executing \nagencies and PMUs will be assisted by the DSC in monitoring the environmental performance \nof  contractors  and  will  submit  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  ADB.  The  DSC \nwill also conduct capacity-building activities with the PMUs on environmental management and \nmonitoring. Such activities will include training workshops, orientations, and on-the-job training. \nEnvironmental assessment and review frameworks have been developed for the Lao PDR and \nViet Nam components to make certain that, if rural roads are added to the scope of the project \nafter  approval,  implementation  will  comply  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  frameworks  and  IEEs  have  been \nendorsed by the governments. \n \nThe project\u2019s resettlement impacts has been classified as category B for Viet Nam and \n23. \nLao PDR under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. There are about 8,913 households (35,652 \npeople) in Viet Nam and about 147 households in the Lao PDR which will lose a small portion of \nland.  Only  6  households  will  require  relocation  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  no  relocation  will  be \nnecessary in Viet Nam. The Resettlement Plans have been endorsed and disclosed by MOT in \nViet Nam and MPWT in the Lao PDR. \n \n24. \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  has  been  classified  as  category  B  under \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  The  ethnic  minority  populations  of  the  districts  closest  to \nThanh  Hoa  City  are  very  small,  but  ethnic  minorities  comprise  almost  the  entire  population  of \nthe two project area districts In Viet Nam closest to the Lao PDR border. The same is true of the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 9\n\ntwo project area districts on the Lao PDR side of the border. The ethnic communities in the Lao \nPDR have been living along the project road since the 1970s. The project will not (i) affect any \ncustomary  rights  to  resources  or  land;  (ii)  negatively  affect  the  socioeconomic  status  of  the \nethnic  groups;  (iii)  reduce  their  cultural  and  community  integrity;  (iv)  affect  their  health, \neducation,  livelihood,  and/or  social security  status;  or  (v)  alter  or  undermine  the  recognition  of \nindigenous knowledge. Impacts on ethnic minorities will be addressed through the Resettlement \nPlans.  The  Resettlement  and  Ethnic  Minorities  Framework  and  Resettlement  and  Ethnic \nCommunities Framework have been endorsed by the MOT in Viet Nam and the MPWT in the \nLao PDR, respectively. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n\n25.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan,  which  is  accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments  in  Appendix  2.  Key  project  risks  include  inadequate  maintenance  of  the  project \nroads,  damage  to  the  project  roads  from  overloaded  vehicles,  ineffective  implementation  of \nsafeguards  policies,  and  corruption.  The  governments  have  agreed  to  implement  mitigating \nmeasures to address these risks, including assurances that the project roads will be maintained \nto  the  national  standard  through  the  use  of  performance-based  maintenance  contracts, \nestablishment  of  checkpoints  to  control  the  overloading  of  vehicles,  establishment  of  a \ngrievance-redress  mechanism  for  several  issues  that  include  safeguards  and  corruption,  and \ncreation of project websites to disclose project-related information to the public. \n\n \n\nRisks \nThe project roads are not \nmaintained adequately. \n\nOverloaded vehicles \ndamage project roads. \n\nSafeguards  policies  are  not \nimplemented effectively. \n\nCorruption \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe loan and grant agreements include an assurance that the project roads will \nbe maintained to the national standard and will be maintained through the use of \nperformance-based maintenance contracts. \nViet Nam will develop a program to control the overloading of vehicles along the \nproject  road,  and  Lao  PDR  will  set  up  checkpoints  along  the  project  roads  to \ncontrol the overloading of vehicles. \nThe executing agencies will establish a grievance-redress mechanism to receive \nand resolve complaints on environment, resettlement, and other project issues.  \nAn  independent  monitor  will  be  engaged  to  monitor  resettlement  activities  and \nland acquisition. \nThe executing agencies will (i) create project websites to disclose information on \nprocurement  and  other  project  matters,  and  (ii)  establish  a  grievance-redress \nmechanism on procurement and other project matters. \n\nIV. \n\n ASSURANCES \n\nThe governments and the executing agencies have assured ADB that implementation of \n26. \nthe project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM, and loan and grant documents. \n \n27. \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and grant agreement. \n \n\nThe  governments  and  the  executing  agencies  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n28. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR47,450,000  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Second  Northern  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \nTransport  Network  Improvement  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources \nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter;
