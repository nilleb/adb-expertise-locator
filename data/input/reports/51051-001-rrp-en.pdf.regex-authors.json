THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $228,000,000 to Gulf SRC Company Limited (Gulf SRC) for the Chonburi Natural Gas \nPower Project in Thailand. \n \n2.  The project entails the construction and operation of a 2,500-megawatt (MW) combined-\ncycle power plant in the WHA Eastern Seaboard Industrial Estate 1 (WHA Industrial Estate)1 of \nChonburi  Province.  The  project  will  provide  significant  generating  capacity  that  is  reliable, \nefficient, and cost-effective. The project will be one of the largest power plants in Thailand and \nwill  help  meet  the  projected  growth  and  industrial  transformation  plans  under  the  Eastern \nEconomic Corridor (EEC) program. The project will utilize natural gas and will be the first to \nemploy a new high-efficiency technology that reduces pollutants and emissions, providing cleaner \nair quality and lower carbon footprint.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. With the intention of reaching high-income country status by 2032, \nThailand launched \u201cThailand 4.0\u201d, a development model that aims to pull the country out of the \nmiddle-income trap by creating a value-based economy driven by innovation. To put Thailand 4.0 \ninto action, the Government of Thailand adopted the EEC program, which will be the prime \neconomic growth driver for the country over the next 10 years, from 2018 to 2028.2 The EEC \ninitiative builds on the successful Eastern Seaboard Development Program (ESDP), which was \nlaunched in 1982 and is credited with the country\u2019s rapid industrial transformation. The ESDP \nestablished  major  industries  along  Thailand\u2019s  eastern  seaboard  (e.g.,  petrochemicals, \nelectronics, automotive, and parts) and also facilitated major investments in infrastructure such \nas ports, highways, power plants, water supply, and industrial estates. The region has since \nbecome a strong commercial and tourism destination, as well as a strategic hub, gateway, and \neconomic corridor connecting markets in the Greater Mekong Subregion.3 \n \n4.  During the first 20 years, the ESDP contributed remarkable annual growth rates in export \nvalues (12%), industrial sector expansion (12%), and gross domestic product (7%). The national \npoverty  level  declined  substantially  from  67%  in  1986  to  under  9%  by  2016.  After  this \nunprecedented development, Thailand\u2019s economy began to stagnate at middle-income levels, \nfailing to graduate to the ranks of high-income countries. Building on the success of the ESDP, \nthe government aims to promote the next generation of industries and infrastructure through its \nflagship EEC program. This includes mega public\u2013private partnership projects centered on \ntransport and logistics, e.g., international airport expansion (U-Tapao), deep sea port expansion \n(Map Ta Phut and Laem Chabang), the country\u2019s first high-speed train, and other investments in \nindustry, tourism, hospitals, and smart cities.4 In the first 5 years, combined public and private \n                                                \n1  Formerly known as the Hemaraj Eastern Seaboard Estate. \n2  The EEC program will be implemented across an area of more than 13,000 square kilometers in the three eastern \nprovinces of Chachoengsao, Chonburi, and Rayong. \n3  The eastern seaboard is part of the Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Economic Corridor that connects Bangkok, \nPhnom Penh, and Ho Chi Minh. \n4  The EEC program aims to promote 10 industry clusters: (i) next-generation automotive, (ii) intelligent electronics, (iii) \nadvanced agriculture and biotechnology, (iv) food processing, (v) tourism, (vi) advanced robotics, (vii) integrated \naviation, (viii) medical hub and comprehensive health care services, (ix) biofuels and biochemical, and (x) digital \ntechnology. \n ", "2 \ninvestment is estimated to total B1.5 trillion ($43 billion) and the EEC initiative is expected to \nachieve economic growth of 5.0%, create more than 100,000 jobs, and attract 10 million more \ntourists on an annual basis. \n \n5.  To support the EEC program, sustain economic growth, and improve the standard of \nliving, substantial investment is needed in social and utility services such as schools, hospitals, \nwater, and electricity. Accordingly, Thailand\u2019s 12th National Economic and Social Development \nPlan 2017\u20132021 calls for upgrading the economic, social, and environmental infrastructure and \nexpanding public utility services on the eastern seaboard. Demand for electricity is expected to \nincrease in parallel with growth in tourism, commercial, and industrial activity, and from the influx \nof residents in search of new employment and better quality of life. \n \n6.  The Chonburi Natural Gas Power Project will be centrally located in the EEC and will be \nthe fourth-largest power plant and the largest combined-cycle power plant in the country. The \nproject will become fully operational by 2022 as the government\u2019s mega infrastructure projects \nunder the EEC program come to fruition between 2021 and 2025. The timing also coincides with \nthe largest decommissioning of aging power plants in Thailand, with more than 8,500 MW retiring \nbetween 2020 and 2025 (equivalent to 20% of the current national capacity). \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n7.  After the discovery of large reserves in the late 1970s, natural gas from the Gulf of \nThailand provided the eastern seaboard with an abundant, low-cost, and secure source of energy \nand was an integral factor in fueling Thailand\u2019s successful industrial transformation into a major \nexport-orientated  economy.  The  eastern  seaboard  will  continue  to  use  natural  gas  as  the \npreferred choice of fuel because it emits substantially less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \ndust, and ash than coal-fired power plants, the main alternative fuel choice for industrial parks on \nthe eastern seaboard. But as reserves from the Gulf of Thailand are dwindling, the country has \nbegun to rely more on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports to meet its demand for natural gas. \nLNG demand is forecast to increase to 35 million tons per annum (MTPA) by 2036. PTT has \nalready completed two terminals on the eastern seaboard with 10 MTPA of capacity, and a 1.5 \nMPTA expansion is under construction. A third LNG terminal with 7.5 MTPA was approved and \nis due for completion in 2022. Greater reliance on LNG will make it necessary to procure the most \nefficient gas turbine technology to help contain the costs to end users. \n \n8.  The project is being developed under Thailand\u2019s IPP program, which allows the private \nsector to build, own, and operate power projects with generating capacity of more than 90 MW. \nThe IPP program was established in 1994 to promote efficient procurement and foster competition \nwith an aim to minimize the government\u2019s capital burden and lower the cost of electricity to end \nconsumers. IPP contracts are awarded through a competitive bidding process based on the \nlowest levelized electricity price. Since its inception, the program has successfully tendered three \nIPP bidding rounds and awarded 13 contracts totaling more than 16,000 MW. The Chonburi \nNatural Gas Power Project was competitively awarded in the latest IPP bidding round, which was \nconcluded in 2013. \n  \n9.  Project design. The project entails the construction and operation of a 2,500 MW CCGT \npower plant in the WHA Industrial Estate of Chonburi Province, about 140 kilometers (km) east \nof Bangkok. The project is being developed under Thailand\u2019s independent power producer (IPP) \nprogram and will be implemented under a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the \nElectricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and a 25-year gas sales agreement (GSA) \nwith PTT Public Company Limited (PTT). \n ", "3 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n10.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n20.  ADB will provide a proposed limited-recourse project-finance loan of up to $228 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. ADB\u2019s loan will have a tenor of 23 years and includes a 4-\nyear grace period during construction and commissioning. A consortium of financial institutions\u2014\nincluding the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, the Export-Import Bank of Thailand, and \nnine commercial banks\u2014will participate in parallel to ADB with the same loan tenor. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n21.  The financing needs of the project are substantial, requiring about $1.15 billion of long-\nterm, limited-recourse debt. ADB\u2019s assistance is catalyzing $923 million or about $4 of cofinancing \n ", "6 \nfor  every  $1  of  ADB  assistance.  ADB  has  been  engaged  in  the  financial  structuring  and \nsafeguards review from early stage and its role as an anchor lender provides credibility to the \nproject and its developers to help attract other financial institutions to participate. ADB\u2019s proactive \nrole early on in the process was critical for garnering interest from local and international financial \ninstitutions during the bank solicitation process and helps enable the successful financial closing. \nADB also endorses the project\u2019s use of the most advanced technology in terms of high-efficiency \nand low-carbon, which has a maximum rated efficiency greater than 63%. The project will be the \nfirst  commercial  deployment  of  MHPS\u2019s  most  advanced  and  efficient  turbine,  and  such \nendorsement from ADB and subsequent demonstration effect will lead to faster adoption from \nother developers and reduce the perceived risk by other financial institutions. \n \n22.  ADB also plays a lead role in the due diligence process, especially with respect to \nenvironmental,  social,  gender,  and  integrity  standards,  as  well  as  in  the  negotiations  and \nstructuring  of  the  transaction.  With  ADB\u2019s  guidance,  the  project  will  adopt  more  stringent \nsafeguard measures than what is required under national standards and incorporate certain \ngender-inducive elements in the project design, such as employment targets for women and \ncommunity outreach campaigns.  \n \nC.  Risks \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n23.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category A), involuntary resettlement (category B), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).14 A draft environmental and social impact assessment \n(ESIA) and management plans were prepared by Gulf SRC and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.15 \nThe ESIA recorded no presence of distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples or ethnic minority \ngroups in the project\u2019s area of influence. \n \n24.  ADB undertook due diligence and reviewed the project\u2019s potential environmental and \nsocial impacts and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The ESIA was updated to meet ADB\u2019s requirements, \nand ADB is working with the sponsors to ensure compliance with its Safeguard Policy Statement, \nand applicable policies and guidelines, and finalize the ESIA prior to the ADB Board of Directors \napproval. 16  The  environmental  and  social  measures  and  the  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment of Gulf SRC to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed \nadequate. \n \n25.  Environment (category A). Key construction phase impacts will include temporary noise, \ndust, traffic, solid and liquid waste generation, hazardous substances, and occupational and \npublic health and safety issues. During operation, key potential impacts include air and noise \n                                                \n14 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n15 https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/tha-51051-001-esia. \n16 The ESIA also includes an approach to manage impacts and risks of project-associated facilities, and measures. \nAssociated facilities include an 8.5 km transmission line to be built by EGAT and a raw water supply pipeline to be \nconstructed by the WHA Industrial Estate.  \n \n ", "7 \nemissions, and effluent discharges. The ESIA management plans will avoid, minimize, and \nmitigate expected impacts and risks.17 The updated draft ESIA confirmed that a stack height of \n60 meters will result in better ground-level concentration values than a stack height of 65.68 \nmeters. Stack emissions will comply with applicable guidelines and national standards.  Air \ndispersion modeling confirmed that national ambient air quality standards will be met,18 and the \nproject will not contribute more than 25% of the national air quality standard at sensitive receptor \nlocations. 19 GHG emissions are estimated to be 8.59 million tons of carbon dioxide per year when \nusing natural gas, 20 and GHG monitoring will be undertaken. The noise calculation results for \nconstruction and operation indicated that noise levels will be elevated by less than 3 A-weighted \ndecibels at nearest sensitive receptors if the proposed temporary and permanent noise barriers \nare installed. The updated ESIA confirmed that effluent discharges will not have significant \nimpacts on the receiving waters. \n \n26.  Rounds of public consultation were undertaken in Chonburi and Rayong provinces in July\u2013\nAugust 2014, May 2015, and April 2018. Public concerns and feedback from sponsors from the \nfirst and second rounds of consultations are discussed in the disclosed draft ESIA, and the \nupdated ESIA incorporates the results of the 2018 consultations. \n \n27.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The ESIA and ADB due diligence found no \nlegacy issues regarding historical transfer of project land to the WHA Industrial Estate and then \non to the project. Acquisition of predominantly agricultural land for construction of the associated \ntransmission line will be undertaken by EGAT following national law, and according to the project \nESIA is expected to cause non-major involuntary economic displacement impacts. Gulf SRC will \nmonitor EGAT\u2019s land acquisition process and prepare, as part of the ESMP package, a land \nacquisition and compensation plan to ensure that the livelihoods of affected people are restored \nto  pre-project  levels  or  better.  ADB  will  disclose  the  plan  once  prepared  and  monitor  its \nimplementation. \n \n28.  Gender and other social aspects. The project has included some gender elements to \nenhance benefits to women beyond gender equality measures stipulated under national law and \nADB safeguard requirements\u2014e.g., equal opportunity in employment, nondiscrimination in the \nworkplace, and prevention of sexual violence, harassment of local communities, and disease \ntransmission. It committed to giving women 15% of the additional jobs required for plant operation. \nSuch a commitment is untypical for power plants, where the physical nature of the work usually \nlimits women\u2019s share of jobs to 5%\u201310%. Gulf SRC will also undertake community outreach \nactivities for girls on health as well as technical skills training.21 \n \n29.  Gulf SRC will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.22 The client will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with \n                                                \n17 Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 When running 100% on natural gas and contingency diesel oil. The diesel oil will have a sulfur content of less than \n0.005%. \n19 The 25% threshold value will not be met for nitrogen dioxide (1-hour average) at Khang Phu Mountain (about 8 km \nnorthwest from the project site) when the plant is running 100% and 60% on natural gas, and at Chomphu Mountain \nwhen the plant is running 100% on diesel, but impacts are not considered to be significant. This has been justified in \nthe updated ESIA. \n20 Under normal conditions using natural gas. This is about 2.8% of the total GHG emissions of Thailand in 2011 (305.52 \nmillion tons of carbon dioxide per year). \n21 ADB. 2012. Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.

Gulf SRC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
