THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $32,000,000 to Spayka Limited Liability Company for the High-Efficiency Horticulture and \nIntegrated Supply Chain Project in Armenia. \n \n2.  The  project  will  support  the  development  of  30  hectares  (ha)  of  climate-controlled \ngreenhouses1 equipped with drip irrigation systems2 to produce tomatoes and bell peppers. The \nproducts will be exported to the Russian Federation and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), \nleveraging Spayka\u2019s existing supply chain and client network. The project is fully aligned with the \nGovernment of Armenia\u2019s goals to boost agricultural productivity, exports, and employment. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  Importance of agriculture in Armenia. Agriculture has been deeply embedded in the \nsocioeconomic development of Armenia since the country\u2019s economic transition in 1991, when it \nbecame independent from the former Soviet Union. Armenian agriculture sector represented \n15.9% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product3 and 23.5% of its total merchandise export value4 \nin 2016. Armenia\u2019s farmers (of whom more than half are women) represent one-third of the \ncountry\u2019s work force.5 \n \n4.  Low  agricultural  productivity.  The  Armenian  agriculture  sector  suffers  from  low \nproductivity due to multiple factors, including limited irrigated land, inadequate infrastructure, \nlimited access to finance, a lack of efficient technology, vulnerability to natural hazards, and \nunderdeveloped market mechanisms. Further, a water shortage in some parts of Armenia\u2014made \nworse by climate change\u2014threatens the country\u2019s irrigation system. In November 2017, the \ngovernment set a goal to increase agricultural productivity by introducing modern technologies, \npromoting high value-added agriculture, expanding export volumes, and providing favorable \nconditions to farmers.6 \n \n5.  Horticulture development. Armenia has a natural competitive advantage in horticulture \ndue to a large number of sunny days. High-efficiency horticulture (based on climate-controlled \ngreenhouses,  drip  irrigation,  and  other  advanced  technologies)  is  identified  as  a  priority \ninvestment area to increase agricultural productivity, cope with the risks of climate change, and \nfully  leverage  Armenia\u2019s  competitive  advantage  in  both  domestic  and export markets. The \n                                                \n1  Climate-controlled greenhouses ensure stable and optimal growing conditions for fruits and vegetables. In an \nenclosed environment, temperature can be controlled by shading, ventilation, and heating (in the winter). Humidity \nis also controlled through ventilation and dehumidifiers. \n2  Drip irrigation systems can provide exact amounts of water and fertilizer for each plant at the different growth stages \nto optimize the plants\u2019 growth by strictly controlling the nutrient supply. \n3  National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia\u2019s ARMSTAT Database. \n4  World Trade Organization.

Armenpress. 8 \nNovember. https://armenpress.am/eng/news/911712/we-have-set-a-goal-to-increase-farming-productivity-in-\narmenia%C2%A0%E2%80%93-premier-karapetyan.html. \n ", "2   \ncountry\u2019s total greenhouse area increased nearly 2.5 times in 5 years, from 510 ha in 2011 to \n1,220 ha in 2016.7 Vegetables account for nearly two-thirds of greenhouse production (the rest \nincludes fruits and flowers). However, modern greenhouses still represent less than 10% of the \ntotal greenhouse area. Around 75% of modern greenhouses use climate-controlled technologies, \nwhereas most smallholder farmers still rely on traditional greenhouse technologies with less \nadvanced operational and disease control systems.8 \n \n6.  The Government of Armenia\u2019s strong support for greenhouse development. The \ngovernment  has  prioritized  the  development  of  greenhouses,  especially  climate-controlled \ngreenhouses, as a key area of agricultural development, and is extending support to companies \nand smallholder farmers to improve land access to build greenhouses. To promote investments, \nthe government has, since 2015, exempted from value-added tax the imports of greenhouse \nequipment and of several resources used in greenhouse crop production, such as seeds and \nplanting materials. In 2016, the government decided to lower the tariff of natural gas consumption \nfor  the  agriculture  sector,  including  greenhouses.  Driven  by  government  support,  the  total \ngreenhouse area and the share of climate-controlled greenhouses within the total area are both \nlikely to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. \n \n7.  High potential for greenhouse vegetable export. In 2011\u20132016, Armenia\u2019s exports \nincreased at an annualized rate of 21.2%, from $1.34 billion in 2011 to $1.79 billion in 2016.9 \nVegetables were the fastest-growing commodity among Armenia\u2019s top 10 export categories, up \nby 5,589% from 2009 to2016 (mainly driven by tomato exports). The Russian Federation is the \nlargest consumer of Armenia\u2019s fruits and vegetables. In 2016, 91.4% of Armenia\u2019s fruit and \nvegetable export was shipped to the Russian market.10 In addition to favorable weather conditions \nand a geographic proximity to the Russian Federation, Armenia benefits from being of a member \nof the Eurasian Economic Union since January 2015, meaning that Armenian exports to the \nRussian Federation are exempted from any custom duties.  \n \n8.  Project selection. Spayka is the leading food producer, processer, exporter, and logistics \ncompany in Armenia. The project team identified Spayka as a suitable candidate for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support because of (i) Spayka\u2019s leading position in Armenia\u2019s \nagricultural export market and satisfactory financial performance; (ii) Spayka\u2019s extensive logistics \nand transportation business as well as strong sales network with top Russian supermarkets since \n2011; (iii) Spayka\u2019s diversified product mix, encompassing greenhouse vegetable production, fruit \nand vegetable sourcing from contract farms, canned food, and packaging products; and (iv) a \ncommitted management with a solid track record in agricultural export and logistics, and market \nknowledge in the destination markets. \n \n2.  Project Design \n9.  The project supports the expansion of Spayka\u2019s greenhouse production and export of \nfresh vegetables. As part of a vertical integration strategy, Spayka plans to expand its high-\nefficiency greenhouses and construct an additional 30 ha of climate-controlled \u201csemi-closed\u201d \ngreenhouses11 in Yerevan to produce tomatoes and bell peppers. These vegetables will be \n                                                \n7  World Bank Group. 2016. Export Supply Chain of Greenhouse Crops: Armenia.

The \n ", "    3 \nexported to the Russian Federation and the UAE by taking advantage of Spayka\u2019s existing \ntransportation and logistics business and established client network in these countries. \n \n10.  Spayka  started  greenhouse  operations  in  2014  to  secure  its  supply  of  fruits  and \nvegetables and achieve its value chain integration strategy by connecting greenhouse production \nto its food production, processing, packaging, transportation, and logistics businesses. Besides \nthe 30 ha of semi-closed greenhouses to be funded by ADB, Spayka is currently operating 35 ha \nof closed greenhouses,12 constructing 20 ha of closed greenhouses, and plans to construct \nanother 20 ha of semi-closed greenhouses. By the end of 2018, Spayka will own and operate a \ntotal of 105 ha of greenhouses. \n \n11.  Spayka has extensive experience in greenhouse development and management. It has \ndeveloped  and  customized  its  greenhouses to  take full  advantage  of  location  and  climate \nconditions. The project\u2019s projected yield is around 45 kilograms (kg) per square meter (m2) for \ntomatoes and 22 kg per m2 for bell peppers annually. Tomatoes and bell peppers were selected \nbecause of the high demand for these products in export markets and their long shelf-life. Demand \nremains constant throughout the year although vegetable supply from open-field horticulture is \nseasonal and dependent on weather conditions. Therefore, expanding greenhouse will reduce \nthe seasonality of production and secure stable production and exports throughout the year. \n \n12.  Following a vertically integrated value chain approach, sales of greenhouse vegetables \nwill be through Spayka\u2019s existing logistics and transportation chain, including Spayka\u2019s fleet of \n215 trucks and 250 contracted trucks, three warehouses in Yerevan, and advanced refrigerated \ncold  storage  facility  at  the  Armenia\u2013Georgia  border.  Products  will  be  sold  in  high-quality \npackaging produced by Spayka Plastics. Spayka transports agricultural products from Armenia \nvia Georgia to the Russian Federation. Spayka has established strong sales channels with large \nsupermarket chains in the Russian Federation since 2011.  \n \n13.  The semi-closed greenhouse technology was invented in the United States in 2005 and \nhas been widely used in Europe and North America, especially for growing tomatoes. The semi-\nclosed technology creates the optimal microclimate environment inside the greenhouse due to its \nadvanced ventilation and shading system. Air exchange takes place through two air distribution \ncorridors where air is mixed with outside air and pumped back into the greenhouse. Overall, semi-\nclosed greenhouses have two to three times higher yields and are three to four times more water-\nefficient than traditional open-field horticulture because they can control temperature, humidity, \ncarbon dioxide and pest population, and are equipped with advanced drip irrigation systems. \nSemi-closed technology can decrease operational costs by (i) reducing heating costs as internal \nand external air is mixed in the corridors to reach the suitable temperature; and (ii) reducing agri-\nchemical treatment cost because there is almost no access for pests to enter the greenhouse.   \n \n14.  Climate-controlled semi-closed greenhouses have higher climate adaptation benefits than \nthe greenhouses typically used by Armenian farmers, as these cannot appropriately control \nweather conditions during the entire year and are also more exposed to damage climate change \nrisks such as flooding, extreme temperatures, and excessive snow loading. The incremental cost \n                                                \nsemi-closed greenhouse technology provides active and optimal air conditioning and cooling inside the greenhouse \nduring hot seasons, and moisture and cool climate conditions during cold seasons. \n12 Closed greenhouses represent the older generation of climate-controlled greenhouses, in which the only way to \ncontrol the temperature is to open the ventilation windows and exchange air with the outside air. Insects come into \nthe greenhouse together with the exchanging air, making it more difficult to control diseases. \n ", "4   \nto achieve higher climate adaptation benefits is around 59% of the total ADB loan amount, which \nis equivalent to $18.8 million.13  \n \n3.  Borrower \n \n15.  Spayka was established in 2001 in Armenia as a freight forwarding company. Its business \ngradually grew into trading and exporting fresh fruits and vegetables to the Russian Federation, \nthe rest of the Commonwealth of Independent States,14 and Europe. Spayka is the largest \nexporter of agrarian production with more than 90% market share in tomato and pepper exports \nfrom Armenia. In addition to exporting fruits and vegetables, Spayka has been engaged in trading \ndairy products, producing canned food, packaging production and vehicle services to achieve the \nvertical integration strategy. As of 2017, the company has 886 employees, including 60% women. \n \n16.  Spayka\u2019s senior management team consists of national and international specialists with \nsubstantial  industry  knowledge  and  experience.  They  have  broad  experience  in  finance, \nagronomy, marketing and sales, greenhouse management, and engineering. Davit Ghazaryan, \nthe chief executive officer and founder of Spayka, has over 16 years of management experience.  \n \n17.  Integrity due diligence was conducted.15 No significant or potentially significant integrity \nrisks were identified. Tax integrity due diligence was not required.16  \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n18.  Impacts. The project  is aligned with the following  impacts and consistent with key \nobjectives  of  the  Armenian  Development  Strategy  2025:  (i)  the  development  of  a  modern \nagriculture  sector  through  \u201cindustrialization\u201d  (including  through  the  application  of  modern \ntechnologies like greenhouses), (ii) the promotion of exports of agricultural products in support of \nan  export oriented  economy  and  the  integration  of  the  Armenian  economy  into  regional \ncooperation formats and the international economy in general, and (iii) increased employment \nand a min\u2010imum salary through the creation of quality and well-paid jobs as one of the main \nconditions to eradicate poverty and redistribute income.17 \n \n19.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: the promotion of high-efficiency, \nenvironmentally sound, and export-oriented horticultural production based on climate-resilient \ntechnologies such as semi-closed greenhouses and drip irrigation systems. Annual production \nfrom this project is expected to reach 6.4 million kg of tomatoes and 1.1 million kg of bell peppers \nby 2022. The project will create about 275 full-time jobs, including 35 management team members \nand agronomists and 240 workers for nursing, plantation, and pickup. \n \n20.  Outputs. (i) increased greenhouse operations, (ii) increased contribution of horticulture to \nthe local economy, and (iii) increased and improved employment and training opportunities for \nfemale employees. Indicators are included in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n                                                \n13 The total costs of semi-closed greenhouses and Armenian farmers\u2019 greenhouses are $1,228,000 per ha and \n$507,600 per ha, respectively. The incremental cost to achieve higher climate adaptation benefits is around 59%.  \n14 The Commonwealth of Independent States includes Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. \n15 ADB. 2003.

The project promotes the \nimprovement of agricultural productivity through investments in research and development, water \ninfrastructure, and agribusiness, which are emphasized by ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020.18 ADB\u2019s Armenia country partnership strategy is based on three development pillars: \n(i) high and sustainable economic growth, (ii) broadened access to economic opportunities, and \n(iii)  strengthened  social  protection.19 The  project  supports  pillars  (i)  and  (ii)  since  Spayka \ntransports goods to the Russian Federation through Georgia, owns logistics assets in Georgia, \nand sources products from Georgian farmers. The project is also fully consistent with ADB\u2019s \nOperational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, which under its \u201cOperational Direction \n2: Raising Competitiveness in Connected Markets\u201d calls for \u201cimproved growth and business \ncompetitiveness in regional markets through new opportunities in cross-border trade, investment, \ntechnology, finance, and labor mobility.\u201d20 \n \n22.  Consistency with the sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is \naligned with the four priorities of ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, \nas follows: (i) increasing the productivity and reducing pre- and post-harvest losses of food crops; \n(ii) improving market connectivity and value chain linkages; (iii) enhancing food safety, quality, \nand nutrition; and (iv) enhancing the management and climate resilience of natural resources.21 \nThe project will complement  two Armenian sovereign investment projects north-south road \ncorridor and Armenia-Georgia border regional road (M6 Vanadzor-Bagratashen)22 which aim to \ndevelop more accessible, higher quality, and more frequent road transport; and create more \nbusiness opportunities for private sector companies in rural areas, particularly in agribusiness and \nservices.23 \n \nD.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n27.  ADB will extend a loan of up to $32,000,000 to Spayka. Terms and conditions have been \nagreed with Spayka. \n \n                                                \n24 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 The project is an inclusive business assistance because it provides decent employment and income opportunities to \nlow-income workers and farmers. Spayka\u2019s greenhouse employees will earn more than the average salary in the \nagriculture sector. Spayka sources from 5,000 farmers, the majority of them in the bottom 60% of income distribution. \n ", "    7 \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n28.  ADB assistance will add value on several fronts: \n(i)  Long-term  financing.  ADB  will  provide  long-term  debt  which  is  not  readily \navailable in Armenia. ADB is in a unique position to offer such financing because \nof  its  understanding  of  the  agriculture  sector  and  experience  in  greenhouse \nhorticulture financing in other countries. \n(ii)  Promotion of high-efficiency technology. ADB\u2019s support will encourage the use \nof  semi-closed  greenhouse  technology  that  is  productivity-enhancing  and \nenvironmentally sound (reducing the use of land, water, energy, and other inputs). \n(iii)  Safeguard best practices. ADB will help Spayka develop a robust environmental \nand social management plan following the best international safeguard practices, \nand will monitor the company\u2019s progress during project implementation.  \n \nC.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is \nclassified as category B for the environment and category C for involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples. An initial environmental examination report has been prepared to meet \nADB\u2019s requirements. The project location is devoid of any dense vegetation, structures, or \nhabitation; therefore, no significant site disturbance will occur. The potential environmental and \nsocial impacts of the project have been identified during due diligence, and effective measures to \navoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are being incorporated in the \nenvironmental and social management plan. The greenhouses will be equipped with Priva \nprocess  computers  that  will  control  and  monitor  the  climate,  water  quality,  and  energy \nconsumption to create the most optimal growing conditions for the crops inside the greenhouses. \nSpayka\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to manage the project\u2019s social and environment \nimpacts are deemed adequate. \n \n30.  This project will be built on a 47.76 ha plot of land donated by the Government of Yerevan \nMunicipality. In the 1990s, people were issued permits to cultivate the land, which was under the \ncontrol of Shengavit Community. These permits were canceled in 2008 when a law was passed \nchanging the status of the communities to administrative districts. In 2012, Yerevan Municipality \nacquired the land to be managed by the Armenian Crop Promoting Centre (a public\u2013private \npartnership that became a private company in 2014) for the development of a greenhouse facility. \nThe  government  compensated  the  remaining  users  of  the  community  land;  however,  the \ngreenhouse development did not materialize as some conditions were not met. The land was left \nunused from 2012 until 2017. In early 2017, Spayka applied to the government for the allocation \nof a land plot to develop a greenhouse complex. In July 2017, Yerevan Municipality and Spayka \nsigned a donation contract and a property certificate was issued to Spayka. No one is currently \nliving on or using the land, and there are no outstanding complaints with regard to the land. \n \n31.  Yerevan  is  largely  a  mono-ethnic  municipality,  with  98.9%  of  the  population  being \nArmenians. The main ethnic minorities are Yazidis (0.3%) and Russians (0.5%). The greenhouse \n ", "8   \nproject is in Yerevan Municipality in Shengavit Administrative District, which is inhabited mostly \nby Armenians and a few ethnic minorities already mainstreamed into society. \n \n32.  Other social dimensions. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \nSpayka will implement a gender action plan that includes (i) employing 240 greenhouse workers \n(65% women); and (ii) improving the company\u2019s human resource policy to include provisions \nensuring equal opportunities for female employees, including gender equality in recruitment, \ntraining, parental leave and childcare provisions, equal pay for equal work, and the prohibition of \nsexual harassment in the workplace, among others.26 Spayka will comply with national labor laws \nand, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the \ninternationally recognized core labor standards.27 Spayka will report regularly to ADB on its and \nits contractors\u2019 compliance with such laws, and the measures taken.28 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n33.  Spayka was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe loan documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money laundering, \nand the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n[Redacted] \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n34.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),29 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of Armenia \nhas no objection to the proposed assistance to Spayka. ADB will enter into suitable finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$32,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to Spayka Limited Liability Company for the \nHigh-Efficiency Horticulture and Integrated Supply Chain Project in Armenia, with such terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board. \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n12 January 2018 \n                                                \n26 Gender Action Plan (available from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 ADB. 2003.
