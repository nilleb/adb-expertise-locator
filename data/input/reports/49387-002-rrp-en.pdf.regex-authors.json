THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia and a grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for \nthe Second Greater Mekong Subregion Tourism Infrastructure for Inclusive Growth Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will help transform secondary towns in the central and southern corridors of \nthe  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  into  economically  inclusive,  competitive  tourism \ndestinations by improving transport infrastructure, urban sanitation, and capacity to sustainably \nmanage tourism growth. 2 It will boost trade in services by promoting cross-border tourism, and \ndeepen GMS and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional cooperation and \nintegration.  About  97,000  residents  are  expected  to  directly  benefit  from  climate-resilient \ninfrastructure development and better access to economic opportunities. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector  overview  and  performance.  Remarkably,  about  80%  of  global  travel  is \nintraregional. Forecasts suggest that Asia and the Pacific will be the world\u2019s fastest-growing \nregion through 2030, when it will receive 535 million tourists, or 30% of the global market share. \nIn 2016, ASEAN countries received 116 million international tourists, up 42% compared with 2011. \nASEAN arrivals are expected to grow 5.1% per year and reach 187 million in 2030.3 Cambodia \nand the Lao PDR receive about 8% of ASEAN arrivals and actively cooperate to promote \nmulticountry tour programs that connect the two economies with larger, more affluent regional \nmarkets. Tourism directly contributes 12.2% to Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product and 4.3% to \nthe Lao PDR\u2019s gross domestic product, generating 70%\u201378% of service exports and $3.7 billion \nin annual visitor expenditure. Tourism is employment intensive, providing jobs for about 1.1 million \nCambodian and Lao workers\u23afthe majority are women in small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs). In total, Cambodia and the Lao PDR aim to create 900,000 tourism-related jobs and \nincrease international visitor expenditure to $6 billion per year by 2020. \n \n4.  Government efforts to upgrade gateway airports, transnational railways and highways, \nand secondary roads to boost travel and trade are supported by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and other development partners. Regional policies to liberalize transport services and ease \ncross-border tourism complement physical infrastructure investments.4 For example, Cambodia \nand the Lao PDR permit tourist visas on arrival for about 180 countries and grant 15-day tourist \nvisa exemptions to citizens of all ASEAN countries. As a result, more than 5 million tourists enter \nthe two countries each year using private buses or personal vehicles. \n \n5.  Key challenges. Even with these strengths and opportunities, Cambodia and the Lao \nPDR rank low in the World Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Index, mainly because secondary \ndestinations lack modern transport infrastructure, quality urban environmental services, and the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided transaction technical assistance to help design the project and prepare \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion Tourism Sector Strategy 2016\u20132025.

Master Plan for ASEAN Connectivity 2025. Jakarta. \n ", "2 \ncapacity to sustainably manage infrastructure assets.5Other underlying constraints are low \nservice standards, inadequate tourism planning, and insufficient marketing, which collectively \nweaken the business-enabling environment for tourism. Consequently, in 2016 Cambodia\u2019s \ninternational tourist arrival growth decelerated to 5%, about half the medium-term rate, and the \nLao PDR\u2019s arrivals fell by 9.5% compared with 2015. Fewer visitors and lower spending because \nof poor sanitation and hygiene reduces economic benefits by at least $90 million per year. \nMoreover, average expenditure per visitor in Cambodia ($641) and the Lao PDR ($171) is well \nbelow  Asia  and  the  Pacific\u2019s  benchmark  of  $1,500.  Imbalanced  tourism  growth  within  the \ncountries is another consequence of underinvestment in secondary destinations. About half of \ninternational tourist arrivals and corresponding visitor expenditure, destination investment, and \ntourism employment are concentrated in just three cities: Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Vientiane \nCapital.6 \n \n6.  Climate vulnerability. Secondary towns in the GMS corridors are vulnerable to climate \nchange  and  natural  disasters.  Risks  include  storm  surges  along  Cambodia\u2019s  coast,  and \nintensifying rainfall and flooding in the Lao PDR\u2019s central and southern river valleys. These are \nexacerbated  by  limited  country  capacity  to  integrate  adaptation  and  mitigation  solutions. \nCountering climate change and natural disasters requires finance and knowledge to retrofit and \nconstruct climate-resilient infrastructure and promote resource-efficiency certification programs. \nPublic awareness campaigns to promote lower-carbon travel, emission offsets, and environment-\nfriendly tourism services are also needed. \n \n7.  To help remove these constraints, the project builds on ADB\u2019s well-performing GMS \ntourism operations by strategically financing climate-resilient roads, water transport infrastructure, \nurban infrastructure, and capacity building for better destination management, all of which is \nneeded to boost tourist arrivals and spending in secondary destinations.7 Priority investments are \n(i) road improvements to decongest and link urban areas with rural community-managed tourist \nattractions, (ii) small ferry ports to increase passenger-handling capacities and give private \noperators the facilities needed to expand water transport and recreation services, (iii) drainage \nand riverbank protection in flood-prone areas, (iv) modern solid waste and septic management \nsystems, and (v) capacity building to support the implementation of ASEAN tourism standards \nand improve the business-enabling environment for tourism. The integrated design will assist \nCambodia and the Lao PDR in attracting more and higher-spending visitors to secondary GMS \ncentral and southern coastal corridor towns, thus contributing to more balanced tourism growth \nand employment-intensive SME development in lagging areas. \n \n8.  Policy strategy framework. The project is consistent with Cambodia\u2019s National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 2014\u20132018 and the Lao PDR\u2019s National Socioeconomic Development Plan \n2016\u20132020, which emphasize infrastructure improvements and private sector development to \nsupport  employment  and  income  generation,  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  climate \nresilience,  gender  equity,  and  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  It  is  aligned  with  the \noverarching goals of poverty reduction through sustained and inclusive economic growth, as \n                                                \n5  In 2016, Cambodia ranked 101st and the Lao PDR ranked 94th among 136 economies evaluated. \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Tourism in Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  ADB. 2014.

The project directly supports the implementation of the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy \n2016\u20132025 and ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration 2016\u20132020.9 \n \n9.  Development coordination. Project activities harmonize with tourism vocational training \nsupport from the Government of Luxembourg and the Swiss Agency for Development and \nCooperation. The Japan International Cooperation Agency and the World Bank Group also \nsupport  transport  and  urban  development  in  the  GMS  corridors.  Regional  assistance  is \ncoordinated by GMS tourism, transport, and urban development working groups comprising \nsenior officials, ADB and other development partners, civil society organizations, and private \nadvisors. Working groups meet at least once a year to direct strategic programming, share \nknowledge and good practices, and coordinate joint activities. Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Tourism \n(MOT) and the Lao PDR\u2019s Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism (MICT) coordinate national \ntourism planning and policy dialogue with development partners and tourism industry associations. \n \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. Value added by ADB includes support to prepare the \nGMS Tourism Sector Strategy 2016\u20132025. The $58.7 billion strategy provides government and \nthe  private  sector  with  a  blueprint  for  competitive,  balanced,  and  sustainable  destination \ndevelopment that aligns with ASEAN regional integration objectives. ADB facilitated public\u2013\nprivate dialogue and consensus building to prioritize project investments that build synergies with \nregional agriculture, transport, and urban development initiatives. Climate risk assessments and \ndetailed engineering designs for representative infrastructure subprojects were prepared with \nsupport from the ADB Project Readiness Improvement Trust Fund.10 The building of capacity for \ndestination management integrates the Mekong Innovative Startup in Tourism accelerator to \nidentify and scale technologies that drive secondary destination tourism growth. The Mekong \nBusiness Initiative, supported by ADB and the Government of Australia, created the platform. \n \n11.  Lessons. To reinforce sustainability and inclusiveness, the project design assimilates key \nlessons from ADB\u2019s GMS tourism sector assistance program. First, infrastructure and tourism \ncapacity-building programs were selected based on robust demand analysis and private sector \nconsultations. Second, engineering solutions were chosen in consideration of lifecycle costs and \nwere  informed  by  climate  change  vulnerability  assessments.  Third,  business  development \nservices target SMEs with low startup costs that are predominately led by women. Fourth, \ninstitutional  strengthening  promotes  women\u2019s  attainment  of  managerial  roles.  Finally,  early \ncapacity building for infrastructure operation and maintenance (O&M) will ensure that suitable \nasset management systems are in place before works are commissioned.11 \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.

Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: sustainable, inclusive, and more balanced \ntourism  development  achieved. 12  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  tourism \ncompetitiveness of secondary towns in Cambodia and the Lao PDR increased. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  Output 1: Urban\u2013rural access infrastructure and urban environmental services \nimproved. This output focuses on improving roads, water transport infrastructure, and waste \nmanagement in tourist sites. It will (i) upgrade 10.4 kilometers of urban roads in Cambodia and \n62.6 kilometers of urban and rural roads in the Lao PDR; (ii) build two ferry ports in Cambodia \nand two ferry ports in the Lao PDR; and (iii) construct controlled landfills in Kep, Cambodia and \nVang Vieng, Lao PDR. About 32,500 residents living along the roads will benefit from better \naccess to economic opportunities and social services. Road upgrades include drainage and \nembankment protection to mitigate flood risk. Ferry port construction will improve water transport \nservices between Cambodia\u2019s coast and Koh Rong archipelago. The Lao PDR\u2019s new ferry ports \nwill widen access to the Nam Ngum hydropower reservoir\u23afthe country\u2019s largest\u23afand Mekong \nRiver islands bordering Cambodia. The ports will benefit 4,300 residents and about 300 small \nferry operators. Each landfill will safely impound up to 720,000 cubic meters of solid waste and \ninclude  technology  to  recover  recyclables,  treat  leachate  and  septage,  and  mitigate  gas \nemissions.13 Expanded and more reliable waste collection will benefit 5,700 households. \n \n14.  Output 2: Capacity to implement ASEAN tourism standards strengthened. This \noutput will (i) strengthen assessment frameworks, certification bodies, and compliance monitoring \nfor the ASEAN green hotel, community-based tourism, homestay, clean tourist city, and clean \npublic toilet standards; and (ii) develop incentives and conduct training to enable standards \nadoption by tourism and urban service providers. The project\u2019s intensive capacity support will help \nKampot, Kep, and Preah Sihanouk in Cambodia; and Luang Prabang, Pakse, and Vang Vieng in \nthe Lao PDR attain the ASEAN clean tourist city standard. In total, the project will assist more \nthan 250 tourism SMEs in becoming more competitive by improving service quality and consumer \nconfidence. Attaining the ASEAN clean tourist city standard will improve the urban environment \nfor about 325,000 residents and 6.5 million tourists who visit the targeted towns each year. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Institutional  arrangements  for  tourism  destination  management  and \ninfrastructure O&M strengthened. Output 3 will strengthen Cambodia\u2019s provincial tourism \ndevelopment and management committees and the Lao PDR\u2019s sustainable tourism destination \nmanagement network. In both countries, the project will support (i) preparation of destination \nmanagement plans, (ii) public\u2013private policy dialogue to improve the business environment, \n(iii) SME business development services, (iv) tourism management training for public officials, (v) \ntourism  marketing,  and  (vi)  knowledge  management.  In  parallel,  the  project  will  (i)  assist \ninfrastructure  management  entities  (including  private  contractors)  to  prepare  O&M  plans, \n(ii) organize  technical  training  to  improve  infrastructure  asset  management,  (iii)  conduct \nsanitation- and hygiene-awareness campaigns, and (iv) provide transaction advisors to structure \ncompetitive procurement for solid waste management and ferry services. \n \n                                                \n12 ASEAN Secretariat. 2016.

Implementation arrangements follow long-established successful practices. The GMS \nTourism Working Group will be the project\u2019s subregional steering committee and coordinate joint \nmarketing  and  regional  tourism  standards  adoption.  National  project  steering  committees \ncomprising ministries and provincial departments will meet periodically to review progress and \nsupport interagency coordination. MICT and MOT will be the project executing agencies.

Consultants will assist the executing and implementing agencies with \nproject  management,  detailed  engineering  design,  construction  supervision,  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building, safeguards, and the gender action plan (GAP). Local focal \npoints will represent community-based organizations and industry associations to ensure good \ncoordination between project managers and the intended beneficiaries. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The  project  is  technically  feasible.  Suitable  engineering  solutions  were  selected \nconsidering cost, durability, climate, environmental and social impacts, and O&M capacities. \nPreliminary designs comply with Cambodia and the Lao PDR\u2019s construction standards and local \ncontracting industry capabilities. Climate resilience measures include stronger road-base and \npavement structures, higher capacity drainage, energy-efficient streetlights, and bio-engineered \nriver embankment and slope protection. Passenger piers incorporate sturdy elevated concrete \nand steel structures able to withstand projected storm surges and river flow velocities. Managed \nlandfills  will  be  constructed  on  existing  open  dumpsites  and  use  impermeable  liners  and \ngreenhouse gas abatement technologies to prevent air and groundwater pollution. Programs to \nbuild destination management capacity were designed based on training needs assessments and \ninstitutional analyses of tourism, transport, and urban management entities. Special design \nfeatures to uphold sustainable infrastructure maintenance include maximum use of robustly \nengineered steel-reinforced concrete roads with lower lifecycle O&M costs, and resources to \nstrengthen  provincial  infrastructure  O&M  planning  and  budgeting.  The  project  will  procure \nappropriate  O&M  equipment  and  assist  management  entities  in  incorporating  maintenance \nrequirements into ferry port and waste management services contracts. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic analyses were prepared for the integrated project components following ADB \nguidelines.16 Costs comprise infrastructure and capacity-building investments and the market \nvalue of minor land acquisition. Benefits quantified conservatively include (i) increased tourism \nreceipts from incremental visitor arrivals and length of stay in project areas, (ii) vehicle operating \ncost savings from reductions in road roughness, and (iii) health benefits and tourism loss-\navoidance from better solid waste management practices. Base-case economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRR) range from 19.3% to 28.0% for road improvement subprojects, and from 12.7% to \n23.2% for the ferry ports. EIRRs for solid waste management improvements in Kep (22.9%) and \nVang Vieng (29.4%) also exceed the 9% social discount rate. All subprojects remain viable under \nadverse scenarios whereby costs are 10% higher, benefits 10% lower, implementation is delayed \nby 1 year, or there are 10% fewer tourist arrivals. The expected economic benefits are consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s completed GMS tourism projects in Cambodia and the Lao PDR, which generated \nEIRRs ranging from 16.0% to 78.2% for similar road, small port, and urban waste management \nimprovements in secondary tourist destinations, which benefited about 220,000 residents.17 \n \n23.  Financial analyses prepared following ADB guidelines confirm the financial viability of both \nthe revenue-generating solid waste management improvement subprojects and Preah Sihanouk \nCity\u2013Koh Rong ferry ports.18 Financial internal rates of return range from 11.9% to 12.6% for \n                                                \n16 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n18 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nCambodian subprojects, higher than the 10.6% weighted average cost of capital. The base-case \nfinancial internal rate of return for Vang Vieng solid waste management improvements is 3.5%, \nhigher than the Lao PDR\u2019s 2.5% weighted average cost of capital. Quantified revenue streams \ncomprising  waste  collection  tariffs,  environmental  fees  to  be  introduced  by  the  respective \nprovincial governments, and port fees are sufficient to fund O&M. Roads that do not generate \nrevenue and the Lao PDR\u2019s port subprojects will require additional national budgetary allocations \nfor routine and periodic maintenance. Loan and grant assurances confirm the governments\u2019 \ncommitments to funding sustainable asset maintenance. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  The  financial  management  and  procurement  risks  for  Cambodia\u2019s  executing  and \nimplementing agencies is rated high. The main constraint is the lack of qualified accountants and \nprocurement specialists in provinces. The overall risk rating for the Lao PDR is also high because \nof similar constraints, exacerbated by weak audit, financial management, and procurement \noversight.  Risk  mitigation  measures  in  the  financial  management  action  plans  emphasize \nintensive on-the-job counterpart staff training and requirements to use standard ADB-approved \ndocuments for all procurement transactions. Both executing agencies have significant experience \nin managing advance accounts and statement-of-expenditure procedures. The terms of reference \nfor external auditors were agreed with the executing agencies during project preparation and form \npart of the PAMs. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the governments, MICT, MOT, and other agencies involved in the project. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAMs. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n25.  The project will directly benefit about 23,000 people in Cambodia and 74,000 people in \nthe Lao PDR.19 Poverty rates in project areas range from 12.0% to 19.9% because of low incomes, \ninsufficient productive assets and public infrastructure, shortages of quality enterprise support \nservices, and underdeveloped human capital. While Cambodia and the Lao PDR significantly \nreduced poverty during 2003\u20132013, inequality is widening. For instance, the Lao PDR\u2019s Gini \ncoefficient rose from 0.31 to 0.36 over this period. The project\u2019s integrated infrastructure and \ncapacity investments are designed to minimize these constraints and diversify employment and \nincome-generating opportunities for rural and urban households. Stakeholder communication and \nparticipation plans include activities to help women and vulnerable groups recognize and avoid \nsocial risks associated with tourism, such as human trafficking and child exploitation. \n \n26.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. MICT and MOT \nprepared the GAP in consultation with project beneficiaries, civil society organizations, and \ngovernment officials. PCUs, Cambodia\u2019s infrastructure project management unit, and PIUs will \nimplement and monitor the GAP. Specific actions to promote gender equality include (i) separate \nconsultations with women and men to ensure gender-sensitive detailed engineering designs; \n(ii) requirements to involve women in infrastructure construction and management; (iii) equal \nparticipation in sanitation awareness, road safety, and HIV/AIDS prevention programs; and \n(iv) women\u2019s appointment as managers and leaders of tourism standards assessment boards, \ndestination  management  organizations,  and  project  management  entities.  The  project \nperformance management system will compile sex- and ethnic-disaggregated data to monitor and \nevaluate results. \n \n                                                \n19 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguards \ncategorization is B for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.20 All \nsafeguards documents were prepared based on meaningful consultations with affected people \nand communities, endorsed by government authorities, and disclosed on the ADB website \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy  2011.  Grievance  redress,  monitoring,  and \nreporting  procedures  are  properly  established  in  all  safeguards  documents.  During  project \nimplementation, all safeguard documents will be updated based on detailed engineering designs, \nreviewed by ADB, and publicly disclosed. The project includes adequate resources to update all \nsafeguard documents and build counterpart capacity to implement environmental and social \nmonitoring. \n \n28.  Environment (category B). MICT and MOT each prepared one initial environmental \nexamination and two environmental management plans (EMPs), covering the project\u2019s area of \ninfluence and all road, port, and landfill subprojects. The EMPs provide adequate measures to \nmitigate the expected minor and temporary construction impacts and the potential adverse \nenvironmental impacts of increased tourism activity, particularly near marine and terrestrial-\nprotected areas. Improved solid waste and septage management, better roads and drainage, and \nthe adoption of ASEAN tourism standards are expected to generate overall net environmental \nbenefits. Loan and grant covenants require contractors and destination management agencies to \ncomply with initial environmental examination and EMP mitigation measures. \n \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  Involuntary  resettlement  impacts  will  be \nadequately managed by implementing resettlement plans agreed by the governments and ADB. \nOverall, 23 households with 76 persons will be affected by minor loss of structures and temporary \nbusiness disruption within the right-of-way in Preah Sihanouk, Cambodia. In the Lao PDR, 59 \nhouseholds with 274 persons will be affected, 19 of them (with 79 persons) severely because \nthey must move their shops about 300 meters. Initial resettlement and compensation costs are \nestimated at $64,176 for Cambodia and $300,513 for the Lao PDR. This amount is considered \nadequate  based  on  the  inventories  of  losses  prepared  in  consultation  with  the  affected \nhouseholds. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category B). The project will positively affect Hmong, Iu Mien, \nKhmu, and Tai Dam ethnic groups in the Lao PDR project areas by creating culturally appropriate \njobs, diversifying income, and strengthening tourism management by ethnic communities. Ethnic \ngroups will equally benefit from improved access to markets and social services, better waste \nmanagement, and capacity building. The Lao PDR\u2019s indigenous peoples plan identifies the \npotential negative impacts and adequate measures to mitigate them. The Lao PDR will appoint \nqualified PCU and PIU staff to properly implement the indigenous peoples plan using project \nresources. Due diligence confirms that no indigenous peoples will suffer any impacts in Cambodia. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n31.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n                                                \n20 ADB.
