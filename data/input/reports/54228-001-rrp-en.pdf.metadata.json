The \nprogram\u2019s design draws on the operational knowledge that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas  gained  through  its  engagement  in  the  health  sector  in  Mongolia  since  1993.  Through  a \nstrategic, coordinated, and well-sequenced set of policy actions, the program will facilitate both \nimmediate  and  critical  medium-term  reforms.  The  provision  of  a  $100  million  loan  will  directly \ncontribute  to  address  the  urgent  financing  needs  of  the  Government  of  Mongolia.  Four  reform \nareas identified under the program will focus on (i) strengthening planning and preparedness of \nthe  health  sector,  and  ensuring  the  availability  of  critical  medicines  and  emergency  supplies; \n(ii) improving  national  pharmaceutical  regulation,  and  increasing  hospital  autonomy  and  good \ngovernance;  (iii) enhancing  procurement  in  the  health  sector  to  increase  efficiency,  and \nestablishing a single purchaser for health services; and (iv) safeguarding fiscal sustainability of \nthe government over the medium term (3\u20135 years). \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDeep economic contraction because of COVID-19. The economy contracted by 5.3% \nin  2020  year-over-year  (YoY)  reflecting  the  severe  impact  of  COVID-19  on  the  Mongolian \neconomy. The mining industry contracted by 9.4% in 2020 because of substantially lower export \ndemand.  This  spilled  over  to  other  sectors,  with  only  agriculture  and  manufacturing  not \ncontracting. On the demand side, private consumption, government consumption, and net exports \nall grew, but investment dragged growth down significantly by 19.1 percentage points. In 2020, \nthe current account deficit fell by 73.3% YoY to 4.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), though \nthe financial account surplus shrank by 48.1% YoY to 10.6% of GDP, resulting in a balance-of-\npayments surplus of $787 million. Revenues will fall by 16.8% for 2020, while expenditure will rise \nby 5.1%. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 plan, the overall fiscal balance will deteriorate to 9.9% \nof the GDP and the structural fiscal balance will deteriorate to 12.5% of the GDP. \n \n4. \nGovernment  remains  committed  to  macroeconomic  reform.  According  to  the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  assessment  letter,  Mongolia  continues  to  face  three  key \nmacroeconomic  challenges:  (i)  high  public  debt,  (ii)  low  foreign  exchange  reserves,  and \n(iii) insufficient capital buffers in banks. 1 On the fiscal side, the government reduced the debt-to-\nGDP ratio from 109.1% in 2016 to 79.1% in 2019. Fiscal pressures because of COVID-19 will \nincrease debt by 14.5 percentage points in 2020, but the downward trajectory of the debt-to-GDP \nratio will return with the resumption of growth in 2021. Further, under reform area 4 of the program \n(para. 21), the government has committed to reduce the structural deficit to 5.1% in 2021, in line \nwith the fiscal consolidation plans under the Fiscal Stability Law, 2010. Gross reserves increased \nfrom 2.8 months of goods and services imports at the end of 2016 to 5.8 months at the end of \n2019. According to the IMF, the level of reserves is sufficient to limit the risk of a capital account \ncrisis, but risks relating to upcoming debt repayments remain. The recapitalization of the banking \n\n1  IMF Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nsector remains an outstanding issue and has been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic. The \nappropriate measures taken by the Bank of Mongolia to respond to the pressures of the COVID-\n19 pandemic did limit the burden on firms and households, but it will be important to exit from \nthese measures carefully as the COVID-19 pandemic recedes, closely monitor capital adequacy \nin selected banks, ensure there is a transparent assessment of risks facing the banking sector, \nand act decisively if banks face liquidity pressures again. \n \n5. \nDecisive response to COVID-19 pandemic initially prevented large-scale community \ntransmission. The government initiated stringent emergency measures to prevent the spread of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic in Mongolia. These measures included international and national travel \nrestrictions;  the  closure  of  nonessential  businesses;  public  awareness  campaigns  focused  on \ncontaining the spread of the virus; preparation of hospitals to manage emergencies in the event \nof a surge in infected patients; restrictions on public gatherings, meetings, and celebrations; and \nthe closure of schools. These actions delayed community spread, and Mongolia only recorded \nthe first case of locally transmitted COVID-19 on 11 November 2020. As of 28 February 2021, the \ntotal number of cases was 2,907, of which 414 were imported, with 4 deaths. Since 12 November \n2020, the country has initiated several national lockdowns as the government undertakes contact \ntracing, testing, and containment policies. The most recent lockdown ended on 23 February 2021. \nSince 23 February 2021, the government has begun the vaccine rollout, prioritizing health workers \nand the most at risk populations. Mongolia is securing vaccines from a combination of sources, \nincluding the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX). 2 \n \n6. \nSignificant progress in improving health outcomes in recent years. The average life \nexpectancy at birth increased to 70 years in 2018, up from 69 in 2016. 3 Mongolia achieved its \nMillennium Development Goal targets in 2015 for maternal and child mortality. The infant mortality \nrate decreased to 14 per 1,000 live births in 2018 from 16 per 1,000 live births in 2015, and the \nunder-5 mortality rate decreased to 16 per 1,000 live births in 2018 from 19 per 1,000 live births \nin 2015. Similarly, the maternal mortality ratio decreased to 45 per 100,000 live births in 2017 \nfrom 51 per 100,000 live births in 2013. \n \n7. \nCommunity  transmission  is  straining  the  health  sector.  The  government  estimates \nabout 60% of the population is at high risk of infection. A surge in infections would result in  a \nshortage of quarantine facilities, necessary equipment, drugs, and other essential resources. A \n2017 World Health Organization evaluation concluded that Mongolia\u2019s core capacities relating to \npandemic preparedness are limited, suggesting Mongolia is ill prepared for a surge of COVID-19 \nor  a  similar  pandemic. 4 Mongolia\u2019s  National  Emergency  Management  Agency  has  a  disaster \nmanagement  plan,  but  this  plan  does  not  clearly  define  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  other \ninvolved  national  agencies.  The  evaluation  concluded  that  Mongolia  remains  vulnerable  to \nemerging diseases and public health emergencies, and challenges exist in the national system\u2019s \nreadiness  to  respond  to  large-scale  and  complex  events  in  an  effective  and  coordinated  way. \nSystemic health sector constraints are also further amplified during health crises. Under reform \narea  1  (para.  18),  several  policy  actions  are  introduced  to  strengthen  Mongolia\u2019s  immediate \n\n \n\n2   The Government of Mongolia has received vaccine donations from the Government of India and the Government of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China. Mongolia joined COVAX facility in July 2020 and will receive vaccines in the first \nround of allocations. \n\n3  In  2016,  female  life  expectancy  was  73.5  years  and  male  life  expectancy  was  65.3  years.  By  2018,  female  life \nexpectancy was 73.9 and male life expectancy was 65.6 years. World Bank. World Bank Indicators (accessed 20 \nNovember 2020). \n\n4  World Health Organization. 2017. Joint External Evaluation of International Health Regulation Core Capacities of \n\nMongolia. Geneva. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nineffective  and \n\nCOVID-19  pandemic  accentuates \n\nresponse capacity in relation to COVID-19 pandemic and possible similar future health crises. A \nnumber of health sector inefficiencies persist that affect the quality of health services provided. \n \n8. \ninefficient  governance \narrangements  around  public  hospitals  that  weaken  treatment  capacities.  Rigid  line-item \nbudgeting  in  public  hospitals  is  an  important  source  of  inefficiency  in  the  management  and \nfinancing of hospitals. Input-based budgeting is poorly linked to the actual costs and volume of \nservices, and hospitals are unable to manage their human resources or reallocate funds between \ncost categories without first requesting approvals from the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry \nof Finance (MOF). Savings at the end of the fiscal year (December) are automatically returned to \nMOF, discouraging hospital managers from pursuing efficiency gains. 5 Such systemic issues limit \neffective and efficient hospital treatment as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Reform area 2 \n(para.19) includes several policy actions that will strengthen existing governance arrangements \nin the health sector. Another area that leads to inefficient governance arrangements in the health \nsector is the absence of an effectively regulated pharmaceutical sector. \n \n9. \nExpensive  and  poor  quality  medicines,  and  their  inappropriate  use,  affect  health \nsecurity.  The  prevalence  of  substandard  (10.1%),  unregistered  (4.3%),  and  falsified  (0.8%) \nmedicines in Mongolia is one of the highest in the world. 6 Pharmaceutical regulation is also highly \nfragmented.  Functions  such  as  licensing  and  registration,  pricing,  quality  control,  market \nsurveillance and control, inspection and enforcement, implementation of an integrated regulatory \ninformation  system,  and  enforcing  rational  drug  use  are  implemented  by  different  agencies \ninstead  of  one  single  drug  regulatory  authority,  leading  to  poor  coordination  and  increased \ninefficiencies. Pharmaceutical inefficiencies also lead to significant constraints as Mongolia rolls \nout its COVID-19 vaccination program. The procurement of medicines in public hospitals is also \ndecentralized, with each hospital being responsible for its own purchasing and drug budgets. This \nsystem increases unit costs of medicines in public hospitals and leads to quality and efficiency \nconstraints  in  the  pharmaceutical  sector,  which  affects  health  security.  Procurement  efficiency \ngains  and better pharmaceutical regulation  in the health sector need to be addressed through \nvarious policy reforms. \n \n10. \nHealth  financing  constraints  amplified  during  pandemics.  There  are  three  main \nsources  of health  financing:  (i)  state  budget,  (ii)  social  health  insurance,  and  (iii)  out-of-pocket \nexpenditure (OPE). This multi-payer system creates inefficiencies and increases administrative \ncosts.  In  addition,  although  90%  of  the  population  is  covered  by  social  health  insurance,  the \nbenefit  package  is  limited,  with  social  health  insurance  covering  mainly  inpatient  services. \nBecause of the gaps in service coverage, OPE accounts for 32% of total health costs, of which \none-third are for medicines, because of high prices and inappropriate use. This inadequate and \ninefficient financing system leads to higher health system costs and hinders Mongolia\u2019s ability to \nrespond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several policy reforms are needed to significantly streamline \nfinancing arrangements in the health sector. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nGovernment initiatives and recent reforms. The government developed the Action Plan \nfor Implementation of the State Policy on Health, 2020\u20132026 (health sector master plan) with the \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n5   In Mongolia, the fiscal year coincides with the calendar year. \n6  ADB. 2015.

Investments have supported the government in critical health system \nreforms  to  (i)  shift  priorities  from  hospital-based  curative  services  to  more  efficient  and  cost-\neffective  primary  health  care;  (ii)  improve  health  financing  system  to  support  universal  health \ncoverage  and  increase  financial  protection  of  people;  (iii)  rationalize  the  hospital  sector  and \nprovide  more  autonomy  for  public  hospitals  to  increase  efficiency  and  quality  of  care;  and \n(iv) improve patients\u2019 safety through optimization of health services and provision of medicines. 8 \nWith  ADB\u2019s  policy  support,  the  government  has  developed  important  health  sector  policy \ndocuments and amended respective laws and regulations. The program will build on lessons and \nachievements from past ADB projects in the health sector, such as the need to strengthen primary \nhealth  care,  rationalize  hospital  services,  strengthen  policies  around  health \nfinancing \nmechanisms, and improve social health insurance, all of which are closely aligned with the State \nPolicy on Health, 2017\u20132026 and the ADB-supported health sector master plan (footnote 7). \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ADB\u2019s support to Mongolia regarding the \nCOVID-19 pandemic includes the following rapid response measures: reallocation of $1.4 million \nunder  an  existing  health  sector  operation  to  support  the  procurement  of  emergency  health \nequipment, a small-scale technical assistance (TA) project for emergency response systems, and \n$2.5  million  in  grant  support  from  the  Asia  Pacific  Disaster  Response  Facility  (including  $1.5 \nmillion  from  the  Government  of  Japan)  to  support  further  procurement  of  emergency  medical \nequipment. It also includes short- and medium-term responses, including a $30 million loan to \nsupport disease control in the health sector, a $26.4 million loan to strengthen social protection \nmeasures  for vulnerable groups, and TA resources to strengthen the capacity of the domestic \nviolence response in the country. ADB also repurposed $24 million under ADB\u2019s support to the \nCredit  Guarantee  Fund  to  directly  support  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  in  distress.  In \naddition,  $100  million  was  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  Comprehensive  Response  to  the  COVID-19 \nPandemic to support the government to manage the economic impact and respond to the health \nand social protection needs the pandemic has created. To facilitate the purchase of screening \nequipment  at  selected  border  crossing  points,  $75,000  was  reallocated  from  ADB\u2019s  Regional \n\n \n\n7  ADB supported the Government of Mongolia with institutional and human resource capacity to develop the health \nsector\u2019s strategic priorities until 2027, in accordance with Mongolia\u2019s commitments to achieve health-related targets \nunder  the  Mongolia  Sustainable  Development  Vision  2030.  (State  Great  Khural.  2016.  Mongolia  Sustainable \nDevelopment Vision 2030. Ulaanbaatar; and ADB. Mongolia: Development of the Health Sector Master Plan, 2019\u2013\n2027). \n\n8   ADB.

The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy  for  Mongolia,  2017\u20132020  and  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priority  1  (addressing \nremaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities),  with  the  aim  of  enhancing  human  capital  and \nachieving better health care for all. 11 The program is also aligned with Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities  2  (accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality)  and  6  (strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional  capacity),  and  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  2021  for \nMongolia. 12 \n \n15. \nDevelopment  partner  coordination. A joint health sector task force led by the United \nNations (UN) and MOH is coordinating the COVID-19 emergency response actions. Task force \nmembers  include  ADB,  European  Commission,  nongovernment  organizations,  specialized  UN \nagencies, and the World Bank. This task force also has the mandate to coordinate international \nassistance to the health sector. So far, most assistance has been provided by ADB and various \nbilateral agencies, with the Government of Japan providing testing equipment and UN agencies \nfinancing the purchase of protective equipment for the National Emergency Management Agency. \nThe World Bank approved a loan to support the purchase of medical equipment. 13 The program \ncomplements these efforts by focusing on immediate and medium-term governance and financing \nconstraints in the health sector, while at the same time responding to financing needs. \n \n16. \nImpact on women. Despite the largely successful control of the spread of COVID-19, the \nonset  of  the  pandemic  has  clearly  highlighted  Mongolia\u2019s  limited  capacity  to  immediately  and \neffectively respond to outbreaks of infectious diseases. It has also demonstrated that women are \nfacing  greater  hardship  because  of  the  increased  burden  of  unpaid  care  work  and  their \npredominant role in health care (82% of health care workers are women).  Moreover, the crisis \nhas exacerbated gender-based violence, as evidenced by the increase of hotline calls and women \nresorting  to  shelters.  The  reform  measures  under  this  program  will  address  health  system \ninefficiencies  with  an  explicit  focus  on  gender  aspects.  Finally,  gender-responsive  budgeting \n(GRB)  at  the  decentralized  hospital  level  will  complement  ongoing  work  in  this  area  being \nundertaken by the World Bank and the Canadian International Development Agency. \n\n \n\n9  ADB.

The programmatic approach consists of two subprograms, each with a \nsingle  tranche.  There  are  seven  policy  actions  in  each  subprogram  to  achieve  four  reform \nobjectives: (i) health sector preparedness and response to COVID-19 pandemic strengthened, \n(ii) governance  of  health  sector  operations  improved,  (iii) sustainability  and  efficiency  of  health \nsector resources improved, and (iv) medium-term fiscal stability enhanced. \n \n18. \nReform  area  1:  health  sector  preparedness  and  response  to  COVID-19  pandemic \nstrengthened. Reform area 1 focuses on strengthening planning capacity and preparedness of \nthe health sector, including the availability of critical medicines and emergency supplies. Policy \nactions under the subprograms are as follows: \n\nSubprogram  1.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  developed  an  integrated \nincident  management  system  that  consolidates  and  coordinates  across  multiple \nsystems  and  organizational  structures  during  health  emergencies.  The \ngovernment  also  updated  the  National  Disaster  Response  Plan  (NDRP)  for  the \nhealth sector and prepared a gender-specific needs analysis of the NDRP for the \nCOVID-19  pandemic  for  the  health  sector. 14 The  government  also  approved  a \nnational  plan  for  the  establishment  of  a  fully  functional  centralized  stockpile  of \nmedicines and emergency supplies in the event of future health emergencies. \nSubprogram  2.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  develop  an  inter-\nsectoral management information database that will facilitate data sharing during \ndisasters. This may include information such as (a) inter-sector data collection, (b) \nmapping of available resources, (c) stockpile data, and (d) capacity requirements. \nThe MOH will issue an implementation report on gender related activities carried \nout in connection with the NDRP. Under subprogram 2, the government will also \ndevelop and approve regulations to operationalize the stockpile. A fully functional \ncentralized  stockpile  will \ninstitutional \nassignments and responsibilities, and budgetary and staffing allocations. \n\nregulations  and  protocols, \n\nrequire \n\n \n19. \nReform  area  2:  governance  of  health  sector  operations  improved.  Reform  area  2 \naims to strengthen national pharmaceutical regulation and increase hospital autonomy and good \ngovernance. Policy actions under the subprograms are follows: \n\nSubprogram 1. Under subprogram 1, the government improved the governance \nand  efficiency  of  public  hospitals  and  the  pharmaceutical  sector.  Under  this \nsubprogram, the government ratified an amendment to the Medicines and Medical \nDevices  Law,  2010  that  enabled  the  establishment  of  a  single  pharmaceutical \nauthority.  The  government  has  also  piloted  increased  managerial  and  financial \nautonomy  in  three  public  hospitals,  including  the  introduction  of  performance-\nbased  contracting  of  services.  The  pilot  included  the  development  of  training \nmodules on gender analysis and GRB for the hospital management and finance \nstaff to help promote gender inclusive health care services in public hospitals. \nSubprogram  2.  Subprogram  2  will  establish  a  single  national  pharmaceutical \nregulatory authority, allocate sufficient budget, and approve the charter for this new \nauthority. It will also extend the hospital autonomy pilot to at least five additional \nhospitals. Capacity building sessions on the training modules for gender analysis \nand  GRB  developed  under  subprogram  1  will  be  held  in  at  least  five  public \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n14 This may also include disaggregated data by sex, geographic location, and age. \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nhospitals.  The  program  will  also  provide  implementation  support  to  hospitals  on \nGRB and prepare a report that will document progress. \n\n \n20. \nReform area 3: sustainability and efficiency of health sector resources improved. \nReform  area  3  aims  to  enhance  procurement  in  the  health  sector  to  increase  efficiency  and \nestablish  a  single  purchaser  for  health  services.  Policy  actions  under  the  subprograms  are  as \nfollows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSubprogram  1.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government  established  a  pooled \nprocurement arrangement, which reduced the cost of drugs and generated savings \nthrough  bulk  purchases.  To  improve  health  system  efficiency,  the  government \nexpanded an existing pilot on the pooled procurement of essential medicines and \nmedical devices by increasing the number of items procured under the framework \nagreement from 17 to 35. To help ensure the sustainability of the health system, \nthe  Parliament  of  Mongolia  amended  the  key  legislation  to  enable  the  Health \nInsurance Fund (HIF) to become a single purchaser of health services. To guide \nthe phased transfer of funds to the HIF, a gender- and age-differential baseline \nanalysis of health care service recipients was conducted. \nSubprogram  2.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  further  expand  the \npooled  procurement  of  essential  medicines  and  include  10%  of  budgeted \nmedicines under the prequalification framework agreement. The government has \nalso committed to the phased transfer of funds from the state budget to the HIF. In \ndoing so, the government shall integrate the results of gender- and age-differential \nanalysis of health care service recipients in the planning and budgeting related to \nthe phased transfer of funds. \n\n \n21. \nReform  area  4:  medium-term  fiscal  stability  enhanced.  Under  reform  area  4,  the \ngovernment has committed to safeguard fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Policy actions \nunder the subprograms are as follows: \n\nSubprogram 1. The government has approved a structural deficit of 5.1% in 2021, \nwhich returns Mongolia to a fiscally sustainable trajectory. This means Mongolia \nhas returned to its pre-COVID-19 fiscal trajectory with only a 1-year time lapse. \nSubprogram  2.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  further  decrease  the \nstructural deficit to 3.6% in 2022. This will be complemented by revisions to the \n\u201cRegulation  for  Planning,  Financing,  Monitoring,  and  Reporting  for  Public \nInvestment  Projects  and  Activities,\u201d  and  an  upgrade  of  the  public  investment \nmanagement information system. Both measures will cut the excessive red tape \nand realize significant efficiency gains in the execution of the capital budget. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n \nC. \n \nThe  main  development  objective  of  the  policy  reform  is  to  improve  health  outcomes  in \n22. \nMongolia through improvements in the quality and delivery of health services. 15 The policy actions \nunder subprogram 1 contributed to the overall objective to strengthen the government\u2019s immediate \ncapacity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subprogram 2 will introduce medium-term reforms \nthat  will  strengthen  key  health  systems  as  well  as  governance  and  financing  arrangements.  In \naddition,  Mongolia\u2019s  COVID-19  vaccine  deployment  plan  includes  ensuring  high  regulatory \nstandards for vaccine quality and comprehensive policies to support adequate governance and \npharmacovigilance  mechanisms,  both  of  which  are  areas  that  will  be  strengthened  through \npharmaceutical regulation under reform area 2. The implementation of reform area 2 is closely \n\n15 Government of Mongolia. 2016. State Policy on Health, 2017\u20132026.

The  main  economic  impact  of  the  program  is \nimproved health security mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19, avoiding future economic and \nsocial losses. A more sustainable, better coordinated, and more efficient health system will improve \naccess,  targeting,  and  gender  considerations  in  health.  Poor  and  vulnerable  communities  will \nbenefit, and poverty will be alleviated. Improved health outcomes and a more resilient population \nwill also induce greater private investment in the health sector and health insurance. 16 \n \nD. \n \n23. \nAccording  to  the  Fiscal  Stability  Law,  2010  the  government  must  finance  the  structural \ndeficit, which was 12.5% in 2020, resulting in financing needs of $1,701 million. The government \nwill fund this through domestic financing ($412 million), external borrowing ($1,077 million), and \nother financing ($211 million), including withdrawal from the Stabilization Fund. The government \nobtained  $263  million  in  project  financing  and  $815  million  in  policy-based  financing  to  meet \nexternal financing needs. In 2021, revenues are expected to increase by 22.4% and expenditures \nexpected to fall by 4.3%, leaving a financing need of 5.1% of the GDP. Subprogram 1 will make \nup 13.2% of the 2021 total financing gap. This will allow the government to maintain a stable level \nof domestic financing while gradually reducing the overall amount of external borrowing received \nin 2020, which was provided by ADB, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the European \nUnion, the Government of Japan, the IMF, and the World Bank.

The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \n\n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  the  straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 10.9 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \nSubprogram  2,  with  an  indicative  amount  of  $100  million,  will  also  come  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources.  \n \nE. \n \n25. \nThe MOF will serve as the executing agency and will establish a working group to oversee \nand coordinate the implementation of the program. The MOH will be the implementing agency. \nADB will assess implementation based on progress reports submitted by the MOF and will field \nmissions  to  confirm  the  fulfillment  of  policy  actions  for  subprograms  1  and  2.  ADB  and \ndevelopment partners will coordinate to prevent duplication of activities during implementation. \n \n26. \nSubprogram  1  will  be  disbursed  upon  loan  effectiveness  and  is  linked  to  the  full \ncompliance of the prior actions, as set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). The programmatic \napproach will be implemented over a period of 25 months. Subprogram 1 will be implemented \nfrom 1 May 2020 to 14 May 2021 and subprogram 2 will be implemented from 15 May 2021 to \n30 June  2022. 17 The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nindigenous  peoples,  and \n\nSafeguards.

The expected value of economic benefits of better \npreparedness and prevention would be at least $16.0 million per year, well above the estimated \ninvestment of $5.6 million needed per year for prevention and control. Further, potential efficiency \nsavings of $16.7 million per year will fully offset this needed investment. \n \n28. \ninvoluntary \nresettlement impacts under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) have been identified. The \nprogram will not have any differentiated impacts on ethnic groups, as none of the reforms will \ntarget specific ethnic groups. The program is categorized C for environment, indigenous peoples, \nand involuntary resettlement. \n \nSocial, poverty, and gender. Despite solid economic growth from 2017\u20132019, impacts \n29. \non poverty reduction have not kept pace and 28.4% of the population remain below the poverty \nline ($66.4 per month). Children remain among the most vulnerable (42.0% of poor people are \nchildren under the age of 15). Poverty concentration is growing in urban areas, with reductions in \nrural  areas  attributable  to  increased  demand  for  livestock  and  price  increases.  The  14.9%  of \npeople living just above the poverty line are highly vulnerable to shocks. The program will address \naffordability of medicines, which is a leading cause of OPE, especially for the poor. It will also \naddress  the  poor  quality  of  medicines,  since  32%  of  OPE  goes  to  drugs  that  are  often \nsubstandard. 18 In addition, the program will increase the financial and managerial independence \nof public hospitals, which will improve the quality of services provided and patient satisfaction. 19 \n\n17 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 World Bank.

Women are being affected \nby  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  multiple  ways. Quarantine  measures  and  school closures  have \nincreased unpaid household and care work, the bulk of which is traditionally carried out by women \n(para. 16). The program will initiate the preparation of a gender-specific analysis of the NDRP for \nthe health sector. The findings of this report will be adopted by the MOH and will shape disaster \nplanning in the health sector in the future. \n \nThe program will ensure that some of the most significant reforms in the health sector\u2014\n31. \nthe  decentralization  of  budget  and  managerial  authority  to  hospitals,  and  the  reform  of  health \nservice financing\u2014will have gender considerations at their core. The introduction of GRB at the \nhospital level offers an opportunity to broaden GRB across the public sector. This program will \nresult in the development of a training module on GRB, which will be used in hospitals that will \nget  increased  budget  authority.  This  offers  a  unique  opportunity  to  operationalize  GRB  in \nMongolia, and subprogram 2 will train hospital staff on GRB and monitor its implementation. \n \nGovernance.  Mongolia  has  strong  financial  management  legislation,  governance \n32. \nstructures,  and  public  financial  management  systems,  including  a  treasury  single  account,  a \nunified  chart  of  accounts,  and  an  integrated  government  debt  and  financial  management \ninformation system. There remain areas for improvement related to efficiency, effectiveness, and \ntransparency  of  public  financial  management. 20 To  address  these,  the  MOF  adopted  a  reform \nstrategy,  supported  by  ADB,  the  European  Union,  the  IMF,  and  the  World  Bank. 21 Over  the \nmedium  term,  ADB  will  continue  to  stay  engaged. 22  The  revised  Public  Procurement  Law, \nadopted  in  2013,  introduced  significant  changes  in  the  public  procurement  system,  with  local \ngovernments given more responsibility for procurement.
