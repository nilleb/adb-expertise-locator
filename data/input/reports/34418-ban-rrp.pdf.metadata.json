During  the  process,  the  Project  will  set  up  and \nstrengthen,  up-front  at  the  preconstruction  stage,  viable  water \nmanagement associations (WMAs), which will take on key roles in \nall  program  delivery  decisions  and  sustainable  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  of  local  water  infrastructure,  while  installing \ninstitutional  capacities  within  the  supporting  agencies  to  manage \nthe  overall  process,  including  O&M  of  main  water  infrastructure. \nThe Project will cover 100,000 hectares (ha) of FCD/I schemes in \nthe southwest areas and benefit about 0.8 million rural population, \nthe  majority  of  whom  are  poor.  The  project  process  and \nmanagement  will  demonstrate  the  way  to  substantially  enhance \nand  sustain  the  performance  of  existing  FCD/I  schemes  by \ndeveloping WMAs with representation from diverse stakeholders, \nparticularly  the  poor,  and  providing  them  with  agriculture  and \nfishery  support  services.  The  Project  will  also  support  ongoing \nsector-wide  institutional  reforms  toward  good  governance,  in \nharmony  with  other  sector  interventions  assisted  by  external \nfunding agencies.  \n \nWater \nin \nBangladesh,  with  the  country\u2019s  major  regional  river  systems \nbringing  about  massive  annual  floods,  severe  dry-season  water \nscarcity,  and  periodic  natural  disasters.  Effective  management  of \nwater is critical to address pervasive rural poverty problems. The \ntask is complicated due to fairly diverse and complex stakeholder \ninterests and vulnerable natural ecosystems. It is thus paramount \nto plan, develop, and manage water resources in a strategic and \nintegrated  manner  while  mobilizing  and  empowering  diverse \nstakeholders. While the country has established a large number of \n\nfundamentally  affects \n\nlivelihood  activities \n\nrural \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nFCD/I  infrastructures,  their  performance  remains  suboptimal  due \nto lack of effective management systems that can meet the needs \nof diverse stakeholders particularly the vulnerable poor, and most \ncritically,  provide  sufficient  O&M.  Within \nthe \nsouthwest  areas  face  the  most  acute  problems  due  to  reduced \ndry-season  inflow  and  associated  social  and  environmental \nhardships, e.g., salinity intrusion and annual monsoon flooding.   \n\nthe  country, \n\nIn  recent  years,  the  Government  has  progressively  improved  the \npolicy,  institutional,  and  planning  framework  for  the  water  sector \nwith  the  coordinated  support  of  external  financiers  including  the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  National  Water  Policy \n(NWP)  of  1999  adopted  key  principles  including  integrated  water \nresource  management  (IWRM),  and  sustainable  service  delivery \nand  O&M  with  progressive  transfer  of  facility  management  to \nWMAs.  Improvement  of  the  framework  is  followed  by  ongoing \ninstitutional reforms of sector agencies for better governance, and \nthe adoption of the National Water Management Plan (NWMP) in \n2004 that provides a sector strategy and priority programs with a \nlong-term  perspective.  The  key  challenge  now  is  to  transform \nthese initiatives into genuine sector operations.  \n\nWithin this framework, enhancing and sustaining the performance \nof existing FCD/I systems has been accorded high priority, given \nthe  need  to  strengthen  flood  resistance  and  the  scope  for \ngenerating  high  impacts  with  short  lead  time  at  relatively  low \ncosts. On this account, ADB has played a lead role in supporting \nthe initiative for small-scale schemes that are being implemented \nwith  increasingly  better  performance.  The  Project  is  needed  to \ndevelop and institutionalize effective mechanisms to be applied to \nlarger FCD/I schemes, building on the good practice and lessons \nlearned,  to  support  the  process  of  participatory  and  holistic \nplanning, inclusive WMA development, infrastructure and support \nservices to meet critical local development needs, and sustainable \nO&M.  Successful  implementation  of  the  Project  will  demonstrate \nthe  way  to  fully  operating  key  NWP  principles  in  FCD/I  systems, \nwith further improved governance of the sector institutions.   \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  overall  impact  will  be  enhanced  economic  growth \nand  reduced  poverty  in  the  concerned  FCD/I  areas,  while \nproviding  a  model  for  rejuvenating  poorly  performing  FCD/I \nsystems  that  can  be  replicated  throughout  the  country.  The \nProject  outcome  will  be  enhanced  and  sustained  productivity  of \nthe  selected  existing  FCD/I  systems  suffering \nlow \nperformance and high incidence of poverty.  The outcome will be \nachieved  by  (i)  providing  effective  program  delivery  mechanisms \nfor integrated planning, WMA formation and strengthening, water \nmanagement \nfor  developing \nagriculture  and  fishery  and  livelihood  enhancement  of  the  poor, \nand  sustainable  O&M;  and  (ii)  strengthening  institutions  for \neffective provision of services to achieve this end.  \n \n\ninfrastructure,  support  services \n\nfrom \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe estimated project cost is $43.4 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign  exchange  of  $9.7  million  and  local  currency  equivalent  of \n$33.7 million, including taxes and duties of $3.0 million equivalent. \n \n \n\n($ million)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange\n6.2 \n \n3.5 \n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n \n\n13.8 \n9.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n9.7 \n\n \n\n \n\n10.9 \n\n33.7 \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n20.0 \n12.5 \n\n10.9 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nPercent \n\n46 \n29 \n\n25 \n\n43.4 \n\n100 \n\nSource \n\nADB \nGovernment of \nthe Netherlands \nGovernment \nof Bangladesh \n   Total \nSource: ADB estimates.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The equivalent in various currencies of SDR 13,863,000 from the \nSpecial  Funds  resources  of  ADB.

A project management office is established \nin  the  Faridpur  zonal  office  of  BWDB  to  manage  overall  project \nimplementation,  while  day-to-day  implementation  is  done  in \nsubproject  management  offices.  A  joint  management  committee \n(JMC)  will  be  established  in  each  subproject  with  representation \nfrom  WMAs,  local  government  institutions,  and  line  departments \nto  decide  on  subproject  implementation  matters.

To  support \nsustainable O&M, the Project will (i) adopt the procedure that has \nproved  effective \nin  small-scale  FCD/I  schemes  with  ADB \nassistance,  as  regards  the  transferred  facilities  managed  by \nWMAs;  and  (ii)  as  to  the  remaining  facilities,  strengthen  central \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nless  will  be  procured \n\nfunding  and  its  management  systems  including  expenditure \nrationalization,  improved  management  information  systems  for \nscheme  performance  monitoring  and  O&M  planning,  and \nperformance-based  priority  allocation  of  O&M  budgets \nfor \nschemes where NWP arrangements are operating satisfactorily.  \n \nAll procurement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  Major  contracts  for  vehicles,  equipment,  and \nthrough \nmaterials  exceeding  $1.0  million  will  be  procured \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  whereas  packages  valued  at \n$1.0  million  equivalent  or \nfollowing \ninternational  shopping  procedures.  Civil  works  under  the  Project \nwill  be  up  to  $2.0  million,  and  will  be  contracted  through  local \ncompetitive bidding (LCB).  \n \nFor  institutional  strengthening  and  project  management,  the \nProject will provide consulting services of 604 person-months: 72 \ninternational  and  532  domestic.  The  consultants  will  be  selected \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory \nfor  engaging  domestic \nto  ADB \nconsultants  to  assist  BWDB  and  other  agencies  in  identifying, \nplanning,  developing,  and  managing  water  from  integrated  and \ncross-sectoral  perspectives  while  establishing  viable  WMAs  and \nJMCs. In consideration of the nonengineering complexity and the \nneed  for  timely  fielding,  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  to \nselect  the  consultants  on  its  behalf.  In  addition,  the  Government \nwill engage technically qualified private providers including NGOs \nto  support  planning,  beneficiary  mobilization,  implementation, \nresettlement,  support  service  delivery,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  \n \n \nThe Project will improve the livelihood of about 0.8 million people \nby  rehabilitating  and  improving  100,000  ha  of  underperforming \nFCD/I  schemes.  The  main  benefits  are  increased  agriculture \nproduction\u2013brought  about  by  improved  flood  protection,  local \nretention  and  storage  of  water  for  irrigation,  and  improved \ndrainage to enable expansion of diversified crop cultivation\u2013along \nwith  increased  fishery  production,  improved  flood  security  of \nsettlements,  increased  labor  opportunities,  better  nutrition,  and \nincreased  incomes  and  reduced  poverty.  The  economic  internal \nrates  of  return  of  two  sample  subprojects  are  16.5%  and  21.2%. \nAt  the  regional  level,  the  Project  will  improve  service  delivery \nmechanisms \nto  attain  maximum  benefits  and  sustainability \nthrough  FCD/I  renovation  with  sound  quality  control,  along  with \nimproved sector governance with policy and institutional actions. \n \nSome 55% of the population in the two subproject areas fall below \nthe  poverty  line,  higher  than  the  national  average.  Its  social \ndevelopment strategy will focus on enhancing the participation of \nthe  poor  in  water  management  activities,  delivery  of  targeted \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nimplementation  and  sustainability: \n\nsupport to the most vulnerable poor, enhancing the role of women \nin  project  institutions  and  WMAs,  and  institutional  reforms  for \nmore effective operation of gender development within BWDB.   \n \nThe  Project  has  certain  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  its \neffective \n(i)  stakeholder \nparticipation, (ii) sustainability including delivery of quality outputs \nand sustainable O&M, and (iii) BWDB management capacity. The \nProject  has  incorporated  mitigating  measures  to  address  these \nrisks.  Beneficiary  participation  is  pursued  by  ensuring  up-front \nWMA  strengthening  to  achieve  measurable  targets  at  the  pre-\nconstruction  stage.  Governance-related  sustainability  risks  are \nmitigated  by  strengthening  management,  monitoring,  and  quality \ncontrol  systems  of  the  concerned  institutions.

following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Southwest  Area  Integrated  Water \nResources  Planning  and  Management  Project,  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  of  a  grant  for  the  Project,  provided  by  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nAgriculture  and  Rural  Sectors.  Despite  good  progress  in  recent  years,  Bangladesh \n2. \nremains  one  of  the  poorest  countries  in  the  world  with  an  annual  per  capita  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) of $389 (in 2003) and poverty incidence of 50% (in 2000). Over 85% of the poor \nlive  in  rural  areas  and  most  are  engaged  in  agriculture  and  related  nonfarm  activities. \nAccordingly, accelerating agricultural and rural growth is key to reducing poverty in the country.  \n\n3. \nWhile  the  share  of  agriculture  in  the  country\u2019s  GDP  has  declined  to  23%,  the  rural \nincluding  the  nonfarm  sector  accounts  for  over  60%  of  GDP  and  76%  of  employment. \nAgriculture showed a relatively strong growth with an average growth of 2.9% per annum with \nstructural  changes  since  1990.  The  rural  nonfarm  subsector  (such  as  input  marketing, \nmechanical  services,  agroprocessing,  and  trading)  grew  more  rapidly.  Agriculture  growth  was \nmainly  due  to  the  increased  production  of  food  crops  led  by  paddy  and  potato  (for  which  per \ncapita production increased by 10 kilograms [kg] since 1990), culture fishery (4% increase per \ncapita per annum since 1990), and to a lesser extent livestock and vegetables.2 As a result, the \ncountry  has  achieved  near  self-sufficiency  in  paddy.  However,  the  growth  rate  slowed  down \nrecently, averaging 2% during 2000-04. Most crops suffer from substantial gaps between farm \nyields  and  demonstration  plot  yields.  The  present  farm  yields  for  paddy  stand  at  3.4  tons  per \nhectare (t/ha), marginally above subsistence levels. The country also remains a net importer of \ncereals and most other crops. The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) has \naccorded  high  priority  to  rural  development,  with  strategic  emphasis  on  (i)  intensifying  cereal \ncrops and diversifying to high-value crops while promoting fisheries and livestock, (ii) providing \nrural infrastructure to reduce natural and other shocks, and (iii) promoting nonfarm activities.  \n \n4. \nWater Resources. The country is located at the confluence of three major regional river \nsystems  that  pose  significant  physical  challenges  including  massive  monsoon  floods  and \ndrainage congestion (inundating 30% of the country\u2019s land area on average), riverbank erosion, \nserious  dry-season  water  scarcity,  natural  disasters  such  as  cyclones,  and  widespread \ngroundwater arsenic (affecting 30\u201350% of the population). Access to and effective management \nof  water  are  critical  for  the  rural  poor,  as  water  fundamentally  affects  their  productive  and \nlivelihood  activities.  Water  management  is  further  complicated  by  diverse  and  complex \nstakeholder  interests,  widely  varying  in  different  topographic  locations  among  agriculture, \ncapture  and  culture  fisheries,  boat  transport,  rural  industries,  drinking  water,  and  associated \nnonfarm  activities.  Water  is  also  vital  for  the  country\u2019s  rich  natural  ecosystems.  Thus,  it  is \nparamount \nintegrated,  participatory,  and \ndecentralized approach with due attention to the interests of the vulnerable poor.  \n\nthis  critical  resource \n\nthrough  an \n\nto  manage \n\n                                                 \n1   Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  was  provided  under  ADB.  2002.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s \n\nRepublic of Bangladesh for the Southwest Area Integrated Water Resources Management Project. Manila.  \n\n2  Sector  composition  for  crops  (including  horticulture),  fisheries,  livestock,  and  forestry  changed  from  65%,  15%, \n\n13%, and 7%, respectively, in 1990 to 58%, 22%, 12%, and 8%, respectively, in 2003. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nSubstantial  efforts  have  been  made  since  the  1950s  to  manage  water  resources  with \n5. \nlarge public investments, culminating in 9,500-kilometer (km) embankments, 11,500 km canals, \n60  km  revetments,  and  over  13,300  hydraulic  structures.  While  these  structures  provide \nessential  flood  protection  and  drainage  functions  for  5.4  million  ha  (covering  30%  of  the  net \ncultivated  area),  their  performance  remains  suboptimal,  with  chronic  facility  deterioration \nproblems and underachieved potentials. On the other hand, the irrigated area expanded rapidly \nfrom 1.6 million ha in 1980 to 4.4 million ha in 2001, thanks to expansion of private groundwater \nirrigation,  the  main  driving  force  for  paddy  production  growth.3 Yet  the  cost  of  groundwater \nirrigation is rising as more water is extracted, posing a constraint on further expansion.  \n \n6. \nSouthwest Area. The southwest area of 4 million ha (27% of the country\u2019s total) covers \nthe  south  bank  of  the  Ganges  and  the  Lower  Meghna  rivers,  with  a  population  of  28.6  million \n(23% of the total). The region produces 21% of the national GDP. With its sectoral share of 36%, \nagriculture  plays  a  dominant  role,  yet  its  productivity  is  lagging  behind  the  national  average. \nPaddy yields remain at 3.1 t/ha due mainly to the dominance of traditional varieties associated \nwith the area\u2019s susceptibility to flooding, and slower expansion of irrigation (38% as opposed to \nthe national average of 55% of net cultivated area). About 51% of the area\u2019s population is poor, \nsecond  to  the  highest\u2013the  northwest\u2013among  the  country\u2019s  four  main  regions.  As  to  water \nresources, the southwest has 78 flood control, drainage/irrigation (FCD/I) systems4 covering 1.1 \nmillion  ha.  It  has  the  most  acute  water  management  problems  in  Bangladesh.  Of  particular \nconcern  is  water  shortage  due  to  reduced  inflow  into  the  Ganges  tributaries  and  associated \nsocial  and  environmental  hardships, \nloss,  and \nenvironmental degradation. Other challenges include (i) the flood inflow from the Ganges in the \nmonsoon  and  deterioration  of  existing  FCD/I  systems,  (ii)  drainage  congestion  and \nsedimentation of tidal channels caused by coastal polder construction and reduced tidal swept \nvolume, (iii) arsenic contamination (highest in the country), and (iv) vulnerability to cyclones and \ntidal surges. Improving water management is critically needed in this region of the country.   \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nincluding  salinity \n\nlivelihood \n\nintrusion, \n\n7. \nAgriculture  and  Fishery.  The  Government  initiated  market-oriented  sector  reforms  in \nthe early 1980s, deregulating input and output marketing and improving the delivery of support \nservices.  While  the  reforms  led  to  dynamic  response  in  some  areas  such  as  groundwater \nirrigation  and  fertilizer  use,  performance  results  in  other  areas  are  mixed.  The  supply  of \nimproved seeds remains a major constraint, with meager private sector participation, particularly \nfor food grains that meet only 25% of the annual replacement needs. Fertilizer use increased by \n35% from 1993 to 2003, but is poorly balanced and falls significantly below the recommended \ndosage. As a result, 60% of net cultivated areas now suffer from low soil fertility with depletion \nof soil organic matter and micronutrients. For culture fisheries, the supply of fingerlings remains \na constraint, along with the restricted access of the poor to water bodies. In output marketing, \nprivate  agribusiness  such  as  contract  farming  of  cereals  and  cash  crops  is  emerging.  Yet  the \nmarketing  chain  is  fragmented  with  information  dissymmetry  and  lack  of  infrastructure.  As  to \nextension, while public agency staffs have technical know-how, field extension is constrained by \nlack of resources and weak farmer participation, calling for collaboration with private providers. \nThese conditions call for careful planning and strategic provision of critical support services, and \nconcerted efforts to facilitate the delivery of key inputs, considering marketing opportunities.  \n\n                                                 \n3  Paddy production in spring (aus), monsoon (aman), and winter (boro) changed from 2.7, 7.8, and 2.4 million tons, \n\nrespectively, in 1980, to 1.8, 10.7, and 11.8 million tons, respectively, in 2002.  \n\n4   An FCD/I scheme is a system of  water management infrastructure generally comprising flood  embankments and \nnetworks  of  internal  drainage/irrigation  canals  that  serve  mostly  for  drainage  purposes  but  also  can  be  used  for \nirrigation, in particular in the tidal impact areas in the southwest and southeast regions.  \n\n\fWater  Resources  \u2013  Past  Efforts.  Following the devastating floods in 1987 and 1988, \n8. \nmajor international coordinated efforts were provided in the 1990s under the Flood Action Plan \n(FAP)  to  systematically  address  the  water  management  problems.  A  total  of  26  regional  and \nthematic studies were assisted by 16 external funding agencies including ADB, which supported \nregional  studies  for  the  southwest  and  for  flood  protection  in  Dhaka.  While  the  studies \nestablished  a  substantial  knowledge  base,  they  also  revealed  deficiencies  of  the  past \ninterventions\u2013which  had  generally  mixed  performance\u2013including  those  assisted  by  ADB. \nSpecifically,  previous  planning  efforts  tended  to  focus  on  constructing  major  single-purpose \nflood  protection  structures,  and  overlooked  diverse  stakeholder  needs  and  multidimensional \nimplications of water management. Top-down implementation led to negative environmental and \nsocial impacts (such as reduced capture fishery causing hardship to the poorest), and left many \nlocal  water  management  problems  unaddressed  or  opportunities  unutilized.  Most  critically, \noperations and maintenance (O&M) was inadequate and underresourced, with little beneficiary \nparticipation  and  support,  leading  to  facility  deterioration,  frequent  flood  damage,  and \nsubsequent  rehabilitation  needs.  Major  reforms  in  the  policy  and  institutional  framework  and \ncapacities of sector agencies became necessary to effectively meet the sector challenges.  \n\n9. \nRecent Sector Reforms and Challenges. Following the FAP findings, the Government \ninitiated comprehensive policy and institutional reforms for the sector. The National Water Policy \n(NWP), adopted in 1999, set out due policy goals and principles for participatory and integrated \nwater  resources  management  (IWRM),  strategic  planning,  sustainable  O&M  with  progressive \nmanagement transfer to water management associations (WMAs), and improved governance of \nsector  organizations.  Along  this  line,  institutional  reforms  of  a  key  sector  agency,  Bangladesh \nWater  Development  Board  (BWDB),  were  initiated,  including  (i)  reformulation  of  its  Board  to \ninclude stakeholder representatives and sector experts, (ii) long-term assignment of leadership, \nand  (iii)  significant  staff  rationalization  (by  over  50%)  with  skills  mix  diversification  and  a  self-\ndeveloped  draft  vision  now  envisaging  transformation  from  a  top-down  implementer  to  a \nservice-oriented  agency.  Guidelines  for  participatory  water  management  (GPWM)  were  also \nfinalized  by  stipulating  procedures  and  arrangements  to  implement  sector  interventions  with \nWMA empowerment. The National Water Management Plan (NWMP) was also finalized in 2004, \nwith its short-term programs emphasizing an enabling environment and institutional capacities.  \n\nHowever,  the  reforms  are  still  at  the  early  stage  of  consolidation,  calling  for  careful \n10. \nsupport to transform the initiatives into sound sector operations. In this context, a large number \nof  existing  FCD/I  schemes  are  yet  to  be  placed  under  the  new  and  improved  management \narrangements.  In  the  meantime,  the  country  also  experienced  huge  damage  from  floods  in \n1998, 2000, and 2004,5 all of which led to large-scale external emergency assistance including \nloans  from  ADB.  While  these  recurrent  losses  demonstrated  the  need  for  establishing  more \nflood-resistant infrastructure with better hazard risk management, equally critical are institutions \nfor sound regular maintenance, since poorly maintained facilities are more vulnerable to floods \nand cause larger damage once they fail. Moreover, many FCD/I systems have large unachieved \nbenefits,  and  their  improvement  would  provide  larger  returns  with  a  short  lead  time  and  less \nsignificant  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts.  Thus,  enhancing  and  sustaining  the \nperformance  of  existing  FCD/I  infrastructure  with  improved  O&M  remains  a  critical  and  urgent \nneed, and is accorded high priority in the NWMP. The sector analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n\n11. \nExternal  Assistance  and  Coordination.  In  response  to  the  NWP  and  the  NWMP, \nexternal funding agencies are renewing support to the sector with a harmonized approach. Key \npartners  include  the  World  Bank,  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  Canadian  International \nDevelopment Agency (CIDA), and ADB. For rural areas, the World Bank is appraising the Water \n                                                 \n5   The most recent 2004 floods have caused a total damages estimated at $2.2 billion nationwide. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nManagement  Improvement  Project  (WMIP)  with  the  Netherlands  cofinancing  to  assist  in \nrehabilitating  380,000  ha  of  medium-sized  and  large  FCD/I  schemes  with  a  sector  project \nmodality.6 The Netherlands Government is providing twinning missions (TMs) to support BWDB \nto  prepare  and  implement  comprehensive  action  plans  to  embed  reforms  into  day-to-day \noperations,  while  supporting  investments  including  integrated  planning  and  rehabilitation  of \nmedium-scale  FCD/I  schemes  and  estuary  development.  CIDA  is  assisting  in  improving \nBWDB\u2019s financial management systems. ADB is supporting improvement of small-scale FCD/I \nsystems through the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) with the Netherlands \ncofinancing,7 and  riverbank  protection  along  two  large  FCD/I  systems,8 where  developing  the \nirrigation command area was also assisted through a separate project (Appendix 3).   \n\nIts \n\nthe  amended  Cooperatives  Act. \n\n12. \nADB  Contributions,  Lessons,  and  Strategy.  ADB  played  an  important  role  in \npromoting  the  aforementioned  reforms.  Its  assistance  to  small  FCD/I  set  up  a  framework  for \ntransfer of management to WMAs that was embodied in NWP, while establishing a WMA legal \nframework  with \nimplementation  procedures  and \narrangements,  improved  over  time  with  an  increasing  number  of  well-performing  WMAs,  were \nadopted as the Government\u2019s GPWM, now to be applied in all sector interventions. Other loans \nalso  contributed  to  the  progress  of  institutional  reforms.9 Although  operationalizing  NWP  with \nsound  O&M  still  remains  a  future  goal,  useful  lessons  were  learned.  First  is  the  need  for \nintegrated  planning,  development,  and  management  of  water  to  address  diverse  needs  and \nconcerns;  and  for  providing  sufficient  services  to  address  other  local  production  constraints. \nSecond, sufficient time, resources, and management are critical for WMA formation, with clear \nmeasurable targets that should be achieved prior to physical works. O&M requirements should \nbe  agreed  upon  at  this  stage,  with  up-front  cash  contribution  and  field  training.  Third,  quality \ncontrol  in  infrastructure  and  other  program  delivery  and  system  operation  requires  rigorous \nattention, with particular care to protecting poor people\u2019s interests. Fourth, well-managed local \ninfrastructure  provides  a  basis  for  WMAs  to  start  addressing  social  agendas  for  the  poor,  and \ntaking on lead roles for a local development process as a collective enterprise (Appendix 4). \n\n13. \nADB\u2019s new country strategy and program (CSP) for Bangladesh was prepared in 2005 \nfollowing the Government\u2019s PRSP. Given the high incidence of rural poverty, the CSP prioritizes \ninvestments in agriculture commercialization, rural infrastructure, and rural water management. \nThe  strategy  for  the  water  sector  is  to  institutionalize  integrated  planning,  development,  and \nmanagement with sustained O&M, while providing support for critical infrastructure where high \ngrowth and poverty impacts are expected. The programs build on good practices and lessons, \nand promote further improved institutional framework in harmony with development partners. All \nare consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy.  \n\n14. \nSector  Opportunities  and  Policy  Dialogues.  The  proposed  Project  was  prepared \nthrough a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA, footnote 1) to institutionalize the said \nmanagement process for medium-sized and large FCD/I schemes in the selected hydrological \nsub-regions  in  the  southwest.  The  Project  will  operationalize  the  GPWM.  The  PPTA  prepared \nparticipatory integrated water management plans (IWMPs) for two large FCD/I schemes, which \nidentified  diverse  water-related  interests  and  cross-sectoral  development  constraints,  and  laid \n\n                                                 \n6  Small, medium-sized, and large schemes are defined as those having command area of up to 1,000 ha, between \n\n1,000 and 5,000 ha, and over 5,000 ha, respectively.  \n\n7   ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second \n\nSmall-scale Water Resources Development Sector Project. Manila (approved in July 2001). \n\n8   ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Jamuna-\n\nMeghna River Erosion Mitigation Project. Manila (approved in November 2003). \n\n9  For example, an irrigation service fee was introduced following BWDB Act 2000 allowing project offices to collect, \nretain, and use irrigation fees, compared with the earlier system of collecting water tax as government revenue.  \n\n\fout holistic measures to enhance and sustain their performance.10 The feasibility project design \nincorporated  the  aforementioned  lessons,  with  provisions  for  setting  out  clear  development \ntargets; sufficient up-front WMA strengthening; WMA-driven program delivery with due support \nfor agriculture, fishery, and livelihood activities; mechanisms to protect and address the interests \nof  the  poor;  intensive  strengthening  of  WMAs\u2019  O&M  capacity;  and  improved  internal  and \nexternal  quality  control,  with  use  of  outsourcing  to  private  providers  including  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs).  \n \nIn  addition,  policy  dialogues  were  undertaken  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  sector \n15. \noperations in support of the Project, in harmony with other externally funded programs. First, the \nGovernment  developed  comprehensive  action  plans  to  operationalize  NWP  for  improved \nperformance  of  the  sector  agencies,  including  BWDB  and  Water  Resources  Planning \nOrganization  (WARPO),  through  better  governance,  in  particular  with  TM  support.11 Second, \ngeneric  measures  to  enhance  O&M  were  agreed  upon  and  substantially  advanced:  (i) \nrationalizing  recurrent  expenditure,  (ii)  introducing  sound  O&M  performance  monitoring  and \nplanning at the scheme level, (iii) improving management with performance-based scheme-wise \nbudget  allocation,  and  (iv)  progressively  enhancing  the  O&M  budget  allocated  for  BWDB.  In \naddition,  O&M  responsibilities  of  medium-sized  and  large  FCD/I  systems  were  clarified, \nincluding  joint  management  of  main  facilities  and  management  transfer  to  WMAs  for \nsubordinate facilities. Third, the Government agreed to lease public water bodies in the project \ncommand  areas  directly  to  the  concerned  WMAs  to  enable  WMAs  to  provide  fish  culture \nopportunities  to  their  poorest  members  while  generating  WMA  incomes. 12  Fourth,  the \nGovernment  agreed  to  initiate  steps  to  introduce  external  technical  auditing  for  water \nmanagement  infrastructure  works,  by  piloting  it  under  the  Project  through  the  office  of  the \nComptroller and Auditor General (CAG) and holding further dialogues toward their introduction. \nThe policy and institutional actions matrix is in Appendix 5.  \n  \n16. \nAgainst this backdrop, the Project is needed to demonstrate and institutionalize the way \nto enhance and sustain the performance of medium-sized and large FCD/I schemes, a critical \nand prioritized NWMP agenda, building on the agreed-upon policy dialogue actions and lessons \nto  be  applied.  These  provide  a  sound  basis  for  achieving  substantially  enhanced  productivity \nand  sustainability  in  comparison  with  prereform  interventions.  The  Project  envisages  covering \n100,000 ha of FCD/I areas, including 57,000 ha where IWMPs were prepared under the PPTA. \nA process-type approach to the rest of the area is justified on the basis of the improved policy \nand  planning  framework  as  reflected  in  the  NWP  and  NWMP,  and  development  of  sector \nagency capacities that is ongoing through the progressive reforms being put into operation with \nthe harmonized support of  externally assisted programs, including the Project.  \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n17. \nThe impact of the Project will be reduced poverty incidence measured in incomes of the \npopulation  and  food  availability,  and  institutionalization  of  effective  mechanisms  for  enhancing \nand sustaining the performance of FCD/I systems, applicable and replicated in other areas. Its \n                                                 \n10  Chenchuri  Beel  and  Narail  schemes.  They  were  identified  and  assessed  during  the  ADB-assisted  FAP  regional \nstudy and follow-on TA loan (Appendix 3) along with a number of other schemes, and upgraded under the PPTA \nwith IWMPs and renewed institutional designs. A synthesis of IWMPs is included in Appendix 8.  \n\n11  The action plans are set up as a common set of actions pursued in externally funded programs to operationalize \nNWP.  For  BWDB,  they  cover  institutional  development  strategy,  improving  personnel  and  financial  management, \ndecentralizing functions, and improving internal work procedures including monitoring and quality control.   \n\n12 The Government policy is to lease out public water bodies for exploitation through a bidding process.   \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\noutcome will be enhanced productivity and sustainability of the selected existing FCD/I systems \nsuffering from low performance and high incidence of poverty in the selected subregion of the \nsouthwest. 13 This  will  be  measured  from  (i)  economic  indicators  e.g.,  increased  production, \nincomes,  and  employment  in  the  subproject  areas;  and  (ii)  institutional  indicators  associated \nwith  sustainable  O&M  (e.g.,  sound  WMA  and  joint  management  institution  establishment,  and \nadequate  O&M  programming  and  implementation),  and  improved  agency  performance  in \nservice  delivery  (Appendix  1).  The  Project  will  cover  a  geographic  area  of  about  100,000  ha \nhaving some 0.8 million population.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n18. \nThe  Project  outputs  are  (i)  participatory  IWMPs  for  the  selected  FCD/I  schemes,  (ii) \nproductive and sustainable water management systems set up through IWMP implementation in \nthe project area,  and (iii) strengthened capacities of institutions delivering programs.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Participatory IWMPs \n\n19. \nFollowing the sample IWMPs prepared under the PPTA, the Project will prepare IWMPs \nfor  additional  FCD/I  schemes  covering  about  43,000  ha,  to  be  selected  following  the  set \nselection  criteria.  The  IWMPs  will  lay  out  holistic  programs  for  enhancing  and  sustaining  the \nperformance  of  the  FCD/I  schemes,  following  intensive  participatory  analyses  of  diverse  local \nwater management problems and development constraints, and assessments of feasibility and \nsafeguards.  The  process  is  managed  by  BWDB  and  WARPO  (for  technical  backstopping)  in \ncollaboration  with  LGED  and  other  line  departments,  under  the  guidance  of  the  council  of  the \nconcerned  village  union  chairpersons  and  the  support  of  the  consultants  for  institutional \nstrengthening and project management support (ISPMS).  The IWMPs will be endorsed by the \nsaid council before they are finalized, and will be regularly reviewed and updated.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Productive and Sustainable Water Management Systems  \n\n20. \nThis  component  will  establish  improved  water  management  systems  for  each  FCD/I \nscheme  through  IWMP  implementation.  For  effective  implementation  and  management,  the \nscheme area is divided into hydrologic subunits (command areas) controlled by individual local \nstructures. 14  They  will  be  implemented  individually  through  process-based  subcomponents \ncomprising  (i)  preparation  of  a  subunit  implementation  plan  (SIP)  and  mobilization  of  WMA \nbeneficiaries;  (ii)  water  management  and  associated  infrastructure;  (iii)  support  services  for \nagriculture, fishery and livelihood enhancement; and (iv) monitoring and support for sustainable \nO&M. In implementing individual subunits, each subcomponent will have distinct output targets, \nwhich  are  set  as  benchmarks  for  starting  the  activities  for  the  succeeding  subcomponent. \nSubunits  with  better  performance  in  initial  processes  will  be  implemented  on  a  priority  basis, \nalong with those that need urgent implementation such as embankments in critical sections.  \n \n\na. \n\nSIP Prepared and WMA Formed with Beneficiary Mobilization \n\nSIP  Preparation.  A WMA for each subunit and subordinate water management groups \n21. \n(WMGs)  corresponding  to  individual  facilities  within  the  subunit  will  be  formed  following  the \ncooperatives  legal  framework.  At  the  outset,  the  Project  will  support  the  formation  of  ad  hoc \nWMA  and  WMGs  within  the  subunit,  and  prepare  an  SIP  through  private  firms  by  setting  out \n                                                 \n13  Located in six districts: Faridpur, Gopalganj, Jessore, Magura, Narail, and Rajbari.  \n14  The two sample schemes comprise five independent subschemes covering 5,000\u201313,000 ha benefit areas, within \n\nwhich are 14 semi-independent compartments and about 50 subunits.  \n\n\fspecific  impact  targets  and  associated  programs  including  inputs  and  delivery  schedules.  The \nSIP  will  also  reconfirm  subunit  economic  feasibility,  include  resettlement  and  environmental \nmanagement plans following the IWMP safeguards outputs, and be endorsed by the WMA.  \n \n22.  WMA  Formation  and  Strengthening. The Project will establish empowered WMAs to \nmanage activities at preconstruction, construction, and postconstruction stages. The goal is to \nhave  WMAs  play  effective  organizational,  operational,  resource  mobilization,  and  networking \nfunctions for productive water management with sustainable O&M. After the SIP is finalized, the \nProject  will  support  the  WMA  to  implement  the  institutional  development  plan  specified  in  the \nSIP,  including  (i)  enrolling  members  and  mobilizing  functional  subgroups;  (ii)  registering,  with \nthe  formation  of  executive  committees  and  operational  rules;  and  (iii)  collecting  cash \ncontribution  equivalent  to  annual  O&M  requirement  for  the  concerned  facilities  transferred  to \nWMAs, and establishing that contribution as an O&M reserve fund. The Project will facilitate the \nprocess  by  recruiting  and  fielding  community-based  organizers  (CBOs)  locally  that  will  be \ntrained by private providers including NGOs with the support of the ISPMS consultants.  \n \nImplementation Agreement. During the above process, participatory detailed design of \n23. \nwater management structures will be undertaken, along with the refinement and implementation \nof  the  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  included  in  the  SIP.  After  the  WMA  achieves  its  institutional \ndevelopment \nimplementation,  an \nimplementation  agreement  will  be  signed  by  representatives  of  the  Government,  WMA,  and \nlocal government institutions (LGIs), as a benchmark to start civil works procurement.  \n\nthe  detailed  design  with  RP \n\ntargets  and  endorses \n\nb. \n\nWater Management and Associated Infrastructure \n\n24. \nThis  subcomponent  will  deliver  water  management  infrastructure  specified  in  the  SIP, \nincluding  flood  embankments  (resectioning,  improvement,  and  retirement),  regulators,  sluice \ngates  and  pipes,  water  retention  structures,  reexcavated  drainage/irrigation  canals,  and  local \nriverbank protection (using lower cost sand-filled geotextile bags). The WMA will be trained to \nmonitor  civil  works.  Internal  technical  audit  will  be  strengthened,  with  a  pilot  introduction  of \nexternal technical audit to support construction quality control.      \n\nc. \n\nEnhanced Production and Livelihood through Support Services  \n\n25. \nUpon  completion  of  infrastructure  works,  this  subcomponent  will  develop  beneficiary \nskills  for  enhanced  productivity  and  incomes,  and  WMA  capacities  to  support  this  end.  Its \nprogram  inputs  are  specified  in  the  SIP  and  monitored  by  WMA.  Outputs  are  also  monitored \nagainst the SIP targets for land use, production, and incomes at each subunit level.  \n \n26. \nAgriculture  and  Fishery  Development.  The  Project  will  provide  extension  services \nthrough local offices of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), Department of Fisheries \n(DOF),  and  private  service  providers  including  NGOs,  to  promote  adoption  of  improved \npractices  made  possible  by  the  water  infrastructure.  Services  for  agriculture  will  include  (i)  a \ncampaign for improved soil nutrient management, (ii) field demonstration and training through a \nfarmer field school approach for crop intensification and diversification, and (iii) workshops and \nfarmer tours. As part of the field demonstration, the Project will also support  seed multiplication \nby delivering foundation seeds and technical support, along with integrated pest management. \nWMAs  will  sustain  activities  through  training  of  in-house  extension  workers  within  the  WMA. \nServices for fishery development will focus on beels,15 khals (natural channels), and other open \n                                                 \n15 A beel is a water body that accumulates surface runoff water through internal drainage canals. It may dry up during \n\nthe winter but expands into a large water body during the rainy season. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nand semi-open water bodies, management of which is improved by water infrastructure. For this \npurpose, a WMA fishery subgroup will be formed with priority membership to the poor who have \nlost access to floodplain fisheries, and will be provided with culture fishery opportunities such as \nthose created in khals behind water retention structures. The relevant public water bodies within \nthe subproject boundaries will be leased out to the concerned WMAs.16  \n \n27. \nLivelihood  Enhancement.  The  Project  will  support  income-generating  activities \nundertaken  on  public  lands  relevant  to  the  project  infrastructure  (e.g.,  canal  and  embankment \nslopes)  by  the  poorest  subgroups  formed  in  the  WMA,  along  with  other  priority  livelihood \ninitiatives. Specific activities promoted will include social forestry, nurseries, crop cultivation, and \nlivestock.  Training  will  be  provided  through  the  concerned  line  departments  and  private \nproviders mobilized under the Project. In return for project benefits, the beneficiaries will carry \nout necessary routine maintenance activities for the concerned facilities.17  \n\nd. \n\nSustainable O&M System \n\n28.  WMA-Managed Facilities. The project facilities will be classified into those managed by \nWMAs (having a command area of up to 2,500 ha in principle) and others jointly managed by \nBWDB, LGIs, and WMAs. For the former, the Project will establish WMA capacities to manage \nsustainable O&M, and will support formation of WMA O&M committees and preparation of O&M \nplans during the design stage, and will train them to monitor construction. After civil works are \ncompleted,  the  Project  will  provide  on-the-job  training  for  a  full  year  in  undertaking  (i)  annual \ninspection through a joint walk-through with BWDB, (ii) preparation of the annual O&M plan, and \n(iii)  implementation  of  the  plan.  During  implementation,  WMAs  will  also  increase  the  reserve \nfund  established  during  its  formation  stage  through  further  beneficiary  contribution  and  fees \ncollected from leaseholders of embankment lands and water bodies. After WMA capacities are \nconfirmed, the WMA will enter into a formal O&M agreement with BWDB, based on which O&M \nresponsibilities are transferred. Annual monitoring of the management and performance of the \nconcerned WMAs will also be supported with technical, social, and financial audits. \n  \n29.  Main Facilities. Regarding the main facilities (defined as flood embankments, and major \nregulators  and  canals  for  a  command  area  of  over  2,500  ha),  the  Project  will  establish  a  joint \nmanagement system between BWDB, LGIs, and WMAs, following the NWP.18 Specifically, it will \ninstitutionalize  (i)  preparation  of  annual  O&M  plans  following  a  standardized  guideline  through \njoint  inspections  with  WMAs;  and  (ii)  plan  implementation  by  WMAs  for  facility  operation  and \nroutine  preventive  maintenance,  and  by  BWDB \nits \nimplementation period, the Project will also support O&M, with a declining ADB funding share.   \n \n\nfor  periodic  maintenance.  During \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Project Management Systems and Institutions Strengthened \n\nProject  Management  Systems.  To  ensure  the  quality  of  its  output,  the  Project  will \n30. \noperate participatory management and quality control systems through the project management \noffice (PMO) and scheme-level subproject management offices (SMOs), with the support of the \nISPMS  consultants.  To  ensure  participatory  implementation  and  O&M  sustainability,  joint \n                                                 \n16 For  selected  well-performing  WMAs,  training  will  also  be  provided  to  enhance  managerial  capacities  to  facilitate \nimproved farmer access to agriculture inputs and other services collectively to reach better deals with providers. \n17 In  addition,  a  proposal  is  being  prepared  to  support  pilot  implementation  of  point  source-based  alternative  water \nsupply  options  (for  proposed  funding  of  $1  million  through  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction)  including \nrainwater harvesting, dug wells, pond sand filters, and deep tube wells, for areas where WMA members have little \nnearby access to arsenic-free drinking water. The program will focus on the poorest groups of women.  \n\n18 Under joint management, WMAs are responsible for facility operation  and minor routine preventive maintenance, \n\nwhereas the project authority is responsible for periodic and emergency maintenance.  \n\n\fmanagement  committees  (JMCs)  will  be  set  up  following  the  NWP  and  BWDB  Act  2000.  The \nJMCs  will  comprise  representatives  of  WMAs,  LGIs,  BWDB,  LGED,  and  line  agencies,  along \nwith their subunit-level subcommittees. JMCs and their subcommittees will be trained to make \nsubproject  decisions  at  the  scheme  and  the  subunit  levels,  respectively,  including  project \nprogram  delivery  and  annual  O&M,  based  on  which  specific  works  will  be  undertaken  by  the \nresponsible  organizations,  with  monitoring  by  the  WMAs.  Within  this  framework,  the  Project\u2019s \nquality control system ensures (i) due recording and reporting at SMOs on institutional, physical, \nfinancial  progress  against  the  specified  targets  and  schedules  in  IWMPs  and  SIPs;  and  (ii) \nregular SMO-PMO review meetings to be operated as part of the internal audit mechanism.   \n\n31. \nInstitutions Strengthened through Training  and Advisory Support. The Project will \nprovide  training  to  strengthen  project  institutions,  including  operating  staff  and  trainers,  with  a \ndistinct  output  target  to  create  a  pool  of  professional  staff  who  institutionalize  the participatory \nand  integrated  business  processes  embodied  in  the  NWP,  with  progressively  reducing \nconsultancy  support  that  is  provided  with  a  clear  exit  strategy  and  performance  targets  for \nrelevant  staff  positions.  Project  training  will  enhance  skills  for  participatory  IWMP  preparation; \nsocially  inclusive  WMA  development  and  management;  management  of  diverse  stakeholder \ninterests;  resettlement;  design  and  construction  management;  environmental  management; \nagriculture,  fishery,  and  livelihood  enhancement;  sustainable  O&M;  and  quality  control.  In \naddition,  in  coordination  with  other  externally  assisted  programs,  advisory  support  will  be \nprovided for progress of the generic policy and institutional actions (Appendix 5).    \n\n32.  Management  Information  Systems  (MIS)  for  Hydrology  and  FCD/I  Performance. \nThe Project will strengthen the MIS in (i) hydrological data collection and sharing, and (ii) FCD/I \nscheme  performance  in  the  project  subregions. As  to  the  former,  the  Project  will  set  up  water \nuser inventories, strengthen the existing data collection and management system, establish an \ninformation  networking  system  of  salinity  data  in  the  dry  season  for  LGIs  and  water  user \nrepresentatives in the project and the downstream areas, and support informed and coordinated \nwater withdrawal.19 The Project will also operate an MIS to regularly monitor the existing FCD/I \nscheme  performance  including  maintenance  requirements  in  its  subregions,  to  be  operated \nnationwide in collaboration with other sector projects including the WMIP.   \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe  Project  will  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  water  sector  operations  by  implementing \n\n33. \nkey policy principles, improving sector governance, and furthering reform actions:   \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nIt  will  operationalize  the  key  principles  of  the  NWP,  particularly  participatory  and \nintegrated  planning,  development,  and  management  of  water  to  address  diverse \nstakeholder  interests,  environmental  concerns,  and  other  local  constraints  on \nagriculture, fishery, and livelihood in the FCD/I areas. Pro-poor focus will be pursued \nwith representation of the vulnerable poor in WMAs and targeted delivery of support.  \nIt  will  institutionalize  sustainable  O&M  for  medium-sized  and  large  FCD/I  schemes, \nwith  joint  management  with  and  management  transfer  to WMAs,  another  key  NWP \nprinciple.  This  follows  good  practices  and  lessons  proven  effective  in  small  FCD/I \nschemes  assisted  by  ADB  to  support  WMA-managed  O&M.  A  range  of  agreed \nactions will also be pursued to improve funding of jointly managed facilities (para 42).  \nIt  will  operate  stringent  quality  control  systems  by  clearly  stipulating  process  and \nimpact  targets  in  SIPs,  and  progressively  implementing  subproject  works  by \nconfirming  the  achievement  of  the  predefined  targets  at  each  step,  with  improved \n\n                                                 \n19 In  this  context,  regular  hydrological  monitoring  of  a  completed  Khulna  Jessore  drainage  rehabilitation  project  will \n\nalso be undertaken, along with WMA institutional monitoring and support.  \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n(iv) \n\nmonitoring  and  control  systems.  It  will  also  support  broad  institutional  actions  to \nenhance sector governance in coordination with other externally assisted programs. \nIt will strengthen WMAs as responsible agents to provide self-help efforts for facility \nO&M, and then empower them to take lead roles in subproject decision making and \nmonitor the program delivery, thereby transforming the agency role from implementer \nto service provider. Progressive WMAs will also be trained as a local enterprise with \ncollective bargaining power, facilitating farmer communication with service providers. \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n34. \nThe total project cost is estimated at about $43.4 million equivalent, of which $9.7 million \n(22%)  represents  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $33.7  million  equivalent  (78%)  the  local \ncurrency cost (Table 1), including taxes and duties of $3.0 million (Appendix 6).   \n\nTable 1.

The Executing Agency of the Project will be BWDB. A \ncentral  project  coordination  office  (PCO)  will  be  established  in  Planning  Directorate  II  with  its \ndirector  assigned  as  project  coordinator  to  provide  technical  backstopping,  financial  control,  \nfacilitation  with  central  agencies,  and  coordination  with  other  externally  financed  projects  for \nharmonized  support. 21 For  central  coordination,  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be \nformed comprising representatives of the concerned ministries and agencies.22 The secretary of \nthe  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MOWR)  will  chair  the  PSC,  with  the  project  coordinator  as \nmember  secretary.  PSC  will  be  held  semiannually  during  the  first  year  and  annually  from  the \nsecond year or whenever required. The organizational structure of the Project is in Appendix 7.  \n\nUnder this central setup, a PMO will be established in BWDB\u2019s southwest zonal office in \n37. \nFaridpur.  A  senior  superintending  engineer/additional  chief  engineer  having  multidisciplinary \nexperience  will  head  the  PMO  as  full-time  project  director  (PD).  The  PMO  will  (i)  manage  an \noverall  implementation  plan,  annual  work  plans  and  budgets;  (ii)  liaise  with  BWDB,  WARPO, \nLGED,  and  other  line  agencies  for  technical  backstopping,  IWMP  clearance  (by  WARPO), \nmanagerial  support,  and  other  central-level  activities;  (iii)  prepare  IWMPs  of  additional  FCD/I \nsystems with the support of the relevant SMOs; (iv) liaise with, monitor, and supervise SMOs for \nsubproject implementation; (v) manage financial accounts; and (vi) prepare periodic reports on \nimplementation  progress,  with  the  support  of  the  ISPMS  consultants.  Five  SMOs  under  the \ncontrol  of  the  PMO  will  be  established  at  the  level  of  individual  subprojects,23 building  on  the \nexisting  setup  of  the  concerned  BWDB  divisional  and  subdivisional  offices  supplemented  by \nrequired  staff.  Each  SMO  will  be  headed  by  a  senior  executive  engineer  with  participatory \nexperience  to  be  appointed  as  subproject  manager.  The  SMO  is  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation activities. It will (i) support the PMO planning unit to prepare IWMPs; (ii) manage \nthe overall subproject implementation plans, annual work plans, and budgets; (iii) prepare and \nimplement SIPs with proper recording and reporting to the PMO; and (iv) coordinate with JMC, \nline departments, LGIs, and NGOs. \n\n                                                 \n21  WARPO and LGED will assign a principal scientific officer and superintending engineer as project coordinators. \n22  Including the Economic Relations Division, Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division, Local Government \nDivision, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Ministry of Fishery and Livestock, Ministry of \nLand,  Ministry  of  Water  Resources,  Planning  Commission,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives  Division,  and \ntheir line departments concerned, including the Department of Public Health Engineering.   \n23 Two SMOs will be established to implement the two sample subprojects in Narail district.  \n\n11 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nTo  operationalize  participatory  planning,  implementation,  and  O&M,  a  JMC  will  be \n38. \nestablished  in  each  subproject.  It  will  have  representatives  from  WMAs,  LGIs,  and  subdistrict \nlevel-line department heads, and be initially chaired by the PD during the planning stage and by \nthe  superintending  engineer  of  the  BWDB  subzonal  office  after  IWMP  approval. 24 A  formal \ninstitutional setup for a permanent JMC will be defined by the time of the midterm review. The \nJMC  will  make  subproject  decisions,  such  as  endorsing  the  IWMP,  annual  and  periodic \nprograms, implementation schedules, and O&M, based on which programs are delivered by the \ndesignated  organizations  under  SMO  management.  Its  subcommittees  will  be  formed  for \npreparing and implementing SIPs with the concerned line departments, LGIs and WMAs.  \n\n39. \nTo  support  coordinated  planning  and  implementation  of  IWMPs,  LGED  will  (i)  provide \ntechnical inputs for preparing IWMPs, (ii) implement small subunits in IWMPs having less than \n1,000 ha command area and limited relations with main FCD/I structures (following the NWP),25 \nand  (iii)  upgrade  rural  roads  placed  on  flood  embankments  identified  in  IWMPs  for  joint  use. \nThrough their subdistrict offices, DAE and DOF will provide technical inputs for IWMP and SIP \npreparation  and  extension  for  agriculture  and  fishery  development,  and  supervising  private \nproviders  and  NGOs  fielded  through  SMOs.  The  Ministry  of  Land  will  lease  the  water  bodies \nmanaged with subproject structures to the concerned WMAs. The Department of Cooperatives \n(DOC) will provide regulatory support to WMAs while conducting training for their organizational \nmanagement.  The  Department  of  Environment  will  clear  the  subproject  environmental \ndocuments  and  monitor  environmental  impacts.  Specific  cooperation  arrangements  will  be \nagreed upon under individual memorandums of understanding (MOUs) between BWDB/MOWR \nand the concerned agencies within 9 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \nSubproject  Selection  Criteria  and  Implementation  Procedures.  The  Project  will \n40. \nprepare and implement  IWMPs for additional FCD/I schemes covering 43,000 ha, following the \nselection  criteria  in  Appendix  8:  (i)  a  benefit  area  of  less  than  14,000  ha,  (ii)  insignificant \nenvironmental impacts duly confirmed, (iii) robust economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of over \n14%,  (iv)  poverty  incidence  higher  than  the  national  average,  and  (v)  confirmed  beneficiary \nwillingness \ntake  over  O&M  responsibility.  Prospective  schemes  with  pre-feasibility \nassessments will be proposed by the PMO and approved by a scheme appraisal subcommittee \n(SASC) placed under the PSC and chaired by WARPO, and then cleared by ADB. The IWMPs \nwill  be  prepared  by  the  PMO  with  JMC  endorsement,  and  approved  by  SASC,  WARPO,  and \nADB. The implementation procedure (Appendix 9) essentially follows the GPWM. IWMPs will be \nimplemented  on  the  basis of  individual  subunits,  and  will  follow  the  steps  following  the  project \ncomponent structure, with engagement of NGOs, CBOs, and private providers.   \n \n41.  WMA  Legal  Framework.  Under  the  Project,  WMAs  will  be  established  following  the \nlegal  framework  of  the  Cooperatives  Societies  Act  (2001)  and  Cooperative  Societies  Rules \n(2004)  as  amended,  and  the  GPWM,  and  federated  at  each  subproject  level.  Registration  of \nWMAs  will  authorize  them  to  implement  O&M  including  enforcing  resource  mobilization  from \nbeneficiaries  through  fees  and  contributions  of  labor  or  in  kind.  In  view  of  the  relatively  new \nexperience with legal WMAs, however, the Government plans to study the performance of the \nexisting  WMA  legal  framework,  and  assess  possible  measures  for  improvement  including  the \npossibility of alternative frameworks.26 The Project through its consultants will review and advise \non  the  evaluation  process  and  follow-on  actions,  including  the  pilot  testing  of  an  alternative \nframework. Improved measures may be considered in accordance with the recommendations.    \n                                                 \n24  During the planning stage, the JMC is joined by project coordinators from WARPO and LGED.   \n25 This will be undertaken using the loan funds of the ongoing project for small-scale FCD/I schemes (footnote 7: to \n\nto \n\nbe closed in 2009). They cover up to 10% of the two sample scheme areas. \n\n26 The study will be undertaken in FY2006\u2013FY2007 under the ongoing ADB-assisted project (footnote 7).  \n\n\fSustainable  O&M.  Sustaining  O&M  of  FCD/I  infrastructures  has  been  a  critical  sector \n42. \nchallenge.27 The NWP and ongoing reforms aim to tackle the issue by (i) rationalizing recurrent \nexpenditure  with  staff  reduction  (by  over  50%)  and  management  transfer  to  WMAs,  (ii) \nenhancing revenues through recovery of O&M cost of public irrigation schemes and leasing of \nembankment and canal lands,28 and (iii) enhancing the O&M budget and its management. The \nProject will harmonize those steps with other programs. Specifically, BWDB is now setting up a \nsound  MIS  comprising  scheme  inventories  and  a  monitoring  system  of  scheme  performance \nand maintenance needs, for national operation under the Project and other programs including \nWMIP.  Based  on  this  MIS,  BWDB  will  introduce  a  performance-based  budget  management \nsystem (PBMS) for O&M where allocation is prioritized to well-performing schemes, particularly \nthose  following  the  NWP  framework. 29  The  Government  has  also  recognized  the  need  for \nsufficient  maintenance,  and  BWDB\u2019s  repair  budgets  were  annually  increased  by  15%  since \nFY2004,  following  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  directive.  The  Government\u2019s  medium-term  budgetary \nframework for MOWR, to be finalized in FY2006 following the PRSP, reflects a similar increase, \nalong  with  the  above  reform  measures.  At  the  scheme  level,  the  Project  will  set  up  WMA-\nmanaged O&M following good practices of ADB-assisted project for small FCD/I schemes. The \nProject  will  also  prepare  O&M  manuals  and  undertake  pilot  introduction  of  contracted \nmaintenance. The innovations will enhance the sustainability of the concerned schemes.   \n \n43. \nGovernance  and  Anticorruption.  Good  governance  is  a  critical  element  for  ensuring \nand sustaining the intended benefits from FCD/I renovations. BWDB has established a genuine \nfinancial  management  system  with  CIDA  support  by  setting  up  separate  regional  accounting \ncenters with computerization.30 Building on this system, the Project will institutionalize stringent \nprocess  and  output  management,  and  internal  and  external  quality  control  mechanisms. \nSpecifically, subprojects will be planned by setting out clear input and output targets in IWMPs \nand SIPs, and progressively implemented by confirming that predefined targets are achieved at \neach  stage.  WMAs  are  empowered  to  endorse  SIPs,  along  with  periodic  program  documents \nwith  full  information  disclosure  including  expenditures,  and  to  monitor  and  confirm  program \ndelivery.  For  internal  quality  control,  the  Project,  with  the  support  of  the  consultants,  will \ninstitutionalize  (i)  due  recording  by  SMOs  of  subproject  progress  on  comprehensive  indicators \nincluding construction quality verified with trained WMA representatives, and (ii) monitoring and \nauditing by the PMO. In addition, following the arrangements being introduced under an ADB-\nassisted TA,31 external performance and pilot technical auditing will also be applied through the \nCAG  office  by  engaging  private  auditors.32 External  financial,  social,  and  institutional  audit  of \nWMAs will also be operated through the DOC in collaboration with the SMO. In these contexts, \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was fully explained and discussed with the Government.33   \n \n\n                                                 \n27  The  annual  BWDB  budget  for  regular  and  periodic  maintenance  is  about  $35  million  (excluding  staff  costs),  and \n\nremains about 50% of the requirements estimated for functional schemes, on average.   \n\n28  The NWP does not envisage O&M cost recovery of flood control and drainage facilities (except those transferred to \n\nWMAs), in view of the public goods nature of the benefits.  \n\n29 The MIS design and PBMS framework drafting were completed prior to loan negotiations. \n30 BWDB\u2019s financial management was reviewed and found generally satisfactory (Supplementary Appendix H).  \n31  ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  Supporting  Good  Governance \n\nInitiatives. Manila. \n\n32  The consultants will further include a provision for random expenditure tracking surveys by external auditors. \n33 Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nthe  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan \nregulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection \nwith the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts \nof the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the \nProject.  \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n44. \nThe  project  implementation  period  will  be  7  years,  starting  from  April  2006.  The  two \nsample subprojects will be implemented during the first 6 years through sequential progress in \nWMA institutional development, infrastructure, and support programs in individual subunits. The \nremaining subprojects will be assisted with IWMP preparation in the first 1.5 years, followed by \nimplementation for 3\u20135 years, depending on the scheme size (Appendix 10).  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n45. \nGoods and related services, and civil works to be financed from the ADB loan proceeds \nwill  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles,  equipment, \nand  materials  will  be  procured  by  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  where  the  estimated \ncost is valued at more than $1 million equivalent, by international shopping for packages from \n$300,000 to $1 million equivalent, or by local competitive bidding (LCB), typically those specified \nin  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Regulations  2003  (PPR),  for  $300,000  or  less.  Civil \nworks will be procured in accordance with LCB procedures acceptable to ADB, typically those \nspecified in the PPR. Given the small size of individual contracts (less than $2.0 million), they \nare  unlikely  to  attract  international  bidders.  LCB  civil  works  procurement  will  follow  the  single-\nstage, one-envelope procedure with postqualification. Small earthwork contracts valued at less \nthan $8,000 may be awarded to labor contracting societies (LCS) to be formed within the WMA \nwith NGO support. Appendix 11 shows indicative contract packages. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n46. \nThe Project will include a consultancy package for ISPMS. It aims to fill capacity gaps to \ndeliver  the  intended  project  outputs  while  institutionalizing  the  set  processes.  A  total  of  72 \nperson-months of international and 532 person-months of domestic consulting services will be \nrequired for this purpose. (Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 12). The consultants will \nbe engaged following the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  for  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants,  through  quality-and-cost  based \nselection  procedures  with  advance  recruitment.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that \nadvance action does not commit ADB or the Netherlands Government to finance the Project. In \nview of the nonengineering complexity and the need for early mobilization, ADB will select the \nISPMS  consultants.  The  Project  will  also  require  the  services  of  private  service  providers \nincluding NGOs and firms to (i) carry out participatory rural appraisals for IWMP preparation and \nsocioeconomic  surveys;  (ii)  mobilize  subproject  stakeholder  groups  for  WMAs;  (iii)  prepare \nSIPs;  (iv)  survey,  design,  and  supervise  civil  works;  (v)  refine  and  implement  RPs;  (v)  deliver \nvarious  support  services;  and  (vi)  carry  out  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E).  Technically \nqualified providers will be engaged, using selection procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n47. \nThe Government will make funds available to BWDB/PMO through budgetary allocation. \nThe  Government  of  the  Netherlands  will  disburse  funds  to  ADB  for  administration  as  jointly \ncofinanced funds. The proceeds for ADB loan and jointly cofinanced funds will be advanced to \nBWDB  and  deposited  in  dollar  impressed  accounts  at  the  Bangladesh  Bank  or  any  other \ncommercial bank nominated by the Bangladesh Bank or Ministry of Finance and acceptable to \nADB.  The  imprest  account  will  be  managed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (January  2001),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and \nADB. The initial amount released to the imprest account will not exceed 6 months of estimated \n\n \n\n\fexpenditure and not more than 10% of the total loan amount. To facilitate reimbursement and \nliquidation  of  small  contracts  from  the  imprest  account,  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure (SOE) will be followed for individual payment transactions not exceeding $50,000.  \n\n6. \n\nAccounting and Auditing \n\n48. \nBWDB/PCO, PMO, and SMOs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources \nreceived, expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds, in accordance with \ngenerally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Consolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements  will  be  compiled  by  BWDB/PCO  and  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  annual  audit  will  include  the  audit  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE \nprocedures.  A  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  SOE  procedures \nwill  be  included  in  the  annual  audit  report.  The  audited  accounts,  audit  report,  and  related \nfinancial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the close of the fiscal \nyear to which they relate. PMO will resolve all audit opinions within the following 6 months.   \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, and Reporting \n\n49.  M&E of project performance will comprise (i) subproject baseline data and output targets \nset  up  during  IWMP  and  SIP  preparation  kept  in  SMOs  and  the  PMO;  (ii)  comprehensive \nimplementation-related  indicators  duly  collected  and  recorded  by  SMOs  and  reported  to  JMC \nand  PMO,  and  periodically  audited  by  the  PMO;  and  (iii)  postcompletion  performance  and \nimpact  data  collected  by  SMOs  and  WMAs  kept  in  SMOs  and  the  PMO.  The  system  will \nestablish a set of monitorable targets and indicators for results-based management following the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  with  dynamic  adjustment,  and  disaggregated \ndata by gender and landholding size. Implementation monitoring will integrate financial and non-\nfinancial  aspects.  The  PMO  will  establish  an  effective  MIS  within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness \nand will prepare and submit quarterly progress reports and annual benefit monitoring reports to \nADB. A detailed study will be conducted to review project progress before the midterm review \n(MTR). An impact evaluation study will be undertaken in preparing a project completion report, \nwhich will be submitted to ADB within 3 months after the physical completion of the Project. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n50.  MOWR,  ADB,  and  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  will  review  the  project  at  least \ntwice  a  year.  The  regular  reviews  will  cover  the  performance  of  BWDB  and  other  institutions, \nloan covenants including implementation of the policy and institutional action plans and gender \naction plan, and physical progress of project implementation. A comprehensive MTR in year 3 \nwill evaluate (i) project progress including quality of services delivered, (ii) impacts of economic \nand other indicators, (iii) effectiveness of project management and implementation, (iv) progress \nin policy and institutional actions, and (v) future implementation plan and targets.34 The project \ndesign and implementation arrangements will be adjusted as necessary. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\nAt  full  development,  the  Project  will  rehabilitate  a  gross  area  of  100,000  ha  (of  which \n51. \nabout 73,000 ha is cultivated land) of FCD/I schemes suffering form low productivity and a high \n\n                                                 \n34  The Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division will also undertake midterm evaluation of the Project.  \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nflooding, \n\nincidence of poverty. About 150,000 households will benefit from improved livelihood activities. \nRehabilitation  will  decrease \nirrigation.  The \nimprovement  will  allow  farmers  to  increase  cropping  intensity  and  improve  crop  yields.  With \nbetter  flood  protection,  an  increase  in  culture  fishery  production  is  also  expected.  These  will \ninduce  a  demand  for  hired  labor  and  benefit  the  poor  who  have  little,  if  any,  land.  Major \nquantified benefits are shown in Appendix 13. Nonquantified benefits include operation of sound \ninstitutions  for  IWMP  preparation,  implementation,  and  O&M;  improved  sector  governance \nthrough institutional strengthening; and increased traffic on improved embankment roads.  \n\nimprove  drainage,  and \n\nincrease \n\n52. \nFinancial and economic analyses were carried out for the two sample subprojects. The \nChenchuri Beel subproject covers 17,900 ha of net cultivated area and Narail, 23,400 ha. While \nthey  are  protected  by  the  existing  flood  embankments  built  in  the  early  1980s35 and  that  have \nremained functional without further external aid, their productivity is affected by degraded main \ninfrastructure  and  lack  of  minor  water  control  facilities  to  address  local  problems.  The  Project \nwill  increase  cropping  intensity  by  15%  to  about  220%,  with  modest  improvements  in  yield \n(primarily through shifts to high yielding varieties of paddy and other crops) resulting in annual \noutputs  increasing  by  54,800  t.  Culture  fish  production  will  also  increase  by  1,200  t.  Annual \nO&M  demand  is  estimated  to  cost  $0.48  million,  of  which  BWDB  and  WMAs  will  bear  about \n70%  and  30%,  respectively.  While  BWDB\u2019s  present  national  O&M  budget  is  short  of  the \nestimated demand by up to 50%, the gap will be addressed by the actions synthesized in para. \n42. WMA contribution amounts to less than 10% of incremental farmer incomes, a comparable \nlevel pursued and practiced in the LGED project assisted by ADB. The estimated EIRR is 16.5% \nfor  Chenchuri  Beel  and 21.2%  for  Narail.  Sensitivity  analysis  to  test  the  impacts  of  a  range  of \nrisks  including  in  investment  costs,  output  prices,  yields,  and  project  life  showed  that  project \nreturns are generally robust. The greatest risk appears to be reduction in price of food grains in \nChenchuri Beel, but even a drop of 20% in its price will still produce an EIRR of 12%.36  \n \nB. \n\nHousehold and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n\n53. \nThe  Project  will  have  positive  poverty  reduction  impacts  on  income,  employment \nopportunities including those for tenant farmers and sharecroppers (that are arising from labor \nconstraints experienced by larger farmers), and food security. According to the socioeconomic \nsurvey, poverty incidence in the two subproject areas is about 55%, and is concentrated among \nthose in agriculture, fishery, and labor as primary occupation, and among landless and marginal \nand small farmers with up to 1 ha landholding. Annual incremental crop income will be 16\u201318% \nfor all sizes of farms. Increase in hired labor income will be 14\u201316% and will go almost entirely \nto  marginal  and  landless  households.  In  local  financial  terms,  43\u201346%  of  incremental  income \ndue to the Project will go to the poor. \n   \nC. \n\nSocial and Gender Development Strategy \n\n54. \nThe Project is highly participatory in design and will be implemented following a process \napproach involving all stakeholders in decision making. Appendix 14 gives the summary poverty \nreduction and social development strategy. The project subregion does not have any indigenous \npeoples.  The  specific  strategy  includes  (i)  pro-poor  procedures  and  guidelines  for  beneficiary \nselection and employment; (ii) membership and credit access to WMAs; (iii) WMA participation \nin design, planning, implementing, and monitoring with inclusive by-laws; (iv) a comprehensive \ncapacity  development  plan  highlighting  project  staff,  WMAs,  and  village  groups;  (v)  guidelines \n\n                                                 \n35  Original investment for Chenchuri Beel was funded by the World Bank, whereas a part of that for Narail was funded \n\nby the Government of the Netherlands. \n\n36  The minimum project life that generates justifiable EIRR is 11 years for Narail and 12.5 years for Chenchuri Beel. \n\n\ffor  social  activities  such  as  conflict  resolution,  anti-dowry  drives,  and  women  representation; \nand (vi) procedures for networking and linkages among WMAs and service- providing agencies. \nThe  strategy  will  also  establish  consultative  platforms  at  the  village  level  for  LGIs  and  NGOs \nbefore  appropriate  interventions  are  planned  for  water  infrastructure,  farming  and  nonfarming \nproduction,  and  income  generation.  Training  will  be  provided  for  leadership  and  confidence \nbuilding to enable the poor and women\u2019s groups to form WMAs capable of infrastructure O&M. \nVillage  facilitators  will  also  be  selected  and  trained.  Procedures  for  coordination  among  LGI \nrepresentatives, NGOs, and WMAs will also be established for effective service delivery.  \n\n55. \nThe  Project\u2019s  gender  action  plan  (Appendix  15),  to  be  further  adjusted  during  its \nimplementation, includes (i) employment of female staff at all levels and training for field staff in \ngender-sensitive  and  participatory  planning  and  project  implementation;  (ii)  employment \nopportunities for women generated by the project and O&M works, and training for all aspects of \nO&M;  (iii)  training  for  women's  work  in  farm  and  homestead  production;  (iv)  strengthening  the \nextension  system  to  become  gender-equitable;  (v)  response  to  women's  agricultural  and \nhousehold needs for technology in close collaboration with implementing agencies and NGOs; \n(vi) support for women in their home-based postharvest production, processing, and marketing \nactivities by providing local market information and linkages; and (vii) training for women in crop \nand  horticulture  production,  postharvest  operations,  poultry  and  small  livestock  rearing,  social \nforestry,  fisheries  production  and  processing,  credit,  seed  production,  and  nutrition  education. \nGender-specific monitoring indicators will also be set up to support the plan. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nAn environmental impact assessment (EIA) was carried out during the PPTA for the two \n56. \nsample  FCD/I  schemes  in  view  of  their  large  geographic  coverage. 37 The  Project  will  have \npositive  impacts  on  the  environment,  including  (i)  improved  flood  management;  (ii)  improved \nwater use efficiency through water retention and storage, with reduced pressure on groundwater \nextraction; (iii) reduced salinity intrusion through water regulating structures, thereby preventing \nland  degradation;  and  (iv)  reduced  waterlogging  through  drainage  improvement.  On  the  other \nhand,  negative  impacts  will  include  (i)  possible  exacerbation  of  downstream  salinity  intrusion \ndue to excessive river water abstraction, (ii) obstruction of fish migration between the rivers and \ninternal water bodies by regulators and other structures, (iii) deterioration of water quality due to \nagriculture intensification, and (iv) impacts during construction of structures and embankments. \nThe  impacts  are  mitigated  by  (i)  implementing  salinity  monitoring  and  an  information  sharing \nprogram in the project and downstream areas with promotion of coordinated water abstraction, \n(ii) introducing and promoting fish-friendly design and operation of regulators with provision for \nfish culture opportunities, (iii) introducing integrated pest management and effective soil nutrient \nmanagement;  and  (iv)  ensuring  safe  and  environmentally  sound  construction  practices.  These \nare incorporated in the EIA and the summary EIA.  \n \n57. \nThe  overall  responsibility  for  environmental  management  is  with  the  PMO,  with  the \nexperienced  executive  engineer  assigned  as  chief  resettlement  and  environmental  manager, \nassisted  by  the  consultants.  In  the  SMO,  a  subdivisional  engineer  will  be  assigned  as \nenvironmental  officer  responsible  for  field  management  and  reporting,  with  monitoring  and \nsupport by PMO and the consultants. For further subprojects, initial environmental examinations \n(IEEs) and EIAs, if required following the IEEs, will be undertaken by the PMO with consultant \nsupport,  in  accordance  with  Government  and  ADB  requirements,  and  following  the  EIA \nprepared for sample subprojects. All IEEs/EIAs will be endorsed by the Government and ADB.  \n\n                                                 \n37 The summary EIA was circulated to the Board on 14 July 2005. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nE. \n\nResettlement \n\n58. \n In the two sample subprojects, land acquisition and resettlement needs associated with \nwater  infrastructure  works  were  studied  during  the  PPTA.  A  resettlement  framework  (RF)  and \nsample  RPs  were  prepared,  following  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  and  other  social \nsafeguards  policies.  Subproject  implementation  will  require  strip  acquisition  of  land  for \nresectioning and realigning embankments and placement of structures, totaling 56 ha of land in \nthe  sample  subprojects.  Under  the  Project,  the  RF  will  be  followed,  and  all  affected  persons \n(APs) will be entitled to compensation for land taken for the purpose of the project interventions, \nfor  lost  assets,  and  for  incomes  at  replacement  cost  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  their \npreproject living standards, income levels, and productive capacity. The PMO will supervise RP \npreparation and  implementation  by  the  concerned  SMO  through  private  firms  and  NGOs,  with \nthe  support  of  the  consultants.  The  RPs  as  prepared  with  IWMPs  as  well  as  those  for \nfinalization with detailed designs will be sent to ADB for approval. In implementing the RPs, a \ngrievance redressing mechanism with representatives from the PMO, APs, LGIs, and the NGO \nwill  be  established.  The  PMO  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  an  annual  report  on  the  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  issues.  An  independent  M&E  agency  will  also  be  engaged  to \nassess performance and impacts. The provisional cost estimate for resettlement is about $3.4 \nmillion equivalent. Appendix 16 gives the summary RF and RPs. \n \nF. \n\nRisks \n\nThe  Project  has  certain  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  effective  implementation  and \n\n59. \nsustainable benefits. It has incorporated mitigating measures to the maximum extent possible. \n \n60. \nInsufficient Stakeholder Participation. There is a possibility that the concerned WMAs \nmay not sufficiently represent stakeholders with diverse interests in the subunit area, and fail to \noperate  water  management  facilities  equitably  with  due  coordination.  To  avoid  the  risk,  the \nProject will ensure at least 70% of the beneficiary households will be enrolled in WMAs prior to \nphysical  works  of  the  subunit,  an  approach  followed  in  ADB-assisted  project  for  small-scale \nFCD/I  schemes  implemented  by  LGED.  It  will  also  ensure  due  representation  of  different \nstakeholders, particularly the poor in the WMA committees. Intensive monitoring will be provided \nthrough the SMO, the ISPMS consultants, and the DOC for sound operation of WMAs.  \n\n61. \nSustainability\u2013Output  Quality  and  O&M.  Sustaining  the  project  impacts  will  require \ndelivering  quality  outputs  with  effective  interagency  coordination  and  governance  on  the  one \nhand,  and  sustainable  O&M  on  the  other.  The  former  will  be  pursued  by  ensuring  stringent \nprocess and output management with a participatory approach. Interagency coordination will be \naddressed by stipulating specific agency roles in the MOUs and providing necessary funding to \nsupport those roles. Output quality will be further enhanced through strengthened internal and \nexternal  quality  control  mechanisms  with  capacity  development,  including  (i)  a  sound  MIS \noperated by SMOs with proper programming, recording, and reporting in light of defined IWMP/ \nSIP  targets;  (ii)  improved  internal  auditing  mechanisms  operated  by  the  PMO;  (iii)  monitoring \nand confirmation of program delivery and outputs by WMAs; and (iv) external performance and \ntechnical auditing applied by the CAG office. On the other hand, O&M sustainability is pursued \nthrough  comprehensive  measures,  including  enhanced  overall  O&M  budget  and  its  improved \nscheme-wise management at the policy level, and increased WMA participation in O&M at the \nfield level. All measures will contribute to overall project sustainability.    \n\n62. \nBWDB  Management  Capacity  for  Participatory  Water  Management.  Past  projects \nhave  generally  demonstrated  the  insufficient  capacity  of  BWDB  in  participatory  water \n\n \n\n\fmanagement. However, BWDB is adopting decentralization, participation, client orientation, and \nmultisectoral  coordination  as  key  elements  of  its  institutional  vision,  and  has  launched  holistic \naction  plans  with  the  harmonized  support  of  external  funding  agencies.  In  line  with  this,  the \nProject will provide support for their effective implementation, with the objective of having BWDB \nprogressively  develop  the  capacity  to  operate  participatory  procedures,  arrangements,  and \nmanagement  systems.  To  address  the  human  resources  gap,  the  Project  will  institutionalize \noutsourcing arrangements to private service providers to support the social mobilization process \nand other nonengineering functions, with the assistance of the ISPMS consultants. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  BWDB  have  given  the \n\n63. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  will  undertake  all  time  bound  policy  and  institutional  actions  as \nspecified in Appendix 5, agreed upon with ADB.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  meet  the  selection  criteria  and \nimplementation arrangements and procedures as specified in Appendixes 8\u20139. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  WMAs  under  the  Project  will  be  established  in \naccordance  with  the  Cooperatives  Societies  Act  (2001)  and  Cooperative  Societies \nRules  (2004)  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  the  GPWM,  or  any  other  legal \nframework satisfactory to ADB. \nUpon  completion  of  a  subproject  program,  the  Government  will  transfer  to  the \nconcerned  WMAs  the  O&M  responsibility  for  the  subproject\u2019s  water  management \nstructures with command area of less than 2,500 ha, or as otherwise agreed upon by \nthe Government and ADB. To support the process, the Government will ensure that \nthe  implementation  agreement  with  the  WMA  is  signed  only  after  achieving  (a) \nmembership  enrollment  of  over  70%  of  direct  beneficiary  households,  (b)  full \ncollection  of  up-front  cash  contribution  equivalent  to  annual  O&M  costs  of  the \nfacilities  to  be  managed  by  the  WMA,  and  (c)  agreement  among  members  on  the \noperational rules of water control structures.   \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  share  of  ADB  and  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands funding for infrastructure O&M will be phased out starting from 60% in \nyear 3 of loan effectiveness and reduced by 20% in year 5 and year 7, respectively.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment, and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, as set out in the agreed-\nupon  RF  and  RP.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  in  case  of  any  discrepancies \nbetween Bangladesh\u2019s laws, regulations, and/or procedures and ADB\u2019s requirements \nincluding the Policy on involuntary resettlement, ADB\u2019s policy will apply. BWDB will \nensure  that  (a)  the  PMO  and  SMOs  have  resettlement  staff  throughout  project \nimplementation; (b) Narail and Chenchuri Beel subproject RPs are updated based on \ndetailed technical design, disclosed to APs, and submitted to ADB for approval; (c) \nother subproject RPs are prepared based on detailed technical design, disclosed to \nAPs and the ADB website, and submitted to ADB for approval in accordance with the \nRF agreed upon by ADB and the Borrower; (d) the PMO will submit the progress and \ncompletion  reports  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  that  will  be  included  in  the \nfinancial audit statements for each subproject; and (e) the external monitor\u2019s contract \nstates  that  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  simultaneously  to  ADB  and  BWDB. \nBWDB will not award contracts for any construction work unless the concerned RP \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n(vii) \n\ninto \n\nas required has been submitted to and approved by BWDB and ADB.

The rivers cause substantial seasonal variability of flows, posing \nkey physical challenges of (i) severe flooding, which not only inundates up to two thirds of the \ncountry  but  also  fills  river  channels  with  sediment  and  erodes  riverbanks,  causing  social \nhardships to the people along the rivers; (ii) limited water during the dry season and expanding \nwater  demand;  (iii)  saline  intrusion  and  environmental  degradation;  (iv) cyclones  and  tidal \nsurges  that  decimate  lives  and  property  in  the  coastal  areas;  and  (v) widespread  arsenic \ncontamination  of  groundwater.  With  the  dense  population  and  high  poverty  incidence,  water \nmanagement is further complicated by diverse interests among traditional livelihood activities of \nthe  rural  poor  including  agriculture,  fisheries,  transportation,  industries,  and  water  supply,  with \nwhich poverty is deeply associated. Water is also essential for the country\u2019s vulnerable natural \necosystems.  Hence  it  is  paramount  for  the  country  to  manage  this  critical  resource  in  an \nintegrated and strategic manner ensuring stakeholder participation. \n \n2. \nThe  National  Water  Resources  Council  (NWRC),  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister,  is  the \nhighest authority governing water resources management. The key agencies include the Water \nResources  Planning  Organization  (WARPO),  which  is  responsible  for  policy  formulation  and \nmacrolevel  planning  and  coordination;  the  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board  (BWDB),1 \nresponsible  for  water  resource  projects  exceeding  1,000  hectares  (ha)  of  command  area  and \nhydrology monitoring; and the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), responsible \nfor  projects  below  1,000  ha.2 In  general,  there  is  a  dire  need  for  sound  and  integrated  water \nresources management; however, the country\u2019s sector policies and institutional framework and \ncapacities have been unable to meet the diverse challenges effectively. Key institutional issues \ninclude  (i)  weakness  in  participatory,  integrated,  and  strategic  planning;  (ii)  lack  of  agency \ncapacity  to  implement  water  resource  interventions  with  sufficient  support  to  participatory \nprocesses while ensuring the quality of outputs; (iii) lack of coordination in delivering necessary \nsupport services to achieve intended economic benefits in agriculture and fisheries; (iv) deficient \noperation and maintenance (O&M) due to lack of beneficiary participation and chronic shortage \nof funds for O&M; and (v) insufficient operational transparency and accountability. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nIn 1995, the Government launched a major initiative toward establishing a sound policy, \nplanning,  institutional,  and  legal  framework  for  the  sector.  The  critical  need  was  recognized  \nafter  the  outcome  of  the  Flood  Action  Plan  (FAP)  studies  and  pilot  projects,  which  involved \ncoordinated  assistance  from  16  external  funding  agencies  including  ADB  between  1990  and \n1995.  Accordingly,  the  National  Water  Policy  (NWP)  was  prepared  and  approved  in  1999.  It \n\nGovernment\u2019s Policy, Strategy, and Reform Initiatives  \n\n                                                 \n1   Under the policy guidance of the Governing Council, BWDB is headed by a director general (DG) and comprises \nfive  departments  (finance,  administration,  planning,  and  two  operation  and  maintenance  [O&M]  divisions).  Field-\nlevel  operations  are  executed  by  its  60  hydrological  division  offices  across  the  country  through  their  subordinate \nsub-divisional  offices,  which  are  under  19  superintending  engineers,  seven  chief  engineers,  and  two  additional \nDGs  for  O&M.  There  are  1,016  class  I  posts  (mostly  engineers  and  account  staff,  and  a  small  number  of  non-\nengineers) and 7,844 other posts.   \n\n2   LGED is responsible for all types of local government infrastructure, including rural roads. It is headed by a chief \nengineer (CE)  at its headquarters having two additional CEs and six subject matter superintending engineers for \ntechnical backstopping and quality control.  Projects are  executed  by its 61 district-level executive offices through \n465 subdistrict offices placed under 10 superintending engineers. There are 9,628 posts.   \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nestablished the sector goals and guidelines to effectively manage these critical resources, and \nadopted  the  principles  of  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  with  emphasis  on \nstakeholder participation, strategic planning, decentralization, sound management of social and \nenvironmental  issues,  sustainable  O&M  through  management  transfer  to  water  management \nassociations  (WMAs),  and  autonomy,  transparency,  and  accountability  of  sector  institutions. \nBWDB institutional reforms have made certain progress, including (i) restructuring of the board \nof  directors  into  a  governing  council  that  includes  stakeholder  representatives  to  decide  on \npolicy  issues;  (ii)  long-term  assignment  of  leadership;  (iii)  staff  rationalization  (from  18,032  to \n8,860  between  1999  and  2006);  and  (iv)  diversification  of  the  skills  mix  to  increase  non-\nengineers  such  as  agronomists,  fishery  and  environment  specialists.  LGED  has  also \nestablished an Integrated Water Resources Unit while strengthening the skills mix to meet the \ndiverse  socio-environmental  needs  of  the  stakeholders.  On  the  legal  and  regulatory  side,  a \nnational water act under preparation will comprehensively govern the use and management of \nwater. Guidelines for participatory water management (GPWM) have been finalized, stipulating \nmanagement transfer and for local participation arrangements in water resources schemes.  \n\nThe  Government  also  prepared  and  approved  in  2004  a  national  water  management \n4. \nplan (NWMP), which provides a framework for short-(5 years), medium-(10 years), and long-(25 \nyears) term strategy and priority programs. Building on the NWP, the NWMP established eight \nfocal agendas3 and identified 84 national-level programs proposed for implementation over the \nnext 25 years. In the short term, it heavily focuses on institutional development and an enabling \nenvironment,  along  with  critically  urgent  investment  programs.  Building  on  the  NWMP,  the \nGovernment\u2019s  National  Strategy \nfor  Economic  Growth,  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social \nDevelopment (March 2003), or interim poverty reduction strategy paper, prioritized (i) promoting \nrational  management  and  optimal  use  of  water  resources;  (ii)  improving  the  quality  of  life  by \nensuring  equitable,  safe,  and  reliable  access  to  water  for  production,  health  and  hygiene;  and \n(iii) ensuring availability of clean water in sufficient quantities for multiple uses, and preserving  \nthe aquatic and water-dependent ecosystems. Investment priorities specified for the rural water \nresources  sector  include  (i)  saving  properties  and  lives  by  controlling  river  erosion,  monsoon \nflooding,  and  saline  water  intrusion;  (ii)  improving  irrigation  and  reducing  drainage  congestion, \nand  mitigating  drought  by  reexcavating  canals  and  watercourses;  (iii)  rationalizing  existing \nprojects while promoting stakeholder participation and multiple uses of flood embankments; and \n(iv) mitigating the impacts of arsenic contamination of groundwater. \n\nC. \n\nADB\u2019s Experience and Activities of Other Development Partners \n\nthe  development  of  critical \n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided 33 technical assistance and 19 loan \n5. \nprojects amounting to $20 million and $675 million, respectively, since 1977. Recent assistance \nafter 1995 has increasing focus on improving the policy and institutional environment in support \nof \nin  coastal  areas; \ninfrastructure;  drainage \nimprovement  of  large-scale  flood  control,  drainage/irrigation  (FCD/I)  schemes;  application  of \nlower cost erosion mitigation in major rivers to protect  agricultural lands; and stakeholder-driven \nsmall-scale water resources infrastructure. Performance has been generally mixed\u2013large-scale \nprojects  had  faced  weak  stakeholder  participation  and  O&M,  although  there  are  signs  of \nimprovement  along  with  the  progress  of  BWDB  reforms.  On  the  other  hand,  small-scale \ninterventions  executed  by  LGED  has  been  more  satisfactory,  having  developed  an  increasing \nnumber of well-performing schemes with sound WMA management.  \n\nimprovement \n\n                                                 \n3  Including  (i)  institutional  development,  (ii)  enabling  framework,  (iii)  main  river  development,  (iv)  towns  and  rural \nareas,  (v)  major  cities,  (vi)  disaster  management,  (vii)  agriculture  and  water  management,  and  (viii)  natural \nenvironment and aquatic resources.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\nADB has played an important role in promoting the recent sector reforms, in cooperation \n6. \nwith other development partners. Specifically, ADB\u2019s assistance for small-scale water resources \ndevelopment encouraged the Government to decentralize such schemes to local governments \nand WMAs, which step was adopted as a key principle of the NWP. The WMA legal framework \nwas  established  through  an  amendment  of  the  Cooperatives  Act.  Its  procedures  and \narrangements  were  also  used  as  a  model  followed  in  the  GPWM.  The  ongoing  assistance  for \nmitigating  river  erosion  also  aims  to  establish  a  leading  model  to  apply  key  NWP  principles, \nincluding cost recovery in irrigation O&M, and a transparent and accountable joint management \nframework  among  BWDB,  local  governments,  and  WMAs.  The  impacts  of  ADB  investments \nhave  also  been  positive,  resulting  in  increased  agricultural  production  and  livelihood  security \nfrom natural disasters such as floods, although they were less than anticipated at appraisal in \ngeneral  and  call  for  more  effective  integration  with  other  essential  support  services  such  as \nagriculture and fisheries extension. Environmental impacts were evaluated as either benign or \npositive, but the early projects that substantially altered floodplain regimes had negative impacts \non open water fisheries despite large agricultural benefits and livelihood security.  \n \n The  World  Bank  has  provided  27  loans  amounting  to  about  $1.045  billion.  Recent \n7. \nassistance  focused  on  the  preparation  of  the  draft  NWMP,  rehabilitation  of  medium-  to  large-\nscale  coastal  embankments  and  of  inland  FCD/I  schemes,  and  riverbank  protection  along  the \nright bank of the Jamuna River. Significant emphasis has been placed on policy dialogues for \npreparing the NWP, and reforms in the organizational structure of BWDB. The World Bank is in \nthe final process of approving the Water Management Improvement Project (WMIP), which aims \nto assist further institutional reforms of WARPO and BWDB with capacity development, and to \nimprove the existing medium- to large-scale FCD/I schemes while establishing WMAs that will \ntake over the O&M of smaller facilities from BWDB, though a sector project modality.  \n \n8. \nThe Government of the Netherlands has also been a major development partner in the \nsector  since  1975.  Recent  efforts  have  substantially  increased  emphasis  on  policy  and \ninstitutional  development  while  supporting  three  strategic  subsectors:  (i)  socioeconomic  and \nenvironmental  restoration  of  the  Ganges-dependent  area,  (ii)  integrated  coastal  zone  planning \nand management, and (iii) small-scale water resources development in partnership with ADB. A \nmajor  contribution  being  provided  is  to  jointly  develop  and  implement  a  5-year  action  plan  to \nfurther  BWDB  reforms  in  seven  key  agendas,  through  a  twinning  arrangement  with  the \nconcerned  ministry  in  The  Hague.  The  action  plans  have  provided  a  common  and  practical \nframework  to  improve  the  organizational  management  of  BWDB,  and  are  now  pursued  in  all \nongoing  and  planned  assistance  by  external  funding  agencies.  The  Government  of  the \nNetherlands  is  also  to  provide  cofinancing  to  WMIP  and  the  proposed  Project,  and  is  also \npromoting  further  expansion  of  the  action  plan  to  install  sound  planning,  prioritization,  and \nmanagement systems beyond which a sectorwide program approach of support is envisaged.   \n \nD. \n \n9. \nOver the last 5 years, Bangladesh has put in place a sound NWP, prepared a draft 25-\nyear NWMP, and initiated organizational reforms of the key sector institutions. The country has \nthus  entered  into  a  phase  of  consolidating  the  reform  efforts  to  effectively  institutionalize  \nimproved policy, planning, and institutional frameworks into sound sector operations.  \n \n10. \nUnder the circumstance, ADB\u2019s sector strategy is to support the Government\u2019s efforts in \nthat  direction.  Specifically,  ADB  will  support  further  development  of  sound  policies  and \ninstitutional  framework,  and  the  capacities  and  management  systems  the  sector  institutions  to \nimplement  the  framework.  The  aim  will  be  to  implement  integrated  water  resources  planning \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nand  management,  and  sustainable  service  delivery,  with  decentralization  and  stakeholder \nparticipation and empowerment including O&M contribution. Emphasis will also be on strategic \nplanning  and  coordinated  delivery  of  essential  services  (such  as  agriculture  and  fishery \nextension)  to  ensure  the  intended  benefits,  and  addressing  the  concerns  of  the  poor  in  water \nsector interventions. Support for critical investments is provided following the NWMP priorities, \nand  demonstrated  progress  of  essential  reform  actions  and  their  operations.  During  this \nprocess,  particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  strengthen  partnership  among  the  Government, \nexternal  funding  agencies,  and  the  private  sector  including  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs)  and  stakeholders.  More  specific  agendas  and  the  strategy  of  ADB\u2019s  water  sector \nassistance are as follows.  \n\n \n\n1. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Reform  \n\n11. \nPolicy and institutional reform, and its full implementation are the major focus of ADB\u2019s \nsupport  for  the  water  resources  sector.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  the  reform  process  is  given  in  a \nprogressive manner based on agreed-on goals, and with emphasis on national ownership of the \nreform process. Issues to be pursued include the following: \n\nImproving the policy, planning, and legal framework. While the NWP and NWMP \nprovide  an  effective  framework  for  IWRM  and  sustainable  service  delivery, \nprogressive  improvements  are  needed,  with  regular  sector  operational  review. \nLikewise,  a  comprehensive  national  water  act  is  awaited,  in  which  appropriate \nregulatory institutions for managing water quantity and quality should be defined.  \nFostering  IWRM  and  water  conservation.  Issues  include  (a)  establishing  an \ninstitutional  framework  for  IWRM  including  integrated  planning,  water  quantity  and \nquality management including affluent disposal standards, and floodplain zoning; and \n(b) improving guidelines such as GPWM and those for environmental examination. \nImproving  service  delivery  and  sustaining  O&M.  Issues  include  (a)  operating \ninstitutional  mechanisms  for  management  transfer  and  local  O&M  financing;  (b) \ndefining effective roles of local governments in this context; (c) further developing an \nappropriate  WMA  institutional  modality,  including  a  legal  framework;  and  (d) \nimproving budgetary management mechanisms for sound O&M performance. \ntransparency  and \ninclude \nImproving  governance. \naccountability  in  agency  operations;  (b)  strengthening  anticorruption  efforts  with \nenhanced  internal  and  external  quality  control  for  infrastructure  and  other  services; \nand (c) improving the regulatory framework of WMA management to provide annual \nsocial, technical, and financial audit.     \n\n(a)  enhancing \n\nIssues \n\n2. \n\nInvestments \n\n12. \n\nInvestments in software and hardware will be guided by the following considerations. \n\nIntegrated  water  resources  planning  and  management. Following the NWP and \nthe NWMP, support will be provided for integrated water resources planning at local \nlevels  and  priority  investments  identified,  with  necessary  measures  to  ensure  their \nsustainable O&M, and focus to meet the needs of the poor and the vulnerable.4  \nSmall-scale  water  resources  development.  Support  for  further  consolidation  of \nsmall-scale  interventions  will  be  prioritized,  with  added  attention  to  their  strategic \nimplementation  following  subregional  plans,  and  delegation  of  increasing  power  of \nproject operations to local governments, with further reorganization of LGED. \n\n                                                 \n4  In  this  context,  assistance  for  rural  mitigation  of  arsenic  in  groundwater  is  also  considered,  to  promote  the \n\nidentification and adoption of water supply options. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29 \n\n(iii) \n\nImprovement and management transfer of BWDB\u2019s FCD/I schemes. This thrust \nis  supported  building  on  the  lessons  in  small-scale  schemes,  and  strengthening \nWMA for sustainable O&M. Support for irrigation schemes is contingent on the sound \nprogress of O&M cost recovery in ongoing projects. \n\nE. \n\nImplications for the Present Project Design \u2013 Implementing Policy Framework with \nCapacity Strengthening \n\nFollowing  the  sector  strategy,  the  proposed  Project  is  designed  to  meet  the  critical \n13. \ninvestment  thrusts  in  selected  subregions  in  the  southwest  area  by  building  on  and  furthering \nthe policy and institutional reforms (specific actions are in Appendix 5). Despite the progressive \ndevelopment  of  the  policy  and  institutional  framework  in  recent  years,  however,  there  is  still  a \nwide  gap  between  the  framework  and  individual  sector  agency  operations,  calling  for  careful \ncapacity strengthening support to address the critical weaknesses as pointed out in paragraph \n2, viz., agency capacities to implement the improved framework are still at the early stages of \ndevelopment. Accordingly, the following specific measures are pursued under the Project\u2013with \nintensive support by the consultants\u2013to institutionalize them within BWDB: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nParticipatory and coordinated planning and implementation. In each scheme, a \njoint management committee (JMC) will be formed with the assigned staff of BWDB, \nline departments, LGIs, and WMAs. At the outset, an integrated water management \nplan  (IWMP)  and  individual  subunit  implementation  plans  (SIPs),  prepared  with \nconsultant support, will set out clear program schedules, institutional responsibilities, \nand  output  targets.5 Those  plans  and  their  periodic  work  plans  will  be  endorsed  by \nJMC and its SIP subcommittees, particularly the concerned WMAs, based on which \nspecific  programs  will  be  delivered  through  the  designated  agencies  following  the \nIWMP and SIPs. \nWMA  strengthening  and  sustainable  O&M.  To  address  critical  managerial  and \nresource constraints in BWDB, WMAs will be formed and strengthened by engaging \nlocal  community  organizers  and  NGOs  trained  through  the  consultants.  To  ensure \nsufficient  WMA  development  and  attention  by  agency  staff,  WMAs  will  have  to \nachieve  specific  institutional  development  targets  as  set  out  in  the  SIPs  at \npreconstruction  stage,  including  enrollment  by  over  70%  of  beneficiary  farmers,  full \nachievement of financial contribution to establish an O&M reserve fund, and genuine \norganizational  management.  WMAs  will  be  trained  in  system  operation,  and \nmonitoring,  planning,  and \nfund \nreplenishment.  Sustainability  of  scheme-level  O&M  will  be  attained  through  generic \npolicy  and  operational  measures  which  are  being  pursued  with  other  externally \nassisted programs and to be operated nationwide.  \nMonitoring  and  quality  control.  The  subproject  management  office  (SMO)  will \nregularly  hold  progress  review  meetings  with  the  JMC  and  its  subcommittees  with \nthe  participation  of  the  concerned  WMAs,  which  are  designated  to  monitor  and \nconfirm the quality of the delivered services. For quality control purposes, the SMO \nwill duely record and report on subproject progress that is monitored and audited by \nthe project management office, in the light of the IWMPs and SIPs that specify clear \ninput,  process,  and  output  indicators  and  targets.  Along  with  these,  an  external \nperformance  and  technical  audit  will  be  undertaken  through  the  Office  of  the \nComptroller and Auditor General. \n\nimplementing  maintenance  works  with  O&M \n\n                                                 \n5   A generic memorandum of understanding will also be established between BWDB and line departments to specify \n\nthe collaboration sought from the latter and specific resources provided through BWDB.   \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nFunding\nSource\n\nADB\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO RURAL WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT \n(after 1995)a \n\nProject Title\n\nAmount ($million)\nGrant \n\nLoan\n\nYear\n\nSouthwest Area Water Resources Management Study b\nSouthwest Area Water Resources Development c\nSmall-scale Water Resources Development Sector\nCommand Area Development\nFlood Damage Rehabilitation d\nSouthwest Flood Damage Rehabilitation d\nSecond Small-scale Water Resources Development Sector\nJamuna-Meghna River Erosion Mitigation\nEmergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation d\n\nCanada\n\nDenmark\n\nGermany\n\nJapan\n\nNetherlands\n\nKalni-Kushiyara Community Development\nModernization of BWDB's Accounting Phase II\nDampara Water Management\nModernization of MOWR Financial Management\nEnvironmental Monitoring Information Network\n\nFlood Forecasting and Warning\n\nRiverbank Protection and Training Phase II\n\nNarayanganj Narsingdi FCDI Phase III Study\n\nSmall-scale Water Resources Development Sector\nMeghna Estuary Study\nEnvironmental GIS Support Phase II\nGorai River Restoration\nChar Development and Settlement Support Phase II\nSecond Small-scale Water Resources Development Sector\nIntegrated Coastal Zone Management Program\nIntegrated Planning for Sustainable Water Management\nWater Management Improvement e\n\nUnited Kingdom Integrated Coastal Zone Management Program\n\nWorld Bank\n\nRiverbank Protection\nCoastal Embankment Rehabilitation\nGorai River Restoration\nCoastal Embankments (supplementary)\nRiverbank Protection (supplementary)\nWater Management Improvement e\n\n3.8\n0.3\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n1.8\n1.7\n2.9\n2.2\n3.7\n\n3.2\n\n0.3\n\n6.8\n7.5\n7.6\n45.0\n9.0\n24.3\n1.9\n34.6\n20.0\n\n1.9\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n3.2\n32.0\n30.0\n20.0\n13.2\n34.0\n42.2\n31.8\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\n121.9\n53.0\n3.0\n16.5\n45.0\n81.5\n\n1991\n1993\n1995\n1995\n1998\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2005\n\n1997\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2003\n\n2000\n\n2003\n\n1998\n\n1996\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1998\n2001\n2001\n2003\n2005\n\n2001\n\n1996\n1996\n1998\n1999\n1999\n2005\n\n\u2013 = not available, ADB = Asian Development Bank, BWDB = Bangladesh Water Development Board; FCDI = flood \ncontrol, drainage and irrigation; GIS = geographic information system; MOWR = Ministry of Water Resources.\na\n\nExcept for those relevant to the present Project.\n\nRegional study under the flood action plan.\nA technical assistance loan that undertook feasibility studies of seven flood control and drainage/irrigation schemes \nincluding Chenchuri Beel and Narail subprojects.

This should be \nconfirmed at the planning stage with concrete scope of \nsupport activities and required resources. (SSWR) \n\n-- MOU between agencies will be signed upon Project start. It \n\nwill also ensure joint preparation of IWMPs and SIPs \nstipulating specific activities, schedule, and institutional \nresponsibilities, to culminate into the IA.   \n\n(ii)  DAE and DOF \n\n-- Despite technical capacity, DAE and DOF staff skills in \ndissemination remain insufficient, and staff may not be \nreadily available. (SSWR, SWAI)  \n\n \n-- The Project will form extension groups within WMAs. It will \nalso use qualified local NGOs and private providers as \nnecessary, with capacity development support. \n\n-- The involvement of LGI representatives remains minimal \ndespite their capacity and role to mobilize beneficiaries, \nand needs to be enhanced. (SWAI) \n\n(iii)  LGIs \n\n(iv)  WMAs \n\n-- It is possible to form viable WMAs, but this requires \n\nengaging key beneficiaries (e.g., large farmers), local \nleaders, as well as those representing diverse interests, \nwith due external monitoring.

Sufficient monitoring and auditing are \nessential for construction quality assurance. (BWSR)  \n\ndisclosure (including expenditures); (b) stringent recording \nand reporting by SMO staff; (c) construction monitoring by \nWMAs; and (d) internal and external technical auditing.  \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nLessons Learned from ADB-Assisted Projects \n\nIncorporation of Lessons Learned  \n\n(v)  Agriculture, Fishery, and Livelihood Development \n-- A concerted effort is needed to improve productivity \n\nthrough a comprehensive package of agriculture support \nincluding extension, inputs, and marketing based on \ncareful analysis of local conditions. (SWAI)  \n\n \n-- Required support services and arrangements for their \nprovision will be elaborated in the SIP, agreed to by \nconcerned parties, and duly provided. WMAs will be trained \nto undertake in-house extension activities.  \n\n-- The Project should fully utilize opportunities for poverty \nreduction (SSWR, NEMP) including leasing of public \nwater body and embankment lands. (BWSR, SWAI) \n\n \n\n-- This has been incorporated as key activities of the \n\nlivelihood enhancement subcomponent.  \n\n(vi)  Sustainable O&M \n\n-- WMA commitment, ability, and leadership are essential \nfor effective O&M. Its requirements and responsibilities \nshould be clearly agreed upon during appraisal (CAPE), \nwith up-front cash contribution (SSWR).  \n\n \n-- WMA responsibilities for jointly managed as well as \n\ntransferred facilities are reflected in the project design, and \nagreed on with individual WMAs at preconstruction stage \nwith cash contribution.   \n\n-- WMAs should be sufficiently trained for annual O&M with \npreparation and implementation of O&M plans (SSWR, \nSWAI), with comprehensive on-the-job training, and \nsufficient commissioning period (IISP).  \n\n-- A specific subcomponent has been included to ensure this \n\nin individual WMAs before subunit implementation is \ncompleted, by setting out specific indicators in the project-\nspecific MIS for O&M and confirming target achievements.  \n\n-- Supervision of WMAs with annual technical, social, and \n\n-- This will be operated through DOC\u2019s annual audit \n\nfinancial audit with necessary support should be provided \nwith sufficient resources (SSWR).  \n\ncomplemented by performance monitoring by SMOs, for \nwhich the consultants will provide training.   \n\nD.  Overall Project Management \n\n-- GPWM provides effective arrangements for participatory \n\nscheme development and management. Effective \ncompliance at the field level should be ensured (SSWR).  \n-- The number of subprojects under implementation should \n\nbe carefully managed in light of available human \nresources and capacities of the project agency. (SSWR)  \n\n \n-- IWMP/SIP will set out specific targets for each stage of \n\nimplementation cycle, which are monitored through regular \nSMO-WMA meetings and confirmed by PMO.  \n\n -- The number of subunits in each SMO will be limited \nconsidering capacities, performance, and resources. \nOutsourcing will also be arranged.  \n\nE.  Other Supporting Organizations \n(i)  NGOs and CBOs \n\n-- NGOs need to be duly trained to effectively support WMA \ndevelopment (SSWR). They may hire CBOs instead of \nmobilizing their staff, and develop CBO capacity to \nprovide permanent WMA support. (SSWR, IISP)  \n\n  \n \n-- NGOs and CBOs engaged will be duly trained by the \n\nconsultants for WMA formation. Experienced NGO staff will \nalso be fielded in SMOs to support agriculture, fishery, and \nlivelihood support activities.       \n\n (ii)  Private Sector Firms and Contractors \n\n-- Private sector firms have capacity to undertake feasibility \nstudies, with due support for socioeconomic analysis and \nagriculture and fishery programming (SSWR).    \n\n \n-- Preparation of SIPs will in principle be outsourced to private \nsector firms, with technical inputs provided by SMO and line \ndepartment staff and guidance by the consultants.  \n\n-- Duly selected contractors have sufficient capacities, but \n\n-- (Please see C (iv) for arrangements to ensure quality of \n\neffective monitoring is needed to ensure quality. (SSWR)  \n\nconstruction.) \n\n(iii)  Consultants for Capacity Development \n\n-- Careful design is needed to institutionalize the \n\nparticipatory project processes within the EA in lieu of \nmanaging the project on behalf of the EA, with careful \nmonitoring. (SSWR, IISP) \n\n \n-- The consultants will focus on on-the-job training of EA staff \nto manage the process of achieving the predefined targets \nat each step of the subproject/subunit cycle through their \nown staff and outsourcing arrangements.  \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, BWDB = Bangladesh Water Development Board, CBO = community-based organizer, \nDAE = Department of Agriculture Extension, DOC = Department of Cooperatives, DOF = Department of Fisheries, EA = \nexecuting agency, IA = implementation agreement, IWMP = integrated water management plan, LGI = local government \ninstitution,  MIS  =  management  information  system,  MOU  =  memorandum  of  understanding,  NGO  =  nongovernment \norganization, NWP = National Water Policy, O&M = operation and maintenance, PMO = project management office, SMO \n= subproject management office; SIP= subunit implementation plan, WMA = water management association. \n\nSources:  BWSR  =  ADB.  2004.

Possible schemes are listed in Supplementary Appendix \nC,  and  will  be  reviewed  more  rigorously  before  selecting  suitable  areas  for  further  study.  The \nfollowing criteria will be used in the screening and selection process.   \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe selected schemes should not contain a significant proportion of new works and \nshould fundamentally consist of rehabilitation/upgrading of existing infrastructure and \nadditional works to address a number of internal water management problems.  \n\nA scheme that requires minimal and straightforward rehabilitation and improvement \nworks, higher prospects of expanding irrigated areas, and higher economic return will \nbe given preference. In this context, schemes having problems associated with major \nriverbank erosion and/or with drainage congestion of outer channels will be avoided.  \n\nThe scheme\u2019s net benefited areas should not be greater than 14,000 hectares (ha). \n\nAs  an  initial  economic  assessment  (in  the  absence  of  detailed  information),  the \nscheme\u2019s estimated cost should not be in excess of $400/ha of the benefited area.  \n\nBased on available statistics, the existing poverty level within the scheme should be \nabove the present national average figure.  \n\nBeneficiaries\u2019  willingness  to  form  water  management  associations  (WMAs)  and \nassume designated operation and maintenance (O&M) responsibilities is confirmed, \nand  is  demonstrated  by  enrollment  of  over  70%  of  the  beneficiaries  and  up-front \ncash  contribution  to  the  civil  works  cost  equivalent  to  annual  O&M  cost  (1.5%  of \nstructures and 3% of earthworks for the facilities to be fully managed by the WMA). \n\nElaborate  IWMP  is  prepared  through  a  consultative  approach  stipulating  specific \nprogram  and  output \ninstitutional  development, \ninfrastructure,  agriculture  and  fishery  development,  livelihood  enhancement,  and \nscheme O&M, and arrangements for their implementation including coordination and \ndemarcation of works between the Bangladesh Water Development Board and Local \nGovernment Engineering Department.   \n\ntargets  encompassing  WMA \n\n(viii)  The subproject must be technically feasible, financially and economically viable with \nan economic internal rate of return of over 14%, based on the detailed economic and \nfinancial  analyses  undertaken  following  the  sample  subproject  analysis.  The \nsubproject must also be robust under sensitivity and risk analysis. \n\n(ix)  Works required will not cause any significant adverse environmental or social impact. \nAdequate  environmental  mitigating  measures  must  be  incorporated  into  the \nsubproject  design.  Following  the  relevant  policy  of  the  Government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental \nimpact  assessment  as  applicable  will  be  prepared  and  cleared  by  the  Government \nand ADB.  \n\n(x) \n\nThe  subproject  will  have  no  or  minimal  land  acquisition  and/or  involuntary \nresettlement impact. In the event that land acquisition is required, resettlement plans \nwill be prepared and implemented following the resettlement framework and sample \nresettlement plans (Appendix 16). \n\n \n\n\f

From  the  lessons  of \nsmall-scale  water  resources  development  sector  projects  assisted  by  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB), the ISPMS consultants will have a clear exit strategy and emphasize creating, as \ntheir distinct output target, a pool of highly qualified engineering and nonengineering staff who \ncan  manage  the  process  with  progressively  reduced  external  consultancy  inputs.  Specific \nperformance  targets  for  individual  staff  positions  will  be  established  and  closely  monitored \nduring the implementation process. At the same time the consultants will support relevant policy \nand institutional actions to provide an enabling sector environment. While the project agencies \ngenerally have technical capacities to design and construct water management structures, the \nnew mandates of the national water policy (NWP) generally call for changes in the management \nsystem and behavior of the agencies, from traditional implementer to genuine service-oriented \nfacilitators. Such changes call for long-term support. \n \nB. \n\nScope \n\nThe  task  of  the  ISPMS  consultants  include  support  for  (i)  preparing  a  participatory \n2. \nintegrated  water  management  plan  (IWMP)  of  further  selected  flood  control,  drainage  and \nirrigation (FCD/I) schemes; (ii) strengthening WMAs and joint management committees (JMCs) \nas  viable  institutions  to  sustain  and  enhance  project  benefits;  (iii)  operating  an  integrated \napproach  of  water  management  to  meet  diverse  stakeholder  concerns;  (iv)  coordinating  the \ndelivery  of  structures  and  services  responding  to  specific  local  needs;  (v)  developing  and \nregularly improving procedures and arrangements for a scheme management cycle from IWMP \nformulation  to  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M);  (vi)  devising  and  operating \neffective  management  systems  for  monitoring  and  quality  control  of  the  process  and  outputs; \n(vii) identifying and advising on specific policy, institutional, legal and regulatory actions required \nby the concerned agencies to operate the above functions (Appendix 5); (viii) strengthening the \ncapacity of BWDB, WARPO, and other implementing agencies to meet their new roles with on-\nthe-job  support;  and  (ix)  providing  project  management  support  with  monitoring  and  quality \ncontrol.  Activities  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  the  policy  and  institutional  support  provided \nthrough the Water Management Improvement Project (WMIP) assisted by the World Bank and \nthe  Government  of  the  Netherlands  and  the  twinning  missions  supported  by  the  latter \nGovernment, among other programs. \n \n3. \nOver  the  7-year  project  implementation  period,  the  ISPMS  consulting  services  are \nestimated  to  total  72  person-months  of  international  and  532  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting  services,  costing  about  of  $4.0  million  comprising  $0.7  million  for  preparing  the \nIWMPs and $3.3 million for capacity strengthening and management of their implementation.  \n \n4. \nISPMS consultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants  through  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures.  In  consideration  of  the \nnonengineering complexity and the need for early mobilization, the Government requested ADB \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n45 \n\nto select the consultants.

While  both  schemes  have  a  marketable  surplus  of  most  crops, \nproductivity is low compared with their potentials due to the degraded main infrastructures and \nlack of minor control facilities to address localized water management problems. In the analysis, \nbeneficial  impacts  of  improved  flood  control  and  drainage/irrigation  (FCD/I)  works  and \nnonengineering  support  (including  that  for  agriculture  and  fishery  extension  and  capacity \nstrengthening)  are  weighed  against  the  capital  and  O&M  costs.  Infrastructure  improvements \ninclude  work  on  embankments,  regulators  and  other  water  control  structures,  reexcavation  of \nsilted canals, and upgrading of embankment roads. This analysis can be seen as representative \nfor  the  remaining  subprojects,  or  43,000  ha  of  FCD/I  areas  to  be  selected  during  the  project \nimplementation period.  \n \nB. \n \nTo  determine  the  expected  direct  benefits  of  the  subprojects  in  question,  quantifiable \n2. \neffects  are  valued  by  comparing  \u201cpresent\u201d,  \u201cfuture  without  project\u201d  and  \u201cfuture  with  project\u201d \nscenarios.2 The  input-output  coefficient  of  farm  production,  including  cropping  patterns,  crop \nyields,  fertilizer  usage, and  labor  costs,  was  estimated  based  on  data  from  the  Department  of \nAgriculture  Extension  and  farm-level  surveys  during  the  project  preparatory  stage,  and  cross- \nchecked  with  data  reported  in  similar  projects  in  Bangladesh.  The  subprojects  analyzed  were \nassumed to have an economic life of 30 years, and to achieve the full benefits in the third year \nafter  completion.  The  analysis  uses  a  world  price  numeraire,  and  economic  prices  for  traded \ninputs  and  commodities  (rice,  wheat,  sugarcane,  jute,  and  fertilizer)  were  based  on  the  World \nBank  Commodity  Price  Projections.  The  prices  of  other  crops  and  farm  inputs  were  based  on \nmarket prices in the subproject areas in August 2004. A standard conversion factor of 0.90, and \na shadow wage rate of 0.85 for agriculture labor and 0.84 for construction labor were used.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nCosts.  The investment costs were estimated based on the basic design data, whereas \nO&M costs were based on field data and the concerned department guidelines. Total financial \ncosts of the Chenchuri Beel and Narail subprojects amount to Tk618 million ($10.0 million) and \nTk617 million ($10.0 million), respectively, whereas annual O&M costs amount to Tk16.5 million \nin Chenchuri Beel and Tk12.4 million in Narail.  \n \n4. \nBenefits  \u2013  Increased  Crop  Production. Crop production is expected to increase as a \nresult  of  improved  water  management  within  the  FCD/I  systems,  because  of  (i)  change  in \ncropping intensity and pattern in response to improved flood protection, drainage, and irrigation; \nand (ii) increased yields. At present, about 60%, 75%, and 55% of net cultivated area (NCA) in \n\nEstimated Costs and Benefits \n\n                                                 \n1   The two subprojects were built in the early 1980s with the support of the World Bank and the Government of the \nNetherlands, and have been functional  without major damage or further external assistance. Chenchuri Beel and \nNarail subprojects cover about 25,000 hectares (ha) and 32,000 ha of gross area, respectively, and 17,900 ha and \n23,400 ha of net cultivated area, respectively.  \n\n2   The \u201cfuture without Project\u201d case was differentiated from \u201cpresent\u201d case in production pattern, to take into account \n\nthe ongoing expansion in private tubewell irrigation and related cropping pattern changes. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n49 \n\nthe two subproject areas is cropped in the monsoon, winter, and spring seasons, respectively. \nPaddy  is  most  dominant  across  the  year,  yet  some  30%  of  cultivated  land  is  cropped  with \nnoncereals  during  the  dry  season.  The  Project  will  reduce  the  monsoon  flood  risk,  inducing \nfarmers  to  intensify  paddy  production  from  broadcast  to  transplanted  high  yielding  variety \nanticipated  in  about  10%  of  NCA  where  the  broadcast  variety  is  currently  planted).  Improved \ndrainage  conditions  will  allow  timely  cultivation  of  winter  crops,  thereby  increasing  cropping \nintensity and diversity. Increased access to irrigation water retention with  control structures and \ncanal  reexcavation  will  also  expand  cropping  intensity/diversity,  particularly  that  of  high-yield \nvarieties  of  winter  paddy  (by  about  10%  of  NCA)  and  some  other  high-value  crops  (by  some \n1.5%  from  9\u201310%  of  NCA  without  the  Project).  Overall,  cropping  intensity  is  anticipated  to \nincrease by 15% and reach 220% compared with the without-Project condition. Crop yields are \nalso  expected  to  increase  because  of  more  reliable  flood  protection  and  irrigation  that  will \ninduce farmers to increase the use of modern inputs, with extension support provided under the \nProject.3 As a result, production of food grains and that of other edible crops (except for jute and \nsugarcane)  are  expected  to  grow  from  178,000  tons  (t)  and  112,000  t  without  the  Project  to \n218,000 t and 132,000 t, an increase of 22% and 18%, respectively.  \n\n5. \nReduction  in  Losses  due  to  Floods.  Flood  control  structures  (strengthening  of \nembankments and riverbank protection) will also reduce crop losses from flooding. To estimate \nvalue of the crop losses, data on the average crop damage over a 20-year period were used for \nthe  without-Project  situation.4 The  net  value  of  estimated  annual  crop  loss  is  Tk6.1  million  in \nChenchuri  Beel  and  Tk8.0  million  in  Narail,  whereas  no  loss  is  expected  under  the  level  of \nfloods observed during the same period under conditions with the Project. The Project will also \nreduce  flood  damage  to  public  and  private  assets.5 The  estimated  annual  reduction  in  such \ndamage is Tk1.5 million in Chenchuri Beel and Tk2.0 million in Narail subproject, respectively.   \n\n6. \nIncremental  Culture  Fisheries  Production. The Project will provide fishery extension \nservices to the concerned water management organizations in the subproject areas with a focus \non  the  poor,  covering  ponds  (about  200  ha),  canals  (50\u2013100  ha),  and  paddy-cum-fish  culture \n(200\u2013300  ha)  for  each  subproject.  Incremental  benefits  were  estimated  from  local  data  on \nproduction and input-output coefficients, and crosschecked with those brought about in similar \nprojects. 6  The  estimated  culture  fishery  annual  incremental  production  in  the  with-Project \nscenario  amounts  to  560  t  (valued  at  Tk10.2  million)  in  Chenchuri  Beel  subproject  and  660  t \n(valued at Tk11.6 million) in Narail subproject.  \n\n7. \nNonquantified  Benefits.  Apart  from  quantified  benefits,  the  Project  has  a  number  of \nnonquantified benefits, including (i) improved planning capacities for preparing integrated water \nmanagement plans; (ii) improved water management infrastructure and  related service delivery \nmechanisms  with \n(iii)  establishment  and \nempowerment  of  water  management  associations  (WMAs);  and  (iv)  improved  management \ninformation  system  for  hydrological  data,  water  user  coordination,  and  FCD/I  scheme \n\ntransparent  and  accountable  governance; \n\n                                                 \n3  While the Project aims to achieve the high potential yield levels for the concerned crops reported in local agriculture \nresearch  stations,  a  yield  increase  of  modest  level  was  assumed  for  aman  (9%)  and  boro  (6%)  only,  with  other \ncrops assumed to have the same yields except for locally minor potato and winter vegetables.    \n\n4  It  was  estimated  that  about  50%  of  the  crop  would  be  lost  in  the  affected  area,  with  the  same  amount  of  inputs \n\nexcept for 25% of the labor costs (corresponding to harvesting and threshing).  \n\n5  Given the unavailability of data, valuation of these losses was based on an average of 25% of annual crop losses, \n\nwhich corresponds to the estimates made in the flood action plan studies.  \n\n6  No  impact  was  assumed  for  capture  fisheries,  given  the  offsetting  impacts  of  obstruction  by  additional  structures \n\n(such as water retention) and increased water body associated with water retention and canal reexcavation.  \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nAssessment of Economic Returns \n\nperformance monitoring and planning. Benefits derived from strengthening the policy, planning, \nand institutional framework will have wider impacts at national and field levels.7  \n \nD. \n \n8. \nResults  of  the  economic  analysis  (Table  A13)  show  that  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn (EIRR) is 16.5% for Chenchuri Beel and 21.2% for Narail, and the net present value at a \ndiscount  rate  of  12%  is  Tk151  million  and  Tk295  million,  respectively.  Switching  values  were \nestimated for certain risks including benefit decrease, cost increase, decreases in crop prices, \nlife  of  the  project,  and  delayed  benefits.  Overall,  neither  subproject  is  strongly  susceptible  to \nmost of the risks examined. Reduction of the project life to 12.5 years in Chenchuri Beel and 11 \nyears in Narail  would still yield an EIRR of above 12%. For Chenchuri Beel, however, a fall in \nfood  grain  prices  could  threaten  economic  viability.  The  economic  returns  are  expected  to  be \nrobust.   \n\nAssessment of Financial Returns \n\nE. \n \n9. \nHousehold  Returns.  Farm budget analysis was conducted for typical farm households \nin the two subproject areas. Table A13 summarizes the gains in farm net income as a result of \nthe Project, including the farmer\u2019s share of the financial contribution to the Project, i.e., annual \nO&M  costs.  In  Chenchuri  Beel  and  Narail  subprojects,  there  are  about  39,800  and  45,600 \nhouseholds,  among  which  62%  and  56%  are  functionally  landless  (owning  less  than  0.3  ha),8 \n13%  and  12%  marginal  (0.3\u20130.8  ha),  13%  and  18%  small  (0.8\u20131.5  ha),  10%  and  11%  are \nmedium  (1.5\u20133.5  ha),  and  2%  and  3%  are  large  farmers  (3.5  ha  or  more).  All  households \nengaged in farming and/or agriculture labor will benefit from the Project, with an average annual \nincome  increase  of  Tk4,245  for  Chenchuri  Beel  and  Tk4,400  for  Narail,  representing  an \nincrease  of  18%  and  16%,  respectively,  compared  with  the  without-Project  conditions.  The \nincrease  for  functionally  landless  and  marginal  farmers  engaged  in  agriculture  amounts  to \nTk2,745 in Chenchuri Beel and Tk2,795 in Narail.    \n\n10. \nPoverty  Impacts.  The  socioeconomic  survey  done  in  2004  found  the  poor  57%  at \nChenchuri Beel and 56% at Narail, higher than the national average of 50% recorded in 2000. \nIncremental  financial  benefits  expected  to  accrue  to  the  poor  were  calculated  to  be  46%  in \nChenchuri  Beel  and  43%  in  Narail,  based  on  the  estimated  present  value  of  incremental \nhousehold  income  items  (crops,  prevented  flood  loss,  fishery,  and  labor  including  agriculture \nand  construction  labor) for  individual  household  categories and  their  poverty  head  count  ratio. \nPoor  people  will  particularly  benefit  from  increased  opportunities  for  family  and  hired  on-farm \nlabor,  as  well  as  construction  labor.  Annual  on-farm  labor  opportunities  are  anticipated  to \nincrease by 1.45 million days for the two sample subprojects, of which at least 0.44 million days \nwill  be  hired  almost  totally  from  landless  and  marginal  farmers,  with  an  estimated  incremental \nincome of about Tk600 per concerned household.  \n\n11. \nThe  Project  will  also  improve  food  security,  particularly  for  functionally  landless  and \nmarginal  farmers.  Among  functionally  landless  and  marginal  farmers,  an  average  household \nhaving  an  operational  size  of  0.23  ha  with  40%  of  sharecropped  land  will  increase  food  crop \nproduction from the present 120\u2013150 kilograms (kg) per capita to 160\u2013190kg after the Project, \nthereby  substantially  meeting  the  annual  food  requirements.  Once  food  security  is  addressed, \nfarmers will be ready to grow more profitable crops such as vegetables and spices.  \n\n                                                 \n7   Besides, benefits generated from embankment road improvement were not quantified due to data unavailability. \n8   About 20% of the total population are not engaged in farming or agriculture labor.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nF. \n\nSustainability \n\n12. \nThe  O&M  responsibility  of  subproject  infrastructure  rests  with  WMAs  for  local  facilities \nhaving an impact area of less than 2,500 ha, whereas other facilities are jointly managed by the \nGovernment  (Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board  [BWDB])  and  the  WMAs  (with  the  latter \nresponsible  only  for  minor  repair  works),  following  the  national  water  policy.  As  part  of  project \npreparation, the financial sustainability of subproject O&M was analyzed. The O&M costs to be \nborne  by  the  WMAs  and  BWDB  amount  to  Tk3.7  million  and  Tk12.9  million,  respectively,  in \nChenchuri Beel, and Tk5.3 million and Tk7.1 million, respectively, in Narail.  \n\n13.  WMA-Managed  Facilities.  About  50  WMAs  are  expected  to  be  formed  in  the  two \nsubproject  areas,  following  the  cooperatives  legal  framework.  These  WMAs  need  to  generate \nnecessary  funds  to  cover  the  O&M  costs  of  the  delegated  facilities  along  with  administrative \ncosts  to  play  its  water  management  functions.  The  annual  O&M  financial  requirement \ncorresponds  to  Tk205/ha  in  Chenchuri  Beel  and  Tk224  in  Narail,  or  4\u20138%  and  3\u20137%  of  the \nincremental  income  brought  about  by  the  Project  among  different  farmer  categories,  with  the \nlarger farmers bearing more (due to smaller per ha incremental income). While the WMAs may \nrequire a nominal administrative cost that could increase the farmer contribution (by 10\u201315%), \nthe required amount is deemed affordable to the concerned farmers, and is well within the range \npracticed  in  an  Asian  Development  Bank-assisted  project  to  support  small-scale  FCD/I \nschemes.9 The  same  project  experience  indicates  that  due  motivational  efforts  and  time  are \nneeded to encourage WMAs to undertake sufficient O&M. To support a smooth transition, the \nProject  will  establish  O&M  reserve  fund  through  up-front  beneficiary  contribution  of  fees \nequivalent  to  the  annual  O&M  requirement.  This  will  be  enhanced  through  further  collection \nduring implementation, and WMAs will be trained to establish a practice of sufficient O&M with \ndue fund replenishment.10  \n\n14. \nGovernment-Managed  Facilities.  BWDB does not have any revenue generated in the \ntwo subproject areas;11 thus, the total required amount of Tk20.0 million has to be borne mostly \nthrough  the  Government  budget.  While  the  nationwide  allocation  of  BWDB\u2019s  repair  budget \nremains  about  half  of  the  total  requirement,  the  Government  has  been  significantly  increasing \nthe  maintenance  budget  allocation  to  BWDB  by  some  15%  each  year  since  FY2004,  in \nrecognition of the need for full maintenance funding and of recent BWDB reforms such as staff \nrationalization (by over 50%), initiatives of infrastructure management transfer to WMAs, and for \nincreasing  irrigation  O&M  cost  recovery. 12  To  further  support  sustainable  O&M  of  BWDB \ninfrastructure, the Project will support, in conjunction with other externally assisted projects, the \nestablishment  and  nationwide  operation  of  a  management  information  system  for  O&M \nperformance  monitoring  and  planning,  covering  all  BWDB-managed  FCD/I  schemes.  On  the \nbasis of this, BWDB will introduce performance-based O&M budget management, under which \nthe  maintenance  fund  allocation  is  prioritized  to  schemes  having  better  performance,  in \nparticular  the  performance  of  local  WMAs  in  terms  of  sustaining  the  O&M  of  WMA-managed \nfacilities and cost recovery of irrigation operations. These measures are expected to lead to duly \nimproved  O&M  performance  of  BWDB-managed  facilities,  particularly  those  where  effective \nWMAs are established and operated under the Project and similar externally assisted projects.  \n                                                 \n9   Footnote 7 in the main text.

Poverty  is  predominantly  a  rural  phenomenon,  as \nmore than 85% of the poor live in rural areas. Given that over 85% of the poor live in rural areas and engage in agriculture and \nrelated nonfarm activities, enhancing agricultural and rural development is a key to reduce poverty in the country. For the rural \npoor,  access  to  and  control  of  water  are  fundamental  importance  as  water  is  the  foundation  for  many  livelihood  activities, \nincluding agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and water supply. \n \nLocated at the confluence of three major river systems that bring about massive monsoon floods (that inundate some 30% of \nthe land on average), drainage congestion, riverbank erosion, dry season  water scarcity, natural disasters such as cyclones, \nand  widespread  groundwater  arsenic  contamination  (that  is  affecting  some  30-50%  of  the  population),  access  to  water  and \ntheir  effective  management  are  fundamental  for  the  livelihood  of  the  rural  population.  In  Bangladesh  this  challenge  is  further \ncomplicated  by  diverse  and  complex  stakeholder  interests,  including  agriculture  (interests  varying  in  different  elevations), \nfisheries,  boat  transport,  industries,  and  drinking  water.  Water  is  also  vital  for  the  country\u2019s  rich  natural  biodiversity  and \necosystems.  Thus,  it  is  paramount  for  the  country  to  manage  water  resources  through  an  integrated,  participatory,  and \ndecentralized  approach  with  due  attention  to  water  security  for  the  poor.  Improving  water  resource  management  has  been \ngiven  high  priority  in  the  poverty  partnership  agreement  between  the  Government  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nThe national water policy and the draft national strategy for accelerated poverty reduction, or poverty reduction strategy paper \n(PRSP)  emphasize  programs  related  to  water  sector  development.  Flood  management,  irrigation,  drainage  control,  erosion \nprotection,  land  reclamation,  integrated  management  of  coastal  polders,  river  flow  augmentation,  sharing  of  water  from \ntransboundary rivers, and wet land conservation through the participation of stakeholders are considered important not only for \nhuman  beings  but  also  for  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  biodiversity.  The  PRSP  has  flagged  the  interface  between  water  and \npoverty so that required intervention is designed properly. \n \nThe  Project  will  contribute  to  increased  agricultural  production,  improve  food  security,  and  address  the  viability  of  poor  rural \npeople  through  effective  water  management.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  flood  control  and  drainage/irrigation  (FCD/I) \ninfrastructure, including embankments, regulators and retention structure, sluices, canal reexcavation and riverbank protection, \nwill  expand  the  irrigated  area,  and  improve  crop  yields  and  fisheries  production.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  improving  the \nrural  economy  by  enhancing  agricultural  production,  fisheries  development,  social  forestry  and  income-generating  activities. \nThe Project will help increase the household income of the landless and poor women. Furthermore, providing safe water supply \nto safeguard the people in the project area from arsenic poisoning will improve living conditions of the population with respect \nto health. \n\n \n \nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nB. \nPoverty Analysis  \nOverall Status and Causes  \nTo assess the expected socioeconomic impact of the Project socioeconomic analysis was carried out in two sample subproject \nareas, where over 85,400 households (0.4 million people) live. The majority of the farmers in the subproject areas are landless \npeople  and  marginal  farmers  (68-75%),  followed  by  small  farmers  (13-18%),  and  medium-sized  (10-11%)  and  large  (2-3%) \nholdings. Poverty incidence is 56-57%. Landless and marginal farmers live below the extreme poverty line and the majority of \nsmallholders fall below the moderate poverty line. Poverty in the subproject areas is reflected in low standards of living, poor \nhealth,  lack  of  education,  abandonment  of  women  and  children,  and  vulnerability  of  most  households  to  floods.  The  basic \ncauses  of  poverty  are  lack  of  access  to  productive  resources  (mainly  water  and  land),  to  public  resources  such  as  health \nprovisions,  education,  and  transport  and  employment.  The  lack  of  social  protection  measures,  participatory  governance, \nentrepreneurship,  and  alternative  livelihood  opportunities  makes  marginal  farmers,  the  landless,  and  women  particularly \nvulnerable.  \n \nThe main problems in the two subproject areas, as represented by the landless and marginal farmers, are shortage of land and \nincome opportunities. The community expectations of the benefits and impacts of the Project are (i) increased agriculture and \nfish production, (ii) more opportunities for disadvantaged groups to become involved in farming and nonfarming activities, and \n(iii)  increased  income  opportunities.  All  women  interviewed  expected  to  benefit  from  the  Project  mainly  by  employment  and \nincome generation through improved postharvest work, livestock and fish production, farm and homestead production, cottage \nindustries, improved water supply and sanitation services, and access to credit.   \n \nAdditional data is required during implementation to identify specific needs and interests of the poor so that appropriate support \ncould be designed in terms of access to resources including skills, finance, and organizations.  \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nStakeholder Analysis  Prepared: Yes  \nA  participatory  process  was  used  during  the  project  preparatory  stage  and  discussions  were  carried  out  with  women, \nfishermen,  the  landless,  and  other  vulnerable  groups  in  the  two  subproject  areas  using  participatory  rapid  rural  appraisal \n(PRRA)  techniques.  An  inventory  of  local  needs  was  prepared,  encompassing  problems/constraints  related  to  (i)  water \nresources in relation to domestic agriculture, fisheries, transport, environment, and other uses; (ii) possible solutions to resolve \nthe  constraints  identified  including  their  positive  and  negative  impact  on  various  local  interest  groups;  (iii)  implications  of \nsolutions for poverty reduction; and (iv) prioritizing water resources needs compared with other development needs. The role of \nservice  providers,  people\u2019s  willingness  to  contribute  to  operations  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  the  scope  of  enhancing \nimpacts of  water interventions  with others such as microcredit, and extension services were also discussed. Nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs)  were engaged to facilitate this process. The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) identified \nthe future course of action and mechanisms to institutionalize community participation in the expected implementation areas. \n \nAgricultural  benefits  constitute  the  largest  part  of  the  total  project  benefits  and  are  likely  to  accrue  mainly  to  landowners. \nHowever, the project design ensures that the poor, including the landless, marginal farmers, and women, at least share equally \nin  the  distribution  of  the  income  growth  benefit  from  the  Project  through  increased  agricultural  production  and  employment \nopportunities.  \n \nThe poor will benefit from shared cropping and labor income as the land area will increase and the poor will be hired on a wage \nbasis  to  cover  the  increased  labor  needs  of  medium-sized  and  large  landholders.  In  addition,  labor  for  earthworks  and  other \nproject-related construction and maintenance work will be drawn from poor households, with preference for destitute women.  \n \nParticipatory Social Development Strategy Prepared:  Yes \nThe Project will continue to be driven by the needs and demands of the communities that recognize the importance of water \nresource management to protect and improve their livelihood activities. The Project will ensure a social development strategy \nthat  (i)  allocates  sufficient  time  and  resources  to  establish  viable  local  organizations  particularly  water  management \nassociations  (WMAs);  (ii)  provides  a  legal  status  for  these  organizations;  (iii)  promotes  partnership  among  Government \nagencies, local government, and civil society groups; and (iv) defines and puts into place a process and procedures to ensure \nmeaningful beneficiary participation in all stages of the Project. \n \nThe  social  development  strategy  will  include  the  following:    procedures  and  guidelines  for  selecting  beneficiaries  for  WMA \nmembership, employment, credit access; participation of  WMAs in designing, planning, implementing and monitoring the sub-\nproject  activities and  drafting  the WMA by-laws;  a comprehensive capacity-building plan highlighting training for project staff, \nWMAs,  and  village  groups;  guidelines  and  procedures  for  social  activities  such  as  poverty  reduction,  conflict  resolution,  anti-\ndowry drives, women repression and voting rights; procedures for networking and linkages among WMAs and service-providing \nagencies; and regular project-level coordination meetings with representatives of project staff, NGOs, and WMA members.  \n \nThe  strategy  will  also  establish  consultative  platforms  at  the  village  level  in  conjunction  with  the  district  administration,  local \ngovernment institution, and NGOs before appropriate interventions are designed for water infrastructure improvement, farming \nand  nonfarming  production,  and  income  generation.  NGOs  will  provide  leadership  and  confidence-building  training  for \norganizational  and  capacity  building  among  the  poor  and  women\u2019s  groups  in  preparation  for  developing  independent  WMAs \ncapable of managing and operating their FCD schemes. Furthermore, village facilitators will be selected and trained to provide \na  sustainable  mechanism  for  continued  community-based  management  and  development.  The  Project  will  establish \nprocedures for close coordination among district administration and NGOs for effective service delivery.   \n\n \n\nGender Development \n\n \nD. \nWomen  in  Bangladesh  remain  particularly  vulnerable  to  living  in  poverty.  Socially  prescribed  roles  have  limited  women\u2019s \naccess  to  economic  resources  such  as  capital,  skill  and  marketing  know-how.  These  same  social  norms  limit  women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  political  and  other  forms  of  decision  making  that  affect  their  lives.  The  restrictions  are  particularly  hard  to \novercome  for  women  who  head  households,  whether  as  widows  or  through  divorce  or  abandonment.  Women  workers  earn \nconsiderably less than male workers and there is persistent lower average calorie consumption for females, indicated by higher \nsevere  malnutrition,  mortality,  and  morbidity  rates  for  girls  and  women  than  for  males.  There  is,  however,  no  analysis  of \nhousehold economy that provides the link between the gender gaps identified and their causes. Differences in poverty levels \nbetween households headed by males and females highlight the difficulties  women face in benefiting from economic growth. \nThe average monthly income of female headed households in rural areas is approximately 35% lower than that of male headed \nhouseholds and is 33% less than in urban areas.1 This corroborates assumptions that female headed families have difficulties \naccessing both the assets required for adequate income and benefiting from services, or other programs that generally target \nmale household heads. \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n55 \n\nWomen are important producers of homestead crops and livestock, and their postharvest activities contribute over 50% of the \nvalue of crop produce (footnote 1). The division of labor is prescribed by social norms that by tradition limit women to remaining \nin seclusion in the immediate household area. Women therefore do not take produce to market or interact in public with men. \nThese restrictions on women\u2019s mobility also limit their capacity to control the proceeds from their labor or to access extension \nservices, especially when male officers deliver services. Women also have little or no access to land other than through their \nrelationship with male family members. \n \nA  gender  action  plan  (GAP)  has  been  developed  to  ensure  that  gender  concerns  are  addressed  and  dealt  with  in  the  most \neffective and efficient manner. The Project will give specific attention to employment of female staff at all levels and train field \nstaff in gender-sensitive and participatory planning and project implementation. Furthermore the GAP will ensure employment \nopportunities generated by the Project and O&M works; train women to be involved in WMAs and all aspects of O&M; support \nwomen's  work  in  farm  and  homestead  production;  strengthen  the  extension  system  to  be  gender-equitable  to  ensure  its \neffectiveness;  identify  and  respond  to  women's  agricultural  and  household  needs  for  technology  in  close  collaboration  with \nimplementing  agencies  and  NGOs;  support  women  in  their  home-based  postharvest  production  and  marketing  activities  by \nproviding  local  market  information  and  linkages,  improving  transportation  and  storage  facilities,  improving  processing  and \npackaging techniques, enhancing credit facilities; provide women with training in crop and horticulture production, postharvest \noperations, poultry and small livestock rearing, social forestry; and fisheries production and processing, credit, seed production, \nnutrition  education;  and  identify  gender-specific  monitoring  indicators.  One  gender  specialist  will  be  posted  in  the  project \nmanagement office to further develop and implement the GAP for the Project, and to  supervise four social development and \ngender specialists engaged through NGOs who will be posted at each subproject management office to implement and monitor \nthe GAP. \n \nGender Action Prepared: Yes \nRefer to the GAP in Appendix 15. \n \n\nSocial Safeguards and other Social Risks2 \n\nE. \n\n  \nItem \n\nResettlement5 \n  \n\nSignificant/ \nNon \nSignificant/ \nNone3 \nSignificant \n\n \n\n \n\n \nPlan \nRequired4  \n\nFull \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nA  resettlement  framework  and  sample  resettlement  plans  have  been \nprepared,  following  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  and  other  social \nsafeguards  policies.

The resettlement framework (RF) outlines the policy, procedures, \n1. \nand institutional requirements for preparing and implementing resettlement plans (RPs) for the \ntwo  sample  subprojects  as  well  as  for  future  subprojects  selected  under  the  Southwest  Area \nIntegrated  Water  Resources  Planning  and  Management  Project.  The  Project  includes \nrehabilitation  and  improvement  of  existing  flood  control  and  drainage/irrigation  (FCD/I) \ninfrastructure, and involves resectioning, widening, and new construction of flood embankments; \nplacement  of  revetment  along  eroding  riverbanks;  reexcavation  of  canals;  and  installment  of \nwater  control  structures  including  regulators,  inlet/outlet  pipes  or  sluices  under  embankments, \nand  check  structures  within  canals,  for  which  the  concerned  land  strips  would  need  to  be \nacquired by the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB).  \n \n2.   \nResettlement  Policy.  Resettlement  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  policy \non  involuntary  resettlement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  following  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property  (ARIP)  Ordinance  1982  and \nEast Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act (1951, revised 1998).  \n \nResettlement  Principles,  Entitlements,  and  Procedures.  The  RF  applies  to  all \n3. \ninvoluntary  resettlement  effects\u2013including  displacement  of  nontitled  people\u2013arising  from  land \nacquisition  or  conversion,  or  any  other  effects  that  arise  from  the  project  works,  including  the \neffects on people with no title to the land. Those affected will be entitled to maintain at least their \nstandard  of  living  at  preproject  level,  and  to  receive  compensation  for  all  types  of  losses, \nincluding land, crops, trees, structures, and any other assets at full replacement value. Affected \nhouseholds will receive (i) an additional cash grant to match replacement value to supplement \nthe grant provided by the deputy commissioner, and (ii) other resettlement assistance such as \nshifting  allowances  and  compensation  for  loss  of  workdays  and  income  due  to  dislocation. \nHouseholds with female heads and other vulnerable households will be eligible for further cash \nassistance  for  relocation  and  house  reconstruction.  People  involuntary  displaced  will  receive \npriority  assistance  under  the  Project\u2019s  livelihood  enhancement  subcomponent.

The  project  management  office \n4. \n(PMO)\u2013under  the  responsibility  of  the  chief  resettlement  and  environmental  manager  with  the \nrank  of  senior  executive  engineer,  and  guidance  of  the  project  director\u2013has  overall  planning, \nfinancing,  and  supervisory  responsibility  for  preparing  and  implementing  the  RPs,  with  the \nsupport of the consultants, including capacity strengthening and monitoring. The specific works \nwill  be  carried  out  by  the  subproject  management  offices  (SMOs)  through  a  resettlement \ncoordinator with the rank of executive engineer or senior subdivisional engineer. The PMO will \nengage  experienced  non-government  organizations  (NGOs)  to  assist  the  process  with  the \nsupport  of  the  consultants.  For  future  subprojects,  the  concerned  SMO  will  undertake  social \nimpact  assessment  with  the  consultants  based  on  preliminary  technical  designs,  and  prepare \nfull  or  short  RPs  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  other  social \nsafeguard guidelines. The full and short RPs will be reviewed by BWDB and submitted to ADB \nfor approval. For all subprojects, RPs will be further developed upon completion of the detailed \ndesign,  and  must  also  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval.  APs  should  be  fully  compensated \nbefore award of the relevant civil works contracts. BWDB will ensure that resettlement budgets \nare delivered on time to the deputy commissioner\u2019s office and the implementing NGOs.   \n \n5. \nDisclosure,  Consultation,  and  Grievances.  Each  RP  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented  in  close  consultation  with  the  stakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group \ndiscussions and meetings with the APs, with disclosure of resettlement information in the form \nof  brochures  written  in  the  local  language.  Copies  of  the  RF  and  draft  RPs  will  be  distributed \namong NGOs and community groups prior to finalizing the engineering design. The two sample \nsubproject RPs, updated based on detailed technical design and future subproject RPs, will be \ndistributed  to  APs,  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval.  A \ngrievance  redress  committee  (GRC)  will  be  established  with  representatives  from  the  SMO, \nAPs, and local government institutions (LGIs) through official gazette. The GRC will resolve AP \ngrievances  with  non-legal  complications.  People\u2019s  participation  will  also  be  ensured  through  a \nresettlement advisory committee established at the local level involving local leaders including \nmen and women.  \n \n6. \nMonitoring  and  Evaluation.  BWDB,  with  assistance  from  the  resettlement  specialist, \nwill establish a monthly monitoring system involving PMO, SMOs, and implementing NGOs, and \nprepare  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (covering  staff \nappointment  and  capacities,  planning,  scheduling  and  budgeting;  delivery  of  entitlements \nincluding \nissues;  and \nresettlement  impacts)  in  the  quarterly  reports,  including  identification  of  significant  issues.  An \nannual report stipulating all efforts and outcome will be submitted to ADB. External monitoring \nwill  also  be  assigned  to  an  independent  domestic  expert,  who  will  review  the  progress  and \nperformance  of  RP  preparation  and \nfindings  and \nrecommendations simultaneously to BWDB and ADB.  \n \n7. \nResettlement Cost. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement is estimated at Tk204 \nmillion  ($3.4  million)  including  NGO  services.  The  Government  will  provide  the  entire  fund  for \nland acquisition and resettlement, and will guarantee meeting unforeseen obligations in excess \nof the budget estimate to meet the resettlement objectives.  \n   \nB. \n \n8. \nrehabilitation and improvement of two sample FCD/I schemes. \n\nScope  and  Impact.

According to the stated income, 17% and \n45%  of  the  households  affected  in  their  homestead,  shops,  ponds,  and  shrimp  ghers  have \nincome below the poverty line in Chenchuri Beel and Narail subproject, respectively, with nine \nand  seven  households  headed  by  women,  respectively.  Among  the  persons  losing  agriculture \nland,  19%  fall  below  the  poverty  line  in  both  subprojects,  with  9  and  11  tenant  farmers  in \nChenchuri Beel and Narail subproject, respectively.   \n \n10. \nStakeholder Consultation and Entitlements. During the project preparatory stage, the \nGovernment,  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants  undertook  consultation  using  participatory \nrural appraisal and focus group discussions, distributed copies of a local language brochure and \nfollowed  the  entitlement  matrix  shown  in  Table  A16.1.  After  the  consultation,  appropriate \nmitigating  measures  and  compensation  packages  were  devised,  following  the  RF.  The  RP  as \nprepared  will  be  refined  further  at  the  time  of  detailed  design,  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval, \nwith full disclosure to APs and on the ADB website. The Project will encourage \u201cself-relocation\u201d \nby  affected  households,  selecting  replacement  homestead  land  in  the  vicinity  of  their  own. \nAdditional  measures  will  be  taken  to  provide  appropriate  support  to  the  livelihood  restoration \naspects  of  the  project-affected  people,  with  a  focus  on  poor  and  vulnerable  households,  \nparticularly  those  with  female  heads,  with  priority  participation  in  the  livelihood  enhancement \ncomponent  of  the  Project,  and  targeted  provision  of  employment  for  civil  works  and  other \nopportunities created under the Project. \n \nImplementation Responsibilities and Cost Estimates. The arrangement described in \n11. \nthe RF is followed, including the implementation arrangements (engagement of local NGOs with \nsupervision  and  support  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants);  disclosure,  consultation,  and \ngrievance  mechanisms,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  estimated  cost  for  acquisition  of \nland and assets, and the cost associated with involuntary resettlement are Tk25.2 million ($0.43 \nmillion)  for  Chenchuri  Beel  and  Tk86.0  million  ($1.47  million)  for  Narail.  The  Government  will \nprovide the entire fund for land acquisition and resettlement.
