THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the State-Owned Enterprises Reform Program, and (ii) a proposed \npolicy-based loan to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for subprogram 1 of the State-Owned Enterprises \nReform Program.1 \n \n2.  The program, comprising three subprograms, will improve the operational performance \nand financial sustainability of state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs) and  help strengthen service \ndelivery. The program is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 \noperational priorities  of strengthening governance  and institutional capacity  (including SOE \nreforms to improve service delivery) and accelerating progress in gender equality.2 The program \naligns with priorities of the PNG country partnership strategy, under which ADB will support SOE \nreform, business environment improvement, and greater competition.3 The program also aligns \nwith the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) staff-monitored program for PNG.4 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Macroeconomic  context.  PNG  is  a  small  and  fragile  economy,  heavily  reliant  on \ncommodity exports. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.7% annually during 2013\u20132016, \ndriven by liquefied natural gas investment and exports. Growth fell to 1.3% during 2017\u20132018 due \nto softer commodity prices and disasters caused by natural hazards. After expansionary policies \nled to fiscal deficits averaging 5.6% of GDP during 2013\u20122016, expenditure controls (largely \nthrough cuts in capital spending and the accumulation of substantial arrears, including in utility \npayments) reduced the deficit to 2.6% during 2017\u20122018.5 The economy rebounded in 2019 as \nGDP grew 5.0%, underpinned  by recovery in energy and mineral  production following  an \nearthquake in 2018. With low global commodity prices, payments on arrears, and low revenue \ncollection, the fiscal deficit reached 4.9% of GDP in 2019. Sustained deficits contributed to an \nincrease in public debt from 17.4% of GDP in 2011 to 39.8% of GDP in 2019.6 \n \n4.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  hit  PNG  as  the  government  was \nembarking on significant fiscal consolidation to achieve a primary surplus and reduce public debt \nto below 40% of GDP in the medium term.  7 PNG has been affected by export losses and \nrestrictions to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. Pre\u2012COVID-19 growth was projected at 2.1% for \n2020 but the economy is now projected to contract by 2.9%. Dampened revenues and stimulus \nexpenditures will lead to a financing gap of 8.2% of GDP in 2020, higher than the pre\u2012COVID-19 \n \n1  This lending proposal was not included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: \nPapua New Guinea (2020\u20132022). Manila. The government requested financial assistance through a letter dated 24 \nJuly 2019 as an addition to the country operations business plan. ADB\u2019s Pacific Department confirmed that the 2020 \nresource envelope could accommodate such assistance. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nThe concept paper for the program was circulated to the ADB Board of Directors on 5 March 2020. \n2  ADB. 2018.

Washington, DC. \n5  Macroeconomic Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  A recalibration exercise in 2019 brought substantial contingent liabilities into official debt figures. \n7  As of 1 November 2020, PNG had 589 confirmed cases and 7 reported deaths because of COVID-19. \n ", "2 \nprojection of 5.0%. Public debt is expected to rise to 49.8% of GDP in 2020. The IMF assesses \nPNG to be at high risk of external and overall debt distress after COVID-19.8 The medium-term \nmacroeconomic framework is considered adequate, with the IMF projecting the fiscal deficit to fall \nto 3.2% of GDP in 2024 and public debt to 42.6% of GDP in 2025, as measures to curb recurrent \nspending resume and revenue recovers. Public debt is assessed as sustainable based on PNG\u2019s \ncommitment to fiscal consolidation under the IMF\u2019s staff-monitored program.9 \n \n5.  State-owned  enterprise  performance.  Most  essential  services  in  PNG\u2014including \nenergy,  water  supply,  telecommunications,  ports,  and  air  transport\u2014are  provided  through \nSOEs.10 Kumul Consolidated Holdings (KCH) is the holding company for the government\u2019s non-\nmineral,  oil,  and  gas  assets  through  the  General  Business  Trust  (GBT).  The  GBT  owns \ngovernment shares in nine SOEs, regulated by the Independent Public Business Corporation of \nPapua New Guinea (Kumul Consolidated Holdings) (Amendment) Act 2015 (KCH Act).11 KCH is \nthe trustee of the GBT and oversees SOE performance. KCH reports to the National Executive \nCouncil (NEC) (comprising all ministers) through the Minister for State Enterprises, who is \nresponsible for all policy matters related to the SOE portfolio. The government is also the majority \nshareholder in two resource companies: Kumul Petroleum Holdings and Kumul Mineral Holdings. \n \n6.  SOEs consistently demonstrate poor operational and financial performance. Incomplete \nfinancial  data  indicate  that  the  overall  profitability  of  SOEs  has  declined  since  2015. \nTheir consolidated losses increased to K142.7  million in 2018 from K54.3 million in 2017. \nThe consolidated SOE debt was estimated to be K5.8 billion as of March 2019, of which K2.1 \nbillion was commercial debt. Given the important (and often monopolistic) role that SOEs have in \ndelivering services, their continued weak performance results in expensive, inefficient, and low-\nquality service provision and makes the economy less competitive. Part of SOE debt represents \na contingent liability and exposes the government to fiscal risk.12 \n \n7.  Key constraints. A weak overarching policy and legal framework undermines commercial \nprinciples, contributing to poor operational performance. The KCH Act provides considerable \nscope  for  political  considerations  to  override  commercial  imperatives,  including  in  board \ncomposition of government majority\u2013owned SOEs. Performance evaluation procedures for SOE \nboard members are unclear. Efficiency and profitability are not emphasized as SOE objectives.  \n \n8.  Several earlier policy initiatives stalled due to inadequate political and administrative \nsupport.13 The government did not implement its community service obligation (CSO) policy \n \n8  IMF. 2020.

The downgrade in debt distress risk is caused by the impacts of COVID-19. \n9  The staff-monitored program includes measures and targets to tighten expenditure controls, reinvigorate revenue \nreforms, restore exchange rate flexibility, initiate SOE reforms, and deal with corruption (footnote 4). \n10 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n11 Independent State of PNG. 2015.  Independent Public Business Corporation of Papua New Guinea (Kumul \nConsolidated Holdings) (Amendment) Act 2015. Port Moresby. The government owns the majority of nine SOEs in \nthe GBT: Air Niugini Limited, Kumul Agriculture Limited, Kumul Telikom Holdings Limited, Motor Vehicle Insurance \nLimited, National Development Bank, PNG Power Limited, PNG Ports Corporation, Post PNG Limited, and Water \nPNG Limited. \n12 Not all SOE debt is recorded in the consolidated debt figures in the budget. Several SOE loans have been contracted \nwithout NEC approval, more than half without adequate economic and financial viability assessments. \n13 Assistance for these efforts was provided by ADB through the Private Sector Development Initiative.

A Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership Act 2014 (PPP Act) was gazetted in 2018.14 However, it was not implemented, \nand the few public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) that have been negotiated in PNG were on an ad \nhoc basis. A draft national competition policy, prepared in 2018 and calling for all SOEs to adhere \nto the principles of competitive neutrality, remained unapproved in mid-2020. \n \n9.  The absence of an effective SOE oversight mechanism inhibits timely reporting and \ndisclosure and reduces accountability. Most SOEs do not produce annual financial statements in \na timely manner and have a major accounting backlog. Audited annual financial statements are \nnot publicly available. Planning processes are weak and annual operating plans often delayed or \nnot prepared. Most SOEs do not prepare statements of corporate intent or systematically develop \nkey  performance  indicators.  Boards  and  management  in  many  SOEs  lack  qualified  and \nexperienced  personnel,  and  some  directors  have  been  appointed  through  nontransparent \nprocesses. As a result, corporate governance does not receive adequate emphasis, and the \nperformance of SOE board members is not systematically monitored and assessed. Women are \nunderrepresented in SOE boards; only 2 of 48 SOE directors were women in 2019. \n \n10.  Many SOEs face specific financial constraints that affect their performance. PNG Power \nLimited (PPL) has high debt exposure, estimated at K1.21 billion in 2019. It works with several \nsole-sourced independent power producers and has not systematically pursued commercially \nattractive opportunities. Financial management and procurement systems are improving but still \nweak. Air Niugini Limited (ANL) undertook major reforms in 2018 to eliminate loss-making \ninternational routes and turned a net operating loss after tax of K115 million in 2018 into a profit \nof K8 million in 2019. However, on account of flight restrictions and lack of traveler confidence \nbecause of COVID-19, ANL projects a net operating loss after tax of K198 million in 2020. \nLarge unpaid bills from government clients make it difficult for PPL and ANL to reduce losses. \nANL and KCH have noncore assets that could be monetized to generate cash flows, and a few \nrelatively well-performing SOEs (such as Motor Vehicle Insurance Limited and Post PNG Limited) \ncould be partially privatized, but capacity and institutional weaknesses constrain progress. The \ntwo water utilities, Eda Ranu (serving the national capital district) and Water PNG Limited (serving \nthe rest of PNG), are being merged to reduce overheads and increase efficiency, but progress \nhas been delayed by low institutional capacity. \n \n11.  ADB contributions. ADB has long been engaged in SOE reforms in PNG through \nregional technical assistance (TA) (para. 8). The same TA has supported benchmarking SOE \nperformance since 2012 and conducted feasibility assessments for PPPs for the National Airports \nCorporation, PPL, PNG Ports Corporation, and Eda Ranu. Results have been mixed, depending \non  political  commitment  and  administrative  support  (footnote  10).  ADB  has  built  strong \nrelationships with SOEs through engagement in water and energy projects.15 ADB has supported \nfinancial management of SOEs, including occasional direct assistance to finalize annual accounts. \nWhile earlier reform progress was slow (para. 8), the current administration\u2019s commitment to SOE \nreforms at the highest level and ADB\u2019s support through a medium-term program to advance SOE \nreforms in PNG provide a more enabling environment for the first time. \n \n14 Government of PNG. 2014.

The government aims to improve the operational performance of \nSOEs, with the broader objective of delivering services across PNG at high quality and affordable \nprices.16 The current administration emphasizes the need for SOEs to be accountable and \nfinancially sustainable and to return dividends to consolidated revenue. NEC approved an SOE \nreform blueprint in November 2019, laying out reforms to be undertaken across SOEs in 2019\u2013\n2022, to strengthen overarching corporate governance and policies and tackle SOE-specific \nchallenges (footnote 10). The pace of progress has been interrupted by COVID-19, which has \nforced the government to divert attention to managing the pandemic\u2019s impacts. The government, \nhowever, has made good progress and remains committed to SOE reforms. \n \n13.  Program description. The government has requested a programmatic policy-based loan \n(PBL) series with three subprograms (in 2020, 2021, and 2022) to support implementation of its \nSOE reform blueprint. A PBL is a suitable modality to expedite and accelerate the government\u2019s \nongoing SOE reforms. A programmatic approach meets urgent budget support needs while \nallowing  time  for  sustained  implementation  of  complex  and  politically  sensitive  reforms. \nThe approach permits prioritization of reform areas to account for low implementation capacity \nand provides flexibility to respond to emerging opportunities and constraints. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s  program  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  SOE  reform  blueprint.  All  the \nsubprograms will support reforms in three areas: (i) legislative and policy framework strengthened, \n(ii) governance and transparency enhanced, and (iii) financial sustainability of specific SOEs \nincreased (Appendix 4). Subprogram 1 provides the direction for subsequent subprograms by \nframing key policies, starting implementation of  reforms, and initiating specific transactions \n(paras. 16, 18, and  20). Subprograms  2  and 3  build on this  base by strengthening legal \nframeworks to institutionalize reforms, continuing implementation of more complex reforms, and \nadvancing and/or concluding transactions (paras. 17, 19, and 21). The program includes some \nadministrative actions considered critical in view of implementation constraints, to ensure that \ninstituted policies and legislation translate into changes in practices and lead to desired outcomes. \nReform targets take into account capacity limitations and initial conditions. \n \n15.  Under subprogram 1, ADB supports 17 policy actions, all of which have been completed. \nAlso, 18 indicative triggers have been identified for each of subprograms 2 and 3, to be refined \nand developed based on government priorities and capacity, considering possible continued \nCOVID-19 disruptions.  \n \n16.  Reform area 1: Legislative and policy framework strengthened. Policy actions will \nstrengthen the framework to enable all SOEs to operate effectively and efficiently. ADB has added \nvalue by supporting all five subprogram 1 actions in this area through regional TA.17 \n(i)  Overarching policy and legislation. NEC has approved the SOE Ownership and \nReform Policy, clarifying key principles of SOE ownership, governance,  and \nperformance. NEC has approved the draft KCH (Amendment) Bill to amend the \nKCH Act for submission to Parliament. Amendments will institutionalize reforms to \n(a) reduce political influence on commercial decision-making; (b) focus KCH\u2019s role \non monitoring SOE performance;18 (c) reinforce timely preparation and public \nrelease of corporate plans and audited annual financial statements; (d) establish \n \n16 Government of Papua New Guinea. 2018.

NEC has approved the National Competition Policy (para. \n8), which supports removal of barriers to the participation of women\u2019s businesses \nand  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  in  public  procurement,  through \nappropriate structuring of tenders and advertisements. \n(ii)  Public\u2013private partnerships. The NEC has directed the Office of the Legislative \nCounsel to draft PPP regulations for the implementation of the PPP Act (para. 8).19 \nThe Department of Finance has established a multiagency working group and \noutlined the group\u2019s responsibilities to support operationalization of the PPP Act, \nincluding preparation of regulations and the establishment of the PPP Center. \n \n17.  Subsequent subprograms will continue reforms with ADB value addition through TA \n(footnote 17). PNG\u2019s Parliament will approve the KCH (Amendment) Bill to formally institutionalize \nits provisions. Regulations on identifying and costing CSOs will be piloted and developed, in \naccordance with the KCH (Amendment) Act as approved by Parliament. Consumer protection \nand competition will be further improved. The PPP Act will be fully operationalized through NEC \napproval of the required regulations, with the PPP Center established, budgeted, and operational. \n \n18.  Reform area 2: Governance and transparency enhanced. Subprogram 1 initiates \nimplementation of key reforms, including provisions in the draft KCH (Amendment) Bill (para. 16). \nADB has added value to all six actions through TA (footnote 17) and staff advisory support. \n(i)  Director selection and performance. The KCH board has approved processes \nand guidelines for the transparent and merit-based selection of directors for KCH \nand SOEs in the GBT, including processes for developing terms of reference, \nadvertising, short-listing, interviewing, and selecting candidates.20 The processes \nand  guidelines  include  provisions  to  short-list  at  least  one  qualified  female \ncandidate (in a minimum short list of three candidates) for consideration for each \ndirector vacancy. The government has begun implementing the guidelines, with \nfive directors (including two women) appointed to the boards of KCH, Post PNG \nLimited, and PPL following approved processes in June 2020. \n(ii)  Financial management and procurement. To reduce the significant backlog of \naudited annual financial statements, KCH has adopted a phased approach to bring \naccounts of KCH and SOEs in the GBT up to date. Five SOEs have completed \ntheir 2018 accounts and  three their 2019 accounts, and auditors have been \nappointed to clear the backlog for 2018 and 2019.21 The PPL board has approved \nthe Procurement Policy (Financial Delegations), clarifying financial delegation \nauthorities and limits, and processes to commit PPL funds. \n(iii)  Corporate planning. NEC has approved annual operating plans, which are often \nbehind schedule or not prepared, for seven SOEs. To improve corporate planning, \nthe KCH board has approved guidelines for SOEs to prepare corporate plans and \nstatements of corporate intent annually.  22 This will allow the Ministry of State \n \n19 The PPP Act provides for the establishment of (i) the PPP Center to promote, coordinate, and analyze PPPs; and \n(ii) the PPP Steering Group comprising heads of the Department of the Treasury (DOT) and the Department of \nNational Planning and Monitoring, and the State Solicitor to supervise PPP arrangements. \n20 These processes will reduce political appointments (para. 9) and are expected to promote commercial decision-\nmaking by SOEs. \n21 ANL is completing its audited financial statements for 2016\u20122018, after which 2019 auditors will be appointed. \n22 The corporate plan outlines the objectives and business goals of the SOE, assesses its performance, lays out a \n \n ", "6 \nEnterprises and KCH to assess SOEs\u2019 strategies and monitor their performance. \nThe guidelines include reporting on the gender diversity of SOE staff. Corporate \nplans will incorporate a 3-year outlook for SOEs. The KCH board has approved a \ndecision to publicly disclose KCH annual reviews on its website for  greater \ntransparency and accountability,23 and disclosed the 2018 Annual Review. \n \n19.  Subsequent subprograms will continue reforms, with ADB adding value through regional \n(footnote 17) and country-specific TA.24 All director appointments under KCH will follow approved \nguidelines, with escalating targets for women\u2019s representation. KCH will establish a database of \nqualified  women  applicants  and  provide  director  training.  KCH  will  develop  performance \nmanagement processes for directors, linked to corporate planning. Financial management and \nprocurement will continue to be improved, and SOE accounts largely brought up to date by the \nend of the program. Timely preparation of audited annual financial statements and corporate \nplans will continue, as mandated by the KCH (Amendment) Bill to be approved by Parliament. \nThe KCH annual reviews will be improved to publicly disclose more information. \n \n20.  Reform area 3: Financial sustainability of specific SOEs increased. Subprogram 1 \nactions focus on specific SOEs in line with government priorities, taking into account development \npartner support. ADB has added value by assisting on private sector participation. Particular \nattention is paid to SOEs where there are synergies with ADB projects performance (para. 11).  \n(i)  Restructuring of specific SOEs. The KCH board has approved a strategic plan \nto improve ANL\u2019s performance, considering COVID-19 impacts and including \nshort-term stabilization measures  and long-term structural reforms. NEC has \napproved a decision to divest noncore assets owned by ANL to improve its cash \nflow position and pay down overdue creditors.25 Having two water utilities\u2014Water \nPNG Limited and Eda Ranu\u2014results in high  overhead costs,  and NEC has \napproved draft legislation for submission to Parliament to facilitate their merger. \n(ii)  Private sector participation in specific SOEs. While appetite for wholesale \nprivatization remains limited, the government plans to improve private sector \nparticipation in SOEs to upgrade performance and bring in private capital, based \non careful analysis and assessment.

Regional TA (footnote 17) is cofinanced by the governments of Australia and New \nZealand,  and  the  European  Union.  Ongoing  and  planned  partner  TA,  including  from  the \ngovernments of Australia and New Zealand, and the World Bank was considered in identifying \nreforms.27 The IMF\u2019s staff-monitored program (para. 1) supports transparency, accountability, and \ngovernance in SOEs. The government is leading partner coordination on SOE reform. \n \n23.  Lessons. The key lesson from the mixed success of ADB\u2019s prior engagement in SOE \nreform in PNG is that capitalizing on political support for reform is crucial (para. 11).28 ADB seeks \nto make the most of the current administration\u2019s commitment to reform, and to lock it in through a \nmultiyear program that gradually builds in complexity and strength (para. 14). Where feasible, \nlegislation and capacity building will help institutionalize reforms. ADB recognizes that extensive \nTA, coordinated with development partners and provided parallel to budget support, can help \npush the reform agenda and supplement government capacity. The program recognizes that \nstronger oversight mechanisms and resolving board issues can improve SOE performance.29 \nOther lessons include: (i) backloading ADB\u2019s disbursements across three subprograms and \nrecognizing that implementation of complex reforms may take longer, based on ADB\u2019s experience \nin Fiji (para. 27);30 and (ii) establishing a technical working group to coordinate reforms, including \nstaff from the Ministries of State Enterprises, and Transport and Infrastructure; the Departments \nof Finance, National Planning and Monitoring, and the Treasury; and KCH and relevant SOEs, \nbased on ADB\u2019s experience in the health sector program.31 \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n24.  The program is aligned with the following impact: delivery of services across PNG at high \nquality  and  affordable  prices  (footnote  16).  The  effect  of  the  reforms  will  be:  operational \nperformance of SOEs improved.32 The reforms under the three subprograms will contribute to this \nend through sequenced policy actions (para. 14). A better policy, legal, and institutional framework \nfor SOEs will strengthen governance, diversity, and accountability, which is expected to improve \nthe operational performance of the SOE portfolio.33 More transparent and merit-based selection \nand clearer performance evaluation processes are expected to contribute to more qualified \npersonnel on SOE boards. Some reforms target specific SOEs and will tackle their particular \nconstraints.  These  measures  will  help  avoid  unsustainable  borrowing;  reduce  contingent \nliabilities; encourage private investment; and improve reliability, efficiency, and affordability of \npublic services. In the medium term, the improved financial position and operational performance \nof SOEs can support greater investment in and attention to service delivery. Reforms can build \nfiscal space to respond to shocks and promote long-term growth. \n \n27 The Government of Australia\u2019s TA is supporting capacity-building measures in KCH and telecommunications reforms. \nThe Government of New Zealand and the World Bank are supporting PPL. The Government of New Zealand expects \nto provide support for transparent appointment of SOE board members. ADB is supporting telecommunications \nreforms through regional TA (footnote 17) and PPL through program actions and country-specific TA (footnote 24). \n28 The political economy of SOE reform in PNG is largely driven by shifts in political power, ministerial responsibilities, \nand performance of officials. \n29 ADB. 2018.

The net financing need in 2020 with COVID-19 is estimated at $1,950 million (8.2% of \nGDP), up from $1,362 million pre\u2013COVID-19 (Table 1). Expenditures in 2020 include $445 million \nfor COVID-19 response. ADB will contribute $500 million through three ordinary capital resource \nloans: $150 million through subprogram 3 of the Health Services Sector Development Program, \n$250  million  through  a  COVID-19  pandemic  response  option,  and  $100  million  through \nsubprogram 1 of the SOE Reform Program. Loans from partners will cover $753 million,34 with \nthe government expecting to draw down cash balances and borrow domestically for the remainder. \n \nTable 1: Papua New Guinea\u2019s Financing Needs and Sources \nItem  2018  2019  2020  2020  2021  2022 \nPre\u2013 With  Projections \nCOVID-19  COVID-19 \nReal GDP growth (% change)   (0.8)   5.0    2.1    (2.9)   2.5   2.6 \nTotal revenue (% of GDP)  17.8  16.2  15.3  14.0  15.1  15.6 \nTotal expenditure (% of GDP)  20.4  21.1  20.3  22.2  20.4  20.1 \nFiscal balance (% of GDP)  (2.6)  (4.9)  (5.0)  (8.2)  (5.3)  (4.5) \nNet financing needs ($ million)  624  1,220  1,362  1,950  1,309  1,165 \n   Drawdown from cash balances  0  0  0  131  0  0 \n   Domestic net financing ($ million)  (148)  456  370  566  253  223 \n   External net financing ($ million)  772  764  992  1,253  1,056  942 \n       of which: ADB PBLs and CPRO ($ million)  100   100    200    500    150    250  \nNominal GDP ($ billion)  24.0  25.0  26.9  23.3  24.7  25.9 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 pandemic response option, \nGDP = gross domestic product, PBL = policy-based loan. \nSources: Asian Development Bank, Government of Papua New Guinea, and International Monetary Fund estimates. \n \n26.  The government\u2019s budget financing needs are projected at $4,424 million during 2020\u2013\n2022.35 The government has requested financial assistance of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources for the program to help bridge this gap while safeguarding essential spending. \nThe amount comprises $100 million (5.2% of financing needs) for subprogram 1 in 2020, $150 \nmillion (11.4%) for subprogram 2 in 2021, and $250 million (21.4%) for subprogram 3 in 2022. \nThe overall program considers the government\u2019s financing needs (including COVID-19 impacts); \nthe availability of alternative financing, including the estimated financial support from other \ndevelopment partners; and debt sustainability. Escalating amounts for the subprograms reflect \nthe expected growing complexity of reforms. The loan will have a 15-year term, a grace period of \n3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 9.25 years and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The DOT is the executing agency.36 The DOT, the Department of Finance, and the \nMinistry of State Enterprises are the implementing agencies. The government has established a \nministerial committee to oversee  program implementation.37 A technical working group will \n \n34 The IMF has provided $364 million through a rapid credit facility loan (footnote 8). Loan financing provided by \ndevelopment partners, including ADB project investments, and budget support from the governments of Australia, \nJapan, and New Zealand, and the World Bank are expected to amount to $389 million (net of loan repayments). \n35 Financing needs narrow to $1,309 million in 2021 and $1,165 million in 2022 with fiscal consolidation and recovery. \n36 The DOT has significant experience as the executing agency for ADB programs (footnote 31).  \n37 The ministerial committee consists of the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Ministers for Communications and Energy, \nState Enterprises, Transport and Infrastructure, and the Treasury. \n ", "9 \ncoordinate program reforms (para. 23). The program implementation period is October 2019\u2013\nDecember 2022; October 2019\u2013November 2020 is the implementation period for subprogram 1, \nDecember 2020\u2013November 2021 for subprogram 2, and December 2021\u2013December 2022 for \nsubprogram 3. ADB will provide extensive TA to support program implementation and address \ngovernment capacity constraints (paras. 16\u201321). The proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n28.  Governance. PNG is classified as a fragile and conflict-affected situation.38 Promoting \ngovernance and strengthening public financial management are government priorities (footnote \n16). The current administration has pledged to combat corruption, although much remains to be \ndone.39 A 2015 public expenditure and financial accountability assessment identified substantial \ngaps,  which  are  gradually  being  addressed  through  reforms  (footnote  5).  The  National \nProcurement Act 2018 has come into force and will help boost fairness and transparency in \nprocurement.40 Despite  significant  public  financial  management  weaknesses  and  systemic \nfragility, the government is able to implement its budget. The program, complemented by parallel \ndevelopment  partner  support,  will  help  gradually  reduce  fiduciary  risks,  including  through \nprocurement reforms and efforts to bring SOE accounts up to date. Program reforms to increase \naccountability and transparency will directly support the government\u2019s goal of promoting good \ngovernance  (paras.  18\u201319). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998,  as amended  to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, the DOT, the Department of Finance, and the \nMinistry of State Enterprises. \n \n29.  Poverty and social. The public sector is an important provider of services to low-income \nhouseholds. The program will help SOEs strengthen public service delivery. Better financial \nsustainability of SOEs will improve their cash flow position and allow them to invest in sounder \nservices. The program will reduce potential pressure on the consolidated budget to the extent that \nSOE debt represents a contingent liability for the government. This will help ensure that the \ngovernment has resources to respond to future economic shocks, which can have adverse effects \non the poor, while maintaining critical public services. Private sector participation will increase \ncompetition and make basic goods and services more affordable. \n \n30.  Gender. Subprogram 1 is classified as some gender elements and includes proactive \nactions to support women\u2019s economic empowerment and decision-making. The SOE policy \nendorses increasing women\u2019s representation on SOE boards, in line with the government\u2019s \ncommitment to empower women (footnote 16). The draft KCH (Amendment) Bill introduces a \nprovision to include at least one woman on the short list for each director appointment, subject to \nqualifications (para. 16). Under subprogram 1, KCH approved guidelines for the transparent, \nmerit-based selection of SOE directors, requiring that the appointment process systematically \nshort-list at least one qualified female applicant for each director opening. The government has \nagreed that, under subsequent subprograms, it will escalate targets for women on boards and set \nup a database of qualified women to provide training and tap into for future director vacancies. \nThe KCH board has approved corporate planning guidelines, requiring SOEs to report on the \ngender diversity of staff at various levels. NEC has approved the National Competition Policy, \nwhich supports the removal of barriers to the participation of women\u2019s businesses in public \nprocurement through appropriate structuring of tenders and advertisements.
