It will \ncultivate  sustainable  and  efficient  road  asset  management  practices  by  strengthening \ngovernance  and  capacity  for  planning,  financing,  and  implementing  routine  and  periodic  road \nmaintenance.2   The  project  will  rehabilitate  and  maintain  327  kilometers  (km)  of  national  and \nlocal  roads  in  the  provinces  of  Attapu,  Salavan,  and  Xekong.  It  will  contribute  to  the \nachievement of the government\u2019s goal of improving road asset management. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nSector  context.  As  a  landlocked  country,  the  Lao  PDR  depends  heavily  on  road \ntransport  for  economic  development.  The  road  subsector  dominates  its  transport  sector, \nrepresenting  98%  of  total  passenger\u2013km  traveled,  and  86%  of  freight  moved  in  the  country.3 \nWhile the road network has expanded significantly in recent years, the growth in the number of \nvehicles  has  been  faster.  The  road  network  in  the  Lao  PDR  consists  of  national,  provincial, \ndistrict, and rural roads, with a total length of about 46,000 km and a density of about 7.4 km per \n1,000 persons, which is one of the highest in the region. Nonetheless, much of the road network, \nparticularly in the provinces, is in poor condition due to lack of proper maintenance. \n\n4. \nThe  poor  condition  of  the  roads  has  led  to  frequent  closures  and  has  effectively  cut  off \ntransport connections, constraining the movement of people and goods and impeding economic \ndevelopment.  The  lack  of  well-managed  and  well-maintained  roads  hinders  people\u2019s  access  to \nmarkets  and  basic  services,  significantly  contributing  to  poverty.  Inadequate  road  maintenance \nreduces the country\u2019s economic competitiveness and slows the pace of poverty reduction. \n\nImproving  the  delivery  of  public  services  in  road  asset  management  is  a  long-term \n5. \nstrategic objective of the government. To achieve it, the government, with assistance from the \nWorld  Bank  and  the  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency,  embarked  on  a \nlong-term plan in 2000 to improve road maintenance in the country, primarily by strengthening \nroad maintenance capacity and capability.4 Key outputs of the plan were the establishment of a \nRoad  Maintenance  Fund  (RMF)  and  the  development  of  an  appropriate  road  maintenance \nmanagement  system  to  help  allocate  funds  and  prioritize  the  maintenance  of  Lao  PDR  road \nassets. 5  In  2004\u20132010,  the  World  Bank  and \nthe  Swedish  International  Development \nCooperation  Agency  financed  Road  Maintenance  Program  Phase  1  and  Phase  2  to  further \nsupport road maintenance in the country. The Japan International Cooperation Agency currently \nfinances  the  Road  Management  Capability  Project  (2011\u20132016)  to  improve  governance, \nplanning,  and  management  of  sustainable  road  maintenance  in  Savannakhed  and  Vientiane \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2014. Preparing the \n\nRoad Sector Governance and Maintenance Project. Manila (TA 8492-LAO). \n\n3  Lao PDR National Statistics Center. http://www.nsc.gov.la \n4  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  The Lao PDR established the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) to finance road maintenance. The RMF commenced \noperations in 2001. It is managed bythe Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT)  and is supervised by the \nRoad Maintenance Fund Advisory Board. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nprovinces. In addition, the World Bank-financed Lao Road Sector Project (2010\u20132017) supports \nroad maintenance works of the provincial network in Houaphan and Phongsali provinces. \n\n6. \nKey  issues.  The  road  sector  is  under  the  overall  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Public \nWorks and Transport (MPWT). Following the decentralization policy in 2000, road maintenance \nresponsibilities of provincial road network have been delegated to the provincial departments of \nMPWT  called  provincial  departments  of  public  works  and  transport  (DPWTs).  As  part  of  the \ndevolution policy, the assistance provided by development agencies has created a good system \nfor  road  asset  management.  Despite  this,  the  devolution  of  road  maintenance  responsibilities \nhas  continued  to  be  constrained  by  inadequate  governance,  weak  institutional  capacity  and \ninsufficient  funding  for  road  asset  management.  The  key  challenges  faced  by  MPWT  and \nprovincial  DPWTs  for  undertaking  road  maintenance  activities  are  inadequate  governance \nprocedures  for  road  maintenance  planning,  financial  management,  procurement,  and  contract \nsupervision, lack of staff\u2019s technical capacity and experience in road maintenance management, \nand financial  constraints  for  undertaking  road maintenance.  Hence,  strengthening  governance \nand institutional  capacity for road maintenance activities and supporting physical  maintenance \nwork at the provincial level  will facilitate efficient decentralization and effective delivery of road \nmaintenance to provide successful future road asset management in the country.  \n\n7. \nThe  road  network  is  deteriorating  rapidly  because  of  the  steady  growth  in  traffic, \ncombined with overloading of vehicles. Overloading control is crucial to maintain roads in good \ncondition during the design-life period of the road. The lack of effective axle load control has led \nto  an  increased  number  of  overloaded  trucks  on  the  roads,  which  has  resulted  in  the  roads \ndeteriorating  much  quicker  than  they  should.  Related  to  this  issue  is  the  lack  of  effective \nregulation(s)  to  provide  updated  policies  and  procedures,  appropriate  institutional  setup, \nfeasible measures, and practical enforcement for monitoring axle load. This is one of the major \nroad maintenance governance issues that needs to be addressed.  \n\nInsufficient  financial  resources  constrain  road  maintenance  activities.  With  respect  to \n8. \nroad  maintenance  financing  in  Lao  PDR,  the  main  funding  source  is  the  RMF.  The  main \nrevenue source of the RMF is from the fuel levy, which accounts for 97% of total revenue.6 The \ntotal revenue of the RMF is about $48 million in 2013. All of the RMF revenue is used to fund \nroad maintenance in the  country,  with 90%  of the RMF fund  allocated  to  road maintenance of \nurban and national roads and 10% of the RMF fund allocated to maintenance of provincial and \nlocal  roads.  However,  the  funding  level  of  the  RMF  is  insufficient  to  meet  road  maintenance \nneeds,  in  particular  for  the  provincial  road  network.  The  RMF  regulation(s),  which  govern  the \nfinancing mechanism and financial management of the RMF, need to be improved to increase \nRMF revenue level and strengthen governance of the RMF usage for ensuring sustainable road \nmaintenance funding. \n\nSince  the  funding  for  road  maintenance  is  limited,  prioritization  and  monitoring  of  road \n9. \nmaintenance activities is crucial for effective road asset management. At present, no centralized \nrecord keeping system exists to provide such information. The absence of such record keeping \nsystem  results  in  a  governance  issue,  leading  to  difficulty  in  monitoring  and  audit  of  the  road \nmaintenance  work.  The  establishment  of  a  road  asset  management  registry  system  with \nconsolidated  information  about  all  stages  of  road  maintenance  work  including  planning, \nbudgeting,  procurement,  and  implementation  will  facilitate  project  prioritization  and  monitoring; \nand will improve governance and transparency.  \n\n10. \n\nThe  poor  road  condition  of  the  road  network  is  also  caused  by  outdated  road \n\n                                                \n6  Assessment on Road Maintenance Fund (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fconstruction and maintenance standards, design and construction deficiencies, and inadequate \ninstitutional capacity in road maintenance and road asset management practices. The absence \nof  standardized  road  asset  management  manuals  and  updated  road  construction  technical \nspecifications has resulted in poor road construction and maintenance quality as well as design \nand  construction  deficiencies.  Upgrading  and  standardization  of  road  asset  management \nmanuals  and  technical  specification  will  be  essential  to  improving  road  construction  and \nmaintenance standards, thus facilitating the upkeep of roads in good condition. \n\n11.  Weak  institutional  capacity  for  road  asset  management  contributes  to  poor  road \nconditions.  The  project  will  implement  capacity  building  programs  for  MPWT  and  DPWTs, \nprivate  contractors  and  local  communities  to  strengthen  human  resource  capacity  in  technical \nissues  concerning  road  asset  management  planning,  implementation  and  management.  The \nstrengthening  of  institutional  capacity  will  improve  the  delivery  of  road  asset  management  by \nconcerned stakeholders.  \n\n12. \nThe  project  will  rehabilitate  and  maintain  327  km  of  national  and  local  roads  in  the \nprovinces of Attapu, Salavan, and Xekong. The three provinces are amongst the poorest rural \nprovinces in the country where large proportion of rural poor live. Much of the road network in \nthese three provinces lacks proper maintenance due to limited road maintenance funding. The \nselected  road  sections  for  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  are  priority  in  terms  of  improving \naccess  for  people  in  rural  areas.  Although  vital  for  transport  within  the  provinces  of  Attapu, \nSalavan, and Xekong, and to cross-border transport and trade, most of these road sections are \nunpaved and/or in poor condition and unable to provide all-year accessibility. The rehabilitation \nand maintenance of these road sections will provide reliable all-year road access from provincial \ntowns  and  agricultural  rural  areas  to  markets,  employment  centers,  and  social  services  in  the \nthree provinces, improving socio-economic living conditions of the rural population in the project \nregions.       \n\nDevelopment  coordination. The  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  collaborated  closely \n13. \nwith the government and other development partners for the project design. The project builds \non  the  existing  road  asset  management  system  and  focuses  on  areas  needing  improvement. \nThe project design incorporates lessons from other road maintenance projects and innovations \nin road maintenance. This approach ensures nonduplication and harmonization of development \nassistance.  \n\n14. \nRelated  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  aligns  with  the  prevailing  Lao  PDR \ntransport  policy  and  strategy,  which  focusses  on  \u201crecurrent  works  in  transport  infrastructure; \nroad  maintenance  and  asset  management.\u201d7 In  light  of  this,  the  government  is  committed  to \nachieving sustainable road maintenance. The MPWT has been tasked to identify areas needing \nimprovement  for  road  asset  management,  develop  adequate  measures,  review  existing \nregulations  and  laws,  and  propose  actions.  This  government  initiative  is  a  significant  step \ntowards enabling the Lao PDR to effectively utilize development assistance for better road asset \nmanagement. The project will complement the government\u2019s initiative and support the MPWT in \nrealizing sustainable road maintenance. \n\nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for the Lao \n15. \nPDR and with the government\u2019s Seventh Five-Year National Socio-Economic Development Plan \n(2011\u20132015),  both  of  which  have  the  overarching  objective  of  promoting  inclusive  and \n\n                                                \n7   Government  of  the  Lao  PDR.  2014.

ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department (IED)  identified  assistance to  the \nMPWT in tackling issues related to capacity development and road maintenance as the primary \narea  where  ADB  performance  could  be  improved.11 IED  recently  reaffirmed  the  importance  of \nmaintaining  the  roads  in  good  condition  as  a  follow-up  support  to  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  transport \nsector.12 Among the key lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience and road maintenance projects \nfinanced by other development agencies are (i) policy actions on governance issues should be \nbased  on  realistic  assessments  of  political  will  and  appropriate  timing  ;  (ii)  capacity  building \nrequires  proper  planning  and  adequate  targeting;  (iii)  streamlined  approaches  to  procurement \nfacilitate  effective  project  implementation;  and  (iv)  upfront  support  to  the  executing  agency  on \nADB  procedures  and  information  requirements  are  crucial  for  effective  implementation.  These \nlessons have been incorporated in the project design.    \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  expected  impact  of  the  project  will  be  the  improved  delivery  of  public  services  in \n17. \nroad  asset  management.  The  outcome  will  be  that  sustainable  road  maintenance  is \nimplemented in the provinces of Attapu, Salavan, and Xekong. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will have three outputs. \n\n18. \n \nOutput  1:  Governance  and  practice  for  road  asset  management  improved.  This \n19. \noutput will provide measures to improve governance and practice. The measures are crucial to \ndelivering  successful  road  asset  management.  They  involve  the  (i)  revision  of  axle-load \nmonitoring  regulation(s),  (ii)  revision  of  RMF  regulation(s),  (iii) development  of  a  web-based \nroad  asset  management  registry  for  public  disclosure,  and  (iv) upgrade  of  road  asset \nmanagement manuals and technical specifications. \n \n20. \nOutput  2:  Institutional  capacity  for  road  asset  management  strengthened.  This \noutput  will  bolster  national  and provincial  institutional  capacity.  It  involves  (i) strengthening the \ncapacity of the MPWT for road asset management, (ii) improving contractors\u2019 capacity for road \nmaintenance  contract  tendering  and  management,  and  (iii)  improving  community-based  road \nmaintenance capacity. \n \n21. \nOutput  3:  Road  asset  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  completed.  This  output  will \nrehabilitate and maintain 327 km of selected national and local roads in the provinces of Attapu \n                                                \n8 ADB. 2011.

The project completion date \nwill be 31 March 2021, and the ADB loan will close on 30 September 2021. \n \n26. \nAll goods and works will be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended from time to time). Works valued at $3 million or above and goods valued at $1 million \nor  above  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  The  government\u2019s  public \nprocurement  legislation  and  regulations  (as  acceptable  to  ADB)  will  be  applied  for  packages \nbelow  the  respective  international  competitive  bidding  thresholds;  they  will  be  procured  using \nnational competitive bidding. For packages below $100,000, goods and works will be procured \nthrough  shopping.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  following  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013,  as amended from time to time). The  draft master  bidding  documents  have \nbeen  prepared  following  ADB\u2019s  standard  requests  for  proposals  for  consulting  services,  and \nADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents  for  goods  and  works  (large  and  small).  The  bidding \ndocuments  will  be  finalized  upon  completion  of  the  detailed  engineering  design,  which  will  be \ndone by the project management consultant. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n27.  Work will entail rehabilitation and maintenance of national and local roads. The  chosen \nrehabilitation  and  maintenance  activities  considered  cost,  durability,  affordability,  safety,  and \nclimate resilience, and are deemed technically feasible. The maintenance technology involved is \nstraightforward and within the capacities of engineers and contractors available in the Lao PDR. \nAll  civil  works  designs  are  compatible  with  standard  MPWT  parameters  and  the  available \noperation  and  maintenance  capacity.  Contract  packaging  will  attract  contractors  with  suitable \nqualifications and ensure efficient procurement. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n28. \nFor  the  economic  appraisal,  the  roads  under  the  project  are  assumed  to  receive  only \nroutine  maintenance  in  the  without-project  scenario. 16 The  economic  analysis  compared  the \nindividual roads\u2019 conditions in the with-project with the without-project scenarios to measure the \nbenefits  from  vehicle  operating  and  time  cost  savings  arising  from  the  project  road \nimprovements. Calculated using these quantified benefits, the project internal rate of return was \nfound to be 17.2% and the net present value of net benefits using a 12% discount rate is $ 5.4 \nmillion.  \n \n29. \nOf  the  project\u2019s  mix  of  national,  provincial,  and  district  roads,  analysis  indicated  that \nusers of the local roads, all initially in poor condition, would receive the greater portion of total \nproject  benefits.  Given  that  the  local  roads  link  produce-growing  hinterlands  with  provincial \n\n                                                \n16  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nand  district markets  as well  as  urban  centers, this  is a  particularly  desirable  outcome from a \nredistributive as well as a growth perspective. \n \n30. \nThe executing agency and project owner is a government line ministry, and the project \nis  neither  revenue  generating  nor  cost  recovering  by  nature,  hence  the  financial  analysis \nfocuses  on  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  project.  The  financial  analysis  assesses  the \nexecuting agency\u2019s financial capacity to meet the recurrent costs of operating and maintaining \nthe developed facilities  in  a sustainable manner. The overall financial  position was  projected \nfor the fiscal years  2015\u20132025.17 The projection, based on historical income and expenditure \nstatements, confirms the project owner\u2019s financial ability to cover its current costs and sustain \nthe  facilities  developed  under  the  project.  Moreover,  the  government  has  assured  that  it  will \nincrease  its  budget  allocation  for  the  MPWT  to  fund  the  incremental  recurrent  costs  of \noperating  and  maintaining  the  project.  The  project  is  considered  financially  sustainable. \nRelevant covenants are included in the draft loan agreement to ensure project sustainability. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nfor \n\nrisk \n\nThe \n\nratings \n\n31. \nfinancial  management  and  procurement  are  moderate. \nAssessments of the MPWT\u2019s financial management and procurement capacity confirmed that \nproject  implementation arrangements,  which follow  previous  ADB  transport-sector  projects  in \nthe  Lao  PDR,  are  appropriate.  The  MPWT  has  extensive  experience  in  managing  ADB  and \nother  externally  funded  projects,  and  has  sufficient  capacity  to  undertake  international  and \nnational  competitive  bidding  for  procurement.  Its  Department  of  Finance  will  adopt  a  project \nfinancial management system, including internal control procedures, used  in ADB- and World \nBank-financed  road  projects.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established  for  the \nproject, following the successful  examples  of  other  ADB-financed road improvement  projects \nin the Lao PDR. While incumbent MPWT staff members have experience with ADB guidelines, \nthe  implementation  of  the  project  will  further  strengthen  the  capacity  of  project  staff  and \nprovide  on-the-job  assistance  to  ensure  that  procurement,  financial  management,  and \ndisbursements  undertaken  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  An  independent  external  financial  auditor \nwill be hired for external auditing of the project accounts. Review missions and regular project \nsupervision  will  monitor  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  reporting  and  external  audit \nrequirements. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  including  the  MPWT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 15). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  project  will  result  in  better  access  to  schools,  markets,  and  health  facilities.18 Six \n32. \ntraining courses in routine road maintenance and management will be provided to communities \nalong  project  roads,  with  women  comprising  50%  of  trainees.  The  training  sessions  and \nmaintenance  tools  to  be  provided  to  the  communities  are  part  of  the  community  development \nsupport for generating local employment and will be carried out voluntarily; they are not part of \nthe  government\u2019s  routine  maintenance  activities.  Social  risks  are  involved,  such  as  the  risk  of \nspreading  communicable  diseases,  human  trafficking,  and  an  increase  in  road  accidents.  To \nmitigate  these  risks,  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  awareness  and  prevention  program, \nand a road safety program are included in the project. These will be designed and implemented \nin a gender-sensitive and culturally appropriate manner. \n\n                                                \n17  The fiscal year of the Government of the Lao PDR and its agencies ends on 30 September. \n18  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n33. \nAll  safeguard  documents  were  prepared  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009)  and  will  be  posted  on  the  ADB  website  in  compliance  with  disclosure  requirements.19 \nInitial consultations with residents, government officials, and civil society confirm broad support \nfor  the  project.  Consultation  with  these  groups  will  continue  throughout  the  project  cycle, \nfollowing the consultation and participation plan and stakeholder communications strategy in the \nproject  administration  manual.  The  project  includes  resources  to  assist  counterparts  in \nimplementing  social  and  environmental  safeguards  effectively.  Monitoring  requirements  and \nappropriate grievance redress mechanisms are outlined in the safeguards documents. \n \nThe  project  is  not  anticipated  to  cause  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  and \n34. \nhas  been  classified  as  environment  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared  for  each  project  road  to \nmeet the requirements of the safeguard policy. The IEE has been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \nExcept  for  National  Road  18B,  none  of  the  roads  passes  through  protected  areas.  National \nRoad 18B, which was opened to traffic about 10 years ago, traverses 54 km of the core zone of \nthe Dong Amphan National Protected Area (NPA). Only spot rehabilitation will be carried out for \nNational Road 18B due to the relatively good condition of much of the road length and will not \ninvolve widening and tree cutting. The environmental management plan will be incorporated into \nthe  project\u2019s  civil  works  contract  documentation.  Public  consultations  were  conducted  for  the \nproject,  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  implemented  to  facilitate  resolution  of \nproject-related  environmental  impacts.  Based  on  the  Preliminary  Climate  Risk  Screening \nChecklist,  the  project  is  in  the  medium-risk  category.20 Potential  flood  impacts,  erosion,  and \nclimate  risks  were  considered  during  project  preparation.  Corresponding  adaptation measures \nwere  identified  and  included  in  the  project  cost  estimates  and  in  the  design  for  the  roadway, \ndrainage, erosion control, and maintenance, as well as in the institutional aspect. \n \n35. \nThe project will not entail any land acquisition or restriction of access to land resulting in \nphysical or economic displacement of people. The involuntary resettlement categorization is C. \nThe  indigenous  peoples  categorization  for  the  project  is  B.  National  Road  16  and  Provincial \nRoad 7615 (Salavan Province) and Provincial Road 9001 (Attapu Province) are dominated by a \nnumber  of  ethnic  groups,  such  as  Hahak,  Katu,  Lavy,  Shuay  and Triang,  while  the  Lao  Loum \nare  dominant  along  the  remaining  four  project  roads.  An  indigenous  peoples  plan  (ethnic \ncommunities development plan) was prepared and uploaded on the ADB website.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36. \nThe  overall  risk  is  assessed  as  medium.
