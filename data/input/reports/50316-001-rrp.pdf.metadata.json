The  NDRMF  will  be \ngovernment-owned  and  will  aim  to  reduce  Pakistan\u2019s  socioeconomic  and fiscal  vulnerability  to \nnatural hazards and climate variability and change.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nHigh  incidence  and  cost  of  disasters.  Pakistan  requires  substantial  financing  to \n3. \nmitigate  its  significant  disaster  risk.  The  country,  its  population,  and  assets  are  increasingly \nexposed and vulnerable to various natural hazards. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, \nit  was  one  of  the  10  countries  most  affected  by  extreme  weather  events  during  1995\u20132014.2 \nSince  2000,  increasing  natural  hazards  have  resulted  in  significant  loss  of  life,  economic \ndamage,  and  the  reversal  of  development  gains.  Frequent  floods  have  caused  the  greatest \nphysical  damage.  Three  major  floods  in  2010,  2011,  and  2014  affected  more  than  30  million \npeople,  resulting  in more  than  $14  billion  in  damage  and  losses. In  2005,  a major  earthquake \ncaused more than 73,000 deaths and $5 billion in losses. The country also experiences tropical \ncyclones  and  droughts;  a  drought  in  2014\u20132015  affected  over  3  million  people.  These  events \nseverely  impact  the  livelihoods  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  resulting  in  mass  migration, \ndisrupting  trade  and  commerce,  and  destabilizing  the  market.  Such  events  negatively  impact \ngovernment  budgets,  periodically  placing  significant  additional  demands  on  limited  public \nresources for humanitarian relief, early recovery, and reconstruction. \n \n4. \nHigh  vulnerability  to  climate  change.  Climate  change  is  expected  to  result  in \nincreased  temperatures,  glacial  melt,  rising  sea  levels  in  coastal  areas,  and  changes  in  the \nfrequency  and  intensity  of  precipitation.  Extreme  weather  events  such  as  floods  and  droughts \nare  likely  to  become  more  frequent  in  Pakistan  in  the  future,  potentially  increasing  disaster \nlosses if appropriate action is not taken. Rapid unplanned urbanization intensifies the exposure \nand vulnerabilities of the population, especially the poor, increasing disaster risks. \n \n5. \nSignificant  fiscal  impact  of  disasters.  Frequent  disasters  in  Pakistan  pose  a \nsignificant  risk  to  the  fiscal  stability  of  the  federal  and  provincial  governments.  The  annual \neconomic impact of flooding alone is estimated at $1.2 billion\u2013$1.8 billion, equivalent to 0.5%\u2013\n0.8%  of  gross  domestic  product.3 The  toll  has  been  high,  totaling  $25.5  billion  since  2005.  A \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Germanwatch  e.V.  2015.

Berlin. \n\n3  World  Bank  Group,  Global  Facility  for  Disaster  Reduction  and  Recovery.  2015.  Fiscal  Disaster  Risk  Assessment \n\nOptions for Consideration: Pakistan. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fsignificant portion of relief, early recovery, and reconstruction costs is taken from scarce federal \nand  provincial  government  resources.  Each  year,  the  federal  government  budgets  limited \nresources  for  post-disaster  response,  but  it  often  requires  significant  additional  resources  to \nsupport affected communities and rebuild the country\u2019s social and economic infrastructure after \ndisasters. This response puts considerable pressure on public finances, with increases in fiscal \ndeficits and public debt, and diverts scarce funds away from development operations. \n \n6. \nEvolving  disaster  risk  governance  and  resource  constraints.  Since  a  massive \nearthquake struck Pakistan in 2005, the government\u2019s disaster risk management (DRM) policy \nand  strategy  have  moved  from  being  largely  response-oriented  to  having  a  broader  approach \nstressing disaster risk reduction (DRR) and preparedness. Constitutional changes introduced in \n2013  have  also  transferred  many  responsibilities  from  the  federal  to  the  provincial  level. \nHowever, progress is limited by financing and capacity constraints. The government has worked \nextensively,  with  support  from  multiple  development  partners,  to  promulgate  the  National \nDisaster  Management  Act,  2010  and  to  establish  the  National  Disaster Management  Authority \nand provincial and district disaster management authorities. The National Disaster Management \nAct also provides the legal framework for establishing dedicated funds for DRM at the provincial \nand  federal  levels.  DRM-related  planning  has  become  the  responsibility  of  the  national  and \nprovincial planning ministries and the federal Ministry of Climate Change. Despite this progress, \nnational, provincial, and district disaster management authorities have limited technical capacity. \nThe  mainstreaming  of  DRM  in  planning  and  operations  is  still  in  its  initial  stages  in  all  key \nfederal  and  provincial  ministries,  departments,  and  agencies.  The  project  will  help  accelerate \nthe  mainstreaming  efforts  of  entities  responsible  for  DRM  by  providing  dedicated  DRR  and \ncapacity  development  resources,  and  supporting  systematic  disaster  risk  assessments  and \nDRM  coordination  mechanisms  at  multiple  levels.  This  will  facilitate  a  coherent  and \ninstitutionalized  DRM  approach  across  sectors  and  among  federal,  provincial,  and  local \ngovernments. \n \nDisaster  risk  management  policy  and  strategic  environment.  The  government\u2019s \n7. \nstrategy  is  to  make  a  long-term  commitment  to  DRM  by  putting  in  place  policies  and  plans  to \naddress structural and nonstructural aspects of DRM comprehensively and systematically. The \nnational DRR and climate change policies were  approved in 2013, while the National Disaster \nManagement  Plan  (NDMP),  which  includes  an  investment  program  for  2012\u20132022,  was \napproved  in  2012.  The  NDMP  contains  10  core  intervention  areas  and  118  proposed  priority \nactions  and  programs focused  on reducing  disaster risk  and  enhancing  the  country\u2019s  ability  to \nmanage disasters.4 The priority actions cover all stages of the pre- and post-disaster cycle. The \ndraft National Flood Protection Plan IV (NFPP-IV) for 2016\u20132026 complements the NDMP and \nfocuses on integrated flood risk management.5 The two plans have a combined cost of about $3 \nbillion.  The  NDRMF  will  finance  eligible  subprojects  from  the  two  plans,  based  on  detailed \nvulnerability  and  risk  assessments  as  well  as  specific  criteria,  including  adequate  economic \nreturns, safeguards, and sustainability (para. 20). \n \n8. \nADB  assistance  and  country  partnership  strategy.  The  proposed  project  is  in  line \nwith  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2015\u20132019  for  Pakistan 6 and  the  Operational  Plan  for \n\n                                                \n4  The cost of implementing the NDMP was estimated at nearly $1.1 billion when the NDMP was formulated in 2012. \nSince  then  it  has  been  recognized  that  the  NDMP\u2019s  investment  requirements  are  significantly  underestimated. \nGovernment  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of  Climate  Change,  National  Disaster  Management  Authority.  2012.

Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2015\u20132019. Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fIntegrated  Disaster  Risk  Management,  2014\u20132020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \nwhich  stresses  the  need  for  an  integrated  approach  combining  DRR,  disaster  risk  financing \n(DRF), and climate change adaptation.7 ADB has been a major partner of Pakistan in the latter\u2019s \nefforts  to  integrate  DRM  in  its  development  agenda,  and  has  supported  the  country's \nreconstruction efforts after major disasters. ADB support has focused mainly on reconstruction, \nand it has issued nearly $2 billion in loans and grants during 2005\u20132015 for the reconstruction \nof  transport,  irrigation  and  flood  protection,  housing,  education,  health,  and  livelihood \ninfrastructure  that  is  resistant  to  multiple  hazards,  together  with  DRM  capacity  building.  The \nFlood  Emergency  Reconstruction  and  Resilience  Project  approved  in  2015  and  the  proposed \nproject  mark  a  shift  in  ADB\u2019s  focus  toward  a  greater  emphasis  on  DRR  and  DRF,  while \ncontinuing to support reconstruction and rehabilitation.8 The government has asked ADB to be \nthe  lead  development  partner  in  this  critical  area,  with  the  proposed  project  a  key  element  of \nADB\u2019s support for DRR and DRF. \n \n9. \nLessons.  The  country  assistance  program  evaluation  of  ADB  programs  in  Pakistan \nduring  2002\u20132012  emphasizes  that  ADB  must  improve  its  support  for  integrated  disaster \nprevention  and  long-term  preparedness. 9 It  recommends  that  ADB  further  mainstream  DRR \nmeasures in its infrastructure projects, and work closely with ministries and agencies to improve \nthe disaster resilience of infrastructure and community preparedness. Lessons also indicate that \nlimited  government  technical  and  financial  capacity  and  high  levels  of  disaster  risk  warrant \ncomprehensive  and  sustained  ADB  support  for  all  aspects  of  DRM,  in  close  coordination  and \npartnership  with  specialized  local  and  international  agencies.  Experience  from  ADB  programs \nhighlights the need to include well-targeted support for the vulnerable, community involvement \nin DRM, strong linkages with existing development programs, support for technical innovations \nfor  investment  sustainability  and  multi-hazard  resilience,  and  effective  coordination  and \nmonitoring of future DRM interventions. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  impact  will  be  a  more  disaster-resilient  Pakistan  with  reduced  socioeconomic  and \nfiscal  vulnerability  to  natural  hazards  and  climate  variability  and  change.  The  outcome  will  be \nincreased and sustainable institutional and physical capacity to reduce the socioeconomic and \nfiscal impacts of natural hazards and climate change. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  outputs  are  (i)  the  NDRMF  established  and  made  operational,  (ii) \n11. \ninvestments to reduce vulnerabilities to natural hazards increased, and (iii) analytical work and \nproducts to improve the fiscal management of disaster risk completed. \n \nOutput  1:  The  National  Disaster  Risk  Management  Fund  established  and  made \n12. \noperational.

The NDRMF will establish, \noperate,  and  maintain  the  endowment  fund  following  rules,  regulations,  and  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. The legal framework for the endowment is provided in the National Disaster \nManagement  Act  (para  6).  The  initial  contribution  from  ADB  and  the  government  would  be \ninvested in low-risk, relatively safe government securities and instruments. Income earned from \nthe endowment fund will be used to cover the NDRMF\u2019s full operating costs from the fourth year \nof  its  operations.  Financial  projections  indicate  that  the  endowment  fund\u2019s  annual  income  will \nsignificantly  exceed  planned  expenditures.  The  NDRMF  may  use  the  excess  income  for \nadditional  investments  in  interest-  and/or  profit-bearing  securities  and  for  financing  DRR \nactivities,  as  approved  by  its  board  of  directors. 10 Under  this  output,  a  comprehensive  effort \nstrategically  directed  at  resource  mobilization  would  be  undertaken  to  diversity  the  NDRMF\u2019s \nfunding  base. This  effort  would  be  aimed  at multilateral  and  bilateral  organizations,  the  United \nNations  system,  international  and  national  philanthropic  organizations,  and  the  private  sector. \nThe NDRMF will also explore opportunities to access global climate financing sources. \n \n13. \nOutput  2:  Investments  to  reduce  vulnerabilities  to  natural  hazards  increased. \nUnder  this  output,  the  NDRMF  will  ongrant  funds  on  a  cost-sharing  basis  to  eligible  fund \nimplementation  partners  (FIPs)  that  meet  the  accreditation  criteria11 for  eligible  subprojects.12 \nThe  FIPs  will  include  federal,  provincial,  and  district  government  entities;  autonomous \norganizations;  civil  society;  and  academia.  The  NDRMF  will  provide  funding  through  matching \ngrants  of  up  to  70%  for  a  range  of  structural  and  nonstructural  interventions.  Key  activities \ninclude  (i)  retrofitting  or  building  about  300  kilometers  of  flood  protection  infrastructure;  (ii) \nretrofitting  about  500  public  buildings,  including  schools  and  health  facilities,  against  multiple \nhazards; \nincluding  preparing  and \nimplementing  national  and  subnational  emergency  response  plans;  (iv)  establishing  early \nwarning  systems,  including  procuring  and  installing  radars  and  river,  rain,  and  stream gauges; \n(v)  designing  and  implementing  community-based  DRM  activities;  (vi)  conducting  analytical \nwork,  such  as  multi-hazard  vulnerability  risk  assessments  for  vulnerable  districts  and  urban \ncenters  covering  gender-related  vulnerabilities  and  climate  change  research  and  studies;  (vii) \nmainstreaming  and  monitoring  DRR,  including  developing  procedures  for  analysis  and \nintegrating  disaster  risk  during  project  preparation,  and  tracking  DRR  and  disaster  response \nexpenditure; and (viii) building capacity to strengthen national and local DRM organizations. The \nNDRMF will assess, prioritize, sequence, and monitor the interventions. \n \n14. \nOutput  3:  Analytical  work  and  products  to  improve  the  fiscal  management  of \ndisaster risk  completed. The NDRMF will carry out quantitative risk modeling analysis for the \nprimary natural hazards faced by Pakistan and develop a comprehensive national DRF strategy \nbased on the analysis results. The risk modeling work will be used to derive disaster risk maps \nand quantitative national and subnational information on the expected levels of loss for hazard \nevents  of  varying  types,  intensities,  and  return  periods.  The  NDRMF  will  then  identify \n                                                \n10 The endowment fund is projected to generate income of $9.17 million in 2017, $9.76 million in 2018, $10.38 million \nin 2019, $10.88 million in 2020, and $11.44 million in 2021. Annual average operating expenses for the NDRMF \nare projected at $2.5 million. \n\n(iii)  delivering  nonstructural  preventive  measures, \n\n11 The NDRMF will prepare the accreditation criteria following the requirements set out in the project administration \n\nmanual (PAM), which will be approved by the NDRMF\u2019s board of directors and ADB. \n\n12 The  subproject  selection  criteria  are  provided  in  the  PAM,  which  will  be  further  refined  and  approved  by  the \nNDRMF\u2019s board of directors. Subproject selection criteria include (i) the inclusion of the subprojects in the NDMP \nor  NFFP-IV,  (ii)  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  at  least  12%  for  works  and  equipment  subprojects,  (iii) \nfinancial sustainability of the subprojects in the form of assured provision of operation and maintenance funds, and \n(iv) compliance with ADB safeguard requirements. \n\n\fappropriate  DRF  tools,  including  insurance  mechanisms,  for  each  layer  of  loss  based  on  the \ncombined  multi-hazard  loss  curves  to  strengthen  the  country\u2019s  DRM  capability.  The  tools  will \nalso take into account (i) the scale of funding required for each layer of loss; (ii) the speed with \nwhich  post-disaster  funding  is  required  for  relief,  early  recovery,  and  reconstruction  purposes; \n(iii)  the  relative  cost-effectiveness  of  alternative  instruments  for  specific  layers  of  loss;  (iv)  the \nparticular  disaster-related  needs  of  vulnerable  groups;  and  (v)  the  contribution  to  long-term \ndisaster resilience. This output will support the development of two priority financing instruments \nidentified in the national DRF strategy and initiate the pilot testing of one of them.13 \n \nD. \n \n15. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $256.6 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nTable 1: Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \nNDRMF = National Disaster Risk Management Fund. \na  Includes  taxes  and  duties  of  $17.5  million  to  be  financed  from  government  resources  and  fund  implementation \n\nBase Costb \n1.

Eligible  FIPs  that \nmeet  the  accreditation  criteria  will  provide  at  least  30%  of  counterpart  financing.  Cofinancing \npartners  may  contribute  directly  to  the  NDRMF  or  provide  resources  for  NDRMF  activities \nthrough the government or a trust fund arrangement with ADB. The NDRMF may also facilitate \nrisk-sharing and risk-transfer arrangements. The risk-financing arrangement could also support \ndistribution and administrative costs and provide capital reserves for a pool. The financial flows \nare illustrated in the figure. \n\n                                                \n14 ADB is in discussion with other development partners to provide additional cofinancing. \n15 Excluding interest during construction and commitment charges. \n\n \n\n\fThe  project  is  intended  to  be  the  first  phase  of  a  longer-term  partnership  between  the \n18. \ngovernment  and  ADB  to  comprehensively  address  key  DRM  and  DRF  issues.  Based  on  the \nimplementation  progress  and  future  satisfactory  appraisals,  and  subject  to  further  Board \napproval,  ADB  will  consider  further  financing  requests  from  the  government  to  provide  up  to \n$1 billion  through  additional  financing  during  2018\u20132023,  to  contribute  to  the  $3  billion \nrequirement to finance the implementation of the future NDMP and NFPP-IV. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n19. \nExecuting  and  implementing  agencies.  The  Economic  Affairs  Division  (EAD)  of  the \nMinistry of Finance, Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics and Privatization will be the executing \nagency and the NDRMF will be the implementing agency for the project. The NDRMF is in the \nprocess of being incorporated as a not-for-profit association under section 42 of the Companies \nOrdinance, 1984 (governance arrangements are in para. 26).16 The EAD will ensure that (i) the \nNDRMF performs in line with its mandate; (ii) the transfer of contributions from contributors and \ngovernment  counterpart  funding  to  NDRMF  accounts  is  done  in  a  timely  manner;  (iii)  all \ncontribution agreements signed between the executing agency and the contributors for NDRMF \noperations  are  implemented;  and  (iv)  a  review  of  the  NDRMF\u2019s  performance  is  done  regularly \nand reported to ADB. \n \nRole  of  the  National  Disaster  Risk  Management  Fund.  The  NDRMF  will  provide \n20. \nfinancial  and  technical  support  to  government  and  nongovernment  partners  to  implement  the \nNDMP and NFFP-IV. It will assess and prioritize subprojects for which ongranting is requested. \nThe  NDRMF  will  (i)  adopt  acceptable  corporate  and  financial  governance  and  management \npractices  (e.g.,  the  Code  of  Corporate  Governance,  2012);  (ii)  have  its  accounts  and  financial \nstatements audited annually by independent auditors in a manner acceptable to ADB; (iii) have \nadequate  policies,  systems,  and  procedures  to  assess  and  monitor  subprojects\u2019  economic, \nsocial,  and  environmental  impacts  (e.g.,  adopt  an  environmental  and  social  management \nsystem  [ESMS],  and  prepare  necessary  safeguard  documents,  where  applicable);  and  (iv) \nensure that an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of at least 12% for works and equipment \nsubprojects  is  achieved.  The  NDRMF  will  also  monitor  the  implementation  performance  of \napproved subprojects. \n \n21. \nProcurement.  The  NDRMF  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as \namended from time to time) in all institutional procurement, and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) in engaging the consulting services of firms \nand individuals. ADB procurement guidelines applicable to financial intermediaries will apply to \nthe  funds  ongranted  to  FIPs  (para.  17).  ADB  will  engage  a  TA-financed  consultant  to  provide \ninstitutional procurement support to the NDRMF during the start-up phase of its operations. The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).17 \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n16 A company incorporated as a government-owned, not-for-profit association under section 42 of the government\u2019s \nCompanies  Ordinance,  1984  enjoys  all  privileges  and  is  subject  to  all  obligations  of  a  limited  company. \nGovernment-owned section 42 companies have to comply with the Code of Corporate Governance, 2012, which is \na robust governance framework. \n\n17 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Executing agency \n\n(ii)   Implementing agency \n\nProcurement \nConsulting services \n\nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n24 November 2016\u201317 November 2019 \n17 November 2019 (loan closing date is 17 May 2020) \n\n10 contracts \n636 person-months \n\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Ministry of Finance, Revenue, \nEconomic Affairs, Statistics and Privatization \nNational Disaster Risk Management Fund \nShopping \nQCBS: 4 contracts \nLCS: 2 contracts \nIndividual \nconsultants \nThe loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government and \nADB. \n\n$0.7 million \n$10.8 million \n\n352 person-months \n\n$2.3 million \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, LCS = least-cost selection, QCBS = quality and cost-based selection. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nto \n\nthe  project \n\nA  capacity  development  TA  will  be  associated  with \n\n22. \nfast-track \nimplementation. The TA will support the establishment of the NDRMF\u2019s core functions, including \nthe  development  of  (i)  quality  control  and  subproject  review  parameters;  and  (ii)  NDRMF \npolicies,  bylaws,  and  systems  for  auditing,  financial  management  and  control,  procurement, \nsafeguards,  and  gender  considerations  to  speed  up  the  start-up  process.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over 36 months from 10 December 2016. The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, \nof  which  $1.0 million  will  be financed  on  a grant basis  by  ADB\u2019s Technical  Assistance  Special \nFund (TASF-V). The EAD will be the executing agency of the TA. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The TA \nwill  finance  4  person-months  of  individual  international  consultants  and  136  person-months  of \nindividual national consultants. ADB will engage the consultants following its Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will \nfollow  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).18 \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n23. \nThe  NDRMF\u2019s  management  team  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  technical  due \ndiligence  of  subprojects  to  be  considered  for  NDRMF  financing.  They  will  conduct  technical \ncapacity  reviews  of  potential  FIPs  for  accreditation  and  undertake  technical  reviews  of  all \nsubproject proposals received from FIPs based on subproject selection and prioritization criteria \nprovided  in  the  PAM  (footnote  17).  The  NDRMF  technical  staff  will  leverage  the  capacity  and \ninstitutional knowledge developed in Pakistan during the implementation of the large portfolio of \nDRM projects by ADB and other development partners, some of which are ongoing, through the \nNDRMF\u2019s  roster  of  experts.  To  fast-track  implementation  and  reduce  up-front  risks,  the  first \ngroup  of  subprojects  will  be  undertaken  with  entities  that  have  ongoing  or  completed  DRM \nprojects financed by ADB and key multilateral development partners. The experts hired through \n\n                                                \n18 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fthe associated TA will conduct a third level of due diligence to provide an independent review of \nthe quality and quantity of work completed by the FIPs. They will report directly to ADB. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nA  comprehensive  economic  analysis  was  conducted  to  estimate  the  net  present  value \nand EIRR of the $257 million investment. The project team evaluated the benefits of a sample of \nsubprojects  proposed  in  the  NDMP  by  considering  the  losses  averted  because  of  the \nimplementation  of  flood  protection  works,  early  warning  systems,  and  community-based  DRM \nactivities. The EIRR estimated for the project is at least 16.83% and NPV is positive. The EIRR \nof  the  project  exceeds  the  ADB  benchmark  of  12.00%. For  the  purpose  of  the  analysis,  the \nopportunity cost of the endowment investment is included as a project cost. The NDRMF should \nassess  individual  DRR  subprojects  and target  investments  with  high  EIRRs  of  at  least  12% to \nbe eligible for financing. \n \n25. \nTo ensure its financial sustainability, the NDRMF will establish an endowment fund with \nan  initial  capitalization  of  $123.3  million  in  its  first  year.  By  2021,  the  endowment  fund  is \nprojected  to  generate  $51.6  million  in  income  from  short-  and  long-term  investments  to  cover \noperational  expenses  as  well  as  reserve  buildup. 19 The  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the \nNDRMF\u2019s projected cash flows are well insulated against adverse systemic developments, such \nas  the  return  on  investment  declining  or  operating  expenses  increasing  due  to  inflationary \nand/or cost pressures. Even in the significantly restrictive and unlikely scenario of both negative \ndevelopments taking place simultaneously, the NDRMF\u2019s sustainability remains protected. The \nNDRMF\u2019s endowed capital allocation ensures stable and sustained operations and a buildup of \nreserves to maintain nonstructural DRM activities even if fund inflows dry out. The NDRMF will \nalso  prepare  a  resource  mobilization  strategy  to  solicit  private  funding  actively  from  domestic \nand international sources to leverage the financing provided by ADB and the government. This \neffort  will  target  corporations,  multinationals,  global  climate  funds,  and  high  net  worth \nindividuals.  The  NDRMF  may  charge  a  management  fee  to  defray  incremental  administrative \ncosts  so  that  partnerships  do  not  increase  existing  operating  expenses  and  prevent \nintermediation costs of core operations from increasing. An investment management policy will \nbe prepared to guide the NDRMF\u2019s investment activities. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nThe NDRMF will be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan \nand  will  be  subject  to  extensive  statutory  governance  and  reporting  requirements  under  the \nCompanies  Ordinance,  1984  and  relevant  rules.  The  NDRMF  will  have  a  robust  governance \nand management structure comprising a general body of 40 members, a board of directors with \n12\u201315 members, and a management team headed by a chief executive officer.20 To ensure the \nsuccess of the new entity, ADB will provide TA support (para. 22). \n \n27. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  confirmed  that  the  government\u2019s \nbudgetary,  accounting,  and  financial  reporting  and  auditing  systems  and  procedures  are \nfunctioning effectively. The FMA noted that an internal audit function will have to be established \nat  the  NDRMF,  which  also  needs  to  prioritize  hiring  and  putting  in  place  adequate  accounting \nand  finance  staff.  Various  risks  and  mitigation  measures  are  included  in  the  FMA,  while  key \nrisks  are  set  out  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 21  Overall,  the  FMA \n                                                \n19 The NDRMF\u2019s estimated annual operating expenses average $2.5 million for 2017\u20132021. \n20 A detailed description of the NDRMF\u2019s governance structure is in the PAM. \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fassessed the pre-mitigation financial management risk as substantial. The FMA highlighted key \nissues such as the need for adequate staffing of the NDRMF, capacity building of NDRMF staff, \nand  operationalization  of  the  internal  audit  function.    During  the  first  6  months,  the  associated \nTA  will  help  the  NDRMF  set  up,  strengthen,  and  fully  operationalize  the  NDRMF\u2019s  core \nfunctions, including financial management. \n \n28. \nOther than institutional procurement by the NDRMF, all procurement will be done by the \nFIPs,  which  will  be  required  to  follow  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  During  the \nfirst 6 months of its operations, the NDRMF will prepare a procurement procedural manual and \nalso  put  in  place  a  procurement  framework  describing  (i)  functional  responsibilities  and \naccountabilities  for  procurement  activities;  (ii)  procurement  systems  and  processes,  including \nguidance  on  anticorruption  policies  and  conflicts  of  interest;  (iii)  procurement  skills;  and  (iv)  a \ncapacity  review  process.  These  processes  and  systems  are  subject  to  ADB  review  and \napproval. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  EAD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n30. \nAlthough  the  project  is  classified  general  intervention,  it  will  directly  benefit  poor  and \nvulnerable  people  living  in  high-risk  areas.  The  NDRMF  will  finance  (i)  the  carrying  out  of \nnational  and  subnational  multi-hazard  vulnerability  risk  assessments  in  20  vulnerable  districts \nand  urban  centers,  which  will  help  develop  informed  DRM  plans  targeting  vulnerable \npopulations; (ii) the retrofitting of social infrastructure (e.g., public schools and health facilities) \nthat predominantly serve low-income groups; and (iii) the development of emergency response \nplans and early warning systems in highly vulnerable districts of the country. \n \n31. \nThe project is classified effective gender mainstreaming, with key measures indicated in \nthe  gender  action  plan. 22 The  NDRMF  will  establish  appropriate  procedures, 23 policies,  and \nsystems;  and  build  institutional  capacity  in  gender-responsive  DRR  and  disaster  response \nsystems.24 NDRMF\u2019s core staff will comprise at least 20% women and will include a social and \ngender  officer  responsible  for  implementing  and  monitoring  the  project\u2019s  social,  poverty,  and \ngender  dimensions.  The  NDRMF  will  recruit  a  short-term  expert  to  guide,  review,  and  support \ngender activities and plans. TA-financed gender experts will (i) develop the monitoring systems, \npolicies, and guidelines for social and gender-related plans; (ii) develop NDRMF staff capacity; \nand (iii) independently assess the gender impacts. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n32. \nThe  project  is  classified  financial  intermediary  for  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. The project will not finance any category A subprojects. \nNo  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated,  as  most  civil  works  will  involve \nretrofitting or rehabilitating existing facilities. Negative impacts during construction will likely be \nshort  term,  site-specific,  and  mitigable.  Proposals  that  involve  no  or  limited  involuntary \n\n                                                \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Procedures that outline the gender-based review process of subprojects. \n24 Gender  policy,  including  key  instruments  for  DRM  operations,  includes  gender  mainstreaming  criteria  for  the \nscreening and approval of proposals. The criteria are aligned with the following: Government of Pakistan, National \nDisaster Management Authority. 2014. National Policy Guidelines on Vulnerable Groups in Disasters. Islamabad. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fresettlement  impacts  will  be  prioritized.  No  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  anticipated.  An \nESMS document has been prepared. The project may finance subprojects classified category B \nfor  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  in  line  with  the \nrequirements set out in the ESMS document. The TA consultants will provide initial support to \nimplement  the  measures  outlined  in  the  ESMS.  ADB  may  tap  a  pool  of  NDRMF  safeguard \nexperts  to  help  conduct  safeguard  reviews  of  proposals  and  implement  safeguard  plans  in \nsubprojects. The NDRMF will adopt an ESMS satisfactory to ADB before the first disbursement \nfor the financing of subprojects. ADB will audit the ESMS annually and review it semiannually. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan  (footnote  21).  The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the cost of the risk mitigating measures. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe NDRMF lacks \nan internal audit \nfunction. \n\nThe NDRMF suffers \nfrom inadequate \nfinancial \nmanagement, \nprocurement, and \nsafeguard systems. \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe NDRMF will establish an independent internal audit function. Within the first \n6 months of NDRMF operations, an internal auditor with strong audit experience \nand qualifications will be appointed at a senior staff level, and will report to the \nAudit Committee of the NDRMF\u2019s board of directors. \nThe TA will help the NDRMF (i) establish an efficient financial management \nsystem meeting all statutory requirements of the SECP and the standards of \nADB and the NDRMF\u2019s contributors; (ii) prepare standard procurement \ndocuments and procurement review procedures, and build procurement \ncapacity; (iii) establish disbursement and fund flow protocols; (iv) establish \nsafeguard systems and procedures satisfactory to ADB; and (v) develop and \ninstitutionalize a reporting and monitoring system. ADB will also establish a \nmultisector team comprising ADB staff and experts recruited under the TA to \noversee and guide the NDRMF\u2019s day-to-day activities, and will undertake \ndetailed quarterly review missions to evaluate the NDRMF\u2019s performance and \nprogress. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  NDRMF  =  National  Disaster  Risk  Management  Fund,  SECP  =  Securities  and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan, TA = technical assistance.  \nSource: ADB \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\n34. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan documents. \n \n35. \nset forth in the loan and grant agreements. \n \n36. \nThe  conditions  for  loan  and  grant  effectiveness  are  that  (i)  the  NDRMF  has  been \nincorporated as a not-for-profit association under section 42 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984; \nand  (ii)  the  project  agreement,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  has  been  duly \nexecuted  and  become fully  effective  and  legally  binding  on the  NDRMF  in  accordance  with  its \nterms. \n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fThe  conditions  for  loan  and  grant  disbursement  are  that  (i)  the  NDRMF  has  appointed \n37. \nfinancing  and  accounting  specialists \nfinance  and  accounts  departments,  with \nits \nqualifications, experience, and expertise acceptable to ADB; (ii) the subsidiary grant agreement, \nin  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  has  been  duly  executed  between  the  government \nand  the  NDRMF;  and  (iii)  the  NDRMF  has  established  an  ESMS,  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to \nADB, before any disbursement is made for an eligible subproject. \n \n\nfor \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n38. \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $75,000,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  National \nDisaster  Risk  Management  Fund,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with \ninterest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  for  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard; and \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR90,180,000  to  the  Islamic \nRepublic  of  Pakistan  for  the  National  Disaster  Risk  Management  Fund,  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  2%  per \nannum during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n\n \n \n \n2 November 2016 \n\n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned With \nA more disaster-resilient Pakistan with reduced socioeconomic and fiscal vulnerability to natural hazards \nand  climate  variability  and  change  (National  Disaster  Management  Plan,  2012\u20132022  and  draft  National \nFlood Protection Plan IV, 2016\u20132026)a \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets \nand Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nIncreased and \nsustainable \ninstitutional and \nphysical capacity \nto reduce the \nsocioeconomic \nand fiscal impacts \nof natural hazards \nand climate \nchange \n\nOutputs \n1.
