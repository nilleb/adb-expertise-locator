The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has \nsupported the development of the financial sector through loans \nand TA. The first phase of comprehensive financial reforms was \nlaunched in 1996 against the backdrop of a fragile banking sector \nwith a number of illiquid and insolvent banks. Supported by ADB\u2019s \nFinancial Sector Program Loan (FSPL I), these reforms focused \nprimarily  on  bank  restructuring  and  resolution,  strengthening \nprudential  regulations  and  supervision,  and,  more  generally, \ndeveloping  a  market-oriented  banking  sector.  The  Second \nFinancial Sector Program Loan (FSPL II) supported the upgrading \nof  management  information  system  (MIS)  in  banks,  the \nintroduction of the interbank market, and the development of a \nbasic legal and regulatory framework for the nonbank financial \n(NBF) sector. \n ", "ii   \n  As a result of these reforms, the financial sector has stabilized \nand  strengthened  since  the  1990s\u2019  banking  crises.  Key \nachievements  include  restructuring  and  privatization  of  state-\nowned  banks,  interest  rate  liberalization,  development  of  an \ninterbank market, and strengthening of the banking legislation and \nregulations. At the same time, the basic infrastructure to develop \nthe  NBF  sector\u2014including  the  securities  market,  nonbank \nfinancial institutions (NBFIs), insurance companies, and savings \nand credit cooperatives (SCCs)\u2014has been put in place.  \n \n  Developing a well-functioning and broad-based financial system, \nhowever, is a gradual process, especially in transition economies \nwith limited market-based institutions and human resources. While \nbank deposits and loans have increased significantly in recent \nyears,  interest  rates  remain  high  and  deposits  and  loans  are \nmostly short term. The lack of an effective collateral framework, \nincluding weaknesses in debt enforcement and the high cost of \ncollateral  registration,  increases  the  cost  of  borrowing.  Weak \ncorporate governance in banks and the lack of an effective anti-\nmoney-laundering (AML) system undermine depositor protection.  \n \n  The NBF sector\u2019s development has been hampered by legal and \nregulatory  weaknesses,  inefficient  regulatory  structure,  policy \ndistortions, and low investor confidence. While SCCs have grown \nrapidly in recent years, many are believed to be engaged in risky \nand unsustainable activities. Financial services provided by NBFIs \nare largely limited to short-term consumer loans. The range of \ninsurance products is narrow and the payout ratio (claims paid as \na percentage of total premiums) is low. Progress in developing the \ncapital market has been limited.  \n \n  The  Government\u2019s  Action  Plan  for  2004\u20132008  highlights  the \nfinancial sector\u2019s role in ensuring a growth rate of about 6% over \nthe medium term. The plan therefore emphasizes the importance \nof  continued  reforms  to  develop  a  stable  and  broad-based \nfinancial sector. Specifically, it sets out to (i) consolidate financial \nsector stabilization, (ii) strengthen the stock exchange to mobilize \nsavings for productive investments, and (iii) develop a broader \nrange of financial services and instruments. \n \n  The country strategy and program (CSP) for Mongolia identifies \nthe underdevelopment of the financial sector and limited access of \nhouseholds and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to \nfinancial  services  as  key  impediments  to  private  sector-led \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. A sound financial system \nwith  improved  efficiency  and  outreach  is  a  key  medium-term \noutcome envisioned in the CSP.  \n ", "  iii\n  Building on the progress achieved under the FSPL I and II, the \nFRGP aims to help develop a sound and broad-based financial \nsector, through a holistic approach to address the remaining legal \nand regulatory, institutional, and policy constraints. A broad-based \nfinancial  system  comprising  banks,  NBFIs,  SCCs,  securities \nmarkets, and the insurance sector reduces the risks associated \nwith  over-reliance  on  the  banking  system,  and  increases  the \nsupply of long-term capital for productive investment. It will, in \nturn, promote growth and create jobs. Increased competition from \nalternative  sources  of  financial  intermediation  will  enhance \nefficiency, and the financial system as a whole will become more \nresilient to exogenous shocks. \n \n  The reforms proposed under the FRGP are fully in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s  priorities  and  medium-term  objectives.  Program \ndesign has benefited from the lessons learned from the FSPL I \nand II, and Mongolia\u2019s recent strong economic performance is \nconducive to the implementation of the proposed reforms. \n   \nObjectives  The FRGP\u2019s objective is to help develop a sound and broad-\nbased  financial  sector  that  effectively  channels  resources  to \nproductive investment projects. Specifically, the FRGP will seek to \n(i) reduce the cost of borrowing and expand access to credit by \nimproving  the  collateral  framework,  (ii)  improve  governance  in \nbanks to protect depositors, (iii) enhance the role of the NBF \nsector  in  mobilizing  savings  for  investment  capital,  and  (iv) \nimprove investor confidence by reducing the risks from money \nlaundering through the financial system. The FRGP is designed \nas a continuation of the FSPL II, and will build on the progress \nachieved under the FSPL I and II.  \n \n  The FRGP\u2019s banking sector reforms will aim to reduce the cost of \nborrowing  and  expand  access  to  credit  by  facilitating  debt \nrecovery  by  banks  and  by  lowering  the  cost  of  collateral \nregistration. This component will introduce legal and regulatory \nchanges  to  strengthen  corporate  governance  in  banks  and  to \nimprove the supervision of groups and conglomerates that control \nfinancial institutions. The NBF reforms will seek to enhance the \nsector\u2019s role in mobilizing and allocating resources by developing \nthe  legal  and  regulatory  framework;  strengthening  regulatory \ncapacity by establishing a single regulator for the NBF sector\u2014the \nNonbank  Financial  Regulatory  Commission  (NBFRC);  and \nstrengthening corporate governance and investor protection. This \ncomponent will also aim to reduce the distortionary impact of tax \npolicies on the financial sector. The AML component will seek to \nmitigate the risks from money laundering by developing the legal \nand  regulatory  framework,  and  by  establishing  a  financial \nintelligence unit (FIU) in the Bank of Mongolia (BOM).  \n \n ", "iv   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms \nunder the FRGP by providing a loan of SDR6,917,000 ($10 million \nequivalent). The Borrower will be Mongolia. The loan will be from \nthe ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a term of \n24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nyear for the remaining period. The loan proceeds are expected to \nbe used over 48 months from the date of effectiveness. \n   \nProgram Period and  The program period will be 4 years. The loan will be released in \nTranching  two  equal  tranches.  The  first,  SDR3,458,500  ($5  million \nequivalent), will be released upon loan effectiveness. The second, \nSDR3,458,500 ($5 million equivalent), will be released 24 months \nafter  Board  approval,  subject  to  the  Government  meeting  the \nconditions specified for its release. \n   \nExecuting and  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for \nImplementing Agencies  the loan. BOM will be the Implementing Agency for the banking \nsector and AML components. NBFRC will be the Implementing \nAgency for the NBF sector component.  \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange \ncost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries \n(other than the items specified in the list of ineligible items and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources). The \nGovernment will certify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds \nthe amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursement under the loan for \nthe period. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan \nproceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s \ncertification. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  local  currency  funds \ngenerated by the program loan will be used, first, to support the \nadjustment  cost  of  reforms  under  the  FRGP,  and  second,  to \nfinance  expenditures  for  general  development  purposes  of \nMongolia. \n   \nRisks and Safeguards  Poor management of the transition to NBFRC is a key risk. A \nnumber of measures have been taken to facilitate a timely and \norderly transition. An overall strategy and a detailed time-bound \naction plan have been prepared in close consultation with the \nGovernment  and  other  key  stakeholders.  During  program \npreparation, considerable efforts were made to reach a common \nunderstanding  and  consensus  among  different  government \nagencies on the objectives and structure of NBFRC. BOM has \ncommitted to transfer at least eight qualified staff members to \nNBFRC, and the Government has agreed to allocate budget to \nensure an adequate pool of qualified professional staff to conduct \nregulatory, supervisory, and enforcement functions. The attached \nTA will provide policy and technical guidance and training for a \nsmooth transition. \n ", "  v\n  Another risk is that the introduction of new legislation and legal \namendments will be delayed significantly and/or will not fully meet \nthe  program  objectives.  Inconsistencies  among  different  laws \ncould create confusion and loopholes. This risk is minimized to the \nextent that many of the laws to be enacted during the FRGP were \ndrafted during program preparation or under other ADB projects. \nIn line with the recommendation of the program completion report \nfor  the  FSPL  II,  stakeholder  consultations  were  held  during \nprogram preparation to ensure that the expected outcomes of the \nlegal  reforms  are  fully  understood.  A  number  of  crucial  laws, \nincluding those related to the collateral framework, tax reforms, \nand the establishment of NBFRC, have either been enacted or \nsubmitted to Parliament. The attached TA will support the legal \nreforms and ensure that any revisions made by the Government \ndo not undermine the laws\u2019 effectiveness. \n \n  Resistance from vested interests to certain reforms is a potential \nrisk, and is particularly relevant to the AML and tax reforms. The \nGovernment has expressed strong commitment to implementing \nAML reforms, and has prepared a draft AML law. Submission of \nthe law to Parliament is a condition for loan effectiveness. An \nongoing TA is helping develop implementing regulations and a \nblueprint for information technology and reporting requirements, \nand  is  providing  related  training  to  government  agencies  and \nfinancial institutions. This will help facilitate the implementation of \nthe  FRGP\u2019s  AML  component.  With  assistance  from  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  (USAID),  the  Government  has \nprepared a reform proposal to improve the efficiency of the overall \ntax system. The Corporate Income Tax Law recently submitted to \nParliament incorporates measures to reduce tax impediments to \nNBF  development.  ADB,  IMF,  and  USAID  should  continue  to \ncoordinate with each other to ensure satisfactory implementation \nof these tax reforms. \n \n ", "vi   \nTechnical Assistance  The TA\u2019s purpose is to support the FRGP\u2019s policy reforms, and to \nstrengthen the capacities of NBFRC and the FIU. Specifically, the \nTA will help the Government (i) implement the procedures for non-\njudicial  foreclosure  of  collateral;  (ii)  establish  NBFRC  by \ndeveloping transition arrangements, organizational structure, and \ninternal procedures; (iii) draft laws and regulations to address the \nweaknesses  and  gaps  in  the  legal  framework;  (iv)  introduce \ncorporate governance structure and practices in banks, nonbank \nfinancial  intermediaries,  and  securities  issuers;  (v)  develop \ninformation technology-management information system (IT-MIS) \nin NBFRC and the FIU; and (vi) provide capacity-building training \nin financial regulation; on-site and off-site supervision; accounting, \nauditing, and reporting standards; and IT-MIS. The total TA cost is \nestimated at $1,120,000, of which ADB will finance $900,000 on a \ngrant  basis  through  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. MOF will be the Executing Agency, and \nBOM and NBFRC will be the implementing agencies. The TA will \nrequire  a  total  of  63  person-months\u2019  consulting  services  (23 \nperson-months\u2019  international  and  40  person-months\u2019  national). \nThe consultants will be recruited by ADB through firms, selected \nunder the quality- and cost-based selection method, using the \nsimplified technical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB on the engagement of national consultants. \n \n \n \n ", "(cid:57)(cid:54)(cid:111)(cid:32)(cid:32)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:39)(cid:69)

\nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Mongolia for the Financial Regulation and Governance Program (FRGP). The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Building  for  Financial  Sector \nReforms, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n2.  Following a sharp decline in output during the early transition period, the economy \nreturned to a positive growth rate in 1994, and grew by 3.9% annually from 1994 to 1999. The \nrelatively quick economic recovery reflected favorable international copper and cashmere prices \nand the efficiency gains from market-oriented reforms. Demonstrating the country\u2019s vulnerability \nto exogenous shocks, the annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate dropped to 1% in \n2001 as international copper prices fell and consecutive harsh winters and an outbreak of foot \nand mouth disease led to sharp decline in agricultural output. Boosted by strong growth in \nagriculture and mining\u2014which jointly account for 30% of GDP\u2014the annual growth rate climbed \nfrom 1.0% in 2001 to 10.6% in 2004. After many years of moderation, inflation surged in the first \nhalf of 2005, and reached 17.5% in June 2005, reflecting large increases in oil and meat prices. \nWhile it declined as the impact of the food price shock was undone, inflation remains high at \n11.5%. \n   \n3.  Supported by favorable terms of trade, better-than-expected gold volume, and capital \ninflows reflecting the recovery in tourism and increasing remittances, the current account shifted \nto a small surplus in 2004, from a deficit of 7.8% in 2003. The budget deficit narrowed from \n7.7%  of  GDP  in  2000  to  2%  in  2004,  reflecting  strong  growth  and  a  boom  in  minerals. \nMongolia\u2019s reform process has been underpinned by development aid, and the debt level \nstands at about 91% of GDP. Since most of the debt consists of loans from multilateral or \nbilateral sources on concessional terms, however, the debt level is deemed manageable.  \n \n4.  The benefits of economic growth are not evenly distributed, as indicated by income \ninequality and persistent poverty; 36% of Mongolians live under the national poverty line. High \nunemployment (14.2%) and underemployment caused by a mismatch of skills stand as the main \ncauses of poverty. Services are the main source of employment, followed by agriculture and \nindustry. \n \n5.  The boom in mining investment is expected to continue, given the strong prospects for \nnew exploration in the Gobi desert and strong demand from the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nGrowth is expected to settle at about 5% over the next 2 or 3 years, and with the appropriate \nmonetary policy, inflation is forecast to slow down to about 5% in 2006. However, sustained \ngrowth faces a number of constraints. The narrow economic base and high dependence on \ncommodity  production  and  trade  make  the  country  vulnerable  to  exogenous  shocks. \nFragmented domestic markets and geographic isolation hinder growth. Manufacturing sector \ngrowth is constrained by the prevalent use of old technology and limited human resources.  \n \n \n ", "2               \n6.  The Government\u2019s Action Plan for 2004\u20132008 highlights the importance of continued \nfinancial  sector  reforms  in  ensuring  a  growth  rate  of  about  6%  over  the  medium  term.1  \nAccordingly, the plan sets out to (i) consolidate financial sector stabilization, (ii) strengthen the \nstock exchange to mobilize savings for productive investments, and (iii) develop a broader \nrange of financial services and instruments.  \n \n7.  The  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)2  for  Mongolia  identifies  financial \nunderdevelopment as a main constraint on private sector-led economic growth and poverty \nreduction. The banking sector has stabilized and strengthened since the 1990s\u2019 crises, and the \nGovernment has started to build the basic foundation for the nonbank financial (NBF) sector. \nHowever, the financial sector\u2019s role in promoting economic growth has been limited. The cost of \nborrowing is high and financial outreach limited. The lack of long-term funding sources limits \nproductive investment. There are few savings instruments and insurance products. A sound \nfinancial  system  with  improved  efficiency  and  outreach  is  a  key  medium-term  outcome \nenvisioned in the CSP. \n \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \nA.  Sector Description and Performance3  \n8.  The financial sector comprises the banking sector, and the NBF sector, which includes \nnonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs),  savings  and  credit  cooperatives  (SCCs),  securities \nmarkets and intermediaries, and insurance companies. The banking sector has grown rapidly in \nrecent years, and bank deposits and assets as percentage of GDP are the highest in the region \n(Table 1). However, at 11.2%, the interest rate spread is high, and nonperforming loans (NPLs) \nhave increased since 2001. While the NBF sector has grown in recent years, it is significantly \nsmaller  than  the  banking  sector,  and  does  not  yet  play  a  meaningful  role  in  financial \nintermediation. The excessive reliance on the banking sector makes the economy vulnerable to \nshocks. \n \nTable 1: Summary Statistics for Selected Transition Economiesa\nNo. of  Interest  Loans (% of total  No. of Insurance No. of Listed  No. of Credit  Broad  Bank  Bank  Insurance Equity Market \nCountry Banks spreadb loan) Companies Companies Associations Money Assets Deposits Premium Capitalization\n% of GDP\nMongolia 17 11.2 11 23 395 570 47 61 39 0.5 1.4\nArmenia 20 14 7.2 24 196 - 15 19 6 0.4 0.8\nAzerbaijan 42 8.9 8.2 29 0c 28 18 18 12 0.8 0.1\nKazakhstan 35 9 13.1 36 69 52 21 49 30 0.7 7.5\nKyrgyz \nRepublic 19 22.6 7 12 6 306 18 19 8.6 0.2 1.5\nGDP = gross domestic product, No. = number.\na Data are for 2003 or 2004, depending on availability.\nb Difference between average lending rate and average deposit rate.\nc Eighty-five companies are admitted for trading, but none are listed on the stock exchange.\nSources: National Authorities, IMF International Financial Statistics, Financial Sector Stability Assessments, Article IV Consultation Reports, EBRD Transition Report 2004.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Government of Mongolia. 2004.

Manila. \n3 A detailed sector analysis is in Appendix 1. \n ", "    3 \n1.  Banking Sector \n9.  The banking sector has strengthened considerably since the 1990s\u2019 crises. With total \nassets of MNT1.1 trillion or 61% of GDP, the banking system dominates the financial sector. Of \nthe 17 commercial banks, 1 is state-owned (Savings Bank), and 4 have foreign ownership.4 \nExcept for one Russian bank branch, no foreign banks are licensed to operate in Mongolia. The \nbanking sector is highly concentrated, with the four largest banks accounting for 61% of total \nbanking assets, and 69% of deposits. In 2006, the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) will increase \nminimum capital requirements of banks from the current MNT4 billion to MNT8 billion. This is \nexpected  to  drive  consolidation  within  the  sector  as  only  three  banks  have  capital  levels \nexceeding MNT8 billion. \n \n10.  Deposits and loans as a share of GDP grew from 14% and 8% in 1999 to 39% and 35% \nin 2004. Bank deposits and loans are mostly short-term, with maturities of less than 1 year. \nWhile interest rates are trending down, they remain high. The deposit and lending rates of \nbanks were about 14% and 25% in 2004. High interest spreads are symptomatic of high credit \nrisk, high operating costs of banks, strong demand for bank loans because of a lack of other \nfunding sources, and lack of effective competition among banks. \n \n11.  The ratio of total capital to assets of the banking sector increased from below 4% in \n1998 to 15% in 2004, and the entire banking sector has been profitable for the past 5 years \n(2000\u20132004). The NPL ratio declined from 54% in 1999 to 8% in 2001 and then stayed at 7\u2013\n11% until 2004. The loan loss reserves are provisioned in line with the BOM guidelines, and \nstand at a high level. While the rapid increase in bank loans during 2001\u20132003 raised concerns, \ncredit expansion slowed down in 2004. Credit expanded by 88% annually during 2001\u20132003 \nand grew by 44% in 2004. However, the NPL ratio increased from 7% in 2002 to 8% in 2003 \nand to 11% in 2004, reflecting poor performance of the loans recently extended and weak \ninternal control and risk assessment capacities in banks.  \n \n2.  Nonbank Financial Institutions  \n12.  The term NBFI refers to a licensee under the Law on Nonbank Financial Activities \n(2002).  The  activities  covered  under  this  law  include  lending,  factoring,  leasing,  issuing \nguarantees, issuing payment instruments, electronic payments and remittance services, foreign \nexchange services, trust services, investment in short-term financial instruments, and advisory \nservices. Each NBFI is licensed for one or more activities, but there is no overall license to be \nan NBFI. NBFIs are not allowed to take deposits. While most of the smaller NBFIs are financed \nby equity, some large ones have significant loan financing and accrued interests. \n \n13.  The number, loans, and total assets of NBFIs have grown rapidly since 2000, when \nMongol Credit was established as the first licensed NBFI. Of the 114 NBFIs registered in 2004, \n9 were foreign-owned or joint ventures. Most NBFIs provide small consumer loans, or short-\nterm loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and a handful are engaged in other \nactivities such as leasing and foreign exchange trading. NBFIs are incorporated as limited \nliability companies, and are typically owned by an individual, a family, or a small group of related \nindividuals. With total assets of MNT28.7 billion, NBFIs as a group account for about 2.6% of \nbanking sector assets. NBFIs\u2019 NPLs are 4.5% of total loans. \n \n                                                 \n4 Chinggis Bank, Khan Bank (previously Agriculture Bank), Trade and Development Bank, and Xac Bank. \n ", "4               \n3.  Savings and Credit Cooperatives  \n14.  SCCs are established under the Law on Cooperatives to provide saving and lending \nservices to members. While SCCs have to register with the General Department of National \nTaxation (GDNT), they are not required to obtain a license from a financial regulator. The \nnumber of SCCs has dramatically increased in the last several years. The joint survey by BOM \nand GDNT during the first quarter of 2004 showed that there are 570 registered SCCs, of which \n288 are believed to be inactive or bankrupt, or could not be located by the authorities. SCC \nassets amount to MNT47.1 billion, about 6% of total banking sector assets. SCC activities are \nconcentrated in Ulaanbaatar, which has 166 SCCs with total assets of MNT44.6 billion. The \nsector is highly concentrated, with the 14 largest SCCs accounting for 76.2% of total assets. \nAlthough SCCs are allowed to take deposits only from the members, many SCCs take deposits \nfrom the public. \n \n4.  Securities Market and Intermediaries \n15.  There  are  395  companies  listed  on  the  Mongolian  Stock  Exchange  (MSE).  Market \ncapitalization  in  2004  was  MNT29.8  billion  (1.4%  of  GDP)  and  annual  trading  value  was \nMNT654 million. The trading value at MSE has been declining since a large part of corporate \nshares have been traded outside MSE and concentrated in small number of shareholders. In \n2004, only 1,300 companies and individuals owned 96% of the shares of all listed companies. \nPrivate companies and financial institutions currently do not use MSE to raise new equity \ncapital.  Total  trade  value  of  bonds  in  2004  was  MNT15.3  billion,  of  which  81.8%  were \ngovernment bonds and 18.2% corporate bonds. Nearly all the government and corporate bonds \nare bought by banks and held to maturity, and there is virtually no secondary market trading. As \na result of rapid decline in trading activity and the increase in minimum capital requirement (from \nMNT10  million  to  MNT50  million  in  January  2003),  the  number  of  licensed  securities \nbroker/dealer  companies  declined  from  42  in  2000  to  25  in  2004.  Of  the  25  securities \ncompanies, 2 have foreign participation. There is no licensed underwriter and no collective \ninvestment funds.  \n \n16.  In 2003, MSE was divided into two separate legal entities: MSE and the Securities \nClearing House and Central Depository. The separation of trading and listing functions of MSE \nfrom  its  securities  clearing  and  depository  systems  aimed  to  improve  transparency  and \naccountability. MSE is organized as a government-owned profit-making joint stock company. \nMSE shares were listed on the stock exchange in 2003 but are not traded since MSE is 100% \nGovernment-owned. MSE continues to operate as a traditional state-owned enterprise (SOE) \nwith six government representatives on the board, including the Mongolian Securities Exchange \nCommission (MSEC), and only one private sector representative from a broker/dealer company. \n \n5.  Insurance Industry \n17.  The number of insurance companies increased from 10 to 23 from 1999 to March 2005. \nFollowing the privatization of the largest insurance company, Mongol Daatgal, in February 2004, \nall insurance companies are now privately owned. In 2003, total insurance premiums were \nMNT6.3 billion, about 0.5% of GDP. Aircraft-related insurance (hull and liability) comprises the \nlargest category and accounts for 40% of the industry. The only class of mandatory insurance is \nmotor  vehicle  liability,  accounting  for  8%  of  total  industry  premium.  The  sector  is  highly \nconcentrated, with Mongol Daatgal accounting for 74% of total insurance sector premiums in \n2003. The recent bankruptcies of two insurance companies have raised concerns about the \n ", "    5 \nsolvency of the smaller companies. The insurance payout ratio (claims paid as a percentage of \ntotal premiums collected) is low at 20%. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n1.  Banking Sector \na.  Lack of an Effective Collateral Framework \n18.  The  absence  of  an  effective  collateral  framework  is  a  key  impediment  to  financial \nintermediation. The Second Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL II)5 supported measures to \nexpand the types of collateral that banks can accept from immovable to movable property and \nfinancial assets, and to reduce the cost of collateral registration. Under the FSPL II, the Civil \nCode was amended to allow banks to seize immovable property without a court decision. \nHowever, the 2002 Civil Code includes another article that contradicts the previous one. This is \na major setback for banks and removes a strong incentive for borrowers to meet their debt \nobligations.  The  court  procedures  for  securing  and  enforcing  collateral  are  lengthy  and \ncumbersome. After the court decision, the Court Decision Enforcement Office (bailiff\u2019s office) \ntakes months and even years from the court decision to the actual foreclosure, and charges \nfees as high as 10% of the property\u2019s value. The information available from the Property \nRegistration Office (PRO) in the Ministry of Construction and Urban Development (MOC) is \nlimited,  making  it  difficult  for  banks  to  assess  the  creditworthiness  of  potential  borrowers. \nCombined, these factors weaken banks\u2019 leverage in foreclosure and increase credit risk, adding \nsignificantly to the interest premiums charged by banks. The high cost of notarizing documents \nfor  collateral  registration\u2014which  can  be  up  to  MNT40,000\u2014also  increases  the  cost  of \nborrowing.  \n \nb.  Weak Governance and Depositor Protection \n19.  While  corporate  governance  practices  have  improved  in  recent  years,  they  vary \nconsiderably across the 17 commercial banks. In particular, the three banks that have foreign \nmanagement or long-term international advisors\u2014Agricultural Bank, Trade and Development \nBank, and Xac Bank\u2014have developed sound corporate governance structures. However, some \nbanks are believed to engage in substantial related-party lending at below-market rates and \nwithout consideration of creditworthiness.  \n \n20.  Weak Internal Controls. Related-party lending is largely due to the weak system of \nchecks and balances. The Banking Law requires that banks\u2019 board of directors be shareholders. \nBy preventing the appointment of independent directors, this requirement impedes the effective \nfunctioning of banks\u2019 governing boards and auditing committees. Most of the banks are closely \nheld limited liability companies with one or two shareholders controlling the majority of shares, \nand a representative of the majority shareholder chairing the governing board. The corporate \ngovernance guidelines issued by BOM in 2002 do not include clearly specified fiduciary duties \nand  safeguards  against  related-party  transactions,  and  functions  of  board  committees. \nAddressing these gaps will help promote transparency and prevent conflict of interest and fraud, \nthereby protecting depositors. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nMongolia for the Second Financial Sector Reform Program. Manila (Loan 1743-MON [SF]).  \n ", "6               \n21.  Weak Supervision of Financial Groups and Conglomerates. Mongolian banks are \nprohibited from holding nonbank financial intermediaries and other companies as subsidiaries. \nHowever, banks may be owned or controlled by one or more financial or non-financial firms. \nThere are few limitations on the activities, including financial ones, of banks\u2019 shareholders and \ntheir affiliates, and financial supervisors have limited information about the groups of enterprises \nthat hold banks and other financial institutions. As a result, despite the strict limitations on \nbanks\u2019 business activities and shareholding, the potential risks arising from financial and other \nactivities of banks\u2019 shareholders and their affiliates are not properly monitored and managed by \nBOM. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many banks are funding the activities of their owners \nand  affiliates  of  the  owners.  These  concerns  highlight  the  immediate  need  to  improve \nsupervision of financial groups and conglomerates to protect depositors. \n  \n2.  Nonbank Financial Sector \na.  Fragmented Regulatory Structure and Weak Institutional Capacity \n22.  NBF regulation is fragmented and weak. Regulatory and supervisory responsibilities are \ndivided  among  BOM,  which  is  responsible  for  regulating  NBFIs  and  SCCs  in  addition  to \ncommercial banks; the Insurance Supervisory Unit (ISU) of the State Agency for Professional \nInspectors; and MSEC.  \n \n23.  Having several regulators is costly and inefficient, especially in a small country like \nMongolia. Of the 50 or so staff members in BOM\u2019s Supervision Department, 10 are in charge of \nNBFI supervision. BOM has issued prudential requirements for SCCs, but it has neither the \nlegal authority nor the staff resources to supervise SCCs. Therefore, BOM does not have staff \nmembers responsible for monitoring SCCs\u2019 compliance with prudential regulations. As rapidly \ngrowing deposit-taking institutions, SCCs must be adequately supervised. MSEC has only 20 \nstaff members. It does not have a specialized unit for enforcement, which is one of the most \nimportant  responsibilities  of  a  securities  regulator.  The  FSPL  II  supported  institutional \nstrengthening  of  MSEC  through  investment  in  computer  information  systems  and  through \ndomestic and international training. However, lack of resources to recruit specialized experts \nsuch as a chief accountant and a chief legal and enforcement officer, as would be possible in a \nlarger  financial  regulatory  body,  has  hampered  MSEC\u2019s  ability  to  effectively  regulate  the \nsecurities market. The ISU employs only seven staff members, none with adequate specialized \nexpertise  in  insurance.  Establishing  a  regulatory  structure  that  is  more  efficient  and  cost-\neffective is crucial for enhancing NBF regulation and supervision. \n \n24.  MSE  was  launched  in  February  1992  to  implement  the  Government\u2019s  privatization \nprogram. Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance was instrumental in providing policy and \ntechnical advice, and in financing basic computer equipment early on. However, MSE continues \nto be perceived mainly as a venue for SOE privatization, and further institutional strengthening \nis needed to transform MSE into a modern stock exchange where private companies and \nfinancial  institutions  can  raise  long-term  capital.  Further  strengthening  of  the  legal  and \nregulatory framework is also crucial for capital market development. \n \nb.  Gaps and Anomalies in the Legal Framework  \n25.  The NBF sector is governed mainly by the Law on Nonbank Financial Activities (2002), \nLaw  on  Cooperatives  (1998,  amended  2002),  Law  on  Insurance  (1998),  and  the  Law  on \n ", "    7 \nSecurities Market (2002).6 They vary considerably in their legal bases for effective regulation \nand supervision. Under the current framework, the ISU is not authorized to license and regulate \ninsurance companies: licensing and regulatory powers still reside with the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF).  This  arrangement  not  only  undermines  the  ISU\u2019s  role  but  also  significantly  delays \nlicensing.  The  Laws  on  Insurance  and  Law  on  Licensing  and  Supervision  of  Insurance \nIntermediaries, prepared with ADB support,7 have strengthened the licensing and prudential \nrequirements and provide for a single agency to license, regulate, and supervise insurance \nintermediaries. However, the law has not yet entered into force, and implementing regulations \nhave not been finalized and issued. \n \n26.  The 2002 amendments to the Law on Cooperatives provide for prudential regulation of \nSCC by BOM. However, the law does not provide adequate basis for effective regulation and \nsupervision of SCC activities. In particular, it does not require that SCCs be licensed by a \ndesignated entity, does not confer adequate supervisory powers on BOM, and does not provide \nfor the suspension or revocation of the registration of a cooperative that has breached the law.  \n \n27.  A fundamental weakness of the Law on Securities Market is that it does not clearly \ndistinguish between the provisions that apply to public offers, and those to private offers of \nsecurities. The law is not sufficiently clear on whether joint stock companies are required to be \nlisted.  One  consequence  of  this  is  that  companies  that  do  not  meet  the  governance  and \ndisclosure requirements continue to be listed on MSE. The ability of a joint stock company to \nunlist  would  enable  MSEC  to  de-list  a  joint  stock  company  that  no  longer  meets  listing \nrequirements  without  necessarily  requiring  that  the  company  convert  into  a  limited  liability \ncompany. While the law recognizes the creation and operation of investment funds, it is weak \non the segregation and protection of fund assets and the obligations of the governing persons of \ninvestment funds and funds management companies. \u201cFit and proper\u201d standards for directors of \ngoverning  boards,  senior  managers,  and  major  shareholders  of  securities  issuers  and \nprofessional participants are not required under the law. Moreover, the law does not make it an \noffense  for  an  individual  or  a  legal  entity  to  conduct  the  business  of  a  securities  market \nintermediary without obtaining license from MSEC.8  \n \n28.  An effective financial regulatory regime must make appropriate use of self-regulatory \norganizations (SROs) to exercise some direct oversight responsibility over its members, in \naddition  to  the  oversight  by  the  government  regulator.  For  instance,  the  broker/dealer \nassociation could be assigned the responsibility of monitoring the activities of its member and \ntaking disciplinary actions if necessary. The lack of such power under the law prevents MSEC \nfrom authorizing an industry body such as MSE or the Securities Dealer Association to take on \nSRO functions.  \n  \nc.  Weak Governance, Disclosure, and Investor Confidence \n29.  The  weaknesses  in  the  Company  Law  (1999)  have  important  implications  for \ngovernance  and  stakeholder  protection.  It  provides  the  basis  for  regulating  the  formation, \nregistration,  and  governance  of  limited  liability  companies  and  joint  stock  companies.  The \ngovernance  requirements  for  limited  liability  companies  under  this  law  are  minimal.  For \n                                                 \n6  The Company Law (1999) is also an important element of the legal framework for financial sector. However, since \nit mainly has governance implications, it is discussed in the section on governance and investor protection. \n7  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Strengthening Financial Sector Development. Manila (TA 3459-\nMON). \n8 This lack of clarity is a common weakness in Mongolian laws, and contributes to the culture of weak compliance and \nenforcement.  \n ", "8               \ninstance, limited liability companies are not required to have a board of directors or to prepare \nannual reports with information on corporate governance practices. The law restricts the number \nof founders of a closed or limited liability company to 50, but allows unlimited number of \nshareholders thereafter. Therefore, limited liability companies can admit broad public ownership \nthat may not be protected by the requirements that apply to joint stock companies.  \n \n30.  To  promote  internationally  recognized  standards  of  accounting,  the  Government \npromulgated the Accounting Law in 1993 (amended in 2001), requiring business enterprises to \nadopt  international  accounting  standards.  The  law  also  required  the  establishment  of  the \nMongolian National Association of Certified Public Accountants, which was upgraded to the \nMongolia Institute of Certified Public Accountants in 1996. The Audit Law (1997) requires the \nadoption of international standards of auditing. While Mongolia was quick to adopt international \naccounting standards by law, their implementation has been slow. As a result, the quality of \nfinancial statements of joint stock companies and limited liability companies remains inadequate \nin  terms  of  disclosure  to  investors,  lenders,  and  other  stakeholders.  Instead,  financial \nstatements are prepared mainly to minimize tax obligations. \n \n31.  The range of monetary penalties that may be imposed on individuals and legal entities \nthat violate the relevant laws is evidently not adequate to act as a deterrent. For example, the \npenalty prescribed for violation of the Law on Securities Market is MNT20,000\u201340,000 for \nindividuals, and MNT100,000\u2013200,000 for legal entities. A fine of MNT40,000 represents just a \nquarter more than the minimum monthly wage in Mongolia, which stands at about MNT30,000. \nIn contrast, the Law on Nonbank Financial Activities allows for a much higher range of fines: 5\u2013\n20 times the minimum wage for individuals and 20\u201340 times for NBFIs.  \n   \nd.  Tax Impediments \n32.  Distortions created by the tax system have also constrained the NBF sector. A key \ndistortion arises from the corporate tax system. Mongolia levies a progressive rate, whereby the \ntax rate is 15% for companies with profits less than MNT100 million and 30% for companies \nwith  higher  profits.  This  has  had  significant  adverse  effects.  First,  it  penalizes  efficient \ncompanies with high profits. Second, the tax system encourages companies to split into smaller \ncompanies to avoid paying the higher rate. Besides not being able to benefit from economies of \nscale,  the  smaller  companies  are  not  able  to  raise  funds  through  the  capital  market.  By \nencouraging the creation of subsidiaries, the corporate income tax system also complicates \nmanagement structures, resulting in inefficiency and lack of transparency.  \n \n33.  The differential tax treatment on the returns of different types of financial assets is \nanother distortion. Interest on government debt is tax exempt. According to the Corporate \nIncome Tax (CIT) Law and Personal Income Tax (PIT) Law, interest income on bank deposits is \nsubject to a 15% tax rate. However, this article will come into effect only in 2008. Therefore, \ninterest on bank deposits is currently tax exempt. However, dividends are subject to a 15% tax \nrate, and capital gains on equity investment to up to 30%, discouraging investment in the equity \nmarket. In most countries, one reason why founders of closely held limited liability companies \nlist on the stock exchange is to realize a capital gain as share prices increase. Further, reserves \nfor  expected  losses  are  tax  deductible  for  commercial  banks  and SCCs  but  not  for  other \nfinancial institutions. Harmonizing the taxation of banking and NBF sectors is crucial to develop \na broad-based financial sector.  \n  \n ", "    9 \n3.  Need for an Effective Anti-Money-Laundering Regime \n34.  Money laundering has its origins in graft, corruption, and other criminal activities. The \nperceived risks from money laundering through the financial system can significantly erode \ndepositor confidence.9 Mongolia has recently received large capital inflows, the sources of \nwhich are not properly traced and tracked. The lack of transparency and information leads to \ngaps  in  the  financial  system  through  which  illegal  funds  could  flow,  which  could,  in  turn, \nundermine financial soundness and stability. Mongolia\u2019s location makes it particularly vulnerable \nto illegal funds being routed through the country to hide their origin and destination.  \n \n35.  The development of an effective anti-money-laundering (AML) regime is fundamental to \nstrengthening the financial sector and its governance. Proper controls for money laundering will, \nin turn, reduce the scope for other types of crime such as drug trafficking and corruption. The \nGovernment has taken the initial steps to address the potential risks from money laundering. A \ngovernment  resolution  issued  in  2001  instructs  MOF  to  cooperate  with  international \norganizations in combating terrorist financing and money laundering.  The Government has \nprepared a draft AML law, which is being finalized for submission to Parliament. Adopting the \nlegal framework, however, is only the first step. To establish a fully effective AML system, \nimplementing rules and regulations need to be developed, and the institutional arrangement and \ninformation technology (IT) equipment to report and prosecute money laundering put in place.  \n \nC.  Government Strategy \n36.  Despite  a  difficult  transition  period  marked  by  financial  turbulence  and  economic \ninstability, the Government has been committed to substantive financial reform. Government \nownership of previous ADB projects has been strong. In 2003, the Government finalized a \nnational poverty reduction strategy in the form of the Economic Growth Support and Poverty \nReduction Strategy, from which the new Government derived a new law outlining the National \nAction Plan for 2004\u20132008. The plan highlights the role of the financial sector in ensuring a \ngrowth rate of about 6% over the medium term. The plan also highlights the importance of \ncontinued reforms to develop a stable and broad-based financial sector. Specifically, the plan \nsets out to (i) consolidate financial sector stabilization; (ii) strengthen the stock exchange to \nmobilize savings for productive investments; and (iii) develop a broader range of financial \nservices and instruments.10 The Government has strongly endorsed the FRGP, which is fully in \nline with its priorities and medium-term objectives.  \n \nD.  ADB Operations and Lessons Learned \n37.  Financial sector development has been a key focus of ADB\u2019s operations in Mongolia. \nThe country operational strategies of 1991 and 1994 expressed general support for the sector, \nrecommending assistance in policy and regulatory reform. The 2000 strategy recommended \nthat ADB assistance focus on banking sector reforms, followed by a second phase (starting \n2003) of broadening assistance to establish the necessary financial infrastructure beyond the \nbanking sector. The 2000 strategy also proposed credit lines for targeted on-lending to SMEs \nand rural enterprises, and for low-income housing. \n \n                                                 \n9 Money laundering also has a direct negative effect on economic growth by diverting resources to less productive \nactivities. \n10 Government of Mongolia. 2004.

Provision of TA started as early as 1991, when ADB supported MSE\u2019s establishment to \nfacilitate  the  Government\u2019s  privatization  program.  Subsequent  TA  has  supported  bank \nrestructuring and privatization, capacity building of BOM, capacity building of accounting and \nauditing professionals, development of securities market law and regulations, establishment of \nMSEC, and drafting of AML law and regulations. \n \n39.  Responding  to  the  emerging  needs  of  the  financial  sector,  ADB  has  provided  two \nprogram loans to Mongolia. The first phase of comprehensive financial reforms was launched in \n1996 against the backdrop of a fragile banking sector with a number of illiquid and insolvent \nbanks. Supported by ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL I),11 these reforms focused \nprimarily on bank restructuring and resolution,12 strengthening prudential regulations and on-site \nand off-site supervision, and more generally encouraging the market orientation of the banking \nsector. The TA loan13 provided in conjunction with the FSPL I supported the upgrading of the \ninformation technology-management information system (IT-MIS) in commercial banks, and the \nestablishment of the Bank Training Center (BTC). However, initial improvements in the sector \nwere short-lived, in part because of delays in bank restructuring and in part because of the \nonset of the Asian and Russian financial crises in the second half of the 1990s. The effects of \nthe  Asian  crisis,  in  particular,  resulted  in  a  fall  in  international  prices  of  major  export \ncommodities, including copper, gold, and cashmere, placing pressure on loan servicing by \nexporters and further eroding the quality of bank assets.  \n \n40.  In 1999, the Government formulated the second phase financial sector reform strategy, \nwhich was implemented with support from the FSPL II14 and the World Bank\u2019s Financial Sector \nAdjustment  Credit  (FSAC).  FSAC  supported  the  restructuring  of  the  Savings  Bank  and \nAgriculture  Bank,  the  strengthening  of  banking  regulations,  and  the  strengthening  of  the \nMongolian  Asset  Recovery  Agency  and  the  credit  information  bureau.  The  FSPL  II \ncomplemented FSAC by developing guidelines for corporate governance in banks, improving \nthe collateral framework by expanding the types of assets that can be pledged and simplifying \nthe  collateral  registration  process,  supporting  the  implementation  of  IT-MIS  in  commercial \nbanks, and developing an interbank market. The FSPL II also included measures to strengthen \nthe laws and regulations governing NBFIs and insurance companies and to promote capital \nmarket development by strengthening the legislation and capacity building of MSEC. \n \n41.  As  a  result  of  these  reforms,  the  financial  sector  has  stabilized  and  strengthened \nconsiderably  since  the  1990s\u2019  banking  crises.  Key  achievements  include  restructuring  and \nprivatization  of  state-owned  banks,  interest  rate  liberalization,  development  of  an  efficient \ninterbank market, and strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework for banks, including \nregulatory capacity of BOM. IT-MIS in commercial banks has improved significantly, and BTC is \nemerging  as  an  increasingly  credible  and  self-sustaining  institution.  The  FSPL  II  was \ninstrumental in laying the groundwork for further NBF sector development. However, developing \na well-functioning and broad-based financial system is a gradual process, especially in transition \neconomies  that  lack  market-based  institutions  and  human  resources.

Building on the progress achieved under the FSPL I and II, the FRGP aims to further the \nGovernment\u2019s reform efforts by using a comprehensive approach to address the remaining \nlegal, regulatory, institutional and policy weaknesses highlighted above. Besides addressing \nweaknesses specific to the subsectors, the FRGP\u2019s reform measures also take into account the \nlinks  and  complementarities  between  the  banking  and  NBF  sectors.  Strong  economic \nperformance in recent years provides a conducive environment for financial reform. Using a \nresult-based approach, further ADB assistance will be determined by outcomes of the FRGP, \nand by assessment of the financial sector\u2019s emerging needs. \n \n43.  Lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  financial  sector  projects  in  Mongolia  were  taken  into \naccount in designing the FRGP. The country assistance program evaluation provides valuable \nlessons and recommendations based on an in-depth review of ADB\u2019s operations in Mongolia.15 \nThe evaluation notes that the efficacy of the FSPL I and II would have been strengthened had \nthe underlying issues and priorities been analyzed in more detail during program preparation.16 \nIn  line  with  this  recommendation,  the  FRGP  was  prepared  with  a  comprehensive  project \npreparatory  TA  covering  legal,  regulatory,  policy,  and  institutional  impediments  to  financial \nsector development.  \n \n44.  A key lesson from the FSPL I is that the establishment of new institutions should be \nbased  on  adequate  analysis  of  the  long-term  viability  of  the  institution,  and  that  sufficient \ncapacity building should be provided to ensure that they are sustainable. The attached TA will \nprovide policy and technical guidance and capacity-building training to ensure the sustainability \nof the proposed Nonbank Financial Regulatory Commission (NBFRC). The attached TA will also \nsupport the establishment of IT-MIS in NBFRC and in the financial intelligence unit (FIU) in \nBOM. The program performance audit report for the FSPL I17 emphasizes the urgent need to \naddress the weaknesses in the secured transactions framework, and recommends that the \nadoption of legal reforms to improve the collateral framework be a precondition for any new \nADB loan for financial sector reforms. Developing an effective collateral framework is a program \nobjective. \n \n45.  An important lesson from the FSPL II is the need to focus on achieving policy objectives \nrather than technical compliance. For instance, even though the policy conditions of the FSPL II \nwere technically met, some reform measures were not properly implemented and did not fully \ngenerate  expected  results  and  objectives.  The  adoption  of  new  laws  and  regulations  was \ndelayed partly because the lack of understanding, by government officials and members of \nparliament,  of  the  intended  objectives  and  outcomes  the  policy  conditions.  The  lack  of \nunderstanding about the functioning of the capital market, in particular, impeded capital market \nreforms. The rationale for specific policy conditions must, therefore, be fully clarified during \nprogram  preparation.  To  this  end,  stakeholders\u2014including  members  of  parliament,  and \nrepresentatives from the Government, financial institutions, and the corporate sector\u2014have \nbeen  consulted  extensively.  Policy  conditions  related  to  legal  reforms  outline  the  specific \nprovisions that are required to meet the program objectives. Another key lesson from the FSPL \nII is that program implementation is just as important as program design. The effectiveness of \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2002.

Manila (Loan 1509-\nMON). \n ", "12               \nthe FSPL II was undermined to some extent by frequent changes in ADB program officers and \nby inadequate human resources and time allocated for program implementation. Adequate \nimplementation  requires  not  only  urging  the  Government  to  comply  with  policy  conditions, \ndrafting laws and regulations, and providing training through TA, but also maintaining intensive \ndialogue with the Government and stakeholders to assess the relevance of proposed policy \nreforms and to gauge the impact of policy actions. \n \n46.  The FSPL II highlighted the importance of creating a conducive policy environment. The \ndisincentive created by the tax system is a reason why the FSPL II reforms were not as effective \nas they should have been in increasing stock market listing and stimulating investor interest in \nthe capital market. The FRGP\u2019s tax reforms will help mitigate the distortion created by the \ncurrent tax system. \n \nE.  External Assistance to the Sector \n47.  ADB has coordinated closely with Mongolia\u2019s other development partners. The FSPL II \nwas developed and implemented in close coordination with the World Bank\u2019s FSAC. The World \nBank  is  helping  modernize  the  payment  system,  strengthen  risk  management  systems  in \ncommercial banks, and develop index-based livestock insurance. The International Finance \nCorporation (IFC) has provided equity investments, subordinated loans, credit lines, and TA to a \nnumber of commercial banks. IFC is also helping promote the leasing industry by developing \nthe legal framework and building the capacity of leasing companies. The International Monetary \nFund (IMF) has provided technical advice to BOM on (i) banking supervision, including asset \nclassification  and  provisioning  standards;  (ii)  the  payment  and  settlement  system;  and  (iii) \naccounting and internal audit in commercial banks. The initial draft of the AML law was prepared \nwith IMF assistance, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has \nprovided short-term advisory assistance for AML regulations and investigative procedures. With \nassistance  from  IMF  and  USAID,  the  Government  recently  prepared  a  reform proposal  to \nimprove the efficiency of the tax system. A number of bilateral and multilateral aid agencies from \nthe  European  Union,  Germany,  Japan,  and  United  Kingdom  have  provided  credit  lines  to \ncommercial banks and NBFIs for loans to SMEs. ADB has coordinated closely with other \nexternal agencies during program preparation to maximize synergies where possible, and to \navoid duplication of efforts. The development coordination matrix is in Appendix 2. \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Objective and Scope \n48.  The FRGP\u2019s objective is to help develop a sound and broad-based financial sector that \neffectively channels resources into productive investment. Specifically, the FRGP will seek to (i) \nreduce the cost of borrowing and expand access to credit by improving the collateral framework, \n(ii) improve governance in banks to protect depositors, (iii) enhance the role of the NBF sector in \nsavings mobilization for investment capital, and (iv) improve investor confidence by reducing the \nrisks from potential money laundering through the financial system. The FRGP is designed as a \ncontinuation of the FSPL II, and will build on the progress achieved under the FSPL I and II. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3. \n \n49.  The FRGP includes critical policy reforms for financial sector development. The banking \nsector reforms under the FRGP aim to reduce the cost of borrowing and expand access to \ncredit by facilitating debt recovery by banks and by lowering the cost of collateral registration. \n ", "    13 \nThis component will introduce legal and regulatory changes to strengthen corporate governance \nin banks and to improve the supervision of groups and conglomerates that control financial \ninstitutions. The NBF reforms seek to enhance the sector\u2019s role in resource mobilization and \nallocation by developing the legal and regulatory framework, strengthening regulatory capacity \nby establishing a single regulator for NBF sector\u2014NBFRC, and by strengthening corporate \ngovernance and investor protection. This component also aims to reduce the distortionary \nimpact of tax policies on the financial sector. The AML component seeks to mitigate the risks \nfrom money laundering by helping develop AML legislation and regulations, and by establishing \nthe FIU in BOM. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n50.  Policy reforms are presented in the policy matrix. The development policy letter (DPL) \nand policy matrix are in Appendix 4. The key measures are as follows: \n \n1.  Improve Efficiency and Stability of the Banking System \na.  Improve the Collateral Framework \n51.  The  lack  of  a  well-functioning  collateral  framework  is  a  key  constraint  on  financial \nintermediation. In line with the FRGP\u2019s recommendations, the Government recently enacted \nlegislation to allow non-judicial foreclosure of collateral and to improve the information available \nfrom the property registration system. The introduction of non-judicial foreclosure procedures \nwill help lower credit risk by facilitating debt recovery by banks. Improved collateral information \nwill facilitate banks\u2019 credit risk assessment. The FRGP calls for the strengthening of the PRO, \nwhich  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  non-judicial  procedures,  through  adequate \ntraining.  The  FRGP  also  supports  measures  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  document \nauthentication for collateral registration to reduce the cost of notarizing documents. \n  \n52.  The  effectiveness  of  the  collateral  framework  depends  not  only  on  the  design  and \nimplementation of the laws and registry system, but also on public awareness about procedures \nand consequences of default. Therefore, the FRGP recommends that commercial banks be \nrequired to provide adequate information to potential borrowers before concluding collateral \nagreements.  \n \nb.  Strengthen Corporate Governance \n53.  Improving  banks\u2019  corporate  governance  to  ensure  financial  stability  and  depositor \nprotection is one of the FRGP\u2019s main objectives. Amending the Banking Law to require an \nindependent  board  of  directors  is  fundamental  to  improving  commercial  banks\u2019  corporate \ngovernance. A broader ownership structure will also help improve governance. Therefore, the \nFRGP recommends that the Banking Law be amended to allow commercial banks to be listed \non the stock exchange so that the closely held ownership structure can be diversified. The \nFRGP calls for BOM to establish a working group comprising representatives from BOM and \nbanks to develop a code of corporate governance to strengthen depositor protection. The code \nwill  outline  principles  on  accountability  to,  and  safeguards  for,  the  public  and  to  principal \nstakeholders;  clearly  delineate  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  the  board  and  senior \nmanagement; provide for a professional and balanced board of directors with clearly specified \nfiduciary duties and safeguards against related-party transactions; and strengthen disclosure \nand reporting requirements. The FRGP also calls for the designation of a compliance officer to \nensure banks\u2019 compliance with laws and regulations.  \n ", "14               \nc.  Improve the Supervision of Banks\u2019 Shareholders and Groups \n54.  To  monitor  and  mitigate  the  risks  arising  from  banks\u2019  ownership  structure  and  the \nnonbank  financial  activities  of  affiliates  and  major  shareholders,  the  FRGP  calls  for  the \nformation  of  well-defined  formal  groups  by  adopting  the  financial  holding  company  (FHC) \nstructure, rather than informal groups, which are difficult to supervise. The FRGP calls for the \nGovernment to amend the Banking Law to require a financial group that owns two or more \nbanks, or banks and nonbank financial intermediaries to take the form of FHC. The FRGP will \nhelp develop the regulatory and supervisory framework for FHCs, including (i) consolidated \nfinancial reporting and disclosure, risk assessment, and supervision; and (ii) mechanisms to \nenhance coordination and information exchange among BOM and other financial regulators. \nThe FRGP calls for the improved regulation on the definitions, limitations, and reporting and \ndisclosure of related-party transactions to strengthen the BOM\u2019s monitoring of related-party \ntransactions. Establishment of FHCs will also help develop the NBF sector by allowing qualified \nbanks to engage in a wider range of financial activities (including brokering/dealing, underwriting \nand managing investment funds) through affiliates and subsidiaries under the FHC structure. \n \n2.  Enhance the Role of the NBF Sector in Financial Intermediation \na.  Improve Regulatory and Supervisory Structure \n55.  NBF regulation is weak and fragmented. The individual NBF regulators do not have the \nresources and expertise to effectively oversee the insurance sector and the securities market. \nLikewise, BOM\u2019s regulatory resources are focused primarily on the banking sector. There is a \nstrong rationale for establishing a single NBFRC for NBFIs, SCCs, insurance, and the securities \nmarket. Specifically, an integrated framework will improve efficiency by allowing for the sharing \nof  infrastructure  and  human  resources  such  as  administrative  and  personnel  services,  IT \nspecialist, chief accountant, and chief enforcement officer. The cost saving from consolidation \ncould then be used to improve the quality of supervision by upgrading and maintaining IT-MIS; \nbuilding capacity of existing staff; and recruiting more specialized experts in the areas of credit \ncooperatives, the securities market, and insurance. An integrated agency will increase the \nchances of attracting and retaining qualified staff by offering more varied and challenging career \npaths.  More  important,  having  a  single  regulator  with  an  explicit  mandate  to  promote  the \ndevelopment of NBF sector and to protect investors will improve accountability and enhance \ninvestor awareness and confidence in the sector. Having a larger pool of staff will facilitate the \nswitching of regulatory staff from one subsector to another in the event of significant market \nturbulence. For instance, should there be a catastrophic event that had a large impact on the \ninsurance sector, NBRFC would be able to temporarily deploy additional staff to this subsector.  \n \n56.  While Mongolia could adopt a fully integrated financial services authority over the long \nterm, NBRFC is a more appropriate structure in the medium-term. There is a significant gap in \nthe  level  of  development  between  the  banking  and  NBF  sectors,  as  well  as  between  the \ncapacity of BOM and of MSEC and ISU. Gradual consolidation is important to facilitate smooth \ntransition and to ensure that bank supervision is not compromised. Once a core group of \nqualified regulators has been developed within NBFRC, the Government can decide to merge \nbank and NBF sector regulation under a single regulator.  \n \n57.  The  FRGP  supports  the  establishment  of  NBFRC,  which  will  be  responsible  for \nregulating and supervising the NBFIs, insurance companies, SCCs, and the securities market \nand  intermediaries.  This  will  entail  (i)  developing  the  legal  basis  for  establishing  a  more \nindependent, accountable, and transparent regulator; (ii) preparing a time-sequenced action \n ", "    15 \nplan for the start-up of NBFRC, including identification of budget and staffing requirements; and \n(iii) developing mechanisms for effective coordination between MOF, BOM, and NBFRC to \nfacilitate policy coordination and harmonization of regulation and enforcement of applicable laws \nand regulations. To enable NBFRC to better manage financial sector risks, and more generally \nto meet its mandate of promoting financial sector stability and development, the FRGP calls for \nthe establishment of adequate IT equipment in NBFRC. \n \n58.  The FRGP incorporates measures to strengthen MSE. It recommends that MSE develop \na  plan  for  self-regulation  identifying  MSE\u2019s  functions,  and  clearly  distinguishing  between \nMSEC\u2019s and MSE\u2019s roles. In line with the Government\u2019s medium-term objective, the FRGP will \nhelp prepare MSE for divestiture by developing a medium-term strategy to improve revenue and \noperational capacity.  \n \nb.  Strengthen the Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n59.  A clear and comprehensive legal basis is fundamental for the effective regulation and \nsupervision of the financial sector. The FRGP recommends a number of revisions to the Law on \nSecurities Market to address the weaknesses identified above. Specifically, the amended law \nshould (i) clearly distinguish between the provisions that apply to public and to private offers, (ii) \nclarify that joint stock companies are not required to be listed on MSE, (iii) strengthen the \nobligations of the governing persons of investment funds and fund management companies, (iv) \nintroduce  \u201cfit  and  proper\u201d  requirement  for  the  governing  persons  of  securities  issuers  and \nprofessional participants, and (v) clearly state that it is an offense for an individual or an entity to \nconduct the business of a securities market intermediary without obtaining license from MSEC. \n \n60.  The FRGP will help develop regulatory framework for the insurance sector. Specifically, \nthe FRGP recommends that the Government issue regulations that include licensing, prudential \nand reporting requirements for insurance companies. \n \n61.  The FRGP recommends that the Government amend the Law on Cooperatives to clearly \ndefine membership requirements, authorized business activities, supervision, sanctions, and \nauthorized methods to terminate SCC activities. In view of the scarcity of regulatory resources \nand the growing number of SCCs, the FRGP calls for the introduction of appropriate licensing \nrequirements to check excessive growth in the number of SCCs. The FRGP recommends that \nNBFRC use a risk-based approach concentrating on the larger and potential \u201cproblem\u201d SCCs. \nFor instance, the frequency of on-site inspections could be based on the size of the SCC and \nthe risk assessment from on-site and off-site inspections. \n \nc.  Enhance Investor Confidence by Strengthening Governance and \nTransparency  \n62.  While investor confidence in the financial sector is generally weak, it is particularly low in \nthe case of the capital market. Confidence in the equity market was seriously undermined in the \nlate 1990s when over 300,000 investors lost close to MNT1 billion because of the collapse of \nthe two custodian banks holding clearing funds of equity investors. In January 2002, the cabinet \ninstructed MOF and the State Property Committee to use a portion of the proceeds from \nprivatization of a number SOEs to compensate investors. However, so far only 3,500 investors \nhave received a total of MNT347 million in compensation. To help restore investor confidence, \nthe FRGP calls for the compensation of all eligible investors. \n \n ", "16               \n63.  The FRGP calls for NBFRC to require regulated entities, including insurance companies, \nNBFIs, and securities market participants to appoint at least two independent directors and one \ndesignated  compliance  officer.  The  FRGP  calls  for  the  establishment  of  \u201cfit  and  proper\u201d \nstandards  for  officers  and  directors  of  regulated  entities,  whereby  NBFRC  will  be  able  to \nprescribe,  and  review  the  qualification  of,  appointed  or elected  officers  and  directors.  The \ncompliance  officer  will  be  primarily  responsible  for  stakeholder  protection  by  detecting, \npreventing,  and  resolving  problems  before  they  become  rule  violations.  The  FRGP  thus \nrecommends that NBFRC, in coordination with BOM, develop and administer a training and \ncertification program.  \n \n64.  Amending the Company Law will be crucial for enhancing corporate governance and \ninvestor protection. The main amendments proposed include (i) limiting the total number of \nfounding and non-founding members of a limited liability company to 50; and (ii) creating a new \ncategory of \u201cpublic company\u201d, which will include (a) a joint stock company, (b) a limited liability \ncompany licensed by BOM or NBFRC, and (c) a limited liability company that has access to \npublic  funds  by  offering  debt  securities.  The  first  amendment  will  prevent  limited  liability \ncompanies, which are subject to lower standards of governance, from accessing funds from the \npublic. The second amendment captures financial institutions and companies that have access \nto funds from the public, which can then be subject to higher standards of corporate governance \nand disclosure. For instance, public companies will be required to have a board of directors with \nwell-defined roles and responsibilities. Public companies will also be required to submit to MSE \nand/or  the  supervisor  their  annual  reports,  including  audited  financial  statements  and \ngovernance practices.  \n \n65.  To  promote  transparency  based  on  disclosure  of  reliable,  relevant,  and  timely \ninformation, the FRGP recommends that NBFRC, MSE, and BOM gradually publish through \ntheir website the annual audited financial statements of all public companies. \n \nd.  Remove Tax Impediments \n66.  In  line  with  the  FRGP  recommendation,  the  Government  recently  submitted  to \nParliament  draft  amendments  to  the  CIT  Law.  The  draft  amendments  aim  to  reduce  the \ndistortion created by the two-tier tax structure, which is biased against large firms and thereby \nimpedes capital market development. Specifically, the amendments will increase the threshold \nfor the 30% tax bracket from the current level of MNT100 million to MNT500 million, reducing \nthe disincentives for companies to grow. The Government views this as an intermediate step \ntoward introducing a single corporate tax rate over the long term. The amendments also aim to \nharmonize  the  provisions  for  probable  losses  between  banks  and  nonbank  financial \nintermediaries, and to make insurance premiums paid by legal entities during ordinary course of \nbusiness tax-deductible.  \n \n67.  However, the draft amendments do not fully harmonize the tax treatment of returns on \ndifferent types of financial assets, not only discouraging public investment in stocks but also the \nlisting of companies. Therefore, the FRGP recommends harmonizing the taxation of interest \nincome on bank deposits and corporate bonds, and dividends and capital gains from equity \ninvestment.  \n \n3.  Establish an Effective Anti-Money-Laundering Regime  \n68.  As a first step toward establishing an effective AML regime, the Government has drafted \nan AML law. The draft law is being finalized for submission to Parliament. Once the AML \n ", "    17 \nlegislation is in place, appropriate regulatory and institutional arrangements will have to be \nestablished and institutional capacity built to effectively implement the law. The FRGP calls for \nthe development of the legal and regulatory framework, and the establishment of an FIU in BOM \nas the lead AML agency. Establishing the FIU will entail the adoption of rules and regulations \nunder the AML law, approval of structure and appointment of key staff, and development of the \nIT system for monitoring and reporting suspicious financial transactions. Besides training the \nFIU staff, the FRGP also recommends that BOM train financial institutions in compliance with \nthe AML law and regulations, and relevant agencies in the investigation and prosecution of \nmoney laundering. \n \n69.  Coordination among all related entities is essential for the AML system to be effective. \nThe FRGP calls for the establishment of a national coordinating committee (NCC) comprising \nBOM, MOF, the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs (MOJ), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the \npolice, and NBFRC. The FRGP also recommends forming a financial sector liaison committee \n(FSLC)  representing  relevant  government  agencies  and  compliance  officers  of  financial \ninstitutions. The FSLC will provide a framework for coordination and consultation between \ngovernment agencies and the financial sector. \n \nC.  Important Features \n70.  The FRGP aims to address legal, regulatory, institutional, and policy constraints on \nfinancial sector development. The FRGP will enhance the efficiency of financial intermediation \nby  developing  a  broad-based  financial  system  with  alternative  channels  for  resource \nmobilization and allocation. This will, in turn, promote economic growth and create jobs. The \ndevelopment of a robust and broad-based financial system will reduce the likelihood of financial \ncrises that could wipe out savings and have adverse macroeconomic consequences such as \nhigher inflation and tax rates. The FRGP is designed as a continuation the FSPL II, and will \nbuild on the achievements of the FSPL I and II. The reforms proposed under the FRGP are fully \nin line with the Government\u2019s priorities and medium-term objectives. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n71.  It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms by providing a loan of \nSDR6,917,000 ($10 million). The Borrower will be Mongolia. The loan will be from the ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources. The loan will have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per year for \nthe remaining period. The loan proceeds are expected to be used over a period of 48 months \nfrom the date of effectiveness.  \n \n72.  The proposed loan size is based on the estimated short- to medium-term adjustment \ncosts resulting from the FRGP. The adjustment costs are not easily quantifiable, but the direct \nand more obvious adjustment costs amount to about $19.5 million, including the following: \n \n(i)  NBFRC. While its establishment will result in significant cost savings through \neconomies of scale and improved efficiency in the long run, it will entail certain \ncosts in the short to medium term. This will include mainly costs of recruiting \nspecialized experts, training existing staff, developing and issuing guidelines and \nprocedures, and establishing IT-MIS. Estimated cost: $4 million. \n(ii)  Collateral  framework.  Once  the  legislation  on  non-judicial  foreclosure  is  in \nplace, the Government will need to develop guidelines and procedures and train \n ", "18               \nthe  PRO  and  commercial  bank  staff  in  the  new  procedures  for  non-judicial \nforeclosure. Estimated cost: $0.5 million. \n(iii)  Investor compensation. The FRGP calls for compensating eligible investors for \nthe losses incurred in the equity market caused by the failure of two custodian \nbanks holding clearing funds of investors. Estimated cost: $1 million. \n(iv)  Tax reforms. The FRGP calls for changes in the corporate income tax to reduce \nthe distortion created by the two-tier structure. The FRGP calls for harmonizing \nthe  tax  treatment  on  returns  from  bank  deposits  and  equity  investments. \nEstimated cost: $12 million. \n(v)  AML regime.  To establish an effective AML regime, the Government will need \nto develop legislation; issue regulations; invest in IT-MIS for the FIU; train the FIU \nstaff;  and  train  financial  institutions  in  compliance,  and  relevant  agencies  in \ninvestigation and prosecution of money laundering. Estimated cost: $2 million. \n \n73.  Although no cofinancing is envisioned now, cofinancing from commercial sources may \nbe mobilized later to complement ADB financing. Such cofinancing may benefit from ADB credit \nenhancement, including ADB guarantee instruments, and will be presented separately for Board \nconsideration as and when it arises. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n74.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the FRGP, and will be responsible for its overall \nimplementation,  including  the  administration  and  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds, \nmaintenance of accounts, and reporting to ADB. BOM will be the Implementing Agency for the \nbanking sector and AML components, and NBFRC will be the Implementing Agency for the NBF \nsector component. MOF will set up an interagency coordination committee headed by the MOF \nstate secretary, and comprising representatives of BOM, NBFRC, MSE, MOJ, and PRO under \nMOC. The committee will meet every quarter to coordinate and ensure effective reforms. ADB \nwill be a member of the committee to oversee the FRGP\u2019s progress.  \n \n75.  NBFRC will oversee and coordinate the development and implementation of the IT-MIS \nfor effective monitoring and managing of financial sector risks through a management team \ncomprising  two  NBFRC  staff  members  (one  manager  and  one  IT  expert),  one  MOF  staff \nmember, and the international financial supervisory IT system specialist recruited under the \nattached TA. The IT expert will be assigned full-time to develop and implement the IT-MIS. The \nteam will be located in NBFRC. The international financial supervisory IT system specialist \nrecruited under the attached TA will head the team, and will report jointly to the MOF state \nsecretary and the NBFRC managing director. \n \n76.  BOM will oversee and coordinate the development and implementation of the IT-MIS for \nanalyzing  and  reporting  suspicious  financial  transactions  through  a  management  team \ncomprising  two  BOM  staff  members  (one  manager  and  one  IT  expert),  one  NBFRC  staff \nmember, and the international FIU information system specialist recruited under the attached \nTA. The BOM IT expert will be assigned full-time to develop and implement the IT-MIS. The \nteam will be located in BOM. The international FIU IT system specialist will head the team, and \nwill report to the MOF state secretary and the BOM deputy governor.  \n \n1.  Procurement and Disbursement \n77.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \n ", "    19 \nbe procured in accordance with standard public procedures in Mongolia and normal private \nsector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n78.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the negative list of \nineligible items (Appendix 5) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe Government will certify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s \nprojected disbursement under the loan for the given period. ADB reserves the right to audit the \nuse of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n79.  The  Government  is  committed  to  improving  public  financial  management  systems. \nOngoing reforms include enhancing public accounting and auditing standards and building \ncapacity of the National Audit Office. The Government is also making continued efforts to \nimprove public financial management and to increase budget transparency by consolidating all \nbudget resources into the treasury single account. The financial management arrangements \nare, therefore, satisfactory. ADB will closely monitor program implementation to ensure that the \noutputs envisaged are achieved. \n \n80.  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  included  in  the  Loan  Agreement  for  the \nProgram.     \n \n2.  Counterpart Funds \n \n81.   The Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by the program \nloan will be used, first, to support the adjustment cost of reforms under the FRGP, and second, \nto finance expenditures for general development purposes of Mongolia. \n \n3.  Monitoring and Tranching  \n82.  The Government and ADB will continue to engage in active dialogue on sector issues, \npolicy reforms, and other measures during program implementation and on additional reforms \nthat may be considered necessary or desirable. ADB will field regular missions to confirm \ncompliance  with  conditions  for  the  second  tranche  and  advise  on  actions  to  maintain \nimplementation on course. The Indicative Implementation Schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n83.  The program period will be 4 years. The loan will be released in two equal tranches. The \nfirst,  SDR3,458,500  ($5  million  equivalent),  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The \nsecond, SDR3,458,500 ($5 million equivalent), will be released 24 months after Board approval, \nprovided  that  ADB  is  satisfied  that  the  Government  has  made  sufficient  progress  in \nimplementing the FRGP and, in particular, all the second-tranche release conditions set forth in \nthe policy matrix in Appendix 4 have been met. All the monitorable actions listed in the policy \nmatrix  must  be  taken  by  the  Government  during  the  FRGP.  While  these  actions  are  not \nconditions for the release of the first or second tranche, they are crucial to achieving the \nobjectives set forth in the policy matrix.  \n \n ", "20               \n4.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n84.  The Government will provide ADB with quarterly reports on program implementation. \nThey will describe progress made, any changes to the implementation schedule, and any \nproblems  encountered  and  remedial  actions  taken.  A  program  completion  report  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB within 3 months of program completion. \n \n5.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n85.  MOF will establish and maintain a program performance evaluation system that will \ninclude a database on the status on policy measures and program indicators based on the \npolicy matrix and the design and monitoring framework. \n \n6.  Program Review \n86.  The Government and ADB will conduct a comprehensive midterm review at the end of \nyear 2, and a program performance completion review at the end of the FRGP to evaluate the \nprogress of the reform measures and their impact on the financial sector. ADB will also monitor \nimplementation through regular reviews and progress reports throughout implementation. Based \non these reviews, modifications and improvements will be considered. \n \n87.  About 6 weeks before the anticipated withdrawal of the second tranche, or such other \ntime as the Government and ADB may agree, ADB will review the Government\u2019s progress in \nimplementing the policy reforms under the FRGP set out in the development policy letter and \nthe policy matrix, including the fulfillment of the conditions for the second-tranche release listed \nin the policy matrix. \n \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n88.  The TA\u2019s purpose is to help implement the policy reforms called for in the FRGP, and to \nstrengthen the capacities of NBFRC and FIU. Specifically, the TA will help the Government (i) \nimplement the procedures for non-judicial foreclosure of collateral; (ii) establish NBFRC by \ndeveloping transition arrangements, organizational structure, and internal procedures; (iii) draft \nlaws and regulations to address the weaknesses and gaps in the legal framework; (iv) introduce \ncorporate governance structure and practices in banks, nonbank financial intermediaries, and \nsecurities issuers; (v) develop IT-MIS for NBFRC and FIU; and (vi) provide capacity-building \ntraining on financial regulation, on on-site and off-site supervision, on accounting, auditing and \nreporting standards, and on IT-MIS. \n \n89.  The TA will require a total of 63 person-months of consulting services (23 person-\nmonths\u2019 international and 40 person-months\u2019 national). The international consultants will include \na nonbank financial regulatory specialist/team leader, a financial sector legal expert, a financial \nsector accounting expert, a financial supervisory information system specialist, and an FIU \ninformation system specialist. The TA will require national consultants who will each have \nbackground in the above five areas, and will engage a national consultant to facilitate the \ncollateral reforms. The consultants will be recruited by ADB through firms, selected under the \nquality- and cost-based selection method using the simplified technical proposal in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \non the engagement of national consultants. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 7. \n ", "    21 \n90.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,120,000 equivalent, including the foreign exchange cost \nof $740,000 and local currency cost of $380,000. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance $900,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $160,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide $220,000 equivalent through \nin  kind  contributions  of  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and  logistical  support.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 7. \n \n91.  MOF will be the Executing Agency. BOM and NBFRC will be the implementing agencies. \nThe TA will be implemented over 24 months, starting January 2006. \n \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n92.  The FRGP will promote financial system stability and enhance economic growth through \nefficient resource mobilization and allocation. The collateral reforms will help reduce the cost of \nborrowing and increase access to credit. The measures to improve corporate governance in \nbanks will enhance depositor protection. The increased role of the NBF sector in financial \nintermediation  will  reduce  the  risks  associated  with  over-reliance  on  the  banking  system. \nIncreased  competition  from  alternative  sources  of  financial  intermediation  will  enhance \nefficiency, and the financial system as a whole will become more resilient to exogenous shocks. \nFirms will be able to diversify their source of capital and have access to long-term funds for \nproductive investment.  \n \n93.  By increasing access to credit, savings instruments, and insurance products, the FRGP \nwill help protect the poor from income disruptions and enable them to meet unanticipated \nexpenditures. The development of viable SCCs will enhance financial sector outreach to the \nvulnerable and the poor. AML reforms will help enhance investor protection and confidence and \nfinancial stability by minimizing the scope for money laundering through the financial system. \nThe summary of poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 8. \n \n94.  Specific benefits can be outlined as follows:  \n \n(i)  Adopting  procedures  for  non-judicial  foreclosure  will  reduce  credit  risk. \nStrengthening the PRO and improving document authentication procedures will \nreduce the cost of collateral registration. These measures will reduce the cost of \nborrowing and improve access to credit. \n(ii)  By  introducing  legal  and  regulatory  measures  to  improve  governance  in \ncommercial banks, the FRGP will help ensure depositor protection. Depositor \nprotection  will  also  be  enhanced  by  improving  supervision  of  groups  and \nconglomerates that control financial institutions. \n(iii)  The FRGP will help develop the legal and regulatory framework for the NBF \nsector, including NBFIs, the insurance sector, the capital market, and SCCs. This \nwill increase access to long-term funding, and savings and insurance products. \nBy helping establish an effective regulator for the NBF sector, the FRGP will help \nensure that the sector is adequately supervised and the laws and regulations \nenforced, thereby enhancing investor protection. \n(iv)  The Government\u2019s adherence to its policy\u2014as announced through the 2001 \nparliament  resolution\u2014of  compensating  investors  who  suffered  losses  in  the \n ", "22               \nequity market in the late 1990s will help restore investor confidence and generate \ninvestment in the capital markets. \n(v)  Investor  confidence  will  be  boosted  by  measures  to  improve  disclosure  by \nfinancial  institutions  and  securities  issuers.  By  improving  the  accuracy  and \ntimeliness  of  financial  statements,  the  FRGP  will  enable  investors  to  better \nassess the potential risks and rewards of their investments. \n(vi)  By reducing the distortions created by the two-tier corporate tax system, the \nFRGP  will  promote  corporate  sector  and  capital  market  development. \nHarmonizing  the  tax  treatment  of  returns  on  different  types  of  financial \ninvestment will help develop a more balanced and resilient financial system. \n(vii)  An effective AML system will strengthen investor confidence in general and in the \nfinancial  sector  in  particular,  as  money  laundering  generally  stems  from \ncorruption and other criminal activities.  \n \nB.  Risks and Safeguards \n95.  Poor management of the transition to NBFRC is a key risk. A number of measures have \nbeen taken to facilitate timely and orderly transition. An overall strategy and a detailed time-\nbound action plan have been prepared in close consultation with the Government and other \nstakeholders.  During  program  preparation,18  considerable  efforts  were  made  to  reach  a \ncommon understanding and consensus among different government agencies on the objectives \nand the structure of NBFRC. BOM has committed to transfer at least eight qualified staff \nmembers to NBFRC, and the Government has agreed to allocate budget to ensure an adequate \npool  of  qualified  professional  staff  to  conduct  regulatory,  supervisory,  and  enforcement \nfunctions. The attached TA will provide policy and technical guidance and training for a smooth \ntransition. \n \n96.  Another risk is that the introduction of new legislation and legal amendments will be \ndelayed significantly and/or will not fully meet the program objectives. Inconsistencies among \ndifferent laws could create confusion and loopholes. This risk is minimized to the extent that \nmany of the laws called for in the FRGP were drafted during program preparation or under other \nADB projects. In line with the recommendation of the program completion report for the FSPL II, \nstakeholder consultations were held during program preparation to ensure that the expected \noutcomes of the legal reforms are fully understood. A number of crucial laws, including those \nrelated to the collateral framework, tax reforms, and the establishment of NBFRC, have either \nbeen already enacted or submitted to Parliament. The attached TA will further support the legal \nreforms and aim to ensure that any revisions made by the Government do not undermine the \neffectiveness of the laws. \n \n97.  Resistance from vested interests to certain reform measures is also a potential risk. It is \nparticularly  relevant  to  the  AML  and  tax  reform  measures.  So  far,  the  Government  has \nexpressed strong commitment to implementing AML reforms. The Government has prepared a \ndraft AML law. Submission of the law to Parliament is a condition for loan effectiveness. A TA19 \nis helping develop implementing regulations and a blueprint for IT and reporting requirements, \nand is providing related training to government agencies and financial institutions. This will \nfacilitate AML reforms. With assistance from IMF and USAID, the Government has prepared a \nreform proposal to improve the efficiency of the overall tax system.

Overall,  the  environmental  implications  of  the  program  loan  were  reviewed  and  no \nsignificant adverse impact was identified. The loan is under category C in ADB\u2019s environmental \nclassification system.  \n \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n99.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  the  policies  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement  as \ndescribed in the DPL (including the policy matrix), will continue to be in effect for \nthe duration of the FRGP and subsequently; and  \n(ii)  the Government will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other actions \nincluded in the FRGP as specified in the DPL (including the policy matrix) and \nwill ensure that such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the \nFRGP and subsequently. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n100.  The conditions of the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement are: (i) the entry into force of \nthe Law on the Establishment of NBFRC, and (ii) Government\u2019s submission of the draft AML \nLaw prepared with ADB\u2019s assistance to the Parliament. \n \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n101.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 6,917,000 to \nMongolia for the Financial Regulation and Governance Program from ADB\u2019s Special Fund \nresources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n                   Joseph B. Eichenberger \n     Vice President \n \n17 November 2005 \n \n ", "24     Appendix 1 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Banking Sector \n1.  Background \n1.  Mongolia  moved  from  a  Soviet-style  monobanking  system  to  a  two-tiered  banking \nsystem  in  1991.  However,  numerous  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  were  inherited  from  the \nmonobanking  system.  Continued  directed  lending  to  poorly  performing  enterprises  further \ndamaged the solvency and stability of the banking system. In 1996, four of the five largest \nbanks could not meet the liquidity ratio of 20% set by the Bank of Mongolia (BOM). Two major \nbanks  were  closed  in  1996  and  their  assets  were  transferred  to  the  newly  established \nReconstruction Bank. Reconstruction Bank and another major bank were closed down in 1999, \nwhile another major bank (Agriculture Bank) was placed under receivership and subsequently \nrehabilitated. Some small banks were also liquidated during the late 1990s. Over the past \ndecade, banking laws and regulations have been strengthened; the Government\u2019s involvement \nin bank operations has been substantially reduced; and a well-functioning interbank market has \nbeen introduced. As a result, public confidence in the banking sector has been strengthened \nand the sector has grown rapidly over the past few years. \n \n2.  Mongolia has 17 banks, of which 1 is fully state-owned, 2 have state participation, and \n14 are private. All the banks are limited liability companies with a small number of shareholders \n(1\u20134) controlling majority of shares. The 17 banks have a total of 684 branches and offices, of \nwhich around 500 are outside Ulaanbaatar. The sector is highly concentrated, with the four \nlargest banks accounting for 61% of total banking assets and 69% of deposits. Each of the \nseven smallest banks has assets of less than MNT20 billion. BOM will increase minimum capital \nrequirements of banks from the current MNT4 billion to MNT8 billion in 2006. Since 10 of the 17 \nbanks have capital levels under MNT5 billion, and only 31 have capital levels exceeding MNT8 \nbillion, the increase in the minimum capital requirement is expected to lead to consolidation \nwithin the banking sector. \n \n2.  Regulation and Supervision \n3.  The Banking Law, enacted in 1996 and amended a number of times since, provides the \nlegal basis for BOM to regulate and supervise the banking sector. About 40 staff members are \nin charge of supervising 17 banks. BOM has made substantial progress in strengthening its \nregulatory  capacities  in  recent  years.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  has  been \nsupporting BOM in establishing and upgrading various regulations.  \n \n4.  The  loan  classification  and  loan  loss  provisioning  standards  are  simple  and \nconservative, and are well implemented. The classification criteria consist of quantitative criteria \nbased on the duration of loan overdue and qualitative criteria based on the conditions of \nborrowers.  To  minimize  discretion,  the  qualitative  criteria  are  only  used  to  downgrade  the \nclassification derived from quantitative criteria and are mainly based on numerical indicators \nsuch as return on assets2 and capital\u2013asset ratio. The amount of loan loss provisioning is \ndetermined according to the classification under the BOM guidelines (e.g., 1% for performing, \n5% for past due). The required provisioning rates for substandard and doubtful loans were \nincreased by the amendment of the guidelines (25\u201340% for substandard, and 50\u201375% for \ndoubtful) in 2004. Commercial banks submit loan classification reports monthly to BOM. \n                                                 \n1 Golomt Bank, Anod Bank, and Chinggis Bank. \n2 Net profit as a percentage of assets. \n ", "   Appendix 1  25\n \n \n5.  BOM has established a standard set of prudential ratio regulations, including for (i) \ncapital adequacy, (ii) liquidity, (iii) credit concentration, and (iv) foreign exchange risk. Banks are \nrequired to submit reports on these indicators every month. A prompt corrective action program \nhas been established to allow BOM to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized banks, \nfrom  an  order  to  cease  paying  dividends  to  placement  of  the  bank  in  conservatorship, \ndepending on capital inadequacy. \n \n6.  Although standard articles about related-party lending and major shareholder rules are \nincluded the Banking Law, they appear insufficient to check the transactions within informal \ngroups of enterprises. The multi-layered ownership structures of banks and company groups \nmake it difficult for BOM to find out the scope of a single borrower, related parties, or controlling \nshareholder.  Although  BOM  has  the  authority  to  conduct  on-site  inspection  of  banks\u2019 \nshareholders under the law, it rarely uses this authority.  \n \n3.  Financial Conditions and Operations \n7.  Banks\u2019 financial conditions have improved considerably since the late 1990s. The total \ncapital\u2013asset ratio of the banking sector increased from below 4% in 1998 to 15% in 2004. The \nNPL ratio declined from 54% in 1999 to 8% in 2001, and stayed at 7\u201311% until 2004. The loan \nloss reserve has been provisioned according to BOM guidelines and stands at a high level. The \nbanking sector as a whole has been profitable for the past 5 years (2000\u20132004).  \n \n8.  Despite significant improvements in financial conditions, rapid credit expansion since \n2001 and subsequent gradual decline of asset quality in banks have raised concerns. The \noutstanding loan amount increased from MNT67 billion at the end of 2000 to MNT635 billion at \nthe end of 2004. The average rate of annual credit expansion during 2001\u20132003 was 88%, \nwhereas credit grew by 44% in 2004. The NPL ratio showed an upturn from 7% in 2002 to 8% in \n2003 and 11% in 2004. Although this may be partly caused by stricter asset classification \ncriteria set by  BOM,  the  performance  of  the loans  provided  during rapid  credit  expansion \nappears poor. Judging from the increase in the absolute NPL amount (MNT10.9 billion in 2001 \nto MNT70.5 billion in 2004), a high percentage (5\u20137%)3 of loans were newly classified as NPLs \nin each year during 2001 and 2004. Weak risk assessment and management capacity and \ninternal controls in banks is a main reason for weak loan performance. Even the top banks have \nnot established up-to-standard internal credit rating systems. Certain banks are believed to lend \nsignificant amounts to those close to bank management and shareholders at below-market \nrates, and without considering the borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness. The gap between the actual \ninterest income of banks and the interest income calculated from the reported interest rates is \none indication of the widespread use of such preferred interest rates.  \n \n9.  Another  concern  regarding  the  banks\u2019  financial  conditions  is  declining  profitability. \nAlthough the net profit (after tax) of the entire banking sector has increased from MNT8.8 billion \nin 2001 to MNT17.3 billion in 2004, return on assets has declined from 3.9% in 2000 to 1.6% in \n2004. One of the reasons for the declining profitability is the increased loan loss provisioning \ncaused by the deterioration of asset quality and application of stricter provisioning standards. \nThe narrowing interest rate margin and slow increase of fee income are also important factors. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3 The precise amount of newly classified NPLs is difficult to obtain. However, it can be estimated by using the data on \nchanges in the amount of NPLs, and data on loan loss provisioning.  \n ", "26     Appendix 1 \nTable A1.1:Summary Statistics for the Banking Sector \n \nItem  Unit  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004 \n Commercial Banks  Number  12 12 16  16  17 17\n Capital  MNT billion, year-end  19.1 29.9 47.2  61.3  110.4 167.1\n   $ million, year-end  17.8 27.3 42.8  54.5  81.0 138.2\n   Percentage of GDP  2.1 2.9 4.2  4.9  8.1 10.7\n Capital Adequacya  Percent   10.5 13.3 14.2  12.4  13.4 15.1\n Assets  MNT billion, year-end  182.3 225.7 332.7  493.0  826.1 1,108.8\n   $ million, year-end  170.0 205.7 301.9  438.2  707.3 917.2\n   Percentage of GDP  19.7 22.2 29.8  39.7  60.6 61.3\n Deposit Base  MNT billion, year-end  126.7 157.9 221.9  349.3  571.8 697.8\n  Percentage change  14.4 24.6 40.5  57.4  63.7 22.0\n   Percentage of GDP  13.7 15.5 19.9  28.2  42.0 38.6\n Outstanding Loan  MNT billion, year-end  77.5 66.8 135.1  231.4  442.1 635.0\n  Percentage change  (9.5) (13.9) 102.3  71.4  91.0 43.6\n  Percentage of GDP  8.4 6.6 12.1  18.7  32.5 35.1\n Nonperforming Loan  MNT billion year-end  42.1 15.9 10.9  16.6  36.7 70.5\n  Percentage change  29.0 (62.2) (31.6)  52.4  121.6 92.1\n  Percentage of outstanding loan  54.3 23.8 8.1  7.2  8.3 11.1\n Reserve for Loan Loss  MNT billion year-end  15.3 13.4 9.3  12.4  21.1 38.0\n Net Profit  MNT billion   \u2013 8.8 9.9  11.0  13.8 17.3\n Return on Assetsb  Percent  \u2013 3.9 3.0  2.2  1.7 1.6\n Interest Rate       \n Deposit Rate  p.a., year-end  23.4 16.8 14.3  13.2  14.0 14.2\n Lending Rate   p.a., year-end  39.3 32.8 30.2  28.4  26.3 25.4\n Central Bank Rate  p.a., year-end  11.4 8.7 8.6  9.9  11.5 15.8\n\u2013 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product, MNT = togrog, p.a. = per annum. \na Total capital as a percentage of total assets.  \nb Net profit as a percentage of total assets. \nSources: Bank of Mongolia and International Monetary Fund. \n \nB.  Nonbank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) \n1.  Background \n10.  In Mongolia, the term NBFI refers to a licensee under the Law on Nonbank Financial \nActivities (2002). The activities covered under this law include lending, factoring, leasing, issuing \nguarantees, issuing payment instruments, electronic payments and remittance services, foreign \nexchange services, trust services, investment in short-term financial instruments, and advisory \nservices. NBFIs are not allowed to take deposits. The number, loans, and total assets of NBFIs \nhave grown rapidly since 2000, when Mongol Credit was established as the first licensed NBFI. \nOf the 114 NBFIs registered in 2004, 9 were foreign-owned or joint ventures. Most of the NBFIs \nprovide small consumer loans or short-term loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, and a \nhandful are engaged in other activities such as leasing and foreign exchange trading. NBFIs are \nincorporated as limited liability companies, and are typically owned by a single individual, a \nfamily, or a small group of related individuals. With total assets of MNT28.7 billion, NBFIs as a \ngroup account for about 2.6% of banking sector assets.  \n \n ", "   Appendix 1  27\n \n2.  Regulation and Supervision \n11.  The Law on Nonbank Financial Activities provides the legal basis for regulation and \nsupervision of NBFIs. It authorizes BOM to license entities to carry out nonbank financial \nactivities, to issue regulations and procedures and to supervise and monitor the activities of \nNBFIs. Each NBFI is licensed for one or more activities, but there is no overall license to be an \nNBFI. The penalty provisions of the law also empower BOM to confiscate illegally generated \nincome and impose fines 5\u201320 times the minimum salary for individuals and 20\u201340 times the \nminimum salary for NBFIs for breaches of the laws. The minimum capital requirements for \nNBFIs are based on location: the minimum  capital required for the NBFIs incorporated in \nUlaanbaatar is MNT100 million, for NBFIs in Darkhan and Erdenet MNT30 million, and for \nNBFIs in rural areas MNT10 million. NBFIs are subject to a five-class asset classification system \nand provisioning standards similar to those for banks. BOM conducts on-site inspections for \nNBFIs and issues specific orders or revokes license if serious breaches are found. In 2003, five \nNBFI licenses were revoked. BOM has about 10 member-staff in its NBFI division, which is \nresponsible for supervising NBFIs and savings and credit cooperatives (SCCs). \n \n3.  Financial Conditions and Operations \n12.  Compared with other nonbank financial intermediaries in Mongolia, NBFIs under the Law \non Nonbank Financial Activities are well regulated and operate in a stable manner. The asset \nquality and earnings of the entire sector appear fair and the NPL ratio has declined in recent \nyears. While most of the smaller NBFIs are financed by equity, some large ones have significant \nloan financing and accrued interests. Total liabilities in the sector amount to 30% of sector \nassets.  \n \nTable A1.2: Summary Statistics for Nonbank Financial Institutions \n \nItem  Unit  2000 2001 2002a  2003 2004\n Nonbank Financial Institutions  Number  7 28 66  97 114\n Assets  MNT billion, year-end  3.0 23.4 12.5  18.9 28.7\n   Percentage of GDP  0.3 2.1 1.0  1.4 1.6\n Outstanding Loan  MNT billion, year-end \n1.5 13.2 6.3  11.8 16.9\n Nonperforming Loan  MNT billion, year-end  \u2013 \u2013 0.4  0.8 0.8\n  Percentage of outstanding loan  \u2013 \u2013 6.7  6.5 4.5\n Liabilities  MNT billion, year-end  1.4 3.1 3.9  5.2 \u2013\n Capital  MNT billion, year-end  1.6 20.3 8.6  13.7 \u2013 \n Net Income  MNT billion, year-end  \u2013 \u2013 0.6  1.1 \u2013\n\u2013 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product, MNT = togrog. \na Chinggis Khan, the largest NBFI, obtained a banking license in 2002, and therefore was not included in the \nsubsequent data. \nSource: Bank of Mongolia. \n \nC.  Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SCCs) \n1.  Background \n13.  SCCs are established under the Law on Cooperatives and provide saving and lending \nservices to members. Mongolia has seen a dramatic increase in the number of SCCs in the last \nseveral years. In March 2004, of 570 registered SCCs, only 282 were found to be operating. \nThe total assets of the SCCs nearly tripled from the end of 2002, and amounted to MNT47.1 \nbillion in March 2004. SCC assets are about 6% of the total banking sector assets. The amount \n ", "28     Appendix 1 \nof  loans  and  deposits  held  by  the  282  SCCs  were  MNT33.9  billion  and  MNT38.4  billion, \nrespectively. SCCs have a total of 22,200 members. The size of the SCC sector may be \nsignificantly  larger  since  many  SCCs  that  were  not  inspected  may  be  in  operation.  SCC \nactivities are concentrated in Ulaanbaatar where 166 SCCs with total assets of MNT44.6 billion \nand 15,400 members are located. The sector is highly concentrated, with the 14 largest SCCs \naccounting for 76.2% of total assets.  \n \n2.  Regulation and Supervision \n14.  SCCs  are  governed  by  the  Law  on  Cooperatives,  which  also  governs  agriculture, \nmanufacturing,  and  consumer  cooperatives.  The  law  does  not  provide  adequate  basis  to \nregulate deposit-taking and lending activities of cooperatives. Although the law sets out the \nlimitations  on  SCCs\u2019  activities,  rights,  and  obligations  of  members,  and  obligations  of \nmanagement and other governance requirements, it does not assign any government agency to \nsupervise the activities of SCCs and monitor their compliance with the law. SCCs that take \ndeposits and make loans are not required to obtain a license from a regulator, though SCCs are \nregistered with the General Department of National Taxation (GDNT). While the amendments to \nthe law in 2002 provided for prudential standards for SCCs issued by BOM, the law does not \nprovide BOM with powers to effectively supervise SCCs, such as on-site inspections, reporting \nrequirements, suspension of business, and revocation of registration.  \n \n15.  An SCC interim supervision unit was established under GDNT to supervise SCCs from \nJune 2003 to June 2004. In accordance with a parliament resolution, GDNT and BOM jointly \nconducted inspections of all the active SCCs for the first time during the first quarter of 2004. In \nApril 2004, SCC supervision was transferred to BOM, also on an interim basis. Although BOM is \ndesignated as the supervisor of SCCs, no BOM staff member is specifically tasked to supervise \nSCCs full-time. The interim supervisory assignment with limited legal power and staff resources \nmakes it difficult for BOM to take on the full responsibility of supervising SCCs. \n \n3.  Financial Conditions and Operations \n16.  The joint inspections of SCCs by GDNT and BOM uncovered many serious problems. \nAlthough SCCs are allowed to take deposits only from the members, many SCCs are taking \ndeposits  from  the  public  and  therefore  operating  as  banks.  Most  SCCs  are  found  to  be \nimproperly recruiting members4 and exceeding BOM\u2019s loan limit to a single borrower. The \ndeposit interest rate was 1.85\u20134.00% per month, far higher than that of commercial banks, and \nlending interest rates were 2.7\u20138.0% per month. About half of the registered SCCs (288 out of \n570) were reported to be either inactive, liquidated, or could not be located by the authorities. \nSome SCCs were found to be collecting deposits to finance election campaigns of politicians \nand some are believed to be pyramiding schemes. \n \nD.  Mongolian Stock Exchange (MSE) \n1.  Background \n17.  MSE is the only licensed stock exchange in Mongolia. It was established in 1991 to \nimplement the Government\u2019s privatization policy. During 1992\u20131995, the shares of 475 state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs) worth MNT8.2 billion were sold through MSE. Secondary market \n                                                 \n4 The membership fee is normally as low as MNT500\u20131,000. Ordinary members are not provided opportunities to \noversee the activities and financial conditions of savings and credit cooperatives (SCCs) and to elect the \nmanagement in accordance with the law. Therefore, recruiting members is not different from taking deposit from \nthe public. Thirty-one SCCs were found to be taking deposits from non-members. \n ", "   Appendix 1  29\n \ntrading started in 1995. The number of listed companies has declined from 458 in 1996 to 395 in \n2004 because many listed companies were transformed into limited liability companies, while \nthe number of newly listed companies is very small. About 70 of the 395 listed companies are \nfully or partially owned by the state. In 2004, market capitalization was MNT29.8 billion, or about \n1.4% of GDP and annual trading value was MNT654 million. Annual trading value at MSE \ndeclined from MNT12.2 billion in 1997 to MNT654 million in 2004. Confidence in the equity \nmarket was seriously undermined in the late 1990s, when over 300,000 investors lost close to \nMNT1 billion because of the collapse of the two custodian banks holding clearing funds of equity \ninvestors. After negotiated transactions between buyers and sellers outside MSE were allowed \nsince 1998, such transactions became widespread and resulted in the concentration of shares \nin  fewer  shareholders.  As  a  result,  by  the  beginning  of  2004,  only  1,300  companies  and \nindividuals had accumulated 96% of the shares of all listed companies. However, MSE has not \nbeen used to raise new equity capital by private companies or financial institutions. All the \ncompanies newly listed in the past 3 years were SOEs.  \n \n18.  Government bonds and corporate bonds are also traded at MSE. Total trade value of \nbonds in 2004 was MNT15.3 billion, of which 81.8% were Government bonds and 18.2% \ncorporate  bonds.  Government  bonds  were  first  issued  at  MSE  in  1996.  Since  2000,  the \nGovernment  has  been  issuing  bonds  worth  more  than  MNT10  billion  annually.  The  first \ncorporate bonds were issued at MSE in 2001 and there were eight issuances of corporate \nbonds by the end of 2004. Nearly all of the government bonds and corporate bonds are bought \nby banks and held to maturity, and there is virtually no secondary market trading. The maturity \nof  government  bonds  typically  ranges  from  1  to  8  months  and  the  longest  maturity  of \ngovernment bonds ever issued was two years. \n \n2.  Regulation and Supervision \n19.  The  Law  on  Securities  Market  (2002)  replaced  the  1995  law.  It  provides  for  the \nMongolian  Securities  Exchange  Commission  (MSEC)  to  supervise  the  securities  markets \nactivities,  including  licensing,  regulating,  supervising  stock  exchanges  and  clearing  and \ndepository systems, issuing regulations on securities market transactions, and monitoring the \ncompliance of market participants. However, the law does not empower MSEC to designate and \nsupervise self-regulatory organizations. MSEC has about 20 staff members to supervise the \nsecurities markets and intermediaries. The capacity of MSEC, such as external audit and on-\nsite and off-site inspection functions, has been upgraded through training and investment in \ncomputer  information  systems.  However,  there  is  no  staff  or  office  dedicated  to  perform \nspecialized  technical  duties  of  accountant,  legal  officer,  and  economist,  and  there  is  no \nspecialized enforcement department, which normally is one of the most important activities of \nsecurities regulators. \n \n3.  Financial Conditions and Operations \n20.  In 2003, MSE was divided into two separate legal entities: MSE and Securities Clearing \nHouse and Central Depository. The separation of the trading and listing functions of MSE from \nits  securities  clearing  and  depository  systems  was  aimed  at  improving  transparency  and \naccountability. MSE is organized as a government-owned profit-making joint stock company. \nThe shares of MSE were listed on the stock exchange in 2003. However, the shares are not \ntraded since MSE is 100% government-owned. MSE continues of operate as a traditional SOE \nwith six government representatives on the board, including MSEC, and only one private sector \nrepresentative from a broker/dealer company. \n \n ", "30     Appendix 1 \n21.  MSE has issued regulations on listing of securities; these include listing standards, \nclassifications of securities, and surveillance and examination of listed securities. Listing criteria \ninclude market capitalization, the number of shareholders, the activities of year conducted, and \nasset yield. The securities that meet the listing requirements are assigned to the high section, \nand others are assigned to the low section. The high section is divided into three classes (A, B, \nand C), based on the ranking of companies in the above criteria. Currently, only 21 companies \nare assigned to the high section. The shares of a company can be de-listed if the company is \nliquidated,  merged  with  another  company,  or  reorganized  as  a  limited  liability  company. \nHowever, the shares of companies that do not meet the listing standards are not de-listed. The \nvast majority of listed companies do not comply with basic requirements normally expected of a \nlisted company\u2014i.e., holding annual meeting, filing audited financial statements, disclosing \nimportant events to shareholders. \n \n22.  The financial condition of MSE has deteriorated because of the decline in trade value of \ncorporate shares and government bonds. The revenues from securities transaction commission \nhave declined from MNT223 million in 2002 to MNT30 million in 2004, and the net profit/loss of \nMSE deteriorated from a profit of MNT59 million in 2002 to a loss of MNT116 million in 2004.  \n \nTable A1.3: Summary Statistics for Securities Market \n \nItem  Unit  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004 \n Government Bond Trading Volume  MNT billion  0.0  11.1  30.8  41.7  21.7     12.5 \n   Percentage of GDP  0.0  1.1  2.8  3.4  1.6       0.7 \n Corporate Bond Trading Volume  MNT billion  0.0  0.0  1.2  3.0  2.7       2.8 \n   Percentage of GDP  0.0  0.0  0.1  0.2  0.2       0.2 \n Stock Market Capitalization  MNT billion, year-end  34.4  40.5  41.3  35.8  49.5     29.8 \n   $ million, year-end  32.1  36.9  37.5  31.9  42.4     24.7 \n   Percentage of GDP  3.7  4.0  3.7  2.9  3.6       1.4 \n Stock Trading Volume at MSE  MNT billion  3.3  3.0  1.7  1.4  0.9       0.7 \n  $ million  3.1  2.7  1.6  1.2  0.8       0.5 \n Companies Listed at MSE  Number  418  411  401  403  402     395 \n Newly Listed  Number  1  5  0  8  12         4 \n Delisted  Number  13  12  10  6  13       11 \n Net Profit/Loss of MSE  MNT million  \u2013      \u2013   \u2013   58.9  0.1 (116.2) \n\u2013 = not available, GDP = gross domestic product, MNT = togrog, MSE = Mongolian Stock Exchange. \nSource: Mongolian Stock Exchange. \n \nE.  Securities Markets Intermediaries \n1.  Background \n23.  Mongolia has 25 licensed securities broker/dealer companies. The number has dropped \nfrom 42 in 2000 as a result of rapid decline in trading activity and increase in minimum capital \nrequirement (increased from MNT10 million to MNT50 million in January 2003). Of the 25 \nbroker/dealer companies, two have foreign participation. The sector is highly concentrated with \nthe two largest companies, accounting for 51%, and the five largest companies, accounting for \n70% of the total purchases and sales of shares executed on MSE in 2004. Many of the \nsecurities companies are in Ulaanbaatar, and rural areas are largely not served by any of the \nsecurities brokers. Although there were 17 investment funds in 2000, all of the licenses have \nbeen withdrawn or revoked and there are currently no licensed investment funds. There are also \nno licensed underwriters. However, in 2004, one special underwriting license was granted to a \nbank for underwriting a specific issuance of corporate bonds at MSE. \n ", "   Appendix 1  31\n \n \n2.  Regulation and Supervision \n24.  The Law on Securities Market provides for MSEC to regulate and supervise securities \nmarkets intermediaries, including licensing, monitoring, and penalizing them for breaches of the \nlaw. MSEC sets requirements regarding the qualification of the governing person of securities \nmarkets intermediaries. However, the law does not set or authorize MSEC to set such \u201cfit and \nproper\u201d requirements for securities markets intermediaries and securities issuers. Although the \nLaw on Securities Market provides the framework for licensing and regulating investment funds \nand funds management companies, the framework is weak particularly in terms of segregation \nand protection of fund assets and the governance obligations of the governing persons of \ninvestment companies and funds management companies. \n \n3.  Financial Conditions and Operations \n25.  Most of the securities companies are small and lack capacity. In 2004, 19 of the 25 \nbroker/dealer  companies  executed  stock  purchases  and  sales  of  less  than  MNT50  million \n(minimum capital requirement for a broker/dealer company) and 8 companies less than MNT10 \nmillion. Most of the brokers rely on income from sales of the government bonds through MSE \nand business activities unrelated to the securities business. Most brokers are not engaged in \nthe securities business on a full time basis. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some securities \nbrokers are trading their customers\u2019 securities without consent of the customers. \n \nF.  Insurance Companies \n1.  Background \n26.  Until 1991, there was only one  state-owned insurance company operating\u2014Mongol \nDaatgal. In 1991, another state-owned insurance company, Tushig Daatgal, was established to \nspecialize in agriculture. The first private insurance company, Ard Daatgal, was established in \n1994. Since then, the insurance sector has grown rapidly. The number of insurance companies \nhas increased to 23 in 2004, and both former state-owned insurance companies have been \nprivatized. The amount of premiums collected by insurance companies has increased from \nMNT3.0 billion in 1998 to MNT6.3 billion in 2003. Nevertheless, the sector remains small with \ntotal insurance premium amounting to only 0.5% of GDP. The sector is highly concentrated with \nMongol Daatgal accounting for 74% of total insurance sector premiums in 2003. Aircraft related \n(hull and liability) insurance comprises the largest category of insurance and accounted for 40% \nof the industry. The only class of mandatory insurance is motor vehicle liability, accounting for \n8%  of  total  industry  premium.  Combined  with  property  insurance  for  motor  vehicle,  motor \nvehicle  related  insurance  accounted  for  20%  of  the  industry.  Property  casualty  insurance \naccounted for 15% and the personal accident, disability, and travel insurance in total accounted \nfor about 10%. Mongolian insurance companies do not offer life insurance products. \n \n2.  Regulation and Supervision \n27.  Mongolia\u2019s first  Law  on  Insurance  was  enacted  in  1998.  This  law  provided  for  the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) to license insurance companies and issue regulations. However, the \nlaw designated another agency\u2014Insurance Supervisory Unit (ISU) under the State Agency for \nProfessional Inspectors\u2014to make recommendations to MOF regarding license applications and \nsupervise insurance companies\u2019 compliance with laws and the terms of their licenses. The new \ninsurance  laws  (Law  on  Insurance  and  Law  on  Licensing  and  Supervision  of  Insurance \nIntermediaries), prepared with Asian Development Bank (ADB) support, were enacted in 2004. \n ", "32     Appendix 1 \nThe new laws designate the to-be-established nonbank regulatory agency to supervise the \nsector, including through licensing, compliance monitoring, investigations, enforcement, and \nissuing  regulations.  ISU  has  only  seven  staff  members,  none  of  whom  have  specialized \nexpertise in insurance.  \n \n3.  Financial Conditions and Operations \n28.  There are 23 insurance companies in a market of only MNT6.3 billion, with one dominant \ncompany accounting for 74%. Since most insurance companies are small, they are especially \nvulnerable to shocks from large claims. Two insurance companies have gone bankrupt during \nthe past 18 months. The amount of insurance premium paid by an individual for a motor vehicle \nliability insurance or a personal accident insurance is typically as low as $2\u20133 equivalent. It is \nunlikely that the cost of a traffic accident can be covered by insurance claim payments under \nsuch a low level of insurance premiums. \n \n29.  The payout ratio (claims paid as a percentage of total premiums collected) is low at \nabout 20%. The low payout ratio is largely due to the reluctance of some insurers to pay claims \nowed to policy holders. In 2003, only two insurance companies recorded a payout ratio higher \nthan 25% (102% and 44%), one of which went bankrupt. The total operating expense of the \nentire sector was MNT2.1 billion (57% of the net premium income, i.e., insurance premium \ncollected minus reinsurance premium paid). Seven of the 21 companies made losses in 2003 \nand the net profit/loss after tax of the entire sector was negative in 2003.  \n \nTable A1.4: Summary Statistics for the Insurance Sector \n \nItem  Unit  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004   \nInsurance Companies  Number   10 13 15  17  21 23  \n Insurance Premium Collected  MNT billion  3.8 4.2 5.2  6.1  6.3  \n  Percentage change  25.5 11.9 22.3  18.9  2.8  \n  Percentage of GDP  0.4 0.4 0.5  0.5  0.5  \n Insurance Claim Paid  MNT billion  0.8 1.1 1.8  1.1  1.2  \n Payout Ratio  Percentage  22.1 25.2 34.2  17.3  19.6  \nGDP = gross domestic product, MNT = togrog. \nSource: Insurance Supervisory Unit. \n \n ", "  \n \n \n \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \nBanking Sector  Nonbank Financial  Securities Market  Insurance Industry  Anti-Money  Tax Reform \nInstitutions (NBFIs)  and Intermediaries  Laundering \nand Savings and \nCredit Cooperatives \n(SCCs) \n\u2022  Technical advice to BOM  \u2022  Equity investments,  FRGP  \u2022  Index-based  \u2022  Technical advice  \u2022  Recommendation \nfor bank supervision,  credit lines and TA  (i)   Establish NBFRC  Livestock  for drafting an  for tax reforms \npayment and settlement  to the largest NBFI  (ii)  Strengthen legal  Insurance Project  AML law (IMF)  through the \nsystem, and accounting  Credit Mongol for  and regulatory  supporting the    Economic Policy \nand internal audit in  micro and small  framework for the  development of  \u2022  Advisory  Reform and \ncommercial banks (IMF)  lending (DFID,  securities market  the livestock  assistance for  Competitiveness \n  KfW, EU, and  development  insurance (World  AML regulations  Project (USAID) \n\u2022  Financial Capacity  UNDP)  (iii)  Enhance investor  Bank)  and investigative   \nDevelopment Project to    confidence    procedures, and  \u2022  Technical advice \nimprove risk management  \u2022  Advisory support  (iv) Strengthen MSE  FRGP   short-term training  for fiscal reforms \nof banks and modernization  and TA to develop  and improve its  (i)   Establish NBFRC  (US Department of  including tax policy \nof payments systems and  leasing industry  listing standards   (ii)  Strengthen  Treasury)  (IMF) \ninstruments (World Bank)  (IFC)  (v)  Strengthen  insurance     \n    corporate  legislation and  \u2022  Ongoing TA for  FRGP \n\u2022  Credit line for on-lending to  \u2022  Rural Finance  governance of  regulations  developing a AML        Remove tax \nprivate sector and risk  Project to promote  securities market    legislation,  impediments to the \nmanagement training to  rural SCCs (ADB)  intermediaries  regulation, and  development of \nqualifying commercial    and securities  blueprint for IT- capital markets \nbanks (World Bank)  FRGP  issuers  MIS (ADB)  and nonbank \n  (i)   Establish NBFRC  (vi) Improve    financial sector  \n\u2022  Subordinated loan to Khan  (ii)  Provide a legal and  accounting,  FRGP   \nBank and micro credit loan  regulatory basis for  auditing, and  Establish an \nand technical assistance to  the regulation and  disclosure   effective AML \nXac Bank (IFC)  supervision of    regime by \n  SCCs  adopting law and \n\u2022  Equity participation and  (iii) Strengthen  regulations, \n \nsubordinated loan to the  corporate  establishing a  A\np\nTrade and Development  governance of  financial  p\ne\nBank (ADB and IFC)  NBFIs  intelligence unit,  nd\n    and building  ix 2\n\u2022  soHufo pmupsooirnrttggin aFggi netha leon acdene  vPmeraolorjkepecmtt  ent  camanopdna pecryiot-ylsa etuocn urdeteep roinrtg   3            \n(ADB)  cases  3\n \n ", "  \n3\n4\n \n \n \n \nBanking Sector  Nonbank Financial  Securities Market  Insurance Industry  Anti-Money  Tax Reform    \n \nInstitutions (NBFIs)  and Intermediaries  Laundering    \n \n \nand Savings and  A\np\nCredit Cooperatives  pe\nn\n(SCCs)  d\nix\n 2\n\u2022  Support to Khan Bank             \nthrough two credit advisors \nto introduce a fixed-asset, \nterm-lending techniques \n(EBRD) \n \n\u2022  Resident advisor to BOM \n(JICA).

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Mongolia: \nThe financial sector contributes to poverty reduction through its pivotal role in facilitating sustainable economic growth. \nBy mobilizing savings and channeling them to productive investment in the real sector, the financial sector promotes \neconomic growth and creates jobs, thereby reducing poverty. The financial sector also directly helps to reduce \npoverty. By increasing access to credit, an efficient financial sector enables the poor to engage in income-generating \nactivities. By increasing access to savings and insurance products, an a broad-based financial system also helps \nsafeguard the poor and the vulnerable segments of the population from negative shocks to their incomes and enables \nthem to meet unanticipated expenditure needs.  \n \nLow-income households are most vulnerable to the loss of savings from banking crises. The poor are also especially \nvulnerable to the adverse consequences of financial crises such as job loss caused by increased bankruptcies, as well \nas higher taxes and inflation and lower social expenditures. A well-governed financial sector reduces the likelihood \nand severity of financial crises, and provides safeguard against a corresponding increase in poverty incidence.  \n \nThe country strategy and program for Mongolia identifies underdevelopment of the financial sector as a cause of \npoverty. The cost of borrowing in Mongolia is high, and financial outreach is limited. Bank lending is predominantly \ncollateral-based, and low-income households are particularly affected by the high cost of collateral registration. The \nlack of long-term funds limits investment and constrains economic growth. There are few savings instruments and \ninsurance products. Poor governance practices undermine the stability of the financial system and investor protection. \nAddressing these weaknesses to develop an efficient, well-balanced, and well-governed financial system will be \ncrucial for reducing the cost of borrowing, increasing investment, and creating jobs.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nIn 2003, the Government finalized a national poverty reduction strategy in the form of the Economic Growth Support \nand Poverty Reduction Strategy, from which the new Government derived a new law outlining the National Action Plan \nfor 2004\u20132008. Two components are particularly prominent in the Government\u2019s strategy: higher, stable private \nsector-led growth aimed at improving living standards and reducing income disparities; and social development aimed \nat improving income opportunities and the quality of public services and accessibility for the poor. The strategy \noutlines financial sector priorities to support growth, including the development of long-term lending and diverse \nfinancial  services,  lower  interest  rates,  and  wider  access  to  credit.  Toward  its  social  development  goal,  the \nGovernment intends to create jobs and income opportunities through investment in education and private sector \ndevelopment. The Financial Regulation and Governance Program (FRGP) is fully consistent with the Government\u2019s \nmedium-term objective of promoting private sector-led growth. \n \nThe FRGP supports the strengthening of corporate governance in banks and the improvement of the collateral \nframework. Poor governance in banks could undermine depositor protection, and jeopardize the savings of low-\nincome households. By introducing legal and regulatory measures to improve internal controls in commercial banks, \nthe FRGP will contribute toward mitigating such risks and ensuring depositor protection. By lowering the (perceived) \nrisk of lending and the cost of collateral registration, improved collateral framework will help reduce the cost of \nborrowing and facilitate access to credit by the poor. \n \nThe FRGP supports the development of the nonbank financial sector, including capital markets, insurance sector, \nnonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) and savings and credit cooperatives (SCCs). The FRGP will promote capital \nmarket  development  by  strengthening  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  and  strengthening  governance  and \ndisclosure to protect investors. Capital market development will support long-term economic growth and employment \ncreation by facilitating resource mobilization and investment. Further, capital market development will help lower the \ncost of borrowing by creating alternatives to bank loans. This will improve the poor\u2019s access to credit. \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  67 \nThe FRGP also includes measures to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for the insurance sector. This will \ncontribute to mitigating solvency risks of insurance companies, ensuring payment of claims due, diversifying insurance \nproducts, and thereby mitigating the impact catastrophic events that could destroy economic opportunities of the poor.  \nNBFIs and SCCs typically provide small loans and other financial services to households and employment-generating \nsmall- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The sound and orderly development of this sector under adequate \nsupervision will improve access to financial services, and enable SMEs to grow and create more employment. \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \n \nExtensive consultations with stakeholders \u2013 including regulators, government ministries, members of parliament, \nfinancial institutions and other private sector participants \u2013 have been conducted during program preparation. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \nEffective participation among relevant government bodies and stakeholders will be facilitated through the \nestablishment of appropriate working groups and committees. \nD.
