The local response to flooding will be strengthened through the installation of \nflood  forecasting  and  early  warning  systems  (FFEWS)  and  community-based  disaster  risk \nmanagement (CBDRM). \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nStrategic  context.  Nepal\u2019s  comparatively  low  level  of  development  in  South  Asia  and \ncomplex  geography  render  the  country  vulnerable  to  climate  change  impacts  and  prone  to \nnatural  hazards.4  During  the  monsoon  season  (June\u2013September),  Nepal  receives  80%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s annual rainfall, resulting in widespread inundation in low-lying areas. Underlying flood \nrisk drivers include (i) increasing frequency and intensity of precipitation events and flooding in \nthe Terai region; (ii) unplanned population growth from the mountain and hill regions, drawn by \nproductive  agricultural  and  commercial  land;  (iii)  inadequate  and  deteriorated  flood  protection \ninfrastructure; and (iv) the inability of communities and local governments to anticipate for and \nquickly  respond  to  flooding.  With  climate  change,  flooding  events  are  expected  to  increase  in \nintensity  and  frequency,  and  the  associated  increasing  damage  costs  threaten  the  country\u2019s \neconomic  development.  Disasters  disproportionally  affect  the  poor  and  marginalized  because \nthey  occupy  the  most  hazard-exposed  areas,  and  this  will  undermine  the  country\u2019s  progress \ntoward poverty reduction. This is compounded with the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \noutbreak as rural poor are the most vulnerable and less resilient to impacts to their livelihoods. \n \n4. \nThe  Terai  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  flood  events,  and  damage  from  flooding  in  the \nregion can have a significant impact on the rest of the country, as it is Nepal\u2019s largest producer \nof  agricultural  produce.  The  region  has  only  17%  of  Nepal\u2019s  total  land  area,  but  accounts  for \n51%  of  the  2.64  million  hectares  (ha)  of  cultivable  land.  The  total  damage  by  the  2017  Terai \n\n \n\n1  Of  which  (i)  $500,000  will  be  provided  by  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF  6)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  (ii)  $750,000  will  be  provided  by  the  Netherlands  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. \n\n2  The Terai region is a lowland region in southern Nepal. \n3  Government of Nepal, Water and Energy Commission Secretariat. 2002. Nepal National Water Plan, 2002\u20132027. \n\nKathmandu. \n\n4  As  of  2018,  Nepal\u2019s  human  development  index  of  0.574  was  below  the  average  of  0.638  for  countries  in  South \nAsia.  United  Nations  Development  Program.  2018.  Human  Development  Indices  and  Indicators:  2018  Statistical \nUpdate. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\fflood event was estimated at $584.70 million, almost 3% of Nepal\u2019s gross domestic product. The \nregion is witnessing significant male outward migration to urban areas and overseas in search \nof  economic  opportunities.  This  has  led  to  a  situation  where  women  take  additional  primary \nresponsibilities, including flood response, in addition to household responsibilities.  \n \n5. \nFlood  risk  management.  Several  government  agencies  are  involved  in  flood  risk \nmanagement.5 However, there are both structural and nonstructural challenges, such as lack of \nfinancial  investment  in  construction  and  maintenance  of  flood  protection  assets;  and  limited \ntechnical  capacity  of  national  and  local  government  agencies  in  planning  and  prioritizing \ninfrastructure  requested  by  communities.  The  Department  of  Water  Resources  and  Irrigation \n(DWRI)  is  responsible  for  all  infrastructure  protection  works  for  water-induced  disasters. \nHowever, the DWRI does not have comprehensive flood risk mitigation planning, which results \nin nonoptimal construction of embankment works. Further, gaps in Nepal\u2019s hydrometeorological \nstations, operated by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), and a lack of flood \nforecasting models result in local communities and local governments having little or no warning \nof potential flooding events. Further, communities are not fully prepared for flooding because of \nlimited warnings of impending flood events.  \n\n6. \nPolicy  framework.  The  government  acknowledges  the  country\u2019s  flooding  challenges \nand  has  developed  key  policy  directives  and  goals  that  seek  to  reduce  the  vulnerability  of \ncommunities  by  increasing  their  adaptive  capacity  to  manage  flood  risks.  Specifically,  the \nNational Water Plan promotes risk reduction for severe flooding through improved infrastructure, \nfunctional  water-induced  disaster  warning  systems,  integrated  water  resources  management, \nand  community-level  disaster  preparedness  programs  (footnote  3).6  The  National  Strategy  for \nDisaster Risk Management supports the development of modern hydrometeorological and early \nwarning  systems.7  The  Constitution  of  Nepal  2015  and  the  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  and \nManagement  Act  2017  establish  the  governance  and  administrative  structure  for  disaster  risk \nmanagement under the federal structure. At the local level, CBDRM committees are responsible \nfor  engaging  the  whole  community  in  disaster  preparedness.  At  the  municipality  level,  local \ndisaster  management  committees  provide  the  platform  to  effectively  implement  CBDRM \nactivities by providing the linkages between local and national risk mitigation measures. \n \nADB  experience  and  lessons.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting \n7. \nsimilar  flood  risk  management  projects  in  South  Asia,8  including  the  Bagmati  River  Basin \nImprovement  Project  in  Nepal,  which  incorporates  participatory  designs,  sustainable  asset \nmanagement  systems,  and  high-level  technology  for  FFEWSs.9  Key  lessons  learned  that  are \napplied  in  the  project  include:  (i)  incorporating  sustainability  of  project  assets  in  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  arrangements,  (ii)  designs  that  consider  disaster  risks  and  climate \n\n \n\n5  Department  of  Water  Resources  and  Irrigation,  Department  of  Hydrology  and  Meteorology,  Ministry  of  Home \n\nAffairs, Ministry of Defence, and Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration. \n\n6  The plan includes evacuation plans, rehearsals and drills, and training with the formation of standing committees. \n7  Government  of  Nepal,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs.  2009.

The project supports the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 by (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (iii) \npromoting  rural  development  and  food  security; (iv) strengthening  governance and  institutional \ncapacity; and (v) accelerating progress in gender equality by promoting women\u2019s involvement in \nthe CBDRM activities.11 The project outputs also contribute to ADB\u2019s Operational Plan on water, \n2011\u20132020, and Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020.12 \n \n9. \nProject  area  and  COVID-19.  The  project  will  focus  on  flood  risk  management  for  six \npriority  river  basins (subprojects)  in  the  Terai:  West  Rapti, Mawa  Ratuwa,  Lakhandei,  Mohana \nKhutiya,  East  Rapti,  and  Bakraha.13  These  river  basins  do  not  have  effective  flood  protection \nembankments.  From  1991  to  2014,  these  river  basins  experienced  199  floods  that  reportedly \naffected  143,486  people  and  caused  273  deaths  and  the  destruction  of  4,284  houses.The \ncommunities that will benefit from this project are those most impacted by this regular flooding. \nCOVID-19  has  negatively  impacted  the  Terai  region  with  border  restrictions  to  India  and \nmovement across districts controlled.  The majority of COVID cases in Nepal are located in the \nTerai region. Flooding will pose further risk through preventing travel and limiting people\u2019s travel \nand  limiting  people\u2019s  ability  to  access  essential  items  and  services  that  help  mitigate  risks  of \nCOVID-19. Public sector support is justified, as flood protection works are communal assets that \ndo not directly generate revenue. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  social  and  economic  losses  due  to \nwater-induced  disasters  reduced  (footnote  3).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome: \nresilience of communities to flood risks of selected river basins in the Terai region improved.14 \n \n11. \nOutput 1: Flood protection infrastructure and maintenance system improved. The \nproject  will  reduce  direct  impacts  from  flooding  through  (i)  construction  of  flood  control \ninfrastructure (embankments, spurs,  and  outlet  structures);  (ii)  planning  and  implementation  of \nbioengineering  of  river  embankments  for  enhanced  flood  risk  management,  using  suitable \nvegetative methods to prevent soil erosion; and (iii) development of maintenance manuals and \nan  asset  management  system  for  flood  protection  infrastructure.

Factors such as the following were taken into consideration: likelihood and/or magnitude of flood damage, \npoverty index, impact on human well-being, loss of life, and equitable distribution of projects between regions. \n\n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fexpected  to  generate  employment  for  at  least  10%  of  the  affected  households,  including \nindigenous peoples, Dalits and women. \n \n12. \nOutput  2:  Flood  forecasting  and  response  systems  enhanced.  The  project  will \nsupport  the  government  and  communities  in  flood-prone  areas  to  improve  early  flood  warning \nsystems  through  (i)  installing  about  40  rain  gauges  and  30  hydrometeorological  stations, \n(ii) developing about 5 FFEWS, and (iii) improving maintenance of FFEWS. \n \nOutput  3:  Flood  prevention  and  preparedness  capacity  improved.  This  will  be \n13. \ndelivered  by  (i)  undertaking  an  organizational  capacity  building  program  on  flood  risk \nmanagement  and  infrastructure  planning  for  the  DWRI  and  local  governments  (municipalities, \nvillage  municipalities  and  provincial  governments);  (ii)  developing  the  capacity  of  local \ncommunities  on  disaster  preparedness;  (iii)  constructing  about  48  flood  shelters  with  gender-\nresponsive  features;  and  (iv)  developing  CBDRM  plans,  in  consultation  with  community \nstakeholders  (including  women)  and  in  line  with  local  development  plans  and  budgets  that \nintegrate disaster risk information.15 \n \nC. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s value addition was initiated by supporting the government\u2019s comprehensive study \nof  25  river  basins  in  the  Terai  to  identify  the  priority  river  areas  through  both  flood  hazard \nmapping  and  hydraulic  modeling  of  whole  river  systems  (footnote  13).  The  project  design \nincludes international best practices for embankment designs, (ii) allowance for climate change \nand increased flood flows, and (iii) bioengineering and nature-based solutions. The project also \nbuilds  upon  two  ADB  TA  projects:  (i)  Mainstreaming  Climate  Change  Risk  Management  in \nDevelopment;  and  (ii)  Strengthening  Integrated  Flood  Risk  Management.16  The  project \ncomplements  the  initiatives  of  other  development  partners  supporting  Nepal\u2019s  flood  risk \nmanagement and FFEWS. The project closely aligns with the World Bank\u2019s Building Resilience \nto  Climate  Related  Hazards  project,  which  supports  the  DHM  with  institutional  strengthening, \ncapacity building, modernization of the observation networks and forecasting, and enhancement \nof the service delivery system.17 \n\nValue Added by ADB \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $63.00 million (Table 1). \n\n \n\n \n\n15 CBDRM includes developing flood risk maps and supporting implementation of nonstructural measures  prioritized \n\nin community plans, especially measures related to strengthening livelihood resilience. \n\n16 ADB. 2011.

The  TA  is  proposed to  be  attached rather than  under  the \nloan  to  better  integrate  international  expertise  and  best  practices  into  DHM  and  DWRI \noperations,  leveraging  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  other  similar  TA  projects  (footnote  16).  ADB  will \nrecruit  an  international  consulting  firm  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as \namended from time to time) to carry out the TA activities. \n \n21. \nThe  TA  is  estimated to cost  $1.315 million,  of  which  (i)  $500,000  will  be  financed  on  a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF  6)  and  (ii)  $750,000  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility and administered by ADB.

Feasibility  studies  were  guided  by  the  flood  risk  hazard \nmapping prepared under the prefeasibility study (footnote 13). The priority areas were identified \nthrough  computer  modeling  incorporating  climate  change  combined  with  field  observations. \nDetailed designs were completed for Mawa Ratuwa and Mohanna Khutiya for project readiness. \n \nStructural interventions include embankments, gabion riverbank and bed protection, and \n23. \nriver-training  spurs  to  protect  adjacent  areas  from  erosion  and  flooding.  The  project  design \nfocuses on promoting sustainability, environment-friendly bioengineering, adaptability, and low-\ncost  solutions,  and  uses  locally  available  materials  and  similar  designs  to  the  current  DWRI \napproach.  This  allows for relatively  simple  maintenance that  communities  and the  government \ncan  manage.  The  project  will  prepare  O&M  manuals  and  an  asset  management  system  to \npromote  sustainability  of  the  investment.  Climate  adaptation  measures  are  included  in  the \n\n \n\n21 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 The TA will help (i) develop and disseminate O&M manuals; (ii) provide training in estimating required maintenance \nneeds  and  preparation  of  sufficient  budget  requests;  and  (iii)  develop  an  up-to-date  fixed-asset  register  with \ninformation on the asset location, condition, annual maintenance needs, and past maintenance history. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial Viability \n\ndesigns, such as provision for increased flows in waterways based on climate change models, \nand the adaptability of embankments that can be raised in the future. \n \n24. \nThe proposed FFEWS will be compatible with the DHM\u2019s system. Telemetry rain gauges \nand  hydrometric  stations  will  be  installed  in  the  project  subbasins, from which  the  data  will  be \nused  in  the  hydrological  and  hydrodynamic  flood  inundation  models  developed  under  the \nproject. The models will then alert the DHM to provide early warnings via mass short messaging \nservice  through  agreements  with  local  telecommunications  providers.  Similarly,  the  CBDRM \nplanning  will  follow  the  frameworks  set  out  in  the  government\u2019s  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  and \nManagement Act 2017 utilizing local disaster management committees (para. 6). \n \nB. \n \n25. \nEconomic analysis. Economic and financial analyses were conducted for the proposed \nsubprojects and entire project. The economic costs include direct investment costs, O&M costs, \nassociated capacity building, and project management costs. Quantified benefits come from the \navoided losses (i.e., the damage no longer incurred by flooding) accruing with implementation of \nthe  flood  protection  measures.  These  benefits  include  avoided  losses  from  (i) damage  and \ndestruction  of  buildings  and  public  infrastructure;  (ii)  damage  to  household  contents; \n(iii) damage  to  crops;  (iv)  loss  of  livestock;  and  (v)  funeral  costs  and  medical  care  costs  of \ninjured people. Quantified benefits also account for continued population growth and increased \ninvestment  within  the flood  protected  beneficiary  area and  avoidance  of temporary commodity \nprice increases during and immediately following flood events. The project\u2019s economic internal \nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  at  9.05%.  The  subproject  EIRRs  are  9.01%  for  Mohana \nKhutiya,  15.24%  for  Bakraha  and  17.96%  for  West  Rapti,  with  the  avoidance  of  losses  to \ninfrastructure being the most significant benefits. The EIRRs for the East Rapti, Lakhandei and \nMawa  Ratuwa  subprojects  were  assessed  to  be  below  the  9%  minimum  threshold.  However, \ntheir  inclusion  is  justified  to  ensure  a  more  equitable  distribution  of  project  benefits  to  highly \ndisadvantaged and poor communities. Implementing these subprojects will contribute to a sense \nof inclusion in national life as well as harmonious development of the economy in the Terai.24 \n \n26. \nSensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  results  are  satisfactory  against  downside  risks, \nincluding an increase in project capital costs, an increase in O&M costs, and a decline in project \nbenefits.  The  project  will  increase  its  economic  viability  even  further  if  unquantifiable  benefits, \nsuch as environmental improvements or reduced human mortality associated with flood events, \nare included in the analysis.25 \n \n27. \nFinancial sustainability. As the project will not generate revenue, the DHM and DWRI \nwill be responsible for maintaining the assets created under the project. Historic data suggests \nthat the DHM and DWRI may not be able to fully secure maintenance funds, and there is a risk \nthat the project assets will not last for their entire expected economic life.  To mitigate this risk, \nthe  project  design  includes  the  following  measures:  (i)  embankment  designs  are  simple  and \nsimilar to government practices, (ii) the local communities and adjacent farmers will participate \nin  embankment  maintenance,  (iii)  the  FFEWS  contract  includes  a  4-year  maintenance  period, \nand (iv) the attached TA will improve asset management and build institutional capacity (para. \n20).  The  loan  and  grant  agreements  include  covenants  to  ensure  that  adequate  funds  for \n\n24 Ensuring the project extends to marginalized groups, including the indigenous population, is important for political \n\ninclusivity, as the Terai has a history of political instability and violence. \n\n25 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nSustainability \n\nmaintenance will be provided to the DHM and DWRI throughout the estimated economic life of \nthe improved assets. \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe project supports the sustainability of infrastructure through a multipronged approach \ncomprising  (i)  an  infrastructure  asset  management  information  system  as  a  basis  of  sound \nmonitoring,  planning,  and  implementation  of  maintenance  and  adaptation;  (ii)  adoption  of \ncommunity contracting to support minor maintenance activities; and (iii) capacity building of the \nDHM, DWRI, and local governments to improve monitoring and maintenance activities. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nFinancial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  DHM  and  DWRI \nwas  conducted  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of \nProjects.26  The  assessment  concluded  that  the  DHM  and  DWRI  have  adequate  financial \nmanagement  capability  to  (i)  record  the  required  financial  transactions,  (ii) provide  reliable \nannual financial statements and audit reports in a timely manner, and (iii) safeguard the financial \nassets. The assessment identified the following risks: (i) frequent project staff turnover in DWRI, \n(ii) the DHM lacks knowledge and experience with ADB procedures and systems, and (iii) weak \ninternal  auditing  in  both  DHM  and  DWRI.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial  management \nrisk is moderate. The identified risks will be mitigated by (i) assigning qualified account staff to \nthe  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and  project  implementation  unit,  (ii)  engaging  a  financial \nmanagement  consultant  to  support  project  implementation,  (iii) providing  training  in  ADB \nprocedures  and  systems,  (iv)  including  comprehensive  financial  information  in  the  quarterly \nproject  progress  reports,  and  (v)  using  ADB  disbursement  systems  to  reconcile  the  accounts. \nMoreover, the project will follow established practice and maintain separate books of accounts \nfollowing  the  government\u2019s  accounting  standards  under  the  cash  basis  of  accounting; \nadditionally, the project financial statements will be audited annually by the Office of the Auditor \nGeneral in accordance with International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions standards. \n \n30. \nProcurement.  All  procurement  and  recruitment  of  consultants  to  be  financed  by  the \nADB  loan  and  grant  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  and \nProcurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers.  While  Nepal\u2019s  procurement  risk  rating  is \nsubstantial,  the  implementing  agencies  are  experienced  in  implementing  ADB  and  other \nexternally  assisted  projects,  and  the  project  procurement  risks  are  moderate.  Mitigation \nmeasures  include:  (i)  engaging  an  experienced  procurement  specialist  under  the  project \nimplementation consultants (PIC); and (ii) the PIC providing on-the-job training in procurement \nand  contract  management  to  the  DHM  and  DWRI,  and  assisting  in  developing  a  database  to \nregularly update and monitor contract management plans. \n \n31. \nThrough strategic market analysis, the project has adopted standard bidding documents \nto  encourage  healthy  competition  and  to  align  with  government  approval  processes.27  Civil \nworks  contracts  will  be  awarded  on  a  least-cost  basis  and  abnormally  low  bids  will  be  either \nrejected  or  performance  guarantees  increased. The  turnkey  FFEWS  package  will  be  procured \nas  goods  (under  a  supply,  install,  commission,  operate,  and  maintain  contract)  contributing  to \nachieving  value  for  money.

The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nE. \n \n32. \nPoverty.  The  project  outputs  will  benefit  poor  and  marginalized  groups,  as  they  are \nfrequently  affected  by  flooding  in  the  region.  The  project\u2019s  poverty  and  social  assessment \nhighlights that beneficiary households experience food insecurity (60%) and earn their livelihood \nfrom  daily  wage  work,  agricultural  labor,  construction  work,  or  small  businesses.28  Community \nconsultations, conducted as part of the poverty and social assessment, highlight that recurrent \nflooding affects farmland, crops, livestock, livelihoods, and property. Agricultural and residential \nlands  frequently  wash  into  rivers,  causing  landlessness  and  physical  displacement.  School \nroutines  are  disrupted  during  the monsoon  season  and families  abandon  land  plots for  fear  of \nflooding,  despite  land  being  a  critical  livelihood  asset.  About  65%  of  the  directly  impacted \npopulation  comprises  people  from  marginalized  ethnic  or  caste  groups.  With  the  economic \ndisruption  caused  by  COVID-19,  vulnerable  individuals,  particularly  those  who  are  just  above \nthe poverty line, are likely to be pushed below the poverty line.  \n \n33. \nGender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  project  will \nsupport marginalized groups (including women), differently abled people, and caste and ethnic \nminorities  through  a  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  action  plan  (GESI-AP).29  During \npreparation,  over  50  community  consultations  were  held  across  the  subproject  areas.  About \n30% of the 1,595 total participants were women and girls from diverse ethnic and caste groups. \nParticipants  expressed  that  women  are  disproportionately  impacted  by  flooding  events \ncompared  with  men.  Women  are  greatly  burdened  during  flooding  events  and  post-disaster \nrecovery  given  their  status  as  primary  caregivers.  In  flood-prone  areas,  there  is  a  need  to \naddress women\u2019s preparedness, responsiveness, and post-flooding recovery. The GESI-AP will \nmainstream  a  gender-sensitive  and  socially  inclusive  approach  to  all  project  activities.  For \nexample, the GESI-AP targets (i) at least 15% of construction laborers are women; (ii) all flood \nshelters and labor camps have adequate facilities (e.g., ramps, separate rooms for women, and \nseparate  toilets);  and  (iii)  CDBRM  committees  have  at  least  33%  women  members.  GESI-AP \nactivities and implementing arrangements are detailed in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nF. \n\nSafeguards \n\n34. \ncategories are as follows.30 \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\n \n35. \nEnvironment (category B).

The  IEEs  were \nprepared  following  the  national  environmental  provisions  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  The  IEEs  include  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  which  identifies  the \npotential  environmental  impacts  and  proposes  mitigation  measures,  a  monitoring  plan,  and \ninstitutional  arrangements.  The  EMP  also  requires \noverall  safeguards \noccupational  health  and  safety  measures  for  project  staff  and  nearby  communities,  including \n\nimplementation \n\n \n\n28 Poverty  and  Social  Assessment  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).

The IEEs will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website based on the \nrequirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement and ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy. \n \n36. \nThe  project  will  not  encroach  upon  national  parks  and  buffer  zones,  protected  or \nsensitive  ecosystems,  and  ancient  heritage  sites.  The  project\u2019s  key  activities  that  attract \nenvironmental  concerns are  construction of  embankments,  flood  shelters,  FFEWS,  and  quarry \noperation. The environmental impacts predicted during implementation are mainly restricted to \nthe  construction  stage  and  will  be  site  specific,  short  in  duration,  reversible,  and  of  low \nsignificance, such as temporary dust in the air, sediments in water, and noise pollution. \n \n37. \nThe DHM and DWRI have adequate capacity to manage the potential impacts, and the \nPIC  environmental  specialist  will  provide  additional  training  to  DHM  and  DWRI.  The  PMU \nenvironmental officer will be responsible for addressing overall environmental concerns related \nto construction. The field offices will oversee the implementation of the IEEs\u2019 recommendations \nand  the  EMP,  assisted  by  the  PIC  environmental  specialist.  All  contractors  will  have  an \nenvironmental  specialist  who  will  manage  environmental  impacts  related  to  construction.  The \nproject\u2019s  safeguards  performance  will  be  reported  through  quarterly  progress  reports  and \nsemiannual  environmental  compliance  monitoring  reports  during  construction,  and  annual \nmonitoring reports during O&M. Consultation with stakeholders and affected people was carried \nout  during  project  preparation  and  will  continue  during  implementation.  The  project  grievance \nredress mechanism will resolve complaints in a timely and systematic manner. \n \n38. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  social  safeguards  due  diligence  confirms \nthat  there  is  no  physical  or  economic  displacement  because  of  involuntary  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary  restriction  on  land  use  under  the  project.31  Project  infrastructure  is  estimated  to \nrequire (i) about 50 ha of land for construction of embankments (with a width of up to 12 meters) \nacross five river basins, (ii) 1.6 ha of land for construction of 48 community flood shelters (about \n340 square meters per flood shelter) across six river basins, and (iii) 0.02 ha of land for the 30 \nrain  gauge  stations  (about  five  square  meters  per  station).  The  project  will  satisfy  land  use \nrequirements through  a combination  of  government  land,  negotiated  settlement,  and  voluntary \nland contributions from direct project beneficiaries. \n \nIndigenous peoples (category B). Most project beneficiaries are from ethnically distinct \n39. \nand  vulnerable  groups.  The  consultation  process  identified  multiple  ethnic  groups  that  are \nanticipated  to  benefit  from  the  project  activities;  these  groups  include  the  Bote,  Chepang, \nGurung, Magar, Madheshi, Newar, Rai, Tamang and Tharus. Consultations confirm that project \nactivities will not adversely affect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, culture, territory, \nnatural,  or  cultural  resources  of  indigenous  peoples.  As  per  Appendix  3,  para.  17  of  ADB's \nSafeguard Policy Statement, a separate indigenous peoples plan is not required, as indigenous \npeoples are the majority of direct project beneficiaries, and only positive impacts are identified. \nThe  project  design  has  mainstreamed  a  culturally  sensitive  approach  to  information  sharing, \nmeaningful consultation, and benefit sharing. \n \nG. \n \n40. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n31 Social Safeguards Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nand \n\nPolitical \nCOVID-19 \nuncertainties  may  adversely \naffect project implementation \n\nprojections \n\nFuture climate change impact \nand \nexceeds \nnegatively affects the project \nLack  of  maintenance  funds \nfor \nflood  embankment \nstructures or the FFEWS \n\nthe \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe prolonged political transition and adoption of a federal system, along with \nassociated potential disruptions, may affect project implementation. This risk is \nmitigated by aligning the project\u2019s implementation arrangements with those of \nthe  ongoing  People\u2019s  Embankment  Program.  Measures  to  control  COVID-19 \nmay also slow down construction schedules. \nEmbankment  designs  allow  for  climate  change  and  are  adaptable  for  future \nstructural  changes,  as  needed.  Community-based  disaster  risk  management \nplans will also be responsive to mitigating the impacts of climate change. \nThe  government  assures  an  annual  budgetary  allocation  to  meet  operation \nand maintenance needs; this allocation is included in the loan covenants. The \nFFEWS contract includes a 4-year maintenance period. The attached technical \nassistance will strengthen maintenance planning and asset management. \n\nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease; FFEWS = flood forecasting and early warning system. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n41. \nThe government and MEWRI have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  requirements,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  financial  management,  and \ndisbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  PAM  and  loan  documents.
