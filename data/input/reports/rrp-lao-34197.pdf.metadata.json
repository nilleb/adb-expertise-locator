It  will  further  support  the  decentralization  of  the  water \nsupply sector\u2500 following the Government\u2019s water supply sector policy\u2500 \nby  strengthening  the  regulatory  framework  and  the  sector\u2019s  planning \ncapacity.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in \nimplementing the updated water supply sector investment plan through \ninvestments in water supply systems and associated urban facilities in \nabout 12 small towns in the Northern and Central Regions. Formulated \nas a sector project, the Project requires the towns and their provincial \nauthorities  to  demonstrate  their  commitment  to  the  Project  and  its \nassociated  reforms.  It  has  a  strong  community  participation  focus \nreinforced  by  integrated  poverty  reduction,  and  health  and  hygiene \npromotion  programs.  New  approaches  to  small  town  water  supply \nmodels and strategies to curtail capital costs have been introduced. \n \nThe Lao PDR has successfully reduced the nation\u2019s poverty incidence \nfrom  45%  in  1993  to  32%  in  2003.  However,  due  to  unbalanced \neconomic  development,  poverty  incidence  fell  only  marginally  in  the \nNorthern  Region,  which  has  the  highest  incidence  of  poverty  at  52% \nand is home to 25 of the nation\u2019s 47 poor districts officially identified as \npriorities  for  development.  The  Government\u2019s  National  Growth  and \nPoverty  Eradication  Strategy  (NGPES,  2004)  aims  to  reduce  poverty \nthrough  strong  economic  growth  and  increased  emphasis  on  the \npoorest  districts.  It  focuses  on  health,  including  water  supply  and \nsanitation, as one of four priority sectors for poverty reduction. Having \nbeen  neglected  in  past  investments,  small  towns  with  populations \nranging  from  2,000  to  20,000  remain  underdeveloped\u2014overall  piped \nwater supply service coverage is only about 17% compared with 69% \nin Vientiane and the four largest secondary towns. More than 50% of \nhouseholds do not have any form of water-sealed toilets and less than \n10% of primary schools have latrines. Roads have mainly gravel or dirt \npavements,  with  low  coverage  of  roadside  drains.  Residents  in  small \ntowns  spend  considerable  time,  energy,  and  financial  resources \nacquiring  their  daily  water  needs.  Low  coverage  of  safe  piped  water \n\n \nRationale \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nsupplies, poor environment conditions, and low hygiene awareness in \nsmall  towns  have  resulted  in  a  high  incidence  of  diarrhea  diseases, \nmalaria,  and  high  morbidity.  Such  unfavorable  conditions  also \nconstrain the small towns\u2019 economic development and limit their ability \nto serve the surrounding rural hinterlands. The Project will support the \nwater supply and associated urban improvement in small towns, which \nare  the  Government\u2019s  highest  priorities  in  small  town  development. \nMost project towns will be in the poor Northern Region, the geographic \nfocus  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  operations.  The \nremainder  will  be  in  the  Central  Region.  The  Project  includes \nsignificant  community  participation,  poverty  reduction,  health  and \nhygiene promotion activities to strengthen the local sense of ownership \nand  maximize  the  intended  health  benefits  and  poverty  reduction \nimpacts. \n \nThe  specific  objectives  of \nthe \naccessibility,  quality,  reliability,  and  sustainability  of  water  supply \nservices in about 12 small towns in Northern and Central Regions; and \n(ii)  improve  environmental  conditions  in  these  small  towns.  The \nobjectives  will  be  achieved  by  (i)  constructing  new  optimal-size  water \n(ii) \nsupply \nrehabilitating/improving  selected  urban \ni.e.  sanitation, \ndrainage, roads, and bridges; (iii) enhancing public hygiene awareness \nand  motivating  public  participation  in  village  improvement  initiatives; \nand  (iv)  strengthening  sector  planning,  managing,  and  regulating \ncapacity. \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s policy statement for the urban water supply sector and \nhas taken into account the absorptive capacity of sector institutions.  \n \nThe  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $24.9  million  equivalent,  of  which \n$15.4 million equivalent (61.8%) is the foreign currency cost and $9.5 \nmillion equivalent (38.2%) is the local currency cost. \n \n\nIt  has  been  designed  within \n\nthe  Project  are \n\nframework  of \n\ntechnologies; \n\nappropriate \n\nfacilities, \n\nsystems \n\nimprove \n\nto  (i) \n\nusing \n\nthe \n\nSource \n\n \nADB \nOPEC Funda\nNORADa\nGovernment \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nTotal \n\n($ million) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n6.5 \n7.0 \n1.3 \n0.6 \n0.0 \n\n \n\n15.4 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n3.5 \n2.0 \n0.4 \n3.5 \n0.1 \n \n9.5 \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n10.0 \n9.0 \n1.7 \n4.1 \n0.1 \n \n24.9 \n\n% \n\n \n40.1 \n36.1 \n6.8 \n16.5 \n0.5 \n \n100.0 \n\nGrant  Amount  and \nTerms \n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  NORAD  =  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development \nCooperation, OPEC = Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. \na     to be administered by ADB. \nA grant of $10.0 million is proposed to be provided from ADB\u2019s Asian \nDevelopment Fund.  \n \nThe  ADB  grant  will  be  passed  on  to  the  provincial  governments  for \nconstruction  of  water  supply  systems,  roads,  drains,  and  sanitation \nimprovement;  participation  in  awareness  and  community  actions;  and \n\n\fproject  implementation  assistance  and  capacity  building.

MCTPC  has \nextensive  experience  in  implementing  projects  funded  by  external \nagencies. A national project steering committee (PSC), chaired by the \nvice  minister  of  MCTPC,  will  be  established  to  provide  overall  project \ndirection and guidance. A project coordination unit (PCU) will be set up \nwithin \nfor \ncoordinating and managing of all project activities. A provincial project \nsteering committee (PPSC) will be established in each project province \nto  provide  project  direction  and  guidance  for  the  subproject  in  each \nprovince  and  coordinate  provincial  and  district  agencies.  A  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  set  up  in  each  province  and  will  be \nresponsible for daily subproject implementation in that province. \n \nGoods,  works,  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major  supply  and  civil \nworks  contracts  will  be  carried  out  under  international  competitive \nbidding (ICB). For civil works contracts valued at less than $1.0 million, \nlocal competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to ADB will be \nadopted. For supply contracts costing less than $500,000, international \nshopping  (IS)  procedures  will  be  followed.  Direct  purchase  (DP) \nprocedures will be used for equipment items that are locally available \nand  cost  less  than  $100,000.  The  PCU  will  carry  out  all  procurement \nexcept those for the village environment improvement subcomponent, \nwhich will be undertaken by the respective PIU. \n \nAbout 94 person-months of international and about 731 person-months \nof  domestic  consulting services  will  be  required  to  assist  in  (i)  project \npreparation  services, \nfeasibility  studies, \nresettlement  and  ethnic  groups  development  plans,  and  detailed \nengineering  designs; \nincluding \nimplementation of resettlement and ethnic groups development plans; \n(iii)  social  and  environmental  impact  administration;  (iv)  technical  and \nmanagement support and capacity building for PCU, PIUs, district offices \nof  communication,  transport,  post  and  construction  (OCTPCs),  and \nvillage  water  and  sanitation  units  (WATSANs);  (v)  developing  and \nimplementing  community  awareness  and  participation  programs;  and \n\nincluding  preparation  of \n\nconstruction \n\nsupervision, \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\niii\n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n(v) surveying and clearing unexploded ordnance (UXO). An additional \n50  person-months  of  international  and  82  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services will be required for institutional strengthening of the \nWater  Supply  Authority  (WASA)  and  Water  Supply  Division  of  the \ndepartment  of  Housing  and  Urban  Planning  (DHUP).  Consultants \nfunded  by  ADB  grant  and/or  loans  administered  by  ADB  will  be \nselected and engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants. \n \nThe Project is expected to benefit residents (about 89,000 in 2010 and \n100,000  in  2015)  of  about  12  small  towns  by  providing  safe  and \nreliable piped water supplies and an improved urban environment that \nwill have a direct impact on the health and living conditions of the town \ncommunities.  The  health  benefits  will  come  from  (i)  a  safe  and \nconvenient  water  supply;  (ii) \nimproved  environmental  sanitation \nthrough  drainage  and  related  works;  (iii)  increased  use  of  domestic \nsanitation facilities due to increased awareness, appropriate sanitation \nmodels,  and  improved  water  supply;  (iv)  increased  knowledge  and \nawareness  of  health  and  hygiene  issues;  and  (v)  avoidance  of \ndrudgery associated with collecting water. The health benefits from the \nphysical  investment  of  the  Project  will  be  enhanced  by  the  hygiene \nawareness  and  promotion  activities.  About  100  core  villages  will \nbenefit  directly  from  village  environment  improvements:  provision  of \naccess  roads,  footpaths,  and  improved  drainage  and  sanitation  in \nresidential areas. Moreover, an estimated 98,000 rural residents in the \nsurrounding  hinterland  will  benefit  from  improved  roads  and  bridges \nallowing  better  access  to  urban  markets  and  social  services  provided \nin the project towns. The towns\u2019 economies will benefit from enhanced \nproductivity  as  a  result  of  health  improvement,  timesavings  in \ncollecting  water,  as  well  as  from  increased  urban  efficiency  arising \nfrom  improved  roads,  bridges,  drainage,  and  sanitation.  Residents  in \ntowns  will  also  benefit  from  lower  water  costs  and  from  savings  in \nhealth care costs. \n \nThe  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  (i)  lack  of  progress  in \npolicy  and  institutional  reforms,  particularly  moving  WASA  toward \nbeing  a  capable  sector  regulator;  (ii)  limited  human  resources  and \ninstitutional  capacities  at  provincial  and  district  levels;  (iii)  uncertainty \nregarding  tariff  increases  necessary  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the \nwater supply service; (iv) insufficient community participation in project \nimplementation,  particularly  from  women  and  the  poor;  (v)  poor  and \nvulnerable  households  negatively  affected  by  resettlement;  (vi) \ninadequate resources available for counterpart funding; (vii) insistence \nby provincial governments on overly conservative water supply design \ninvestment;  (viii) \nparameters,  resulting \ninadequate  time  and  resources  for  raw  water  assessment;  and  (ix) \ninadequate  sources \nfor  operations  and  maintenance  of  project \nfacilities. \n\ninefficient  or  wasted \n\nin \n\n\fv\n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \ngrant  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the  Northern  and  Central  Regions  Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector Project (the Project); and (ii) proposed administration by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) of a proposed loan from the OPEC Fund for International Development \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Project.1\n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nThe Lao PDR has one of the smallest populations (total of about 5.7 million in 2003) and \nlowest  population  densities  (25  persons/square  kilometer)  in  Southeast  Asia.  However,  its \npopulation growth rate of 2.5% is among the highest in the region, and the population is projected \nto  reach  8.2  million  by  2020.  About  80%  (4.5  million)  of  the  people  live  in  nearly  12,000  small \nrural  villages  scattered  throughout  the  country.  The  remaining  20%  (1.2  million)  are  urban \nresidents who live in 145 officially designated urban centers in 142 districts. While the Lao PDR \nremains essentially a rural country, urban centers are playing an increasingly important role in the \ncountry\u2019s economy, evidenced by (i) the quick growth in the industry sector in the past decade; \nand  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s  socioeconomic  development  strategies  increasingly  emphasizing  the \ndevelopment of urban centers, particularly small towns.2   \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nSocioeconomic and Poverty Indicators. Although it has had consistent improvement in \nmost socioeconomic indicators over the past few years, the Lao PDR remains one of the world\u2019s \nleast-developed countries. It ranked 135th among 177 countries in the 2004 Human Development \nReport  of  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP).  The  country\u2019s  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 6.4% during 1993\u20132003. The GDP per capita in \n2003 was about $350. While agriculture still accounts for about half of the GDP, the industry has \nbeen growing fastest in the past decade at an average annual rate of about 10.5%, followed by \nservices  at  6.7%,  and  agriculture  at  5.0%.  Government  revenue  was  about  11.0%  of  GDP  and \nexpenditure about 18.8% of GDP in 2003. The budget deficit of about 7.8% of GDP was financed \nmostly  by  grants  and  external  concessional  loans.  External  debt  stood  at  around  $3.0  billion  or \nabout 170% of GDP in 2003. Poverty incidence fell from about 45% in 1993 to 32% in 20033 due \nto strong economic growth. However, it fell only marginally in the Northern Region, which has the \nhighest  incidence  of  poverty  at  52%,  because  of  unbalanced  economic  development.  The \nNorthern  Region  has  25  of  the  nation\u2019s  47  poor  districts  officially  identified  as  priorities  for \ndevelopment. The Central Region, with a poverty incidence of 35%, has 16 similar poor districts.4 \nWhile poverty in the country is most evident in the rural areas, the urban poor are also severely \naffected  by  environmental  degradation,  unclean  water,  lack  of  proper  sanitation,  and  lack  of \naccess to essential services.  \n \nWater  Supply  and  Urban  Services.  While  about  69%  of  the  urban  population  in \n4. \nVientiane  and  the  four  secondary  towns  have  piped  water  supply,  overall  coverage  in  the \nremaining  140  small  towns  is  only  about  17%  as  they  had  been  largely  neglected  during  past \ndevelopment efforts. There are still 49 small towns in the Northern Region without a piped water \nsupply system, 43 in the Central Region, and 23 in the Southern Region.5 Many people in small \n\n                                                 \n1   A  small-scale  (less  than  10%  of  the  project  costs)  urban  component  is  included  in  the  Project  to  complement  the \nwater supply intervention of the Project. It includes sanitation, drainage, and, in somes cases, roads and bridges. \n\n2   Urban centers with populations of 2,000 - 20,000 people are considered small towns.  \n3   ADB. 2004.

Vientiane. \n5   Water Supply Authority. 2003. Urban Water Supply Map. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\ntaken \n\ntowns  rely  on  shallow  wells,  ponds,  and  streams,  which  are  unreliable  and  often  biologically \ncontaminated. More than 50% of households in small towns do not have any form of water-sealed \ntoilets, while less than 10% of primary schools have latrines. Markets often do not have any toilet \nfacilities. Roads in small urban centers have mainly gravel or dirt pavements, with low (typically \nless  than  25%6)  coverage  of  roadside  drains.  Low  coverage  of  safe  piped  water  supplies,  poor \nsanitation conditions, and low hygiene awareness in small towns has resulted in a high incidence \nof  diarrheal  diseases,  malaria,  and  morbidity.  In  small  towns,  women  and  children  spend  an \naverage  of  about  1\u20132  hours  each  day  fetching  water  from  distant  sources.  Inadequate  water \nsupply and poor environmental conditions in small towns also deter socioeconomic development \nand limit their ability to serve the surrounding rural hinterlands. \n \n5. \nSector  Institutions.  Since  1995,  the  Government  has  introduced  a  series  of  reforms \naiming  to  decentralize  responsibility  for  urban  and  rural  infrastructure  and  services  to  the \nincreasing \nprovincial  governments.  Accordingly,  each  provincial  government  has \nresponsibility  for  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  which  are  managed  on  its  behalf  by  the \nprovincial  Department  of  Communications,  Transport,  Posts,  and  Construction  (DCTPC)  and  its \ndistrict  offices  (OCTPC).  In  1999,  Government  Decision  37/PM 7   on  Management  and \nDevelopment of the Water Supply and Wastewater Sector (the Policy Statement) established an \ninstitutional  framework  and  long-term  vision  for  the  sector.  The  main  operational  impacts  of \nDecision 37/PM were to devolve responsibility for urban water supply and sanitation (WSS) from \nthe  central  to  the  provincial  government,  and  to  create  a  new  organization,  the  Water  Supply \nAuthority  (WASA),  under  the  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Posts  and  Construction \n(MCTPC).  The  Nam  Papa  Lao  (NPL  or  Lao  Water  Supply  Company),  which  was  previously \nresponsible  for  water  supply  for  the  whole  country,  was  then  broken  into  Nam  Papa  Vientiane \n(NPV or Vientiane Water Supply Company, in charge of water supply in Vientiane) and provincial \nnam  papas  (PNPs,  provincial  water  supply  companies  looking  after  the  water  supply  service  in \neach province). From late 1999, each PNP became an autonomous state-owned enterprise under \nDCTPC. While WASA  was established to assist the MCTPC  minister on technical issues in the \nwater  supply  sector  and  to  manage/monitor  the  implementation  of  water  supply  sector  policies, \nthe  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  is  to  gradually  develop  WASA  as  an  effective  and  capable \nsector  regulator.  Decision  37/PM  also  provided  for  the  formation  of  a  regulatory  committee  to \noversee  and  direct  WASA\u2019s  operations,  and  the  committee  is  now  being  established.  A  water \nsupply sector analysis is summarized in Appendix 1. \n \n6. \nGovernment  Policies.  The  Government\u2019s  policies  attach  increasing  emphasis  on \nachieving  equitable  development  by  making  small  towns  as  markets  and  agro-processing  and \nsocial service centers for the rural hinterlands and as economic links between rural, national, and \ninternational  markets.  The  Government\u2019s  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy \n(NGPES, 2004) aims to reduce poverty through strong economic growth and increased emphasis \non  the  poorest  districts.  It  focuses  on  health,  including  WSS,  as  one  of  four  priority  sectors  for \npoverty  reduction.  The  Fifth  Five-Year  Socioeconomic  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  prioritizes  the \ndevelopment  of  basic  infrastructure  and  services  in  urban  areas  throughout  the  country  to \naccelerate broad-based economic growth. The poverty reduction partnership agreement, signed \nin September 2001 by ADB and the Government, includes small towns\u2019 development as one of \nthe key operational priorities to enhance reciprocal linkages between urban and rural areas. The \nGovernment\u2019s Policy Statement for the water supply and wastewater sector remains valid and its \ndevelopment goal for urban water supply, as set in the Policy Statement, is to provide daily 24-\nhour access to safe drinking water for 80% of the urban population by 2020.  \n\n                                                 \n6   Based on inventory survey of roads and drains in three sample subproject towns. \n7   Lao PDR, Prime Ministerial Decision No. 37/PM on Management and Development of Water Supply and Wastewater \n\nSector, 30 September 1999. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n7. \nUrban  Water  Supply  Sector  Investment  Plan.  To  achieve  its  development  goal  for \nurban  water  supply,  the  Government  developed  a  sector  investment  plan  (SIP)  with  ADB\u2019s \nassistance in 1999. The SIP has guided the development of the urban water supply sector in the \npast  5  years,  including  investments  funded  by  ADB  and  other  external  agencies.  With  ADB\u2019s \nassistance,  the  SIP  was  updated  in  2004  to  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  increasing  emphasis  on \nequitable  development  by  improving  small  towns,  particularly  those  in  the  poorest  districts.  The \nupdated  SIP  (Appendix  2)  estimates  future  investment  needs  at  about  $267  million,  including \n$103  million  for  small  towns.  The  updated  SIP  represents  a  balanced,  stepwise  approach  to \nwater  supply  development  in  the  country.  It  is  considered  realistic  and  achievable  based  on \nexperience  and  the  Government\u2019s  performance  in  implementing  projects  over  the  past  decade. \nInvestments  under  the  updated  SIP  are  prioritized  on  the  basis  of  a  series  of  factors,  including \npopulation;  poverty  status;  location  relative  to  a  major  road,  transport  node,  growth  corridor,  or \ninternational border; tourism potential; and provincial government development priority. Out of the \n18 small towns identified as first priority in the updated SIP, 12 are in the Northern Region and 6 \nare in the Central Region.  \n \n8. \nADB\u2019s Strategy. ADB\u2019s country strategy for the Lao PDR is targeted at reducing poverty \nthrough  sustainable  economic  growth,  inclusive  social  development,  and  good  governance. \nOperational  priorities  include  strengthening  rural  and  urban  market  linkages,  sustainable \nenvironmental  management,  human  resource  development,  private  sector  participation  (PSP), \nand  regional  integration.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  the  urban  and  water  supply  sectors  has  been \nconstantly  evolving  from  project-specific  to  sector-wide  interventions,  which  aim  to  (i)  improve \nefficiency,  predictability,  transparency,  and  accountability  in  key  institutions  responsible  for \ndelivering services, and (ii) reduce poverty through equitable access to basic social services. In \nparticular,  ADB\u2019s  past  interventions  in  the  water  supply  sector  have  led  to  (i)  22  water  supply \nsystems  constructed  or  being  constructed;  (ii)  improved  water  supply  system  management  and \noperations by former NPL, NPV, and PNPs; and (iii) improved project implementation capacity of \nproject  management  units  (PMUs)  and  PIUs.  With  support  from  the  ongoing  water  supply  and \nsanitation  sector  project  (WSSSP),8  the  Government  has  developed  and  implemented  a  sector \nregulatory  framework  to  support  the  sector\u2019s  decentralization  process,  and  has  established \nWASA  as  a  sector  regulator.  WASA  has  already  undertaken  some  initial  and  preliminary \nregulating activities. ADB\u2019s current objectives in the sector are to (i) further strengthen the legal \nand \nlocal  resource \nmobilization  and  cost  recovery,  (iii)  enhance  effective  sector  planning  and  regulation,  and  (iv) \npromote PSP in the delivery of urban services. \n \n9. \nOther  Aid  Agencies.  Other  international  agencies  involved  in  Lao  PDR\u2019s  WSS  sector \ninclude  the  World  Bank,  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation  (NORAD),  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD),  Belgian \nTechnical  Cooperation  (BTC),  and  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  Bankengruppe.  Their \noperations  in  the  sector  are  well  coordinated.  The  World  Bank  has  played  a  major  role  in \npromoting public-private water supply development and alternative management models for water \nsupply  systems.  NORAD\u2019s  involvement  has  included  substantial  assistance  for  building  the \ncapacity of WASA, while JICA has provided funds for developing Vientiane\u2019s water supply system \nand ongoing assistance for building the capacity of PNPs throughout the country. AFD supports \ncapacity  building  for  PNPs  as  well  as  the  construction  of  the  National  Water  Training  Center  in \nVientiane,  which  is  scheduled  for  completion  in September  2005.  BTC  has  provided  assistance \nfor several small town water supply systems and for strengthening Water Supply Division (WSD), \n                                                 \n8   ADB. 1999.

During  project \npreparation, aid agencies have coordinated to ensure consistency in institutional approaches and \na  harmonized  policy  approach  with  the  Government.  Under  its  ongoing  PNP  training  program, \nJICA agreed to provide training to professional and technical staff from the subproject PNPs and \ntheir branch offices in the subproject towns. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n10. \nAlthough the Government has introduced a number of policies and reforms since 1999 to \nimprove  the  sustainability  of  the  WSS  sector,  such  changes  have  not  been  translated  into \npractice in a coherent way. The key problems that need to be addressed in the short to medium \nterm are as follows:  \n \nUnbalanced and Inadequate Investment. Despite considerable investments in the urban \n11. \nwater  sector  in  the  past,  overall  piped  water  supply  coverage  in  small  towns  (at  17%)  is  well \nbelow targeted levels. Further investment in water supply and associated urban infrastructure in \nthe  remaining  97  underserved  small  towns  is  urgently  needed  to  address  unsatisfactory  health \nprofiles  and  deteriorating  environmental  conditions.  The  proposed  Project  will  provide  safe, \nreliable  piped  water  supply  and  complementary  small-scale  improvements  in  drainage  and \nsanitation and, in some cases, roads and bridges for about 12 priority small towns in the SIP. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is Appendix 3. \n \n12. \nHigh Capital Investment Costs. Initial per capita investment costs in water supply in the \nLao  PDR  have  been  5\u201310  times  greater  than  in  neighboring  countries  because  of  (i)  low \npopulation density; (ii) high cost of construction in remote areas; (iii) inappropriate service levels; \n(iv)  need  to  import  most  equipment  and  materials;  and  (v)  Government\u2019s  high  and  opaque \nsubsidies, which have acted as disincentives to adopting least cost solutions for the water supply \nsystems.  High  investment  cost  has  become  a  constraint  in  achieving  the  Government\u2019s  sector \ndevelopment  goal.  Strategies  for  cost  containment,  such  as  appropriate  technology  and  design \ncriteria, tariff reforms, and proper cost recovery levels are  needed to encourage PNPs to adopt \nleast-cost solutions for their water supply systems. \n \n13. \nUnsustainable Tariffs.  Following decentralization, PNPs were expected to be financially \nself-supporting,  and  responsibility  for  tariff  setting  was  delegated  to  the  respective  provincial \ngovernments.  In  practice,  tariffs  set  on  a  province-wide  basis  are  insufficient  to  cover  operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  costs,  let  alone  debt  service  or  depreciation.  As  a  result,  most  PNPs \noperate  at  a  loss  and  require  subsidies  from  provincial  governments.  In  most  provinces,  debt \nrecovery  has  proven  to  be  difficult.  While  the  water  bill  collection  efficiency  from  households  is \ngenerally  good,  many  government  agencies  fail  to  pay  their  water  bills.  The  province-wide  tariff \nstructure, together with government relending arrangements to provinces (currently only 15% of \ncapital cost is passed on as loan), has acted as disincentives to adopting least-cost solutions to \nthe water supply systems. These factors combine to result in unsustainable, deteriorating water \nsupply systems and ultimately lead to poor customer service. To overcome these impediments to \nfinancial sustainability, the Government has issued a National Water Supply Tariff Policy. WASA \nis  now  assisting  PNPs  to  establish  tariffs  at  levels  sufficient  for  sustainable  operation,  and  to \nadopt appropriate water supply service levels. Under the proposed Project, the Government has \nagreed to adopt the following tariff reforms for each subproject town: (i) subproject-specific tariffs; \n(ii) a progressive tariff structure with three consumption blocks (lifeline, average, above average); \nand  (iii)  tariffs  in  each  town  to  be  set  at  levels designed  to  recover  full  O&M  costs  plus  30%  of \ncapital investment costs. \n \n14.  Weak Regulatory Capacity. With assistance from ADB and NORAD, WASA has gone a \nlong  way  since  its  establishment  in  1999  as  the  proposed  sector  regulator.  It  has  already \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nprepared a number of key financial, technical, and accounting guidelines; facilitated private sector \nwater supply initiatives; and published annual reports, which evaluated the technical and financial \nperformance of all PNPs in the country. However, WASA\u2019s regulatory capacity remains weak due \nmainly to (i) lack of a solid legal foundation for sector regulation, (ii) limited and unstable human \nresources,  and  (iii)  unclear  division  of  responsibilities  in  relation  to  the  Department  of  Housing \nand  Urban  Planning  (DHUP)/MCTPC,  which  assigns  many  policy  making,  sector  planning,  and \nproject  implementation  responsibilities  to  WASA,  diverting  it  from  its  regulating  focus  and \nconflicting  with  its  regulating  functions.  The  Government  has  begun  the  steps  necessary  to \nestablish  WASA  as  a  dedicated  regulatory  authority.  A  Prime  Minister  Decree  \u2500  Regulation  of \nUrban  Water  Supply  Operations\u2500  which  sets  the  legal  foundation  and  clearly  specifies  the \nresponsibilities,  staffing,  and  funding  arrangements  of  WASA  \u2500  is  expected  to  be  approved  in \n2005. Following approval of the decree, the Project will support WASA in recruiting and training \nqualified staff, developing its work program and assisting its implementation, and identifying the \nregular  internal  funding  resource  for  its  operations,  with  a  view  to  transforming  WASA  into  an \neffective and capable sector regulator in the future. \n \n15.  Weak  Institutional  Capacity  for  Sector  Planning  and  Policy  Development.  Under \nDecision  37/PM,  DHUP  is  responsible,  through  WSD,  for  setting  sector  development  strategies \nand  plans,  planning  staff  training,  and  studying  technical  standards  of  water  supply  systems. \nWSD is also tasked with managing an ambitious long-term program of capital investment in the \nurban water supply sector. To date, it has received little external assistance, except in the area of \nproject management. As a result, WSD has limited capacity to undertake its core functions, with \nfew  staff  and  resources.  In  addition,  overlapping  responsibilities  with  those  of  WASA  cause \nconfusion.  These  limitations  pose  a  major  constraint  to  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  water \nsector. To address these issues, the Project will support redefining DHUP\u2019s responsibilities and \nwill provide institutional strengthening to assist WSD in recruiting and training staff, and preparing \nvarious key policy and strategy documents as well as technical and management guidelines.  \n \n16. \nInadequate  Sanitation  Coverage,  Low  Sanitation  Awareness,  Weak  Sanitation \nRegulations and Poor Management of On-Site Sanitation. In small towns, only about 42% of \nhouseholds have pour-flush toilets; communities have low awareness of the links between water, \nsanitation,  hygiene,  and  health;  and  provincial  sanitation  regulations  are  weak,  with  poorly \ndefined  institutional  responsibilities.  The  Project  will  address  these  issues  by  (i)  increasing  the \ncoverage of public and poor household sanitation systems by providing funds for construction of \nnew  sanitation  facilities;  (ii)  improving  the  drainage  networks;  (iii)  implementing  the  community \nhealth  and  sanitation  awareness  program  in  the  project  towns;  (iv)  requiring  provincial \ngovernments  to  introduce  modified  sanitation  regulations  with  clearly  defined  institutional \nresponsibilities  (to  be  submitted  with  the  subproject  appraisal  report)  as  a  precondition  to \nreceiving ADB funding for the subproject; and (v) strengthening the capacity of local agencies and \nhouseholds  to  manage,  operate,  and  maintain  on-site  sanitation  facilities,  by  providing  training \nand  O&M  equipment.  All  households,  businesses  and  institutions  will  be  required  to  have \nOCTPC-approved  sanitation  systems  before  they  are  permitted  to  connect  to  the  PNP  piped \nwater supply system.  \n \n17. \nLessons Learned. The project design draws on the experience and lessons learned from \nprevious ADB and other agencies\u2019 projects in the Lao PDR, particularly the ongoing WSSSP, the \nSmall  Towns  Development  Project,  and  the  Northern  Provincial  Towns  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Project. The primary lessons learned are: (i) human and institutional capacity is weak, \nespecially  at  the  provincial  and  district  levels;  (ii)  appropriate  technology  and  minimum \nmechanical  content  are  necessary  to  improve  system  sustainability  and  to  reduce  excessive \ncapital  costs;  (iii)  adequate  time  and  resources  should  be  devoted  to  raw  water  assessment \n(especially  spring  sources  and  groundwater)  to  minimize  water  treatment  costs  and  the  risk  of \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nwater  shortages;  (iv)  PNP  management,  financial,  technical,  planning,  and  community  relations \nskills  remain  weak;  and  (v)  water  supply  projects  should  include  (a)  appropriate  drainage  and \nsanitation  measures;  (b)  an  appropriate  community  participation,  consultation  and  health \nawareness  component,  including  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  chlorination;  and  (c)  training  and \nwater system-specific sets of operating manuals in the local language. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n18. \nThe project goal is to improve the quality of life of residents of small towns in the Lao PDR \nand  enhance  the  small  towns\u2019  roles  as  market,  services,  and  manufacturing  centers  supporting \nthe  rural  hinterlands.  The  specific  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  improve  the  accessibility, \nquality, reliability, and sustainability of water supply services in about 12 small towns in Northern \nand Central Regions; and (ii) improve environmental conditions in those small towns.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n19. \nThe  Project,  which  incorporates  lessons  learned  from  earlier  assistance  in  the  sector,  is \nformulated as a sector project. While the focus of the Project is water supply, some small urban \ninfrastructure  directly  associated  with  water  supply  system  construction  and  subsequently \noperation,  i.e.  sanitation,  drainage,  roads,  and  bridges,  will also  be  included  to  complement  the \nwater supply interventions of the Project. The sector lending mode is considered appropriate as \n(i)  the  Government\u2019s  water  sector  policy  statement  remains  valid  and  relevant;  (ii)  an  updated \nsector investment plan is in place, outlining sector investment requirements up to the year 2020; \nand (iii) MCTPC, the Executing Agency, has adequate capacity to implement the Project, and the \nProject will build the capacity of local authorities as implementing agencies. The Project will cover \nabout 12 small towns representing top investment priorities in the SIP and the project design is \nfounded  on  detailed  analyses  of  three  sample  subprojects.9  Criteria  and  procedures  for  town \nparticipation in the Project and for subproject appraisal are described in Appendix 4. \n \n20. \n \n\nThe Project comprises five components: \n\n1. \n\nStrengthening Water Supply Sector Regulation and Management \n\n \n21. \nThe component aims to strengthen overall sector regulatory, planning, and management \ncapacity. It comprises institutional strengthening of WASA and of DHUP\u2019s WSD. It will strengthen \nWASA\u2019s role as sector regulator by enhancing the legal foundation for sector regulation, building \nWASA\u2019s  capacity  to  undertake  its  core  regulating  and  monitoring  functions,  providing  needed \nassistance  in  conducting  its  key  operations,  and  establishing  a  regular  financial  source  for \nfinancing  its  activities.  It  will  also  assist  WSD  to  prepare  key  strategy  documents  and  technical \nand  management  guidelines,  and  build  its  capacity  to  undertake  its  assigned  role  in  overall \nplanning and management of the sector. The component will help DHUP and WASA review and \nsummarize existing PSP initiatives in the water supply sector,10 and develop policies, regulations, \nand sample documents needed to facilitate PSP in the sector. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9   They are Muong Houn with a population of 6,800, Muong Nan with 10,000, and Kenethao with 5,800. \n10  A  WASA  study  in  2004  shows  that,  in  2002,  there  were  at  least  4  private  piped-water  suppliers,  348  private \nconstruction  companies,  358  private  drinking  water  and  ice  factories,  and  231  private  shops  selling  water  and \nsanitation equipment/materials in Vientiane prefecture and 11 provinces covered by the study. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\nWater Supply Development \n\n2. \n \n22. \nThe component aims to develop safe, affordable, reliable piped water supply systems for \nabout 100,000 residents in the core villages11 of about 12 project towns in 2015. It will include the \ndevelopment of (i) surface, spring, or groundwater sources; (ii) raw water transmission pipelines; \n(iii) water treatment facilities; (iv) distribution networks; (v) treated water reservoirs; (vi) individual \nmetered service connections; and (vii) an office/workshop/store for each PNP branch. Equipment \nfor O&M of the water supply systems will be procured under the component. It will also explore \nand possibly pilot appropriate PNP-private sector cooperation models in small towns by seeking \nPSP in providing water supply services in towns where such a potential exists.12\n \n\n3. \n\nUrban Environment Improvement \n\n \n23. \nThe component will rehabilitate and improve small urban infrastructure directly associated \nwith construction and operation of the water supply system, including public sanitation facilities, \ndrainage, roads, and bridges.13 It will procure equipment for O&M of the rehabilitated or improved \nurban facilities. Investment in urban facilities under the component will be prioritized and limited to \na specific monetary amount decided by the town\u2019s population and a unified per capita allocation \nto  ensure  that  the  investment  is  efficient,  and  project  benefits  are  spread  equitably  among  the \nproject towns. \n \n\nParticipation, Awareness, and Community Actions (PACA) \n\n4. \n \n24. \nThe  component  will  have  two  sub-components:  (i)  a  community  health  and  awareness \nprogram  (CHAP),  and  (ii)  village  environmental  improvements  (VEI).  Its  design  is  based  on  the \nProject\u2019s  poverty  and  social  assessment,  in  response  to  the  needs  expressed  by  different \nstakeholders during project preparation. \n \n25. \nThe  CHAP  aims  to  improve  community  awareness  of  health,  hygiene,  and  sanitation; \ninform  communities  of  the  project  activities;  motivate  households  to  connect  to  the  piped  water \nsupply system and improve their toilet facilities; and help communities plan, design, operate, and \nmaintain  local  urban  services  in  partnership  with  local  agencies.  CHAP  will  consist  of  (i)  a \nprogram  of  community  participation,  which  will  be  developed  and  implemented  in  consultation \nwith  village  communities;  and  (ii)  a  program  of  community  education,  health  and  sanitation \nawareness, training, village meetings, media events, and public relations. This subcomponent will \nbuild on past and ongoing information, education, and communication (IEC) initiatives to minimize \nduplication  of  efforts  and  materials.  In  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Health,  this  sub-\ncomponent will also provide a link or referral to ongoing health campaigns on HIV/AIDS.14\n \n26. \nVEI  will  provide  funds  and  technical  assistance  for  small-scale  improvements  in  core  village \nresidential  areas.  It  will  include  (i)  community  environmental  improvements  and  (ii)  sanitation \nimprovement  for  poor  households.  Community  environmental  improvements  will  include  works \nsuch  as  small  village  access  roads,  footpaths,  paved  public  areas,  tertiary  drains,  drainage \ncovers, and improved sanitation in community facilities such as meeting halls. The communities \n\n                                                 \n11  In the Lao PDR, the small towns consist of a number of villages. An urban village refers to a village that is associated \nwith  a  town  and  a  rural  village  is  not  affiliated  with  any  town.  In  this  report  \u201dvillage\u201d  refers  to  the  urban  village  and \n\u201drural village\u201d refers to the village in the rural areas. \n\n12  Among  other  towns,  the  Project  will  explore  PNP-private  sector  cooperation  in  providing  water  supply  services  in \n\nMuong Houn, where initial assessment reveals a potential for PSP. \n\n13  These  are  closely  linked  to  water  supply  development,  as  construction  of  the  water  supply  pipeline  will  primarily \nfollow  road  and  bridge  alignments,  and  improved  sanitation  and  drainage  are  required  to  handle  the  additional \nquantities of wastewater generated by the improved water supply systems. \n\n14  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nwill  select,  plan,  design,  and  implement  improvements  as  well  as  operate  and  maintain  the \nfacilities.  Proposals  will  include  an  O&M  plan  for  the  proposed  VEI,  including  the  estimated \nnumber and type of jobs newly created. Sanitation improvements for poor households will assist \npoor families in the core villages to construct or upgrade their toilets and sanitation facilities with \nfunds  passed  as  a  grant  to  each  poor  household,  subject  to  satisfactory  completion  of  the \nsanitation facilities.15 Water and sanitation units (WATSANs) at the village level will help identify \npoor  households  eligible  for  sanitation  improvement,  and  will  make  recommendations  to  the \ncommunity  action team (CAT) in the PIU for approval. WATSANs will also coordinate with CAT \nfor  technical  guidance  on  design  and  construction  of  toilets,  septic  tanks,  and  drainage \nconnection.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Implementation Assistance and Capacity Building \n\n \nThe  component  has  three  subcomponents.  The  project  implementation  assistance  (PIA) \n27. \nsubcomponent will provide consulting services to assist the project coordination unit (PCU) and \neach  PIU  to  implement  the  Project.  The  capacity  building  program  (CBP)  will  help  to  develop \nmore efficient institutions in the towns to manage urban services in a sustainable manner. It will \nalso  provide  support  in  the  form  of  consultants  and  training  to  CATs  in  the  PIUs,  and  to \nWATSANs  to  enhance  their  capacities  to  implement  the  PACA  component,  and  to  operate  and \nmaintain  urban  infrastructure.  Resettlement  training  workshops  for  district  officials  will  also  be \nconducted.  Incremental  administration  support  will  provide  allowances,  vehicles,  office,  and \ncomputer equipment for the PCU and PIUs to implement the Project.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nPhased  Approach.  Recognizing  that  developing  the  water  supply  sector  in  the  Lao \n28. \ncontext is a long-term task, ADB has adopted a long-term, phased approach for its assistance in \nthe sector. The Project was formulated as the next phase of support to the sector, and the first in \na  continuing  series  of  support  planned  for  the  sector  in  the  future.  The  phased  approach  has \ndemonstrated ADB\u2019s commitment to the sector, improved the leverage effects of ADB\u2019s support, \nand encouraged the Government to carefully prioritize its development needs.  \n \n29. \nInstitutional  Strengthening.  The  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  to \nreform  the  water  supply  sector  by  providing  assistance  for  institutional  strengthening  of  WASA \nand  WSD.  The  development  of  WASA  into  an  effective,  capable  regulator  and  building  the \ncapacity of WSD in sector planning and management are seen as essential and urgent steps to \nimprove sector sustainability, particularly for encouraging PSP in the sector and helping to make \nPNPs self-sufficient. Support to WASA will build on the measurable progress achieved under the \nWSSSP and other external assistance over the past 6 years. Details of external assistance are in \nAppendix 5.  \n \n30. \nTariff Reform. Current unnecessarily high subsidies for capital investments and province-\nwide  flat  tariff  provide  little  incentive  for  investment  cost  control  and  water  conservation,  and \ncause  consumer  resistance  and  affordability  obstacles  to  tariff  increases.  As  a  result,  the  least-\ncost  solution  for  the  water  supply  system  is  usually  not  preferred,  wasteful  water  use  is \nwidespread, and water tariffs are set at unsustainable low levels. The Project will pursue a higher \nlevel of cost recovery (para. 13), with adoption of subproject-specific, progressive tariffs with three \nblocks  in  each  subproject  town.  The  lifeline  block  and  a  deferred  payment  system  for  the \nconnection charge, which allows poor households to pay the connection charge over a 24-month \nperiod free of interest charge, will substantially increase the poor\u2019s access to the project benefits. \n                                                 \n15  Poor  households  that  elect  to  connect  to  piped  water  will  receive  a  grant  of  $75  per  household  to  enable  them  to \nconstruct  a  proper  toilet  with  a  septic  tank,  while  poor  families  that  decide  not  to  connect  will  likewise  receive  a \nsmaller grant to enable them to improve their toilet facilities.  \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nThe proposed tariff structure will reflect more directly and closely the investment costs, promote \nwater conservation, and therefore help contain the capital cost and improve sector sustainability. \n \n31. \nCapital  Cost  Containment.  The  Project  emphasizes  minimizing  per  capita  investment \ncosts  for  the  water  supply  systems,  which  in  the  Lao  PDR,  have  been  generally  5\u201310  times \nhigher  than  those  for  comparable  works  in  neighboring  countries.  To  contain  capital  costs,  the \nProject  will  adopt  appropriate  technology,  design  criteria,  and  service  levels.  It  will  also  provide \nwater  supply  services  only  to  the  more  densely  populated  core  villages  to  ensure  that  the \ninvestment  is  efficient.  The  use  of  subproject-specific  progressive  tariffs  and  increased  cost \nrecovery  levels  will  provide  greater  incentive  for  PNPs  to  adopt  least-cost  solutions  and  for \nconsumers to save water.  \n \n32. \nAssessment  of  Raw  Water  Source.  Stream flow records in the Lao PDR are available \nfor  the  major  rivers  only,  and  generally,  no  data  is  available  for  local  streams  and  springs  that \ncould be the least-cost sources for many small towns. Yield assessments of surface sources for \nprevious  projects  have  often  relied  on  local  knowledge  of  district  agencies  and  spot \nmeasurements of stream flow at the time of field inspections. This has often resulted in a high risk \nof  water  shortages  after  scheme  commissioning  or,  alternatively  has  required  designers  to \nchoose  more  conservative  and  expensive  schemes  on  larger  streams  with  assured  flows.  To \nminimize  the  risk  of  water  shortages  and  ensure  the  development  of  least-cost  sources, \nresources  have  been  allocated  from  the  Project  Preparatory  TA  for  continued  flow  and  water \nquality measurements during the 2005 dry and wet seasons for the five candidate subprojects to \nbe  implemented  under  phase  1  (para.  39).  In  addition,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  make \nPNPs  throughout  the  country  undertake  regular  dry-  and  wet-season  flow  and  quality \nmeasurements for potential sources of small town water supply systems, and relevant training will \nbe  provided  under  the  Project.  The  participation  of  PNPs  in  this  exercise  will  be  taken  into \naccount in future subproject selection criteria for ADB-financed water supply projects. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n33. \nThe Project cost is estimated at $24.9 million equivalent, of which $15.4 million or 61.8% \nof  total  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $9.5  million  equivalent  or  38.2%  is  the  local  currency \ncost, including taxes and duties of about $2.2 million equivalent.

The ADF grant will be denominated in \nUS  dollars.  ADF  grant  financing  for  the  Project  is  justified  on  the  basis  of  (i)  the  sector\u2019s  huge \ninvestment  demand  versus  the  Government\u2019s  very  difficult  fiscal  situation,  (ii)  water  supply  and \nsanitation as basic human needs, (iii) the contribution of the Project to achieving the millennium \ndevelopment  goals,  (iv)  the  potential  for  significant  poverty  impacts  of  the  Project,  and  (v)  the \nGovernment\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  developing  the  sector.  The  rationale  and  justifications  for \nADB\u2019s grant financing are presented in Appendix 7. \n \nThe OPEC Fund has been requested to provide a loan of $9.0 million equivalent16 (36.1% \n35. \nof  total  project  cost)  to  cofinance  components  2  and  3  on  a  joint  basis  with  the  ADB  grant. \nNORAD has been requested to provide a grant of $1.7 million equivalent to cofinance component \n1 on a parallel basis.  \n \n36. \nSubject to availability of the above cofinancing, the Government and the beneficiaries will \nfinance  the  remaining  $4.2  million  equivalent  project  cost  (about  17.0%  of  total  cost).  The \nGovernment  will  lend  part  of  the  loan  proceeds  from  the  OPEC  Fund\u2500  equal  to  30%  of  capital \ninvestment costs of its respective water supply system, in local currency\u2500 to each PNP through a \nsubsidiary loan agreement acceptable to ADB.17 The subsidiary loans will have a maturity of 25 \nyears  with  a  grace  period  of  6  years,  and  a  fixed  interest  rate  of  6.4%.  The  Government  will \nassume  the  foreign  exchange  risk.  The  remaining  part  of  the  OPEC  Fund  loan  and  the  entire \nADB  and  NORAD  grants  will  be  passed  on  to MCTPC,  provincial  governments  concerned,  and \nPNPs as grants. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n\nTable 2: Proposed Financing Plana \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOPEC Fundb \nNORADb \nGovernmentc \nBeneficiaries \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange\n\n6.5 \n7.0 \n1.3 \n0.6 \n0.0 \n15.4 \n\nLocal \nCurrency\n3.5 \n2.0 \n0.4 \n3.5 \n0.1 \n9.5 \n\nTotal \n10.0 \n9.0 \n1.7 \n4.1 \n0.1 \n24.9 \n\n% \n40.1 \n36.1 \n6.8 \n16.5 \n0.5 \n100.0 \n\nNORAD = Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. \na  After  the  Staff  Review  Committee  meeting,  the  United  Nations  Human  Settlements \nProgramme (UNHABITAT) indicated its intention to jointly cofinance component 5 of \nthe  Project  with  about  $500,000  equivalent.  In  the  event  that  cofinancing  with \nUNHABITAT  materializes,  the  Project  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  will  be \nadjusted accordingly during implementation. \n\nb.  A firm decision is expected in late June. \nc   The Government has confirmed that the Project is considered a priority for budget \n\nallocation purposes. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16 The OPEC Fund loan will have a maturity of 20 years with a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 1% plus \n\na service charge of 1% per annum. \n\n17  On-lending  amount  is  decided  on  the  basis  of  financial  and  affordability  analyses.  It  is  the  maximum  capital \n\ninvestment the PNP can recover at this stage in the project towns.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n37.  MCTPC will be the Executing Agency and the provincial DCTPCs will be the implementing \nagencies for the Project. A national project steering committee (PSC) chaired by the vice minister, \nMCTPC, has been established. The PSC comprises senior officials from DHUP; WASA; Ministry \nof  Finance  (MOF);  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Public  Administration  and  Civil  Service  Authority; \nCommittee for Planning and Investment; Ministry of Health Science Technology and Environment \nAgency (STEA); Bank of Lao PDR; National Commission for Advancement of Women (NCAW); \nLao  Front  for  National  Reconstruction  (LFNR);  provincial  governments;  and  PCU  director.  The \nPSC  will  meet  as  required,  but  at  least  every  6  months  to  provide  overall  project  direction  and \nguidance,  including  overseeing  project  implementation,  facilitating  cooperation  and  coordination \namong  agencies  concerned;  and  ensure  timely  implementation  of  the  policy  and  institutional \nreform agenda. The existing PMU18 for the WSSSP will be expanded as a consolidated PCU19 for \nWSSSP and the Project to (i) supervise overall project implementation, programming, budgeting, \nand  financial  planning  and  accounting;  (ii)  recruit  the  consultant,  administer  its  contract,  and \nprocure civil works and goods except those for component 4; (iii) confirm the selection of project \ntowns  based  on  the  established  criteria;  (iv)  appraise  subproject  key  documents,20  before  they \nare forwarded to ADB for approval; (v) provide administrative and technical support to PIUs; (vi) \nprepare  consolidated  project  progress  reports  and  the  project  completion  report;  and  (vii) \nto  ADB, \nconsolidate  project  accounting,  auditing,  and  monitoring  reports \nGovernment, and other cofinanciers.  \n \n38. \nA  provincial  project  steering  committee  (PPSC)  will  be  established  in  each  project \nprovince  to  provide  direction  and  guidance  for  the  subproject/subprojects  in  that  province  and \ncoordinate  provincial  and  district  agencies.  The  PPSC  will  be  chaired  by  a  provincial  vice \ngovernor and comprise subproject district governor, senior officials from DCTPC, Department of \nFinance,  Department  of  Health,  PNP,  OCTPC,  and  PIU  manager.  The  PPSC  will  meet  as \nrequired, but at least every 6 months. A PIU will be established in each implementing agency.21 \nEach PIU will be an integrated unit of four main teams: (i) administration, finance, and accounting; \n(ii)  water  supply;  (iii)  urban  development  and  services;  and  (iv)  community  action  teams,  which \nwill  be  responsible  for  implementing  component  4.  The  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nproject implementation at the local level. Their major responsibilities will include (i) participating in \nproject  planning,  feasibility  studies,  design,  and  procurement  activities  for  the  province\u2019s \nsubproject;  (ii)  coordinating  the  activities  of  consultants  and  contractors  in  the  province;  (iii) \noverseeing  construction  activities;  (iv)  coordinating  resettlement  and  assisting  the  resettlement \ncommittee; (v) implementing the gender strategy and the ethnic groups development framework; \n(vi)  supervising  capacity-building  activities  at  local  levels;  (vii)  preparing  the  subproject \naccounting, auditing, and monitoring reports to PCU and PPSC; and (viii) managing component \n4, including procurement under the component. Mass organizations, such as Lao Women\u2019s Union \n(LWU) and the LFNC, will be members of the PIU, and will help implement the Project. PNP will \nprovide the manager and DCTPC will provide the deputy manager of the PIU in each province. \nDetailed implementation arrangements are described in Supplementary Appendix E. \n                                                 \n18   Based  on  previous  experience,  the  PMU  has  satisfactory  project  implementation  and  management  capacity, \n\nfor  reporting \n\nincluding satisfactory financial management arrangements. \n\n19  To establish the consolidated PCU, the existing PMU will be expanded and strengthened by adding at least a new \nPCU director, a project director, a deputy director, a social specialist, and an accountant.  The director for the Project \nshould be familiar with the Project. \n\n20  Including  design  concept  and  criteria  reports,  design  standards  and  specifications,  feasibility  studies,  detailed \n\ndesigns and construction drawings, procurement plans and prequalification and bidding documents. \n\n21  In case the province has two subproject towns, the PIU will set up a field office in each town and deploy appropriate \n\nstaff to each field office. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n39. \nThe Project will be implemented in two overlapping phases over 5 years beginning in early \n2006,  with  completion  by  March  2010.  Phase  1,  consisting  of  five  subprojects,  will  be \nimplemented  from  2006  to  2009;  and  phase  2,  consisting  of  the  remaining  subprojects,  will  be \nimplemented from 2007 to 2010. The implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n40. \nGoods  and  works  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  will  be  used  for \nmajor civil works contracts estimated to cost $1.0 million equivalent or more and supply contracts \nvalued  at  $500,000  equivalent  or  more.  Procurement  of  civil  works  valued  at  less  than  $1.0 \nmillion equivalent will be undertaken through local competitive bidding (LCB) in accordance with \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  International  shopping  procedures  will  be  followed  for  materials \nand equipment packages estimated to cost $100,000 equivalent or more but less than $500,000 \nequivalent.  Equipment  items  that  are  locally  available  and  cost  less  than  $100,000  equivalent \nmay be procured through direct purchase. Goods and works to be financed by other cofinanciers \nwill be procured in accordance with the above guidelines or other guidelines for procurement as \nagreed upon with the respective cofinanciers and satisfactory to ADB. Water meters and service \nconnections will be installed by force account by the branch PNP in each subproject town, using \nmaterials supplied and delivered to the town.  \n \n41. \nAppendix  9  shows  the  proposed  procurement  packages  for  the  Project.  There  will  be  a \nseparate  ICB  contract  for  the  construction  of  water  supply  systems,  roads,  bridges,  drains,  and \npublic  sanitation  facilities  for  each  subproject  province.  Each  ICB  contract  will  cover  civil  works \ntogether  with  supply  and  installation  of  materials  and  equipment.  The  proposed  contract \npackaging will minimize overall costs of mobilization, management, and coordination for the PCU, \nPIUs, contractors and consultants; minimize the potential for problems that may otherwise arise \nat  interfaces  between  contracts;  ensure  that  contracts  are  large  enough  to  attract  competent \ncontractors;  and  allow  each  province  to  proceed  with  implementation  at  its  own  pace,  without \nbeing delayed by events in other provinces.  \n \nFor  purposes  of  expediency,  standardization,  and  cost-effectiveness,  the  PCU  will  carry \n42. \nout  all  procurement,  except  that  the  PIU  in  each  province  will  be  responsible  for  procurement \nunder component 4.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n43. \nTo  support  implementation  of  the  project,  a  total  of  957  person-months  of  consulting \nservices  (144  person-months  international,  and  813  person-months  domestic)  will  be  required. \nConsulting services will be procured under two separate consulting packages, by associations of \ninternational consulting firms and domestic consulting firms or individuals. Package A comprising \n50  person-months  international  and  82  person-months  domestic  consulting  services,  to  be \nfinanced by NORAD, will cover institutional strengthening for WASA and DHUP WSD (component \n1). Package B (94 person-months international and 731 person-months domestic) to be financed \nby  ADB,  will  provide  assistance  in  project  management,  feasibility  studies,  design  and \nconstruction supervision of water supply systems and urban infrastructure, preparation of social \nassessments with information on poverty, gender and ethnic groups, resettlement, environmental \nmanagement  and  monitoring,  awareness  and  participation  programs,  and  village  environmental \nimprovement. In addition, the consultants will prepare and deliver training programs, and provide \ncapacity  building,  general  engineering,  accounting  and  management  support  to  PCU,  PIUs, \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nOCTPC,  and  WATSANs.  They  will  also  provide  services  for  (i)  groundwater  surveys  including \ndrilling  and  pump  tests;  (ii)  topographical  surveys  for  feasibility  studies  and  design;  (iii)  water \nquality  testing  for  feasibility,  design,  and  monitoring  during  construction;  (iv)  geotechnical \ninvestigations and soils testing for feasibility studies and design; and (v) survey and clearance of \nunexploded  ordnance  (UXO).  The  Government  requested  that  package  A  consultants  be \nengaged via a renegotiated and renewed contract of the existing consulting firm, which has been \nproviding  consulting  services  for  capacity  building  and  institutional  development  to  WASA, \nfinanced  by  NORAD,  over  the  past  5  years.  Since  continuity  is  essential  for  effective  capacity \nbuilding  and  the  performance  of  the  existing  firm  is  satisfactory,  the  Government\u2019s  request  is \nconsidered  appropriate.  Package  B  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The groundwater investigations and UXO clearance will be \nincluded  in  the  consultancy  contract  as  provisional  cost  items  to  be  subcontracted  because  the \nscope  of  such  works  is  uncertain.  Consultants  engaged  under  package  A  will  be  located  in  the \nWASA/WSD  office.  To  minimize  costs,  the  consultants  engaged  under  the  package  B  will  be \nlocated  mainly  in  the  PCU  office  in  Vientiane,  and  will  have  representatives  stationed  in  each \nprovince to work with PIUs during the project construction stage. The outline terms of reference \nfor both packages are in Appendix 10. \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n44. \nPayment  of  eligible  expenditures  from  the  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  made  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001).  To  ensure  the  timely \nrelease  of  grant  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  and  expedite  project  implementation,  the \nGovernment  will,  immediately  upon  grant  effectiveness,  open  and  maintain  a  project  imprest \naccount  at  Bank  of  Lao  for  disbursement  of  eligible  expenditure.  MOF  will  be  responsible  for \nestablishing, managing, replenishing, and liquidating the account. In addition, the PCU and each \nPIU  will  set  up  a  second-generation  imprest  account  (SGIA)  in  dollars  with  a  commercial  bank \nacceptable  to  ADB  and  other  cofinanciers.22  The  initial  amount  to  be  allocated  to  the  imprest \naccount will be based on estimated expenditures for the first 6 months of project implementation, \nto be prepared by the PCU and each PIU, and up to $500,000. The amount to be deposited into \neach SGIA will be based on the first 6 months of the projected expenditure of the PCU or PIU, but \nwill  not  exceed  $25,000.  The  project  imprest  account  and SGIAs  will  be  established,  managed, \nreplenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January \n2001)  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the \nrecipient  and  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures  may  be  used  for \nreimbursing  eligible  expenditures  and  liquidating  of  advances  to  the  imprest  account.  The \nmaximum payment for any individual items using SOE is $20,000 equivalent.23  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n45. \nEach  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  project  progress  reports  in  a  short  standardized  format \nacceptable  to  all  financiers  and  submit  them  to  the  PCU  for  consolidation  and  reporting  to  the \nPSC, ADB, and other cofinanciers. The reports will be in such form and detail satisfactory to ADB \nand  other  cofinanciers.  Each  PNP  will  prepare  its  annual  financial  statements,  including  the  (i) \nbalance sheet, (ii) income statement, and (iii) cash flow statement. The PCU will also submit to \nADB, within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, a project completion report that \nwill  cover  the  details  of  project  implementation,  costs,  and  project  evaluation  activities  at  that \ntime, and other information requested by ADB. The report will highlight the development impacts \n\n                                                 \n22  The SGIA for the PCU will be set up immediately upon grant effectiveness, and the SGIA for each PIU will be set up \n\nimmediately after its subproject is approved by ADB.  \n\n23  The PCU and PIUs will receive necessary training to administer disbursement arrangements described in para 45. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nachieved  by  the  Project,  including  an  evaluation  of  resettlement  activities  and  conditions  of  the \naffected people after resettlement.  \n \n46. \nThe  project/subproject  accounts,  including  the  imprest  account,  SOE,  and  the  financial \nstatements  of  the  PNPs  will  be  audited  annually  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  and  other \ncofinanciers.  The  PCU  and  PIUs  will  prepare  the  required  information  for  audit,  including \ninformation on resettlement implementation, in accordance with project auditing requirements of \nthe Government, ADB, and other cofinanciers. Audited statements of project/subproject accounts \nand financial statements of PNPs, together with the report of the auditor, will be submitted to ADB \nthrough the PCU within 6 months of the close of the fiscal year.  \n \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n47.  MCTPC will ensure that a comprehensive program for project performance monitoring and \nevaluation (PPME) acceptable to ADB and other cofinanciers is carried out during implementation \nand  subsequent  operation  to  (i)  examine  the  Project\u2019s  technical  performance;  (ii)  evaluate  the \ndelivery  of  the  planned  facilities;  (iii)  assess  achievement  of  the  project  objectives;  and  (iv) \nmeasure  the  Project\u2019s  social,  economic,  financial,  and  institutional  impacts.  A  set  of  PPME \nindicators  will  be  developed  by  PCU  and  PIUs  at  the  start  of  the  Project,  based  on  the  project \nframework  in  Appendix  3  and  with  the  consultants\u2019  support  and  in  consultation  with  local \ncommunities. The socioeconomic data will be disaggregated by income group, gender, and ethnic \ngroup  as  appropriate.  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  PPME  activities,  including \npreproject and postproject physical and socioeconomic surveys, and data collection and analysis. \nEach  PIU  will  establish  a  PPME  baseline  based  on  the  preproject  surveys  and  data.  Annual \nPPME  reports  will  be  prepared  by  each  PIU,  and  consolidated  by  the  PCU  for  submission  to \nADB.  MCTPC  will  cause  the  PCU  to  submit  a  detailed  PPME  implementation  plan  for  ADB\u2019s \nreview and concurrence within 6 months of grant effectiveness.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n48. \nApart  from  regular  reviews,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  comprehensive \nreview  within  1  year  of  grant  effectiveness  when  detailed  design  for  phase  1  subprojects  is \nsubstantially completed. A mid-term review will also be undertaken within 30 months from grant \neffectiveness.  \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption \n\nThe  Government  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy,  particularly  the \n49. \nprovisions  in  the  recently  revised  Guidelines  for  Procurement  under  Asian  Development  Loans \nand  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers, \nrequiring  governments  as  well  as  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors,  and/or  consultants  to  observe \nthe highest standards of ethics during procurement and execution of the contracts financed under \nthe Project.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nGeneral  Gains.  The  Project  will  benefit  about  89,000  residents  in  2010  and  100,000  in \n50. \n2015  in  the  core  villages  of  about  12  small  towns  by  providing  safe  and  reliable  piped  water \nsupplies and improved urban environment that will have a direct impact on the health and living \ncondition of the town communities. The health benefits will come from (i) a safe and convenient \nwater  supply;  (ii)  improved  environmental  sanitation  through  drainage  and  related  works;  (iii) \nincreased use of domestic sanitation facilities due to increased awareness, appropriate sanitation \nmodels,  and  improved  water  supply;  (iv)  increased  knowledge  and  awareness  of  health  and \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nto \n\nincreased  access \n\nhygiene  issues;  and  (v)  avoidance  of  drudgery  associated  with  collecting  water.  The  health \nbenefits from physical investments under the Project will be enhanced by the hygiene awareness \nand promotion activities. About 100 core villages in the 12 project towns will benefit directly from \nVEI,  providing  access  roads,  footpaths,  and  improved  drainage  and  sanitation  in  residential \nareas.  Moreover,  an  estimated  98,000  rural  residents  in  the  surrounding  hinterlands  will  benefit \nfrom  improved  roads  and  bridges  allowing  better  access  to  urban  markets  and  social  services \nprovided in the project towns. The towns\u2019 economies will benefit from enhanced productivity as a \nresult  of  health  improvement,  timesavings  in  collecting  water,  as  well  as  from  increased  urban \nefficiency arising from improved roads, bridges, drainage, and sanitation. Residents in towns will \nalso benefit from lower water costs and from savings in health care costs. \n \n51. \nPoverty  Reduction.  All  project  interventions  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  poor \ndirectly or indirectly. Of about 187,000 project beneficiaries in 2010, about 40% or 76,000 will be \nthe  poor.  Socially  inclusive  processes  incorporated  in  the  Project  will  ensure  that  the  poor  will \nbenefit proportionately. Benefits for the poor will be realized through reduced drudgery, improved \nhealth,  reduced  expenditure  on  health  care,  and \nincome-earning \nopportunities. Because of the high levels of sickness within poor households and the consequent \ndisproportionately  high  expenditure  on  health  care,  clearly  the  poor  would  gain  most  from  the \nwater  supply  and  health  promotion  activities  of  the  Project.  The  Project  includes  a  deferred \npayment  of  connection  charges  and  a  lifeline  block  tariff  for  water  supply  services.  Both  will \nincrease the poor\u2019s access to safe and affordable water supply. The VEI is designed to address \nthe  needs  of  the  poor  in  particular.  Under  this  subcomponent,  the  poorest  villages  will  have \npriority for basic infrastructure and services improvement. To ensure responsiveness to the needs \nof the poor, the VEI assigns greater active roles to the village residents, particularly the poor, in \ndesigning and implementing the VEI works. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 11. \n \n52. \nGender  Impact.  While  both  men  and  women  will  benefit  from  project  activities,  women \nwill experience greater benefits in terms of timesavings, reduced drudgery, and improved family \nhealth.  Women  perform  the  bulk  of  household  work  with  the  help  of  children,  particularly  girls. \nThey  are  generally  responsible  for  water  collection,  family  hygiene  and  sanitation,  and  care  for \nsick family members. Discussions with women in the three sample subproject towns revealed that \nwomen and children spent an average of about 1\u20132 hours per day collecting water. Construction \nof  new  public  toilet  facilities  will  take  into  consideration  specific  gender  needs,  thereby  giving \nwomen  more  privacy.  Particular  attention  is  given  to  involving  women  in  employment,  decision \nmaking,  learning  and  training  activities  under  the  Project.  For  instance,  qualified  women  will  be \neligible  for  at  least  30%  of  new  jobs  generated  by  the  Project  in  the  community  (i.e.  O&M  of \ncommunity-based initiatives). A gender strategy for the Project is presented in Appendix 12.  \n \n53. \nEthnic  Groups.  The  46  ethnic  groups  in  the  Lao  PDR  are  classified  into  three  broad \ncategories\u2014Lao  Loum  (majority),  Lao  Theung,  and  Lao  Soung.  The  project  area  has \napproximately  78%  Lao  Loum  and  22%  Lao  Theung  and  Lao  Soung  ethnic  communities.  All \nethnic  groups  will  benefit  directly  from  piped  water  supply  and  road,  drain,  and  sanitation \nimprovements.  No  difference  was  found  in  the  water  supply  and  urban  development  needs  of \ndifferent  ethnic  groups  in  the  three  sample  subprojects.  Ethnic  groups  with  low  levels  of  formal \neducation  will  benefit  through  nonformal  education  activities  that  are  culturally  sensitive  (i.e. \nmedia  and  drama  groups).  The  Project  has  included  this  in  its  design  within  the  PACA \ncomponent.  Specific  actions  to  enhance  project  benefits  or  mitigate  negative  project  impacts \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\namong  some  ethnic  groups24  have  been  included  in  the  different  social  strategies  and  short \nresettlement  plans  for  the  three  sample  subprojects.  An  ethnic  groups  development  framework \n(Appendix  13)  has  been  prepared  for  the  Project  to  guide  the  assessment  of  the  impact  of  the \nsubprojects  on  ethnic  groups,  according  to  Government  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  indigenous \npeoples policy. \n \n54. \nLand Acquisition and Resettlement. The Project will have very limited adverse impacts \nfrom land acquisition and resettlement (LAR). As part of the project eligibility criteria, LAR in each \nsubproject town must be Category B, or not significant, according to ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement.  In  the  three  sample  subprojects,  about  4,000  square  meters  (m2)  of  land  will  be \npermanently  acquired.  Approximately  115  households  (606  persons)  will  experience  permanent \nloss of land or structures. Permanent loss for each household can include, for example, a few fruit \ntrees, a fence or a wall, or a fraction of land along the right-of-way for drainage or road upgrading. \nOf the 115, 2 households (seven persons) are expected to require complete relocation. A number \nof factors have helped minimize permanent land acquisition and structural damage: (i) alternative \nfacility locations, (ii) relatively low population density, (iii) abundant public lands, and (iv) use of \nexisting rights-of-way for the route of distribution pipelines and roads. In addition to permanently \nacquired  land,  about  4,200  m2  will  be  temporarily  used  during  construction  for  pipe-laying  and \nroad construction activities. About 60 households (342 persons) will experience temporary loss of \nland  or  structures  in  the  three  sample  subprojects.  A  summary  resettlement  framework  and  a \nsummary  of  the  short  resettlement  plans  for  the  three  sample  subprojects  are  presented  in \nAppendix 14. The detailed resettlement framework is in Supplementary Appendix I, and individual \nshort resettlement plans for three sample subproject towns are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nEnvironmental Impacts. The Project will improve the quality, reliability, and sustainability \n55. \nof  the  water  supply  and  environment  in  the  project  towns.  The  Project  has  been  classified  as \nCategory  B  (nonsensitive),  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003). \nInitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  carried  out  for  the  three  sample  subprojects  showed  no \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impact.  The  main  potential  environmental  impact  associated \nwith the water supply system is sludge generation and its impact on the receiving river. While the \nvolume  of  sludge  from  the  water  treatment  plant  will  be  higher  during  the  wet  season,  sludge \nvolume  as  a  percentage  of  the  river  flow  will  be  less  than  0.01%,  and  will  have  insignificant \nimpact.  Potential  environmental  impacts  of  urban  infrastructure  improvements  are  mainly  short-\nterm during the construction period and can be minimized by the proposed mitigating measures \nand  environmentally  sound  engineering  and  construction  practices.  The  community \nawareness/environmental  improvement  programs  will  complement  the  mitigating  measures  and \nenhance  the  sustainable  use  of  the  water  supply  and  drainage  systems.  The  environmental \nassessment  and  review  procedures  (EARP)  for  subprojects  will  ensure  that  selection, \nassessment, and implementation of the remaining subprojects will comply with the environmental \nrequirements of the Government and ADB. A summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) \nprepared for the overall Project, IEEs for three sample subprojects, and EARP are presented in \nSupplementary Appendixes K and L. \n \n56. \nInstitutional  Impact.  The Project will build on ADB\u2019s previous institutional assistance to \nthe  water  supply  sector  to  further  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  efforts  of  building  up  an \neffective  institutional  framework  for  decentralized  water  supply  operations.  The  Project\u2019s \ninstitutional  interventions  have  focused  on  urgent  institutional  reform  and  strengthening  needs \nwith  the  view  of  finally  developing,  with  follow-up  support,  a  sound  institutional  framework  for \n\n                                                 \n24  At  the  time  of  project  preparation,  Lao  Theung  and  Lao  Soung  were  identified  as  the  relevant  ethnic  groups,  as \nrequired by ADB\u2019s indigenous peoples policy. Additional ethnic groups may be identified during the course of project \nimplementation. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nwater supply with an effective planner, a capable regulator, and efficient operators. The Project \nwill  help  lay  a  solid  legal  foundation  for  sector  regulation,  clearly  define  the  responsibilities  and \nroles of WASA and WSD, develop organizational structures and staff requirements for WASA and \nWSD, set up the WASA regulatory committee, establish a funding source for WASA operations, \nprovide training for WASA and WSD staff, and assist the Government in developing and revising \nthe sector\u2019s policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines as necessary.  \n \n57. \nEconomic  Analysis.  Economic  benefits  from  Project  will  be  gained  from  safer,  more \nreliable, and affordable water supply and improved environments in the project towns. Economic \nanalysis was conducted for the WSS component in each sample subproject town in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and the Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis  of  Water  Supply  Projects  (1998).  Quantifiable  economic  benefits  of  improved  water \nsupply services include benefits from nonincremental water consumption, valued at the average \nsupply price of water from nonpiped sources; incremental water consumption, valued at average \ndemand price; and other resource savings. The average economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nfor the three sample subprojects is estimated at 21.5%, with individual results ranging from 19.1% \nto  22.7%.  The  economic  analysis  is  presented  in  Appendix  15,  and  detailed  calculations  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix M. \n \n58. \nFinancial  Evaluation.  Project-specific  progressive  tariffs  will  be  adopted  under  the \nProject.  The  progressive  tariff  structure  proposed  under  the  Project  will  consist  of  three \nconsumption blocks, namely lifeline block (less than 40 lpcd), average block (between 40 and 85 \nlpcd),  and  above-average  block  (more  than  85  lpcd).  The  target  average  tariff  level  is  set  to \nrecover  full  O&M  costs  plus  30%  of  capital  costs  with  a  debt  service  ratio  of  at  least  1.2. \nProgressive tariff structures are developed based on the following principles: (i) the tariff for the \nlifeline block is set to recover direct cash operating and maintenance expenses; (ii) the tariff for \nthe middle block is set to recover cash O&M expenses, taxes, and debt service and to achieve a \ndebt-service  ratio  of  at  least  1.2;  and  (iii)  the  tariff  for  the  highest  domestic  block  and  all \nnondomestic  consumption  is  set  at  1.5  times  the  second  block  tariff.    The  financial  and \naffordability  analyses  for  the  three  sample  subprojects  show  that  the  tariffs  proposed  by  the \nProject based on the above principles are affordable to all, including the poor households. With \nthe projected tariffs, all PNPs are expected to have positive cash flows after the subprojects are \nput  into  operation  in  2009\u2014no  additional  subsidy  is  required  during  the  operation  period.  The \nfinancial analysis is presented in Appendix 16, and details are in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \n59. \nRisks.  The  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  (i)  lack  of  progress  in  policy  and \ninstitutional  reforms,  particularly  transforming  WASA  into  a  capable  sector  regulator;  (ii)  limited \nhuman  resources  and  institutional  capacities  at  provincial  and  district  levels;  (iii)  uncertainty \nregarding  tariff  increases  necessary  to  ensure  sustainability  of  water  supply  services;  (iv) \ninsufficient  community  participation  in  project  implementation,  particularly  from  women  and  the \npoor;  (v)  poor  and  vulnerable  households  negatively  affected  by  resettlement;  (vi)  inadequate \nresources  available  for counterpart funding;  (vii)  insistence by  provincial  governments  on  overly \nconservative  water  supply  design  parameters,  resulting in  inefficient  or  wasted  investment;  (viii) \ninadequate time and resources for assessing raw water; and (ix) inadequate sources for O&M of \nproject facilities.  \n \n60. \nThe  Project  incorporates  measures  to  mitigate  those  risks.  They  include  (i)  institutional \nstrengthening of WASA and DHUP, reform agenda, and associated assurances agreed to by the \nGovernment;  (ii)  capacity  building  for  PCU,  PIU,  OCTPC,  and  WATSANs  to  enhance  their \nmanagerial  and  operational  capacities;  (iii)  commitment  to  tariff  reforms  and  associated \nassurances by the respective provincial governments before including subproject in the Project; \n(iv) a participation program, gender strategy, and public awareness campaigns; (v) a resettlement \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nframework and resettlement plans to ensure that all affected people will maintain or improve their \nliving  standards  after  project  completion;  (vi)  confirmation  by  MOF  and  the  particular  provincial \ngovernment of priority in budgetary allocation of counterpart funds; (vii) continuing dialogue and \nfollow-up  on  appropriate  technology  and  design  criteria  during  project  implementation  via \nfeasibility study and detailed design reviews, inception and review missions, as well as  financial \nand tariff reforms that link the tariff level more directly and closely to the investment costs; (viii) \nallocation  of  resources  from  the  Project  Preparatory  TA  to  continue  flow  and  water  quality \nmeasurements during the 2005 dry and wet seasons for the candidate phase 1 subprojects, and \ninclusion  of  PNPs\u2019  regular  flow  and  water  quality  measurements  for  potential  sources  of  small \ntown water supply systems as a subproject selection criterion; and (ix) local ownership enhanced \nby  community  participation  in  designing,  implementing,  and  maintaining  the  facilities  and  the \nprovincial government\u2019s commitment to adequate budget allocation for O&M. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n61. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nEach participating PNP will collect all water bill arrears in accordance with arrears \ncollection  action  plans  to  be  agreed  upon  by  the  Government,  ADB,  and  each \nparticipating  PNP  before  any  disbursement  of  funds  to  the  relevant  subproject. \nEach participating PNP will reduce accounts receivable to less than 90 days within \n24 months (for phase 1 subprojects) and 36 months (for phase 2 subprojects) after \ngrant  effectiveness,  and  will  maintain  accounts  receivable  of  less  than  90  days \nthereafter.  Where  Government  agency  water  bills  are  outstanding  for  60  days  or \nmore, the Government will, within a further 30 days, allocate to the concerned PNP \nspecial  funds  from  its  budgetary  resources  sufficient  to  fully  liquidate  the \noutstanding accounts. \n\nWithin 30 months of grant effectiveness, the Government will review and revise as \nnecessary the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy Statement, the National \nWater  Supply  Tariff  Policies,  and  the  Water  Tariff  Determination  Guidelines  to \nfurther  clarify  and  strengthen  the  social,  economic,  financial,  and  administrative \ntargets for the urban WSS sector, based on experience and lessons learned from \nimplementing  the  policies  and  guidelines.  The  Government  will  approve  and \nimplement  the  revised  policies  and  guidelines,  acceptable  to  ADB,  within  36 \nmonths of grant effectiveness. \n\n(iii)  Within  36  months  of  grant  effectiveness,  a  WASA  operations  surcharge  will  be \nestablished following the recommendations of the WASA operations funding plan \nto be prepared and agreed upon during project implementation. \n\n(iv)  MCTPC  will  cause  all  PNPs  to  monitor  water  quality  and  quantity  data  of  the \npotential raw water sources for urban water supply throughout the country, and will \nensure  that  the  least-cost  solution  for  the  water  supply  system\u2500  as  determined \nfrom a comprehensive feasibility study that focuses primarily on appropriate water \ntreatment  technology  and  service  areas\u2500  is  adopted  for  each  subproject.  Towns \nwithout such data will not be qualified for inclusion in the Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nFor  the  water  supply  components  of  subprojects,  the  participating  PNPs  will \nestablish  schemes  for  poor  households  that  cannot  afford  to  pay  the  water \nconnection  costs,  to  pay  the  connection  fee  over  a  24-month  period,  without \ninterest. The criteria for participation in such schemes and the operating rules will \nbe  determined  by  the  provincial  governments  concerned,  in  conjunction  with \nparticipating  PNPs  and  local  community  organizations,  and  will  be  satisfactory  to \nADB. \n\nThe Government will provide funds for sanitation improvements as a grant for poor \nhouseholds (the equivalent of $75 for each household that elects to connect to the \nwater supply to construct toilets with septic tanks and a smaller amount for those \nwho decide not to connect, to improve their toilet facilities), subject to satisfactory \ncompletion  of  sanitation  facilities.  The  household  eligibility  criteria  and  the \noperating procedure will be determined by the provincial governments concerned, \nin conjunction with participating PNPs and local community organizations, and will \nbe satisfactory to ADB. \n\nThe  Government  will  re-lend  30%  of  the  costs  of  the  water  supply  schemes  in  a \nsubproject  as  a  subsidiary  loan  to  each  relevant  PNP.  The  subsidiary  loan  will \nhave  an  interest  rate  of  6.4%,  a  maturity  period  of  25  years,  including  a  6-year \ngrace  period.  The  balance  \u250070% of  the  costs  of  the  water  supply  schemes\u2500  will \nbe  provided  to  the  relevant  PNP  as  a  grant.  A  subsidiary  loan  agreement, \nacceptable to ADB, will be signed and duly executed before any disbursement of \nfunds to the relevant subproject. \n\n(viii)  From  the  start  of  a  particular  subproject\u2019s  operation,  the  participating  PNP  will \nadopt  in  the  subproject  town  (a)  a  subproject-specific  tariff,  and  (b)  progressive \ntariff structures with three consumption blocks acceptable to ADB. The tariffs must \nbe  set  at  such  levels  to  (a)  recover  full  O&M  costs  of  the  water  supply  scheme \nunder  the  subproject,  (b)  serve  debt-servicing  obligations  under  the  subproject, \nand (c) maintain a debt service ratio of 1.2:1. Each PNP will undertake an annual \nassessment,  satisfactory  to  ADB,  of  the  tariff  levels  required  to  meet  these \nrequirements  over  the  forthcoming  year.    On  the  basis  of  the  assessment,  each \nprovincial  government  will  take  all  steps  necessary,  including  implementation  of \ntariff increases, to enable the PNP to meet the requirements. \n\n(ix)  MCTPC will ensure that land acquisition and resettlement for each subproject town \nis  not  significant  and  is  done  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and \nregulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  as  set  out  in  the \nresettlement  framework  and  short  resettlement  plan  for  each  subproject  town.  A \nshort  resettlement  plan  for  each  subproject  town  will  be  prepared,  updated  as \nrequired,  and  implemented.  In  case  of  discrepancies  between  Government \nregulations and ADB policy, ADB\u2019s policy will apply.  \n\n \n(x) \n\nMCTPC  will  ensure  that  subprojects  are  designed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nindigenous  peoples  policy  and  the  applicable  framework  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  MCTPC  will  further  ensure  that  all  ethnic  groups  have \nequitable  opportunities  to  participate  in  training,  recruitment,  and  O&M  activities \nunder the Project. \n\n(xi)  MCTPC will implement the gender strategy prepared for the Project in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  gender  and  development.  The  Government  will  ensure  that \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(xii) \n\nwomen receive at least 30% of new jobs generated by community-based initiatives \nunder  the  Project  and  that  at  least  30%  of  persons  in  each  CAT  and  each \nWATSAN are women. \n\nThe Government will ensure that its laws and regulations governing environmental \nimpact assessments, as well as ADB's Environment Policy (2002) are followed.  If \nthere is any discrepancy between the recipient\u2019s laws and regulations, and ADB's \nenvironment  policy,  then  ADB\u2019s  policy  requirements  will  apply.  The  Government \nwill ensure that MCTPC conducts UXO survey and clearance, certifies completion \nof  such  clearance  to  ADB,  and  prepares  an  environmental  assessment  for  each \nsubproject,  meeting  the  requirements  of  the  IEE  and  environmental  assessment \nand review procedures, for submission to ADB for approval before a subproject is \napproved.  MCTPC will ensure that the IEE in a local language will be available on \nrequest  at  the  PIU  office  of  each  subproject  town  for  the  public  and  other \ninterested parties before the relevant subproject starts. \n\nThe loan and grant agreements with other cofinanciers are duly signed and will become \n\nConditions for Grant Effectiveness \n\nConditions for Disbursement to a Subproject \n\n \nB. \n \n62. \neffective subject only to the effectiveness of the ADB grant. \n \nC. \n \n63. \nexecuted between MOF and the PNP responsible for the subproject. \n \n64. \nGovernment and the PNP responsible for the subproject. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nThe  subsidiary  loan  agreement  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB  has  been \n\nAn  arrears  collection  action  plan  acceptable  to  ADB  has  been  agreed  upon  by \n\n65. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  (i)  the  grant  of \n$10,000,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the  Northern  and  Central  Regions \nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Project in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft Grant Agreement; and (ii) the administration of the loan in an amount not exceeding \nthe  equivalent  of  $9,000,000  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  for  the  Northern  and \nCentral Regions Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project to be provided by the OPEC Fund \nfor  International  Development  and  to  be  administered  by  ADB  under  the  terms  of  a  Letter  of \nCooperation to be entered into by ADB and the OPEC Fund for International Development. \n\n21 July 2005 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n 21\n\nURBAN WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n\nA. \n\nCountry Background  \n\n1. \nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is essentially a rural country, with a \ntotal  population  of  around  5.7  million.  About  4.5  million  or  80%  live  a  largely  subsistence \nexistence  in  nearly  12,000  small  rural  villages  scattered  throughout  the  country.  Although  the \neconomy  is  still  largely  rural,  with  agriculture  accounting  for  some  50%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP),  the  role  of  the  urban  sector  is  growing.  During  1997\u20132003  the  industry  and \nservices  sector  components  of  the  GDP  increased  at  average  annual  rates  of  around  10%, \ncompared  with  around  5%  for  agriculture,  reflecting  increased  activity  and  productivity  and \ngreater  opportunities  in  urban  areas.  The  urban  sector  encompasses  145  officially  designated \nurban centers or towns in 142 districts. These towns have a combined population of 1.2 million, \nor  about  20%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  population.  The  five  largest  towns  include  the  capital, \nVientiane (population about 300,000), and four secondary towns (populations 20,000\u201360,000), \naccounting  for  45%  of  the  total  urban  population.  The  provincial  and  district  towns,  with \npopulations ranging from 5,000 to 20,000, are classified as small towns. Development of these \nsmall towns is an important part of the Government\u2019s national development agenda, which aims \nto achieve the overall goal of exiting least-developed-country status by 2020 through sustained \nequitable economic growth and social development. The small towns function as administrative \nand economic centers for their surrounding rural areas, and act as economic links between the \nrural areas and national and international markets. They are the locations of immediate markets, \ntransport depots, and agricultural processing centers in the rural hinterland.  \n \nB. \n\nQuality and Coverage of Urban Water Supply and Sanitation \n\n2. \nOver the past decade, all 16 provinces, the capital Vientiane, and the special economic \nzone  have  benefited  from  substantial  investments  in  water  supply  systems,  primarily  through \nassistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other external agencies. While about \n69%  of  the  urban  population  in  Vientiane  and  the  four  secondary  towns  have  piped  water \nsupply, overall coverage in urban areas is only 39% (2003). Water supply coverage in the 140 \nsmall towns is only about 17%, and most residents rely on shallow wells, ponds and streams, \nwhich  are  often  biologically  contaminated.  Women  and  children  spend  as  much  as  1\u20132  hours \neach  day  fetching  water  from  distant  sources.  Table  A1  summarizes  the  status  of  PNP-piped \nwater supply systems in urban centers throughout the country. \n \n3. \nNone  of  the  urban  centers  has  a  functioning  municipal  wastewater  treatment  system. \nIndividual property owners are responsible for developing and managing their on-site sanitation \nsystems.  Overall,  about  54%  of  urban  households  have  pour-flush  toilets,  but  there  are  large \ndifferences  in  coverage  between  the  five  largest  towns  (78%  coverage)  and  the  small  towns \n(42% coverage). Some 46% of urban residents do not have proper toilet facilities and use open \nground, fields, local drains, and watercourses for disposal of excreta and wastewater. There are \nfew  public  toilets  in  markets  and  temples,  and  less  than  10%  of  primary  schools  have  proper \nlatrines.  Pour-flush  toilets  with  pit  latrines  generally  provide  a  satisfactory  form  of  wastewater \ndisposal  in  low-density  areas  because  of  the  natural  assimilative  capacity  of  the  subsoil. \nHowever,  problems  often  arise  because  of  poor  design  or  construction,  unsuitable  soil  or \ngroundwater conditions, lack of maintenance, and low hygiene and sanitation awareness. About \n7% of households use septic tanks systems discharging to drains or soakaways. Septic systems \nrequired  in  medium  and  high-density  areas  but  often  provide  only  partial  treatment  of \nwastewater,  because  they  are  not  constructed  to  proper  standards  and  are  not  emptied \nregularly. Due to poor functioning of the drainage network, partially treated septic tank effluent \nor seepage is often detained in the populated areas, posing risks to the public and polluting the \n\n\f \n22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\ngroundwater. Low coverage of safe water supplies and poor sanitation conditions have caused \nin outbreaks of diarrheal diseases and/or cholera in several areas, resulting in high numbers of \nillnesses  and  deaths.  Infection  with  soil-transmitted  helminths  among  school-age  children  is \nmore  than  50%,  as  is  the  infection  rate  with  food  transmitted  helminths  among  the  overall \npopulation. Lack of clean water, inadequate sanitation and non-hygienic practices are the main \ncauses.   \n \n\nTable A1: Status of Formal Water Supply Systems in Urban Centersa\n(as of November 2004) \n \n\nTowns \n(no.) \n\nConstructed \n(no.) \n\nCommitted (no.) \n\nWSSSP \n\nOthers \n\nRemaining \n(no.) \n\nCategory \nAccording to \nNGPES \nPriority poor district \nPoor district \nNot identified as \npoor district \n \n \n\nSubtotal \nTotal \n\n47 \n25 \n70 \n\n142 \n142 \n\n1 \n6 \n23 \n\n30 \n30 \n\n2 \n2 \n9 (+1) a\n\n13 (+1) \n17 (+1) \n\n2 \n \n2 \n\n4 \n\n42 \n17 \n36(+2) \n\n95(+2) \n95(+2) \n\nTotal  \n(no.) \n\n47 \n25 \n70 (+3) \n\n142 (+3) \n142 (+3) \n\nNGPES = National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy, WSSSP = Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. \na Numbers in parentheses indicate urban areas that are not district centers.  \nSource: Map of piped water supply status in urban centres, Water Supply Authority.  \n \nC. \n\nSector Policy, Decentralization, and Sector Institutions \n\n4. \nIn  the  early  to  late  1990s,  management  of  all  the  nation\u2019s urban  water  supply  systems \nwas  centralized  in  Vientiane  under  the  control  of  Nam  Papa  Lao  (NPL),  a  state-owned \nenterprise  (SOE)  within  the  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Post  and  Communication \n(MCTPC).  Provincial  water  supply  offices  reported  directly  to  NPL  and  system  revenues  were \nconsolidated under one central account. Subsidies from the large Vientiane scheme to the then \n20 or so smaller provincial urban systems masked the poor performance of the sector generally \nand  the  smaller  schemes  in  particular.  In  1996  the  Law  on  Water  and  Water  Resources  was \nsigned  under  Presidential  Decree  No.  126/PR.  The  law  established  the  broad  principles, \nregulations, and measures for the managing, exploiting, using, and developing water and water \nresources in the Lao PDR.  \n \n5. \nSubsequently,  in  1999,  in  Prime  Ministerial  Decision  No.  37/PM,  the  policy  on \nmanagement  and  development  of  the  water  supply  sector,  or  the  Sector  Policy  Statement \n(SPS), was enacted. It sets the water supply sector goal as to provide 24 hours daily access to \nsafe drinking water for 80% of the urban population by the year 2020. According to the policy, \nMCTPC  has  overall  responsibility  for  managing  the  urban  water  supply  sector,  while  The \nNational  Center  for  Environmental  Health  (Nam  Sa\u2019at)  is  responsible  for  managing  the  rural \nwater  supply  sector  under  the  Ministry  of  Health.  The  main  operational  impacts  of  Decision \n37/PM were to create a new organization, the Water Supply Authority (WASA) under MCTPC, \nand  to  devolve  responsibility  for  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  from  central  to  provincial \ngovernments. From late 1999, each provincial water supply enterprise (known as nam papa or \nprovincial  nam  papa  [PNP])  became  an  autonomous  SOE  operating  under  the  supervision  of \nthe  provincial  Department  of  Communication,  Transport,  Post  and  Communication  (DCTPC). \nThe  provincial  government  owns  the  urban  water  supply  system,  while  the  PNPs  are \nresponsible  for  managing  the  systems.  Nam  Papa  Vientiane,  operator  of  the  capital\u2019s  water \nsupply systems became a separate agency under DCTPC of Vientiane prefecture but retained \nthe important role of training the new PNPs.  \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n 23\n\nSector  reorganization  arising  from  37/PM  had  its  largest  impact  on  the  PNPs,  which \n6. \nwere  transformed  from  branch  offices  of  NPL  to  individual  state  owned  enterprises  (SOEs). \nThey  were  suddenly  cut  off  from  the  financial  subsidies  and  much  of  the  technical, \nadministrative, and managerial assistance formerly provided by NPL. Accordingly, ADB, World \nBank,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD),  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \n(JICA),  and  other  agencies  have  provided  PNPs  with  capacity  building  programs  since  1999, \nmost of which are still ongoing. Following decentralization, PNPs were intended to be financially \nself-supporting,  and  responsibility  for  tariff  setting  was  given  to  the  respective  provincial \ngovernments.  In  practice,  tariffs  set  on  a  province-wide  basis  are  insufficient  to  cover  proper \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs,  let  alone  debt  service  or  depreciation.  As  a  result, \nmost  PNPs  operate  at  a  loss  and  require  subsidies  from  provincial  governments.  In  most \nprovinces,  government  agencies  are  delinquent  in  paying  their  water  bills.  Government \nonlending arrangements to provinces (currently only 15% of capital cost is passed on as loan) \nhave  acted  as  a  disincentive  to  adopting  least  cost  solutions  to  their  water  supply  systems. \nThese  factors  combine  to  result  in  unsustainable,  deteriorating  water  supply  systems  and \nultimately to poor customer service. To overcome these impediments to financial sustainability, \nthe  Government,  with  WASA  assistance,  issued  a  National  Water  Supply  Tariff  Policy  in  April \n2004. WASA now assists PNPs to establish tariffs at levels sufficient for sustainable operation \nand to adopt appropriate water supply service levels. \n \nUnder  Decision  37/PM,  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Planning  (DHUP)  is \n7. \nresponsible, through its Water Supply Division (WSD), for setting sector development strategies \nand  plans,  planning  staff  training,  and  studying  technical  standards  of  water  supply  systems. \nWSD also has the task of managing an ambitious long-term program of capital investment in the \nurban water supply and sanitation sector, but to date it has  received little external assistance, \nexcept  in  the  area  of  project  management.  As  a  result,  WSD  has  very  limited  capacity  to \nundertake its core functions, and it has few staff and resources. In addition, its responsibilities \noverlap with those of WASA, causing confusion. These limitations pose a major constraint to the \nlong-term sustainability of the water sector.  \n \n8. \nFollowing  Decision  37/PM,  WASA  was  established  in  1999  to  assist  the  Minister  of \nMCTPC  to  plan,  manage  and  regulate  the  water  supply  sector.  Its  assigned  functions  include \nstrategic planning, formulating regulations, establishing technical standards and specifications, \nand  managing  and  monitoring  the  water  sector.  The  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  is  to \ngradually  develop  WASA  as  an  effective  and  capable  sector  regulator.  Immediately  after  its \nestablishment, WASA took over NPL\u2019s role of managing externally funded projects. The project \nmanagement activities not only diverted WASA\u2019s focus from its core regulatory and monitoring \nfunctions,  but  also  conflicted  with  its  intended  role  as  regulator.  Since  2001,  DHUP\u2019s  project \nmanagement  capacity  has  been  strengthened  and  it  has  gradually  assumed  the  project \nmanagement  function  from  WASA.  In  2003  and  2004,  WASA  focused  increasingly on  its  core \nregulatory  functions,  which  included:  (i)  coordinating  and  collating  financial  and  performance \ninformation from PNPs; (ii) publishing the annual water sector performance reports for 2002 and \n2003,  which  evaluated  the  technical  and  financial  performance  of  all  PNPs  throughout  the \ncountry; (iii) preparing tariff guidelines, and assisting with preparation of the water tariff policy; \n(iv) preparing water quality guidelines; and (v) preparing accounting and reporting guidelines for \nPNPs.  It  also  carried  out  technical  activities  assigned  by  DHUP,  including  updating  the  sector \ninvestment  plan  for  urban  water  supply  and  facilitating  private  sector  participation  proposals. \nHowever, the regulation capacity of WASA remains weak due mainly to (i) lack of a solid legal \nfoundation, (ii) limited and unstable human resources, and (iii) unclear division of responsibilities \nin relation to DHUP/MCTPC. The Government has begun the steps necessary to install WASA \nas a dedicated regulatory authority and a Prime Minister Decree on Regulation of Urban Water \n\n\f \n24 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nSupply  Operations,  which  sets  the  legal  foundation  and  clearly  specifies  the  responsibilities, \nstaffing,  and  funding  arrangements  for  WASA,  is  expected  to  be  approved  in  2005.  Decision \n37/PM  also  provided  for  a  Regulatory  Committee  to  oversee  WASA\u2019s  operations  and  to \nconsider  regulatory  matters  and  complaints  from  consumers  and  PNPs.  The  Board  is  now \nexpected to be established in 2005 following the approval of the Decree on Regulation of Urban \nWater Supply Operations. \n \n9. \nAccording  to  Decision  37/PM,  (i)  the  Ministry  of  Health  is  responsible  for  directing, \npromoting,  and  managing  urban  environmental  hygiene;  (ii)  each  provincial  government  is \nresponsible  for  developing  urban  environmental  hygiene  in  its  province;  (iii)  PNPs  are \nresponsible  for  compliance  of  sanitation  facilities  with  the  sanitation  regulations;  (iv)  MCTPC \nand WASA are responsible for wastewater management systems, but do not have any specific \nresponsibilities  for  sanitation;  and  (v)  individual  property  owners  are  responsible  for  on-site \nwastewater  systems.  Both  Science  Technology  and  Environment  Agency  and  the  Ministry  of \nIndustry  issue  regulations  for  wastewater  discharge  from  communities  and  industries.  While \nmost  provinces  have  sanitation  regulations,  in  general,  the  regulations  are  weak,  institutional \nresponsibilities are not clearly defined, and the regulations are not strictly enforced.  \n \nD. \n\nSector Funding and Investment Plans \n\n10. \nCapital investments in the urban water supply sector are funded almost entirely through \nexternal  assistance,  while  tariffs  and  other  user  charges  applied  by  the  PNPs  fund  O&M. \nBetween  2001  and  2004,  allocations  made  through  the  Government  for  capital  investments  in \nthe  urban  and  water  supply  sector  totaled  $39.6  million,  an  average  of  about  $9.9  million \nannually. Virtually all of this funding was provided through external assistance in a mix of grants \nand  loans,  while  a  very  small  amount  came  from  the  Government\u2019s  own  internal  resources.  \nCurrently  only  15%  capital  costs  of  the  water  supply  systems  are  passed  on  as  loan  to  the \nPNPs. Repayment of these onlent amounts, as well as O&M costs, are funded from the PNPs\u2019 \noperating revenues. However, the revenues have been insufficient to achieve adequate levels \nof  O&M.  In  2002  and  2003,  the  PNPs  generated  total operating  revenues  of $3.6 million  from \nwater tariffs and $4.1 million from other user charges. However, because the timely collection of \nbilled  revenue  is  a  significant  problem  for  almost  all  PNPs,  actual  cash  flows  into  the  sector \ngenerated from those sources are lower. \n \n11. \nTo  meet  the  sector  goal,  the  Government  prepared  in  1999  a  sector  investment  plan \n(SIP)  that  listed  all  urban  center  water  supply  systems  in  order  of  priority  for  rehabilitation, \nexpansion,  or  development.  The  SIP  has  guided  sector  development  in  the  past  5  years, \nincluding  investments  funded  by  ADB  and  other  external  agencies.  The  SIP  was  updated \nrecently  under  TA  4377-LAO1  to  reflect  the  Government\u2019s  increasing  emphasis  on  equitable \ndevelopment  by  improving  the  small  towns,  particularly  those  in  the  poorest  districts.  The \nupdated  SIP  (Appendix  2),  which  estimates  future  investment  needs  of  about  $267  million, \nincluding  $103  million  for  small  towns,  represents  a  balanced,  stepwise  approach  to  water \nsupply  development  in  the  country.  It  is  considered  realistic  and  achievable  based  on \nexperience and the Government\u2019s performance in implementing projects over the past decade. \nThe  investments  under  the  updated  SIP  are  prioritized  according  to  factors,  including \npopulation; poverty status; location relative to a major road, transport node, growth corridor, or \ninternational border; tourism potential; and provincial government\u2019s development priority. Out of \nthe 18 small towns having first priority in the updated SIP, 12 are in the northern region and 6 \nare in the central regions. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2004.

project,  requiring  small  towns  and  their \nprovincial  governments  to  demonstrate  their  commitment  to  the  Project  and  its  associated \nreforms,  thus  encouraging  a  demand-led  approach.  Each  subproject  will  be  required  to  meet \neligibility  criteria  agreed  upon  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  other  concerned \ndevelopment  agencies,  and  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (PDR), \nbefore it can be considered and approved for funding.   \n \n2. \n \n\nThe steps for subproject selection are as follows: \n\nThe  concerned  provincial  government  will \nthe  Ministry  of \nCommunications Transport Posts and Construction (MCTPC) that the subproject \ntown be included in the Project. \n\nrequest \n\nMCTPC  will  carry  out  initial  screening  of  towns  (using  the  screening  criteria \ndescribed  in  para.  3),  prioritize  them  for  development,  and  advise  each \nsubproject province of the rankings. \n\nIf  a  town  has  high  priority  for  development  and  meets  the  Project\u2019s  screening \ncriteria, it will be subject to a detailed feasibility study and appraisal by the project \nmanagement unit (PMU), with the assistance of consultants.  \n\nIf the feasibility study and appraisal show that the subproject meets the Project\u2019s \neligibility  criteria  (para.  4),  MCTPC  will  submit  the  Feasibility  Study  and \nSubproject Appraisal Report to ADB for approval. \n\nThe  following  initial  screening  criteria  must  be  met  before  the  town  is  admitted  as  a \n\n3. \ncandidate for possible inclusion in the Project: \n \n\nThe subproject is included in the water sector investment plan. \n\nThe  town  does  not  have  a  significant  piped  water  supply  system  and  shows  a \nlarge demand for paid piped water supply. \n\nThe subproject is not being considered for funding by another aid agency. \n\nThe town\u2019s projected design population will be greater than 4,000 by 2015. \n\nThe subproject town has a government-approved urban master plan.  \n\nThe  provincial  government  and  PNP  agree  to  the  Government\u2019s  water  sector \npolicies,  and  the  cost  recovery  principles  and  tariff  reforms  agreed  upon  by  the \nGovernment and ADB. \n\n(vii) \n\nPNPs  have  undertaken  regular  flow  and  quality  measurements  for  the  potential \nsources of water for the town. \n\nThe following Project eligibility criteria must be met before the subproject is submitted to \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  feasibility  study  shows  that  the  subproject  (a)  meets  ADB\u2019s  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  technical,  economic,  financial,  and  institutional  requirements  for \nthe  Project;  and  (b)  does  not  have  significant  negative  social  or  environmental \nimpacts and is Category B according to ADB\u2019s environmental classification. \n\n(ii) \n\nThe subproject does not require significant resettlement or land acquisition. \n\n4. \nADB for approval: \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n \n31\n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\nThe  provincial  government  and  PNP  agree  to  adopt  the  tariff  reforms  agreed \nupon  by  the  Government  and  ADB,  which  include  subproject-specific  tariff, \nprogressive  tariff  structure  with  three  blocks,  designed  to  recover  full  operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  and  30%  of  water  supply  system  capital  costs, \nand a system of deferred payment of connection charges for poor households.  \n\nThe  provincial  government  and  PNP  agree  to  adopt  ADB-approved  sanitation \nregulations in the subproject town. \n\nThe subproject has an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of more than 12%. \n\nThe  subproject  covers  only  the  most  densely  populated  core  villages  and  does \nnot  include  outlying  villages  which,  if  included  in  the  subproject,  would  result  in \nan increase in the calculated overall subproject-specific tariff. \n\nThe  subproject  must  generate  sufficient  revenues  to  meet  full  O&M  costs  and \ncover debt service (i.e. repayment of principal and interest on the subsidiary loan \nfrom  the  Government  to  PNP,  based  on  a  loan  corresponding  to  30%  of  total \ninvestment costs for the water supply system). \n\n(viii)  The  provincial  and  district  governments  agree  to  provide  adequate  budget \nallocations to meet the O&M costs of the subproject\u2019s roads, bridges, drains, and \npublic sanitation facilities.  \n\nThe PNP has already identified potential sources of surface water supply for the \nsubproject  and  has  collected  adequate  stream  flow  and  water  quality  data  for \neach  potential  source \ntreatment \nrequirements.

That  percentage \ntranslates  into  $15  million  grant  for  2005,  based  on  an  overall  program  of  $30  million  for  the \nyear.  It  is  recommended  that  ADB  provide  $10  million  grant  financing  from  the  ADF  IX  Grant \nFacilities for the Project. This appendix gives the rationale and justification for grant financing of \nthe  Project,  the  proposed  grant-financed  activities  are  described  in  paras.  21\u201327  of  the  main \ntext,  the  allocation  of  the  grant  among  the  activities  is  presented  in  Appendix  6,  and  the \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  plan  for  grant-funded  activities  is  described  in  paras.  45\u201348  of  the \nmain text of the report and recommendation of the President. \n \n2. \nAlignment with the Country\u2019s Development and Poverty Reduction Strategies. The \nGovernment\u2019s National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (NGPES, 2004), which aims to \nreduce  poverty  through  strong  economic  growth  and  increased  emphasis  on  the  poorest \ndistricts, identifies health, including water supply and sanitation, as one of four priority sectors \nfor  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  several  development  priorities  set  in  the \nNGPES,  including  (i)  increasing  access  to  clean  water,  (ii)  increasing  use  of  hygienic  latrines, \nand (iii) controlling acute diarrheal diseases/cholera and intestinal parasites. The National Fifth \nFive-Year Socioeconomic Plan (2001\u20132005) prioritizes the development of basic infrastructure \nand services in urban areas throughout the country to accelerate broad-based economic growth. \nThe Government\u2019s water supply sector goal is to provide 24-hour daily access to safe drinking \nwater for 80% of the urban population by the year 2020. The Project will assist the Government \nin  achieving  the  goal  by  providing  investment  support  to  constructing  and  improving  water \nsupply  systems  and  associated  urban  infrastructure  in  about  12  small  towns  identified  as  top \npriority in the sector investment plan. \n \nPartnership  Agreement  on  Poverty  Reduction  (PAPR)  and  Country  Strategy \n3. \nUpdates  (CSPUs). The Government of the Lao PDR signed a PAPR in September 2001. The \nPAPR  and  CSPUs  identified  and  confirmed  water  supply  and  sanitation  as  a  key  operational \npriority for inclusive human resources development and small town development for enhancing \nreciprocal  linkages  between  urban  and  rural  areas.  As  reflected  in  the  CSPUs,  ADB\u2019s \nassistance in the water supply and sanitation sector has been evolving from project-specific to \nsector-wide  interventions  that  aim  to  improve  efficiency,  predictability,  transparency,  and \naccountability in key institutions responsible for delivering services; and reduce poverty through \nequitable access to basic social services.  \n \n4. \nWater Supply as Basic Human Needs and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \nAccess to safe water is a fundamental human need and, therefore, a basic human right. Lack of \nclean water jeopardizes both the physical and social health of people. It is an affront to human \ndignity. The Project targets reduction of human poverty by improving access to clean water by \nthe urban poor, particularly vulnerable groups consisting of women and children. The Project will \nassist  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to  achieve  MDGs  4,  6,  and  7\u2014reducing  child  mortality, \ncombating malaria and other diseases, and halving the proportion of people without sustainable \naccess to safe drinking water\u2014and will contribute directly to the millennium development targets \n5, 8, and 10.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004. ADF IX Donors\u2019 Report: Development Effectiveness for Poverty Reduction. Manila. \n\n\f \n36 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nPoverty Impacts. About 8 of 12 candidate subprojects are in the northern region, which \n5. \nhas been largely overloaded by past development efforts and has the highest poverty incidence \nof about 52%. Because of the high levels of sickness in poor households and the consequently \ndisproportionately high expenditure on health care, the poor will gain most from the water supply \nand  health  promotion  activities  of  the  Project.  Of  187,000  project  beneficiaries  in  2010,  about \n27,000  urban  poor  are  expected  to  benefit  directly  from  the  water  supply  services  and  health \npromotion  activities  of  the  Project  and  about  49,000  rural  poor  are  expected  to  benefit  from \nbetter access to urban markets and social services provided in the project towns.  \n \n6. \nSector Investment Demand versus the Government\u2019s Fiscal Situation. The updated \nsector  investment  plan  shows  that  there  are  still  97  small  towns  without  proper  water  supply \nservice. To meet the Government sector development target, a total investment of $267 million, \nincluding  $103  million  for  small  towns,  will  be  needed.  This  demand  is  well  beyond  the \nGovernment's  fiscal capacity.  The Government  recorded  a  budget  deficit  of  7.8% of  the  gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  in  2003,  which  was  financed  mostly  by  external  confessionals  loans \nand  grants,  and  the  capital  expenditure  for  all  the  sectors  across  the  country  was  only  about \n$170 million in 2002. As of 2003, the Government\u2019s external debt stood at around $3.0 billion, or \nabout 170% of the GDP.   \n \n7. \nThe  Government\u2019s  Strong  Commitment.  Despite  its  very  difficult  fiscal  situation,  the \nGovernment has invested about $149.9 million in the water supply and sanitation sector since \n1963, with some $134.3 million being invested since 1986. The Government initiated in 1999 a \nseries  of  significant  reforms  featuring  decentralization  and  creation  of  a  sound  institutional \nframework for the sector. Since then, the Government has devoted itself to strengthening sector \nregulation,  building  institutional  capacity,  and  mobilizing  resources  for  the  sector.  Approval  of \nthe Prime Minister\u2019s Decree on Regulation of Urban Water Supply Operations, establishment of \nthe WASA regulatory committee, agreement to the financial and tariff reforms and institutional \nstrengthening  recommendations  under \nfrom \nOrganization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  funds  to  cofinance  the  Project \ndemonstrate the Government\u2019s extended strong commitment to the sector. \n \n\nthe  Project,  and \n\nthe  decision \n\nto  borrow \n\n\fIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n\n2005\n3\n4\n\n2006\n2\n\n1\n\n3 4\n\n1\n\n2007\n2 3 4\n\n2008\n2\n3\n\n1\n\n2009\n2\n3\n\n4\n\n1\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2010\n2 3\n\n4\n\nComponent/Activity\n\nA.

The  Northern  Region  is  the  focus  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  country  strategy.  The  region \nhas the highest incidence of poverty at 52% in 2003 and 25 of the nation\u2019s 47 poor districts officially identified by the \nGovernment of Lao PDR (the Government) as priority for development. The Central region has a poverty incidence \nof 35% and 16 priority poor districts. The poverty reduction partnership agreement (September 2001) between ADB \nand  the  Government  includes  small  towns  development  as  one  of  the  key  operational  priorities  to  enhance \nreciprocal  linkages  between  urban  and  rural  areas.  Specifically,  the  agreement  highlights  (i)  integrating  rural \nproducers  with  urban  markets,  (ii)  enabling  urban  entrepreneurs  to  trade  with  rural  people,  and  (iii)  facilitating \naccess of the rural and urban population to international markets.  \n \nProvincial  and  district  towns  with  populations  of  2,000\u201320,000  are  classified  as  small  towns.  Most  of  them  do  not \nhave  piped  water  supply  with  house  connections,  and  often  lack  essential  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  The \nimpact of poor environmental conditions (i.e., unclean water, lack of proper sanitation, and few all-weather access \nroads)  is  greater  on  the  urban  poor.  The  Project  will  contribute  toward  the  achievement  of  the  millennium \ndevelopment goals in the Lao PDR. It will specifically address target 10\u2014to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people \nwithout  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  The  Project  also  supports  Government  Decision  37/PM, \nManagement and Development of the Water Supply Sector (1999). \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nB. Poverty Analysis  \nThe  Lao  PDR  has  a  total  population  of  about  5.7  million  with  a  population  density  of  about  25  persons/km2. \nCompared  with  its  neighboring  countries,  the  Lao  PDR  has  one  of  the  highest  population  growth  rates  at  2.5% \nper  year.  By  2020,  the  population  is  projected  to  reach  8.2  million  people.  About  80%  of  the  population  live  in \nnearly 12,000 small rural villages scattered throughout the country and 20% are urban residents in 145 officially \ndesignated urban centers in 142 districts. While the Lao PDR remains essentially a rural country, urban centers \nare playing an increasing role in its economy. The country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average \nannual  rate  of  6.4%  during  1993-2002.  The  GDP  per  capita  in  2003  was  about  $330.  The  industry  sector \nexperienced the highest growth of about 10.5% per year. The growth rate of the urban population has increased \nnearly twice as fast as the national average. \n \nThere has been consistent improvement in most socioeconomic indicators over the past few years. The country has \nexperienced a sharp reduction in poverty incidence in the past 10 years: from 45% in 1992/93, to 32% in 2002/03. \nThis reduction has been associated with strong economic growth, achievement of rice self-sufficiency and increased \ncross-border trade. However, the Lao PDR remains the least developed, as it ranks as 135 among 177 countries in \nthe  United  Nations  Development  Programme  2004  Human  Development  Report.  Economic  development  remains \nimbalanced  throughout  Lao  PDR,  with  marginal  improvements  witnessed  in  the  Northern  Region.  The  Northern \nRegion has the highest incidence of poverty and faces the greatest challenges due to (i) environmental degradation; \n(ii)  poor  physical  and  social  infrastructure;  (iii)  geographical  remoteness;  and  (iv)  limited  access  to  markets, \ninformation, economic growth opportunities, and quality social services.  \n \nWater  supply  and  environmental  improvements  are  important  in  controlling  disease  outbreaks  and  epidemics \nassociated  with  safe  and  clean  water  supply  and  proper  sanitation  and  hygiene.  Overall  coverage  of  piped  water \nsupply  in  small  towns  is  about  17%  compared  with  69%  in  Vientiane  and  the  four  largest  secondary  towns.  More \nthan 50% of households in small towns do not have any form of water-sealed toilets and less than 10% of primary \nschools  have  latrines.  Limited  access  of  the  poor  to  roads  in  the  wet  season  hinders  their  access  to  schools, \nmarkets, and health facilities.  \n \nThe Project will benefit about 89,000 small town residents by 2010 and about 100,000 by 2015 in about 12 towns. \nBy  2010,  an  additional  98,000  rural  residents  in  surrounding  areas  will  indirectly  benefit  from  improved  access  to \nurban  markets  and  government  services.  About  76,000  beneficiaries  (or  40%)  are  estimated  to  be  poor  in  2010. \nProject  components  include  (i)  institutional  capacity  building  for  Water  Supply  Authority  (WASA)  and  the  Water \nSector  Division  of  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Planning,  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Posts  and \nConstruction  (DHUP/MCTPC);  (ii)  development  of  a  water  supply  system;  (iii)  road,  drain,  and  sanitation \nimprovements;  (iv)  participation,  awareness,  and  community  actions  (PACA);  and  (v)  project  implementation \nassistance to different levels of the government, including District Offices of Communication, Transport, Posts and \nConstruction  (OCTPCs)  and the  district  branches  of  the  provincial  nam  papas  (PNPs). The  PACA  component  will \nsupport  ongoing  efforts  about  hygiene  and  proper  lifestyle,  and  will  coordinate  with  ongoing  health  information, \neducation, and communication (IEC) campaigns.  \n\n\f \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n43\n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  to  help  identify  the  key  project  stakeholders  and  their  interests.  Primary \nstakeholders include residents in urban areas, resettlement-affected people, WASA, WSD of DHUP/MCTPC, district \nbranches  of  the  PNPs,  OCTPCs,  and  the  project  management  unit.  Secondary  stakeholders  include  the  principal \nand district governments, DCTPCs, mass organizations, and relevant line agencies. The stakeholder analysis was \nhelpful during stakeholder consultations for the three sample subprojects. \n \nThe  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy  (NGPES,  2004)  calls  for  increased  participation  by  local \npeople  in  program  planning  and  implementation.  Prime  Minister  (PM)  Instruction  001  (March  2000)  and  PM \nInstruction 010 (June 2001) are relevant to the Government\u2019s approach to poverty reduction\u2014Instruction 010 gives \nan  official  definition  of  poverty,  and  Instruction  001  redefines  central-local  relations.  While  provinces  are  strategic \nplanning units, districts are project planning and budgetary units, and villages are the implementation units that are \nresponsible  for  collecting  revenue  based  on  production  and  data  collection.  The  Lao  Government\u2019s  policy \ndocument1 on governance issues also supports the importance of people\u2019s participation. \n\n   No \n\n   Yes               \n\n \nIndividual  subcomponents  for  each  project  town  were  identified  through  public  consultations,  workshops,  and \nmeetings  with  different  stakeholders.  During  project  design,  community  meetings  were  held  with  beneficiaries  to \ndiscuss  flooding,  sanitation,  poverty,  resettlement,  affordability  issues,  and  environmental  concerns.  Consultations \nwith  communities  and  beneficiaries  revealed  challenges,  strategies,  and  solutions  for  project  design  and \nimplementation. Socioeconomic surveys obtained information and individual views on current situations and future \npreferences.  Similar  surveys,  including  inventory  of  loss  surveys,  were  conducted  among  resettlement-affected \npopulations.  Special  consultations  were  held  with  poor  and  vulnerable  households,  including  households  with \nfemale heads. Key stakeholder input and feedback in project design helped the Project evolve to its current state.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA participation strategy was prepared to take into consideration different levels of cooperation and collaboration of \nstakeholders.  Levels  of  participation  include  information  exchange,  consultation,  collaboration,  review,  and \ncomments  on  reports.  Various  forms  of  communications\u2014weekly  meetings,  workshops,  reviews,  consultation \nmeetings,  technical  work  groups,  and  planning  groups\u2014were  used  to  ensure  active  participation,  project  support, \nand productive feedback. Steps for stakeholder participation and consultation have been integrated into the overall \nproject design and individual social plans.  \n \nThe  Project  supports  community-based  public  services  that  will  allow  greater  village  participation  in  the  planning \nprocess  to  better  respond  to  local  needs.  The  project  component  PACA  gives  communities  information  on  health \nand sanitation  issues. Women\u2019s participation  will be important, as they are often responsible for family health and \nhygiene.  PACA  also  generates  awareness,  facilitates  community  participation  and  consultation  with  OCTPCs  and \nPNPs, and encourages community environmental and sanitation improvements. For instance, the PNP distribution \nsupervisors will be an important link between the district branch of the PNP and communities. Playing a caretaker \nrole,  each  will  be  responsible  for  a  service  area  of  about  500  connections.  The  supervisors  will  manage  and \nmaintain the system in their designated area, address complaints, interface  with  water supply and sanitation units \nand act as the public face of the PNP in their service area. Having detailed information on the water and sanitation \nfacilities of all their customers, the supervisors will help to improve their sanitation facilities, provide technical advice, \nand monitor sanitation conditions. A similar arrangement will be set up by OCTPC to help manage and monitor the \nconditions of the roads and drainage network. \nD.  Gender Development \n\nLao  women  play  important  roles  in  agriculture  and  other  economic  activities,  and  are  responsible  for  a  variety  of \ntasks related to water, sanitation and hygiene in their families and within the communities. For instance, women and \nchildren are often responsible for collecting water often from distant sources. In the three sample subprojects, they \nrely  on  open  wells,  nearby  rivers,  and  bore  wells  for  domestic  water  supply.  Unsafe  water  (i.e.,  high  in  iron  or \ncalcium  deposits  or  contaminated  with  wastewater)  adversely  impacts  the  health  of  individuals  and  families  (e.g., \nwater-related  diseases  and  reproductive  health  problems).  Upgrading  roads  will  improve  women\u2019s  access  to \nmarkets, extension and social services, and information. Public toilet facilities at schools will provide more privacy \nfor girls attending school, and will positively influence enrollment rates. At present, less than 10% of primary schools \nhave latrines. Institutionally, women are active in the Water Supply Division of DHUP/MCTPC, Lao Women\u2019s Union, \nand in OCTPCs and PNPs at the district levels. A gender strategy has been prepared for the Project (Appendix 12).  \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n                                                 \n1   Government  of  the  Lao  PDR.  2003.

Specifically,  the  agreement  highlights  (i)  integrating  rural \nproducers  with  urban  markets,  (ii)  enabling  urban  entrepreneurs  to  trade  with  rural  people,  and  (iii)  facilitating \naccess of the rural and urban population to international markets.  \n \nProvincial  and  district  towns  with  populations  of  2,000\u201320,000  are  classified  as  small  towns.  Most  of  them  do  not \nhave  piped  water  supply  with  house  connections,  and  often  lack  essential  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  The \nimpact of poor environmental conditions (i.e., unclean water, lack of proper sanitation, and few all-weather access \nroads)  is  greater  on  the  urban  poor.  The  Project  will  contribute  toward  the  achievement  of  the  millennium \ndevelopment goals in the Lao PDR. It will specifically address target 10\u2014to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people \nwithout  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water.  The  Project  also  supports  Government  Decision  37/PM, \nManagement and Development of the Water Supply Sector (1999). \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nB. Poverty Analysis  \nThe  Lao  PDR  has  a  total  population  of  about  5.7  million  with  a  population  density  of  about  25  persons/km2. \nCompared  with  its  neighboring  countries,  the  Lao  PDR  has  one  of  the  highest  population  growth  rates  at  2.5% \nper  year.  By  2020,  the  population  is  projected  to  reach  8.2  million  people.  About  80%  of  the  population  live  in \nnearly 12,000 small rural villages scattered throughout the country and 20% are urban residents in 145 officially \ndesignated urban centers in 142 districts. While the Lao PDR remains essentially a rural country, urban centers \nare playing an increasing role in its economy. The country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average \nannual  rate  of  6.4%  during  1993-2002.  The  GDP  per  capita  in  2003  was  about  $330.  The  industry  sector \nexperienced the highest growth of about 10.5% per year. The growth rate of the urban population has increased \nnearly twice as fast as the national average. \n \nThere has been consistent improvement in most socioeconomic indicators over the past few years. The country has \nexperienced a sharp reduction in poverty incidence in the past 10 years: from 45% in 1992/93, to 32% in 2002/03. \nThis reduction has been associated with strong economic growth, achievement of rice self-sufficiency and increased \ncross-border trade. However, the Lao PDR remains the least developed, as it ranks as 135 among 177 countries in \nthe  United  Nations  Development  Programme  2004  Human  Development  Report.  Economic  development  remains \nimbalanced  throughout  Lao  PDR,  with  marginal  improvements  witnessed  in  the  Northern  Region.  The  Northern \nRegion has the highest incidence of poverty and faces the greatest challenges due to (i) environmental degradation; \n(ii)  poor  physical  and  social  infrastructure;  (iii)  geographical  remoteness;  and  (iv)  limited  access  to  markets, \ninformation, economic growth opportunities, and quality social services.  \n \nWater  supply  and  environmental  improvements  are  important  in  controlling  disease  outbreaks  and  epidemics \nassociated  with  safe  and  clean  water  supply  and  proper  sanitation  and  hygiene.  Overall  coverage  of  piped  water \nsupply  in  small  towns  is  about  17%  compared  with  69%  in  Vientiane  and  the  four  largest  secondary  towns.  More \nthan 50% of households in small towns do not have any form of water-sealed toilets and less than 10% of primary \nschools  have  latrines.  Limited  access  of  the  poor  to  roads  in  the  wet  season  hinders  their  access  to  schools, \nmarkets, and health facilities.  \n \nThe Project will benefit about 89,000 small town residents by 2010 and about 100,000 by 2015 in about 12 towns. \nBy  2010,  an  additional  98,000  rural  residents  in  surrounding  areas  will  indirectly  benefit  from  improved  access  to \nurban  markets  and  government  services.  About  76,000  beneficiaries  (or  40%)  are  estimated  to  be  poor  in  2010. \nProject  components  include  (i)  institutional  capacity  building  for  Water  Supply  Authority  (WASA)  and  the  Water \nSector  Division  of  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Planning,  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Posts  and \nConstruction  (DHUP/MCTPC);  (ii)  development  of  a  water  supply  system;  (iii)  road,  drain,  and  sanitation \nimprovements;  (iv)  participation,  awareness,  and  community  actions  (PACA);  and  (v)  project  implementation \nassistance to different levels of the government, including District Offices of Communication, Transport, Posts and \nConstruction  (OCTPCs)  and the  district  branches  of  the  provincial  nam  papas  (PNPs). The  PACA  component  will \nsupport  ongoing  efforts  about  hygiene  and  proper  lifestyle,  and  will  coordinate  with  ongoing  health  information, \neducation, and communication (IEC) campaigns.  \n\n\f \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n43\n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA  stakeholder  analysis  was  conducted  to  help  identify  the  key  project  stakeholders  and  their  interests.  Primary \nstakeholders include residents in urban areas, resettlement-affected people, WASA, WSD of DHUP/MCTPC, district \nbranches  of  the  PNPs,  OCTPCs,  and  the  project  management  unit.  Secondary  stakeholders  include  the  principal \nand district governments, DCTPCs, mass organizations, and relevant line agencies. The stakeholder analysis was \nhelpful during stakeholder consultations for the three sample subprojects. \n \nThe  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy  (NGPES,  2004)  calls  for  increased  participation  by  local \npeople  in  program  planning  and  implementation.  Prime  Minister  (PM)  Instruction  001  (March  2000)  and  PM \nInstruction 010 (June 2001) are relevant to the Government\u2019s approach to poverty reduction\u2014Instruction 010 gives \nan  official  definition  of  poverty,  and  Instruction  001  redefines  central-local  relations.  While  provinces  are  strategic \nplanning units, districts are project planning and budgetary units, and villages are the implementation units that are \nresponsible  for  collecting  revenue  based  on  production  and  data  collection.  The  Lao  Government\u2019s  policy \ndocument1 on governance issues also supports the importance of people\u2019s participation. \n\n   No \n\n   Yes               \n\n \nIndividual  subcomponents  for  each  project  town  were  identified  through  public  consultations,  workshops,  and \nmeetings  with  different  stakeholders.  During  project  design,  community  meetings  were  held  with  beneficiaries  to \ndiscuss  flooding,  sanitation,  poverty,  resettlement,  affordability  issues,  and  environmental  concerns.  Consultations \nwith  communities  and  beneficiaries  revealed  challenges,  strategies,  and  solutions  for  project  design  and \nimplementation. Socioeconomic surveys obtained information and individual views on current situations and future \npreferences.  Similar  surveys,  including  inventory  of  loss  surveys,  were  conducted  among  resettlement-affected \npopulations.  Special  consultations  were  held  with  poor  and  vulnerable  households,  including  households  with \nfemale heads. Key stakeholder input and feedback in project design helped the Project evolve to its current state.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA participation strategy was prepared to take into consideration different levels of cooperation and collaboration of \nstakeholders.  Levels  of  participation  include  information  exchange,  consultation,  collaboration,  review,  and \ncomments  on  reports.  Various  forms  of  communications\u2014weekly  meetings,  workshops,  reviews,  consultation \nmeetings,  technical  work  groups,  and  planning  groups\u2014were  used  to  ensure  active  participation,  project  support, \nand productive feedback. Steps for stakeholder participation and consultation have been integrated into the overall \nproject design and individual social plans.  \n \nThe  Project  supports  community-based  public  services  that  will  allow  greater  village  participation  in  the  planning \nprocess  to  better  respond  to  local  needs.  The  project  component  PACA  gives  communities  information  on  health \nand sanitation  issues. Women\u2019s participation  will be important, as they are often responsible for family health and \nhygiene.  PACA  also  generates  awareness,  facilitates  community  participation  and  consultation  with  OCTPCs  and \nPNPs, and encourages community environmental and sanitation improvements. For instance, the PNP distribution \nsupervisors will be an important link between the district branch of the PNP and communities. Playing a caretaker \nrole,  each  will  be  responsible  for  a  service  area  of  about  500  connections.  The  supervisors  will  manage  and \nmaintain the system in their designated area, address complaints, interface  with  water supply and sanitation units \nand act as the public face of the PNP in their service area. Having detailed information on the water and sanitation \nfacilities of all their customers, the supervisors will help to improve their sanitation facilities, provide technical advice, \nand monitor sanitation conditions. A similar arrangement will be set up by OCTPC to help manage and monitor the \nconditions of the roads and drainage network. \nD.  Gender Development \n\nLao  women  play  important  roles  in  agriculture  and  other  economic  activities,  and  are  responsible  for  a  variety  of \ntasks related to water, sanitation and hygiene in their families and within the communities. For instance, women and \nchildren are often responsible for collecting water often from distant sources. In the three sample subprojects, they \nrely  on  open  wells,  nearby  rivers,  and  bore  wells  for  domestic  water  supply.  Unsafe  water  (i.e.,  high  in  iron  or \ncalcium  deposits  or  contaminated  with  wastewater)  adversely  impacts  the  health  of  individuals  and  families  (e.g., \nwater-related  diseases  and  reproductive  health  problems).  Upgrading  roads  will  improve  women\u2019s  access  to \nmarkets, extension and social services, and information. Public toilet facilities at schools will provide more privacy \nfor girls attending school, and will positively influence enrollment rates. At present, less than 10% of primary schools \nhave latrines. Institutionally, women are active in the Water Supply Division of DHUP/MCTPC, Lao Women\u2019s Union, \nand in OCTPCs and PNPs at the district levels. A gender strategy has been prepared for the Project (Appendix 12).  \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n                                                 \n1   Government  of  the  Lao  PDR.  2003.

Social Safeguards and other Social Risks \n\nItem \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\nFor  each  subproject  town,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nimpacts  must  be  Category  B  or  not  significant,  as  per  the \nProject\u2019s  eligibility  criteria.  A  resettlement  framework  for  the \nProject, and a short resettlement plan for Muong Houn, Muong \nNan, and Kenethao subprojects have been prepared according \nto  Lao  PDR  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement.  \n\nIssues  pertaining  to  affordability  are  not  expected  to  arise  in \nthe  Project.  The  Project  will  support  a  project-specific \nprogressive  tariff  based  on  three  blocks  of  consumption\u2014\nlifeline, average, and above-average consumption. The lifeline \nblock  and  a  deferred  payment  system  for  connection  charge, \nwhich  allows  poor  households  to  pay  the  charge  over  24 \nmonths free of interest, will benefit the poor by increasing their \naccess to project benefits.  \n\nLabor is not a potential issue. The Project helps to strengthen \nthe  current  capacity  of  the  water  supply  authority  and  water \nsupply  division  within  DHUP/MCTPC.  Local  employment \nthe  project  during \nopportunities  will  be  generated  by \nconstruction, \nproject \nof \noperation \ncomponents.  Women  and  ethnic  minorities  will  not  be \ndiscriminated  against,  and  will  have  equal  access \nto \nemployment opportunities. About 30% of all jobs generated by \nthe  village \ncommunity-based \nenvironmental improvement component) will be for women. \n\nand  maintenance \n\ninitiatives \n\nthrough \n\n(e.g., \n\nThe  Lao  PDR  is  home  to  46  ethnic  groups,  which  can  be \nclassified  into  three  broad  groups\u2014Lao  Loum  (majority),  Lao \nTheung, and Lao Soung. The population in the project area is \nabout  78%  Lao  Loum,  9%  Lao  Theung,  and  14%  Lao  Soung. \nThe Project is expected to have minimum adverse impacts on \nethnic  groups  of  Lao  Theung  and  Lao  Soung  (Category  B). \nNevertheless,  an  ethnic  groups  development  framework  has \nbeen prepared\u2014according to Lao Government regulations and \nADB\u2019s  indigenous  peoples  policy\u2014to  help  assess  potential \nimpacts on all ethnic groups during feasibility studies.  \n\nThe increased risk to HIV/AIDS2 due to the Project is minimal. \nTo  keep  risks  low,  the  Project  will  (i)  collaborate  with  the \ndepartment  of  health  at  the  district  level  to  provide  links  or \nreferrals  to  ongoing  HIV/AIDS  awareness  efforts,  and  (ii) \nrequire  contractors \ninformation \namong their laborers. \n\nto  disseminate  HIV/AIDS \n\nPlan \nRequired \n\n Full \n Short \n None \n\n Yes \n  No \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\n Yes \n  No  \n\nResettlement \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nAffordability \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nLabor \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n\n Significant \n Not significant \n None \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n45\n\n \n\n \n\nGENDER STRATEGY \n\n1. \nA gender strategy is prepared for the Northern and Central Region\u2019s Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector Project in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The purpose of \nthe gender strategy is to suggest specific actions that should be considered during subproject \ndesign and implementation to make the Project more responsive to women\u2019s water supply and \nutilization needs. Some measures will help increase women\u2019s access to affordable piped water \nsupply, health and hygiene information, and urban infrastructure, and others have the potential \nto enhance their living conditions. Female heads of households affected by land acquisition and \nresettlement, are eligible for entitlements the same as those for male heads of households. These \nentitlements and specific measures for vulnerable groups are included in the project\u2019s resettlement \nframework and individual resettlement plans.  \n \nThe  gender  strategy  is  based  on  (i)  the  three  sample  subprojects  (Muong  Houn,  Muong \n2. \nNan, and Kenethao) that have been studied for feasibility in phase I; (ii) reconnaissance surveys \nand district-level information data sheets; and (iii) consultations with women of different ages and \nethnic groups, government officials, and mass organizations. The gender strategy is based on Lao \nPDR regulations and the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Policy on gender and development.1\n \nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n3. \nThe Project will benefit about 89,000 small town residents by 2010 and about 100,000 \nby 2015 in about 12 towns. By 2010, an additional 98,000 rural residents in surrounding areas \nwill  indirectly  benefit  from  improved  access  to urban  markets  and  government  services.  Of  an \nestimated  187,000  beneficiaries  (2010),  about  76,000  people  (or  40%)  will  be  poor.2 \nPercentages  of  females  per  candidate  subproject  town  are  in  Appendix  13,  Table  A13.2.  The \nProject  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  enhance  the  small  towns\u2019  roles  as  market, \nservices, and manufacturing centers supporting the rural hinterland. It will provide safe, reliable, \nand  affordable  piped  water  supply,  essential  urban  infrastructure,  and  village  environmental \nimprovements (VEI) in about 12 small district towns in the Northern and Central Regions. The \nProject  will  also  strengthen  water  sector  regulation,  policy  development,  and  sector \nsustainability by supporting the regulating authority and promoting policy, tariff, and institutional \nreform. It has a strong community participation focus that complements the Project\u2019s objectives \nof reducing poverty, and promoting health and hygiene within communities. The project design \nencourages a demand-based approach.   \n \nB. \n\n \nWomen in the Lao PDR and the Project Area \n\n4. \nMore  than  85%  of  Lao  women  live  and  work  in  farming  households.  They  perform  the \nbulk of household work with the help of children, particularly girls. Females spend longer hours \n(i)  working  in  upland  agriculture;  (ii)  collecting  natural  and  forestry  products  for  processing, \nconsumption,  and  sale;  (iii)  manufacturing  handicrafts  for  cash  income;  (iv)  raising  small \nlivestock  for  consumption  and  for  cash  income;  and  (v)  collecting  water  for  domestic  use. \nDiscussions with women in Muong Houn, Muong Nan, and Kenethao revealed that women and \nchildren  spend  up  to  2  hours  per  day  collecting  water  from  the  source  due  to  distance, \nfrequency of trips, or long queues. In some cases, while the water point was within 100 meters, \nwaiting in queues took time. \n \n5. \nPoverty  for  females  means  having  a  heavier  work  burden,  poorer  health,  lower \neducation  levels,  less  food,  and  inadequate  rest  compared  with  men.  Access  to  education  is \nlower for school children residing at distances farther from schools. In Muong Nan, about 5% of \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Policy on Gender and Development. Manila. \n2   The number of beneficiaries is estimated, as the socioeconomic analysis is based on data collected from 11 towns. \n\nAs part of a sector project, the towns are subject to change. \n\n\f \n46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n185 household heads interviewed said that female members attained primary education, while \n12% attained lower secondary education. Levels of attainment were lower in Muong Houn, as \nthe  distance  between  villages  was  greater\u20142%  of  132  households  said  female  members \nattained primary education and 2%, lower secondary education.  \n \nDependency  ratios  are  high  for  poor  households.  Membership  in  large  families  is  an \n6. \nindication that family size is part of their coping and survival strategies. In a strong patriarchal \nsociety,  women  have  few  or  no  land  rights,  particularly  among  the  ethnic  communities.  Land \nrights are based on family law, where new land is titled in the husband\u2019s name and is inherited \nby the wife and then children. Joint ownership depends on individual household preference. \n \n7. \nWomen represent about one third of all government employees. While representation in \nleadership  positions  at  all  levels  is  limited,  the  director  and  the  deputy  director  in  the  Water \nSupply  Division  of  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Planning,  MCPTC  (DHUP/MCTPC) \nare  presently  women.  Within  the  district  Offices  of  Communication,  Transport,  Posts  and \nConstruction  (OCTPCs)  and  provincial  nam  papas  (PNPs)  in  the  three  sample  subprojects, \nwomen are found in financial/accounting, and administration positions.  \n \n8. \nPromoting  gender  equality  is  an  important  national  goal  of  the  Lao  PDR.  That  goal  is \nreflected in the National Strategy for the Development of Women (NSDW, 1998\u20132005),3 in the 1991 \nConstitution  (Articles  22  and  24),  and  in  a  number  of  international  commitments.  The  National \nCommission  for  the  Advancement  of  Women-Lao  PDR  (NCAW-Lao)  was  established  in  1991  to \nhelp ensure women\u2019s equal access to basic services and productive resources for achieving equity, \nefficiency, and effectiveness of policies and projects. NCAW-Lao develops the NSDW and reports \ndirectly to the Government, while the Lao Women\u2019s Union helps implement the NSDW. \n \nC. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n9. \nThe Project is in line with the objectives outlined in the NSDW (1998\u20132005). Women will \nbenefit  mostly  through  a  reduction  in  drudgery  and  time  savings  in  water  collection.  The  time \ngained will give women the opportunity to engage in productive activities and/or family affairs. \nMoreover,  women  as  caretakers  of  family  health  and  hygiene,  will  benefit  the  most  from  the \nparticipation,  awareness,  and  community  actions  (PACA)  component.  This  component  will \ncomplement ongoing health and hygiene initiatives within communities, and will coordinate with \nongoing  and  planned  health  information,  education,  and  communication  campaigns  to  which \nmany  women  will  be  accustomed.  For  instance,  the  Ministry  of  Health\u2019s  \u201c3  cleans\u201d  principle \nincludes boiled drinking water, cooked food, and clean hands before eating and after latrine use. \n \nPublic  latrine  facilities  at  schools  in  both  Muong  Nan  and  Kenethao  can  potentially \n10. \nincrease  enrollment  rates  of  the  girl  child  in  both  towns.  Construction  of  latrine  facilities  must \nconsider specific gender needs (e.g., separate facilities for boys and girls).  \n \nIn  Muong  Nan,  construction  of  a  bridge  will  link  two  parts  of  the  town  that  are  often \n11. \nseparated by the Nan River during the wet season. The results will be greater convenience and \ntime savings; better access to markets, schools, health facilities, and temples; reduced physical \nburden and risk to women and children using the temporary bridge crossing; and cost savings \nfrom reconstructing a temporary bridge, which is destroyed by floods every year.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n3   The NSDW (1998\u20132005) aims to (i) reduce women\u2019s heavy work burden, (ii) improve women\u2019s health and overall \ncondition,  and  (iii)  provide  access  to  clean  water  supply.  A  new  strategy  (2005\u20132010)  is  under  preparation  by \nNCAW-Lao. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n47\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nD. \n\nSpecific Actions \n\nThe  following  specific  actions  will  be  implemented  in  each  subproject  town  and  will  be \n\n12. \nrefined as required. New actions will also be considered for inclusion: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nEqual access of women to employment, training and capacity-building opportunities \nin Water Supply Authority (WASA), district branches of PNPs, Water Supply Division \nof  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Planning,  OCTPC,  and  water  supply  and \nsanitation units (WATSANs).  \nRepresentation  for  the  Ministry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Posts  and \nConstruction\u2019s  (MCTPC)  women\u2019s  union  on  behalf  of  customers  in  the  Water \nAuthority Regulatory Committee (as per the WASA Charter). \nRepresentation  for  NCAW-Lao  at  the  national  project  steering  committee,  and \nLao Women\u2019s Union participation in the project implementation units (PIUs). \nPreference for women to fill jobs created by community-based improvements. At \nleast  30%  of  new  jobs  generated  in  the  community  will  be  reserved  for  qualified \nwomen (e.g., operation and maintenance of community-based initiatives of the VEI).  \nEqual access to VEIs, with preferences given to proposals submitted by women. \nSpecial  attention  within  the  community  health  awareness  program  to  women\u2019s \nreproductive health needs as it relates to water and sanitation.  \nAt  least  30%  female  representation  within  community  action  teams  and \nWATSANs.  These  units  will  be  responsible  for  mobilizing  hygiene  campaigns, \nand are expected to have strong female representation and to reflect the ethnic \ncomposition of villages.  \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(viii)  Use  of  nonformal  means  of  education  (i.e.,  radio  and  other  media)  for  health \neducation promotion among illiterate men and women, especially youths.  \nConsultations with women before the designs of roads, drainage works, and public \nsanitation facilities are finalized (e.g., separate latrine facilities for men and women). \nFor the safety of small children, some drains may be covered as part of the VEIs.  \nMonitoring project benefits and impacts by collecting gender-disaggregated data \nwhere  the  indicators  provide  meaningful  results.  Records  of  participation  and \nawareness training will also be disaggregated.   \nEqual  compensation  and  allowances  to  female  heads  of  households  as  per  the \nresettlement framework and short resettlement plans. They will be eligible for special \nassistance during land acquisition and resettlement activities, as required. \n\n(xi) \n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nImplementation  arrangements  and  estimated  costs  of  the  gender  strategy  have  been \n13. \nintegrated  into  the  overall  arrangements  and  total  budget  of  the  Project.  The  PIUs  will \nimplement  the  gender  strategy.  Representatives  from  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  and  the  Lao \nFront for National Construction will play important roles in facilitating participation by women and \nethnic  groups  in  project  activities.  An  international  resettlement/social  specialist  (7  person-\nmonths),  a  national  resettlement/social  specialist  (14  person-months),  and  a  national \nsocial/gender  specialist  (6  person-months)  will  help  develop  implementation  guidelines  for  the \ngender strategy, specific to each subproject town. They will work with the PIUs in establishing \ngender-disaggregated  indicators  for  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and \ncoordinate  with  other  specialists  in  implementing  subprojects  and  preparing  feasibility  studies. \nProgress  reports  from  the  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  will  provide  periodic  updates  on  the \neffect  of  the  project  components  by  gender.  The  midterm  review  mission  will  consider  past \nupdates and make adjustments, as required. \n\n\f \n48 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nETHNIC GROUPS DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nProject Description \n\nAn  ethnic  groups1  development  framework  (EGDF)  is  prepared  for  the  Northern  and \n1. \nCentral  Regions  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic  (Lao  PDR).  The  purpose  of  the  EGDF  is  (i)  to  guide  the  assessment  of  potential \nimpacts on ethnic groups during the feasibility study for each candidate subproject town; and (ii) \nto  assist  in  preparing  an  ethnic  groups  development  plan,  if  necessary.  The  Project  aims  to \nincrease access of the general population to affordable piped water supply, health and hygiene \ninformation, and urban infrastructure. All ethnic groups who are affected by land acquisition and \nresettlement  (LAR)  are  eligible  for  the  same  entitlements,  regardless  of  ethnicity.  General \nentitlements  and  specific  measures  for  vulnerable  groups  are  included  in  the  project\u2019s \nresettlement framework and short resettlement plans.  \n \n2. \nThe  EGDF  is  based  on  (i)  the  three  sample  subprojects  (Kenethao,  Muong  Houn,  and \nMuong  Nan)  that  were  prepared  for  feasibility  in  phase  I;  (ii)  reconnaissance  surveys  and \ndistrict-level  information  data  sheets;  and  (iii)  consultations  with  ethnic  groups,  government \nofficials,  and  local  mass  organizations.  The  EGDF  is  based  on  current  Lao  PDR  regulations, \nand complies with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) indigenous peoples policy.2  \n \nA. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 89,000 small town residents by 2010 and about 100,000 in \n3. \nabout 12 towns by 2015. An additional 98,000 rural residents in surrounding areas will indirectly \nbenefit  by  2010  from  improved  access  to  urban  markets  and  government  services.  Of  an \nestimated  187,000  beneficiaries  (2010),  about  76,000  people  (or  40%)  are  considered  poor.3 \nThe  Project  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  enhance  small  towns\u2019  roles  as  market, \nservices, and manufacturing centers supporting the rural hinterland. It will provide safe, reliable \nand  affordable  piped  water  supply,  essential  urban  infrastructure,  and  village  environmental \nimprovements (VEI) in about 12 small district towns4 in the Northern and Central Regions. The \nProject will also strengthen water sector regulation, policy development and sector sustainability \nby supporting the regulating authority and promoting policy, tariff, and institutional reform. The \nProject\u2019s  strong  focus  on  community  participation  complements  the  project  objectives  of \nreducing  poverty,  and  promoting  health  and  hygiene  within  communities.  As  a  sector  project, \nthe design of the Project encourages a demand-based approach. \n \nB. \n \nThe Lao PDR covers a land area of about 250,000 square meter, and is home to about \n4. \n5.7 million people. It has officially 46 ethnic groups that live mainly in the northern parts near the \nborders with Thailand, Myanmar, People\u2019s Republic of China, and Viet Nam. According to Lao \nGovernment  classification,  ethnic  groups  can  be  divided  into  three  broad  groups,  based  on \nprototypical location: (i) Lao Loum, who tend to settle in the valleys and flatlands (68%); (ii) Lao \nTheung,  who  tend  to  inhabit  the  mid-level  slopes  (22%);  and  (iii)  Lao  Soung,  who  prefer  the \nhigher  altitudes  (10%).  Table  A13.1  shows  the  classification  of  ethnic  groups  in  the  Project, \ncompared  with  the  official  list  in  the  Lao  PDR.  Although  the  Lao  PDR  does  not  differentiate \n                                                 \n1   At the time of project preparation, Lao Theung and Lao Soung were identified as the relevant ethnic groups for this \nframework,  as  required  by  ADB\u2019s  indigenous  peoples  policy.  Additional  ethnic  groups  may  be  identified  during \nproject implementation. \n\nEthnic Groups in the Lao PDR and Project Area \n\n2  ADB. 1998. Policy on Indigenous Peoples.

Lao Soung tend to \nbe  poorer  than  the  other  groups  due  to  (i)  geographical  remoteness;  (ii)  lack  of  farming \nknowledge  and  skills,  including  veterinary  services;  (iii)  limited  access  to  cash  and  credit;  (iv) \nenvironmental problems; and (iv) poor physical and social infrastructure. The Hmong and Yao \npeople tend to be the poorest of all ethnic groups, followed by the Khmou and the Tai people.  \n \n6. \nThe following conditions can increase the risk of marginalization for any ethnic group: (i) \nlanguage  differences  make  it  difficult  for  ethnic  groups  to  communicate  with  one  another;  (ii) \ntraditional  cultivation  practices  (i.e.,  shifting  cultivation)  are  not  considered  environmentally \nsustainable;  and  (iii)  geographical  remoteness  limits  access  to  information,  technology,  quality \nsocial  services,  and \nthe \ndevelopment of ethnic women, with the following impacts: (i) they have higher levels of illiteracy, \n(ii) they lack access to training for improved agricultural techniques, (iii) they participate less in \nnon-agricultural work, and (iv) their mobility and interactions with others are limited.  \n \n\nincome-generating  opportunities.  Those  conditions  also \n\nlimit \n\n                                                 \n5   Resolution of the Party Central Organization Concerning Ethnic Minority Affairs in the New Era (1992). \n\n\f \n50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nLegal Framework and Principles \n\nC. \n \n7. \nThe  EGDF  for  the  Project  is  based  on  Lao  PDR  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  indigenous  peoples \npolicy  (footnote  2).  ADB\u2019s  policy  aims  to  protect  ethnic  groups  from  the  adverse  impacts  of \ndevelopment,  and  to  ensure  that  all  ethnic  groups  benefit  from  development  projects  and \nprograms. ADB\u2019s Operations Manual F3/BP (2004) and Operational Procedures F3/OP (2004) \noutline ADB procedures and operational guidelines.  \n \n8. \nThe  Resolution  of  the  Party  Central  Organization  Concerning  Ethnic  Minority  Affairs  in \nthe  New  Era  (1991)  mandated  all  government  agencies  to  create  a  targeted  plan  for  the \ndevelopment  of  rural,  mountainous  areas.  The  Department  of  Ethnic  and  Social  Affairs  of  the \nLao Front for National Construction (LFNC) is responsible for coordinating ethnic issues at the \ncentral  Government  level  and  developing  and  implementing  policies  for  ethnic  groups  in \nmountainous regions.  \n \n9. \nRecent laws and decisions reflect the Government\u2019s increasing awareness of the need \nto  incorporate  ethnic  issues  in  the  development  process  in  all  sectors.  The  National  Socio-\nEconomic  Development  Plan  for  2001\u20132005  has  adopted  as  its  objective  the  alleviation  of \npoverty  for  ethnic  groups  in  remote  areas  and  recognition  by  forestry  laws  of  customary  land \nuse rights. The Lao PDR Constitution highlights the right of ethnic groups to protect, preserve, \nand promote their customs and heritage; and prohibits acts of division and discrimination (Article \n8).  The  Draft  Decree  on  Resettlement  and  Compensation  also  recognizes  the  rights  of  ethnic \ngroups with regard to involuntary resettlement (Article 10).  \n \n10. \nDuring  the  preparation  of  feasibility  studies  for  future  subproject  towns,  socioeconomic \nand  demographic  profiles  of  the  subproject  towns  will  be  reviewed  with  respect  to  ethnicity. \nUsing  ADB\u2019s  checklist  on  indigenous  peoples,  the  potential  effects  of  the  Project  on  all  ethnic \ngroups  in  each  candidate  town  will  be  assessed.  If  the  potential  impacts  are  significant,  an \nEGDP  will  be  required  for  each  town  according  to  Lao  Government  regulations,  ADB\u2019s \nindigenous peoples policy, OM F3/BP, and OP F3/OP.  \n \nD. \n \nThe  EGDF  ensures  that  all  ethnic  groups  share  proportionately  in  the  project  benefits \n11. \nand  do  not  experience  adverse  effects  from  the  Project.  Assessment  for  the  three  sample \nsubprojects  reveals  that  the  Project  will  have  limited  adverse  effects  on  ethnic  groups  (as \ndefined  in  footnote  1).  All  ethnic  groups  will  benefit  directly  through  piped  water  supply  and \nimproved  urban  environment  (i.e.,  roads,  drainage,  public  sanitation  facilities).  A  progressive \ntariff  structure  based  on  three  categories  of  consumption  will  make  water  supply  affordable  to \nthe  poor  and  to  ethnic  groups  (Appendix  16).  In  addition,  the  Project  recommends  that \npayments for connections be made in installments for poor households. Poor ethnic households \nwill be equally eligible for these options.  \n \n12. \nIn  Muong  Houn,  Muong  Nan,  and  Kenethao,  LAR  will  affect  an  estimated  175 \nhouseholds (948 affected persons). Of them, 15 affected households are Lao Theung and Lao \nSoung,  and  the  rest  are  Lao  Loum.  Of  about  11  households,  57  persons  that  will  experience \nmajor impacts, 2 are Lao Theung and Lao Soung (Appendix 14).  \n \nE. \n \n13. \nrefined as required.

Representatives  from  the  LFNC \nand  the  Lao  Women\u2019s  Union  will  play  a  critical  role  in  facilitating  participation  by  all  ethnic \ngroups in project activities. An international social/resettlement specialist (7 person-months), a \nnational  resettlement/social  specialist  (14  person-months),  and  a  national  social/gender \nspecialist (6 person-months) will help develop implementation guidelines for the EGDF, specific \nto  each  candidate  subproject  town.  The  specialists  will  work  closely  with  other  specialists  in \nimplementing subprojects and preparing feasibility studies for candidate subproject towns. The \nEGDF will be monitored as part of the overall system for the Project, and socioeconomic data \nwill be disaggregated by ethnicity and by gender. Progress reports will provide periodic updates \non the effect of project components on ethnic groups. The midterm review mission will consider \npast updates and make adjustments, as required. \n\n\f \n52 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK AND SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLANS \n\n1. \nFeasibility studies for Muong Houn, Muong Nan, and Kenethao district town subprojects \nwere completed as part of project preparation. The scope of land acquisition and resettlement \n(LAR) is Category B or not significant in each of the three, as the number of affected persons \n(APs)  experiencing  major  impacts  is  less  than  200.1  A  resettlement  framework  (RF, \nSupplementary  Appendix  I)  was  prepared  to  guide  the  LAR  for  future  subproject  towns  under \nthe  Northern  and  Central  Regions  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project.2  A  short \nresettlement plan (RP)  was also prepared for each of the sample subprojects (Supplementary \nAppendix J). All ethnic groups affected by LAR are eligible for the same entitlements, regardless \nof  ethnicity.  Specific  measures  for  vulnerable  groups,  including  some  ethnic  groups3  and \nhouseholds with female heads, are included in the RF and short RPs. The short RPs and the \nRF were prepared according to regulations of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \nand the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement.4  \n\nTables A14.1 and A14.2 illustrate the estimated scope of LAR for Muong Houn, Muong \n\n2. \nNan, and Kenethao district towns.

Affected structures are made primarily of temporary materials (i.e., bamboo) and are \neasily movable. \n\n4. \nThe subproject in Muong Nan, Luang Prabang Province includes (i) a piped water supply \nsystem, (ii) a bridge over Nan River, (iii) public sanitation facilities, and (iv) upgrading of roads \nwith drains. LAR will severely affect about eight households (36 APs) who will experience major \nimpacts. Of the eight households, one household (five APs) is Lao Soung and the rest are Lao \nLoum. Two households will require relocation and have indicated a preference for self-relocation \nwith assistance. Affected structures are mostly cement slabs in front of homes.   \n \n5. \nThe subproject in Kenethao, Xayaburi Province includes (i) a piped water supply system, \n(ii) earth channel improvement, (iii) public sanitation facilities, and (iv)  upgrading of roads with \ndrains. LAR will severely affect one household (one AP), which will experience major impacts. \nNo households are expected to be relocated. Land acquired for drainage work is  minor, while \nland for roads with drains will affect mainly cement slabs in front of households with shops.  \n\nA. \n\nLegal Framework, Project Principles, and Entitlements \n\nThe policy framework and entitlements have been built on the laws of the Government of \n6. \nthe  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  principally  the  Constitution  (1991)  and  the \nLand  Law  (1997,  2003),  the  Road  Law  (1999),  the  draft  National  Policy  and  Decree  for \nResettlement  and  Compensation,5  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement (1995), and the Government-approved RPs for other ADB projects. The provisions \nand  principles  adopted  in  the  RF  and  short  RPs  will  supersede  the  provisions  of  relevant \ndecrees currently in force in the Lao PDR wherever a gap exists between Lao PDR regulations \nand ADB policy. Key principles adopted for the Project are in the RF and short RPs. \n\nThe  project  entitlements  will  provide  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  for \n7. \nlost assets; and restore or enhance the livelihood of all categories of APs (directly and indirectly \naffected,  holders  and  nonholders  of  such  as  Form  01).6  An  entitlement  matrix  for  the  Project \nwas prepared and is found in the RF and individual short RPs. Identification cards will be issued \nto  APs  before  compensating  them  and  taking  possession  of  their  assets.  Replacement  costs \nand rates have been established based on a rapid assessment using district estimates and APs \nestimates  for  each  of  the  sample  subprojects.  The  rates  have  been  used  as  the  basis  of  the \nresettlement cost estimates and will need to be verified during project implementation through a \nreplacement cost survey.  \n\nB. \n\nSteps to Assess and Minimize LAR Impacts \n\n8. \nDuring resettlement planning for the three sample subprojects, steps were taken to help \nminimize the level of LAR impacts on local villages and households; for instance, by  reducing \nthe width of urban roads by 0.5 m to 1.0 m. A list of steps that should be implemented during the \npreparation  of  future  subprojects  is  included  in  the  RF.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  checklist  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement  will  be  used  to  assess  the  potential  LAR  affects  of  the  Project  on \nhouseholds for noncore subprojects. If the potential impacts are significant, then the design of \nthe  subproject  must  be  reconsidered  to  make  the  impacts  nonsignificant,  as  indicated  by  the \ncriteria for project eligibility. A short RP will be required for each subproject town according to \nGovernment regulations, ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, and Operations Manual No. \nF2/Bank Policies, and Operations Manual No. F2/Operational Procedures.  \n\nC. \n\nConsultation Process, Grievance Mechanism, and Disclosure \n\n9. \nShort RPs will be prepared (as part of subproject preparation) and implemented with the \nparticipation  of  and  in  consultation  with  affected  people.  A  copy  of  the  short  RP  in  the  Lao \n                                                 \n5   Draft Decree on Resettlement and Compensation, pending the Prime Minister\u2019s Approval. \n6   During implementation, the AusAid/World Bank Land Titling Project will be considered. \n\n\f \n54 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nto \n\nlodge  grievances  verbally  and/or \n\nlanguage will be available to APs at each district office and with each village head whose village \nwill have LAR impacts. An information booklet in the Lao language will be distributed to APs at \nthe  time  of  subproject  and  RP  preparation,  and  again,  after  replacement  cost  survey  and \ndetailed design is completed. Information booklets for noncore subproject RPs will be distributed \nto  APs  before  subproject  appraisal.  Affected  people  will  be  informed  of  the  process  and  their \ninitial  consultations, \nrights \nsocial/resettlement  surveys,  and  at  the  time  of  compensation.  They  will  be  exempted  from  all \ntaxes, administrative, and legal fees. Complaints will be filed first at the village level and will be \nelevated,  first,  to  the  district  level  and,  second,  to  the  provincial  level  if  APs  are  not  satisfied. \nThe RF for the Project and sample short RPs will be posted on the ADB web site upon Board \napproval,  and  short  RPs  prepared  for  other  subprojects  will  be  posted  on  the  ADB  web  site \nbefore subproject appraisal and upon Government and ADB approval of the final RP.   \n \nD. \n\nBudget, Institutional Arrangements, and Monitoring \n\nin  writing  during \n\n10. \nThe estimated cost of LAR for about 12 subproject towns is $0.45 million. The estimated \ncost of LAR in Muong Houn, Muong Nan, and Kenethao is about $28,000, $58,000, and $28,000, \nrespectively.7  All  costs  will  be  updated  after  completion  of  the  detailed  measurement  surveys, \nrevised  census,  and  application  of  final  compensation  rates  (based  on  replacement  costs  at \ncurrent  market  value  at  the  time  of  compensation).  Adequate  staff  and  budgetary  support  has \nbeen committed and will be made available to cover LAR within the agreed upon implementation \nperiod.  Short  RPs  for  other  subproject  towns  will  include  an  implementation  schedule,  and \nbreakdowns  for  each  type  of  loss,  with  corresponding  cost  estimates  reflecting  replacement  at \ncurrent market values. Provisions for implementation and contingencies will be included.  \n \n11. \nThe  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  will  coordinate  all  LAR  activities.  The  project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  responsible  for  LAR  implementation,  monitoring,  and \nsupervision.  Provincial  and  district  resettlement  committees  will  be  established,  with  focal \nperson(s) identified at village level for active participation in design and implementation of short \nRPs.  The  PIU  will  prepare  monthly  progress  reports  and  a  final  report  to  the  PCU  upon \ncompletion  of  LAR  activities.  The  PCU  will  consolidate  the  information  from  the  PIUs  and  any \nadditional  information  from  the  consultant  supervision  team  in  its  quarterly  progress  reports  to \nADB. The PCU will engage an independent external monitor, acceptable to ADB, for 3 years to \noversee LAR activities for the subproject towns. Upon completion of LAR activities, the external \nmonitor  will  submit  semiannual  reports  and  a  final  evaluation  to  the  PCU  and  ADB \nsimultaneously.  The  PCU  will  also  submit  to  ADB  within  3  months  of  project  completion  a \nresettlement  completion  report  based  on  the  agreed  upon  resettlement  planning  documents, \ntogether with financial audit statements approved by an independent agency.  \n \n12. \nSupervision  consultants  will  provide  assistance  during  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation.  Resettlement  workshops  for  provincial  and  district  officials  are  part  of  the \nProject\u2019s  implementation  assistance  and  capacity  building.  The  executing  agency  will  be \nresponsible  for  (i)  approving  the  RF  and  short  RPs,  with  endorsement  from  provincial  and \ndistrict governments; and (ii) forwarding the documents to ADB for concurrence. All resettlement \nactivities will be coordinated with the civil works schedule. ADB will issue a no objection to civil \nworks  contract  awards after  the  Government  has  satisfactorily  completed\u2014in  accordance  with \nthe approved short RP for that subproject\u2014compensation payments and relocation to new sites. \nRehabilitation  assistance  will  be  in  place  and  the  area  for  civil  works  should  be  free  of  all \nencumbrances. \n\n                                                 \n7   These costs include a 10% contingency. An additional 10% is covered by the total Project. Implementation costs \n\nare part of the overall project implementation budget.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n 55\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\n1. \nEconomic analyses were undertaken for the water supply and sanitation components of \nthe  three  sample  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB) \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  (1997)  and  Guidelines  for  the  Economic \nAnalysis of Water Supply Projects (1998). The analysis is for the 34-year economic useful life of \neach subproject, which includes the 3-year construction period, 30-year operating life, as well as \na  final  year  for  asset  salvage  and  disposal.  Details  of  the  economic  analysis  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix M. \n \n2. \nThe  capital  and  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  for  each  water \nsupply and sanitation system were estimated and are expressed in constant 2005 prices in Lao \nkip  (KN).  All  costs  were  derived  from  the  financial  project  costs  and  reexpressed  in  economic \nprices using the domestic price numeraire. Taxes and duties were deducted as appropriate from \nbase costs. Tradable components were adjusted to economic prices using a shadow exchange \nrate  factor  (SERF),1  while  nontraded  components  were  valued  at  domestic  market  prices.  A \nshadow wage rate factor (SWRF) for unskilled labor was applied to reflect its opportunity cost in \nthe context of wide availability of labor in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).2  \n \nB. \n\nDemand Forecast \n\n3. \nWater demand in the sample subproject towns was derived from the current populations \nwithin  the  planned  service  areas,  population  growth,  current  and  future  domestic  water \nconsumption  levels,  and  a  provision  for  nondomestic  water  consumption.  Reliable  data  on  the \namount  of  water  presently  consumed  by  households  in  the  subproject  towns  is  not  available. \nHouseholds  typically  utilize  a  variety  of  water  sources  and  do  not  measure  or  assess  their \nconsumption. However, based on previous surveys and studies, as well as observations of water \nuse  behavior  in  the  subproject  towns,  it  is  estimated  that  average  daily  demand  from  existing \nsources  ranges  between  40  and  70  liter  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd)  depending  on  the  effort  and \nresources  needed  to  acquire  the  water,  and  on  income  levels.  The  lifeline  consumption \nrequirement was estimated to be 40 lpcd. Per capita water consumption is expected to increase \nafter  construction  of  the  piped  water  supply  system,  due  primarily  to  (i)  the  reduced  cost  of \nacquiring  water,  (ii)  improved  water  quality,  and  (iii)  greater  convenience  and  reliability  of  the \npiped water supply system. However, demand is also a function of price and household income \nand accurate estimates of the impact of these factors require analysis of extensive historical data, \nwhich  are  not  available  for  the  Lao  PDR.  Therefore,  while  the  demand  forecasts  incorporate \nestimated  price  and  income  elasticity,  the  reliability  of  these  estimates  is  limited  by  the  lack  of \ndetailed  historic  data.  Previous  experience  in  the  sector  indicates  that  the  per  capita  water \nconsumption levels tend to be overestimated. For example, the original design criteria employed \nfor the ongoing Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (WSSP) was based on consumption \nof 120 lpcd. However, on the basis of actual consumption patterns, that figure was reduced to 100 \nlpcd for WSSP phase IIb subprojects. Considering the higher tariffs to be adopted and alternative \nwater  resources  available  for  noncritical  water  usage  by  some  households,  postproject  water \nconsumption in the three sample subproject towns was estimated to be 85 lpcd. \n \nC. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\n4. \nLeast-cost  analysis  was  undertaken  to  evaluate  different  technical  options,  including \nalternative  water  sources,  the  size  and  timing  of  water  treatment  plants,  reservoirs,  and \n\n                                                           \n1   The SERF is estimated at 1.05. \n2   The SWRF is estimated at 0.71. \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n \n\n \n\ntransmission mains. The analysis compares the net present value (NPV) of incremental capital \nand  O&M  cost  streams  of  viable  technical  alternatives,  which  are  discounted  at  an  economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital  (EOCC)  of  12%.  The  alternative  with  the  lowest  NPV  is \nrecommended for engineering design and benefit-cost analysis. \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n5. \nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  subproject  water  supply  and  sanitation  components \ninclude  cost  savings  associated  with  the  replacement  of  nonincremental  water  supplies  with \nthose  from  the  new  piped  water  supply  system,  benefits  from  incremental  water  consumption \nprovided  by  these  new  systems,  and  improved  public  health.  Presently,  residents  in  the \nsubproject towns use a variety of water sources, including rivers, wells, rainwater, bottled water, \nand  private  vendors.  Costs  associated  with  these  existing  supplies  include  source/treatment \ncosts, collection costs, storage costs, and financial expenditures made in purchasing water. The \nsavings generated from the Project are the avoided costs associated with these supply sources. \nThis  is  calculated  as  existing  water  consumption  multiplied  by  the  weighted  average  cost  of \nwater from these existing sources, which is estimated at KN25,300/cubic meter (m3) for Houn, \nKN20,900/m3 for Kenethao, and KN18,500/m3 for Nan. While health benefits are also expected \nfrom the improved water supply and sanitation services, they were not included in the benefit-\ncost analysis due to lack of reliable data and because these benefits were partially captured in \nthe households\u2019 willingness to pay. \n \nE. \n\nResults of Economic Analysis \n\n6. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  sample  subprojects  was  calculated \nas 22.3% for Houn, 19.1% for Kenethao, and 22.7% for Nan, well above the 12% EOCC (Table \nA15). On this basis, all three subprojects are considered economically viable. An analysis was \nundertaken  to  test  the  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  to  adverse  changes  in  selected  variables.  The \nvariables tested were (i) 10% increase in subproject capital costs; (i) 10% increase in subproject \nO&M costs; (iii) 10% reduction in subproject benefits; (iv) 1-year delay in completing subproject \nconstruction, which delays subproject benefits by 1 year and results in 10% increase in capital \ncosts incurred over the final 2 years of construction; and (v) a combination of the four previous \nvariables. Of the single variable scenarios, the EIRR is most sensitive to the 1-year delay, but \nremains well above the EOCC. Even under the worst case scenario, in which all four adverse \nvariables  are  combined,  each  of  the  subprojects  remains  economically  viable  with  EIRRs  of \n16.4% for Houn, 13.8% for Kenethao, and 16.6% for Nan.  \n \n\nTable A15: Results of Economic Analysis for Water Supply and Sanitation Components \n\nChange \n\nKey Variable \n\nHoun (%) \nSI \n \n \nBase Case \n \n1.

Details  of the  financial \nanalysis are presented in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \nSubproject-specific water tariffs were calculated on the basis of the financial objectives \n2. \nagreed  upon  with  the  Government.  On  the  basis  of  the  tariffs,  financial  projections  were \nundertaken on a stand-alone basis for the sample subprojects, as well as for the responsible PNP \non  a  consolidated  province-wide  basis.  The  projections  consist  of  annual  financial  statements \nfunds  statement,  balance  sheet),  key \n(income  statement,  sources  and  applications  of \nperformance indicators, and supporting operating and financial data for the 2005\u20132016 period.  \n \nB. \n\nBases for Financial Projections \n\nPrice.  The  financial  projections  for  each  subproject  and  for  their  respective  PNPs  are \n3. \npresented in Lao kip (KN) on a current price basis. Revenues and costs are converted from a \nconstant 2005 price basis to current prices using projected local inflation rates, which are 10% \nper year between 2005 and 2009, 8% between 2010 and 2014, and 7% per year thereafter.   \n \n4. \nFinancial  Objectives.  Each  PNP  participating  in  the  Project  will  implement  subproject \nspecific tariffs that are sufficient to (i) fully recover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, (ii) \nrecover  all  subproject  debt  service,  (iii)  maintain  a  debt  service  ratio  of  at  least  1.2  once  the \nsubproject  is  fully  operational,  and  (iv)  gradually  recover  an  increasing  proportion  of  annual \ndepreciation expense on the subproject fixed assets. Furthermore, each participating PNP will \nachieve an overall debt service ratio of at least 1.2 and maintain its accounts receivable at less \nthan 90 days of annual sales, the same as that required under the ongoing Water Supply and \nSanitation Sector Project (WSSSP). Under the Project, however, 30% of the subproject cost will \nbe re-lent to the PNPs, compared with 15% for the WSSSP. \n \n5. \nOperating  Revenues. Operating revenues were derived from water sales, meter rental \ncharges, connection fees, and miscellaneous income. Future water sales were calculated on the \nbasis  of  water  demand  (Appendix  15)  and  projected  water  tariff  levels.  For  the  subprojects, \ntariffs are set to meet the agreed upon financial objectives for the subprojects. Tariffs were set \nin accordance with those recommended by the Water Supply Authority (WASA) for 2005\u20132007.1 \nTariffs beyond 2007 were conservatively assumed to be increased annually at the local inflation \nrate.  Meter rental  income was estimated at an average of KN3,300 per month per meter for all \ncustomers,  expressed  in  2005  prices,  and  then  adjusted  each  year  by  the  local  inflation  rate. \nConnection  fees  were  set  at  the  estimated  average  cost  of  connection  plus  15%  overhead. \nMiscellaneous  revenue  derived  primarily  from  late  payment  penalties  was  estimated  at  3%  of \nwater sales revenues. \n \n6. \nOperating Expenses. Annual O&M costs were projected separately for each subproject \nand  for  the  PNPs\u2019  other  operations  over  the  entire  forecast  period  by  major  expense  item \n(personnel,  electricity,  chemicals,  maintenance,  administration,  new  connection  costs).  In \naddition,  the  projections  incorporated  the  turnover  tax  of  5%  of  water  sales  and  10%  of  other \nsales including connection costs. Depreciation expense was calculated on an average asset life \nof 25 years on a straight-line basis. Income tax was then applied at the rate of 35% on pre-tax \nincome, or 1% of PNP revenue if there was no pre-tax income. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Water Supply Authority (WASA) 2005\u20132007 Tariff Review, November 2004. \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n7. \nSubproject  Cost  and  Financing  Plan.  Subproject  capital  costs  are  funded  through  a \nmix  of  Government  equity  injections  and  loans.  The  proceeds  of  the  proposed  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  Norwegian  Agency  for  Development  Cooperation  (NORAD) \ngrants,  as  well  as  the  Government  contribution,  will  be  provided  as  Government  equity \ninjections to the PNPs. A portion of the proposed OPEC loan, equivalent to 30% of the total cost \nof the water supply component of each subproject, will be lent to each PNP through subsidiary \nloans. Each subsidiary loan will be made in local currency and carry an interest rate of 6.4% per \nannum,  with  repayment  over  25  years  including  a  6-year  grace  period.  The  remainder  of  the \nOrganization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  loan  is  passed  to  the  PNPs  as \nGovernment equity contributions. \n \nC. \n\nSubproject Water Tariffs \n\nAverage Tariff Requirements. When subproject operations begin in 2009, the average \n8. \ntariffs  required  are  estimated  to  be  KN3,200/m3  in  Houn,  KN3,600/m3  in  Kenethao,  and \nKN2,000/m3 in Nan, expressed in constant 2005 prices (Table A16.1). These requirements were \ndetermined  on  the  basis  of  each  subproject\u2019s  average  incremental  financial  cost  with  30% \ncapital cost recovery (or 30% of average depreciation) and adjusted to ensure a minimum debt \nservice  ratio  of  1.2  after  the  facilities  are  fully  operational.  The  financial  projections \nconservatively  assume  that  most  existing  residents  in  the  subproject  service  areas  will  not  be \nconnected  to  the  new  systems  until  at  least  3  years  after  operations  commence.  Due  to  this \nassumed lag in the rate of connection, water sales are projected to be somewhat lower over this \ninitial  period  of  subproject  operations.  As  a  result,  a  lower  debt  service  ratio  of  at  least  1.0  is \nconsidered  acceptable  over  the  first  3  years  of  operation  (2009\u20132011).  After  initial  tariff \nimplementation in 2009, the average tariff is increased annually by the projected local inflation \nrate.  Additionally,  a  real  increase  of  at  least  1%  is  implemented  every  second  year  so  as  to \nmeet the agreed financial objective to recover an increasing proportion of depreciation expense. \nGiven  these  real  increases,  by  2015  the  average  tariffs  would  be  KN3,450/m3  in  Houn, \nKN4,000/m3 in Kenethao, and KN2,300/m3 in Nan, also expressed in constant 2005 prices. \n\n \nTariff  Structures.  A  progressive  tariff  structure  for  domestic  consumers  will  be \n9. \nimplemented in each subproject town (Table A16.1), with three blocks including a lifeline block \nof  40  liter  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd).  The  blocks  are  developed  on  the  basis  of  the  following \nprinciples:  (i)  for  the  lifeline  block  of  40  lpcd,  the  tariff  is  set  to  recover  direct  cash  operating \nexpenses;  (ii)  the  tariff  for  the  middle  block  (between  40  and  85  lpcd)  is  set  to  recover  cash \noperating expenses, taxes, debt service and to achieve a debt service ratio of at least 1.2; and \n(iii) the tariff for the highest domestic block (above 85 lpcd) and all nondomestic consumption is \nset at 1.5 times the second block tariff. Over the forecast period, increases in these tariffs are \ndetermined to ensure that the overall average tariff requirement in each year is met. \n \n10. \nAffordability.  An  affordability  analysis  was  undertaken  to  ensure  that  domestic \nconsumers,  particularly  those  in  the  low-income  group,  can  afford  the  water  tariffs  in  each \nsample  subproject  town  (Table  A16.1).  Based  on  generally  accepted  principles  that  the \nexpenditure on water should not exceed 5% of household income, the projected water tariffs are \nconsidered affordable.  \n \n\nTable A16.1: Projected Tariff Requirements and Affordability \n(KN/m3 \u2013 constant 2005 prices) \n\nItem \nHoun \nAverage Tariff \nDetailed Tariffs \n  Lifeline Block \n  Middle Block \n  Highest Block \n\n2009 \n \n3,200 \n \n1,300 \n4,300 \n6,450 \n\n \n2011 \n \n3,400 \n \n1,350 \n4,500 \n6,750 \n\n2013 \n \n3,400 \n \n1,350 \n4,550 \n6,800 \n\n2015 \n \n3,450 \n \n1,350 \n4,550 \n6,800 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n59\n\nItem \n  Nondomestic \nAffordabilitya\n  Low Income (%) \n  Average Income (%) \n \nKenethao \nAverage Tariff \nDetailed Tariffs \n  Lifeline Block \n  Middle Block \n  Highest Block \n  Nondomestic \nAffordability \n  Low Income (%) \n  Average Income (%) \n \nNan \nAverage Tariff \nDetailed Tariffs \n  Lifeline Block \n  Middle Block \n  Highest Block \n  Nondomestic \nAffordability \n  Low Income (%) \n  Average Income (%) \n \nKN = kip, m3 = cubic meter. \na  The  proportion  of  projected  monthly  household  income  that  low-income  households  and  households  earning  an \n\n2015 \n6,800 \n \n2.9 \n2.8 \n \n \n4,000 \n \n2,250 \n4,900 \n7,350 \n7,350 \n \n2.2 \n1.9 \n \n \n2,300 \n \n1,150 \n2,950 \n4,400 \n4,400 \n \n3.9 \n3.6 \n \n\n2013 \n6,800 \n \n3.1 \n3.0 \n \n \n4,000 \n \n2,200 \n4,900 \n7,350 \n7,350 \n \n2.3 \n2.0 \n \n \n2,300 \n \n1,150 \n2,900 \n4,350 \n4,350 \n \n4.1 \n3.7 \n \n\n2011 \n6,750 \n \n3.3 \n3.1 \n \n \n3,950 \n \n2,200 \n4,900 \n7,350 \n7,350 \n \n2.5 \n2.1 \n \n \n2,200 \n \n1,100 \n2,800 \n4,200 \n4,200 \n \n4.1 \n3.7 \n \n\n2009 \n6,450 \n \n3.4 \n3.2 \n \n \n3,600 \n \n2,000 \n4,500 \n6,750 \n6,750 \n \n2.4 \n2.1 \n \n \n2,000 \n \n1,000 \n2,550 \n3,800 \n3,800 \n \n4.0 \n3.6 \n \n\naverage income need to pay the estimated monthly water bill, including meter rental fees. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\nD. \n\nFinancial Performance of Provincial Nam Papas \n\n11. \nRecent Financial Performance. Two of the three sample PNPs, Oudomxay (Houn) and \nXayabury (Kenethao) incurred net losses in both 2002 and 2003, and were estimated to have \nalso had losses in 2004. In contrast, the financial performance of the Luang Prabang PNP (Nan) \nwas  one  of the  strongest  of  the  country\u2019s  18  PNPs  (Table A16.2).  Net  income  was  positive  in \nboth 2002 and 2003 and was estimated to have improved further in 2004. In 2003, the PNP fully \nrecovered all costs, generated a net cash flow of almost KN400 million, and earned a healthy \n12% return on net fixed assets. The Oudomxay and  Xayabury tariffs have not been set at full \ncost  recovery  levels,  while  Luang  Prabang,  a  major  tourist  destination,  has  benefited  from  its \nmore advanced development status as well as from an inexpensive spring water source, which \nmade full cost recovery possible even at the existing relatively low tariff levels. \n \nProjected  Financial  Performance. The financial projections for the three PNPs, which \n12. \ninclude \nfinancial \nperformance  over  the  2005\u20132016  forecast  period  (Table  A16.2).  The  net  losses  in  Oudomxay \nand  Xayabury  are  expected  to  be  gradually  reduced  and  then  eliminated.    Oudomxay  is \nprojected  to  begin  earning  a  positive  net  income  by  2016  while  Xayabury  should  become \nprofitable in 2015. Both PNPs are projected to generate positive net cash flow each year over \nthis  period,  which  can  be  used  to  fund  much-needed  rehabilitation  and  expansion  works \nthroughout their respective service areas. As a result, the PNPs will require no further subsidies \nand will be able to fund all O&M expenses, and debt service, and generate an increasing cash \nsurplus. This improving cash flow performance  is illustrated by the debt-service ratio, which is \nprojected  to  increase  from  1.2  in  2004  to  2.6  by  2015  in  the  case  of  Oudomxay,  and  for \nXayabury  from  1.2  to  2.5  between  2007  and  2016.  In  2009  and  2010,  a  moderate,  but \ntemporary,  weakening  in  the  PNPs\u2019  performance  is  anticipated,  which  is  due  to  the  start  of \noperations  and  debt  service  for  the  Houn  and  Kenethao  subprojects.    However,  as  more \n\ntheir  respective  sample  subprojects, \n\nindicate  progressively \n\nimproving \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nresidents  are  connected  to  the  new  systems,  sales  revenues  increase  and  the  trend  toward \nbetter financial performance resumes. For the Luang Prabang PNP, net income is projected to \nbe positive, but lower between 2005 and 2007 relative to that in 2002 and 2003. This is primarily \ndue  to  the  PNP\u2019s  new  Nambak  water  supply  system,  which  was  commissioned  in  2004.  The \nPNP has extended the application of its existing tariffs for Luang Prabang town to Nambak, but \nthe  unit  cost  of  service  for  this  new  system  is  much  higher.  Consequently,  the  system  is \nprojected to operate at a significant loss, which will adversely affect overall PNP performance. \nWith  the  start  of  operations  and  debt  service  on  the  Nan  subproject  in  2009,  the  PNP  is \nprojected to incur a modest net loss of about KN140 million. However, the impact on the PNP is \nexpected  to  be  manageable  and  there  should  be  no  need  for  any  Government  operating \nsubsidies over the entire forecast period. Beyond 2009, financial performance is then projected \nto improve as sales increase while interest expense declines as the PNP\u2019s loans are repaid. Net \nincome is projected to be just over KN1 billion on revenue of KN11.9 billion by 2013, and just \nunder KN2 billion on revenue of KN15.2 billion by 2016. The debt service ratio is anticipated to \nremain well above 1.2 in all years over the forecast period, ranging between 2.6 (2011) and 4.8 \n(2016), because debt levels are modest and gradually decline after peaking in 2008. \n \n\nTable A16.2: Summary of PNP Financial Projections \n(KN million \u2013 current prices) \n \n\nProjected \n\n2007 \n \n \n\n2,095 \n(1,017) \n720 \n \n3,110
