Six \nirrigation subprojects (one in each province) with good potential \nfor increased agricultural production were selected according to \nagreed selection criteria: (i) financially and economically viable, (ii) \ncontributing  strongly  to  poverty  reduction,  (iii)  environmentally \nsustainable,  (iv)  compliant  with  principles  of  integrated  water \nresource management, and (v) responsive to natural disaster risk \nreduction initiatives. \n \nIn these schemes, the Project will (i) improve irrigation system \nmanagement by reforming service providers and concomitantly \nbuilding  capacity  of  client  water  users  as  partners  in  scheme \noperation  and  maintenance,  and  (ii)  improve  irrigation  and \ndrainage  infrastructure  and  strengthen  natural  disaster  risk \nreduction measures. Physical works will include rehabilitation and \nnew construction of water conservation, irrigation, drainage, and \nprotective measures.  \n   \nRationale  Continued,  deep,  and  lasting  poverty  reduction  in  the  central \ncoastal region depends on improving returns from agriculture, a \nsector  whose  performance  is  held  back  by  physical  and \ninstitutional  constraints.  The  Project  is  premised  on  the \nassumption that improved performance of the region\u2019s irrigation \nschemes depends on introducing service-oriented management \nsystems  that  are  cost-efficient,  effective,  autonomous,  and \naccountable.  The  participation  of  water  user  groups  in  the \nplanning, design, implementation, and operation and maintenance \nof subprojects is not only indispensable for sustainable operation, \nbut also a cost-efficient means of helping service providers meet \ntheir goals.  \n   \n \n ", "ii \nImpact and Outcome  The  project  impact  will  be  reduced  poverty  in  six  central \nprovinces.  The  project  outcome  will  be  increased  agricultural \nproduction in selected irrigation subprojects.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost, including contingencies, taxes, and duties, \nis  estimated  at  $99.0  million.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  is \nestimated at $37.8 million or 38% of the total project cost. The \nlocal currency cost including taxes is $61.2 million or 62% of the \ntotal project cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of $74.3 \nmillion equivalent from its Special Fund resources to finance 75% \nof the project cost amounting to $99.0 million. The Government \nwill finance about $24.7 million or 25% of the project cost.  \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB will provide a loan of various currencies equivalent to $74.3 \nmillion from its Special Funds resources. The loan will have a term \nof 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be executed by MARD through its Central Project \nArrangements  Office (CPO) based in Hanoi. CPO will set up a central project \nmanagement  unit  (CPMU)  to  (i)  provide  overall  project \nmanagement  and  coordination,  (ii)  liaise  with  the  provincial \npeople's committee and provincial department of agriculture and \nrural development (DARD) in each province to improve irrigation \nmanagement systems, (iii) guide and coordinate DARD in each \nprovince  to  improve  irrigation  infrastructure,  (iv)  implement  the \nproject  performance  management  system  (PPMS),  (v)  procure \nconsulting  services,  (vi)  coordinate  with  the  provincial  project \nmanagement units (PPMUs) in each province to procure goods \nand  services  through  international  competitive  bidding,  (vii) \nprepare  forecasts  of  contract  awards  and  disbursements  and \narrange  project  account  audits,  (viii)  prepare  major  reports \ncovering the whole Project by consolidating the reports from each \nprovince, and (viii) prepare the project completion report. \n \n  In each target province, a PPMU will be created under the direct \nadministration of DARD. Each PPMU will be headed by a full-time \nsubproject manager with qualifications acceptable to ADB. The \nPPMU  will  improve  irrigation  management  systems  (output  1), \nimprove  irrigation  infrastructure  (output  2),  procure  goods  and \nservices using local competitive bidding, operationalize the PPMS, ", "iii \nand  implement  resettlement,  environmental  management,  a \ngender action plan, an HIV/AIDS awareness program, and (in Tra \nCau subproject) an ethnic minority development plan.  \n \n  The vice minister of MARD will head a project steering committee \nset up to provide policy and strategy advice and to communicate \nproject outcomes with other ministries. \n   \nProcurement  Civil  works,  goods,  and  related  services  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works \ncontracts estimated to cost more than $2 million equivalent will be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding  among \nprequalified firms with proven technical competence acceptable to \nADB. Civil works contracts estimated to cost $2 million or less will \nbe procured through local competitive bidding procedures. State-\nowned enterprises will be eligible to bid for contracts if they are \nfinancially autonomous, independently managed, and operate on \nthe basis of commercial practice. Equipment to be procured under \nthe Project includes vehicles, motorcycles, computers, software, \nand water quality monitoring equipment. Such equipment will be \nprocured by international competitive bidding where the cost is \nmore than $1 million, international shopping where the cost is \n$500,000 to $1 million per package, and local competitive bidding \nwhere the cost is less than $500,000. Where local suppliers are \nfew,  procurement  may  be  made  by  direct  purchase,  with  a \nthreshold of $100,000, as will be the case for negotiated service \ncontracts with nongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 227 person-months of domestic and 103 \nperson-months  of  international  consultants.  All  consultants, \nNGOs,  and  local  institutions  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and \nengagement of domestic consultants. The quality- and cost-based \nselection  method  will  be  used.  The  consultants  will  build  the \ncapacity  of  MARD  and  DARD  to  develop  and  operationalize \nbusiness  plans  for  irrigation  management  companies  and \nenterprises, create and operationalize PPMS, and coordinate and \nsupervise project implementation. Local consulting firms, NGOs, \nand institutions will be engaged to provide training, implement the \ngender  action  plan  and  HIV/AIDS  awareness  program,  create \nwater user groups and associations, complete the final design of \nworks and supervise their construction, and monitor performance. \nA team of international and domestic consultants, some of whom \nwill be based in Thua Thien Hue, will assist CPMU in MARD and \nthe PPMU in each of the project provinces.  \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project will establish a service-oriented approach to irrigation \nBeneficiaries  water  management  where  provincial  agencies  and  the  water \nusers will be empowered to jointly manage irrigation schemes. \nThis will be done by (i) restructuring the water service providers as ", "iv \nfinancially  autonomous  entities,  and  forming  water  users  into \ngroups  to  participate  fully  in  irrigation  management;  and  (ii) \nconstructing and rehabilitating water management infrastructure in \neach subproject area. Natural disaster risk reduction measures \nwill complement the physical improvements. The main quantifiable \nbenefits  for  the  subproject  areas  are  incremental  outputs  of \nagricultural products from 57,755 hectares deriving from (i) higher \ncropping  intensities,  (ii)  higher  yields  due  to  reliable  and  full \nirrigation water supply, and (iii) incremental output from shrimp \nand fish farming. \n \nAbout 400,500 people in the six subproject areas will benefit from \nincreased agricultural income and more jobs. Many of them will \nbenefit from improved water supply for domestic use and reduced \nvulnerability  to  natural  disasters.  About  38%  of  beneficiary \nhouseholds live below the poverty line of $0.33 per person per \nday. Generally, farm benefits are expected to nearly double, lifting \nabout 6,000 households above the poverty line. About 25% of the \nhouseholds are headed by women and have limited access to \nadult  labor,  land,  and  credit.  A  gender  action  plan  will  be \nimplemented to assist these households. Resettlement plans will \nensure  that  project-affected  people  will  be  adequately \ncompensated in accordance with ADB guidelines. The Project is \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of \n15% for the base case. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risks arise from delays in realizing benefits. Possible \ncauses  of  delay  are  slowness  in  recruiting  consultants  and \nappointing  central  and  provincial  project  management  staff, \nresistance  of  vested  interests  to  changes  in  organizational \nstructure  of  service  providers,  cumbersome  administrative \nprocesses related to contract awards, and insensitive handling of \nresettlement. Resettlement and compensation of people affected \nby the construction works need to be completed before civil works \ncontracts are awarded.  \n \nThe Project includes measures to mitigate the above risks, and all \nenvironmental,  social,  and  financial  risks.  The  principal \nassumption  is  that  the  Government  will  fully  support  the \ninstitutional reform process, including the restructuring of service \nproviders and promotion of more autonomous water user groups. \nProject consultants will help the provincial authorities complete \nresettlement  on  time.  MARD  has  experience  in,  and  a  good \nunderstanding  of  Government  and  ADB  requirements  for \nresettlement. ", "v \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Central Region Water Resources Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Rural Poverty and Agriculture \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s energetic pursuit of development over the last two decades, accompanied by \neconomic liberalization and greater openness to the outside world, has produced a remarkable \ntransformation in what was hitherto a traditional and poor rural society. Strong economic growth \nhas led to increasingly rapid urbanization and correspondingly unprecedented increases in \nwages and quality of life. Despite the changes this has wrought and the pressures placed on the \ncountry\u2019s decrepit infrastructure, Viet Nam has retained its rich culture and a rural landscape of \nunparalleled beauty. The country\u2019s agricultural land, predominantly devoted to rice cultivation, \nincludes the Red River and Mekong River delta areas as well as the narrow plains stretching \nalong the 1,500 kilometers (km) of coastline connecting these mighty river deltas. \n \n3.  The rural tranquility conceals a deepening crisis. Although Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth \nhas averaged more than 7% over the last 5 years and overall poverty has been reduced from \n58.1% in 1993 to 24.1% in 2004,1 poverty reduction has not been uniform and pockets of \nextreme  poverty  persist  in  rural  areas.2  Inequalities  in  income  distribution  have  increased, \nreflecting higher growth in per capita income in areas that are rapidly developing, and resource-\nrich than in areas that are remote, lack infrastructure, have few resources, or are vulnerable to \nnatural disasters. Rural areas have not benefited to the same extent from liberalization. Most \ninstitutions serving rural communities have changed little from an earlier era of central control, \nand  have  not  benefited  from  the  public  administration  reforms  that  have  brought  more \nimmediate benefits to fast-developing urban areas. \n \n4.  Viet Nam\u2019s population of 83 million is still predominantly rural (60 million or 73%) and \ndependent on agriculture for livelihoods and basic needs.3 The contribution from agriculture, \nforestry,  and  aquaculture  to  the  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  was  20.5%  in  2005  and, \nalthough the sector\u2019s contribution is expected to decline to 15.5% by 2010, the sector led in job \ncreation\u2014adding 4.6 million out of 7.5 million new jobs\u2014during 2001\u20132005. Over the next 5 \nyears, agriculture is expected to grow by about 3% (compared with 10% for industry and \nconstruction, and 8% for services). By 2010, the number of people engaged in agriculture is \nexpected to decline to 44 million or 50% of the total population. \n \n5.  Viet Nam\u2019s investments in agriculture, equivalent to about 5% of the national budget, are \nspent mostly on irrigation and forestry.4 For irrigation, the upgrading of existing infrastructure \ndominates the Government's program (64% of spending in 2003). Nevertheless, about 40% (or \n2.25 million hectares [ha]) of the commanded areas are not yet served.

The Critical Role of Water \n6.  Viet Nam is exposed to typhoons that cause flash floods, landslides, and coastal erosion \nalong its eastern seaboard. Its monsoon climate guarantees abundant water at some times of \nthe year, leading to flooding of much of its most productive agricultural land, but also water \nshortages during the dry season. Rivers that originate within Viet Nam are short and steep, \noffering limited opportunities for multipurpose water storage reservoirs, and about 60% of its \nwater resources originate from neighboring countries. The high regional, seasonal, and annual \nvariability of water supply is likely to become more so because of climate change associated \nwith global warming. The impacts of human activities on some river basin upper catchments \naggravate the perceptibly increased flooding and sediment discharge during the wet season and \ndiminished low flows during the dry season. Salt water intrusion is advancing into coastal plains \nand delta areas, limiting opportunities for extraction of water for agricultural, domestic, and \nindustrial uses. This is exacerbated by increased upstream withdrawals to meet the growing \nneeds of an industrializing and urbanizing economy. Pollution of surface and ground water is \nemerging as a problem in many river basins. \n \n7.  Viet  Nam  has  a  long  history  of  water  management  in  support  of  agricultural \nintensification and the development of a strong industrial sector.5 Its transformation  into a \nmarket-oriented economy has brought decentralization, socialization, grassroots democracy, \nand the promotion of small-scale private enterprise to the fore of its water sector reform agenda, \ncreating a favorable environment for institutional change at all levels of water management.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Irrigation Performance in the Central Coastal Region \n8.  The  central  region  has  particularly  severe  constraints  that  single  it  out  for  special \nsupport.6 The Government's 5-year socioeconomic development plan (SEDP) for 2006\u20132010 \n(footnote 1) notes the region\u2019s persistent poverty which declined to an average of 38% during \n1992\u20132004 from 74.5% in the north and 47.2% in the south central coastal regions.7 The \ncoastal plain, which encompasses the region\u2019s irrigation schemes, experiences 4\u20136 typhoons \neach year on average.8 Completion or rehabilitation of these schemes (covering not only major \nstructures for diversion and conveyance of water, but also lower level canals and drains and \nmeasures to protect against floods), is a prerequisite to full performance. \n \n                                                 \n5  Irrigation, drainage, and flood control have traditionally been the main foci of water sector development with less \nthan 1% of total water resources used to meet municipal and industrial demands. \n6 ADB's country strategy and program (CSP) (ADB. Country Strategy and Program (2002\u20132004); Viet Nam. Manila) \nallocated one-third of lending to the central region as a major thrust of ADB's assistance program. This emphasis \nhas been retained in various updates through to the most recent CSP update (ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and \nProgram Update (2006-2008) Viet Nam. Manila). The CSP update states that the region is constrained by its \npaucity of resources, and low capacity to develop strategic plans and mobilize resources.  \n7 The SEDP aims to achieve annual average GDP rates of 8.0\u20139.0% for these regions during 2006\u20132010, with \nagriculture contributing 3.1%. \n8 The frequency and severity of natural disasters along the central coast led to the establishment of the Natural \nDisaster Mitigation Partnership between the Government and international funding agencies.  ", "  3\n9.  The major constraints, however, relate to management (Appendix 1). The Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and other national agencies involved in managing \nand using water follow an engineering, sectoral approach to water resource development and \nhave yet to fully assimilate integrated water resources management (IWRM) into their planning \nstrategies and work practices. Provincial agencies have considerable authority to make key \ndecisions on water infrastructure development and management, subject to conformity with \nnational sector policies and strategies, but their capacity to target poverty in water projects and \ncoordinate  various  cross-sectoral  aspects  of  resource  management  is  limited.  Irrigation \nmanagement  companies  (IMCs)\u2014state-owned  public  utility  enterprises  responsible  for  the \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of large irrigation schemes\u2014display little service orientation \nor capacity to manage irrigation in a sustainable manner. Maintenance is frequently neglected in \nfavor of Government-financed periodic rehabilitation. At the tertiary level, water users have yet \nto be fully empowered to take water management decisions affecting their livelihoods. Critically, \nthere is a disconnect between the payment of water user fees and the delivery of water in the \ncorrect amounts and at the appropriate time. The institutional context and issues affecting \nirrigation performance are described in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Government's Strategy \n10.  The SEDP defines development objectives for the coming 5 years. It incorporates the \nfundamentals of Viet Nam\u2019s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy9 and the \npoverty reduction partnership agreement with ADB. To achieve the SEDP\u2019s aim of eliminating \nextreme poverty in rural areas, the Government will focus on poor regions and make better use \nof their development potential. In relation to agriculture, SEDP sets out several approaches to \nincrease returns:  \n \n  (i)  complete, rehabilitate, and modernize water infrastructure to ensure optimum use \nand conservation of water resources for irrigation, water supply, and industry; \n  (ii)  build the capacity of Government agencies at all levels to incorporate grassroots \ndemocracy in managing resources and delivering services; \n  (iii)  increase the role of users in O&M of irrigation systems; \n  (iv)  develop better natural disaster forecasting and warning capability; \n  (v)  become  more  responsive  to  the  requirements  of  international  markets  and \nincrease  export  competitiveness  by  diversifying  and  giving  more  attention  to \nquality; \n  (vi)  create greater opportunity for private sector development and intensify linkages \nbetween industry and agriculture; \n  (vii)  provide credit and more innovative loans for the poor; and \n  (viii)  give priority in social support programs to ethnic minorities and others whose \npoverty is more deeply entrenched, including poor women and children. \n \n11.  In 2004, MARD launched a national program to rehabilitate irrigation schemes and \nestablish a service-oriented approach where provincial agencies and the water users will be \nempowered to jointly manage irrigation schemes. In this way MARD aims to raise the efficiency \nof water delivery, realize the full potential of its investments, and reduce subsidies for O&M. \nRegulations  enabling  provinces  to  modify  the  structure  and  roles  of  their  departments  of \n                                                 \n9  The strategy focuses on three goals: (i) increased income in the rural sector through broad-based, sustainable and \nhigh quality growth; (ii) reduced income disparities, risks and vulnerability, and improved food security and social \nwell-being of the poor; and (iii) improved sustainability of natural resources in rural areas. The poverty reduction \npartnership agreement, signed by the Government and ADB in 2002, covers a subset of the objectives set out in \nthe strategy. ", "4 \nagriculture and rural development (DARDs) and to make concomitant changes in the IMCs will \nbe set in place by the beginning of 2006. This will enable and encourage the IMCs to develop \nbusiness plans based on needs rather than Government fiat, and to set user fees at realistic \nlevels subject to guaranteed service delivery. MARD has concurrently established a program to \naccelerate implementation of participatory irrigation management (PIM) with the objective of \ntransferring responsibility for O&M to farmers. This is being piloted under the Second Red River \nBasin Sector Project.10  \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n12.  ADB has supported water resource projects in Viet Nam from the early 1990s.11 Project \ncompletion reports prepared for two\u2014the Irrigation and Flood Protection Rehabilitation Project12 \nand the Red River Delta Water Resources Sector Project13\u2014highlight the limited gains that can \nbe achieved by physically improving irrigation schemes if commensurate attention is not given \nto the social, institutional, and regulatory frameworks within which they function. MARD, until \nrecently, has shown little interest in participatory processes for planning, design, and O&M of \ncompleted schemes. Its contracting experience before 1993 was exclusively with state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) for which fixed-cost norms (largely unrelated to market value) sidestepped \ntrue competition and worked against quality construction. MARD\u2019s inexperience with ADB's \nsafeguard policies and guidelines for procurement and selection of consultants led to inordinate \ndelays that were exacerbated by the Government's own complex and time-consuming review \nand approval procedures.  \n \n13.  Specific lessons related to project design are: (i) policy, regulatory, and institutional \nshortcomings\u2014particularly  the  low  capacity  of  institutions  at  provincial  and  lower  levels  of \ngovernment\u2014need to be fully recognized and addressed in the design phase; (ii) the capacity of \nexecuting and implementing agencies to incorporate social, environmental, and governance \naspects needs to be complemented by sustained technical assistance (TA); (iii) the number of \nsubprojects should be kept to a minimum and they should be straightforward and simple to \nimplement;14 (iv) irrigation water users should be engaged early in planning and design to \nensure that their needs are adequately reflected and to include, under project financing, the \nsmall-scale works needed to ensure equitable distribution of water at field level; (v) specific \nactions targeting women and female-headed households ensure more equitable distribution of \nbenefits in rural development projects;15 (vi) a whole river basin approach to the management of \nwater resources should be taken in areas with potential water scarcity; and (vii) greater attention \nneeds to be given to monitoring project performance, including establishing baseline conditions \nprior to project implementation. \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2001.

Analyses of ADB's projects in the sector have consistently shown that a broad, systems \napproach  is  needed  to  identify  constraints  and  the  means  of  overcoming  them.  Such  an \napproach draws development planners, implementers, operators, and users into a partnership \nfor  improved  project  design  and  scheme  management.  In  disaster  prone  areas,  improved \nperformance also depends on putting into place effective risk reduction measures. Achieving full \npotential  therefore  requires  practical  and  holistic  interventions  to  (i)  build  capacity  of  key \nstakeholder agencies at various levels, including introducing community-based, demand-driven \napproaches such as PIM; (ii) eliminate physical impediments to efficient scheme operation; and \n(iii) provide appropriate levels of support for project management. \n \n4.  ADB's Strategy for Water Sector Operations \n15.  When ADB resumed lending to Viet Nam in 1993, the country was the world\u2019s third \nlargest rice exporter. Nevertheless, the nation\u2019s water resources infrastructure, on which rice \nproduction and the welfare of a large segment of society depended, had deteriorated to a poor \ncondition. ADB supported the rehabilitation of large, functioning irrigation schemes to assure \ntheir continued operation, obtain rapid improvements in agricultural production and economic \ngrowth, and raise living conditions and quality of life.  \n \n16.  More  recently,  ADB's  emphasis  in  rural  development  has  shifted  to  balancing \ninfrastructure investments with livelihood support and capacity building, reflecting the adoption \nin 1999 of poverty reduction as ADB's overarching goal16 and the more general shift by the \nglobal development community in 2000 to the Millennium Development Goals as the benchmark \nfor monitoring poverty reduction. In response, the CSP 2002\u20132004 allocated one third of lending \nto the impoverished central region. With the new emphasis on livelihood support and poverty \ntargeting, project preparation became more participatory, but technical content became diluted \nand projects more complicated.17  \n \n17.  ADB, in close partnership with other lending and funding agencies, seeks to maximize \nthe economic growth and poverty reduction potential of water sector infrastructure investments \nby targeting poor regions, and incorporating institutional support and policy reforms in line with \nthe water policy.18 Hence, greater emphasis is now being given to improving water service \ndelivery, increasing the autonomy and accountability of service providers to meet the needs of \nthe poor, and establishing sustainable O&M through appropriate levels of cost recovery and \nuser participation. ADB is providing long-term capacity building for national, river basin, and \nprovincial IWRM to support its investment program.19 Concurrently, the Second Red River Basin \nSector Project is establishing IWRM in the Red River basin and building relevant institutional \ncapacity  in  MARD  and  the  provincial  agencies.  In  accordance  with  ADB's  disaster  and \nemergency assistance policy,20 all new projects incorporate disaster risk reduction measures to \nprepare for and avoid the worst impacts of natural disasters.  \n \n                                                 \n16 The three pillars of the poverty reduction strategy are pro-poor sustainable economic growth, social development, \nand good governance. \n17 ADB. 2004.

At the Government\u2019s request in 1998, ADB led the coordination of international assistance \nfor capacity building and implementation of water sector reforms under the Law on Water \nResources. Funding agency coordination in the water sector has been particularly effective: \nADB, Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the World Bank together support the work of the \nNational Water Resource Council (NWRC) through complementary tasks, with ADB taking a \nleading role, and it is already the practice for two or more funding agencies to jointly implement \na particular program or project in parallel or as co-financiers.  \n \n6.  Project Rationale \n19.  There is compelling evidence that rejuvenation of rural economies through accelerated \nagricultural  and  rural  development  is  essential  to  an  inclusive  growth  strategy,  not  just  to \nincrease agricultural production and rural incomes but also to buttress nonfarm and urban job \ncreation and to reduce migration of underemployed rural workers to urban centers.21 Continued, \ndeep, and lasting poverty reduction in the central coastal region depends on improving returns \nfrom  agriculture,  a  sector  whose  performance  is  held  back  by  physical  and  institutional \nconstraints. Transforming irrigated agriculture requires interventions to improve the performance \nof subnational agencies, delegate greater responsibility to them for investment decisions, and \nintroduce community-based, demand-driven approaches including PIM. \n \n20.  The  Project,  prepared  under  TA  4001-VIE,22  assumes  that  the  region\u2019s  irrigation \nschemes can best be improved by introducing service-oriented management systems that are \n(i) financially sound (cost-efficient); (ii) capable of meeting agreed service targets (effective); (iii) \nenabled  and  structured  to  prepare  work  plans,  budgets,  user  fees,  and  staff  plans \n(autonomous); and (iv) responsive to the needs of the client base (accountable). To realize \nproject objectives in a socially just manner, agencies involved in water resources management \nneed to be attuned to the special needs of disadvantaged segments of the communities to \nensure that the benefits of irrigation do not accrue only to the wealthier households, and that \nethnic minorities and female-headed households can equitably benefit from the Project. The \nProject recognizes that the participation of water user groups (WUGs) in the planning, design, \nimplementation, and O&M of subprojects is not only indispensable for sustainable operation, but \nis also a cost-efficient means of helping service providers meet their goals. Finally, the Project \nwill ensure that the basic irrigation infrastructure functions correctly in accordance with modern \ntechnical standards. The Project reflects the poverty reduction targets in the SEDP and the \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy and responds to the Government\u2019s \npolicy  to  improve  irrigation  by  making  water  service  delivery  more  decentralized  and \nparticipatory. The concepts have been tested in pilot projects, and project design draws heavily \non the recommendations23 for multi-stakeholder participation.24 \n \n                                                 \n21  ADB.  2004.

Impact and Outcome \n21.  The Project\u2019s impact will be reduced poverty in six central provinces (Appendix 3).25 The \nProject\u2019s outcome will be increased agricultural production in selected irrigation subprojects.26 \nAbout 400,500 people, 38% of whom live below the poverty line of $0.33 per person per day, \nwill benefit directly from the Project.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n22.  The Project\u2019s outputs will be (i) cost-efficient, effective, accountable, and autonomous \nwater service providers working in partnership with client water users to manage irrigation \nschemes;  and  (ii)  rehabilitated  and  completed  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure \nincorporating measures to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters within selected schemes.  \n \n23.  In each target province, the provincial people's committee (PPC), DARD, and irrigation \nmanagement companies (IMCs)27 are eager to modernize the management of their irrigation \nschemes and make water service delivery more decentralized and participatory. Subprojects \nwere  selected  and  feasibility  studies  conducted  during  project  processing  with  the  close \nparticipation  of  stakeholders,  including  water  user  representatives.  Subprojects  and  their \ncomponent works satisfy the following agreed criteria: (i) financially and economically viable, (ii) \ncontributing strongly to poverty reduction, (iii) environmentally sustainable, (iv) compliant with \nprinciples  of  IWRM,  and  (v)  responsive  to  natural  disaster  risk  reduction  initiatives.  Their \ndetailed design and construction will be implemented according to standards and procedures \ndeveloped  jointly  with  the  provinces  during  project  preparation.  The  Project  has  two \ncomponents: \n \n1.  Irrigation Management Systems Improved \na.  Establish Financially Viable Service Providers \n24.  The Project will help DARD prepare business plans for the autonomous operation of the \nirrigation service providers (IMCs) covering each subproject. Various options will be considered \nfor restructuring the unprofitable providers in line with the Government's SOE reform agenda \n(including conversion to public utilities or joint-stock companies, or transferring full ownership of \nassets to WUGs). Differences among the provinces will be accommodated.28 The Project will \nrestructure the IMCs in each project province subject to satisfactory business plans approved by \nthe PPC and ADB (para. 33). \n \n25.  Each  IMC  will  develop  its  own  business  plan,  assisted  as  necessary  by  project \nconsultants, in close consultation with other relevant stakeholder agencies: MARD, DARD, the \nPPC,  the  department  of  natural  resources  and  environment  (DoNRE),  the  department  of \n                                                 \n25 Binh Dinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, Quang Tri, Thanh Hoa, and Thua Thien Hue provinces. \n26 These are the Tay Nam Huong Tra, La Tinh, My Trung, Thach Han, Thach Thanh, and Tra Cau schemes which \ntotal about 57,755 ha. \n27 IMCs may encompass several irrigation management enterprises each serving one or more irrigation schemes. \n28 The provinces have different organizational arrangements for IMCs and irrigation management enterprises (IMEs) \naccording to their needs. In Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, and Thua Thien Hue, provincial or river basin IMCs manage \nirrigation. In 2003, Thanh Hoa established three river basin IMCs following the downgrading of individual scheme \nIMCs to IMEs. In Binh Dinh, one provincial IMC incorporates five IMEs. In Quang Tri, the three river basin IMCs are \nsoon to be downgraded to IMEs managed by a new provincial umbrella IMC. ", "8 \nplanning and investment (DPI), agricultural cooperatives, and water users. The business plans \nwill set out a time-bound program for achieving financial sustainability through structural and \nother  changes  to  the  organization  and  staffing,  and  will  describe  key  functions,  service \nrequirements,  equipment  and  skills,  budgets,  information  flows,  accounting  procedures, \nperformance monitoring, and financing plans. The plans will include support for the formation \nand strengthening of WUGs and water user associations (WUAs)\u2014umbrella associations of \nWUGs\u2014that can be contracted for O&M previously done by IMCs. Agreed annual targets and \nmilestones will form part of the business plan and their achievement will trigger the release of \nproject funds for further change and support.29 Transforming IMCs into financially autonomous, \nefficient  organizations  will,  of  necessity,  be  gradual.30  State  subsidies  will  be  decreased \nincrementally as management systems improve.  \n \n26.  As  a  precondition  for  successful  PIM  (paras.  27\u201329),  the  awareness,  skills,  and \nknowledge of staff in the PPC, DARD, DoNRE, DPI, and IMCs need to be improved. The \nProject will train relevant staff members in (i) understanding and supporting institutional reform \nfor improved irrigation management; (ii) skill development for irrigation scheme O&M; (iii) social \nimpact assessments; and (iv) managing irrigation to achieve greater poverty reduction, gender \nequality, and community participation. \n \nb.  Strengthen Water User Participation \n27.  Working through MARD\u2019s department of water resources (DWR),31 the Project will help \nestablish WUGs on the basis of hydraulic boundaries, replacing (in most cases) the user groups \nthat are linked to cooperatives and based on administrative boundaries. Inevitably, this will \nremove part of the cooperatives\u2019 revenue-generating responsibilities for O&M and will therefore \nmeet with some resistance. Hence, the development of a set of agreed principles that are \nendorsed by MARD, DARD, and the PPCs will be a prerequisite. National, provincial, and \ndistrict  workshops  will  raise  awareness  of  PIM,32  develop  province-specific  guidelines  and \nregulations (conforming with MARD\u2019s directives), and gain consensus among stakeholders for \nthe new WUGs. \n \n28.  The Project will engage a suitable local institution in each province (university, research \ninstitute, consulting firm, or nongovernment organization [NGO]) to help set up WUGs. The main \nsteps in the process will be participatory assessment of the needs and capabilities of existing \nWUGs;  sensitization  of  farmers  and  local  leaders  to  the  implications  of  WUG  (and  IMC) \nrestructuring;  development  of  guidelines  for  WUG  operations  and  management,  including \nincreasing participation by female farmers; reaching agreement with IMCs on the mandates, \nstructure,  and  membership  of  the  WUGs;  and  training  of  WUG  leaders  in  their  new \nresponsibilities. For large irrigation schemes, WUAs will be set up to represent WUGs. \n \n29.  The fledgling WUGs/WUAs will be assisted to prepare applications for the granting of \nlegal status. The aim will be to register them as organizations that can raise funds, open bank \naccounts, and enter into contracts for construction and O&M of the facilities within their service \nareas (para. 42). Release of project funds to help the WUGs/WUAs become appropriately \n                                                 \n29  Project  financing  will  cover  such  items  as  upgrading  buildings  and  fixed  assets,  purchasing  vehicles  and \nequipment, and setting up new management systems. \n30 The shedding of staff will be particularly difficult in some cases. \n31 DWR has been designated to coordinate the PIM program and to liaise with national, provincial, and lower \nauthorities to incorporate PIM in all new irrigation investment projects. \n32 Strong support for PIM was expressed in the regional MARD/ADB workshop on provincial pilot programs for \nimproving public irrigation services held in Hue on 12 May 2005. ", "  9\nconstituted organizations will be subject to approval of the applications for legal status by the \nrelevant  authority.  In  general,  capital-intensive  maintenance  and  the  operation  of  large \ninfrastructure will remain the responsibility of IMCs,33 with WUGs/WUAs contracted to provide \nmainly  unskilled  labor.  Hence,  where  ownership  of  secondary  and  higher  canals  is  to  be \ntransferred to WUGs/WUAs, the IMC will remain responsible for complicated or large O&M. \n \nc.  Develop On-Farm Infrastructure \n30.  In newly constructed irrigation schemes, the key to achieving the expected agricultural \nbenefits is timely development of the on-farm works needed for irrigated agriculture. The Project \nwill support a participatory process, starting with design of tertiary canal layouts based on the \nselected cropping patterns and topographical constraints, for which farmers\u2019 knowledge of local \nconditions is essential. Farmers will provide labor under contract to build the tertiary units, \nmainly earthworks, boosting their incomes during the development (fallow) period (para. 42).34  \n \nd.  Operationalize Project Performance Management System \n31.  The  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS),  based  on  management \ninformation software linked to a geographic information system (GIS), will be designed and put \ninto operation in close consultation with the Central Project Office (CPO) and DARD. Initial \nconditions determined through baseline surveys in each subproject will be updated every 6 \nmonths by DARD, the IMCs, and the WUGs/WUAs. CPO and DARD will be trained in managing \nand updating the PPMS at central and provincial or scheme levels. \n \ne.  Implement Gender Action Plan and HIV/AIDS Awareness Program \n32.  Although female-headed households comprise up to 48% of households in some parts \nof  the  project  area,  female  farmers  encounter  many  impediments  to  their  participation  in \neconomic activities and leadership roles. Nevertheless, women assume a disproportionately \nhigh share of the burden of farm labor and are poorer than men. A gender action plan (GAP) \nhas been prepared for each subproject to ensure more equitable distribution of benefits and to \nimprove the participation of female farmers in system O&M. The GAP will be underpinned by \ngender sensitization programs for staff of DARD and the IMCs. To magnify the impact of gender \nawareness and to reach the widest possible female target for leadership training, agricultural \nextension services, and building business management skills, the Project will train staff of the \nVietnam Women\u2019s Union (VWU) as trainers. The Project will thereafter support training led by \ntrained VWU staff. The Project will also support HIV/AIDS-related awareness raising to counter \nthe risk of HIV/AIDS among male and female migrant workers and to reduce risks of infection \namong local populations through in-migration of construction workers. The program will target \nhigh-risk population groups, including contractors, construction workers, and migrants. \n \n2.  Irrigation Infrastructure Improved \na.  Complete Detailed Design of Subprojects \n33.  The Project will finance rehabilitation and construction of irrigation and drainage works, \nincluding  natural  disaster  risk  reduction  measures,  in  six  subprojects,  for  which  feasibility \n                                                 \n33 User groups do not generally have the technical skills needed to operate or assure quality maintenance of large \ninfrastructure, and they do not have the financial means to undertake such work on their own. \n34 There will be many unpaid contributions by farmers to on-farm development, most of which cannot be estimated \nand have not been included as project costs.  ", "10 \nstudies have been completed. Detailed design and preparation of contract documentation for \nthese will be done using local consulting firms selected by the provincial project management \nunits (PPMUs) in each province (or CPMU for major works).35 Award of civil works contracts for \nany subproject will follow (i) approval of the relevant IMC\u2019s business plan by the PPC and ADB; \n(ii) completion of resettlement and compensation for the subproject according to its resettlement \nplan;  and  (iii)  approval  by  MARD,  DARD,  and  ADB  of  its  design,  cost  estimate,  and \nimplementation arrangements.  \n \n34.  Project-financed  consultants  will  help  DARD  update  the  (i)  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  (ii)  resettlement  plan36 \n(Appendix 4), (iii) GAP (Supplementary Appendix A), (iv) ethnic minority development plan \n(EMDP)37  (Appendix  5),  and  (v)  on-farm  development  plan,  and  implement  them.  The \nparticipatory processes that were developed and applied during project preparation will be \nreinforced during project implementation. Brief summaries of the civil works in each subproject \nare given below.  \n \n35.  Thach  Thanh  Subproject  (Thanh  Hoa  Province).  The  subproject  comprises  the \nfollowing works to improve water delivery for irrigated rice and sugarcane: (i) rehabilitation of 3 \nexisting and construction of 10 new pumping stations lifting water from the Buoi River to serve \n2,280  ha;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  eight  small  storage  reservoirs  and  construction  of  one  new \nreservoir  to  serve  1,291  ha;  (iii)  construction  of  about  90  km  of  earth  canals  to  replace \ndeteriorated concrete flumes; and (iv) rehabilitation of Bai Muong weir. \n \n36.  Thuong  My  Trung  Subproject  (Quang  Binh  Province).  The  main  works  to  be \nimplemented are (i) 82 km of embankment, (ii) rehabilitation of 66 existing and construction of \n23 new sluice gates, (iii) rehabilitation of 25 existing and construction of 15 new pumping \nstations,  and  (iv)  related  bridges  and  aqueducts.  The  subproject  will  improve  irrigation, \ndrainage, and flood protection around Hac Hai lagoon to enable two rice crops on 870 ha above \nmean  sea  level  and  3,318  ha  below  sea  level.  Rice  cropping  will  be  supplemented  by \naquaculture.  \n \n37.  Thach Han Subproject (Quang Tri Province). The scheme, designed in the 1970s to \nirrigate 17,000 ha, was never completed because of water shortages. Its completion can now be \nrealized because the Rao Quan reservoir, now under construction by \u00c9lecticit\u00e9 de Vietnam, will \nincrease water availability and render the subproject feasible. The completed scheme will allow \nfull production on 13,867 ha. The works comprise (i) upgrading the Thach Han headworks38 and \ncanal system (including lining 13 km of main canal and 45 km of primary and lower canals) and \n(ii) construction of Ben Da weir to serve 350 ha. \n \n38.  Tay Nam Huong Tra Subproject (Thua Thien Hue Province). The scheme is badly \ndeteriorated and suffers from poor drainage in some parts, exacerbated by brackish water in the \n                                                 \n35 Any subprojects or discrete components of subprojects that are found at the detailed design stage to have low \neconomic returns or unacceptable environmental or social impacts will be dropped from the Project. \n36 During detailed design, every effort will be made to reduce the need for relocation of households. The updated \nresettlement plans will be submitted to ADB for approval and will be disclosed to project-affected people.  \n37 An EMDP will be implemented in the Tra Cau subproject to accommodate specific needs of the Hre ethnic group. \nDetailed design of the subprojects will include screening to identify any significant ethnic minority impacts that were \nnot discerned during the project preparatory studies. If the screening shows that ethnic minority groups would be at \na disadvantage in the development process or would encounter constraints on their ability to enjoy project benefits, \nthen an EMDP will be prepared in accordance with the framework in Appendix 5. Particular attention will be given \nto the Thach Thanh scheme in Than Hoa Province (para. 68). \n38 Headworks means the structure or group of structures controlling the quantity of water entering a major canal. ", " 11\nHuong River, its main source of supply. The Thao Long barrier at the mouth of the Huong River, \ndesigned to prevent saline intrusion, is under construction and will be completed within 2005. \nThe works comprise (i) enlarging the Khe Ngang reservoir, serving 50 ha; (ii) constructing 8.6 \nkm of new main canal; (iii) raising the spillway of the Tho Son reservoir, serving 260 ha; (iv) \nupgrading the 3-, 5- and 7-community canals; and (v) constructing a pumping station and \nassociated culverts and sluices at Nam Thanh to improve drainage on 300 ha. \n \n39.  Tra Cau Subproject (Quang Ngai Province). The subproject comprises the Liet Son-\nChop Vung, Nui Ngang, and Dien Truong irrigation schemes, in the southern part of the Tra Cau \nriver basin. These were never completed and have deteriorated since construction in the 1980s. \nThe works comprise (i) construction of the Chop Vung reservoir to serve 700 ha; (ii) heightening \nthe dam and spillway of the Dien Truong reservoir and rehabilitating and extending the canal \nsystem, including construction of an access road to the dam; and (iii) completion of primary and \nlower level canals in the Nui Ngang system.  \n \n40.  La Tinh Subproject (Binh Dinh Province). Because of its deterioration, much of which \nresulted from flood damage, only about 1,800 ha of a total command area of 3,950 ha are \ncurrently irrigated. The works comprise (i) reconstruction of the Cay Ke weir to serve 1,000 ha, \n(ii) lining 80 km of irrigation canal and rehabilitation of canal structures, (iii) rehabilitation of 21.5 \nkm of flood protection embankments between Phu Ly bridge and Cay Ke weir and between La \nTinh and the Can River, and (iii) rehabilitation of three flood diversion/retention spillways \n \nb.  Implement Subprojects \n41.  MARD  and  DARD  will  supervise  and  manage  the  six  subprojects.  MARD  has \nconsiderable experience using competitively selected contractors, much of it in implementing \nADB- and World Bank-financed projects. The works are simple and will mostly be constructed, \nin about 43 contract packages, using local contractors. Project-financed consultants will assist \nwith tendering and construction supervision. Particular attention will be paid to construction \nquality, which has often been deficient. Effective monitoring and evaluation procedures will be \nincluded, consistent with the PPMS. \n \n42.  Subject to the successful restructuring of the existing, cooperative-linked WUGs and \ntheir conversion into legally and economically constituted WUGs and WUAs, construction of \nlower canals and simple structures will be implemented by WUGs/WUAs. This will generally be \nmore cost-efficient and effective than constructing such minor works using outside contractors. \nIt will also provide valuable experience for subsequent O&M and inject much-needed cash into \nthe local economy.  \n \nc.  Resettle and Compensate Affected Persons \n43.  In close consultation with the provincial agencies, the project preparatory consultants \nprepared resettlement plans for the six subprojects in accordance with the requirements of \nADB's resettlement policy39 and guidelines. These align closely with the Government\u2019s new \nresettlement policies and principles (adopted in December 2004). A census and inventory of lost \nassets were carried out for all households potentially affected by loss of land and structures for \nthe irrigation canals and reservoir areas. A total of about 420 ha will be required to make way for \nconstruction, of which 310 ha will be permanently acquired (Appendix 4).  \n \n                                                 \n39 ADB. 1995.

For the Tra Cau subproject, villagers from Ho Sau village (affected by \nconstruction  of  the  Chop  Vung  reservoir)  have  elected  to  relocate  to  Pho  Ninh,  where  a \nresettlement site will be fully developed (with physical infrastructure, houses, irrigation, water \nand electricity supply, roads, school, and village administration buildings) before their relocation. \nAll  relocated  households  will  be  provided  with  resettlement  assistance,  including  materials \ntransport, transition subsistence, and income restoration allowance.  \n \n45.  Severely affected farmers will be offered the option of replacement wherever possible, or \ncash compensation sufficient to purchase replacement land of equivalent area and productivity. \nCompensation for structures will be paid at full replacement cost of material and labor without \ndeduction for depreciation or salvageable materials. The livelihood development measures will \nlink with the interventions included in the GAP and EMDP. All costs related to resettlement and \ncompensation  will  be  paid  for  by  the  Government.  PPC  staff  members  will  implement \nresettlement plans with assistance from DARD and project-financed local consultants. \n \nd.  Implement Environmental Management Plans \n46.  In consultation with the provincial agencies, the IEE for each subproject and a summary \nIEE (Supplementary Appendix B) for the whole Project have been prepared in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  environment  policy40  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines.41  The  IEE  was \napproved by the DoNRE of each project province. The EMP for each subproject, developed as \npart of the IEE, will be updated during detailed design. In collaboration with DoNRE and the \ndepartment of fishery, a detailed site-specific EMP will be prepared to guide each PPMU in \nimplementing  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  monitoring  during  construction  and \noperation phases. \n \nC.  Special Features \n47.  Inclusive Development. Social and institutional analyses were done by the project \npreparatory consultants and these were complemented by participatory pilot and demonstration \nactivities by CARE International in Vietnam42 and World Vision Viet Nam.43 The social groups \nand other stakeholders in each subproject were  identified, and their interests,  needs, and \nexpectations  determined.  The  related  surveys,  discussion  group  activities,  and  workshops \nfamiliarized  local  communities  with  project  objectives;  identified  disadvantaged  groups; \ndetermined  the  potential  for  user  involvement  in  project  implementation  (design, \nimplementation, monitoring, and O&M); established baseline indicators; and brought to the fore \nspecific  interventions  that  should  be  included  to  spread  project  benefits  equitably. \nRecommended approaches for improving participation in irrigation development to make the \ninvestment more inclusive (specific to the subprojects under this Project but also generally \napplicable to irrigation development in Viet Nam) were published (footnote 23) and have been \ndrawn upon to formulate the Project.  \n \n48.  Institutional Change. Government at all levels is enthusiastic about improving irrigation \nby making its management more decentralized and participatory. This presents an opportunity \n                                                 \n40  ADB. 2002. Environment Policy. Manila. \n41 ADB. 2003. Environment Assessment Guidelines.

It will help bring to agriculture the benefits of SOE reforms that have \nbeen so effective in more industrialized sectors. In some cases, the Project may help privatize \nIMCs, or at least lay the groundwork for this to happen. This, coupled with strong support for \nPIM, will place the Project at the forefront of the Government's reform agenda in irrigated \nagriculture.  Transferring  publicly  held  assets  to  legally  constituted  WUGs  and  WUAs  will \nempower water users to take part in decisions that affect their well-being and increase scheme \nsustainability.  \n \n49.  Sustainability. The Project will engage suitable local institutions in each province to \nhelp create legally constituted WUGs and WUAs. This will help develop important skills within \nViet Nam to continue the institutional reforms being supported under the Project. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n50.  The total project cost, including contingencies, taxes, and duties, is estimated to be \n$99.0 million. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at $37.8 million or 38% of the total project \ncost. The local currency cost including taxes is $61.2 million or 62% of the total project cost. \nCost estimates are in Appendix 6. \n \nTable 1: Project Cost Summary by Output ($ million) \n \nForeign  Local \nOutput  Total Cost \nExchange  Currency \n A.

MARD will act as the Executing Agency. The director of CPO in Hanoi \nwill be the project director. CPO will set up a central project management unit (CPMU) to (i) \nprovide overall management and coordination of the Project, (ii) liaise with PPC and DARD in \neach province to improve irrigation management systems, (iii) guide and coordinate DARD to \nimprove irrigation infrastructure, (iv) implement the PPMS, (v) procure consulting services, 44 (vi) \ncoordinate with the PPMU in each province to procure goods and services through international \ncompetitive bidding (see para. 56), (vii) prepare forecasts of contract awards and disbursements \nand arrange project account audits, (viii) prepare major reports covering the whole Project by \nconsolidating the reports from each province, and (ix) prepare the project completion report. \nProject management consultants will assist the CPMU. \n \n53.  The vice minister of MARD will head a project steering committee (PSC) set up to \nprovide policy and strategy advice and to communicate project outcomes with other ministries. \nThe PSC will comprise representatives at the director level of the ministries of planning and \ninvestment, finance, and natural resources and environment; the Office of Government; and the \nState Bank of Vietnam. The organization chart for project implementation is in Appendix 7.  \n \n54.  Provincial Level. In each province PPMU will be created under the direct administration \nof DARD. Each PPMU will be headed by a full-time subproject manager with qualifications \nacceptable  to  ADB.  PPMU,  assisted  by  consultants,  will  improve  irrigation  management \nsystems (output 1), improve irrigation infrastructure (output 2), procure goods and services \nusing local competitive bidding, operationalize the PPMS, and implement resettlement, EMP, \nGAP, HIV/AIDS awareness program, and (in the Tra Cau subproject) an EMDP. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n55.  The Project will be implemented over 5\u00bd years beginning in 2006 (Appendix 8).  \n \n3.  Procurement \n56.  Civil works, goods, and related services will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $2  million \nequivalent will be procured through international competitive bidding among pre-qualified firms \nwith proven technical competence acceptable to ADB. Civil works contracts estimated to cost $2 \nmillion or less will be procured through local competitive bidding procedures. SOEs will be \n                                                 \n44 Other than domestic consulting services to be used only for a particular subproject. ", " 15\neligible to bid for contracts if they are financially autonomous, independently managed, and \noperate on the basis of commercial practice.  \n \n57.  Equipment to be procured under the Project includes vehicles, motorcycles, computers, \nsoftware,  and  water  quality  monitoring  equipment.45  Such  equipment  will  be  procured  by \ninternational competitive bidding where the cost is more than $1 million, international shopping \nwhere the cost is $500,000 to $1 million per package, and local competitive bidding where the \ncost is less than $500,000. Where local suppliers are few, procurement may be made by direct \npurchase, with a threshold of $100,000, as will be the case for negotiated service contracts with \nNGOs. Indicative procurement packages are shown in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Consulting Services \n58.  The Project will require 227 person-months of domestic and 103 person-months of \ninternational consultants. The consultants will build the capacity of MARD and DARD to (i) \ndevelop and operationalize IMC business plans, (ii) create and operationalize PPMS using a \nGIS, and (iii) coordinate and supervise project implementation. At the central level, expertise will \nbe required in institutional development, water resources and irrigation planning, information \ndatabases, gender, environment, sociology, and GIS. At the provincial level, expertise will be \nrequired  in  institutional  development,  business  strategic  planning,  financial  and  economic \nmanagement, irrigation, data processing, legal processes, agronomy, and PIM. Local consulting \nfirms, NGOs, and institutions will be engaged to provide training,46 implement the GAP and \nHIV/AIDS awareness program, create WUGs/WUAs, complete the final design of works and \nhelp supervise their construction, and monitor performance. All consulting firms, NGOs, and \ninstitutions will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.47  \n \n4.  Anticorruption Measures \n59.  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  MARD. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of MARD and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers to the \nProject. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n60.  The Government will open a first-generation imprest account in a bank acceptable to \nADB,  into  which  loan  funds  from  ADB  will  be  deposited,  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (January 2001), updated from time to time. Similarly, each of the \nproject provinces will establish a second-generation imprest account, in a bank acceptable to \nADB, for local project expenditures. The total combined advances in the first- and second-\n                                                 \n45  Equipment to be incorporated into civil works, such as fabricated steel and other special components, electrical \nand mechanical equipment, pumps, and motors, will be included in the civil works contracts.  \n46 Including a program to educate WUGs/WUAs in relation to legal empowerment and legal literacy. \n47 The quality- and cost-based selection method will be used for the selection of international consultants. ", "16 \ngeneration imprest accounts at any time during project implementation will not be greater than \nthe estimated expenditure for the coming 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nlower.  The  ceiling  of  the  second-generation  imprest  account  in  each  province  will  be  the \nestimated local expenditure for the coming 6 months or $500,000, whichever is lower. Payments \nto  civil  works  contractors  will  be  made  directly  by  ADB,  or  from  the  imprest  accounts  as \nappropriate (see fund flow arrangement in Appendix 7). For payments up to $100,000, ADB's \nstatement of expenditures procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to \nliquidate advances. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n61.  CPO, assisted by the CPMU, will monitor and consolidate accounts for each province \nand  prepare  a  separate  account  for  the  Project  as  a  whole.  Within  12  months  of  loan \neffectiveness, CPMU will establish a computerized management information system suited to \nthe financial management and reporting needs of the Project. A qualified firm will be recruited to \naudit  project  accounts  annually.  The  audited  accounts  and  auditor's  report  (including  the \nauditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  operations)  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB not more than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n \n62.  Each agency directly involved in the Project (MARD, PPC, DARD) will prepare progress \nreports every 6 months. These will be submitted within 1 month to CPO for consolidation at the \nproject level and submission to ADB. The reports will describe progress in achieving design and \nmonitoring framework targets (Appendix 3), any problems encountered and steps taken to \nresolve them, and activities for the next reporting period. MARD will prepare and submit a \nproject completion report in the standard ADB format not more than 6 months after the physical \ncompletion of the Project. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n63.  The basis for project performance monitoring and evaluation will be the design and \nmonitoring framework and the baseline surveys specified in it (Appendix 3). NGOs will be \nengaged to lead participatory baseline surveys in each irrigation subproject, and to conduct \nfollow-up surveys to monitor change. MARD will also monitor the Project as part of ADB\u2019s \nstandard procedures for disbursement of funds and progress reporting.  \n \n8.  Project Review \n64.  ADB will conduct semiannual reviews facilitated by MARD. The reviews will (i) examine \nthe  appropriateness  of  implementation  arrangements  and  schedules  of  activities,  including \nfunds flow; (ii) assess the level of farmer participation in project activities; (iii) review compliance \nwith agreed procurement procedures; (iv) analyze the outcomes of the capacity building and \ntraining programs; and (v) monitor the effectiveness of safeguard procedures. A comprehensive \nmidterm project review will be undertaken jointly by ADB and the Government. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Social Benefits and Impacts \n65.  Beneficiaries. About 400,500 people in the subproject areas will benefit from increased \nagricultural income and more jobs. Many of them will benefit from natural disaster risk reduction \nand improved water supply for domestic use.  ", " 17\n \n66.  Poverty Reduction. About 38% of the beneficiary households of the subprojects are \nbelow the poverty line of $0.33 per person per day,48 well above the national average of 24%. \nFarm benefits (after financing) with the Project would be D8 million\u2013D15 million for a farm of 1 \nha,  compared  with  D3  million\u2013D9  million  without  the  project.  Generally,  farm  benefits  are \nexpected to double and lift at least 6,000 households above the poverty line. The social analysis \nshowed that the burden of poverty in the project area is disproportionately borne by women. \nFemale-headed households constitute on average 25% of all households in the project area. \nThey are particularly vulnerable to poverty on account of their limited access to land, adult labor, \ncredit, capital, and technology. Fewer female-headed than male-headed households derive their \nmain income from agriculture and forestry activities and a much higher proportion derive their \nmain income from wage labor. A GAP will be implemented to help counter these imbalances. A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n67.  Gender and Development. The GAP will ensure that female farmers, female-headed \nhouseholds, and women of ethnic minority communities are targeted for (i) capacity building for \neffective participation in planning and decision making, (ii) representation in WUGs/WUAs, and \n(iii) health education focused on managing risks of HIV/AIDS. Training of female farmers by \nVWU staff members will cover leadership and decision making, participatory water resources \nplanning, and business management of organizations. Staff members of DARD and the IMCs \nwill join gender sensitization programs to build their capacity and skills to deliver services \neffectively to female farmers. The PPMU will ensure that the Project\u2019s agricultural extension and \ntraining  programs  will  have  not  less  than  40%  female  trainees.  All  WUGs/WUAs  to  be \ndeveloped under the Project will have female membership of not less than 40%. The Project will \nsupport HIV/AIDS-related awareness raising to counter the risk of HIV/AIDS among male and \nfemale  migrant  workers  and  reduce  risks  of  infection  among  local  populations  through  in-\nmigration of construction workers. The program will target high-risk population groups, including \ncontractors, construction workers, migrants. \n \n68.  Disadvantaged Groups and Ethnic Minorities. In four subproject areas, the ethnic \nminority population is small (less than 5%) and inter-mixed with Kinh and, in accordance with \nADB's  policy  on  indigenous  peoples,49  the  Project  should  not  make  distinctions  based  on \nethnicity. The Project will identify and assist all poor and vulnerable households regardless of \nethnicity. In the Thach Thanh scheme (Thanh Hoa Province) the Muong represent 58% of the \npopulation but they are totally integrated with the Kinh, having adopted Kinh style of dress, \nlanguage, farming methods, and social systems. They no longer maintain any traditions or \ncustoms  that  reflect  a  uniqueness  or  potential  vulnerability  of  culture.  For  the  Tra  Cau \nsubproject (Quang Ngai Province) where a commune of 100% Hre people will lose land, an \nEMDP has been prepared (Appendix 5). \n \nB.  Environmental Impacts \n69.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  It  will  improve  agricultural \nproduction and water supply for domestic use and render the subproject areas less vulnerable \nto natural disasters. The Project will change land use irreversibly in scattered small areas, but \nthe environmental impacts will be minor because changes in cropped and forested areas will be \nsmall. The Project will have limited environmental impacts during construction and operation. \n                                                 \n48  A threshold of D1.7 million per person per year (or D150,000 per person per month) has been used, because the \nMinistry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs standard (and that used by the provinces) is considered to be a less \naccurate reflection of poverty. \n49 ADB. 1998. Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila ", "18 \nEnvironmental impacts related to construction are short term and will be mitigated to acceptable \nlevels with the proposed mitigation measures and good engineering practice. Potential long-\nterm impacts such as water pollution caused by increased use of chemicals for irrigation and \naquaculture  will  be  minimized  with  ongoing  chemical-use  training  and  the  proposed  water \nquality monitoring. Although it has been concluded that a detailed EIA for each subproject is not \nrequired, this will be reexamined during detailed design. \n \nC.  Financial and Economic Benefits \n70.  Quantified  Benefits.  The  main  project  benefits  are  from  incremental  output  of \nagricultural production, deriving from (i) higher cropping intensities, especially in areas under \nrain-fed cultivation; (ii) higher yields because of reliable and full irrigation water supply; and (iii) \nincremental output from shrimp and fish farming. The main crops cultivated in the subproject \nareas are rice, sugarcane, groundnut, and maize. The subprojects would increase the cultivated \narea from 52,432 ha without the Project to 57,755 ha with the Project. Aquaculture development \ntakes place in Thuong My Trung with over 3,000 ha, based on fish raising in rice fields during \nthe summer and autumn; in Tra Cau with 450 ha of shrimp raising in the winter and spring and \n300 ha in the summer and autumn seasons, in La Tinh with 300 ha of shrimp raising in the \nwinter and spring and in the summer and autumn, and in south Thach Han with 200 ha of \nshrimp farming.  \n \n71.  Nonquantified  Benefits.  The  Project  will  significantly  change  the  way  irrigation \nschemes are managed in the subprojects, giving much greater autonomy to IMCs and water \nuser  groups,  reducing  transaction  costs  at  all  levels  of  their  operations,  and  helping  the \nGovernment phase out subsidies for O&M in the benefiting schemes. Roads to be constructed \nunder the Project will provide better rural transportation and access to markets. Increased \nagricultural  production  will  contribute  to  the  agricultural  processing  industry  in  the  areas, \nespecially in sugar factories. Increased incomes will be reflected in increased trade in nonfarm \ngoods  and  services.  The  Project  will  reduce  poverty  in  some  remote  areas  with  a  high \nproportion of ethnic minority groups.  \n \n72.  Economic Evaluation. The estimated Project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is \n15% including institutional strengthening inputs. All subprojects are economically viable with \nEIRRs of 14\u201317%. Sensitivity analyses show that the economic feasibility of the subprojects is \nsensitive to (i) the success of aquaculture development, especially in the Thuong My Trung, Tra \nCau, and La Tinh subprojects; and (ii) the timing of agricultural development, which is strongly \nrelated  to  completion  of  tertiary  canals  and  related  on-farm  development.  The  economic \nfeasibility of the subprojects is less sensitive to changes in investment cost. The financial and \neconomic evaluation is in Appendix 11. \n \nD.  Risks \n73.  The main risks arise from delays in realizing benefits\u2014the Project\u2019s economic viability is \nsensitive to this. Possible causes of delay are slowness in recruiting consultants and appointing \nappropriate central and provincial project management staff, resistance of vested interests to \nchanges in organizational structure of service providers (IMCs and agricultural cooperatives), \ncumbersome administrative processes related to contract awards, and insensitive handling of \nresettlement. Resettlement and compensation of people affected by construction are on the \ncritical path because the award of civil works contracts is conditional upon their prior completion. \nProject  consultants  will  help  the  provincial  authorities  complete  resettlement  on  schedule. ", " 19\nMARD has experience in, and a good understanding of Government and ADB requirements for \nresettlement. \n \n74.  Slow  farmer  adoption  of  irrigated  agricultural  production  systems  could  delay  the \nbenefits. The economic analysis assumes that the whole target command area will be irrigated \nby the completion of each subproject or shortly after, and that cropping systems will have been \nadapted in the third year after completion. Three factors are expected to minimize these risks. \nFirst, farmers usually respond quickly if they have access to water, and if special attention is \ngiven  to  agricultural  extension  and  other  support  services.  Second,  experience  in  and \nknowledge of irrigated agriculture are widespread because a large part of the subproject areas \nis  being  irrigated.  Third,  beneficiary  participation  specifically  supported  by  the  Project  will \nincrease  farmers\u2019  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  restructuring  IMCs  and  the  concomitant \nconceding of powers to WUGs/WUAs, and will have involved farmers closely in the planning \nand implementation (often as contracted labor) of on-farm development. Agriculture extension \nservices will support rapid uptake by disseminating information and demonstrating improved \ntechniques. With this amount of support, a high level of participation should be assured. \n \n75.  Although MARD and the provincial agencies are experienced in implementing physical \nworks, there are less so in the participatory and integrated approach needed for this Project. \nThe strong support of MARD (through DWR), Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, \nMinistry of Finance, and Ministry of Planning and Investment at central level, and of PPC, DPI, \nDARD, and DoNRE at the provincial level will be critical to achieving the desired institutional \nchanges. These changes will require shifts in strategies, regulations, and guidelines relating to \nirrigation service delivery. Overcoming these risks will be the Project\u2019s most important task.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n76.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MARD have given the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n  (i)  Business plans. Each project-related IMC will develop its own business plan for \nachieving financial sustainability through structural and organizational changes, \nincluding definition of key functions, service, equipment and skills requirements, \nbudgets,  information  flows,  accounting  procedures,  performance  monitoring, \nwater pricing strategy, and financing plan. Business plans shall set out annual \ntargets and milestones, the achievement of which will trigger release of project \nfunds to IMCs. Each business plan will need to be approved by a respective \nPPC, and to be satisfactory to ADB.  \n  (ii)  WUGs/WUAs. Release of project funds to a WUG/WUA will be subject to its \nbeing registered as a legal entity by the respective provincial authority.  \n  (iii)  Water fees. By the end of the second year of project implementation, water fees \nwill be determined and established in accordance with IMCs\u2019 business plan to \nachieve  and  maintain  the  financial  autonomy  of  IMCs  and  WUGs  (i.e.,  full \nrecovery of O&M costs), subject to applicable laws and regulations. \n  (iv)  Award of contracts. Construction contracts for any subproject will be awarded \nonly after (a) a business plan for the respective IMC has been approved by PPC \nand ADB; (b) all resettlement and compensation required for the subproject have \nbeen completed according to its resettlement plan; and (c) certification has been \ngiven that the site has been cleared of unexploded ordnance. \n(v)  Social issues. The GAP and EMDPs will be implemented throughout the project \nimplementation period, monitored, and reported every 6 months to ADB. The ", "20 \nEMDPs  prepared  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  be  implemented  in \naccordance with the EMDF. The EMDP for the Tra Cau subproject in Quang Ngai \nProvince will be updated and submitted to ADB for approval. \n(vi)  Resettlement: All land acquisition and resettlement activities under the Project \nwill be implemented in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations of \nViet Nam, requirements of the ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, and the \nresettlement plans. Prior to the start of any land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities, the Government will have (a) updated the resettlement plans based on \nthe detailed design for the subprojects and submitted them to ADB for approval, \nand (b) signed a contract with a qualified social science or other suitably qualified \ninstitution acceptable to ADB to conduct independent external monitoring and \nevaluation of the resettlement process and impacts. \n(vii)  Environment:  The  Project  facilities  will  be  constructed  and  operated  in \ncompliance  with  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  Viet  Nam, \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and regulations, IEEs, and SIEE. The EMP for \neach subproject will be updated and submitted to ADB for approval before final \napproval of the subproject detailed design. Mitigation measures detailed in EMPs \nwill be implemented and monitored to a satisfactory standard \n  (viii)  Regulatory Framework. The Government shall adopt, within twelve months of \nthe  effective  date,  necessary  regulatory  framework  with  revised  institutional \narrangements for management of irrigation systems at provincial and commune \nlevels  to  enable  achievement  of  the  project  objectives  more  effectively.  In \nparticular, the Government shall take necessary measures to restructure IMCs, \nWUGs, and WUAs and transfer the ownership for irrigation assets to IMCs, and \nWUGs, and WUAs, as appropriate. The restructuring of IMCs shall include the \nauthority to set, collect, and allocate water fees. \n \nA.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n77.  Prior to loan effectiveness (i) the PSC, CPMU, and PPMUs shall be established and \nmade operational in a manner satisfactory to ADB; and (ii) the project implementation guidelines \nspecifying  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  CPMU,  PPMUs,  PPCs,  and  other  relevant \ngovernment agencies, and the arrangements for the flow of funds under the Project shall be \napproved by MARD.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n78.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 52,128,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for the Central Region Water Resources Project from ADB's Special Funds resources with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n28 November 2005 ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nINSTITUTIONAL REFORM FOR IRRIGATION WATER MANAGEMENT \n \nA.  Institutional Context \n1.  National Level Agencies \n1.  The Law on Water Resources, which became effective in 1999, assigns the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD)1 as the lead agency to implement and manage \nwater resources projects, mainly irrigation and drainage, flood protection, rural water supply and \nsanitation,  typhoon  protection  measures,  and  most  major  hydraulic  structures.  MARD  also \nmanages some hydropower schemes2 whose primary purpose is flood protection, and some \nnational parks and conservation sites. Its Department of Water Resources (DWR) is responsible \nfor  preparing  development  plans  for  rural  water  supply  and  sanitation  and  irrigation  and \ndrainage schemes, and for overseeing rural water use.  \n \n2.  In 2002, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MoNRE) was created and \ngiven  responsibility  for  state  management  of  natural  resources  and  the  environment.  This \neffectively separated state water management functions from public water service delivery, both \nof which functions had previously been held by MARD. The process of rationalizing the roles \nand  functions  of  the  many  agencies  involved  in  water  management,  and  of  establishing \nprinciples, guidelines, and accompanying regulatory systems for implementing integrated water \nresources management (IWRM), is underway.3 MoNRE has been charged with preparing the \nnational water resources strategy (NWRS) for consideration of Cabinet by end-2005.4 MARD \nand MoNRE are both finalizing their 5-year plans for 2006\u20132010. \n \n3.  The Ministries of Planning and Investment, Finance, Construction, Industry, Fisheries, \nHealth, and Transport, among others, play a role in water resources management and related \nissues. The Law on Water Resources defines the role of the National Water Resource Council \n(NWRC)5 to advise the Government on water resource  management, and related national \nstrategies and action plans. It also provides for the establishment of river basin organizations as \nthe appropriate institutions to manage water resources.  \n \n2.  Local Government Agencies \n4.  Each level of local administration has a legislative body in the form of a people\u2019s council \n(PC). The provincial PC is the highest representative of state authority with offices at province, \ndistrict, and commune levels. Citizens elect members to all PCs. PCs approve and monitor the \nimplementation of local development plans, and now have responsibility for mobilizing financial \nresources and supervising expenditures.6 \n \n                                                 \n1 The Ministry of Water Resources was restructured in 1995 as the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n2 The Ministry of Industry constructs, operates, and manages most of the country\u2019s hydropower plants as part of its \nresponsibility for managing national energy policy. \n3 ADB, with the support of the governments of Denmark and the Netherlands, has provided technical assistance to \nboth MARD and MoNRE.  \n4  Refer to the minutes of meeting from the Seventh National Water Resource Council (NWRC) meeting on 11 April \n2005. \n5 The NWRC, chaired by the vice prime minister, advises the Government on strategies and policies for national \nwater resources, river basin plans, inter-basin diversions, large-scale water resource projects requiring cabinet \napproval, internationally shared water resources, and resolution of conflicts regarding competing uses. Eleven \nministries are represented on the NWRC. \n6  The State Budget Law of 2004. ", "22  Appendix 1 \n5.  The provincial people\u2019s ccommittee (PPC) is elected by and is the executive agency of \nthe PC in each province. It implements PC resolutions and reports outcomes to the PC while \nalso answering to higher levels of government. It is therefore subject to the principle of double \nsubordination, being accountable to the PC at the same administrative level and to the National \nPeople\u2019s Committee and central Government agencies. The PC approves decisions of the PPC \nand monitors their implementation.  \n \n6.  At  the  provincial  level,  the  various  ministries  are  represented  through  departments \ncreated under and managed by the PPC. This pattern of representation is repeated at the \ndistrict  and  commune  levels,  although  not  all  departments  are  represented  at  lower \nadministrative levels. Below the commune are the village and hamlet social divisions, led by a \nvillage or hamlet head, and without official government administrative offices. \n \n7.  The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) is responsible for the \nprovincial agriculture, forestry, irrigation, rural enterprise, and rural development sectors. They \nare directly under the authority of PPC but receive professional guidance and oversight from \nMARD. DARDs have a number of specialist divisions for administration, planning and financing, \nirrigation, agriculture, forestry, and, in some provinces, fisheries. In most provinces, DARDs \nhave subdepartments or centers for plant protection, veterinary services, agricultural extension, \nseed and seedling production, construction management, and rural development projects (e.g., \nfor markets and roads). DARD is responsible for planning new irrigation development and \nrehabilitation of existing schemes, project appraisals and feasibility studies, approval of the \ndesigns of small hydraulic structures (large hydraulic structures are approved by MARD), and \nmanagement of the irrigation management companies (paras. 11\u201313) and other provincial state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs).  \n \n8.  The  department  of  natural  resources  and  environment  (DoNRE)  has  provincial \nresponsibility for land administration, water resources, mineral resources, and environmental \nprotection and conservation. DoNREs, being new, have few experienced staff members and \nlimited  resources.  Increasingly,  DoNREs  will  be  important  in  developing  provincial  level \ninterpretations of the NWRS whose development is being led by MoNRE.  \n \n9.  An important provincial level department is the department of planning and investment \nwhich helps the PPC manage investments. It is a focal point for other provincial departments \nand collates socioeconomic development plans, recommends policies and means of attracting \ninvestment,  and  manages  foreign  and  domestic  investments.  It  is  under  PPC\u2019s  direct \nmanagement and the sectoral guidance of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). \n \n10.  Districts  are  the  key  level  of  government  for  agricultural,  forestry,  and  fisheries \ndevelopment. Each district is divided into 15\u201320 communes with an average population of about \n5,000. Districts are therefore responsible for providing services and infrastructure to populations \nof about 80,000\u2013100,000. Communes typically have 11\u201315 staff members in the commune PC \nand a number of mass organizations (women, farmers, youth, war veterans, etc.), which are \ngrouped under the roof of the Viet Nam Fatherland Front and provide a forum for members to \narticulate views about political, social, and economic processes.  \n ", "  Appendix 1  23 \nB.  Institutions for Irrigation Management \n3.  Irrigation Management Companies/Enterprises \n11.  Irrigation schemes (including drainage and flood protection schemes) serve more than \n2.6 million hectares (ha) of agricultural land through thousands of small- and 75 medium-scale \nto large-scale schemes. The primary institution for operation and maintenance (O&M) of these \nare the irrigation (and drainage) management companies (IMCs), established under law as non-\nprofit SOEs reporting to the PPC through DARD.7 About 130 IMCs serve 63% of Viet Nam\u2019s \nirrigated  area.  The  remainder  is  served  by  some  of  the  more  than  10,000  agricultural \ncooperatives and 2,000 water user groups (WUGs). \n \n12.  IMCs may encompass several irrigation management enterprises (IMEs), which can be \nconsidered a branch organization serving one or more irrigation schemes. Many IMEs were \noriginally established as IMCs, based on the scheme-level organization of water management at \nthe time, with DARD acting as the coordinating body for the river basin or province. The creation \nof provincial (or river basin) IMCs drew responsibility for water management away from DARD.8 \nThe IMCs, which each serve an individual scheme, were renamed IMEs. This took place in \n1998, when guidelines for the organization and operation of IMCs were introduced. \n \n13.  IMCs\u2019  responsibilities  include  planning  and  management  of  O&M  of  the  schemes, \ndelivery of irrigation water, management of construction activities, collection of irrigation (or \nwater user) fees, management of the schemes\u2019 finances, and support for IMEs (para. 18). \nAnnual targets for each IMC are set by the PPC in coordination with DARD on the basis of \nMARD\u2019s Guidelines on the Organization and Operation of Irrigation Management Companies.9 \nWater allocations for the schemes are based on their design capacity and are approved by \nMARD and the PPC.  \n \n4.  Agricultural Cooperatives \n14.  Farmers  have  direct  representation  in  agricultural  cooperatives  which  provide  such \nservices as irrigation water, seed, fertilizer, and extension. The primary service provided by the \ncooperatives  is  irrigation.  Cooperatives  enter  into  contracts  with  IMCs  for  supply  of  water \n(frequently through the intermediary of irrigation stations), which they then deliver to farmers\u2019 \nfields. Under the terms of the contracts, cooperatives are allowed to collect water user fees on \nbehalf of the IMCs and retain a portion of these to cover their own costs.10 IMCs are responsible \nfor  maintaining  the  primary  and  secondary  canals  and  structures  and  cooperatives  for \nmaintaining secondary and tertiary canals. Some cooperatives are reluctant to reveal the actual \nland area irrigated to IMCs so that they can retain a greater amount of the collected fees. They \nhave  large  membership  (up  to  2,000  members),  which  hinders  transparency  and  limits \nopportunities for widespread participation. \n                                                 \n7  DARDs have policy responsibility for irrigation water use and interpretation of national policy, regulations, and \nstandards as disseminated by MARD. \n8  For example, there is now one provincial IMC each in Binh Dinh, Quang Binh, Quang Ngai, and Thua Thien Hue \nprovinces, and one per river basin in Quang Tri and Thanh Hoa provinces.  \n9  Circular No. 6/1998/TT-BNN-TCCB. \n10  Cooperatives are often also responsible for collecting taxes from farmers. ", "24  Appendix 1 \nC.  Issues Affecting Performance of Irrigation \n15.  Two major constraints on water resource management limit Viet Nam\u2019s ability to meet its \nrural  development  targets:  (i)  an  institutional  setting  that  encourages  service  providers\u2019 \ndependence on government grants for O&M, and (ii) inefficient allocation of financial and other \nresources.  \n \n16.  Specific issues affecting irrigation management have been reported in the institutional \nanalysis conducted under the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Central \nRegion Water Resources Project;11 related pilot and demonstration activities undertaken by \nCARE International in Vietnam12 and World Vision Viet Nam;13 the project completion report on \nthe  Irrigation  and  Flood  Protection  Rehabilitation  Project;14  a  special  evaluation  study  on \nparticipatory approaches in forest and water resource operations;15 reviews of the ongoing \nSecond  Red  River  Basin  Sector  Project;16  a  working  paper  on  water-related  legal  and \ninstitutional, and economic and financial arrangements;17 and studies on (i) development of \nprovincial water resource investment strategies,18 (ii) development and establishment of new \nmodels for irrigation and drainage services,19 and (iii) integrated water management in pumped \nirrigation systems in the red river delta of Viet Nam.20 The major findings are summarized below. \n \n17.  Irrigation Management Companies. The operations of IMCs are guided by a set of \ncentrally defined rules and regulations.21 At the provincial level, the PPC has some leeway, \nwithin  the  limit  of  the  laws  and  decrees,  to  make  adjustments  to  these  to  suit  provincial \nconditions.  Nevertheless,  strategic  decisions  relating  to  area  of  intervention,  budget  and \ninvestment  planning,  setting  of  water  user  fees,  personnel  planning  (e.g.,  nomination  of \nmanagerial staff) are decided by external agents (PPC, DARD, MARD). Hence, the director of \nan IMC has limited scope to improve IMC performance in relation to quality of service, work \nmethods, work planning, staff levels and skills, and user participation.  \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2004.

", "  Appendix 1  25 \n18.  IMC Institutional Analysis. A detailed analysis of the project area IMCs was made \nduring the project preparatory TA. The analysis aimed to determine the IMCs\u2019 strengths in terms \nof external22 and internal23 factors. In terms of their cultural (or external) environment, none of \nthe IMCs is modern, most are either traditional or intermediate. Critically, all the IMCs have low \nscores for cost-efficiency, effectiveness, autonomy, and accountability, and are therefore at risk \nof failure. A simple measure of this can be seen by the fact that IMCs are only completing 20\u2013\n30% of the required maintenance even though they receive state subsidies in addition to user \nfees. IMCs in the project area are characterized as traditional, strongly risk-averse institutions \nwith centralized leadership styles that limit participation of lower-level stakeholders in decision \nmaking.  \n \n19.  IMC Performance. Water user fees in Viet Nam are high by international standards.24 \nHence,  the  failure  of  IMCs  to  meet  water  delivery  targets  or  to  undertake  maintenance \nthroughout the command area is not due to a shortage of income. Other factors include the \nfollowing: (i) water delivery is often unrelated to the cropping patterns of the areas served;25 (ii) \nmany farmers are reluctant to pay user fees when water is not delivered in adequate quantities \nor at the correct time,26 or when farmers located further upstream are seen to have preferential \naccess to water;27 (iii) IMCs use the income generated from user fees to meet recurrent costs \nand sometimes also as a source of general revenue (controlled by the PPC) for new works and \nscheme extensions;28 (iv) fees collected by the agricultural cooperatives are not always passed \nto the IMCs as they should be, and the cooperatives themselves sometimes divert revenue from \nfees to other uses;29 (v) some farmers use water without paying (non-revenue water to the \nIMC);30 (vi) the ceiling for fees in any year is set by the PPC and is more closely related to \nrecurrent costs of IMC staff and operations than to O&M needs, thus encouraging the belief that \nmaintenance of the schemes is a state responsibility.  \n \n20.  Financial Sustainability. The pricing of irrigation water services is done in a fragmented \nmanner. The Department of Price Management under the Ministry of Finance (MOF) sets a \nprice bracket for different services, and MARD then develops guidelines for specific fee levels. \nThese two instruments are used by PPCs to determine location-specific fee levels. IMCs do not \nhave the authority to decide fees nor to base them on business principles. This constrains \nfinancial sustainability because, although IMCs receive a significant subsidy from the provincial \nadministration, they are nonprofitable. They are thus caught in the middle\u2014they do receive \n                                                 \n22 Includes (i) attitudes toward entrepreneurship, delegation, and consultation; (ii) leadership style; (iii) legal basis; \nand (iv) mission. \n23 Whether the IMCs are giving a satisfactory outcome in terms of (i) cost efficiency; (ii) effectiveness; (iii) autonomy; \nand (iv) accountability. \n24 Fees for full gravity service vary among the six target provinces of the Project from VND290,000 to VND490,000 \nper hectare ($18\u201332/ha for each season). \n25 IMC staff have little knowledge of the areas served, and there is no monitoring mechanism to record actual water \nvolumes delivered, their timing, or their source. \n26 Contrary to common belief, poor farmers are willing to pay user fees if they see that these are used correctly and \nfairly. There is evidence of a strong relationship between level of service and the payment of water user fees \n(footnote 18). \n27 Given that the infrastructure is often poor because it lacks maintenance, farmers at the tail of canals receive less \nreliable water services. \n28 IMCs have not adjusted their business approach from \u201cscheme developer\u201d to \u201cscheme operator\u201d and hence are \npoorly structured, inefficient, and costly in that role. A large part of revenue is used to maintain non-operational \nstaff. \n29 For agricultural cooperatives (and therefore the associated Commune), water user fees have become a significant \npart of discretionary revenue. Hence, due to the uncoupling of fees from service, farmers tend to view these fees \nas another form of taxation and therefore have little confidence in the management accountability of cooperatives. \n30 IMCs lack the power of a governmental agency to enforce policy and the right to impose sanctions (such as \ncessation of services) that a private company would enjoy in cases of nonpayment. ", "26  Appendix 1 \nsufficient  budgets  and  they  are  not  able  to  raise  water  user  fees.  Understandably,  some \nquarters exert pressure to increase water user fees. However, this is only part of the problem \naffecting financial sustainability.  \n \n21.  In fairness to the IMCs, it should be noted that local cost norms for O&M have not been \ndeveloped for most irrigation schemes. This makes it difficult for IMCs to plan and allocate \nappropriate budgets, which, in turn, exacerbates an already poor O&M performance and lack of \ntransparency in financial management. The absence of cost norms also frustrates the setting of \nwater user fees and impedes the transfer of irrigation facilities to WUGs. \n \n22.  Transfer of Ownership of Assets. Various Government documents mention that IMCs \n(which are 100% SOEs) have been given the rights of use, possession, and management of the \ninfrastructure in their irrigation schemes on behalf of the people of Viet Nam. The ownership of \nirrigation infrastructure remains with PPCs at the subnational level. In some provinces, transfer \nof user rights to cooperatives and communes is recorded in contracts. Until this is rectified \nthrough  formal  transfer  of  title,  the  responsibility  for  maintenance  or  replacement  of \ninfrastructure will be considered by water users and the IMCs to rest with central Government.  \n \nD.  Government Measures to Improve Irrigation Performance \n23.  A key feature of water resource management is that many sectors have a stake in \nachieving greater efficiency or are highly susceptible to loss of access to water of adequate \nquantity and quality. In the agriculture sector, the full potential of irrigation schemes cannot be \nrealized so long as water is inequitably distributed, large parts of the command areas are not \nserved, or valuable water conveyance infrastructure is allowed to deteriorate. Irrigation currently \nconsumes a disproportionately large part of Viet Nam\u2019s available fresh water supply in lakes, \nrivers, wetlands, and groundwater reserves. In the face of increasing competition from higher \nvalue-added users, irrigation will have to become more efficient.  \n \n24.  The Government is pursuing a new policy to improve the performance of irrigation and \ndrainage schemes, and has realigned its strategy for water service delivery toward a more \ndecentralized and participatory approach. The strategy relies on giving greater autonomy to \nservice  providers  while  also  encouraging,  in  a  mutually  beneficial  partnership,  the  active \nparticipation of water users to relieve service providers\u2019 O&M costs. \n \n5.  Irrigation Management Companies \n25.  As a first step, irrigation service providers (IMCs and agricultural cooperatives) need to \nbecome  service-oriented  to  develop  good  management  practices  based  on  principles  of \naccountability and transparency. To create an enabling environment for this, they will need \ngreater flexibility to negotiate directly with water users for delivery of an agreed level of service \nfor  an  appropriate  fee;  and  to  make  decisions  affecting  their  staffing,  charge  rates,  and \nstandards of performance\u2014albeit within a regulatory framework set in place by Government to \nprotect the rights of users.31  \n \n26.  To improve financial sustainability, service providers should collect fees from all areas \nserved by an irrigation scheme,32 and the revenue should be used strictly for the purposes \n                                                 \n31 The role of water in sustaining life, livelihoods, and health cannot be overlooked, and the state may need to \nmanage water in such a way as to protect the poorest segments of society. \n32 In line with increasing returns to scale, raising the capacity and customer base will bring down the average cost. ", "  Appendix 1  27 \nintended in an efficient and cost-effective manner. As a complementary action, IMCs need to \ndevelop a water pricing strategy that clearly reflects the cost of O&M. To further improve \nefficiency  and  reduce  the  cost  of  O&M,  water  users  need  to  be  involved  in  management \ndecisions that affect their well-being (paras. 29\u201333).33 \n \n27.  In accordance with the national action plan for renovating and raising the efficiency of \nirrigation management34 launched recently by the minister of MARD, a regulatory framework \nenabling provinces to improve their current institutional arrangements is to be put in place by the \nend of 2005. Its focus areas are (i) completion and modernization of infrastructure, (ii) a shift to \nservice-oriented and participatory management, (iii) introduction of mechanisms for financing to \nreduce subsidy levels, and (iv) effective protection of infrastructure from encroachment. \n \n28.  For unprofitable IMCs, other business models (including conversion to public utilities or \njoint-stock companies, or transferring full ownership of assets to WUGs), need to be considered \nin  line  with  the  Government's  policy  of  SOE  reform.  In  addition,  the  recent  decree35  on \nproduction and supply of public goods and services introduces a shift toward procurement of \npublic services through tender rather than \u201cassignment.\u201d This would enable PPCs to contract \nout the provision of O&M for irrigation schemes to IMCs or other eligible groups in a competitive \nmanner based on a clear definition of targets and standards of service.  \n \n6.  Participatory Irrigation Management \n29.  Participatory  irrigation  management  (PIM)  has  been  shown  to  have  the  following \nbenefits: (i) increased water use efficiency, (ii) increased agricultural productivity, (iii) enhanced \nsustainability of irrigated agriculture, (iv) reduced cost burden on the state for O&M, and (v) \nreduced water user fees. WUGs (formed by and under the instructions of the commune people\u2019s \ncommittee)  operate  and  maintain  tertiary  level  canals  as  part  of  farmers\u2019  communal \nobligations.36 There are good reasons to extend the scope of such responsibilities to secondary \nand higher-level canals: (i) to create a greater sense of ownership (and counter the perception \nthat user fees are another form of local tax), (ii) to operate and maintain the system more \nefficiently than state organizations, (iii) to reduce the financial burden of IMCs, and (iv) to help \nresolve conflicts between groups under the same canal system. \n \n30.  In 1998, the Government enacted the so-called \u201cgrassroots democracy decree\u201d37 which \nlegalized  people\u2019s  direct  participation  in  local  decision-making  and  aimed  to  enhance  the \ntransparency of local government actions. More recently, MARD\u2019s framework strategy38 on \ndevelopment of PIM in Viet Nam sets out its approach to accelerating PIM. The approach \nderived  from  MARD\u2019s  experience  on  a  number  of  pilot  initiatives,  especially  the  technical \n                                                 \n33 For schemes where participatory irrigation management has been introduced, benefits included (i) 20\u201325% staff \nreduction in IMCs, (ii) improved services and fee collection rates, (iii) 20% increase in total output because of yield \nincreases from improved water scheduling, (iv) lower demand for water because of more regular water application, \nand (v) lower poverty. \n34 Official Document 248/BNN-TL of 31 January 2005. \n35 Government Decree 31/2005/ND-CP of 11 March 2005. \n36 In effect, cooperatives possess a pool of free labor because, according to Ordinance 15/1999/PL-UBTVQH10, \neveryone (men 18\u201345 years old and women 18\u201335 years old) is required to provide 10 days\u2019 community work per \nyear. \n37 Decree No. 29/1998/ND-CP on Regulation of the Exercise of Democracy in Communes. \n38 Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. 2004.

", "28  Appendix 1 \nassistance39 that accompanied the Irrigation and Flood Protection Rehabilitation Project.40 The \nobjectives of the new framework are (i) to transfer local irrigation structures to farmers under \nappropriate irrigation management transfer models in conjunction with PIM,41 and (ii) to bring \nsignificantly change the role of farmers by raising their responsibility in scheme management, \nthereby reducing the state\u2019s subsidy of O&M.42 \n \n31.  MARD\u2019s Department of Water Resources (DWR) has been designated to coordinate \nimplementation of the PIM program, and to liaise with national agencies\u2014particularly MPI and \nMOF\u2014and various provincial and lower authorities to incorporate PIM in all new irrigation \ninvestment  projects.  DWR  is  also  responsible  for  monitoring  the  performance  of  the  PIM \nstrategy throughout the country. All IMCs have been instructed to prepare PIM action plans. \n \n32.  Existing WUGs are linked to agricultural cooperatives, which provide a range of services \nto  their  farmer  members.  A  major  limitation  of  cooperatives  and  other  commune-based \norganizations, however, is that they represent administrative units whose boundaries seldom \ncoincide with those of irrigation schemes.43 The management of tertiary and secondary canals \nthat span one or more administrative areas requires cooperation among different cooperatives, \na difficult and sometimes costly process. The issue relating to mismatched boundaries has been \nresolved by the \u201cordinance on hydraulic work exploitation and protection\u201d, which states that \n\u201chydraulic works must be implemented in such a way that the systematic nature of the work is \nmaintained without division by administrative demarcation\u201d. The new WUGs should therefore be \nstrictly defined by the physical characteristics of the related irrigation schemes or parts thereof. \n \n33.  WUGs  have  proved  effective  when  supported  by  projects,  but  their  long-term \nsustainability is questionable. To capture the benefits of PIM, the legal status and organizational \nstructure of WUGs need to be clearly established. The size of WUGs should be restricted to \nensure real participation. Hence, water user associations (WUAs) will be needed to ensure \nofficial representation of the WUGs in larger schemes. Ultimately, management of all small \nirrigation schemes should be transferred to local community organizations such as WUGs. In \nlarge-scale  irrigation  and  drainage  schemes,  the  headworks,44  main  canals,  and  complex \nstructures would continue to be managed by IMCs, but lower-level canals and structures could \nbe transferred to WUGs/WUAs after the appropriate conditions have been established.  \n \n                                                 \n39 TA  1968-VIE  (ADB.  1993.

Introduction \n1.  The Central Region Water Resources Project will improve irrigation management and \nrehabilitate and complete irrigation and drainage infrastructure in six coastal provinces in central \nViet Nam. During the preparatory studies, social analyses were carried out and resettlement \nplans prepared for six subprojects (one in each target province): (i) Thach Thanh subproject in \nThanh Hoa Province,  (ii) Thuong My Trung in Quang Binh Province, (iii) Thach Han in Quang \nTri Province, (iv) Tay Nam Huong Tra in Thua Thien Hue Province, (v) Tra Cau in Quang Ngai \nProvince, and (vi) La Tinh Subproject in Binh Dinh Province. \n \nB.  Resettlement Principles and Entitlements  \n2.  Policy Framework. The policy framework and resettlement entitlements derive from \nViet Nam\u2019s laws (principally the revised Land Law of 2003); Decrees 188 and 197; ADB's policy \non involuntary resettlement;1 and the frameworks and entitlement matrixes approved by the \nGovernment for other projects in the water, transport, and energy sectors. Provisions and \nprinciples adopted in the resettlement plans for the Project will supersede the provisions of \ndecrees in force in Viet Nam wherever a gap exists. Such waivers of Vietnamese law and \ndecrees  are  provided  for  under  Decree  17/ND-CP  (May  2001),  which  regulates  the \nmanagement and use of official development assistance (ODA).2  \n \n3.  The basic principles are the following: \n \n  (i)  Acquisition  of  land  and  other  assets,  and  resettlement  of  people  will  be \nminimized  as  much  as  possible  by  identifying  possible  alternative  project \ndesigns, and social, economic, operational, and engineering solutions that have \nthe least impact on populations in the project area. \n  (ii)  Project-affected people (APs) are defined as those who may stand to lose, as a \nconsequence of the Project, all or part of their physical and nonphysical assets, \nincluding homes, homesteads, productive lands, commercial properties, tenancy, \nincome-earning opportunities, social and cultural activities and relationships, and \nother losses that may be identified during resettlement planning. \n  (iii)  APs,  identified  in  the  project-impacted  areas  on  the  date  of  the  detailed \nmeasurement survey, will be entitled to be compensated for their lost assets, \nincomes, and businesses at full replacement cost, and will be provided with \nrehabilitation measures sufficient to assist them to improve or at least maintain \ntheir pre-project living standards, income earning capacity, and production levels. \n  (iv)  All  affected  populations  will  be  equally  eligible  for  compensation  and \nrehabilitation  assistance,  irrespective  of  tenure  status,  social  or  economic \nstanding,  and  any  such  factors  that  may  discriminate  against  achieving  the \nobjectives outlined above. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995. Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n2  Article 29 stipulates that where an international aid agreement has provisions that are inconsistent with the \nprovisions of Viet Nam law, the provisions of the ODA agreement shall prevail. ", "  Appendix 4     33  \n  (v)  Lack of legal rights to the assets lost or adversely affected will not bar APs from \nentitlement to such compensation and rehabilitation measures.3  \n  (vi)  Replacement residential and agricultural land will be as close as possible to the \nland that was lost, and will be acceptable to the AP.4  \n  (vii)  The  rehabilitation  measures  to  be  provided  are  (a)  cash  compensation  at \nreplacement cost without deduction for depreciation or salvageable materials for \nhouses and other structures; (b) full title to replacement agricultural land for land \nof equal productive capacity acceptable to the AP as a priority, or cash in lieu of \nland at replacement cost at current market value;5 (c) full title to replacement \nresidential and commercial land of equal size acceptable to the AP; (d) cash \ncompensation for crops and trees at current market value; and (e) relocation \nallowances and rehabilitation assistance. \n  (viii)  Temporarily affected land and communal infrastructure will be restored to pre-\nproject conditions. \n  (ix)  The compensation and resettlement activities will be satisfactorily completed and \nrehabilitation measures will be in place before the Government and ADB approve \naward of any contract for civil works in the affected area.  \n  (x)  The  executing  agency  will  set  in  place  institutional  arrangements  to  ensure \neffective and timely design, planning, consultation, and implementation of the \nland acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation program. \n  (xi)  Existing cultural and religious practices shall be respected and, to the maximum \nextent practical, preserved. \n  (xii)  Adequate budgetary support will be fully committed and made available to cover \nthe costs of land acquisition, resettlement, and rehabilitation within the agreed \nimplementation period.  \n  (xiii)  Special  measures  shall  be  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  plan  and \ncomplementary  mitigation  and  enhancement  activities  to  protect  socially  and \neconomically vulnerable groups such as ethnic minority peoples, female-headed \nfamilies, children, and elderly people without support structures, and people living \nin extreme poverty. \n  (xiv)  There shall be effective mechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. \n  (xv)  Details of the resettlement plans shall be disclosed to the APs and any interested \ngroups  in  the  form  of  full  or  summary  resettlement  plans,  or  as  information \n                                                 \n3  People without legal rights are referred to as non-titled in ADB's Operations Manual, and include those who have \nno recognizable rights or claims to the land that they are occupying and/or using. The policy also states that \nrestoration measures must be determined in consultation with affected communities, including those people who \nmight not be formally recognized in national legislation. Those without legal title to land and/or structures occupied \nor used by them (e.g., squatters) are entitled to various options of resettlement assistance, provided they \ncultivated/occupied the land before the eligibility cut-off date. Resettlement assistance to non-titled APs will include \ncompensation for lost assets and restoration of income and living standards. Assistance may also include \nreplacement land, although there is no entitlement to this for such APs. The resettlement package may include \nmeasures to ensure that such APs are able to find alternative sites or income sources, depending on their losses. \n4  Where there is not sufficient agricultural land available in villages, the Project will help the communes develop new \nagricultural land wherever this is possible (i.e., conversion of unused land or other non-agricultural land owned by \nthe commune). The Project will also help communes prepare level residential land and sites for livestock and \nfishponds. \n5  \u201cAgricultural land for land of equal productive capacity\u201d means that the land provided as compensation should be \nable to produce the same (or better) yield that the AP was producing on his or her previous land. The production \nshould be in the planting season immediately following the land acquisition. It can be for a future period if \ntransitional allowance equal to the household\u2019s previous yield is provided to the AP household while waiting for the \nland to develop the same productivity as the previous land. \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \nbooklets and leaflets in a language that can be understood by the APs and in an \naccessible place (such as project and commune offices).  \n \n4.

Actual replacement costs and rates of compensation for loss are to be determined in \nconsultation with commune administrations in each subproject area during detailed design of \nsubprojects. They will be based on current market rates and detailed measurement surveys. \n \n6.  Ethnic Minorities and Vulnerable Groups. From the social analyses carried out for the \nsix subprojects it was determined that Tra Cau in Quang Ngai Province is a category-A project \nfor which an ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) is required. An EMDP is not required for \nthe other five core projects because, with the exception of the Thach Thanh scheme in Than ", "  Appendix 4     35  \nHoa, the subprojects are located in areas with small proportions of ethnic minorities (i.e., 0\u20135%) \nand  the  households  are  dispersed  among  the  Kinh  population.  Detailed  design  of  the  six \nsubprojects will include screening to identify any significant ethnic minority impacts that were not \ndiscerned during the project preparatory studies. If the screening process shows that ethnic \nminority groups would be at a disadvantage in the development process or would encounter \nconstraints  on  their  ability  to  enjoy  project  benefits,  then  an  EMDP  will  be  prepared  in \naccordance with the framework given in Appendix 5 to reflect their special needs.6 Similarly, a \nprocess will be established to deal with issues or concerns raised during project implementation. \n \n7.  Income  Restoration  Strategy  for  Severely  Affected  Households.  In  addition  to \nproviding compensation for all lost assets at replacement cost to ensure that APs\u2019 livelihoods \nare not adversely affected (and where possible improved),the Project will identify severely \naffected persons and provide them with special measures: \n  (i)  priority for project-related employment opportunities; \n  (ii)  training (for 6 months maximum) for all household members who are affected by \nloss of productive income in vocational skills and literacy; \n  (iii)  subsistence allowance during the training period equivalent to the value of 30 kg \nof rice per month; and \n  (iv)  productivity enhancement through agricultural extension and related assistance. \n \n8.  All households that suffer a loss of 10% or more of their productive assets or are \nrequired to relocate will be provided with additional support. The sites for new residences, home \ngardens, and livestock pens will be cleared and leveled to a satisfactory condition in accordance \nwith the wishes of the relocating families. Relocating households will be assisted to dismantle \nand rebuild their houses, and those losing agricultural land will be entitled to replacement land \nof equal productivity, or an income restoration and subsistence allowance if there is no land of \nequal productive value available in the commune. The Project will help communes convert non-\nirrigated agricultural land to a suitable condition for irrigation, in consultation with the APs. \n \n9.  Participatory  Process  and  Grievance  Mechanism.  Screening  for  adverse \nresettlement or ethnic minority impacts will continue during detailed design, and APs will be \nconsulted to ensure that, to the extent practicable, their needs are incorporated into the final \ndesign arrangements. The Project will also set up a mechanism to deal with any grievances \nraised during project implementation. APs will be encouraged to participate in measurement \nsurveys,  validation  of  compensation  rates  and  entitlements,  and  delivery  of  entitlements, \nmonitoring of impacts and benefits, and design of the grievance mechanism.  \n \n10.  Disclosure.  Key  information  in  the  resettlement  plans,  including  compensation  and \nrehabilitation options, will be disclosed to the APs before the plans submitted to ADB and MARD \nfor approval. Information disclosed to the APs will be in the form of full or summary resettlement \nplans, or as information booklets and leaflets, and will be in a language that can be understood \nby the APs. Copies will be made available for public reference in an accessible place.7 Any \nresettlement  plan  prepared  under  the  Project  will  be  made  freely  available  to  all  affected \npersons and other interested parties, in both English and Vietnamese, and will be posted on \nADB\u2019s website following ADB and MARD approval of the related subproject detailed design. \n                                                 \n6  Similar attention will be given to identifying and addressing the special needs of any other disadvantaged groups \nsuch as the landless, poor, female-headed households, and the disabled. \n7  The relevant requirements for this are set out in ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (ADB. 2005. Public \nCommunications Policy: Disclosure and Exchange of Information. Manila), Handbook on Resettlement (ADB. 1998. \nHandbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. Manila), and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (ADB. 1998. \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila). \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \n \nC.  Resettlement Plans \n11.  For each subproject area a resettlement plan, including an inventory of lost assets for all \nhouseholds potentially affected by loss of land and structures, was prepared. The resettlement \nplans and related costs will be updated as part of detailed design during project implementation. \nAppropriate reporting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms will be set in place as part of the \nresettlement management system. A summary of each subproject is given below. \n \n12.  Thach Thanh Subproject. The subproject is in the mountainous district of Thach Thanh \nnorth of Thanh Hoa Province. Project activities will cover 16 communes scattered throughout \nthe  district.  The  area  is  densely  populated  and  the  ethnic  minority  community  of  Muong \nconstitutes  58%  of  the  population.  Poverty  is  high:  58%  for  the  district  and  63%  for  the \nsubproject area. Sugarcane is the main crop. Unreliable water supply results in low crop yields \nand low incomes. The subproject will improve irrigation infrastructure to allow double cropping \nalong the Buoi river. It will thereby improve agricultural production and raise incomes and living \nstandards in this poor district, especially among the Muong. Domestic water supply will be \nprovided and this will improve health and reduce the drudgery of women and children who \ncurrently  carry  water  from  sparse  sources.  The  subproject  will  construct  and  rehabilitate \npumping stations, reservoirs, and earth canals (including the provision of lining). The Bai Muong \nweir will be rehabilitated. The subproject will require land acquisition of 19.2 ha including 13.7 \nha of agricultural land, 4.8 ha of forest land, 0.7 ha of residential land, affecting a total of 1,397 \nhouseholds (1,351 households lose agricultural land, 30 lose residential land, and 16 lose forest \nland). There will also be temporary effects on 569 households. Few structures are affected\u2014\none household will lose its simple house, and 13 households will be affected by impacts on \nsecondary structures such as animal pens, yards, walls, and a well. Some 13.5 ha of crops \n(predominantly  rice,  sugar  cane,  and  maize)  and  43,255  trees  will  be  cleared.  Some  890 \nhouseholds will lose crops and 53 will lose trees. \n \n13.  Thuong My Trung Subproject. The subproject will improve irrigation and drainage \ninfrastructure for rice in 13 communes within the Kien Giang river basin. Out of a total irrigated \narea of 4,188 ha, 3,318 ha are below sea level. Most farmers do not plant a second crop \nbecause of flood risk. Poverty incidence is 40\u201360%. Rice is the main crop, while better-off \nhouseholds have diversified livelihoods including livestock production and aquaculture. The \nsubproject will construct and rehabilitate irrigation, drainage, and flood protection infrastructure \naround Hac Hai lagoon to enable two rice crops on 870 ha above mean sea level, and 3,318 ha \nbelow  sea  level.  Rice  will  be  supplemented  by  aquaculture.  The  main  works  are  (i)  82 \nkilometers (km) of embankment, (ii) rehabilitation of 66 existing and construction of 23 new \nsluice gates, (iii) rehabilitation of 25 existing and construction of 15 new pumping stations, and \n(iv) related bridges and aqueducts. The subproject will require land acquisition of 55.2 ha of \nagricultural land, affecting some 1,382 households (92% of all affected households). There will \nbe  temporary  loss  of  rice  crops  on  65.9  ha  of  land  that  will  be  rented  for  1  year  during \nconstruction, affecting 1,490 households. No main or secondary structures are affected. One \nhousehold will lose 50 trees.  \n \n14.  Thach Han Subproject. The subproject area spreads over 12 communes in Trie Phong \ndistrict, 18 communes in Hai Lang district, and two urban wards in Quang Tri town. Poverty \nincidence is 20% on average in the province but 57% in the subproject area. The scheme, \ndesigned in the 1970s, was never completed. Its completion under the Project would allow full \nproduction on 13,867 ha. The works comprise (i) upgrading the Thach Han headworks and \ncanal system (including lining 13 km of main canal and 45 km of primary and lower-level ", "  Appendix 4     37  \ncanals); and (ii) construction of Ben Da weir to serve 350 ha. The subproject will require land \nacquisition of 15.2 ha, including 12.2 ha of agricultural land, 2.9 ha of forest land, and 1,891 \nsquare meters (m2) of residential land, affecting a total of 471 households (448 households lose \nagricultural  land,  seven  lose  residential  land,  and  16  lose  forest  land).  There will  also  be \ntemporary effects on 467 households (464 will experience short-term effects on 9.7 ha of \nagricultural land, the residential land (317 m2) of 2 will be affected, and 1 will lose 1.5 ha of \nforest land, which will be rented for 1 year during construction. There are no primary (houses or \nshops) or secondary (animal pens, walls, rice bins, etc.) structures affected by the subproject. \nClearance will occur to 11.1 ha of crop (predominantly rice, maize, and potato) and 10,729 \ntrees. Some 446 households will lose crops and 10 will lose trees.  \n \n15.  Tay Nam Huong Tra Subproject. The subproject is in the southwestern part of Huong \nTra district, north of Hue city, and includes 4,174 ha of irrigated land (mainly rice). Insufficient \nwater and drainage problems depress rice yields. Poverty incidence is high at 58%. The main \nworks are (i) enlargement of the Khe Ngang reservoir, serving 50 ha; (ii) construction of 8.6 km \nof a new main canal; (iii) raising the spillway of the Tho Son reservoir serving 260 ha; (iv) \nupgrading the 3-, 5-, and 7-community canals; and (v) constructing a pumping station and \nassociated culverts and sluices at Nam Thanh to improve drainage on 300 ha. The subproject \nwill acquire 93.1 ha, including some 52.8 ha of agricultural land, 38.9 ha of forest land, and 1.4 \nha of residential land, affecting a total of 717 households. There will be temporary loss of 1.7 ha \nof agricultural land (affecting 367 households in three communes) and 46 m2 of residential land \n(affecting  1  household  in  Huong  Toan)  that  will  be  rented  for  1  year  during  construction, \naffecting 1,490 households. Some structures will be affected\u201436 households will lose houses \n(and require relocation within the same two communes), and 14 will be affected by impacts on \nsecondary  structures  such  as  animal  pens,  yards,  and  walls.  Some  55.6  ha  of  crop \n(predominantly rice) and 354,520 trees are to be cleared. Some 520 households will lose crops \nand 56 will lose trees. \n \n16.  Tra Cau Subproject. The subproject, in Duc Pho and Mo Duc districts in the southern \npart of the province, comprises the Liet Son-Chop Vung, Nui Ngang, and Dien Truong schemes. \nThe area has poverty levels of 38\u201341%. The social analyses carried out during the preparatory \nstudies determined that there are no ethnic minorities in 12 of the beneficiary communes of the \ndistricts, but that the directly affected persons in Ho Sau and Dong Ram villages in Ba Kham \ncommune are exclusively of the Hre ethnic group. Tra Cau is a category-A project, for which an \nethnic minority development plan has been prepared.  \n \n17.  The subproject will enable full agricultural development of the commanded area, provide \nwater  to  settlements  and  industrial  zones,  and  reduce  poverty.  The  works  include  (i) \nconstruction of the Chop Vung reservoir to serve 700 ha; (ii) heightening the dam and spillway \nof  the  Dien  Truong  reservoir,  and  rehabilitating  and  extending  the  canal  system,  and \nconstructing an access road to the dam; and (iii) completion of primary and lower-level canals in \nthe Nui Ngang system. The subproject will require land acquisition of 107.5 ha, including 38.7 \nha of agricultural land, 67.5 ha of forest land, 1.3 ha of residential land (1.2 ha in Pho Phong \nalone), affecting a total of 1,202 households (861 households will lose agricultural land, 240 \nforest land, 97 residential land, and 4 aquaculture land totaling 114 m2). There will also be \ntemporary  effects  on  2,963  m2  of  residential  land  belonging  to  56  households,  5.5  ha  of \nagricultural land belonging to 763 households across the five communes, 2.0 ha of forest land in \nthree  communes  (belonging  to  210  households),  and  some  150  m2  of  aquaculture  land \nbelonging to three households. Some 44.0 ha of crops (affecting 1,069 households) and 62,535 \ntrees (affecting 302 households) will be cleared. \n \n ", "38  Appendix 4 \n18.  La Tinh Subproject. The subproject area includes four communes in Phu Cat district \nand three in Phy My district. The poverty incidence is 45\u201348%. Because irrigation infrastructure \nhas deteriorated, much of which resulted from flood damage, only about 1,800 ha out of a total \ncommand  area  of  3,950  ha  are  currently  supplied  with  water  in  this  scheme.  The  works \ncomprise (i) reconstruction of the Cay Ke weir to serve 1,000 ha, (ii) lining of 80 km of irrigation \ncanal and rehabilitation of canal structures, (iii) rehabilitation of 21.5 km of flood protection \nembankments between Phu Ly bridge and Cay Ke weir and between La Tinh and Can River, \nand (iii) rehabilitation of three flood diversion/retention spillways. The subproject will require land \nacquisition of 17.8 ha, including 8.6 ha of agricultural land, 1.0 ha of residential land, 8.0 ha of \nother land, and a small area of aquaculture land, affecting a total of 668 households (443 \nhouseholds lose agricultural land, 84 lose residential land, 137 lose other land, and 4 lose \naquaculture land). There will also be temporary effects on 1.4 ha of residential land belonging to \n121 households, 12.1 ha of agricultural land belonging to 821 households, and some 2,000 m2 \nof aquaculture land belonging to seven households. Some 22.0 ha of crops (affecting 1,371 \nhouseholds) and 6,188 graves will be cleared. \n \n \n \n ", "         Appendix 5           39  \n \nSUMMARY ETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  Ethnic minorities are among the poorest and least educated in Viet Nam. Although they \nrepresent only 14% of the population, they make up 29% of Viet Nam\u2019s poor. The incidence of \npoverty  among  ethnic  minorities  is  declining  slowly,  from  86%  in  1993  to  69%  in  2002, \ncompared with 54% to 23% for the majority Kinh. Viet Nam\u2019s housing and living standards \nsurvey (2000)1 shows that the gap in living standards between Kinh and ethnic minorities has \ngrown. In 12 of the 13 poorest provinces (those where more than 60% of the population are \nbelow the poverty line) ethnic minorities represent at least half the population. Expenditure per \ncapita  among  ethnic  minority  households  is  13%  lower  than  for  Kinh  households.  The \neducational attainment of household heads and spouses is lower, too, and endowments in \nterms of housing and other assets are below average as well.  \n \n2.  Ethnic minorities suffer from several interrelated causes of poverty such as geographic, \nsocial, and intellectual isolation; inadequate productive resources caused by lack of labor, land, \ncapital, or skills; excessive health risks brought on by food inadequacy caused by poor crop \nproductivity, disease, and unwanted births, among other factors; inadequate participation in \nplanning  and  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  relevant  programs;  and  environmental \ndegradation.2 The compounded effect of these characteristics is such that minority households \nare substantially poorer than the Kinh, although it is important to note in terms of focusing \ngovernment interventions that not all ethnic minority groups are equally disadvantaged.3  \n \nB.  Government Policy Towards Ethnic Minorities  \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s 1992 Constitution recognizes ethnic minorities as vulnerable groups and \nsupports the provision of special assistance to bring development benefits to them. A ministerial \nlevel agency was created in 1959 to address ethnic minority development. It was supplanted in \n1994  by  the  Committee  for  Ethnic  Minorities  and  Mountainous  Areas  (CEMMA)  which \ncoordinates and monitors ethnic minority development activities.  \n \n4.  The Government aims to integrate ethnic minority groups into Vietnamese society and \npromote their greater participation in mainstream economic life by addressing inequities of both \ndevelopment  and  infrastructure  provision,  particularly  in  remote  and  mountainous  areas. \nInvestments in specific projects are underpinned by country-wide poverty reduction programs \nthat provide direct assistance to poor households and communes. The Hunger Eradication and \nPoverty Reduction (HEPR) and Program 135, both initiated in 1998, cover a range of benefits \nfrom  exemption  of  fees  and  taxes  (under  HEPR)  to  the  provision  of  grants  for  small \ninfrastructure (under Program 135). Most of these initiatives come under CEMMA.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Vietnam General Statistical Office. 2000.

ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous people4 (IPP) focuses on the circumstances of indigenous \npeople and on measures to identify and satisfy their needs and development aspirations. The \nIPP  emphasizes  participation  of  ethnic  minority  groups  in  development  and  mitigation  of \nnegative effects or impacts on particular groups by virtue of their culture and traditions. All \nprojects and programs funded by ADB must comply with the various requirements of the IPP as \nwell as section F3/BP (May 2004) of the Operations Manual. Impacts on ethnic minorities are \nconsidered significant if they positively or negatively (i) affect their customary rights of use and \naccess to land and natural resources; (ii) change their socio-economic status; (iii) affect their \ncultural  and  communal  integrity;  (iv)  affect  their  health,  education,  livelihood  and/or  social \nsecurity status; or (v) alter or undermine the recognition of indigenous knowledge. The IPP \nrequires that a social analysis be undertaken to determine the likely scope of any such effects \nand that each project be categorized according to the level of planning required.  \n \n6.  The  IPP  requires  preparation  of  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)5  for \nprojects  likely  to  have  impacts  on  indigenous  communities.  The  EMDP  ascertains  the \nvulnerability of the indigenous community to the particular project, ensures that the community \nis given equal opportunity to benefit from and participate in the project, and specifies strategies \nand measures to avoid negative impacts. Where such impacts cannot be avoided, adequate \nand appropriate compensation must be provided.  \n \nD.  Ethnic Minorities in the Project Area \n7.  The Project will improve irrigation management and rehabilitate and complete irrigation \nand drainage infrastructure in six coastal provinces in central Viet Nam. It is compatible with the \nsocial  and  economic  institutions  of  the  communities  in  the  project  area  and,  apart  from \nresettlement effects, which will be mitigated by measures defined in resettlement plans for the \nsix subprojects, will not have any significant negative effects. This is largely because ethnic \nminority communities in the project area have already adopted the social and cultural institutions \nof national society, including sending their children to school and using the Kinh language. In \nrecent  years,  they  have  also  been  the  subject  of  Government  initiatives  that  encouraged \nrelocation  from  highland  to  lowland  areas.  Nevertheless,  ethnic  minority  groups  are \ndisadvantaged in many ways when trying to establish livelihoods in the \u201cmainstream\u201d and \npredominantly Kinh culture.  \n \n8.  During the preparatory studies, the social analyses carried out for the six subprojects \n(one in each target province) determined that Tra Cau in Quang Ngai Province is a category-A \nproject for which an EMDP is required.6 An EMDP is not required for the other five core projects \nbecause, with the exception of the Thach Thanh scheme in Than Hoa (see also para. 19), the \nsubprojects are located in areas with small proportions of ethnic minorities (i.e., 0\u20135%) and the \nhouseholds are dispersed among the Kinh population.  \n \n9.  The subproject, in Duc Pho and Mo Duc districts in the southern part of the province, \ncomprises the Liet Son-Chop Vung, Nui Ngang, and Dien Truong schemes. There are no ethnic \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 1998. Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila \n5  An EMDP relates to a community and is not prepared in cases where the affected persons represent a small \nminority of households in the community, or where the ethnic minority households are intermixed with Kinh \nhouseholds and do not maintain a separate or unique identity within the community. In such cases, the ethnic \nminority beneficiaries or affected persons are covered by other project measures such as the gender action plan.  \n6  A detailed EMDP was prepared for Tra Cau subproject and is in Supplementary Appendix B. ", "         Appendix 5           41  \nminorities in 12 of the beneficiary communes of Duc Pho and Mo Duc districts, but the directly \naffected people (APs) in the villages of Ho Sau and Dong Ram in Ba Kham commune are \nexclusively of the Hre ethnic group. Resettlement planning in the Tra Cau subproject surveyed \nall of the affected Hre households. This showed that the Hre are significantly worse off than the \nKinh in terms of education, literacy, and basic skills.7 Further, they are significantly poorer than \nthe Kinh and more likely to be engaged in subsistence agriculture as their sole means of \nlivelihood.  \n \n10.  In the project-affected villages, 39% of households have 4-5 members, while a third \nhave 2\u20133 members, and 13% have more than six members. About 8% of households have \nmore than seven members (the largest being 12). Hre households are larger than those of the \nKinh (one third of Hre households have seven or more members compared with 9% of Kinh \nhouseholds). Hre heads of household are younger than their Kinh equivalents\u2014about 44% of \nHre household heads are between 20\u201330 years old compared with 6% of Kinh household \nheads\u2014and fewer are 60 or older (17% compared with 25%). All household heads stated that \ntheir main source of livelihood is agriculture, but two thirds of Kinh households also raise \nlivestock. All Kinh households and 97% of Hre households have land-use right certificates \n(LURCs) for their residential, garden, and agricultural land. Only 13% of households have \nLURCs for forest land, with none of these in the name of a female head of household. Female-\nheaded households make up 13% of Hre and 22% of Kinh households. Male household heads, \nregardless of ethnicity, are significantly better educated than female household heads (35% of \nfemale  household  heads  compared  with  20%  of  male  household  heads  have  no  formal \neducation). No Hre female household heads had higher than primary education.  \n \n11.  In the subproject area, average per capita annual income is D2.7 million with a minimum \nof D438,000 and a maximum of D19.9 million. Disaggregation by ethnicity shows that 59% of \nHre households compared with 47% of Kinh households have two sources of income, while \n18% of Kinh households compared with 9% of Hre households have three sources of income. \nFemale-headed households have fewer income sources than male-headed households. Up to \n58% of households fall below the poverty line, with 13% in transitional, 20% in non-poor, and \n9% in wealthy categories.  \n \nE.  Summary Ethnic Minority Development Plan for the Tra Cau Subproject \n12.  The resettlement plan will mitigate the most significant adverse impacts of the Tra Cau \nsubproject. In addition, all households will be covered by the gender action plan (GAP) which \nwill target women to improve their participation in project activities and their access to project \nbenefits. The EMDP will ensure that Hre households in Ho Sau and Dong Ram villages in Ba \nKham commune benefit equitably from project interventions.  \n \n13.  The EMDP components have been determined through consultations with the commune \nand the two affected villages. Affected households requested project assistance for improving \nliteracy and other skills (such as health awareness) through community education, and provision \nof agricultural extension and training to improve the productivity of agriculture.8 They also \nrequested  assistance  to  identify  new  crops  and  products  as  a  means  of  diversifying  their \nsources of income. The EMDP covers the two participating villages and includes (i) training of \nmale and female adults aged 15\u201340 in literacy, numeracy, health and nutrition, livestock raising, \n                                                 \n7  No Hre household heads have an upper-secondary education, only 4% have a lower-secondary education, and \n53% of Hre household heads are without any formal education (compared with 2% for Kinh households). \n8  Agricultural extension will be provided under the resettlement plan and the gender action plan. \n ", "42  Appendix 5 \naccessing existing sources of credit, small business accounting and managing, and marketing \n(supported by the provision of a small library of books); and (ii) extension of the transition \nsubsistence for relocating households. \n \n14.  The main objective of the training is to enhance the Hre\u2019s livelihood opportunities by \ndeveloping basic literacy and numeracy skills, building confidence and self reliance, improving \nfamily health, creating opportunities for new livelihood activities, and fostering the development \nof natural leadership and managerial capacity within the community. The training courses will be \nimplemented by the provincial and district Vietnam Women\u2019s Union (VWU)9 which will work in \ncollaboration with district health care and department of agriculture and rural development \nagricultural extension staff. \n \n15.  The EMDP\u2019s basic elements will be reviewed and elaborated during detailed design of \nthe Tra Cau scheme by the Quang Ngai provincial project management unit (PPMU) with the \nassistance of project-financed consultants. The EMDP will be subject to the approval of the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and ADB. The PPMU will liaise with the \nprovincial and district women\u2019s unions to implement the EMDP and will ensure that funds are \navailable as needed. The EMDP\u2019s overall cost estimate is about $36,000 (including a 10% \ncontingency). EMDP implementation will be monitored and reported upon as part of subproject \nperformance monitoring. \n \nF.  Summary Ethnic Minority Development Framework \n16.  Detailed design of the six subprojects will include screening to identify any significant \nethnic minority impacts that were not discerned during the project preparatory studies. If the \nscreening  process  shows  that  ethnic  minority  groups  will  be  at  a  disadvantage  in  the \ndevelopment process or will encounter constraints on their ability to enjoy project benefits, then \nan EMDP will be prepared in accordance with this framework to reflect their special needs.10 \nSimilarly, a process will be established to deal with issues or concerns raised during project \nimplementation. This summary ethnic minority development framework11 has been prepared to \nguide the preparation and implementation of any EMDP that may be required for subprojects.  \n \n17.  Particular attention will be given, for example, to the Thach Thanh scheme in Than Hoa \nwhere the Muong constitute 58% of the population. The social analysis found that most of the \nscheme\u2019s 145 villages (62%) are mixed Kinh and Muong. It noted that the two communities \nhave lived together for some 200 years and that the Muong no longer retain a unique or \nculturally separate identity, way of life, language, or style of dress.12 \n \n18.  The basic principles are the following: \n  (i)  Adverse  impacts  on  ethnic  minority  communities,  as  distinct  and  vulnerable \ngroups, should be avoided or minimized by exploring all viable options. \n  (ii)  Ethnic minorities and any other persons directly affected by a subproject are \nentitled to compensation for lost and affected assets, incomes, and businesses at \n                                                 \n9  VWU is a mass organization comprising a comprehensive district and village network. \n10  Similar attention will be given to identifying and addressing the special needs of any other disadvantaged groups \nsuch as the landless, poor, female-headed households, and the disabled. \n11  A more detailed EMDF is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n12  Where ethnic minority and non-ethnic minority groups live in the same project location, the IPP only requires an \naction plan or program to account for any specific needs.

Any new EMDP will include \n  (i)  a brief description of the subproject and likely scope of its impacts on ethnic \nminority communities; \n  (ii)  policy and legal framework of Government and ADB in respect of ethnic minority \ndevelopment;  \n  (iii)  ethnic minority development principles to be applied to all subprojects under the \nProject;  \n  (iv)  procedures to be followed for implementation of the EMDP; and  \n  (vi)  administrative and financing arrangements for implementation, monitoring, and \nevaluating the EMDP.  \n \n20.  Key information in the EMDP will be disclosed to the APs before the EMDP is submitted \nto ADB and MARD for approval. Information disclosed to the APs will be in the form of full or \nsummary EMDP, or as information booklets and leaflets, and will be in a language that can be \nunderstood by the APs. Copies will be made available for public reference in an accessible \nplace.15 Any EMDP prepared under the Project will be made freely available to all APs and other \ninterested parties, in English and Vietnamese, and will be posted on ADB\u2019s website following \nADB and MARD approval of the related subproject detailed design. \n                                                 \n13  Where people are significantly affected by the loss of assets, incomes, and jobs, compensation solely for lost \nassets may not be adequate to restore their economic and social base. Such people will be entitled to rehabilitation \nassistance for restoring incomes and living standards. \n14  People without legal rights are referred to as non-titled in the Operations Manual Section F2/BP (October 2003), \nand include those who have no recognizable rights or claims to the land that they are occupying and/or using. The \npolicy also states that restoration measures must be determined in consultation with affected communities, \nincluding those people who might not be formally recognized in national legislation. \n15  The relevant requirements for this are set out in ADB. 2005.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national   Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?     priority in country poverty   \n   No  partnership agreement?    No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam:  \n \nPoverty in Viet Nam is concentrated in rural areas, where around 85% of the poor live. Nearly 80% of poor \nhouseholds are engaged in agriculture as their primary occupation. The sector is therefore important for development \nof irrigated agriculture to improve food security, income generation, job creation, and general quality of life in rural \nareas. The sector accounts for 20% of gross domestic product, 73% of the labor force, and 30% of the country's \nexports. The central region\u2014where the Project is located\u2014has 29% of the country\u2019s population and about 38% of the \ncountry\u2019s poor. Viet Nam was the first signatory to ADB\u2019s rural water and poverty action initiative. The Project is one \nof several aimed at addressing the multiple dimensions of poverty and development in the central region. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe poverty classification of the Project is targeted intervention. The Project comprises a number of elements that will \nhave direct benefits for the poor: \n \nA social and poverty assessment was carried out for each of the subprojects in compliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nIncorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations (1993). It included an assessment of the incidence of poverty \nwhich revealed the nature and perceptions of its causes: (i) lack of access to functioning irrigation and drainage, (ii) \nlow level of education, (iii) landlessness, (iv) poor access to market centers and social services, (v) lack of access to \nlow interest credit, (vi) surplus labor within the households and chronic unemployment or underemployment \nespecially among the young, (vii) gender-related factors, and (viii) poor health, especially caused by waterborne \ndiseases and malaria. \n \nThe social analysis identified specific groups within the population who are particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged \nand unable to benefit fully from project interventions without some social preparation. There are significant numbers \nof poor landless households, many of them headed by women, and a high percentage of children living in poor \nhouseholds, many of whom have health problems related to Agent Orange. It also identified pockets of large \nnumbers of pensioners and disability support recipients, as well as some ethnic minorities. \n \nUsing the poverty line of D1.8 million/person/year established through poverty mapping (2003), poverty incidence \nranges from 35% in the Quang Ngai project area to 63% in Thanh Hoa. Improvements in irrigation and agricultural \nproduction are key steps in poverty reduction. The Project includes interventions to specifically target the poor and \nvulnerable and thereby enhance the poverty reduction impact.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \n \nStakeholders, beneficiaries and directly affected people have been consulted and will continue to be so during \nsubproject design and implementation. A participatory and consultative methodology was adopted to undertake the \nsocial  analysis  during  the  feasibility  study.  It  involved  (i)  initial  field  reconnaissance  discussions  with  project \nstakeholders; (ii) group interviews in 80% of communes; (iii) detailed survey questionnaires of beneficiary households \nand surveys of households directly affected by land acquisition; (iv) a series of stakeholder workshops in the six \nsubprojects; (v) interviews with key government staff, nongovernment organizations, and other funding agencies; (vi) \ninterviews with ethnic minorities; and (vii) interviews with women. \n \nDuring project implementation the participation of stakeholders will be further supported and deepened with the \nassistance of a team of community facilitators. This will ensure close linkages are established between the project \n ", "52  Appendix 10 \nimplementation team and the community. It will facilitate a participatory approach to detailed design of the irrigation \nworks through formation of water user groups and arranging farmer walk-throughs to finalize alignments in \naccordance with the groups\u2019 preferences. The institutional capacity of the groups will subsequently be developed to \nfacilitate sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) of the system. The community facilitators will also be \nresponsible for identifying and assisting disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. \n \nParticipation strategy required: Yes, included in resettlement, ethnic minority development plan (EMDP), gender \naction plan (GAP), HIV/AIDS awareness program, and participatory development activities. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe social analysis confirmed that the burden of work and poverty in the project area is disproportionately borne by \nwomen; from 12% (Tay Nam Huong Tra\u2013Hue) to 48% (La Tinh\u2013Binh Dinh) of the households are headed by women. \nThese women are widowed, abandoned, or left alone for long periods because of male seasonal migration. A number \nof single elderly women live alone on their farms. Compared to male-headed households, these female-headed \nhouseholds have a lower level of education; inadequate adult labor; limited access to land, credit, and agricultural \nextensions; and in a number of cases lower incomes. A high proportion fall below the poverty line. A GAP has been \nprepared and will be implemented to address these issues. \n \nHas an output been prepared?   Yes   No \n \nE.

Introduction \n1.  Financial and economic analyses were undertaken to evaluate the sustainability of each \nsubproject and the Project as a whole. The financial analysis examined the sustainability of the \nproposed  irrigation  from  the  farmers\u2019  point  of  view;  economic  analysis  determined  the \nincremental benefits, including increased primary sector production, domestic water supply, and \nflood  protection.  The  economic  analysis  was  disaggregated  to  demonstrate  the  returns  to \ninvestment from (i) irrigation infrastructure improvements and (ii) institutional strengthening of \nirrigation  service  providers\u2014irrigation  management  companies  (IMCs).  The  institutional \nstrengthening addresses risks associated with inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M) of \ninfrastructure. While the institutional strengthening is assessed against the project impacts, \nsignificant positive externalities will be generated from the impact of these reforms on the full \ncommand areas of irrigation schemes under the IMC\u2019s control.  \n \nB.  Major Assumptions \n2.  The Project has an implementation period of 6 years and an assumed economic life of \n30 years with no residual value. For the analysis the interbank exchange rate of D15,800 per \ndollar at the time of the appraisal has been used. A discount rate of 12% has been used to \nascertain the net present value (NPV) and also as the hurdle rate for the economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR). \n \n3.  Financial costs and benefits are estimated in constant mid-2003 terms. Technical and \nfinancial coefficients are based on the findings of the field surveys during the feasibility study in \n2004, and were adjusted for the economic analysis to 2005 terms during loan appraisal. The \nanalysis uses a world price numeraire, where economic prices for traded outputs and inputs are \nbased on the World Bank commodity price projections. Prices for rice paddy, maize, shrimp, \nand phosphatic and potassic fertilizers are estimated at import parity (Supplementary Appendix \nE). All other inputs and outputs have been valued at competitive market prices, after adjusting \nfor taxes, duties, and an implicit overvaluation of the exchange rate. Electricity used in pumping \nhas been valuated at its long-run marginal cost of supply. A conversion factor of 0.9 has been \nused to express civil works in efficiency terms. In the case of unskilled labor, a shadow wage \nrate factor of 0.6 has been used to express the wages in terms of opportunity costs. For semi-\nskilled labor a shadow wage rate factor of 0.7 has been used. Domestic prices of non-traded \ngoods and services have been converted to their economic equivalent by multiplying their \nfinancial prices by a standard conversion factor of 0.9. \n \n4.  Crop models were prepared using the FARMOD software for a range of farm sizes \nwithin each of the schemes, based on expected yield, cropping intensity, and cropping patterns. \nFor the financial analysis, only hired labor has been costed while for the economic analysis both \nfamily and hired labor have been included (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \nC.  Project Benefits \n5.  Benefit Area and Households. The Project will establish a service-oriented approach \nto  irrigation  water  management  where  provincial  agencies  and  the  water  users  will  be \nempowered to jointly manage irrigation schemes within the six project provinces. This will be \ndone by (i) restructuring the IMCs as financially autonomous entities, and forming water user \ngroups (WUGs) and associations (WUAs) to participate fully in irrigation management; and (ii) \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \nconstructing  and  rehabilitating  water  management  infrastructure  in  each  subproject  area. \nNatural  disaster  risk  reduction  measures  will  complement  the  physical  improvements.  The \nscope of institutional reform and strengthening will be determined through a business planning \nprocess that will define a time-bound action plan for moving the management of irrigation \nschemes onto a more viable basis. The six irrigation subprojects involve a total of 33,636 \nhectares (ha) of command area associated with about 400,500 beneficiaries. The cropping \nintensity is predicted to increase from 155% to 172% across the total project as the cropped \narea increases from 52,432 ha to 57,755 ha.

Quantified  Benefits.  With  the  project,  the  main  agricultural  benefits  arise  from \nincreased cropping intensities and improved dry season rice yields. Average yields for each \nsubproject are currently lower than those of the provinces, mainly because of inadequate or \npoorly timed water, especially at the tertiary level of the command area and during the dry \nseason. Poor infrastructure is a major constraint. Crop yields are lower than the average for \nwell-irrigated systems in the region, and it is anticipated that improvements to infrastructure, \nirrigation  management,  and  crop  husbandry  will  provide  yield  increases  of  10\u201315%  from \nirrigated crops. Currently non-irrigated areas that are to be converted to irrigation will produce \n50% more than those figures.  \n \n7.  Without the project, IMCs will continue to under invest in O&M of the schemes leading to \ndeclining  command  areas,  falling  cropping  intensities,  and  declining  yields.  In  such \ncircumstances  it  is  predicted  the  irrigated  area  will  decline  by  0\u201350%,  depending  on  the \ncondition of existing infrastructure and the capability of the management provider.

The provision of increased and reliable water will result in a significant increase in \naquaculture production. A total of 3,200 ha of rice/fish production system is predicted to develop \n ", "  Appendix 11       55  \nin the Thuong My Trung scheme along with expanded intensive shrimp production in Thach \nHan, Tra Cau, and La Tinh subproject areas. \n \n9.  Table 3 shows the relative importance of the predicted incremental outputs of rice, \nsugarcane, and shrimp. The markets for rice are driven by the continued expansion of rice \nexports  from  Viet  Nam,  and  the  increased  production  is  not  expected  to  impact  on  local \nmarkets. Shrimp production from intensive pond systems also targets the export market and will \nbe linked to existing value and export chains. Increased sugarcane production targets surplus \ncapacity in local mills, but its impact is not clearly understood.  \n \nTable A11.3: Estimated Incremental Output by Province (tons) \n \nCommodity  Incremental  Thanh  Quang  Quang  Thua  Quang  Binh \nOutput  Hoa  Binh  Tri  Thien  Ngai  Dinh \n(tons)  Hue \nRice  54,574  5,813  12,813  20,700  5,638  (796)  10,406 \nMaize  3,227  1,817  0  0  0  0  1,411 \nSugarcane  126,485  52,220  0  0  0  70,580  3,685 \nSweet Potato  (2,167)  0  (901)  0  (1,050)  0  (216) \nHot Pepper  4,438  0  0  4,438  0  0  0 \nGroundnut  5,817  0  0  1,213  2,935  681  988 \nCassava  (28,757)  0  0  (9,570)  (2,159)  (15,168)  (1,860) \nCotton cum groundnut  693  0  0  0  0  693  0 \nAquaculture  3,288  0  3,288  0  0  0  0 \nShrimp  3,160  0  0  160  0  1,560  1,440 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n10.  About 80,000 households will benefit directly from the Project in the form of increased \noutput of agricultural products because of (i) higher cropping intensities (especially in areas \ncurrently under rain-fed cultivation), (ii) higher yields because of wider use of high yielding \nvarieties, (iii) stable and full irrigation water supply, and (iv) incremental output of shrimp and \nfish. The main crops cultivated in the subproject area are paddy, sugarcane, groundnut and \nmaize. Implementation of the six subprojects would increase the cultivated area from 52,432 ha \nwithout the Project to 57,755 ha with the Project. Fish are raised in over 3,000 ha of rice fields \nduring summer and autumn in Thuong My Trung (Quang Binh). Shrimp are raised in (i) Tra Cau \n(Quang Ngai) on 450 ha in the winter and spring and on 300 ha in the summer and autumn, (ii) \nLa Tinh (Binh Dinh) on 300 ha in the winter and spring and in the summer and autumn, and (iii) \nThach Han (Quang Tri) on 200 ha. \n \n11.  Non-Production Benefits. Two subprojects have flood control components that mitigate \nthe influence of floods for the command area. The Tay Nam Huong Tra subproject will shift \nareas currently irrigated by pumping to gravity irrigation resulting in saved power costs valued at \nD277  million  per  year  in  2004  terms.  Most  subprojects  provide  improved  domestic  water \nsources that reduce the burden and cost of collecting water from sometimes remote sources.  \n \n12.  Non-Quantified Benefits. Apart from cost savings and production benefits, there are a \nnumber  of  non-quantified  benefits,  including  (i)  improved  integration  of  farm  planning  and \nirrigation  water  management,  (ii)  improved  efficiency  arising  from  the  introduction  and \nempowerment of WUGs/WUAs, (iii) reduced costs and improved quality of operations provided \nby IMCs, and (iv) improved service provision leading to higher revenues and greater financial \nsustainability of all irrigation schemes managed by participating IMCs.  \n \n ", "56  Appendix 11 \n13.  Most non-quantified benefits derive from institutional improvements that are critically \nneeded to sustain the quantified benefits. For example, the creation and capacity building of \nWUGs provide significant productivity and cost-efficiency benefits that have been demonstrated \nin earlier technical assistance, including reduced water use, higher yields, lower management \ncosts, and less conflict over water. The full set of benefits includes empowered water users that \nlink closely with management service providers through greater transparency and a better \ninformed constituency during project implementation.  \n \nD.  Assessment of Financial Returns to Irrigators \n14  The effect of the proposed investment on farm households was assessed in financial \nterms from the farmer\u2019s perspective. Representative farm models for differing land use types \nand  farm  sizes  were  developed.  The  parameters  for  the  farm  models  are  based  on  the \ninformation obtained from a survey of farmers and public consultation meetings conducted for \nthe feasibility study. Typical farms are small, average, and large and would be represented in \nagro-ecosystems as either (i) lowland dominated by paddy or (ii) highland dominated by upland \ncrops. Crop input and output parameters (yields, fertilizer rates, labor, etc.) are combined with \nfinancial prices collected during surveys and field investigations.  \n \n15.  Farm models were generated using FARMOD for both the \u201cwithout project\u201d and \u201cwith \nproject\u201d scenarios and are based on current and anticipated cropping patterns and crop budgets \nfor the subprojects. The farm model analysis was conducted for a project period of 20 years and \nis summarized in Table A11.4.  \n \n16.  The farm analysis  includes the development of on-farm irrigation facilities and field \nchannels, with exception of the Tay Nam Huong Tra subproject where no on-farm development \nis required. One family labor is assumed to be available for most agricultural activities for small \nand medium-sized farms, while for the large farm model two family laborers are assumed to be \navailable.  \n \n17.  Farm  household  benefits  assessed  in  the  incremental  return  to  family  labor  is \nsignificantly positive with increases ranging from 126\u2013179% for large farms and from 188\u2013227% \nfor small farmers (Table A11.5).  \n \n ", "  Appendix 11       57  \nTable A11.4: Summary of the Farm Model Analysis \n \nFarm  Cropping  Farm benefits after  Return to family  Incremental \nNo    size  intensity (%)  financing (1000 D)  labor (1000 D)  return/day \n      (ha)  P/FWO  FW  P/FWO  FW  P/FWO  FW  family labor \n1  Thach Thanh / Paddy farm           \n   Small  0.3  200  200  1,399  3,134  15  34   - \n   Large  1.0  150  200  4,502  9,246  21  37  119 \n  Thach Thanh / Upland farm           \n   Small  0.3  100  100  1,205  2,542  19  41   - \n   Large  1.0  100  100  3,350  7,808  19  45   - \n2  Thuong My Trung / Paddy farm           \n   Small  0.2  175  200  1,371  2,707  34  62  393 \n   Large  1.0  180  200  7,787  12,337  47  77   - \n  Thuong My Trung / Paddy-fish farm           \n   Small  0.2  175  300  1,454  4,192  36  72  156 \n   Large  1.0  180  300  6,217  19,562  38  89  237 \n3  Thach Han / Paddy farm           \n   Small  0.2  175  200  2,126  2,857  60  71  162 \n   Large  1.0  180  200  9,507  13,483  60  84  9,941 \n  Thach Han / Upland farm           \n   Small  0.2  175  200  1,677  2,628  42  61  366 \n   Large farm  1.0  180  200  7,295  11,505  35  58   - \n4  Tay Nam Huong Tra / Paddy farm           \n   Small  0.2  175  200  1,276  2,408  33  54  184 \n   Large  1.0  180  200  6,047  11,040  37  64  520 \n  Tay Nam Huong Tra / Upland farm           \n   Small  0.2  100  200  572  1,982  21  38  58 \n   Large   1.0  100  200  2,799  9,667  21  41  67 \n5  Tra Cau / Paddy farm           \n   Small  0.2  175  200  1,655  2,564  45  58  121 \n   Large  1.0  180  200  8,553  12,018  53  67  192 \n  Tra Cau / Upland farm           \n   Small  0.2  100  100  1,173  1,921  26  43   - \n   Large  1.0  100  100  4,867  8,607  28  49   - \n6  La Tinh / Paddy farm           \n   Small  0.2  225  250  1,740  2,963  41  62  204 \n   Large  1.0  240  260  9,198  14,813  43  65  369 \n  La Tinh / Upland farm           \n   Small  0.2  200  250  1,313  2,783  28  46  107 \n   Large  1.0  190  250  5,882  13,640  29  52  126 \nD = dong, FW = future with, FWO = future without. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nTable A11.5: Return to Household Labor \u2013 Without and With Project \n \n  Large Farms  Small Farms \nSubproject  Without  With  Incremental  Without  With  Incremental \nThach Thanh   1.3  2.3  1.0  0.95  2.15  1.20 \nThuong My Trung  3.0  4.9  1.9  2.15  3.92  1.77 \nThach Han  3.8  5.3  1.5  3.80  4.49  0.70 \nTay Nam Huong Tra  2.3  4.1  1.7  1.33  2.41  1.08 \nTra Cau  3.35  4.24  0.89  1.65  2.72  1.08 \nLa Tinh  1.84  3.29  1.46  2.59  3.92  1.33 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \nE.  Assessment of Economic Returns \n18.  Investment and Recurrent Costs. All costs are in constant 2005 terms. Investment \ncosts are net of price contingencies and interest during construction. Local costs have been \nadjusted by the standard conversion factor of 0.9. For each subproject, costs are presented in \ntwo subsets: (i) those defined by the construction program, including design, resettlement and \ncompensation,  construction,  and  environmental  management;  and  (ii)  the  institutional \nstrengthening programs for the provincial departments of agriculture and rural development \n(DARD), IMCs, and WUGs. Costs associated with the national institutional arrangements and \nproject management, including the gender action plan, HIV/AIDS awareness program, and \nproject monitoring, are included as overheads for the overall Project. \n \n19.  Economic Worth. The economic analysis shows that EIRRs for the subprojects are 16\u2013\n18% when the analysis includes only the construction costs (Table A11.6). The proportion of \nbenefit derived from agricultural output is 68% while nearly 30% is derived from both shrimp and \naquaculture.  When  the  costs  of  institutional  strengthening  are  included  the  EIRRs  for  the \nsubprojects range from 14\u201317%. The overall project EIRR is estimated to be 16.1% based on \nthe construction costs only, and 15% with the inclusion of all institutional strengthening and \nproject  management  costs.  The  level  of  non-quantified  benefits  from  the  institutional \nstrengthening is likely to be substantial because the IMCs that will be strengthened operate over \nmuch larger areas than the command areas of the target subprojects. The Project is considered \nto be economically viable, although a stringent viability analysis will be needed once final \ndesigns  have  been  prepared  and  costs  estimated  more  accurately.  The  switching  values \nindicate the investment to be relatively insensitive to increased costs or reduced benefits with \nthe exception of Huang Tra (Thua Thien Hue Province) which is sensitive to changes in both \nbenefits and costs. \n \nTable A11.6: Estimated Subproject and Project Economic Worth \n \n  EIRR  NPV (12%)  Switching value \n  Construction  Construction Construction Construction Construction Only \n    and    and  Reduced  Increased  \nInstitution  Institution  Benefits  Costs \nThach  16.5  16.1  26,157  24,782  -22%  +33% \nThanh \nThach  16.9  15.7  63,628  51,434  -21%  +34% \nHan \nTra Cau  16.4  15.2  45,790  35,612  -20%  +29% \nThuong  18.1  16.4  61,309  51,550  -27%  +44% \nMy Trung \nTay Nam  16.9  14.4  21,798  12,390  -13%  +19% \nHuong Tra \nLa Tinh  18.2  17  65,745  55,946  -26%  +42% \nTotal  16.1  15  237,877  185,115  -18%  +26% \nProject \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 11       59  \nF.  Institutional Analysis \n20.  Each irrigation scheme is managed through an IMC under the control of provincial \nauthorities. IMCs are state-owned enterprises that face significant limitations in their autonomy \nand role. The national and provincial regulations under which the IMCs work leave little freedom \nfor local decision making. The IMCs are financed through water-use fees whose levels are \ndetermined by provincial authorities. The revenue provides sufficient revenue for the fixed and \nvariable costs of the organizations but not for the full O&M costs of the irrigation schemes which \ncontinue to degrade. The IMCs have little knowledge of the water users and their needs, or of \nthe irrigation schemes they serve\u2014all of which limits their ability to prioritize the allocation and \nuse  of  water  and  to  plan  maintenance  programs.  During  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance,  their  management  capacity  was  assessed  as  weak,  with  limited  capacity  and \nopportunity for strategic decision making.  \n \n21.  The financial viability of IMCs is \u201cat risk\u201d because of their (i) lack of strategic focus, (ii) \ncontinued focus on engineering works and skills that are no longer required, (iii) inability to \ndeliver reliable and timely water (which reduces water fee collection rates), (iv) inappropriate \nwater fees, (v) non-involvement of water users in the management and operation of irrigation \nschemes, and (vi) unclear ownership of irrigation assets. Most IMCs operate with financial \ndeficits,  which  are  financed  through  national  and  provincial  subsidies.  Financial  resources \nconstrain O&M of schemes.  \n \n22.  For Thanh Hoa, a 50% increase in water revenue is needed to break even on current \ncost structures. To additionally finance the predicted incremental increase in O&M costs, a \n100% increase in water fees is needed. The Project will provide significant support to develop \nbusiness plans that will move the IMCs toward financial autonomy. The release of project funds \nfor  civil  works  in  the  subprojects  will  be  conditional  upon  the  IMCs\u2019  providing  acceptable \nbusiness plans. This will mitigate the risk of increased deficits among the IMCs. \n \nG.  Risk \n23.  The economic analysis assumes that the whole of the net command area is converted to \nirrigated production phased in over 3 years following construction. The major risk is the ability of \nthe DARDs to achieve the construction schedule and of the IMCs to provide water in a timely \nand reliable manner. The risks have been addressed through the linking of construction to the \ndevelopment of business plans and through the use of a extended construction schedule based \non 0%, 10%, 25% 35%, 20%, 10% by project year. The level of water-user support provided for \non-farm  works  and  the  establishment  of  WUGs/WUAs  will  ensure  that  the  beneficiaries \nparticipate in the design and implementation of tertiary irrigation development early on. This \nsupport will increase awareness of the potential benefits of the subproject and help create a \npartnership of WUGs and IMCs to strengthen O&M of the infrastructure provided. Training for \nimproved  irrigation  management  will  be  provided.  In  addition,  beneficiaries  will  avail  of \nagricultural extension services to improve returns from irrigated agriculture and aquaculture.  \n \nH.  Poverty Analysis \n \n24.  The average income level of beneficiaries in the six subprojects will be increased by \nD57,700 per capita per month. This ranges from more than D100,000 in Thuong My Trung and \nLa Tinh to D30,000\u201354,000 in the remaining subprojects. Under the Project, more than 6,000 \npoor households will become nonpoor with an overall poverty impact ratio of 15%, including \n28% for La Tinh, 22% for Tra Cau, 21% for Thach Thanh and Thuong My Trung, 10% for Tay \nNam Huong Tra, and 8% for Thach Han (Table A11.7). \n ", " \nTable A11.7: Poverty Impact  \n6\n  0\n \n \n  Items  Unit  Total  Thach Thanh  Thuong  Thach Han  Tay Nam  Tra Cau  La Tinh    \n \n \nMy Trung  Huong Tra  A\np\nA.
