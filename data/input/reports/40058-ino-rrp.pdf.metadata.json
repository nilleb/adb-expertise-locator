It  supports  the  broad  goal  of  the  RPJM  to \nstimulate  higher  and  sustainable  economic  growth  (to  7%  average \nannual  growth  by  2009  from  around  4%  prior  to  2004)  and  halve \npoverty (from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% by 2009). To achieve these goals, \nDPSP-2 supports wide-ranging reforms in four core areas to (i) improve \nmacroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, (ii) promote investments, \n(iii)  strengthen  the  public  financial  management  and  anticorruption \nframework, and (iv) improve the delivery of public services. DPSP-2 is \nproposed  as  a  single  tranche  operation  based  on  a  range  of  up-front \nactions taken by the Government in the core areas. \n \n\nin \n\ninvolvement \n\nThe  DPL  series  aims  to  harmonize  policy  reform  support  from  key \nthe  DPL  process \ndevelopment  partners.  ADB\u2019s \neffectively builds on and deepens sector-specific reforms supported by \nADB  through  its  past  operations,  as  well  as  planned  operations  under \nthe new country strategy and program 2006-2009. \n \nADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  DPL  stems  from  its  endeavors  to  reduce \ntransaction costs for its developing member countries. The approach is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  reform  agenda,  as  outlined  in  the  Long-Term \nStrategic  Framework  2001-2015,  and  the  Middle-Income  Country \nInitiative.  Participation  in  DPL  helps  implement  and  fulfill  ADB\u2019s \nobligations  to  the  Rome  Declaration  on  harmonizing  procedures  of \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  development  institutions  (February  2003)  and \nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (March 2005).  \n \nThe  impact  of  DPSP-2  will  be  in  the  form  of  higher  economic  growth \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram \nDescription \n\n \n\nRationale \n\n \nImpact and \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nOutcome \n\n \nCluster  \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Period and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \n\n(i) \n\ninclude: \n\nIts  principal  outcomes \n\nthat is sustained over the medium-term and lower levels of poverty and \nunemployment. \nimproved \nmacroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  better  investment  climate,  (iii)  good \ngovernance in public administration, and (iv) improved delivery of public \nservices.  \n \nFor DPSP-2, the Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of \n$200  million.  The  Government  envisages  support  from  ADB  of  around \n$200 million for DPSP-3, which will be reconfirmed during DPSP review \nand  processing.  DPSP-2  provides  parallel  cofinancing  for  the  World \nBank\u2019s  DPL-3,  for  which  the  Government  has  requested  $600 million \nfrom  the  World  Bank.  The  Government  has  also  requested  the \nGovernment of Japan to cofinance the DPSP-2/DPL-3. \n \nA  single  tranche  program  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.75% per annum; conversion options that may be exercised \nin accordance with the draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and \nADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft program loan agreement. \n \nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of loan \neffectiveness. \n \nThe DPSP-2 covers progress made in general macroeconomic and key \nhigh-level sector reforms during 2006. All actions included in the policy \nmatrix have been implemented within the year. The DPSP-2 fits within \nthe  overall  reform  agenda  supported  under  the  DPLs,  which  cover \n2003\u20132007.  DPSP-3  will  be  implemented  from  January  to  December \n2007, and will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of loan \neffectiveness. \n \nCoordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs (CMEA) \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \nRelated  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed to the Republic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting \nimport  documentation  will  be  required,  if,  during  each  year  when  loan \nproceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Indonesia\u2019s  total \nimports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports, \nand  imports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance,  is \nequal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be \ndisbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import \n\n\f \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nSafeguards \n\n \n\niii\n\ndocumentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be  required.  ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nThe key benefits expected from the DPSP cluster are as follows: \n \n(i)  Progress  toward  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  objectives  of \nmacroeconomic \nimproved \nand \ninvestment climate, reduced corruption, and improved governance. \n(ii)  Consolidation of recent macroeconomic and policy reforms leading \nto  the  formulation  of  a  credible  medium-term  public  expenditure \nframework,  backed  by  measures \nto  curtail  wasteful  public \nspending. \nInstitutional  development  within  government  institutions,  Bank \nIndonesia, and banks. \n\ncreditworthiness, \n\nstability \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  Greater  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  stemming  from \n\nthe introduction of the deposit protection scheme. \n\n(v)  Sustained  ADB  engagement \n\nthe \nGovernment on the direction and content of, and strategies for, its \neconomic,  structural,  and  institutional  reform  agenda\u2014with  the \nDPSP  series  providing  for  policy  continuity  and  consistency  in \nsectors where ADB has been actively involved. \n\nin  policy  dialogue  with \n\n(vi)  Facilitation  of  sector-specific  reforms  in  areas  where  ADB  is \n\nproviding or planning support.   \n\n(vii)  Harmonization  and  parallel  financing  by  the  key  development \npartners  (ADB,  World  Bank,  and  Government  of  Japan)  around  a \ncommon  policy \nthe  resulting \nendorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s  sound  policy  implementation \nand macroeconomic management. \n\nframework  and  dialogue,  and \n\n \nThe implementation of the DPSP series is subject to the following risks: \n \n(i)  Policy and coordination risks. Economic volatility could worsen if \nthe  Government  does  not  sustain  the  reform  momentum  to  follow \nup on the recent reduction in fuel subsidies (including maintaining \nappropriate interest rates and investment climate reforms). External \nvulnerabilities  must  also  be  considered.  However,  following  the \ncurrency market volatility in August 2005, the need for rapid policy \nadjustment  on \nline  with  key  global \ndevelopments  is  clearly  recognized.  The  Government  and  Bank \nIndonesia  have  considerably  enhanced  their  coordination,  which \nwill be reinforced by measures under DPSP-2. \n\nthe  domestic \n\nfront \n\nin \n\n \n\n(ii)  Fiduciary  constraints.  Despite  the  improvements  under  way, \nthere  are  continuing  concerns  over  the  utilization  of  public \nresources.  The  overall  fiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since \n2001 (with the Country Financial Accountability Assessment) have \nindicated  considerable \nfiduciary \nimprovements \nenvironment in Indonesia. Ongoing programs supported by several \ndevelopment partners provide significant TA support to strengthen \nfiduciary  governance.  The  focus  on  the  Treasury  Single  Account \nimplementation will significantly enhance transparency. The DPSP \n\nthe  overall \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n\fcluster  will  help  enhance  overall  accountability  as  well,  as \ndemonstrated  for  instance  by  submission  of  government-wide \nfinancial  statements \ntheir  widespread \ndissemination. \n\nto  parliament  and \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii)  Coordination and capacity constraints. Effective implementation \nof  reforms  has  been  hindered  in  the  past  by  lack  of  coordination \nbetween ministries and government agencies, and lack of capacity. \nLack  of  such  coordination  could  slow  down  reforms.  Changing \nincentives  and  improving  performance  orientation  in  the  civil \nservice\u2014an area supported under the DPSP cluster\u2014will be key to \nalleviating  these  constraints.  Some  ministries  (e.g., Ministry  of \nFinance) have begun to promote civil servants on the basis of merit \nrather  than  age  or  seniority.  To  address  capacity  constraints,  the \nGovernment has begun to use technical assistance (TA) resources \nmore  effectively  for  implementation  purposes  and  on-the-job \ntraining. \n\n(iv)  Public  opposition  to  reforms.  The  public  and  special  interest \ngroups  generally  oppose  tariff  reforms  and  some  aspects  of \ninvestment  climate  reforms  (such  as  labor).  The  Government \nmanaged the fuel subsidy reduction well, while labor reforms have \nslowed  down.  The  DPSP  cluster  allows  for  flexibility,  enabling  the \nGovernment to build consensus for reforms to ensure that they are \naccepted.       \n\n \n(v)  Heightened  security  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and \nregional conflicts and terrorism could slow foreign direct investment \nand set back the recovering tourism industry. The Government and \nlaw enforcement authorities have taken a range of measures aimed \nat rebuilding public and investor confidence. \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  (i)  proposed \nprogram  cluster  of  two  loans  for  the  Development  Policy  Support  Program  (DPSP)  in  the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  loan  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  second \nDevelopment  Policy  Support  Program  (DPSP-2),  which  is  subprogram  1  of  the  proposed \ncluster. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nSector Performance, Issues, and Opportunities  \n\n2. \nIn the past few years, Indonesia has provided compelling reasons for a positive outlook, \nas  it  has  become  more  stable,  democratic,  and  increasingly  transparent.  The  concern  is  no \nlonger  one  of  recovery,  but  of  accelerating  and  sustaining  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth  at  7\u20138%  levels,  and  translating  that  into  lower  poverty,  more  jobs,  and  reduced \nvulnerability. The Government\u2019s overall goals are to halve poverty by the end of the decade to \nabout  8%,  reduce  unemployment  significantly  from  the  current  high  levels  of  10.4%,  and \nachieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  targets.  To  achieve  these  goals,  the \nGovernment  is  poised  to  pursue  a  pro-growth  agenda,  coupled  with  better  governance  within \nthe public administration and improvements in public service delivery. Progress has been made \non  all  fronts,  albeit  slowly  in  some  areas.  In  particular,  Indonesia  is  in  critical  need  of,  among \nother  things,  continuous  improvements  in  the  investment  climate  and  greater  performance \norientation  within  the  civil  service.  The  DPSP  cluster  allows  the  Government  to  work  with  the \ndevelopment partners in a flexible manner to implement high level macroeconomic and strategic \nreforms,  addressing  constraints  that  impede  growth  and  poverty  reduction  through  committed \nannual engagement that provides predictability of support. As such, its sector coverage is fairly \nbroad  and  it  adopts  a  thematic  approach  to  improve  overall  economic  governance.  The  CSP \nprovides  for  deeper  sector  level  interventions  sequenced  at  regular  intervals  to  complement \nmacroeconomic reform support through the DPSP cluster.  \n \n3. \nSustained Macroeconomic Performance. The economy of Indonesia ended 2005 with \noverall real GDP growth of 5.6%, the best performance to date since the Asian financial crisis. \nTable 1 presents data on key indicators over 2001\u20132005 that show the continuous recovery and \nrestoration of macroeconomic stability. The economy has grown at a steady and sustained pace \nand investor confidence has risen, supported by the bold decision in October 2005 to increase \nfuel  oil  prices  by  126%.  The  efforts  and  commitment  to  implement  structural  reforms,  and \neffective  coordination  between  the  Government  and  Bank  Indonesia  (BI),  have  significantly \nimproved  market  confidence,  taking  the  rupiah  to  its  strongest  level  in  2  years  and  the  stock \nmarket  to  record  high  levels.  The  rupiah  appreciated  by  about  8%  over  January\u2013September \n2006 to Rp9,100 per $, and the Jakarta Stock Index posted a 24% gain to 1,460 over the same \nperiod. Citing an improved policy environment, Moody\u2019s raised Indonesian bond ratings (foreign \nand domestic) from B2 to B1, followed by an upgrade by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) from B+ to \nBB-  in  July.  However,  Moody\u2019s  rating  is  still  four  levels  from  investment  grade  and  the  S&P \nrating three levels below investment grade. \n \nThe  reduction  in  fuel  subsidies  created  a  large  fiscal  space  of  about  $5  billion  in  2005 \n4. \nand  an  estimated  $10  billion  in  2006,  which  in  turn  has  enabled  a  scaling  up  of  spending  on \nhealth,  education,  and  rural  infrastructure.  Nonetheless,  inflation  accelerated  during  October\u2013\nNovember  2005  to  over  18%  and  stayed  at  around  that  level  until  June  2006  as  fuel  price \nincreases percolated down, and interest rates rose from 8.0% to 12.75% from October 2005 to \nJune 2006. Both have started declining in recent months, with prudent monetary management \nbringing  interest  rates  down  to  10.25%,  and  year-on-year  inflation  to  14.6%  as  at  the  end  of \n\n\fOctober  2006.  Scaling  up  of  spending  combined  with  a  close  watch  on  inflation  has  helped \naccelerate real GDP growth from 4.7% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2006 to 5.2% in the \nsecond quarter. Overall, it is estimated that the economy will grow by about 5.6% in 2006, with \nboth upside and downside risks. Much depends on the outcomes of the Government\u2019s efforts to \naccelerate spending. If they are implemented well, the recently adopted policy reform packages \n(see Government\u2019s development strategy below) could have a major stimulating impact on the \neconomy. \n \n\nTable 1: Indonesia - Key Macroeconomic Indicators \n\nIndicator \n\nReal GDP growth (%) \n\nInflation (%; average of period) \n\nM2 growth (% annual growth) \n\nExternal debt as % of GDP \n\nOverall fiscal balance as % of GDP \n\nCurrent account balance as % of GDP \n\nGross official reserves ($ million) \n\n     in months of imports \n\nDebt service ratio (as % of exports of goods and services) \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n3.8 \n\n11.5 \n\n13 \n\n81.1 \n\n36 \n\n(2.4) \n\n4.2 \n\n28 \n\n5.7 \n\n4.3 \n\n11.9 \n\n4.7 \n\n64.4 \n\n32.1 \n\n(2.1) \n\n3.8 \n\n32 \n\n6.3 \n\n5 \n\n9.8 \n\n8.1 \n\n56.8 \n\n29.8 \n\n(1.7) \n\n3.4 \n\n36.3 \n\n6.8 \n\n4.9 \n\n3.1 \n\n8.1 \n\n53.9 \n\n31.2 \n\n(1.1) \n\n1.2 \n\n36.3 \n\n5.9 \n\n5.6 \n\n10.5 \n\n16.4 \n\n47.4 \n\n38.6 \n\n(0.5) \n\n1.1 \n\n34.7 \n\n4.9 \n\n() = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, M2 = broad money.   \nSource: Ministry of Finance; Central Bureau of Statistics. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \nContinued  Prudence  in  Fiscal  Management.  The  Government  has  continued  its \n5. \nstance  on  fiscal  consolidation,  although  there  are  concerns  over  the  overall  effectiveness  of \npublic  expenditure  orientation,  particularly  with  regard  to  development  spending  and  its \nmanagement. The central government budget deficit stood at 0.5% of GDP at the end of 2005, \nand the public debt-to-GDP ratio improved to 47% (down from 55% in 2004 and 100% in 1999). \nIndonesia\u2019s  debt-to-GDP  ratio  is  now  quite  close  to  the  level  in  Malaysia  (45.7%);  Thailand \n(26.1%) is considerably lower, but the Philippines (72.3%) is much higher. While the declining \ndeficit in 2005 builds on the recent track record of low deficits and a rapidly improving debt-to-\nGDP ratio, it also reflects low spending in early 2005, especially on capital projects.   \n \n6. \nWith the fiscal space generated by the fuel subsidy reduction, the Government should be \nable to scale up public investment from the current level of 5% of GDP to about 7% by 2008\u2014a \nlevel matching the pre-crisis period. The Government and parliament have agreed to increase \nthe  budget  deficit  target  for  2006  from  0.7%  in  the  approved  budget  to  1.1%  to  help  meet: \n(i) expenditures  related  to  the  Yogyakarta  earthquake,  (ii)  additional  expenditures  on  cash \ntransfers  to  the  poor  to  cushion  the  impact  of  the  fuel  price  increases,  and  (iii)  the  higher \nelectricity  subsidy  payments  to  the  State  Electricity  Corporation  (PLN),  necessitated  by  last \nyear\u2019s doubling of fuel prices (para.29 below). The revised 2006 and new 2007 budgets project \ncontinued  higher  revenues  and  expenditures.  The  2007  budget  predicts  a  deficit  of  1.1%  of \nGDP with rising non-oil and gas taxes (from 13.6% to 14.4% of GDP) and continued spending at \n21.6%  of  GDP,  as  the  impact  of  high  oil  prices  continues  to  be  felt.  For  example,  capital \nspending remains at just over 2% of GDP in 2007 (from 1.2% in 2005).  \n \n7. \nIn 2006 and 2007, transfers to the regions also remain high at over 7% of GDP, up from \n5.6% of GDP in 2005. These expenditure increases are the effect of higher oil prices and allow \nthe Government to finance new spending initiatives for the poor in 2006 and 2007\u2014such as the \ncurrent unconditional cash transfer (UCT), the scale up of the community designed development \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nTranslating  Growth \n\ninto  Welfare\u2014Poverty  Profile  and  Prospects \n\n(CDD) program, and the pilot of a conditional cash transfer (CCT) system. In recent months, a \nnumber of local governments have built up temporary reserves in the banking system in 2005\u2013\n2006,  estimated  at  about  Rp70  trillion  (over  $7  billion).  Although  both  spending  needs  and \nregional  disparities  in  terms  of  outcomes  are  significant  in  the  health,  education,  and \ninfrastructure  sectors,  local  governments  need  to  accelerate  the  execution  of  development \nprojects. The CDD program is expected to be accelerated significantly in 2007. \n \n8. \nGiven  Indonesia\u2019s  dependence  on  oil  and  gas  exports,  increased  expenditure  is  not \nexpected  to  impact  fiscal  sustainability  negatively  as  long  as  international  oil  prices  remain \nrelatively  high.  Nonetheless,  the  gross  financing  needs  are  estimated  to  remain  high  over  the \nmedium  term,  reflecting  higher  debt  repayment  needs  in  2006\u20132009  and  the  anticipated \nincrease  in  public  investments.  Domestic  debt  amortization  has  also  increased  as  the \nGovernment  plans  to  implement  debt  buyback  to  smoothen  the  debt  maturity  profile.  At  the \nsame time, the foreign debt repayment burden is likely to be less because the Rupiah exchange \nrate has appreciated. The Government\u2019s strategy is to meet these additional financing needs (i) \nby  issuing  additional  government  bonds  ($3.8  billion);  (ii)  through  additional  privatization \n($0.2 billion); and (iii) through program loans ($1.3 billion), for which the Government has sought \nsupport  from  ADB  ($600  million  in  disbursements),  World  Bank  ($600  million),  and  Japan \n($100 million).  \n \nthe \n9. \nAttainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals.  Indonesia  has  a  good  track  record  in \npoverty  reduction  and  social  development.  The  proportion  of  people  living  below  the  national \npoverty  line  has  declined  consistently  from  about  40%  in  the  mid-1970s  to  just  above  17%  in \n1996.  It  had  a  sharp  spike  during  the  economic  crisis\u2014increasing  to  23.4%  in  1999\u2014before \ndeclining  to  the  pre-crisis  level  of  below  17%  in  2004,  and  further  to  just  under  16%  in  2005. \nHowever,  the  inflationary  impact  of  the  fuel  subsidy  reductions  partly  affected  the  decline,  as \nevident  from  the  March  2006  household  expenditure  survey  which  reflected  that  poverty \nincidence  rose  to  17.75%.  The  magnitude  of  poverty  is  still  high  at  39.5  million  people,  while \nmany  more  are  vulnerable  to  poverty.  The  population  living  below  $1/day  is  8.5%,  while  the \nproportion  of  the  population  living  below  $2/day  is  49.6%,  or  about  10%  higher  than  the \ncomparable  average  for  East  Asia  (including  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China).  There  is  a  very \nlarge group of near-poor in Indonesia who are highly vulnerable to shocks at all levels. \n \n10. \nIndonesia  has  managed  to  achieve  some  progress  on  MDGs.  Health  and  schooling \nindicators have improved over time, as well as in comparison with other regional economies. In \ngeneral, the country is on track to meet most MDG targets.1 However, the country has to catch \nup with other similarly developed countries. For example, while Indonesia is likely to reach the \ngoal of universal primary completion rate by 2015, nine countries in East Asia and Pacific have \nalready  achieved  that  goal,  including  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Mongolia,  Philippines,  and \nViet Nam.2 The only area where the country is currently severely off track is in forestry, where \ntargets on reversing forestry loss will likely not be achieved. While child mortality has declined in \nIndonesia, progress has been slow in general in health. Indonesia currently remains off track in \nachieving  targets  in  measles  immunization  for  infants  under  age  one,  maternal  mortality,  and \nimproving access to improved drinking water. Child malnutrition has seen an overall decrease \nfrom  37.5%  since  1989  to  27.3%  in  2002,  though  progress  from  year  to  year  has  fluctuated. \nOver  the  same  period, severe  malnutrition  has increased  from  6.3%  in  1989  to  8.0%  in  2002. \nThe statistics support the conclusion that Indonesia still has some way to go before reaching the \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006.

Indonesia  has  made  significant  progress  in  improving  governance  since  the  crisis,  but \nparticularly over the last 2 years. Legal reforms on elections and decentralization have resulted \nin greater transparency and political accountability. There is open public debate on a wide range \nof issues, including the Government\u2019s performance, quality of public administration, corruption, \nand  provision  of  government  support  to  the  private  sector.  The  Government\u2019s  openness  and \ncommitment to fighting corruption has been noteworthy. It has established and strengthened a \nrange  of  independent  oversight  and  judicial  institutions  such  as  the  Corruption  Eradication \nCommission,  Anti-Corruption  Court,  Judicial  Commission,  Police  Commission,  and \nProsecutorial Commission. The capacity and role of other independent institutions such as the \nSupreme  Audit  Institution  (BPK),  Financial  Transactions  Analysis  and  Tracking  Center,  and \nAttorney General\u2019s Office\u2014all of which receive or have received significant ADB support\u2014have \nalso  been  strengthened.  The  Government  has  launched  various  high  profile  corruption \ninvestigations, leading to several successful prosecutions. \n \n12. \nNevertheless,  the  approach  taken  to  date  has  been  more  reactive  than  proactive.  The \ninitial  zeal  in  the  prosecution  of  high  profile  cases  has  not  yet  translated  into  a  systematic \napproach for combating corruption. While the President has taken anticorruption seriously, there \nhas  been  no  effective  bridge  to  reduce  the  significant  disconnect  between  the  new  vision  and \nthe old way of doing business in most of the line ministries and other public sector agencies. An \nanticorruption  package  was  adopted  through  Presidential  Instruction  No.  5/2005  in  February \n2005, soon after the new Government took power. With over 100 action plans, the package was \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nmeant  to  institutionalize  preventive  measures  against  corruption.  While  annual  updates  were \nenvisaged, enforcement and coordination have turned out to be complex. The Government has \nrecently begun to take some significant first steps to develop and pilot models for civil service \nreform  targeting  high  level  public  officials  and  specific  ministries  (Ministry  of  Finance  [MOF], \nMinistry of Trade, and Ministry of National Education), though a more comprehensive reform of \nthe bureaucracy has not yet been developed. There have been recent encouraging signs that \nbroader measures are under consideration with the proposed establishment of a team reporting \ndirectly to the President. However, reform of the judicial system has stalled and there has been \nsome  backtracking  as  a  result  of  Supreme  Court  and  Constitutional  Court  decisions  to  curb \nchecks  and  balances  on  judicial  power  through  newly  created  institutions  such  as the  Judicial \nCommission and the Anti-Corruption Court.  \n \nAt decentralized local government levels, the direct election of district heads has brought \n13. \nresources and delivery of public services closer to people. In 2006\u20132007, a large number of the \nover 440 districts will hold local elections. Given strong anti-incumbent sentiment in the majority \nof  locations,  stronger  demand  for  good  governance  is  emerging  across  the  country.  Surveys \nshow  that  there  has  been  no  tangible  improvement  in  service  delivery,  although  it  has  not \ndeteriorated since decentralization. In particular, significant disparities have emerged across the \nregions in key social indicators, and vulnerability to poverty remains a key risk. With central-to-\nlocal  government  transfers  increasing  every  year\u2014supported  by  the  October  2005  decision  to \nreduce  fuel  subsidies\u2014it  is  critical  that  the  regions  become  more  accountable  in  delivering \nadequate and quality public services. \n \n14. \nOther Recent Developments. Indonesia remains vulnerable to natural calamities. Just \nas  the  reconstruction  process  was  beginning  to  gear  up  in  Aceh  and  Nias,  Yogyakarta, \nCentral Java  and  West  Java  faced  another  round  of  devastating  earthquakes  and  a  tsunami. \nThe  loss  of  over  6,000  lives  in  Yogyakarta  and  Central  Java  in  late  May  2006  and  another \n600 lives in West Java in late July has challenged the Government and development partners. \nYet,  the  response  has  been  swift  and  commendable.  The  other  major  challenge  facing \nIndonesia is the spread of avian flu and the continuing risks of bird-to-human transmission, with \n44  human  deaths  as  of  mid-September  2006.  Recently,  after  significant  delays,  there  is  an \nagreement within the Government on a detailed action plan. A program of $250 million per year, \njointly funded by the Government and the international community, is being put in place. A multi-\ndonor Java Reconstruction Fund is in the final stages of establishment to channel contributions \nfrom various donor countries for the rehabilitation and reconstruction process. \n \nB. \n\nProgram Structure and the Government\u2019s Strategy \n\n15. \nThe  DPSP,  structured  as  a  program  cluster,  supports  a  common  development  policy \nagenda  under  the  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL)  series  prepared  by  a  joint  team  of  the \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  (the  Government),  World  Bank,  Government  of  Japan,  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).3 Building on the support through the DPSP (approved in December \n2005), the proposed DPSP-2 will provide parallel cofinancing support to the Government to help \nimplement reforms under the third Development Policy Loan (DPL-3)\u2014the third in a program of \nfour annual, single tranche loans to support high level macroeconomic and crosscutting sector \nreforms to accelerate economic growth. The DPL series aims to help the Government achieve \nits  medium-term  growth  and  poverty  reduction  objectives  through  four  core  policy  areas: \n\n                                                 \n3    As  ADB  did  not  participate  in  DPL-1,  a  different  title\u2014the  DPSP\u2014has  been  adopted  for  ADB\u2019s  operations.  The \n\nequivalence  is  as  follows:  DPL-1  =  ADB\u2019s  participation  through  policy  dialogue;  DPL-2  =  DPSP-1;  DPL-3  =     \nDPSP-2; and DPL-4 = DPSP-3. The proposed program cluster is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \n2006\u20142009 for Indonesia, which supports continued co-financing of the DPLs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) macroeconomic stability and creditworthiness, (ii) improved investment climate, (iii) enhanced \npublic financial management, and (iv) improved service delivery to the poor.  \n \n16. \n\nThe DPL process has the following phases:  \n(i) \n\n($100  million \n\nin  March  2005),  supported \n\nDPL-1,  financed  by  the  World  Bank  ($300  million  in  December  2004)  and  the \nGovernment  of  Japan \nthe \nimplementation  of  reform  measures  outlined  in  the  Government\u2019s  white  paper, \nadopted  in  late  2003,  to  bridge  the  credibility  gap  likely  to  arise  immediately \nfollowing  Indonesia\u2019s  exit  on  1  January  2004  from  the  post-crisis  program \nsupported  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF);  DPL-1  also  supported  the \nimplementation of President Yudhoyono\u2019s 100-Day Plan.4  \nDPL-2,  a  product  of  joint  missions  and  financing  of  ADB  ($200  million  in \nDecember 2005), Government of Japan ($100 million in March 2006), and World \nBank  ($400  million  in  December  2005),  was  activated  upon  satisfactory \ncompliance with the triggers agreed on during 2004. \nDPL-3, the present phase, covering reforms implemented during 2006, and  \nDPL-4,  which  is  included  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s  country  assistance  strategy  and \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  2006\u201420095  (CSP)  as  DPSP-3,  with  the \naim of ensuring continuity of reform measures currently under way. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n \nThe  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJM).  The  Government  aims  to  achieve \n17. \npeace  and  security,  justice  and  democracy,  and  prosperity  for  all.  Within  the  2004\u201309  time \nframe  of  the  RPJM  is  an  ambitious  goal  of  cutting  the  poverty  rate  by  half,  to  8.2%.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  annual  work  plan  (RKP),  approved  each  year  by  the  cabinet,  guides  RPJM \nimplementation. The RKPs set out annual development priorities, including quantitative targets \nand  policy  directions,  which  in  turn  determine  budgetary  allocations.  The  RKP  for  2006  has \nseven  priority  areas:  to  reduce  poverty  and  disparity,  increase  employment,  revitalize \nagriculture, improve access to and quality of education, reduce corruption, strengthen defense \ncapacities,  and  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct  Aceh  and  Nias.  The  linkage  between  the  RKP \npriorities and the four core policy areas of DPSP-2 is in Figure 1. \n \n18. \nThe priorities of the RKP are linked to the state budget and include quantitative targets \nand  policy  direction.  As  an  annual  implementation  document,  the  RKP  has  a  pro-poor  focus \nrelative to the RPJM, reinforcing several of the priorities in the draft national poverty reduction \nstrategy.  The  RKP  is  the  first  time  that  policy  priorities,  albeit  broadly  defined,  have  been  so \nclearly identified in a pro-poor manner, and a conscious attempt is made to use the priorities to \nallocate  resources  among  ministries.  The  2006  budget  builds  on  the  revised  budget  for  2005 \nwhich  placed  a  priority  on  poverty  reduction  objectives,  demonstrated  by  the  reallocation  of \nexpenditures  from  the  highly  regressive  fuel  subsidy  to  health,  education,  rural  infrastructure, \nand  food  support  programs  that  were  expected  to  benefit  the  poor.  This  thrust  is  expected  to \ncontinue  in  the  2007  budget.  For  instance,  the  Government  has  scaled  up  education \ninvestments by 18.5% to Rp51.3 trillion ($5.6 billion). \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB  was  closely  involved  in  implementing  the  White  Paper  and  the  100-Day  Plan,  through:  (i)  programs \nimplemented during 2003\u20132004, including the Financial Governance and Social Security Reform Program, State-\nOwned Governance and Privatization Program, and Industrial Competitiveness and Small and Medium Enterprise \nDevelopment  Program;  and  (ii)  policy  dialogue  to  strengthen  national  and  local  government  public  financial \nmanagement, \nin \nDecember 2004, and the Local Government Finance and Governance Reform SDP, approved in November 2005.  \n\nthe  State  Audit  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  (SDP),  approved \n\nleading \n\nto \n\n5  ADB. 2006.

The Infrastructure Policy Package6 set out a comprehensive \nreform  agenda  covering  a  range  of  crosscutting  issues  relating  to  private  sector  participation, \nrisk  management,  public  service  obligations,  and  the  role  of  different  levels  of  government  in \ninfrastructure provision; and sector planning, legal and regulatory arrangements, tariff policies, \nand infrastructure access. With its scope covering nine infrastructure sectors, the package aims \nto  revive  and  accelerate  infrastructure  investments\u2014particularly  through  greater  public-private \npartnerships. The Investment Climate Policy Package7 supports broad-ranging reforms on tax, \ncustoms,  investment  law,  and  labor.  A  Financial  Sector  Reform  Package  aims  to  strengthen \nbanking  and  nonbanking  sectors,  and  diversify  sources  of  financial  intermediation.  Through \nthese packages, the Government has demonstrated a clear willingness to deal with a number of \n\n                                                 \n6   Adopted  through  a  Decree  of  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  (CMEA)  on  behalf  of  the  National \n\nCommittee for the Acceleration of Infrastructure Provision on 17 February 2006. \n\n7  Adopted through Presidential Instruction No. 3/2006 on 27 February 2006. \n\n \n\n \n\n7\n\nN\na\nt\ni\no\nn\na\n\nl\n \n\n \n\nP\no\nv\ne\nr\nt\ny\nR\ne\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\nS\n\n \n\nt\nr\na\nt\ne\ng\ny\n \ni\nn\n \nD\nr\na\nf\nt\n \n\nF\no\nr\nm\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fcomplex, and in some cases politically sensitive, issues that have been on hold for some time. \nFinally, a small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) reform package is under preparation. \n \n20. \nThe  RPJM-DPSPs\u2014the  Government  and  Development  Partner  Coordination. \nSupport  for  the  RPJM  through  parallel  cofinancing  of  the  DPL  series  is  a  key  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s \nCSP for 2006\u20132010. Under the CSP, a dual-track approach is adopted to ensure that high level \nmacroeconomic and governance reforms supported under the DPL are reinforced at the sector \nlevel.  Figure  2  presents  the  approach,  which  involves  structuring  of  ADB\u2019s  support  through \n(i) participation in the DPLs to strengthen the macroeconomic and fiscal framework and address \ncrosscutting concerns; and (ii) sector-specific policy interventions in the areas of infrastructure, \nfinancial  deepening,  local  government  finance  and  public  financial  management,  and  poverty \nreduction  and  accelerating  progress  towards  the  MDGs.  ADB\u2019s  dual-track  approach  aims  to \nalign  and  harmonize  development  partner  strategies  with  Indonesia\u2019s  country  strategy  and \npriorities.  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  DPL  process  and  the  parallel  policy  dialogue  on  sector \nreforms has been appreciated by the Government.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nImportant Features \n\n21. \nThe  impact  of  DPSP-2  will  be  in  the  form  of  higher  economic  growth  that  is  sustained \nover  the  medium  term,  and  lower  levels  of  poverty  and  unemployment.  Its  principal  outcomes \ninclude:  (i)  improved  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  better  investment  climate,  (iii)  good \ngovernance in public administration, and (iv) improved delivery of public services.  \n \nThe design and monitoring framework of the DPSP cluster is in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 \n22. \npresents  the  background  to  the  DPSP-2  triggers,  along  with  a  summary  assessment  of  the \noutcomes of actions supported under DPSP-1. The development policy letter, the policy matrix \nfor  DPSP-2,  and  triggers  for  the  forward-looking  program  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  summary \nmacroeconomic  assessment  of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  which  has  been \nprepared to underpin program lending operations by ADB and the World Bank, is in Appendix 4. \nAppendix 5 presents the development partner coordination matrix, outlining support from ADB \nand other development partners in areas related to the DPSP cluster. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe  DPSP  cluster  has  several  innovative  features.  First,  it  is  fully  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda. This promotes full ownership and participation, as demonstrated \nby the Government\u2019s willingness to offer fairly complex reform areas such as tax administration, \nanticorruption, and civil service reform for inclusion in the DPSP agenda. Second, designed as a \nprogram  cluster,  it  provides  for  continuity  of  engagement  by  the  development  partners  in  a \nseamless manner over the medium term. As it does not have the rigidity built into the traditional \nconditionality-driven  multiple  tranche  programs,  the  program  structure  promotes  greater \nparticipation  of  civil  servants  at  all  levels.  Third,  it  aims  to  reduce  transaction  costs  to  the \nGovernment  as  well  as  the  development  partners,  through  greater  harmonization  among  the \nlatter. The close coordination has significantly helped in increasing the efficiency and benefits of \nsupport  from  the  respective  institutions,  particularly  with  regard  to  technical  assistance  (TA). \nFourth,  governance  is  a  recurring  theme  throughout  the  DPSP  cluster,  as  it  aims  to  promote \ntransparency in all its core policy areas. Thus, good governance is both an input as well as an \noutcome in the DPSP cluster. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nFigure 2: Support for the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan \n\nStrategic Framework: Medium Term Development Plan (RPJM)\n \nOutcomes:  \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nRevive economic growth to achieve 7% average annual real GDP growth by 2009  \nHalve poverty from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% by 2009 \nReduce unemployment by 2009 from the current levels above 10% \nPromote good governance through combating corruption \nEnsure peace, safety, security, justice, and democracy for all Indonesians \n\nDPL Series (Coordinated by \nthe World Bank) \n\n \n\n(cid:190)  High level macroeconomic \nand cross-sector reforms \n(cid:190)  2\u20133 strategic triggers per  \ncore policy area (CPA) \n(cid:190)  Annual program lending \n\nsupport \n\nClose seamless \ncoordination \nmoving from \nmacroeconomic \nto sector \nreforms, \nreinforced by \ncofinancing \nwhere possible \n\nSector Programs under the New \nCSP (Coordinated by ADB) \n\n \n\n(cid:190)  Deeper sector-specific \n\nimplementation support for policy, \ninstitutional, regulatory reforms  \n\n(cid:190)  Each program designed as a \ncluster, with subprograms \nsequenced over 18\u201324 months  \n\nCPA \nStability and Creditworthiness \n\nMacroeconomic \n\n1: \n\n\u2022  Effective fiscal policy \n\u2022  Macro-level support for \n\ndecentralization \n\u2022  Fiscal-monetary \ncoordination \n\n\u2022  Debt management \n\nCPA 2: Improving Investment \nClimate \n\n\u2022  Legal framework \n\u2022  Financial stability \n\u2022  Macro-level support \n\n(e.g., fiscal incentives, \nrisk sharing) \n\nCPA 3: Improving Public \nFinancial Management \n\n\u2022  Transparency and good \n\n\u2022 \n\ngovernance \nInstitutional measures (e.g., \nTreasury Single Account) \n\nCPA 4: Improving Public \nService Delivery \n\n\u2022  Establishing and \n\ninstitutionalizing national-\nlevel program evaluation \n\n\u2022  Targeted cross-sector \n\nreform \n\nSource: ADB staff. \n\n \n\nInfrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \n(IRSDP) Cluster \n\u2022  Comprehensive sector and cross-sector reforms as \n\noutlined in the IRSDP Program Cluster over 2005\u201310 \n\n\u2022  Establishment of project development facility \n\u2022  Supporting infrastructure project transactions \n\nFinancial Governance and Social Security Reform \nProgram Cluster \n\u2022  Strengthening oversight and institutional governance \n\u2022  Promoting regulatory harmonization \n\u2022  Product diversification, long-term financing modalities, \n\nand deepening of bond markets \n\nLocal Government Finance and Governance Reform \n(LGFGR) Program Cluster and the State Audit Reform \n(STAR) Program \n\u2022  Ex-ante planning and budget reforms through LGFGR \n\u2022  Streamlining fiscal decentralization \n\u2022  Local government level civil service reforms \n\u2022 \n\nImproving public financial management (ex-ante aspects \nthrough LGFGR and internal control and audits through \nSTAR Program) \n\nPoverty Reduction and MDG Acceleration Program \nCluster \n\u2022 \n\nImproving delivery of health, education, and other \ncommunity services in MDG-deficit areas, in a \nprogrammatic manner \n\n\u2022  Enhancing accountability for service delivery at local \n\ngovernment and institutional levels, reinforced by well-\ndefined standards that are based on clear costing  \n\u2022  Facilitating transition toward greater performance \n\norientation \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPolicy Framework and Actions8 \n\nC. \n \nThe  DPSP-1  program  document  laid  out  16  indicative  triggers/actions  for  DPSP-2.9  In \n24. \nthe  process  of  assessment  of  implementation  progress  of  these  actions,  the  Government \nproposed a few key changes: \n \n\n(i)  Replace  the  action  on  drafting  a  Trade  Law  with  that  of  the  Warehouse  Receipts \nLaw (no. 5 in the policy matrix presented in Appendix 3, Table A3.1): At the time of \nDPSP-1 negotiations in November 2005, it was expected that the trade bill would \nhelp  to  ensure  the  free  movement  of  goods  within  the  country  and  a  competitive \ntrade  regime.  An  initial  assessment  of  the  draft  law  pointed  to  considerable  work \nstill needed to bring the provisions in line with the original objectives as envisioned \nlast  year  by  the  Ministry  of  Trade.  Moreover,  changes  to  the  cabinet\u2019s  economic \nteam brought forth several new initiatives and a policy package in the investment \nclimate\u2014none of which identified the trade law as a priority for 2006. At the request \nof the Government, it is proposed that this trigger be dropped10 and replaced with \nthe  adoption  of  the  Warehouse  Receipts  Law  (Table  A3.1,  no.  5)\u2014important \nlegislation which will help the development of SMEs and facilitate domestic trade. \n\n(ii)  Consolidate two triggers on nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) into one trigger \n\n(iii)  Consolidate two triggers on government financial accounting and reporting into one \n\n(Table A3.1, no. 7). \n\ntrigger (Table A3.1, no. 11). \n\n(iv)  Add  three  new  triggers  on  tax  administration  reform  (Table  A3.1,  no.  13), \ngovernance (Table A3.1, no. 14), and civil service reform (Table A3.1, no. 15). \n\n    \n\nIn total, the Government and development partners have focused on 16 policy actions as \n25. \nidentified in Table A3.1 in Appendix 3.11 Most of these triggers contained multiple measures as \na means of clearly outlining a blueprint for government counterparts to follow and execute at the \ntechnical level, while a few measures had definitive outputs (e.g., establishment of an office or \nbody).  The  16  policy  actions  comprise  39  specific  measures.  The  Government  has  made \nsubstantial  progress  toward  completing  these  measures:  28  have  been  fully  completed,  while \ncontinuous progress has been underway in the remaining 11 measures, which the Government \nis committed to fulfilling during 2007.  \n \n26. \nIn  the  spirit  of  the  DPL  series,  which  aims  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reform \nagenda  on  a  continuous  basis  rather  than  through  pre-determined  rigid  conditionalities,  the \nGovernment has requested that recognition be given to the substantial progress that has been \nmade.  Furthermore,  as  the  individual  loans  under  the  DPL  series  are  sequenced  to  provide \ncontinuous support in a predictable manner, it has requested the development partners to stay \nfully engaged as part of the ongoing policy dialogue, and support and continuously monitor the \nimplementation and completion of the 10 measures. ADB\u2019s program cluster approach provides \nfor  such  flexibility  in  reform  programs  that  are  implemented  over  a  period  of  time,  by  taking \n\n                                                 \n8  This  section  should  be  read  along  with  the  background  information  presented  in  Appendix  2  on  the  DPSP-2   \ntriggers. Appendix 2 also presents an assessment of the status of reforms supported under the DPL series and the \noutcomes to date. \n\n9  Appendix 2, Table A2.2 of ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Development Policy Support Program. Manila (November). \n10 The Government has requested that the Trade Law may be picked up in a subsequent operation in the near future. \nThe  World  Bank  and  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  among  others,  provide \ntechnical assistance in a number of related areas. \n\n11  The  DPL-3  document  of  the  World  Bank  includes  an  additional  trigger  on  risk  management  in  the  infrastructure \nsectors.  This  trigger  is  not  included  in  DPSP-2  since  it  is  covered  in  a  more  extensive  manner  in  the  ADB \nsupported IRSDP. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nemerging circumstances into account. The triggers identified for DPSP-3 (DPL-4), presented in \nAppendix  3,  Table  A3.2,  include  measures  to  ensure  policy  continuity  as  well  as  close \nengagement  between  the  Government  and  development  partners  in  the  implementation  of \nthese ongoing measures. \n \n\n1. \n\nCore Policy Area I: Supporting Macroeconomic Stability and \nCreditworthiness \n\n27. \nGeneral  Progress  and  Constraints  under  Core  Policy  Area  I.  As  outlined  earlier \n(paras.2-6), Indonesia has been quite successful in restoring and reestablishing macroeconomic \nstability  since  the  Asian  financial  crisis.  In  particular,  successive  administrations  have  focused \non  fiscal  consolidation  and  monetary  stability,  and  paved  the  way  for  some  key  structural \nreforms.  The  first  phase  of  the  DPL  supported  the  adoption  and  implementation  of  the  white \npaper  reforms,  with  ADB  engagement  through  several  parallel  operations  (footnote  3). \nSubsequently,  the  hallmark  of  macroeconomic  management  during  DPSP-1  was  the  bold \ndecision  to  increase  domestic  fuel  prices,  reflecting  strong  government  commitment  despite \nshort-term pain. As a result of the adjustments, there was an additional fiscal space of $5 billion \nin  2005  and  approximately  $10  billion  in  2006.  This  could  enable  one  of  the  largest  public \nexpenditure reorientations in recent history in any country toward higher priority social areas. \n \n28. \nAt  a  broader  level,  many  indicators  have  improved  in  recent  years.  Most  noteworthy \nhave  been  improvements  in  market  perception,  demonstrated  through  (i)  upgrading  of \ninternational credit ratings; (ii) the significant decline in public debt-to-GDP ratio by almost 20% \nfrom about 64% in 2003 to 45% in mid-2006; and (iii) the significant shift in revenue sources, as \ndomestic non-oil and gas revenues are projected to comprise about 13.6% in 2006, from 10.4% \nin 2003. These underlie the stable recovery of Indonesia\u2019s economy toward one of the highest \ngrowth rates among similarly sized economies in the region. As a result of these outcomes, the \nGovernment and the development partners have agreed that the next phase of DPSP (DPSP-3 \nand DPL-4) will continue the policy dialogue on macroeconomic stability but with the intention of \neliminating  the  separate  pillar  focused  on  these  issues.  This  decision  testifies  to  the  general \nconfidence in the Government\u2019s commitment to sound macroeconomic management, based on \na convincing track record.   \n \nDespite these positive outcomes, the Government needs to address a number of other \n29. \nissues.  One  such  impediment  is  the  subsidy  policy  in  the  power  sector.  While  the  fuel  price \nhikes of March and October 2005 significantly reduced a major distortion in the economy, retail \nprices for gasoline and kerosene remain at 70% and 30% of international prices, respectively. \nSince  the  energy  mix  tilted  predominantly  towards  oil,  particularly  in  electricity  generation,  the \ncosts of electricity generation have shot up in Indonesia. As a result, increasing fuel prices have \nled to a significant rise in subsidies required by PLN. Subsidy needs in 2006 are estimated at \nRp37 trillion ($3.8 billion) or more than double the level in 2005. With regard to tariff policies in \ngeneral,  there  is  lack  of  coordination  within  the  Government,  leading  to  a  disconnect  between \ndevelopment  priorities  and  tariff  setting.  The  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development \nProgram  (IRSDP)12  supported  by  ADB  will  provide  significant  support  to  achieve  full  cost \nrecovery in all infrastructure sectors. The Government faces considerable challenges in the area \nof decentralization. Fiscal transfer mechanisms need to be streamlined. Regional tax reforms to \nincrease fiscal autonomy have to be accelerated.     \n \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nRepublic of Indonesia for the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program. Manila (November). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTriggers  under  Core  Policy  Area  I.  The  Government  has  progressed  in  fulfilling  the \n30. \nthree triggers in this policy area, which build on and deepen reforms undertaken in the previous \nphases  relating  to  tax  and  fiscal  policy,  debt  management,  and  decentralization.  Beyond  the \nspecific triggers, the Government has also made progress across a broad range of policy and \ninstitutional measures in these areas. \n \n\na. \n\nImproving Fiscal Policy \n\n31. \nKey Issues. The overriding objective of the Government\u2019s fiscal reform efforts has been \nto  enhance  the  amount  and  predictability  of  tax  revenues  through  improved  compliance  and \nbroadening the tax base, while reducing tax rates to improve investment sentiment. In the past \nseveral years, the Government has  increased taxpayer registration and filing of tax returns by \nnew  and  existing  taxpayers,  and  has  improved  recovery  of  tax  arrears  and  expanded  audit \ncoverage.  In  December  2004,  electronic  registration  of  taxpayers  was  introduced,  as  was \nelectronic  filing  in  January  2005.  Earlier  support  through  the  DPL  has  facilitated  the \nmodernization of tax offices, including upgrading facilities and information technology systems, \nstaff  reorganization  by  function,  increased  remuneration,  and  the  institution  of  taxpayer  bill  of \nrights and tax official code of conduct. The extension of modern tax offices continued in 2006, \nwith a major expansion to medium sized tax offices in Indonesia, and through the beginning of a \nreorganization of the central tax office to support the longer-term tax reform agenda (core policy \narea 3). \n \n32. \nHowever,  many  problems  remain  despite  progress  in  extending  the  modern  tax  office \nsystem.  The  tax  system  is  still  characterized  by  relatively  low  revenue  generation,  poorly \ndefined and overly complicated taxes (i.e., creating excessive compliance costs), and poor and \ninconsistent  enforcement  (i.e.,  creating  uncertainty  and  abuse).  The  problem  requires  better \noversight of tax officials, and partly stems from a systematic lack of information and capacity for \ntax  and  customs  analysis  outside  tax  and  customs  offices.  The  lack  of  capacity  has  led  to  an \ninability  to  accurately  assess  and  forecast  the  implications  of  proposed  tax  and  customs \nchanges; reduced checks and balances; and an imbalance between taxpayer and government \nrequirements.  \n \n33. \nAccomplishments  under  DPSP-2.  The  first  round  of  MOF  reorganization  was \nsupported  through  DPSP,  in  line  with  the  approach  adopted  in  the  State  Finance,  State \nTreasury, and State Audit laws adopted in 2003\u20132004 to separate all non-fiscal responsibilities. \nWithin  the  broader  context  of  the  DPSP-2  policy  dialogue,  the  minister  of  finance  proposed  a \nsecond phase of MOF institutional reorganization to be implemented over 2006\u20132007. This was \ndone through the adoption of a revised and strengthened 5-year strategic plan for MOF (MOF \nDecree No. 84/2006, issued on 14 February 2006). The strategy aims to improve the quality of \noverall \nliabilities;  and \nintergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  among  others.  To  help  implement  the  strategic  plan \neffectively,  the  Government  adopted  Presidential  Regulation  No.  66/2006  on  8  June  2006,  on \nthe  reorganization  of  MOF.  As  part  of  this,  MOF  has  established  a  Fiscal  Policy  Office  (BKF), \nwhich  replaces  the  Agency  for  Economic  and  Financial  Sector  Research  and  International \nCooperation, with the aim of separating fiscal policy formulation and implementation within MOF \nto address the weaknesses described above. The reorganization also entails the creation of two \nnew  directorate  generals  (DGs)  to  consolidate  all  functions  related  to  debt  management  and \nregional fiscal balance. \n \nOn 1 November 2006, an echelon 1 (the highest level within the civil service) official was \n34. \nappointed to head BKF, supported through a presidential decree. Officials at subsequent levels \nhave  been  appointed  through  an  MOF  decree.  ADB,  Australian  Agency  for  International \n\nrisks,  and  contingent \n\nfiscal  management, \n\nincluding  debt, \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nDevelopment (AusAID), and World Bank will support BKF in a range of areas. The World Bank\u2019s \nGovernment Financial Management and Revenue Administration Project (GFMRAP) will focus \non strengthening institutional arrangements. AusAID supports tax policy reforms. ADB\u2019s ongoing \nsupport  focuses  on  strengthening  risk  management  in  infrastructure,  a  key  function  of  BKF, \nthrough  a  new  risk  management  unit.  The  Government  has  also  begun  the  process  of \ninstitutionalizing  the  transfer  of  tax,  sectoral,  and  other  data  to  BKF  to  improve  forecasting \naccuracy, which will report the data on a monthly basis to the cabinet economics team. \n \nExpected  Impact.  The  fulfillment  of  trigger  1  entails  improved  overall  fiscal  policy  as \n35. \ndemonstrated  through  good  quality  analytical  assessments,  better  coordination,  and  timely \naccess to key information. Given the Government\u2019s current focus on accelerating development, \nBKF  will  undertake  wide-ranging  assessments  to  guide  policy.  Its  initial  focus  will  be  on  taxes \nand trade policy. Streamlining fiscal transfers will receive priority attention in light of concerns on \nequity and efficiency in their distribution, and the relatively low levels of accountability from local \ngovernments to their own citizens and the national Government in fulfilling key priorities such as \ninvestment climate improvement, poverty reduction, and acceleration of MDGs. \n  \n\nb. \n\nImprove Debt Management \n\n36. \nAccomplishments.  The  Government  adopted  a  debt  management  strategy  under \nDPSP-1. To help implement the strategy effectively, a new DG for Public Debt Management has \nbeen  established  in  MOF  by  consolidating  the  current  bifurcated  functions  dealing  with  the \nissuance and management of government securities and external funds.13 An echelon 1 official \nhas  been  appointed  as  the  director  general.  The  new  DG  will  be  structured  along  functional \nlines\u2014front,  middle,  and  back  office\u2014to  facilitate  effective  debt  and  risk  management.  A  key \naspect  of  the  debt  management  strategy  is  to  deepen  the  understanding  of  relative  costs  and \nrisks of financing through various modalities, such as market and other sources. In addition, a \nsound assessment of the civil service pension liabilities needs to be undertaken on a continuous \nbasis. ADB has provided support in 2004 to undertake financial audits of key institutions dealing \nwith  government  and  private  sector  pensions.  Building  on  the  past  assessments,  the \nGovernment  has  recently  signed  a  grant  agreement  from  the  Financial  Sector  Reform  and \nStrengthening Initiative Trust fund which will provide capacity building support. \n \nExpected Impact. Fulfillment of trigger 2 will entail continuous improvements to the debt \n37. \nmanagement strategy, including streamlined issuance of public debt and increased attention on \ncivil  service  pensions.  Transparency  will  be  enhanced \nthe  publication  of  a \ncomprehensive  annual  report  on  debt  and  risks,  and  the  launching  of  a  website  containing \nrelevant  information  for  investors  and  the  public.  The  impact  will  be  in  the  form  of  gradual \nreduction in public debt in proportion to GDP toward the Government\u2019s target of 30% by 2010. \nThe Government is set to achieve this target, as the forecast ratio for the end of 2006 is about \n38%.  Equally  important,  the  consolidation  of  debt  management  functions  will  help  Indonesia \noptimize  its  sources  of  development  financing  in  line  with  interest  rate  movements  and  other \nterms and conditions, including costs and benefits. \n \n\nthrough \n\nc. \n\nImprove Decentralization Framework \n\n38. \nAccomplishments.  Following  the  adoption  of  the  new  Planning  Law  in  2004,  the \nGovernment began to integrate the planning and budgeting process. An essential part of this is \nto  strengthen  the  system  in  place  for  development  financing.  The  National  Development \nPlanning  Agency  (BAPPENAS)  has  adopted  a  new  decree  (Decree  No.  5/2006)  setting  out  a \nnew  system  comprising  an  annual  and  a  5-year  rolling  catalogue  of  development  assistance \n                                                 \n13 Directorate of Government Securities Management and the Directorate for External Funds. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n(the  blue  book)  process.  One  improvement  is  the  requirement  on  line  ministries  to  set  aside \ncounterpart  funds  in  their  annual  budgets,  to  ensure  their  readiness  to  receive  and  effectively \nabsorb  official  development  assistance.  In  addition,  the  minister  of  finance  has  signed  the  on-\ngranting  (MOF  Decree  No.  52/2006)  and  onlending  (MOF  Decree  No.  53/2006)  decrees.  The \nnew  decrees  will  strengthen  the  channeling  of  development  assistance  to  the  regions.  In \nparallel, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is supporting MOF in \ndrafting the ministerial decree on the issuance of regional bonds. The Capital Markets and Non-\nBank Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency (BAPEPAM-LK) has begun work on the related \ntechnical  and  implementation  guidelines.  With  regard  to  local  government  debt  workout14, \ntechnical  guidelines  have  been  prepared  by  DG  Treasury  for  restructuring  and  rescheduling \nPDAMs as well as local government loans. \n \nExpected  Impact.  The  adoption  of  the  blue  book  and  on-granting  decrees  will  help \n39. \nstreamline  and  accelerate  development  assistance  to  the  poorer  regions  or  through  nationally \nimplemented projects. However, onlending arrangements are likely to go through some further \ndifficult  changes  and  tightening  of  conditions,  as  the  Government  has  not  been  successful  in \nrestructuring  local  government  arrears.  In  the  meantime,  the  issuance  of  subnational  debt  or \nsupport  through  market-based  means  of  raising  resources  for  development  needs  to  be \nfacilitated.  The  measures  will  help  enhance  the  creditworthiness  of  subnational  government \nborrowers;  increase  access  to  finance  in  the  form  of  bonds,  loans,  and  grants  for  subnational \ndevelopment; and stimulate public service delivery and regional growth.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCore Policy Area II: Improved Investment Climate \n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n25\n\nKorea\n\nII: \n\nMalaysia\n\nThailand\n\n% of GDP\n45\n\nFigure 3.

Lost  investments  have \ntranslated into slower growth, and in turn slow \nprogress in poverty reduction and job creation. \nSuch  low  levels  of  investment  have  impeded \nIndonesia  from  competing  effectively  with  the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Viet Nam, \nwhich  have  enjoyed  high  investment  ratios  of \n45% and 32% of GDP, respectively (Figure 3). \nThe  most  critical  challenge  facing  Indonesia \ntoday \ninvestment \nclimate.  Weaknesses  in  this  regard  were \nclearly  identified  at  the  outset  of  the  current \nadministration  in  the  RPJM.  The  Indonesian  National  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry \nprovided  a  road  map  for  improving  the  business  environment,  and  the  Government  and \ndevelopment  partners  have  outlined  five  high  priority  policy  areas:  (i)  taxation,  (ii)  customs \nclearance  and  tariff  system,  (iii)  labor  regulation,  (iv)  infrastructure,  and  (v) investment  policy \nand SME promotion. \n \n41. \nAlthough  businesses  continue  to  face  significant  constraints,  there  has  been  steady \nprogress.  The  investment  ratio  has  increased  since  2003,  from  19%  of  GDP  to  22%  in  2005, \nand a projected 23% for 2006.

Overall investment (foreign and domestic) rose \nstrongly during the first half of 2005, by 15% over the previous year, and outpacing consumption \nas  the  main  contributor  to  economic  growth.  While  the  October  2005  macroeconomic  shocks \nreversed  some  of  those  gains,  the  return  to  macroeconomic  stability  suggests  improved \nprospects in the medium term. Business confidence has strengthened over the past few years, \nwith  the  rupiah  among  the  top  six  best-performing  currencies  tracked by  Bloomberg  this  year, \nand  the  equity  markets  one  of  the  best  performers  in  the  region  in  2004  and  2005.

Investment \nclimate  surveys  conducted  in  2003 \nand  December  2005  indicate  that \nconstraints  to  businesses  are  less \nsevere  than  2  years  ago  (Figure  4). \nHowever,  the  rankings  of  obstacles \nchanged  very  little.  Macroeconomic \ninstability,  policy  uncertainty,  and \ncorruption  were \nthe \nbiggest  obstacles  in  both  periods. \nThe  next  biggest  constraints  were \nlegal  system, \nthe \nweaknesses \ntransportation, \ntax \nlabor \nadministration,  cost  of  financing,  and \n(December  2005 \nlabor \nsurvey). To address these issues, the \nGovernment  undertook  a  good  deal \nfor \nof  planning  and  preparation \ninvestment  climate  reforms  in  2005,  with  the  most  significant  investment-related  initiatives \nembodied  in  three  new  draft  laws  on  tax,  customs,  and  investment.  Following  the  cabinet \nreshuffle in December 2005, a comprehensive investment climate policy package was issued in \nMarch  2006  through  Presidential  Instruction  No.  3/2006.  The  package  has  time-bound  targets \nand assigns a minister to be responsible for each target. It is divided into five categories, along \nthe  lines  of  what  was  presented  by  the  development  partners  in  2005:  (i) general  investment \npolicies,  (ii)  customs,  (iii)  tax,  (iv)  labor  policy,  and  (v)  SME  policy.  The  Government  needs  to \nshow  concrete  progress  in  implementation,  given  the  general  skepticism  expressed  by  the \nbusiness community with regard to effective enforcement of well-intentioned policies, plans, and \nregulations. \n \n43. \nRecognizing the importance of implementation, the Government established an internal \nmonitoring team to provide monthly progress reports for the policy package. In May 2006, the \nteam  noted  that,  out  of  26  items  scheduled  for  completion  by  the  end  of  April,  23  had  been \ncompleted and 3 were in the process of finalization. Among important  measures completed in \nMarch and April were: (i) submission of the draft investment law to parliament; (ii) revitalization \nof the national export and investment team; (iii) simplification of eight business licenses under \nthe minister of trade, including the important Trade Business License; (iv) delegation of authority \nto  legalize  limited  liability  companies  to  provincial  offices  of  the  Ministry  of  Justice; \n\nSource: ADB for 2003 survey; World Bank for 2005/06 surveys \n\nregulation \n\nskills, \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n\fto \n\nlocal \n\nteam \n\nreview  nonbusiness-friendly \n\nregulations;  and \n(v) establishment  of  a \n(vi) simplification of procedures for granting visas and residence permits to foreign investors and \nexpatriate employees. \n \nLabor  reform  is  one  of  the  most  sensitive  areas  critical  to  improving  the  investment \n44. \nclimate. Revisions to Labor Law 13/2003 were proposed for April 2006 as part of the investment \npolicy  package.  However,  following  a  strong  negative  reaction  from  organized  labor,  the  April \ntarget could not be met. This represented a setback for investors as the 2003 law significantly \nraised hiring costs. For example, severance pay rates are now far higher than in other regional \neconomies,  discouraging  employers  from  hiring  new  workers  on  a  permanent  basis.  The \nproposed  changes  would  have  addressed  this  bias  against  employers  and  brought  labor \nregulations  into  line  with  neighboring  countries  such  as  Thailand  and  Malaysia.  The \nGovernment  seems  to  have  indicated  a  reluctance  to  push  through  such  a  politically  charged \nreform  measure,  instead  stating  the  need  to  improve  relations  between  employees  and \nindustry\u2014and only if absolutely needed would amend the labor law. \n \nThe  Government  adopted  a  policy  package  on  infrastructure  in  February  2006.  ADB, \n45. \nworking closely with the National Committee on the Acceleration of Infrastructure Development \nand other development partners, is leading implementation support for the package through the \nproposed IRSDP, which sets out a medium-term agenda of policy and regulatory reforms aimed \nat  accelerating  infrastructure  investments,  a  key  ingredient  of  sound  investment  climate.  The \nWorld  Bank  and  Government  of  Japan  are  considering  cofinancing  the  IRSDP,  at  the \nGovernment\u2019s request. \n \n46. \nTriggers  under  Core  Policy  Area  II.  The  DPSP  cluster  supports  high  level  reform \nmeasures  involving  the  legal,  institutional,  and  regulatory  framework;  customs  and  taxes; \ninfrastructure  development;  SME  promotion;  financial  sector  development;  and  trade.  Moving \nforward,  the  investment  climate,  infrastructure,  finance,  and  SME  policy  packages  should \nprovide a strong foundation for continuity of policy reforms.   \n \n\nd. \n\nClarify the Legal Status of Regional Government Enterprises \n\n47. \nAccomplishments. There has been no coherent legal framework governing the regional \ngovernment-owned enterprises (BUMDs), and the law on national state-owned enterprises does \nnot  focus  on  BUMDs.  The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  has  now  coordinated  the  finalization  of  a \nnew  draft  Law  on  Regional  Government  Owned  Enterprises,  which  aims  to  rationalize  public \nand  private  participation  in  the  BUMD  sector.  The  new  law  will  distinguish  between  those \nBUMDs  which  should  be  fully  owned  by  their  respective  subnational  governments,  and  those \nwhose  ownership  may  be  split  between  public  and  private  entities.  The  latter  type  of  BUMDs \nwould be prime targets for full privatization in the future. The new law is also expected to define \nmore  clearly  the  fiscal  and  financial  relationships  between  BUMDs  and  their  subnational \ngovernments,  regulate  BUMD  borrowing,  and  make  provisions  for  BUMD  bankruptcy.  The \nsubmission  of  the  draft  law  by  the  President  to  parliament  (trigger  4)  is  expected  in  early \nDecember 2006; the Government has agreed to follow through closely. \n \nExpected  Impact.  Enactment  of  the  law  on  BUMD  will  facilitate  greater  private  sector \n48. \nparticipation  in  certain  key  sectors,  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation.  By  laying  out  a \nframework  for  restructuring  BUMDs,  it  will  also  help  improve  the  quality  of  public  service \ndelivery,  particularly  in  the  provision  of  regional  infrastructure  services,  through  improved \nmanagement and restructuring. \n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\ne. \n\nAdopt a Legal Framework for Warehouse Receipts to Support \nFinancial Intermediation \n\n \n49. \nAccomplishments.  In  June  2006,  Parliament  enacted  the  Warehouse  Receipt  Law \n(trigger 5) to establish a system of designated warehouses which could provide official centrally \nregistered  receipts  for  commodities  stored  by  farmers,  growers,  and  traders.  This  means  that \nSMEs in agribusiness and related sectors would have flexibility in selling their products based \non  market  conditions.  The  designated  warehouses  will  provide  them  with  certificates  against \ngoods held. The receipts can be traded as derivatives, used to settle maturing futures contracts \non a commodities exchange, or as collateral to obtain bank loans. \n \n50. \nExpected  Impact.  Enactment  of  the  Warehouse  Receipts  Law  will  help  expand \nfinancing  opportunities  for  SMEs,  as  the  lack  of  uncollateralized  lending  has  been  a  major \nimpediment to financial intermediation. The Ministry of Industry will disseminate information on \nthe scheme and draw up technical guidelines to implement the approved legislation. \n \n\nf. \n\nContinue Implementation of the Financial Sector Safety Net \n\n51. \nAccomplishments.  Introduction  of  the  deposit  insurance system  was  supported under \nthe  first  two  phases  of  the  DPL.  Its  implementation  is  proceeding  according  to  schedule \n(trigger 6).  As  announced,  on  22  March  2006  the  coverage  was  reduced  to  Rp5  billion.  It  is \nexpected that it will be further reduced to Rp1 billion from 22 September 2006. The last step will \nbe a reduction to Rp100 million, starting from 22 March 2007. In line with the implementation of \nthe deposit insurance scheme, on 28 December 2005, the minister of finance, BI governor, and \nthe  chair  of  the  Deposit  Insurance  Company  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to \nestablish  the  Financial  Stability  Forum,  which  will  formulate  policies  to  prevent  and  resolve \nsystemic financial crises. \n \n52. \nEstablishment  of  an  Emergency  Financing  Facility  (EFF).  Following  the  agreement \nto  establish  the  Financial  Stability  Forum,  BI  has  adopted  a  regulation  (No. 8/1/PBI/2006) \nestablishing an EFF. The EFF will be available for large and systemic banking institutions which: \n(i) experience a liquidity crunch, (ii) have a capital adequacy ratio of at least 5%, and (iii) could \nguarantee the liquidity support from EFF with adequate collateral. The regulation clearly sets out \nthe  division  of  responsibilities  between  the  governor  of  BI  and  the  minister  of  finance  in \nimplementing  the  EFF,  besides  defining  the  criteria  for  determining  the  timing  of  such \nemergency support. The funds for the EFF will come from the state budget, in conformity with \nthe provisions of the State Finance Law (Law 17/2003).   \n \nAdoption  of  Good  Corporate  Governance  (GCG).  In  continuation  of  the  banking \n53. \nsector  measures  adopted  under  the  first  DPSP,15  BI  has  adopted  a  regulation  (No. \n8/4/PBI/2006)  on  implementation  of  GCG  practices  in  commercial  banks.  Adopted  within  the \nbroader framework of the Indonesian Banking Architecture plan of BI, which aims to consolidate \nand strengthen the banking sector by 2010, the regulation sets out a clear framework on GCG \nin  banks.  Box  1  presents  the  key  features  of  the  regulatory  framework.  Indonesia\u2019s  banking \nsector  has  suffered  from  serious  corporate  governance  violations  in  the  past.  While \nimprovements have been made in the last 3\u20134 years, enforcement of GCG has not been even \nor  effective.  For  instance,  the  fit  and  proper  test  requirements  have  not  always  been  followed \nprior  to  the  appointments.  Repeated  concerns  have  been  expressed  in  relation  to  weak \ncorporate governance in state-owned commercial banks, which still account for over 50% of the \n\n                                                 \n15 DPSP (see para. 58 of the December 2005 ADB DPSP Board Report) recognized a range of measures adopted by \nBank  Indonesia  that  broadly  aim  at  strengthening  financial  system  soundness.  These  were  not  covered  in  the \noriginal DPL triggers, but noted in the DPSP as part of the financial safety net provisions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fbanking assets. However, the adoption of the GCG regulation holds promise, in that it sets out \nclear principles and sanctions. Combined with the introduction of the deposit insurance scheme, \nand with greater information becoming available to consumers, the regulation could provide an \neffective self-disciplining device for commercial banks. \n \n\n \n\nBox 1: Regulatory Framework on Good Corporate Governance in Commercial Banks \n \nOn 30 January 2006, the governor of Bank Indonesia adopted a regulation defining the principles of good \ncorporate  governance  to  be  adopted  in  all  commercial  banks  in  Indonesia.  The  key  features  of  this \nregulation are outlined below: \n\n\u2022  Board  of  commissioners  (BOC)  and  board  of  directors  shall  each  comprise  no  less  than  three \n\nmembers, with at least 50% of them independent \n\n\u2022  All members of both boards shall pass a fit and proper test conducted by Bank Indonesia \n\u2022  The  BOC  shall  form  at  least  three  committees  dealing  with  risk  management,  audit,  and \n\nremuneration and nomination \n\n\u2022  The  BOC  will  be  held  legally  liable  to  inform  Bank  Indonesia  of  any  violation  of  financial  and \nbanking laws and regulations, or conditions that  may endanger the bank, within 7 days of such \nviolation or availability of such information \n\n\u2022  The BOC shall also be responsible for ensuring that the prevailing regulations on large exposure \n\nare complied with; if not, such violations reported to Bank Indonesia \n\n\u2022  Banks should submit good corporate governance implementation reports within 5 months of the \nfiscal year; every day of delay will attract a fine of Rp1 million ($120) up to 1 month, and a fine of \nRp100  million  ($12,000) \nfined \nRp250 million ($30,000). \n\nthereafter.  Banks  submitting \n\ninaccurate  reports  will  be \n\n\u2022  Banks with more than Rp10 trillion ($1.2 billion) in assets must comply with the good corporate \ngovernance regulation no later than 30 June 2007; those with less than Rp10 trillion assets will \nhave a grace period of 1 year up to 30 June 2008.  \n\nJanuary  2006. \n\nIndonesia  Regulation  No.8/4/PBI/2006,  adopted  on  30 \n\n \nSource:  Bank \nAvailable: www.bi.go.id   \n, \nExpected Impact. To date, there has been no adverse impact in terms of flight to quality \n54. \nof  deposits  arising  from  the  phased  removal  of  the  blanket  guarantee.  However,  the  last \nreduction in March 2007 may pose challenges\u2014a factor that the Government and BI are aware \nof,  and  are  taking  steps  to  monitor  closely.  The  introduction  of  EFF  provides  a  structured \nframework  for  crisis  resolution,  and  thereby  promotes  overall  public  confidence.  For  the  first \ntime,  Bank  Indonesia  has  adopted  GCG  principles,  adherence  to  which  will  enhance  financial \nsystem  stability.  As  the  fit  and  proper  tests  will  require  capacity  within  banks  as  well  as  Bank \nIndonesia, the system is likely to take some time and effort to establish and run properly. The \nenforcement of GCG should also be pursued vigorously, particularly in state-owned commercial \nbanks which have had specific governance related problems in the last few years. \n \n\ng. \n\nImprove the NBFI Regulatory Framework \n\nAccomplishments. The minister of finance adopted an action plan in December 2004, \n55. \nas part of the Financial Governance and Social Security Reform Program, to merge the capital \nmarket  and  financial  institution  supervision  functions,  to  eventually  pave  the  way  for  an \nintegrated financial system regulator (OJK). Several key steps have been taken for the merger \nof  the  Capital  Markets  Supervisory  Authority  (BAPEPAM)  and  the  DG  of  Financial  Institutions \n(DGFI), and necessary personnel changes have been made (trigger 7.1). An echelon 1 official \nhas  been  appointed  to head  the  new  entity,  clearly  paving  the  way  for consolidating  the  NBFI \nsupervision efforts. BAPEPAM-LK is working to improve the operation of the merged regulators \nand increase the capacity of its staff. AusAID and ADB are supporting the transformation as well \nas  providing  training  and  human  resource  development  assistance  to  BAPEPAM-LK  staff.  In \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nline  with  the  action  plan  supported  under  FGSSR16,  the  current  position  of  the  minister  of \nfinance  is  that  the  current  BAPEPAM-LK  should  be  made  independent  as  soon  as  possible\u2014\nand  its  capacity  further  strengthened\u2014instead  of  waiting  until  2010  for  the  establishment  of \nOJK.  An  independent  and  strong  regulator  would  form  the  basis  for  the  OJK,  which  could  be \nestablished  by  2010,  and  is  needed  to  develop  a  coherent  policy  and  regulatory  approach \nconducive to the development of NBFIs.  \n \n56. \nOn  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  the  NBFI  sector,  the  financial  sector  policy \npackage  lays  out  several  key  actions\u2014to  be  implemented  within  12  months  from  July  2006\u2014\nthat  would  help  strengthen  these  subsectors.  In  addition,  a  medium-term  blueprint  has  been \nprepared  in  the  capital  market  and  preparations  for  implementation  are  under  way.  A  pension \nfund road map was adopted in September 2006 and a similar road map is being prepared for \ninsurance  companies  (trigger  7.2).  To  help  strengthen  finance  companies,  MOF  Decree \nNo. 84/PMK.012/2006  was  adopted  in  August  2006.  In  parallel,  BAPEPAM-LK  has  issued \nguidelines  on  the  resolution  of  financially  unsound  insurance  companies  (trigger  7.3).  On  the \noperational  side,  programs  to  ensure  adequate  technical  capacity  among  pension  funds  and \ninsurance  companies  operators  are  now  in  place.  The  operating  licenses  of  several  insolvent \ninsurance  companies  have  been  revoked  to  clean  up  and  consolidate  the  industry.  In  the \ncontext  of  the  IRSDP,  the  Government  has  adopted  a  policy  framework  to  set  up  an \ninfrastructure  fund.  It  is  also  drafting  the  regulatory  framework  to  help  NBFIs  participate  in \ninfrastructure development (trigger 7.3).   \n\n \n\n57. \nExpected  Impact.  Development  of  NBFIs  is  clearly  an  area  that  needs  significantly \ngreater  attention.  The  share  of  NBFIs  in  the  financial  system  was  20.3%  in  December  2003. \nWhile it went up to about 24.5% in 2004, it has fallen to the 2003 level because of large-scale \nredemptions in the mutual fund industry in 2005. The goal of the DPSP cluster is to increase this \nshare to around 25\u201330% by 2008. The fragility of the sector has led to a clear recognition of the \nneed to strengthen NBFIs, with the minister of finance directly overseeing the efforts. Besides \ninstitutional  strengthening  of  the  new  merged  regulator,  the  establishment  of  an  infrastructure \nfund  is  under  way.  Progress  on  development  of  a  securitization  law\u2014a  key  issue  both  for \ndevelopment of NBFIs and infrastructure finance\u2014potentially including submission of the law to \nparliament, is another expected output. ADB has provided advisory support in this area as part \nof ongoing efforts to strengthen the recently established Secondary Mortgage Facility. \n \n\nh. \n\nImprove the Investment Climate Regulatory Framework \n\n58. \nAccomplishments. The Government has made progress in a few key directions in this \narea. The Doing Business 2007 survey17 indicates that the time required to start a business in \nIndonesia has dropped from 151 days in 2005 to around 97 days in 2006 (trigger 8.1). However, \nseveral  issues  remain.  For  example,  there  are  numerous  redundant,  overlapping,  and \nexcessively  complex  business  licenses,  some  of  which  need  to  be  eliminated  and  others \nstreamlined.  The  number  of  steps  to  establish  and  register  a  limited  liability  company  is  still \nexcessive  and  should  be  reduced.  The  National  Team  for  the  Development  of  Exports  and \nInvestments,  coordinated  by  the  minister  of  trade  and  reporting  to  the  President,  has  been \nstrengthened  to  pursue  its  mandate  of  prioritizing  sectors  for  exports  and  investments,  and \nformulating  appropriate  policies  (trigger  8.2).  The  Government  is  also  pursuing  tax  reform \nmeasures (administrative reforms are dealt with under trigger 14) to boost investor confidence. \nWhile  the  adoption  of  the  package  of  tax  laws  has  been  delayed  by  over  a  year,  the \nGovernment  and  the  business  community  have  agreed  in  the  interim  to  introduce  a  few  key \n                                                 \n16  ADB.  2002.

One  such  proposed  change  will  revoke  the  present  requirement  on \ntaxpayers to pay 100% of an assessment even while such an assessment may be under appeal \n(trigger 8.3). However, an administrative penalty of 100% will be imposed if the appeal fails to \nprevent taxpayers from filing frivolous disputes just to delay tax payments. It is expected that the \nrevised amendments will be completed and adopted by parliament by the end of 2006 to take \neffect  in  2007.  Finally,  to  improve  the  overall  legal  framework  for  investments,  the  first  DPSP \nsupported  the  submission  of  a  draft  investment  law  to  parliament  in  2005.  Drafts  of  four \nimplementing  regulations  for  the  new  investment  law  have  been  prepared  to  be  adopted  as \nsoon  as  parliament  enacts  the  investment  law,  including  investment  procedures,  the  negative \nlist, integrated services, and investment incentives (triggers 8.4 and 8.5).     \n \nExpected  Outcome.  Measures  being  adopted  are  expected  to  lower  the  transaction \n59. \ncosts  of  doing  business  and  reduce  business  startup  time  gradually  from  151  to  30 days. \nRegulatory measures on taxes and investment approvals will boost investor confidence. \n   \n\nIII: \n\nImproved  Public  Financial  Management  and \n\n2. \n\nCore  Policy  Area \nAnticorruption \n\n60. \nBackground. Indonesia has made significant progress in strengthening public financial \nmanagement  (PFM),  and  its  efforts  have  sparked  genuine  momentum  in  the  fight  against \ncorruption. Taken in line with the RPJM agenda and as part of the overall governance reforms \noutlined  earlier,  the  PFM  measures  are  beginning  to  have  an  impact  on  the  way  business  is \ndone within the Government. At the national level, the Government aims to have a state-of-the-\nart  PFM  system  in  place  by  2008,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  through  the  GFMRAP \nproject for ex ante (focusing on planning and budgeting) aspects of PFM, and with ADB support \nthrough the State Audit Reform SDP18 for the ex post aspects focused on internal controls and \naudits.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  on  procurement  set  out  the  basic  principles  of \nprocurement:  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and  efficiency.  It  covers  all \nareas of procurement that use public funds and is supposed to cover contracting entities at all \nlevels  of  government.  Subsequently,  the  current  Government  reorganized  MOF,  including  the \nseparation of the budget and treasury functions. Notable progress includes making the national \nbudget compatible with the international standard Government Financial Statistics classification \nand  establishing  a  Treasury  Single  Account  (TSA).  These  reforms  are  making  important \ncontributions to increasing the efficiency, transparency, and reducing corruption in PFM. \n \n61. \nHowever,  key  indicators  of  government  budget  performance  have  not  improved,  most \nimportantly  the  pattern  of  disbursement.  Public  investment  from  the  central  Government \n(i.e., development  expenditures)  was  consistently  lower  than  its  latest  estimates.  In  addition, \nIndonesia still spends 50% of its capital expenditures in the last quarter of the year. For the last \n5 years, spending has started very slowly and then accelerated. This unhealthy pattern raises \nconcern. Economic activity is disrupted by an unnatural cycle; project implementation starts late \nor, as in the case of multiyear projects, is interrupted at the beginning of each year. \n \n62.  With respect to tax administration, despite progress on extending the modern tax office \nsystem, the tax system is still characterized by relatively low revenue generation, poorly defined \nand  overly  complicated  taxes  (i.e.,  creating  excessive  compliance  costs),  and  poor  and \ninconsistent  enforcement  (i.e.,  creating  uncertainty  and  abuse).  The  problem  requires  better \noversight of tax officials, and partly stems from a systematic lack of information and capacity for \ntax  and  customs  analysis  outside  tax  and  customs  offices.  The  lack  of  capacity  has  led  to  an \n                                                 \n18  ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans  to  the \n\nRepublic of Indonesia for the State Audit Reform Sector Development Program. Manila (November). \n\n\f \n\n21\n\ninability  to  accurately  assess  and  forecast  the  implications  of  the  proposed  tax  and  customs \nchanges, reduced checks and balances, and the inability to balance taxpayer and government \nrequirements. \n \nTriggers under Core Policy Area III. There are seven triggers under this area, focused \n63. \non (i) completing implementing regulations for the treasury and audit laws; (ii) further expanding \nthe TSA system; (iii) improving PFM reporting;  (iv) setting up the National Procurement Policy \nOffice  (NPPO);  (v)  strengthening  tax  administration;  (vi)  supporting  anticorruption  through \nwitness protection measures; and (vii) initiating civil service reforms.      \n \n\na. \n\nImplement Treasury and Audit Laws \n\n64. \nAccomplishments.  Progress  has  been  under  way  in  drafting  a  range  of  regulations \n(trigger 9). One key policy measure is pending since DPL-2 (the first DPSP) on the Government \nRegulation  on  State  Cash  Management,  which  is  currently  under  interministerial  review  and \nexpected  to  be  approved  by  the  President  in  December  2006.  Bank  Indonesia  and  the \nGovernment have yet to reach agreement on remuneration on government cash balances under \nthe  TSA.  A  government  regulation  has  been  adopted  on  State  Asset  Management  [Peraturan \nPemerintan  (PP) No. 6/2006]  in  April  2006,  outlining  the  roles  and  responsibility  of  various \ninstitutions  on  asset  management,  valuation,  oversight,  disposal,  etc.  Three  other  government \nregulations  are  under  drafting  for  the  State  Treasury  Law:  (i)  internal  control  systems\u2014the \nfinalization  of  this  regulation  has  been  controversial  because  of  the  role  of  internal  audit \nagencies;19  (ii)  budget  implementation\u2014this  regulation,  covering  budget payment  and  revenue \nmechanisms, is expected to be adopted by the end of 2006, to become effective from 2007; and \n(iii)  state  investment  management\u2014covering  all  state  infrastructure.  With  respect  to  the  State \nAudit  Law,  BPK  as  the  Supreme  Audit  Institution  has  been  charged  with  the  responsibility  to \nfollow up with the respective regulations and memoranda of understanding. The latter pertain to \nthe  issuance  of  auditing  standards  (Article  5),  outsourcing  of  auditors  (Article  9),  guidance  on \naudit  summons  (Articles  10,11),  guidance  on  investigative  audits  (Article  13),  guidance  on \nsubmission  of  fraud  in  audit  findings  (Article  14),  guidance  on  submission  of  audit  reports  to \nlegislative body (Article 17), and guidance on settlement of state losses (Article 22). Significant \nprogress  has  been  made\u2014to  date,  BPK  has  drafted  the  auditing  standards  (Article  5),  three \nimplementing  regulations  (Articles  9,  22,  and  11),  a  concept  manual  for  investigative  auditing \n(Article  13),  and  two  memoranda  of  understanding  (Articles  14  and  17)  to  satisfy  the \nrequirements  of  the  State  Audit  Law.  The  BPK  Law  (Law  No.  15/2006)  was  enacted  on \n30 October 2006. It replaces Law No. 5/1973; complements the State Audit Law; and clarifies \nthe roles, responsibilities, and structure of BPK.   \n \n65. \nExpected Impact. Along with the Law on State Finances, the State Treasury and State \nAudit  laws  form  the  most  important  legislation  in  Indonesia.  The  regulations  and  memoranda \nadopted will provide a sound framework for enhancing overall transparency and accountability, \nas all line agencies utilizing public resources will come under the purview of these regulations.  \n \n\nb. \n\nContinue Implementation of the TSA \n\n66. \nAccomplishments.  Pilots  for  zero  balance  transitory  accounts  were  begun  under  the \nfirst DPSP in Jakarta, Bekasi, and Batam; and extended to 50 State Treasury Offices (KPPNs) \nin  September  2006  (trigger  10.1).  Further  implementation  of  TSA  (expenditure  and  revenue \naccounts), with TSA implemented in all KPPNs, is proposed for mid-2007 in three phases: (i) all \n                                                 \n19  ADB\u2019s  State  Audit  Reform  SDP  is  providing  implementation  support  here.  The  issue  relates  to  the  role  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s Internal Audit Agency and the significant human and other institutional resources at its disposal vis-\n\u00e0-vis its own mandate which has been considerably reduced in recent years. A small five-person interagency team \nhas been established to resolve the disagreement.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nKPPNs with links to Bank Indonesia; (ii) KPPNs with their accounts outside BI in Java-Madura; \nand  (iii)  KPPNs  with  their  accounts  outside  BI  and  located  elsewhere.  On  30  October  2006, \nMOF  also  piloted  a  national  revenue  module  that  automatically  links  revenue  deposits\u2014tax, \ncustoms  receipts,  and  other  non-tax  revenues\u2014into  treasury  systems.  This  pilot  will  end  on \n31 December  2006,  when  the  system  is  expected  to  be  fully  operational.  A  more  rapid \nexpansion  of  the  TSA  can  be  accomplished  once  the  government  regulation  on  cash \nmanagement  and  the  ensuing  implementing  guidelines  are  adopted.  With  regard  to  the \nconsolidation  of  Regional  Development  Accounts  and  oil  transitory  accounts,  the  Government \nhas  expressed  interest  in  working  with  the  development  partners  under  DPSP-3  to  monitor \nprogress. \n \n67. \nExpected  Impact.  About  30,000  bank  accounts  are  planned  to  reach  zero  balance  in \n2006,  resulting  in  an  overnight  sweep  of  about  Rp10  trillion  ($1.2  billion)  into  the  TSA.  Once \nexpanded, there will be significant benefits through improved cash management and enhanced \ntransparency. \n \n\nc. \n\nStrengthen Budget and Financial Reporting and Accounting \n\n68. \nAccomplishments.  In  the  area  of  reporting,  the  Government  has  demonstrated \nconsistent  and  sound  progress  since  MOF  reorganization  in  2004.  DG  Treasury  currently  has \nthe ability to generate flash reports on budget disbursements and revenue receipts transactions \nconducted  through  KPPNs  and  the  State  Treasury.20  Delays  have  been  reduced  in  the \naggregation of KPPN transactions and their reconciliation with ministry work unit records by the \nDG  Treasury  regional  offices.  In  the  past,  such  differences  have  been  significant,  including \ndifferences  with  some  agencies  within  MOF,  such  as  the  tax  and  customs  and  excise \ndirectorates.  In  preparing  the  financial  statements  for  FY2005,  much  effort  was  expended  in \nidentifying and reducing such differences. Early in FY2006, a new system was set up whereby \nthe MOF and line agency reports must be reconciled on a monthly basis at KPPN level and on a \nquarterly basis at provincial DG Treasury office levels. The relevant instructions and operating \nmanuals  to  guide  this  process  have  been  issued.  These  steps  have  resulted  in  a  reduction  in \nunreconciled differences.   \n \n69. \nIn addition, MOF has instituted a system to obtain from all KPPNs copies of the year-end \nbank  statements  of  the  operational  bank  accounts  under  their  management.  Pending  the \nintroduction of a TSA, this is seen as a positive interim measure to enforce greater reliability of \nbank  balance  figures  at  the  year-end  and  to  identify  cases  of  major  differences  between \nreported  and  actual  bank  balances.  Comparing  financial  statements  for  2004  and  2005, \nprogress has been made in the following principal areas: (i) improved reconciliation of income \nand  expenditure  between  DG  Treasury  and  line  ministries;  (ii)  improvements  in  timely \nproduction  of  annual  financial  statements;  (iii)  greater  comprehensiveness  of  financial \nstatements  with  data  from  an  additional  21  agencies  now  included  in  the  aggregation;  (iv) \nimproved accountability from line ministries, with new requirements to submit budget realization \nreports  with  letters  of  representations  signed  and  endorsed  by  the  respective  minister  and \ninspector  general;  (v) improved  reliability  of  financial  reports  through  regular  reconciliation  of \nincome and expenditure, and verification of bank balances in accounts held by line ministries; \nand  (vi)  an  expanded  set  of  notes  to  accounts  with  disclosures  on  accounting  policies,  and \nsignificant transactions and inclusion of prior year figures for comparison. However, several key \nissues  still  need  to  be  addressed  to  accomplish  the  spirit  of  this  trigger  despite  these \nimprovements. These issues, which will be monitored during 2007 by the Government and the \n\n                                                 \n20  Mechanisms  and  procedures  for  the  preparation  of  Budget  Realization  Reports  are  outlined  in  MOF  Decree  No. \n\n59/2005. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\ndevelopment partners, include: (i) the disclosure of some significant fund movements within the \nfinancial statements; and (ii) improved disclosure of movements of debt. \n \nExpected  Impact.  Clearly,  progress  made  to  date  has  had  a  positive  impact  through \n70. \nthe  new  regulatory  requirements \nenhanced \nintroduced  have  reduced  the  scope  for  any  improper  utilization  of  resources  or  misreporting. \nThe  trigger  will  be  fulfilled  upon  evidence  of  improved  quarterly  reports  by  organizational \nclassification, and regular reporting by functional and economic classifications\u2014published in the \npublic domain. \n  \n\nfacilitating  reconciliation, \n\ntransparency.  By \n\nd. \n\nInstitutionalize Coordination Arrangements for National \nProcurement \n\nAccomplishments.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  on  public  procurement  requires \n71. \nthat the NPPO be established by 1 January 2005. However, this has been a contentious issue, \nas  line  ministries  and  public  agencies  have  resisted  the  NPPO  idea  out  of  concern  that  it  will \ncentralize control. The draft decree on NPPO was recently endorsed by the minister of planning, \nbut it needs to be reviewed and cleared by other ministries concerned as the NPPO is part of a \nlarger and more complicated reorganization in BAPPENAS. However, significant work has been \nunder way in parallel in preparing for the establishment of the NPPO and developing institutional \ncapacity. For example, a centralized training and procurement practitioner\u2019s certification system \nis under development, with certification at various levels. The system has commenced targeting \ngovernment  procurement  practitioners  with  initial  certification  to  the  basic  level  through  a \ncomputerized  testing  system.  With  ADB  support,  the  directorate  on  public  procurement  in \nBAPPENAS  (predecessor  to  the  NPPO)  has  formulated  standard  bidding  documents,  which \nwould help standardize the procurement process across line agencies. Ideally, a national policy \nbody  should  have  sufficient  authority  across  all  levels  of  government  in  a  decentralized \nenvironment.  Therefore,  the  NPPO  would  best  be  established  as  a  stand-alone  independent \nentity reporting directly to the President. However, given the political difficulties, an acceptable \ninterim solution may be that the NPPO is established as an independent entity reporting to the \nminister  of  planning  with  subsequent  empowerment  as  an  independent  entity  under  the \nproposed new procurement law. Its actual establishment will be monitored under DPSP-3. \n \nExpected  Impact.  The  NPPO  will  help  make  public  procurement  transparent  by \n72. \nstreamlining  national  and  local  requirements.  By  harmonizing  regulatory  practices,  the \nGovernment\u2019s ongoing anticorruption drive will be significantly enhanced. \n \n\ne. \n\nStrengthen Tax Administration \n\n73. \nAccomplishments.  The  Tax  Department  has  proposed  a  new  structure  for  its \nheadquarters  designed  to  refocus  on  functional  issues  including  change  management,  risk \nmanagement,  monitoring  the  code  of  conduct,  internal  control,  research,  and  outreach \n(trigger 13). This is in contrast to the previous system focused on the type of tax. Such a change \nis expected to better focus the department\u2019s energy and resources on what is expected to be a \nlong-term reform process. The proposal has been approved by the President, as it varies from \nstandard civil service procedures.  \n \n\nf. \n\nPromote Anticorruption and Transparency \n\n74. \nThe Government has made some notable progress on the anticorruption front. To gain \ncredibility,  the  Government  focused  initially  on  a  high  profile  anticorruption  campaign.  It \nstrengthened the institutional framework for anticorruption rather than targeting individuals. High \nprofile  corruption  investigations  have  been  launched  at  every  level  of  government  and  even \namong some state-owned enterprises. More than 100 investigations have been approved by the \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\nPresident,  targeting  mayors,  governors,  and  ministerial  level  officials;  these  have  led  to  a \nnumber of successful prosecutions. As a lesson from the expanded anticorruption drive, it has \nbecome clear that those who provide information should be given adequate protection under the \nlaw to encourage greater sharing of information on corruption.    \n \n75. \nAccomplishments. Parliament enacted the Witness and Victim Protection Law in June \n2006 (trigger 14). The law mandates the establishment of a special commission and secretariat \nto  ensure  implementation  of  the  provisions  of  the  Law.  A  properly  resourced  commission  and \nsecretariat  should  be  in  place  in  2007.  The  law  includes  both  whistleblower  and  witness \nprotection, and its passage would provide adequate safeguards for those providing information \nrelevant to legal cases.  \n \nExpected  Impact.  The  passage  of  the  Witness  and  Victim  Protection  Law  is  an \n76. \nimportant breakthrough in facilitating anticorruption cases as it provides a comprehensive set of \nprotections for witnesses who testify in criminal cases, including corruption crimes. \n \n\ng. \n\nInitiate Civil Service Reforms \n\n77. \nAccomplishments.  In  line  with  recent  efforts  to  initiate  civil  service  reforms,  the \nGovernment  has  launched  a  job  evaluation  exercise  for  high-ranking  state  officials,  beginning \nwith training a team of evaluators (trigger 15.1). Necessary regulation of the establishment of an \nindependent  Remuneration  Commission  has  been  drafted,  discussed  among  the  relevant \nagencies, and submitted to the state secretary  for review (trigger 15.2). Progress on this front \ncould herald a new era in strengthening the civil service in Indonesia. \n \n\n3. \n\nCore Policy Area IV: Improved Public Service Delivery \n\n78. \nBackground.  The  Government\u2019s  goal  to  reduce  poverty  is  exemplified  by  its  2005 \nreallocation  of  savings  from  fuel  subsidy  reductions  to  programs  targeting  the  poor.  The  UCT \nprogram21 compensates poor and near-poor households for the short-term impact of fuel price \nincrease. The operational aid to schools and health insurance programs are expected to benefit \npoorer households by increasing access to primary health and basic education services through \nlower  (or  no)  fees,  while  the  village  infrastructure  program  is  intended  to  provide  village \ninfrastructure in less developed areas, and create employment. \n \n79. \nIn a few months leading up to the cuts in fuel subsidies, the Government rapidly set up a \nnationwide  UCT  program  (Rp300,000  or  $32  per  quarter  for  each  household)  covering \n15.5 million  households.  Designed  to  last  1  year,  program  improvements  were  made  prior  to \nissuing the second tranche of payments and an additional 3.7 million households were added as \nbeneficiaries.  The  Government  is  currently  developing  a  CCT  program  to  be  implemented, \nstarting in six provinces in 2007, modeled on successful programs in other countries, notably in \nLatin America. The CCT has a short-term poverty reduction objective as well as a longer-term \ngoal  of  improving  human  capital  outcomes  for  the  poor.  In  addition  to  piloting  CCT  to \nhouseholds,  the  Government  plans  to  build  on  Indonesia\u2019s  extensive  experience  with \ncommunity-driven  development  projects  by  piloting  a  grant  to  communities  to  improve  health \nand educational outcomes. \n   \n80. \nAccomplishments. BAPPENAS undertook a rapid assessment of the UCT program in \nDecember  2005  in  15  districts/municipalities  in  10  provinces.  It  used  the  findings  to  make \nchanges for disbursement of the second tranche of cash transfers, including (i) changes to the \nbeneficiary  registry,  (ii)  improved  public  awareness,  (iii)  improved  payment  procedures,  and \n                                                 \n21  Para.38  of  ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  for  a  Proposed \n\nLoan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Development Policy Support Program. Manila (November). \n\n\f \n\n25\n\n(iv) modified  complaints  resolution  procedures.  Qualitative  assessments  of  the  education \nprograms  (in  five  provinces)  and  health  programs  (in  six  provinces)  were  undertaken  in \nMarch 2006  (trigger  16.1).  The  World  Bank  and  ADB  have  provided  TA  support  for  these \nassessments.  Preliminary  findings  were  distributed  to  BAPPENAS  and  line  ministries  in \nApril 2006 in line with BAPPENAS\u2019 request to have the findings as an input to the Government\u2019s \nplanning  and  budgeting  cycle.  Final  reports  were  disseminated  in  workshops  for  government \nand donor agencies in July 2006. The World Bank is undertaking a comprehensive analysis of \nthe household expenditure survey data to corroborate the findings of the assessments. A draft \nreport  is  expected  in  December  2006.  BAPPENAS  has  utilized  the  lessons  learned  from  the \nUCT  and  other  public  expenditure  programs  in  the  design  of  the  CCT.  In  particular,  several \nsteps have been taken to improve the UCT database for use in the CCT pilot, including devising \na better scoring system and weights, and adopting systematic approaches for targeting based \non estimates from poverty mapping. In November and December 2006, the National Statistics \nOffice  will  verify  the  eligibility  of  current  UCT  beneficiaries  on  the  new  scoring  system  in  CCT \npilot districts. \n \nExpected  Impact.  In  addition  to  emphasizing  changes  to  the  existing  programs, \n81. \nBAPPENAS  has  actively  utilized  lessons  learned  from  the  post-fuel  subsidy  compensation \nprogram assessments to make improvements to the design of the Government\u2019s CCT program, \nwhich it intends to pilot in 2007. Some of the key influences from the rapid assessment findings \nhave  been  in  beneficiary  targeting,  utilization  of  the  postal  service  to  distribute  funds;  and \nrecognition that socialization and training have to be prioritized and carried out well in advance \nof program implementation, and that a working complaints mechanism is key to ensuring future \nprogram improvements.   \n \nD. \n\nMonitoring the Impact of the DPSP Cluster \n\n82. \nAs  part  of  the  policy  matrix  for  DPL-1  (prior  to  ADB\u2019s  direct  cofinancing  involvement), \noutcome indicators were introduced to highlight the expected key results of the support. These \nindicators  were  taken  from  government  planning  documents.  The  results  framework  was \nsubsequently  strengthened  as  part  of  DPL-2  (the  first  DPSP).  Additional  indicators  have  been \nadded  in  line  with  the  expansion  of  triggers  to  the  DPL  core  policy  areas.  Given  the \nGovernment\u2019s  request  to  the  World  Bank  and  the  latter\u2019s  decision  to  extend  the  Program  by \n1 year  and  to  DPL-4,  the  targets  for  each  outcome  indicator  have  been  updated  to  reflect  the \nexpected outcomes by the end of 2008. These indicators are expected to provide the basis for a \ncomprehensive evaluation of the Program after DPL-4 (DPSP-3). Other indicators, such as the \nstandardized  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  used  to  assess  PFM,  would \nsupplement  such  an  evaluation.  However,  like  all  policy-based  lending,  it  would  be  difficult  to \nattribute  broad-based  changes  or  development  outcomes  to  specific  policy  actions  under  the \nDPL  program,  although  the  contribution  of  these  triggers  and  the  policy  dialogue  and  analytic \nwork that underpin them could be discerned. \n \n83. \nOverall,  the  Government  is  on  course  to  meet  most  of  the  expected  outcomes  of  the \nDPL  program.  The  policy  actions  supported  by  the  Program  have  helped  to  strengthen  fiscal \npolicy,  and  in  so  doing,  helped  to  reduce  public  debt  levels  and  raise  non-oil  and  gas \ninvestors  over  macroeconomic \nrevenues\u2014thus,  addressing \ninstability.  DPL-supported  reforms  have  also  reduced  the  burden  on  the  business  community, \ne.g., making it easier and less costly to register and license new businesses, and strengthening \nthe regulatory environment. Financial sector reforms have helped to diversify and strengthen the \nfinancial  sector.  On  governance,  the  DPL  program  has  helped  accelerate  reform  measures \nrecommended  by  the  CFAA,  improving  budget  management,  and  making  financial  systems \nmore  transparent  and  effective.  Appendix  1,  Table  A1.1  details  progress  made  since  the \n\nthe  chief  concerns  among \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n\ninception of the Program on each of the DPL outcome indicators. Table A1.2 presents the DPL \nresults matrix presented in the World Bank\u2019s board document.22 \n \nE. \n\nForward-Looking Triggers for DPSP-323 \n\nIn deciding on the triggers for DPSP-3, there was agreement between the Government \n84. \nand  the  development  partners  that  the  focus  of  the  DPL  should  reflect  an  emerging  reform \nagenda that is transitioning from post-crisis macroeconomic stability, given the established track \nrecord in recent years of maintaining a stable macro-economy. Focus will remain on three key \npriorities: (i) improving the investment climate\u2014based on the Government\u2019s investment climate \nand  financial  sector  strategies,  and  its  emerging  policy  package  on  SMEs;  (ii)  improving  PFM \nand  anticorruption\u2014the  recommendations  spelled  out  in  the  CFAA  of  2001  continue  to  be \nrelevant  and  the  selection  of  triggers  was  based  on  the  need  to  ensure  continued \nimplementation of government legislation to reform the institutional and regulatory framework for \nPFM;  in  this  regard,  DPSP-3  (DPL-4)  will  also  broaden  the  policy  agenda  to  include  new  and \nemerging  priority  areas,  notably  on  governance,  civil  service  reform,  and  anticorruption;  and \n(iii) improving  public  service  delivery.  Thus,  greater  macroeconomic  stability  and \ncreditworthiness will become embedded within the Program as an objective and outcome, rather \nthan a separate core policy area. \n \n85. \nParticular  attention  was  also  given  to  how  triggers  would  facilitate  achievement  of  the \nDPL  program\u2019s  expected  outcomes,  especially  those  where  progress  has  been  slower  than \nexpected.  In  line  with  the  program  cluster  approach  adopted  for  DPSP,  the  proposed  triggers \nbuild  upon  previous  actions  on  specific  policy  issues.24  Appendix  3,  Table  A3.1  presents  the \nindicative  triggers  for  DPSP-3  (DPL-4)  to  be  processed  and  implemented  during  2007.  As \noutlined  in  Figure  2,  the  implementation  of  DPSPs  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  the  other \nsector-specific program loans on infrastructure, financial deepening, poverty reduction and MDG \nacceleration, and decentralization. \n \nF. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n86. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $200 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance DPSP-2. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; conversion options \nthat  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and \nADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft program \nloan  agreement.  The  Government  has  made  its  own  independent  decision  to  borrow  under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  it  has  given  an  undertaking  that  this  choice  was  not \nmade on the basis of any advice from ADB. The Government envisages support from ADB of \naround $200 million for DPSP-3, which will be reconfirmed during 2007. \n \nThe  Government  aims  to  increase  development  spending  in  2006;  as  a  result,  it \n87. \nenvisages a higher fiscal deficit of \u20131.1% of GDP up from \u20130.5% in 2005. Amortization of debt \nwill be higher in 2006 at $6.5 billion against $4.1 billion in 2005 because of the end of Paris Club \nrescheduling arrangements. The Government has sought $1.3 billion in program loan financing \nfrom  ADB,  Japan,  and  World  Bank.  For  the  proposed  DPL-3,  the  World  Bank  envisages \n\n                                                 \n22  World  Bank.  2006.

Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for Development Policy Support Program. Manila (December), provides an illustration of the \nsequencing of the reform measures over the medium-term. \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nproviding  a  $600  million  program  loan,  comprising  $530  million  lent  on  International  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  terms,  and  $70  million  on  International  Development \nAssociation terms to help meet the reconstruction needs in Yogyakarta and Central Java. \n \nADB\u2019s  proposed  support  is  based  on  the  strengths  of  the  policy  package,  its \n88. \ndevelopment impact, the importance of the sectors covered, and the investment needs. Besides \nthe  overall  financing  needs  stemming  from  the  greater  focus  on  development  spending,  the \nGovernment will incur cash outlays, estimated at around $350 million, to implement many of the \ninstitutional  strengthening  measures  supported  under  DPSP-2,  such  as  modernization  of  tax \nadministration and establishment of BKF, among others.  \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n89. \nThe  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  (CMEA)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency, \ncollaborating  closely  with  MOF.  Implementation  of  the  DPL-3/DPSP-2  actions  has  been \ncoordinated with a number of other ministries and agencies, including BAPPENAS, Ministry of \nTrade, Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, and Bank Indonesia.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe reforms under DPSP-2 have been implemented during 2006, with actions in some \n90. \nareas  continuing  into  2007.  The  Government  and  the  development  partners  will  prepare  a \nprogram completion report by mid-2007.  \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n\n91. \nThe  program  loan  of  $200  million  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon  loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding  the  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  6)  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,  the \nproceeds  of  the  program  loan  will be  disbursed  to  the  Republic of  Indonesia  as the  Borrower. \nNo supporting import documentation will be required, if during each year that loan proceeds are \nexpected to be disbursed the value of Indonesia\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The \nGovernment  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. Disbursements will \nbe made under the simplified procedures for program loans.  \n\n \n4. \n\nAnticorruption \n\nADB\u2019s  policy  Anticorruption  (1998)  was  explained \n\n92. \nthe \nGovernment.  In  addition,  the  DPSP  cluster  has  a  core  focus  on  improving  governance  and \nanticorruption.  It  promotes  transparency  in  PFM.  Noteworthy  progress  has  been  achieved \nthrough  the  TSA  system,  for  instance,  which  will  help  the  Government  in  its  anticorruption \nefforts.  The Program\u2019s  focus  on  improving  auditing  framework  will  strengthen  the  independent \noversight  mechanisms  already  in  place.  The  recent  enactment  of  the  Witness  and  Victim \nProtection Law, supported by the Program, will help the special anticorruption agencies in their \nefforts. \n \n\nto  and  discussed  with \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe Government places significant emphasis on strengthening internal control systems \n93. \nand  overall  PFM,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  through  the  GFMRAP  and  from  ADB \nthrough the State Audit Reform SDP. Reforms and capacity building initiatives supported under \nboth these programs have led to initial progress in strengthening PFM (Appendix 7). \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n94. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal applications. Prior to withdrawal, the Government \nwill open a deposit account at Bank Indonesia to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\nCMEA, MOF, and BAPPENAS will continuously monitor the implementation of the DPL \n95. \nrelated  reforms  and  their  impact,  in  line  with  the  overall  program  framework  and  outcome \nindicators agreed upon with the Government. The outcomes of each phase will be reviewed on \nan ongoing basis, and an overall evaluation of the program cluster will take place in 2008. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impacts \n\nA. \n\n96. \n \n\nThe key benefits expected from the implementation of the DPSP cluster are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nin  meeting \n\nProgress \nthe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  objectives  of \n(a) macroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness,  (b)  improved  investment \nclimate,  (c)  anticorruption  and  improved  governance,  and  (d)  improved  service \ndelivery. \nConsolidation  of  recent  macroeconomic  and  policy  reforms  leading  to  the \nformulation of a credible medium-term public expenditure framework. \nAid harmonization and cofinancing by the key development partners (ADB, World \nBank,  and  Government  of  Japan)  around  a  common  policy  framework  and \ndialogue,  and  the  resulting  endorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s  sound  policy \nimplementation and macroeconomic management. \nFacilitation,  through  crosscutting  reforms,  of  sector-specific  reforms  in  areas \nwhere ADB is providing or planning support. \n\n \n97. \nInstitutional.  Significant  benefits  stem  from  the  engagement  of  Indonesia\u2019s  three \nprincipal development partners. Participation in the DPL series has helped in overall institutional \ncoordination  among  the  partners  as  well  as  between  the  Government  and  the  partners. \nProvision  of  advisory  support  through  TA  has  also  been  significantly  streamlined  and \ncoordinated to best meet the Government\u2019s needs. The measures supported under the DPSP \ncluster  will  result  in  sustained  institutional  capacity  in  key  areas  of  policy  formulation  such  as \nfiscal policy, debt and treasury management, and public expenditure and financial management.  \n \n98. \nSocial. The main contribution of support being leveraged through DPSPs is in the form \nof improved public administration, sustaining effective public expenditure reorientation towards \nproductive  needs,  and  continuously  supporting  government  measures  to  effectively  align  its \nresources  with  its  medium-term  objectives  of  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  By \nfocusing  on  supporting  strategic  reforms  aimed  at  improving  public  service  delivery,  the \nProgram  will  have  direct  beneficial  social  impact.  Appendix  8  presents  a  summary  poverty \nreduction and social impact mitigation assessment. \n \n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEconomic. The nature of the DPSP series does not allow for quantitative financial and \n99. \neconomic  analysis.  However,  significant  general  economic  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  entire \ncountry from the policy initiatives under the four core areas under the present phase. \n \n100.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environment. Implementation of the DPSP-2 \nmeasures will cause no direct or indirect involuntary resettlement, nor will it lead to any issues \naffecting indigenous peoples. Based on desk review, the measures supported under the DPSP-\n2 are unlikely to have any adverse environmental impacts. \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n101.  The implementation of the DPSP cluster is subject to the following risks: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\nSustaining  reforms.  Economic  volatility  could  worsen  if  the  Government  does \nnot  sustain  the  reform  momentum  to  follow  up  on  the  recent  reduction  in  fuel \nsubsidies  (including  maintaining  appropriate  interest  rates  and  investment \nclimate  reforms).  External  vulnerabilities  are  also  a  factor  to  be  reckoned.  This \nrisk is mitigated by the clear policy stance taken to date by the Government and \nBank  Indonesia.  The  need  for  rapid  policy  adjustments  in  line  with  key  global \ndevelopments is clearly recognized by both sides. The DPSP series has several \nmeasures  that  support  the  emergence  of  sustained  reforms,  and  assist  the \nGovernment in achieving overall macroeconomic stability.   \n\nFiduciary constraints. Notwithstanding the improvements under way, there are \ncontinuing concerns over the utilization of public resources. The overall fiduciary \nassessments  undertaken  since  2001 \nindicated \nconsiderable  improvements  in  the  overall  fiduciary  environment  in  Indonesia. \nOngoing  programs  supported  by  several  development  partners  provide \nsignificant  TA  support  to  strengthen  fiduciary  governance.  The  focus  on  TSA \nimplementation  will  significantly  enhance  transparency.  The  DPSP  cluster  will \nhelp  enhance  overall  accountability  as  well,  as  demonstrated  for  instance  by \nsubmission  of  government-wide  financial  statements  to  parliament  and  their \nwidespread dissemination. \n\nthe  CFAA)  have \n\n(with \n\n(iii)  Coordination  and  capacity  constraints.  Effective  implementation  of  reforms \nhas  been  stymied  in  the  past  by  lack  of  coordination  between  ministries  and \ngovernment agencies, and lack of capacity. Lack of such coordination could slow \ndown reform efforts. Changing incentives and improving performance orientation \nin  the  civil  service,  an  area  supported  under  the  DPSP  cluster,  will  be  key  in \nalleviating these constraints. Some ministries (e.g., MOF) have begun to promote \ncivil  servants  on  the  basis  of  merit  rather  than  age  or  seniority.  To  address  the \ncapacity  constraints,  the  Government  has  begun  to  use  TA  resources  more \neffectively for implementation purposes and on-the-job training. \n\n(iv) \n\nPublic opposition to reforms. The public and special interest groups generally \noppose tariff reforms and some aspects of investment climate reforms (such as \nlabor).  The  Government  managed  the  fuel  subsidy  reduction  well,  while  labor \nreforms have slowed down. The DPSP cluster allows for flexibility, enabling the \nGovernment to build consensus for reforms to ensure their acceptance.       \n\n(v)  Heightened  security  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and  regional \nconflicts  and  terrorism  could  slow  foreign  direct  investment  and  set  back  the \nrecovering  tourism  industry.  The  Government  and  law  enforcement  authorities \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n29\n\n \n\n\fhave  taken  a  range  of  measures  aimed  at  rebuilding  public  and  investor \nconfidence. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n102. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n\nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  development  needs  as  outlined \nunder the DPSP-2 implementation arrangements.  \n\nThe policies and actions taken prior to the date of the DPSP-2 loan agreement, \nas  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will \ncontinue to be in effect for the duration of ADB\u2019s engagement in the DPL series, \nand subsequently. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \n\n103. \nADB and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n\nthe program cluster in an aggregate amount not exceeding $400,000,000 to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Development Policy Support Program; and \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(i)  \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $200,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Second \nDevelopment  Policy  Support  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources, \nwith  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3 years;  and  such  other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Program Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n27 November 2006 \n\n30 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n\nTABLE A1.1.

Fiscal Policy. The Government of Indonesia (the Government) established a \n1. \nFinancial  Management  Reform  Committee  in  2002  to  help  prepare  a  comprehensive \nrestructuring of the institutional and legal architecture for fiscal management in Indonesia. The \ncommittee  accomplished  two  key  outputs.  The  first  was  to  enact  the  laws  to  strengthen  fiscal \nmanagement:  (i)  Law  on  State  Finance  (Law  No.  17/2003),  (ii)  Law  on  State  Treasury \n(Law No. 1/2004), and (iii) Law on State Audit (Law No. 15/2004). The second was to adopt a \nmajor overhaul of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to perform only fiscal functions, by separating \nall  other  non-fiscal  responsibilities  such  as  financial  sector  supervision,  among  others.  The \nimplementation  took  place  over  2004,  when  a  new  treasury  was  created,  all  budget  functions \nwere  consolidated  into  a  directorate  general  to  move  towards  a  functional  classification  of  the \nbudget,  the  Agency  for  Economic  and  Fiscal  Research  became  operational,  and  the  financial \nsector supervision functions moved to a separate agency. The broader thrust behind both steps \nhas  been  supported  by  the  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL)/DPSP  process.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has supported in a number of related aspects, most notably a human \nresource  assessment  of  MOF, \nfacilitating  Financial  Management  Reform  Committee\u2019s \ndiagnostics. ADB also provided inputs to the laws and the related regulations. The World Bank \nhas supported through the formulation of its Government Financial Management and Revenue \nAdministration Project.  \n \n2. \nTrigger  2.  Debt  Management.  Fiscal  consolidation  has  been  the  hallmark  of \nmacroeconomic management in Indonesia. A key part of this has been continuous improvement \nin debt management, an outcome supported by the DPL process. By the end of 2005, the ratio \nof  debt  to  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  had  dropped  to  47%,  from  55%  in  2004  and  over \n100% in 1999. Even with the ongoing scaling up in public spending on education, health, and \ninfrastructure\u2014and  the  resulting  higher  fiscal  deficit  of  \u20131.1%  as  envisaged  in  the  2006 \nbudget\u2014fiscal  sustainability  should  not  be  affected  as  long  as  international  oil  prices  remain \nrelatively high. With this, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall below 30% in 2010. Under the \nfirst phase of DPSP/DPL-2, the Government adopted and began the implementation of a debt \nmanagement  strategy  (MOF  Decree  No.  06/2005),  which  was  presented  to  parliament  in \nSeptember  2005.  The  strategy  outlined  the  risks  to  central  government  debt,  the  instruments \ncurrently  available,  and  provided  direction  for  decisions  on  borrowing  and  buybacks.  DPSP-2 \naims to deepen this support. \n \n3. \nTrigger  3.  Streamlining  Decentralization.  Within  7  years,  Indonesia  has  become \nhighly decentralized, in comparison with the pre-crisis regime. There is full political autonomy, in \nthat  the  heads  of  districts  are  directly  elected  by  the  citizens.  Local  assemblies  approve \nbudgets. In 2004, the regions commanded about 35% of total government spending. Given the \nsharp increase in regional transfers in 2006, the regional share in total public investment is likely \nto rise above 50% in 2006. The regions also employ about three quarters of the 4.2 million civil \nservants.  Yet,  the  decentralization  agenda  is  far  from  complete,  as  there  are  numerous \nconstraints pertaining to clarity of functional responsibilities, funding allocations not being in line \nfunctions,  lopsided  control  exerted  by  the  national  Government  without  any  corresponding \naccountability,  wide-ranging \nlaws  on \ndecentralization  and  sectoral  laws,  unrealistic  pursuit  of  minimum  service  standards  without \nregard  for  fiscal  position,  severe  capacity  constraints,  and  most  importantly,  significant \nweaknesses  in  public  service  delivery.  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  Local  Government  Finance  and \n\ninconsistencies  between \n\nframework \n\nlegal \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nGovernance Reform Sector Development Program (SDP)1 and the proposed Poverty Reduction \nand  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  Acceleration  Program  support  the  Government  in \naddressing these constraints over the medium term. \n \nThe  first  and  second  phases  of  the  DPL  helped  the  adoption  of  some  key  regulations \n4. \nrelating  to  decentralization.  DPSP-2  aims  to  address  two  key  binding  constraints.  First,  the \ncontinuing lack of clarity in the regulatory framework for national to local government onlending \nand on-granting arrangements. Second, the need to move towards a market-oriented system of \nsubnational  credit.  Both  are  particularly  important  for  local  and  provincial  government \ninvestments  for  infrastructure.  Borrowing  for  infrastructure  and  other  projects  is  severely \nunderutilized. By 2004, provincial, district, and municipal water enterprise (PDAM) outstanding \ndebt was just 0.18% of GDP. The Government needs to finalize draft revisions to onlending and \non-granting  decrees  to  facilitate  immediate  support  for  local  infrastructure  finance  and  service \ndelivery.  After  that,  the  Government  should  begin  to  establish  a  regulatory  framework  for  the \ndevelopment  of  more  market-based  system  of  subnational  credit,  including  the  issuance  of \nregional bonds (based on Law on Regional Fiscal Balance No. 33/2004). \n \n5. \nTrigger  4.  Clarify  the  Legal  Status  of  Regional  Government-owned  Enterprises \n(BUMDs).  The  private  sector  has  historically  played  a  major  role  in  Indonesia\u2019s  economy, \ngenerating approximately 60\u201370% of GDP in the pre-crisis years.2 With the onset of the financial \ncrisis and the Government\u2019s assumption of much of the country\u2019s productive assets as part of \nthe wholesale restructuring of the banking sector, the share of the private sector is estimated to \nhave  dropped  to  30%  of  GDP  in  2000.  Subsequent  rounds  of  privatization  from  2001  to  2004 \nhave transferred an estimated $39 trillion in assets to the private sector, allowing it to return to \nits pre-crisis GDP contribution. Despite the strong presence of the private sector in the macro-\neconomy, Indonesia\u2019s public sector is one of the largest in the region with over 150 state-owned \nenterprises  (SOEs),  some  of  which  dominate  key  sectors  of  the  economy\u2014most  notably \nbanking, ports, airports, energy, and oil and gas. As of December 2004, the publicly listed SOEs \nin  which  the  government  had  a  controlling  interest  represented  32.5%  of  total  stock  market \ncapitalization.  At  the  subnational  level,  many  other  BUMDs  exist,  including  the  26  regional \ndevelopment  banks,  water  distribution  boards,  and  a  reportedly  large  number  of  new  SOEs \ncreated  by  district  and  regional  governments  to  capture  some  of  the  economic  product \ngenerated  by  their  constituencies.  The  exact  number  of  these  SOEs  is  not  known  but  it  is \nestimated  to  be  close  to  1,000.  Typical  activities  are  those  involved  in  local  trade  where  the \nSOE  is  given  an  exclusive  license  to  provide  a  new  obligatory  service  to  transacting  parties. \nAlthough  Indonesia  has  promoted  competition  in  some  sectors  in  recent  years  and  has \ndecreased  the  privileges  awarded  to  SOEs,  political  opposition  has  effectively  hindered \nattempts  to  privatize  SOEs.  Some  subnational  governments  have  improved  management  and \ntransparency  of  subnational  BUMDs  to  stem  losses  and  prepare  them  for  privatization.  Given \nthe  general  lack  of  a  level  playing  field,  it  is  important  that  the  role  of  SOEs  is  clarified  and \nefforts are made to achieve privatization on a gradual basis. \n \n6. \nTrigger 5. Enactment of Warehouse Receipts Law. Several surveys (see Figure 3 in \nthe  main  text  of  this  report)  have  repeatedly  shown  that  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs) face significant constraints in accessing formal sources of finance to meet their working \ncapital  needs  as  well  as  investment  needs  for  business  expansion.

Indonesia: Private Sector Assessment. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2      39      \n\nassistance  (TA)  study  advised  the  Government  that  a  systematic  approach  is  needed  to \nalleviate regulatory and finance constraints facing SMEs in Indonesia.3 Given the collateralized \nlending,  SMEs  often  have  difficulty  obtaining  competitive  loans  from  banks.  In  particular, \nmovable  property  may  not  be  used  as  collateral,  as  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  loan  loss  reserve  rules \nprevent the use of such assets. As a result, it has been very hard to expand business for many \nof Indonesia\u2019s SMEs, which are often considered the main drivers behind economic growth. The \nADB  TA  noted  that  institutionalizing  a  warehouse  receipts  system  could  support  some  SMEs, \nparticularly those engaged in the agribusiness and trading sectors. \n \n7. \nTrigger  6.  Continue  Implementation  of  the  Financial  Sector  Safety  Net.  In  the \naftermath of the financial crisis in 1997, the Government introduced a blanket guarantee of all \nbank  liabilities  to  restore  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  and  control  bank  runs. \nSubsequently,  as  crisis  resolution  progressed  and  the  banking  sector  strengthened,  the \nGovernment  committed  itself  to  lifting  the  blanket  guarantee  in  a  phased  manner  and \nintroducing  a  deposit  insurance  scheme  that  would  cover  deposits  of  up  to  Rp100  million. \nParliament approved the Law on Deposit Insurance in August 2004, setting out a phased plan to \nreduce  the  coverage  of  the  blanket  guarantee  to  become  effective  from  September  2005, \naccording to the schedule in Table A2. \n \n8. \nThe  main  objectives  of  the  deposit  insurance  scheme  are  to  reduce  the  economic \ndistortions  and  moral  hazard  created  by  the  blanket  guarantee  as  well  as  potentially  to  try  to \nlimit the fiscal costs to the Government in the event of future difficulties in the banking sector. It \nis  also  an  integral  part  of  the  overall  financial  sector  safety  net  being  put  in  place  by  the \nGovernment.  Some  of  the  other  elements  include  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  role  as  a  lender  of  last \nresort  and  establishment  of  institutional  processes  and  mechanisms  by  which  banks  facing \ndifficulties would be either aided by Bank Indonesia or otherwise resolved. \n\nTable A2: Implementation Schedule for the Deposit Insurance Scheme \n\nCurrent Status/Milestone \n\nThe entire amount of deposit was protected \nMaximum Rp5 billion is protected \nMaximum Rp1 billion will be protected \nMaximum Rp100 million will be protected \n\nImplementation Phases \n22 September 2005\u201321 March 2006 \n22 March 2006\u201321 September 2006 \n22 September 2006\u201321 March 2007 \nStarting from 22 March 2007 \nSource:  Law on Deposit Insurance, Government of Indonesia. \n \n9. \nTrigger  7.  Complete  the  Reorganization  of  the  Consolidated  Nonbank  Financial \nInstitutions (NBFIs) Supervisory Agency. Until 2002, the structural reforms to deal with crisis-\nrelated  problems  almost  squarely  focused  on  the  banking  sector.  Recognizing  the  need  for \nfinancial  sector  diversification,  given  the  dominance  of  banks  which  account  for  over  80% \nfinancial  system  assets,  the  Government  adopted  wide-ranging  reforms  to  strengthen  NBFIs. \nThe  thrust  of  the  agenda,  supported  by  ADB  through  the  Financial  Governance  and  Social \nSecurity Reform Program and related TAs, has been to harmonize and improve the regulatory \nframework  of  NBFIs  to  encourage  them  to  diversify  and  create  more  long-term  financing \nmodalities.  In  the  initial  stages,  FGSSR\u2014in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  plans\u2014focused  on \nestablishing  an \nthe  2003 \namendments  to  Bank  Indonesia  Law,  which  stipulated  that  a  fully  integrated  OJK  (one  that \ncombined the supervision of both banks and NBFIs) shall be pursued from 2010, the focus of \nthe Government and ADB has been on establishing a strong NBFI regulator.  \n \n\nfinancial  sector  regulator  (OJK).  Subsequent \n\nintegrated \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n3   Final report for TA 4281-INO (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for the Provincial SME \n\nDevelopment. Manila).  \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nIn  line  with  the  above  approach,  the  minister  of  finance  endorsed  an  action  plan  in \n10. \nDecember  2004  as  part  of  the  FGSSR,  to  strengthen  the  NBFI  sector  and  merge  the  Capital \nMarket Supervisory Agency (BAPEPAM, as the regulator of capital markets) and the Directorate \nGeneral  of  Financial  Institutions  (DGFI)  in  MOF  (regulator  of  pension,  insurance  and  other \nNBFIs). In 2005, a presidential decree merging BAPEPAM and DGFI was adopted. Therefore, \nthere  are  now  two  financial  sector  regulators  in  Indonesia:  Bank  Indonesia  and  Bapepam-LK \n(the combined capital markets and NBFI regulator). \n \nTrigger  8.  Improve  Investment  Climate.  As  part  of  DPL-2/DPSP,  the  Government \n11. \nsubmitted a draft of the new Investment Law to Parliament. Subsequently, the Government has \ntaken  a  range  of  steps.  The  implementing  regulations  for  the  investment  law  are  designed  to \nimprove the investment climate by cutting the time required to start a business; by replacing the \ncurrent uncertain and costly investment approval system with a simpler registration system; and \nby streamlining business licensing by encouraging local one-stop shops. A transparent negative \nlist  will  reduce  the  uncertainty  faced  by  foreign  investors  when  considering  investments  in \nIndonesia and will reduce the need for official discretion (a potential source of corruption). The \nnational team for exports and investment (PEPI) is proposed to have an ombudsman function to \nhelp  investors.  Another  issue  raised  by  the  business  community  and  the  public  relates  to \npayments  on  disputed  amounts  of  tax  assessments.  While  international  practice  varies  on \nwhether tax assessments should be payable pending appeals, a strong argument can be made \nin  Indonesia  for  deferring  the  payment  of  a  tax  assessment  and  suspending  collection \nenforcement  while  a  case  is  under  objection  with  the  Directorate  General  of  Taxation  and \nappealed to the Tax Tribunal. Such a change would be extraordinarily significant. By markedly \nshifting  the  balance  of  power  between  the  tax  administration  and  taxpayers,  the  deferral  of \npayment would make it much more difficult for tax officials to extract bribes and, consequently, \nprovide taxpayers with a greater sense of confidence in the integrity of the tax system. \n \n12. \nTrigger 9. Issue Implementing Regulations for State Treasury and Audit Laws. The \nState Treasury Law (Law No. 1/2004) has set the foundation for modern budget execution and \nreporting.  Following  the  law,  the  Government  has  taken  steps  to  rationalize  the  current \nproliferation of government bank accounts, centralize cash management, simplify and speed up \nthe  payments  system,  and  improve  reporting  on  budget  execution.  Government  financial \nreporting  is  also  being  improved  through  the  implementation  of  government  accounting \nstandards on a modified accrual basis, with an eventual move planned to full accrual accounting \nwhich will be a highly complex undertaking at national and local government levels. The State \nAudit  Law  (Law  No.  15/2004)  lays  out  the  broad  legal  framework  for  the  operation  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  supreme  audit  institution  (BPK)  to  reinforce  its  position  and  mandate  as  an  external \naudit  institution  reporting  to  parliament.  Both  laws  require  detailed  regulations  to  guide  their \nimplementation. While considerable work has already been done to develop regulations for the \nState Finance Law of 2003, the Government has fallen behind in the case of the treasury and \naudit laws, which require more concerted efforts. \n \n13. \nTrigger 10. Continue Implementation of the Treasury Single Account (TSA). DPL-2 \nsupported  the  establishment  of  the  TSA  on  a  pilot  basis.  Effective  management  of  state \nfinances  requires  minimizing  central  government  idle  cash/cash  float,  reducing  maintenance \ncost of too many accounts, facilitating cash forecasting and cash management control, as well \nas enhancing transparency of central government banking. When the TSA is fully implemented, \nthe  regional  treasury  offices  (KPPNs)  will  no  longer  access  Bank  Indonesia.  All  government \naccounts in the country will be centrally financed by the Directorate General (DG) of Treasury, \nwhich will enhance internal controls. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2      41      \n\nTrigger 11. Improve Budgetary Reporting. The 2001 Country Financial Accountability \n14. \nAssessment  (CFAA)  identified  the  need  to  improve  macro-level  budget  reporting,  both  in  its \ncontent and its timing. All budget reporting should be made based on the Government Financial \nStatistics  classification,  which  would  allow  reporting  of  recurrent  and  capital  expenditures  as \nwell  as  financing  of  the  budget.  Budget  reporting  should  also  be  streamlined  by  eliminating \noverlapping  components  of  the  government  accounting  system.  This  would  allow  timely \nreporting of budget expenditures during and at the end of the year. On financial reporting, the \nGovernment  prepared  the  first  ever  aggregated  financial  statement  in  2004  and  prepared  a \nsimilar  set  for  2005  in  a  timely  manner.  This  comprised  a  budget  realization  report,  balance \nsheet, a cash flow statement and notes to accounts. An aggregated set of financial statements \nwas  submitted  to  BPK  at  the  end  of  March 2006  for  audit  of  2005  finances.  This  aggregation \nprocess  is  quite  complex,  involving  aggregation  of  accounts  across  hundreds  of  reporting \nentities. The statements for fiscal year 2005 are also the first ones to be issued after the formal \nadoption  of  the  new  Government  Accounting  Standards  promulgated  in  June  2005.  The \naggregated financial statements for 2005 were prepared based on modified accrual accounting \nstandards.  However,  considering  practical  issues  such  as  capacity  constraints  of  accounting \nstaff in line ministries, the Government has not yet been able to ensure consistent adoption of \nall  the  accounting  and  reporting  principles  laid  down  by  the  Government  Regulation,  and  it \nintends to implement the Government Accounting Standards in stages. While much still needs \nto be done to enhance the reliability of the financial statements, it can be done only on a gradual \nbasis  over  the  medium  to  long  term  given  the  pervasive  capacity  constraints.  Nevertheless, \nsome improvements have been made in enhancing the comprehensiveness of these statements \nfrom the previous year; and the efforts being made by MOF to meet international standards with \nrespect to timeliness, reliability, and disclosure need to be acknowledged. \n \n15. \nTrigger  12.  Operationalize  the  National  Procurement  Policy  Office  (NPPO).  The \nissuance  of  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  promotes  the  basic  principles  of  procurement: \ntransparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and  efficiency.  It  covers  all  areas  of \nprocurement  that  use  public  funds  and  contracting  entities  at  all  levels  of  government.  The \ndecree meets most of what is generally regarded as accepted international practice. However, \nthe  pace  of  Indonesia\u2019s  commendable  decentralization  reforms  has  had  an  impact  on  public \nsector  procurement,  as  different  levels  of  government\u2014from  ministers,  governors,  and  even \nmayors\u2014are  able  to  issue  their  own  decrees,  regulations,  and  instructions.  The  regulations\u2014 \nthemselves  excessive  in  number\u2014are  often  inconsistent,  and  many  do  not  meet  accepted \ninternational  practice.  Consequently,  national  procurement  reforms  and  the  need  for  national \nprocurement policies and standards have become urgent. One key step in this direction is the \ncreation of an NPPO, which the Government had committed to undertaking in 2001. However, \nprogress has lagged in making the NPPO fully operational. \n \n16. \nImprove  Governance.  Poor \ngovernance  in  tax  administration  has  been  a  major  weakness  impeding  investment  climate  in \nIndonesia.  The  Directorate  General  of  Tax  has  been  receiving  assistance  from  donors  on  a \nrange of areas.4 Yet, implementation of reforms has until recently been slow. The pace of reform \nhas now accelerated, and under the newly appointed Director General and a revitalized reform \nteam,  the  Tax  Department  is  proposing  wide-reaching  changes  to  the Tax  Department\u2019s  head \noffice  (an  area  that  had  not  been  previously  part  of  the  reforms).  Under  this  program,  tax \n                                                 \n4   At  the  core  is  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  modernization  strategy  that  comprises,  among  others: \n(i) consolidating  and  upgrading  service  center  functions;  (ii)  segmenting  taxpayers  into  categories  for  appropriate \nmonitoring  and  servicing;  (iii)  simplifying  tax  compliance  procedures;  and  (iv)  improving  governance,  including \ninstituting a code of conduct, a special investigations unit, improvements to the Tax Court, and adoption of a code \nof taxpayers rights. \n\nTrigger  13.

Promoting Governance in Public Administration. Recently, the \n17. \nGovernment  has  begun  to  undertake  a  series  of  initiatives  that  constitute  one  of  the  most \npromising openings for civil service reform in years. A key first step has been the effort to design \na new job classification and remuneration policy for high-ranking state officials [pejabat Negara \n(ministers,  legislators,  judges,  and  heads  of  special  commissions  and  agencies)].  MOF  has \ntaken leadership and set up a task force to examine the entire compensation package with the \ngoal of creating a more transparent, systematic, and coherent framework of pay and allowances \nbased  on  a  comprehensive  job  evaluation  and  pay  grading.  The  task  force  has  proposed  to \nestablish  an  independent  Remuneration  Commission  to  recommend  to  the  President  both  the \nlevel and structure of the compensation package\u2014first for Indonesia's highest ranking political \nofficials  and,  once  firmly  established,  for  the  entire  civil  service.  The  commission  will  also  be \ntasked  with  establishing  greater  consistency  and  transparency  of  the  overall  remuneration \npackage to improve governance. The commission\u2019s recommendations will be based on modern \ntechniques,  such  as  job  evaluations  and  pay  comparator  surveys.  In  addition,  promising  civil \nservice  reform  pilots  are  being  developed  in  MOF,  Ministry  of  Trade,  and  Ministry  of  National \nEducation (which covers 2.7 million teachers out of the total pool of 4.5 million civil servants). \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n43  \n\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER, POLICY MATRIX,  \nAND FORWARD-LOOKING PROGRAM  \n \n\n \n\n \nLetter of Development Policy \n \n\n \nS-207/M.EKON/11/2006 \nS-484/MK.011/2006 \n\nJakarta, Indonesia, November 16, 2006 \n\n \nMr. Paul Wolfowitz \nPresident \nThe World Bank \nWashington, DC, USA \n \nMr. Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank \nManila, Philippines \n \n \nDear Mr. Wolfowitz, Mr. Kuroda: \n \nOn behalf of the Indonesian Government we would like to review the progress during our second \nyear  in  office,  highlight  the  reform  agenda  for  the  year  ahead,  and  request  your  continued \nassistance through another Development Policy Loan. \n \nThis has been a transformative year for Indonesia. The difficult adjustment to last year\u2019s higher \nfuel prices and interest rates is ending with improved macroeconomic stability and accelerating \ngrowth. These policy steps were needed to return confidence and put fiscal-monetary policy on a \nsounder footing, thus providing the basis for sustained GDP growth and poverty alleviation over \nthe long term. Along with the economic adjustment, the past year has seen more natural disasters, \nheightened concerns over avian influenza, and continued vulnerability among a large segment of \nIndonesia\u2019s  people.  Despite  these  challenges,  the  Government  has  pushed  through  its  reform \nprogram with stepped up efforts in priority areas, including the investment climate, the financial \nsector; infrastructure; governance, anti-corruption, and civil service; and service delivery, social \nprotection, and social inclusion through community-driven approaches.   \n \nThe Government\u2019s Strategy \n\nNew initiatives and policy packages in the areas mentioned above aim to complement our broad-\nbased medium-term development plan (or RPJM) \u2013 which seeks to reduce poverty in half, to 8.2 \npercent during the 2004-09 period \u2013 and the Annual Action Plans (RKP), particularly for 2007. \nThese  documents  will  form  the  basis  of  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  and  commitments.  Note  in \nparticular  these  priorities  in  the  2007  (RKP)  include  the  following  nine  areas:  (1)alleviation  of \npoverty  and  disparity;  (2)  enhancement  of  job  opportunities,  investment  and  exports;  (3) \nrevitalization of agriculture and rural investment; (4) enhancement of accessibility and quality of \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\neducation  and  health;  (5)  law  enforcement,  human  rights,  eradication  of  corruption,  and \nbureaucratic  reforms;  (6)  strengthening  defense  capacity,  security  and  order,  and  conflict \nresolution; (7) mitigating and managing natural disasters; (8) infrastructure development and (9) \ndevelopment  of  isolated/border  regions.  Our  efforts  to  achieve  these  short-  to  medium-term \nobjectives  will  succeed,  in  part,  through  continued  support  and  collaboration  from  our \ndevelopment partners, with development policy or program lending representing an important and \nintegral part of this partnership.   \n \nDevelopment Policy Assistance \n\nThis  is  the  third  Development  Policy  Loan  and  we  are  pleased  with  the  partnership  created \nbetween  the  government  and  the  World  Bank,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  the \nJapanese government. We appreciate your support for, and assistance to, the government\u2019s reform \nagenda  in  the  areas  of  (1)  macroeconomic  stability;  (2)  the  investment  climate;  (3)  public \nfinancial  management  and  governance;  and  (4)  public  service  delivery.  We  appreciate  the \nincreased  efficiency  and  focus  that  the  donors  provide  as  a  harmonized  group.  Perhaps  even \nmore, we appreciate your commitment to providing reliable development financing in support of \nprogress on a mutually agreed upon reform agenda. The policy agenda agreed to for DPL 3 has \nbeen proceeding well and we have, or will shortly, meet virtually all the policy actions committed \nto. Our gross financing needs remain large in 2006 and this letter is in support of a request for the \nWorld Bank to approve a program loan of US$600 million and for the Asian Development Bank \nto approve a program loan of US$200 million to disburse in FY2006. \n \nMaintaining Macroeconomic Stability \n\nIn  the  area  of  macroeconomic  stability,  Indonesia  has  had  good  success  over  recent  years.  The \neconomy  appears  to  have  successfully  weathered  the  October  2005  fuel  price  increase,  the \ncurrency volatility that preceded it, and the economic slowdown that followed. GDP growth has \nrebounded in the second-half of 2006. Falling from a strong 6 percent in early-2005 to 5.5-5.7 for \nthe year, growth bottomed out to 4.7 percent in the first quarter of 2006 before climbing to 5.2 \npercent in the second quarter. We now project growth to exceed 6 percent by the fourth quarter of \n2006.  Improved  economic  indicators  have  helped  bolster  consumer  and  market  confidence,  as \nwell  as  improved  market  credit  ratings.  Indonesia\u2019s  credit  ratings  continue  to  improve,  with \nMoody\u2019s  moving  from  B2  to  B1  in  May  and  S&P  from  B+  to  BB-  in  July.  The  stock  market \nreached historic highs and now stands over 30 percent above its level in January this year. Lastly, \ncapital imports, which were weak during the first half of 2006, reached their highest in nine years \nin  August  and  September  2006.  These  indicators,  coupled  with  increased  Government  and \nconsumer  spending,  and  strong  exports,  are  driving  current  economic  growth.  Investments, \nhowever, have shown some decline. With improved macroeconomic fundamentals, we are laying \na stronger foundation for sustained growth over the long term.   \n \nThe  Government  and  monetary  authority  has  been  very  successful  in  controlling  inflation. \nInterest rates are now declining at all maturities and are approaching historical lows at the long \nend of the curve. Year-on-year inflation has fallen from over 17 percent by the end of 2005 to 6.3 \npercent in October 2006, and we expect inflation will end the year well below the low end of the \nCentral Bank\u2019s inflation target range of 7 to 9 percent, setting the stage for further reductions next \nyear. The Government will continue to work with the Central Bank on the medium-term goal of \nbringing  inflation  in  line  with  that  of  neighboring  countries,  as  we  believe  that  this  will  add \nadditional  stability  to  our  exchange  rate  and  reduce  the  current  premium  built  into  Indonesia\u2019s \nreal interest rate, which will further spur investment.   \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n45  \n\nWe  aim  to  continue  allowing  the  exchange  rate  to  float  and  to  reduce  debt  vulnerability  as \nmeasured  by  the  debt  to  GDP  ratio.  The  exchange  rate  has  strengthened  and  stabilized  in  the \n9,100 range, providing increased predictability. We have managed to add to our foreign exchange \nreserves  despite  pre-paying  close  to  US$  8  billion  to  the  IMF.  Our  total  reserves  now  stand  at \nalmost US$45 billion, up from around US$35 billion in October 2005.   \n \nWhile  we  do  not  anticipate  immediate  large  fuel  price  increases,  we  do  intend  to  address  the \nproblem of large untargeted subsides while we improve institutional and policy issues related to \ndebt  management,  improved  macro  and  fiscal  policy  making,  and  intergovernmental  fiscal \nrelations  (including  the  sub-national  borrowing  framework).  Remaining  costly  untargeted  fuel \nand electricity subsidies should fall as the State Owned Electric Company (PLN) increases its use \nof  gas  and  coal  and  new  entrants,  including  international  oil  companies,  expand  their  market \nshare  in  fuel  products  at  market  prices.  International  oil  prices  remain  volatile  and  difficult  to \npredict  but  the  government  remains  committed  to  the  longer-term  goal  of  energy  prices  at \neconomic or market rates to promote efficiency and safeguard our fiscal position.  \n \nGross  borrowing  needs  will  remain  large  in  2006  due  to  the  maturity  structure  of  foreign  and \ndomestic debt obligations. Nevertheless, in terms of spending, our budget situation has improved \nsubstantially. For perhaps the first time since the crisis, we can begin to address long-neglected \npublic  service  delivery  and  infrastructure  needs.  At  current  international  oil  prices,  we  have \nincreased the amount of central government capital spending (from 1.2 percent of GDP in 2005 to \nover  2  percent  in  2006  and  2007)  and  resource  transfers  to  regional  governments  (from  5.3 \npercent  in  2005  to  over  7  percent  of  GDP  in  2006  and  2007).  A  priority  for  this  additional \nspending  is  an  expanded  community-based  poverty  program  and  we  anticipate  that  the  central \nand  regional  governments  will  increase  infrastructure  spending  as  well.  Fortunately  the \ngovernment is able to increase these spending levels while maintaining deficits in the 1 percent of \nGDP range and we expect that the debt to GDP ratio will be below 40 percent by the end of 2006.    \n \nTo help achieve deficit and debt targets, we have pushed to substantially improve the institutional \nframework for improved debt, fiscal, and sub-national policy at the Ministry of Finance. We have \nonce again reorganized the Ministry to better focus on these missions, including the development \nof  required  structures  and  transition  strategies  as  well  as  appointing  officials  to  head  Debt \nManagement,  Fiscal  Policy,  Asset  Management  and  Inter-Regional  Fiscal  Affairs  units \n(Presidential Decree 66/June 2006). We would note that these are areas we indicated would be a \nfocus (under Macroeconomic Stability) in last year\u2019s Letter of Development Policy.  \n \nThe Debt Management Office integrates domestic and external debt, organized along functional \nlines,  i.e.,  a  front,  middle,  and  back  offices.  Work  has  to  deepen  the  2005  formal  debt \nmanagement strategy. Practically speaking this has seen the continued monthly debt auctions, the \nintroduction of retail bonds, the lengthening of the yield cure, buybacks and debt switching for \nbonds coming due in the next few years to smooth the profile, and reduce the share foreign debt. \nHowever,  we  have  also  continued  to  improve  integrated  debt  reporting  risk  management.  For \nexample,  beginning  with  DPL  2,  we  adopted  a  Fixed  Spread  Loan  (FSL)  for  the  first  time, \nallowing  us  to  better  hedge  currency  risk.  We  have  begun  work  to  undertake  a  detailed \nassessment of civil service pension liabilities and other contingent and implicit liabilities but this \narea will be a priority reform in 2007. \n \nOn  fiscal  policy,  we  have  established  a  Fiscal  Policy  Office,  led  by  an  appointed  head,  which \nshould  be  fully  operational  in  2007  as  envisioned  (with  support  programmed  under  the  Bank \nGFMRAP program). It is designed to provide better quality and coordination on macro and fiscal \npolicy issues and it will have units responsible for macroeconomic, revenue (taxes and customs), \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nexpenditure  policies,  and  risk  management.  While  the  FPO  is  not  yet  in  place  it  already  has \naccess to improved data, especially from the tax department. Improved sectoral data give us the \nability  to  more  quickly  and  accurately  assess  the  state  of  the  economy.  This  will  shortly  be \nextended  to  allow  regional  assessments  by  sector  and  to  improve  macro  and  tax  forecasting. \nHowever,  the  primary  focus  of  the  embryonic  Fiscal  Policy  Office  this  year  has  been  on  the \ndevelopment of a Risk Management Unit (RMU) to assess government support, contingent and \nimplicit  liabilities,  most  immediately  (and  with  outside  support)  on  infrastructure  projects.  We \nhave  continued  to  make  progress  on  the  institutional  design  and  capabilities  of  Team  Tariff, \nincluding  the  appointment  of  a  vice-chairman  from  the  Ministry  of  Trade.  Nevertheless,  this \nagenda  has  suffered  from  the  focus  on  institutional  set-up,  and  the  urgency  of  the  Risk \nManagement  Units\u2019  infrastructure  mandate  and  efforts  to  improve  the  functioning  of  the  team \nwill have to remain a priority in 2007. \n \nThe framework for sub-national borrowing has continued to make progress, and again we expect \nthat  policy  coordination  will  accelerate  under  the  new  structure  with  a  Director  General \nresponsible  for  oversight  of  the  critical  issues  in  this  area,  including  among  other  things, \nfunctional assignments, fiscal transfers, and local government revenues. In particular we had been \nconcerned about sub-national borrowing from capital markets (allowed under Law 33/2004) and \nhave  been  working  to  put  in  place  a  framework  designed  to  simultaneously  satisfy  legitimate \nregional  government  needs  (for  example,  large  infrastructure  projects)  while  minimizing \nmacroeconomic risks. This involves both establishing a system for on-lending and on-granting of \ngovernment and donor funds, and a framework for sub-national bond issuance, including work-\nout procedures in the event of default.   \n \nOn-lending, on-granting, and procedures for projects to be financed/funded through on-lending or \non-granting are now essentially in place (i.e. through the Blue Book at Bappenas) and completed \n(PMK Nos 52 and 53/2006 and PerMen PPN No. 5/2006). The Ministerial Decree on the issuance \nof  regional  bonds  is  almost  complete  while  the  framework  for  work-out  procedures  for  Local \nWater Utilities (PDAMs) have been revised and finalized (PP 14/05 and PMK no 107/2005) and \nwe  are  now  beginning  work  on  the  Ministerial  decree  on  work  out  procedures  for  local \ngovernments  (Pemda),  required  for  local  State  Owned  Enterprises  such  as  Water  Utilities  to \nborrow.  We  would  also  note  that  the  Law  on  Local  Government  State-Owned  Enterprises \ndesigned to clarify the status of these companies with respect to their regional governments will \nbe  submitted  to  Parliament  the  end  of  this  year.  The  imminent  completion  of  this  framework \nshould allow regional governments to begin to access additional donor and market finance, and \naddress  Millennium  Development  Goals,  especially  water,  which  is  a  priority  service  delivery \ngoal for 2007. \n \nMoving forward, after discussions with your staff, we propose to transition away from including \nspecific  macroeconomic  policy  measures  in  the  reform  package  supported  by  the  development \npolicy program. This does not in any way reflect a reduced emphasis on macroeconomic stability, \nwhich  will  remain  a  centerpiece  of  the  government\u2019s  strategy.  Rather,  the  key  macroeconomic \nitems  that  had  fallen  under  the  \u201cmacroeconomic  pillar,\u201d  e.g.,  fiscal  policy  institutions,  will  be \naddressed in the investment, public financial management, and public service pillars. This would \nprovide greater focus in the overall program. \n \n\nInvestment Climate \n\nWhile restoring macroeconomic stability is a prerequisite for economic growth, sustaining high \ngrowth  rates  in  the  longer  term  requires  increased  private  investment  and  a  substantial \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n47  \n\nimprovement in infrastructure. These are areas that suffered from neglect in the past and are the \nfocus of three reform packages and other initiatives. The reform packages address infrastructure, \ninvestment  (including  the  regulatory  framework,  taxes,  customs  and  labor),  and  the  financial \nsector,  with  a  package  on  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SME)  financing  under  development. \nEach  package  lays  out  goals,  specific  actions,  timelines  and  responsibilities.  Reforms  in  these \nareas are progressing well and we expect to see tangible results for investors. \n \nImproving  infrastructure  is  among  our  highest  priorities.  Under  the  third  Development  Policy \nLoan  we  have  focused  on  support  for  the  development  of  public  private  partnerships,  a  risk \nmanagement  unit  (with  an  infrastructure  focus)  and  the  budgetary  commitment  of  resources  to \ncontingent  liabilities.  These  areas  progressed  well  including  through  the  issuance  of  Perpres \n67/2005  and  PMK  38/2006  and  the  setting  up,  the  operationalization  of  the  RMU  and  a \ndirectorate  of  Investment  to  provide  government  support  for  private  infrastructure.  However, \nwhile we continue to prioritize the provision of infrastructure as an investment climate issue and \nan  important  item  in  its  own  right,  rather  than  detail  our  strategy  and  commitment  here,  in \nagreement with your team, we leave this area to other documents and forums.  \n \n As we indicated, the new investment law is under discussion in Parliament and while we can not \ndetermine the exact timing of its passage we believe that Parliament understands the importance \nof this legislation as a signal to investors. We are simultaneously preparing critical implementing \ndecrees  for  the  law,  including  an  improved  negative  list,  a  shift  from  approval  to  registration, \nestablishing local one-stop investment centers, and providing fiscal incentives. These decrees are \nnearing completion and will be ready when the investment law is passed. We were pleased that \nbusiness start-up time as measured in the World Bank\u2019s most recent Doing Business report fell \nfrom 151 to 97 days this year. Passage of the new investment law and its accompanying decrees \nwill  further  strengthen  this  trend.  However,  an  ambitious  program  to  streamline  and  simplify \nbusiness licensing, together with measures to eliminate unnecessary steps in the establishment of \nlimited companies, will be needed to reach our goal of cutting start-up time to just 30 days. \n \nProgress  has  been  achieved  in  implementing  the  investment  climate  reform  package  that  was \nannounced in early March 2006. A new team has been established to review regional regulations \nharmful  to  business  activity  and  has  recommended  cancellation  of  130  such  regulations,  85  of \nwhich have already been cancelled. A decree mandating the establishment of one-stop investment \ncenters  by  local  governments  has  been  issued,  and  drawing  on  the  experience  of  advanced \nlocalities  it  is  expected  that  these  \u201cone-stop  shops\u201d  will  greatly  accelerate  business  licensing. \nProcedures  for  approving  the  employment  of  expatriate  manpower  have  been  simplified.  The \nnumber of companies granted fast track \u201cgold card\u201d customs clearance status has been increased \nfrom 71 to 91 with an additional 15 companies under review. Risk assessments have been carried \nout for 517 importers as part of a planned shift from broad based physical inspection of imports to \nmore narrowly targeted inspections. And a decree on fiscal incentives has been approved at the \nministerial level and sent to the Ministry of Justice for finalization. Nevertheless there has been \nsome  slippage  from  the  time  targets  established  in  the  investment  climate  policy  package, \nparticularly  with  respect  to  labor  regulations,  revision  of  the  draft  tax  laws,  simplification  of \nbusiness licensing and the use of the red lane at customs. \n \nLast  year\u2019s  commitment  to  a  new  trade  law  was  premature.  Rather  than  push  ahead  with  an \nomnibus law on domestic and foreign trade we focused on the passage of a  law on Warehouse \nReceipts  that  will  provide  additional  collateral  especially  important  to  small  businesses.  Next \nyear\u2019s trade priorities include several things. First, we need to come back to the overall setting of \ntrade policy as the pace of negotiations on bilateral and regional trade agreements is very rapid \nand increasingly includes service sectors and an increased focus on non-tariff barriers. Indonesia \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nwill  need  improved  coordination  across  these  areas  if  we  are  to  make  the  best  of  arising \nopportunities. We need a roadmap on trade policy making and coordination to do this. However, \nin  the  short-term  we  also  need  to  push  ahead  with  the  modernization  and  upgrading  of  Tariff \nsetting  which  will  inevitably  be  a  key  component  of  any  trade  policy  system  and  an  area  of \npriority this year. Another trade priority is the creation of a National Single Window (which will \ninclude an electronic Single Administrative Document and paperless clearance) in line with our \ncommitment to our partners in ASEAN. \n \nThe proposed revisions to the tax laws designed to improve the balance between tax payers and \ntax  officials  represents  perhaps  the  key  investment  climate  reform  developed  in  2006. \nUnfortunately, for procedural reasons, we were not able to submit revisions to the draft tax law \nalready  in  Parliament,  but  we  have  agreed  with  key  political  parties  to  have  them  submit  these \nkey revisions as their own. We will, of course, make a strong case for including these revisions, \nand both domestic and foreign chambers of commerce will be pushing for the changes. There are \nnumerous revisions to these laws, including, for example, the establishment of a single corporate \ntax rate and a phased reduction in the top rate from 30 to 25 percent. One of the most important \nchanges  will  allow  taxpayers  to  pay  their  own  assessment  of  taxes  owed,  in  line  with  the  self-\nassessment  principle,  rather  than  the  tax  official\u2019s  assessment  as  is  currently  the  case.  If  the \ntaxpayer underestimates their liability they will be responsible for interest and penalties but this \nrevision  should  provide  significantly  better  balance  between  taxpayers  and  officials.  These \nrevisions to the tax laws are complex and while we would like them to be completed by the end \nof  2006,  in  order  to  take  effect  in  2007,  the  precise  timing  of  Parliamentary  action  cannot  be \npredicted with certainty. Thus we propose to continue to improve service to taxpayers as part of \nthe expansion of modern tax offices to medium and smaller firms, to focus on improving services \nto taxpayers through a regulation(s) that provide clarity on the basis of the tax department\u2019s tax \ncalculation when it differs from the taxpayers and to focus on improving and simplifying VAT \nrefund procedures in line with recently passed DG tax regulation No.122/2006.    \n \nOne of the major disappointments in the last two years has been the slow growth in employment. \nDespite economic growth in the mid 5 percent range, unemployment has risen and formal sector \nemployment  stagnated.  The  investment  climate  policy  package  proposed  that  there  should  be \nrevisions to the Labor law to address constraints to increased hiring. Based on the report by the \nUniversity  Consortium  we  no  longer  intend  to  address  these  issues  through  a  revised  labor  law \nbut we will find other approaches designed to address critical issues, including the high costs of \nseverance  (and  inequity  of  severance  pay  under  conditions  of  dismissal  for  cause),  the  lack  of \nclarity on outsourcing and on the consequences of illegal strikes. \n \nIn line with economic recovery we need improved performance from the financial sector. In 2006 \nthis  agenda  advanced  with  the  continued  reduction  in  the  banking  sector  guarantee  (to \nRp. 1 billion in September), the formal reorganization of Bappepam and DGFI, the development \nof the financial sector package with a strong focus on Non-Bank Financial Institutions including \ninsurance, pensions and leasing and a Presidential decree on the establishment of an infrastructure \nfund  that  should  be  issued  shortly.  In  2007  we  propose  to  continue  to  focus  on  improving  the \nstability  of  the  financial  sector  by  operationalizing  the  Financial  Stability  Forum,  finishing  the \nwithdrawal  of  the  blanket  guarantee,  implementing  good  corporate  governance  and  improving \nrisk management standards in the banking system. To accelerate the development of the NBFIs \nwe  propose  to  move  ahead  on:  resolving  weak  insurance  firms;  assessing  the  extent  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  pension  liabilities;  and  improving  the  ability  to  participate  in  infrastructure \nfinance. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n49  \n\nFinally,  we  would  like  to  increase  the  emphasis  on  the  development  of  small  and  medium \nenterprises by developing and implementing a SME financing package that includes such things \nas  access  to  credit  (through  improvements  in  credit  reporting)  and  the  implementation  of  the \nWarehouse Receipts Law. \n \nFiduciary and governance reforms \n\nThis year we propose to continue our focus on public financial management reforms but in line \nwith the adjustments in DPL 3, we are broadening the agenda to include anti-corruption and civil \nservice  measures  designed  to  complement  the  emphasis  on  improved  budgeting,  financial \nmanagement and procurement. We particularly intend to work closely with Bank Indonesia, the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  the  Executive  Audit  Agency  (BPKP),  and  internal  audit  agencies  of  the \nGovernment  and  the  Supreme  Audit  Board  (BPK),  and  to  complete  the  few  outstanding \ngovernment regulations for the State Treasury and Audit Laws. Now that much of the regulatory \nframework is falling into place, our focus will move to implementation of the changes. \n \nIn  2006  the  budget  was  prepared  far  earlier  in  the  year  and  Ministries  and  Agencies  are  now \nbetter  acquainted  with  the  revised  systems.  Budget  disbursement  improved  in  2006  relative  to \n2005, but back loading of expenditures and procurement continues to be a problem. We are now \ncommitted to reporting budget outcomes regularly and the first semester of 2006 is now available \non  the  Ministry  of  Finance  website.  We  are  also  continuing  to  work  to  improve  the  quality  of \nbudgets  and  budget  outcomes,  and  we  will  be  introducing  a  Medium  Term  Expenditure \nFramework (MTEF) and performance based budgeting in 2008. The new framework will present \nmulti-year  macroeconomic  and  forward  program  estimates  that  should  enhance  planning  and \nassessments  and  reduce  the  back-loading  of  spending.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning \nMinistry are now working the revisions to budget and program structures required to deliver these \noutcomes in 2008.  \n \nIn addition, we propose to continue to improve treasury management by expanding the Treasury \nSingle Account (TSA) to both revenue and expenditure beyond the 50 treasury offices established \nin 2006. With the underlying Cash Management Regulation to be completed shortly, we would \nlike to extend the TSA to at least 50 percent of government cash operations, inventory and close \nunauthorized  bank  accounts,  and  develop  regulations  in  consultation  with  Bank  Indonesia  to \nprevent  the  opening  of  other  such  accounts  in  the  future.  We  also  propose  to  address  the  long-\nterm accounting issues surrounding the subsidiary loan agreements in the Regional Development \nAccount  (RDA)  and  Investment  Funds  Account  (RDI),  and  bring  them  into  compliance  with \nGovernment accounting and compliance standards. \n \nImprovements to public procurement designed to improve processes and outcomes continue to be \na high priority. A National Public Procurement Office (NPPO) at Bappenas will be functioning at \nthe Echelon One level by next year when the Planning Ministry\u2019s reorganization is complete. We \nbelieve  that  the  staffing  and  expertise  implicit  in  an  Echelon  One  level  entity  will  be  able  to \naccelerate our procurement reform agenda. As we noted above, procurement has been a problem \nthis  year  as  the  bureaucracy  has  adjusted  to  new,  more  stringent  procedures.  Improved \nprocurement  will  increase  resources  available  for  government  investment  and  public  services \nthrough increased competition and reduced corruption. But this will require the expansion of on-\ngoing  training  and  certification  of  procurement  officials,  as  well  as  the  extension  of  e-\nprocurement  and  the  use  of  standard  bidding  documents.  With  the  NPPO  in  place  and  e-\nprocurement  efforts  proceeding,  we  would  like  to  move  ahead  with  the  development  of  a  new \nprocurement law to strengthen the legal footing of Keppres 80/2003. \n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nThe BPK \u2013 Indonesia\u2019s Supreme Audit Board -- now has a stronger mandate to conduct external \naudit independently across government, and the new Audit Law (15/2004) strengthens the role of \nBPK and clarifies its role across all three levels of government. However, we acknowledge that \nthere  is  room  to  further  clarify  the  mandates  of  the  three  internal  audit  institutions  to  remove \noverlaps and rationalize the allocation of resources between them, and between the internal and \nexternal audit institutions so that synergies between these institutions can be fully realized. \n \nLast  year  we  discussed  programs  to  reduce  corruption  and  improve  governance  as  well  as  to \nadvance civil service reform. We are pleased that reform momentum in these important areas has \nbeen such that we have moved them into the development policy framework this year. The fight \nagainst corruption remains one of our top priorities. The Anti-Corruption Commission continues \nto function well and existing agencies like the Supreme Audit Board, the Financial Transaction \nand  Analysis  Center,  and  the  Attorney  General\u2019s  office  are  increasingly  active,  pursuing  the \nprosecution of high profile graft cases. Our efforts to control corruption should be aided through \nimproved  legal  support  for  witnesses  and  whistle  blowers  under  the  Witness  Protection  Law \npassed earlier this year.  \n \nAs we noted earlier, civil service reform has become a critical priority. Sustained implementation \nof the kinds of reforms we have in mind and improved service delivery will require a civil service \nresponsive  to  incentives,  especially  performance  and  merit-based  practices.  Given  the  size  and \ndiversity  of  the  civil  service,  this  agenda  will  clearly  take  time,  but  it  is  important  that  we  get \nstarted. The creation of a remuneration commission for the highest level of the civil service  will \nrepresent a solid first step toward sorting out existing compensation practices and job descriptions \nwith  the  goal  of  a  more  systematic,  transparent  and  coherent  framework.  This  will  have  to  be \nextended to the civil service as a whole, but we are not waiting for this to take place and a number \nof ministries are experimenting with institutional and compensation practices designed to create \nislands of excellence. We are pushing ahead with civil service pilots at the Ministry of Finance. \nFor  example,  at  the  Ministry  of  Finance  we  are  creating  an  office  to  support  the  Minister\u2019s \noversight of ongoing reforms.   \n \nImproved Delivery of Public Service  \n\nA  focus  on  improved  public  service  delivery  was  introduced  last  year  in  response  to  the \nreallocation of public spending from fuel subsidies to pro-poor compensation programs and our \ncommitment  to  achieve  RPJM  and  MDG  goals  in  2009  and  2015,  respectively.  Given  the \ncontinuing priority on improving public services, we propose to extend the policy commitments \nincluded  in  this  area  this  year.  The  detailed  assessments  of  the  effectiveness  of  compensation \nprograms  in  education,  health,  rural  infrastructure,  and  cash  transfers  have  proven  to  be  very \nuseful and we propose to institutionalize these assessments. \n \nThe key government program initiative in 2007 involves the scaling up of existing Community \nDriven Development programs to create a national program. However, these programs operate in \na  different  fashion  than  more  typical  Government  programs  with  communities  drawing  down \nfunding tranches over time and employing either their own labor or contractors, depending on the \nchosen activity. These differences will need to be accommodated in the national program design \nand we are committed to allowing all CDD programs (not just donor-funded ones) to carry over \nunspent funds into the subsequent year and to employ simplified procurement more suitable for \nthe local level. These measures should ensure a smoother scale-up of these programs in 2007 and \nbeyond. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n51  \n\nIn  addition,  we  remain  committed  to  expanding  access  to  clean  water  and  local  government \nservices that had previously been included under the macroeconomic stability pillar. As we noted \nwe have just about completed the framework for both on-lending and on-granting of Government \nand donor funds, with the framework for local government borrowing also nearing completion. In \n2006, we should see the beginning of the process of local governments and water utilities clearing \nup past arrears and accessing finance through these mechanisms. \n \nFinally,  we  would  like  to  improve  the  Indonesian  education  system.  This  is  an  area  where  we \nhave  been  rapidly  increasing  our  spending  but  we  now  ned  to  ensure  that  quality  is  also \nimproved. To do this we propose focusing on upgrading teachers, the largest element of the civil \nservice, by establishing competency standards and monitoring teacher certification as developed \nby a National Standards Board. \n \nThe  increase  in  fuel  prices  vastly  strengthened  our  fiscal  position  in  2005  and  2006  while \nproviding us greater resources needed to improve services to the Indonesian people, especially the \npoor.  As  noted  last  year,  we  put  in  place  programs  designed  to  compensate  the  poor  through \nsupport for education, health and rural infrastructure, and a programs would be sufficient to keep \npoverty from rising but the combination of the adjustment and a steep increase in domestic rice \nprices  pushed  up  poverty  by  almost  2  percent.  This  is  not  an  acceptable  outcome  and  the \nGovernment  is  committed  to  pushing  ahead  more  aggressively  with  our  anti-poverty  agenda. \nThus  the  President  introduced  the  National  Community  Empowerment  Program  (PNPM)  in  his \nAugust  17th  speech.  The  PNPM  provides  for  a  step-by-step  expansion  of  donor  supported  anti-\npoverty program to all the villages and urban neighborhoods in Indonesia by 2009. We appreciate \nyour  support for  these  programs  and  look  forward  to  continuing to  work  with  you  on  this very \nimportant  initiative.  In  addition,  we  will  be  piloting  conditional  cash  transfers  that  will  provide \nincentives for poor households to lift themselves permanently out of poverty. \n \nConclusion \nOnce  again  we  remain  committed  to  a  reform  agenda  focused  on  macroeconomic  stability,  the \ninvestment  climate,  improving  public  finances  and  governance,  and  improved  public  spending. \nThe areas raised have been highlighted in our RPJM, annual action plans for 2006 and 2007, and \nthe  recent  policy  packages  on  infrastructure,  investment  and  the  financial  sector.  We  anticipate \nthat  successful  reforms  will  deliver  continued  growth,  employment,  and  poverty  reduction,  and \nwe look forward to working with the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and Japanese \nGovernment to achieve our objectives in these areas. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n2\n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\nDPSP-2 Policy Measures \n\nStatus as at Loan Negotiations (16 November 2006) \n\nTable A3.1: Policy Matrix for the Second Development Policy Support Program \n \n\nCore Policy Area I: Macroeconomic Stability and Creditworthiness \n1.

The Directorate General (DG) Treasury at present has the ability to generate flash reports on budget \ndisbursements and revenue receipt transactions conducted through KPPNs and the State Treasury.  \nFulfilled. KPPN level reporting has become regular and systematic, and by functional and economic \nclassification.  \nFulfilled. Reporting until recently has been ad hoc. DG Treasury has launched a new website with a \ndesignated page for public reporting of periodic budget disbursements starting with the 2006 first semester \nreports. \n\nFulfilled. Annual consolidated financial reports have now been presented consecutively for 2004 and 2005 to \nParliament, and considerable improvements have been made over time in the reporting process as well as final \nstatements submitted. \n\nFulfilled. The Government financial statements are publicly available. The Supreme Audit Institution has \nreviewed both 2004 and 2005 statements and given audit opinions, which have been widely disseminated in \nmedia. \nFulfilled. Based on the mechanisms and procedures for the preparation of budget realization reports as \noutlined in MOF Decree No.59/2005, delays have been reduced in the aggregation of the transactions reported \nto KPPN and reconciliation of these with the accounting and project records maintained at the satkers (line \nministry work units) through the DG Treasury\u2019s Regional Offices. In the past, such differences were significant, \neven between units/agencies within MOF. In early 2006, a new system was set up whereby the consolidated \nand regional reports are reconciled on a monthly basis at the KPPN level and quarterly basis at provincial \nlevels.  \nOn Track (To be monitored under DPSP-3/DPL4: Trigger No. 7). The Presidential Decree on Public \nProcurement (Keppres No.80/2003) required that the NPPO be established by 1 January 2005. This process \nbeen delayed, and now the draft decree on NPPO is pending approval by the Minister for State Apparatus, as \nthe decree proposes significant institutional reorganization within BAPPENAS. The Government has indicated \nthat there are no disagreements on the establishment of the NPPO as an Echelon 1 unit and that the Office \nshould be in place within BAPPENAS shortly. In parallel, pending the establishment of the Office, other reforms \nhave been initiated that go beyond NPPO: a centralized training and procurement practitioners\u2019 certification \nsystem is being developed, and a computerized testing system has been designed to certify public procurement \nofficials at the basic level.  \n\nNote: This trigger was not originally included in the DPSP documentation submitted to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors \nin December 2005. It has subsequently been introduced based on strong commitment from MOF to carry \nforward reforms in this important area. \nFulfilled. In contrast to the previous system focused on the type of tax, the Directorate General of Tax has \nadopted a new structure for its headquarters designed to refocus on key functions including risk management, \ninternal controls, monitoring tax officials\u2019 code of conduct, change management, research and outreach. This \nproposal has also received final approval from the President, as it deviates from standard civil service \nprocedures.  \nFulfilled. The Directorate General of Tax has been receiving assistance from Australian Agency for \nInternational Development (AusAID), International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to design and implement \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\n5\n5\n\n\fDPSP-2 Policy Measures \n\nStatus as at Loan Negotiations (16 November 2006) \n\n \n\n \n\n13.3 Develop a new governance unit to \nmonitor and communicate the code of \nconduct \n\n13.4 Improve the operation of headquarters \nby using more sophisticated information \ntechnology \n\n14.

Public Service Delivery.   \n16.1 Monitor effectiveness and undertake \nindependent operational assessment, \nincluding fiduciary aspects of the new \ncompensation programs funded by \nreallocated fuel subsidy funds (e.g. cash \ntransfer, health, education, and village \ninfrastructure) \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n6\n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\na modernization strategy that aims at consolidating and upgrading service center functions; segmenting \ntaxpayers into categories for appropriate monitoring and servicing; simplifying tax compliance procedures; \nimproving governance, including instituting a code of conduct; establishing a special investigations unit; \nimproving the functioning of the Tax Court; and adopting a code of taxpayers\u2019 rights. The Tax Department will \nbe fully re-engineered under this program to incorporate 2-3 large taxpayers offices, 12-15 medium taxpayers \noffices, and small taxpayer offices that are accessible countrywide to make the new modernized system \nsuccessful. A separate unit is functional to coordinate the change management. \n\nFulfilled. The design for a new governance unit has been developed to help implement the above strategy. \n\nFulfilled. With the appointment of a new Director General in early 2006, the head office has been significantly \nstrengthened to coordinate all modernization initiatives, including aspects related to information technology. \nThe large and medium-tax payers\u2019 offices are networked to the headquarters. The World Bank\u2019s Government \nFinancial Management and Revenue Administration Project will provide subsequent assistance for the \ninfrastructure for modernization.  \nFulfilled. The Law was passed by Parliament in June 2006 and it has been subsequently enacted through \nPresidential approval. \n\n \nFulfilled. The first step taken by the Government has been to launch the design of a new job-classification and \nremuneration policy for high-ranking officials (ministers, legislators, judges, and heads of special commissions \nand agencies). MOF has set up a task force to examine the entire compensation package with the goal of \ncreating a more transparent, systematic and coherent framework of pay and allowances based on a \ncomprehensive job evaluation and grading of remuneration. A job-evaluation exercise has been launched, with \nthe training of a team of job evaluators. In parallel, promising civil service reform pilots are being developed in \nMOF, Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of National Education (which covers 2.7 million teachers, who are \ncounted in the pool of 4.5 million civil servants) tracking what is being done for the high-ranking officials. \nFulfilled. The task force has recommended the establishment of an independent remuneration commission. \nThe commission will recommend to the President both the level and structure of the compensation package first \nfor Indonesia\u2019s highest ranking officials, and once firmly established, for the entire civil service. The proposal \nhas recently been approved by Parliament. The Commission will also be tasked with establishing greater \nconsistency and transparency of the overall remuneration package to improve governance. A draft regulation \non the Commission has been submitted to the State Secretariat. A Presidential Decree authorizing its \nestablishment is expected in November 2006. \n\nFulfilled. A rapid assessment of the unconditional cash transfer (UCT) was undertaken in December 2005 in \n15 districts/municipalities in 10 provinces by two research institutes. Subsequently, between March and June \n2006, qualitative assessments of the education, health and village infrastructure subprograms under the post-\nfuel subsidy compensation programs were undertaken. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 57 \n\nDPSP-2 Policy Measures \n\n16.2 Use evaluation findings to improve \nfuture compensations schemes. \n\nStatus as at Loan Negotiations (16 November 2006) \nFulfilled. The findings of the UCT assessment were used by BAPPENAS to improve the disbursements of the \nthree successive tranches, including: (i) changes to the registry of beneficiaries, to ensure that the targeting \nwas sound; (ii) improved payment procedures; (iii) improved complaint resolution mechanisms; and (iv) \nimproved public awareness. The assessment findings of the post-fuel subsidy compensation programs were \ndisseminated to the line ministries in mid-2006 as inputs to the Government\u2019s planning and budgeting process \nfor 2007 budget. Feedback from the line ministries and BAPPENAS indicate that these findings have been used \neffectively in improving the welfare programs as well as their implementation. The findings of the UCT scheme \nassessment are also likely to provide points for designing the proposed Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) pilot, \nfor which the Government has demonstrated clear ownership and commitment.  \n\na. The World Bank\u2019s Development Policy Loan-3 policy matrix also includes two measures on infrastructure development, relating to making the risk management   \nand public-private partnership frameworks operational and allocation of adequate resources in the 2006 and 2007 budgets for infrastructure risk sharing purposes. \nThese  measures  are  not  reflected  in  ADB\u2019s  proposal  as  they  are  covered  in  depth  in  the  ADB-supported  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program, \napproved by ADB on 21 November 2006. \n \nAusAID  =  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development;  BAPPENAS  =  National  Development  Planning  Agency;  BAPEPAM-LK  =  Capital  Markets  and  Non-\nBank Financial Institution Supervisory Agency; BUMD = regional government owned enterprises; CCT = Conditional Cash Transfer; DGFI = (former) Directorate \nGeneral of Financial Institutions; DPSP = Development Policy Support Program; KPPN = Local State Treasury Service Offices; MOF = Ministry of Finance; NPPO \n= National Procurement Policy Office; and UCT = Unconditional Cash Transfer. \n \nSource: ADB staff \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\n5\n7\n\n\fTable A3.2: Indicative Triggers for the Third Phase of the  \nDevelopment Policy Support Program \n(To provide parallel cofinancing for the fourth Development Policy Loan to be coordinated by the World Bank) \n\nObjective \n\nTriggers/Outputs \n\n1.

Following  the  significant  hike  in \ninterest rates and fuel price increases in the fall of 2005, real GDP growth slowed to under 5 percent in \nthe last quarter of 2005 and first quarter of 2006 (y/y). However, growth picked up to 5.2 percent (y/y) in \nthe  second  quarter,  mainly  reflecting  strong  external  demand  and  some  acceleration  in  public \nconsumption.  Though  still  weak,  private  consumption  appears  to  be  picking  up,  indicating  that  the \nadjustment  to  the  domestic  fuel  price  hike  last  fall  is  nearly  complete.  Nevertheless,  unemployment  is \nedging up and poverty rates remain high. Growth is expected to pick up gradually over the course of 2006 \nand in 2007, with IMF staff projecting annual growth to reach 5.2 percent and 6 percent, respectively, as \ninterest rates are reduced. Nevertheless, there are risks to this outlook, most importantly a weakening of \nthe international environment and slow implementation of structural reforms.  \n\nInflationary  pressures  have  been  declining.  Headline  inflation  declined  to  14.6  percent  (y/y)  in \nSeptember, from 17.1 percent at end-2005, reflecting weak activity and some appreciation of the rupiah. \nMeanwhile,  three-month  annualized  inflation  (both  headline  and  core)  has  remained  below  6  percent \nsince the beginning of the year. On current trends, Bank Indonesia\u2019s (BI\u2019s) end-year target of 7\u20139 percent \nfor headline inflation is well within reach.  \n\nThe  overall  banking  sector  continues  to  perform  reasonably  well.  Partly  due  to  reclassification, \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) increased substantially in 2005, especially at the two largest state banks, but \nthe rise in NPLs moderated in January\u2013June 2006. The sharp deceleration in credit growth in 2006, as a \nresult of high interest rates and weak demand, will to some extent undermine bank profitability, but the \nexpected reduction in interest rates should prevent excessive adverse effects on banks. Capital adequacy \nratios remain at over 20 percent. \n\nExternal vulnerabilities continue to be reduced. The current account is expected to remain in surplus in \n2006. Foreign exchange reserves, at about $39 billion after the repayment of remaining debt to the Fund \nof $3\u00bc billion on October 12, are equivalent to about 130 percent of short-term debt. The current account \nis expected to move into small deficit over the medium term as imports rise faster than exports, financed \nin large part by private sector capital inflows. The ratio of external debt to GDP is expected to be reduced \nto below 25 percent of GDP in 2011, from 48 percent of GDP in 2005. Nevertheless, the market volatility \nexperienced in May/June 2006 is a reminder that Indonesia remains susceptible to adverse developments \nin international capital markets. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nMacroeconomic and Structural Policies \n\nThe budgeted policy stance is broadly appropriate. The fiscal deficit targets of 1.3 percent of GDP for \n2006 and 0.9 percent of GDP for 2007, as outlined in the President\u2019s budget speech in mid-August, are \nappropriately geared to further reducing the debt burden, to below 30 percent in 2010 (compared with 47 \npercent at end 2005), while supporting activity in 2006. After considerable under spending in 2005 and \nthe first quarter of 2006, budget execution improved in the second quarter of 2006. \n\nMonetary policy continues to be geared to reducing inflation. BI\u2019s gradual approach to reducing its \npolicy rate has helped contain inflationary pressures and increase foreign exchange reserves. There should \nbe  room  for  further  gradual  rate  cuts  given  the  benign  inflation  outlook  and  still  large  differential  with \nU.S.  interest  rates,  though  the  authorities  need  to  be  careful  that  excessive  rate  decreases  do  not \nundermine  their  credibility  and  prospects  for  achieving  the  2007  inflation  target  of  5\u20137  percent.  The \nclarity  and  consistency  of  statements  by  BI  officials  in  signaling  the  central  bank\u2019s  policy  intentions, \nwithin the inflation targeting framework, has improved and is essential to maintaining credibility.  \n\nSteps  are  being  taken  to  deal  with  NPLs  at  state  banks.  The  recently  signed  Presidential  decree \nallowing state banks to provide haircuts on loans, together with stepped-up efforts to enforce collections, \nshould help to resolve the NPL problem, and avoid erosion of bank capital. IMF staff continue to advise \nthat medium-term strategies be adopted for the state banks, which should involve privatizing those that do \nnot have a clear public policy objective. As regards private banks, supervisors will need to remain vigilant \nto enforce regulations, and to monitor any deterioration in credit quality.  \n\nThe government is proceeding on a broad range of fiscal reforms. Adoption of the tax package now \nbefore Parliament, along the lines endorsed by the business community, as well as modernization of the \ntax  department,  will  help  enhance  revenue  collection  while  restoring  investor  confidence.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  intention  to  better  manage  potential  risks  stemming  from  the  operations  of  public \nenterprises and private-public partnerships is welcome. \n\nTo  improve  the  business  climate  and  boost  growth,  the  government  has  prepared  an  impressive \nreform  agenda.  Given  the  business  community\u2019s  concerns  about  implementation,  some  major  early \nreform  successes  are  needed  to  increase  confidence  that  the  entire  package  will  be  implemented.  The \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to secure early approval of customs, investment, and tax laws are welcome, which \napart from the signaling effect would also bring immediate benefits for trade and investment. \n\nFund  staff  recognizes  the  difficulties  of  amending  labor  legislation.  Staff  supports  the  authorities\u2019 \nintention to press ahead with the introduction of regulations that ensure a balanced framework for labor-\nbusiness relations. The new regulations need to protect the rights of workers, while enhancing flexibility \nfor business, in particular with regard to severance pay and outsourcing requirements. More flexible labor \nmarkets  will  help  Indonesia  become  more  competitive  vis-\u00e0-vis  neighboring  countries  and  should \nencourage employers to make hiring decisions more freely. \n\nStatus of IMF Relations \n \n\n\u2022 \n\nIndonesia\u2019s Extended Arrangement with the Fund expired in December 2003. It was  followed by \na  close  policy  dialogue  with  the  authorities  through  post-program  monitoring  (PPM)  (until  the \nrecent repayment of all obligations to the Fund) and extensive technical assistance activities.  \n\n\u2022  The 2006 Article IV consultation and fifth PPM were completed on July 31. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix  4     61      \n\n\u2022  The next Fund mission is scheduled for early December, and technical assistance missions from \nthe Fiscal Affairs Department and the Monetary and Capital Markets Department will be in the \nfield during November. \n\n\u2022  The  Fund  welcomes  Indonesia's  early  repayment  of  its  obligations  to  the  Fund.  This  is  a \nreflection  of  the  strength  of  the  economy  and  especially,  its  balance  of  payments  position.  The \nFund expects to continue a constructive dialogue with the Indonesian authorities through regular \nstaff  visits,  technical  assistance  missions,  and  in  the  context  of  the  annual  Article  IV \nconsultations, the next of which is scheduled for mid-2007. \n\n \n\n\fCore Policy Areas in \nthe Development \nPolicy Support \nProgram  \nI.

Studies undertaken internally within the World Bank include a \nreview  of  the  progress  made  in  implementing  the  second  DPL  approved  in  year  2005  (in  collaboration \nwith  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Japan),  the  results  of  a  supervision  mission  to  assess  progress  in \nimplementing the World Bank-financed Government Financial Management and Revenue Administration \nProject  (GFMRAP)  that  became  effective  in  October  2005,  a  review  of  the  developments  in  the  audit \nsector and the findings of a Public Expenditure Review completed this year. Other key inputs include the \nimplementation  reports  on  the  ongoing  State  Audit  Reform  Program  and  Project  \u2013  being  implemented \nwith  ADB  support  -  and  a  recent  report  by  IMF  on  Observance  of  Standards  and  Codes  on  Fiscal \nTransparency.  These  provide  the  analytical  underpinnings  for  PFM  and  fiduciary  assessments  for  this \noperation. \n\nThe  reform  agenda  is  clearly  being  led  by  the  Government,  with  support  from  several  donor  agencies, \nand has consistently received good support under the current Government that has been in office for two \nyears. Deficiencies in Indonesia\u2019s PFM systems have been well documented in recent years and a reform \nprogram to address these was formulated by the Government in their White Paper on PFM reforms that \nwas prepared in 2002. This reform program included, amongst others, the following main areas: \n\n\u2022  Modernizing  an  outdated  legal  environment  for  PFM,  by  issuing  a  modern  set  of  laws  and \n\nimplementing regulations; \n\n\u2022  Reforming  an  opaque  and  inefficient  budget  formulation  process,  by  discontinuing  the  separate \nrecurrent  and  development  budgets,  and  introducing  performance  budgeting  systems  and \nforward estimates; \n\n\u2022  Reforming  budget  implementation,  in  particular  the  inefficient  payments  system  and  weak \n\nmonitoring arrangements; \n\n\u2022  Modernizing  management  of  the  Government  Treasury,  to  consolidate  fragmented  cash \n\nmanagement and make government banking arrangements more efficient; \n\n\u2022 \n\nIntroducing modern Government Accounting Standards and accounting practices to improve the \nreliability of Government financial reporting; \n\n\u2022  Reforming  arrangements  for  government  auditing,  in  particular  strengthening  the  mandate  and \ncapacity of Supreme Audit Institution (BPK), addressing overlaps between external and internal \naudit agencies and clarifying their respective roles and responsibilities. \n\n \nSome  specific  aspects  of  reforms  have  been  supported  under  the  series  of  Development  Policy  Loans \nover the last three years. A commentary on the progress in implementing these reforms is given below to \nhelp determine the attendant risks arising from the borrower\u2019s capacity to receive and manage this loan \nand  help  determine  the  fiduciary  arrangements  for  this  operation.  A  summary  of  the  specific \nrecommendations made under the last CFAA and their current status is also attached. \n \nCURRENT STATUS OF PFM REFORM \u2013 A SUMMARY \n \nThe more notable achievements accomplished and shortcomings are summarized below. \n\nA. Regulatory Framework for PFM \n \nSubstantial progress has been made in establishing the regulatory framework for improved PFM \nby  the  issue  and  development  of  appropriate  implementing  regulations  under  the  troika  of  laws \nthat  were  passed  by  Parliament  during  2003  and  2004,  and  the  other  complementary  laws  on \nPlanning and Procurement that were passed during the same period.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7      69 \n\nThe  Law  on  State  Finances  (No.  17/  2003),  although  at  a  high  level  of  generality,  underpins  the \nreform of the Government budgeting process and is currently under implementation. It provides for \nthe  first  time  for  such  basic  budget  processes  as  developing  a  macro-economic  and  fiscal  framework, \nestablishing a budget timetable, setting out the budget information to be supplied to Parliament and the \nuse of internationally recognized classification standards (GFS) in developing the budget. Reforms being \nundertaken in the budget formulation area include the unification of the previous two separate budgets, \nthe  development  of  an  MTEF  system  and  the  introduction  of  performance  based  budgeting.  A \ncomplementary piece of legislation has also been passed, viz., the State Development Planning System \nLaw  (2004),  which  provides  the  legal  basis  for  the  national  development  planning  process,  and  for  the \nlinking of planning with budgeting. \n\n \n\nThe  State  Treasury  Law  (No.  1/  2004)  provides  the  basis  for  modernizing  budget  execution  and \nreporting.  Treasury  reforms  being  undertaken  include  steps  to  rationalize  the  current  proliferation  of \ngovernment  bank  accounts  and  to  centralize  cash  management,  simplify  and  speed  up  the  payments \nsystem,  and  to  improve  reporting  on  budget  execution.  Government  financial  reporting  will  also  be \nimproved through the implementation of government accounting standards on a modified accrual basis, \nwith an eventual move to full accrual accounting.  \n \nThe  State  Audit  Law  (No.  15  /  2004)  lays  out  the  broad  legal  framework for  the  operation  on  the \ncountry\u2019s  supreme  audit  institution,  BPK,1  to  reinforce  its  position  and  mandate  as  an  external \naudit institution equal to but reporting to Parliament. While the audit law takes the important step of \nestablishing BPK as the only external auditor and the Supreme Audit Institution in the country, the Law \ndoes  not  adequately  resolve  some  remaining  conflicts  arising  from  BPK\u2019s  role  nor  does  it  remove \nrestrictions on its scope as articulated in some older legislation, for example with respect to BPK\u2019s access \nto  records  of  Tax  Revenues  department.  In  addition,  the  State  Audit  Law  did  not  cover  the  institutional \narrangements  for  the  management  and  oversight  of  BPK,  for  which  a  separate  law  (BPK  Law)  -  was \nenacted on 16 October 2006 (Law No.15/06). \n \nProcurement  Presidential  Decree  (80/2003)  introduces  many  improvements  in  the  procurement \nregime  in  Indonesia  and  lays  out  a  plan  for  establishing  a  national  policy  formulation  and  oversight \nagency.  An  omnibus  procurement  law  is  envisaged  for  consolidating,  clarifying  and  simplifying  the \nnumerous  procurement  rules  and  regulations.  This  law,  currently  under  preparation,  would  further \nstrengthen the legal foundation for modernizing public procurement.  \n \nAn analysis of the recent PFM laws and their implementing regulations indicates that substantial \nprogress  has  been  made  in  preparing  and  issuing  the  required  implementing  regulations, \nalthough  some  draft  regulations  are  pending  formal  release  as  of  the  date  of  this  analysis.  In \nIndonesia, given the traditionally high level of generality in legislation, laws usually require one or more \nGovernment  Regulations  to  define  and  govern  their  implementation  followed  by  Decrees  from  the \nPresident  and  or  Ministers  to  establish  the  systems  and  procedures  necessary  for  their  operation.  The \nState Finances Law, Treasury Law and the State Audit Law are no exception.  \n \nAll  the  main  implementing  regulations  for  the  State  Finance  Law  have  been  issued,  with  the \nexception  of  a  detailed  manual  on  implementing  the  national  budget  (Article  14),  for  which  a  draft  has \nbeen  prepared  and  is  being  finalized.  The  issued  regulations  include  Government  regulations  on \nGovernment  Work  Plan,  National  Government  Departments  Annual  Plan  and  Budget  Deficit.  A  set  of \nMinisterial Decrees have also been issued to regulate Regional Borrowings and Adjustment Funds. \n \nWith respect to the State Treasury Law, a number of Government Regulations have been issued to \nregulate aspects of budget execution and others are at an advanced stage of preparation. These \ninclude  specific  financial  management  provisions  for  designated  General  Public  Service  Agencies \n(23/2005),  promulgation  of  Government  Accounting  Standards  (24/2005),  write-off  of  State  receivables \n(14/2005),  State  Asset  Management  (6/2006)  and  Finance  and  Performance  Reporting  (8/2006).  In \naddition,  Ministerial  decrees  have  been  issued  on  aspects  such  as  management  of  inter-governmental \n                                                 \n1 Badan Permeriksa Keuangan \n\n \n\n\f70   \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\ndebt  and  draft  regulations  are  at  an  advanced  stage  of  preparation  or  approval,  including  cash \nmanagement,  internal  controls  and  Budget  Implementation,  which  are  awaiting  issue  pending  the \nresolution of some institutional issues within the Government.  \n \nThe Government Regulation on Government Internal Controls Systems (Pengendalian Inter Pemerintah) \nis expected to cover the objective, scope, and responsibility of internal control systems, including the role \nof internal audit agencies. However, there remains disagreement within the Government over the scope \nand  content of  some  parts  of  the  regulation,  in  particular  the  implications  for  the  future  of  internal  audit \nagencies involved in exercising internal controls. The issue of this regulation is pending resolution of this \nmatter.  \n \nA  new  regulation  on  Cash  Management  has  similarly  been  drafted  and  is  considered  a  key  step  in \nunderpinning  the  proposed  Treasury  Single  Account.  The  full  implementation of  this  will  involve  shifting \nlarge cash surpluses of the Government from commercial banks, where these are currently placed free of \ncharge, to the central bank in a zero-balance arrangement. An agreement has not yet been reached with \nthe  central  bank  on  the  extent  and  manner  of  compensation  to  the  government  for  these  balances, \npending which the draft regulation has not been issued. \n \nA  new  Government  Regulation  on  Budget  Implementation  (Pelaksanaan  Anggaran)  currently  being \ndrafted  will  underpin  new  budget  implementation  procedures.  Many  of  the  procedures  proposed  in  this \ndraft regulation are already being applied, under cover of interim circulars issued by the Director General \nTreasury to help test out and develop the detailed procedures. \n\n \nFor the State Audit Law (15/2004) no implementing legislation has yet been issued. Seven separate \nactions are required to implement Law 15/04; namely, four implementing regulations, a concept Manual, \nand two Memoranda of Understanding to implement articles 14 and 17 (7). The four regulations comprise \nexternal auditing standards (in fulfillment of Article 5 (2), out-sourcing of experts to BPK (in fulfillment of \nArticle 9 (3), issue of audit summons (in fulfillment of Articles 11 and 10.d), and guidance on settlement of \nlosses  to  the  State  (in  fulfillment  of  Article  22  (4).  The  concept  Manual  on  Investigative  Audit  is  in \nfulfillment of Article 13. The two memoranda of understanding relate to guidance on submission of fraud \nin audit findings (Article 14), and; guidance on submission of audit reports to the legislative body (Article \n17)  For  many  of  these,  in  particular  the  more  important  ones  on  auditing  standards  and  issue  of  audit \nreports  to  Parliament,  drafts  are  ready  and  under  discussion  with  members  of  the  Executive  (e.g.  the \nAccounting and Auditing Standards Committee) and the Parliament. These regulations will be issued by \nthe  BPK  Board,  not  by  the  Government,  and  the  enabling  legal  provisions  for  this  authority  are  now \nincluded in the recently-enacted BPK Law referred to above. \n \nIn conclusion, the regulatory framework to enable and guide the implementation of PFM reforms \nis  now  substantially  in  place,  and  the  year  ahead  will  see  the  focus  shift  more  clearly  to \nimplementation, where the challenges will no doubt be substantial. \n \nB. Early Experience in Implementing Reforms \n \nThe Government has recognized early some key challenges in moving beyond the development of \nappropriate laws and regulations to their effective implementation. As an integral part of the change \nmanagement  process,  the  Government  reorganized  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  This  was  accomplished \nreasonably well during 2005, in particular by creating a new DG Budget and Fiscal Balance and a new \nDG Treasury, broadly in line with earlier IMF recommendations. Both the budget and treasury functions \nhave been strengthened by these changes. In particular DG Treasury now oversees all treasury functions \nincluding cash and debt management, fixed asset management and government fiscal reporting.  \n \nMost  recently  in  October  2006,  the  Minister  of  Finance  has  sought  to  further  strengthen  and \nsynergize  the  management  of  reforms,  by  setting  up  an  office  for  Policy  Analysis  and \nHarmonization  reporting  directly  to  her.  It  is  anticipated  that  this  office  will  help  expedite  and \ncoordinate the completion of the reform agenda. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7      71 \n\n \nBudgeting Reforms \n \nNew  measures  that  have  been  introduced  through  the  new  State  Finance  Law  are  gradually \nimproving  fiscal  transparency.  Budget  documents \nfor  2005  and  2006  have  become  more \ncomprehensive and informative. These improvements include (i) the new economic and fiscal framework \n(ii)  clearer  expenditure  classification,  including  the  integration  of  routine  and  development  budgets,  and \npresentation of budgets consistent with the GFS 2001. \n\nPlanning  and  budgeting  functions  have  also  been  clarified,  although  more  needs  to  be  done  to \nimprove qualitative aspects and improve coordination between Bappenas and Ministry of Finance. \nPlanning  and  budgeting  have  been  integrated  by  formally  linking  line  ministry  work  plans  with  budgets. \nThe respective roles of BAPPENAS and MOF in budget preparation have been clarified, with BAPPENAS \nassuming full responsibility for the planning process (including preparation of the work plans) and MOF \nhaving the leading role in the formulation of the annual budget. However, early experience suggests that \nthere is a need to further strengthen cross agency coordination between BAPPENAS, MOF and the line \nministries  to  facilitate  the  move  to  performance  based  budgeting  process.  Improvements  include  the \ntimely  submission  of  budgets  to  Parliament  within  the  budget  cycle,  although  there  are  persistent \nconcerns about the quality of performance budgets submitted by Line Ministries. The implementation of \nthe  MTEF  has  not  been  very  effective  to  date  and  will  require  more  intensive  training  and  wider \ndissemination of the concept. \n \nSome specific implementation experience during 2005 and 2006 is highlighted below: \n \na. A new functional and program classification consistent with the IMF GFSM 2001 for cash based \ntransactions has been implemented. Budget allocations have begun to be based on sector strategies and \nprograms rather than historical expenditures. However the program classification requires further review \nto ensure it adequately reflects the objectives of or the program management approach used by individual \nspending ministries.  \n \nb.  The  earlier  model  of  separate  recurrent  and  development  budgets  have  now  been  formally \nunified, with components from the former development budget reclassified to the appropriate economic \ncategories.  However,  unification  of  the  underlying  substance  of  these  two  groups  may  not  be  entirely \nconsistent in all agencies. \n \nc. Progress in implementing MTEF has been limited. Forward estimates have been introduced for the \nfirst time, although much more work needs to be done to fully adopt the MTEF approach. The Work Plan \nregulations provide for indicative budget ceilings to be issued for two years out but in the 2006 budgets \nindicative ceilings have been issued only for the forthcoming budget year.  \n \nd. There has been limited progress in developing a more performance oriented budget. Although a \nstart was made with the fiscal 2005 budget, full implementation will take more time as there appears to be \nlimited  understanding  and  no  clear  strategy  yet  developed  to  operationalize  this  concept.  Spending \nministries do not appear to fully understand the objectives of the new work plans and budget documents \nand  so  far  these  appear  to  have  been  an  extensive  paper  exercise  with  little  discernible  impact  on \nresource  allocation.  Strong  collaboration  between  DG  Budget  and  Bappenas  is  needed,  ensuring  that \nthey act collaboratively and consistently and that planning is fully integrated into the budget as envisaged \nunder performance budgeting.  \n \ne.  Severe  delays  were  experienced  in  issuing  budget  authorization  documents  (DIPA)  in  2005, \nalthough significant improvements were made in 2006. In the past years, these documents were often \nmade available to line agencies not until after April of the running year. As a result, a high proportion of \nthe  total  funding  provided  under  the  approved  budget  to  spending  agencies  could  not  be  executed  or \ndisbursed until the last quarter of the fiscal year. Often virtually no such commitments or disbursements \ncould  occur  in  the  first  two  quarters  other  than  purely  routine  expenditure  (such  as  salaries  of  civil \nservants). \n\n \n\n\f72   \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\n \nAmong  the  main  reasons  for  this  delay  during  2005  was  the  inadequate  understanding  of  the \nnewly  introduced  budgeting  procedures  among  a  large  number  of  spending  agencies  in  the \nGovernment.  It appears that Line Agencies had not been adequately trained in these. These budgeting \nchanges  introduced  a  whole  new  way  of  preparing  budget  estimates,  performance  based  budgets  and \nunderlying work plans, and these often had to undergo several revisions before being accepted, leading \nto significant delays. In addition, current procedures require that spending patterns are set centrally and \nmid-year adjustments are often difficult. Allowing for more flexibility in this process without putting in place \nother safeguards will speed up spending but may increase the risk of excess waste.  \n \nFor  the  budget  year  2006,  the  DIPA  issue  process  seemed  to  have  stabilized.  These  documents \nwere  issued  for  all  spending  agencies  in  January  2006  and  the  disbursement  position  is  better  than \nbefore,  although  spending  patterns  have  still  not  improved  dramatically,  with  aggregate  government \nspending  as  of  September  2006  standing  at  62%  of  the  budgeted  funds.  A  related  constraint  that \ncontinues  to  affect  expenditure  patterns  is  the  absence  of  authorization  to  carry-over  of  unspent \ncommitments at year-ends, given the one-year life of all DIPAs. Although a one-time waiver for this was \nauthorized  in  2005,  this  needs  to  be  regularized  for  all  development  expenditure  so  that  this  can  be \ndistributed more evenly through the year. \n \nTreasury Management Reforms \n \nThe  implementation  experience  with  Budget  execution  processes  is  less  satisfactory,  with  a \ngradual modernization at Ministry of Finance and very little impact on the control environments at \nspending agencies. Some highlights are discussed below: \n \na. \nIntroduction of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) and automation of the treasury payments \nsystem are key reforms and progress in pilot testing of the underlying concepts has been slow. \nAlthough  a  detailed  work  plan  for  this  was  developed  in  2005,  especially  for  the  establishment  of  the \nTreasury  Single  Account  (TSA)  which  involves  the  progressive  rationalization  of  the  vast  number  of \nseparate  government  bank  accounts.  Supporting  the  management  of  state  finance  resources  requires \nminimizing  central  government  idle  cash/cash  float,  reducing  maintenance  cost  of  too  many  accounts, \nfacilitating  cash  forecasting  and  cash  management  control,  as  well  as  enhancing  transparency  and \naccountability of central government banking.   \n\nPilots for zero balance transitory accounts have been completed in three locations: Jakarta, Bekasi \nand  Batam  since  2005.  Expansion  and  roll-out  of  the  pilot  are  on  hold  due  to  delays  in  passage  and \nissuance  of  Government  Regulation  on  Cash  Management  (see  above).  A  committee  has  been \nestablished  within  DG  Treasury  to  seek  quotations  from  commercial  banks  for  remuneration  of \ntransactional  banking  services  (TBS).  An  extension  of  this  pilot  to  an  additional  50  KPPNs  has \ncommenced effective Sept. 1, 2006. Gradual implementation of TSA (expenditure and revenue accounts) \nin all KPPNs is proposed for mid-2007 in a phased manner. \n\nIn the meanwhile, the proliferation of unauthorized and unaccounted bank accounts continues. A \nrecent audit by BPK has discovered  Government bank accounts at 63 banks which are in the personal \nname  of  a  Government  official,  a  project  or  a  Badan  (unincorporated  body  or  agency).  Many  of  these \nwere  not  earlier  known  to  the  Treasury.  These  include  680  current  accounts  and  623  term  deposit \naccounts. Total balances in these accounts amount to a sizable Rp8.5 trillion. The Ministry of Finance has \nso far not been successful in inventorizing all such accounts that exist and bring them into accountability \nand control.  \n \nAs  part  of  improving  cash  management  there  is  a  need  to  reduce  delays  in  revenue  remittances  into \ngovernment bank accounts, which sometimes can be up to a few months. For instance, balances in the \nservices  clearing  account  in  2005  from  the  Reforestation  Account  were  not  deposited  in  the  State \nTreasury for a few months. Treasury cash management and payment modernization will be supported by \nthe  planned  computerized  treasury  information  management  system  (SPAN)  under  the  World  Bank \nGFMRAP project.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7      73 \n\n \nb. Some parts of the MOF (Directorate of Treasury) organization has been rationalized to support \nrationalization of the treasury system. Regional accounting offices (KAR) and local verification offices \n(KASIPA)  have  been  merged  with  regional  administrative  offices  (KANWIL)  under  DG  Treasury,  with \ntreasury  payment  and  accounting  field  offices  (KPPNs)  coming  under  KANWILs.  While  there  has  been \ntraining  for  MOF  staff  this  has  not  yet  extended  to  staff  in  the  Spending  Ministries,  who  thus  lack \nawareness of the proposed changes. This is likely to severely constrain effective implementation of on-\ngoing  reforms  at  the  centre.  Further  complementary  ongoing  reengineering  of  business  processes  is \nneeded to introduce internal checks and balances, and diminish the potential for rent-seeking that hitherto \ncharacterized virtually all stages of budget formulation and execution in Indonesia. \n \nc.  The  procurement  of  a  new  treasury  system  (SPAN)  to  be  funded  by  the  World  Bank  under \nGFMRAP  is  delayed.  The  new  treasury  management  system  is  intended  to  improve  accounting  and \nreporting for treasury transactions, increase transparency in budget formulation and budget execution and \nreduce transaction costs.  \n \nd.  The  development  and  adoption  of  new  Government  Accounting  Standards  is  a  good  step \nforward  to  improve  financial  reporting,  though  the  requirement  of  the  State  Treasury  law  of  the \ncomplete introduction of accrual accounting by 2008 is very ambitious and may not be realistic. \nThe  Accounting  Standards  Committee (KSAP)  has  been  in  operation for  a  few years  now  during  which \ntime they have put in place a due process for development of Government accounting standards that are \nwell aligned with comparable international standards (IPSA\u2019s). An initial set of 11 government accounting \nstandards  have  been  formally  adopted  through  the  issue  of  a  Government  Regulation  (No.  25/2005). \nThese standards are on a modified accrual basis, and the intention is to move to full accrual standards by \n2008.  \n \nEffective  2006,  these  accounting  standards  are  now  already  applicable  across  government  and  each \nministry and agency is expected prepare a financial accountability statement based on these standards. \nDouble entry accounting has now been introduced in all Ministries, and standalone accounting packages \nhave  been  installed  at  line  ministries  in  a  modular  fashion  \u2013  SPM  for  Budget  execution  and  SAI  for \naccounting  and  reporting.  Implementing  these  new  standards  across  government  however  is  a  major \nchallenge  and  will  require  extensive  training  as  well  as  some  re-engineering  of  related  business \nprocesses  in  line  ministries  and  agencies.  This  task  will  impose  challenges,  given  inherently  weak \ncapacities in Ministries.   \n \ne. In the area of fiscal reporting, progress has been made by the Ministry of Finance in the timely \npreparation  of  aggregate  financial  statements,  including  a  Balance  Sheet,  Budget  Realization \nreport and Cash Flow Statement. Government prepared an aggregate set of financial statements for the \nyear 2004 for the first time. This exercise was repeated for fiscal 2005, and aggregate financial statement \nwere handed over to BPK end-March 2006 for audit, well within mandatory time targets. This aggregation \nprocess  is  a  complex  one,  involving  consolidation  of  over  19,000  budget  reporting  units  from  1000 \nreporting  entities,  and  this  is  a  commendable  achievement.  Improvements  have  also  been  made  in  the \ncomprehensive disclosures made in these financial statements on the accounting policies and details on \nrevenues, expenditures, assets and liabilities. \n \nThe  DG  Treasury  now  has  the  ability  to  generate  flash  reports  on  budget  disbursements  (LRA) \nand  revenue  receipts  transactions  conducted  through  the  local  State  Treasury  Service  Offices \n(KPPN)  and  the  State  Treasury,  though  there  appears  to  be  a  reluctance  at  MOF  to  publicly \ndisclose such (unaudited and unreconciled) data.  Mechanisms and procedures for the preparation of \nBudget Realization Reports (LRA) are outlined in PerMen Keu 59/2005. Delays have been reduced in the \naggregation of KPPN transactions and reconciliation of these with ministry work unit (satker) records by \nthe DG Regional Offices (Kanwil DJPBN). In the past, such differences have been significant, including \ndifferences  with  some  agencies  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance  such  as  Tax  and  Customs  &  Excise \nDirectorates.  In  preparing  the  Financial  Statements  for  FY  2005  such  differences  continue  to  be \nsignificant, although early in FY 2006 some new processes have been introduced to allow reconciliation \n\n \n\n\f74   \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nbetween  treasury  offices  and  line  agencies  on  a  monthly  basis  at  KPPN  level  and  quarterly  basis  at \nprovincial / Kanwil level. The relevant instructions and operating manuals to guide this process have been \nissued as Circular Letters (SE) by Ministry of Finance.   \n\nEfforts have been made to integrate nominal LRA reporting with budget ceilings as formalized through the \nBudget  Activity  Lists  (DIPA)  to  enable  reporting  of  expenditure  as  a  percentage  of  allocated  budget \nresources.  Although  LRAs2  based  on  new  classification  structures  can  be  generated  with  ease,  the \nperiodic publishing of such reports \u2013 for internal and external purposes - has yet to be institutionalized. \nRather, reporting is ad-hoc and limited to aggregate (central government wide) figures. DG Treasury has \nlaunched a new website in 2006 with a designated page for public reporting of periodic LRA. However, to \ndate LRA has not been posted on the site. \n\nPending  the  introduction  of  a  Treasury  Single  Account,  some  positive  interim  measures  have \nbeen  taken  during  2006  to  improve  accountability  of  dispersed  Government  bank  accounts.  To \nhelp enforce greater reliability of the bank balance figures at the year-end and to identify cases of major \ndifferences between reported and actual bank balances, MOF has instituted a procedure to obtain from \nall  Treasury  offices  (KPPN)  copies  of  the  year-end  bank  statements  of  the  operational  bank  accounts \nunder their management.   \n \nDespite  the  good  initial  taken  there  continue  to  be  serious  shortcomings  in  the  reliability  of \ngovernment  financial  statements,  reflecting  the  immense  challenges  that  lie  ahead  in  an \nenvironment  where  accounting  capacities  at  the  grassroots  are  weak  and  the  accounting \nprocesses not yet integrated or fully automated. Some of the major issues in reliability that have been \nraised by the external auditors in the audited 2005 financial statements include the following: \n \n\n1) Significant differences between revenues as reported respectively by KPPN and the Tax Office. To \nresolve  this  MOF  has  recently  designed  a  new  comprehensive  web-based  Revenue  Management \nInformation System. \n \n2)  The  Balance  Sheet  of  the  central government  for the  year 2005  has  reported  a  balance of  Rp  60 \nTrillion  as  Long  Term  Non  permanent  Investment  (RDI)  and  District  Development  Fund  (RPD).  This \ncomprises  government  receivables  from  BUMN3,  BUMD  and  regional  governments  from  Foreign \nLoans (SLA) loans from RDI and loans from RPD. Although the year-end balance has been recorded \nin the aggregate Balance Sheet, transactions during the year, such as authorization and drawdown of \nnew  loans,  loans  recovered  and  financing  charges  paid  or  earned,  are  not  recorded  in  the  financial \nstatements.  In addition, procedures for authorization of movements from these funds during the year \nare not clear. This has reduced the level of transparency in and accountability for these funds. \n\n3) Procedures for recording, valuing and reporting procedure for Fixed Asset as State assets were not \nin accordance with the accounting system. Management of fixed assets in Ministries and Institutions is \nnot yet in accordance with regulations and laws. \n \n4) The value of permanent investments in State Owned Enterprises (BUMN) which is presented in the \n2005  Balance  Sheet  were  not  based  on  valid  accounting  principles  and  contained  some  significant \nomissions.  All  holdings  in  SOE\u2019s  were  valued  on  the  basis  of  net  equity,  using  the  latest  available \naccounts. Despite the fact that nearly all holdings in BUMN are 100% no attempt is made to prepare \nconsolidated accounts for government and its subsidiaries. \n\n \nAudit Issues \n \nThe  BPK  \u2013  the  country\u2019s  supreme  audit  institution  -  now  has  a  stronger  mandate  though  the \nstaffing  and  resources  provided  to  it  do  not  fully  correspond  to  its  new  mandate.  The  new  Audit \nLaw (15/2004) strengthens the role of BPK and clarifies its role across all three levels of government and \n\n                                                 \n2 Laporan Realisasi Anggaran or Budget Realization Reports \n3 State Owned Enterprises \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7      75 \n\nhas considerably expanded the scope of its audit. However, military institutions are currently not subject \nto  audit.  Existing  regulations  also  place  some  limitations  on  the  ability  of  BPK  to  audit  all  revenue \nagencies  such  as  the  tax  department.  As  a  result,  for  the  year  2005  BPK  was  not  able  to  audit  tax \nrevenues and tax receivables, which account for about 70% of total public revenues. In comparison to the \nresources  provided  to  internal  audit  institutions,  BPK  has  a  physical  presence  in  only  9  or  the  26 \nprovinces  of  the  countries,  whereas  the  central  internal  audit  agency  (BPKP)  has  an  (under-utilized) \npresence  in  each  of  these  26  provinces.  As  a  result,  BPK  is  able  to  cover  less  than  60%  of  the  local \ngovernments in its annual work program. \n \nThe BPK submits summary reports of audits undertaken to parliament annually and half yearly. In \naddition, BPK presents audited accounts of municipalities and regions to parliament. These reports certify \nthe financial statements of the audited reporting entities, and in addition comment on any irregularities or \ninefficiencies in budget execution that may have been noted. Public disclosure of all BPK audit reports is \nnow mandatory \n \nInternal audit and Controls \n \nThe mandates of the three internal audit institutions continue to be unclear as is the allocation of \nresources  between  them.  Internal  audit  is  within the  remit  of  the  BPKP,  the  Inspector  General  (IG) of \neach  ministry,  and  the  Bawasdas  of  municipalities  and  regional  governments.  Ironically,  even  with  (or \nperhaps because of) multiple internal audit agencies in existence, the internal audit function continues to \nbe a chronically weak link in governance. \n \nAt present the BPKP\u2019s mandate is unclear. It can assist IGs, municipalities and regions upon invitation, \nit  provides  training  in  auditing  for  these  entities.  Although  its  mandate  has  reduced  significantly,  it \nmaintains  fully  staffed  decentralized  offices  in  some  26  provinces  in  the  country.  A  key  regulation  on \ninternal controls under the State Audit Law (Law No.15/2004) \u2013 being supported by ADB as part of the \nSTAR  Program  \u2013  deals  with  addressing  the  inconsistencies.  It  is  expected  to  clarify  the  roles  and \nresponsibility of BPKP versus the other internal control organs of the Government. In the meantime, the \nenactment  of  the  Law  on  the  Supreme  Audit  Institution  Law  (BPK  Law  No.15/2006)  \u2013  passed  by \nParliament  on  30  October  2006  \u2013  has  given  the  much  needed  boost  to  clarify  BPK\u2019s  position  and \nauthority. \n \nThe  IGs  have  different  roles  in  different  ministries.  Their  actual  mandate,  staffing  and  activities  are \ndetermined  by  the  minister  in  charge  of  the  ministry  in  which  they  operate.  The  IGs  are  therefore  not \noperating  as  one  institution,  but  rather  as  20  institutions  corresponding  to  the  number  of  ministries  and \nministers.  Generally  they  focus  on  routine  technical  and  performance  audits  (including  compliance  with \ntechnical standards) conducted on a random basis or in accordance with an approved annual audit plan, \nbut  not  on  a  risk  based  methodology.  Reports  are  not  available  to  the  public  or  the  DPR.  Professional \nbackgrounds of staff IG therefore normally include technical qualifications and not accounting or auditing. \n \nThe  audit  of  financial  transactions  in  the  35  provinces,  442  districts  and  2  regencies  are \nundertaken  in  a  very  complex  institutional  set  up.  The  BPK  is  the  external  auditor  of  all  local \ngovernments. In each district and province a Bawasda is established to undertake what they call \u2018general\u2019 \naudit  of  regional  budget  expenditure.  However,  Bawasda\u2019s  generally  do  not  have  the  skills  of  staff  to \nundertake all audit responsibilities.  \n \nThe allocation of resources between the internal audit institutions is unclear and there does not \nseem  to  be  strong  cooperation  and  coordination  between  them.  This  hampers  the  realization  of \nsynergies between the institutions. The audit of local governments in particularly lacks transparency and \nis needlessly complex. \n  \nInternal  control  mechanisms  across  government  need  strengthening.  These  comprise  all  rules, \nprocedures and business processes that are applied in the execution of the budget, to ensure that public \nfunds are safeguarded from waste, inefficiency and fraud and comply with approved laws, regulations and \npolicies. A key internal control in public expenditure management is the Expenditure Control and Payment \n\n \n\n\f76   \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nSystem. In order to strengthen the responsibility and accountability over the appropriated budget by the \nline ministry, recent budget execution regulations have transferred the function of payment order issuance \nto  the  line  ministries,  resulting  in  a  better  segregation  of  functions  of  verifying  transactions  and  issuing \npayments.  While  this  segregation  of  duties  is  well  designed,  implementation  experience  is  not  entirely \nsatisfactory. One endemic weakness that has been noted in accounting practices has been the quality of \naccounting evidence that is accepted for payments by the Treasury as well as Line Agency financial staff. \n \nProcurement Policy \n\nThe  issuance  of  Presidential  Decree  (80/2003)  promotes  the  basic  principles  of  procurement: \ntransparency, open and fair competition, economy, and efficiency. It covers all areas of procurement that \nuse public funds and contracting entities at all levels of government. The decree meets most of what is \ngenerally  regarded  as  accepted  international  practice.  However,  the  pace  of  Indonesia\u2019s  commendable \ndecentralization  reforms  has  had  an  impact  on  public  sector  procurement  as  different  levels  of \ngovernment  \u2013  from  ministers,  governors,  and  even  mayors  \u2013  are  able  to  issue  their  own  decrees, \nregulations, and instructions. The plethora of regulations is often inconsistent with one another and many \ndo  not  meet  accepted  international  practice.  As  a  consequence,  national  procurement  reforms  and  the \nneed for national procurement policies and standards have become urgent. One key step in this direction \nis the creation of a National Public Procurement Office (NPPO), which the Government had committed to \nundertaking  in  2001.  However,  progress  has  lagged  in  making  the  NPPO  fully  operational.  The \nPresidential Decree 80/2003 required that the NPPO be established by January 1, 2005. A lot of work has \nalready  been  done  and  is  on-going,  in  both  preparing  for  the  establishment  of  the  NPPO  and  also  in \ndeveloping institutional capacity.   \n\nThis  measure  however  remains  a  contentious  issue  and  the  Minister  of  Finance  has  stated  that \nmany other aspects of the procurement framework could be improved beyond the specific issue \nof  the  NPPO.  For  example,  a  centralized  training  and  procurement  practitioner\u2019s  certification  system  is \nunder development with certification at various levels. The system has commenced targeting government \nprocurement  practitioners  with  initial  certification  to  the  basic  level  by  means  of  a  computerized  testing \nsystem.    \n\nDecentralization \n\nIndonesia has transformed itself from one of the most centralized countries in the world to one of the most \ndecentralized countries within a short period of time. In 2004, the regions commanded about 35 percent \nof total Government spending. Given the sharp increase in regional transfers in 2006, the regional share \nin total public investment is likely to rise above  50 percent in 2006. One of the most important pending \ndecentralization  reforms  is  on  on-lending  and  on-granting  regulations  and  the  transition  to  market-\noriented system of sub-national credit. The Government has recently issued revisions to on-lending and \non-granting  decrees  to  facilitate  immediate  support  for  local  infrastructure  finance  and  service  delivery. \nMore work is however needed to establish a regulatory framework for the development of more market-\nbased system of sub-national credit, including the issuance of regional bonds (based on Law 33/2004). \n\nThe BAPPENAS blue book decree has been signed and issued (PerMen PPN No. 5 2006) and the on-\ngranting and on-lending decrees have been signed by the Minister of Finance.  \n\nRespective roles and responsibilities of MOF and Home Affairs with respect to financial reporting by local \ngovernments  have  not  been  fully  resolved,  although  some  amendments  to  earlier  decrees  have  been \nmade to harmonize local government financial reporting with that applicable to central government. \n\n \nKEY AREAS FOR FUTURE ATTENTION \u2013 PFM \n \nProgress  in  implementing  reforms  has  been  slower  than  what  development  partners  and  the \ngovernment  would  like.  To  some  degree  this  has  been  due  to  the  distraction  of  managing  string  of \nnatural  disasters  recently  experienced  in  the  country.  The  lack  of  financial  management  capacity  in  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7      77 \n\ngovernment  is  also  a  significant  a  contributory  factor  in  slowing  down  the  pace  of  implementation  of \nreforms. In the period ahead, progress of the following key on-going PFM reforms will need to be closely \nwatched: \n \n\n\u2022  Ensuring  greater  integrity  and  more  effective  management  of  public  funds  through  the \nimplementation  of  a  Treasury  Single  Account,  automating  the  treasury  payments  system,  and \ninstitution of measures to prevent the proliferation of off-budget bank accounts. \n\n\u2022  Strengthening external oversight of all public funds, by further enhancing the physical and human \n\ncapacity of BPK, and strengthening legislative capacity for oversight of budget execution. \n\n\u2022  Strengthening  internal  controls  in  government,  including  the  internal  audit  institutions  by \n\nrationalizing the number of institutions that now exist; \n\n\u2022 \n\nrevenue  collection  and  eliminating \n\nthrough  governance, \nIncreasing \naccountability-enhancing  reforms  to  the  tax  and  customs  administrations  and  enabling  audit \noversight of tax revenues. \n\nleakages \n\nrevenue \n\n\u2022     Implementation  of  a  government \n\ninformation  system,  successful \nimplementation of Government Accounting Standards and reengineering of underlying business \nprocesses to ensure reliable financial reporting. \n\nfinancial  management \n\n \n\u2022     Extending  modern \n\nfinancial  accountability  and  management  processes \n\nto  sub-national \n\ngovernments and bringing these fully in line with international and emerging national standards.  \n\n \nManagement of Foreign Exchange \n \nThe foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The country is \nno longer subject to the Extended Arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia (BI) was last subject to the \ntransitional  procedures  under  the  Fund\u2019s  safeguards  assessment  policy  in  2002.  That  assessment \nrecommended remedial actions to address a number of vulnerabilities in the audit arrangements for the \ncentral  bank.  The  main  recommendations  have  been  implemented,  including  the  establishment  of  an \nindependent  audit  committee  at  BI  and  the  publication  of  BI\u2019s  audited  financial  statements.  Audited \nfinancial statements for Bank Indonesia for the year 2005 have been reviewed and we note that the audit \nreport issued by BPK, the State Audit Board, contained an unqualified audit opinion. \n \nConclusion \n \nWeaknesses  in  the  financial  management  and  accountability  identified  in  the  past  continue  to  be \ngradually  addressed  through  the  PFM  reform  program  discussed  above,  and  supported  by  the  DPL \ntriggers as well as the GFMRAP project and other initiatives. These will generate some fiduciary risks for \nthis operation. Although the pace of implementing the planned reforms has been somewhat slow over the \nlast  year,  the  trajectory  of  reform  is  in  the  right  direction  and  the  current  Government  continues  to \ndemonstrate a commitment to continue the task of completing the planned reforms in PFM. Taking these \ninto  consideration,  we  do  not  propose  putting  in  place  any  additional  fiduciary  arrangements  for  this \noperation. \n\n \n\n\f Table A7.1: Status of CFAA Key Recommendations (October 2006) \n\n78   \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n \n\nCFAA Recommendation \nImproving the Control Environment \n1.

To \naddress the issue of weak technical support to the \nBudget Committee and Commissions, grant-based \ntechnical assistance of US$2 million is provided in \nGFMRAP-I. \nNot yet developed, except a limited one for the \nauditing sector. There is sufficient scope and \nflexibility within the GFMRAP program design to \nachieve this. \n \n \nAdopted since FY 2005 \n\nImplementation has started. From FY2005 the \nbudget process progressively provides for greater \npolitical input into the budget process. GFMRAP \nprovides grant-based TA for strengthening DPR \ncapacity. \nImplementation started in budget FY 2003. \n\nImplementation started in budget FY 2005, as \nmandated under Finance Law 17/2003. However, \nmore work is needed to train line ministries to fully \napply these concepts. \n \nAs part of the ongoing MOF reorganization, a new \nDG Treasury was created in 2005 to oversee \naccounting and treasury functions and separated \nfrom DG Budget and Fiscal Balance. There is no \nposition of Accountant General, but a Directorate \nfor Systems, Accounts and Reporting (DIA) has \nbeen created within DG Treasury. \nThe MOF Reorganization 2004 addressed some of \nthese concerns. New Govt. Accounting Standards \nhave been promulgated by Government \nRegulation. Consolidation of accounting will be \nsupported by the treasury modernization \ncomponent of the GFMRAP-I. A set of aggregate \nfinancial statements for years 2004 and 2005 have \nbeen prepared in time, and plans have been drawn \nup for changes in underlying business processes \nrequired to implement fully new accounting \nstandards. \n\n\fCFAA Recommendation \n10. Establish a financial controllership function \nwithin sector ministries to coordinate planning, \nbudgeting, accounting and reporting. \n\n11.  Issue Treasury management guidelines and \nconsolidate cash management under MOF \n\n12. Establish quarterly and annual forecasting of \ncash needs including receipts, payments and \ncommitments. \n13 Develop an IT strategy and a practice statement \nfor public sector agencies \n\n14. Develop integrated financial management \ninformation system to serve central government \nneeds \n15. Develop financial management information \nsystems to support the enhanced role of financial \ncontrollers at sector ministries \n16. Standardize form and content of Annual \nReports to be prepared by the Government \nagencies \n\n17. Design form and content of the Government's \nAnnual Report to the Parliament. \nStrengthen Government Auditing \n18. Revise the current Audit Law No. 5 of 1973 to \nincorporate features of a modern public accounting \nand auditing law. \n\n19. Following the enactment of the above law, \nreconstitute the Supreme Audit Agency to be \nresponsible for all external audits of budgetary \nfunds of national and sub-national government. \n20. Under the new law, redefine the functions of \ninternal audit units within sector ministries. \n\n \n\nAppendix 7      79 \n\nStatus as of October 2006 \n\nThe MOF reorganization includes shifting greater \nresponsibility for financial control to line ministries \nand this has commenced in 2005, though weak \ncapacity in Ministries is a constraint. \nThe implementing regulations for the State \nTreasury Law will address this. Responsibility for \nCash and asset management has been \nconsolidated under the DG Treasury.  \nThis will be covered by the implementing \nregulations for the State Treasury Law. \n\nA beginning has been made with the MOF \u2013 the \nDG Customs has promulgated an ICT policy \nstatement as a precursor to a more detailed ICT \nStrategy. The ongoing SPAN design and \nimplementation initiative is another example of ICT \napplication driven by business needs. \nThe design and implementation of the SPAN \nsystem is the first step in the eventual \nimplementation of an IFMIS. \nPublic Sector FM Reform plan addresses these \nconcerns. \n\nA Government Accounting Standards Committee \nhas been in operation for a few years. A first set of \n11 such standards have been by Government \nRegulation 24/2005. The prescribed reporting \nstandards are applied by all agencies, but the \nquality of implementation is very poor. \nPublic Sector FM Reform plan includes preparation \nof a government annual report. \n \nAudit law passed in July 2004, providing clear \nmandate for BPK as Supreme Audit Institution. \nSubsequently, on 30 October 2006, Parliament \nenacted Law on BPK No.15/2006, fully clarifying \nthe role, responsibility, organization, and functions \nof the BPK as the Supreme Audit Institution \nThis is provided in the new Law on BPK. \n\nNot clear enough in the Law on State Audit. \nInternal audit function is weakened by current \noverlaps in audit institutions. Progress is under way \nin formulating a regulation on internal controls. \nLimited progress. \n\n21. Develop and implement a comprehensive \nprofessional development plan for both external \nand internal auditors. \nAG  =  Accountant  General;  BAKUN  =  State  Accounting  Agency  (now  subsumed  under  DG  Treasury);  BPK  = \nSupreme Audit Institution; FY = Fiscal Year, PFM = public financial management; GFMRAP = Government Financial \nManagement  and  Revenue  Administration  Project;  ICT  =  information  and  communication  technology;  TFMIS  = \nTreasury Financial Management Information System, KPKN = State Treasury Office \nSources: World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n\f80   \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\n \nX  Yes \n \n\n \nX Yes \n \n  No \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT  \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nThe  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (NPRS)  has  five  basic  strategies  for  poverty  reduction:  (i)  broadening \nopportunities,  (ii)  empowering  community  institutions,  (iii)  increasing  capacity,  (iv)  providing  social  protection,  and \n(v) promoting global partnerships. The NPRS is to be implemented through macroeconomic strategy and policies for \nfulfilling  basic  rights,  promoting  gender  justice  and  equality,  and  regional  development.  The  NPRS  considers \nmacroeconomic policies as the foundation for reducing poverty through a supportive business environment and broad \nopportunities  for  increasing  the  capability  of  the  poor  through  four  related  objectives  to  (i)  create  macroeconomic \nstability,  (ii)  promote  economic  growth,  (iii)  increase  opportunities  for  employment  and  entrepreneurship,  and \n(iv) reduce  inequalities  between  regions.  The  NPRS  considers  the  willingness  of  central  and  local  governments  to \nmanage the budget in an open, accountable, efficient, and effective way\u2014an essential prerequisite for implementing \nthe  NPRS.  It  recognizes  that  partnerships  are  necessary  for  implementing  the  NPRS  with  the  private  sector,  and \nfinancial and nonfinancial banking institutions are identified as key stakeholders.  \n \nThe country poverty assessment1 and country poverty partnership agreement2 consider macroeconomic stability as a \nfundamental underpinning to poverty reduction. Under the agreement, ADB has agreed to support the Government to \npromote  macroeconomic  stability  for  inclusive  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Highest  priority  is  given  to  institutional \nreforms  to  achieve  transparent  and  accountable  institutions.  The  poverty  agreement  also  calls  for  expansion  and \nimprovement  of  key  basic  services  such  as  health,  education,  water  supply,  and  sanitation  through  public-private \npartnerships  and  the  need  to  expand  a  system  of  social  protection.  At  the  same  time,  the  poverty  partnership \nagreement notes the tremendous fiscal constraint facing the Government in the medium term, and therefore the need \nto make the best use of existing resources.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                               \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL)  series,  as  cofinanced  by  the  Development  Policy  Support  Program  (DPSP)  by \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  directly  supports  implementation  of  the  NPRS  as  envisioned  by  the  poverty \npartnership agreement. The DPSP focuses on key areas central to implementing the NPRS strategy. The core areas \nof the program are   \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nensuring macroeconomic stability,  \nimproving the investment climate,  \nimproving public financial management, and  \nimproving public service delivery for the poor.   \n\n \nThe  actions  under  each  of  these  core  areas  directly  correspond  to  the  NPRS  strategy  or  implementing  mechanism. \nThe links between DPSP-2 actions and the NPRS are shown in Table A8.1. \n \nThe  DPSP-2  actions  are  essential  for  implementing  the  NPRS.  A  few  key  features  with  a  pro-poor  focus  are \nhighlighted below: \n\n\u2022  Continuing  focus  on  public  expenditure  reorientation  towards  pro-poor  needs  (e.g.  the  2006  budget  has \nallocated over $6 billion in additional resources for health, education, and community infrastructure needs) \n\u2022  Enhancing analytical capacity within the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for improving fiscal policy,  which in turn \nwould help accelerate economic growth by formulating effective tax and fiscal decentralization measures \n\u2022  Streamlining on-granting procedures to channel development assistance from national to local governments \n\u2022  Considerably enhancing transparency and accountability in public financial management \n\u2022 \n\nImproving overall governance through providing adequate protection for witnesses who provide information, \namong others for instance, on poor implementation of government programs \n\n\u2022  Undertaking  and  institutionalizing  in-depth  pro-poor  program  assessments,  and  using  the  findings  in \nimproving  the  ongoing  unconditional  cash  transfer  (UCT)  program  and  designing  the  proposed  conditional \ncash transfer (CCT) program  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8      81 \n\nTable A8.1: Links between the National Poverty Reduction Strategy  \nand the DPL/DPSP Actions  \n \n\nDevelopment Policy Support Program Actions \n\nNational Poverty \nReduction Strategy  \nMacroeconomic Stability \nFiscal policy directed to \nmore effective and efficient \nmanagement of the state \nbudget and revenues, and \nmanagement of foreign \nloans and grants \n\n \n\nTransparency and \naccountability of the state \nfinance \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBasic Rights  \nBasic services such as \nhealth, education, and \nwater supply access to \ndecent work; and reduction \nof regional inequalities \n\n \n\nImplementation \nMechanism Partnerships \nPrivate sector to play a role \nin investment, production, \nand distribution of goods \nand services; generate \ntaxes; create jobs and \ninfrastructure; and provide \naccess to assets and \ntechnology \n\nImplement Law No. 33/2004 including redesign of Ministry of Finance decree  \n\n\u2022  Reduce subsidies to non-poor, and effectively use savings for pro-poor   \n      programs \n\u2022 \nImprove tax revenue administration \n\u2022  Develop a debt management strategy.  \n\u2022 \n      on onlending and on-granting \n\u2022  Reallocate central Government-sponsored funding to Special Purpose Grants. \n\u2022  Complete implementing regulations: State Finance Law, Treasury Law, and \n  Audit Law  \n\u2022  Develop and implement a timetable for a single treasury account \n\u2022  Establish an operations unit with powers to investigate fraud \n\u2022  Submit a Witness Protection Law to parliament (subsequently enacted) \n\u2022 \n\nInitiate civil service reforms \n\nImprove targeting of the poor \n\n\u2022 \n\u2022  Learn from existing compensation programs to improve them \n\u2022  Develop a new rationalized social safety net by 2007, possibly including a pilot \nconditional cash transfer program.

Implementation  of  the  compensation  programs  initiated  in  March  2005  and  October  2005  by  the \nGovernment will provide additional insights. These lessons will enable the Government to develop better targeted and \nmore  transparent  programs  to  accelerate  implementation  of  the  NPRS.  ADB\u2019s  parallel  sector  interventions  (e.g.  the \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Millennium  Development  Goal  [MDG]  Acceleration  Program)  will  provide  reinforcing  support. \nThe  DPSP  also  supports  enhanced  private  sector  participation  in  NPRS  implementation  through  broad-ranging \nmeasures,  by  reducing  transaction  costs  associated  with  investments  and  removing  registration  delays  and \nuncertainties.  It  will  support  financial  intermediation  for  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs).  Infrastructure \ndevelopment  will  receive  attention,  through  support  for  allocation  of  resources  for  public  sector  risk  sharing.  These \nmeasures will help attract productive investments to generate employment.    \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n\n \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nNote: As part of the development policy loan process, consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, \nincluding the private sector, labor groups, and enterprises. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n   Yes                X   No \n\nX   No  \n\n   Yes \n\n \n\n \n\n\f82   \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe DPL series has indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on making services work for the poor. The improved \npoverty  orientation  of  public  spending  increases  women\u2019s  access  to  essential  services  for  achieving  MDG  targets, \nincluding reducing child and maternal mortality. Improvement of the financial management systems of the Government \nthrough  increased  transparency  and  accountability  will  provide  the  civil  society  with  basic  information  necessary  to \nmonitor  government  actions,  and  enable  it  to  provide  inputs  into  policy  and  budget  decisions.  A  strengthened  civil \nsociety provides women,  with a more effective channel for  voicing their priorities. An improved investment climate is \nexpected to provide greater opportunities for women, who experience significantly higher rates of unemployment, even \nwhen controlling for experience and level of education. \n \n    Yes \nHas an output been prepared? \nE.

The DPSP promotes \ninvestments in productive sectors, including infrastructure. The \nmeasures will create jobs necessary to absorb the increasing \nnumber of unemployed. Surveys are under way at present to \ndetermine if there have been any significant business closures \nfollowing the inflationary impact of fuel subsidy reduction in \n2005. It is expected that any such negative employment impact \nis likely to be offset by the compensation program consisting of \nbasic infrastructure investments, providing opportunities for \ncasual labor. In addition, the compensation programs for health \nand education will help reduce household expenses.  \nNeutral impact \n\nExternal factors (increasing terrorist acts or pandemic) or \npolitical disturbances could result in incomplete implementation \nof the policies or delay in achieving anticipated benefits. \nResistance to the reduction in the fuel subsidies so far has \nbeen relatively limited. The Government is focusing its attention \non implementing the compensation programs well, and in \nparallel is continuing its public education and information \ncampaign to outline the distortions caused by the large fuel \nsubsidies.  \n\n1.
