I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Second Small and Microfinance Development Project. The \nreport also describes a technical assistance (TA) proposal for Capacity Building for Microfinance \nDevelopment,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The Project facilitates access to credit by micro and small enterprises (MSEs) across \nUzbekistan. It supports the generation of employment and sustains about 30,000 jobs for men \nand  women.  It  contributes  to  inclusive  economic  growth.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  intervention \ncomprises (i) a loan of $50 million to be channeled through three participating commercial banks \n(PCBs)1 for onlending to viable MSEs; and (ii) a TA grant of $600,000 to improve PCBs' MSE  \nfinance  capacity  and  their  subborrowers'  entrepreneurial  skills.  Appendix  1  contains  the \nproject\u2019s design and monitoring framework.   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Economic  significance  of  small  business. After a difficult transition in the 1990s \nfollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, Uzbekistan\u2019s economy has been growing steadily. \nBetween 2005 and 2009, the average rate of increase in gross domestic product (GDP) was \n8.2%.  The share of small businesses in the GDP increased from 30% in 2000 to 50% in 2009. \nThis is expected to increase to 52.5% in 2010. By the end of 2009, there were about 8.4 million \npeople working in 422,401 MSEs and sole proprietorship businesses.2 A focus on horticulture3 \nand  value-added  processing,  storage,  transport,  and  other  related  services  in  the  farm-to-\nmarket  chain  benefits  microenterprises  (i.e.,  smallholder  farms  and  plantations)  and  small \nbusinesses (storage, refrigeration, transport services, wholesale, retail, and agro-processing). \nThere  are  strong  complementarities  between  these  two  business  segments  because  of \nbackward and forward linkages.4   \n \n4.  Unmet credit demand. Despite strong credit growth in recent years, demand by MSEs \nremains unmet at present. According to the Central Bank of Uzbekistan, total loans granted by \ncommercial banks to MSEs reached $898 million (SUM1.25 trillion) in 2008 and $1.2 billion \n(SUM1.85 trillion) in 2009. The amount allocated to microcredit by commercial banks increased \nby about 100% in 2009 over 2008 and is targeted to increase by another 30% to reach $275 \nmillion (SUM 420 billion) in 2010.5 According to a World Bank survey,6 only 7.8% of business \nfinancing is met by loans\u2014the lowest percentage in the region (where the average is 23.3%). \n                                                 \n1  The PCBs are Agrobank, Hamkorbank, and Ipak Yuli Bank.   \n2  In Uzbekistan, a microenterprise is defined as an enterprise employing 1\u201320 persons in industry and 1\u20135 (in some \ncases 1\u201310) persons in services; a small enterprise is one that employs 21\u201350 persons in agriculture and industry, \nand 6\u201325 persons in services (Resolution of the Cabinet of Minister of the Republic of Uzbekistan, no. 439, dated \n11 October 2003). At the end of 2008, small enterprises employed 525,500 persons and microenterprises \nemployed  about  1.64  million  persons;  another  5.86  million  were  self-employed,  running  sole  proprietorship \nbusinesses. \n3  Agricultural reforms have freed horticulture from state quotas and price controls and, particularly in the Fergana \nValley, encouraged family farms to concentrate on horticulture. \n4  Macroeconomic and Sector Analysis, and Country Economic Indicators (Appendix 2). \n5  The Law on Microfinance, approved in September 2006, quantifies microcredit as 1,000 times the minimum wage \n(presently pegged at SUM37,800), microloans as 100 times the minimum wage, and micro-leasing as 2,000 times \nthe minimum wage.  \n6  World Bank Group. 2009. Enterprise Surveys. Country Note. Uzbekistan. ", "2     \nADB\u2019s past credit lines to Uzbekistan7 indicate high demand from micro, small, and medium-\nsized business operating in all sectors, particularly agriculture and agroprocessing. \n \n5.  Underdeveloped  and  regulated  financial  sector.  MSE\u2019s  access  to  credit  is \nconstrained by the nature and characteristics of the financial sector in Uzbekistan, which is \nsubject to various distortions. For instance, directed lending at subsidized interest rates leads to \nmisallocation of resources. For depositors, practical difficulties in cash withdrawals from bank \naccounts have created a premium for cash and a trust gap for banks in terms of their ability to \nmobilize customer deposits. This is manifested by a low (individual and household customer) \nbank deposits\u2013GDP ratio of 6.6% in 2009.8 The government has put in place measures to \nincrease  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  which  are  expected  to  raise  deposits \nmobilization.9 \n \n6.  Selection of strong PCBs. The proposed intervention will meet a share of the MSE \ncredit  demand  while  addressing  financial  sector  distortions.  This  will  be  achieved  through \nworking with PCBs committed to sustainable MSE financing that meet the following criteria: \n(i) financial soundness (solvency, liquidity, profitability, efficiency, and prudence);10 (ii) extensive \nrural retail network; (iii) a proven track record and efficiency in non-subsidized microfinance \nintermediation; (iv) ability and willingness to manage the foreign exchange risk prudently; and \n(v) transparent corporate, financial, and management governance practices. Based on these \ncriteria,  ADB  selected  three  PCBs:  Agrobank,  Hamkorbank,  and  Ipak  Yuli  Bank  (IYB). \nHamkorbank and IYB are privately owned, while Agrobank is majority government owned.  \n \n7.  The  selected  PCBs\u2019  business  models  and  client  profile  correspond  well  with  the \nproposed project objectives. Their business models aim at (i) increasing their retail presence \ngeographically, (ii) diversifying operations into various sectors, (iii) offering new products to \nmeet customer needs and increase profitability, and (iv) better outreach to viable but unbanked \nand  under-banked  potential  clients.  Their  client  base  is  diverse:  Agrobank  has  a  strong \npresence in the agriculture and agro-processing sectors, while Hamkorbank and IYB are more \nfocused in the trade finance sector (IYB also has significant exposure to light manufacturing). \nMicro and small business loans constitute close to one-third of Hamkorbank\u2019s and one-fourth of \nIYB\u2019s loan portfolios; for Agrobank, they constitute one-tenth (given the much larger size of its \noverall portfolio). For their loans up to $20,000, the average loan size is $4,000, with an average \nrepayment period of 18 months. These loans finance both investment and working capital.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1996.

Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Small and Microfinance Development Project. Manila (Loan 1963-UZB, $20 \nmillion, approved on 9 December). \n8  Source: Central Bank of Uzbekistan.  \n9  These measures, complemented by the banks\u2019 own deposit mobilization effort, have shown some success. The \nindividual and household bank deposits\u2013GDP ratio increased consistently since 2000, from 0.9% to 6.6% in 2009 \n(or from SUM33.6 billion to SUM2.9 trillion in 2009, in absolute terms). For further details, see Macroeconomic and \nSectoral Analysis, and Country Economic Indicators (Appendix 2). \n10 For solvency, PCBs will be required to have a Basel I compliant capital adequacy ratio of not less than 12%. For \nprofitability, they will have a return on assets ratio of not less than 1%. For liquidity, they will maintain a loan\u2013\ndeposit ratio of under 100%. For efficiency, they will be required to have an intermediation cost ratio of less than \n15%. To be conservative and financially prudent, the PCBs\u2019 loan delinquency and write-off ratio shall not exceed \n5%. ", "  3\n8.  ADB loan size linked to PCB\u2019s business growth. Judging by their loan\u2013deposit ratios, \nall three PCBs have demonstrated an ability to raise and retain customer deposits for MSE \nintermediation. Their outstanding MSE loan balances were $51.4 million in December 2008 and \n$75.8 million in November 2009, i.e. growing by more than 50% notwithstanding the global \nfinancial crisis. Assuming a similar linear trajectory on a compounded basis, their MSE loans \noutstanding could reach $484.6 million by 2013. The expected credit growth justifies an ADB \nloan of $50 million, which complements but does not substitute the PCBs\u2019 deposit mobilization. \nTo demonstrate their commitment to the MSE sector, PCBs will be required to match ADB\u2019s \ncredit allocation with their own funds. \n \n9.  Market orientation and increase in financial choices. The Government has agreed \nwith  the  application  of  market-based  principles  under  the  project,  including  market  based \nonlending rates, choice of currency by sub-borrowers and unrestricted cash withdrawals for sum \nsubloans. PCBs may offer US dollar subloans through bank transfers. In the case of subloans in \nsum, subborrowers may draw down loans in any legal form, including cash. This effectively \naddresses the existing distortion between cash and noncash markets.11 Collateral will be neither \na condition nor a prohibition. Given the continuous depreciation of the sum against the US \ndollar, it is expected that MSEs will borrow in US dollars only if their revenues are denominated \nin hard currency. This may be the case mainly for MSEs engaged in trading. Given the profile of \ntheir clients, the volume of US dollar denominated subloans is expected to be higher in the case \nof Hamkorbank and IYB12 than Agrobank.13 \n \n10.  Attention to underserviced groups and gender sensitivity. To benefit subborrowers \nof smaller subloans, PCBs may make subloans to microcredit organizations (MCOs) up to \n$20,000 equivalent each, provided they (i) apply the subloan eligibility criteria to subborrowers; \nand (ii) make loans to their (MCOs) subborrowers not exceeding $1,000 each. This approach \nwill give PCBs the advantage of wholesale economies by lending to institutions that target lower \nincome  beneficiaries,  particularly  among  women.  To  ensure  wide  distribution,  50%  of  the \naggregate outstanding principal amounts of PCBs lending under the project to subborrowers \nother than MCOs will be for loan sizes up to $10,000. Lending by the three PCBs to women \ncurrently represents one-quarter to one-third of the total number of microcredit loans. TA will be \nprovided to help improve the PCBs\u2019 credit appraisal capacities for MSE and gender sensitivity, \nas  well  as  to  improve  the  skills  of  subborrowers  (particularly  women)  in  business  plan \npreparation  and  credit  application.  This  will  complement  credit  outreach  and  client \nempowerment work. \n \n11.  Strategic fit and lessons learned. The project complies with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 14 which  supports  sustainable  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  gender  and \ndevelopment, and its Microfinance Strategy.15 For rural nonfarm enterprise development, ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy encourages forward and backward linkages with the agricultural \nsector.  These  linkages  absorb surplus  labor  released  from  agriculture.  The  loan  will carry \nforward this principle to other sectors as well. It also supports the development of rural financial \nservices and promotes more efficient intermediation functions by commercial banks. It seeks (by \nallowing subborrowers to draw down their sum subloans in cash if they so choose) to abolish \n                                                 \n11 The principle of withdrawal of sum subloans in cash is consistent with the law in Uzbekistan, and has been \nfollowed in a similar project financed by another multilateral agency.   \n12 At the end of 2008, the share of US dollar-denominated assets was 29.5% in Hamkorbank\u2019s balance sheet and \n16.6% in IYB\u2019s balance sheet.  \n13 Macroeconomic and Sectoral Analysis (Appendix 2). \n14 ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "4     \nthe distinction between cash and noncash market transactions. The project was designed after \nconsultation with stakeholders, including other development partners, and incorporates lessons \nlearned from previous ADB microfinance interventions.16 In an earlier loan, ADB underestimated \nthe  demand  for  micro  and  small  business  credit  and  selected  a  bank  with  only  limited \nexperience in micro and small business lending. This time, ADB has selected PCBs with proven \noperational and financial capacity for MSE credit delivery and assessed the demand for credit \nbased on the business projections of the PCBs.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The project will generate jobs and create business opportunities in the MSE sector, thus \ncontributing  to  welfare  improvement  in  Uzbekistan  (Appendix  1).  Its  outcome  will  be  an \nexpanded, viable and sustainable MSE finance sector, and thus an increase of investment \nopportunities. 17 \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The project will expand microfinance delivery to financially viable subborrowers (men \nand women), by providing funding and training to the three PCBs. The project will also improve \nthe entrepreneurial capacity of subborrowers, especially women, by training them in business \nplan preparation and credit applications. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n14.  ADB will provide a loan of $50 million. PCBs will provide $50 million in counterpart \nfunding.18  \n \nE.  Lending, Relending, and Onlending Arrangements \n \n15.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $50  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources. The loan will have a 20-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and other such terms and \nconditions included in the loan and project agreements. The government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n16.  The Republic of Uzbekistan will be the borrower. The government will relend to the \nPCBs the loan proceeds through three subsidiary loan agreements (SLAs):19 up to $20 million \nfor Hamkorbank, up to $20 million for Agrobank, and up to $10 million for IYB. If there is any \nchange  to  the  current  composition  of  PCBs,  the  borrower  may  reallocate  loan  proceeds \nbetween the PCBs in a manner acceptable to ADB. The government may charge the PCBs an \n                                                 \n16 Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n17 Contribution to the Output Aggregates of the ADB Results Framework and Project Classification Summary \n(Appendix 2). \n18 For each subproject financed by a PCB, at least 30% of the subproject costs shall be met by equity contribution \nfrom the subborrower. The balance of the subproject costs shall be financed via a subloan from the PCB. Such \nsubloan shall comprise 50% from the PCB\u2019s funds and 50% from the proceeds of the ADB loan relent to the PCB. \n19 It is expected that under SLAs: (i) the term of government relending to PCBs will be for 15 years, with a 3-year \ngrace period; (ii) a margin of up to 0.5%; and (iii) commitment fees charged to PCBs on a pro rata basis. The PCBs \nhave until 31 December 2013 to avail of their drawdown. ", "  5\nappropriate margin for assuming the risk of loss due to the possibility of PCBs' nonpayment of \nthe loan. The PCBs will onlend loan funds in either sum or in US dollars to their subborrowers at \nmarket interest rates for up to 3 years. This will enable recycling of loan funds and thus widen \nthe number of beneficiaries. Subloans may be either to new or repeat subborrowers as long as \nthey meet viability standards.20 The PCBs will manage their foreign exchange and credit risks \nprudently by charging appropriate risk premiums, which will be factored into their onlending \nrates for subloans.21 \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency for the project and be \nresponsible for drafting, executing, and overseeing the SLAs with the PCBs. The three PCBs \nwill be the implementing agencies for their activities in the project. ADB will enter into a loan \nagreement with MOF and three separate project agreements with the PCBs.22 Each PCB will \nestablish a project implementation unit adequately staffed and acceptable to ADB, as defined in \nthe project administration manual (PAM), discussed and agreed with the government and the \nPCBs.23 The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1 and described in detail in \nthe PAM.  \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  30 June 2010\u201330 June 2013 \nEstimated project completion date  30 June 2013 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2013 \nProject management \n(i)    Oversight Body  Banking Supervision Department \nCentral Bank of Uzbekistan  \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies    Composition of project implementation \n  units (PIUs):  \n(i)   Agrobank  4 PIU staff \n(ii)  Ipak Yuli Bank  4 PIU staff \n(iii)  Hamkorbank  3 PIU staff \nSources: Ministry of Finance, Central Bank of Uzbekistan, Agrobank, Hamkorbank, and Ipak Yuli Bank. \n \n18.  Detailed  arrangements  for  procurement,  disbursement,  accounting,  audit,  monitoring \nand evaluation, and consulting services for the TA are explained in the PAM. There is no \nretroactive financing and/or advance contracting. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n19.  ADB\u2019s capacity development TA will (i) train banks on MSE credit appraisal customized \nto ADB's requirements, (ii) sensitize PCB staff on the need for increasing MSE loans to women, \n(iii) educate women borrowers on business plan preparation and credit application, (iv) sensitize \n                                                 \n20 For loans from $1,000 to $20,000, subborrowers must (i) have a debt\u2013equity ratio not higher than 70:30, (ii) a debt \nservice coverage ratio not lower than 1.25, and (iii) a proven track record. For loans up to $1,000, PCBs will assess \ntheir track records, future cash flows, third-party guarantees, existing debt obligations, and other criteria deemed \nnecessary. \n21 PCBs\u2019 onlending rates for US dollar subloans currently range from 8% to 18% per annum, and for sum subloans \nfrom 36% to 48% per annum. Considering that PCBs will get access to US dollar loan funds from the borrower at \nmargins of up to 0.5%, their onlending rates adequately factor in their credit and foreign exchange risk premiums. \n22 Loan and Project Agreements (Appendix 2). \n23 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "6     \nand guide PCBs' onlending to MCOs, and (v) improve PCBs\u2019 transparency by recommending \ntheir display of MSE loan procedures on their websites and train their staff in microfinance \naccounting and reporting standards. The estimated cost of the TA is $615,000 equivalent, of \nwhich ADB will finance $600,000 from the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). 24  \nThe three PCBs will finance the balance in kind. MOF will be the executing agency for the TA. \nThe three PCBs will be the implementing agencies for the TA. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n20.  ADB\u2019s  initial  due  diligence  indicates  that  this  credit  facilty  is  financially  viable, \neconomically sustainable, socially desirable, and legally permissible. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The three PCBs\u2019 track records (by review of their audited financial statements, internal \ncontrol procedures, and corporate and financial governance practices) show them to be solvent, \nprofitable, liquid, efficient, and conservative. Their past capital adequacy ratios have been equal \nto or higher than 12%, according to Basel I formulations. Their return on assets have been \nequal  to  or  higher  than  1%.  Their  loan\u2013deposit  ratios  have  been  under  100%,  their \nintermediation cost ratios under 15%, and their bad debts have never exceeded 5%.25 The \nPCBs will be required to maintain such sound financial performance ratios in the future while \nimplementing  the  loan,  to  continue  to  be  eligible  intermediaries.26 The  subproject  eligibility \ncriteria are designed to ensure viability and continued operational and financial soundness. \n \n22.  Sustainability will be supported by the government and Central Bank of Uzbekistan, by \n(i) allowing PCBs to onlend ADB funds at market interest rates without restrictions on the type or \npurpose of loan fund use; (ii) permitting subborrowers to draw down sum subloans in any legal \nform,  including  cash;  (iii)  creating  the  necessary  enabling  macroeconomic  and  financial \nenvironment from the legal, regulatory, and policy perspective for MSE development; and (iv) \nproviding ADB with information necessary to monitor ADB\u2019s results framework. \n \nB.  Governance \n23.  Reviews were conducted for the PCBs\u2019 credit, operational, and counterparty risks. ADB \nis satisfied with measures for monitoring and mitigating these risks. The three PCBs' financial \nstatements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and \naudited  by  internationally  recognized  external  auditors  in  accordance  with  International \nStandards of Auditing acceptable to ADB. The three PCBs' corporate and financial governance \nstandards fully meet ADB's requirements. ADB will work closely with the government and PCBs \nto  ensure  that  subloans  will  not  finance  activities  that  contradict  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  A  PAM  outlining  the  detailed  project  implementation  arrangement  and  ADB\u2019s \nfinancial management assessment, agreed between ADB, the government, and PCBs, will be \nadhered to throughout the implementation period. \n \n                                                 \n24 The  TA  project's  detailed  costs  and  financing  plan,  activities,  terms  of  reference  for  consultants,  and  its \nimplementation arrangements are in Technical Assistance (Appendix 2). \n25 See Loan and Project Agreements for definition of these ratios (Appendix 2). \n26 Financial Analysis of Participating Commercial Banks (Appendix 2). The financial management assessment report \nand detailed analysis of their operational and financial performance are in the supplementary appendixes. ", "  7\n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith MOF and the three PCBs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n25.  Despite Uzbekistan\u2019s recent economic growth, 25.8% of its households are below the \npoverty line.27 Poverty is correlated with unemployment or underemployment.28 Since MSEs are \nlabor\u2013intensive, they can provide employment and empowerment opportunities to the poor. \nBank credit is an important prerequisite to this goal. Even if PCBs\u2019 subborrowers are not \nthemselves poor, their use of bank credit will enable them to hire 30,000 more workers (both \nmen and women) between 2010 and 2013.29 This will raise employment and indirectly reduce \npoverty.30 Providing jobs domestically will reduce outward migration (of the unemployed) and \nmitigate social costs. \n \n26.  Thus far, only about 22% of total bank lending in Uzbekistan has gone to women.31 This \nloan is expected to raise their share through (i) training of women borrowers; (ii) sensitization of \nbank staff; (iii) developing types of lending of particular interest to women such as solidarity \ngroup lending, micro-leasing, and lending against the future flow of remittances (to wives of \nmigrant workers); (iv) introduction of life and accident credit insurance products to micro-loan \nborrowers; and (v) lending to MCOs, which will benefit poor women particularly in remote rural \nareas. The PCBs will maintain sex-disaggregated data on the beneficiaries of their small and \nmicrofinance loans and will report such information to ADB. The project has effective gender \nmainstreaming content.32 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n27.  The Project conforms to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement33 and complies with the \nrequirements  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  labor,  environmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  laws  and \nregulations. It falls under the Financial Intermediary (FI) category with respect to environment \nand social safeguards. It is treated as category C, as PCBs will finance only those subprojects \nwhich have minimal or no adverse social or environmental risks. Any subprojects (i) falling \nunder  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  categories  A  and  B,  and/or  (ii) which \nspecifically  require  environmental  assessment  clearances  by  the  government,  will  not  be \nfinanced under the loan. ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activity list will apply. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  This operation is classified as low risk, considering (i) the loan amount is only $50 \nmillion; (ii) the sound record of ADB\u2019s previous experience in the sector; and (iii) reasonable \nexecuting agency capacity. This loan is categorized environment category FI, but treated as C \n                                                 \n27 Government of Uzbekistan. 2007.

An important part \nof the remaining 50% is the \u201cworking poor,\u201d engaged in low productivity jobs. Seventy percent of the poor live in \nrural areas.   \n29 This estimate is based on the experience of the first Small and Microfinance Development Project, through which \nabout 11,000 new jobs have been created so far, with nearly $36 million of debt financing. \n30 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n31 Source: Central Bank of Uzbekistan. \n32 Gender Action Plan (Appendix 2). \n33 ADB. 2009.
