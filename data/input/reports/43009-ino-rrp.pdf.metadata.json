These \neffects  are  manifested  in  a  number  of  forms:  (i)  the  Indonesian  stock \nmarket  declined  by  31%  during  October  2008;  (ii)  yields  on  medium-\nincreased  by  nearly  400  basis  points; \nterm  domestic  bonds \n(iii) Indonesia\u2019s  international  bond  spreads  surged  by  about  650  basis \npoints;  (iv)  the  rupiah  exchange  rate  depreciated  by  17%  against  the \nUS dollar; and (v) exports contracted in February by 33%, the first time \nin several years. \n\nWhile  the  direct  effect  of  the  global  crisis  on  the  banking  system  in \nIndonesia  has  been  limited  because  of  lack  of  direct  investment  in \ntroubled US assets, liquidity in the banking system has been very tight \nsince  September  2008.  The  yields  on  Indonesian  domestic  bonds \nremained elevated and rose more sharply than elsewhere in Southeast \nAsia  since  October  2008.  Government  finances  have  been  especially \nvulnerable to spikes in global risk aversion and contagion from external \nmarkets  because  of  the country\u2019s  large  gross  financing  needs  and  the \nneed for a fiscal stimulus. The term structure of Indonesia\u2019s bonds led \nto sharply higher debt issuances in 2007 and 2008, and amortization is \nprojected to remain at high levels through 2011. During normal market \nconditions,  Indonesia  was  able  to  raise  more  than  $12  billion  from \ndomestic  and  international  markets  in  both  2007  and  2008.  However, \n\nBorrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nThe Program \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \nii \n\n \n\ntighter  global  liquidity  and  higher  risk  premiums  combined  with  high \ngross  financing  needs  have  raised  interest  rates  on  Indonesian  debt \ncompared with other economies in the region. With prohibitive yields on \nrupiah  and  US  dollar  bonds,  the  Government  could  not  access  funds \nfrom  the  credit  markets  in  Q4 2008\u2014raising  concerns  about  possible \nbudget financing constraints in 2009. Liquidity in the credit markets has \neased  since  January  2009,  allowing  the  Government  to  access \ndomestic  resources  although  at  a  higher  cost  than  under  normal \nconditions.  \n\nIn  January  2009,  the  Government  revised  its  budget  to  reflect  the \ndeteriorating  external  environment  and  the  need  to  provide  fiscal \nstimulus.  As  a  result,  Indonesia\u2019s  2009  budget  deficit  has  been \nincreased  from  1.0%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  2.5%,  and \ngross financing needs from Rp171.4 trillion to Rp270.7 trillion.   \n\n  In  this  context,  the  Government  requested  the  World  Bank,  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), and other development partners to provide a \nPublic  Expenditure  Support  Facility  (PESF).  The  Government  has \nstated  that  it  intends  to  access  the  facility  only  under  certain \ncircumstances  set  out  in  its  financing  plan,  such  as  in  the  event  of \nrenewed difficulties in accessing credit markets as occurred in Q4 2008 \n(i.e., a contingent loan).  \n \nUnder  the  PESF  Program,  the  Government  will  implement  a  series  of \nconfidence-boosting  policy  measures  aimed  at  sending  a  strong \npositive signal to the markets, making it more likely that Indonesia will \nmeet  its  commercial  market  borrowing  targets  for  2009.  These  policy \nmeasures address the increased short-term vulnerabilities and risks to \nthe  Indonesian  economy  from  the  global  financial  crisis  and  sharp \nslowdown in the global economy, and underpin the key priorities of the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda.  These  measures  include  actions  to \n(i) reassure  financial  markets  and  maintain  financial  system  stability, \n(ii) sustain  critical  public  expenditures  while  maintaining  budget \ndiscipline to mitigate the poverty impacts of the growth slowdown, and \n(iii) crowd in private investment and support exports.  \n \nThe PESF is part of a joint effort of the World Bank, ADB, Government \nof  Australia,  and  Government  of  Japan  to  support  a  common  crisis-\nmitigating  action  agenda  with  the Government,  and  provide  contingent \nbudget financing in the event of further instability in credit markets that \nmay  result  in  a  shortfall  in  budget  financing  needs.  The  PESF \ncomplements  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Development  Policy  Loan  and  ADB\u2019s \nDevelopment  Policy  Support  Program  series,  which  reflect \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to reforms over the medium term. \n \nUnder  the  best  case  scenario  where  the  Government  meets  all  of  its \nfinancing  targets  from  market  sources,  in  which  global  financial \nconditions  do  not  deteriorate  substantially  and  approval  of  the  PESF \nsends a strong positive market signal, no withdrawal would be expected \nunder the PESF. Under a second scenario, in which market conditions \n\n\f \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \n\niii \n\nremain tight and the drawdown triggers set out in the financing plan are \nmet,  the  Government  may  exercise  its  options  to  access  the  PESF \nfunds. Under a third scenario, in which there is a sharp deterioration in \nglobal  financial  markets,  creating  macroeconomic  instability  and/or  a \nbalance-of-payments  crisis,  the  PESF  is  unlikely  to  be  effective  and \nIndonesia will needs crisis mitigation support. \n \nThe  PESF  will  (i)  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  mobilize  funds \nfrom  commercial  markets  by  capitalizing  on  the  expected  confidence \ncreated by the PESF support package, and (ii) serve as a precautionary \nmeasure  to  provide  additional  financing  to  the  Government  for  the \nlarger  fiscal  stimulus  now  needed.  The  policy  actions  are  designed  to \naccomplish the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nReassure \nfinancial \nfinancial  markets  and  maintain \nsystem  stability  by  enhancing  the  financial  safety  net; \nmaintain  stability  of  the  banking  system;  and  ensure \npredictability in the Government\u2019s financing requirements \nfor 2009 and 2010.  \nSustain  critical  public  expenditures  while  maintaining \nbudget  discipline  to  mitigate  the  poverty  impacts  of  the \ngrowth  slowdown  through  strengthening  coordination  of \nnational poverty reduction efforts; establishing a national \npoverty monitoring and response system; and increasing \ncritical  public  expenditures  in  poverty  alleviation,  social \nprotection, \nand \ndevelopment. This will be done by undertaking actions to \nspeed  up  budget  disbursement,  by  improving  efficiency \nadvance \nin \nprocurement,  and  carrying  over  unspent  cash  from  the \n2008 budget. \nCrowd  in  private  investment  and  support  exports  by \nrevising the implementing decree for the new investment \nlaw, improving transparency in revenues from extractive \nindustries, and enhancing access to trade finance. \n\ninfrastructure  maintenance \n\ndisbursements, \n\npromoting \n\nbudget \n\nand \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nA loan of $1,000,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility for the PESF Program. The loan will have a 15-year term \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft program loan agreement.   \n \nThe  PESF  program  period  will  be  from  1  September  2008,  when  the \nglobal  financial  crisis  erupted,  to  31  December  2010,  with  a  single \ntranche loan of $1,000,000,000 to be disbursed in phased withdrawals \nwhen  the  Government  has  met  the  policy  actions  set  out  in  the  policy \nmatrix and the drawdown triggers set out in its financing plan.  \n \nThe  Government  will  use \nfunds \ngenerated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures  and \n\nlocal  currency  counterpart \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\fiv \niv \n\n \nExecuting Agency  \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \n\nassociated  costs  of  reforms,  and  to  help  maintain  current  social \nexpenditure and infrastructure spending. \n \nCoordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA)  \n \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF),  Ministry of Trade (MOT), Coordinating \nMinistry  for  Social  Welfare  (CMSW),  and  National  Development  and \nPlanning Agency (BAPPENAS) are the Implementing Agencies. CMEA, \nas  the  Executing  Agency,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  program \nimplementation  activities  and  coordination  and  reporting  to ADB;  it  will \nbe supported by the Implementing Agencies (MOF, MOT, CMSW, and \nBAPPENAS).  The  Government  has  established  a  program  steering \ncommittee  to  implement  the  Government\u2019s  financing  plan,  chaired  by \nthe  director  general  of  the  Debt  Management  Office  (MOF),  and \ncomprising  representatives  from  CMEA,  MOF,  and  BAPPENAS,  and \nrepresentatives  of  each  development  partner  cofinancing  the  PESF. \nThe  program  steering  committee  will  meet  in  the  first  week  of  each \nquarter  to  review  implementation  of  the  financing  plan  and  determine \nthe  Government\u2019s  financing  shortfalls.  CMEA  will  be  responsible  for \nday-to-day  program  implementation  activities,  and  will  report  on \nimplementation progress. \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n \nThe  PESF  will  provide  significant  benefits  and  have  a  positive  impact \non the Government\u2019s fiscal situation as it will do the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  Government \n\nto  mobilize  resources \n\nAllow \nfrom \ncommercial  markets  by  capitalizing  on  the  expected \nconfidence  created  by  the  PESF  support  package  by \nreassuring  financial  markets  and  maintaining  financial \nsystem stability, thereby reducing the Government\u2019s cost \nof borrowing from the market.  \nEnsure  that  the  Government  can  meet  its  financing \nrequirements  of  its  fiscal  budget  and  any  additional \nstimulus  required  if  the  economic  slowdown  is  sharper \nthan expected. \nEnsure that the Government can maintain its momentum \nits  medium-term  development \ntoward  achieving \nobjectives  while  managing  the  negative  impacts  of  the \ninternational  credit  crunch  on  Indonesia\u2019s  access  to \ncredit  markets  and \nthe  economic  slowdown  by \n(a) reassuring financial markets and maintaining financial \nsystem stability, (b) mitigating the poverty impacts of the \ncritical  public \ngrowth \n\nslowdown, \n\nsustaining \n\n(c) \n\n\f \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\nv \n\nexpenditures  while  maintaining  budget  discipline,  and \n(d) crowding \ninvestment  and  supporting \nexports. \n\nin  private \n\n \n \nThe  PESF  is  firmly  embedded  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium  Term \nDevelopment  Plan  2004\u22122009  and  complements  ADB\u2019s  Development \nPolicy  Support  Program  loan  series,  cofinanced  with  the  World  Bank. \nThe assumptions underlying the PESF include the following:  \n  \n\nContinued  strong  commitment  for  reforms  supported  by \nWorld  Bank  and  ADB  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram series. \nThe global economy stabilizes from the financial crisis.  \n\n \nHowever, the PESF has risks: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nis  a \n\ninternational \n\nExternal  vulnerabilities.  The  external  risks  remain  high, \nespecially  during  a  period  of  global  financial  turmoil  and \nuncertainty and the ongoing international credit crunch, as \nwell  as  the  emerging  second  round  effects  of  a  sharp \nfinancially  open \neconomic  slowdown. \nIndonesia \neconomy  and \nforeign  holdings, \nthere  are  significant \nespecially  in  the  stock  market  and  government  bonds. \nIndonesia  continues  to  be  vulnerable  to  shifts  in  investor \nliquidity needs, as deleveraging proceeds in North America \nand Europe. If significant funds are pulled back because of \nliquidity  demands  by  investors  in  these  areas  and/or \nincreased emerging market risk aversion, this could lead to \nincreased  pressure  on \nreserves  and/or \nexchange rates, as well as on the domestic money market. \nIn  addition,  the  Government  has  large  gross  financing \nneeds  over  the  next  few  years,  and  tighter  credit  markets \nand increased risk aversion could severely limit its ability to \ntap  international  financial  markets.  This  could  force  the \nGovernment  to  cut  budgetary  outlays  to  maintain  fiscal \nbalance  even  after  full  access  to  the  PESF,  with  adverse \nconsequences  for  infrastructure  and  social  expenditure. \nMitigating \nthese  risks  will  require  solid  cooperation \nbetween  the  central  bank  and  the  economic  ministries  to \nreassure bondholders that their investments are safe while \nenhancing  efforts  to  crowd  in  private  investment  to  the \nextent  possible  through  the  reforms  supported  by  the \nPESF. \nSharp economic slowdown. The Government revised its \ngrowth projection from 6.0% to 5.0% in January and again \nto  4.5%  in  March  2009  as  the  economy  deteriorated.  The \ngrowth  projections  are  likely  to  be  revised  downward  as \nmore  evidence  emerges  of  the  magnitude  of  the  global \neconomic  slowdown  over  the  next  several  weeks.  This \nfurther \nwould  affect  revenue  collections  and  require \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nrevisions to the 2009 budget and financing plan. The PESF \nprovides  fiscal  flexibility  by  providing  for  further  fiscal \nexpansion as allowed for in the agreed financing plan.  \nFiduciary constraints. Notwithstanding the improvements \nthere  are  continuing  concerns  regarding \nunder  way, \nutilization  of  public  resources.  The  overall \nfiduciary \nassessments  undertaken  since  2001  (with  the  Country \nFinancial  Accountability  Assessment)  have \nindicated \nconsiderable improvements in the fiduciary environment in \nIndonesia  (Appendix  8).  Ongoing  programs  supported  by \nseveral development partners provide significant technical \nassistance  support  to  strengthen  fiduciary  governance. \nstrengthening  budgetary \ninclusion  of \nThe  PESF \nprocedures  and  controls,  accompanied  by \nincreased \ntransparency  in  financial  management,  will  significantly \nenhance transparency. \nLegislative  and  presidential  elections  in  2009.  The \nGovernment remains committed to sustaining its economic \nreform agenda despite the global economic recession, the \ninternational  credit  crunch,  and  general  elections  next \ntime \nyear.  Unfortunately,  elections  often  reduce \nhorizons  of  politicians,  leading  them  to  avoid  new  policy \ninitiatives in the pre-election period and  \nshifting  their \nfocus \nto  populist  short-term  measures.  This  could \nundermine  the  reform  agenda  supported  by  the  PESF. \nConversely,  the  prospect  of  elections  could  spur  political \naction  into  ensuring  that  critical  government  expenditures \nand accompanying reforms are undertaken to demonstrate \na  continued  and  clear  record  of  accomplishments.  The \nProgram  guards  against  reversals  in  the  policy  actions  by \nlinking  scheduled  withdrawals  of  the  loan  amount  to \nmaintaining  the  program  measures  and  broad  objectives \nintact. \n\nthe \n\nvi \nvi \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nfor $1,000,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia under the Public Expenditure Support Facility \nProgram. The program design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nThe Request for a Public Expenditure Support Facility \n\n2. \nThe  proposed  Public  Expenditure  Support  Facility  (PESF)  comes  at  a  critical  time  for \nIndonesia and is designed to maintain the momentum of Indonesia\u2019s key development efforts at \na  time  of  global  financial  market  crisis  and  most  likely  the  sharpest  slowdown  in  the  global \neconomy  since  World  War  II.  Like  many  other  developing  economies,  Indonesia  has  had  to \ncope with the first round effects of the turmoil and crisis of confidence that have disrupted the \nglobal  financial  system  in  the  last  7  months  and  effectively  froze  Indonesia\u2019s  access  to \ncommercial  debt  markets  at  the  end  of  2008.  Coming  into  the  global  crisis,  Indonesia\u2019s \nmacroeconomic performance was impressive. The economy was expanding at about 6% in the \nfirst three quarters of 2008, its highest growth rate since the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998. \nThe  primary  budget  has  been  in  surplus  for  the  last  3  years  and  its  overall  deficit  for  2008  is \nestimated at 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) on the back of strong revenue growth and a \nreduction in fuel subsidies. Indonesia\u2019s debt\u2013GDP ratio continuously declined from 55% in 2004 \nto 35% in 2007, and dropped further to 33% by the end of 2008.  \n \nThe  global  turmoil  in  financial  markets  since  September  2008  has  adversely  and \n3. \nsignificantly affected Indonesia\u2019s financial markets from the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2008 until now \nin  two  ways:  (i)  balance  sheet  deleveraging  in  the  United  States  (US)  caused  investors  to \nunbundle financial portfolios in Indonesia, leading to some capital flight; and (ii) the global credit \ncrunch  has  made  it  expensive  for  both  Indonesia\u2019s  public  and  private  sector  to  access \ninternational  debt  markets.  Indonesia  is  preparing  for  the  second  round  effects  of  a  sharp \nslowdown in global economic growth on its economy and potentially continued tight liquidity in \n2009.  The  economies  of  Indonesia\u2019s  major  trading  partners  have  entered  recession.  Global \ntrade contracted in Q4 2008, the first time since 1982. Indonesia\u2019s export growth is expected to \nbe negative in the first half of 2009 because of the fall in global demand and commodity prices. \nIn  addition,  the  global  credit  crisis  has  resulted  in  US  dollar  shortages  that  have  affected  the \ncost  of  trade  financing  and  investment  flows.  There  is  now  a  consensus  in  the  international \ncommunity  that  countries  should  operate  counter-cyclical  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  to \nmitigate the worst effects of the financial crisis on the real economy. With lessons learned from \nthe  1998  financial  crisis,  the  Government  has  revised  the  2009  budget  to  include  a  fiscal \nstimulus  package  of  Rp73.2  trillion  ($6.8  billion,  1.3%  of  GDP).  As  a  result  of  these  budget \nchanges,  the  2009  budget  deficit  has  been  revised  from  1.0%  of  GDP  to  2.5%,  and  its  gross \nfinancing requirements from Rp170.5 trillion to Rp271.4 trillion. The Government recognizes that \nadditional fiscal stimulus may be necessary if the domestic economy slows further in the coming \nmonths.   \n \n4. \nIn  the  context  of  the  first  round  effects,  the  Government  asked  the  World  Bank  in \nSeptember  2008  to  provide  a  PESF  of  $2  billion  and  to  facilitate  financing  of  an  additional \n$3 billion\u2013$4 billion from other development partners. The Government has stated it intends to \nexercise  this  financing  only  under  certain  circumstances  set  out  in  its  financing  plan,  such  as \ndifficulties  in  accessing  credit  markets  (para.  8).  The  World  Bank  agreed,  and  shortly  after \nSeptember  2008  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Government  of  Australia,  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nGovernment  of  Japan  agreed  to  join  the  PESF.  The  request  for  financing  stemmed  from \nconcerns about Indonesia\u2019s ability to meet its gross financing needs\u2014which will be high in the \nnext  2  years  because  of  the  maturity  structure  and  servicing  costs  of  its  existing  debt\u2014if  the \ncurrent  global  liquidity  crisis  does  not  ease  significantly  over  the  next  6\u201312  months.  The \nGovernment  is  also  concerned  about  ensuring  predictability  in  its  budget  financing,  given  the \nnecessity for a fiscal stimulus. Therefore, the PESF serves two purposes: (i) to encourage the \nGovernment  to  first  mobilize  resources  from  commercial  markets  by  capitalizing  on  the \nexpected confidence created by the PESF support; and (ii) to serve as a precautionary measure \nto provide additional financing to the Government for its larger fiscal stimulus in the event it can \nnot be fully funded from market financing. The Government believes that the announcement of a \nsupport package, backed up by a program of confidence-boosting policy measures, would send \na  strong  positive  signal  to  the  markets,  making  it  more  likely  that  Indonesia  would  meet  its \ncommercial market borrowing targets for 2009.   \n \nB. \n\nThe Government and Its Development Strategy \n\nThe PESF supports the Government\u2019s development agenda as articulated in its Medium-\n5. \nTerm  National  Development  Plan  2004\u20132009  (RPJM).  The  RPJM  includes  the  eight  medium-\nterm  development  goals  that  provide  an  overarching  framework,  placing  human  development \nand poverty reduction at the center of the development agenda. The Government\u2019s annual work \nplan  (RKP),  approved  each  year  by  the  Cabinet,  guides  RPJM  implementation.  The  RKP  for \n2009 importantly revises the poverty target to 12%\u201314% from 15.4% in March 2008, given the \nintractable  nature  of  poverty  and  the  slow  progress  in  defeating  poverty  until  more  inclusive \ngrowth had been developed during the last several years. As a consequence, the RKP for 2009 \ncontinues  with  the  following  three  priority  areas:  (i)  providing  basic  services  and  alleviating \npoverty by developing rural areas, focusing on education services, health and family planning, \nand rural infrastructure; (ii) accelerating and improving the quality of growth through enhanced \neconomic  stability  and  resilience  supported  by  the  development  of  agriculture,  infrastructure, \nand energy sectors; and (iii) enhancing anticorruption measures, including through bureaucracy \nreform. Of these, the focus areas on poverty alleviation, education services, economic growth, \nand  economic  stability  relate  to  the  core  policy  areas  of  the  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram 1  (DPSP)  series;  ADB\u2019s  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program 2 \naddresses the focus area on infrastructure development. These interrelated programs in support \nof  the  RPJM  are  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  purpose  of  the  proposed  PESF  is  to  preserve  this \ndevelopment  momentum  as  Indonesia  encounters  and  manages  the  fiscal  externalities  of  the \ninternational credit crunch. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2008.

The DPSP \nseries aims to advance Indonesia\u2019s longer-term institutional reform agenda and focuses on the \nmany  important  but  often  incremental  steps  that  need  to  be  taken  to  realize  this  long-term \nagenda  (Appendix  8),  whereas  the  PESF  Program  implements  measures  that  deal  with  the \ncurrent situation. The PESF focuses on a subset of the policy areas covered under the DPSP \nplus some additional ones (financial sector stability, macroeconomic stability, and trade finance). \nThese are areas in which further policy action is important as part of a proactive response to the \nadverse  current  situation  and  likely  future  stresses,  e.g.,  the  need  to  take  proactive  steps  to \nmaintain critical public expenditures and reassure investors given the current situation and the \npotential severity of the expected growth slowdown in 2009.  \n \nC. \n\nThe Government and its Development Partners \n\nof \n\nfeatures \n\nthe  PESF \n\nContingent  Program  Approach.  Key \n\n7. \nThe PESF, structured as a single tranche loan with scheduled and multiple withdrawals \ncontingent on certain conditions set out under the Government\u2019s financing plan being met during \nthe  program  period,  aims  to  help  the  Government  continue  to  maintain  its  MDGs  of  higher \neconomic growth, lower unemployment, and reduction of poverty as articulated in its RKP\u2014at a \ncritical  time  of  global  financial  market  failure  and  recession,  as  highlighted  in  its  development \npolicy  letter  (Appendix  2).  To  achieve  the  program  goals,  the  PESF  does  the  following:  (i)  it \nimplements  a  series  of  policy  measures  designed  to  boost  market  confidence  in  Indonesia\u2019s \nfinancial sector, improve budget efficiency, and mitigate the increased risks and vulnerabilities \nto  the  domestic  economy\u2014to  allow  the  Government  to  mobilize  resources  from  commercial \nmarkets by capitalizing on the expected confidence created by the PESF support package; and \n(ii) with consensus from development partners, the Program supports the Government\u2019s larger \nfiscal stimulus.  \n  \n8. \n(i)  a  single  tranche  loan  with  scheduled  and  multiple  withdrawals;  (ii)  a  small  number  of  high-\nimpact policy measures designed to address the adverse impacts of the ongoing financial crisis \ncompleted  prior  to  consideration  by  the  Board;  (iii)  a  financing  plan  for  the  Government\u2019s \nprojected  gross  financing  needs  for  2009,  including  projected  commercial  borrowings  in  the \ndomestic and international markets; and (iv) withdrawals of the loan amount to be made when \nthe drawdown triggers set in the Government\u2019s financing plan are met (paras. 40\u201342) and the \npolicy  measures  introduced  under  the  Program  continue  to  remain  in  place.  In  this  way,  the \nPESF  Program  mirrors  features  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PESF  parallel  cofinancing  loan  of  a \ndevelopment policy loan with a deferred drawdown option whereby subsequent withdrawals of \nthe  single  tranche  loan  are  contingent  on  the  drawdown  triggers  set  out  in  the  financing  plan \nbeing  met.  Under  the  best  case  scenario  where  the  Government  meets  all  of  its  financing \ntargets  from  market  sources,  in  which  the  global  financial  conditions  do  not  deteriorate \nsubstantially  and  approval  of  the  PESF  sends  a  strong  positive  market  signal,  no  withdrawal \nwould  be  expected  under  the  PESF.  Under  a  second  scenario,  in  which  the  market  condition \nremains tight and the drawdown triggers set out in the financing plan are met, the Government \ncan exercise its options to access the PESF funds. Under a third scenario, in which there is a \nsharp  deterioration  in  the  global  financial  market  creating  macroeconomic  instability  and/or  a \nbalance-of-payments  crisis,  the  PESF  is  unlikely  to  be  effective  and  Indonesia  will  need  crisis \nmitigation support. \n  \nGovernment and Development Partner Coordination. The PESF loan is a joint effort \n9. \nof  the  Government  and  development  partners  to  support  a  common  policy  agenda  and  broad \nfinancing  plan.  The  PESF  reflects  a  proactive  policy  response  by  the  Government  to  mitigate \n\ninclude  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nthe increased vulnerabilities and risks to the Indonesian financial sector and domestic economy \nfrom  the  recent  global  turmoil  in  financial  markets,  as  well  as  development  partners\u2019 \ncommitment  to  provide  Indonesia  with  fiscal  resources  to  support  program  implementation \nincluding the financing plan. The PESF also reflects the Government\u2019s commitment to its longer-\nterm  reform  agenda,  both  within  and  outside  the  World  Bank\u2019s  DPL  series  and  ADB\u2019s \ncofinanced  DPSP  series,  by  helping  to  accelerate  necessary  reforms  under  the  DPL/DPSP \nreform agenda. The Government\u2019s financing plan includes three lending modalities to address \ndifferent  dimensions  of  the  financial  crisis  on  the  Indonesian  economy,  while  supporting  a \ncommon  set  of  objectives  of  the  PESF  as  a  contingent  program.  The  modalities  include  (i)  a \nnoncontingent program loan, (ii) a loan facility contingent on shortfalls in budget financing and \nwhen  the  drawdown  triggers  set  in  the  financing  plan  are  met,  and  (iii)  guarantees  of \nGovernment of Indonesia sovereign debt. Option (ii) aims to address financing shortfalls arising \nfrom difficulties in accessing international and domestic credit markets. Option (iii) is designed to \nenhance  the  Government\u2019s  access  to  international  bond  markets,  lower  its  interest  costs,  and \ndiversify its funding sources. The development  partners are providing a mix of options (ii) and \n(iii).  The  World  Bank  approved  its  contingent  loan  of  $2.0  billion  on  3  March  2009,  the \nGovernment  of  Japan  has  approved  $1.5  billion  in  a  combination  of  loan  guarantees  and \ncontingent  loans,  ADB  has  proposed  to  provide  a  contingent  loan  of  $1.0  billion,  and  the \nGovernment of Australia has committed to a contingent loan of $1.0 billion to the PESF (and is \ncurrently in the process of completing the legal requirement of its lending modality). \n \n10. \nThe  PESF  Program  has  a  number  of  important  features.  First,  it  is  fully  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda  and  this  promotes  full  ownership.  Second,  the  policy  measures \nspecifically address the increased vulnerabilities and risks to the domestic economy emanating \nfrom the global financial turmoil based on lessons learned from the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial \ncrisis.  In  this  way,  it  is  not  overloaded  with  reform  measures  but  rather  complements  the \nDPSP/DPL  series  that  focuses  on  a  more  comprehensive  and  longer-term  institutional  reform \nagenda.  Third,  the  PESF  encourages  the  Government  to  first  access  commercial  markets  for \nfinancing  by  embedding  the  Government\u2019s  financing  plan  in  the  PESF  Program,  including \ntargets for bond issuances. In this way, the PESF would not distort the Government\u2019s incentives \nto  source  financing  from  credit  markets.  At  the  same  time,  the  PESF  recognizes  that  the \nGovernment  needs  to  conduct  fiscal  stimulus  and  it  may  be  unrealistic  for  the  Government  to \nfinance  the  entire  stimulus  through  commercial  borrowings  as  this  may  crowd  out  Indonesian \ncorporations\u2019  commercial  borrowings  with  an  adverse  impact  on  investment.  Fourth,  designed \nas  a  single  tranche  loan  with  scheduled  withdrawals  during  the  program  period  contingent  on \nmeeting  the  withdrawal  triggers  set  out  in  the  Government\u2019s  financing  plan,  it  encourages \ncontinuous  engagement  by  the  development  partners  during  the  current  adverse  economic \nenvironment.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nA. \n\nRecent Economic Developments and the Impacts of the Global Financial Crisis \n\nIndonesia  enjoyed \n\n11.  Macroeconomic  Performance. \nits  best  macroeconomic \nperformance in 2007 and 2008 (Appendix 4). Up until September 2008, it was able to withstand \nthe  negative  impacts  from  the  global  crisis  thanks  to  prudent  macroeconomic  policy,  a \nstrengthened  financial  sector,  and  protective  levels  of  foreign  exchange  reserves  (Table  1). \nEconomic  growth  accelerated  to  a  10-year  high  of  6.3%  in  2007.  Despite  unstable  global \nfinancial  markets  and  a  slowing  world  economy,  Indonesia  did  not  experience  a  growth \nslowdown  in  the  first  half  of  2008  and  economic  growth  remained  respectable  at  6.1%  in  Q3 \n2008.  The  overall  budget  deficit  was  low  by  international  standards  at  1.3%  of  GDP  in  2007. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nTotal  tax  revenues  in  the  first  10  months  of  2008  were  about  50%  higher  than  during  the \nequivalent period in 2007 and this increase appears to be broadly based. This, with significant \nexpenditure adjustments to curb subsidies, reduced the budget deficit further to 0.1% of GDP in \n2008.  With  continued  fiscal  discipline,  Indonesia  has  achieved  the  most  dramatic  decline  in \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio of any major economy in Southeast Asia. Indonesia\u2019s debt\u2013GDP ratio declined \nsignificantly  from  55%  in  2004  to  35%  in  2007  and  dropped  further  to  33%  by  end  of  2008. \nBalance  of  payments  recorded  a  respectable  surplus  of  2.4%  of  GDP  in  2007  and  remained \nreasonably robust in the first half of 2008. Indonesia continued to accumulate foreign reserves \nthrough the first half of 2008, peaking at $60 billion in the middle of the year. \n \n\nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators for Indonesia, 2003\u20132008 \n\n2003 \n\n1,050 \n4.8 \n3.8 \n3.8 \n6.4 \n\n \nItem \nA.

After  experiencing  double-digit  inflation  in  2005  and  2006,  inflation  in \nIndonesia  fell  to  6.4%  in  2007.  The  unexpected  surge  in  international  food  and  energy  prices \nearly in 2008 resulted in higher domestic inflation in 2008. Inflation peaked at 12% in Q3 2008 \nfollowing the tightening of monetary policy and falling commodity prices as the global economy \nstarted  to  show  recessionary  conditions.  Inflation  reached  11%  at  the  end  of  2008.

The turmoil in financial markets intensified in September 2008 \nfollowing the failure of important financial institutions in the US, which froze interbank and credit \nmarkets  around  the  world  and  pushed  the  price  of  risk  upward,  triggering  a  global  liquidity \nshortage  worldwide.  One  indicator  to  illustrate  the  financial  stress  is  the  spread  between  the             \n3-month  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  and  the  3-month  overnight  index  swap  (OIS). \nWhile  LIBOR  measures  the  market's  anticipation  of  monetary  policy,  plus  a  risk  premium,  the \nOIS  measures  what  the  markets  expect  the  US  Federal  Reserve  funds  rate  to  be  over  the  3-\nmonth period comparable to the 3-month LIBOR. Thus, the spread between LIBOR and the OIS \ncaptures  risks  perceptions  in  the  credit  markets  and  closely  tracks  the  breakdown  in  key \nfinancial markets.3 As shown in Figure 2(a), the LIBOR\u2013OIS spread before July 2007 was stable \nat  around  10  basis  points.  The  start  of  the  subprime  mortgage  elevated  risk  perceptions,  and \nthe  failure  of  important  financial  institutions  in  the  US  and  uncertainty  intensified  the  crisis  in \nSeptember  2008,  pushing  the  spread  to  over  350  basis  points.  While  the  LIBOR\u2013OIS  spread \nhas  declined  significantly,  the  interbank  market  remains  dysfunctional.  Much  of  the  liquidity \nsupplied  by  the  central  bank  to  commercial  banks  now  ends  up  back  in  the  central  banks, \nreflecting  continuing  worries  about  counterparty  concerns  and  uncertainty  surrounding  the \namount needed to fund future assets.4  \n \n\nFigure 2: Financial Crisis in the United States \n(a)The LIBOR-OIS Spread 2006\u20132009 (bps)             (b) Emerging Market Bond Financing ($ billion)  \n\n80\n\n250\n\n200\n\n350\n\n300\n\n400\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbps = basis points, LIBOR = London interbank offered rate, OIS = Overnight Index Swap. \nSources: Bloomberg, Dealogic, and International Monetary Fund.  \n\n0\nJan-\n06\n\nMay-\n07\n\nMay-\n06\n\nMay-\n08\n\nSep-\n07\n\nSep-\n08\n\nSep-\n06\n\nJan-\n07\n\nJan-\n09\n\nJan-\n08\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n40\n\n50\n\n20\n\n10\n\n30\n\n60\n\n70\n\n0\n\nQ106 Q206 Q306 Q406 Q107 Q207 Q307 Q407 Q108 Q208 Q308 Q408\n\nPublic Corporate\n\n \nThe  drying  up  of  liquidity,  continued  deleveraging,  and  heightened  risk  aversion  have \n14. \ndeepened the withdrawal of capital from developing member countries and caused the cost of \ncapital  to  rise.  As  shown  in  Figure  2(b),  lending  to  emerging  markets  has  dropped  sharply. \nEmerging  bond  markets  were  virtually  shut  down  for  a  period  in  Q4  2008.  Corporations  are \nexpected  to  tap  banks  for  shorter-term  loans,  raising  rollover  risks  further.  Capital  markets \nremained  reluctant  to  lend  because  of  potentially  large  rollover  risks  and  the  challenges  the \ncorporations  face  ahead  resulting  from  the  economic  slowdown.  The  Institute  of  International \nFinance estimated that net private capital flow to emerging economies declined to $467 billion in \n2008\u2014about half of the 2007 level\u2014and forecasts a sharp decline to $165 billion for 2009.5 The \n                                                 \n3   The LIBOR-OIS measure is clearly tracked by the other measures of liquidity and credit risk, all of which indicate a \nsimilar pattern and timing in the resulting breakdown of financial markets.

(January). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nbreakdown  in  financial  markets  has  hit  investment  and  production,  pushed  the  world\u2019s  major \neconomies into recession, and reduced international trade with knock-on effects on developing \nmember countries. \n \nFinancial  Sector  Repercussions.  Large  and  negative  impacts  on  the  Indonesian \n15. \neconomy  emerged  in  October  2008  resulting  from  Indonesia\u2019s  relatively  open  capital  account \nand  significant  foreign  ownership  of  the  country\u2019s  bond  and  stock  markets  (Figure  3).  These \nimpacts  were  manifested  in  a  number  of  forms:  (i)  the  stock  market  declined  by  31%  during \nOctober 2008, (ii) yields on medium-term domestic bonds increased by nearly 400 basis points, \n(iii) Indonesia\u2019s international bond spreads surged by about 650 basis points, and (iv) the rupiah \ndepreciated by 17% against the US dollar. In addition, the Government lost almost $7 billion of \nits international reserves during the same month\u2014falling to $50.6 billion at end of October. The \ndirect effect of the global crisis on Indonesia\u2019s banking system has been minor because of lack \nof direct investment in the troubled US assets. However, the indirect impacts on the Indonesian \nfinancial  sector  have  been  significant.  Two  major  impacts  are  as  follows:  (i)  liquidity  in  the \nbanking system has been very tight since September because of a rapid increase in domestic \nlending of about 30%, in part attributable to the squeeze on US dollar lines, and capital outflow; \nand  (ii) elevated  risk  perceptions  about  the  Indonesian  financial  sector  and  economy  have \nlimited  Indonesia\u2019s  access  to  international  credit  markets  and  raised  the  cost  of  borrowing. \nIndonesia  has  experienced  portfolio  outflows,  reflecting  the  deteriorating  financial  positions \nabroad. By the end of December 2008, the Indonesian stock exchange had fallen by over 50% \nsince the start of the year, typical of other markets in the region. Government debt markets have \nbeen hit especially hard by the widening global crisis, with yields on both rupiah and US dollar \nbonds  rising  sharply  (Figure  3).  The  yields  on  Indonesian  domestic  bonds  remained  elevated \nand rose more sharply than elsewhere in the region in September and October 2008. The yields \nrecovered  somewhat  in  November  as  sales  by  foreign  bondholders  slowed,  but  the  market \nremains fragile and bond yields remain more than one-third above their levels in July 2008. \n \nFiscal Impact. Government finances have been especially vulnerable to spikes in global \n16. \nrisk  aversion  and  contagion  from  external  markets  because  of  the  country\u2019s  large  gross \nfinancing needs and the need for a fiscal stimulus. The term structure of Indonesia\u2019s bonds led \nto sharply higher debt issuances in 2007 and 2008, and amortization is projected to remain at \nhigh  levels  through  2011.  During  normal  market  conditions,  Indonesia  was  able  to  raise  a \nsufficient amount of more than $12 billion from domestic and international markets in both 2007 \nand  2008  (Table  2-page  10).  However,  tighter  global  liquidity  and  higher  risk  premiums \ncombined  with  high  gross  financing  needs  has  raised  interest  rates  on  Indonesian  debt \ncompared with other economies in the region. With prohibitive yields on domestic and US dollar \nbonds,  the  Government  could  not  access  funds  from  the  credit  markets  in  Q4  2008,  raising \nconcerns about possible budget financing constraints in 2009 (Figure 3 [e]). \n \nGovernment\u2019s  Policy  Response.  The  Government  has  taken  a  number  of  proactive \n17. \nmeasures aimed at reducing the likelihood of further disruption, and maintaining the confidence \nand stability of the financial system. Key measures include the following: (i) establishment of a \nfinancial safety net regulation that clearly establishes the roles, responsibilities, and procedures \nthat  govern  the  actions  and  responses  of  Bank  Indonesia,  the  minister  of  finance,  and  the \nDeposit Insurance Corporation in the event of the failure of a financial institution; (ii) the central \nbank  strengthened  its  lender  of  last  resort  facility;  (iii)  increased  coverage  of  the  deposit \ninsurance  scheme;  and  (iv)  the  central  bank  eased  liquidity  in  the  banking  sector  through \nmonetary  expansion  (paras.  37\u201338).  With  these  measures  in  place,  some  indicators  have \nshown signs of improvement, although it is still too early to be certain that this will be sustained. \nThe  stock  market  and  the  rupiah  have  stabilized  since  November  2008  and  the  international \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nreserves  position  has  remained  sufficient  at  around  $55  billion  at  the  end  of  March  2009. \nInflation  declined  to  7.9%  in  March  2009  and  is  expected  to  decline  further  in  the  first  half  of \n2009.  While  significant  amounts  of  external  capital  have  already  been  withdrawn  from  the \ncountry\u2019s financial markets, Indonesia remains vulnerable to further foreign capital outflows and \ndomestic capital flight. \n \n\n \nFigure 3:  Impacts of Global Financial Crisis in Indonesia \n \n\n(b) Rupiah Exchange Rate \n\nJan-09\n\nJan-08\n\nApr-08\n\nJul-08\n\nOct-08\n\nJan-09\n\n(d) Spreads on US Dollar Sovereign Bonds \n\n2500\n\n2000\n\n \n3000\n\n         (a) Indonesia's Stock Market Index \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nOct-08\n\nJan-08\n\nApr-08\n\nJul-08\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n \n(c) Domestic Currencies Bond Yields \n\n  \n\nIndonesia\n\nPhilippines\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n13000\n\n12000\n\n \n\n11000\n\n10000\n\n9000\n\n8000\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\nJan-08\n\n \n\nIndonesia USD Bond \nStripped Spreads\n\nIndonesia's difference w ith \nSE Asia Average\n\nThailand\n\n0\nJan-08 Mar-08 May-08 Jul-08 Sep-08 Nov-08 Jan-09 Mar-09\n\nMar-08\n\nMay-08\n\nJul-08\n\nSep-08\n\nNov-08\n\nJan-09\n\nMar-09\n\n    (e) Rupiah Bond Issuance 2007\u20132009 (Rp trillion) \n\n(f) Foreign Owned Rupiah Bond (Rp trillion) \n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n25\n\n100\n\n120\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSources: Ministry of Finance, World Bank, JP.

Domestic market liquidity has started to ease since January 2009. After a lull \n18. \nof  3  months,  the  Government  reentered  the  domestic  market  for  selling  government  bonds.  It \nsuccessfully raised about Rp9.2 trillion in bonds in January and again Rp4.8 trillion in February. \nIt  also  reentered  international  credit  markets  and  raised  $2  billion  in  10-year  bonds  and \n$1 billion  in  5-year  bonds  in  February  2009.  While  recent  developments  are  encouraging,  the \nGovernment  projects  that  market  conditions  will  be  more  difficult  for  the  rest  of  the  year.  In \naddition,  the  maturities  structure  of  the  recent  domestic  issuance  was  skewed  toward  1-year \nbonds,  indicating  that  elevated  risk  and  tight  liquidity  in  the  domestic  financial  sector  remains. \nAs  Figure  4  shows,  prior  to  the  global  crisis  bonds  with  maturity  above  3  years  accounted  for \n80% of the total volume of bond issuances. In January 2009, the structure was reversed with 1-\nyear  bonds  accounting  for  60%  and  maturity  above  3  years  accounting  for  20%  of  total \nissuances. This will elevate rollover risk and budget financing pressures over the next 2 years. \nThe issuance of international bonds was also at relatively high cost, with yields more than 800 \nbasis points above comparable US treasury bills.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nFigure 4: Government Bond Issuance by Tenor \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 year\n20%\n\nAbove10 year\n43%\n\nAbove 5 to 0 year\n1%\n\n  (b) Global Crisis \n       (issuances in January 2009) \n\n   (a) Pre-Global Crisis \n        (issuances during January 2007\u2013August 2008) \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNote:  The  Government  issues  rupiah-denominated  bonds  with  the  following  maturities:  1  year,  2  years,  3  years,  5 \nyears, 7 years, 10 years, 15 years, and 30 years. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\nAbove 5 to 0 year\n14%\n\nAbove 3 to 5 year\n11%\n\nAbove 3 to 5 year\n36%\n\n3 year\n12%\n\n3 year\n3%\n\n1 year\n60%\n\n19. \nThe Second Round Effects of the Global Crisis. The condition of the global economy \ndeteriorated markedly in Q4 2008, with economic indicators in all major developed economies \npointing toward a severe downward and broad-based real-economy adjustment. New economic \ndata  on  the  global  economy  released  in  March  2009  point  to  a  much  deeper  and  most  likely \nprotracted recession in several of Indonesia\u2019s major trading partners not seen since after World \nWar  II.  The economies of  the  US, United  Kingdom  (UK),  and  Japan contracted in  Q3  and  Q4 \n2008 (Figure 5), with the US economy contracting by 6.3% in Q4 2008 on a year-on-year basis. \nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s economy contracted by 3.6% in Q4 2008. Singapore\u2019s economy, a bell-\nweather for the Southeast Asia exports industry, contracted by 4.2% in Q4 2008 on a year-on-\nyear basis; and its government projects that GDP will contract 6%\u20139% in 2009.6 Global trade is \nprojected  to  contract  in  2009  for  the  first  time  in  27  years.  The  International  Monetary  Fund \n(IMF)7 again revised its forecasts in January 2009 and suggested that global growth would fall to \n0.5% in 2009 from 3.8% in 2008. Against uncertainties in the financial markets, activities in the \nadvanced  economies  are  expected  to  contract  by  2%.  Economic  growth  in  emerging  and \ndeveloping economies is also expected to slow sharply to 3.2% from 6.2% in 2008 because of \nfalling export demand, lower commodity prices, and much tighter external financing constraints. \nThe lingering after-effects on the global economy of the financial crash of 2007\u20132008 and the \ndemand  destruction  of  2008\u20132009  suggest  that  the  pace  of  recovery  will  be  slow  and  the \nsubsequent expansion may not return to the pace that prevailed in 2004\u20132007 for some years \nto come. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6   Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry.  2009.

Early  October 2008 saw a coordinated interest rate cut by major \ncentral banks in advanced economies (with the notable exception of Japan, where rates were \nalready extremely low). Policy rates have continued to fall since then and further reductions are \nlikely  in  early  2009.  Unorthodox  measures\u2014such  as  substantial  expansion  in  the  balance \nsheets  of  the  central  banks  (quantitative  easing),  and  central  bank  easing  of  the  criteria \ngoverning the quality of securities acceptable as collateral\u2014were undertaken by the US Federal \nReserve  and  other  central  banks,  and  these  measures  are  likely  to  be  further  expanded  in \n2009. 8  On  the  fiscal  side,  the  US,  European  Union,  Japan,  and  UK  have  all  announced \nsignificant  fiscal  stimulus  packages.  Despite  these  and  other  massive  rescue  packages, \nfinancial markets remain highly stressed because of elevated risks, linked to lacking confidence \nin counterparties and their balance sheets. \n \n21. \nAgainst this backdrop, economic growth in Indonesia is expected to decelerate in 2009 \nbecause of the projected sharp reduction in external demand for exports. Indeed, export value \ncontracted by 33% year-on-year in February 2009. The recent decline in commodity prices will \nalso  have  a  negative  impact  on  Indonesia.  Projected  decline  in  capital  inflows,  particularly \nforeign  direct  investment,  will  constrain  investment.  The  Government  has  revised  its \nmacroeconomic  framework  and  projects  growth  to  decline  to  4.5%  for  2009,  with  higher \nunemployment  and  increase  poverty  rate.  The  Economist  Intelligence  Unit  projects  a  lower \ngrowth rate of about 2% resulting from faltering exports and stalling foreign investments.9 \n \n22. \nPoverty  Alleviation  and  Employment.  Indonesia  has  made  solid  progress  in  poverty \nreduction  since  the  Asian  financial crisis.  High  and  inclusive  economic  growth  over  the  past  6 \nyears  has  benefited  the  poor.  The  poverty  rate  has  fallen  by  about  one  percentage  point  per \nyear since 2003, reaching 17.8% in 2006, and falling further to 15.4% in 2008. However, poverty \nremains a serious problem in Indonesia with over 35 million persons below the national poverty \n\n                                                 \n8  For example, the US Federal Reserve's balance sheet was expanded from $800 billion in 2008 to $2.1 trillion by \n\nOctober 2008. \n\n9  Economist Intelligence Unit. 2009.

Public  services  remain  inadequate  for  a  middle-income  country,  and \nnon-income poverty is also a major problem in terms of high malnutrition and maternal mortality \nrates,  inadequate  access  to  safe  water  and  sanitation,  and  education outcomes.  Furthermore, \ninequality is increasing and disparities between regions remain high. On the employment front, \nthe results have been mixed. Open unemployment has declined from its peak of 11.2% in 2005 \nto 8.0% in 2008 because of solid economic growth. However, shares of formal employment in \ntotal employment remain relatively stagnant at around 32% of the work force. The Government \nis  concerned  that  the  current  global  financial  crisis  will  have  adverse  effects  on  its  efforts  to \nreduce  poverty  if  there  is  a  significant  reduction  in  economic  growth,  retrenchments,  and \nshrinking  employment  opportunities.  Recent  retrenchment  data  from  the  Department  of \nManpower and Transmigration point to increased layoffs, particularly in the export sector. Based \non  the  current  low  case  growth  scenario  of  4.5%  economic  growth  for  2009,  the  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) projects that unemployment could increase by up \nto  1 million  persons  or  0.8  percentage  points,  and  poverty  could  increase  by  about  3  million\u2013\n4 million  persons  or  about  1\u20132  percentage  points  of  the  population\u2014reversing  recent  gains  in \npoverty  reduction.  In  this  context  of  second  round  effects  in  a  global  environment  of  tight \nliquidity and elevated banking sector risk, key issues for Indonesia mitigating the global impact \nof  the  crisis  on  its  economy  include  (i)  reassuring  financial  markets  and  maintaining  financial \nsystem stability, (ii) sustaining critical public expenditures and the need for a fiscal stimulus, and \n(iii)  sustaining  exports  and  private  sector  investment.  The  challenges  facing  Indonesia  as  a \nresult of the global financial crisis are summarized in a problem tree presented in Appendix 9. \n \n\n1. \n\nReassuring Financial Markets and Maintaining Financial System Stability \n\nIndonesia  has  made  progress \n\n \n23. \nAfter  the  1997\u20131998  Asian  financial  crisis,  the  Government  introduced  a  series  of \nregulatory  reforms  to  its  financial  sector.  The  main  change  has  been  a  focus  on  risk-based \nsupervision  and  consolidated  supervision  of  groups  rather  than  traditional  monitoring  of \ncompliance  with  regulations  by  individual  banks.  This  has  involved  better  understanding  of \nbanks\u2019  risk  management  and  internal  control  systems,  focus  on  corporate  governance  and \nresponsibilities of board of directors and management, stress testing of capital adequacy, and \nimproved  off-site  monitoring  systems. \nin  strengthening \nsupervision  capacity,  off-site  monitoring,  early  warning  systems,  corporate  governance,  and \nresponsibilities  of  board  of  directors  and  management.10 Regulatory  reforms  and  reforms  to \nsupervision  practices  have  greatly  strengthened  the  soundness  of  the  Indonesian  banking \nsector  to  withstand  the  indirect  effects  of  the  global  financial  crisis.  These  measures  were \nrecently  tested  in  the  recent  case  of  a  bank  failure  at  the  end  of  2008,  where  empowered \nregulatory authorities were able to take control of the situation quickly with minimum impact on \nconfidence  in  the  banking  sector.  Bank  Indonesia  dismissed  the  bank's  management  and  the \nDeposit  Insurance  Agency  (LPS)  swiftly  took  over  and  recapitalized  the  bank.  With  limited \nexposure to troubled US assets, banks\u2019 capital adequacy ratios remain sound and NPLs were \nrelatively  low  in  February  2009  (Figure 6).  The  loan\u2013deposit  ratio  has  dropped  gradually  to \n75.5%  after  peaking  at  81.6%  in  August  2008.  Banking  sector  liquidity  (liquid  assets  to  total \nassets) also started ease in December 2008 but remained relatively tight in Q1 2009.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n10 Lindgren, Carl-Johan 2006.

As  the  second  round  effects  of  the  global  crisis \n24. \nspillover to the real sector, demand for credit is expected to fall, and NPLs are expected to rise \nin 2009\u2014placing some stress on the domestic banking sector. Moreover, financial sector risks \nremain  elevated  because  of  continued  uncertainty  about  the  extent  of  damage  to  the  global \nfinancial  system,  so  Indonesia  remains  vulnerable  to  any  additional  shocks  to  the  global \nfinancial sector. Lessons from the 1997\u20131998 financial crisis demonstrate the importance for the \nGovernment  to  reassure  financial  markets  quickly  about  the  soundness  of  its  banking  system \nand  ensure  that  measures  are  in  place  to  address  increased  risks.  These  include  enhanced \ncoordination and clarification of responsibilities between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the \ncentral  bank  in  the  case  of  both  nonsystemic  and  systemic  banking  crises,  and  a  credible \ndeposit insurance scheme that retains confidence in the banking system while minimizing moral \nhazard. Another area for strengthening is the central bank\u2019s lender of last resort facility. Under \nthe current Bank Indonesia Law (Law No. 23/1999), Bank Indonesia is the lender of last resort \nfor  the  banking  sector.  This  means  that  banks  could  borrow  in  the  short  term  from  Bank \nIndonesia, backed up by high quality assets (government bonds and Bank Indonesia Certificate \n[SBI]).  The  recent  tight  liquidity  pressure  in  the  interbank  market  meant  that  Bank  Indonesia \nwould  be  unable  to  take  prompt  action  to  ease  such  pressures  and  prevent  liquidity  problems \nfrom becoming more systemic.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSustaining  Critical  Public  Expenditures  While  Maintaining  Budget \nDiscipline \n\n \n25. \nNeed for Fiscal Stimulus. With the unfolding impacts on growth in regional economies, \nthe  Government\u2019s  economic  priorities  focused  on  protecting  the  real  sector  and  mitigating  the \neffects on poverty, in addition to maintaining confidence and stability in the financial sector. In \nJanuary  2009,  the  Government  revised  its  2009  budget,  which  was  passed  by  parliament  in \nNovember  2008.  It  now  assumes  a  lower  economic  growth  rate  of  4.5%,  down  from  6%,  with \nfurther downward revisions expected in the coming months, an exchange rate of Rp11,000 (up \nfrom Rp9,400), and oil prices around $45 per barrel (down from $80 per barrel). These budget \nrevisions  lower  tax  revenue  collections  by  Rp64.1  trillion  and  nontax  revenue  collections  by \nRp73.1 trillion. Savings from fuel and other subsidies from the fall in oil prices add Rp34 trillion. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nWhile spending in some non-priority sectors will be revised down, the revised budget protects \nspending on public infrastructure, education, and poverty alleviation programs. The budget also \nprovides  additional  fiscal  stimulus  measures  on  the  expenditure  side  (Rp16.9 trillion)  and  tax \nrelief to stressed sectors on the revenue side (Rp56.3 trillion). The Government has budgeted \nRp3.8 trillion (or $345 million) for its unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program for January and \nFebruary 2009 to mitigate the poverty impact of the global crisis. As a result, the Government \nnow projects an increase in the budget deficit from 1.0% of GDP to 2.5% of GDP, and increased \ngross financing needs from $18.2 billion to $24.6 billion for 2009 (Table 2). MOF estimates that \nthe fiscal stimulus is equivalent to 1.3% of GDP.  \n \n26. \nPublic  Expenditure. The effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus will depend on the budget \nallocation to priority sectors and the speed of disbursements. Under the World Bank\u2019s DPL and \nADB\u2019s  DPSP,  the  Government  has  made  much  progress  in  improving  budget  credibility, \nexecution, and reporting. However, weaknesses remain in budget execution, especially delays \nin disbursements and procurement caused by administration weakness. In the current adverse \nconditions,  it  will  be  important  for  the  Government  to  advance  its  procurement  processing \ntimetable for 2009, shift discretionary spending to priority areas in a timely manner, and roll over \nunspent 2008 budget for public infrastructure.  \n \n27. \nPoverty  Impacts.  A  core  purpose  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  is  to  protect  jobs  and  recent \ngains in poverty reduction. The Government has several poverty alleviation programs that can \neasily be scaled up. In 2008, the Government reactivated the UCT program to compensate poor \nfamilies  for  the  fuel  and  commodity  rice  increases.  The  UCT  program  covered  19  million \nhouseholds  based  on  the  database  used  in  the  previous  UCT  in  2005  and  2006.  Each \nhousehold  received  Rp100,000  per  month  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Available  data  about  the \nantipoverty effectiveness of the UCT is encouraging. According to data from the 2008 National \nSocioeconomic  Survey  (Susenas),  the  UCT  maintained  the  welfare  levels  of  60%  of  recipient \nhouseholds and assisted 30% of recipient households to escape from poverty, while about 10% \nof  households  under  the  scheme  fell  into  poverty  because  of  food  price  inflation  in  2008.  The \nGovernment has extended the UCT to the first 2 months of 2009 and this could be prolonged if \nnecessary. The Government has allocated Rp7 trillion for the National Empowerment Program \n(PNPM)  for  2009.  Under  lower  growth  scenarios  for  2009,  BAPPENAS  projects  that  poverty-\nrelated  spending  will  increase  by  about  Rp9.9  trillion  (Rp4.9  trillion  for  the  existing  social \nprotection  programs  (Figure  7[b])  and  Rp5  trillion  for  PNPM).      The  conditional  cash  transfer \nprogram is still in a pilot stage, covering 1 million households, and is unlikely to be scaled up to \nmitigate  the  poverty  effects  of  the  economic  slowdown.  The  Government  has  several  other \nprograms related to the social sector, including education and health. Through the national and \nregional  budgets,  social  expenditure  has  increased  substantially  in  real  terms  since  2001 \n(Figure 7). Government spending on education and health in real terms increased by over 100% \nfrom  2001  to  2007.  The  share  of  education  spending  in  the  Government\u2019s  2007  budget  was \n17% and health spending accounted for 4.5%.  It will be important to protect the gains in social \nspending during the current adverse situation. However, the effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus \nin  mitigating  the  poverty  effects  will  also  depend  on  how  the  Government  is  able  to  quickly \nidentify  families  at  risk  of  falling  into  poverty  or  more  severe  poverty,  and  deterioration  in \nregional  incomes  from  the  slowdown  in  exports.  Currently,  the  Government  does  not  have  a \npoverty  monitoring  and \ninformation  about \ndevelopments  in  household  poverty  on  a  timely  basis  that  would  allow  the  Government  to \nrespond promptly with targeted poverty alleviation programs. Thus, to mitigate the effects of the \neconomic  slowdown,  it  will  be  important  for  the  Government  to  establish  a  poverty  monitoring \nunit coordinated across relevant ministries.  \n \n\nresponse  mechanism \n\nthat  could  provide \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Indonesia's Social Spendinga \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n30\n\n70\n\n60\n\n80\n\n50\n\n40\n\n(a) Education and Health \n\n  \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    a Education and Health spending are in 2000 constant price. \n  Sources: World Bank, Ministry of Finance, and BAPPENAS. \n \n\nEducation Health\n\n2001\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2003\n\n2002\n\n2007\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n(b) Projected Increase in Social Protection Spending \n\n10-15\n\n16-20\n\n21-30\n\nAffected Household (million)\n\nProjected Costs (Rp. trillion)\n\n3. \n\nCrowding in Private Investment and Supporting Exports \n\n \n28. \nTrade finance to developing countries is highly vulnerable in times of crisis. It collapsed \nduring  the  1997\u20131998  Asian  financial  crisis,  when  bank  lending  declined  by  80%.  Up  until \nSeptember  2008,  Indonesia\u2019s  exports  were  reaching  record  levels,  primarily  driven  by  high \ncommodity prices, with manufacturing exports also performing well. Investment, which slumped \nduring the 1998 crisis and took 5 years before it turned around, was growing in 2006 and 2007 \n(Figure  8).  Foreign  direct  investment  approvals  were  also  robust  in  2007.  The  global  financial \ncrisis and recessionary conditions began to affect Indonesia\u2019s exports and investment in several \nways:  (i)  the  commodity  price  bust  resulted  in  contraction  in  commodity  export  values  by \nNovember  2008;  (ii)  the  slowdown  in  global  demand  for  exports  began  to  hurt  manufacturing \nexports,  particularly  garments  and  machinery;  and  (iii)  the  global  credit  crunch  increased  the \ncost of trade financing and sharply reduced trade finance as counterpart banks were reluctant to \naccept letters of credit. While no comprehensive data on the supply of trade finance is readily \navailable, there is anecdotal evidence that trade finance has become tight. Bank customers are \nnow  required  to  put  an  80%\u2013100%  cash  margin  to  have  a  letter  of  credit  opened  by  banks, \ncompared  with  20%\u201330%  before  the  crisis.  The  global  credit  crunch  and  uncertainty  about \neconomic growth have caused several foreign and domestic investments to be put on hold. The \nIndonesian  central  bank  projects  private  sector  lending  to  decline  from  35%  in  2008  to  about \n15%\u201318% in 2009, although this is seen as optimistic by market commentators. \n \n29. \nIn this context of slowing exports and waning market confidence, it will be important to \nintroduce  measures  that  boost  confidence  and  improve  access  to  trade  finance.  In  particular, \nthe banking sector provides limited trade finance products; about 85% of exports are financed \non a cash basis, with the other 15% financed through letters of credit. Indonesia has a specialist \nexport bank (Bank Ekspor) although assessments of its performance indicate mixed results. The \nGovernment has drafted a new law converting Bank Ekspor into an export\u2013import agency that \nwould provide different trade finance products, including export credit guarantees, as well as a \nmandate  to  support  diversification  of  export  markets  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises\u2019 \naccess to trade finance. The global financial crisis and the resulting credit crunch was a catalyst \nfor quick passage of the law in January 2009. It will be important to complete the new regulatory \nframework for the agency and operationalize it over the next 12 months.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nC. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n17\n\nFigure 8: Indonesia's Export and Import Performance \n(% change year-on-year) \n \n\n120\n\n60\n\n80\n\n20\n\n40\n\n100\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Central Bureau of Statistics, Government of Indonesia, Jakarta. \n\nExports\n\nJan-\n08\n\nJan-\n05\n\nJan-\n07\n\nJan-\n06\n\nImports\n\nJul-\n07\n\nJul-\n08\n\nJul-\n05\n\nJul-\n06\n\n-20\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n0\n\nJan-\n09\n\nLessons \n\n30.  While  the  sources  of  the  current  global  financial  crisis  and  associated  risks  to  the \nIndonesian economy are different from the 1997\u20131998 Asian economic crisis, and subsequent \nreforms  have  made  the  Indonesian  economy  much  more  resilient  to  external  shocks,  lessons \nlearned  from  the  1998  economic  crisis  are  embedded  in  the  PESF  Program.  Key  lessons \nrelevant to the current situation include the following:  \n \n\nintroduced  a  blanket  guarantee \n\nThe  Government  must  introduce  measures  that  maintain  confidence  in  the \nbanking sector. The absence of deposit insurance in 1997 exacerbated the fall in \nconfidence  in  the  domestic  banking  sector  after  16  banks  were  closed  in \nNovember  1997.  The  Government \nin \nJanuary 1998. Later in 2004, the Government introduced legislation to phase out \nthe blanket guarantee with a deposit insurance scheme.  \nA special resolution regime for prompt corrective action to address failing banks \nis  needed  to  prevent  systemic  collapse,  rapidly  restructure  failing  banks,  and \nensure that fiscal authorities are ready to support bank resolution through capital \ninjections  as  necessary.  The  absence  of  such  frameworks  in  1997\u20131998  Asian \ncrisis required the establishment of a special and temporary resolution agency at \ngreat cost and involving mishandling. \nThe  central  bank  should  ensure  liquidity  in  domestic  credit  markets  to  avoid  a \ncredit crunch and ensure that banks maintain adequate capital. \nThe  Government  should  ensure  that  access  to  trade  finance  remains  open  to \nexporters and importers.  \nThe Government should provide an appropriate fiscal stimulus while maintaining \nfiscal discipline. During 1998, the Government operated budget surpluses as the \ngovernment  administration  was  unable  to  disburse  because  of  political  crisis. \nThis  exacerbated  the  deep  recession  and  its  duration.  Thus,  it  is  important  to \nprovide  for  timely  spending  disbursements  to  ensure  the  fiscal  stimulus  is \neffective.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\nEffective social assistance programs are necessary to mitigate the worse effects \nof the economic slowdown on vulnerable families. In this regard, it is important to \nestablish  effective  poverty  monitoring  systems  to  quickly  identify  and  target \nvulnerable  groups  and  regions  for  assistance.  It  is  critical  to  have  social \nassistance programs and mechanisms to ensure timely assistance and minimize \nleakages to non-target groups. The lack of effective programs in 1998 meant that \nvulnerable  groups  quickly  fell  into  poverty,  with  little  assistance  from  the \nGovernment, resulting in increased rates and severity of poverty.  \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \n31. \nThe  impact  of  the  PESF  will  be  to  mitigate  the  adverse  economic  and  social \nconsequences  of  the  global  financial  crisis  on  Indonesia.  The  outcome  of  the  PESF  will  be  to \nsecure adequate access to budget financing for critical expenditures and the required counter-\ncyclical policy.  \n \n32. \nincreased \nvulnerabilities  and  risks  to  the  Indonesian  economy  from  the  global  financial  crisis  and  sharp \nslowdown  in  the  global  economy,  and  underpin  the  key  priorities  of  the  Government\u2019s  reform \nagenda. These reforms are designed to accomplish the following:  \n \n\nincludes  a  series  of  policy  measures \n\nthat  address \n\nThe  PESF \n\nthe \n\nFinancial  system  stability.  Reassure  financial  markets  and  maintain  financial \nsystem stability by enhancing the financial safety net, maintaining the stability of \nthe  banking  system,  and  ensuring  predictability  in  the  Government\u2019s  financing \nrequirements for 2009 and 2010.  \nCritical  public  expenditure.  Sustain  critical  public  expenditures  while \nmaintaining  budget  discipline  to  mitigate  the  poverty  impacts  of  the  growth \nslowdown through strengthened coordination of national poverty reduction efforts; \nestablishing a national poverty monitoring and response system; and increasing \ncritical  public  expenditures  in  the  areas  of  poverty  alleviation,  social  protection, \nand  infrastructure  maintenance  and  development.  This  will  be  done  by \nundertaking  actions  to  speed  up  budget  disbursement  through  improving \nefficiency  in  budget  disbursements,  promoting  advance  procurement,  and \ncarrying over unspent cash from the 2008 budget.  \nPrivate  investment  and  exports.  Crowd  in  private  investment  and  exports  by \nrevising \nimproving \ntransparency  in  revenues  from  extractive  industries,  and  enhancing  access  to \ntrade finance.  \n\nimplementing  decree \n\nInvestment  Law, \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n \n33. \nThe  PESF  is  designed  to  be  a  single-tranche  loan  with  scheduled  and  multiple \nwithdrawals to be made over the program period on the condition that, prior to each withdrawal, \n(i) the  Government  has  met  the  drawdown  triggers  set  out  in  the  financing  plan,  (ii)  the \nthe \nGovernment  has  maintained  an  appropriate  macroeconomic \nGovernment  has  not  reversed  any  policy  actions  under  the  policy  matrix.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the PESF is in Appendix 1, the PESF policy matrix is in Appendix 2, \nand Appendix 3 contains the donor coordination matrix.  \n \n \n\nframework,  and  (iii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nB. \n \n34. \nand March 2009.   \n\n \n\nAll 12 policy measures required for the PESF were carried out between September 2008 \n\n1. \n\nActions  to  Reassure  Financial  Markets  and  Maintain  Financial  System \nStability \n\n \nThe  PESF  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  implement  several  actions  promptly  to \n35. \nreassure  financial  markets  about  the  soundness  of  the  financial  sector  and  the  regulatory \nframework  to  respond  to  the  global  financial  crisis.  The  following  measures  toward  boosting \nconfidence  in  the  financial  system  were  completed  before  Board  consideration  of  the  PESF \nProgram.  \n \n36. \nFinancial Safety Net. In October 2008, the Government issued Government Regulation \nin Lieu of Law (Perpu No. 4/2008) on Financial Safety Net. The legislation establishes the roles, \nresponsibilities, and procedures that govern the actions and responses of Bank Indonesia, MOF, \nand Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation in the event of the failure of a financial institution. \nin December 2008 parliament requested a revised draft to be submitted. The Government has \nsubmitted  a  revised  draft  to  parliament  and  the  bill  is  being  deliberated  by  a  special \nparliamentary committee.  \n \n37. \nDeposit  Insurance  Scheme.  One  lesson  from  the  1998  financial  crisis  is  that  the \nabsence  of  a  credible  deposit  insurance  scheme  can  exacerbate  confidence  in  the  banking \nsector  and  lead  to  systemic  runs  on  banks.  To  arrest  the  run  on  banks  in  January  1998,  the \nGovernment  provided  a  blanket  guarantee  on  deposits.  This  was  intended  as  an  interim \nmeasure  until  it  established  a  deposit  insurance  system.  In  September  2004,  the  Law  on \nDeposit Insurance Agency was passed; and in October 2005, the Indonesian Deposit Insurance \nAgency  (LPS)  was  officially  established.  With  the  establishment  of  LPS,  the  coverage  of  the \ndeposit  guarantee  was  gradually  reduced  from  the  full  coverage  instituted  at  the  time  of  the \nAsian financial crisis to Rp100 million by March 2007. With the onset of the global credit crisis, \nthe  Government  increased  the  maximum  amount  of  insured  deposits  to  Rp2  billion  from \nRp100 million. The Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 3/2008 dated 13 October 2008 \nallows LPS to change the amount of insured deposits in the event that there is a risk that could \nreduce public confidence and endanger financial system stability. This legislation was followed \nup  immediately  with  the  issuance  of  Government  Regulation  No.  66/2008  on  the  same  date, \nwhich  increased  the  maximum  amount  of  insured  deposits  to  Rp2  billion  from  Rp100  million. \nThe  regulation  also  allows  the  Government  to  provide  a  blanket  guarantee  of  deposits,  if  it \ndeems it necessary. However, this authority does not cover interbank deposits. The regulation \nwas  also  introduced  to  align  the  regulatory  framework  with  neighboring  countries  (including; \nHong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore) that had introduced a temporary unlimited guarantee on \nbank deposits in line with similar actions in several Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment  (OECD)  countries including  Australia,  Ireland,  and  the UK.  Perpu No.  3/2008  on \nthe amendment to the Deposit Insurance Corporation Law has been approved by the parliament \nand is now Law No. 7 Year 2009. \n \n38. \nLender of Last Resort Facility. Under the current Bank Indonesia Law, Bank Indonesia \nis  the  lender  of  last  resort  for  the  banking  sector.  This  means  that  banks  could  borrow  in  the \nshort term from Bank Indonesia, backed up by high quality assets (government bonds and Bank \nIndonesia  Certificate  (SBIs).  The  recent  tight  liquidity  pressure  in  the  interbank  market  had \nprompted  Bank  Indonesia  to  take  action  to  ease  such  pressures  and  to  prevent  liquidity \n\n \n\n\f \n\n20 \n \n\n \n\nproblems  from  becoming  more  systemic.  It  has  done  so  by  accepting  an  additional  type  of \nassets  as  collateral  for  short-term  financing  to  banks.  The  Government  issued  a  Government \nRegulation in Lieu of Law No. 2/2008 that amends the Bank Indonesia Law; and Bank Indonesia \nissued a circular letter (No. 10/29/DPM) which, under certain circumstances, broadens the types \nof  assets  that  banks  can  use  as  collaterals  when  borrowing  from  Bank  Indonesia.  Perpu  No. \n2/2008 on the amendment of the Bank Indonesia Law has been approved by parliament and is \nnow Law No. 6 Year 2009.  \n \nFinancial Sector Assessment Program. Following up from its commitment at the G-20 \n39. \nsummit in November 2008, the Government has formally requested the IMF and World Bank to \nconduct a financial sector assessment program (FSAP) for Indonesia. The FSAP, which will be \nthe first for Indonesia, seeks to identify the strengths and vulnerabilities of a country\u2019s financial \nsystem,  determine  how  key  sources  of  risk  are  being  managed,  ascertain  the  sector\u2019s \ndevelopmental and technical assistance needs, and help prioritize policy responses. The FSAP, \nled by the IMF and World Bank, will take about 1 year to complete. The implementation of FSAP \nrecommendations  to  strengthen  the  country\u2019s  financial  system  will  be  used  as  input  into  the \nproposed ADB DPSP series and Capital Market Program.  \n \n40. \nBudget  Financing  Requirements. With increased uncertainty about the functioning of \nglobal credit markets over the next 12\u201324 months, and in view of the need for a fiscal stimulus, \nthe Government has issued a contingent financing plan in case there are shortfalls in its budget \nfinancing in 2009. The Government has indicated that its first preference is to use its access to \ndomestic  and/or  international  markets  to  meet  its  financing  targets.  The  financing  plan \nincorporates quarterly targets for rupiah and US dollar bond issuances. Under the financing plan, \nthe  Government  has  projected  financing  requirements  from  the  market  of  $12.5  billion \nequivalent  for  2009.  However,  in  the  event  of  tight  market  conditions,  the  Government  and \ndevelopment  partners  have  established  broad  parameters  on  the  basis  of  which  the \nGovernment may withdraw the $5.5 billion funds available from the PESF to meet its quarterly \nfinancing  shortfall  during  the  program  period.  The  Government  and  development  partners  will \nassess the Government\u2019s financing shortfall every quarter and determine if disbursement from \nthe PESF is required. The Government and development partners view the financing plan as an \nimportant fiscal risk management tool during the uncertain and difficult global environment, and \nwill  review  these  parameters  on  an  ongoing  basis.  If  the  contingent  loan  is  not  fully  drawn  in \n2009, the financing plan includes a mechanism for rolling over available funds to be potentially \nused within the context of the financing plan for 2010. \n \nIn  line  with  the  financing  plan,  the  Government  and  development  partners  have \n41. \ncommitted to the principles that the loan would be used only where the following circumstances \nexist: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSound  Macroeconomic  Framework.  The  overall  macroeconomic  situation \ncontinues  to  be  sound  and  the  policy  program  on  track.  However,  given  the \nglobal  financing  crisis  and  the  importance  of  the  Government\u2019s  financing  plan, \nthe development partners and the Government have decided that a review of the \nGovernment\u2019s macroeconomic policy framework and its progress in carrying out \nthe PESF (including its financing plan) will be undertaken on a quarterly basis in \naccordance with the jointly agreed governance arrangements. \nLimited Market Access. Indonesia has limited market access because of global \nand/or domestic liquidity constraints, so it needs access to the facility to maintain \npublic spending and/or requires additional fiscal stimulus. The withdrawals will be \nlinked  to  Indonesia\u2019s  access  to  market  finance,  where  access  will  be  assessed \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nfrom  a  set  of  objective  criteria  (such  as  yields  on  domestic  and  foreign  debt) \nguided by best practices in debt management (such as allocation of short versus \nlong-term debt tenure considerations and currency composition of debt), required \nchanges in the fiscal policy stance (such as the need for further fiscal stimulus), \nand any potential crowding out effects on private sector credit.    \nPhased  Withdrawals. Withdrawals from the PESF are phased as needed. The \nfull  amount  of  the  loan  is  unlikely  to  be  required  at  once.  Therefore,  the \nGovernment  has  articulated  a  schedule  of  withdrawals  in  line  with  its  financing \nplan.  It  is  expected  that  the  loan  will  be  withdrawn  each  quarter  after  the  joint \ngovernment  and  development  partner  review  meeting,  with  a  cap  on  the \nmaximum  amount  that  can  be  drawn  down  each  quarter.  In  the  event  that  the \nGovernment does not utilize the full amount of the loan (either partially or fully) in \nany  one  quarter,  such  unutilized  amounts  will  be  rolled  over  to  another  quarter \nuntil  the  Program\u2019s  completion  date  at  the  end  of  2010.  However,  if  market \nconditions continue to improve, the Government may not withdraw funds from the \nPESF.  If  there  are  unwithdrawn  loan  amounts  at  the  end  of  the  Program,  the \nGovernment and/or ADB can cancel the unwithdrawn amounts.  \nProportionate  disbursement  from  development  partners. The financing plan \nindicates  that  if  the  withdrawal  is  warranted,  the  Government  will  draw  down \nsupport  from  development  partners  proportional  to  their  commitment.  This  way, \nthe support and risk would be spread across all the partners participating in the \nPESF.  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n42. \nThe financing plan includes a governance arrangement that allows the Government and \nits  development  partners,  including  ADB,  to  meet  in  the  quarterly  meetings  or  extraordinary \nmeetings  to  (i)  assess  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic  policy  framework,  (ii)  evaluate \nprogress  in  implementation  of  the  financing  plan,  and  (iii)  determine  the  amount  that  the \nGovernment  will  draw  on  support  provided  by  the  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  The \nGovernment and any development partner could also request additional meetings to respond to \nevolving  economic  conditions.  In  the  event  that  the  Government  proposes  changes  to  the \nfinancing  plan,  but  the changes  do  not  involve  a  change  to  the  objective  of  the  financing  plan \n(such as changes in the Government\u2019s financing targets or its market access parameters), these \nwill be done on a consensus basis with the Government and other development partners. The \nrevisions  to  the  parameters  will  be  guided  by,  but  not  limited  to,  the  following  considerations: \n(i) inflation rate, (ii) increased cost of bonds with longer maturities, (iii) bond maturities structure \nand  volume  consistent  with  past  practice  and  prudent  debt  management,  and  (iv)  possible \ncrowding effects on the private sector. \n \n\n2. \n\nActions to Sustain Critical Public Expenditures While Maintaining Budget \nDiscipline \n\n \n43. \nThe  PESF  supports  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  to  mitigate  the  adverse  poverty  impact \nfrom  the  global  financial  crisis  and  destruction  in  external  demand.  The  following  measures \ntoward protecting the poor were completed before Board consideration of the PESF Program.  \n \n44. \nPoverty  Monitoring  System.  While  the  financial  crisis  will  affect  many  sectors,  the \nfocus  of  this  initiative\u2014to  measure  poverty  impacts\u2014will  be  collecting  real-time  data  on \nemployment and dismissals, wage data, farmers\u2019 incomes, prices of basic commodities, health, \neducation,  and  social  welfare.  Preliminary  data  and  information  about  the  socioeconomic \nimpacts  will  be  obtained  through  media  tracking,  followed  by  data  collection  via  national  and \nlocal  government  apparatus,  networks/partners,  local  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n22 \n \n\n \n\nand  associations,  local  universities,  and  poverty  program  field  facilitators.  Secondary  data \nanalysis  will  be  available  from  related  government  agencies  such  as  the  Central  Bureau  of \nStatistics (BPS), Department of Manpower and Transmigration, and other ministries/government \ninstitutions  concerned.  The  emphasis  will  be  on  providing  an  accurate  account  of  the \nsocioeconomic impact of the crisis, especially its implications on the level and extent of poverty. \nWith  this  information,  the  poverty  monitoring  system  would  be  able  to  (i)  provide  a  timely \nassessment  of  the  poverty  impact  of  the  current  global  financial  crisis  to  stakeholders \nconcerned, i.e., the Government, international agencies, development partners, NGOs, and civil \nsociety;  (ii) provide  the  Government  with  policy-relevant  recommendations;  (iii)  assist  in  the \nformulation of effective policies and programs; and (iv) provide feedback on the effectiveness of \nthe Government\u2019s policies and programs put in place to respond to the negative impacts of the \nfinancial crisis. \n\n45. \nOverall  responsibility  for  the  poverty  monitoring  system  will  rest  with  the  deputy  for \ndevelopment performance evaluation in BAPPENAS (Figure 9). At district and provincial levels, \nthe  Subnational  Development  Agencies  (BAPPEDAs)  will  be  the  contact  points  for  data  and \ninformation  gathering  on  the  impact  of  the  global  crisis.  Such  data  may  originate  from  the \nvarious  sectoral  departments,  other  local  government  agencies,  or  BPS.  In  addition,  nonstate \nactors  (such  as  regional  offices  of  professional  organizations  and  associations,  research \ninstitutes, and NGOs) may be sources of data on the regional impact of the crisis. Facilitators of \nthe different poverty alleviation programs (such as PNPM, Operational Aid to Schools Prorgram \n(BOS),  Unconditional  Cash  Transfer  (UCT)  will  also  be  able  to  provide  reliable  data  on  the \nimpact of the crisis.  \n\nNational  Poverty  Reduction  Efforts. After extensive consultations within government, \n46. \nand with development agencies and civil society for the past 6 months, the Government issued \na presidential regulation on coordination of national poverty reduction efforts in March 2009. The \nproposed  decree  is  important  at  this  stage  because  it  will  help  coordinate  and  streamline  the \nimplementation of poverty reduction efforts at both national and local levels. The decree outlines \nthe  functions,  responsibilities,  and  organization  of  the  coordination  committees  for  poverty \nreduction  at  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels.  At  the  national  level,  the  coordination \ncommittee is led by the coordinating minister for social welfare, with membership from all major \nministries. At provincial level, the committee is chaired by the provincial governor and at district \nlevel by the district governor. The committees will have three working groups focusing on social \nsafety  net  programs,  community  empowerment  programs,  and  microcredit  and  small  business \ndevelopment.  With  the  decree,  the  Government  will  harmonize  and  streamline  interventions \nfrom some 60 community-based projects executed by 22 sectoral ministries as well as activities \nfrom  NGOs.  This  will  enable  the  Government  to  respond  more  efficiently  to  poverty  impacts \nfrom the financial crisis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nNational \n\nFigure 9: Poverty Monitoring System \n\nsectors \n\nministries \n\nProvince \n\nProvincial \nBAPPEDA \n\nPoverty \nMonitoring \nInitiative\n\nBAPPENAS \nDeputy  \nDPE \n\n\u2022  BPS \n\u2022  State universities \n\nCMSW (Poverty Alleviation \nCoordination Team) \n\nProvincial level state actors: \n\u2022  Dinas from the different \n\nNational level state actors: \n\u2022  Central offices of government \n\n\u2022  Other LG agencies \n\u2022  BPS \n\u2022  State universities \n\nMultilateral crisis and poverty \nmonitoring initiatives  \n(e.g., from UN agencies) \n\nNational level non-state actors: \n\u2022  Professional organizations \n\u2022  Private universities \n\u2022  Research institutes \n\u2022  NGOs \n\nProvincial level non-state actors: \n\u2022  Professional organizations \n\u2022  Private universities \n\u2022  Research institutes \n\u2022  NGOs \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBAPPEDA  =  Subnational  Development  and  Planning  Agency,  BAPPENAS  =  National  Development  and  Planning \nAgency,  BPS  =  Central  Bureau  of  Statistics,  BOS  =  Operational  Aid  to  Schools  Program,  CMSW  =  Coordinating \nMinistry for Social Welfare, DPE = Deputy Performance and Evaluation, LG = Local Government, PNPM = National \nCommunity Empowerment Program, NGO = Nongovernment Organitation, UN = United Nations. \nSource: BAPPENAS. \n\nDistrict level non-state actors: \n\u2022  Professional organizations \n\u2022  Research institutes \n\u2022  NGOs \n\nPoverty alleviation \nprograms  \n(PNPM, BOS, etc.) \n\nDistrict level state actors: \n\u2022  Dinas from the different \n\n\u2022  Other LG agencies \n\u2022  BPS \n\nDistrict \nBAPPEDA \n\nFacilitators \n\nDistrict \n\nsectors \n\nPoverty  Alleviation  Efforts.  To  protect  critical  public  expenditures,  the  Government \n\n \n47. \nundertook the following measures to expedite disbursement in 2009: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nImplemented  a  socialization  campaign \nto  promote  advance  procurement \nprocessing,  appoint  multiyear  treasury  officers,  and  speed  up  disbursements \nthrough Director General (DG) Treasury. \nEstablished  a  monitoring  committee  for  the  budget  activity  list  (DIPA)  2009  to \nimprove budget disbursements. The committee is established under a Ministry of \nFinance  decree  and  comprises  the  DG  Treasury  (chair),  DG  Budget,  head  of \n\n \n\n\f \n\n24 \n \n\n \n\nFiscal Policy Office, and BAPPENAS. It meets monthly to review the progress of \nfunds  disbursement  and  readiness  of  DIPA  releases  to  ensure  that  all \nbottlenecks in the disbursement of budget funds are removed in real time in close \nconsultation with the ministries concerned.  \nImproved  the  recording  and  reporting  system  in  the  satkers  (budget  spending \nunits). DG Treasury has provided satkers with a software application called SAI \nthat  is  being  used  to  register  expenditure  transactions  and  compile  financial \naccounts.  An  updated  version  of  this  software,  scheduled  for  rollout  in \nJanuary 2009, will include recording and reporting features. \nIssued an MOF regulation with a simplified mechanism and process for carryover \nof  unspent  2008  budget  for  the  PNPM  to  April  2009,  as  provided  for  under \nArticle 7A of Law No. 16/2008 on the revision of FY2008 budget. \nIssued  an MOF  regulation  outlining  procedures  for  simplified  amending  of  2009 \nDIPA documents and carryover of unspent 2008 budget for infrastructure. MOF \nregulation  No.  46/2008  on  the  procedure  for  amending  the  2008  DIPA \ndocuments  permits  line  ministries  to  reallocate  across  sub-activities  under  a \nsimpler  budget  (DIPA)  revision  mechanism  without  prior  amendment  of  the \nbudget allotment. This will allow for carryover of last year\u2019s infrastructure projects \nas provided for under Article 12 of the 2009 budget (Law No. 41/2008). \n\nActions to Crowd in Private Investment and Support Exports \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n3. \n\n48. \nThe  PESF  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  access  to  trade  finance  and \ncrowd  in  investment.  To  mitigate  the  impact  of  global  turmoil  in  investment  and  trade,  the \nGovernment has developed a set of policy measures, including to (i) boost investor sentiment \nthrough  revising  investment  regulations,  (ii)  improving  transparency  in  extractive  industries \nrevenues, and (iii) easing access to trade finance for exporters. The Government undertook the \nfollowing measures before Board consideration of the PESF Program. \n\n49. \nRevisions  to  Investment  Regulation.  In  2007,  parliament  enacted  a  new  investment \nlaw that replaced the separate laws on foreign and domestic investment dating from 1967 and \n1968, and provides a single legislative framework for domestic and foreign investment, a long \nstanding objective that has featured in the Government's policy dialogue with ADB since 1998. \nArticle 12  of  the  new  law  states  that  all  business  activities  not  explicitly  closed  or  restricted  to \ninvestment are open, and that restrictions must be listed in a presidential regulation. This is the \nfirst time that an Indonesian law has required a single comprehensive investment negative list, \nissued by the President, and it is the first clear statement in law that activities not included in the \nlist  are  fully  open  to  investment.  However,  the  subsequent  implementing  decree  (Presidential \nRegulation  No.  77/2007)  on  the  negative  list  received  a  mixed  reaction  from  investors.  It \nincluded  a  grandfather  clause  for  foreign  investors  that  exceed  foreign  equity  limits,  but \nuncertainties and differing interpretations created new forms of investor uncertainty. Additional \nuncertainty has also emanated from the Government\u2019s failure to follow up on its announcement \nthat  it  would  change  a  long-standing  policy  of  not  applying  the  investment  negative  list  to \npublicly  listed  companies\u2014creating  widespread  uncertainty  among  listed  companies  at  a  time \nwhen  the  domestic  capital  market  is  under  severe  pressure.  Recognizing  these  regulatory \nuncertainties and the need to boost investor confidence, the Government has prepared a draft \nrevision to Presidential Regulation No. 77/2007 that clarifies the rules and relaxes restrictions in \nkey sectors \n\n50. \nExtractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative.  The  Government  recognizes  that  the \nsteady  decline  in  exploration  and  investment  in  the  oil  sector  is  partly  caused  by  uncertainty \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nover  rules  on  tax  treatment  and  production  sharing.  To  address  this,  the  Government  has \ninitiated  the  accession  process  to  sign  up  to  and  implement  the  Extractive  Industries \nTransparency  Initiative  (EITI).  It  has  sent  a  formal  letter  to  the  EITI  secretariat  to  initiate  the \nprocess.  Three ministries, CMEA, MOF, and Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, have \nissued  a  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  to  set  up  the  institution  that  will  drive  EITI \nimplementation. The implementation process will take about 2 years. In 2009, efforts will include \npreliminary meetings of the steering group, establishing its secretariat, developing a work plan \nand securing resources for implementation, and acceptance of Indonesia as an EITI candidate \ncountry. In 2010, an independent reconciler will design reporting templates and build capacity to \nfill  in  reporting  templates,  and  the  Government  and  industry  will  submit  the  templates  to  the \nsteering group. The process which will lead to greater clarity in regulations, rules, and revenue \nreporting  will  improve  transparency  and  boost  investor  sentiment  in  the  oil,  gas,  and  mining \nsectors over the medium term.  \n\n51. \nTrade  Finance.  The  Government  has  taken  both  short-  and  longer-term  measures  to \naddress trade finance issues. In the short term, it has activated its rediscount window for trade \nreceivables. The rediscount window is not envisaged as credit coverage but as a mechanism to \nincrease dollar liquidity. The mechanism works as follows: the exporter sells its accepted letter \nof  credit  to  Bank  Indonesia  at  a  small  discount,  allowing  the  exporter  receivables  in  advance. \nThe  facility  has  a  minimum  letter  of  credit  value  of  $10,000  allowing  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  to  access  the  rediscount  window.  The  letter  of  credit  must  be  issued  from  an \noverseas bank with a AAA rating from Standard and Poor\u2019s credit rating agency. \n\n52. \nExport  Financing  Agency.  The  Law  No.  2/2009  on  the  establishment  of  an  export \nfinancing agency was promulgated in January 2009 aimed at improving trade finance over the \nmedium term. Under the new law, the current Bank Ekspor Indonesia (a commercial bank) will \nbe converted into an export financing agency within 9 months. The agency will be responsible \nfor developing trade finance products to improve trade, including trade finance guarantees. Its \nmandate also includes promoting trade to nontraditional markets. This initiative is supported by \nthe proposed Trade Finance Facilitation Program.11 Indonesia is one of the priority countries to \nbe  supported  under  the  Program.  Discussions  on  implementation  of  the  Trade  Finance \nFacilitation Program with financial institutions are ongoing, and operations are expected to start \nin the second half of 2009. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nC. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $1  billion  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \n53. \nresources for the PESF Program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of \n3 years, with an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility and a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum;12 and such other terms and conditions \nas  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  program  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n54. \nGross financing needs of the Government have increased from $18.2 billion in 2008 to \n$24.6 billion in 2009 based on the revised 2009 budget. These growing financing needs reflect \nincreased  levels  of  domestic  and  foreign  debt  principal  repayments,  and  changes  to  the  2009 \nbudget  (Table  2).  The  revised  2009  budget  projects  a  lower  increase  in  revenues  because  of \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2009.

The  revised  budget  protects  social  sector  spending,  in \nparticular education and funding for the flagship community-based poverty alleviation program, \nto  provide  a  cushion  for  adversely  affected  households.  Overall,  the  Government  is  budgeting \nfor additional spending and counter-cyclical spending up to Rp73.2 trillion in 2009. According to \nits financing plan (Table 3), the Government indicated that gross financing of $24.6. billion will \nbe  met  from  the  following  sources:  (i)  $9.1  billion  from  issuance  of  domestic  and  international \nbond  issuance  in  the  markets,  (ii)  $6.3  billion  from  the  banking  system  and  excess  financing \nfrom  2008,  (iii)  $5.2  billion  from  the  Official  Development  Assistance  program  and  project \nlending; and (iv) $4.1 billion additional financing. The Government will draw down the PESF and \nrelated support from other development partners when it cannot meet its financing targets from \nthe markets within specified market access conditions specified in the Government\u2019s financing \nplan (paras. 40\u201342) and other conditions set out in the loan agreement.  \n\n \nTable 3: Projected Financing Requirements of the Government of Indonesia for 2009 \n($ billion) \n \n\nFinancing Mix \nGross Financing Requirements \nLess Amortization \n \nNet Financing Requirement \nProgrammed Gross External Borrowings \n\nof which: \nADB\u2019s Proposed Loan Pipeline \n\nDevelopment Policy Support Program  \nIndonesia Infrastructure Financing Facility \nCapital Market Development (Subprogram 2) \nNational Community Empowerment Project \nMetropolitan Sanitation Project \nJava Bali Distribution  Performance Improvement  \n\nOther Donors and Commercial Borrowings \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = Rp11.000. \nSources: Ministry of Finance and ADB estimates. \n\nProposed \n Amount \n24.61 \n 10.64 \n \n\n          13.97 \n            7.24 \n\n \n\n            0.75 \n            0.20 \n            0.10 \n            0.30 \n0.07 \n0.05 \n0.04 \n            6.73 \n\n \n55. \nThe Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nProgram Management \n\n1. \n\n \n56. \nThe  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  (CMEA)  will  be  the  Program  Executing \nAgency. MOF, Ministry of Trade (MOT), Coordinating Ministry for Social Welfare (CMSW), and \nBAPPENAS  will  be  the  Implementing  Agencies.  CMEA,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  will  be \nresponsible  for  overall  Program  implementation  and  coordination;  it  will  be  supported  by  the \nImplementing  Agencies  (MOF,  MOT,  CMSW,  and  BAPPENAS).  The  Government  has \nestablished  a  program  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  the  Debt \nManagement Office (MOF); and comprising representatives from CMEA, MOF, and BAPPENAS, \nand each development partner cofinancing the PESF. The committee will meet in the first week \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nof  each  quarter  to  review  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  financing  plan  and  assess  and \ndetermine  the  Government\u2019s  financing  shortfalls.  CMEA  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nprogram implementation activities, and will report on implementation progress to ADB. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n57. \nThe program implementation period for the PESF is from 1 September 2008, when the \nturmoil in global financial markets began, to 31 December 2010. The support package for 2010 \nis subject to the Government\u2019s submission of its 2010 financing plan. All actions included in the \npolicy matrix were implemented from September 2008 to March 2009. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements \n\n \n58. \nThe program loan of $1 billion will be released as a single tranche loan with scheduled \nand multiple withdrawals to be made over the program period on the condition that, prior to each \nwithdrawal  (i)  the  Government  has  met  the  drawdown  triggers  set  out  in  the  financing  plan, \n(ii) the  Government  has  maintained  an  appropriate  macroeconomic  framework,  and  (iii)  the \nGovernment  continues  to  fulfill  the  agreed  policy  actions  and  has  not  committed  any  actions \nwhich reversed the objective of the Program. The scheduled withdrawals from the tranche will \nbe made in accordance with the fiscal financing needs of the Government on a quarterly basis \nover fiscal years 2009 and 2010. Prior to each withdrawal under the tranche, the Government, \nADB, and development partners will agree that all of the required drawdown triggers have been \nmet. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local \nduties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, no more than 180 \ndays  before  the  effectiveness  date  of  the  loan.  Items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items \n(Appendix  7)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources  are  excluded.  In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated  Requirements  for  Program  Loans, 13  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the \nGovernment of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required \nif  during  each  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Indonesia\u2019s \ntotal imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures  will  be  required.  Disbursements  will  be  made  under  the  simplified  procedures  for \nprogram  loans.  In  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements  for  program  loans,  all  goods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB \nmember  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable  to  ADB.  If  at  the  end  of  the  Program  there  are  unwithdrawn  loan  amounts,  the \nGovernment and/or ADB can cancel the unwithdrawn amounts.  \n \n59. \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program loan.  \n \n\nThe  reform  needs  supported  under  the  PESF  will  be  financed  by  local  currency \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila \n\n \n\n\f \n\n28 \n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n\n60. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  Program  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service provides as they relate to the Program. \n \nA  core  component  of  the  Indonesian  DPSP  series  focuses  on  strengthening  public \n61. \nfinancial  management  and  improving  budget  preparation,  execution,  transparency  and \naccountability.  The  public  financial  management  systems  in  Indonesia  have  strengths  and \nweaknesses. Strengths include a sound regulatory framework across most parts of the budget \ncycle; an orderly, transparent, and predictable budget formulation process; fund predictability for \nbudget  execution;  sound  budget  classification;  comprehensive  and  transparent  budget \ndocumentation;  government  accounting  standards  aligned  with  comparable  international \nstandards;  a  chart  of  accounts  that  is  broadly  consistent  with  Government  Finance  Statistics \nManual 2001 (GFSM); and a strengthened external audit institution.   \n \n62. \nThe fiduciary assessment for the PESF Program draws on recent economic and sector \nwork  undertaken  by  the  World  Bank,14 ADB,15 and  other  development  partners  (Appendix  8). \nThe  fiduciary  assessments  undertaken  in  2008  have  indicated  considerable  improvements  in \nthe  overall  fiduciary  environment  in  Indonesia  since  2001.  Ongoing  programs  supported  by \nseveral  development  partners  provide  significant  technical  assistance  support  to  strengthen \nfiduciary governance. The PESF Program has benefited from these past and ongoing reforms. \nAt  the  same  time,  the  PESF  introduces  additional  measures  to  strengthen  the  public  financial \nmanagement  system  to  ensure  timely  disbursements  necessary  to  mitigate  the  adverse \nsituation on growth and poverty. \n \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n63. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  withdrawal  applications.  Before  the  first  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment  will  open  a  deposit  account  at  the  central  bank  (Bank  Indonesia)  to  receive  loan \nproceeds.  The  account  will  be  managed,  operated,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  terms \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\n \n64. \nADB,  with  the  Government  and  other  development  partners  cofinancing  the  PESF,  will \ncarry  out  quarterly  reviews  of  program  implementation,  and  assess  the  shortfall  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  financing  requirements  as  set  out  in  the  financing  plan.  The  Government  will \n\n                                                 \n14  World Bank. 2008. Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment, Report No. 42098 ID,  Washington, D.C.

Manila \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n29\n\nkeep  ADB  informed  of  the  outcome  of  policy  discussions  with  other  multilateral  and  bilateral \nagencies that have implications for PESF implementation, and provide ADB with the opportunity \nto comment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with the steering committee, \nwill  undertake  a  review  of  the  Program  every  quarter  after  loan  effectiveness  to  review  the \noutcome of the PESF.  \n \n65. \nThe  Government  and  its  development  partners  have  agreed  on  the  updated  outcome \nand output indicators to monitor PESF implementation and evaluate its impact, within the overall \nPESF framework (Appendix 1). \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impacts \n\nA. \n \n66. \nresources from commercial markets by \n \n\nThe  key  benefits  expected  from  the  PESF  are  to  allow  the  Government  to  mobilize \n\nreassuring financial markets and maintaining financial system stability; \nensuring that the Government can meet its financing requirements of its budget \nand  any  additional  stimulus  required  if  the  economic  slowdown  is  sharper  than \nexpected; \nensuring  that  the  Government  can  maintain  its  momentum  toward  achieving  its \nmedium-term  development  objectives  while  managing  the  negative  impacts  of \nthe  international  credit  crunch  on  Indonesia\u2019s  access  to  credit  markets  and  the \neconomic slowdown by (a) reassuring financial markets and maintaining financial \nsystem  stability,  (b)  mitigating  the  poverty  impacts  of  the  growth  slowdown, \n(c) sustaining critical public expenditures while maintaining budget discipline, and \n(d) crowding in private investment and supporting exports; \naiding  harmonization  and  cofinancing  by  the  key  development  partners  (ADB, \nWorld  Bank,  and  the  governments  of  Japan  and  Australia)  around  a  common \npolicy  matrix  and  dialogue,  and  the  resulting  endorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s \nmacroeconomic  management  and \nthe \ninternational credit crunch; and \nenabling  the  Government  to  attract  capital  from  private  sources  and  lower  the \nGovernment\u2019s cost of funding. \n\nthe  externalities  of \n\nresponse \n\nto \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nThe PESF is subject to the following risks: \n\nB. \n \n67. \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\nExternal  vulnerabilities.  The  risks  remain  high,  especially  during  a  period  of \nglobal  financial  turmoil  and  uncertainty  and  the  ongoing  international  credit \ncrunch,  and  now  the  emerging  second  round  effects  of  a  sharp  economic \nslowdown.  Indonesia  is  a  financially  open  economy  and  there  are  significant \nforeign  holdings,  especially  in  the  stock  market  and  government  bonds  which \nhave only been repatriated partially to date. Indonesia continues to be vulnerable \nto  shifts  in  investor  liquidity  needs  as  deleveraging  proceeds  in  North  America \nand Europe. If significant funds are pulled back because of liquidity demands by \ninvestors  in  these  areas  and/or  increased  emerging  market  risk  aversion,  this \ncould lead to increased pressure on international reserves and/or exchange rates, \nas well as on the domestic money market. In addition, the Government has large \n\n \n\n\f \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ngross  financing  needs  over  the  next  few  years,  and  tighter  credit  markets  and \nincreased risk aversion could severely limit its ability to tap international financial \nmarkets.  This  could  force  the  Government  to  cut  budgetary  outlays  to  maintain \nfiscal  balance,  even  after  full  access  to  the  PESF,  with  adverse  consequences \nfor  infrastructure  and  social  expenditure.  Mitigating  these  risks  will  require  solid \ncooperation  between  the  central  bank  and  the  economic  ministries  to  reassure \nbondholders  that  their  investments  are  safe  (from  inflation  and  exchange  rate \nmovements) while crowding in private investment to the extent possible through \nthe kinds of reforms supported by the PESF. \n\nSharp  economic  slowdown.  In  January  2009,  the  Government  revised  its \ngrowth projection from 6% to 5% in January and again to 4.5% in March 2009 as \nthe economy was beginning to deteriorate. These growth projections are likely to \nbe revised downward as more evidence emerges of the magnitude of the global \neconomic  slowdown  over  the  next  several  weeks.  This  will  affect  revenue \ncollections  and  require  further  revisions  to  the  2009  budget  and  financing  plan. \nThe  PESF  provides  fiscal  flexibility  by  providing  for  further  fiscal  expansion  as \nallowed for in the agreed financing plan.  \n\nFiduciary constraints. Notwithstanding the improvements under way, there are \ncontinuing  concerns  regarding  utilization  of  public  resources.  The  overall \nfiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since  2001  (with  the  Country  Financial \nAccountability  Assessment)  have  indicated  considerable  improvements  in  the \nfiduciary  environment  in  Indonesia  (Appendix  8).  Ongoing  programs  supported \nby several development partners provide significant technical assistance support \nto  strengthen  fiduciary  governance.  The  PESF  inclusion  of  strengthening \nbudgetary  procedures  and  controls  will  significantly  enhance  transparency, \nespecially in financial management. \n\nLegislative  and  presidential  elections  in  2009.  The  Government  remains \ncommitted to sustaining its economic reform agenda despite the global economic \nrecession,  the  international  credit  crunch  and  general  elections  next  year. \nUnfortunately,  elections  often  reduce  the  time  horizons  of  politicians,  leading \nthem  to  avoid  new  policy  initiatives  in  the  pre-election  period  and  shifting  their \nfocus to populist short-term measures. This could undermine the reform agenda \nsupported by the PESF. Conversely, the prospect of elections could spur political \naction  into  ensuring  that  critical  government  expenditures  and  accompanying \nreforms  are  undertaken  to  demonstrate  a  continued  and  clear  record  of \naccomplishments. The Program guards against reversals in the policy actions by \nlinking  scheduled  withdrawals  of  the  loan  amount  to  maintaining  intact  the \nprogram measures and broad objectives. \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n68. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n(i) \n\nCounterpart funds will be used to finance the local currency costs relating to the \nimplementation of the Program and other activities consistent with the objectives \nof  the  Program  and  will  provide  the  necessary  budget  appropriations  to  finance \n\n \n\n30 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n31\n\nthe  structural  adjustment  costs  relating  to  the  implementation  of  reforms  under \nthe Program. \n\nThe policies and actions taken prior to the PESF loan agreement, as described in \nthe  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will  continue  to  be  in \neffect for the duration of the Program and subsequently. \n\nThe Government will keep ADB informed of, and the Government and ADB will \nfrom time to time exchange views on, sector issues and policy reforms that may \nbe  considered  necessary  or  desirable,  including  the  progress  made  in  carrying \nout policies and actions set out in the policy letter and the policy matrix. \n\nThe  Government  will  promptly  discuss  with  ADB  problems  and  constraints \nencountered during implementation of the Program and appropriate measures to \novercome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \n\nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral or bilateral agencies that have implications for implementation of the \nProgram, and will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment on any resulting \npolicy  proposals.

Indonesia  enters  the  global  financial  crisis  with  respectable \neconomic  performance.  Economic  growth  accelerated  to  a  10-year  high  of  6.3%  in  2007. \nDespite  unstable  global  financial  markets  and  a  slowing  world  economy,  Indonesia  did  not \nexperience a growth slowdown in the first half of 2008 and economic growth remained strong at \n6.1%  in  the  third  quarter  (Q3)  (Figure  A4.1[a]).  Available  estimates  suggest  that  growth  in  Q4 \nremained  relatively  robust,  bringing  economic  growth  to  about  6%  in  2008.  Economic  growth \nhas  become  broader  based,  with  a  strong  pickup  in  investment  and  stronger  export \nperformance  attributed  to  high  prices  of  commodities  during  the  first  half  of  the  year \n(Figure A4.1[b]). Economic growth since 2006 appears to have been more employment friendly \nsince unemployment declined from 10.3% in 2006 to 8.3% in 2008 (Figure A4.1[c]). The poverty \nrate has also fallen significantly, reaching the pre-crisis level of 16.6% in 2007 and falling further \nto 15.4% in 2008.  \n \n3. \nLooking  ahead,  global  growth  is  expected  to  slow  sharply  to  its  lowest  pace  since  the \n2001 recession, and global financial conditions are expected to tighten further. The International \nMonetary  Fund  (IMF)1 revised  its  forecasts  in  January  2009  and  suggested  that  global  growth \nwould  fall  to  0.5%  in  2009  from  3.8%  in  2008.  Against  uncertainties  in  the  financial  markets, \nactivities  in  the  advanced  economies  are  expected  to  contract  by  2%.  Economic  growth  in \nemerging  and  developing  economies  is  also  expected  to  slow  sharply  to  3.2%  from  6.2%  in \n2008  because  of  falling  export  demand,  lower  commodity  prices,  and  much  tighter  external \nfinancing constraints. The global economy is projected to experience gradual recovery in 2010, \nbut  the  outlook  is  highly  uncertain.  Against  this  backdrop,  economic  growth  in  Indonesia  is \nexpected to decelerate in 2009 because of a projected sharp reduction in external demand for \nexports. The recent decline in commodity prices will also have a negative impact on Indonesia. \nProjected  decline  in  capital  inflows,  particularly  foreign  direct  investment,  would  constrain \ninvestment. Private consumption, the largest source of growth, would be hurt by more sluggish \nearning,  expected  higher  levels  of  unemployment  and  underemployment,  and  public  desire  to \nsave  during  uncertain  times.  The  Government  plans  to  introduce  a  modest  fiscal  stimulus  to \nprevent  a  sharp  economic  slowdown,  which  could  significantly  reverse  progress  in  reducing \npoverty.  \n \n4. \nInflation. While inflation has been a major concern since the start of 2008, the pressure \nhas eased since Q3 2008. Like in many countries in the region, inflationary pressure was driven \nby  largely  external  factors  related  to  escalating  international  prices  of  food  and  commodities \n(Figure A4.1[d]). Domestic factors also contributed as lending to the private sector grew by over \n30% in Q3 2008. In response to the rising inflation, Bank Indonesia progressively increased its \nrate  by  150  basis  points  to  9.50%  in  October  2008.  However,  year-on-year  Consumer  Price \nIndex  (CPI)  inflation  fell  from  a  peak  of  12.1%  in  August  to  7.9%  by  March  2009.

Indonesia\u2019s stock markets and the rupiah have been \nadversely  affected  by  the  global  financial  crisis.  After  being  one  of  the  best  performers  in \nSoutheast Asia in 2007, the stock market index (JSX) experienced very large correction in 2008. \nAs of 30 December 2008, the stock market index had plummeted more than 50% for the year, \nwith over a quarter of the decline occurring since early October (Figure A4.2[a]). After moving \nbroadly stable against the US dollar since mid-2006, the rupiah came under pressure from early \nOctober to late November and depreciated by more than 30%. The rupiah has recovered part of \nthe \nloss  and  stabilized  around  Rp11,000\u2013Rp12,000  per  $1  since  December  2008 \n(Figure A4.2[b]).  Initially,  Bank  Indonesia  intervened  heavily  in  the  spot  market  in  September \nand  October,  driven  in  part  by  concerns  that  a  large  depreciation  of  the  rupiah  would  risk \n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 4 \n\n49\n\ntriggering  domestic  capital  flight.  Subsequently,  Bank  Indonesia  reduced  its  net  intervention  in \nNovember  and  allowed  the  rupiah  to  find  its  new  equilibrium.  The  public  adjusted  well  to  a \nsignificant  depreciation  of  the  rupiah  and  the  feared  domestic  capital  flight  did  not  occur.  The \nforeign reserve position of Bank Indonesia has remained relatively stable since November 2008.  \n\nFigure A4.2: Financial Sector Performance \n\n(a) JSX Composite Index                                    (b) Rupiah Exchange Rate against US Dollar  \n\n \n \n \n\n3000\n\n13000\n \n\n12000\n\n11000\n\n10000\n\n9000\n\n8000\n\n2500\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                             \n                                                                                  \n   \n \n \n\nOct-08\n\nJan-08\n\nJan-09\n\nApr-08\n\nJul-08\n\n500\n\n25\n\n10\n\n \n\n(c) Banking System CAR and NPL                       (d) Banking System LDR and Liquidity     \n\nJan-08\n\nApr-08\n\nJul-08\n\nOct-08\n\nJan-09\n\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nRHS\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJan-\n06\n                                                     \n \n \nCAR  =  capital  adequacy  ratio,  JSX  =  stock  market  index,  LDR  =  loan  to  deposit  ratio,  NPL  =  nonperforming  loan \nratio. \nSources: Bank Indonesia and CEIC Data Company Ltd. \n\nLiquidity\n\nJan-\n07\n\nJan-\n08\n\nJan-\n09\n\nJan-\n06\n\nJan-\n05\n\nLDR\n\nJul-\n08\n\nJul-\n07\n\nJul-\n06\n\nJul-\n05\n\nJan-\n08\n\nJan-\n07\n\nJan-\n05\n\nJan-\n09\n\nCAR\n\nRHS\n\nJul-\n05\n\nJul-\n06\n\nJul-\n08\n\nJul-\n07\n\nNPL\n\n10\n\n15\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n \n\n6. \nDomestic  Banking  System.  The  direct  impacts  of  the  global  financial  crisis  on  the \ndomestic  banking  system  have  been  limited  so  far.  The  banking  system  has  not  been \nsignificantly affected by direct effects of the global crisis because of limited direct investment in \ntroubled US assets. The banking system, which accounts for nearly 80% of the financial sector\u2019s \nassets,  remains  relatively  strong.  As  shown  in  Figure  A4.2(c),  the  average  capital  adequacy \nratio of the banking system has declined slightly since early 2008, but remained relatively high \nat  18%  in  February  2009.  Nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  increased  slightly  relative  to  end-2008 \nbut remained low at 4.3% in February 2009. After declining to around 14% in October 1008, the \nliquidity\u2013assets  ratio  has  improved  marginally  to  16%  in  February  2009  (Figure A4.2[d]). \nHowever,  the  banking  sector  is  expected  to  face  new  challenges  going  forward.  US  dollar \nliquidity  in  the  banking  system  has  remained  very  tight  since  September  2008  due  to  capital \noutflow.  Projected  weakening  economic  growth  going  forward  would  affect  corporations  and \n\n25\n\n20\n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nresult  in  rising  NPLs  and  erosion  of  bank  capital.  Nonbank  financial  institutions  have  also \nfinanced  a  large  proportion  of  their  borrowing  needs  from  foreign  sources,  so  they  will  be \naffected by the tightening global financial market. These corporations will need to rely more on \ndomestic  lending  in  future,  which  could  tighten  liquidity  further.  Moreover,  given  Indonesia\u2019s \nexposure  to  externally  mobile  capital,  continued  volatility  in  international  financial  markets  and \nspikes in global risk aversion could cause further disruptive capital outflows.  \n\n7. \nGovernment Policy Response. The Government is well aware of the challenges ahead \nand  has  taken  a  number  of  proactive  measures.  To  reduce  the  likelihood  of  further  disruption \nand maintain the stability of the financial system, the President of Indonesia issued the financial \nsafety net regulation to establish clearly the roles, responsibilities, and procedures that govern \nthe  actions  and  responses  of  Bank  Indonesia,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  Deposit  Insurance \nCorporation  in  the  event  of  the  failure  of  a  financial  institution.  The  Government  also  issued \nGovernment  Regulation  No.  66/2008  to  increase  the  ceiling  on  deposit  insurance  from  Rp100 \nmillion to Rp2 billion, while giving the Government the authority to raise the deposit insurance \nceiling  further  or  issue  a  blanket  universal  guarantee  quickly  if  circumstances  demand.  These \nmeasures have, to date, helped maintain the stability of the Indonesian banking system. In the \nrecent  case  of  a  small  nonsystemic  bank  failure,  the  measures  empowered  the  regulatory \nauthorities  to  take  control  of  the  situation  quickly.  Monetary  policy  moved  to  ease  liquidity, \nincluding  December\u2019s  cut  in  interest  rates.  Bank  Indonesia  has  also  introduced  a  rediscount \nwindow for trade finance. This facility would facilitate exporters to repatriate export earnings to \nhelp with domestic US dollar liquidity and encourage them to deal with high-rated international \nfinancial institutions for safety. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nBalance  of  Payments.  The  balance  of  payments  surplus  is  expected  to  decline  amid \nthe pressure from the global financial crisis.  Indonesia recoded a balance of payments surplus \nof 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 and remained robust in the first half of 2008 \n(Figure  A4.3[a]).  The  global  financial  crisis  has  put  increased  pressure  on  the  balance  of \npayments.  Exports  year-on-year  have  started  to  decline  sharply  since  December  because  of \nfalling  commodity  prices  and  a  slowdown  in  demand  from  developed  countries.  Although \ndeclining,  imports  remained  relatively  strong  during  the  same  period  because  of  the  need  for \nmaterials  and  capital  goods  (Figure  A4.3[b]).  As  a  result,  the  balance  of  payment  surplus \nreceded  significantly  at  the  end  of  2008.  The  capital  and  financial  accounts  worsened \nconsiderably  as  negative  sentiment  spurred  by  the  global  financial  crisis  prompted  a  large \ncapital  outflow  in  October.  Part  of  the  outflow,  however,  was  compensated  by  large  official \ncapital inflows in December.    \n\nExternal Sector  \n\n9. \nPublic  and  Private  Sectors.  Overall,  exposure  of  both  the  private  and  public  sectors \nappears  manageable.  Indonesian  firms  have  increasingly  financed  their  investment  through \nretained  earnings,  and  leverage  ratios  in  the  corporate  sector  have  fallen.  The  IMF  estimates \nthat  Indonesian  firms  obtained  almost  half  of  their  external  financing  from  foreign  sources  in \n2007.2 This  exposure  makes  firms  vulnerable  to  rollover  risks  if  the  current  global  financial \nmarket conditions continue. Bank Indonesia Bank suggests that about $22 billion of short-term \npublic  and  private  external  debt  due  in  2009.  About  30%  corporations  owe  to  their  parent \ncompanies  overseas  and  some  are  expected  to  rollover  their  debt.  With  sufficient  level  of \n\n                                                 \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2008.

The  global  financial  crisis  has  heightened  the  risk  of  capital  flight \nsignificantly. Indonesia is more vulnerable to capital flight because of its relatively open capital \naccount  and  significant  foreign  presence  in  its  stock  and  bond  markets.  While  significant \namounts of external capital have already been withdrawn from the country\u2019s financial markets, \nIndonesia  remains  vulnerable  to  further  capital  flight.  Foreigners  still  holds  around  14%,  or \nRp9 trillion,  of  the  stock  of  government  bonds.  In  addition,  domestic  investors  have  been \nsensitive  to  exchange  rate  movements,  which  could  be  triggered  by  another  cycle  of  foreign \ncapital repatriation caused by liquidity demands and rising risk. Although experience in January \nto March 2009 suggests that domestic investors have started to adjust to larger exchange rate \nmovements,  it  is  too  early  to  be  certain.  While  nonbank  financial  corporations  are  believed  to \nhave  reasonably  well-diversified  sources  of  finance  and  not  to  be  significantly  leveraged, \nexperience  indicates  that  domestic  capital  markets  are  quite  volatile  and  subject  to  sudden \nchanges in sentiment originating in domestic and international markets. In addition, the size of \nthe Government\u2019s gross financing needs could still pose risks despite the country\u2019s strong fiscal \nposition. In brief, prolonged instability in international financial markets and protracted recession \nepisodes in developed countries may pose challenges to the country\u2019s balance of payments.  \n \nD. \n \n11. \nBudget. The Government almost achieved a balance budget in 2008. An early estimate \nof the central government budget outturn for 2008 suggests that the budget deficit is reduced to \n0.1%  of  GDP,  compared  with  1.3%  of  GDP  in  2007.  The  improvement  in  the  Government\u2019s \nbudgetary position reflects continued fiscal discipline, policy actions to address energy subsidies, \nand  significant  progress  in  improving  tax  collections.  In  May  2008,  the  Government  raised \nsubsidized fuel prices by an average of 29%, relieving some of the budgetary burden of soaring \n\nFiscal Sector and Debt Sustainability \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\noil  prices.  Significant  growth  in  government  revenue  collection  since  late  2007  has  also \nstrengthened  Indonesia\u2019s  fiscal  position.  Total  tax  revenues  in  2008  were  about  34%  higher \nthan  tax  revenues  in  2007  levels  because  (i)  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  tax \nadministration  and  tax  registration  expanded  the  tax  base  through  the  Sunset  Policy,  (ii)   tax \noffice  internal  personnel  management  improved,  (iii)  targeting  of  special  taxpayers  was \nenhanced, and (iv) efforts to resolve a backlog of value-added tax refunds led to artificially low \nvalue-added tax revenues in 2007. The Sunset Policy encourages the public to have a tax file \nnumber  and  allows  them  to  pay  incorrect  tax  returns  from  previous  years  without  penalty. \nTherefore, part of the increased revenue collection in 2008 is expected to be one-off. \n \n12. \nBudget  Law.  The  2009  budget  law  passed  in  November  2008  continued  the  spirit  of \nfiscal discipline, while containing a number of positive measures. To reduce its financing needs, \nthe Government initially targeted a budget deficit of 1% of GDP. The budget contains provisions \nto  ensure  that  priority  publicly  funded  infrastructure  projects  are  financed  even  if  market \nconditions  are  unfavorable.  The  budget  also  protects  social  sector  spending,  in  particular \nfunding  for  the  flagship  community-based  poverty  alleviation  facility,  to  provide  a  cushion  for \nhouseholds that are adversely affected by any growth slowdown. Article 23 of the Budget Law \nprovides the Government with flexibility to provide a fiscal stimulus in the face of a likely growth \nslowdown, while continuing to maintain fiscal discipline.  \n \nThe 2009 budget was based on more optimistic economic growth, higher oil prices, and \n13. \nstronger  rupiah.  With  projected  weakening  growth  in  2009,  a  depreciated  rupiah,  and \nsignificantly lower oil prices, the Government revised the budget assumptions in January 2009. \nAlthough the revision helps the expenditure side, through a reduction in government spending \non  subsidies  and  transfers  to  the  subnational  governments  (Rp60.7  trillion),  its  impact  on  the \nrevenue  side  is  much  bigger\u2014tax  revenue  declines  by  Rp64.1  trillion  and  nontax  revenue \ndeclines  by  Rp73.1  trillion.  The  net  effect  of  the  revision  is  a  higher  budget  deficit  of  Rp139.5 \ntrillion  (2.5%  of  GDP).  While  part  of  the  increased  deficit  under  the  revised  budget  will  be \nfinanced by the excess financing of 2008 of about Rp51.3 trillion, the revision requires additional \nbudget financing of about Rp36.9 trillion ($3.4 billion) relative to the budget.  \n  \n14. \nBudgetary  Costs  of  Energy  Subsidies.  In  the  2009  budget,  the  Government  took  a \nfurther  innovative  step  to  try  to  contain  the  budgetary  costs  of  energy  subsidies.  The \nGovernment  is  using  the  current  low  international  fuel  prices  to  educate  the  public  about  the \nbenefit  of  linking  domestic  prices  to  movements  in  international  prices.  The  sharp  fall  in  oil \nprices through November and December 2008 has allowed the Government to reduce domestic \ngasoline  and  diesel  prices  three  times.  Effective  implementation  of  a  well-designed  domestic \nfuel pricing mechanism would contribute to lowering the fiscal risks from the energy policies. In \naddition, in 2009 the Government will reduce the effective base for regional transfers by the total \namount of all subsidies being provided. The measure will effectively reduce the energy subsidy \ncost by 26% for the central Government, while aligning the incentives of regional governments \nin supporting the reduction of fuel subsidies.  \n \n15. \nPublic  Debt.  The  consistent  prudent  fiscal  policy  has  enabled  Indonesia  to  reduce  its \npublic  debt  burden  significantly.  In  the  past  5  years,  Indonesia\u2019s  public  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  has \nfallen  sharply,  from  over  55%  in  2004  to  around  32%  at  the  end  of  2008.  Debt  sustainability \nanalysis  jointly  prepared  by  the  IMF  and  World  Bank  staff  suggest  that,  under  the  baseline \nscenario  of continued  historical  growth  and  low  budget  deficit,  the  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  will  decline \n\n \n\n\f   Appendix 4 \n\n53\n\nfurther  in  2012.3 Under  most  types  of  extreme  shocks,  Indonesia\u2019s  debt  levels  and  servicing \nobligations would remain within most thresholds for concern (Figure A4.4). For example, with a \none-time 30% real depreciation of the rupiah, the debt\u2013GDP ratio would increase debt levels by \na  little  over  10%  of  GDP.  A  reduction  in  future  growth  by  one  standard  deviation will  increase \nthe debt\u2013GDP ratio by around 8%. As noted earlier, despite the country\u2019s strong fiscal position, \ngovernment  finances  have  been  especially  vulnerable  to  spikes  in  global  risk  aversion  and \ncontagion from external markets because of the country\u2019s large gross financing needs. The term \nstructure of Indonesia\u2019s bonds led to sharply higher turnover in 2007 and 2008, and amortization \nis projected to remain at high levels through 2011 (Table A4). \n\nFigure A4.4: Government Debt and Its Sustainability  \n\n(a) Debt-to-GDP Ratio                                              (b) Debt Sustainability Analysis  \n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n \n \n \n\n  \n\n \n\n50\n\n45\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n1SD = One standard deviation \nSources: Ministry of Finance, the World Bank, and International Monetary Fund.\n\n                                                                              \n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\nBaseline\nLow er Grow th by 1SD\n\n30% Depreciation\n\nTable A4: Principal Payment \n(Rp trillion) \n\nITEM \nPrincipal Payment of: \nForeign Loan \nForeign Securities \nDomestic Securities \n \nInterest Payment of: \nForeign Loan \nForeign Securities \nDomestic Securities \n\n2009 \n\n2010  2011 \n\n2012 \n\n2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024 \n\n74.4 \n\u2013 \n42.0 \n \n\n20.5 \n8.9 \n52.7 \n\n60.3 \n\u2013 \n40.6 \n \n\n17.8 \n8.9 \n49.7 \n\n53.4 \n\u2013 \n43.8 \n \n\n15.8 \n8.9 \n46.2 \n\n51.8 \n\u2013 \n46.9 \n \n\n14.0 \n8.9 \n41.4 \n\n53.3 \n\u2013 \n47.5 \n \n\n12.2 \n8.9 \n36.4 \n\n52.2 \n14.2 \n30.2 \n \n\n10.4 \n8.5 \n32.4 \n\n51.8 \n10.1 \n38.9 \n \n\n8.8 \n7.6 \n29.0 \n\n46.5 \n9.8 \n29.9 \n \n\n7.7 \n6.8 \n26.2 \n\n39.5 \n10.9 \n33.8 \n \n\n6.0 \n6.1 \n24.3 \n\n37.7 \n20.8 \n37.8 \n \n\n4.9 \n5.0 \n22.0 \n\n35.5 \n\u2013 \n37.5 \n \n\n3.9 \n4.3 \n19.6 \n\n33.5 \n\u2013 \n45.9 \n \n\n3.0 \n4.3 \n16.7 \n\n27.4 \n\u2013 \n26.9 \n \n\n2.2 \n4.3 \n12.8 \n\n21.1 \n\u2013 \n34.8 \n \n\n1.6 \n4.3 \n10.9 \n\n15.6 \n\u2013 \n33.3 \n \n\n1.2 \n4.3 \n8.7 \n\n12.3 \n\u2013 \n19.1 \n \n\n0.9 \n4.3 \n6.4 \n\n\u2013 = data not available. \nSource: Ministry of Finance.\n\n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2009.

It  also  provides  the  background  to  identification  of \nissues  and  policy  options.  Employment  creation  and  poverty  reduction  are  the  Government\u2019s \ntwo key policy priorities. In its Medium-Term Development Plan 2004\u20132009, the Government\u2019s \ngoal  is  to  reduce  unemployment  to  5%  and  poverty  to  14%  by  the  end  of  this  year. \nImprovements in the business climate, infrastructure, and social policy spending are central to \nits strategy. However, achieving these goals of lower poverty and unemployment in 2009 is now \nunlikely  and  the  indicators  are  expected  to  deteriorate  given  the  current  adverse  economic \nconditions.   \n \nA. \n \n2. \nSluggish  Labor  Market. \nIndonesia  experienced  a  decade  of \nsluggish  labor  market  performance \nafter  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of \n1997\u20131998.  From  2000  to  2006, \naggregate employment rose steadily \nby  an  average  of  1.0%  per  annum. \nHowever,  it  was  slower  than  growth \nin  the  labor  force  (about  2.0%  per \nrising \nannum), \nunemployment. \nOpen \nunemployment  increased  from  an \naverage  of  4.0%  in  the  1990s  to \nIn  2001,  BPS \n6.7% \npublished  an  expanded  definition  of \nunemployment \nan \nto \nestimate  of  \u201cdiscouraged\u201d  workers \n(workers who have given up hope of \nfinding  a  job).  This  added  an  additional  3 million  persons  to  the  unemployment  figures  and \nproduced an unemployment rate of 11.2% in 2005. Figure A5.1 shows that this rate approached \nlevels  in  the  Philippines,  and  was  considerably  higher  than  rates  in  other  Asian  economies \naffected  by  the  crisis  (Korea,  Rep.  of,  Malaysia,  and  Thailand).  This  was  partly  because  the \nfaster pace of manufacturing growth in the other countries created a large number of jobs and \nhelped to absorb the growing labor force. \n \nOther  Weaknesses.

It also contrasted with the pre-crisis years when high investment, including foreign \ndirect investment, combined with export-led growth, was a major source of employment creation. \nDuring  those  years,  real  wages  increased  as  labor  moved  from  low  productivity  jobs  in \nagriculture  and  traditional  services  to  higher  productivity  jobs  in  modern  manufacturing  and \nservices. Figure A5.2 shows where new labor force entrants found (or did not find) jobs in pre- \nand  post-crisis  periods.  From  1991  to  1997,  two-thirds  of  new  job  seekers  found  jobs  in  the \nformal  sector,  about  16%  entered  informal  sector  activities,  and  the  remainder  became \nunemployed. These trends were reversed after the crisis, with 55% of new job seekers entering \nthe informal sector, 11% becoming unemployed, and only 33% finding jobs in the higher paying \nformal sector.  \n \nEconomic  Growth.  Growth \n4. \nin  2007  and  2008  was  accompanied \nby  a  corresponding  pickup  in  wage \nemployment  for  the  first  time  since \n1997.  A  steady  rise  in  growth  since \n2006\u2014reaching  6%  or  more\u2014\nincreased  demand  for  regular  wage \nemployment  by  an  average  of  about \n2.5%  per  annum  in  2007  and  2008, \nthe \nin  a  decade. \nUnemployment also declined from its \npeak  of  11.2%  in  2005  to  8.4%  in \n2008 (Figure A5.1).  \n \n5. \nHowever,  empirical  analysis \nsuggests  that  more  regular  wage \njobs should have been created in the \nlast  7  years.  Empirical  analysis  of \nlabor  demand  indicates  that  a  1% \nincrease  in  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  results  in  a  0.43%  increase  in  formal  wage  employment.  Analysis  also  shows  that \nemployment growth tends to lag real GDP growth by about 12 months. With economic growth \naveraging  above  5%  since  2000,  and  reaching  6%  in  2007  and  2008,  about  4  million  regular \nwage jobs should have been created from 2001 to 2008, assuming all other things unchanged. \nHowever, total regular wage employment increased by only 3.2 million, giving a shortfall of up to \n800,000 jobs:  \n \nlog Formal Employment(t) =     -3.6 +   0.11logGDP(t) + 0.43logGDP(t-1) \n \n*** significant at 10% level.

Increased \n6. \nlabor  policy  rigidities  since  2000  have \ndampened  employment  recovery.  An \naggressive  minimum  wage  policy  and \nseverance  pay \nthe  doubling  of \nentitlements  in  2000  help  explain  the \nslow  recovery  in  wage  employment \nduring \nperiod.  A  National \nDevelopment  and  Planning  Agency \n(BAPPENAS)  Labor  Policy  Review  in \n20033 argued that substantial increases \nin  minimum  wages  from  2000  to  2003 \ndampened  employment  creation.  A \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment-Growth,  Investment  and \nTrade  Project  (USAID-GIAT)  survey  of \n100 firms4 observed that substantial increases in severance rates after 2000 had coincided with \nreduced  hiring  of  permanent  workers  in  the  modern  economy.  Labor  market  rigidities\u2014most \nimportantly  minimum  wages  and  severance  costs\u2014were  cited  in  the  USAID-GIAT  survey  as \namong  the  key  factors  inhibiting  investment  in  labor-intensive  sectors.  Minimum  wages  have \nrisen substantially in the post-crisis period, increasing by more than 50% in real terms in some \nmajor  industrial  centers  from  2000  to  2003,  but  moderated  from  2004  to  2008.  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) staff estimates suggest that minimum wage increases in Indonesia do \nnot affect employment in the short term (less than 12 months) for most groups of workers, but  \nreduce  employment  of  youths,  females,  and  low  educated  workers  in  the  longer  term. 5 \nSeverance  pay  is  another  major  rigidity  in  the  labor  market.  Rates  have  more  than  doubled \nsince  1996  and  are  now  among  the  highest  in  the  region  (Table  A5.1).  Severance  regulation \nhas discouraged employers from engaging workers on a permanent basis. \n \n7. \nIn this context of relatively rigid labor market policies, a sharp slowdown in the economy \nis likely to lead to job losses in the formal sector and rising youth unemployment.  BAPPENAS \nprojects that under different growth scenarios, unemployment could rise between 500,000 and \n1,000,000 persons in 2009, mainly youth unemployment.  Job losses are likely  to  first  occur  in \nthe  export  sector  (especially  in  labor-intensive  sectors  such  as  garments,  footwear,  and \nelectronics)  and  later  in  services,  as  the  economic  slowdown  becomes  more  broad-based  by \nmid-2009.  Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  job  losses  are  occurring  at  a  rapid  rate  in  some \nthe  Department  of  Manpower  and \nsectors,  such  as  garments.  Data  collected \nTransmigration  show  14,000  job  losses  in  the  garment  center  of  Bandung  in  West  Java  in \nJanuary alone, and several thousands of workers have been laid off in Jakarta and East Java in \nrecent weeks, indicating that the worst effects may be based in urban centers.    \n \nB. \n \n8. \nFiscal Expansion. In the short term, the Government\u2019s fiscal expansion will save some \njobs. Under its fiscal stimulus package, the Government has temporarily removed income tax on \nwages of less than Rp5 million per month in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, and this \n\nPolicies to Boost Employment \n\nfrom \n\n                                                 \n3 National Development Planning Agency, 2003.

The  Government  has  also  allocated \nfunding to some of its poverty reduction programs which have employment components, such \nas  the  national  community  empowerment  program  (PNPM).  This  should  create  some  jobs  but \nthese will be insufficient to offset expected losses in the export sector over the coming months. \nThe  Government\u2019s  focus  will  be  to  provide  assistance  to  families  vulnerable  to  poverty  as  a \nresult  of  job  losses.  The  newly  established  poverty  monitoring  unit  at  BAPPENAS  will  collect \ntimely  employment  data  by  region  and  sector,  which  will  aid  policy  makers  to  develop  timely \nmitigating  responses.  The  extension  of  the  unconditional  cash  transfer  (UCT)  program, \namounting to $345 million to the first quarter (Q1) of 2009, will also provide some assistance to \nfamilies that are vulnerable to falling into poverty because of job losses. This program may be \nextended  to  several  months.  However,  sustained  economic  growth  above  6%  is  necessary  to \ngenerate sufficient jobs in the modern sector to absorb new job entrants in the market over the \nnext decade. Therefore, with the likelihood that the global economy will not begin recovery until \nlater in 2010, jobs losses are expected to continue over the next 18 months.   \n \n9. \nPolicy Reform. Over the longer term, reforms to labor market policies will be necessary \nto  boost  formal  employment.  In  May  2006,  the  Government  proposed  a  comprehensive  labor \npolicy  reform  program  as  part  of  its  \u201cwhite  paper\u201d  to  improve  the  investment  climate.  Reforms \nincluding  reducing  severance  rates,  allowing  fixed-term  contracts  cumulatively  up  to  5  years \nbefore employee conversion to permanent status, permitting outsourcing to core activities, and \nlinking  wage  adjustments  to  productivity  are  critical  for  employment  creation.  Major  unions \nrallied  against  the  proposals  in  May  2006.  In  response,  the  Government  postponed \nimplementation  of  reforms.  There  is  less  appetite  for  such  reforms  under  current  economic \nconditions,  and  in  an  election  year.  Nevertheless,  over  the  longer  term,  reforms  to  severance \npay  and  fixed-term  contract  arrangements  will  be  necessary  to  boost  job  recovery  once  the \nglobal economic crisis subsides. \n \n\n \nTable A5.2: Poverty Rates \n% Poor People (headcount index) \n\nin \n\n 9.7 \n\n13.8 \n\n12.3 \n\n13.7 \n\n15.1 \n\n13.8 \n\n14.3 \n\n13.4 \n\n16.8 \n\nYear \n\n1993 \n\n1990 \n\nTotal \n\n1996  \n\nRural \n\n1996**\n\nUrban \n\nRecent \n\nDevelopments \n\nPoverty  Reduction. \n\nC. \nPoverty \n \n10. \nIndonesia \nhas  made  much  progress  in  reducing \npoverty.

However,  the \nreduction  in  fuel  subsidies  and  surge  in \nrice prices in 2006 lifted the poverty rate \nto  17.8%.  Price  stability,  a  strong  rise  in \neconomic  growth,  and \njob  creation \nhelped  bring  poverty  down  to  15.4%  by \nMarch  2008  (or  35  million  persons)  as \nshown \nin  most \ndeveloping economies, poverty is a rural \nphenomenon,  with  rural  poverty  rates  around  18%.

Modest shocks to family income\u2014\nsuch  as  drought  and  other  natural  disasters,  and  high  inflation\u2014can  push  millions  of  families \ninto  poverty  as  about  30%  of  the  population  resides  slightly  above  the  poverty  line.  Public \nservices  remain  inadequate  for  a  middle-income  country,  and  the  other  dimensions  of  poverty \nare also major problems in terms of high malnutrition and maternal mortality rates, inadequate \naccess  to  safe  water  and  sanitation,  and  insufficient  education  outcomes.  Access  to  rural \ninfrastructure  is  limited.  Inequality  is  increasing  and  disparities  between  regions  remain  high, \nwith  regional  pockets  of  relatively  high  and  severe  poverty  in  East  Indonesia  (East  and  West \nNusa Tenggara), Papua, and Lampung (Figure A5.3).   \n \nAntipoverty  Measures.  The \n12. \nGovernment  has \nintroduced  several \nantipoverty  programs  and  measures  to \naddress \nthe  different  dimensions  of \npoverty  in  Indonesia.  Three  key  lessons \nlearned  from  the  1998  financial  crisis \nimportance  of \nwere: \nestablishing \nsocial \nassistance or poverty alleviation program \nthat  could  be  quickly  activated  or  scaled \nup, (ii) the need for a poverty  monitoring \nand \nand \ncoordination  mechanism, \nsome  public \nreorient \n(iii) need \nexpenditures  toward  social  policy  linked \nto  breaking  the  cycle  of  family  poverty. \nThe  Government  introduced  the  UCT \nprogram  in  2005  to  mitigate  the  income \neffects of the fuel price increase. This program was reactivated in 2008 in response to the surge \nin inflation. About 19 million families were covered by the UCT in 2008. Preliminary data from \nthe  2008  Susenas  indicate  that  the  UCT  program  has  been  effective  in  keeping  60%  of \nhousehold  recipients  from  falling  into  poverty  in  2007  and  30%  of  recipients  had  actually \nescaped  poverty.  The  Government  is  also  piloting  the  conditional  cash  transfer  program, \nwhereby  transfers  are  linked  to  family  progress  in  child  school  attendance  and  child  health \nindicators. Currently, the program covers six provinces and 1 million families although progress \ntoward  a  national  rollout  has  been  slow  because  of  institutional  capacity  constraints  at  the \nsubnational  level.  Since  2004,  real  spending  on  education  and  health  in  the  national  and \nsubnational  budgets  have  increased  substantially  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term \nobjective of universal education and health.  \n \n13. \nPoverty Impact of Financial Crisis. The current adverse economic situation threatens \nto  reverse  recent  gains  in  poverty  reduction.  The  economy  is  expected  to  slow  down  in  2009, \nwith  growth  projections  ranging  from  2.0%  to  4.5%.  Exports  in  January  declined  by  36%  on  a \nyear-on-year  basis,  suggesting  that  the  lower  end  of  projections  is  an  increasingly  likely \noutcome  for  2009.  BAPPENAS  estimates  that,  under  its  low-growth  scenario  (4%),  about \n5 million  additional  persons  will  need  social  assistance  during  the  downturn  (about  2%  of  the \npopulation)  in  2009.  If  economic  growth  falls  to  2%,  these  numbers  will  be  much  higher. \nMoreover,  a  slowing  economy  reduces  government  revenues  which  in  turn  threaten  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to protect the large increases in social spending made in the last 2 years.  \n\nEN = East Nusa Tenggara, WN = West Nusa Tenggara.  \nSource: Susenas, National Bureau of Statistics, Jakarta. \n\nN\nT\ne\nn\ng\ng\na\nr\na\n\nY\no\ng\ny\na\nk\na\nr\nt\n\nT\ne\nn\ng\ng\na\nr\na\n\nL\na\nm\np\nu\nn\ng\n\nS\nu\nm\nb\na\nr\n\nB\ne\nn\ng\nk\nu\n\nS\nu\nm\ns\ne\n\nP\na\np\nu\na\n\nJ\na\nk\na\nr\nt\n\nS\nu\nm\nu\n\nJ\na\nb\na\nr\n\nto \n\nJ\na\nm\nb\n\ne\nn\ng\n\ne\nn\ng\n\ne\nn\ng\n\nb\na\nr\n\nb\na\nr\n\n  \n\nS\nu\n\nK\na\n\nK\na\n\nS\nu\n\nS\nu\n\nS\nu\n\nK\na\n\nB\na\n\nK\na\n\na\nu\n\ns\ne\n\ns\ne\n\nJ\na\n\nJ\na\n\nW\n\nl\nt\ni\n\nm\n\nm\n\nN\n\nR\n\nE\n\nl\nt\n\nl\nt\n\nu\n\n0\n\nu\n\na\n\na\n\nt\ni\n\nl\ni\n\nt\n\n.\n\n.\n\nt\n\nt\n\n \n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\ni\n\nl\n\nl\n\ni\n\nl\n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n59\n\nPolicies to Mitigate the Worst Effects of the Global Financial Crisis \n\nD. \n \n14. \nThe Government is acutely aware that the current adverse economic situation threatens \nsubstantial gains made in reducing poverty in recent years. In response to these threats, and to \nprotect  social  spending,  it  will  permit  an  increase  in  the  budget  deficit  from  an  initial  1.0%  of \nGDP  to  2.5%  of  GDP  in  2009.  This  larger  deficit  allows  for  a  fiscal  stimulus  through  a \nsupplementary budget approved by parliament in February 2009. To this effort, the Government \nintends  to  scale  up  its  poverty  alleviation  programs  under  the  supplementary  budget.  These \ninclude  increasing  the  coverage  of  the  subsidized  rice  program  (Raskins),  school  scholarship \nprogram,  extending  the  UCT  into  2009  at  a  cost  of  at  least  $345 million,  and  the  PNPM.  In \naddition,  under  the  Public  Expenditure  Support  Facility,  the  Government  has  established  a \npoverty  monitoring  unit  and  a  coordination  mechanism  to  be  able  to  assess  social  economic \ndata quickly and respond with programs to assist vulnerable families.  \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n60 \n\nAppendix 6  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title:  Indonesia/Public Expenditure Support Facility Program \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\nPolicy-based program loan \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nSoutheast Asia Department/ \nFinancial  Sector,  Public  Management  and  Trade \nDivision \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.

Key Issues  \nThe  current  global  financial  crisis,  while  different  in  nature  and  complexity  from  the  Asian  financial  crisis  in  1997\u20131998,  is \nexpected  to  have  a  marked  impact  on  Indonesia\u2014resulting  in  reduced  economic  growth,  retrenchment,  and  shrinking \nemployment  opportunities;  and  a  general  deterioration  in  living  standards  for  a  significant  portion  of  the  population  (See \nAppendix 5). \n \n2.  Design  Features.  The  PESF  provides  necessary  support  for  government  efforts  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  the  crisis, \nincluding  support  for  a  stimulus  package,  cash  transfer  programs  for  the  poor,  and  maintaining  critical  spending  on  social \nsectors and infrastructure. \n \nC.

Findings of Social Analysis  \nAccording  to  data  from  the  2008  National  Socioeconomic  Survey  (Susenas),  the  Government's  unconditional  cash  transfer \nprogram (UCT) maintained the welfare levels of 60% of household UCT recipients and assisted 30% of recipient households \nto escape from poverty, while about 10% of recipient households fell into poverty because of food price inflation in 2008. The \npolicy  actions  under  the  PESF  support  the  Government  to  maintain  progress  achieved  under  UCT  and  other  poverty \nalleviation programs. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. As part of the PESF \nprocess, extensive consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, including the private sector, civil society \ngroups, and development partners. \n \n2.

This assessment summarizes \nthe current state of these systems and ongoing reforms, with a view to assessing the fiduciary \nrisks related to this development policy loan.  \n\n2. \nThe public financial management systems in Indonesia have strengths and weaknesses. \nThe  strengths  include  a  sound  regulatory  framework  for  most  parts  of  the  budget  cycle;  an \norderly,  transparent,  and  predictable  budget  formulation  process;  fund  predictability  for  budget \nexecution; sound budget classification; comprehensive and transparent budget documentation; \ngovernment  accounting  standards  that  are  aligned  with  comparable  international  standards;  a \nchart of accounts that is broadly consistent with Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) \n2001; and a strengthened external audit institution.   \n\n3. \nThese strong points are the result of a concerted reform effort among key stakeholders \nto the budget process since the political transition in 1998. These efforts were given momentum \nand direction in the 2001 white paper on public financial management reform. Key stakeholders \nto  the  budget  process  remain  committed  to  further  reform  through  an  evolving  and  pragmatic \nreform  agenda.  The  focus  of  government  reform  is  on  the  implementation  of  an  integrated \nfinancial management information system, further unification of the budget, further improvement \nof  the  chart  of  accounts,  restructuring  of  budget  programs,  the  introduction  of  a  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  and  performance-based  budgeting,  full  rollout  of  the  treasury  single \naccount  (TSA),  improvement  of  the  institutional  and  regulatory  framework  for  procurement, \nimprovements to cash and asset management, internal controls, and internal and external audit.   \n\nin  June 2008, 3  a \n\nThe  DPL/DPSP  series  has  had  public  financial  management  as  an  area  of  focus  and \n4. \nhas  contributed  to  significant  improvements  in  the  last  few  years.

(September) \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nKey PFM Issues\u2014Recent Developments and the Way Ahead \n\nB. \n \n5. \nSignificant advances have been made in budget preparation\u2014instituting a state budget, \nwhich combines the previous separate recurrent and development budgets, and improvements \nin  budget  transparency.  However,  problems  in  budget  execution  persist,  with  50%  of  capital \nexpenditure  still  being  spent  in  the  last  quarter.  The  Director  General  (DG)  Treasury  has \nconducted  a  survey  of  the  impediments  to  the  disbursement  of  budgetary  funds  through \nquestionnaires. The results of the survey are being reviewed and will form the basis of an action \nplan to smooth out disbursements during the fiscal year.  \n \n6. \nImplementation  of  a  TSA,  as  foreseen  by  State  Treasury  Law  No.  1/2004,  is  ongoing. \nThe  Treasury,  in  cooperation  with  Bank  Indonesia,  has  tested  the  daily  sweep  of  government \nrevenue  deposits  from  collecting  branches  and  post  offices  into  the  TSA.  Depending  on  the \nsuccess of the pilot test, the daily sweep will be extended to all commercial bank branches. The \npublic  procurement  environment  has  witnessed  improvements  in  the  last  few  years.  However, \nthere are still weaknesses in its regulatory and implementation aspects. Presidential Regulation \nNo.  106/2007  was  signed  in  December  2007  establishing  an  independent  agency  National \nPublic  Procurement  Office  (LKPP)  that  is  responsible  for  planning  and  development  of \nstrategies,  policies,  and  regulations  associated  with  procurement  using  public  funds.  It  is  a \npriority  to  make  the  newly  established  LKPP  operational  by  recruiting  staff  and  allocating \nbudget.   \n\n7. \nThe  Government  Accounting  Standards  are  well  aligned  with  comparable  international \nstandards,  and  the  chart  of  accounts  is  broadly  consistent  with  GFSM  2001.  Aggregate \ngovernment annual financial statements have been prepared in a timely manner for 4 years but \nthere  are  questions  of  reliability.  The  Supreme  Audit  Agency  (BPK)  has  for  the  last  4  years \nissued a \u201cdisclaimer\u201d opinion on these financial statements. Internal control weaknesses in the \npreparation  of  the  financial  statements  and  instances  of  noncompliance  with  applicable \nregulations were cited among the reasons for the disclaimer.   \n\n8. \nThe Government\u2019s internal audit framework is extensive but the institutional structure is \ncomplex.  Government  Regulation  No.  60/2008  on  the  Government\u2019s  Internal  Controls  defines \nmore  clearly  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  different  players  in  internal  audit. The  overall \ninternal control framework continues to be weak, with paper-intensive processes and inefficient \nuse of human resources. The Government is preparing for the implementation of an integrated \nfinancial  management  system  known  as  SPAN  to  replace  the  multitude  of  financial  data \nprocessing applications currently used by government institutions.   \n \n9. \nThe  external  audit  institution,  BPK,  has  received  a  significant  increase  in  its  operating \nbudget to fund an increase in the number of auditors as well as regional offices. The audit report \non the financial statements is submitted to legislature within 5 months after the end of the year.   \n \n10. \nPowerful  independent  oversight  and  prosecutorial  institutions  such  as  the  Corruption \nEradication  Commission  (KPK)  and  the  Anti-Corruption  Court  have  begun  to  deliver  tangible \nresults.  High-profile  corruption  investigations  have  been  launched,  leading  to  a  number  of \nsuccessful prosecutions.   \n \n11. \nParliamentary  oversight  of  budget  processes  has  been  strengthened.  Parliamentary \ncommissions  have  become  particularly  active  in  scrutinizing  and  amending  the  Government\u2019s \ndraft  annual  budget.  The  Government  published  an  IMF  fiscal  transparency  report  and \ndisseminated  throughout  Indonesia.  The  public  availability  of  fiscal  information  is  already \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 8 \n\n        \n\n65\n\nReforming Budget Formulation \n\nimproving and the Government has published a fiscal risk statement together with the 2008 and \n2009 budgets.    \n \n12. \nThese reforms directly influence the environment in which public expenditure is planned, \nbudgeted,  executed,  and  accounted  for  across  all  levels  of  government.  A  more  detailed \ncommentary  on  progress  in  implementing  these  reforms  is  given  below  to  help  identify  the \nattendant  risks  arising  from  the  Borrower\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  this  loan  and  determine  the \nfiduciary arrangements for this operation.  \n \nC. \n \n13. \nFiscal  relationships  between  the  executive  and  legislature  are  defined  in  the  State \nFinance Law No. 17/2003. The House of Representatives (DPR) is the principal legislative body \nand  it  plays  a  significant  role  in  shaping  budget  and  fiscal  policy.  The  budget  is  passed  by \nagreement  between  the  President  and  the  DPR.  The  process  involves  an  examination  by  the \nDPR  of  the  macroeconomic  framework,  macro-fiscal  policies,  and  detailed  budget  allocations. \nThe budget has been the centerpiece of strengthening the legislature vis-\u00e0-vis the executive in \nthe  political  transition  following  1998,  and  the  relative  roles  of  the  executive  and  legislative \nbranches in this area are evolving. \n \nis  comprehensive.  The  main  outstanding  area  of \n14. \nimprovement  is  explanation  of  the  expenditure  implications  of  new  policy  initiatives.  The  laws \ngoverning budget management clearly specify the responsibilities of the minister of finance, and \ncomprehensive  regulations  have  been  developed.  While  the  President,  as  head  of  the \nGovernment,  has  overall  authority  to  exercise  national  fiscal  management,  Law  No.  17/2003 \nclearly delegates the responsibility of overall fiscal management of central government finances \nto  the  minister  of  finance  as  chief  financial  officer.  The  law  also  assigns  responsibilities  to \nindividual  ministers,  governors,  and  other  local  authorities  for  financial  management  and \naccountability in their jurisdictions. \n\nThe  budget  documentation \n\n15. \nProvisions  of  the  new  regulations  are  being  implemented.  Budget  classification  and \nexecution  is  based  on  administrative,  economic,  and  functional  classification  consistent  with \nGFSM 2001. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is developing plans for a medium-term expenditure \nframework  to  guide  budget  policy.  Forward  estimates  at  the  aggregate  level  were  introduced \nwith the 2008 and 2009 budgets. Efforts in BAPPENAS  and MOF are ongoing to redefine the \nbudget program structure, and develop templates and manuals for a medium-term expenditure \nframework and performance-based budgeting. The efforts are planned to be pilot tested in the \ncoming years.  \n \n16. \nreform agenda.  \n\nThe  level  of  extra-budgetary  expenditures  is  not  known  and  the  issue  is  not  on  the \n\n \n\nReforming Budget Execution \n\nD. \n \nIndonesia still spends 50% of its total capital expenditure in the final quarter of the year.5 \n17. \nFor the past 6 years, spending has started slowly and then accelerated toward the end of the \nyear.  This  spending  pattern  is  of  concern  because  project  implementation  is  disrupted  by  an \nadverse  cycle.  Moreover,  under-spending  on  capital  expenditure  constrains  increases  in \n\n                                                 \n5  World  Bank.  2007.

Slow and back-loaded disbursements are symptoms of more severe \nchallenges that are encountered at each stage of the public expenditure management cycle. \n\n18. \nThe  Government  maintains  a  comparatively  rigid  budget  execution  process.  Detailed \ninput controls aim to ensure that the composition of the budget complies with political priorities \nand  that  the  budget  is  not  altered  during  execution.  Spending  warrants  (DIPAs),  while  now \nissued at the start of the fiscal year, contain excessive amounts of detail\u2014leaving little flexibility \nfor adjustments in the composition of inputs needed to carry out a given activity. Reallocations \nacross DIPAs from delayed programs to better-performing ones that could enhance satisfactory \nimplementation of the overall expenditure program require lengthy revision, sometimes involving \nparliament. Such inflexibility creates practical difficulties and inefficiencies. \n\n19.  With expanding fiscal space, public investment is increasing, putting additional pressure \non PFM systems. Planning and executing public investment is inherently more demanding than \ncurrent or mandatory expenditure.  \n\n \n\nto  determine  which  of \n\nReforming Treasury, Cash, and Asset Management \n\nE. \n \n20. \nTransparency  is  still  weakened  by  a  multitude  of  bank  accounts.  The  Director  General \nTreasury itself maintains multiple bank accounts, both in rupiah and foreign currency, at Bank \nIndonesia.  External  audit  reports  from  2004  to  2006  noted  that  around  4,600  bank  accounts \nhave not been reported to the DG Treasury. By the end of December 2007, MOF completed a \ncensus of all government accounts and identified 32,570 accounts. Some 2,086 accounts were \nsubsequently  closed  and  efforts  are  ongoing \nthe  remaining \n30,484 accounts can be included in the TSA regime, either directly or through a mechanism of \ndaily sweeps into the TSA.  \n \n21. \nRegulations associated with Law No. 1/2004 will address this weakness and provide for \n(i) the installation of a TSA at Bank Indonesia; (ii) the conversion of operational bank accounts \nat commercial banks into zero-balance transit accounts; and (iii) a mandatory review at MOF of \nbank accounts of all state agencies outside DG Treasury oversight.. Pilot runs for testing zero-\nbalance  arrangements  with  commercial  banks  for  the  expenditure  accounts  have  been \nsuccessful.  Rollout  of  the  TSA  to  the  revenue  accounts,  which  was  initially  scheduled  for  the \nfirst quarter (Q1) of 2008, has been postponed. This is due to pending negotiations with Bank \nIndonesia  and  commercial  banks  on  interest  payments  for  government  balances held  at  Bank \nIndonesia, and remuneration of banking services by the Government. The daily sweep will cover \ndeposits made the previous day\u2014not on the same day\u2014since commercial banks have agreed \nnot  to  charge  for  this  service  provided  the  sweep  is  done  the  following  day.  This  would  be  a \nsignificant  improvement  to  the  current  practice,  established  in  1989,  of  sweeping  revenue \naccounts twice a week. \n \n22. \nThe  implementing  regulation  for  Law  No.  1/2004,  Government  Regulation  No.  36/2007 \non  Cash  Management,  was  issued  in  July  2007  detailing  the  governance  and  setup  of  cash \nmanagement.  In  addition,  a  number  of  MOF  regulations  (PMK)  have  been  issued  to  further \nestablishment of the TSA: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nPMK  57  is  the  generic  PMK  to  regulate  opening  of  bank  accounts  by  the  line \nministries.  \nPMK 58 mandates a census of the existing line ministry accounts.  \nPMK 59 mandates senior officers (echelon I) of MOF to disclose bank accounts, \nif any are being operated.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 8 \n\n        \n\n67\n\nThe  cash-based  accounting  system  generates \n\ntimely  records  of  revenue  and \n23. \nexpenditure  transactions,  but  does  not  track  monthly  arrears.  Transaction  records  are \nelectronically  transmitted  to  the  directorate  of  accounts  at  DG  Treasury  headquarters  for \nconsolidation  and  generation  of  periodic  reports  on  budget  execution.  However,  DG  Treasury \nplans to move toward an accrual recording system, which would make this possible. \n\nThe  past \n\nProcurement Reforms \n\n24.  MOF is preparing the implementation of an integrated financial management system to \nreplace  the  multitude  of  financial  data  processing  applications  currently  used  by  government \ninstitutions.  The  system  is  known  as  SPAN.  It  will  integrate  and  replace  the  multiple  software \napplications  within  the  Treasury  as  well  as  those  being  implemented  in  the  DG  Budget  to \nsupport  the  budget  formulation  process.  Following  some  delay,  the  second  stage  bidding \nprocess for SPAN was initiated in August 2008 and the contract for provision of turnkey services \nfor  SPAN  is  expected  to  be  signed  by  April  2009.  A  new  management  and  implementation \nstructure for the project is now being established.  \n \n25. \nGovernment  assets  are  not  comprehensively  recorded,  properly  organized,  or  fairly \nvalued.  An  integrated  and  automated  asset  management  system,  which  will  enable  the \nGovernment to optimize the use of its assets across ministries and regions, will be established \nin 2009.     \n \nF. \n \n26. \nthe  public  procurement \nenvironment.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  provided  a  national  public  procurement \nregulation  that  meets  most  of  what  is  generally  regarded  as  accepted  international  practice, \nincluding  the  basic  principles  of  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and \nefficiency.  This  decree  also  requires  the  establishment  of  a  national  public  procurement  office \nas  a  regulatory  body  for  public  procurement.  With  the  introduction  of  Keppres  No.  80/2003,  a \nprevious certification (\u201cpre-qualification\u201d) process for suppliers/providers of goods and services \nwas, in most instances, abandoned by the Government. This previously led to segmentation of \nthe market, especially at the provincial level. Keppres No. 80/2003 also established the basis for \nsanctions, complaint handling, and requirements for certification of users.  \n \n27. \nHowever, the public procurement system still has significant deficiencies in its regulatory \nand, more importantly, implementation aspects. There have been delays in establishing a strong \nregulatory  body;  slow  progress  in  the  development  of  procurement  regulations  anchored  by  a \nlaw;  slow  progress  in  the  development  of  standard  tools  in  terms  of  bidding  documents  and \nusers  manuals;  weakness  in  procurement  capacity  in  implementing  agencies,  especially  at \nprovincial  and  district  levels;  and  collusion  and  corruption  practices  in  the  bidding  process  as \nwell as concerns over the efficiency of anticorruption and sanction measures.  \n\nfew  years  have  witnessed \n\nimprovements \n\nin \n\nthe  World  Bank  and  Organisation \n\n28. \nThis is supported by the findings of some analytical tools and reports, such as the self-\ndiagnostic  assessment  conducted  by  the  LKPP  in  2007,  using  the  baseline  indicators  tool \ndeveloped  under \nfor  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) Development Assistance Committee Procurement Round Table initiative. \nThe  assessment  of  the  baseline  indicators  presents  a  snapshot  comparison  of  the  actual \nsystem  against  the  international  standards  or  the  \u201cmodel  system\u201d  that  the  baseline  indicators \nrepresent. Baseline benchmarking of Indonesia\u2019s procurement system in June 2007 showed it \nscoring  62.5%  for  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  (pillar  I),  55%  for  institutional \nframework and management capacity (pillar II), 59.3% for procurement operations and market \npractices  (pillar  III),  and  69%  for  integrity  and  transparency  of  the  public  procurement  system \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n(pillar  IV)  in  comparison  with  recognized  international  standards.  Other  studies  indicate  that \nthere is significant room for improvement. \n\n29. \nLKPP  will  report  directly  to  the  President  of  Indonesia.  The  organizational  structure  for \nthe new LKPP is being developed. In addition to the chair, who heads LKPP, and an executive \nsecretary,  there  will  be  four  departments,  each  headed  by a  deputy  with  responsibilities  for  (i) \nstrategy  and  policy  development;  (ii)  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  information  systems;  (iii) \nhuman  resources  development;  and  (iv)  legal  affairs  and  settlement  of  objections.  LKPP  is \ncurrently staffing echelon II positions and is expected to fill all the staffing needs by the end of \n2009. \n\n30. \nA  number  of  laws  have  been  enacted  since  2000  that  affect,  or  refer  to,  public \nprocurement. These include civil works, state finance, treasury, audit, and small-scale business. \nThe pace of Indonesia\u2019s decentralization reforms has impacted on public sector procurement at \nall  levels  of  government\u2014ministers,  governors,  and  even  mayors  are  able  to  issue  decrees, \nregulations,  and  instructions.  The  plethora  of  regulations  is  often  inconsistent  and  many \nregulations  do  not  meet  accepted  international  practice.  Consequently,  national  procurement \nreform and the need for national procurement policies and standards are critical. \n\n31. \nIndonesia\u2019s legal framework for public sector procurement can best be strengthened by \nanchoring  it  with  an  overarching  consolidated  and  comprehensive  national  public  sector \nprocurement  law  at  the  highest  level  that  (i)  establishes  the  fundamental  principles  and \nprocedures applicable to all public sector procurement; (ii) allows for the imposition of sanctions \nwhere the principles and procedures, particularly those relating to good governance and ethics, \nare not met; (iii) amends other laws that refer to public sector procurement; and (iv) ensures that \nsuch  a  law  has  the  necessary  authority  in  a  decentralized  environment.  LKPP  is  currently \ndrafting a procurement law with a projected time horizon of 2 years its enactment, as it needs to \ngo through a review and consultation process followed by submission to parliament. \n\nIn  the  meantime,  LKPP  has  consolidated  the  different  amendments  of  Keppres \n\n32. \nNo. 80/2003 into one document, which it plans to simplify for users. \n\nStandard  Bidding  Documents.  No  national  standard  bidding  documents  are  used \n33. \nregularly by all government agencies in Indonesia. Some implementing agencies (such as the \nMinistry  of  Public  Works)  have  developed  standard  bidding  documents  for  their  own  use.  The \nLKPP,  through  the  support  of  ADB,  has  drafted  eight  national  model  standard  bidding \ndocuments.  These  include  (i)  an  explanatory  guide,  (ii)  goods  with  prequalification,  (iii)  goods \nwith post-qualification, (iv) works with prequalification, (v) works with post-qualification, (vi) other \nservices  with  prequalification,  (vii)  other  services  with  post-qualification,  and  (viii)  consulting \nservices. These are available in a draft form but their use is not mandatory and they are being \nused on a pilot basis. It is important for LKPP to collect users\u2019 comments on these documents, \nimprove them, and mandate their use on a national basis. One of the improvements would be to \nharmonize such documents with those of international development partners such as the World \nBank, ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment. \n\n34. \nPublic  Procurement  Function.  There  has  been  growing  concern,  from  both  the \nGovernment  and  ADB,  over  the  pace  of  project  implementation.  Significant  delays  and  slow \ndisbursement  seem  to  occur  across  the  entire  PFM  cycle.  Government  agencies  reported \nin  budget  preparation  and  approval,  budget  execution,  and \ndelays  and  difficulties \nthe \nimplementation/ \n\nprocurement. \n\nSpecifically, \n\nconcerns \n\nthere \n\nwith \n\nare \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 8 \n\n        \n\n69\n\nCorruption,  Sanctions,  and \n\nimplementation/procurement  capacity  of  government  staff  and  the  absence  of  incentives  for \nproject  managers/procurement  committees.  In  addition,  fear  of  prosecution  by  auditors  and \nanticorruption agencies has affected projects because of the reluctance of officials to take action \namid  growing  worries  of  being  prosecuted  under  anticorruption  legislation,  even  over  minor \nmistakes.  LKPP  is  considering  assessing  the  introduction  of  central  procurement  units  in \nministries and at local government level.  \n \n35. \nCapacity  Building.  Keppres  No.  80/2003  required  the  Government  to  adopt  an \nfor  procurement  practitioners  within  government \nexamination  system  and  certification \ncontracting  entities  to  ensure  that  their  level  of  competence  is  consistent  with  their  level  of \nresponsibilities. So far, the rate of staff passing the basic procurement certification is very low \n(less than 20%), which increases the need for a strategic approach to capacity building. LKPP is \ndeveloping  a  strategy  for  human  resources,  training,  and  certification  on  public  procurement. \nThis will entail development of training courses and criteria for tertiary institutions.  \n \nIndependent  Appeals  Mechanism.  Despite \n36. \nimprovements  in  the  public  procurement  system,  concerns  remain  over  corrupt  and  collusive \npractices.  While  addressing  this  requires  an  overall  governance  strategy,  several  important \nelements  in  the  procurement  system  can  support  such  a  strategy,  e.g.,  an  independent \ncomplaints  mechanism,  an  effective  sanctions  mechanism,  and  improving  transparency  in  the \nprocurement process through the use of e-procurement.  \n \n37. \nKeppres  No.  80/2003  requires  the  establishment  of  a  complaints  handling  mechanism. \nHowever,  this  is  not  set  up  independently  but  within  each  implementing  agency.  LKPP  is \ndeveloping  a  strategy  to  approach  complaints  handling.  While  it  is  imperative  to  develop \nprocedures for an independent complaints handling mechanism, LKPP should avoid becoming \nthe agency to which these complaints are addressed but rather develop a system and monitor \nits efficiency and reliability.  \n \n38. \ne-Procurement.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Ministry  of  Communications  and \nInformation,  and  City  of  Surabaya  have  been  at  the  forefront  in  the  development  of  e-\ngovernment  procurement  technology.  The  LKPP  was  also  taking  the  lead  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment  for  implementation  of  e-government  procurement  in  Indonesia  at  a  national  and \nsubnational level.  It  is  now  critical  to  develop  a  road  map  for  implementation  of  e-government \nprocurement  in  Indonesia,  setting  the  roles  of  different  stakeholders,  and  the  responsibility  for \nensuring  minimum  interoperability  and  core  data  standards  for  the  various  e-government \nprocurement providers to comply with. \n \nG. \n \n39. \nThe  Government\u2019s  aggregate  annual  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  a \ntimely manner for 4 years (2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007). They present revenues, expenditures \nand transfers, surpluses/deficits, and financing aggregates compared with budget provisions. A \nbalance  sheet  and  a  cash  flow  statement  are  also  presented,  along  with  a  full  statement  of \ngovernment  accounting  policy.  Although  the  timeliness  is  a  significant  achievement,  concerns \nremain over their reliability. BPK has for the last 4 years issued a \u201cdisclaimer\u201d opinion on these \nfinancial statements. Among the reasons cited for this were internal control weaknesses in the \npreparation  of  the  financial  statements  and  instances  of  noncompliance  with  applicable \nregulations.   \n \n\nAccounting and Reporting on Budget Execution \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nThe  government  accounting  standards  are  well  aligned  with  comparable  international \n40. \nstandards. However, technical capacity constraints limit the pace at which these standards can \nbe  implemented  at  all  levels  of  government,  including  line  ministries  and  subnational \ngovernments.  Capacity  constraints  in  the  line  ministries  are  being  addressed  through  staff \ntraining via an ambitious training program that aims to train over 7,000 accounting staff\u2014at least \none staff member per budget spending units (satker)  by the end of FY2009.  \n \n41.  Monthly and quarterly reports on budget realization are produced by each ministry and \nsent to MOF for consolidation. A midyear unaudited report on budget realization is presented to \nthe  DPR  in  July  and  is  available  to  civil  society.  However,  there  are  reconciliation  issues \nbetween the budget realization reports of the Treasury and those of the ministries, departments, \nand  agencies  (MDAs).  These  differences  are  reported  as  a  suspense  item  in  the  budget \nrealization reports, which have been disclosed in the annual financial statements since 2004.   \n \n42. \nThe  Government  issued  Finance  Minister  Regulation  No.  171/PMK.05/2007  on \nAccounting  System  for  Line  Ministries.  The  changes  brought  about  by  the  new  regulation \ninclude an emphasis on \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nline  ministries  being  responsible  for  recording  the  budget  allotment  for  their \nministries; and  \nreceivables,  payables,  and  investment  recording  by  the  line  ministries  which \nshould be recorded and reported in the line ministries\u2019 financial statements.   \n\n \n43. \nBased on the new regulations, line ministries will assume responsibility for their budget \nmonitoring\u2014they do not have to depend on MOF controls only\u2014and the financial statements of \nline ministries will present a more accurate picture of their financial position.   \n\nExternal Audit \n\n44. \nAlthough  commendable  action  has  been  taken  to  improve  government  financial \nreporting,  there  continue  to  be  serious  challenges  in  making  government  financial  statements \nreliable,  as  reported  by  BPK  in  its  annual  audit  report  for  2006.  This  reflects  the  immense \nchallenges that lie ahead in an environment where accounting capacity at the grassroots level is \nweak and accounting processes are not yet integrated or fully automated. \n \nH. \n \n45. \nBPK was established under the constitution and its roles and responsibilities are set out \nin Law No.15/2004. The organizational structure of BPK is outlined in the Decree of Secretary \nGeneral  No.  34/2007  and  No.  39/2007  and  its  governance  arrangements  were  set  out  in  Law \nNo.  15/2006.  BPK  has  a  mandate  to  audit  all  government  entities  including  MDAs  and  state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs). Its independence from the executive branch is reflected in its board \nmembers being appointed by parliament. BPK has recently received a significant increase in its \noperating budget to fund an increase in the number of auditors and administrative staff as well \nas the number of regional offices.6  \n \nAll expenditures, revenues, assets, and liabilities of the Government are subject to audit \n46. \nby BPK. This situation has arisen from the requirements enacted in taxation laws (No. 6/1983 \nand  No.  16/2000)  under  which  only  the  minister  of  finance  can  authorize  access  to  individual \n\n                                                 \n6  The total annual budget for BPK increased from Rp234 billion in 2004 to Rp1.5 trillion in 2008 while the number of \n\nregional offices increased from 7 (2004) to 29 (2008). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 8 \n\n        \n\n71\n\nInternal Controls and Internal Audit \n\ntaxpayer records, on a case-by-case basis. As a result, BPK has been unable to audit taxation \nrevenues, which represent about 70% of central government revenues. \n \n47. \nBPK  performs  financial,  performance,  and  special  purpose  audits.  The  audits  are \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  the  BPK  Auditing  Standards,  which  are  stipulated  in  BPK \nRegulation No. 1/2007 on State Finance Auditing Standards. These standards are generally in \nline with international standards and have been applied since FY2006. The audit report on the \nfinancial  statements  is  submitted  to  the  legislature  within  5  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal \nyear. In the past 4 years, the submission of the audited financial reports to parliament has been \ntimely. BPK also submits interim audit reports to parliament every 6 months on irregularities and \ninefficiencies it has identified at MDAs. \n \nAuditees  generally  submit  formal  responses  on  audit  recommendations  and  their \n48. \nimplementation to BPK. The extent of follow-up is regularly monitored by BPK and reported in \nits interim audit reports. Records maintained at BPK indicate that, on average, 80% of audited \nentities  submit  formal  responses  on  audit  findings  although  this  may  not  reflect  the  relative \nimportance of recommendations.  \n \n49. \nA peer review of BPK was completed in 2004 and this revealed serious weaknesses in \ncapacity.  Since  then,  improvements  have  been  made  gradually,  with  new  hiring  and  training. \nBPK has a follow-up peer review planned for FY2009.   \n \nI. \n \nThe  internal  audit  framework  of  the  Government  is  extensive  but  the  institutional \n50. \nstructure is complex and the mandates and division of labor between the various internal audit \ninstitutions  have  not  been  clear.  Presidential  Regulation  No.  60/2008  on  government  internal \ncontrols issued in August 2008 defines more clearly the roles and responsibilities of the different \nplayers.   \n \n51. \nThe  State  Development  Audit  Agency  (BPKP)  is  now  entrusted  with  the  task  of \ndesigning the guidelines on internal control implementation, providing training and improving the \ncompetence  of  the  Government\u2019s  internal  auditors  on  the  Government\u2019s  internal  controls\u2014\nessentially an advisory role. BPKP is also mandated to audit cross-sectoral activities, respond to \naudit  requests  by  the  President,  and  audit  the  Government\u2019s  treasury  activities  if  assigned  by \nMOF.   \n \n52. \nInspectors  general  are  still  the  main  internal  audit  apparatus  of  the  line  ministries.  In \nprinciple,  inspectors  general  have  a  mandate  to  audit  all  MDAs  activities  and  determine  their \nannual  audit  plan  independently  and  all  units  within  an  MDA  are  required  to  provide  data \nneeded by inspectors general. In practice, most audits by inspectors general check compliance \nwith  technical  and  operational  aspects  of  activities,  including  compliance  with  internal  control \nprocedures.  Evaluations  to  determine  the  adequacy  of  internal  control  systems  are  rarely \ncarried out. A systematic risk-based approach to internal audits is still in its infancy. Since 2006, \ninspectors general also have reviewed their MDA\u2019s annual financial statements to ensure their \naccuracy, reliability, and integrity prior to their submission to DG Treasury in MOF. \n \nThere was no formal commitment control system at satker and MDA level that records, \n53. \nreports, monitors, or controls spending commitments during the year against approved budgets \nand  cash  availability.  However,  Finance  Minister  Regulation  No  171/PMK.05/2007  on \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nAccounting  System  for  Line  Ministries  passes  on  the  responsibility  for  commitment  control  to \nline  ministries.  The  DIPA  documents  prepared  by  MOF,  which  are  detailed  down  to  the \nspending  unit  or  satker  level,  establish  annual  budget  ceilings  on  expenditure  commitments. \nThese DIPAs generally prevent MDAs from placing orders above the approved budgets (DIPA \nlimits) for particular spending items. \n \n54.  MOF  Regulation  No.  134/PMK.06/2005  and  DG  Treasury  Regulation  No.  PER-\n66/PB/2005  prescribe  detailed  procedures  for  payment  of  salary  and  non-salary  expenditures, \nwhich supplement other written procedures on accounting and recording transactions. However, \nthe  processes  are  paper-intensive  and  involve  inefficient  use  of  staff  resources.  For  example, \nthe  supporting  documentation  required  for  payment  of  goods  and  services  covers  multiple \ndocuments that duplicate information, with weak audit trails and accounting evidence.7 \n\n55. \nBPK\u2019s audit report for 2006 records numerous instances of noncompliance with rules for \nprocessing  and  recording  transactions  such  as  noncompliance  with  procurement  procedures, \npayments not supported by adequate documentation, and overpayments.   \n\nthe  accountability  of \n\nReforming Regional Public Financial Management \n\nThe  overall  internal  control  environment  continues  to  be  weak.  However,  recent \ninternal  control  are  positive \nline  ministries  and \n\nIn  relation  to  subnational  accounts,  the  auditing  responsibility  of  is  assigned  to  the \n56. \ninternal  auditor  of  local  governments  (Bawasda).  Lack  of  trained  and  skilled  auditors  and \nmethodology  results  in  Bawasda  being  the  weakest  component  of  the  Government\u2019s  internal \ncontrol framework.  \n \n57. \nregulations  on \ndevelopments.  \n \nJ. \n \n58. \nDecentralization  has  provided  local  governments  with  significant  resources  and \nauthority.  More  than  one-third  of  general  government  expenditures  are  now  executed  by \nsubnational governments. This requires an adequate regulatory framework and PFM capacity at \nthe local level. After decentralization, the central Government passed comprehensive legislation \nfor  PFM  reforms  at  the  regional  level  to  mirror  the  changes  being  made  at  the  center.  The \nregulatory  framework  for  regional  PFM  reforms  is  now  largely  in  place,  including  mechanisms \nfor  fiscal  transfers  to  local  governments.  However,  most  regions  lack  adequate  technical  and \nhuman  resources  to  implement  the  reforms.  Subnational  governments  are  obliged  by  law  to \nreport certain fiscal and financial information to the central Government. Most local governments \nnow  report  the  information  required,  although  with  some  delay.  Accordingly,  it  is  possible  to \nproduce consolidated (though delayed) general government reports. \n\n59. \nAllocations  to  individual  subnational  government  units  are  formally  issued  with  the \npassing  of  the  national  budget  in  October  before  the  financial  year  commences,  but  notional \nallocations are included in the budget presented to the DPR in August. In practice, this leaves \nsufficient  time  for  subnational  government  units  to  finalize  their  budgets  but  submissions  are \noften  late  because  of  local  government  constraints.  However,  budget  allocations  of  shared \nrevenues (nontax revenue) are not issued before March or April in the fiscal year. The central \nGovernment  significantly  underestimates  the  notional  allocations,  and  disbursements  from  the \ncenter  to  the  regions  are  back-loaded  toward  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  Both  practices  are \n\n                                                 \n7  In the Government\u2019s view, the procedures may create some duplication of work. However, this approach is taken to \nmaintain a check and balance mechanism and clarify roles, as mandated by Law No. 1/2004 on State Treasury.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 8 \n\n        \n\n73\n\ndeliberately  chosen  by  the  central  Government  to  ensure  fiscal  discipline,  but  they  constrain \nsuccessful financial management at local level. \n\nState-Owned Enterprises \n\n60. \nBecause  of  over-budgeting  of  expenditure  by  subnational  governments  and  under-\nbudgeting of transfers by the central Government, many subnational governments have built up \nreserves in recent years.  \n \nK. \n \n61. \nIndonesia  has  a  sound legal  framework  for  corporate  governance  and monitoring  SOE \noperations. Firstly, the SOE Law No. 19/2003 sets a clear ownership policy as the state is not \nallowed  to  be  involved  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  SOEs  and  must  allow  them  full \noperational autonomy. Secondly, a 2002 ministerial decree clearly details corporate governance \nresponsibilities,  including  the  need  to  (i)  submit  each  SOE\u2019s  financial  statements  to  the  State \nMinistry  for  State-Owned  Enterprises  and  to  the  appropriate  line  ministry  each  quarter, \n(ii) prepare annual  financial  statements  that  must  be  audited  internally and  by  an  independent \nauditor, and (iii) publish SOE annual reports in a timely manner.  \n\n62. \nExisting  laws  and  regulations  governing  SOEs  are  not  implemented  effectively.  Long \ndelays still occur in auditing and publishing SOE financial statements. SOE annual reports are \nusually only regularly and systematically made public in cases where companies have accessed \nthe  local  capital  markets  with  listed  instruments.  The  Government  has  included  fiscal  risk \nstatements  in  the  budgets  for  FY2008  and  FY2009  and  is working  on improving  the  quality  of \nthe budget process.   \n\n63. \nThe planned use of public-private partnerships to accelerate investment will create fiscal \nrisks  that  merit  disclosure  and  the  Government  has  taken  steps  to  mitigate  those  risks. \nPresidential Regulation No. 67/2005 emphasizes careful project preparation and the selection of \nbidders in an open, competitive tender; and gives the minister of finance the right to approve or \nreject requests for government support. \n \nL. \n\nDebt Management \n\n64. \nDuring  the  previous  DPL/DPSP  series,  two  major  initiatives  in  debt  management  were \nimplemented:  a  clear  debt  management  strategy  that  was  publicly  announced,  and  a  newly \ncreated DG for Public Debt Management that has risk management oversight for both domestic \nand external debts.   \n\n \n\n65. \nBy  2007,  the  Government  had  also  successfully  reduced  its  debt\u2013GDP  ratio  to  about \n35%  from  the  peak  of  over  90%  in  1999.  Despite  the  positive  development  in  terms  of  debt \nsustainability and institutional reforms, the Government\u2019s institutional capacity to manage public \ndebt remains weak. Audit reports confirm that data and reports on domestic debt are reliable but \nindicate that data and reports on foreign debt differ from development partners records and may \nnot be accurate.  \n \nM. \n \n66. \nIndicators  of  corruption  in  Indonesia  are  improving,  albeit  slowly.  Sufficient  and \ndedicated resources have been made available to most of the agencies critical to anticorruption \nefforts. Powerful independent oversight and prosecutorial institutions such as KPK and the Anti-\nCorruption  Court  have  begun  to  deliver  tangible  results.  In  addition,  institutions  like  BPK, \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nFinancial  Transaction  and  Analysis  Centre,  and  Attorney  General\u2019s  Office  have  all  critically \nimproved their anticorruption track record. \n\n67. \nHigh  profile  corruption  investigations  have  been  launched,  leading  to  a  number  of \nsuccessful  prosecutions.  For  example,  as  of  September  2008,  seven  parliamentary  members \nwere under investigation or prosecution as suspects in several corruption cases, most of them \ninvolving  bribery.  Some  of  the  parliamentary  members  were  arrested  when  caught  receiving \nbribes. A senior prosecutor has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for receiving bribes. This \ncase led to the removal of three very senior prosecutors, including two deputies of the attorney \ngeneral.  \n\n68.  While there have clearly been successes and there is strong momentum in investigating \nand  prosecuting  individual  corruption  cases,  there  has  been  less  progress  in  developing  and \nimplementing  a  coherent,  well-focused  strategy  for  corruption  prevention  within  the  state \nadministration.  Ministry  for  State  Apparatus  Reform  (MenPAN)  the  ministry  tasked  with \ncoordinating,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  implementation  of  such  a  strategy,  has  limited \ncapability  in  this  regard.  As  a  result,  implementation  of  the  existing  anticorruption  strategy  for \nthe state administration has been weak.  \n\n69.  While  progress  in  developing  and  implementing  a  coherent,  well-focused  strategy  for \ncorruption  prevention  in  the  state  administration  is  limited,  recent  developments  have  been \npromising. Previously, KPK was in charge of pushing and monitoring bureaucratic reform as a \ncorruption  prevention  measure  within  several  institutions  such  as  MOF,  Supreme  Court,  and \nBPK.  When  this  task  was  handed  over  to  MenPAN  in  2007,  progress  became  very  slow. \nDespite the limited progress by MenPAN, important internal bureaucratic reforms are well under \nway  in  individual  government  agencies  including  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs,  Ministry  of \nTrade, and most recently the Attorney General\u2019s Office. \n \nN. \n \n70. \nclosely monitored: \n\nGoing  forward,  progress  on  the  following  key  ongoing  PFM  reforms  will  need  to  be \n\nKey Areas for Future Attention \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nensuring coherence and momentum in PFM reform;  \ndeepening  the  reforms  of  the  central  government  budgetary  sector,  along  the \nlines discussed in paras. 66\u201369; \nensuring  greater  integrity  and  more  effective  management  of  public  funds \nthrough  continued  implementation  of  a  TSA,  automating  the  treasury  payments \nsystem, and the institution of measures to prevent the proliferation of off-budget \nbank accounts; \nstrengthening  internal  audit  institutions  by  establishing  synergistic  relationships \nbetween them, and removing overlaps; \nimplementation  of  a  new \nimplementation  of \nGovernment  Accounting  Standards,  and  reengineering  of  underlying  business \nprocesses at spending agencies to ensure reliable financial reporting; and \nwidening  the  reforms  throughout  government.  This  means  extending  modern \nfinancial accountability and management processes to subnational governments \nin  a  coordinated  manner  and  bringing  these  fully  in  line  with  emerging  national \nstandards.  \n\ntreasury  system,  extending \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 8 \n\n        \n\n75\n\n71.  Many  of  these  reforms  are  being  actively  considered  and  prioritized,  and  the \nGovernment is developing implementation plans. Implementation is well under way concerning \nthe TSA and the institutional framework for procurement.   \n\nThe capacity to monitor these and other reforms centrally has recently been established \n72. \nat the secretary general\u2019s office of MOF. Indonesia would benefit from a coherent reform plan or \nstrategy to ensure proper phasing and coordination of PFM reforms. This would also allow for \nenhanced  monitoring  and  accountability  within  the  Government,  and  thus  provide  additional \nmomentum and direction to reform efforts. \n \nO. \n\nManagement of Foreign Exchange \n\nThe foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The \n73. \ncountry  is  no  longer  subject  to  the  extended  arrangement  from  the  IMF.  Bank  Indonesia  was \nlast  subject  to  the  transitional  procedures  under  the  Fund\u2019s  safeguards  assessment  policy  in \n2002. That assessment recommended remedial action to address a number of vulnerabilities in \nIndonesia.  The  main  recommendations  have  been \nthe  audit  arrangements  of  Bank \nimplemented, including the establishment of an independent audit committee at Bank Indonesia \nand  the  publication  of  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  audited  financial  statements.  Audited  financial \nstatements of Bank Indonesia for 2007 have been reviewed and the audit report issued by BPK \ncontained an unqualified audit opinion.   \n \nP. \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\nIndonesia has established a sound legal and administrative framework for modern PFM. \n74. \nChanges in the legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the momentum \nhas shifted toward implementation of new PFM practices.  \n \nKnown  weaknesses  in  financial  management  and  accountability  continue  to  be \n75. \naddressed gradually through the PFM reform  program. The development partners are actively \nengaged in this process. Key elements of the reforms are supported by the DPL/DPSP triggers, \nas  well  as  the  GFMRAP  project  and  initiatives  supported  by  development  partners.  However, \nmuch remains to be done, and it will take time to realize the full impact of these reforms.   \n \n76. \nIn the meantime, some fiduciary risks will arise for this operation. Although the pace of \nimplementing the planned reforms has been somewhat slow over the past year, the trajectory of \nreform  is  in  the  right  direction  and  the  current  government  continues  to  demonstrate  a \ncommitment to continue the task of completing the planned reforms in PFM. Taking these into \nconsideration, ADB assessment team does not propose putting in place any additional fiduciary \narrangements for this operation. \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nPUBLIC EXPENDITURE SUPPORT FACILITY PROBLEM TREE \n \n \n \n\nLower economic growth and poverty reduction \n \n\n \n\n \nRisks to social \nsafety nets \n\nRisks to spending \non public \ninvestment and \nservices \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks to \nemployment and \njob creation \n\n \n\n \n\n \nLower fiscal \nrevenues \n\nLower levels of \nprivate \ninvestment \n\nProtracted economic downturn \n\n \nCapital flight \n\n \nIncreased financial \nsector instability \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReduced \navailability of \nfinancing for \nexports \n\n \n\n \n\n \nHigher cost of \ncapital \n\n \n\n \nContagion from \nglobal credit crunch \n\n \n\nSource:  Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n", "ADB \nBAPPEDA \n", "BAPPENAS \n", "BOS \nBPK \nBPKP \n", "BPS \nCMEA \nCMSW \nDG \nDIPA \nDPL \nDPR \nDPSP \nEITI \nFSAP \nGDP \nGFSM \nIMF \nKPK \nLIBOR \nLKPP \nLPS \nMDA \nMDG \nMenPAN \nMOF \nMOT \nNGO \nNPL \nOECD \nOIS \nPESF \nPFM \nPNPM \nRKP \nRPJM \n", "Satker \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 April 2009) \n", "Currency Unit\nRp1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n$10,900.00 \nRp0.000092 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013  Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Daerah  \n", "(Sub-National Development Planning Agency) \n\u2013  Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional \n(National Development and Planning Agency) \n", "\u2013  Operational Aid to Schools Prorgram \n\u2013  Supreme Audit Agency \n\u2013  Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan \n", "(State Development Audit Agency) \n", "International Monetary Fund \n", "\u2013  Central Bureau of Statistics \n\u2013  Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs \n\u2013  Coordinating Ministry for Social Welfare \n\u2013  Director General \n\u2013  Budget Activity Lists \n\u2013  Development Policy Loan \n\u2013  House of Representatives \n\u2013  Development Policy Support Program \n\u2013  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative \nfinancial sector assessment program \n\u2013 \ngross domestic product \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Government Finance Statistics Manual \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Corruption Eradication Commission  \nLondon interbank offered rate \n\u2013 \n\u2013  National Public Procurement Office \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Ministry, Department, and Agency \n\u2013  Millennium Development Goal \n\u2013  Ministry for State Apparatus Reform \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  Ministry of Trade \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Public Expenditure Support Facility \n\u2013  Public Finance Management \n\u2013  National Community Empowerment Program \n\u2013  Government\u2019s annual work plan \n\u2013  Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah \n(Medium-Term National Development Plan) \nbudget spending units \n", "nongovernment organization \nnonperforming loan \n", "Indonesian Deposit Insurance Agency \n", "overnight index swap \n", "\u2013 \n", "SOE \nSusenas \nTSA \nUCT \n", "state-owned enterprise \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013  Survey Sosial-Ekonomi Nasional (National Socioeconomic Survey)  \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "treasury single account \nunconditional cash transfer \n", " \n", " \nNOTES \n", " \n", " \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nFY  before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends, \ne.g., FY2009 ends on 31 December 2009. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n", " \n \n \nVice-President \nDirector General \nCountry Director \nDirector \n", "Team leader \nTeam members \n", "C.
