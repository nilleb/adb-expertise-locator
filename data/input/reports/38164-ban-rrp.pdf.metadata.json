Initial environmental examinations for \nthe  project  have  been  completed  and  will  be  updated  in  line  with  the \nsummary initial environmental examination in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nThe  project  has  four  components:  (i)  the  construction  of  61  kilometers \n(km)  of  gas  transmission  pipeline  for  transporting  400  million  cubic  feet \nper day (MMCFD), including interface metering and regulating stations at \nselected  locations  and  the  installation  of  compressors  at  Ashuganj  and \nElenga; (ii) safety and supply efficiency improvement in Titas gas field to \nincrease gas production by 120 MMCFD; (iii) the construction of a 845 km \ngas distribution network in the southwest to improve energy access; and \n(iv) support for supply and demand management. \n \nNatural  gas  contributes  70%  of  primary  energy  supply  in  Bangladesh.  It \nhas dominated the power sector, fueling 85% of power generation. As the \ncountry is highly dependent on natural gas for its economic development, \nthe sustainability of gas supplies is critical.  \n\nGovernment  policy  in  the  gas  sector  since  1993  has  been  to  attract \nprivate  investments  to  upstream  gas  field  development  while  improving \nthe  network  coverage  and  operational  efficiency  of  companies  that \nproduce  and  distribute  natural  gas.  Bangladesh  managed  to  attract \nsignificant  investments  from  the  private  sector  for  gas  exploration  and \nincreased  gas  production  by  over  100%  since  1998.  The  share  of  gas \nproduction  by  international  oil  companies  (IOCs)  grew  to  almost  50%  of \nthe total supply in 2008.  \n\nExponentially increasing demand for gas has introduced a supply deficit. \nTo  address  the  demand\u2013supply  gap,  national  oil  companies  and  IOCs \nhave  been  investing  in  existing  fields  and  new  discoveries  to  increase \nproduction.  By  2017,  these  interventions  and  the  recently  concluded  3rd \nround of bidding will increase the gas supply by 74% compared to supply \nin 2008. The government is currently examining several options to further \nimprove  supply:  (i)  additional  investment  in  existing  fields,  (ii) initiating \nanother  round  of  bidding  for  exploration;  and  (iii)  importing  liquefied \nnatural gas as a medium- to long-term measure. \n\nThe  transmission  and  distribution  network  is  inadequate  to  meet  the \nneeds of industry, commerce, and households. The capacity of the state \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nOutputs \n\ninternational \ngas  companies \nfinancing.  Therefore  gas  transmission  and  distribution  continue  to  need \npublic financing.  \n\ninsufficiently  developed \n\nto  access \n\nis \n\nin \n\nthe  state-owned  gas  companies  and \n\nOperational  performance  in  the  gas  sector  has  been  affected  by \ninadequate  investment  in  all  subsectors,  compounded  by  uneconomic \ntariffs,  inadequate  investment  resources,  inefficient  use  of  gas,  and \ninadequate  capacity \nthe \ngovernment.  The  government's  gas  sector  reform  road  map  (GSRR)  is \ndesigned  to  address  many  of  these  issues.  The  GSRR  and  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  policy  dialogue  with  the  government  includes \ntime-bound  actions  to  improve  the  policy  and  regulatory  environment, \nsector  planning,  and  corporate  governance,  as  well  as  to  implement \nstructural and pricing reforms. Some of the key actions, such as approving \nthe  GSRR,  operationalizing \nthe  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission  (BERC),  licensing  gas  companies,  and  cabinet  approval  for \nthe  proposed  gas  act,  are  already  accomplished.  The  government  is \ncommitted  to  continuing  the  implementation  of  other  measures  identified \nin the GSRR. \n\nThe  proposed  physical  investments  are  the  most  urgent  components  of \nthe gas sector\u2019s priority investment program. The gas sector master plan \nprovides  the  basis  for  investment  planning  by  the  Bangladesh  Oil,  Gas, \nand  Mineral  Corporation  (Petrobangla)  and  its  affiliates.  The  need  to \nprovide gas to Chittagong from fields in the northeast and the constraints \non the national supply of gas have focused investment priorities on these \nareas.  Removing  bottlenecks  in  the  transmission  system  has  become \ncritical to ensuring the efficient delivery of higher gas volumes. Safety and \nsupply efficiency improvement at the Titas gas field is necessary to avoid \na major accident and sustain the current level of production from the field \nin  the  long  term.  With  the  extension  of  the  natural  gas  transmission \npipeline  to  the  Khulna  Division  under  the  Gas  Transmission  and \nDevelopment  Project  (GTDP),  improving  the  distribution  network  in  the \nsouthwest  is  essential  to  making  gas  available  to  consumers  in  that \nregion.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  and  more  reliable  access  to \nnatural  gas  for  sustained  economic  growth,  achieved  by  reinforcing  and \naugmenting  natural  gas  supply  and  addressing  policy  and  institutional \nconstraints.  \n \nThe main outcome of the project will be expanded capacity and improved \nefficiency \ntransmission,  and  distribution \nsystems.  \n \nPart A: Transmission capacity expansion  \n\nin  natural  gas  production, \n\n(i)  Part  A-1:  Ashuganj\u2013Bakhrabad  gas  transmission  loop-line.  The \nsubcomponent will construct a 30 inch, 61 km pipeline from Ashuganj \nto Bakhrabad and install interface metering and regulating stations at \nthe  selected  locations  of  Monohordi,  Dewanbag,  Kutumbupur,  Feni, \nand Barabkundu. \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n(ii)  Part  A-2:  Installation  of  compressors  at  Ashuganj  and  Elenga. \nUnder this subcomponent, a compressor will be installed at Ashuganj \nwith  a  throughput  of  1,500  MMCFD  and  another  at  Elenga  with  a \nthroughput of 500 MMCFD. \n\nPart B: Safety and supply efficiency improvement in Titas gas field. \nThis component will service problematic wells in Titas gas field to improve \nsafety  and  supply  efficiency  and  add  four  appraisal-cum-development \nwells and processing plants to increase production by 120 MMCFD.  \n\nPart  C:  Access  improvement  in  the  southwestern  region.  The \ncomponent will construct a 2-inch to 20-inch, 845 km distribution pipeline \nin  the  southwest,  covering  the  districts  of  Kushtia,  Jhenidah,  Jessore, \nKhulna, and Bagerhat (including Mongla). \n\nPart  D:  Supply  and  demand  management. This component will pilot a \nremote  sensing  metering  system  for  industrial  consumers  and  a  prepaid \nmetering  system  for  domestic  consumers  within  the  gas  distribution \nfranchise  area  of  Titas  Gas  Transmission  and  Distribution  Company \nLimited  (TGTDCL).  This  component  will  also  develop  an  investment \nprogram for improving the efficiency of gas use. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $542  million  equivalent,  including  taxes \nand duties of $101 million.  \n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  $261  million  equivalent  from  ordinary  capital \nresources  (OCR)  and  $5  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian  Development \nFund  (ADF).  Korea  Eximbank  will  provide  $45  million  equivalent  for  part \nA-1. The government will provide $231 million equivalent through loan and \nequity contributions. \n \n(i)  A loan of $261 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (the OCR \nloan) will finance parts A-2, B, and C and will have a term of 25 years \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, and a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum.  \n\n(ii)  A second loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR 3,249,000 from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (the ADF loan) will finance part D and \nwill have a repayment period of 32 years including a grace period of 8 \nyears,  an  interest  charge  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5% \nthereafter,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and \nproject agreements. \n\n \n \nThe  government  will  make  the  loan  proceeds  available  to  the  executing \nagencies  and  cause  the  proceeds  to  be  applied  to  financing  subproject \nexpenditures  through  separate  subsidiary  loan  agreements,  the  terms  of \nwhich must be acceptable to ADB.  \n \nUntil 30 September 2015  \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \n\nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\n \nPeriod of \nUtilization \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting \nAgencies \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n31 March 2015  \n\n \nGas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) will be the executing agency \nfor part A, Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited (BGFCL) for part B, \nSundarban  Gas  Company  Limited  (SGCL)  for  part  C,  and  TGTDCL  for \npart  D.  Petrobangla  will  be  the  executing  agency  coordinating  project \nimplementation. \n \nThe  direct  supervision  and  monitoring  of  project  implementation  and \noperational  performance  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  executing \nagencies. Petrobangla will establish a project coordination unit. \n \nThe  procurement  of  goods  and  services  to  be  financed  under  the  loans \nwill  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  except  those  for  part  A-1,  to  be \nfunded by Korea Eximbank. International competitive bidding procedures \nwill  be  used  for  all  procurement  funded  under  the  ADB  loans.  Ancillary \nfacilities,  including  building  and  service  areas  under  domestic  financing, \nwill follow government procedures. \n \nADB  management  has  approved  advance  contracting  for  procuring \nequipment and civil works and recruiting consultants, subject to eligibility \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).    ADB \nmanagement  has  also  approved  retroactive  financing  for  consulting \nservices  for  implementing  part  B  prior  to  the  signing  of  the  loan \nagreement,  with  a  ceiling  of  $500,000.  The  borrower  and  the  executing \nagencies  have  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  or \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \nInternational consultants associated with national consultants will support \nthe GTCL for part A, BGFCL for part B, SGCL for part C, and TGTDCL for \npart  D \nincluding  design,  engineering, \nprocurement,  construction,  human  resource  development,  and  energy \nefficiency  improvement.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use  of Consultants  using the quality-  and \ncost-based selection method. Consultants will be engaged as a firm. \n \nThe  government\u2019s  ongoing  reform  program  based  on  the  GSRR  will \nstrengthen the financial position of sector entities, enhance public\u2013private \npartnership,  and  improve  sector  and  corporate  governance.  The  project \nwill create efficient and viable gas infrastructure to address priority supply \nand network constraints. These interventions will ensure sustained growth \nin the gas sector, which is critical to the country's economic development. \n\nimplementation  activities, \n\nin \n\nAn estimated 200,000 households will gain access to gas through the new \ndistribution  network.  The  project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \nenvironment and health, particularly of women and the poor, who are the \nmost  vulnerable  to  indoor  air  pollution  from  the  use  of  biomass  and \nfuelwood,  which  will  be  replaced  with  natural  gas.  An  additional  1,400 \n\n\f \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\nv\n\nindustrial and commercial establishments and 35 compressed natural gas \nfilling stations will have access to gas in the southwest. Industries such as \njute  mills,  textile  weaving  factories,  small  cottage  industries,  and  textile \nmills,  and  commercial  entities  such  as  restaurants  and  bakeries,  will \nbenefit, generating significant employment in the region and thus reducing \npoverty.  The  project  will  directly  create  3,000  person-months  of  job \nopportunities during implementation. \n\nThe  subcomponents  are  financially  sound  and  economically  viable,  with \nfinancial internal rates of return ranging from  5.5% to 9.5%, greater than \nthe weighted average cost of capital of 2.7%. The economic internal rate \nof  return  for  the  integrated  project  is  32%.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates \nthat the project remains viable under adverse conditions.  \n \nPolicy  reforms.  The  main  policy  risk  is  failure  or  delay  in  introducing \nrequired reforms and restructuring under the GSRR. Measures have been \nincluded in the project as assurances. ADB will maintain a regular policy \ndialogue with the government on these issues. \n\nCofinancing. Korea Eximbank cofinancing is expected for part A-1 of the \nproject under parallel financing. In the unlikely event that Korea Eximbank \nfinancing  is  not  forthcoming,  part  A-1  will  be  excluded  from  the  project \nscope.  This  would  not  affect  the  viability  or  implementation  of  the \nremaining components, as each is independent. \n\nProject  readiness.  Delays  in  implementing  previous  ADB-financed \nprojects  in  the  gas  sector,  frequently  caused  by  the  executing  agencies\u2019 \ninadequate  project  readiness,  is  an  area  of  concern,  including  delays  in \ngovernment approvals for project component proposals, slow progress in \nland  acquisition,  and  cumbersome  procurement  procedures.  Taking  into \naccount  these  lessons  and  to  mitigate  this  risk,  the  government  and  the \nexecuting  agencies  have  undertaken  various  advance  actions.  These \ninclude the approval of the development project pro formas, preparation of \nrequirements,  and  preparation  of \nenvironmental  and \nprocurement  documents.  Measures  have  been  incorporated  in  project \ndesign  to  reduce  delays  by  allowing  advance  procurement,  retroactive \nfinancing, and advisory support for implementation.  \n\nresettlement \n\nGood  governance.  The  project  design  includes  various  measures  to \npromote  good  governance  and  mitigate  the  risk  of  corruption  by \nenhancing  transparency  and  accountability  in  doing  business.  These \ninclude  disclosing  project  and  procurement-related  information  on  a \nproject website and preparing bid specifications and packaging to ensure \nmaximum  competition  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Any \nprocurement  issues  can  be  immediately  addressed  through  the  recently \nstrengthened  procurement  oversight  and  on-site  advice  available  at  the \nresident mission, minimizing delays and opportunities for corruption. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Natural  Gas  Access  Improvement  Project. 1  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nGovernment policy in the gas sector since 1993 has been to attract private investments to \nupstream gas field development while improving the network coverage and operational efficiency \nof  national  gas  companies.  Bangladesh  managed  to  attract  significant  investments  from  the \nprivate  sector  for  gas  exploration  and  increase  gas  production  by  over  100%  since  1998. \nHowever,  the  rapid  increase  in  demand  for  gas  for  power  generation  and  residential,  industrial, \nand commercial use has recently brought gas supply shortages.  \n \n3. \nThe  operational  performance  in  the  sector  is  affected  by  inadequate  investment  in  all \nsubsectors.  Uneconomic  tariffs,  the  lack  of  adequate  investment  resources,  inefficient  gas  use, \nand  inadequate  capacity  in  state-owned  gas  companies  (SGCs)  and  the  government  have \nacerbated  this  situation.  The  updated  gas  sector  reforms  road  map  (GSRR)  is  designed  to \naddress these issues. The GSRR and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy dialogue include \ntime-bound  actions  to  improve  the  policy  and  regulatory  environment,  sector  planning,  and \ncorporate governance, as well as to implement structural and pricing reforms. Key actions, such \nas  approving  the  GSRR,  operationalizing  the  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission \n(BERC),  licensing  gas  companies,  and  cabinet  approval  for  the  proposed  gas  act,  have  been \ncompleted.  The  government  continues  to  implement  other  measures  in  the  GSRR.  A  sector \nassessment and the GSRR are in Appendix 2. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nNatural Gas Supply\u2013Demand Balance \n\n4. \nBangladesh has 12.5 trillion cubic feet of discovered gas reserves remaining and 32 trillion \ncubic  feet  of  potential  reserves  to  be  confirmed  through  exploration.  Until  the  1990s,  gas \nproduction  capacity  exceeded  demand.  Since  then,  domestic  demand  for  gas  has  increased \nexponentially,  with  higher  demand  from  industry  and  power  generators.  International  oil \ncompanies  (IOCs)  have  significantly  helped  increase  gas  production  to  match  rising  demand. \nTheir share of gas production grew to reach almost 50% of the total supply in 2008. \n\nCurrent  daily  average  gas  demand  of  1,890  million  cubic  feet  per  day  (MMCFD)  is \n5. \nexpected  to  increase  to  3,559  MMCFD  by  2017.  Recent  investments  by  national  oil  companies \nand IOCs will increase gas production by 49%, to 3,055 MMCFD, by 2017. The government has \nfinalized  contracts  following  a  3rd  round  of  bidding  that  will  bring  additional  production, \ncontributing  to  the  overall  increase  in  supply  by  74%  and  bringing  it  to  3,555  MMCFD  by  2017. \nThe government is examining other options to further improve gas supply: (i) additional investment \nin existing fields, (ii) initiating another round of bidding for exploration, and (iii) importing liquefied \nnatural gas. The GSRR has emphasized improving efficiency and mobilizing private resources to \nsupport production, and supply.  \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2007.

Manila.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nGas Sector Regulation and Pricing \n\n6. \nAs  the  regulator  of  the upstream  gas  sector,  the  government  sets  the  wellhead  gas  tariff \nfor  SGCs,  which  is  substantially  below  world  market  prices  and  the  prices  of  alternative  fuels. \nThese  prices  do  not  provide  sufficient  revenue  to  support  further  gas  exploration  by  the  state-\nowned companies. The price of gas from IOCs is linked to world market prices. Blended gas from \nSGCs  and  IOCs,  with  an  average  wellhead  price  of  about  one-tenth  of  the  world  market  price, \nprovides the basis for downstream gas prices. \n \n7. \nThe  BERC  recently  started  regulating  the  downstream  gas  sector,  and  most  gas \ncompanies have obtained operating licenses from it. In its recent first tariff order, BERC could not \naddress  the  issue  of  unsustainably  low  gas  prices,  as  the  wellhead  price  was  not  within  its \nregulatory  purview.  Its  tariff  order  for  the  integrated  sector  does  not  reflect  the  cost  of  network \noperations. The policy of making gas available to users at a minimal price has caused inefficient \ngas use and underinvestment in gas infrastructure. The GSRR and ADB policy dialogue with the \ngovernment  include  actions  to  ensure  efficient  gas  sector  regulation,  regarding  pricing  in \nparticular.  The  government  is  expected  to  fully  operationalize  the  BERC  with  a  complete  legal \nframework through the gas act and government pricing policy guidelines. \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\n8. \nPriority  elements  of  the  government\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  include  (i)  ensuring  good \ngovernance  through  the  autonomy  of  sector  entities,  including  private  sector  participation; \n(ii) designing and implementing a competitive and equitable pricing policy; (iii) strengthening and \nimproving commercial operations; (iv) enacting laws to strengthen the legal framework to enable \neffective  private  sector  participation  and  defining \nrestructuring  program; \n(v) implementing  an  action  program  to  improve  the  financial  performance  of  gas  sector  entities; \nand  (vi)  strengthening  institutional  capability  in  policy  making  and  monitoring.  The  gas  sector \nmaster plan for 2005\u20132025 envisages investments of $2.5 billion in exploration, field development, \ntransmission,  and  distribution.  An  investment  of  $363  million  is  envisaged  in  oil  and  gas \nexploration, $179 million in appraisal and field development, and $46 million in renovating wells to \nsustain production. Nearly 522 kilometers (km) of gas transmission pipeline will require about $1.8 \nbillion, and 1,300 km of distribution pipeline will require $150 million. \n\nthe  sector \n\n4. \n\nLessons  \n\nThe evaluation of energy sector assistance programs in Bangladesh outlined several key \n9. \nlessons typical to the gas sector.2 These lessons include the need to (i) minimize delays in project \nimplementation;  (ii) improve  local  capacity  in  project  preparation,  implementation,  and  operation, \nas well as the selection of appropriate technology; (iii) improve ownership of technical assistance \nprojects;  and  (iv)  improve  project  and  financial  management  capacity  in  project  implementing \nagencies.  Gas  Transmission  and  Development  Project  (GTDP)  experienced  delays  from \nprocurement  difficulties,  involving  cost  overruns  and  institutional  weaknesses  in  introducing  and \nimplementing  new  technologies,  which  required  careful  drafting  of  technical  specifications. \nUnsustainable gas pricing was highlighted as a main cause of the inefficient allocation and use of \ngas.3 \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2003.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n   3 \n \n \n\nTo  mitigate  these  risks,  executing  agencies  have  undertaken  various  actions.  These \n10. \ninclude  advance  approval  of  development  project  pro  formas  (DPPs)  and  the  preparation  of \nprocurement  documentation.  Measures  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  to  reduce  delays \nthrough advance procurement and consultancy support for implementation. Substantial technical \ncapacity  building  in  executing  agencies  has  been  incorporated.  Cost  estimates  have  been \ncarefully prepared, and an adequate contingency budget has been provided, taking into account \npast  experience  to  avoid  cost  overruns.  External  expertise  has  been  brought  into  drafting  the \ntechnical specifications for  the  new  technologies,  and  they  have  been  revisited  based  on  recent \nexperience.  An  independent  assessment  of  the  specifications  has  been  carried  out.  Several \nmeasures have been included in the project to address the gas pricing issue.  \n\n5. \n\nADB Sector Strategy \n\n(i) \n\nfor \n\nADB  strategy \n\nfor  developing \n\nthe  gas  sector  covers  support \n\n11. \nimproved \ncommercialization,  including  private  sector  participation,  by  deepening  sector  reforms  and \nunbundling  sector  activities;  (ii)  increased  access  to  natural  gas  at  affordable  prices  across  the \ncountry;  and  (iii)  policy  and  institutional  measures  aimed  at  improving  energy  efficiency  in \ndistribution  and  promoting  natural  gas  for  transport.  ADB\u2019s  continued  support  for  the  gas  sector \nunder  public  sector  financing  is  considered  crucial  to  (i)  maintaining  the  policy  dialogue  on \nstrengthening corporate governance, pricing reforms, and private sector participation; (ii) helping \nto  expand  the  supply  of  natural  gas  to  meet  energy  demand  in  less-developed  areas  while \nimproving  the  efficiency  and  safety  of  gas  production,  transmission,  and  distribution  companies \nthat  cannot  access  international  financing;  (iii)  promoting  good  practices  on  environmental  and \nsocial safeguards; and (iv) capacity building in the SGCs to improve their long-term planning and \nensure timely project implementation. \n  \n\n6. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nThe policy dialogue during the preparation of the project led the government to adopt the \n12. \nGSRR, which sets out the plan for advancing the policy framework, regulatory instruments, sector \nplanning,  access  to  natural  gas,  corporate  governance,  gas  sector  restructuring,  and  private \nsector participation. The government has progressed on these reform actions. The GSRR and its \nimplementation  status  are  described  in  Appendix  2.  The  following  paragraphs  describe  the  key \nelements of the GSRR and the continuing policy dialogue. \n\n13. \nNational  action  plan  for  gas  sector  reform.  Under  the  GSRR,  a  time-bound  sector \nreform action plan, the government will (i) strengthen the policy formulation and monitoring system \nat  the  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources  Division  (EMRD);  (ii)  adopt  and  implement  the  gas  sector \nmaster plan for exploration, development, transmission, and distribution, including expanding the \nnetwork  to  less-developed  regions;  (iii) create  a  framework  for  monitoring  and  updating;  (iv) \nfinancial \nexecute  a  capacity-development  program \nmanagement, and system management in gas sector entities; and (v) make the hydrocarbon unit \na permanent part of the EMRD to provide technical advice. \n\nfocusing  on  corporate  governance, \n\nLegal and regulatory framework. A number of issues needed to be addressed to ensure \n14. \nsustained  gas  sector  growth.  These  include  (i)  the  EMRD  approving  upstream  gas  pricing \nguidelines,  (ii)  determining  gas  prices  pursuant  to  these  guidelines,  and  (iii)  legally  enforcing \nBERC tariff regulations for downstream activities. The BERC has started regulating the gas sector \nby licensing SGCs and issuing tariff orders. The gas act, which would ensure better regulation of \ngas infrastructure, was approved by the cabinet and is awaiting parliamentary approval.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nLoss  reduction. The overall gas system loss ranged from 4.5% to 6.5% from fiscal year \n15. \n(FY) 2000 to FY2005. This situation has improved in recent years, with average losses falling to \n1.3%  and  that  of  non-bulk  supply  to  2.8%.  A  comprehensive  plan  for  improving  efficiency  and \nreducing system  losses  in  the  entire  gas sector  has  been adopted  for implementation  under  the \nGTDP. Further, the enactment of the proposed gas act under the GSRR will empower distribution \ncompanies to take legal action against fraud, theft, malpractice, and delinquent customers.  \n\n16.  Market-oriented  gas  pricing.  There  is  a  need  to  set  gas  tariffs  in  consideration  of  the \nremaining gas reserves, cost of network services, and need for significant investment in the gas \nsector.  The  adoption  of  the  new  pricing  framework  incorporating  these  principles  will  improve \nsector  entities\u2019  ability  to  cover  their  operating  expenses,  debt-servicing  liabilities,  and  future \ninvestment requirements. The EMRD will issue pricing policy guidelines to address these pricing \nissues.  ADB  is  assisting  the  government  in  conducting  a  comprehensive  gas  pricing  study  to \nrefine these policy guidelines. \n  \n17. \nPrivate  sector  participation.  Future  exploration  and  gas  production  will  be  undertaken \npredominantly  by  the  private  sector  through  production-sharing  contracts.  Private  sector \nparticipation  will  be  encouraged  in  the  construction  of  distribution  pipelines  and  associated \nfacilities  on  a  build\u2013own\u2013operate\u2013transfer  basis.  IOCs  will  be  encouraged  to  invest  in  gas \ntransmission facilities. A public\u2013private partnership model will be demonstrated in the installation \nand operation of Muchai gas compression station by an IOC to strengthen the gas transmission \nsystem. The government will approve a policy framework on private sector participation in existing \ngas distribution companies by December 2010. The newly formed distribution company, Sudarban \nGas Company Limited (SGCL), will sign contracts with private entities for operation, maintenance, \nmetering,  and  billing  from  the  start  of  its  operations.  Possible  models  for  private  sector \nparticipation in distribution are in Supplementary Appendix L. \n\n7. \n\nDevelopment Coordination \n\n18. \nAssistance  from  major  development  partners  is  coordinated  by  the  Economic  Relations \nDivision  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  with  the  support  of  the  EMRD.  Coordination  among  the \ndevelopment  partners  is  carried  out  through  the  local  coordination  group  consisting  of  focused \nsubcommittees for core areas of assistance. As the leading development partner in energy, ADB \nchairs the energy subcommittee and holds regular meetings with all development partners. These \nefforts have greatly advanced sector reforms, improving the regulatory environment in particular. \nEnergy subcommittee meetings were held during fact-finding and appraisal missions to enlighten \ndevelopment  partners  on  progress.  The  energy  subcommittee  expressed  its  support  for  the \nproject.  During  bilateral  meetings,  the  World  Bank,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \n(JICA), and the Export\u2013Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) expressed their support. \n  \nThe  other  main  development  partners  in  the  energy  sector  are  JICA,  KfW,  the  United \n19. \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development,  and  the  World  Bank.  In  the  gas  sector,  ADB  has \nprovided  public  sector  loans  of  $675  million  and  technical  assistance  grants  of  $5.4 million \ncovering  gas  exploration,  production,  transmission,  distribution,  and  energy  efficiency.  Further \ndetails are in Appendix 3. \n\n8. \n\nRationale for the Project \n\nThe government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy emphasizes implementing policies to expand \n20. \nthe  natural  gas  network  to  cover  less-developed  areas.  The  strategy  will  accelerate  balanced \nregional  development  that  will  help  reduce  widespread  poverty.  The  project  aims  to  expand \n\n\f \n\n \n\n   5 \n \n \n\naccess  to  this  main  indigenous  energy  source  in  Bangladesh  to  meet  increased  demand  for \nprimary commercial energy. \n\n21. \nEarly in 2009, the government approved the GSRR, which is now under implementation. It \nincludes  strategies  and  actions  to  improve  the  policy,  regulatory,  and  operational  environment \ntoward ensuring the sustainability of the gas sector. The effective implementation of the GSRR is \ncritical to creating an environment conducive to better commercial orientation in the SGCs and to \nstronger private sector participation downstream in the gas sector. Further, as the capacity of the \nSGCs  is  not  adequately  developed  to  access  international  financing  to  meet  their  investment \nneeds,  they  need  public  financing.  Under  these  conditions,  fully  implementing  the  GSRR  relies \nheavily  on  continued  ADB  support,  particularly  for  increasing  supply  efficiency  and  removing \ntransmission bottlenecks.  \n\n22. \nThe reinforcement of the transmission system with the compressors at Muchai, Ashuganj, \nand  Elenga  is  essential  to  ensuring  reliability  and  efficiency  in  gas  delivery.  Financing  these \ncompressors was originally included in the scope of the ongoing GTDP. The cancellation of two \nbidding  rounds  delayed  procurement.  Finally,  the  delayed  procurement  could  not  be  completed \nbecause funds under the GTDP were inadequate as costs escalated significantly above the cost \nestimates,  owing  to  sharp  increases  in  commodity  prices.  As  the  four  components  in  the  GTDP \nare independent, they are technically and economically viable as separate components. Therefore \nthe  absence  of  the  compressor component  does  not  affect  the  technical  or  economic  viability  of \nthe remaining GTDP components.  \n\n23. \nBecause  of  the  urgency  and  critical  requirement  of  the  compressors  in  transmission \noperation, the government offered the installation of a compressor at Muchai to the private sector \nand  requested  ADB  to  fund  compressors  at  Ashuganj  and  Elanga.  Network,  economic,  and \nfinancial analyses confirmed the need for these compressors to strengthen transmission and their \nviability within the project. The cost estimates, technical specifications, and contract packaging of \nthe  compressors  have been  carefully  reviewed  in light  of  recent  experience  to  ensure  maximum \ncompetition  and  rectify  technical  and  procurement  issues  that  arose  under  the  GTDP.  Recent \nstrengthening  of  procurement  oversight  at  the  ADB  resident  mission  has  improved  the \nissues  and  quarterly \nprocurement  environment \nimplementation  of \nprocurement  workshops \ncomprehensive executing agency training on wise procurement is planned. \n\nthrough  on-site  advice  on  procurement \nfor  executing  agencies.  The  design  and \n\n24. \nThe  proposed  physical  investments  are  the  most  urgent  components  of  the  gas  sector \ninvestment  program.  The  subcomponents  have  been  selected  considering  their  financial  and \neconomic  viability  and  their  social,  environmental,  and  poverty  reduction  impacts.  They  will \ncontribute to poverty reduction by making clean energy available in less-developed areas. \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  and  more  reliable  access  to  natural  gas, \n25. \nproviding  sustained  economic  growth  by  reinforcing  and  augmenting  natural  gas  supply  and \naddressing policy and institutional constraints.  \n \n26. \nnatural gas production, transmission, and distribution systems.  \n\nThe  main  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  expanded  capacity  and  improved  efficiency  in \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  outputs  of \n\n27. \ninvestment  components\u2014in  gas \ntransmission,  safety  and  supply  efficiency  improvement,  and  access improvement\u2014as  well  as  a \nsupply-and-demand management component. The specific activities of the project are as follows:  \n\nthe  project  will  comprise \n\nthree \n\n(i) \n\nPart  A:  Transmission  capacity  expansion.  Two  subcomponents  will  assist  in \ntransmitting gas to consumption centers, including those in less-developed regions.  \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\nloop-line.  The \nPart  A-1:  Ashuganj\u2013Bakhrabad  gas  transmission \nsubproject  will  construct  a  30-inch  gas  loop  pipeline  running  61  km  from \nAshuganj to Bakhrabad, with a throughput of 400 MMCFD, and install major \ntransmission\u2013distribution  interface  metering  and  regulating  stations  at \nselected  locations  such  as  Manohardi,  Dewanbhog,  Kutumbpur,  Feni,  and \nBarabkund.  \n\nPart A-2: Gas compressors at Ashuganj and Elenga. This subproject will \ninstall  a  compressor  at  Ashuganj  with  a  maximum  throughput  of  1,500 \nMMCFD  and  another  at  Elenga  with  a  maximum  throughput  of  500 \nMMCFD. \n\nPart B: Safety and supply efficiency improvement in Titas gas field. The first \nsubproject  (part  B-1)  will  undertake  activities  to  improve  safety  at  existing \nproblematic  wells  in  Titas  field.  The  second  subproject  (part  B-2)  will  improve \nsupply  efficiency  through  four  additional  appraisal-cum-development  wells  and \ninstall processing plants in Titas field to increase gas production by 120 MMCFD.  \n\nPart  C:  Access  improvement  in  southwestern  region.  This  component  will \nconstruct 2-inch to 20-inch gas distribution pipelines of 845 km to provide gas to the \ndistricts of Kushtia, Jhenidah, Jessore, Khulna, and Bagerhat (including Mongla). \n\nPart  D:  Supply  and  demand  management.  This  component  will  establish  gas \nmetering  at  consumer  connections  of  Titas  Gas  Transmission  and  Distribution \nCompany  Limited  (TGTDCL).  Its  scope  will  include  installing  prepaid  meters  for \ndomestic consumers4 and, for industrial consumers, replacing existing meters with \nremote sensing meters on a pilot basis. This component will assist in developing a \nportfolio of projects for improving energy efficiency. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n28. \nAll  the  project  components  include  capacity  building  in  the  form  of  training  and \nimplementation support. Training components entail carrying out an assessment of training needs \nin each executing agency, developing curricula, and conducting training programs. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n29. \nPrivate  sector  participation  in  distribution.  The  SGCL  will  start  its  operations  in  the \nsouthwest by late 2012. The policy framework for private sector participation in distribution and the \nrequired enabling environment will be in place by that time. The SGCL will set up five geographic \nbusiness units and enter into contracts with private entities for operation, maintenance, metering, \nand billing for supply to consumers from December 2012. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   Providing clean energy access to the poor is a key parameter in household selection supported by ADB's Energy for \n\nAll initiative. This pilot project is expected to be scaled up under a subsequent loan. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n   7 \n \n \n\nInterface  metering  and  regulating  stations.  The  installation  of  interface  metering  and \n30. \nregulating  stations  will  allow  monitor  the  efficiency  the  transmission  systems,  assisting  in  loss \nreduction.  The  GTCL  has  established  gas  manifold  stations  but  the  metering  devices  are  not \navailable or are inadequate to cope with the increased demand for gas supply at several manifold \nstations. The project will support the installation of additional meters to address these concerns. \n\n31. \nGeographical focus and poverty reduction. The gas transmission component has three \ndistinct parts: to remove supply bottlenecks in the entire network, to improve gas flow, and to add \nan  extension  pipeline  to  meet  projected  demand  in  major  consumption  centers.  The  gas \ndistribution network will expand access to cleaner fuel in less-developed towns. These efforts will \nincrease  small-  and  medium-scale  industries\u2019  access  to  clean  fuel,  particularly  in  the  less-\ndeveloped southwest, increasing employment there.  \n\n32. \nAir  quality  improvement.  The  project  will  support  the  use  of  natural  gas  in  power \ngeneration,  industries,  and  transport.  Also,  it  will  promote  the  use  of  cleaner  fuel  in  households. \nWider use of natural gas will improve ambient air quality in urban centers and household indoor air \nquality. The benefits from reduced greenhouse gas emissions will be significant.  \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $542 million equivalent, comprising $311 million in foreign \n33. \nexchange  and  $231  million  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  cost  includes  taxes  and  duties  of \n$101  million.  Physical  and  price  contingencies  amount  to  $55  million,  and  financing  charges  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  procedures  amount  to  $41  million.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, \nand other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. The proceeds of the \nOCR loan will be re-lent to the executing agencies under subsidiary loan agreements with terms \nand  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  government  has  provided  ADB  with  the  reasons  for  its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions  and  confirmed  the  choices  were  its  own  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n\n35. \nKorea Eximbank is expected to provide a loan of up to $45 million equivalent on a parallel \nbasis  for  part  A-1  of  the  project.5 The  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Korea  Eximbank  loan  will  be \ncovered  under  a  separate  agreement  between  Korea  Eximbank  and  the  government.  Korea \nEximbank will follow ADB safeguard policies and procedures when implementing this component.  \n\n36. \nThe government has requested another loan in various currencies in special drawing rights \nequivalent to $5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (the ADF loan) to finance part D. It \nwill have a repayment period of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of \n1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and other terms and conditions set forth in the \nloan and project agreements. The ADF loan will be re-lent to executing agencies under subsidiary \nloan agreements with terms and conditions acceptable to ADB.

It is therefore important that primary responsibility for each of \nthe  project  components  remain  with  executing  agencies,  with  Petrobangla  in  a  coordinating  role \nonly. Project implementation arrangements are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n39. \nThe project will be implemented over 5 years, including procurement and construction. It is \nenvisaged that implementation will begin on 01 July 2010 and be completed by 31 March 2015. \nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n40. \nAll procurement financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive bidding \nprocedures will be used for all 11 procurement packages financed by ADB (5 turnkey and 6 supply \ncontracts),  of  which  7  packages  (4  turnkey  and  3  supply  contracts)  will  follow  the  single-stage, \ntwo-envelope  procedure;  3  packages  (3  supply  contracts  for  gas  seepage  control  and  field \nappraisal)  will  follow  the  single-stage,  one-envelope  procedure;  and  the  remaining  turnkey \ncontract  for  procurement  of  gas  turbine  compressor  stations  will  follow  the  two-stage,  two-\nenvelope procedure. The procurement plan is indicated in Appendix 6. \n\n41. \nThe  government,  Petrobangla,  and  the  executing  agencies  have  requested  ADB's \napproval for advance contracting for the procurement of works, goods, and services. Retroactive \nfinancing of up to $500,000 has been requested for consulting services to support the BGFCL in \nits  identification  and  recommendation  of  remedial  actions  regarding  gas  seepage,  drilling  wells, \nand  installing  gas  processing  plants.  ADB  management  has  approved  advance  contracting  for \nprocurement  and  consulting  services,  as  well  as  retroactive  financing  for  consulting  services  for \nthe  BGFCL  of  up  to  $500,000,  provided  that  expenditures  are  in  accordance  with  the  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  safeguard policies  and  are  incurred  during  the  12  months before  the  signing  of  the \nloan agreement. The government, Petrobangla, and the executing agencies have been informed \nthat approval of advance contracting or retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to \nfinance the project. They have also been informed that ADB will not finance expenditures paid by \nthe  borrower  prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  even  if  advance  contracting  is  approved,  unless \nretroactive financing has been approved by ADB. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n42. \nTwo  consulting  services  for  part  A  will  be  required  to  help  the  GTCL  implement  (i)  the \ninstallation  of  interface  metering  and  regulating  stations  and  the  supervisory  control  and  data \nacquisition  system  and  (ii)  the  construction  of  gas  turbine  compressor  stations.  Consulting \nservices  for  parts  B  and  D  will  be  required  to  (i)  support  the  BGFCL  in  identifying  and \nrecommending  remedial  actions  regarding  gas  seepage,  drilling  wells,  and  installing  gas \nprocessing plants and (ii) assist the TGTDCL in project implementation and developing a portfolio \nof  projects  to  improve  energy  efficiency.  Four  consulting  services  for  international  training  are \nenvisaged for capacity development in the GTCL, BGFCL, SGCL, and TGTDCL. Consultants will \nbe engaged as firms. Seven consulting firms will be engaged for parts A-2, B, C, and D, with part \nA-1 financed by Korea Eximbank. \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nAll  consultants  except  those  in  Part  A-1  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n43. \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s \nquality- and cost-based selection procedure, applying the standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. Full \ntechnical proposals will be required from bidders for all consulting services for parts A and B, while \nthe others will use biodata technical proposals (Appendix 6). Details of consulting services are in \nSupplementary Appendix J. \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n\n44. \nThe  government  aims  to  create  a  corruption-free  environment  and  established  the \nAnticorruption  Commission  in  2004.  ADB  has  provided  technical  assistance  to  help  the \ngovernment  build  capacity  and  provide  support  for  an  integrated  anticorruption  strategy.6 ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment  and  executing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant \nregulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB \nin  connection  with  the  project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agencies  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. Table 3 summarizes major \nproject-specific governance measures. \n \n45. \nThe  government  will  ensure  that  the  GTCL,  BGFCL,  SGCL,  TGTDCL,  Petrobangla,  and \nother  gas  sector  entities  have  operational  autonomy  and  that  no  organizational  changes  that \nwould affect their ability to perform their obligations under the project are carried out. \n \n \n\nTable 3: Governance Measures \n\nArea \nProcurement \n\nMeasure \n(i)  Project management units headed by senior officers reporting directly to the managing \n\ndirectors of the executing agencies  \n\nFinancial \nmanagement \nand audit \n\n(ii)  Bid specifications and packaging to be prepared to ensure maximum competition \n\nunder international competitive bidding procedures \n\n(iii)  Information on procurement to be disclosed on a project website \n\n(iv)  Procurement capacity support at the resident mission for expedited action on \n\nprocurement issues \n\n(i)   Measurable financial performance indicators for the executing agencies  \n\n(ii)   Regular monitoring of expenditures, other financial transactions, and safe custody of \nproject-financed assets by the accounting and control systems of the executing \nagencies  \n\n(iii)  Scoped internal audit of the executing agencies ensured to include revenue audit and \n\ninternal audit reports to the audit committee of the executing agency boards \n\n(iv)  Financial statements to be audited by external auditors acceptable to ADB and \n\nregularly published and reported to the shareholders \n\n(v)  Executing agencies to provide an accurate accounting of losses \n\n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2003.

ADB\u2019s commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be utilized. Disbursement \nprocedures will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Statement of expenditure procedures may be used for reimbursement under all \nproject components. The statement of expenditure ceiling will be $100,000 for individual payments \napplicable to reimbursement procedures.  \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n47. \nThe  executing  agencies  receiving  proceeds  from  the  ADB  loans  will  each  maintain  a \nseparate account for the project and submit audited financial statements within at least 6 months \nafter  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  Annual  project  accounts  and  annual  financial  statements  will  be \naudited  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB,  providing  the  auditors\u2019  observations  with \nrespect  to  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  They  will  prepare \nseparate  progress  reports  for  their  respective  components.  Petrobangla  will  consolidate  the \nreports  and submit  to  ADB  quarterly  within  1  month  of  the  end  of  each  quarter. Each  report  will \ndescribe the progress made, any changes to the implementation schedule, problems encountered \nand remedial actions taken, the performance of the consultants, and the work to be carried out in \nthe upcoming period. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB within 3 months of the \ncompletion of the project. The use of statement of expenditure will be part of the annual audit, as \nwill a separate opinion on the use of statement of expenditure. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nA  project  performance  monitoring  system  will  be  established  to  assess  the  progress  and \n48. \nimplementation  of  the  project  and  to  measure  impacts  and  outcomes.  A  set  of  indicators  for \nevaluating  project  performance  in  relation  to  its  goals,  purposes,  outputs,  and  conditions  will  be \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ndeveloped.  The  indicators  will  include  (i)  economic  development  and  poverty  indicators  in  the \nproject  areas,  (ii)  energy  indicators  for  the  region  and  the  project  areas,  (iii)  gas  tariffs,  (iv) the \nfinancial  sustainability  of  the  SGCs,  (v)  access  to  social  services  in  the  project  area,  (vi)  jobs \ncreated  in  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  the  project,  and  (vii)  environmental  and  social \nindicators  including  compliance  with  the  national  labor  laws  and  equal  access  for  women  to \nemployment  opportunities.  At  the  beginning  of  project  implementation,  the  SGCs  will  establish \nbaseline and target values for the indicators. The indicators will be measured at project completion \nand  3  years  later  for  comparison  with  the  baseline.  A  report  summarizing  the  key  findings  of \nmonitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later will be submitted to ADB. \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nThe  project  will  be  supervised  by  ADB  through  at  least  two  review  missions  each  year. \n49. \nADB will monitor the implementation of the project through quarterly progress reports. In addition \nto the normal periodic reviews, ADB and the government will undertake a midterm review 2 years \nafter project implementation begins. The midterm review will include a detailed evaluation of the \nproject  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  consultation  with  affected  people, \nachievement of scheduled targets, progress on policy reforms, and capacity building. \n  \n\nIV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Financial and Economic Justification \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n50. \nThe  financial  management  assessment,  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects  during  project  preparation,  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix \nC.  Petrobangla  is  upgrading  its  human  resource  systems  to  improve  procedures  and  training.7 \nAccounting  and  management  information  systems  are  satisfactory  for  the  Petrobangla  group  of \ncompanies.  Petrobangla  will  provide  accounting  and  billing  systems  and  training  to  the  SGCL. \nWith  the  assistance  of  the  World  Bank,  the  GTCL  is  upgrading  its  accounting  and  management \ninformation  systems  to  improve  management  operations.  Financial  management  assessment \nfound the proposed project financial management arrangements to be satisfactory. \n\n2. \n\nPast Financial Performance and Future Projections \n\nGas  Transmission  Company  Limited.  Mainly  because  of  increases  in  transmission \n51. \nvolume, revenues from gas transmission resulted in an increase in net profit from Tk424 million in \nFY2004  to  Tk2,614  million  in  FY2008.  The  rate  of  return  (ROR)  on  net  fixed  assets  increased \nsteadily over the period to reach 15.1% in FY2008, half again the covenanted ROR of 10.0%, and \nthe debt service ratio (DSR) exceeded 1.2 times. Accounts receivable have exceeded 3 months of \nsales  since  FY2001.  However,  they  do  not  translate  into  bad  debts,  as  the  GTCL  is  paid  by \nPetrobangla once payment is received from distribution companies. \n\nForecasts  of  gas  transferred  by  the  GTCL  are  based  on  Petrobangla\u2019s  August  2008 \n52. \ndemand\u2013supply  projections.  The  financial  projections  assume  that  the  GTCL  wheeling  charge \nincreases  so  that  the  ROR  covenant  of  10%  is  met.  Accordingly  the  wheeling  charge  needs  to \nincrease to Tk0.64 per cubic meter by the beginning of FY2012. This also allows the DSR of 1.2 to \nbe met over the forecast period to FY2020. \n\n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n   13 \n \n \n\nBangladesh  Gas  Fields  Company  Limited.  Revenues  from  gas  production  at  the \n53. \nprescribed production margin have steadily increased, with net profit reaching Tk1,055 million in \nFY2004 and declining to Tk993 million in FY2005 and Tk865 million in FY2006, before recovering \nto Tk999 million in FY2007. It declined to Tk794 million in FY2008 because of higher maintenance \ncosts. The ROR reached 26.7% in FY2005 but declined to 16.7% in FY2008. The DSR is well in \nexcess of 1.2 times debt obligations.  \n\n54. \nForecast gas and condensate volumes are based on Petrobangla\u2019s August 2008 supply\u2013\ndemand  projections.  The  BGFCL  derives  its  revenue  from  the  production  of  gas,  for  which  it \nreceives  a  wellhead  margin  of  Tk0.225  per  cubic  meter,  and  the  sale  of  gas  condensate  and \nrefined  products  based  on  international  petroleum  prices.  On  this  basis,  the  projections \ndemonstrate that a DSR of 1.2 and the historic ROR in excess of 12% will be achieved through \n2020.  \n\n55. \nSundarban Gas Company Limited. SGCL is a new company formed to distribute gas in \nthe Khulna area and towns adjacent to the new transmission pipeline to Khulna. SGCL gas sales \nprojections  for  2012\u20132020  (phase  1)  are  based  on  Petrobangla  forecasts  and  in  particular  the \nsupply of gas to an existing 360 megawatt (MW) power plant in Khulna and a proposed 360 MW \nplant  at  Bheramara.  Operating  costs  for  the  distribution  company  are  based  on  October  2008 \nestimates  made  in  the  DPP  prepared  by  the  Dakhshin  Paschimanchal  Gas  Bitoran  Prokalpa \nBastabayan  Unit  of  Petrobangla  and  the  operating  costs  of  the  Pashchimanchal  Gas  Company \nLimited (another newly formed company), which operates in the western part of the country. The \nprojections show that the SGCL would maintain a DSR exceeding 1.2 in all years through 2020. \n \nTitas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited. The TGTDCL is the oldest \n56. \ngas distribution and marketing company of the country, with a franchise area extending over the \narea  east  of  the  Jamuna\u2013Padma  river  system,  excluding  Sylhet  and  Chittagong  divisions  but \nincluding Brahmanbari. Its revenues from gas sales have been increasing by approximately 20% \nper annum, and the net profit in FY2008 reached Tk4,218 million. That year, the ROR on net fixed \nassets reached 37.3%, and the DSR exceeded 1.2 times debt obligations. Forecast gas sales are \nbased on the Petrobangla's supply\u2013demand projections. The TGTDCL derives its revenue mainly \nfrom its gas sales and wheeling charges. On this basis the projections demonstrate that a DSR of \n1.2 and the historic ROR in excess of 12% will be achieved through 2020. \n \n57. \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n\nThe  past  and  projected  financial  performance  of  the  executing  agencies  is  detailed  in \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Viability \n\n58. \n The financial evaluation of the project was carried out in accordance with the Guidelines \nfor  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB.8 The \nanalysis was carried out for (i) pipeline extensions, (ii) existing system reinforcement, and (iii) the \noverall  system  including  expansions  and  extensions.  For  the  field  appraisal  and  development \ncomponent, no financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was calculated, as the investment is meant \nto  more  clearly  delineate  gas  structures  to  determine  possible  increases  in  reserves  that  have \nfuture economic benefit. Financial analysis was undertaken in real terms using 2009 prices. The \nwithout-project  and  with-project  scenarios  were  compared.  Without  the project,  gas  shortages  in \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB.  2002.  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nBangladesh would continue. With the project, gas from northeast Bangladesh would be available \nto meet shortages in the existing gas supply area and supply new market areas in the southwest.  \n\n 59. \nThe  transmission  component  has  an  FIRR  of  9.6%  after  taxes,  and  the  distribution \ncomponent 5.5%. These compare favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 2.7% for \nthe  transmission  component  and  1.8%  for  the  distribution  component.  Sensitivity  analysis  was \nconducted for 10% increases in capital and operating and maintenance costs, a 10% reduction in \nproject  benefits,  and  a  combination  of  these  factors  together  with  project  delays.  Sensitivity  and \nrisk analyses show that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions and the project is financially \nviable. A summary of the project\u2019s financial evaluation is in Appendix 7. Considering the nature of \nproject  activities,  such  as  arresting  natural  gas  seepage  from  problematic  wells  and  energy \nefficiency  improvements,  there  can  be  opportunities  for  financial  benefits  under  the  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. The government and the executing agencies will \npursue such opportunities to further strengthen financial viability.  \n\n4. \n\nEconomic Viability \n\n60. \nDemand analysis. Future gas demand was analyzed for the area covered by the existing \npipeline system. Forecast gas sales for the existing network area provided the basis for estimating \nincreased  volumes  and  benefits  from  network  reinforcement.  The  analysis  assumed  that  the \npresent network would not be adequate to meet demand beyond 2013 level and that higher gas \nsales would be owing entirely to investment in the network.  \n\n61. \nLeast-cost analysis. The network analysis has been validated for the entire system, and \nchanging  any  one  element  may  affect  the  entire  system.  However,  between  any  two  points, \ncompressors or looping alternatives can be compared. The planned investment program is based \non  numerous  simulations  to  identify  the  locations  of  bottlenecks  as  throughput  increases  and  to \nremove those bottlenecks with compressors or looping. For all compressor locations identified as \nbottlenecks, costs of the pipeline looping alternative were estimated.  \n\n62. \nEconomic rate of return. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for \nthe  project,  considering  capital  costs  and  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  Conversion  factors \nwere  used  to  convert  financial  values  into  economic  values.  Values  are  expressed  in  mid-2009 \nprices. The main economic benefits of the project is the value of future imported petroleum fuels \nand  other  energy  sources  displaced  by  gas  and  growth  in  demand  from  new  and  existing \ncustomers.  The  EIRR  computed  for  the  entire  project  is  32%,  assuming  annual  average  gas \nsupply  of  80%  of  the  maximum  daily  demand  (Appendix  8).  Sensitivity  and  risk  analyses  on \nadverse  scenarios  showed  the  project  EIRR  to  be  stable  and  robust.  More  details  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \nB. \n\nSocial Assessment and Resettlement \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Assessment \n\nThe  social,  poverty,  and  development  impacts  of  the  project  have  been  analyzed.  The \n63. \nexpansion  of  the  gas  transmission  network  to  consumption  centers  and  the  construction  of  the \ndistribution network in the southwest will bring significant benefits to people. The project\u2019s impacts \ncan  be  classified  as  production,  income,  employment,  habitat,  health  and  safety,  quality  of  life, \nsociety and organization, poverty, gender, environment, and pricing.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n   15 \n \n \n\nThe project employed participatory preparation, and stakeholder consultation will continue \n64. \nduring  implementation.  As  the  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  did  not  identify  any \ncommunities  of  indigenous  people  that  would  be  affected,  no  indigenous  peoples  development \nplan is needed.  \n\n65. \nThe project will reduce poverty in the project areas. The poverty analysis carried out during \nproject  preparation  found  income  likely  to  increase  with  new  opportunities  that  are  expected  to \nopen up and increased employment arising from economic diversification. Income growth for the \npoor  will  come  from  (i)  expanded  off-farm  economic  activities;  (ii)  growth  in  agricultural  income \nmainly  from  cheaper  fertilizer  and  irrigation;  (iii)  expanded  markets  and  institutions  with  wider \navailability  of  gas  and  electricity;  (iv)  time  saved  that  can  be  devoted  to  other  income-earning \npursuits, particularly by women; and (v) the low cost of natural gas compared with other sources \nof energy. Non-income poverty can be reduced by (i) controlling the depletion of forest resources \nand  reducing  health  risks,  (ii)  empowering  women  through  new  income  opportunities,  and  (iii) \nestablishing  social  infrastructure  that  will  provide  better  services.  The  project  will  create  3,000 \nperson-months  of  unskilled  employment.  A  summary  of  the  poverty  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 9. \n\n2. \n\nResettlement \n\nUnder  part  A,  implementation  will  require  the  acquisition  and  requisition  of  land  on  the \n66. \nright-of-way of the gas transmission pipeline. The central 8 meters will be permanently acquired, \nwhile  the  remaining  15  meters  will  be  requisitioned  for  the  duration  of  the  civil  works.  In  full \nconsultation  with  affected  people  and  communities,  a  full  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  to \nmitigate  impacts.  The  GTCL  has  undertaken  efforts  to  minimize  adverse  impacts.  The  corridor \nwas  chosen  to  pass  through  agricultural  land  to  avoid  settlements  and  homesteads.  The  GTCL \nwill ensure that civil works are completed during the dry season to avoid disrupting crops on the \ntemporarily acquired land. The survey indicates that the construction and installation of the 61 km \nof  gas  pipeline  will  require  the  permanent  acquisition  of  50.65  hectares  (ha)  and  the  temporary \nacquisition  of  105.76  ha.  A  total  of  1,992  households  will  be  affected  by  permanent  acquisition, \nand 2,185 households will be affected by the temporary acquisition, for a total of 10,956 affected \npeople.  \n \n67. \nUnder part B, implementation will require the acquisition of 7.086 ha of mostly agricultural \nland, affecting 178 households. Of these, 113 households will permanently lose 6.26 ha of land, 3 \nhouseholds  will  lose  residential  property,  and  4  households  will  lose  175  trees.  The  remaining \n58 households  are  currently  affected  by  gas  seepage  that  costs  them  access  to  1.51  ha.  These \naffected  people  will  benefit  from  the  implementation  of  the  project,  as  they  will  regain  access  to \ntheir  land,  but  they  have  been  added  to  the  resettlement  plan  as  they  will  be  compensated  for \nincome  lost  to  seepage.  In  full  consultation  with  affected  people  and  communities,  a  full \nresettlement plan was prepared to provide appropriate mitigation. \n \n68. \nUnder  part  C,  the  project  sites  were  selected  and  the  components  were  designed  to \nminimize impacts by avoiding involuntary land acquisition and displacement and by confining the \nproject  to  land  already  available  to  the  government  or  the  GTCL.  Although  no  titled  landholders \nwill be affected, nine households (five in Khulna and four in Jessore) comprising 52 people (mainly \nsquatters)  will  be  temporarily  affected  for  a  maximum  of  1  week  and  will  therefore  require \ncompensation.  A  detailed  survey  of  100%  of  the  affected  people  was  conducted  in  June  2009. \nNine informal commercial structures will be temporarily affected. In full consultation with affected \npeople  and  communities,  a  short  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  to  assist  the  nine  affected \nhouseholds.   \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n69. \nThe  executing  agencies  continue  to  disclose  resettlement  plan  information  to  affected \npeople  through  various  means  including  pamphlets,  brochures,  and  newspapers  in  the  local \nlanguage.  All  resettlement  plans  were  submitted  to  ADB  in  July  2009.  The  government  assured \nthe  ADB  mission  that  compensation  to  all  affected  people  will  be  paid  according  to  the  ADB \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property \nOrdinance of 1982 and subsequent amendments to it\u2014and that full compensation will be awarded \nprior to the physical takeover of land acquired temporarily or permanently. In addition, temporarily \nacquired land will be restored to at least its pre-acquisition condition. Summary resettlement plans \nare in Appendix 10. The full resettlement plans are in Supplementary Appendixes H and I. \n \n70. \nAs  100%  of  the  affected  people  were  surveyed  and  no  indigenous  households  will  be \naffected  by  the  project,  the  project  was  classified  category  C,  and  no  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan is required. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Analysis  \n\n71. \nThe  executing  agencies  have  prepared  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  for  all \ncomponents  following  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the  government\u2019s  environmental \nimpact  assessment  guidelines  for  industries,  as  well  as  national  policies  and  legislation.  They \nidentify  the  potential  impacts  and  their  severity  and  duration.  The  IEEs  provide  mitigating \nmeasures  for  the  impacts  and  a  monitoring  plan.  The  IEEs  show  that  the  proposed  project \ninfrastructure will traverse farmland, rural areas, peri-urban areas, and secondary cities. It will not \npass  through  any  socially,  archeologically,  or  ecologically  sensitive  areas.  In  addition,  most \nimpacts  will  be  temporary  and  have  no  lasting  effect  if  mitigating  measures  outlined  in  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  are  followed.  The  summary  IEE  (SIEE)  for  the  project  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  E  highlights  the  findings  of  the  IEEs.  and  additional  information  and \nactivities included during the ADB review process.  The IEEs will be updated and approved to be \nin  line  with  the  SIEE.  The  project  is  environment  category  B,  so  a  full  environmental  impact \nassessment  is  not  required.  Before  the  commencement  of  construction,  the  environmental \nmanagement  plans  for  each  subprojects  will  be  detailed  in  the  project-specific  context  and \nincluded in construction contracts. \n\nD. \n\nExpected Benefits \n\n72. \nThe  project  will  expand  access  to  gas  in  less-developed  areas  of  the  country  to  achieve \nbalanced  regional  development  and  augment  transmission  capacity  in  southern  industrial  areas. \nThis  will  save  foreign  exchange  spent  on  fuel  imports  and  positively  affect  the  environment  and \nhealth, particularly of women and the poor, who are most vulnerable to smoke from cooking fires. \nAn  estimated  200,000  additional  households  will  have  access  to  new  gas  connections  in  the \nsouthwest. \n\n73. \nAn additional 1,400 industrial and commercial establishments and 35 compressed natural \ngas  filling  stations  will  have  access  to  gas  because  of  part  C  of  the  project.  The  industries  will \ninclude  small  fertilizer  plants,  jute  mills,  ceramic  factories,  dyeing  and  finishing  factories,  textile \nweaving  factories,  and  small  cottage  industries.  Commercial  entities  will  include  hotels, \nrestaurants,  and  bakeries.  These  industrial  and  commercial  installations  will  generate  significant \nemployment.  A  poverty  analysis  showed  that  incomes  are  likely  to  increase  with  new \nopportunities,  including those  resulting  from  economic  diversification.  Project  implementation  will \ndirectly create 3,000 person-months of unskilled employment. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n   17 \n \n \n\nAll  technical  studies  indicate  that  Bangladesh  has  adequate  gas  reserves  to  meet  its \n74. \nrequirements. Network analysis demonstrates constraints in the existing gas supply network. The \nleast-cost  analysis  shows  that  overcoming  those  network  constraints  will  require  installing \ncompressors  at  selected  transmission  points  and  looping  transmission  lines.  To  address  these \nnetwork  constraints,  the  project  will  install  compression  facilities  at  Ashuganj  and  Muchai. 9 \nTogether  they  will  augment  throughput  by  1,500  MMCFD  by  2015  with  adequate  supplies  from \ngas fields. The compressor facility at Ashuganj under the project will also increase supplies to the \ncentral  regions.  An  additional  loop-line  and  compressor  at  Elenga  will  be  installed  to  allow \nadequate  supply  to  the  western  region.  These  improvements  will  enable  the  project  design  to \nserve for the natural gas system for over 25 years. \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\n75. \nPolicy reforms. The main potential policy risk is failure or delay in introducing the required \nreforms and restructuring. ADB will maintain policy dialogue with the government on these issues. \nThis risk has been mitigated by introducing assurances to promote the acceleration of reforms, the \nquality  of  the  reform  content,  and  the  sustainability  of  implementation.  It  addresses  this  risk  by \napproaching difficult issues incrementally. \n\n76. \nCofinancing.  Korea  Eximbank  cofinancing  is  expected  for  part  A-1  of  the  project  under \nparallel, tied financing. In the unlikely event that Korea Eximbank financing is not forthcoming, part \nA-1  will  likely  be  excluded  from  the  project  scope.  This  would  not  affect  the  viability  or \nimplementation of the remaining components, as  each is independent.  \n\nImplementation risks. The project is subject to risks common to projects of such size and \n77. \ncomplexity.  The  project  has  been  designed  to  mitigate  policy  and  institutional  risks.  The \nsubprojects are not subject to any unusual technical and commercial risks. They involve financially \nsound SGCs and technically and commercially proven technologies. Cost overruns and delays in \nimplementation  are  major  potential  risks.  The  economic  impacts  of  the  subprojects  are  less \nsensitive to cost overruns and more sensitive to delays in implementation, but the basic economic \nreturns  remain  sound.  The  potential  risks  in  project  implementation  include  front-end  delays. \nMeasures have been incorporated in the project design to reduce these risks. \n\n78. \nGood governance. The project\u2019s design includes measures to promote good governance \nand  mitigate  the  risk  of  corruption.  These  include  disclosing  project  and  procurement-related \ninformation  on  a  project  website  and  preparing  bid  specifications  and  packaging  to  ensure \nmaximum competition under international competitive bidding. The executing agencies will benefit \nfrom  the  presence  of  a  procurement  specialist  stationed  at  the  resident  mission  to  identify  and \nproactively address procurement issues at an early stage. The procurement specialist will support \ncapacity  enhancement  among  executing  agency  staff  through  regular  meetings  and  customized \ntraining sessions on ADB procurement processes. \n \n79. \nProject readiness. Delays in project implementation in the gas sector have been a major \nconcern, frequently caused by lack of project readiness. Considering this, the government and the \nexecuting  agencies  have  taken  mitigation  measures.  These  include  advanced  preparation  and \napproval of the DPPs, as well as environmental and social safeguard documents. The preparation \nof  bidding  documents  for  goods  and  services  has  been  undertaken  before  loan  approval. \n\n                                                 \n9   Supply constraint will be partly addressed by the installation of gas compressors at Muchai by the private sector, to be \n\noperated in the public sector after cost recovery. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nMeasures  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design  to  reduce  delays  by  allowing  advance \nprocurement, retroactive financing, and advisory support for implementation.  \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  has  given  the  following \n\n80. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n\n1. \n\nPolicy and Regulatory Environment  \n\nThe government will continue implementing the GSRR to ensure optimal development of \n\n81. \nthe gas sector. \n\n82. \nThe government will formulate and approve the revised gas pricing policy by 31 December \n2010. The EMRD will adopt a formula in the revised pricing policy for determining upstream gas \nprices for the state gas companies based on the cost of future supply taking into account the price \nof international gas supplies and possible alternative fuels.  \n\nGas  sector  companies  will  directly  lodge  separate  tariff  applications  annually  with  the \n\n83. \nBERC from 31 December 2010. \n \n84. \nThe  EMRD  will  approve  the  policy  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in  the \noperation,  maintenance,  marketing,  and  billing  processes  of  gas  distribution  companies,  by  30 \nJune 2011. \n\n2. \n\nEfficiency Improvement \n\n85. \nGas  distribution  companies  will  start  accounting  for  energy  losses  based  on  actual \nmetered  consumption  instead  of  losses  based  on  billed  consumption  by  30  June  2011,  and  the \ncompanies will continue to maintain system losses below 2%.  \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Performance and Governance \n\n86. \nFrom the commencement of its operations, the SGCL shall install consumer meters for all \nhousehold  connections  and  introduce  metering  for  all  industrial  consumers  within  its  franchise \narea and bill its consumers exclusively on the basis of metered consumption.  \n\n87. \nPetrobangla  shall  develop  a  human  resources  strategy  for  the  entire  Petrobangla  group \nthat  encourages  recruitment  through  transparent  and  competitive  procedures  and  that  links \npromotions and salary increases to market benchmarks and individual performance. Petrobangla \nshall ensure that the implementation of the revised strategy commences from 1 January 2011. \n \n88.  With  immediate  effect,  the  SCGL  shall  recruit  permanent  staff  to  assist  in  the \nimplementation  of  part  C  and  later  to  operate  the  project  facilities  thus  established  upon  their \ncompletion.  \n \nThe GTCL and the TGTDCL shall continue to recruit their management including at least \n89. \nmanaging director, director (finance), and director (operations) on a competitive and a transparent \nbasis through open advertisements in the press, and fill any vacancies within six months after they \noccur.  Further, the existing vacancies shall be filled expeditiously.    \n\n\f \n\n \n\n   19 \n \n \n\n \n90. \nIn consultation with ADB, EMRD will prepare a time-bound action plan by 30 June 2011 to \nredefine  Petrobangla's  role  and  restructure  Petrobangla  to  promote  sustainable  development  of \nthe gas sector.  \n \n91. \nhave a debt service coverage ratio of 1.2 and (ii) the SGCL will have ratio of 1.2 from 2012.  \n\nThe government will cause to be ensured that (i) the GTCL and the BGFCL will continue to \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n92. \nThe  SGCL  will  have  entered  into  contractual  arrangements  with  private  entities  for \noperation,  maintenance,  marketing,  and  billing  for  gas  distribution  upon  commencement  of  its \noperations. \n\n93. \nThe  EMRD  will  closely  monitor  progress  in  the  installation  of  gas  compressor  station  at \nMuchai and its successful operation by the private sector to ensure augmenting gas supply to the \ntransmission  network.  The  EMRD  will  keep  ADB  regularly  informed  of  developments  in  this \nregard. \n \n\n5. \n\nLand Acquisition, Resettlement, and Social Issues \n\n94. \nThe  government  and  the  executing  agencies  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement  plans, \nincluding compensation and entitlements for affected households and persons, are implemented \nin  conformity  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  government,and  the  entitlement \nbenefits as listed in the applicable laws and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995).  \n \n95. \n Prior  to  land  acquisition  and  any  resettlement  for  the  project,  the  resettlement  plans, \nincluding  any  updates  based  on  consensus  of  the  affected  persons,  must  be  disclosed  with  all \nnecessary  information  made  available  to  persons  affected  by  the  project  and  confirm  that  it  be \nuploaded onto the ADB website.  \n \n96. \n Within  6  months  of  the  effective  date,  the  borrower  and  the  executing  agencies  shall \ndevelop and agree upon an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention and sensitization program \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  executing  agencies  shall  cause  contractors  to  implement  the  program \namong  the  contractors'  employees  for  the  duration  of  the  contract.  The  borrower,  through  the \nproject  management  units,  shall  monitor  the  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  prevention  and \nsensitization program. \n\n97. \n The  bidding  documents  for  the  civil  works  contracts  must  include  specific  provisions  to \nensure  that  the  contractors  (a)  comply  with  applicable  core  labor  standards,  labor  laws  and \nincorporate  applicable  workplace  occupational  safety  norms;  (b)  do  not  differentiate  payment \nbetween men and women or between people from different castes for work of equal value (c) do \nnot  employ  child  labor;  (d)  eliminate  forced  or  compulsory  labor;  (e)  eliminate  discrimination  in \nrespect  of  employment;  and  (f)  to  the  extent  possible,  maximize  employment  of  local  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  persons  for  construction  purposes,  provided  that  the  requirements  for  efficiency \nare adequately met.  \n \n \n\nEnvironmental Issues \n\n6.  \n\n98. \nThe government, through the executing agencies, will ensure that the design, construction, \nand  operation  of  all  project  facilities  comply  with  the  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nConditions  \n\nBangladesh  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policies  and  regulations,  specifically  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002) and environmental mitigating measures and the environmental management plans \ndescribed in the IEEs and in the summary IEE conducted for the project.  \n\n99. \nIn addition to the standard loan effectiveness conditions, for the loan to be effective, (i)  the \nBERC gas transmission and gas distribution tariff regulations shall have entered into force;,and (ii) \nthe subsidiary loan agreements between the government and the executing agencies, in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, shall have become effective and binding on the government and \nthe executing agencies in accordance with their terms. \n \n100.  The  government  shall  ensure  that  the  EAs  will  not  award  any  works  contracts  financed \nunder  the  loans  until  they  have  updated  the  IEEs  in  line  with  the  SIEE  and  the  resulting \namendments have been approved by the government, the EAs and ADB \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n101. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  loan  of  $261,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Natural \nGas  Access  Improvement  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of \n5 years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance \nwith  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements  presented  to  the \nBoard; and  \n\nthe  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR  3,249,000  to  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Natural  Gas  Access  Improvement  Project  from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board.  \n\n26 February 2010 \n\n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nData \nSources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n21 \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nAssumptions \n\nGas consumption in the industrial \nsector to grow from 800 MMCFD \nto 1,400 MMCFD \n\nGovernment economic \nstatistics and reports \n\nPolitical and socioeconomic \nconditions remain stable \n\nNational statistics on gas \nsupply and utilization  \n\nStable economic growth in the \nregion \n\nPopulation using natural gas as \nprimary energy source to \nincrease from 5% in 2008 to 10% \nby 2015 \n\nProject completion \nreports \n\nGas sector losses in non-bulk \nconsumption reduced from 2.8% \nin 2009 to 2.0% by 2011  \n\nNatural gas transmission and \ndelivery capacity expanded from \n2,000 MMCFD in 2008 to 3,500 \nMMCFD by 2015 \n\n20% increase in average cost \nrecovery per unit of gas used in \nhouseholds supplied under the \nproject compared with the \nnational average by 2015  \n\nAssumptions \n\nAnnual reports of \nPetrobangla and SGCs \n\nNational statistics on gas \nsupply and utilization \n\nGas supply and \nutilization data from the \nhydrocarbon unit of the \nMinistry of Power, \nEnergy, and Mineral \nResources  \n\nContinued government focus on \nreforming the gas sector and \ndeveloping gas infrastructure \n\nAvailability of sufficient \nrecoverable gas reserves \n\nAdequate production from the \ngas fields \n\nContinued expansion of natural \ngas use  \n\nRisk \n\nContinued underpricing of gas \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n\nImpact  \n\nIncreased and more \nreliable access to natural \ngas for sustained \neconomic growth \n\nOutcome \n\nExpanded capacity and \nimproved efficiency in \nnatural gas production, \ntransmission, and \ndistribution systems \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAssumptions \n\nNational statistics on gas \nsupply and utilization \n \n\nCounterpart funds made \navailable in time for construction, \noperation, and maintenance \n\nTimely implementation of projects \n\nAppointment of competent \ncontractors for implementation \n\nAnnual reports of \nPetrobangla and SGCs \n\nQuarterly progress \nreports  \n\nReview mission reports \n\nProject completion \nreport \n\n \n\n \n\nOutputs  \n\n1.

Petrobangla carries out its \ngas  business  through  nine  operating  companies:  Bangladesh  Petroleum  Exploration  and \nProduction  Company  Limited,  engaged  in  exploration  and  production;  Bangladesh  Gas  Fields \nCompany  Limited  (BGFCL)  and  Sylhet  Gas  Fields  Limited,  both  involved  in  gas  field \ndevelopment  and  production;  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited  (GTCL),  involved  in \ntransmission; Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited (TGTDCL), Bakhrabad \nGas  Systems  Limited  (BGSL),  Jalalabad  Gas  Transmission  and  Distribution  System  Limited, \nand Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited, all involved in transmission and/or distribution; and \nRupantarita Prakritik Gas Company Limited, involved in liquefied petroleum gas production and \ncompressed  natural  gas  marketing.  The  TGTDCL,  the  oldest  and  largest,  operates  in  the \nfranchise area of Dhaka Division (excluding greater Faridpur District) and Brahmanbaria District. \nThe BGSL serves the market in Chittagong Division excluding Brahmanbaria District. Jalalabad \nGas Transmission and Distribution System Limited serves the market in Sylhet  Division, while \nPashchimanchal  Gas  Company  Limited  operates  in  the  franchise  area  in  Rajshahi  Division.  A \nnew company, Sundarban Gas Company Limited (SGCL), is being established to distribute gas \nin the southwest. These state gas companies (SGCs) have been incorporated as public limited \ncompanies  under  the  Companies  Act,  1913  (amended  in  1994).  The  organization  chart  of \nPetrobangla  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  The  upstream  gas  sector  is  regulated  by  the \ngovernment. The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), established in 2004, is \nthe regulator for downstream activities in the gas sector, including gas tariff determination. \n\n2. \nNatural  gas  can  provide  most  of  the  current  and  future  energy  requirements  in \nBangladesh,  and  the  gas  market  needs  to  be  expanded  to  optimize  the  use  of  natural  gas \nresources and support economic development. Although Bangladesh has produced natural gas \nfor  over  3  decades,  all  of  its  major  fields  are  underdeveloped  and  have  not  been  properly \ndelineated.  There  are  widely  varying  assessments  of  the  country\u2019s  natural  gas  reserves.  The \ndiscovered  reserves  are  those  that  have  been  confirmed  by  drilling  and  reliable  geological \nmapping.  Undiscovered  reserves  are  yet  to  be  confirmed  by  drilling  and  therefore  have \nuncertainty and risk attached to them, depending on the assumed recovery factor that reflects \nthe probability of the resources becoming at least equal to the estimated level.1 \n\n3. \nThe opening up of natural gas exploration and production to international oil companies \n(IOCs)  in  the  1990s  through  production-sharing  contracts  has  contributed  to  improved  gas \nsupply in recent years. Total proven recoverable gas reserves in Bangladesh from 23 fields (19 \nin the public sector and 4 in the private sector) are estimated at 20.60 trillion cubic feet (TCF), of \nwhich  7.68  TCF  has  so  far  been  consumed.  The  current  net  recoverable  reserve  stands  at \n12.95  TCF.  Out  of  23  gas  fields,  17  have  so  far  been  brought  under  production  and  14  are \ncurrently  under  production. 2 Production  from  the  remaining  three  fields  was  suspended  for \ntechnical reasons. However, these three fields (Chhatak, Kamta, and Feni) appear to have the \npotential to produce further with added efforts, and IOCs are participating in redeveloping two of \nthem. The total of proved and probably recoverable reserves not now in production amounts to \nmore  than  4.00  TCF,  of  which  3.00 TCF  was  discovered  in  post  production-sharing  contract \nareas. The largest field is Bibiyana, with estimated recoverable reserves of more than 2.40 TCF. \n                                                 \n1   When  using  probabilistic  methods  in  resource  estimation,  the  terms  proven,  probable,  and  possible  are  used. \nProved (1P) means 90% probability; proved and probable (2P) means 50% probability; and proved, probable, and \npossible (3P) means 10% probability.  \n\n2   Bangladesh  Petroleum  Exploration  and  Production  Company  Limited  recently  discovered  a  gas  field  at  Srikail, \n\nwhich is under investigation. \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nA  study  by  the  hydrocarbon  unit  estimates  that  there  is  a  90%  probability  that  undiscovered \nresources will be at least 19.00 TCF (1P) and could go up to 42.00 TCF at 50% probability (2P). \nTaking  the  discovered  and  undiscovered  reserves  together,  there  is  a  90%  probability  that \nBangladesh\u2019s gas reserves exceed 30.00 TCF.  \n\nThough  IOC  production  has  already  reached  50%  of  the  national  total,  Petrobangla \n4. \npredicts that over the next 12 years, IOC production will comprise 30%\u201345% of supply, with the \nbalance from SGCs. SGCs will drill  43  wells in the next 12 years at a cost of $266  million and \nrequire  an  additional  $84  million  for  gas  treatment  plants.  The  IOCs  will  be  required  to  invest \n$275 million. Definitive contractual gas supply and investment commitments have been made, \nand international financial resources are sufficient to fulfill these commitments. \n\n5. \nPetrobangla recently revised its forecast of gas demand and supply through 2020. Gas \nconsumption  rose  from  365  billion  cubic  feet  (BCF)  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2001  to  690  BCF  in \nFY2009, for a compound average annual growth rate of 7.3%. The highest consumption growth \nrate was in the non-bulk category, with an average growth rate over the period of 23%. The non-\nbulk  category  comprises  industry,  commerce,  households,  tea,  brick  field  (seasonal),  and \ncompressed natural gas (CNG). In FY2006, industrial consumers accounted for 49% of the non-\nbulk  category  and  households  40%.  Between  FY1999  and  FY2007,  average  annual  growth \nrates  in  consumption  were  12.4%  for  industry  and  16.3%  for  households.  The  high  rate  of \ngrowth in domestic consumption can be attributed to rapid construction growth and rural\u2013urban \nmigration and scarcity of alternative cheaper fuel for domestic use. CNG recorded phenomenal \ngrowth  during  FY2003\u2013FY2008  going  from  0.003  BCF  in  FY2003  to  24.2  BCF  in  FY2008. \nGovernment initiatives to arrest air pollution by encouraging the use of indigenous natural gas, \nincreasing  the  prices  of  alternative  fuels  for  automobiles,  increasing  the  number  of  CNG-\npowered  vehicles,  and  expanding  multiple  uses  of  indigenous  natural  gas  have  been  major \ncontributors to the rapid increase in CNG consumption. Growth in gas consumption to produce \nelectricity was 1.5% over the period, and for fertilizer \u20136.5%. \n \nThe gas demand forecast revised by Petrobangla reflects supply constraints. The overall \n6. \ngrowth  rate  assumed  in  the  forecast  is  7.3%,  the  same  as  the  historic  growth  rate  for  2002\u2013\n2008.  Even  at  the  current  level  of  consumption,  remaining  recoverable  reserves  will  be \nexhausted in 20 years; with a 6% growth rate, the remaining recoverable reserves will last about \n13 years. Given the current reserve status and anticipated shortfall in meeting growing demand, \ngreat care must be taken in committing new gas usage in less-productive sectors. \n \n7. \nTo  meet  growing  demand  and  overcome  production  and  transmission  deficiencies, \nlarge-scale  investments  in  exploration,  field  development,  and  transmission  and  distribution \nhave  to  be  made.  Petrobangla  estimates  that  average  gas  demand  will  rise  to  4,115  million \ncubic  feet  per  day  (MMCFD)  in  FY2020.  Probable  gas  production  from  existing  gas  fields  is \nexpected to peak at 2,655 MMCFD in FY2017 and then gradually decline to 2,468 MMCFD in \nFY2020. Petrobangla projects production by IOCs to peak at 1,550 MMCFD in FY2017 with new \ndiscoveries both onshore and offshore. Overall peak production by SGCs and IOCs is estimated \nto reach 3,555 MMCFD in FY2017.  \n \n \nTo  augment  gas  production,  Petrobangla  has  drawn  up  a  program  for  further \n8. \nexploration,  renovating  wells  in  producing  gas  fields,  and  drilling  new  wells  in  producing  and \nnon-producing gas fields with self and government financing. Petrobangla estimates production \nenhancement  rising  to  400  MMCFD  by  FY2012,  which  appears  to  be  optimistic.  Production \naugmentation is likely to be around 250\u2013300 MMCFD.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n       \n\nThe  recently  concluded  ADB  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  for  the  Bangladesh \n9. \nenergy  sector  highlights  the  main  findings  related  to  the  gas  sector:  (i)  overdependency  on \nnatural  gas  as  a  primary  energy  source,  which  threatens  the  energy  security  of  the  country; \n(ii) underpricing  of  gas  resources,  encouraging  suboptimal  allocation  and  inefficient  use;  and \n(iii) the  need  to  diversify  energy  sources  and  place  greater  emphasis on  regional cooperation. \nThese  are  the  main  lessons  from  ADB  operations  relevant  to  the  gas  sector:  (i) Programmed \nlending  for  investments  linked  to  an  agreed  medium-term  road  map  for  sector  reforms  can \nachieve  development \nImproved  corporate \ngovernance, managerial autonomy, and performance-based incentives can significantly change \ninstitutional  performance  even  if  there  is  no  change  in  ownership  and  personnel.  (iii)  And  the \ndomestic private sector is capable of investing in relatively capital-intensive energy industries if \nappropriate  incentives  and  policy  regimes  are  established.

Gas  sector  coordination  is  assisted  by  the  Energy  and \nMineral  Resources  Division  (EMRD).  Coordination  among  the  development  partners  and \nexchange  of  information  are  carried  out  through  a  local  coordination  group,  which  consists  of \nfocused  subcommittees  for  each  of  the  core  areas  of  assistance.  As  the  leading  development \npartner  in  the  energy  sector,  ADB  chairs  the  focused  subcommittee  on  energy.  The  energy \nsubcommittee holds regular meetings to discuss the latest issues and experiences in the energy \nsector, with all development partners represented. In addition, there are bilateral meetings with \nleading energy sector development partners like the World Bank and JICA. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n       \n\nAchievements \n\nC. \n \n4. \nEfforts  in  development  coordination  in  the  energy  sector  have  greatly  advanced  the \nsector  reform  agenda  and  helped  improve  the  regulatory  environment  in  particular.  ADB \ncontinues  its  dialogue  with  development  partners  in  the  gas  sector  through  the  energy \nsubcommittee,  which  is  kept  informed  of  project  progress  during  ADB  missions.  Energy \nsubcommittee meetings were held during the fact-finding mission in May 2010 and the appraisal \nmission  in  December  2010  to  enlighten  development  partners  on  progress  in  processing  the \nproject,  for  which  the  energy  subcommittee  has  expressed  its  support.  During  bilateral \nmeetings,  the  Export\u2013Import  Bank  of  Korea  (Korea  Eximbank),  JICA,  and  World  Bank \nseparately expressed their support for the project.  \n \nADB  had  a  successful  joint  appraisal  mission  with  Korea  Eximbank.  Korea  Eximbank \n5. \nconfirmed  its  commitment  to  funding  part  A-1  of  the  project,  subject  to  final  approval  by  its \nmanagement and the Government of the Republic of Korea. \n \nC. \n\nSummary and Recommendations \n\n6. \nThe  coordination  arrangement  in  the  energy  sector  among  development  partners \nthrough the local coordination group has been successful in ensuring a coordinated approach to \nsector  reforms  and  in  avoiding  any  overlapping  interventions.    Further,  the  coordination  of \nassistance  in  the  gas  sector  by  the  government  through  EMRD  has  been  effective.  It  is \nrecommended to continue these arrangements with more regular interaction.   \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \nTable A4.1: Cost Estimates by Project Component \n\nForeign \n\n$ Million\nLocal\n\n  Subtotal for Part A\n\n146.18\n\n108.42\n\n254.60\n\nItem\nPart A: Transmission Capacity Expansion\nA-1.

\n\nGeneral Methodology and Assumptions   \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n\nThe financial analysis of the proposed subprojects has been carried out in accordance \n1. \nwith  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.1 All \nfinancial  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in  constant  2009  prices.  Cost  streams  (i.e.,  capital \ninvestment  and  operation  and  maintenance)  reflect  the  costs  of  delivering  the  estimated \nbenefits. Financial analysis was undertaken for the transmission and distribution components of \nthe project. In the case of the safety and supply efficiency improvement component, no financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) is calculated.  \n \nThe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  for  both  Gas  Transmission  Company \n 2. \nLimited  (GTCL)  and  Sundarban  Gas  Company  Limited  (SGCL)  was  calculated  and  compared \nwith  the  project  FIRRs  to  ascertain  financial  viability.  The  project  is  evaluated  over  a  20-year \nperiod. It is assumed that the subprojects will have a 30-year economic life and a residual value \nof  33%  of  the  original  investment  at  the  end  of  20  years.  The  financial  evaluation  considered \nonly  the  incremental  revenues  and  costs  directly  associated  with  the  project.  All  costs  and \nrevenues  are  expressed  in  mid-2009  prices.  Capital  costs  included  physical contingencies  but \nexcluded price contingencies and interest during construction. An exchange rate of Tk70 = $1 \nwas  assumed.  Repair  and  maintenance  costs  of  project  assets  were  based  on  estimates \nadopted  in  the  economic  evaluation.  An  allowance  was  made  of  1.0%  of  capital  costs  for \npipeline  maintenance  and  2.5%  of  capital  costs  for  compressor  maintenance,  plus  a  fuel  cost \nbased on 1.5% of gas throughput at an average wellhead gas cost of Tk1.17 per cubic meter \n(m3). After 10 years, rehabilitating compressors is assumed at 50% of project costs. \n \nB. \n\nGTCL Gas Transmission Subprojects \n\nFor  the  GTCL  the  compressor  and  transmission  subprojects  are  primarily  designed  to \n3. \nrelieve  downstream  supply  constraints  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  system  operations.  The \nsubprojects  funded  under  the  project  are  included  in  the  context  of  a  least-cost  development \nplan for the network in the case of the compressors at Muchai and Elenga.2 Likewise, depletion \nof the Sangu gas field has meant that additional gas needs to be transmitted to Chittagong from \nAshuganj,  which  has  resulted  in  a  new  transmission  constraint  on  the  existing  Ashuganj\u2013\nChittagong  pipeline.  The  61-kilometer  (km)  Ashuganj\u2013Bakhrabad  loop-line  is  the  first  step  in \nrelieving this constraint. However, the 160 km Ashuganj\u2013Barabkunda loop-line is evaluated, as \nthis is necessary to realize the benefits in terms of increased gas supply at Chittagong.3   \n \n 4. \nThe GTCL derives its revenue from wheeling charges on gas volumes and condensate \nvolumes transported. For analysis purposes a rate of Tk0.64 per m3 is used, with gas volumes \nbased  on  those  adopted  in  the  economic  analysis.4 The  incremental  gas  volume  that  can  be \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n2   This  analysis  includes  the  Muchai  compressor  financed  by  the  private  sector  and  the  Muchai\u2013Ashuganj  and \nDhanua\u2013Elenga  loop-lines  to  be  financed  in  the  future.  Analysis  of  all  system  enhancements  was  undertaken  to \novercome the difficulties inherent in attributing the benefits to an upgrade of only part of the transmission system. \n3   Analysis of the entire loop-line enhancement was undertaken to overcome the difficulties inherent in attempting to \nascribe benefits to an upgrade to only part of the system upgrades where downstream pipeline restrictions means \nthis section would yield only a fraction of the total benefit of increasing gas supplies to Chittagong.  \n\n4 The current rate is Tk0.32 per m3. However, GTCL covenants require a rate of return on net fixed assets of 10%, \nand the wheeling charge will have to double by fiscal year (FY) 2012 to achieve this objective and meet the GTCL's \ndebt service, which will increase from Tk1,245 million in FY2010 to Tk4,680 by FY2015. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nCalculation Weighted Average Cost of Capital for the GTCL \n\nmoved as a result of the proposed investments is 798 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) by \nfiscal year (FY) 2015.  \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe WACC post tax is estimated at 2.7% and made up of government equity estimated \nat 11.72%5 nominal and relending of foreign funded components at 5.0%6 and domestic funds \nat an interest rate of 4.0% (Table A7.1). \n \n\nTable A7.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n(%) \n\n Item \nAmount ($ million) \nWeighting \nNominal cost \nTax rate \nTax adjusted nominal cost \nInflation rate \nReal cost  \nWeighted average cost of capital \n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD. \n\nADB  \n160.0 \n53.6 \n5.0 \n37.5 \n3.1 \n0.8 \n2.3 \n1.2 \n\nLoans \n\nDomestic \n19.0 \n6.4 \n4.0 \n37.5 \n2.5 \n7.0 \n(4.2) \n(0.3) \n\nGovernment \nEquity \n119.0 \n40.0 \n11.7 \n0.0 \n11.7 \n7.0 \n4.4 \n1.8 \n\nTotal  \n299.0 \n100.0 \n \n \n \n \n \n2.7 \n\nCalculation of FIRR, Risk Assessment, and Sensitivity Analyses \n\nExternal  risks.  Regulatory  or  tariff  revision  risk  for  the  subprojects  is  substantial,  with \n6. \ntariff increases of 100% assumed in the financial analysis. However, financial covenants are in \nplace  to  ensure  that  the  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (BERC)  approves  this \nincrease  in  the  GTCL's  margin  by  2012.  Without  such  increases,  the  GTCL\u2019s  long-term \nsustainability  is  in  jeopardy.  Gas  demand  risk  is  minimal,  as  the  country  already  experiences \ngas  shortages,  with  the  Bangladesh  Oil,  Gas,  and  Mineral  Corporation  (Petrobangla)  able  to \nsupply only 80% of managed demand from present sources. Geopolitical and political risks are \npresent for all projects in Bangladesh. However, the nature of the investments and the shortage \nof gas in Bangladesh serve to diversify this risk. Therefore, the risk to the financial sustainability \nof  the  GTCL  is  deemed  to  be  minimal,  with  the  project  seen  as  a  necessary  step  toward \nimproving supply, especially by improving the efficiency of the transmission system.  \n \nProject-specific  risks.  Financial  risks  include  (i)  increases  in  the  prices  of  civil  works \n7. \npipelines  and  equipment,  (ii)  delays  in  project  implementation,  and  (iii)  failure  of  counterpart \nfunds to materialize. These risks are low since (i) cost estimates were based on recent tenders \nreceived,  and  advanced  procurement  will  lessen  the  time  between  loan  effectiveness  and \ndisbursement; (ii) the GTCL\u2019s implementation capacity is low but adequate, and implementation \nconsulting support will be provided; and (iii) the projections prepared for the GTCL demonstrate \nthat, with increases in wheeling charges, cash flows will improve and the GTCL will be able to \nrepay debt associated with the investments.  \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \n \n5 10-year Treasury bond rate.  \n6 The government determines the onlending rate of foreign loans, irrespective of the London interbank offered rate, \nwith  foreign  loans  attracting  a  5%  interest  rate.  However,  the  loans  are  in  foreign  currency  and  attract  foreign \nexchange losses or gains annually, with the GTCL bearing the foreign exchange risk. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n43 \n       \n\nSensitivity  analyses.  Separate analyses were carried out to examine the sensitivity of \n8. \nprojected financial returns to adverse changes in key variables. The variables considered for the \nsensitivity  analyses  were  a  10%  increase  in  capital  costs,  10%  increase  in  operating  and \nmaintenance costs, 10% decrease in revenues, and a 2-year implementation delay with a 20% \nincrease in costs and no allowance for residual values. In addition, the impact of no increase in \nwheeling charges and a 50% increase by 2012 to Tk0.48 per m3 were examined.  \n \n9. \nSummary  of  results.

The  project  is \n1. \ndesigned  to  address  some  constraints  faced  by  the  gas  sector  in  terms  of  production  and \ntransmission,  distribution,  energy  efficiency,  and  safety.  The  government\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nstrategy emphasizes policies to expand the natural gas grid to improve access to gas, promote \nextensive  industrialization,  and  accelerate  balanced  regional  development,  which  would  help \nreduce widespread poverty. Thus the project is expected to improve equity in access to gas and \nimprove  the  environment  and  health,  particularly  of  women  and  the  poor,  who  are  the  most \nvulnerable to smoke from cooking fires. \n \n \n2. \nThe  depletion  of  the  Sangu  gas  field  has  meant  that  additional  gas  needs  to  be \ntransmitted  to  Chittagong  from  Ashuganj,  which  has  resulted  in  a  new  transmission  constraint \non  the  existing  Ashuganj\u2013Chittagong  pipeline.  The  61-kilometer  (km)  Ashuganj\u2013Bakhrabad \nloop-line  is  the  first  step  toward  relieving  this  constraint.  The  compressors  at  Ashuganj  and \nElenga,  together  with  the  compressors  at  Muchai  constructed  under  an  international  oil \ncompany  (IOC)  initiative,  can  potentially  increase  gas  flow  by  244  million  cubic  feet  per  day \n(MMCFD).  The  safety  component  will  control  seepage  of  gas  from  abandoned  wells.  This  will \nreduce  hazards  and  improve  the  environment  in  the  gas  fields.  The  success  of  future \ninvestments in transmission and distribution depends on gas supply expansion because there is \na  growing  gap  between  demand  and  supply.  In  this  context,  component  B  focuses  on \naugmenting gas supply from the Titas gas field.  \n \n3. \nThe  public  sector  investment  in  this  project  is  justified  as  transmission  and  distribution \nfacilities are a natural monopoly. In addition, the project intervention corrects some other market \nfailures  by  reducing  indoor  air  pollution  through  improved  access  to  natural  gas,  improving \nsafety  and  the  environment  in  abandoned  gas  fields,  and  improving  supply  and  end-user \nefficiency,  which  would  not  be  undertaken  by  the  private  sector.  The  expected  global \nenvironmental  benefits  associated  with  reduced  greenhouse  gas  emissions  will  be  significant. \nThe  project  does  not  crowd  out  any  potential  private  sector  investments.  However  the  project \nhas  certain  characteristics  of  private\u2013public  partnership.  For  example,  some  of  the  facilities \ndeveloped  by  the  project  facilitate  gas  production  by  IOCs,  and  some  investments  in \ncompressors come from the private sector.  \n \nIn  addition  to  correcting  market  failures,  the  project  includes  a  number  of  measures  to \n4. \ncorrect  some  of  the  non-market  failures  to  ensure  project  outcomes.  These  measures  include \nenhancing  sector-level  governance;  focusing  on  broader  sector  reforms;  realistic  tariff \ndetermination;  setting  up  a  regulatory  institute  and  defining  its  functions;  and  enhancing  the \nthe  approval  process  and \nsustainability  of  energy  sector  operations  by  streamlining \nimplementing  the  energy  policy,  proposed  gas  act,  and  updated  gas  sector  reform  road  map. \nUnder the road map, several gas sector enterprises are required to undergo restructuring and \nimplement strategic business plans. Gas sector entities will also implement the plan to reduce \ngas system losses. \n \nB. \n\nDemand Analysis \n\nIn July 2008, the Bangladesh Oil, Gas, and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) revised its \n5. \nforecast  of  gas  demand  through  2020.  This  forecast  supersedes  that  prepared  by  Wood \nMackenzie  in  2006  as  part  of  the  gas  sector  master  plan  and  is  now  its  official  forecast.  Gas \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nconsumption  rose  from  365  billion  cubic  feet  (BCF)  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2001  to  557  BCF  in \nFY2008, for a compound average annual growth rate of 7.3%. The highest consumption growth \nrate was in the non-bulk category, with an average growth rate over the period of 23%. The non-\nbulk  category  comprises  industry,  commerce,  households,  tea,  brick  field  (seasonal),  and \ncompressed  natural  gas  (CNG).  In  FY2006,  industry  accounted  for  49%  of  the  non-bulk \ncategory  and  households  40%.  Between  FY1999  and  FY2007,  industry\u2019s  average  annual \nconsumption  growth  was  12.4%  and  households\u2019  16.3%.  The  high  rate  of  growth  in  domestic \nconsumption  can  be  attributed  to  rapid  construction  growth  and  rural\u2013urban  migration  and  the \nscarcity  of  alternative  cheaper  fuel  for  domestic  use.  CNG  recorded  phenomenal  growth  from \nFY2003  to  FY2008  rising  from  0.003  BCF  in  FY2003  to  24.2  BCF  in  FY2008.  Government \ninitiatives to arrest air pollution by encouraging the use of indigenous natural gas, increasing the \nprices of alternative fuels for automobiles, increasing the number of CNG-powered vehicles, and \nexpanding  multiple  uses  of  indigenous  natural  gas  have  been  major  contributors  to  the  high \nincrease in the consumption of CNG. Growth in gas consumption for electricity was 1.5% and \nfor  fertilizer  \u20136.5%  over  the  period.  The  gas  demand  forecast  revised  by  Petrobangla  reflects \nsupply  constraints.  The  overall  growth  rate  assumed  in  the  forecast  is  7.3%,  the  same  as  the \nhistoric growth rate for 2002\u20132008. \n \n6. \nTo  meet  growing  demand  and  overcome  production  and  transmission  deficiencies, \nlarge-scale investments in exploration, field development, transmission, and distribution have to \nbe  made.  Petrobangla  estimates  that  maximum  gas  demand  will  rise  to  5,144  MMCFD  in \nFY2020. Probable gas production from existing gas fields is expected to peak at 2,475 MMCFD \nin  FY2017  and  then  gradually  decline  to  2,288  MMCFD  in  FY2020.  Petrobangla  projects \nproduction  peaking  at  1,080  MMCFD  in  FY2017,  following  new  discoveries  by  IOCs  both \nonshore  and  offshore.  Overall  peak  production  by  state  gas  companies  (SGCs)  and  IOCs  is \nestimated to reach 3,555 MMCFD in FY2017. Despite the increase, gas supply is inadequate to \nmeet the demand because demand is growing more quickly. \n \nC. \n\nLeast-Cost Analysis  \n\n7. \nThe  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited  (GTCL)  has  undertaken  a  least-cost  analysis \nof system improvements. Analyses were conducted considering additional gas production only \nfrom  new  sources  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Kailashtilla  and  Muchai  hubs.  The  analysis  included \n13 options that were compared regarding financial costs and technical feasibility. Analysis took \ninto  consideration  discounted  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  compressors  and  pipeline \nover 20 years along with capital cost for comparison. \n \n8. \nOngoing improvements in the gas transmission and distribution system were taken into \naccount.  The  planned  loop-lines  were  assumed  to  be  completed  before  the  commissioning  of \nthe  compressors  stations  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  D  for  the  different  options  and \nassociated  costs).  The  entire  simulation  assumes  that  the  system  meets  maximum  day \ndemand.  Option  H  (Muchai\u2013Ashuganj  30-inch  new  loop-line)  appears  to  be  the  least-cost \noption.  Sound  system  operation  depends  largely  on  line  pack  availability  for  use  during  peak \nhours and repacking the lines off peak. As such, an option that will ensure faster packing and \nmaximum  withdrawal  during  peak  hours  would  be  the  best  option  for  selection,  irrespective  of \ncost. An additional compressor, compared with option H, means faster packing of lines off peak \nfor  utilization  during  peak  hours.  Considering  these  technical  requirements,  option  N  was \nselected  as  optimum  given  its  cost  and  technical  characteristics.  Option  N  comprises \ninstalling \nconstructing  Muchai\u2013Ashuganj  and  Dhanua\u2013Elenga  30-inch \ncompressors at Muchai, Ashuganj, and Elenga. The cost difference between selected and least-\ncost options is small. \n\nloop-lines  and \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n47 \n       \n\nEconomic Analysis Methodology and Assumptions \n\n \nD. \n \n9. \nEconomic analysis of the project was undertaken in accordance with Asian Development \nBank (ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.1 Separate economic analyses for \ncomponents  of  the  project  have  not  been  carried  out  because  the  components  will  work \ntogether to remove some of the constraints on the gas transmission and distribution system. All \nthe improvements to transmission, distribution, supply augmentation, and compressors will bring \nan  incremental  increase  in  gas  flow  in  the  GTCL  system.  Economic  analysis  was  undertaken \nbased on the benefits of this incremental gas supply from system improvements.  \n \n10. \nAs all policy reforms, institutional capacity building, and training are treated as necessary \nto  deliver  the  final  output  of  the  project,  no  additional  benefits  were  estimated  for  these \nactivities.  Demand  management  may  result  in  some  energy  savings  by  current  consumers, \nallowing new consumers to consume gas. Since access to gas is currently limited to some end \nusers,  this may  not  result  in  net  savings.  Therefore,  no  additional  benefits  were  considered  in \nthe  analysis.  Environmental  benefits  from  reduced  indoor  air  pollution,  greenhouse  gas \nemissions, and seepage in gas fields were not quantified because of data problems. \n \n11. \nThe  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  has  been  estimated  by  Bangladesh  Planning \nCommission at 1.03, which has been adopted for the analysis. It is assumed that there are no \nsignificant  distortions  in  wage  rates  for  skilled  labor.  In  the  case  of  unskilled  labor,  a  shadow \nwage rate factor of 0.75 was adopted, based on parameters used by the Bangladesh Planning \nCommission.  \n \n12. \nAll costs and benefits are expressed at constant 2009 prices. The world price numeraire \nwas used in the analyses. Financial costs were allocated across the categories shown in Table \nA8.1. Investments will be required in upstream gas exploration and production to meet forecast \nsales. The life-cycle gas cost on an average incremental cost basis of $1.32 per thousand cubic \nfeet,  as  shown  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D,  has  been  taken  as  a  measure  of  the  long-run \nmarginal cost of gas production.  \n .  \n\nTable A8.1: Cost Categories and Conversion Factors \nConversion Factor \n\nCost Component \nTraded goods and service \nNon-traded goods and services \nForeign skilled labor \nLocal skilled labor \nLocal unskilled labor \nFuel \nTaxes and financing charges \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n1.00 \n0.97 \n1.00 \n0.97 \n0.73 \n0.97 \n0.00 \n\n \n13. \nA  12%  economic  discount  rate  was  used,  and  a  period  of  20  years  has  been  used  for \neconomic  evaluation.  Investment  is  assumed  to  take  place  in  2010\u20132015,  and  benefits  are \nassumed to be realized from 2016, when Muchai compressor is expected to be operational. No \nresidual values are assumed in year 20. \n \n14. \nIt is assumed that the incremental flow of gas will displace sources of energy currently \nused by the beneficiaries. The incremental gas flow attributed to this project is derived from the \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nnetwork  analysis.  The  resource  cost  saving  arising  from  energy  displacement  is  the  main \neconomic benefit quantified in the analysis. Access to gas may bring incremental consumption, \nwhich  was  not  considered  in  the  analysis  because  of  lack  of  information  on  incremental \nconsumption  and  willingness  to  pay.  However,  since  the  project  provides  a  high  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR),  this  omission  does  not  affect  the  economic  feasibility  of  the \nproject. The details of the values of displaced fuel are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n15. \nAs exploiting natural gas depletes reserves, it entails an additional opportunity cost. This \nadditional  cost\u2014the  depletion  premium\u2014is  incorporated  in  the  economic  appraisal  of \nnonrenewable  resource  projects,  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of \nProjects.  The  substitute  fuel  price  was  based  on  a  price  of  $60  for  crude  oil.  The  long-run \nmarginal cost of wellhead gas of $1.32 per million cubic feet was used as the extraction cost. \nThe value of benefits against the economic cost of fuels displaced by gas in the existing network \nand western zone distribution project is $11.4 per million cubic feet. \n \nE. \n\nResults \n\n16. \nThe  EIRR  for  the  project  is  summarized  in  Table  A8.2.  Note  that  the  combined  costs \ninclude capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, gas extraction costs, and the depletion \npremium. The base case assumes only 80% of the incremental gas flow attributed to the project \nwill be delivered to end users. The results show that the project EIRR is 32%. The net present \nvalue  is  large  because  of  very  low  gas  extraction  cost  and  the  higher  economic  costs  of \ndisplaced energy sources. \n \nTable  A8.2  presents  the  results  of  the  sensitivity  analysis.  The  rate  of  return  of  the \n17. \nproject  is  less  sensitive  to  capital  cost  increase.  Even  if  the  predicted  incremental  gas  flow  is \nreduced  by  half,  the  project  provides  acceptable  returns.  The  most  sensitive  factor  for  the \nproject is resource cost savings. A 20% reduction in the prices of energy sources displaced by \ngas  will  lower  the  EIRR  to  19%.  This  is  not  a  real  risk  to  the  project,  as  it  is  unlikely  that  oil \nprices  will  drop  below  $60  per  barrel,  the  price  used  in  the  economic  analysis.  Delay  in \ncommissioning the project will have some impact, but project analysis assumes that no benefits \noccur in the first 6 years. The results of sensitivity analyses show that project returns are robust \nagainst all risks. \n  \n\nTable A8.2: Results of Sensitivity Analyses  \nVariation \n\n Item \nBase Case \nProject capital costs \nIncremental gas flow \nResource cost savings \nGas extraction cost \nCommissioning delayed one year \nCommissioning delayed + capital and maintenance cost increase  \n100% system efficiency \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n+50% \n\u201350% \n\u201320% \n+50% \n+1 year \n +1 year + 50%  \n \n\nEIRR (%) \n32 \n31 \n22 \n19 \n24 \n\n23 \n15 \n37 \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n49 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \nCountry/Project Title: Bangladesh: Natural Gas Access Improvement Project \n \n \nLending/Financing \nModality:  \n\nProject Loan \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\n \n\n \n\nSouth Asia Department \nEnergy Division \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  Based  on  the  country  poverty  assessment,  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  the  sector  analysis,  describe  how  the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nThe Government of Bangladesh has as its overarching goal and development vision, as articulated in the Poverty Reduction \nStrategy  adopted  in  November  2005,  to  substantially  reduce  poverty  and  invigorate  social  development  in  the  shortest \npossible time. The strategy also commits the government to halve the proportion of the population living below the poverty line \nby 2015. The strategy stresses the links among investment, growth and job creation, and poverty reduction, and it identifies \nkey areas where reforms are needed, public investments are required, and public policies can be improved. \n \nInfrastructure, particularly for energy, will play a very significant role in achieving the envisaged economic growth and poverty \nreduction.  Reliable  access  to  energy  is  essential  for  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction.  However,  the  energy \nsector  has  recently  been  afflicted  by  shortages  of  gas  and  electricity,  which  stifles  economic  growth  and  social  welfare \nimprovement.  The  government  is  implementing  comprehensive  energy  sector  reforms  through  a  carefully  sequenced \napproach to ensure reduced physical distribution costs and improve service delivery to the poor and poorer geographic areas. \n \nNatural gas is the dominant energy resource of the country, accounting for 75% of the total commercial energy consumption. \nIt can significantly contribute to reducing poverty, particularly in the project areas, where 54% of the households are estimated \nto  live  below  the  poverty  line.a  Natural  gas  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  by  expanding  access  to  clean  energy  and \nemployment opportunities during project construction and, after completion, increasing economic activity in the project area. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: GI \n \n1. Key Issues  \nThe project will make clean energy available to the less-developed southwestern region of Bangladesh, and its population of \n10 million (7% of the country\u2019s total). The analysis conducted during project preparation indicates that 30% of beneficiaries (3 \nmillion)  are  poor  and  will  directly  or  indirectly  benefit  from  the  project.  The  channels  through  which  the  income  of  the  poor \nwould potentially increase are (i) expansion in off-farm activities; (ii) growth in agricultural income; (iii) expansion of markets \nand institutions with more available gas and electricity; (iv) time savings that can be devoted to other income-earning pursuits, \nparticularly  by  women;  and  (v)  lower  costs  of  cooking.  The  contributions  to  reducing  non-income  poverty  are  through  (i) \ncontrolling  the  depletion  of  forest  resources,  (ii)  empowering  women  by  creating  off-farm  income  opportunities, \n(iii) establishing  social  infrastructure  that  can  provide  better  services  (e.g.,  health  centers  and  educational  institutions),  and \n(iv) building social relations and status.  \n \nThe proportion benefits accruing to the poor has been estimated for all benefits allocated by the distribution analysis. Benefits \nto domestic consumers have been allocated according to the proportion of consumers that are poor. Domestic consumers will \nmainly be residents of the project area, and benefits are allocated using the poverty incidence in the project area. The poverty \nimpact ratio is estimated to be 30%, which indicates that the project reduces poverty.  \n  \n2. Design Features. The project will create 3,000 person-months of unskilled job opportunities equally for men and women. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues.  \nSocial studies carried out in 2009 show that the project will necessitate the acquisition of private land, with significant impact \non affected households. \n \nTo mitigate these impacts, the three gas companies have adopted full and short resettlement plans with detailed resettlement \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nand  rehabilitation  provisions  to  address  the  loss  of  land,  structures,  livelihood,  and  common  property  resources.  The  gas \ncompanies  have  also  addressed  community  concerns  about  compensation  packages  for  land  and  replacement  of  common \nproperty resources. In addition, a grievance redress mechanism has been put in place to address, for example, apprehension \nabout  environmental  pollution  and  compensation.  The  social  analysis  shows  that  an  immediate  benefit  of  the  project  is \nenvisaged in terms of livelihood and employment opportunities during plant construction and operation.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nTo  ensure  proper  community  participation,  various  stakeholders\u2014representatives  of  vulnerable  groups,  local  leaders,  and \nmayors\u2014were consulted during the project preparation. The gas companies undertook consultations  with local officials and \nvillage  leaders  in  the  project  area.  These  consultations  played  a  vital  role  in  raising  awareness,  gaining  local  support,  and \nenabling affected people to voice their opinions and suggestions on project design and implementation. The poor and women \nhave  been  carefully  considered  in  conducting  participatory  activities.  As  part  of  the  social  assessment,  stakeholders\u2019 \nconsultations  were  carried  out  in  the  project  areas  with  the  broad  objective  of  ensuring  the  extensive  participation  of  all \nstakeholders. The participatory approach will be continued during implementation. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n Information sharing   \n\n Consultation   \n\n Collaborative decision making  \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes  \n\n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \n \nWhile a separate C&P plan has not been prepared, adequate provisions of community consultation and participation during \nproject  implementation  have  been  made  and  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  plan,  entailing  several  additional  rounds  of \nconsultations with affected people during project implementation.  \n \n\nC. Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nAttempts were made during project preparation to consult women regarding their perceptions of the project and its adverse \nand positive impacts through gender analysis. Expanded gas production and transmission will bring several positive changes \nin  the  daily  life  of  womenfolk.  Access  to  gas  will  cut  cooking  costs  and  reduce  the  time  women  spend  cooking  food  and \ncollecting fuel. \n \nSome  women  landowners  and  households  headed  by  women  will  be  affected  by  land  acquisition.  The  resettlement  plan \nprovides for additional assistance to households headed by women and some other vulnerable groups.  \n \n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n Gender plan    \n\n Other actions/measures   \n\n No action/measure \n\n \nSummarize key design features of the gender plan or other gender-related actions/measures, including performance targets, \nmonitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n \nCompensation will be paid at replacement value. Consultation  processes will ensure the representation of  women villagers. \nWhile the rights of  women landowners  as legal titleholders are recognized under the law, the resettlement plan  will provide \nadditional assistance to households headed by women and other vulnerable groups.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nLimited/ \nNo Impact \nSignificant \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nFull and short resettlement plans have been \nprepared for subprojects under the loan, \ncompensating land at \nreplacement value and restoring common \n\nPlan or Other Measures \nIncluded in Design \n\n Full Plan \n Short Plan \n Resettlement Framework \n No Action \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n51 \n       \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\nNo Impact \n\nLabor \n\nNot significant \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n\n Labor \n\nretrenchment \n Core \n\nlabor \n\nstandards \n \n\nAffordability \n\nNot significant \n\nNot significant \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict, \npolitical instability, \netc), please specify \n\nproperty resources and livelihoods. \n\nThe initial poverty and social assessment and \nthe resettlement census did not identify \nindigenous people or ethnic minorities in the \nproject area. Therefore, the project does not \nneed an indigenous people\u2019s development \nplan or framework. \n\nThe project is anticipated to create job \nopportunities both temporarily and long term. \nTemporary employment opportunities will be \ncreated during project construction.  \n \nContractors shall consult with township labor \nofficials and village leaders while selecting \nunskilled labor in project area. The contractor \nshall ensure that national labor standards are \napplied. \nThe project is anticipated to increase access \nto cheap fuel in the project area. \n\nLack of capacity in implementing agencies \nand other stakeholders to implement social \nsafeguards and policy, particularly regarding \nland acquisition, could be a risk. Project \ndesign will have a component to build the \ncapacity of staff in the three executing \nagencies on social safeguards.  \n\nMeasures to prevent HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking will be taken according to \nassurances provided in the main text. \n\nIV.

The \nshort resettlement plan for part C is in Supplementary Appendix H.1 \n \n2. \nThe  distribution  pipeline  with  two  feeders  will  follow  the  right-of-way  of  existing  roads \nbelonging  to  the  municipalities  and  city  corporation.  Project  sites  were  selected  to  minimize \nimpacts by avoiding involuntary land acquisition and displacement and by confining the project \nto  government  or  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited  (GTCL)  land.  Although  no  titled \nlandholders will be affected, nine households comprising 52 persons (mainly squatters) will be \ntemporarily  affected  for  a  maximum  of  1 week  and  will  therefore  require  compensation.  A \ndetailed  survey  of  100%  of  the  affected  people  was  conducted  in  June  2009.  Nine  informal \ncommercial structures will be temporarily affected. All nine affected households will be affected \ntemporarily by losing their livelihoods. No common property or resources will be affected. \n \n\nTable A10.1: Summary of Impacts \n\nAffected Structure \nPottery shop \nButchery \nTea stall \nTotal \nSource: Sundarban Gas Company Limited \n\nAffected Households \n1 \n4 \n4 \n9 \n\nAffected People \n7 \n25 \n20 \n52 \n\n \n \n3. \nThis short resettlement plan is based upon the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable \nProperty Ordinance of 1982 (Ordinance II of 1982) and subsequent amendments and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995).

Of  these,  113  will  permanently  lose  15.47  acres  of  land,  three  will \nlose  residential  assets  (two  will  lose  boundary  walls  and  one  will  lose  a  temporary  residential \nstructure and a boundary wall), and four will lose 175 trees. The remaining 58 are now impacted \nby the gas seepage, which costs them access to 3.73 acres. The latter affected households will \nbe compensated for the loss of access to their land from seepage. The project will not further \naffect them except to allow them to use their land again. \n \n\nTable A10.3: Summary of Impacts \n\nImpact \nAgricultural land \nResidential asset \nTrees \nAffected by gas seepage \nTotal \n\nAffected Households \n113 \n3 \n4 \n58 \n178 \n\nAffected Area/Item \n15.47 acres \n3 structures \n175 trees \n3.73 acres \n \n\n \nOut of the 171 households incurring impact on land, 37% (65 households) will incur an \n7. \nimpact on more than 10% of their land. Among these 171 households, 17% will suffer the loss of \nless  than  1%  of  their  total  landholding,  with  limited  impact  on  their  income,  and  35%  (59 \nhouseholds)  will  suffer  losses  ranging  from  1%  to  5%  of  their  landholding.  The  remaining \n31 households will lose from 5% to 10% of their land.  \n \n8. \nLand  acquisition  will  be necessary  for  drilling  wells  and  installing  processing  plants,  as \nno  public  land  is  available  in  the  project  area.  However,  the  BGCL  has  devoted  particular \nattention  during  the  planning  process  to  ensuring  minimal  impacts.  Locations  were  chosen  to \nmeet  both  economic  and  social  requirements,  with  minimum  disturbance  and  no  homestead \nresettlement. Public consultations with local communities were particularly effective in achieving \nthis goal.  \n \n9. \nThis  resettlement  plan  is  based  upon  the  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable \nProperty  Ordinance  of  1982  (Ordinance  II  of  1982)  and  subsequent  amendments  and  ADB's \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The entitlement matrix is in Table A10.7  \n \n10. \nAffected  households  that  are  vulnerable  or  will  lose  more  than  10%  of  their  productive \nassets  will  receive  additional  support  for  livelihood  restoration.  A  nongovernment  organization \n(NGO)  for  resettlement  consulting  will  be  recruited  specifically  to  assess  their  needs.  The \nresettlement officer will be in charge of monitoring the implementation of the resettlement plan. \nHe or she will also ensure that the resettlement budget is available in a timely manner. \n \n11. \nA  grievance  redress  committee  will  be  established  at  the  project  level  by  the \ncommencement of civil works with  the primary  objective of providing a  mechanism  to mediate \n                                                 \n2   In case of any changes in the project design during the implementation, the revised and updated resettlement plan \n\nwill be submitted to ADB for review prior to award of civil works contracts. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\ndisputes concerning resettlement assistance and project-related grievances.

Three segments: 8 meters in the middle and 6 meters and \n9 meters on the two sides will constitute the width of the land acquisition. The central 8 meters \nwill be permanently acquired, while the remaining 15 meters will be requisitioned, or temporarily \nacquired, for the duration of the civil works. \n \nThe  GTCL  has  undertaken  efforts  to  minimize  adverse  impacts.  In  this  regard,  the \n14. \ncorridor  was  chosen  to  pass  through  agricultural  land  and  avoid  settlements  and  disruption  of \nhomestead. The GTCL will ensure that civil works are completed during the dry season to avoid \ndisrupting crops on land that will be temporarily acquired. \n \n15. \nThe survey indicates that the construction and installation of the 61 km of gas pipeline \nwill  require  the  permanent  acquisition  of  50.65  hectares  (ha)  and  the  temporary  acquisition  of \n105.76 ha. A total of 1,992 households will be affected by the permanent acquisition , and 2,185 \nhouseholds  will  be  affected  by  temporary  acquisition,  for  a  total  of  10,956  affected  people. \nSupplementary Appendix I (Tables 2.0\u20132.9) contains a detailed breakdown of impacts. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3   In  case  of  any  changes  in  the  project  design  during  the  project  implementation,  the  revised  and  updated \n\nresettlement plan will be submitted to ADB for review prior to award of civil works contracts. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n55 \n       \n\nTable A10.5: Summary of Impacts \n\nPermanent \n\n \n\nTemporary \n\nAffected \nhouseholds \n1,892 \n12 \n15 \n16 \n11 \n8 \n26 \n12 \n1,992 \n\nAffected \nhouseholds \n2,070 \n12 \n16 \n22 \n12 \n6 \n28 \n19 \n2,185 \n\nArea (ha) \n101.33 \n0.38 \n0.55 \n0.33 \n0.42 \n0.13 \n0.93 \n1.67 \n105.76 \n\nArea (ha) \n48.79 \n0.21 \n0.27 \n0.17 \n0.21 \n0.12 \n0.52 \n0.36 \n50.65 \n\nImpact \nAgricultural land \nFallow land \nMud-house \nTin shed \nSemi-packa/packa house \nGarden (fruit/wood) \nPond \nOther (ditch, yard, etc.) \nTotal \nSource: Gas Transmission  Company Limited \n \n16. \nThis  resettlement  plan  is  based  upon  the  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable \nProperty  Ordinance  of  1982  (Ordinance  II  of  1982)  and  subsequent  amendments  and  ADB's \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995).
