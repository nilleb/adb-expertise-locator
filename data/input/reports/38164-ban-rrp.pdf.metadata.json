Initial environmental examinations for \nAssessment  the project have been completed and will be updated in line with the \nsummary initial environmental examination in Supplementary Appendix E. \n   \nProject  The project has four components: (i) the construction of 61 kilometers \nDescription  (km) of gas transmission pipeline for transporting 400 million cubic feet \nper day (MMCFD), including interface metering and regulating stations at \nselected locations and the installation of compressors at Ashuganj and \nElenga; (ii) safety and supply efficiency improvement in Titas gas field to \nincrease gas production by 120 MMCFD; (iii) the construction of a 845 km \ngas distribution network in the southwest to improve energy access; and \n(iv) support for supply and demand management. \n   \nRationale  Natural gas contributes 70% of primary energy supply in Bangladesh. It \nhas dominated the power sector, fueling 85% of power generation. As the \ncountry is highly dependent on natural gas for its economic development, \nthe sustainability of gas supplies is critical.  \nGovernment  policy  in  the  gas  sector  since  1993  has  been  to  attract \nprivate investments to upstream gas field development while improving \nthe  network  coverage  and  operational  efficiency  of  companies  that \nproduce  and  distribute  natural  gas.  Bangladesh  managed  to  attract \nsignificant investments from the private sector for gas exploration and \nincreased gas production by over 100% since 1998. The share of gas \nproduction by international oil companies (IOCs) grew to almost 50% of \nthe total supply in 2008.  \nExponentially increasing demand for gas has introduced a supply deficit. \nTo address the demand\u2013supply gap, national oil companies and IOCs \nhave been investing in existing fields and new discoveries to increase \nproduction. By 2017, these interventions and the recently concluded 3rd \nround of bidding will increase the gas supply by 74% compared to supply \nin 2008. The government is currently examining several options to further \nimprove supply: (i) additional investment in existing fields, (ii) initiating \nanother  round  of  bidding  for  exploration;  and  (iii)  importing  liquefied \nnatural gas as a medium- to long-term measure. \nThe  transmission  and  distribution  network  is  inadequate  to  meet  the \nneeds of industry, commerce, and households. The capacity of the state ", "ii \ngas  companies  is  insufficiently  developed  to  access  international \nfinancing. Therefore gas transmission and distribution continue to need \npublic financing.  \nOperational  performance  in  the  gas  sector  has  been  affected  by \ninadequate  investment  in  all  subsectors,  compounded  by  uneconomic \ntariffs,  inadequate  investment  resources,  inefficient  use  of  gas,  and \ninadequate  capacity  in  the  state-owned  gas  companies  and  the \ngovernment. The government's gas sector reform road map (GSRR) is \ndesigned  to  address  many  of  these  issues.  The  GSRR  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policy dialogue with the government includes \ntime-bound  actions  to  improve  the  policy  and  regulatory  environment, \nsector  planning,  and  corporate  governance,  as  well  as  to  implement \nstructural and pricing reforms. Some of the key actions, such as approving \nthe  GSRR,  operationalizing  the  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory \nCommission (BERC), licensing gas companies, and cabinet approval for \nthe  proposed  gas  act,  are  already  accomplished.  The  government  is \ncommitted to continuing the implementation of other measures identified \nin the GSRR. \n  The proposed physical investments are the most urgent components of \nthe gas sector\u2019s priority investment program. The gas sector master plan \nprovides the basis for investment planning by the Bangladesh Oil, Gas, \nand  Mineral  Corporation  (Petrobangla)  and  its  affiliates.  The  need  to \nprovide gas to Chittagong from fields in the northeast and the constraints \non the national supply of gas have focused investment priorities on these \nareas.  Removing  bottlenecks  in  the  transmission  system  has  become \ncritical to ensuring the efficient delivery of higher gas volumes. Safety and \nsupply efficiency improvement at the Titas gas field is necessary to avoid \na major accident and sustain the current level of production from the field \nin  the  long  term.  With  the  extension  of  the  natural  gas  transmission \npipeline  to  the  Khulna  Division  under  the  Gas  Transmission  and \nDevelopment Project (GTDP), improving the distribution network in the \nsouthwest  is  essential  to  making  gas  available  to  consumers  in  that \nregion.  \n   \nImpact and  The impact of the project will be increased and more reliable access to \nOutcome  natural gas for sustained economic growth, achieved by reinforcing and \naugmenting natural gas supply and addressing policy and institutional \nconstraints.  \n \nThe main outcome of the project will be expanded capacity and improved \nefficiency  in  natural  gas  production,  transmission,  and  distribution \nsystems.  \n   \nOutputs  Part A: Transmission capacity expansion  \n(i)  Part A-1: Ashuganj\u2013Bakhrabad gas transmission loop-line. The \nsubcomponent will construct a 30 inch, 61 km pipeline from Ashuganj \nto Bakhrabad and install interface metering and regulating stations at \nthe selected locations of Monohordi, Dewanbag, Kutumbupur, Feni, \nand Barabkundu. ", "  iii\n(ii) Part A-2: Installation of compressors at Ashuganj and Elenga. \nUnder this subcomponent, a compressor will be installed at Ashuganj \nwith a throughput of 1,500 MMCFD and another at Elenga with a \nthroughput of 500 MMCFD. \nPart B: Safety and supply efficiency improvement in Titas gas field. \nThis component will service problematic wells in Titas gas field to improve \nsafety  and  supply  efficiency  and  add  four  appraisal-cum-development \nwells and processing plants to increase production by 120 MMCFD.  \nPart  C:  Access  improvement  in  the  southwestern  region.  The \ncomponent will construct a 2-inch to 20-inch, 845 km distribution pipeline \nin the southwest, covering the districts of Kushtia, Jhenidah, Jessore, \nKhulna, and Bagerhat (including Mongla). \nPart D: Supply and demand management. This component will pilot a \nremote sensing metering system for industrial consumers and a prepaid \nmetering  system  for  domestic  consumers  within  the  gas  distribution \nfranchise  area  of  Titas  Gas  Transmission  and  Distribution  Company \nLimited  (TGTDCL).  This  component  will  also  develop  an  investment \nprogram for improving the efficiency of gas use. \n   \nCost Estimates  The project is estimated to cost $542 million equivalent, including taxes \nand duties of $101 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  ADB  loan  will  be  $261  million  equivalent  from  ordinary  capital \nresources (OCR) and $5 million equivalent from the Asian Development \nFund (ADF). Korea Eximbank will provide $45 million equivalent for part \nA-1. The government will provide $231 million equivalent through loan and \nequity contributions. \n   \nLoan Amount and  (i)  A loan of $261 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (the OCR \nTerms  loan) will finance parts A-2, B, and C and will have a term of 25 years \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, and a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum.  \n(ii) A second loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR 3,249,000 from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (the ADF loan) will finance part D and \nwill have a repayment period of 32 years including a grace period of 8 \nyears, an interest charge of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% \nthereafter, and other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and \nproject agreements. \n   \n \nAllocation and  The government will make the loan proceeds available to the executing \nRelending Terms  agencies and cause the proceeds to be applied to financing subproject \nexpenditures through separate subsidiary loan agreements, the terms of \nwhich must be acceptable to ADB.  \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 September 2015  \nUtilization \n   \n ", "iv \nEstimated Project  31 March 2015  \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting  Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) will be the executing agency \nAgencies  for part A, Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited (BGFCL) for part B, \nSundarban Gas Company Limited (SGCL) for part C, and TGTDCL for \npart D. Petrobangla will be the executing agency coordinating project \nimplementation. \n   \nImplementation  The  direct  supervision  and  monitoring  of  project  implementation  and \nArrangements  operational  performance  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  executing \nagencies. Petrobangla will establish a project coordination unit. \n   \nProcurement  The procurement of goods and services to be financed under the loans \nwill  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time), except those for part A-1, to be \nfunded by Korea Eximbank. International competitive bidding procedures \nwill be used for all procurement funded under the ADB loans. Ancillary \nfacilities, including building and service areas under domestic financing, \nwill follow government procedures. \n \nADB  management  has  approved  advance  contracting  for  procuring \nequipment and civil works and recruiting consultants, subject to eligibility \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).    ADB \nmanagement  has  also  approved  retroactive  financing  for  consulting \nservices  for  implementing  part  B  prior  to  the  signing  of  the  loan \nagreement, with a ceiling of $500,000. The borrower and the executing \nagencies have been informed that approval of advance contracting or \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n   \nConsulting  International consultants associated with national consultants will support \nServices  the GTCL for part A, BGFCL for part B, SGCL for part C, and TGTDCL for \npart  D  in  implementation  activities,  including  design,  engineering, \nprocurement,  construction,  human  resource  development,  and  energy \nefficiency improvement. All consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method. Consultants will be engaged as a firm. \n   \nProject Benefits  The  government\u2019s  ongoing  reform  program  based  on  the  GSRR  will \nand Beneficiaries  strengthen the financial position of sector entities, enhance public\u2013private \npartnership, and improve sector and corporate governance. The project \nwill create efficient and viable gas infrastructure to address priority supply \nand network constraints. These interventions will ensure sustained growth \nin the gas sector, which is critical to the country's economic development. \nAn estimated 200,000 households will gain access to gas through the new \ndistribution  network.  The  project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \nenvironment and health, particularly of women and the poor, who are the \nmost  vulnerable  to  indoor  air  pollution  from  the  use  of  biomass  and \nfuelwood, which will be replaced with natural gas. An additional 1,400 ", "  v\nindustrial and commercial establishments and 35 compressed natural gas \nfilling stations will have access to gas in the southwest. Industries such as \njute mills, textile weaving factories, small cottage industries, and textile \nmills,  and  commercial  entities  such  as  restaurants  and  bakeries,  will \nbenefit, generating significant employment in the region and thus reducing \npoverty.  The  project  will  directly  create  3,000  person-months  of  job \nopportunities during implementation. \nThe subcomponents are financially sound and economically viable, with \nfinancial internal rates of return ranging from 5.5% to 9.5%, greater than \nthe weighted average cost of capital of 2.7%. The economic internal rate \nof return for the integrated project is 32%. Sensitivity analysis indicates \nthat the project remains viable under adverse conditions.  \n   \nRisks and  Policy reforms. The main policy risk is failure or delay in introducing \nAssumptions  required reforms and restructuring under the GSRR. Measures have been \nincluded in the project as assurances. ADB will maintain a regular policy \ndialogue with the government on these issues. \nCofinancing. Korea Eximbank cofinancing is expected for part A-1 of the \nproject under parallel financing. In the unlikely event that Korea Eximbank \nfinancing is not forthcoming, part A-1 will be excluded from the project \nscope.  This  would  not  affect  the  viability  or  implementation  of  the \nremaining components, as each is independent. \nProject  readiness.  Delays  in  implementing  previous  ADB-financed \nprojects in the gas sector, frequently caused by the executing agencies\u2019 \ninadequate project readiness, is an area of concern, including delays in \ngovernment approvals for project component proposals, slow progress in \nland acquisition, and cumbersome procurement procedures. Taking into \naccount these lessons and to mitigate this risk, the government and the \nexecuting  agencies  have  undertaken  various  advance  actions.  These \ninclude the approval of the development project pro formas, preparation of \nenvironmental  and  resettlement  requirements,  and  preparation  of \nprocurement  documents.  Measures  have  been  incorporated  in  project \ndesign to reduce delays by allowing advance procurement, retroactive \nfinancing, and advisory support for implementation.  \nGood  governance.  The  project  design  includes  various  measures  to \npromote  good  governance  and  mitigate  the  risk  of  corruption  by \nenhancing  transparency  and  accountability  in  doing  business.  These \ninclude  disclosing  project  and  procurement-related  information  on  a \nproject website and preparing bid specifications and packaging to ensure \nmaximum  competition  under  international  competitive  bidding.  Any \nprocurement issues can be immediately addressed through the recently \nstrengthened procurement oversight and on-site advice available at the \nresident mission, minimizing delays and opportunities for corruption. \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Natural Gas Access Improvement Project.1 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Government policy in the gas sector since 1993 has been to attract private investments to \nupstream gas field development while improving the network coverage and operational efficiency \nof  national  gas  companies.  Bangladesh  managed  to  attract  significant  investments  from  the \nprivate  sector  for  gas  exploration  and  increase  gas  production  by  over  100%  since  1998. \nHowever, the rapid increase in demand for gas for power generation and residential, industrial, \nand commercial use has recently brought gas supply shortages.  \n \n3.  The operational performance in the sector is affected by inadequate investment in all \nsubsectors. Uneconomic tariffs, the lack of adequate investment resources, inefficient gas use, \nand  inadequate  capacity  in  state-owned  gas  companies  (SGCs)  and  the  government  have \nacerbated  this  situation.  The  updated  gas  sector  reforms  road  map  (GSRR)  is  designed  to \naddress these issues. The GSRR and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy dialogue include \ntime-bound  actions  to  improve  the  policy  and  regulatory  environment,  sector  planning,  and \ncorporate governance, as well as to implement structural and pricing reforms. Key actions, such \nas  approving  the  GSRR,  operationalizing  the  Bangladesh  Energy  Regulatory  Commission \n(BERC), licensing gas companies, and cabinet approval for the proposed gas act, have been \ncompleted. The government continues to implement other measures in the GSRR. A sector \nassessment and the GSRR are in Appendix 2. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Natural Gas Supply\u2013Demand Balance \n4.  Bangladesh has 12.5 trillion cubic feet of discovered gas reserves remaining and 32 trillion \ncubic  feet  of  potential  reserves  to  be  confirmed  through  exploration.  Until  the  1990s,  gas \nproduction capacity exceeded demand. Since then, domestic demand for gas has increased \nexponentially,  with  higher  demand  from  industry  and  power  generators.  International  oil \ncompanies (IOCs) have significantly helped increase gas production to match rising demand. \nTheir share of gas production grew to reach almost 50% of the total supply in 2008. \n5.  Current  daily  average  gas  demand  of  1,890  million  cubic  feet  per  day  (MMCFD)  is \nexpected to increase to 3,559 MMCFD by 2017. Recent investments by national oil companies \nand IOCs will increase gas production by 49%, to 3,055 MMCFD, by 2017. The government has \nfinalized  contracts  following  a  3rd  round  of  bidding  that  will  bring  additional  production, \ncontributing to the overall increase in supply by 74% and bringing it to 3,555 MMCFD by 2017. \nThe government is examining other options to further improve gas supply: (i) additional investment \nin existing fields, (ii) initiating another round of bidding for exploration, and (iii) importing liquefied \nnatural gas. The GSRR has emphasized improving efficiency and mobilizing private resources to \nsupport production, and supply.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Gas Sector Development \nProgram. Manila.  ", "2   \n2.  Gas Sector Regulation and Pricing \n6.  As the regulator of the upstream gas sector, the government sets the wellhead gas tariff \nfor SGCs, which is substantially below world market prices and the prices of alternative fuels. \nThese prices do not provide sufficient revenue to support further gas exploration by the state-\nowned companies. The price of gas from IOCs is linked to world market prices. Blended gas from \nSGCs and IOCs, with an average wellhead price of about one-tenth of the world market price, \nprovides the basis for downstream gas prices. \n \n7.  The  BERC  recently  started  regulating  the  downstream  gas  sector,  and  most  gas \ncompanies have obtained operating licenses from it. In its recent first tariff order, BERC could not \naddress the issue of unsustainably low gas prices, as the wellhead price was not within its \nregulatory purview. Its tariff order for the integrated sector does not reflect the cost of network \noperations. The policy of making gas available to users at a minimal price has caused inefficient \ngas use and underinvestment in gas infrastructure. The GSRR and ADB policy dialogue with the \ngovernment  include  actions  to  ensure  efficient  gas  sector  regulation,  regarding  pricing  in \nparticular. The government is expected to fully operationalize the BERC with a complete legal \nframework through the gas act and government pricing policy guidelines. \n \n3.  Government Policies and Plans \n8.  Priority elements of the government\u2019s energy sector strategy include (i) ensuring good \ngovernance  through  the  autonomy  of  sector  entities,  including  private  sector  participation; \n(ii) designing and implementing a competitive and equitable pricing policy; (iii) strengthening and \nimproving commercial operations; (iv) enacting laws to strengthen the legal framework to enable \neffective  private  sector  participation  and  defining  the  sector  restructuring  program; \n(v) implementing an action program to improve the financial performance of gas sector entities; \nand (vi) strengthening institutional capability in policy making and monitoring. The gas sector \nmaster plan for 2005\u20132025 envisages investments of $2.5 billion in exploration, field development, \ntransmission,  and  distribution.  An  investment  of  $363  million  is  envisaged  in  oil  and  gas \nexploration, $179 million in appraisal and field development, and $46 million in renovating wells to \nsustain production. Nearly 522 kilometers (km) of gas transmission pipeline will require about $1.8 \nbillion, and 1,300 km of distribution pipeline will require $150 million. \n4.  Lessons  \n9.  The evaluation of energy sector assistance programs in Bangladesh outlined several key \nlessons typical to the gas sector.2 These lessons include the need to (i) minimize delays in project \nimplementation; (ii) improve local capacity in project preparation, implementation, and operation, \nas well as the selection of appropriate technology; (iii) improve ownership of technical assistance \nprojects; and (iv) improve project and financial management capacity in project implementing \nagencies.  Gas  Transmission  and  Development  Project  (GTDP)  experienced  delays  from \nprocurement difficulties, involving cost overruns and institutional weaknesses in introducing and \nimplementing  new  technologies,  which  required  careful  drafting  of  technical  specifications. \nUnsustainable gas pricing was highlighted as a main cause of the inefficient allocation and use of \ngas.3 \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003.

To  mitigate  these  risks,  executing  agencies  have  undertaken  various  actions.  These \ninclude advance approval of development project pro formas (DPPs) and the preparation of \nprocurement documentation. Measures have been incorporated in the project to reduce delays \nthrough advance procurement and consultancy support for implementation. Substantial technical \ncapacity  building  in  executing  agencies  has  been  incorporated.  Cost  estimates  have  been \ncarefully prepared, and an adequate contingency budget has been provided, taking into account \npast experience to avoid cost overruns. External expertise has been brought into drafting the \ntechnical specifications for the new technologies, and they have been revisited based on recent \nexperience.  An  independent  assessment  of  the  specifications  has  been  carried  out.  Several \nmeasures have been included in the project to address the gas pricing issue.  \n5.

ADB  strategy  for  developing  the  gas  sector  covers  support  for  (i)  improved \ncommercialization,  including  private  sector  participation,  by  deepening  sector  reforms  and \nunbundling sector activities; (ii) increased access to natural gas at affordable prices across the \ncountry;  and  (iii)  policy  and  institutional  measures  aimed  at  improving  energy  efficiency  in \ndistribution and promoting natural gas for transport. ADB\u2019s continued support for the gas sector \nunder  public  sector  financing  is  considered  crucial  to  (i)  maintaining  the  policy  dialogue  on \nstrengthening corporate governance, pricing reforms, and private sector participation; (ii) helping \nto expand the supply of natural gas to meet energy demand in less-developed areas while \nimproving the efficiency and safety of gas production, transmission, and distribution companies \nthat cannot access international financing; (iii) promoting good practices on environmental and \nsocial safeguards; and (iv) capacity building in the SGCs to improve their long-term planning and \nensure timely project implementation. \n  \n6.  Policy Dialogue \n12.  The policy dialogue during the preparation of the project led the government to adopt the \nGSRR, which sets out the plan for advancing the policy framework, regulatory instruments, sector \nplanning, access to natural gas, corporate governance, gas sector restructuring, and private \nsector participation. The government has progressed on these reform actions. The GSRR and its \nimplementation status are described in Appendix 2. The following paragraphs describe the key \nelements of the GSRR and the continuing policy dialogue. \n13.  National action plan for gas sector reform. Under the GSRR, a time-bound sector \nreform action plan, the government will (i) strengthen the policy formulation and monitoring system \nat the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD); (ii) adopt and implement the gas sector \nmaster plan for exploration, development, transmission, and distribution, including expanding the \nnetwork  to  less-developed  regions;  (iii) create  a  framework  for  monitoring  and  updating;  (iv) \nexecute  a  capacity-development  program  focusing  on  corporate  governance,  financial \nmanagement, and system management in gas sector entities; and (v) make the hydrocarbon unit \na permanent part of the EMRD to provide technical advice. \n14.  Legal and regulatory framework. A number of issues needed to be addressed to ensure \nsustained  gas  sector  growth.  These  include  (i)  the  EMRD  approving  upstream  gas  pricing \nguidelines, (ii) determining gas prices pursuant to these guidelines, and (iii) legally enforcing \nBERC tariff regulations for downstream activities. The BERC has started regulating the gas sector \nby licensing SGCs and issuing tariff orders. The gas act, which would ensure better regulation of \ngas infrastructure, was approved by the cabinet and is awaiting parliamentary approval.  \n ", "4   \n15.  Loss reduction. The overall gas system loss ranged from 4.5% to 6.5% from fiscal year \n(FY) 2000 to FY2005. This situation has improved in recent years, with average losses falling to \n1.3% and that of non-bulk supply to 2.8%. A comprehensive plan for improving efficiency and \nreducing system losses in the entire gas sector has been adopted for implementation under the \nGTDP. Further, the enactment of the proposed gas act under the GSRR will empower distribution \ncompanies to take legal action against fraud, theft, malpractice, and delinquent customers.  \n16.  Market-oriented gas pricing. There is a need to set gas tariffs in consideration of the \nremaining gas reserves, cost of network services, and need for significant investment in the gas \nsector. The adoption of the new pricing framework incorporating these principles will improve \nsector  entities\u2019  ability  to  cover  their  operating  expenses,  debt-servicing  liabilities,  and  future \ninvestment requirements. The EMRD will issue pricing policy guidelines to address these pricing \nissues. ADB is assisting the government in conducting a comprehensive gas pricing study to \nrefine these policy guidelines. \n  \n17.  Private sector participation. Future exploration and gas production will be undertaken \npredominantly  by  the  private  sector  through  production-sharing  contracts.  Private  sector \nparticipation  will  be  encouraged  in  the  construction  of  distribution  pipelines  and  associated \nfacilities  on  a  build\u2013own\u2013operate\u2013transfer  basis.  IOCs  will  be  encouraged  to  invest  in  gas \ntransmission facilities. A public\u2013private partnership model will be demonstrated in the installation \nand operation of Muchai gas compression station by an IOC to strengthen the gas transmission \nsystem. The government will approve a policy framework on private sector participation in existing \ngas distribution companies by December 2010. The newly formed distribution company, Sudarban \nGas Company Limited (SGCL), will sign contracts with private entities for operation, maintenance, \nmetering,  and  billing  from  the  start  of  its  operations.  Possible  models  for  private  sector \nparticipation in distribution are in Supplementary Appendix L. \n7.  Development Coordination \n18.  Assistance from major development partners is coordinated by the Economic Relations \nDivision of the Ministry of Finance, with the support of the EMRD. Coordination among the \ndevelopment partners is carried out through the local coordination group consisting of focused \nsubcommittees for core areas of assistance. As the leading development partner in energy, ADB \nchairs the energy subcommittee and holds regular meetings with all development partners. These \nefforts have greatly advanced sector reforms, improving the regulatory environment in particular. \nEnergy subcommittee meetings were held during fact-finding and appraisal missions to enlighten \ndevelopment  partners  on  progress.  The  energy  subcommittee  expressed  its  support  for  the \nproject.  During  bilateral  meetings,  the  World  Bank,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \n(JICA), and the Export\u2013Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) expressed their support. \n  \n19.  The other main development partners in the energy sector are JICA, KfW, the United \nStates Agency for International Development, and the World Bank. In the gas sector, ADB has \nprovided  public  sector  loans  of  $675  million  and  technical  assistance  grants  of  $5.4 million \ncovering gas exploration, production, transmission, distribution, and energy efficiency. Further \ndetails are in Appendix 3. \n8.  Rationale for the Project \n20.  The government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy emphasizes implementing policies to expand \nthe natural gas network to cover less-developed areas. The strategy will accelerate balanced \nregional  development  that  will  help  reduce  widespread  poverty.  The  project  aims  to  expand ", "       5 \n   \naccess to this main indigenous energy source in Bangladesh to meet increased demand for \nprimary commercial energy. \n21.  Early in 2009, the government approved the GSRR, which is now under implementation. It \nincludes strategies and actions to improve the policy, regulatory, and operational environment \ntoward ensuring the sustainability of the gas sector. The effective implementation of the GSRR is \ncritical to creating an environment conducive to better commercial orientation in the SGCs and to \nstronger private sector participation downstream in the gas sector. Further, as the capacity of the \nSGCs is not adequately developed to access international financing to meet their investment \nneeds, they need public financing. Under these conditions, fully implementing the GSRR relies \nheavily on continued ADB support, particularly for increasing supply efficiency and removing \ntransmission bottlenecks.  \n22.  The reinforcement of the transmission system with the compressors at Muchai, Ashuganj, \nand Elenga is essential to ensuring reliability and efficiency in gas delivery. Financing these \ncompressors was originally included in the scope of the ongoing GTDP. The cancellation of two \nbidding rounds delayed procurement. Finally, the delayed procurement could not be completed \nbecause funds under the GTDP were inadequate as costs escalated significantly above the cost \nestimates, owing to sharp increases in commodity prices. As the four components in the GTDP \nare independent, they are technically and economically viable as separate components. Therefore \nthe absence of the compressor component does not affect the technical or economic viability of \nthe remaining GTDP components.  \n23.  Because  of  the  urgency  and  critical  requirement  of  the  compressors  in  transmission \noperation, the government offered the installation of a compressor at Muchai to the private sector \nand  requested  ADB  to  fund  compressors  at Ashuganj  and  Elanga.  Network,  economic, and \nfinancial analyses confirmed the need for these compressors to strengthen transmission and their \nviability within the project. The cost estimates, technical specifications, and contract packaging of \nthe compressors have been carefully reviewed in light of recent experience to ensure maximum \ncompetition and rectify technical and procurement issues that arose under the GTDP. Recent \nstrengthening  of  procurement  oversight  at  the  ADB  resident  mission  has  improved  the \nprocurement  environment  through  on-site  advice  on  procurement  issues  and  quarterly \nprocurement  workshops  for  executing  agencies.  The  design  and  implementation  of \ncomprehensive executing agency training on wise procurement is planned. \n24.  The proposed physical investments are the most urgent components of the gas sector \ninvestment program. The subcomponents have been selected considering their financial and \neconomic  viability  and  their  social,  environmental,  and  poverty  reduction  impacts.  They  will \ncontribute to poverty reduction by making clean energy available in less-developed areas. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n25.  The impact of the project will be increased and more reliable access to natural gas, \nproviding  sustained  economic  growth  by  reinforcing  and  augmenting  natural gas  supply  and \naddressing policy and institutional constraints.  \n \n26.  The main outcome of the project will be expanded capacity and improved efficiency in \nnatural gas production, transmission, and distribution systems.  \n ", "6   \nB.  Outputs \n27.  The  outputs  of  the  project  will  comprise  three  investment  components\u2014in  gas \ntransmission, safety and supply efficiency improvement, and access improvement\u2014as well as a \nsupply-and-demand management component. The specific activities of the project are as follows:  \n(i)  Part A: Transmission capacity expansion. Two subcomponents will assist in \ntransmitting gas to consumption centers, including those in less-developed regions.  \n(a)  Part  A-1:  Ashuganj\u2013Bakhrabad  gas  transmission  loop-line.  The \nsubproject will construct a 30-inch gas loop pipeline running 61 km from \nAshuganj to Bakhrabad, with a throughput of 400 MMCFD, and install major \ntransmission\u2013distribution  interface  metering  and  regulating  stations  at \nselected locations such as Manohardi, Dewanbhog, Kutumbpur, Feni, and \nBarabkund.  \n(b)  Part A-2: Gas compressors at Ashuganj and Elenga. This subproject will \ninstall  a  compressor  at  Ashuganj  with  a  maximum  throughput  of  1,500 \nMMCFD  and  another  at  Elenga  with  a  maximum  throughput  of  500 \nMMCFD. \n(ii)  Part B: Safety and supply efficiency improvement in Titas gas field. The first \nsubproject  (part  B-1)  will  undertake  activities  to  improve  safety  at  existing \nproblematic  wells  in  Titas  field.  The  second subproject  (part  B-2)  will  improve \nsupply  efficiency  through  four  additional  appraisal-cum-development  wells  and \ninstall processing plants in Titas field to increase gas production by 120 MMCFD.  \n(iii)  Part  C:  Access  improvement  in  southwestern  region.  This  component  will \nconstruct 2-inch to 20-inch gas distribution pipelines of 845 km to provide gas to the \ndistricts of Kushtia, Jhenidah, Jessore, Khulna, and Bagerhat (including Mongla). \n(iv)  Part D: Supply and demand management. This component will establish gas \nmetering  at  consumer  connections  of  Titas  Gas  Transmission  and  Distribution \nCompany Limited (TGTDCL). Its scope will include installing prepaid meters for \ndomestic consumers4 and, for industrial consumers, replacing existing meters with \nremote sensing meters on a pilot basis. This component will assist in developing a \nportfolio of projects for improving energy efficiency. \n \n28.  All  the  project  components  include  capacity  building  in  the  form  of  training  and \nimplementation support. Training components entail carrying out an assessment of training needs \nin each executing agency, developing curricula, and conducting training programs. \nC.  Special Features \n29.  Private sector participation in distribution. The SGCL will start its operations in the \nsouthwest by late 2012. The policy framework for private sector participation in distribution and the \nrequired enabling environment will be in place by that time. The SGCL will set up five geographic \nbusiness units and enter into contracts with private entities for operation, maintenance, metering, \nand billing for supply to consumers from December 2012. \n \n                                                 \n4  Providing clean energy access to the poor is a key parameter in household selection supported by ADB's Energy for \nAll initiative. This pilot project is expected to be scaled up under a subsequent loan. ", "       7 \n   \n30.  Interface metering and regulating stations. The installation of interface metering and \nregulating stations will allow monitor the efficiency the transmission systems, assisting in loss \nreduction. The GTCL has established gas manifold stations but the metering devices are not \navailable or are inadequate to cope with the increased demand for gas supply at several manifold \nstations. The project will support the installation of additional meters to address these concerns. \n31.  Geographical focus and poverty reduction. The gas transmission component has three \ndistinct parts: to remove supply bottlenecks in the entire network, to improve gas flow, and to add \nan  extension  pipeline  to  meet  projected  demand  in  major  consumption  centers.  The  gas \ndistribution network will expand access to cleaner fuel in less-developed towns. These efforts will \nincrease  small-  and  medium-scale  industries\u2019  access  to  clean  fuel,  particularly  in  the  less-\ndeveloped southwest, increasing employment there.  \n32.  Air  quality  improvement.  The  project  will  support  the  use  of  natural  gas  in  power \ngeneration, industries, and transport. Also, it will promote the use of cleaner fuel in households. \nWider use of natural gas will improve ambient air quality in urban centers and household indoor air \nquality. The benefits from reduced greenhouse gas emissions will be significant.  \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n33.  The project is estimated to cost $542 million equivalent, comprising $311 million in foreign \nexchange and $231 million equivalent in local currency. The cost includes taxes and duties of \n$101 million. Physical and price contingencies amount to $55 million, and financing charges in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines and procedures amount to $41 million. The cost estimate by \ncomponent and subcomponent is summarized in Table 1, and detailed cost estimates are in \nAppendix 4.  \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta\nA.

Financing Plan \n34.  The government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $261 million from its ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) to finance parts A-2, B, and C. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, \nand other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements. The proceeds of the \nOCR loan will be re-lent to the executing agencies under subsidiary loan agreements with terms \nand conditions acceptable to ADB. The government has provided ADB with the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions and confirmed the choices were its own decision and not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n35.  Korea Eximbank is expected to provide a loan of up to $45 million equivalent on a parallel \nbasis for part A-1 of the project.5 The terms and conditions of the Korea Eximbank loan will be \ncovered  under  a  separate  agreement  between  Korea  Eximbank  and  the  government.  Korea \nEximbank will follow ADB safeguard policies and procedures when implementing this component.  \n36.  The government has requested another loan in various currencies in special drawing rights \nequivalent to $5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (the ADF loan) to finance part D. It \nwill have a repayment period of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of \n1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and other terms and conditions set forth in the \nloan and project agreements. The ADF loan will be re-lent to executing agencies under subsidiary \nloan agreements with terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. The financing plan is in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank (ordinary capital resources)  261    48 \nAsian Development Bank (Asian Development Fund)  5    1 \nExport\u2013Import Bank of Korea  45    8 \nGovernment of Bangladesh  231    43 \n  Total  542    100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n37.  The government has assured the timely availability of counterpart funds. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n38.  The GTCL will be the executing agency of part A, Bangladesh Gas Fields Company \nLimited  (BGFCL)  of  part  B,  the  SGCL  of  part  C,  and  the  TGTDCL  of  part  D.  Project \nimplementation will be undertaken and supervised by project management units set up in the \nexecuting  agencies.  The  Bangladesh  Oil,  Gas,  and  Mineral  Corporation  (Petrobangla),  the \nexecuting  agency  for  overall  coordination,  will  establish  a  project  coordination  unit.  These \narrangements are consistent with ADB's policy dialogue with the government, a key feature of \n                                                 \n5 Korea Eximbank will undertake its loan appraisal mission in March 2010. ", "       9 \n   \nwhich is the independence of gas sector companies. The implementation of each of the four \nproject components is independent. It is therefore important that primary responsibility for each of \nthe project components remain with executing agencies, with Petrobangla in a coordinating role \nonly. Project implementation arrangements are in Supplementary Appendix K. \n2.  Implementation Period \n39.  The project will be implemented over 5 years, including procurement and construction. It is \nenvisaged that implementation will begin on 01 July 2010 and be completed by 31 March 2015. \nThe implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n3.  Procurement \n40.  All procurement financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive bidding \nprocedures will be used for all 11 procurement packages financed by ADB (5 turnkey and 6 supply \ncontracts), of which 7 packages (4 turnkey and 3 supply contracts) will follow the single-stage, \ntwo-envelope  procedure;  3  packages  (3  supply  contracts  for  gas  seepage  control  and  field \nappraisal)  will  follow  the  single-stage,  one-envelope  procedure;  and  the  remaining  turnkey \ncontract  for  procurement  of  gas  turbine  compressor  stations  will  follow  the  two-stage,  two-\nenvelope procedure. The procurement plan is indicated in Appendix 6. \n41.  The  government,  Petrobangla,  and  the  executing  agencies  have  requested  ADB's \napproval for advance contracting for the procurement of works, goods, and services. Retroactive \nfinancing of up to $500,000 has been requested for consulting services to support the BGFCL in \nits identification and recommendation of remedial actions regarding gas seepage, drilling wells, \nand installing gas processing plants. ADB management has approved advance contracting for \nprocurement and consulting services, as well as retroactive financing for consulting services for \nthe BGFCL of up to $500,000, provided that expenditures are in accordance with the ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and safeguard policies and are incurred during the 12 months before the signing of the \nloan agreement. The government, Petrobangla, and the executing agencies have been informed \nthat approval of advance contracting or retroactive financing does not in any way commit ADB to \nfinance the project. They have also been informed that ADB will not finance expenditures paid by \nthe  borrower  prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  even  if  advance  contracting  is  approved,  unless \nretroactive financing has been approved by ADB. \n4.  Consulting Services \n42.  Two consulting services for part A will be required to help the GTCL implement (i) the \ninstallation of interface metering and regulating stations and the supervisory control and data \nacquisition  system  and  (ii)  the  construction  of  gas  turbine  compressor  stations.  Consulting \nservices  for  parts  B  and  D  will  be  required  to  (i)  support  the  BGFCL  in  identifying  and \nrecommending  remedial  actions  regarding  gas  seepage,  drilling  wells,  and  installing  gas \nprocessing plants and (ii) assist the TGTDCL in project implementation and developing a portfolio \nof projects to improve energy efficiency. Four consulting services for international training are \nenvisaged for capacity development in the GTCL, BGFCL, SGCL, and TGTDCL. Consultants will \nbe engaged as firms. Seven consulting firms will be engaged for parts A-2, B, C, and D, with part \nA-1 financed by Korea Eximbank. \n \n ", "10   \n43.  All  consultants  except  those  in  Part  A-1  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Consultants will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s \nquality- and cost-based selection procedure, applying the standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. Full \ntechnical proposals will be required from bidders for all consulting services for parts A and B, while \nthe others will use biodata technical proposals (Appendix 6). Details of consulting services are in \nSupplementary Appendix J. \n5.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n44.  The  government  aims  to  create  a  corruption-free  environment  and  established  the \nAnticorruption  Commission  in  2004.  ADB  has  provided  technical  assistance  to  help  the \ngovernment build capacity and provide support for an integrated anticorruption strategy.6 ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment  and  executing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant \nregulations and the bidding documents for the project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB \nin connection with the project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  executing  agencies  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the project. Table 3 summarizes major \nproject-specific governance measures. \n \n45.  The government will ensure that the GTCL, BGFCL, SGCL, TGTDCL, Petrobangla, and \nother gas sector entities have operational autonomy and that no organizational changes that \nwould affect their ability to perform their obligations under the project are carried out. \n \n \nTable 3: Governance Measures \nArea  Measure \nProcurement  (i)  Project management units headed by senior officers reporting directly to the managing \ndirectors of the executing agencies  \n(ii)  Bid specifications and packaging to be prepared to ensure maximum competition \nunder international competitive bidding procedures \n(iii) Information on procurement to be disclosed on a project website \n(iv) Procurement capacity support at the resident mission for expedited action on \nprocurement issues \nFinancial  (i)   Measurable financial performance indicators for the executing agencies  \nmanagement \n(ii)  Regular monitoring of expenditures, other financial transactions, and safe custody of \nand audit \nproject-financed assets by the accounting and control systems of the executing \nagencies  \n(iii) Scoped internal audit of the executing agencies ensured to include revenue audit and \ninternal audit reports to the audit committee of the executing agency boards \n(iv) Financial statements to be audited by external auditors acceptable to ADB and \nregularly published and reported to the shareholders \n(v)  Executing agencies to provide an accurate accounting of losses \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2003.

Disbursement Arrangements \n46.  The disbursement of loan funds under the project will be mainly for goods and consulting \nservices. ADB\u2019s commitment letter and direct payment procedures will be utilized. Disbursement \nprocedures will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Statement of expenditure procedures may be used for reimbursement under all \nproject components. The statement of expenditure ceiling will be $100,000 for individual payments \napplicable to reimbursement procedures.  \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n47.  The executing agencies receiving proceeds from the ADB loans will each maintain a \nseparate account for the project and submit audited financial statements within at least 6 months \nafter the end of the fiscal year. Annual project accounts and annual financial statements will be \naudited by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, providing the auditors\u2019 observations with \nrespect to the use of loan proceeds and compliance with loan covenants. They will prepare \nseparate  progress  reports  for  their  respective  components.  Petrobangla  will  consolidate  the \nreports and submit to ADB quarterly within 1 month of the end of each quarter. Each report will \ndescribe the progress made, any changes to the implementation schedule, problems encountered \nand remedial actions taken, the performance of the consultants, and the work to be carried out in \nthe upcoming period. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB within 3 months of the \ncompletion of the project. The use of statement of expenditure will be part of the annual audit, as \nwill a separate opinion on the use of statement of expenditure. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n48.  A project performance monitoring system will be established to assess the progress and \nimplementation of the project and to measure impacts and outcomes. A set of indicators for \nevaluating project performance in relation to its goals, purposes, outputs, and conditions will be \n ", "12   \ndeveloped. The indicators will include (i) economic development and poverty indicators in the \nproject areas, (ii) energy indicators for the region and the project areas, (iii) gas tariffs, (iv) the \nfinancial sustainability of the SGCs, (v) access to social services in the project area, (vi) jobs \ncreated in the construction and maintenance of the project, and (vii) environmental and social \nindicators including compliance with the national labor laws and equal access for women to \nemployment opportunities. At the beginning of project implementation, the SGCs will establish \nbaseline and target values for the indicators. The indicators will be measured at project completion \nand 3 years later for comparison with the baseline. A report summarizing the key findings of \nmonitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later will be submitted to ADB. \n9.  Project Review \n49.  The project will be supervised by ADB through at least two review missions each year. \nADB will monitor the implementation of the project through quarterly progress reports. In addition \nto the normal periodic reviews, ADB and the government will undertake a midterm review 2 years \nafter project implementation begins. The midterm review will include a detailed evaluation of the \nproject  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  consultation  with  affected  people, \nachievement of scheduled targets, progress on policy reforms, and capacity building. \n  \nIV.

The financial management assessment, conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects during project preparation, is in Supplementary Appendix \nC. Petrobangla is upgrading its human resource systems to improve procedures and training.7 \nAccounting and management information systems are satisfactory for the Petrobangla group of \ncompanies. Petrobangla will provide accounting and billing systems and training to the SGCL. \nWith the assistance of the World Bank, the GTCL is upgrading its accounting and management \ninformation  systems  to  improve  management  operations.  Financial  management  assessment \nfound the proposed project financial management arrangements to be satisfactory. \n2.  Past Financial Performance and Future Projections \n51.  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited.  Mainly  because  of  increases  in  transmission \nvolume, revenues from gas transmission resulted in an increase in net profit from Tk424 million in \nFY2004 to Tk2,614 million in FY2008. The rate of return (ROR) on net fixed assets increased \nsteadily over the period to reach 15.1% in FY2008, half again the covenanted ROR of 10.0%, and \nthe debt service ratio (DSR) exceeded 1.2 times. Accounts receivable have exceeded 3 months of \nsales since FY2001. However, they do not translate into bad debts, as the GTCL is paid by \nPetrobangla once payment is received from distribution companies. \n52.  Forecasts  of  gas  transferred  by  the  GTCL  are  based  on  Petrobangla\u2019s  August  2008 \ndemand\u2013supply projections. The financial projections assume that the GTCL wheeling charge \nincreases so that the ROR covenant of 10% is met. Accordingly the wheeling charge needs to \nincrease to Tk0.64 per cubic meter by the beginning of FY2012. This also allows the DSR of 1.2 to \nbe met over the forecast period to FY2020. \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. ", "       13 \n   \n53.  Bangladesh  Gas  Fields  Company  Limited.  Revenues  from  gas  production  at  the \nprescribed production margin have steadily increased, with net profit reaching Tk1,055 million in \nFY2004 and declining to Tk993 million in FY2005 and Tk865 million in FY2006, before recovering \nto Tk999 million in FY2007. It declined to Tk794 million in FY2008 because of higher maintenance \ncosts. The ROR reached 26.7% in FY2005 but declined to 16.7% in FY2008. The DSR is well in \nexcess of 1.2 times debt obligations.  \n54.  Forecast gas and condensate volumes are based on Petrobangla\u2019s August 2008 supply\u2013\ndemand projections. The BGFCL derives its revenue from the production of gas, for which it \nreceives a wellhead margin of Tk0.225 per cubic meter, and the sale of gas condensate and \nrefined  products  based  on  international  petroleum  prices.  On  this  basis,  the  projections \ndemonstrate that a DSR of 1.2 and the historic ROR in excess of 12% will be achieved through \n2020.  \n55.  Sundarban Gas Company Limited. SGCL is a new company formed to distribute gas in \nthe Khulna area and towns adjacent to the new transmission pipeline to Khulna. SGCL gas sales \nprojections for 2012\u20132020 (phase 1) are based on Petrobangla forecasts and in particular the \nsupply of gas to an existing 360 megawatt (MW) power plant in Khulna and a proposed 360 MW \nplant at Bheramara. Operating costs for the distribution company are based on October 2008 \nestimates made in the DPP prepared by the Dakhshin Paschimanchal Gas Bitoran Prokalpa \nBastabayan Unit of Petrobangla and the operating costs of the Pashchimanchal Gas Company \nLimited (another newly formed company), which operates in the western part of the country. The \nprojections show that the SGCL would maintain a DSR exceeding 1.2 in all years through 2020. \n \n56.  Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited. The TGTDCL is the oldest \ngas distribution and marketing company of the country, with a franchise area extending over the \narea east of the Jamuna\u2013Padma river system, excluding Sylhet and Chittagong divisions but \nincluding Brahmanbari. Its revenues from gas sales have been increasing by approximately 20% \nper annum, and the net profit in FY2008 reached Tk4,218 million. That year, the ROR on net fixed \nassets reached 37.3%, and the DSR exceeded 1.2 times debt obligations. Forecast gas sales are \nbased on the Petrobangla's supply\u2013demand projections. The TGTDCL derives its revenue mainly \nfrom its gas sales and wheeling charges. On this basis the projections demonstrate that a DSR of \n1.2 and the historic ROR in excess of 12% will be achieved through 2020. \n \n57.  The past and projected financial performance of the executing agencies is detailed in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n3.  Financial Viability \n58.   The financial evaluation of the project was carried out in accordance with the Guidelines \nfor the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB.8 The \nanalysis was carried out for (i) pipeline extensions, (ii) existing system reinforcement, and (iii) the \noverall system including expansions and extensions. For the field appraisal and development \ncomponent, no financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was calculated, as the investment is meant \nto more clearly delineate gas structures to determine possible increases in reserves that have \nfuture economic benefit. Financial analysis was undertaken in real terms using 2009 prices. The \nwithout-project and with-project scenarios were compared. Without the project, gas shortages in \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. \nManila. \n ", "14   \nBangladesh would continue. With the project, gas from northeast Bangladesh would be available \nto meet shortages in the existing gas supply area and supply new market areas in the southwest.  \n 59.  The  transmission  component  has  an  FIRR  of  9.6%  after  taxes,  and  the  distribution \ncomponent 5.5%. These compare favorably with the weighted average cost of capital of 2.7% for \nthe transmission component and 1.8% for the distribution component. Sensitivity analysis was \nconducted for 10% increases in capital and operating and maintenance costs, a 10% reduction in \nproject benefits, and a combination of these factors together with project delays. Sensitivity and \nrisk analyses show that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions and the project is financially \nviable. A summary of the project\u2019s financial evaluation is in Appendix 7. Considering the nature of \nproject  activities,  such  as  arresting  natural  gas  seepage  from  problematic  wells  and  energy \nefficiency  improvements,  there  can  be  opportunities  for  financial  benefits  under  the  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. The government and the executing agencies will \npursue such opportunities to further strengthen financial viability.  \n4.  Economic Viability \n60.  Demand analysis. Future gas demand was analyzed for the area covered by the existing \npipeline system. Forecast gas sales for the existing network area provided the basis for estimating \nincreased volumes and benefits from network reinforcement. The analysis assumed that the \npresent network would not be adequate to meet demand beyond 2013 level and that higher gas \nsales would be owing entirely to investment in the network.  \n61.  Least-cost analysis. The network analysis has been validated for the entire system, and \nchanging any one element may affect the entire system. However, between any two points, \ncompressors or looping alternatives can be compared. The planned investment program is based \non numerous simulations to identify the locations of bottlenecks as throughput increases and to \nremove those bottlenecks with compressors or looping. For all compressor locations identified as \nbottlenecks, costs of the pipeline looping alternative were estimated.  \n62.  Economic rate of return. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for \nthe project, considering capital costs and operation and maintenance costs. Conversion factors \nwere used to convert financial values into economic values. Values are expressed in mid-2009 \nprices. The main economic benefits of the project is the value of future imported petroleum fuels \nand  other  energy  sources  displaced  by  gas  and  growth  in  demand  from  new  and  existing \ncustomers. The EIRR computed for the entire project is 32%, assuming annual average gas \nsupply of 80% of the maximum daily demand (Appendix 8). Sensitivity and risk analyses on \nadverse  scenarios  showed  the  project  EIRR  to  be  stable  and  robust.  More  details  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n \nB.  Social Assessment and Resettlement \n1.  Poverty Assessment \n63.  The social, poverty, and development impacts of the project have been analyzed. The \nexpansion of the gas transmission network to consumption centers and the construction of the \ndistribution network in the southwest will bring significant benefits to people. The project\u2019s impacts \ncan be classified as production, income, employment, habitat, health and safety, quality of life, \nsociety and organization, poverty, gender, environment, and pricing.  ", "       15 \n   \n64.  The project employed participatory preparation, and stakeholder consultation will continue \nduring  implementation.  As  the  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  did  not  identify  any \ncommunities of indigenous people that would be affected, no indigenous peoples development \nplan is needed.  \n65.  The project will reduce poverty in the project areas. The poverty analysis carried out during \nproject preparation found income likely to increase with new opportunities that are expected to \nopen up and increased employment arising from economic diversification. Income growth for the \npoor will come from (i) expanded off-farm economic activities; (ii) growth in agricultural income \nmainly from cheaper fertilizer and irrigation; (iii) expanded markets and institutions with wider \navailability of gas and electricity; (iv) time saved that can be devoted to other income-earning \npursuits, particularly by women; and (v) the low cost of natural gas compared with other sources \nof energy. Non-income poverty can be reduced by (i) controlling the depletion of forest resources \nand reducing health risks, (ii) empowering women through new income opportunities, and (iii) \nestablishing social infrastructure that will provide better services. The project will create 3,000 \nperson-months of unskilled employment. A summary of the poverty and social strategy is in \nAppendix 9. \n2.  Resettlement \n66.  Under part A, implementation will require the acquisition and requisition of land on the \nright-of-way of the gas transmission pipeline. The central 8 meters will be permanently acquired, \nwhile the remaining 15 meters will be requisitioned for the duration of the civil works. In full \nconsultation with affected people and communities, a full resettlement plan was prepared to \nmitigate impacts. The GTCL has undertaken efforts to minimize adverse impacts. The corridor \nwas chosen to pass through agricultural land to avoid settlements and homesteads. The GTCL \nwill ensure that civil works are completed during the dry season to avoid disrupting crops on the \ntemporarily acquired land. The survey indicates that the construction and installation of the 61 km \nof gas pipeline will require the permanent acquisition of 50.65 hectares (ha) and the temporary \nacquisition of 105.76 ha. A total of 1,992 households will be affected by permanent acquisition, \nand 2,185 households will be affected by the temporary acquisition, for a total of 10,956 affected \npeople.  \n \n67.  Under part B, implementation will require the acquisition of 7.086 ha of mostly agricultural \nland, affecting 178 households. Of these, 113 households will permanently lose 6.26 ha of land, 3 \nhouseholds will lose residential property, and 4 households will lose 175 trees. The remaining \n58 households are currently affected by gas seepage that costs them access to 1.51 ha. These \naffected people will benefit from the implementation of the project, as they will regain access to \ntheir land, but they have been added to the resettlement plan as they will be compensated for \nincome  lost  to  seepage.  In  full  consultation  with  affected  people  and  communities,  a  full \nresettlement plan was prepared to provide appropriate mitigation. \n \n68.  Under part C, the project sites were selected and the components were designed to \nminimize impacts by avoiding involuntary land acquisition and displacement and by confining the \nproject to land already available to the government or the GTCL. Although no titled landholders \nwill be affected, nine households (five in Khulna and four in Jessore) comprising 52 people (mainly \nsquatters)  will  be  temporarily  affected  for  a  maximum  of  1  week  and  will  therefore  require \ncompensation. A detailed survey of 100% of the affected people was conducted in June 2009. \nNine informal commercial structures will be temporarily affected. In full consultation with affected \npeople and communities, a short resettlement plan was prepared to assist the nine affected \nhouseholds.   \n ", "16   \n \n69.  The executing agencies continue to disclose resettlement plan information to affected \npeople  through  various  means  including  pamphlets,  brochures,  and newspapers  in  the  local \nlanguage. All resettlement plans were submitted to ADB in July 2009. The government assured \nthe ADB mission that compensation to all affected people will be paid according to the ADB \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property \nOrdinance of 1982 and subsequent amendments to it\u2014and that full compensation will be awarded \nprior to the physical takeover of land acquired temporarily or permanently. In addition, temporarily \nacquired land will be restored to at least its pre-acquisition condition. Summary resettlement plans \nare in Appendix 10. The full resettlement plans are in Supplementary Appendixes H and I. \n \n70.  As 100% of the affected people were surveyed and no indigenous households will be \naffected  by  the  project,  the  project  was  classified  category  C,  and  no  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan is required. \nC.  Environmental Analysis  \n71.  The executing agencies have prepared initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for all \ncomponents following ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and the government\u2019s environmental \nimpact assessment guidelines for industries, as well as national policies and legislation. They \nidentify  the  potential  impacts  and  their  severity  and  duration.  The  IEEs  provide  mitigating \nmeasures for the impacts and a monitoring plan. The IEEs show that the proposed project \ninfrastructure will traverse farmland, rural areas, peri-urban areas, and secondary cities. It will not \npass  through  any  socially,  archeologically,  or  ecologically  sensitive  areas.  In  addition,  most \nimpacts  will  be  temporary  and  have  no  lasting  effect  if  mitigating  measures  outlined  in  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  are  followed.  The  summary  IEE  (SIEE)  for  the  project  in \nSupplementary Appendix E highlights the findings of the IEEs. and additional information and \nactivities included during the ADB review process.  The IEEs will be updated and approved to be \nin line with the SIEE. The project is environment category B, so a full environmental impact \nassessment  is  not  required.  Before  the  commencement  of  construction,  the  environmental \nmanagement  plans  for  each  subprojects  will  be  detailed  in  the  project-specific  context  and \nincluded in construction contracts. \nD.  Expected Benefits \n72.  The project will expand access to gas in less-developed areas of the country to achieve \nbalanced regional development and augment transmission capacity in southern industrial areas. \nThis will save foreign exchange spent on fuel imports and positively affect the environment and \nhealth, particularly of women and the poor, who are most vulnerable to smoke from cooking fires. \nAn estimated 200,000 additional households will have access to new gas connections in the \nsouthwest. \n73.  An additional 1,400 industrial and commercial establishments and 35 compressed natural \ngas filling stations will have access to gas because of part C of the project. The industries will \ninclude small fertilizer plants, jute mills, ceramic factories, dyeing and finishing factories, textile \nweaving  factories,  and  small  cottage  industries.  Commercial  entities  will  include  hotels, \nrestaurants, and bakeries. These industrial and commercial installations will generate significant \nemployment.  A  poverty  analysis  showed  that  incomes  are  likely  to  increase  with  new \nopportunities, including those resulting from economic diversification. Project implementation will \ndirectly create 3,000 person-months of unskilled employment. ", "       17 \n   \n74.  All technical studies indicate that Bangladesh has adequate gas reserves to meet its \nrequirements. Network analysis demonstrates constraints in the existing gas supply network. The \nleast-cost  analysis  shows  that  overcoming  those  network  constraints  will  require  installing \ncompressors at selected transmission points and looping transmission lines. To address these \nnetwork  constraints,  the  project  will  install  compression  facilities  at  Ashuganj  and  Muchai.9 \nTogether they will augment throughput by 1,500 MMCFD by 2015 with adequate supplies from \ngas fields. The compressor facility at Ashuganj under the project will also increase supplies to the \ncentral  regions.  An  additional  loop-line  and  compressor  at  Elenga  will  be  installed  to  allow \nadequate supply to the western region. These improvements will enable the project design to \nserve for the natural gas system for over 25 years. \nE.  Risks and Safeguards \n75.  Policy reforms. The main potential policy risk is failure or delay in introducing the required \nreforms and restructuring. ADB will maintain policy dialogue with the government on these issues. \nThis risk has been mitigated by introducing assurances to promote the acceleration of reforms, the \nquality of the reform content, and the sustainability of implementation. It addresses this risk by \napproaching difficult issues incrementally. \n76.  Cofinancing. Korea Eximbank cofinancing is expected for part A-1 of the project under \nparallel, tied financing. In the unlikely event that Korea Eximbank financing is not forthcoming, part \nA-1  will  likely  be  excluded  from  the  project  scope.  This  would  not  affect  the  viability  or \nimplementation of the remaining components, as  each is independent.  \n77.  Implementation risks. The project is subject to risks common to projects of such size and \ncomplexity.  The  project  has  been  designed  to  mitigate  policy  and  institutional  risks.  The \nsubprojects are not subject to any unusual technical and commercial risks. They involve financially \nsound SGCs and technically and commercially proven technologies. Cost overruns and delays in \nimplementation  are  major  potential  risks.  The  economic  impacts  of  the  subprojects  are  less \nsensitive to cost overruns and more sensitive to delays in implementation, but the basic economic \nreturns remain sound. The potential risks in project implementation include front-end delays. \nMeasures have been incorporated in the project design to reduce these risks. \n78.  Good governance. The project\u2019s design includes measures to promote good governance \nand mitigate the risk of corruption. These include disclosing project and procurement-related \ninformation  on  a  project  website  and  preparing  bid  specifications  and  packaging  to  ensure \nmaximum competition under international competitive bidding. The executing agencies will benefit \nfrom the presence of a procurement specialist stationed at the resident mission to identify and \nproactively address procurement issues at an early stage. The procurement specialist will support \ncapacity enhancement among executing agency staff through regular meetings and customized \ntraining sessions on ADB procurement processes. \n \n79.  Project readiness. Delays in project implementation in the gas sector have been a major \nconcern, frequently caused by lack of project readiness. Considering this, the government and the \nexecuting agencies have taken mitigation measures. These include advanced preparation and \napproval of the DPPs, as well as environmental and social safeguard documents. The preparation \nof  bidding  documents  for  goods  and  services  has  been  undertaken  before  loan  approval. \n                                                 \n9  Supply constraint will be partly addressed by the installation of gas compressors at Muchai by the private sector, to be \noperated in the public sector after cost recovery. \n ", "18   \nMeasures have been incorporated in the project design to reduce delays by allowing advance \nprocurement, retroactive financing, and advisory support for implementation.  \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n80.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n1.  Policy and Regulatory Environment  \n81.  The government will continue implementing the GSRR to ensure optimal development of \nthe gas sector. \n82.  The government will formulate and approve the revised gas pricing policy by 31 December \n2010. The EMRD will adopt a formula in the revised pricing policy for determining upstream gas \nprices for the state gas companies based on the cost of future supply taking into account the price \nof international gas supplies and possible alternative fuels.  \n83.  Gas sector companies will directly lodge separate tariff applications annually with the \nBERC from 31 December 2010. \n \n84.  The  EMRD  will  approve  the  policy  framework  for  private  sector  participation  in  the \noperation, maintenance, marketing, and billing processes of gas distribution companies, by 30 \nJune 2011. \n2.  Efficiency Improvement \n85.  Gas  distribution  companies  will  start  accounting  for  energy  losses  based  on  actual \nmetered consumption instead of losses based on billed consumption by 30 June 2011, and the \ncompanies will continue to maintain system losses below 2%.  \n \n3.  Financial Performance and Governance \n86.  From the commencement of its operations, the SGCL shall install consumer meters for all \nhousehold connections and introduce metering for all industrial consumers within its franchise \narea and bill its consumers exclusively on the basis of metered consumption.  \n87.  Petrobangla shall develop a human resources strategy for the entire Petrobangla group \nthat  encourages  recruitment  through  transparent  and  competitive  procedures  and  that  links \npromotions and salary increases to market benchmarks and individual performance. Petrobangla \nshall ensure that the implementation of the revised strategy commences from 1 January 2011. \n \n88.  With  immediate  effect,  the  SCGL  shall  recruit  permanent  staff  to  assist  in  the \nimplementation of part C and later to operate the project facilities thus established upon their \ncompletion.  \n \n89.  The GTCL and the TGTDCL shall continue to recruit their management including at least \nmanaging director, director (finance), and director (operations) on a competitive and a transparent \nbasis through open advertisements in the press, and fill any vacancies within six months after they \noccur.  Further, the existing vacancies shall be filled expeditiously.    ", "       19 \n   \n \n90.  In consultation with ADB, EMRD will prepare a time-bound action plan by 30 June 2011 to \nredefine Petrobangla's role and restructure Petrobangla to promote sustainable development of \nthe gas sector.  \n \n91.  The government will cause to be ensured that (i) the GTCL and the BGFCL will continue to \nhave a debt service coverage ratio of 1.2 and (ii) the SGCL will have ratio of 1.2 from 2012.  \n4.  Private Sector Participation \n92.  The  SGCL  will  have  entered  into  contractual  arrangements  with  private  entities  for \noperation, maintenance, marketing, and billing for gas distribution upon commencement of its \noperations. \n93.  The EMRD will closely monitor progress in the installation of gas compressor station at \nMuchai and its successful operation by the private sector to ensure augmenting gas supply to the \ntransmission  network.  The  EMRD  will  keep  ADB  regularly  informed  of  developments  in  this \nregard. \n \n5.  Land Acquisition, Resettlement, and Social Issues \n94.  The  government  and  the  executing  agencies  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement  plans, \nincluding compensation and entitlements for affected households and persons, are implemented \nin conformity with all applicable laws and regulations of the government,and the entitlement \nbenefits as listed in the applicable laws and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995).  \n \n95.   Prior to land acquisition and any resettlement for the project, the resettlement plans, \nincluding any updates based on consensus of the affected persons, must be disclosed with all \nnecessary information made available to persons affected by the project and confirm that it be \nuploaded onto the ADB website.  \n \n96.   Within 6 months of the effective date, the borrower and the executing agencies shall \ndevelop and agree upon an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention and sensitization program \nacceptable to ADB. The executing agencies shall cause contractors to implement the program \namong the contractors' employees for the duration of the contract. The borrower, through the \nproject management units, shall monitor the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention and \nsensitization program. \n97.   The bidding documents for the civil works contracts must include specific provisions to \nensure that the contractors (a) comply with applicable core labor standards, labor laws and \nincorporate applicable workplace occupational safety norms; (b) do not differentiate payment \nbetween men and women or between people from different castes for work of equal value (c) do \nnot employ child labor; (d) eliminate forced or compulsory labor; (e) eliminate discrimination in \nrespect of employment; and (f) to the extent possible, maximize employment of local poor and \ndisadvantaged persons for construction purposes, provided that the requirements for efficiency \nare adequately met.  \n \n  6.   Environmental Issues \n98.  The government, through the executing agencies, will ensure that the design, construction, \nand  operation  of  all  project  facilities  comply  with  the  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of \n ", "20   \nBangladesh and ADB\u2019s environmental policies and regulations, specifically ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002) and environmental mitigating measures and the environmental management plans \ndescribed in the IEEs and in the summary IEE conducted for the project.  \nB.  Conditions  \n99.  In addition to the standard loan effectiveness conditions, for the loan to be effective, (i)  the \nBERC gas transmission and gas distribution tariff regulations shall have entered into force;,and (ii) \nthe subsidiary loan agreements between the government and the executing agencies, in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, shall have become effective and binding on the government and \nthe executing agencies in accordance with their terms. \n \n100.  The government shall ensure that the EAs will not award any works contracts financed \nunder  the  loans  until  they  have  updated  the  IEEs  in  line  with  the  SIEE  and  the  resulting \namendments have been approved by the government, the EAs and ADB \n \nVI.

The Bangladesh Oil, Gas, and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) coordinates the gas \nsector in Bangladesh, while the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) of the Ministry \nof Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources provides policy direction. Petrobangla carries out its \ngas  business  through  nine  operating  companies:  Bangladesh  Petroleum  Exploration  and \nProduction Company Limited, engaged in exploration and production; Bangladesh Gas Fields \nCompany  Limited  (BGFCL)  and  Sylhet  Gas  Fields  Limited,  both  involved  in  gas  field \ndevelopment  and  production;  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited  (GTCL),  involved  in \ntransmission; Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited (TGTDCL), Bakhrabad \nGas Systems Limited (BGSL), Jalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution System Limited, \nand Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited, all involved in transmission and/or distribution; and \nRupantarita Prakritik Gas Company Limited, involved in liquefied petroleum gas production and \ncompressed  natural  gas  marketing.  The  TGTDCL,  the  oldest  and  largest,  operates  in  the \nfranchise area of Dhaka Division (excluding greater Faridpur District) and Brahmanbaria District. \nThe BGSL serves the market in Chittagong Division excluding Brahmanbaria District. Jalalabad \nGas Transmission and Distribution System Limited serves the market in Sylhet Division, while \nPashchimanchal Gas Company Limited operates in the franchise area in Rajshahi Division. A \nnew company, Sundarban Gas Company Limited (SGCL), is being established to distribute gas \nin the southwest. These state gas companies (SGCs) have been incorporated as public limited \ncompanies under the Companies Act, 1913 (amended in 1994). The organization chart of \nPetrobangla is in Supplementary Appendix A. The upstream gas sector is regulated by the \ngovernment. The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), established in 2004, is \nthe regulator for downstream activities in the gas sector, including gas tariff determination. \n2.  Natural  gas  can  provide  most  of  the  current  and  future  energy  requirements  in \nBangladesh, and the gas market needs to be expanded to optimize the use of natural gas \nresources and support economic development. Although Bangladesh has produced natural gas \nfor over 3 decades, all of its major fields are underdeveloped and have not been properly \ndelineated. There are widely varying assessments of the country\u2019s natural gas reserves. The \ndiscovered reserves are those that have been confirmed by drilling and reliable geological \nmapping.  Undiscovered  reserves  are  yet  to  be  confirmed  by  drilling  and  therefore  have \nuncertainty and risk attached to them, depending on the assumed recovery factor that reflects \nthe probability of the resources becoming at least equal to the estimated level.1 \n3.  The opening up of natural gas exploration and production to international oil companies \n(IOCs) in the 1990s through production-sharing contracts has contributed to improved gas \nsupply in recent years. Total proven recoverable gas reserves in Bangladesh from 23 fields (19 \nin the public sector and 4 in the private sector) are estimated at 20.60 trillion cubic feet (TCF), of \nwhich 7.68 TCF has so far been consumed. The current net recoverable reserve stands at \n12.95 TCF. Out of 23 gas fields, 17 have so far been brought under production and 14 are \ncurrently under production.2 Production from the remaining three fields was suspended for \ntechnical reasons. However, these three fields (Chhatak, Kamta, and Feni) appear to have the \npotential to produce further with added efforts, and IOCs are participating in redeveloping two of \nthem. The total of proved and probably recoverable reserves not now in production amounts to \nmore than 4.00 TCF, of which 3.00 TCF was discovered in post production-sharing contract \nareas. The largest field is Bibiyana, with estimated recoverable reserves of more than 2.40 TCF. \n                                                 \n1  When using probabilistic methods in resource estimation, the terms proven, probable, and possible are used. \nProved (1P) means 90% probability; proved and probable (2P) means 50% probability; and proved, probable, and \npossible (3P) means 10% probability.  \n2  Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company Limited recently discovered a gas field at Srikail, \nwhich is under investigation. ", "24   Appendix 2 \nA study by the hydrocarbon unit estimates that there is a 90% probability that undiscovered \nresources will be at least 19.00 TCF (1P) and could go up to 42.00 TCF at 50% probability (2P). \nTaking the discovered and undiscovered reserves together, there is a 90% probability that \nBangladesh\u2019s gas reserves exceed 30.00 TCF.  \n4.  Though IOC production has already reached 50% of the national total, Petrobangla \npredicts that over the next 12 years, IOC production will comprise 30%\u201345% of supply, with the \nbalance from SGCs. SGCs will drill 43 wells in the next 12 years at a cost of $266 million and \nrequire an additional $84 million for gas treatment plants. The IOCs will be required to invest \n$275 million. Definitive contractual gas supply and investment commitments have been made, \nand international financial resources are sufficient to fulfill these commitments. \n5.  Petrobangla recently revised its forecast of gas demand and supply through 2020. Gas \nconsumption rose from 365 billion cubic feet (BCF) in fiscal year (FY) 2001 to 690 BCF in \nFY2009, for a compound average annual growth rate of 7.3%. The highest consumption growth \nrate was in the non-bulk category, with an average growth rate over the period of 23%. The non-\nbulk  category  comprises  industry,  commerce,  households,  tea,  brick  field  (seasonal),  and \ncompressed natural gas (CNG). In FY2006, industrial consumers accounted for 49% of the non-\nbulk category and households 40%. Between FY1999 and FY2007, average annual growth \nrates in consumption were 12.4% for industry and 16.3% for households. The high rate of \ngrowth in domestic consumption can be attributed to rapid construction growth and rural\u2013urban \nmigration and scarcity of alternative cheaper fuel for domestic use. CNG recorded phenomenal \ngrowth during FY2003\u2013FY2008 going from 0.003 BCF in FY2003 to 24.2 BCF in FY2008. \nGovernment initiatives to arrest air pollution by encouraging the use of indigenous natural gas, \nincreasing  the  prices  of  alternative  fuels  for  automobiles,  increasing  the  number  of  CNG-\npowered vehicles, and expanding multiple uses of indigenous natural gas have been major \ncontributors to the rapid increase in CNG consumption. Growth in gas consumption to produce \nelectricity was 1.5% over the period, and for fertilizer \u20136.5%. \n \n6.  The gas demand forecast revised by Petrobangla reflects supply constraints. The overall \ngrowth rate assumed in the forecast is 7.3%, the same as the historic growth rate for 2002\u2013\n2008.  Even  at  the  current  level  of  consumption,  remaining  recoverable  reserves  will  be \nexhausted in 20 years; with a 6% growth rate, the remaining recoverable reserves will last about \n13 years. Given the current reserve status and anticipated shortfall in meeting growing demand, \ngreat care must be taken in committing new gas usage in less-productive sectors. \n \n7.  To meet growing demand and overcome production and transmission deficiencies, \nlarge-scale investments in exploration, field development, and transmission and distribution \nhave to be made. Petrobangla estimates that average gas demand will rise to 4,115 million \ncubic feet per day (MMCFD) in FY2020. Probable gas production from existing gas fields is \nexpected to peak at 2,655 MMCFD in FY2017 and then gradually decline to 2,468 MMCFD in \nFY2020. Petrobangla projects production by IOCs to peak at 1,550 MMCFD in FY2017 with new \ndiscoveries both onshore and offshore. Overall peak production by SGCs and IOCs is estimated \nto reach 3,555 MMCFD in FY2017.  \n   \n8.  To  augment  gas  production,  Petrobangla  has  drawn  up  a  program  for  further \nexploration, renovating wells in producing gas fields, and drilling new wells in producing and \nnon-producing gas fields with self and government financing. Petrobangla estimates production \nenhancement rising to 400 MMCFD by FY2012, which appears to be optimistic. Production \naugmentation is likely to be around 250\u2013300 MMCFD.  \n ", "    Appendix 2  25 \n      \n9.  The recently concluded ADB sector assistance program evaluation for the Bangladesh \nenergy sector highlights the main findings related to the gas sector: (i) overdependency on \nnatural gas as a primary energy source, which threatens the energy security of the country; \n(ii) underpricing of gas resources, encouraging suboptimal allocation and inefficient use; and \n(iii) the need to diversify energy sources and place greater emphasis on regional cooperation. \nThese are the main lessons from ADB operations relevant to the gas sector: (i) Programmed \nlending for investments linked to an agreed medium-term road map for sector reforms can \nachieve  development  impacts  even  in  difficult  environments.  (ii)  Improved  corporate \ngovernance, managerial autonomy, and performance-based incentives can significantly change \ninstitutional performance even if there is no change in ownership and personnel. (iii) And the \ndomestic private sector is capable of investing in relatively capital-intensive energy industries if \nappropriate  incentives  and  policy  regimes  are  established.    Many  of  these  findings  are \naddressed in the recently approved gas sector reform road map given in Table A2. \n \nTable A2: Updated Gas Sector Reform Road Map \nExpected \nReform  Time  Benefits or  Monitoring  Status \nArea/Objective  Agenda  Frame  Impacts  Instrument  (December 2009) \nA.

In addition, there are bilateral meetings with \nleading energy sector development partners like the World Bank and JICA. ", "    Appendix 3  31 \n      \nC.  Achievements \n \n4.  Efforts in development coordination in the energy sector have greatly advanced the \nsector  reform  agenda  and  helped  improve  the  regulatory  environment  in  particular.  ADB \ncontinues  its  dialogue  with  development  partners  in  the  gas  sector  through  the  energy \nsubcommittee,  which  is  kept  informed  of  project  progress  during  ADB  missions.  Energy \nsubcommittee meetings were held during the fact-finding mission in May 2010 and the appraisal \nmission in December 2010 to enlighten development partners on progress in processing the \nproject,  for  which  the  energy  subcommittee  has  expressed  its  support.  During  bilateral \nmeetings,  the  Export\u2013Import  Bank  of  Korea  (Korea  Eximbank),  JICA,  and  World  Bank \nseparately expressed their support for the project.  \n \n5.  ADB had a successful joint appraisal mission with Korea Eximbank. Korea Eximbank \nconfirmed its commitment to funding part A-1 of the project, subject to final approval by its \nmanagement and the Government of the Republic of Korea. \n \nC.  Summary and Recommendations \n6.  The  coordination  arrangement  in  the  energy  sector  among  development  partners \nthrough the local coordination group has been successful in ensuring a coordinated approach to \nsector reforms and in avoiding any overlapping interventions.  Further, the coordination of \nassistance  in  the  gas  sector  by  the  government  through  EMRD  has  been  effective.  It  is \nrecommended to continue these arrangements with more regular interaction.   \n ", "32  Appendix 4   \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \nTable A4.1: Cost Estimates by Project Component \n$ Million\nItem Foreign  Local Total\nPart A: Transmission Capacity Expansion\nA-1.

The financial analysis of the proposed subprojects has been carried out in accordance \nwith the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.1 All \nfinancial costs and benefits are expressed in constant 2009 prices. Cost streams (i.e., capital \ninvestment  and  operation  and  maintenance)  reflect  the  costs  of  delivering  the  estimated \nbenefits. Financial analysis was undertaken for the transmission and distribution components of \nthe project. In the case of the safety and supply efficiency improvement component, no financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) is calculated.  \n \n 2.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for both Gas Transmission Company \nLimited (GTCL) and Sundarban Gas Company Limited (SGCL) was calculated and compared \nwith the project FIRRs to ascertain financial viability. The project is evaluated over a 20-year \nperiod. It is assumed that the subprojects will have a 30-year economic life and a residual value \nof 33% of the original investment at the end of 20 years. The financial evaluation considered \nonly the incremental revenues and costs directly associated with the project. All costs and \nrevenues are expressed in mid-2009 prices. Capital costs included physical contingencies but \nexcluded price contingencies and interest during construction. An exchange rate of Tk70 = $1 \nwas  assumed.  Repair  and  maintenance  costs  of  project  assets  were  based  on  estimates \nadopted in the economic evaluation. An allowance was made of 1.0% of capital costs for \npipeline maintenance and 2.5% of capital costs for compressor maintenance, plus a fuel cost \nbased on 1.5% of gas throughput at an average wellhead gas cost of Tk1.17 per cubic meter \n(m3). After 10 years, rehabilitating compressors is assumed at 50% of project costs. \n \nB.  GTCL Gas Transmission Subprojects \n3.  For the GTCL the compressor and transmission subprojects are primarily designed to \nrelieve downstream supply constraints and improve the efficiency of system operations. The \nsubprojects funded under the project are included in the context of a least-cost development \nplan for the network in the case of the compressors at Muchai and Elenga.2 Likewise, depletion \nof the Sangu gas field has meant that additional gas needs to be transmitted to Chittagong from \nAshuganj,  which  has  resulted  in  a  new  transmission  constraint  on  the  existing  Ashuganj\u2013\nChittagong pipeline. The 61-kilometer (km) Ashuganj\u2013Bakhrabad loop-line is the first step in \nrelieving this constraint. However, the 160 km Ashuganj\u2013Barabkunda loop-line is evaluated, as \nthis is necessary to realize the benefits in terms of increased gas supply at Chittagong.3   \n \n 4.  The GTCL derives its revenue from wheeling charges on gas volumes and condensate \nvolumes transported. For analysis purposes a rate of Tk0.64 per m3 is used, with gas volumes \nbased on those adopted in the economic analysis.4 The incremental gas volume that can be \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n2  This analysis includes the Muchai compressor financed by the private sector and the Muchai\u2013Ashuganj and \nDhanua\u2013Elenga loop-lines to be financed in the future. Analysis of all system enhancements was undertaken to \novercome the difficulties inherent in attributing the benefits to an upgrade of only part of the transmission system. \n3  Analysis of the entire loop-line enhancement was undertaken to overcome the difficulties inherent in attempting to \nascribe benefits to an upgrade to only part of the system upgrades where downstream pipeline restrictions means \nthis section would yield only a fraction of the total benefit of increasing gas supplies to Chittagong.  \n4 The current rate is Tk0.32 per m3. However, GTCL covenants require a rate of return on net fixed assets of 10%, \nand the wheeling charge will have to double by fiscal year (FY) 2012 to achieve this objective and meet the GTCL's \ndebt service, which will increase from Tk1,245 million in FY2010 to Tk4,680 by FY2015. \n ", "42  Appendix 7 \nmoved as a result of the proposed investments is 798 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) by \nfiscal year (FY) 2015.  \n \nC.

Calculation of FIRR, Risk Assessment, and Sensitivity Analyses \n6.  External risks. Regulatory or tariff revision risk for the subprojects is substantial, with \ntariff increases of 100% assumed in the financial analysis. However, financial covenants are in \nplace to ensure that the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) approves this \nincrease  in  the  GTCL's  margin  by  2012.  Without  such  increases,  the  GTCL\u2019s  long-term \nsustainability is in jeopardy. Gas demand risk is minimal, as the country already experiences \ngas shortages, with the Bangladesh Oil, Gas, and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) able to \nsupply only 80% of managed demand from present sources. Geopolitical and political risks are \npresent for all projects in Bangladesh. However, the nature of the investments and the shortage \nof gas in Bangladesh serve to diversify this risk. Therefore, the risk to the financial sustainability \nof the GTCL is deemed to be minimal, with the project seen as a necessary step toward \nimproving supply, especially by improving the efficiency of the transmission system.  \n \n7.  Project-specific risks. Financial risks include (i) increases in the prices of civil works \npipelines and equipment, (ii) delays in project implementation, and (iii) failure of counterpart \nfunds to materialize. These risks are low since (i) cost estimates were based on recent tenders \nreceived,  and  advanced  procurement  will  lessen  the  time  between  loan  effectiveness  and \ndisbursement; (ii) the GTCL\u2019s implementation capacity is low but adequate, and implementation \nconsulting support will be provided; and (iii) the projections prepared for the GTCL demonstrate \nthat, with increases in wheeling charges, cash flows will improve and the GTCL will be able to \nrepay debt associated with the investments.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \n \n5 10-year Treasury bond rate.  \n6 The government determines the onlending rate of foreign loans, irrespective of the London interbank offered rate, \nwith foreign loans attracting a 5% interest rate. However, the loans are in foreign currency and attract foreign \nexchange losses or gains annually, with the GTCL bearing the foreign exchange risk. ", "    Appendix 7  43 \n      \n8.  Sensitivity analyses. Separate analyses were carried out to examine the sensitivity of \nprojected financial returns to adverse changes in key variables. The variables considered for the \nsensitivity analyses were a 10% increase in capital costs, 10% increase in operating and \nmaintenance costs, 10% decrease in revenues, and a 2-year implementation delay with a 20% \nincrease in costs and no allowance for residual values. In addition, the impact of no increase in \nwheeling charges and a 50% increase by 2012 to Tk0.48 per m3 were examined.  \n \n9.  Summary of results.

", "  Appendix 8  45 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS  \n \nA.  Economic Rationale \n1.  Poor  infrastructural  continues  to  impede  Bangladesh\u2019s  development.  The  project  is \ndesigned to address some constraints faced by the gas sector in terms of production and \ntransmission, distribution, energy efficiency, and safety. The government\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy emphasizes policies to expand the natural gas grid to improve access to gas, promote \nextensive industrialization, and accelerate balanced regional development, which would help \nreduce widespread poverty. Thus the project is expected to improve equity in access to gas and \nimprove the environment and health, particularly of women and the poor, who are the most \nvulnerable to smoke from cooking fires. \n   \n2.  The  depletion  of  the  Sangu  gas  field  has  meant  that  additional  gas  needs  to  be \ntransmitted to Chittagong from Ashuganj, which has resulted in a new transmission constraint \non  the  existing  Ashuganj\u2013Chittagong  pipeline.  The  61-kilometer  (km)  Ashuganj\u2013Bakhrabad \nloop-line is the first step toward relieving this constraint. The compressors at Ashuganj and \nElenga,  together  with  the  compressors  at  Muchai  constructed  under  an  international  oil \ncompany (IOC) initiative, can potentially increase gas flow by 244 million cubic feet per day \n(MMCFD). The safety component will control seepage of gas from abandoned wells. This will \nreduce  hazards  and  improve  the  environment  in  the  gas  fields.  The  success  of  future \ninvestments in transmission and distribution depends on gas supply expansion because there is \na  growing  gap  between  demand  and  supply.  In  this  context,  component  B  focuses  on \naugmenting gas supply from the Titas gas field.  \n \n3.  The public sector investment in this project is justified as transmission and distribution \nfacilities are a natural monopoly. In addition, the project intervention corrects some other market \nfailures by reducing indoor air pollution through improved access to natural gas, improving \nsafety  and  the  environment  in  abandoned  gas  fields,  and  improving  supply  and  end-user \nefficiency,  which  would  not  be  undertaken  by  the  private  sector.  The  expected  global \nenvironmental benefits associated with reduced greenhouse gas emissions will be significant. \nThe project does not crowd out any potential private sector investments. However the project \nhas certain characteristics of private\u2013public partnership. For example, some of the facilities \ndeveloped  by  the  project  facilitate  gas  production  by  IOCs,  and  some  investments  in \ncompressors come from the private sector.  \n \n4.  In addition to correcting market failures, the project includes a number of measures to \ncorrect some of the non-market failures to ensure project outcomes. These measures include \nenhancing  sector-level  governance;  focusing  on  broader  sector  reforms;  realistic  tariff \ndetermination; setting up a regulatory institute and defining its functions; and enhancing the \nsustainability  of  energy  sector  operations  by  streamlining  the  approval  process  and \nimplementing the energy policy, proposed gas act, and updated gas sector reform road map. \nUnder the road map, several gas sector enterprises are required to undergo restructuring and \nimplement strategic business plans. Gas sector entities will also implement the plan to reduce \ngas system losses. \n \nB.  Demand Analysis \n5.  In July 2008, the Bangladesh Oil, Gas, and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla) revised its \nforecast  of  gas  demand  through  2020.  This  forecast  supersedes  that  prepared  by  Wood \nMackenzie in 2006 as part of the gas sector master plan and is now its official forecast. Gas ", "46  Appendix 8 \nconsumption rose from 365 billion cubic feet (BCF) in fiscal year (FY) 2001 to 557 BCF in \nFY2008, for a compound average annual growth rate of 7.3%. The highest consumption growth \nrate was in the non-bulk category, with an average growth rate over the period of 23%. The non-\nbulk  category  comprises  industry,  commerce,  households,  tea,  brick  field  (seasonal),  and \ncompressed  natural  gas  (CNG).  In  FY2006,  industry  accounted  for  49%  of  the  non-bulk \ncategory  and  households  40%.  Between  FY1999  and  FY2007,  industry\u2019s  average  annual \nconsumption growth was 12.4% and households\u2019 16.3%. The high rate of growth in domestic \nconsumption can be attributed to rapid construction growth and rural\u2013urban migration and the \nscarcity of alternative cheaper fuel for domestic use. CNG recorded phenomenal growth from \nFY2003 to FY2008 rising from 0.003 BCF in FY2003 to 24.2 BCF in FY2008. Government \ninitiatives to arrest air pollution by encouraging the use of indigenous natural gas, increasing the \nprices of alternative fuels for automobiles, increasing the number of CNG-powered vehicles, and \nexpanding multiple uses of indigenous natural gas have been major contributors to the high \nincrease in the consumption of CNG. Growth in gas consumption for electricity was 1.5% and \nfor fertilizer \u20136.5% over the period. The gas demand forecast revised by Petrobangla reflects \nsupply constraints. The overall growth rate assumed in the forecast is 7.3%, the same as the \nhistoric growth rate for 2002\u20132008. \n \n6.  To meet growing demand and overcome production and transmission deficiencies, \nlarge-scale investments in exploration, field development, transmission, and distribution have to \nbe made. Petrobangla estimates that maximum gas demand will rise to 5,144 MMCFD in \nFY2020. Probable gas production from existing gas fields is expected to peak at 2,475 MMCFD \nin  FY2017  and  then  gradually  decline  to  2,288  MMCFD  in  FY2020.  Petrobangla  projects \nproduction  peaking  at  1,080  MMCFD  in  FY2017,  following  new  discoveries  by  IOCs  both \nonshore and offshore. Overall peak production by state gas companies (SGCs) and IOCs is \nestimated to reach 3,555 MMCFD in FY2017. Despite the increase, gas supply is inadequate to \nmeet the demand because demand is growing more quickly. \n \nC.  Least-Cost Analysis  \n7.  The Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) has undertaken a least-cost analysis \nof system improvements. Analyses were conducted considering additional gas production only \nfrom new sources in the vicinity of the Kailashtilla and Muchai hubs. The analysis included \n13 options that were compared regarding financial costs and technical feasibility. Analysis took \ninto consideration discounted operation and maintenance costs for compressors and pipeline \nover 20 years along with capital cost for comparison. \n \n8.  Ongoing improvements in the gas transmission and distribution system were taken into \naccount. The planned loop-lines were assumed to be completed before the commissioning of \nthe  compressors  stations  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  D  for  the  different  options  and \nassociated  costs).  The  entire  simulation  assumes  that  the  system  meets  maximum  day \ndemand.  Option  H  (Muchai\u2013Ashuganj  30-inch  new  loop-line)  appears  to  be  the  least-cost \noption. Sound system operation depends largely on line pack availability for use during peak \nhours and repacking the lines off peak. As such, an option that will ensure faster packing and \nmaximum withdrawal during peak hours would be the best option for selection, irrespective of \ncost. An additional compressor, compared with option H, means faster packing of lines off peak \nfor  utilization  during  peak  hours.  Considering  these  technical  requirements,  option  N  was \nselected  as  optimum  given  its  cost  and  technical  characteristics.  Option  N  comprises \nconstructing  Muchai\u2013Ashuganj  and  Dhanua\u2013Elenga  30-inch  loop-lines  and  installing \ncompressors at Muchai, Ashuganj, and Elenga. The cost difference between selected and least-\ncost options is small. ", "    Appendix 8  47 \n      \n \nD.  Economic Analysis Methodology and Assumptions \n \n9.  Economic analysis of the project was undertaken in accordance with Asian Development \nBank (ADB) Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.1 Separate economic analyses for \ncomponents  of  the  project  have  not  been  carried  out  because  the  components  will  work \ntogether to remove some of the constraints on the gas transmission and distribution system. All \nthe improvements to transmission, distribution, supply augmentation, and compressors will bring \nan incremental increase in gas flow in the GTCL system. Economic analysis was undertaken \nbased on the benefits of this incremental gas supply from system improvements.  \n \n10.  As all policy reforms, institutional capacity building, and training are treated as necessary \nto  deliver  the  final  output  of  the  project,  no  additional  benefits  were  estimated  for  these \nactivities. Demand management may result in some energy savings by current consumers, \nallowing new consumers to consume gas. Since access to gas is currently limited to some end \nusers, this may not result in net savings. Therefore, no additional benefits were considered in \nthe  analysis.  Environmental  benefits  from  reduced  indoor  air  pollution,  greenhouse  gas \nemissions, and seepage in gas fields were not quantified because of data problems. \n \n11.  The  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  has  been  estimated  by  Bangladesh  Planning \nCommission at 1.03, which has been adopted for the analysis. It is assumed that there are no \nsignificant distortions in wage rates for skilled labor. In the case of unskilled labor, a shadow \nwage rate factor of 0.75 was adopted, based on parameters used by the Bangladesh Planning \nCommission.  \n \n12.  All costs and benefits are expressed at constant 2009 prices. The world price numeraire \nwas used in the analyses. Financial costs were allocated across the categories shown in Table \nA8.1. Investments will be required in upstream gas exploration and production to meet forecast \nsales. The life-cycle gas cost on an average incremental cost basis of $1.32 per thousand cubic \nfeet, as shown in Supplementary Appendix D, has been taken as a measure of the long-run \nmarginal cost of gas production.  \n .  \nTable A8.1: Cost Categories and Conversion Factors \nCost Component  Conversion Factor \nTraded goods and service  1.00 \nNon-traded goods and services  0.97 \nForeign skilled labor  1.00 \nLocal skilled labor  0.97 \nLocal unskilled labor  0.73 \nFuel  0.97 \nTaxes and financing charges  0.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13.  A 12% economic discount rate was used, and a period of 20 years has been used for \neconomic evaluation. Investment is assumed to take place in 2010\u20132015, and benefits are \nassumed to be realized from 2016, when Muchai compressor is expected to be operational. No \nresidual values are assumed in year 20. \n \n14.  It is assumed that the incremental flow of gas will displace sources of energy currently \nused by the beneficiaries. The incremental gas flow attributed to this project is derived from the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "48  Appendix 8 \nnetwork  analysis.  The  resource  cost  saving  arising  from  energy  displacement  is  the  main \neconomic benefit quantified in the analysis. Access to gas may bring incremental consumption, \nwhich  was  not  considered  in  the  analysis  because  of  lack  of  information  on  incremental \nconsumption and willingness to pay. However, since the project provides a high economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR), this omission does not affect the economic feasibility of the \nproject. The details of the values of displaced fuel are in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n15.  As exploiting natural gas depletes reserves, it entails an additional opportunity cost. This \nadditional  cost\u2014the  depletion  premium\u2014is  incorporated  in  the  economic  appraisal  of \nnonrenewable resource projects, based on ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of \nProjects. The substitute fuel price was based on a price of $60 for crude oil. The long-run \nmarginal cost of wellhead gas of $1.32 per million cubic feet was used as the extraction cost. \nThe value of benefits against the economic cost of fuels displaced by gas in the existing network \nand western zone distribution project is $11.4 per million cubic feet. \n \nE.  Results \n16.  The EIRR for the project is summarized in Table A8.2. Note that the combined costs \ninclude capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, gas extraction costs, and the depletion \npremium. The base case assumes only 80% of the incremental gas flow attributed to the project \nwill be delivered to end users. The results show that the project EIRR is 32%. The net present \nvalue is large because of very low gas extraction cost and the higher economic costs of \ndisplaced energy sources. \n \n17.  Table A8.2 presents the results of the sensitivity analysis. The rate of return of the \nproject is less sensitive to capital cost increase. Even if the predicted incremental gas flow is \nreduced by half, the project provides acceptable returns. The most sensitive factor for the \nproject is resource cost savings. A 20% reduction in the prices of energy sources displaced by \ngas will lower the EIRR to 19%. This is not a real risk to the project, as it is unlikely that oil \nprices  will  drop  below  $60  per  barrel,  the  price  used  in  the  economic  analysis.  Delay  in \ncommissioning the project will have some impact, but project analysis assumes that no benefits \noccur in the first 6 years. The results of sensitivity analyses show that project returns are robust \nagainst all risks. \n  \nTable A8.2: Results of Sensitivity Analyses  \n Item     Variation  EIRR (%) \nBase Case      32 \nProject capital costs    +50%  31 \nIncremental gas flow    \u201350%  22 \nResource cost savings    \u201320%  19 \nGas extraction cost    +50%  24 \nCommissioning delayed one year  +1 year  23 \nCommissioning delayed + capital and maintenance cost increase    +1 year + 50%   15 \n100% system efficiency    37 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "  Appendix 9  49 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Bangladesh: Natural Gas Access Improvement Project \n \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  South Asia Department \nProject Loan \nModality:   Division:  Energy Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nThe Government of Bangladesh has as its overarching goal and development vision, as articulated in the Poverty Reduction \nStrategy adopted in November 2005, to substantially reduce poverty and invigorate social development in the shortest \npossible time. The strategy also commits the government to halve the proportion of the population living below the poverty line \nby 2015. The strategy stresses the links among investment, growth and job creation, and poverty reduction, and it identifies \nkey areas where reforms are needed, public investments are required, and public policies can be improved. \n \nInfrastructure, particularly for energy, will play a very significant role in achieving the envisaged economic growth and poverty \nreduction. Reliable access to energy is essential for economic development and poverty reduction. However, the energy \nsector has recently been afflicted by shortages of gas and electricity, which stifles economic growth and social welfare \nimprovement.  The  government  is  implementing  comprehensive  energy  sector  reforms  through  a  carefully  sequenced \napproach to ensure reduced physical distribution costs and improve service delivery to the poor and poorer geographic areas. \n \nNatural gas is the dominant energy resource of the country, accounting for 75% of the total commercial energy consumption. \nIt can significantly contribute to reducing poverty, particularly in the project areas, where 54% of the households are estimated \nto live below the poverty line.a Natural gas contributes to poverty reduction by expanding access to clean energy and \nemployment opportunities during project construction and, after completion, increasing economic activity in the project area. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: GI \n \n1. Key Issues  \nThe project will make clean energy available to the less-developed southwestern region of Bangladesh, and its population of \n10 million (7% of the country\u2019s total). The analysis conducted during project preparation indicates that 30% of beneficiaries (3 \nmillion) are poor and will directly or indirectly benefit from the project. The channels through which the income of the poor \nwould potentially increase are (i) expansion in off-farm activities; (ii) growth in agricultural income; (iii) expansion of markets \nand institutions with more available gas and electricity; (iv) time savings that can be devoted to other income-earning pursuits, \nparticularly by women; and (v) lower costs of cooking. The contributions to reducing non-income poverty are through (i) \ncontrolling  the  depletion  of  forest  resources,  (ii)  empowering  women  by  creating  off-farm  income  opportunities, \n(iii) establishing social infrastructure that can provide better services (e.g., health centers and educational institutions), and \n(iv) building social relations and status.  \n \nThe proportion benefits accruing to the poor has been estimated for all benefits allocated by the distribution analysis. Benefits \nto domestic consumers have been allocated according to the proportion of consumers that are poor. Domestic consumers will \nmainly be residents of the project area, and benefits are allocated using the poverty incidence in the project area. The poverty \nimpact ratio is estimated to be 30%, which indicates that the project reduces poverty.  \n  \n2. Design Features. The project will create 3,000 person-months of unskilled job opportunities equally for men and women. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues.  \nSocial studies carried out in 2009 show that the project will necessitate the acquisition of private land, with significant impact \non affected households. \n \nTo mitigate these impacts, the three gas companies have adopted full and short resettlement plans with detailed resettlement ", "50  Appendix 9 \nand rehabilitation provisions to address the loss of land, structures, livelihood, and common property resources. The gas \ncompanies have also addressed community concerns about compensation packages for land and replacement of common \nproperty resources. In addition, a grievance redress mechanism has been put in place to address, for example, apprehension \nabout environmental pollution and compensation. The social analysis shows that an immediate benefit of the project is \nenvisaged in terms of livelihood and employment opportunities during plant construction and operation.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nTo ensure proper community participation, various stakeholders\u2014representatives of vulnerable groups, local leaders, and \nmayors\u2014were consulted during the project preparation. The gas companies undertook consultations with local officials and \nvillage leaders in the project area. These consultations played a vital role in raising awareness, gaining local support, and \nenabling affected people to voice their opinions and suggestions on project design and implementation. The poor and women \nhave been carefully considered in conducting participatory activities. As part of the social assessment, stakeholders\u2019 \nconsultations were carried out in the project areas with the broad objective of ensuring the extensive participation of all \nstakeholders. The participatory approach will be continued during implementation. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing     Consultation     Collaborative decision making    Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes    No  \n \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \n \nWhile a separate C&P plan has not been prepared, adequate provisions of community consultation and participation during \nproject implementation have been made and incorporated in the resettlement plan, entailing several additional rounds of \nconsultations with affected people during project implementation.  \n \nC. Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nAttempts were made during project preparation to consult women regarding their perceptions of the project and its adverse \nand positive impacts through gender analysis. Expanded gas production and transmission will bring several positive changes \nin the daily life of womenfolk. Access to gas will cut cooking costs and reduce the time women spend cooking food and \ncollecting fuel. \n \nSome women landowners and households headed by women will be affected by land acquisition. The resettlement plan \nprovides for additional assistance to households headed by women and some other vulnerable groups.  \n \n2.  Key Actions.

Summary Short Resettlement Plan for Part C \n \n1.  The  project  is  located  in  the  five  districts  of  Khulna  Division,  covering  Bheramara, \nKushtia,  Jhenaidah,  Jessore,  Kaliganj,  Basundia,  Noapara,  Fultala,  Gilatola  Cantonment, \nDaulatpur, Khalishpur, Zoragate, Boyra, Khulna shipyard, Khulna, Bagerhat, and Mongla. The \nshort resettlement plan for part C is in Supplementary Appendix H.1 \n \n2.  The distribution pipeline with two feeders will follow the right-of-way of existing roads \nbelonging to the municipalities and city corporation. Project sites were selected to minimize \nimpacts by avoiding involuntary land acquisition and displacement and by confining the project \nto  government  or  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited  (GTCL)  land.  Although  no  titled \nlandholders will be affected, nine households comprising 52 persons (mainly squatters) will be \ntemporarily  affected  for  a  maximum  of  1 week  and  will  therefore  require  compensation.  A \ndetailed survey of 100% of the affected people was conducted in June 2009. Nine informal \ncommercial structures will be temporarily affected. All nine affected households will be affected \ntemporarily by losing their livelihoods. No common property or resources will be affected. \n \nTable A10.1: Summary of Impacts \nAffected Structure  Affected Households  Affected People \nPottery shop  1  7 \nButchery  4  25 \nTea stall  4  20 \nTotal  9  52 \n  Source: Sundarban Gas Company Limited \n \n3.  This short resettlement plan is based upon the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable \nProperty Ordinance of 1982 (Ordinance II of 1982) and subsequent amendments and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Cut-off dates were set to be \nbetween 4 and 6 June 2009, depending on the consultation and survey dates. The resettlement \nofficer will be in charge of monitoring the implementation of the short resettlement plan. He or \nshe will ensure that the resettlement budget is available in a timely manner. \n \n4.  A grievance redress committee will be established by the commencement of civil works \nto mediate in disputes concerning resettlement assistance and project-related grievances. The \ncommittee will comprise city mayors, local nongovernment organizations, representatives of the \nproject, and concerned agencies and departments. \n \nTable A10.2: Detailed Budget \nCost  Cost \nItem  Area/Unit  (Tk million)  ($ '000) \nA.

The  project  constitutes  four  components:  (i)  drilling  four  appraisal-cum-development \nwells in Titas gas field, (ii) installing two process plants, (iii) gathering a 2.93-kilometer (km) line \nfrom wells to processing plants, and (iv) identifying gas seepage and needs for repair and \nservicing of existing wells at Titas gas field (Supplementary Appendix I).2 \n \n6.  Implementing the project will require the acquisition of 17.51 acres of mostly agricultural \nland, affecting households. Of these, 113 will permanently lose 15.47 acres of land, three will \nlose residential assets (two will lose boundary walls and one will lose a temporary residential \nstructure and a boundary wall), and four will lose 175 trees. The remaining 58 are now impacted \nby the gas seepage, which costs them access to 3.73 acres. The latter affected households will \nbe compensated for the loss of access to their land from seepage. The project will not further \naffect them except to allow them to use their land again. \n \nTable A10.3: Summary of Impacts \nImpact  Affected Households  Affected Area/Item \nAgricultural land  113  15.47 acres \nResidential asset  3  3 structures \nTrees  4  175 trees \nAffected by gas seepage  58  3.73 acres \nTotal  178   \n \n7.  Out of the 171 households incurring impact on land, 37% (65 households) will incur an \nimpact on more than 10% of their land. Among these 171 households, 17% will suffer the loss of \nless than 1% of their total landholding, with limited impact on their income, and 35% (59 \nhouseholds) will suffer losses ranging from 1% to 5% of their landholding. The remaining \n31 households will lose from 5% to 10% of their land.  \n \n8.  Land acquisition will be necessary for drilling wells and installing processing plants, as \nno public land is available in the project area. However, the BGCL has devoted particular \nattention during the planning process to ensuring minimal impacts. Locations were chosen to \nmeet both economic and social requirements, with minimum disturbance and no homestead \nresettlement. Public consultations with local communities were particularly effective in achieving \nthis goal.  \n \n9.  This resettlement plan is based upon the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable \nProperty Ordinance of 1982 (Ordinance II of 1982) and subsequent amendments and ADB's \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The entitlement matrix is in Table A10.7  \n \n10.  Affected households that are vulnerable or will lose more than 10% of their productive \nassets will receive additional support for livelihood restoration. A nongovernment organization \n(NGO)  for  resettlement  consulting  will  be  recruited  specifically  to assess their needs.  The \nresettlement officer will be in charge of monitoring the implementation of the resettlement plan. \nHe or she will also ensure that the resettlement budget is available in a timely manner. \n \n11.  A  grievance  redress  committee  will  be  established  at  the  project  level  by  the \ncommencement of civil works with the primary objective of providing a mechanism to mediate \n                                                 \n2  In case of any changes in the project design during the implementation, the revised and updated resettlement plan \nwill be submitted to ADB for review prior to award of civil works contracts. \n ", "54  Appendix 10 \ndisputes concerning resettlement assistance and project-related grievances.

Summary Resettlement Plan for Part A \n \n12.  The project will finance the construction of 61 km of gas transmission pipeline from \nAshuganj to Bakhrabad, which will go across 21 unions of four upazilas in the two districts of \nBrahmanbaria and Comilla (Supplementary Appendix I).3 \n \n13.  Implementing the project will require the acquisition and requisition of land on the right-\nof-way of gas transmission pipeline. Three segments: 8 meters in the middle and 6 meters and \n9 meters on the two sides will constitute the width of the land acquisition. The central 8 meters \nwill be permanently acquired, while the remaining 15 meters will be requisitioned, or temporarily \nacquired, for the duration of the civil works. \n \n14.  The GTCL has undertaken efforts to minimize adverse impacts. In this regard, the \ncorridor was chosen to pass through agricultural land and avoid settlements and disruption of \nhomestead. The GTCL will ensure that civil works are completed during the dry season to avoid \ndisrupting crops on land that will be temporarily acquired. \n \n15.  The survey indicates that the construction and installation of the 61 km of gas pipeline \nwill require the permanent acquisition of 50.65 hectares (ha) and the temporary acquisition of \n105.76 ha. A total of 1,992 households will be affected by the permanent acquisition , and 2,185 \nhouseholds will be affected by temporary acquisition, for a total of 10,956 affected people. \nSupplementary Appendix I (Tables 2.0\u20132.9) contains a detailed breakdown of impacts. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  In case of any changes in the project design during the project implementation, the revised and updated \nresettlement plan will be submitted to ADB for review prior to award of civil works contracts.
