The \nproject also aims to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD) to plan, \nmanage, and monitor road maintenance operations by improving the sustainability of funding for \nroad maintenance, increasing the participation and capacity of the private contracting industry, \nand strengthening provincial departments of rural development (PDRDs) as a means to support \ngreater decentralization of road maintenance responsibilities. Furthermore, the project will help \nMRD  establish  an  axle  load  control  program  for  rural  roads,  design  and  manage  a  rural  road \nsafety program for the project provinces, and establish better implementation capacity for social \nsafeguards within MRD. The project also supports initial work on road design and planning for \nclimate  change,  and  on  emergency  preparedness,  mitigation,  and  response.  The  feasibility \nstudy  for  the  project  was  prepared  through  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical \nassistance (TA) to the government.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nRoads  are  the  principal  mode  of  transportation  in  Cambodia.  The  road  network  of \napproximately  39,400  km  includes:  (i)  national  roads  (primary  national  highways)  with  a  total \nlength of about 4,800 km; (ii) provincial roads (secondary national highways) with a total length \nof  about  6,600  km;  and  (iii)  about  28,000  km  of  rural  roads.  Management  of  national  and \nprovincial  roads  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT), \nwhereas management of rural roads is the responsibility of MRD. \n \n4. \nThe  country\u2019s  road  network  had  greatly  deteriorated  by  the  early  1990s,  as  a  result  of \nthe civil war. However, since 1992, with assistance from ADB and other multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment  partners,  the  government  has  focused  on  rehabilitating  the  core  national \ninfrastructure that is required for the economy to develop in a sustainable manner. Development \nefforts have increased the length of the paved national road network to about 2,700 km, which is \nslightly less than 25% of the total national and provincial road network. \n \n5. \nThe remote rural economy is becoming increasingly dependent on the improved national \nroad network, yet the rural road network continues to deteriorate because of the steady growth \nin  traffic,  combined  with  a  lack  of  maintenance  financing,  poor  road  maintenance  standards, \ninadequate  institutional  capacity  in  road  maintenance  and  management,  lack  of  private \ncontractor  capacity,  and  design  and  construction  deficiencies.  The  project  will  address  these \nissues  and  provide  reliable  all-year  road  access  from  provincial  towns  and  agricultural  rural \nareas  to  markets,  employment  centers,  and  social  services  in  seven  provinces,  serving  about \n560,000 beneficiaries. These provinces are Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Chhnang, \nKampong  Speu,  Kampong  Thom,  Pursat,  and  Siem  Reap,  most  of  which  are  located  around \nTonle  Sap  Basin  where  a  large  proportion  of  Cambodia's  rural  poor  live.  Some  of  the  current \ngravel roads, which are 5\u20136 meters (m) in width, are susceptible to flooding in the rainy season. \nMotorcycles  constitute  nearly  80%  of  the  traffic  on  these  roads,  which  have  low  to  moderate \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia  for the Provincial/Rural  Road Asset Management \n\nProject. Manila (TA 7199-CAM). \n\n\flevels of traffic; the average daily traffic volume ranges from 200 to 2,000 passenger car units, \ndepending  on  the  road  section.  The  current  annual  growth  rate  of  traffic  varies  between  3.6% \nand 6% based on the type of vehicle. These growth rates are forecast to increase by 7.2%\u201312% \nper annum, thus requiring a more sustainable paved rural road network to accommodate future \ntraffic. \n \n6. \nAs  a  consequence  of  relatively  rapid  economic  development,  overloading  of  cargo \nvehicles has become a severe cause of road damage in Cambodia in the past 5 years. This is \nalso an issue on rural roads as a result of overloaded trucks that haul agricultural products and \ncarry  quarry  materials  for  construction.  While  ADB  is  currently  supporting  axle  load  control \nprograms for the national road network, the project aims to provide a wider coverage of control \nto curtail overloading in certain locations within the project provinces. \n \n7. \nCambodia  has  one  of  the  highest  incidences  of  road  accidents  in  the  world  with  18 \nfatalities per 10,000 vehicles in 2007. This is a 50% increase from 2000 and nearly three times \nhigher  than  that  in  neighboring  Thailand.  Thus,  deteriorating  road  safety  is  a  major  sector \nconcern, especially with the increasing growth of traffic in rural areas. Increased traffic speeds \nresulting from improved paved road surfaces can also impose tremendous safety risks to rural \ncommunities.  In  line  with  the  national  umbrella  programs  for  road  safety  and  ADB's  ongoing \nsupport through MPWT, the project will assist the MRD in designing and managing a rural road \nsafety program for the project provinces. Additionally, given the natural disasters that Cambodia \nhas faced in recent years, particularly the frequent flooding during the wet season, the need to \naddress climate change considerations is essential. The project therefore includes a number of \ninnovative  climate  change  adaptation  activities  relating,  for  example,  to  road  design  and \nplanning for emergency preparedness, mitigation, and response. \n \n8. \nSupported  by  past  and  ongoing  ADB  projects  and  TAs,  the  draft  transport  policy  has \nbeen approved by  MPWT and is currently being reviewed by Cambodia's Council of Ministers \nfor  final  approval.  MRD's  policy  for rural  roads  is  currently being  finalized  and  will supplement \nthis transport policy. The rural roads policy needs to be approved and adopted within the project \nperiod to ensure effective implementation of all project outputs. MRD's sub-decree on the right-\nof-way  for  rural  roads  also  needs  to  be  formulated,  finalized,  and  approved  during  the  early \nstages  of  project  implementation.  This  sub-decree  will  then  be  integrated  with  MPWT's  sub-\ndecree  for  national  and  provincial  roads  to  form  the  road  right-of-way  law  for  Cambodia.  The \nproject  includes  assurances  for  timely  approvals  of  both  the  rural  roads  policy  and  the  sub-\ndecree on the right-of-way for rural roads. The project is therefore in line with the draft transport \npolicy  of  Cambodia;  this  transport  policy  is  one  recommendation  of  ADB\u2019s  sector  assistance \nprogram evaluation2 for Cambodia\u2019s transport sector. \n \n9. \nADB's country operations business plan (COBP) 2009\u20132012 for Cambodia aims to foster \npro-poor and socially inclusive growth by enhancing environmentally sustainable agriculture and \nrural development. In light of the indirect impacts of the global economic crisis, the COBP seeks \nto  do  this  by  diversifying  the  sources  of  rural  growth  and  bolstering  poverty  reduction  efforts.3 \nThe geographic focus of rural livelihood efforts will continue to be the Tonle Sap Basin, which \nhas a large proportion of Cambodia's rural poor. The COBP includes four road sector projects in \nthe  program,  all  of  which  are  in  line  with  another  recommendation  of  the  sector  assistance \nprogram evaluation, which requires ADB to shift its focus to the rehabilitation of provincial and \nrural roads. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2009.

These two projects will rehabilitate and maintain \nconnecting rural roads to improve the rural poor\u2019s access to markets and social \nservices.  The  phased  approach  for  the  two  projects  is  intended  to  resolve  the \ncurrent issues in the rural roads subsector (see paras. 5 and 6) in a systematic \nway.  \nThe  Provincial  Roads  Asset  Management  Project  is  programmed  for  2011  to \nsupport MPWT in the rehabilitation of provincial roads. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nThe  government's  poverty  reduction  strategy  for  2009\u20132013  (the  Rectangular  Strategy \n10. \nfor  Growth,  Employment,  Equity  and  Efficiency,  Phase  II)  emphasizes  generating  economic \ngrowth through the private sector, with rehabilitation and development of the country's physical \ninfrastructure as a necessary precondition.6 The project supports this strategy, particularly as it \nenhances  connectivity,  economic  exchange,  and  access  to  social  services  in  remote  areas  of \nCambodia. Thus, it is included in the COBP 2009\u20132012 as a core project in the transport sector. \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  is  improved  access  to  markets,  jobs,  and  social  services  in \nseven  project  provinces,  mainly  surrounding  Tonle  Sap  Basin.  These  are  Battambang, \nKampong  Cham,  Kampong  Chhnang,  Kampong  Speu,  Kampong  Thom,  Pursat,  and  Siem \nReap. \n \n12. \nThe expected outcome of the project is the provision of safe, cost effective, all-year road \naccess  in  remote  agricultural  areas  of  the  seven  provinces,  where  a  large  proportion  of \nCambodia\u2019s rural poor lives. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nroads. \n \n\nThere are five key outputs of the project that address the above issues pertaining to rural \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\nRoad rehabilitation. The project will pave 505.4 km of rural roads using a double \nbituminous  seal  treatment.  The  project  roads  are  located  in  seven  provinces, \nmainly around Tonle Sap Basin (para. 11) and were selected based on screening \ncriteria that included: (a) the rural roads must link with the already paved primary \nnational  road  network  and  provincial  road  network  to  provide  smooth  all-weather \naccess; (b) the roads must support ADB's past, ongoing, and future projects, not \nonly  in  the  road  sector,  but  also  in  other  sectors;  and  (c)  the  roads  must  be \nconsistent with MRD's priorities for rural development and decentralization. \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2009.

Manila (Loan 2539-CAM). \n\n5  The first project is this proposed one, for approval in 2010. It  will be supplemented by a proposed Second Rural \nRoads Improvement Project, for approval in 2012. The first project will use the loan proceeds to design the second \none,  thus  ensuring  stronger  ownership  by  the  government,  more  systematic  capacity  building  for  the  MRD  in \nproject preparation, and a smooth transition between the two projects. \n\n6  Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia. 2008.

The  project  will  improve  road  asset \nmanagement  in  a  sustainable  manner  through  a  strong  capacity-building \nprogram.  This  program  will:  (a)  implement  training  programs  for  MRD  and \nPDRDs  to  strengthen  human  resource  capacity  in  technical  and  project \nmanagement issues concerning road asset planning and management; (b) help \nMRD to prepare road asset management budgets and identify potential revenue \nsources to ensure sustainable financing; (c) implement an overloading prevention \nprogram for rural roads, starting with the project provinces; and (d) implement a \ncontracting  industry  support  program  (program  outline  web-linked)  that  will  help \nestablish  professional  engineering  and  contracting  institutes  in  Cambodia  to \nincrease the capacity of local private sector contractors. \n\nIncreased road safety and safeguards. The awareness and application of road \nsafety and safeguards will be increased by: (a) implementing a community-based \nroad  safety  awareness  program,  including  an  education  program  for  schools, \ndrivers,  road  users,  and  the  community,  in  line  with  the  national  program  that \nalso \nin  various  project  designs;  (b) \nestablishing  a  new  social  and  environment  office  in  MRD;  (c)  implementing  an \nHIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  prevention  program;  and  (d)  conducting  a  sex-\ndisaggregated baseline socioeconomic survey of beneficiaries. \n\nincorporates  road  safety  provisions \n\nClimate  change  adaptation. Vulnerability to climate change in the project area \nwill be reduced under a pilot initiative in Southeast Asian countries. The activities \ncontributing to this output are: (a) vulnerability mapping for rural roads to improve \nplanning  for  climate  changes;  (b)  introducing  ecosystem-based  adaptation \nstrategies  focusing  on  environmental  and  green  planning  for  project  roads  to \nimprove  flood  and  drought  management  (i.e.,  increasing  ground  cover  and \ninfiltration  of  flood  water  during  floods,  and  water  retention  during  droughts, \nwhich have the added benefit of enhancing rural livelihoods by improving the soil \nstructure  for  agriculture);  (c)  piloting  the  use  of  climate  monitoring  systems  to \nimprove  road  management  and  maintenance,  since  certain  maintenance  works \ncan only take place during the dry season but, as seasons are shifting each year, \nplanning  is  becoming  more  difficult;  (d)  developing  pilot  programs  for  an  early \nwarning  system  and  emergency  management  planning  for  rural  roads;  and  (e) \nplanning water capture and storage systems to manage the increased intensity of \nfloods and droughts together with the ecosystem measures. \n\nEfficient  project  management.  The  project  also  includes  project  management \nsupport for MRD, the executing agency. \n\n \n14. \nThe  project  will  have  substantial  positive  employment  and  gender  impacts  in  the  rural \ncommunities. The labor and gender mainstreaming action plan (web-linked) describes the labor \nand gender-mainstreaming aspects associated with the project outputs. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $67.0  million  including  taxes,  duties,  and  priority \noperating cost (POC) of $7.25 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, \nand  interest  and  other  charges  during  implementation.  The  investment  plan  is  summarized  in \nTable  1.

For the ADB loan, the repayment period of the proposed loan \nwill  be  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1.0%  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% thereafter. The interest during construction will be financed by the ADB loan. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  made  available  by  the  borrower  to  the  MRD  through  budgetary \nallocations. The ADB loan will fund civil works, related consulting services, equipment, and project \nmanagement totaling $35 million equivalent. Korea Eximbank (KEXIM) of the Government of Korea \nwill  finance  civil  works  and  related  consulting  services  through  a  $19.35  million  loan,  while  the \nNordic  Development  Fund  (NDF)  will  finance  climate  change  adaptation  through  a  $5.4  million \ngrant. Both will be parallel cofinancing, administered by each agency, but the KEXIM loan will be on \ntied-basis.

The  PDRDs  of \nthe seven provinces will be the implementing agencies to execute civil works in the respective \nprovince.  Through  a  project  coordinator,  the  PMU  will  initiate  and  coordinate  effective \ncommunication among all stakeholders of the project, including the MRD, Ministry of Economy \nand  Finance,  and  other  agencies  of  the  government,  beneficiary  stakeholders,  and  donor \nagencies. The project coordinator, at secretary of state level, will coordinate all project activities \nwithin and outside MRD. The technical head of the PMU will be the project director, at director \ngeneral  level,  who  will  manage  detailed  project  activities  and  report  to  the  coordinator.  The \nproject  manager,  at  deputy  director  general  level,  in  managing  daily  activities,  will  assist  the \nproject  director.  MRD  management  has  already  identified  suitable  persons  for  these  three \npositions.  The  remaining  PMU  personnel,  to  be  identified  and  appointed,  will  require  well-\ndeveloped  technical  and  management  skills  to  implement  the  project.  This  process  will  also \ninclude consultations with ADB, the consultants, and other experienced PMUs, like in MPWT. \n \n18. \nImplementation  period.  The  project  will  be  implemented  within  a  period  of  5  years, \nfrom  2011  to  2015.  To expedite  implementation,  MRD  requested  and ADB  approved  advance \nprocurement  action  and  retroactive  financing  for  initial  project  administration  activities.  ADB \nadvised  the  government  that  approval  of  advance  action  and  retroactive  financing  does  not \ncommit ADB to finance the project.

The \napproach used to evaluate the project follows the standard practice of comparing the life-cycle \ncosts  of  the  road  agency  and  road  users,  with  and  without  the  project.  The  economic  internal \nrate of return of the proposed project is 32%, well above the 12% threshold, and the economic \ninternal rates of return for individual roads are also above 12%. \n \nB. \n \nADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998, as  amended  to  date)  was  explained to,  and discussed \n20. \nwith \nthroughout  project \nimplementation.  Apart  from  this,  a  good-governance  framework  (GGF) 8  was  developed,  in \ncoordination  with  the  government  and  another  ongoing  ADB  project. 9  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures to ensure good governance are described in the PAM. \nThe GGF will be posted on the websites of MRD and ADB. Review missions will closely monitor the \nPAM  and  GGF.  In  addition,  mitigation  measures  to  address  potential  risks  associated  with \nprocurement and financial management are summarized in Table 4. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nThe  project  will  significantly  benefit  the  rural  poor,  including  women,  living  within  the \nTonle Sap Basin. Local economic development depends on improved  connectivity, and paved \nrural  roads  will  reduce  travel  times,  increase  convenience,  and  make  it  safer  for  women  and \ngirls  to  travel  further  from  home.  Better  accessibility  will  improve  rural  health  and  educational \nattainment. Girls will have a better chance of attending secondary school, markets will be easier \nto  reach,  and  \u201cbuy  and  sell\u201d  job  opportunities  for  women  will  increase.  Road  construction  and \nmaintenance  will  generate  jobs  for  local  men  and  women,  and  provide  much-needed  cash \nincome. The project's labor and gender mainstreaming action plan will ensure that contractors \ngive priority to local residents for construction and road maintenance jobs, and ensure that men \nand  women  benefit  equally,  with  equal  pay  for  equal  work.  From  a  health  perspective  rural \nvillages will benefit from a significant reduction in dust, which is linked to respiratory disease, a \nmajor  cause  of  child  mortality  in  Cambodia.  Potentially  negative  social  impacts  of  increased \nconnectivity will be monitored and mitigated through HIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention \n                                                 \n8  Good Governance Framework (Appendix 2). \n9  ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Grant  to  the \nKingdom of Cambodia for Public Finance Management for Rural Development Project. Manila (Grant 0133-CAM). \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nprograms. The project includes a community-based road safety program to increase road user \nsafety. \n \nD. \n \n22. \nThe  project  has  been  classified  at  category  B  for  both  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). While none of the project roads will \nrequire  widening,  a  private  contractor  has  already  widened  a  350  m  segment  of  Road  1KS3 \nnear NR 3 without prior notification to MRD and ADB. Due diligence findings show that the road \nwidening affected secondary structures and trees, but without any compensation and assistance \nbeing  provided  to  the  affected  households.  The  government  has  agreed  to  address  the \nnoncompliance  issues  by  providing  compensation  and  assistance  to  the  affected  households \nbefore the loan effectiveness date. MRD has assured ADB that there will be no land acquisition \nand resettlement activities along the remainder of the road or any other road section within the \nproject  scope,  under  any  circumstance.  However,  there  may  be  temporary  impacts  during \nconstruction. A resettlement framework, prepared by MRD and agreed by ADB and Ministry of \nEconomy  and  Finance  on  5  March  2010,  addresses  all  such  potential  issues.  It  is  envisaged \nthat there will be no or limited impacts on indigenous groups, and indigenous peoples specific \nactions are included in the resettlement framework.10  \n \nThe  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  Results  of  the  initial \n23. \nenvironmental examination (IEE) showed that only minor environmental impacts are anticipated. \nSuch impacts will be experienced during site works mainly due to dust and noise emissions as \nwell  as  potential  occupational  and  community  health  and  safety  risks,  but  can  be  mitigated. \nWhile the road widening that has already been completed along a 350 m section of 1KS3 has \naffected  some  permanent  structures  through  the  partial  demolition  of  a  number  of  shops  and \nuprooting of several fruit trees, no associated environmental impacts were identified that would \nwarrant the conduct of an environmental due diligence study. \n \n24. \nNone  of  the  project  roads  traverses  the  buffer  or  core  zones  of  ecologically  protected \nareas. With regard to culturally protected sites, the road improvements in Kampong Thom  will \ninclude  the  buffer  and  core  zones  of  the  Prasat  Sambour  temple,  which  is  proposed  for \nclassification  as  a  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization  World \nHeritage  Site.  While  the  road  proposed  for  improvement  in  Siem  Reap  connects  to  the  paved \nroad  network  of  the  Angkor  Wat  temple  complex,  it  does  not  pass  through  the  complex  itself \nwhere archaeological structures are found. Certifications of no objection to the project have also \nbeen obtained from the management authorities of Prasat Sambour and Angkor Wat. To avoid \nor mitigate negative impacts arising from the project, an environmental management plan (EMP) \ndetailing  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  has  been  prepared  as  part  of  the  IEE. \nPublic  consultations  involving  affected  people  and  local  officials  have  been  conducted  during \nthe  preparation  of  the  IEE  in  compliance  with  ADB  information  disclosure  and  consultation \nrequirements through focus group discussions and individual interviews in all seven provinces. \nTo  ensure  that  the  project  is  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  EMP  requirements,  MRD  will \nspecify  details  of  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  in  the  tender  documents  and  civil  works \ncontracts.  MRD  will  be  assisted  by  the  detailed  design  and  implementation  supervision \nconsultant in monitoring the environmental performance of contractors. The detailed design and \nimplementation supervision consultant will also provide on-the-job training to the field personnel \nof MRD to build their capacity in environmental management and monitoring. \n                                                 \n10 Resettlement Framework (Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n25. \nGiven  the  procurement  management  problems  that  other  development  partners  have \nhad with MRD in the past, there is a need to establish risk mitigation measures as ADB embarks \non  this  rural  road  project.  The  preliminary  assessment  during  the  TA  identified  MRD's  public \nfinancial management, procurement, corruption, and due diligence as the greatest risks during \nproject implementation.
