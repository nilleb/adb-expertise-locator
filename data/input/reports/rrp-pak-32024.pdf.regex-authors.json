An initial environmental examination was undertaken; \nAssessment  the summary is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  enhance  rural  development  within  a \ncomprehensive  framework  that  supports  the  Government\u2019s \ndevolution  initiatives  for  people-centered,  rights-  and \nresponsibility-based, and service-oriented government structures. \nIn a complementary manner, it combines thematic, cross-cutting, \nand sector initiatives, which address the critical constraints that \nimpinge directly on improvement of rural livelihoods and which \naim to correct power imbalances in society. The Project will assist \nthe  project  implementation  offices  (PIO)  within  the  district \ngovernments to build their management capacities and support \nthe creation of synergies between  government and civil society \nthrough partnerships with community-based organizations (CBOs) \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n \nRationale  Factors constraining the ability of rural households in Sindh to \nmake significant improvements in their livelihoods are diverse and \ninterdependent. Major characteristics of rural poverty pertain to \nthe complex social, cultural, legal, and political environment with \nthe existing feudal relationship between landlords, tenants, and \nlandless laborers at its core. A sharecropping tenancy system \nprevails in the canal-irrigated areas of the four project districts. \nTenancy arrangements leave little room for the tenants to take \ndecisions. Changes over time in the tenancy system have been to \nthe disadvantage of the tenants. The chances of tenants incurring \ndebts with the landlord, which they are not able to repay at the \nend  of  a  production  cycle,  are  high.  The  tenants  become \n\"bonded\",  in  the  sense  that  their  right  to  move  and  seek \nemployment freely is restricted until the debts are settled. The \nSindh  Tenancy  Act,  1950,  enacted  to  regulate  the  tenancy \narrangements  and  protect  the  rights  of  the  cultivators,  is \nhampered by low levels of compliance. \n \n  Additional  key  constraints  limiting  the  livelihood  enhancement \nopportunities of the poor are extremely low levels of literacy; lack \nof access to extension service and appropriate technologies, and \nto formal credit; and deficient community infrastructure. \n \n ", "  iv \nObjectives and Scope  The Project will reduce poverty in the canal-irrigated areas of \nBadin,  Mirpurkhas,  Sanghar,  and  Thatta  districts  in  southern \nSindh  through  increasing  empowerment  and  improving \ngovernance, improving access of the rural poor to public services, \ntransferring  technology  for  improved livelihoods, and providing \nessential infrastructure. The objective of the Project is to improve \nthe social status and economic well-being of the poorest groups in \nthe project area with a focus on the following target groups (i) \ntenants  and  agricultural  laborers,  (ii)  marginal  owners-cum-\ntenants, and (iii) small village-based artisans. There will be a \nparticular focus on women as the most disadvantaged among the \ntarget  groups.  The  objective  will  be  achieved  through \nimplementation  of  the  following  five  components (i) improved \ngovernance and legal support, (ii) enhanced social processes at \nthe community level, (iii) improved rural livelihoods, (iv) upgraded \nrural infrastructure and settlement improvement, and (v) project \nmanagement support. A clear targeting of project components to \nspecific beneficiary groups, including women, a spatial planning \napproach,  district  level  implementation  arrangements,  and  a \npartnership between government, NGOs, CBOs, and beneficiaries \nin  prioritization  and  delivery  of  project  activities  are  distinct \nfeatures of the Project. \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost is $62.50 million equivalent, of which \n$10.65 million is the foreign exchange cost and $51.85 million \nequivalent is the local currency cost. \n \n   \nFinancing Plan \n \n($ million) \nForeign  Local \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total Cost  % \nAsian Development Bank  10.65  39.35  50.00  80.0 \nBeneficiaries  0.00  1.25  1.25  2.0 \nGovernment  0.00  11.25  11.25  18.0 \n         \nTotal  10.65  51.85  62.50  100.0 \nAsian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "  v\nLoan Amount and Terms  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a \nloan  of  various  currencies  of  SDR37,885,000  ($50  million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with \nan interest charge of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% per \nyear thereafter. ADB will finance 100% of the foreign exchange \ncost  of  the  Project  and  76%  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment will finance about $11.25 million equivalent in local \ncurrency. The Government\u2019s share includes financing of all taxes \nand duties. Beneficiaries will contribute about $1.25 million for civil \nworks.  \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A  provincial  coordination  unit  (PCU)  located  within  the  Local \nArrangements  Government Department in Karachi will provide coordination of \nproject activities undertaken by the Sindh Katchi Abadis Authority \n(SKAA)  at  the  district  level  with  primarily  a  supportive  and \nfacilitating role. The PCU will be responsible for policy guidance, \nconsultant/NGO recruitment, procurement, and consolidation of \nproject progress and financial reports, and will support monitoring \nand evaluation as well as ADB review missions. In each of the \ndistricts, PIOs within the district government will work alongside \nthe  respective  lead  NGOs  and  be  responsible  for  the \nimplementation of the Project. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Local Government Department of the Government of Sindh \n   \nProcurement  All  procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Vehicles, \nequipment,  and  materials  will  be  procured  by  international \ncompetitive  bidding  where  the  cost  is  valued  at  more  than \n$500,000 equivalent or by international shopping where the cost is \nvalued from $100,000 to $500,000. Direct purchase will be applied \nfor procurement of goods and materials estimated to cost less \nthan $100,000. The civil works to be contracted under the Project \nare limited to the district link roads. These works lend themselves \nto  local  competitive  bidding  as  the  contracts  will  be  small, \nscattered over four districts, and phased over the implementation \nperiod. The civil works for settlement infrastructure improvement, \nas well as for the village link roads, will be generally carried out by \nSKAA  and  the  concerned  CBO,  which  will  procure  materials, \nmachinery  hire,  and  labor  directly  from  local  sources,  using \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n   \n ", "  vi \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \nConsulting  services  are  required  in  the  areas  of  project \nmanagement,  legal  and  accounting  matters,  social  aspects, \nparticipatory agricultural extension and household technologies, \ngender issues, and civil engineering. The quality and cost-based \nselection method will be used. The services of domestic NGOs \nare  required  in  screening  priority  investments,  community \ndevelopment  activities,  agricultural  and  household  technology \ndissemination,  awareness-raising  campaigns  relative  to  the \nregistration and issuance of national identity cards, and instituting \nsimple accounting systems between haris and landlords. To the \nextent possible, prequalified NGOs will be contracted on the basis \nof competitive bidding procedures. Where the number of qualified \nNGOs is limited, direct selection may be applied with the prior \napproval of ADB. \n \nProject Benefits and  Improved, more participatory extension services will reach village \nBeneficiaries  groups  and  support  their  adoption  of  new  farm  technologies. \nDissemination  of  appropriate  household  technologies  will \nspecifically  benefit  women:  the  introduction  of  labor-saving \ndevices will contribute to women\u2019s well-being and changes in time \nallocation. The Project\u2019s strong focus on improving literacy will \nfurther  empower  the  beneficiaries,  as  the  selected  topics  will \nprovide direct access to up-to-date information in fields relevant to \ntheir  daily  lives.  The  rural  transport  infrastructure  will  improve \nphysical access to very poor villages and reduce transportation \ncosts. The small-scale village level infrastructure will benefit entire \nfamilies as improved water and sanitation infrastructure, coupled \nwith  respective  awareness-raising  measures,  will  improve  the \nhygiene and health situation in the villages. Of the total population \nbenefiting  from  various  project  interventions,  60\u2013100% will be \npoor. Of the quantifiable benefits from the Project, 60% will accrue \nto the poor. \n   \n \n \n ", "  vii \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sindh Rural Development Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis1 \n2.  The rural sector underpins the economic and social structure of the economy of Pakistan. The \nagriculture sector contributes about 25% of gross domestic product, is the source of 74% of exports,2 \nand  provides  direct  employment  for  about  44%  of  the  workforce.  Despite  the  introduction  of \nmacroeconomic structural reforms in the latter half of the 1990s, there are major concerns about \nagricultural productivity and growth, with sector growth of about 3.7% only just exceeding population \ngrowth of 2.5% annually over the past decade. The rural, nonfarm sector is a major contributor to the \neconomy, but performance in this sector has been equally restrained. This has adversely affected the \nlivelihoods and growth prospects for all 68% of households living in the rural areas of the country. \nMajor challenges remain if real economic and social progress is to be attained, including (i) reducing \npoverty,  (ii) improving  governance,  (iii) extending  fiscal  reforms,  (iv) improving  the  balance  of \npayments  situation,  (v) restoring  investor  confidence,  (vi) accelerating  economic  growth,  and \n(vii) improving social indicators.  \n \n3.  Poverty in Pakistan has a significant rural dimension, and addressing the poverty situation \nrepresents a major policy focus into the next decade. Levels of poverty fell during the 1980s, while the \nnumber of poor more than doubled during the 1990s. The number of poor was estimated in June \n1999 as 45 million or one third of the population, in 6.3 million households.3 Of these, 33 million or \n73% (4.7 million households) are estimated to live in rural areas. These figures, significant as they \nare, mask the actual extent of poverty in rural Pakistan as \u201cpoverty\u201d is now recognized as not merely \nan  income-related  phenomenon.  Poverty  is  also  reflected  in  deprivation  of  key  quality  of  life \nopportunities, with feelings of vulnerability and powerlessness the most important intangibles that \nshape the lives of the poor. The denial of people\u2019s basic rights by public officials, nonimplementation \nof protective measures and legislation, substandard service delivery, and a lack of access to fair and \naffordable grievance-settlement mechanisms, including courts, all further  exacerbate feelings of \nvulnerability.  \n \n4.  Poverty levels are high in Sindh: 37% of the population live below the poverty line; 20% of the \nurban and 53% of the rural population are poor.4 While economic growth in the farm and nonfarm \nsectors is a necessary condition for improving rural livelihoods, this growth must have a core pro-poor \ndimension  if  it  is  to  generate  significant  improvements  in  the  livelihoods  of  the  agricultural \ncommunities in rural Sindh (Appendix 1). Here, structural rigidities, imbalance in access to resources, \nthe differential impacts of the introduction of new technologies, weak governance, and a lack of \nempowerment constrain any benefits of sector economic growth from \u201ctrickling down\u201d to the majority \nof the population, which consists of the over half of households that do not own agricultural land, and \nthe further one quarter of households that own 2 hectares (ha) or less.  \n                                                 \n1  Project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) was provided under (i) ADB. 1998.

Small-Scale Technical Assistance \n(SSTA) to Pakistan for the Additional Preparatory Work on the Sindh Rural Development Project. \n2  Made up of exports of agricultural commodities (13%) and exports of agricultural manufactured products (61%). \n3  The reviewed official poverty line is estimated at 2,350 calories per adult/day (2,150 calories for urban adults, 2,450 \ncalories for rural adults), PRs670 per capita per month, and $0.56 per capita per day based on the average \nexchange rate for 1998/99. \n4  Head count, estimated from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 1996/97 records.

The four districts (of Badin, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, and Thatta) have a combined rural \npopulation of about 4.6 million in 0.8 million households, or 27% of the rural population of Sindh \nprovince.  Poverty  is  widespread  throughout  the  four  districts.  According  to  nationwide \ncomparative rankings of social indicators, none of the four districts was found in the first or \nsecond quartile, two were in the third, and two were in the bottom quartile. Badin appeared as the \npoorest district in Sindh. Health and education indicators are very poor. Adult literacy rates are \n10.5% for women and 34.7% for men. Rural link roads are in urgent need of upgrading. Only \n10.5% of the rural population has access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Drinking water is \nthe major expressed need of the rural poor. Women participate in  agricultural work, are fully \nresponsible for the livestock, and manage the household and children, but are largely bypassed \nby extension services. Levels of household indebtedness are high.5 Technologies, transportation, \nand  market  linkages  are  also  very  poor.  This  situation  is  compounded  through  insufficient \nsupplies of irrigation water to meet demand, droughts, and other natural calamities.  \n \n6.  A majority of rural households in the four districts do not own agricultural or homestead \nland. Tenant farms alone represent 44% of all private farms. Of those who do own land in rural \nareas, fewer than 20% are large landlords6 but this group owns over 60% of the private farms.7 \nThe existing sharecropping tenancy system, concentrated in the canal-irrigated areas of the four \ndistricts, is historically deep-rooted and perpetuates the deeply entrenched poverty of tenants and \nagricultural labor through unbalanced revenue-sharing and cost-sharing arrangements (Appendix \n2, paras. 11\u201313, Table A2.2) and a complex system of dependencies. Changes over time, the \ninflux of migrants, and the introduction of modern technologies have altered the relationship to the \ndisadvantage of the  hari.8 The landlord meets the  haris\u2019 needs (e.g., for agricultural inputs, \nconsumption,  social  events,  emergencies)  through  advances,  with  the  accounts  of  these \ntransactions kept by him, and often not transparent. However, even if these accounts were \nmanaged openly, haris\u2019 extremely low literacy rate would inhibit their control over the entries. The \ndebt accumulates over the years. Haris cannot leave the landlord without clearing their debt, and \nbecome bonded.9 The bonded labor issue is politically sensitive and discussing it has frequently \nbeen interpreted as threatening the existing power structure. Innumerable dialogues between \nvarious actors10 indicate some inclination to begin changing the system.  \n \n7.  The existing legal framework provides the basis for such changes and most of the relevant \nlegislation is in place, though sometimes outdated. The Constitution of Pakistan, 1973; the Bonded \nLabour System (Abolition) Act, 1992 (BLA) and implementing Rules, 1995; and several international \ntreaties that Pakistan has ratified\u2014all prohibit forced labor in any form. Applicability of the BLA  to \nagricultural labor is under review. The main law governing land and land revenue administration is the \nLand Revenue Act, 1967 and its implementing Rules, 1968 (LRA). The Sindh Tenancy Act, 1950 \n(STA) is arguably the most important for the haris. The Act was an attempt to address issues of \nsecurity of tenure, and define the tenant\u2019s share of the agricultural produce and the responsibility for \n                                                 \n5  For example, a survey of 136 households in six villages in Sanghar revealed that 83% of households had outstanding \nloans at an average of PRs14,000.  \n6  With at least 10 ha of land. \n7  Agricultural Census 1990. More recent data are not yet available. \n8  The Sindh Tenancy Act, 1950 (STA) uses the terms hari and tenant synonymously defining a tenant as a person who \npersonally cultivates the land of another person (the landlord). This document uses the term hari for a tenant/sharecropper. \n9  \u201cBonded labor\u201d refers to a laborer who has forfeited the right to move and to seek employment elsewhere because of \ndebt incurred with a creditor; in agriculture, most often with the landlord. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, \n1992 provides a long definition.  \n10  The International Labour Organization (ILO) is currently implementing a subregional project on debt bondage. \nNongovernment organizations (NGOs), especially the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, started advocacy \nactivities against bonded labor in the early 1990s. An important part of SSTA 3725-PAK (footnote 1) was discussion \non this issue with a variety of stakeholders in the project area. \n ", "  3 \ninputs.11 The Acts no longer reflect contemporary circumstances and needs, and the level of \ncompliance is low. Considerable substantial and procedural gaps, in particular regarding record \nkeeping and grievance settlement, exist. The Federal and provincial governments are making efforts \nto improve the situation. The Federal Government\u2019s  National Policy and Plan of Action for the \nAbolition  of  Bonded  Labour  and  Rehabilitation  of  Freed  Bonded  Labourers  is  currently  being \nimplemented. The Action Plan of the Taskforce for the Improved Implementation of the Land \nRevenue Act (2001) includes the maintenance of revenue and survey records, computerization, and \ntraining of revenue staff. Amendments to the tenancy legislation and to its implementation and \nsupervisory mechanism are of paramount importance for improvements in rural livelihoods.12  \n \n8.  Governance has emerged as  one of Pakistan\u2019s foremost development concerns. On 14 \nAugust 2001, a new integrated three-tier local government system was installed. The Government is \nrelying on its devolution program to promote competition, ownership, and accountability in the delivery \nof public services, and on the active involvement of people in community issues. This is a major \nopportunity for more people-centered, rights- and responsibility-based government structures, but \nrisks relate to weak technical and institutional capacity to handle the diverse set of functions involved, \nthe reluctance of provincial governments to devolve administrative and financial powers, and the \nlikelihood of control by local elites. The large group of the rural poor, particularly women, is only \nminimally represented in civil society organizations, and the rural poor lack the power to exercise their \nbasic rights or to access public services. Community-based organizations (CBOs) will have to \nincrease their efforts to enhance social processes. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are required \nin supporting the interests and developing the capacities of CBOs. A comprehensive study of NGO \nand CBO capacities13 shows that NGOs in Sindh have demonstrated their capacity to work in difficult \ncircumstances and remote areas. However, their area coverage is limited, while cooperation with \neach other and with government, as well as their managerial capacities, need to be further developed.  \n \n9.  The design of the Project in southern Sindh therefore takes into consideration (i) the complex \nsocial, cultural, legal, and political environment, in particular the feudal relationship between landlords, \nharis, and landless laborers; (ii) the importance of confidence building and awareness raising of legal \nrights and obligations among beneficiaries, landlords, and local government, and of compliance with \nexisting  legislation;  (iii) the  need  to  address  key  constraints  limiting  livelihood  enhancement \nopportunities of the target population (e.g., levels of literacy, access to appropriate technology, and \ncommunity infrastructure needs); (iv) the overall capacity of the Sindh government and the new \ndistrict governments, NGOs, and other agencies, and the need for clear definition of their roles and \ncoordination between concerned agencies; and (v) appropriate arrangements for the management of \nthe Project, taking into account the devolution process.  \n \n10.  Important aspects therefore incorporated in the design of the proposed Project include (i) the \ncritical  need  to  address  the  power  imbalance  between  different  stakeholder  groups  as  a  key \nimprovement in governance; (ii) social mobilization of beneficiary groups to enable adoption of a \ndemand-driven  approach  to  village  development  and  livelihood  improvement;  (iii) increased \nbeneficiary participation, including that of women, in the identification, construction, and operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of facilities; (iv) support from experienced NGOs and district government offices \nin a partnership approach to project implementation; and (v) the need to plan and implement project \nactivities at the local level.  \n \n                                                 \n11  Further analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n12  In the context of SSTA 3725-PAK (footnote 1) appropriate amendments to the STA and its implementing Rules have been \nprepared and were discussed in a series of intensive consultations leading to section-by-section recommendations for \namendments. Stakeholders in the project area recognized that the lack of accurate account keeping is the basis of many \ncontroversies and disputes, and needs to be addressed on a priority basis. Promulgation of amendments to the STA and of \nthe Sindh Tenancy Rules, 2002 was a condition for loan negotiations. \n13  This study was undertaken as part of SSTA 3725-PAK (footnote 1) and is provided in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n ", "4  \n11.  During the 1990s, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other funding agencies had varied \nand extensive involvement in the agriculture and rural development sector. These  interventions \n(Appendix 3) aimed at enhancing agricultural productivity, promoting market-oriented policy reforms, \nstrengthening the institutional framework, and developing resource-scarce areas of the country. \nExperience suggests that, generally, project impact is reduced when there is an inadequate focus on \nconsultation with beneficiaries, ownership, flexibility in project design, sequencing and prioritization, \ncapacity, centralized controls, dysfunctional systems of the project implementing agencies, and post \nproject O&M.14 Therefore, the Project ensures (i) fuller participation of beneficiaries in project design \nand implementation leading to greater ownership, (ii) a process approach, (iii) decentralized and \nlocalized implementation arrangements with capacity support to government and community groups \nin implementation and maintenance, and (iv) use of robust technology. \n \n12.  The Project is in line with the Government\u2019s vision and development goals articulated in the \nTen-Year  Perspective  Development Plan  2001-11  and  its  poverty  reduction  strategy.15  ADB\u2019s \nstrategy is based on Pakistan\u2019s development goals and priorities for poverty reduction. It also \nincorporates ADB\u2019s overarching development objective of poverty reduction and lessons learned from \npast operational experience in Pakistan. Recognizing that greater participation of people requires a \ncivil society able to take over responsibilities within an environment conducive to opposition and \ndiffering  opinions,  the  Project  combines  interventions  to  improve  livelihood  and  services  with \nmeasures empowering the target groups through improved laws, better compliance with legislation, \nand improved access to justice. \n \n13.  The Project is complementary to four ongoing ADB loans and two pipeline projects. A \nprogram to improve agriculture sector productivity and profitability is being implemented, and a \nmicrofinance facility is just commencing.16 Some major governance issues in a legal context are \nbeing addressed, the rural access road network of Sindh is being improved, and the access to the \npublic elementary school system in Sindh is being increased.17 One other project to support the \ndevolution process of the Government is in preparation.18  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n14.  The overall goal of the Project is to reduce poverty in four districts in southern Sindh through \nincreasing empowerment and improving governance, improving access of the rural poor to public \nservices, transferring technology for improved livelihoods, and providing essential infrastructure. The \nobjective of the Project is to improve the social status and economic well-being of the poorest groups \nin the project area19 with a focus on the following target groups (i) haris and agricultural laborers, \n(ii) marginal owners-cum-tenants (with less than 2 ha), and (iii) small village-based artisans. There \nwill be a particular focus on women as the most disadvantaged among the target groups.  \n                                                 \n14 For this reason, ADB. 2002.

The Project Framework (Appendix 4) has been developed through extensive consultation with \nthe  target  groups,  stakeholder  organizations,  and  the  government  of  Sindh  during  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) and small-scale technical assistance (SSTA), and further \nrefined during stakeholder workshops. There are five components (i) improved governance and legal \nsupport,  (ii) enhanced  social  processes  at  the  community  level,  (iii) improved  rural  livelihoods, \n(iv) upgraded rural infrastructure and settlement improvement, and (v) project management support. \nSpecific project interventions are targeted toward women. \n \n1.  Improved Governance and Legal Support \n \n16.  The Project will strengthen its investment components and community-based improvement of \nrural livelihoods through a rights-based approach to development. This will be done by (i) improved \nrecognition of and compliance with stakeholders\u2019 rights and obligations, (ii) capacity-building and \ninstitutional  support  for  district  government  and  other  stakeholders,  and  (iii) review  of  relevant \nlegislation.  \n \n17.  The Project will assist in preparing and implementing a large-scale awareness-raising and \nknowledge-dissemination campaign on issues such as the amended tenancy legislation, land revenue \nlegislation and forms, debt bondage, the importance of registration as a tenant, and national identity \ncards (NICs). The campaign will include the translation of relevant legislation into local languages, \nmedia  campaigns,  and  community-based  training  and  workshops  with  relevant  stakeholders, \nincluding vigilance committees.20 To improve access to the justice system, the Project will train \nparalegals, directly support the provision of legal advice, and facilitate legal-aid referral initiatives.  \n \n18.  One of the main areas of contention with regard to the implementation of the STA is the lack \nof proper account keeping between landlords and haris. The Project will develop, demonstrate, and \nutilize a simple account-keeping system in the project area, including the replication of account-\nkeeping materials. The amended STA  gives the responsibility for  hearing tenancy disputes to a \nrevenue officer at a higher level. The success of this will be evaluated in year three of the Project \n(para. 58).  \n \n19.  Civil society will actively monitor project activities in this component, in particular the \nissuance of NICs and sanads (property deeds) and the updating of land and tenancy records in \nvillages where improved settlement activities are undertaken. The monitors will have access to \nrecords of relevance to these activities, including those relating to NICs, field books, and village \nforms of the revenue administration, and issuance of sanads by the Board of Revenue (BOR).  \n \n20.  To address the low level of compliance with the LRA, in particular the updating and \nmaintenance of land records, the Project will link with the government of Sindh's Action Plan for \nImprovement in Revenue Administration through training and the provision of enhanced mobility \nto improve supervision and verification of field records. The Project will train 575 tapedars21 and \nsupervisory tapedars in the preparation of land and tenancy records. In addition, the proposed \nRevenue Academy or the National Institute for Public Administration will train 40 mukhtiarkars,22 \ndistrict  revenue  officers,  and  instructors,  who  in  turn  will  provide  further  training,  including \nrefresher courses, to the 575 tapedars and supervisory tapedars at the Tapedar College or the \nproposed Revenue Academy. The updating of land records will be evaluated at the midterm \n                                                 \n20  Vigilance committees are established under the BLA at the district level and chaired by the zila nazim (mayor/head of \nthe district government).  \n21  Revenue collector at the lowest administrative level (deh) of the BOR. \n22  Administrator of the BOR at taluka or subdistrict level. \n ", "6  \nreview of the Project. Project support to computerization23 will be conditional on the extent to \nwhich land records have been updated and maintained in the first 3 years of the Project. \n \n21.  The Project will also support the review of and, if needed, the drafting of amendments to \nlegislation with a potential high impact on agricultural labor, including legislation on social security, \nworking conditions, minimum wages, the Industrial Relations Ordinance, and other labor-related \nlegislation.  \n \n2.  Enhanced Social Processes at the Community Level \n \n22.  The population in rural Sindh is extremely scattered24 and lives in very small settlements. \nIn the four districts, only 35.2% of the rural population live in villages of 50 households and above \n(Appendix 5, Table A5.1). To improve outreach to the poor target population and assure effective \nuse of investments, a thorough process of selecting villages for project interventions will be \napplied (Appendix 5). One \u201clead\u201d NGO per district will be selected to support the CBOs in their \ncommunity interventions. A more intensive level of intervention will be applied for a subset of \nvillages  through  a  holistic  approach  to  improved  settlement  (village  planning,  small-scale \ninfrastructure, and village link roads).  \n \n23.  The process of selecting the groups of villages that will participate in the various levels of \nproject activities will be explained and discussed in two workshops in each district\u2014the first to \nintroduce the process and raise awareness of the issues, and the second to explain the selection \nprocess and the results. A second series of workshops will introduce the Project to CBOs \noperating in the area. Awareness-raising campaigns and delivery of services to village groups will \nbe accompanied by an intensive process of practice-oriented capacity building for CBOs to \nenable them to function more effectively, and to extend their outreach. It is expected that some \n640 CBOs will be directly strengthened, and that these will provide support and capacity-building \nservices to around 3,200 village groups (at least one third of them women\u2019s groups).  \n \n24.  A  comprehensive  package  for  functional  and  numeric  literacy  will  be  developed, \nconsisting of state-of-the-art training manuals and teaching and learning materials (e.g., booklets, \nposters). The package will be appropriate for the training of head trainers from each district \ngovernment\u2019s new executive district office for literacy and the office for community development. \nHead trainers will provide training to trainers from the CBOs and the district government. CBOs \nand the district government will provide training of functional and numeric literacy for village \ngroups. It is anticipated that head training programs will be organized around four workshops and \nabout 48 head trainers (24 of them female), followed by 32 district-level training programs, each \nwith about 40 participants (at least 20 of them women) attached to CBOs. These will provide \nliteracy training to an estimated 3,200 village groups. \n \n3.  Improved Rural Livelihoods \n \n25.  In  the  project  area,  wheat  is  the  predominant  crop,  followed  by  cotton,  rice,  and \nsugarcane. Southern Sindh is also a major producer of vegetable crops (onion and chilies) and \nfruits. Marginal farmers tend to concentrate on wheat, cotton, rice, and fodder crops. Haris \nproduce whatever the landlord decides on. Livestock production is an important element of the \nfarming system and haris and marginal farmers keep animals as part of their subsistence \nstrategy. Improvements in rural livelihoods will be carried out through four main groups of needs-\nbased community activities (i) strengthening agricultural support services, (ii) improving livestock \nmanagement, (iii) introducing appropriate farm and household technologies, and (iv) improving \naccess to institutional credit.  \n                                                 \n23  The precise needs for computers and/or survey equipment will be agreed at the time of the midterm review. \n24  Overall, Sindh has 66,923 rural settlements. \n ", "  7 \n26.  Strengthening  agricultural  support  services  will  incorporate  participatory  extension \ntechniques  backed  up  by  technical  training  in  crop  production,  livestock  management,  and \nimproved irrigation water use. This training will involve exposure visits for CBOs and staff of the \ndistrict government office for agriculture to provincial and national research institutes, followed by \nestablishing 1,600 demonstrations in villages, together with a similar number of field days. \nImproved seed will be introduced in the project area and its multiplication promoted with seed \nblocks established in 1,600 villages, along with associated training in the use and storage of the \nimproved seed. Improved milk collection systems will be introduced through visits to demonstrate \nthe operation of comparable systems in other areas of Sindh and the Punjab, followed by \nworkshops organized to transfer this information to target farmers. In addition, the Project will \nprovide resources to review, improve, and distribute extension manuals to assist and support \nCBOs in agricultural and livestock extension.  \n \n27.  To improve livestock management (including the diagnosis of diseases) 300 youths selected \nfrom the target villages, as village-based livestock workers, will be trained. Once trained, these \nworkers will provide their own villages and surrounding villages with information on improved livestock \nmanagement, as well as undertaking fee-based services in disease prevention, diagnosis, and first \naid. Linkages with Khushhalibank (KB) will allow these workers to expand their operations. In \naddition, the Project will target village women, offering training in livestock management through \n1,600 training workshops to be held in the villages, and 1,600 refresher courses. \n \n28.  The  Project  will  support  village-level  demonstrations  and  transfer  of  appropriate \ntechnologies (e.g., energy-saving stoves, storage facilities, preservation of food) for individual \nhouseholds. Demonstrations of appropriate household technologies will involve 1,600 village-\nlevel workshops. Training on appropriate technologies for vegetable gardening will be organized \nthrough  1,600  workshops,  and  information  on  interventions  proven  in  the  project  area \ndisseminated, as income-diversification opportunities will be shared among lead NGOs and \nCBOs through six annual workshops and 12 biannual district fairs. \n \n29.  The Project will develop and support the extension of linkages between the target groups \nand KB25 for credit. KB will have branches in each of the project districts by the end of 2002. Lead \nNGOs under the Project will apply to become KB service providers. They would link their partner \nCBOs to credit from KB, to meet the needs of the target groups. Orientation sessions for CBOs \nwill familiarize them with the procedural requirements of accessing KB funds. \n \n4.  Upgraded Rural Infrastructure and Settlement Improvement \n \n30.  A major component of the Project relates to upgrading rural infrastructure, carefully focusing \nactivities in locations impacting most on the target groups and following set criteria  (Appendix 5). To \ndeliver investments that benefit the target groups directly, the Project will only support subprojects \nprioritized through a participatory approach and reflecting needs identified by the communities. Roads \nto be improved under the Project will complement ongoing or planned road improvement projects in \nSindh.26  \n \n31.  Two types of rural roads will be upgraded under the Project. First, around 750 kilometers \n(km) of \u201cvillage link roads\u201d will connect selected villages directly to the district road or provincial \nhighway network, or to the nearest district link road upgraded under the Project, or to another \n                                                 \n25  A number of providers of microcredit exist in the project area, e.g., Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund providing \nsubstantial funds to NGOs (e.g., National Rural Support Programme and Sindh Agricultural and Forestry Workers \nCoordinating Organization) for onlending; Khushhalibank (KB), as part of Loan 1805/1806-PAK (footnote 16) started \nits lending activities in Sanghar in September 2001.  \n26  For example, ADB\u2019s ongoing Road Sector Development Program, the Khushal Pakistan Program, and a program \ncurrently being formulated by the Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n ", "8  \nneighboring village itself connected to a district link road improved by the Project. Second, for \nselected clusters of project villages interconnected by village link roads, the Project will provide \nfor some 200 km of bituminous \u201cdistrict link roads\u201d that will connect the cluster to the district road \nnetwork. In general, district link roads and village link roads will follow existing alignments, but \nwith flexible geometric design standards to avoid land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. \n \n32.  Settlement infrastructure improvement will encompass the provision/upgrading of domestic \ndrinking water supplies using different tested models such as shallow dugwells or small-scale tubewells \nconnected to hand pumps in fresh groundwater areas and reservoirs for surface water diverted from \nirrigation canals and subsequently filtered in saline groundwater areas. Wastewater drainage systems \nwill be upgraded and localized village infrastructure (e.g., village lanes) improved. The holistic model \nof the Sindh Katchi Abadis Authority (SKAA)27 will use participatory processes with village-level \nplanning as an entry point to identify, prioritize, execute, and maintain subprojects. It is anticipated \nthat 450 smaller villages (of 50\u2013100 households) and 300 larger villages (of 100\u2013200 households) will \nbenefit from this subcomponent.  Sanads will be issued on completion of improvement works. \n \n5.  Project Management Support \n \n33.  Project management services will support timely implementation (Appendix 6). This will \ninclude  (i) engaging  consultants  and  NGOs;  (ii) procuring  vehicles  and  equipment;  and \n(iii) establishing accounting, monitoring, and reporting systems.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n34.  The Project has a number of unique and important features of design and arrangements \nin  implementation  including  (i) clear  targeting  of  project  components  to  specific  beneficiary \ngroups; (ii) focus on women according to a clearly defined gender strategy and plan (Appendix 7); \n(iii) demand-driven identification and prioritization combined with a spatial planning approach to \nproject  interventions;  (iv) district  level  implementation  arrangements;  and  (v) a  partnership \nbetween government, NGOs, CBOs, and beneficiaries in project activities. \n  \n35.  The Project will apply a comprehensive set of selection criteria for its interventions to assure \noutreach to the target groups. To meet spatial concerns, more intensive interventions such as \nsettlement infrastructure improvement, will only take place in villages meeting an additional set of \nsecondary criteria. These villages are considered as future \u201cgrowth poles\u201d, where services should be \nmore concentrated to attract people from the small and scattered villages (Appendix 5).  \n  \n36.  Project activities are programmed, coordinated, and implemented at the district level in \nsupport of the Government\u2019s devolution process, with project coordination being a provincial task. \nFunctions  of  detailed  planning,  preparing  annual  work  programs,  selecting  target  villages, \nimplementing subcomponents, and monitoring project activities will be at the district level and \nbelow. Implementation will involve a partnership between a lead NGO selected for each district \nand the district government, while thematic NGOs, provincial agencies, and specialized institutes \nwill provide capacity building and backstopping as required. The focus is therefore on capacity \nbuilding at the district level of both NGOs and district government, with strong linkages to the \nCBOs, which are the focal point for both identifying needs and priorities, and for service delivery. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n37.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at about $62.50 million equivalent, including \nphysical and price contingencies, taxes, and duties. Of the total cost, $10.65 million (17%) \n                                                 \n27  Sindh Katchi Abadis Authority (SKAA) was established in 1987 as a semiautonomous organization; administratively it \nis under the Local Government Department.  \n ", "  9 \ncomprises the foreign exchange cost, and $51.85  million  equivalent  (83%)  comprises  local \ncurrency cost including taxes and duties.

Financing Plan \n38.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $50 million  equivalent  from  its  Asian \nDevelopment Fund resources. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an interest charge of 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year during \nthe remaining term. ADB will finance 80% of the project cost including 100% of the foreign \nexchange  cost  ($10.65  million)  and  76%  of  the  local  currency  cost  ($39.35  million).  The \nGovernment  will  finance  $11.25  million  equivalent  of  local  currency  cost.  Beneficiaries  will \ncontribute about 2% in cash or labor (Table 2 and Appendix 8).   \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total Cost  % \nAsian Development Bank  10.65  39.35  50.00  80 \nBeneficiaries  0.00  1.25  1.25  2 \nGovernment  0.00  11.25  11.25  18 \nTotal  10.65  51.85  62.50  100 \n     Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management and Coordination \n \n39.  The Executing Agency will be the Local Government Department (LGD) of the government of \nSindh. The LGD will establish the provincial coordination unit (PCU) within the LGD in Karachi, and it \nwill be headed by a project coordinator supported by a full-time deputy project coordinator.28 The PCU \n                                                 \n28  It is understood that the project coordinator has already been appointed.  \n ", "10  \nwill provide interagency and interdistrict coordination to project activities of SKAA and at the district \nlevel. The PCU will primarily have a supportive and facilitation role and will be responsible for policy \nguidance, consultant/NGO recruitment, procurement, consolidation of project progress and financial \nreports, and support monitoring and evaluation as well as ADB review missions. The PCU will \nestablish its own work plan and include a work plan agreed with SKAA. An important responsibility will \nalso be facilitating the sharing of interdistrict experience and the identification of best practices and \nlessons learned. The PCU will serve as the secretariat of the steering committee and the focal point \nfor liaison between the Government and ADB. It is anticipated that apart from the deputy project \ncoordinator, the PCU will have a full-time professional staff of three, strengthened by 15 person-\nmonths of international consulting services in management support. \n \n40.  A provincial steering committee (PSC) will be established prior to loan effectiveness. It will \nbe chaired by the additional chief secretary, planning and development department, with the \nfollowing  members  (i) secretary  local  government;  (ii) secretary  finance;  (iii) secretary labor; \n(iv) director general SKAA; (v) the four district coordination officers from the project districts; \n(vi) appropriate  NGO  representation;29  (vii) one  KB  board  member;  (viii) project coordinator; \n(ix) senior  chief  (poverty  alleviation),  planning  and  development  department;  and  (x) deputy \nproject coordinator. The PSC will offer guidance on legal and governance initiatives, resolve \ninteragency problems, and provide policy guidance as needed.30  \n \n41.  A separate project implementation office (PIO) will be established in each district with the \ndistrict coordination officer being the ex-officio project director. The  executive district officer, \ncommunity development, will serve as the deputy project director with two full-time staff (project \nofficer and accountant), support staff, and facilities. Other officers from the relevant district \ngovernment offices will liaise with the PIO as needed. This structure is intended to ensure \nefficiency and control within the Project while fostering and maintaining clear communications and \neffective cooperation with the various entities involved in project implementation.  \n \n42.  Zila project committees (ZPCs) chaired by the  zila nazim  will play an active role in \nimplementation of the Project. Each ZPC should comprise the district coordination officer, the \nexecutive district officers of the district government offices for works and services, revenue, \nliteracy, finance and planning, community development, and agriculture; the Project\u2019s gender \nspecialist and representatives from SKAA, the lead NGO, and two thematic NGOs. The ZPCs will \nensure that all components are implemented efficiently and effectively and that the anticipated \noutcomes at district level are achieved. Specifically, the ZPCs will (i) endorse villages selected for \nproject interventions in accordance with the primary selection criteria, (ii) review implementation \nof partnership arrangements with NGOs/CBOs, (iii) approve the annual work program and budget \nprepared by the PIO, (iv) review and approve draft quarterly and draft annual reports to be \nsubmitted to the PCU, (v) monitor the implementation of project activities and outcomes, and \n(vi) formulate solutions to impediments to project implementation. The project organization and \ncoordination chart is in Appendix 9. \n   \n2.  Project Components \n \na.  Improved Governance and Legal Support \n \n43.  The PCU will contract a public relations firm, a thematic NGO, or a specialized institute to \ndevelop an awareness-raising and dissemination campaign, including campaign materials. The public \nrelations firm, thematic NGO or institute  will orient the lead NGO and train staff of CBOs and selected  \n                                                 \n29  Two representatives of lead NGOs in each meeting will alternate with the representatives from the other two districts. \n30  It will meet as necessary, but not less than quarterly in the first 2 years of project implementation, and semiannually \nthereafter. \n ", " 11 \ngovernment officials at the district and taluka levels on the content of the campaign and the use of the \nmaterials. The trainees will then implement the campaign with the lead NGO providing the overall \nguidance in each district. Each lead NGO will include male and female paralegals among its staff. The \nPCU will contract a thematic NGO or specialized institute to provide intensive training to these \nparalegals, both in the prevalent laws and how to provide legal advice. Paralegals will provide initial \nlegal advice, and if necessary, will link beneficiaries needing further legal assistance to lawyers who \ncan provide legal aid.31 A national human rights organization with extensive experience in political and \nlegal monitoring through core groups working at the field level, acceptable to the government of Sindh \nand ADB, will be invited to actively monitor project activities. The monitors will be provided with \ntraining and allowances to cover travel costs by the project.  \n \nb.  Enhanced Social Processes at the Community Level \n \n44.  The PCU will contract the four lead NGOs to provide linkages with district and provincial \ngovernments, and assure common understanding and coordinated service delivery.32 The PIO will \n(i) identify villages, together with the lead NGO, according to set criteria; (ii) coordinate between the \nProject, CBOs, and target groups; (iii) identify and strengthen CBOs through targeted capacity-\nbuilding measures; (iv) assist CBOs deciding to pursue registration as citizen community boards33 in \nthe formalities involved in the process; (v) establish mechanisms assuring information dissemination \nand timely provision of support; and (vi) assist in setting up a district-level system for monitoring and \nevaluation. Thematic NGOs will provide specialized inputs such as legal aspects, gender orientation, \ncapacity building, agricultural and livestock improvement training, and support to relevant local \ngovernment agencies and CBOs as identified by the PIO in consultation with the lead NGO. \nConsultants in organization development will assist PCUs, PIOs, lead NGOs, and CBOs.34  \n \n45.  CBOs  will  (i) identify  and  mobilize  village  groups;  (ii) build  community  links;  (iii) provide \nawareness-raising and numeric and functional literacy classes; (iv) assist in regularizing tenure for \nhousing, in obtaining NICs, and in registering as tenants; (v) assist village groups in obtaining support \nfrom PIO for infrastructure, agricultural inputs, livestock improvements, and improved housing; and \n(vi) facilitate the introduction and multiplication of improved seed. The numeric and functional literacy \ncourses will be prepared with the assistance of a local consultant in cooperation with a thematic NGO \nand the local government. The lead NGOs and representatives from CBOs will assist in field-testing \ncourses and teaching material.  \n \nc.  Improved Rural Livelihoods \n \n46.  District government offices and selected female lead NGO staff will be trained in participatory \nextension approaches and technical disciplines by specialized national and provincial institutes. The \ntraining  program  will  include  a  balance  of  participatory  extension  approaches  and  available \ntechnologies. Through NGOs, these trained staff will be used as trainers and resource persons to \ntransfer appropriate technology to the target group. Short-term consulting services will be provided to \nassist the specialized institute in developing and delivering the training program. The district government \noffice for agriculture and lead NGOs will implement those activities relating to agricultural and livestock \n                                                 \n31  The Project will facilitate access for legal aid referral initiatives to the Legal Empowerment Fund, a subfund of the \nAccess to Justice Development Fund under the ADB-funded Access to Justice Program. \n32  Detailed terms of reference for lead NGOs, including selection criteria, are in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n33  Citizen  community  boards  are  voluntary  groups  of  non-elected  citizens,  registered  under  the  Sindh  Local \nGovernance Ordinance, 2001, for proactive, self-help initiatives in development and improvement of service delivery \nat the local level. Citizen community boards are funded from voluntary contributions, grants, and endowments and \nreceive support from the local government through matching grants of up to 80% of the cost of a project; local \ngovernments are mandated to spend 25% of their development budgets through citizen community boards. \n34  The terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n ", "12  \nextension. To further support agricultural development, the PCU will recruit consultants to improve \ntechnical manuals suitable for the target group, which the PCU will reproduce for distribution. \n \n47.  The Project will train village-based livestock workers using appropriate provincial institutes. In \naddition, improved livestock management training for women, and training and demonstrations on \nimproved crop production will be conducted by the district government office for agriculture, lead \nNGOs, and the CBOs, which will utilize the services of trainers trained through the Project as \nresource persons. The introduction of appropriate household technologies  will follow the same \nimplementation pattern. The consultants recruited by the PCU will identify the technologies and will \ntrain staff of relevant district departments, of lead NGOs, and of CBOs as head trainers who will \ntransfer the technologies to the target group. \n \nd.  Upgraded Rural Infrastructure and Settlement Improvement \n \n48.  Implementation of the district link roads, which are selected by PIO in accordance with the set \ncriteria and which are included in the annual development plan of the district government, will be the \nresponsibility of the district government office for works and services, which will (i) conduct feasibility \nstudies and prepare detailed engineering designs, quantities, cost estimates, and tender documents; \n(ii) award construction  works to prequalified local contractors through local competitive bidding; \n(iii) supervise  contractors  during  implementation;  and  (iv) organize  the  O&M  of  the  improved \ninfrastructure.35  Domestic  consultants  recruited  by  the  PCU  in  consultation  with  the  district \ngovernment  will  assist  in  monitoring  design  standards,  undertake  environmental  assessments, \nmanage civil work contracts, and ensure effective construction supervision and quality control. \n \n49.  The villages eligible for infrastructure activities under the set criteria (Appendix 5) will be \nselected by SKAA in consultation with the concerned union council.36 Implementation of settlement \ninfrastructure improvement, and that of the village link roads, will be the responsibility of SKAA, in \ncooperation with the BOR, which will be responsible for the regularization of the selected villages and \nthe issuance of individual sanads. SKAA and the concerned CBO will facilitate a participatory \napproach where the village group will (i) identify/prioritize the interventions; (ii) prepare a settlement \ndevelopment  plan  and  draw  up  a  partnership  agreement  that  will  describe  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of the villagers, SKAA, and the CBO; and (iii) assist in the social mobilization required \nfor the execution of the civil works. SKAA will be responsible for the financial and administrative \nmanagement of the subproject. In consultation with the CBO and villagers, SKAA, working in \naccordance  with  its  standard  procedures,  will  prepare  detailed  designs,  quantities,  and  cost \nestimates. It will be responsible for (i) the execution and supervision of civil works, implemented \nthrough laborers and petty contractors recruited from the community; (ii) the financial management of \nthe subproject, including recruitment of the local petty contractors, hiring of laborers, and purchasing \nof  the  material;  and  (iii) together  with  the  CBO  organize  the  O&M  of  the  infrastructure  after \nconstruction.37  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n50.  The Project will be implemented over a 7-year period (2003\u20132009). The first year will be spent \nmainly in setting up the PCU and the PIOs, and in other preparatory tasks, including (i) preparation of \nwork and financial plans; and (ii) procurement of goods and services (consultants, NGOs, and other \nservice contractors).  Infrastructure  development  will  start  on  the  satisfactory  completion  of  the \nfollowing (i) village identification, (ii) social preparation of village groups, (iii) engineering plans and \ndesigns, and (iv) selection of the civil works contractors (Appendix 6). To minimize start-up delays, \nADB has approved advance action for the recruitment of consultants and lead NGOs.  \n                                                 \n35 The Sindh Environmental Protection Agency will be involved in required environmental impact assessments.  \n36 Lowest administrative level. \n37 SKAA will ensure that a government-approved testing laboratory will carry out drinking water quality monitoring. \n ", " 13 \n4.  Procurement \n \n51.  Goods and services financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will be \nprocured by international competitive bidding where the cost is valued at more than $500,000 \nequivalent, or by international shopping where the cost is valued from $100,000 to $500,000. \nDirect purchase will be applied for procurement of goods and materials estimated to cost less \nthan $100,000. Under the Project, international competitive bidding or international shopping will \nbe employed for vehicle procurement, as appropriate, and international shopping and direct \npurchase for office equipment, furniture and computers for the PCU and PIOs (Appendix 10).  \n \n52.  The civil works to be contracted by the district government under the Project are limited to the \ndistrict link roads. These works lend themselves to local competitive bidding as the contracts will be \nsmall, scattered over four districts, and phased over the implementation period and, as such, \nindividual contracts are unlikely to attract international bidders. The local capacity to undertake these \ncontracts is adequate and the civil works will be carried out by prequalified contractors through local \ncompetitive bidding in accordance with government procedures acceptable to ADB. The proposed \ncontract packaging for the  district link roads and draft bidding documents (common to the four \ndistricts) will be submitted to ADB for prior review and consideration. The civil works for settlement \ninfrastructure improvement, as well as for the village link roads, will be carried out by SKAA and the \nconcerned village group. Village groups, or SKAA on behalf of the village groups, will procure \nmaterials, machinery hire, and labor directly from local sources, using procedures acceptable to ADB. \nSingle procurement packages by village groups will be limited to a maximum of $10,000 each.   \n \n5.  Consulting and Nongovernment Organization Services \n \n53.  To ensure successful implementation and enhance capacities and technical expertise of \nthe district governments, consulting services are required. The Project will provide 521 person-\nmonths of specialized services (494 person-months of domestic consultants and 27 person-\nmonths of international consultants) in long-term and short-term appointments through consulting \nfirms and individual consultants. The quality and cost-based selection method will be used. The \nPCU will recruit and manage the consulting services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The services of domestic NGOs are required in community development activities, \nagricultural  and  household  technology  dissemination,  awareness-raising campaigns, and in \ninstituting simple account-keeping systems between haris and landlords. To the extent possible, \nprequalified NGOs will be contracted on the basis of competitive bidding procedures. Where the \nnumber of qualified NGOs is limited, direct selection may be applied with the prior approval of \nADB. The expertise required and outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n54.  The Government of Pakistan will pass on loan funds to the government of Sindh on the same \nterms  and  conditions  as  those  between  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  ADB.  To  expedite \ndisbursement and ensure timely execution of the Project, the LGD (PCU) will, immediately after loan \neffectiveness,  establish  a  first-generation  imprest  account  with  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan. \nPayments will be made to and from this account for eligible expenditure under the Project. Five \nsecond-generation imprest accounts will be opened by the PIOs at the National Bank of Pakistan in \neach of the four districts and by SKAA. These accounts will be used to meet eligible expenditures \nunder the Project incurred by the four PIOs and SKAA. The opening of all six of these imprest \naccounts will be subject to the appointment of qualified accounting staff and the establishment of \naccounting systems and internal control by the PCU, the four PIOs, and SKAA acceptable to ADB. \nEach imprest account will be managed by the PCU, the four PIOs, and SKAA in accordance with \n ", "14  \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001), and detailed arrangements agreed upon by \nthe Government and ADB. The initial combined total amount in all imprest accounts will not exceed 6 \nmonths of estimated expenditure and not more than 10% of the total loan amount. ADB\u2019s statement \nof expenditure procedures may be used to reimburse expenditures and liquidate imprest accounts \nfor payments below the ceiling of $100,000. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n55.  The PIOs and SKAA will provide the PCU with concise quarterly progress reports detailing the \nphysical and financial progress of activities against agreed-upon targets and summarizing  project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation results. The PCU will submit the consolidated quarterly \nprogress  reports  and  a  comprehensive  annual  progress  report  to  the  relevant  government \ndepartments, the Economic Affairs Division, and ADB. Within 3 months of project completion, a \nproject completion report in the standard ADB format will be prepared by the PCU and submitted to \nADB. The PCU, the PIOs, and SKAA will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify the goods and services financed from loan proceeds, the financing resources received, \nexpenditure incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds. Accounts will be established and \nmaintained  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  Consolidated  project \naccounts and related financial statements will be compiled by the PCU and audited annually by \nindependent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited accounts, audit report, and associated \nfinancial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year to \nwhich  they  relate.  In  line  with  ADB  policy  on  submission  of  audited  accounts,  sanctions  are \nmandatory (i) for statements submitted to ADB more than 6 months past due date, when imprest \nfunds will not be reimbursed; and (ii) for statements submitted to ADB more than 12 months past due \ndate, when loan disbursement will be suspended. \n \n56.  The Appraisal Mission explained the ADB anticorruption policy, particularly the section on \nfraud and corruption as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Project accounts, including district imprest subaccounts, SKAA\u2019s subaccount, and \nthe PCU imprest account will be audited annually by independent auditors; the loan allocation \nprovides financing for this activity. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n57.  During the initial year of project implementation, a project performance monitoring system \nwill be established in each district by the PIO in consultation with PCU, the project management \nconsultant, and the lead NGO to ensure consistency. The output generated will be part of a \ncomputerized management information system established by the PCU. The initial survey, limited \nto key indicators and including poverty mapping, will  serve in part as the village screening \nrequired to facilitate selection of project target villages and must be conducted in the initial year of \nthe Project. These impact indicators will be reassessed at midterm in a midterm survey and on \nproject completion. At CBO level, participatory gender-disaggregated monitoring and evaluation \nwill be introduced as part of the Project\u2019s comprehensive participatory development approach. \nFor periodic monitoring, key indicators used in the screening process will be incorporated in the \nregular monitoring system. Special studies may be conducted to investigate issues relating to \nproject implementation and its impacts. The midterm survey, referred to earlier will be completed \nand a report thereon prepared prior to the planned  ADB/government of Sindh midterm review \n(MTR) in the latter part of year three of project implementation. \n  \n9.  Project Review \n \n58.  During the initial 3 years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual reviews to (i) determine \nif all proposed implementation arrangements are appropriate and in place, (ii) assess the progress of \n ", " 15 \nvillage and infrastructure screening processes, (iii) review the construction program for district link \nroads, (iv) review the poverty-focused and related hari-focused initiatives, (v) review the conduct and \noutcome of capacity-building and training activities, and (vi) review the gender strategy and plan. \nDuring the latter half of year three, ADB and the Government will jointly undertake a comprehensive \nMTR. The MTR will review and evaluate (i) project scope, design, and implementation arrangements \n(in particular, modalities of fund flows to districts and institutional processes); (ii) implementation \nprogress against agreed indicators in the annual work plans based on the project framework; \n(iii) procurement  performance;  (iv) PCU  and  PIO  effectiveness;  (v) performance  of  consultants; \n(vi) the extent to which land records, including registration of tenants in field books and village forms, \nwere maintained and sanads issued; (vii) the progress of implementation of the gender strategy and \nplan; (viii) the effectiveness of the grievance redress procedures in the STA in settling tenancy \ndisputes; and (ix) any other issue agreed upon between the PCU and ADB. At the latest of 1 month \nprior to the MTR, the PCU will, in consultation with the PIOs, submit a comprehensive report on each \nof the issues mentioned in (i) to (viii) above. The MTR will include recommendations for changes in \nproject  design  and  implementation  arrangements  as  needed,  which  will  be  considered  by  the \nGovernment, the government of Sindh, and ADB. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n59.  Economic analysis is based on increased agricultural productivity from the improved rural \nlivelihoods component and the reduced vehicle operating costs from the improved district link \nroads subcomponent (part of the  upgraded rural infrastructure and settlement improvement \ncomponent). As village groups are the delivery mechanism in all components and investment in \nproject management support is to facilitate efficient implementation, costs pertaining to these \ncomponents have been appropriately apportioned between project components. When analyzed \nseparately, the  improved rural livelihoods component is expected to generate an economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of 17.3% while the EIRR for the investment in the district link roads \nsubcomponent is expected to be about 18.9%. Together, these are expected to generate an \nEIRR of 18.0% (Appendix 11, Table A11.5). In addition, the Project will generate a wide range of \nnonquantifiable benefits (Appendix 11, paras. 8\u201311).  \n \nB.  Social Measures and Impact on Poverty \n \n60.  Rural Society, Internal Village Organization, and Gender. Rural society in the project \narea is heterogeneous and highly complex. It is governed by traditional principles of castes, \ntribes, religion, gender, political affiliations, and origin, which define the relationship between the \npoor and the ruling class. Stratification below the poverty line is low with the majority of the village \npopulation being poor and very poor. The goths (villages) and their internal organization reflect \nthe  heterogeneity  of  the  population.  With  in-depth  knowledge  of  the  delicately  balanced \nrelationships, the distribution of power, behavioral restrictions, norms and traditions, the Project \ncan organize villages around common interests. To achieve this, the Project will use a strategy of \nworking with selected lead NGOs and their CBO partners. Gender disparities are marked and \nfemale members of the target groups are more disadvantaged than the males. The movement of \nwomen living in the villages is restricted; rules of gender segregation and purdah apply depending \non tribe or caste affiliation. Women from outside, however, can move freely. The Project has \nprepared  a  detailed  gender  strategy  and  plan  (Appendix  7),  which  emphasizes  improving \nwomen\u2019s  access  to  services,  and  supports  the  introduction  of  labor-saving  appropriate \ntechnologies and the improvement of women\u2019s livestock management skills. It provides for one \nfull-time gender specialist per district, engaging thematic NGOs on gender issues, and bridging \nthe present gap in women\u2019s access to services. \n \n ", "16  \n61.  Minority Groups. The Project explicitly targets haris, agricultural laborers, and marginal \nowners-cum-tenants, including the minority groups belonging to this target group.38 Results from \nthe PPTA and SSTA social and poverty assessments do not anticipate any problems at the \nvillage level for minority groups to gain access  to project interventions. The lead NGOs will \nensure that partner CBOs possess demonstrated experience in reaching out to minority groups. \nOnly villages will be included where different castes and groups live together harmoniously  \n(Appendix 5). According to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People, no plan for indigenous people \nneeds to be prepared, as all groups will equally benefit from project interventions. \n \n62.  Sharecropping Tenancy. The sharecropping system is an important element of the \npoverty situation prevailing in Sindh as well as a traditional and complex system, characterized by \nhighly inequitable access to and control over resources, highly disadvantaging haris. Improving \nthe situation of the sharecroppers in the project area is considered the key to poverty reduction in \nthe project area. A detailed analysis of the sharecropping system is in Appendix 12.   \n \n63.  Access to Land, Infrastructure, Services, and Employment. Land ownership in the project \narea is highly inequitable. Road infrastructure linking villages to the main road network is inadequate. \nAccess to safe drinking water is limited. Adult literacy rates are very poor (Appendix 12, Table A12.1). \nAbout 90% of the population are engaged in agriculture and alternative employment is seasonal and \nextremely limited. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n64.  Benefits and Impact on Poverty. The Project will support awareness raising of basic rights, \nas well as the need for target groups to obtain NICs for them to exercise their right to vote, register as \ntenants, acquire ownership for their homesteads, or access formal credit. The implementation of the \namended STA will ensure a more equitable sharing system and the registration as tenants will \nprovide  security  of  tenure.  Together  with  improving  access  to  justice,  these  interventions  are \nexpected to decrease the vulnerability of the target groups.  Life and social skills, acquired also \nthrough the literacy training, will improve awareness of social issues, health and hygiene, literacy, \nawareness of rights and justice, while access to information will help poor people avoid being \ncheated, create more equitable access to social facilities, and give marginalized people, including \nwomen, a voice in community affairs. Community participation will increase the confidence of the poor \nand contribute to substantially strengthening civil society.  \n \n65.  Improved farm technologies and livestock management will lead to productivity increases for \nthe households, of which 88% are poor. A conservative estimate of productivity gains in crop and \nlivestock  production,  combined  with  improvements  in  the  tenancy  arrangements  through  the \namended STA, result in 20.9\u201329.3% increases in net farm incomes. Further gains will arise from \nimproved incentives and effort (Appendix 2). In the absence of the amended STA, the increases in \nincome resulting from project investments would be limited to 11.5\u201315.8% in the four districts. Better \nhousing, and improved water and sanitation will have a positive impact on hygiene and health. \nTogether, all project interventions will gradually allow the target group to reduce their dependency on \nthe landlords. The poverty impact ratio has been calculated with and without the amended STA. In \nthe first scenario the impact on the poor would be 77%, whereas in the latter this falls to 53% \n(Appendix 2, Tables A2.4 and A2.5).  \n \n66.  The improvement of district link roads will improve access of some 38,500 households, of \nwhich at least 60% are poor. Improved access will result in reduced transport costs, time savings, \nreduced  consumer  prices,  and  improved  access  to  health  and  education  facilities.  Of  the \nquantifiable benefits from this, 45% will be to the poor (60% for passenger transport and 38% for \nfreight). The Project will improve village drinking water supply, sanitation and drainage, and \nphysical access for 750 villages with at least 60% of their population in poverty. Although benefits \n                                                 \n38  Of the population, 2.5% are Hindu scheduled castes (Bheel, Kolhi) and about 0.2% are Christians. \n ", " 17 \nfrom this are mainly nonquantifiable, it can be argued that the proportion of benefits accruing to \nthe poor will be at least 60%. Of the total population benefiting from various project interventions, \n60\u2013100% are poor. Of the quantifiable benefits under the Project, 60% will accrue to the poor \n(Supplementary Appendix E).   \n \nC.  Environmental Impacts \n67.  The  Project  has  been  classified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Category  B,  and  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE)  (Appendix 13) has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental assessment and environmental review procedures. The selection criteria under each \nproject component were established, specifying exclusion of any sites of ecological, archeological, or \nhistorical  importance.  Although  the  Project  will  cover  a  wide  geographic  area  and  involve \ninterventions in several sectors, there will be no major impacts, due largely to the small scale of the \ninvestments, and the low technology and low intensity of the construction works. The IEE finds that \nthe Project will not create any significant changes in the social, physical, or biological environment.  \n \n68.  The potential impacts of the major components of the Project are primarily construction \nrelated. Experience has shown that the environmental impact of rural roads projects, domestic village \nwater supply, and drainage and sanitation schemes is generally insignificant, especially when the \nwork involved is primarily rehabilitation or upgrading. Mitigation measures to address any potentially \nminor adverse impacts in road construction and rehabilitation are detailed in the IEE. The small-scale \nwater supply and drainage schemes will be selected in a similar fashion, but those in areas close to \nsensitive areas such as wetlands will require monitoring of the water table and water sources. This \nwill be built into the O&M plan for the schemes. Environmental sensitivity screening will be conducted \nfor each rural infrastructure intervention, to be followed, where required, by the preparation of an \nenvironmental assessment, including recommendations on mitigation measures.39 All land proposed \nfor construction, alignment, and improvement or rehabilitation of any facilities under the Project, \nincluding roads, will be screened for resettlement effects. No site will be selected that would involve \nland acquisition or land conversion that might generate involuntary settlement effects, including loss \nof income, resources, or assets for the nontitled. All mitigation measures will be included in the \ncontract documents for civil works specifying penalties for noncompliance.  \n \nD.  Risk Assessment \n69.  At a political level, successful implementation of the Project requires continued political \ncommitment to improve governance, as well as a proactive stance by  the  Government on \nfacilitating social change within the target population, particularly hari groups. Under the current \ndevolution initiatives, local governments are to be empowered (Appendix 1, para. 5). The risk that \nactivities to be implemented under this Project will be selectively screened and delivered in \nresponse to political imperatives has been minimized by the adoption of comprehensive selection \ncriteria (Appendix 5), while the participation of NGOs in the PSC and the ZPCs establishes a \nsystem of checks and balances. The Government has also shown commitment to improving the \nstatus of haris in its readiness to reform the STA and its implementing Rules; the provincial labor \ndepartment is involved in the implementation of the  National Plan for the Abolition of Bonded \nLabour,40 supported by the International Labor Organization (ILO).41 \n \n                                                 \n39  The screening activities will be carried out by the district government office for works and services for the district link \nroads and by SKAA for the village link roads and settlement infrastructure improvement. \n40  National Policy and Plan of Action for the Abolition of Bonded Labour and Rehabilitation of Freed Labourers. 2001. \nMinistry of Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis. Islamabad. 5 November. \n41  The subregional project on debt bondage forms part of ILO\u2019s Social Finance Program currently being implemented in \nfour countries including Pakistan. \n ", "18  \n70.  One important variable in project success is the effective interaction between project \nmanagement in the form of the PCU and the PIOs, lead NGOs, and CBOs. A high level of skill in \nproject management, including planning, coordination, and supervision, is required given the \ngeographic coverage and diverse range of activities and partners. It is essential that the key \nmanagement staff of the PCU and PIOs have the necessary vision, conceptualization abilities, \nand human resources development skills to properly direct the Project. The Government is aware \nof these requirements and the Project provides the necessary project management support in \nterms of consulting services to strengthen the skills of the key management staff. \n \n71.  Delivery of activities through NGOs is an important platform of project design, but there is a \nrisk that NGOs may not have the adequate experience or capacity to meet the Project\u2019s needs. \nDetailed reviews of the NGO base within the project area (Supplementary Appendix B) have been \nconducted, and coupled with the capacity-building activities included in the Project, the design of the \nProject has, to the degree possible, mitigated risks from this source. \n \n72.  The project implementation period of 7 years allows sufficient time for community mobilization \nand capacity building of the district government, lead NGOs, CBOs, and village groups, based on a \nparticipatory approach. The Project focuses on building up the core capacity of the PCU and PIOs in \nthe early stages, with a gradual acceleration of social organization and community mobilization \nprocesses and delivery capacity increases. The MTR and associated project performance monitoring \nsystem provide the opportunity to make adjustments in project implementation, if required. To this \nextent, the Project incorporates flexibility in physical targets and subcomponent financial allocations, \nso that implementation can be adjusted to reflect absorptive capacities. \n \n73.  The risk associated with a lack of sustainability has been addressed through: (i) building up \nthe capacity of district government and CBOs in social mobilization and community strengthening; \n(ii) extending and reinforcing skills and levels in district government and CBOs; (iii) concentrating on \ncommunity mobilization at the village level and with specified village groups; and (iv) facilitating CBOs \nto register as citizen community boards, extend their outreach and level of services, and move toward \nbecoming sustainable. In terms of community infrastructure, experience with SKAA\u2014the Orangi pilot \nproject  and  rural  support  programs\u2014has  demonstrated  the  communities\u2019  willingness  to  accept \nresponsibility for O&M, resulting in sustainability of interventions.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n74.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the LGD have given the \nfollowing specific assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The PSC and ZPCs will be established within 1 month of loan effectiveness. \n(ii)  Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, each PIO will appoint a full-time account \nofficer, a full-time project officer, and the necessary support staff. \n(iii)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness all tapedar and supervisory tapedar positions in \nthe project area will be filled. \n(iv)  Within 3 years of loan effectiveness, the BOR will complete a new land survey in \nthe project area with its results reflected in accurate land records. \n(v)  The Government will take all appropriate and necessary measures to encourage \norganizations in the project area to apply for funds from the Legal Empowerment \nFund under the Access to Justice Program; this will include orientation sessions on \nopportunities under the Legal Empowerment Fund. \n(vi)  The Government will facilitate access of civil society monitors to public documents \nof immediate relevance to the Project, in particular land records\u2014including field \n ", " 19 \nbooks and village forms\u2014records on issuance of NICs, and records on issuance of \nproperty deeds (sanads). \n(vii)  The PCU will contract both the lead NGO and the thematic NGOs. Prequalification \nto bid for the lead NGO contract will be in accordance with criteria agreed upon \nbetween the LGD and ADB. Invitations to submit expressions of interest will be \nwidely advertised. Assessment criteria for proposals of thematic NGOs will reflect \nthe terms of reference and as agreed upon between the LGD and ADB. \n(viii)  Selection of prequalified NGOs will be on the basis of bidding procedures, which \nwill include both technical and financial criteria, and which will be acceptable to \nADB. Preference will be given to those NGOs originating from the district where \nactivities will be provided and which include female trainers. \n(ix)  The  villages,  district  link  roads,  and  village  link  roads  eligible  for  project \ninterventions will be selected in accordance with criteria agreed upon between the \nLGD and ADB. \n(x)  By the end of 2002, the mandate of SKAA will be extended to rural areas. \n(xi)  SKAA  will  recruit  sufficient  and  appropriate  staff  to  implement  the  settlement \ninfrastructure improvement subcomponent of the Project as well as the village link \nroads. \n(xii)  The BOR will regularize nonsanctioned or nonregularized villages prior to the \ncommencement  of  settlement  infrastructure  improvement  and  construction  of \nvillage link road in such villages. \n(xiii)  Sanads will be issued to all residents of sanctioned and regularized villages in \nwhich project activities take place. \n(xiv)  Prior to the award of any civil works contract, all land proposed for construction, \nalignment,  improvement,  or  rehabilitation  of  any  facilities  under  the  Project, \nincluding roads, will be screened for resettlement effects. No site will be selected \nthat will involve land acquisition or land conversion that might generate involuntary \nresettlement  effects,  including  loss  of  income,  resources,  or  assets  for  the \nnontitled. \n(xv)  There  will  be  a  maintenance  plan,  including  a  budget,  for  all  facilities  to  be \nconstructed, aligned, improved, or rehabilitated under the Project, prior to the \ncompletion of such works. For village link roads and settlement infrastructure \nimprovement,  such  a  maintenance  plan  will  be  included  in  the  partnership \nagreement between the villagers and SKAA.

Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n75.  The  following  conditions  will  be  met  by  the  Government  before  the  loan  becomes \neffective: (i) the PCU and the PIOs will be established, and all PCU staff will be in place; and \n(ii) the PCU will have recruited a project management specialist. \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n \n76.  The following conditions will be met by the Government before disbursement under the \nspecified project components/subcomponents: (i) no funds for activities to be implemented by \nlead NGOs, or under the guidance of those NGOs, will be disbursed unless the lead NGO for \neach district has been selected and is functioning; (ii) funds for improved settlement will only be \ndisbursed after a deh-wide list of all villages in the project area with a population of over 50 \nhouseholds has been drafted, indicating which of those villages are sanctioned or regularized (or \nnot) and whether they are on state land or privately owned land and a time-bound action plan for \nthe regularization of all nonsanctioned or nonregularized villages will also be drawn up; and \n(iii) before any funds for the computerization of land records and/or survey equipment will be \ndisbursed, land registration and tenancy records will have been properly maintained for a period \nof at least four cropping seasons (2 years). \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n77.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of \nAgreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 37,885,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sindh \nRural Development Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the \nrate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n                    MYOUNG-HO SHIN \nVice President (Operations 1) \n \n \n \n \n24 October 2002 \n ", "              Appendix 1  21\nSECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The rural sector underpins the economic and social structure of the economy of Pakistan. \nThe agriculture sector contributes about 25% of gross domestic product, is the source of 74% of \nexports,1 and provides direct employment for about 44% of the workforce. Despite the introduction \nof macroeconomic structural reforms in the latter half of the 1990s, there are major concerns about \nagricultural  productivity  and  growth,  with  sector  growth  of  about  3.7%  only  just  exceeding \npopulation growth of 2.5% annually over the past decade. The rural, nonfarm sector is also a major \ncontributor to the economy, but performance in this sector has been equally restrained. This has \nadversely affected the livelihoods and growth prospects for all the 68% of households that live in \nthe rural areas of the country.  \n \n2.  While economic growth in the farm and nonfarm sectors is a necessary condition for \nimproving  rural  livelihoods,  it  is  not  a  sufficient  condition2  and  nowhere  is  this  more  clearly \ndemonstrated than in the rural areas of southern Sindh. Here, structural rigidities, imbalance in \naccess to resources, the impacts of the introduction of some new technologies,3 weak governance, \nand a lack of empowerment constrain the benefits of sector economic growth from \u201ctrickling down\u201d \nto the over half of households that do not own agricultural land, and the further one quarter of \nhouseholds that own 2 hectares (ha) or less (termed \u201cmarginal\u201d farmers). These two groups are \nrepresented in all facets of the poverty spectrum, not only in terms of income poverty but also \nexhibiting deprivation in key quality of life opportunities (e.g., access to education, health care, \nnutrition, and safe water and sanitation), as well as vulnerability and powerlessness. This situation \nis exemplified in the results of poverty surveys where districts in southern Sindh are some of the \nleast developed in the province and in the country; primary enrollment rates are the lowest in the \ncountry for the lowest income quintile; 70\u201380% of rural households in selected districts are poor \nand malnourished; infant mortality rates are among the highest in the country; and access to public \nservices is extremely restricted4 (using issuance of national identity cards as a proxy). \n \n3.  The factors that  constrain the ability of households in rural Sindh to make significant \nimprovements in their livelihoods are diverse and interdependent. They are both the limitations to \ndirectly improving household income and the compounding effects of a host of other factors. These \ninclude  the  deeply  skewed  distribution  of  power  and  resources;  an  institutional  and  political \nframework  that  exhibits  weak  governance  in  terms  of  poor  fiscal  management;  a  lack  of \ntransparency; inefficient and inadequate delivery of core public services; and a lack of egalitarian \nparticipation in, and access to, the political process. \n 4.  Government initiatives to address some of these issues are outlined in the Interim Poverty \nReduction  Strategy  (IPRSP)  and  the  Three-Year Poverty Reduction Program 2001\u201304.5 This \nincludes a program based on four core principles: (i) engendering growth, (ii) implementing broad-\nbased governance reforms, (iii) improving social sector outcomes, and (iv) reducing vulnerability to \nshocks.  Key  IPRSP  elements  are  correcting  macroeconomic  imbalances  and  stabilizing  the \neconomy, promoting an investment climate that facilitates private sector investment, developing \n                                                 \n1  Made up of exports of agricultural commodities (13%) and exports of agricultural manufactured products (61%). \n2  Pro-poor rural economic growth, which is accompanied by private capital formation, depends on a macroeconomic \nand sector policy environment where both urban-rural and farm-nonfarm elements are balanced; market structures \nare efficient (competitive or contestable); there is good governance; property rights are well defined and enforceable; \nbasic institutional structures are in place and deliver effective services (including an appropriate regulatory and policy \nframework); and there is civil and social order. This environment needs to be supported by a basic, functioning \ninfrastructure network and the availability of core public services (in education, health, and nutrition).  \n3   For example, mechanization. \n4   Social Policy and Development Centre. 2001.

Governance reforms \ninvolve increasing the transparency and accountability of administrative operations and capacity \nthrough  devolution  of  power,  reforms  in  the  civil  service,  improving  access  to  justice,  and \nintroducing fiscal and financial transparency. Human development initiatives include  education, \nhealth, water supply, sanitation, nutrition, population planning, and the provision of protection to \nvulnerable groups in society. Specific programs are recommended in the area of social protection. \nThe IPRSP also recognizes the significant role that nongovernment organizations (NGOs) have \nplayed in poverty reduction and stresses the need for strengthening NGO/government partnerships \nin development. \n \n5.  Governance has emerged as one of Pakistan\u2019s foremost development concerns. On 14 \nAugust 2001,  a new integrated three-tier local government system was installed under a bold \ndevolution plan. The Government is relying on the devolution program to promote competition, \nownership, and accountability in the delivery of public services, and by involving people actively in \ncommunity issues. This is a major opportunity for more people-centered, rights- and responsibility-\nbased government structures, but major risks relate to the weak technical and institutional capacity \nto  handle  the  diverse  set  of  functions,  the  reluctance  of  provincial  governments  to  devolve \nadministrative  and  financial  powers,  and  the  likelihood  of  control  by  local  elites.  Greater \nparticipation of people requires developing a civil society, able to take over responsibilities within \nan environment that is conducive for accepting opposition and differing opinions. Major risks of the \ndevolution plan are at present \u201cthe lack of institutional capacity to handle the diverse set of \nfunctions being handed over, the reluctance of provincial governments to fully empower local \ngovernment, unclear financial arrangements and the likelihood of control by the local elites, which \ncould defeat the purpose of inducing greater people\u2019s participation\u201d.6  \n  \n6.  This governance initiative, significant as it is, will only generate positive impacts in the \nlivelihoods of the rural poor when accompanied by a coordinated and comprehensive program to \naddress the other key structural and social constraints. Such a program will need to combine \nthematic, cross-cutting, and sector initiatives in a complementary manner, addressing the critical \nconstraints that impinge directly on improvement of rural livelihoods. Governance issues therefore \nneed to be considered together with issues such as gender imbalance and sustainability. Pro-poor \nrural development initiatives at the sector level should look to promote technology appropriate for \nthe poor (both farm and household); facilitate secure ownership and/or tenancy rights on land; \npromote efficient input, rural finance, and product markets; facilitate provision of basic services and \nthe  building  of  human/social  capital;  prioritize  necessary  infrastructure  investments;  promote \nimproved governance and empowerment; and encourage a nondiscriminatory policy environment. \nCapacity development and training need to focus on organizations addressing poverty concerns \n(including government, NGOs, and community-based  organizations).  In  addition,  although  the \nresearch is not compelling, there is a growing body of work that supports the proposition that one \nmajor  driver  for  pro-poor  growth  consists  of  investments  in  rural  infrastructure  (roads, \ntelecommunications), education, agricultural research, and extension services.7 Analysis of quality \nof life indicators shows that priority investments are also needed in health and nutrition. There is \nalso increasing empirical evidence of the synergies and interactive impacts between investments \n                                                 \n6  Social Policy and Development Center. 2001.

In southern Sindh, agriculture and livestock productivity is below the provincial average, \nespecially on hari-operated farms,9 where poor and landless cultivators have few incentives to \noptimize production, and levels of household indebtedness are high.10 Existing landlord/tenant \ncrop-revenue and cost-sharing arrangements are unbalanced and provide a disincentive for the \ntenant to increase production (Appendix 11). In addition, access to relevant extension services or \nimproved technologies is virtually nonexistent. Improvements in basic literacy and numeracy are \nthe first step in increased empowerment, as is community mobilization. Complementary sector \ninvestments are needed to introduce new farm and household technologies, reduce marketing \nmargins, and facilitate linkages to institutional microcredit programs targeted at the rural poor. \nImproved all-weather road access, both between villages and from villages to the district road \nnetwork, is another complementary focus, as is the other major expressed need of the rural poor, \nnamely access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation. Finally, targeted interventions are \nneeded to address the denial of people\u2019s basic rights by public officials, nonimplementation of \nprotective measures and legislation, substandard service delivery, and a lack of access to fair and \naffordable grievance-settlement mechanisms, including the courts.  \n \n8.  There are a number of options as to how best to address these constraints in southern \nSindh  within  a  comprehensive  framework,  but  the  issue  is  to  recognize  that  empowerment, \nawareness raising, reinforcement of basic rights, improvements in literacy, and social/community \nmobilization  are  at  the  core  of  any  interventions  to  correct  the  power  imbalance  in  society. \nAbsorptive  capacity  determines  the  quantum  of  intervention  that  can  be  sustained.  Similarly, \ndelivery  and  demonstration  of  appropriate,  improved  technologies  for  farm  and  nonfarm \nhouseholds are dependent on delivery capacity constraints within the intervention modality and the \nabsorptive capacity of the target population. Complementary sector investments are urgently \nneeded in rural infrastructure and settlement improvement. This Project is designed with these \nissues in mind so as to ensure an appropriate balance between components, both in terms of \naddressing the constraints affecting improvements in rural livelihoods in a comprehensive and \nholistic manner, while acknowledging the institutional delivery and absorptive capacity constraints \nthat exist. \n                                                 \n8  See Taylor L., Mehrotra, S., and Delamonica, E. 1997.

It defines a tenant as a person who personally \ncultivates the land of another person (the landlord). This document adopts the term hari. \n10  For example, a survey of 136 households in six villages in Sanghar revealed that 83% of households had outstanding \nloans at an average of PRs14,000. \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction \n1.  During the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) and the subsequent small-\nscale technical assistance (SSTA), socio-agroeconomic surveys were undertaken in the project \narea and the findings from these, along with information from secondary sources,1 have been \nused in this analysis. \n \n2.  The amendments to the Sindh Tenancy Act, 1950 (STA) and Rules under the improved \ngovernance and legal support component aim to address the imbalances in the current tenancy \narrangements and will have a direct impact on the target group farms. The activities in the \nimproved rural livelihoods component are aimed at improving farm productivities and reducing \nproduction costs, and the expected financial impacts of these interventions on individual farm \nenterprises is more quantifiable. To a large extent, the household financial benefits expected \nfrom many of the components of the Project cannot be readily quantified, particularly impacts \nfrom investments in the improved social processes at the community level component and the \nupgraded  rural  infrastructure  and  settlement  improvement  component.  For  example,  any \nchanges in cropping pattern made by the landowners after access to markets is improved will \nhave a positive impact on household incomes of  haris, but have not been quantified. This \nappendix pertains to the activities planned in the improved rural livelihoods component and the \nimplementation of the amended STA. \n \nB.  Methodology \n3.  The financial returns and  costs are estimated in constant year 2001/02 terms, with \nfarmgate prices being based on the findings of the surveys undertaken during the PPTA and \nSSTA. \n \n4.  Crop models have been prepared for the major crops and most minor crops. The only \nexception is orchards in that, while orchards are significant in the project area, they are not \ntypical in the cropping pattern adopted by the target group farms.2 Given that recent crop \nproductivities and cropping patterns have been severely affected by the shortages in canal \nwater supplies resulting from the countrywide drought, average crop models for the years \n1997/98 to 2000/01 have been developed, which include years with dependable and normal \ncanal supplies as well as the shortages. Any productivity gains or changes in input usage levels \nresulting from project interventions have been assumed to be on the base levels depicted in \nthese average crop models rather than on the levels that would have prevailed in any individual \nyear (Supplementary Appendix E).  \n \n5.  Based on PPTA and SSTA findings and secondary sources, livestock activity models \nhave been prepared for milking buffalo, cattle, and goats. Milk, cull animals, and young stock \nhave been assumed as the main products. In addition, it is assumed that all livestock produce is \nsold and household consumption needs are met through cash purchases. Intermediate products \nsuch as fodder, straw, and manure have also been assumed to be sold at the point of produce \nand purchased at the point of consumption. The livestock models assume that milking animals \n                                                 \n1  Sources include  Sindh Development Statistics  2000/01; Sindh Agricultural Statistics 2000/01; relevant 1998 \nPopulation Census Reports; Household Integrated Economic Survey of 1998; and Sindh Goth Survey 2000. \n2  Large landowners typically employ labor to tend to their orchards during the nonbearing periods, and at the fruit-\nbearing periods contract it out.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nwill have a 5-year milking life and that replacements will be purchased rather than reared on-\nfarm.  \n \n6.  Farm labor requirements distinguish between the peak demand periods of transplanting \nand  harvesting  where  any  labor  shortages are met through hired labor, and the off-peak \ndemand periods where the entire requirements are met through family labor. Since family labor \nis not paid in cash, only hired labor has been priced. \n \nC.  Agricultural Benefits \n7.  To indicate the financial impacts of project interventions on the target group, financial \nfarm models have been prepared for average hari farms in the project area. Based on PPTA \nand SSTA findings, an average farm size of 1.92 hectares (ha) has been adopted. While the \naverage size of a hari farm in the four districts is quite similar, cropping patterns and hence the \nanalysis reflect separate farm models for each of the four districts. Given that the target group \nfarmers are mainly haris who do not make land use decisions, it is anticipated that the impacts \nof the Project on cropping patterns will be minimal. For the purpose of this analysis, it has been \nassumed that the only change in the cropping pattern will be a marginal increase in the area \nunder vegetables, which will be due to the promotion of homestead vegetable gardening among \nwomen. At full development, the cropping intensity is anticipated to grow by less than 0.25% \n(from 131.0 to 131.3). \n \n8.  While, in theory, there is a significant room for improvement in crops yields, conservative \nyield increases have been assumed for the purposes of this analysis, reflecting the large \nnumber of factors that impact on agricultural productivity. It has been assumed that in the cases \nof  wheat  and  rice  paddy,  more  focused  activities  such  as  village-level  improved  seed \nmultiplication and resource conservation/zero tillage cultivation3 will generate yield increases of \n10%. The yields of all other crops have been assumed to increase by 5%, except for sugarcane \nwhere only a 2% yield increase is anticipated as district yields are already higher than the \nprovincial average. In case of livestock productivities, it has been assumed that village-level \ntraining in improved livestock management, training of village-based livestock workers, and \nimproved milk and dairy product marketing, will increase milk and meat production by 10%. \n \n9.  Any improvements in productivity or changes in cropping pattern and cropping intensities \nhave been assumed to take place over a period of 5 years. Productivity improvements have \nbeen summarized in Table A2.1, with detailed crop and livestock models, cropping patterns and \nfarm budgets being presented in Supplementary Appendix E.   \n \nD.  Benefits of the Amended Sindh Tenancy Act \n10.  The  hari-landowner  relationship  was  traditionally  based  on  a  fairly  simple  sharing \narrangement,  which  was  formalized  by  the  STA  (Appendix  12).  Field  surveys  undertaken \nthrough the PPTA and SSTA show that compliance with the STA is selective depending on how \ngood  the  relationship  is  between  a  particular  landowner  and  his  haris  and  also  on  how \nadvantageous a particular STA clause is to the landowners. The Sindh High Court judgment of \nFebruary 2002 also commented on this aspect and called for revisions to the STA. During the \nSSTA,  intensive  consultations  with  the  haris,  landowners,  and  other  stakeholders  were \n                                                 \n3  Project Completion Report. 2000.

Financial Impact on Haris and Landowners \n11.  The amended STA improves both the system of sharing input costs between the haris \nand  the  landowners\u2014reducing  the  burden  on  the  hari  (Table  A2.2)\u2014and  provides  better \nsecurity of tenure through streamlining registration. Interventions through the improved rural \nlivelihoods component lead to improved productivity. Reduced input costs for the hari and \nincreased productivity are expected to result in significant financial benefits for  haris, which \ndirectly impact on their poverty status. In addition, amended STA provisions relating to debt \nallow a hari to seek better terms with other landowners to pay back the loan instead of \ncontinuing under adverse terms with the landowner to which he is indebted. In conjunction with \nimproved security of tenure, the ability to seek better terms from other landowners encourages \nmore investment and effort by the hari, which consequently results in higher productivity. \n  \n12.  Scenario 1 in Table A2.3 analyzes the impact of improved cost-sharing and productivity \nimprovement interventions resulting from the improved rural livelihoods component and shows \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nsubstantial increases in farm incomes for haris in all four districts. In the case of landowners, the \nimpact is anticipated to range from marginal improvement in Sanghar to marginal declines in the \nother three districts. The impact on landowners is even more marginal as the depicted change is \nonly with respect to income from the hari-operated holding and not with respect to the overall \nfarm income that will also include income from self-cultivated land, orchards, and livestock. \n \nTable A2.3: Anticipated Impact on Net Farm Incomes (%) \n \n  Scenario 1:  Income Increase from Improved  Scenario 2:  Income Increase With \nCost-Sharing and Productivity Improvement  Additional Productivity Gains from \nInterventions  Improved Effort \nFarm Location  Hari  Landowner  Hari  Landowner \nThatta  29.2  -3.7  34.4  3.1 \nBadin  29.3  -3.5  34.6  3.2 \nMirpurkhas  21.0  -0.7  26.9  6.1 \nSanghar  20.9  2.4  26.2  8.7 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimate. \n \n13.  While the literature provides evidence of improved productivity resulting from improved \nterms and security of tenure for haris, the studies and empirical models do not predict the size \nof productivity increases and hence it is not possible to gauge the full impact of project \ninterventions.4 However, any productivity improvements additional to scenario 1 will benefit both \nharis and landowners. Scenario 2 shows the impact when, in addition to the productivity \nincreases under scenario 1, another 5% increase on account of greater effort and investment by \ntenants takes place and as a result incomes of haris improve by 26\u201335% while those of \nlandowners improve by 3\u20139%. For all districts combined, the break-even point\u2014the point at \nwhich landowners should be financially indifferent to the Project\u2019s interventions because their \nincome is unchanged\u2014lies somewhere between the base yield increases shown in Table A2.1 \nand yield increases 5% above the base. Therefore, it may be concluded from this analysis that \nwith only modest productivity gains assumed, landowners should have no significant financial \nincentive to prevent the haris from taking advantage of the Project\u2019s interventions. If higher yield \ngains can be achieved, the incentives for landowners to support the haris\u2019 participation will \nbecome increasingly positive. All further analysis, including that for the poverty impact, is based \non scenario 1.5 \n \nF.  Poverty Impact \n14.  Interventions under the improved governance and legal support component aim at \nreducing the current imbalances in the present tenancy arrangements; likely financial impacts \nhave  been  disaggregated  to  reflect  the  circumstances  of  specific  stakeholders  such  as \nharis/tenants, landowners, and agricultural laborers. Table A2.4 summarizes the calculations of \npoverty impact ratio (PIR), with the difference in the net present value of net economic benefits \nand net financial benefits being about PRs77.82 million. The interesting aspect is the distribution \nof the difference between the economic and financial present values of farm production costs. \nWhile relatively small (PRs1.45 million), it is quite significant in the sense that for hari farmers it \nrepresents a cost reduction of PRs22.13 million in the net present value with a cost increase of \nPRs20.66 million for the landowners. These transfers are a combination of implementing the \namended STA, coupled with those interventions that have a specific focus on the target groups. \n                                                 \n4  Banerjee, A.V. et al. 2002. \u201cEmpowerment and Efficiency: Tenancy Reforms in West Bengal\u201d.

Pattern of Rural Settlement  \n1.  The four districts comprise of a total population estimated at 5.8 million, of which 80% \nare rural.1 The total number of rural households is about 800,000 in around 2,200 dehs.2 \nOverall, Sindh province has about 67,000 settlements, and in the four districts 35.2% of the rural \npopulation live in settlements of 50 households and above (Table A5.1). This, combined with a \nlow level of organization in the villages, makes efficient service delivery difficult. Spatial planning \nto consolidate the population in a smaller number of settlements has not been undertaken. \nRecognizing that services can only be delivered to a limited number of villages, the Project will \nadapt its area coverage and the depth of intervention in an attempt to establish \u201cgrowth poles\u201d. \nThis will assure focused investments and spatial impact, in the expectation that growth poles will \nattract people from the very small and scarcely serviced settlements.  \nTable A5.1: District Overviews \n \n    Badin  Mirpurkhas Sanghar Thatta  Overall\nAreaa           \n District Area (sq km)  6,726  8,533 10,728 17,355  43,342\n Canal-Irrigated Area (sq km)  2,435  2,389 3,418 1,911  10,153\nRural Population (1998)b     \n Households ('000)  183  218 204 194  799\n Population ('000)  950  1,569 1,122 988  4,629\n Population Density (Number/sq km)  141.2  183.9 104.6 56.9  106.8\nGothsc of 50 Households and Above (2000)d     \n Number  705  425 406 1,004  2,540\n Households ('000)  63  41 37 93  234\n Population ('000)  442  275 265 646  1,628\n Population as a Share of Overall Rural Population (%) 46.5  17.5 23.6 65.4  35.2\na  For district area: 1998 Provincial Census Report of Sindh.

The suggested stratification process follows the village selection criteria considering \ndifferent scopes of areas of intervention. The project activities contained under Component 1, \nImproved Governance and Legal Support, will be carried out throughout the irrigated areas of \nthe four districts. Components 2, 3, and 43 are targeted to a subset of rural households in the \ndistricts. It will therefore be critical to focus on those villages where there will be maximum \nimpact on the livelihoods of the target population. Later replication of project modalities should \nenable the benefits of pro-poor interventions to be broadened across a larger number of \nvillages. \n  \n                                                 \n1  This assumes a rural population growth rate of 2.4% annually, 1998\u20132002. \n2  A deh is the smallest revenue unit within a district with a number of dehs making up the union. A deh may contain a \nnumber of self-contained villages, commonly referred to as goths.  \n3  Component 2: Enhanced Social Processes at the Community Level; Component 3: Improved Rural Livelihoods; \nand Component 4: Upgraded Rural Infrastructure and Settlement Improvement. \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \n3.  The villages eligible for the project activities described under components 2, 3, and 4 will \nbe selected from an estimated rural population subset containing around 680,000 households \nwith an estimated population of just under 4 million, or 85% of the rural population of the four \ndistricts.  \n \nB.  The Selection Criteria \n4.  The  selection  criteria  consist  of  primary  criteria  applicable  to  assure  that  project \ninterventions under the three components reach the target groups, with further secondary \ncriteria  that  apply  to  Component  4  (Upgraded  Rural  Infrastructure  and  Settlement \nImprovement).  The  project  implementation  unit  will  be  responsible  for  organizing  the \nstratification process that will identify and select the villages or goths eligible for intervention \nunder three of the components financed under the Project.  \n \n1.  Primary Selection Criteria  \n(i)  The number of households in the goth must be more than 50, and less than 200. \n(ii)  In excess of 60% of households must comprise farmers with less than 2 ha of land, \nor of households headed by haris, landless laborers, or females. \n(iii)  The villages must be \u201cnontransitory\u201d.  \n(iv)  The villages must be classed as \u201ctraditional\u201d or \u201cpluralistic\u201d in terms of their social \nstructure.4  \n(v)  There must be relative social harmony within the village such that all individual \nhouseholds and social groups can fully participate equitably in communal activities \nand decision making.   \n(vi)  The village must not be receiving assistance for any similar activities from public \nfunds, Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund, Khushhalibank, publicly funded umbrella \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), or other bilateral or multilateral agencies. \n \n2.  Secondary Selection Criteria  \n5.  Spatial and efficiency considerations apply for the additional criteria over and above the \nprimary criteria and are relevant for villages in Component 4. Firstly, there must be equity in the \nspatial distribution of activities implemented under this component across the \u201celigible\u201d villages \nthat meet both the primary and secondary criteria. Project interventions under this component \ncannot therefore be concentrated in one sub-area of the district, but must be spread across all \nvillages  that  meet  the  primary  and  secondary  criteria.  All  villages  must  be  sanctioned  or \nregularized, as evidenced by lists from the Board of Revenue, and must be on public land. The \nBoard of Revenue will provide homestead titles (sanads) to households that do not hold title. In \naddition, all land for infrastructure upgrading must be free of habitation, without dispute or \ncontroversy.

The Project supports the development of comprehensive, time-bound, gender action plans for \neach of the four districts to increase gender awareness and ensure women\u2019s active involvement in the \nproject interventions, including direct access to project benefits.  \n \n2.  The objective of the gender strategy is to:  \n \n(i)  ensure that the Project\u2019s commitment to equity in the frame of poverty reduction is \noperationalized in the field through adequate attention to the gender aspects of staffing, \nimplementation processes, quality of monitoring, and research studies and evaluations; \n \n(ii)  feed into the government of Sindh\u2019s wider collaborative strategy for poverty reduction, \nwhere gender equity will play a major role;  \n \n(iii)  consider the elements proposed for gender integration under the Asian Development \nBank's  (ADB)  Devolution  Support  Program  and  establish  linkages  with  ADB  gender \ntechnical assistance.1 \n \nComponents and Targets for Gender Strategy \n \nComponent/Activity  Approach and Target \nComponent 1:    \nImproved Governance  ?? All legal awareness campaigns will include specific strategies for \nand Legal Support  disseminating information to women, given their limited mobility. \n?? All legal literacy programs will ensure at least 30% women's \nparticipation. \n?? Legal literacy courses will target women separately from men, and \nfemale nongovernment organization (NGO) staff will be made available \nto provide separate courses for women. The programs will be conducted \nin locations and times suitable to women and take account of women\u2019s \nrestricted mobility and domestic responsibilities. \n \nComponent 2:   \nEnhanced Social  ?? Selection criteria for lead NGOs and community-based organizations \nProcesses at the  (CBOs) will include gender balance in staffing and gender awareness as \nCommunity Level  demonstrated in the number of women\u2019s groups organized in the past.  \n?? At least 30% of the total number of CBOs should be women\u2019s \norganizations. \n?? Contents of literacy courses will include topics relevant and important for \nwomen (evidenced in manuals).  \n?? The timing and location of courses will take account of women's time \npressures and other responsibilities. Age group-related needs will be \nconsidered in the course contents, organization, and timing. Self-\nlearning and peer group learning will be included in methodologies. \nCourse locations will be at the convenience of women, considering their \nrestrictions of mobility. \n??

Village planning and needs assessments will be done taking men\u2019s and \nInfrastructure and  women\u2019s different needs into account (separate meetings where \nSettlement  needed). \nImprovement  ?? Women will be consulted in the improvement and upgrading of the water \nand sanitation systems and will receive training in the operation and \nmaintenance of these systems. \n \nComponent 5:   \nProject Management  ?? Four female project gender specialists will be hired by the provincial \nSupport  coordination unit at the latest by 1 July 2003 to ensure integration of \ngender issues in all phases and activities of the Project. \n?? The initial survey to be undertaken at the start of the Project, and \nsubsequent surveys at midterm and at project completion, will be gender \ndisaggregated and include gender-relevant impact indicators acceptable \nto ADB.  \n?? Gender audits for curriculum materials and training for gender \nawareness will be an integral part of all project activities and the \nresponsibility of the district gender specialist. \n?? As a response to the acute lack of female field staff at the local \ngovernment level and below, thematic NGOs will be hired to provide \nsupport to CBOs in strengthening organization. \n?? One car per district has been budgeted for the gender-related \nactivities\u2014to be coordinated by the district gender specialist. \n?? The district gender specialists will organize gender-awareness training \nfor the local government executive district officers and district officers, \nand for involved partner agencies; training will adopt a practice-related, \nhands-on approach and focus on concrete examples from the project \narea. \n??

Introduction \n1.  To a large extent, many of the expected economic benefits of the Sindh Rural Development \nProject cannot be readily quantified, particularly those from the improved governance and legal \nsupport component, the enhanced social processes at the community level component, and the \nupgraded rural infrastructure and settlement improvement component. For example, the improved \ngovernance and legal support component aims to improve recognition of and compliance with, legal \nrights, and build the institutional capacities of stakeholders. Similarly, the enhanced social processes \nat the community level component aims to organize the communities to benefit from activities to \nimprove their livelihoods and to ensure implementation of activities in the improved governance and \nlegal  support  component.  Activities  under  the  upgraded  rural  infrastructure  and  settlement \nimprovement  component  aim  to  improve  living  conditions  by  upgrading  drinking  water  supply, \nsanitation,  drainage,  street  pavement  and  access,  and  will  result  in  benefits  that  are  largely \nunquantifiable.  \n \n2.  Activities under the improved rural livelihoods component and the improved district link roads \nsubcomponent have more quantifiable benefits. As the development of village groups is the key to \ndelivery of the services in all components, and project management support facilitates efficient \nimplementation,  costs  pertaining  to  these  components  have  been  appropriately  apportioned \nbetween all components. \n \nB.  Methodology \n3.  The  Project  has  an  implementation  period  of  7  years  and  the  economic  life  of  the \ninterventions  has  been  assumed  to  be  20  years.  The  prevailing  interbank  exchange  rate \n(PRs60.12/$1) has been used and a discount rate of 12% adopted for net present value (NPV) \nassessments. A world price numeraire has been used. World Bank commodity price projections \nhave been used to estimate economic prices for traded crop outputs and inputs. Prices for wheat, \nrice paddy, and seed cotton are based on export parity, while import parity is used for sugarcane, \nmilk, urea and di-ammonium phosphate (Supplementary Appendix E). To reflect local under- and \nunemployment in the labor market, a shadow wage rate of 0.75 of the market wage is incorporated, \nwhile other inputs have been adjusted by a standard conversion factor of 0.90. For the purpose of \nthis analysis, the crop and livestock models adopted are described in Appendix 2.  \n \n1.  District Link Roads Models \n \n4.  The methodology employed to evaluate the district roads subcomponent closely follows that \nadopted for the recently approved Road Sector Development Program.1 The main impact has been \nassumed to be savings in the vehicle operating costs (Table A11.1). Passenger traffic levels are \nbased  on  the  survey  data  from  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  and  small-scale \ntechnical assistance and data used by the Road Sector Development Program. Goods traffic \nvolumes have been quantified by estimating village level production and consumption levels and \nassessing the volumes of surpluses and deficits to be transported. Benefits have been quantified by \ncomparing the weighted average costs of transportation with and without the district link roads. \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

This sector loan includes the Sindh Rural \nDevelopment Project\u2019s districts and presents a sample assessment for one of the roads in Sanghar district. The \nmethodology for the economic evaluation uses high density model III parameters and takes into account traffic \ncongestion effects. The model predicts pavement deterioration and estimates yearly vehicle operating costs over the life \nof the investment for various maintenance and improvement strategies. The model then compares life cycle costs for \neach strategy with base costs and computes the net present value (NPV) and estimates the internal rate of return. \n ", "48  Appendix 11 \nTable A11.1: Economic Vehicle Operating Costs on Unimproved and \nImproved Roads \n \nVehicle Operating Costs (PRs/km) \nVehicle Type  Unimproved  Improved  Savings \nAnimal-Drawn  8.48  6.36  2.12 \nBicycle  2.12  1.59  0.53 \nMotorcycle  2.86  1.48  1.38 \nCar  12.40  4.88  7.53 \nPickup  24.06  11.24  12.83 \nBus  49.82  24.59  25.23 \nTractor Trolley/Truck  54.17  27.56  26.61 \n          Source:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.  Project Benefits \n1.  Improved Rural Livelihoods Benefits \n5.  It has been assumed that the Project will facilitate strengthening of 3,200 village groups \ninvolving 96,000 households. Activities will be needs based and the mix will vary between groups, \nbut for this analysis it is assumed that 50% of the village groups will opt for programs involving \nimprovements  in  crop  and  livestock  production.  Given  that  the  target  groups  have  a  high \ndependence  on  agriculture,  the  assumed  coverage  is  conservative,  but  takes  into  account \nlandowner resistance to village group formation and the groups that become inactive. \n \n6.  Besides the introduction of participatory extension methods complemented by technical \ntraining, the Project incorporates farmer training in crop and livestock production; improved irrigation \nwater use; integrated pest management; and improved village-level seed multiplication, as well as \nmilk and dairy product marketing. It is expected that adoption rates for the technological packages \nwill be high; however, it has been assumed that, in aggregate, only 40% of the village group \nmembers exposed to agricultural activities will adopt the new packages. It has been further assumed \nthat adoption rates will follow an S-curve and will build up over a period of 5 years from the time a \nparticular group has been exposed to the agricultural extension. The aggregate cropped areas with \nand without the Project are summarized in Table A11.2. Resulting incremental production will be \nless than 2% of current production in the four districts, and hence the Project is not like to create any \nprice effects or marketing problems. \n \nTable A11.2: Changes in the Cropping Pattern \n \n  Cropped Area (ha) \nCrops  Without  With  Change % \nWheat  32,880  32,880  - \nSeed Cotton  22,080  22,080  - \nRice Paddy  24,000  24,000  - \nSugarcane  10,320  10,320  - \nKharif Fodder  5,520  5,520  - \nRabi Fodder  6,960  6,960  - \nVegetables  11,640  11,880  2.0 \nPulses  3,600  3,600  - \nOilseeds  3,720  3,720  - \n         Source:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.  Improved District Link Roads Benefits \n7.  By upgrading 200 kilometers of district link roads, the Project improves access for an \nestimated 38,500 households in 200 villages, impacting an estimated current annual passenger \n ", "  Appendix 11  49 \ntraffic of 4.64 million trips and goods traffic of 1.01 million tons.2 Passenger traffic has been assumed \nto  grow  at  5%  per  annum  and  goods  traffic  at  2%  per  annum.  Based  on  the  vehicle  traffic \ncomposition in the small-scale technical assistance sample villages and assumed vehicle operating \ncosts (Table A10.1), the cost savings on the passenger traffic and the goods traffic are estimated at \nPRs0.84 per trip and PRs10.66 per ton respectively. \n \n3.  Nonquantifiable Benefits \n \n8.  The Project will generate a wide  range of nonquantifiable benefits under the improved \ngovernance and legal support component. Implementation of the Amended Sindh Tenancy Act, \n1950 will improve lives of tenants through more favorable sharing arrangements. Some 575 field \nstaff and 40 taluka and district officers of the Revenue Administration will be trained. Proper \nmaintenance of records will enable tenants to benefit from protection against eviction under the \nlegislation and exercising their fundamental rights. This component includes a rights awareness \ncampaign through mass media, which will benefit beyond the four districts. Accompanied by legal \nadvice from 24 paralegals trained by the Project, this will enable target groups to access the legal \nsystem. \n \n9.  The main purpose of the village groups developed under the enhanced social processes at \nthe community level component is to act as delivery mechanism for all project services. The 3,200 \nvillage groups covering some 96,000 households will be provided with functional and numeric \nliteracy training. Improved literacy will enable them to keep records of their transactions, and provide \naccess to information on rights, hygiene and basic health, nutrition, and basic livelihood skills, as \nwell as on accessing credit. \n \n10.  The improved rural livelihoods component will reduce workloads and improve the quality of \nlife through introducing appropriate household technologies in some 1,600 villages and through \nreducing water logging and salinity in a similar number of villages. It will also support and facilitate \nthe expansion of income generation activities that will have spillover benefits to the nontarget \ngroups. \n \n11.  The  upgraded  rural  infrastructure  and  settlement  improvement  component  will  impact \npositively  on  450  smaller  villages  (50\u2013100  households)  and  300  larger  villages  (100\u2013200 \nhouseholds) involving an estimated 78,500 households. The activities mix in each settlement will \nvary according to needs. It is anticipated that these will include drinking water supply, sanitation, \ndrainage, street pavements, and village link roads. In addition, district link roads will result in savings \nin travel time, improved access to social services such as health and education, reduced consumer \nprices, improved market access, and reduced spoilage. \n \nD.  Project Costs \n12.  All costs are in constant year 2001/02 terms. Investment costs are net of price contingencies \nand interest during construction. The local content of costs other than labor has been adjusted by \nthe standard conversion factor. The costs of project management support have been apportioned \namong the other four project components according to the relative size of their investment costs. In \nthe enhancing social processes at the community level component, one third of the cost has been \napportioned to the improved rural livelihoods component while the remainder has been assigned to \nthe improved governance and legal support component and the improved settlement infrastructure \nsubcomponent (part of the upgraded rural infrastructure and settlement improvement component). \n  \n                                                 \n2  Based on an annual trip rate of 21.5 for the project area and on rural consumption patterns reported by the 1988 \nHousehold Integrated Economic Survey. \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \nE.  Economic Analysis \n1.  Economic Worth \n \n13.  The improved rural livelihoods component generates an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) of 17.3% and an economic NPV of about PRs101.6 million ($1.7 million). Analysis examines \nsensitivity  of  project  performance  to  cost  overruns,  reduced  incremental  benefits,  and \nimplementation delays (Table A11.3), and shows that the economic worth is not particularly sensitive \nto these factors. Switching values at a discount rate of 12% shows that the component will remain \nviable at a cost overrun of up to 41% or a benefit reduction of up to 29%. \n \nTable A11.3: Economic Worth of the Improved Rural Livelihoods Component \n \nEIRR  NPV at a Discount Rate of 12% \nScenario  (%)  (PRs million)  ($ million) \nBase Case  17.3  101.6  1.7 \nBenefits Delayed by 1 Year  14.7  54.0  0.9 \n10% Reduction in Incremental Benefits  15.6  66.1  1.1 \n10% Increase in Development Costs  15.7  76.2  1.3 \n             EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \n             Source:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.

Poverty in Pakistan \n1.  After falling in the 1980s, poverty rose in Pakistan during the 1990s. At the end of the \n1980s, one of five Pakistanis were poor; today it is one in three.1 The Planning Commission \nannounced Pakistan\u2019s official poverty line in July 2002.2 Estimates agree on the incidence of \npoverty currently ranging at 30\u201335% with poverty being higher in rural than urban areas. \nPockets of severe poverty exist in southern Punjab, almost all of Balochistan, and large parts of \nSindh.  Poverty  is  also  manifested  along  gender  lines.  Women\u2019s  access  and  control  over \nproductive  resources  are  extremely  limited.  Women\u2019s  mobility  is  restricted,  and  gender \nsegregation and female seclusion are practiced. The female labor force participation rate is very \nlow, but women play a significant role in the agriculture sector.  \n \nB.  Rural Livelihoods and Poverty in the Project Area \n1.  Social Organization and Village Pattern \n2.  Heterogeneity and Complexity of Rural Society. Rural society in the project area is \nheterogeneous and highly complex. The distribution of power is along the lines of caste, tribe, \nreligion,  gender,  political  affiliation, and origin. It follows traditional rules, which define the \nrelationship between the poor and the ruling class. Stratification along poverty lines is low with \nthe majority of the village population poor or very poor and consisting of haris, agricultural \nlaborers, and marginal owners-cum-tenants.3 Besides sedentary groups, an unknown number of \nsemi-nomadic  groups  from  the  Thar  Desert  follow  well-established  migration  patterns  and \nrespond to contemporary labor demands in the agricultural areas of the four project districts. \nThey settle temporarily at the fringes of villages, on public or private land, where water, grazing \ngrounds, or work opportunities allow them to survive for limited periods of time.  \n \n3.  Village Pattern and Internal Organization. Single villages (goths) can be more or less \nhomogeneous in their composition with people belonging to one or more castes or kinship \ngroups. The villages are clearly demarcated by fences, thorny bushes, or walls into areas, \ncalled para. Paras are internally homogeneous and often share common ancestors. They are \nfurther subdivided into extended families, which can comprise several households. Households \nare defined as groups of people sharing one common kitchen. The goth is an exclusive \ngeographic  area  of  its  residents.  Its  informal  rules  govern  the  patterns  of  affiliation  and \nleadership. Depending on the caste or tribal affiliation, women from different paras may (or may \nnot) be able to visit each other. The rules of purdah and gender segregation apply to different \ndegrees. Women from outside can move freely inside the goth, while male visitors to a village \nhave only restricted access.  Despite this heterogeneity, villages can be organized by a body \nfrom outside the village around common interests, using local knowledge of the delicately \nbalanced relationships, the distribution of power, behavioral restrictions, norms, and traditions. \nOrganizations able to assist in this process need to be from the area and understand its power \nstructures.  \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001. Country Strategy and Program Update: Pakistan.  \n2   This was put at 2,350 calories per adult/day (2,150 calories for urban adults, 2,450 calories for rural adults). On \nthe basis of the 1998/99 Pakistan Integrated Household Survey, the poverty line has been placed at PRs670 per \ncapita per month, which translates into $0.56 per capita per day based on the average exchange rate for 1998/99. \n3   Those with less than 2 hectares. \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \n2.  Access to Land, Infrastructure, Services, and Employment \n4.  Access to land and water is the basis for wealth. Land ownership is highly inequitable. \nThe Agricultural Census of 1990 reported that 9.6% of the farm holdings are cultivating 43.1% of \nthe  total  farm  area  in  the  four  project  districts,  whereas  22.7%  of  the  farm  holdings  are \ncultivating just 5.5% of the total farm area. Roads linking villages to the main road network are \ninadequate and are little more than earth (katcha) tracks, suitable only for motorcycles, tractors, \nand bullock carts. Access to safe drinking water is extremely limited. According to the 1998 \ncensus, only 10.5% of the rural population in the four districts have access to potable drinking \nwater. The vast majority of the villages depend on watercourses, wells, canals, lakes, and \nponds for drinking water and household needs. The sanitation facilities are extremely poor. The \nlack of safe drinking water and sanitation are the sources of major health hazards. The adult \nliteracy rates are abysmal, at 10.5% for women and 34.7% for men. About 90% of the rural \npopulation are engaged in crop production and animal husbandry as their primary occupation. \nMost of them are sharecroppers and agricultural wage laborers. Other job opportunities are \nlimited to few trades such as blacksmiths, carpenters, water carriers, weavers, barbers, and \nother services.

Sharecropping Tenancy in Sindh \n5.  Tenancy System. The tenancy system in southern Sindh is concentrated in the canal-\nirrigated areas of the four districts. It is deep-rooted and its feudal features reflect an extremely \nskewed  distribution  of  power.  Although  slowly  decreasing  in  importance,  tenancy  under \nsharecropping arrangements continues as a major type of land tenure. The tenant is the hari\u2014\nliterally, \u201cwielder of the plough\u201d.4 Under a simple sharing system, the landlord provided the land \nto a hari and his family, and paid land revenue and water charges. The hari provided the labor, \na pair of bullocks, and covered all other costs. The output was shared equally. Contracts were \nand still are oral, with the minimum contract period being 1 year.  \n \n6.  The relationship between the landlord  and  the  hari  is  far  more  than  an  economic \narrangement. It is a complex system, with advantages and disadvantages for both sides, but \nfrom a contemporary perspective it is a highly imbalanced relationship. The control over major \nresources (land and water) is in the hands of the landlord, who also decides on the crops to \ncultivate and on the use of the family labor. The landlord may ask the hari or his family members \nfor labor without payment (begar). On the other side, the hari-landlord relationship is also one of \nrespect, with the landlord appreciating agricultural knowledge and skills and the commitment of \nthe hari to his work. For the hari, the landlord provides continuity and stability in the labor \narrangement, and credit in cash or in kind when needed. Trust and confidence have therefore \nalso been characteristics of the relationship (Table A12.2). The system also provides ample \nopportunities for abuse, with ethnic, political, religious, and gender dimensions increasing this \nlikelihood.  Non-Muslim  haris,  mostly  from  the  Hindu  scheduled  castes,  are  considered \neconomically more disadvantaged and oppressed. Muslim haris with particular clan and caste \nties have stronger links and better bargaining positions with respect to landlords. \n  \nTable A12.2: The Landlord-Hari Relationship: \nAdvantages and Disadvantages \n \nLandlords  Haris \nAdvantages  Disadvantages  Advantages  Disadvantages \n??

The influx of migrants, the changes in landownership through \nthe awarding of large tracts of land to nonresidents, increased availability of irrigated land, \nintroduction of mechanization, high-yield varieties, and pesticides and fertilizers have further \naltered the system to the disadvantage of the hari. It has been influenced and changed by \nmodern legislation with the Sindh Tenancy Act, 1950 attempting to regulate the informal tenancy \narrangements and to protect the rights of the cultivators. According to the Act the landlords are \nrequired, for example, to register their tenants for them to acquire certain tenancy rights. \n                                                 \n4  The Sindh Tenancy Act uses the terms hari and tenant synonymously. It defines a tenant as a person who \npersonally cultivates the land of another person (the landlord). This document uses the term hari. \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \nHowever, this registration very often does not take place in Sindh. There is a trend to transform \nsharecropping into daily wage labor arrangements.  \n \n8.  Debt and Credit Dimension. Haris get into debt through advances they receive from \nthe landlord in cash or kind (peshgi) to meet costs of cultivation or simply to cover regular \nhousehold consumption requirements. The expectation is that the account is settled at the time \nof the harvest, but in reality the debt accumulates from one year to the next, as the share of the \nyield is not enough to survive, let alone to pay off the loans.5 If a hari wants to move, the new \nlandlord takes over the accumulated debt. The landlord keeps the account, transactions are \nrarely transparent, and the landlord may be overvaluing inputs and undervaluing outputs. But \neven if accounts were managed more openly, haris\u2019 extremely low literacy rate would inhibit \ntheir control over the entries. According to the project preparatory technical assistance report, \nthe sizes of their loans ranged between PRs20,000 and more than PRs100,000. Indebtedness \nis widespread. In fact in Badin, 74% of the hari households were indebted to the landlord, in \nMirpurkhas the indebtedness was 100%. In Sanghar, indebtedness was reported by the small-\nscale technical assistance report at between PRs5,000 and more than PRs30,000. This is \nconfirmed through another study6 in Sanghar, according to which virtually all haris in one of the \nstudy villages were indebted to the landlord. Haris are not allowed to leave the landlord unless \nthey clear their accumulated debt, which is possible only with a cash advance from another \nlandlord.7 This relationship of debt bondage is a politically sensitive issue. Landlords in Sindh, \ngovernment representatives, and other power holders continue to deny the existence of bonded \nlabor, using a variety of strategies. Some argue that the phenomenon is culturally deep-rooted \nand cannot be understood by outsiders. Others agree to a limited number of abuses. However, \nthe application of specific legislation against bonded labor\u2014namely the Bonded Labour System \n(Abolition) Act, 1992\u2014to agricultural labor has been questioned and is currently under review in \nthe Supreme Court of Pakistan. \n \nC.

Introduction \n1.  In accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines, an initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) was carried out as an integral part of the project preparatory technical \nassistance (PPTA). The IEE assessed likely environmental impacts of project implementation \nand identified measures needed to prevent or mitigate any possible adverse impacts. The \nProject is classified as Environment Category B, as per ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Environmental \nAssessment of Project Impacts. Project interventions were further screened with reference to \nADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural and Natural Resources Development \nProjects. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The Project has the goal of reducing poverty in four districts of southern Sindh through \nincreasing empowerment and improving governance and access to public services, transferring \ntechnology for improved livelihoods, and providing essential infrastructure. Its objective is to \nimprove  the  social  status  and  economic  well-being  of  (i) haris  and  agriculture  laborers, \n(ii) marginal owners-cum-tenants, and (iii) small village-based artisans. This objective will be \nachieved through (i) improved governance and legal support, (ii) enhanced social processes at \nthe community level, (iii) improved rural livelihoods, and (iv) upgraded rural infrastructure and \nsettlement improvement. A detailed project description is included in the main text of the report.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment  \n3.  Geographic Zones. Geographically, the four districts may be divided into two zones: \n(i) coastal, which includes the South of Badin and Thatta districts; and (ii) southern, which \nincludes the alluvial plains of the River Indus from the east of the Kirthar mountains to the Thar \nDesert. \n \n4.  Most of the area is positioned on the vast alluvial plain laid down by the Indus River \nsystem. The soils are immature, they lack developed weathering characteristics, and have \ntextures closely related to local depositional conditions, but most of them are silty loams or silty \nclay loams. They generally possess good infiltration characteristics and medium to good water-\nholding capacities. Soil pH lies in the 7.8 to 8.3 range and organic matter content is 0.4\u20130.5%. \nThe vast network of irrigation canals brought about a major alteration in the ecology of the area, \nmainly because there was no provision for an accompanying system of drainage canals, or of \nconcrete lining of the irrigation canals and distributaries to retard seepage of water. The \ndeleterious impact of this nonsustainable approach became apparent, the water table began to \nrise, and, gradually, the groundwater levels, which had previously been recorded at a depth of 5 \nmeters (m), rose to the root zone in many locations. Soil chemistry changed since each hectare-\nfoot of irrigation water annually added 0.40\u20130.45 tons of salts to each hectare (ha) of irrigated \nland. Soils became gradually salinized and lost their productivity. The climate of the irrigated \narea changed slightly and became more humid as a result of increased transpiration and \nsurface water evaporation. \n \n5.  Mitigation measures to restrict the rise of groundwater to the root zone were introduced \nthrough the Left Bank Outfall Drainage(LBOD) and the Right Bank Outfall Drainage systems in \nthe mid-1990s. However, only part of Mirpurkhas district in the project area is expected to \nbenefit from these drainage systems. Moreover, field observations suggest that while water \ntables have been lowered within a 1 kilometer (km) radius of each functioning tubewell, there \n ", "  Appendix 13  57 \nhas been virtually no reduction in the salinity of the land. The prevailing practice of inundation \nirrigation has taken away the benefits of the system by substantially lowering the productivity of \nthe land, thereby forcing its abandonment.  \n \n6.  The ecology of the coastal district of Badin is governed by its irrigation network, and the \nvirtually flat and barren coastal reaches?the Rann of Kutch?into which the LBOD system \ndrains its saline effluent. The mean height above sea level of this region lies entirely below the \n5 m contour. This is the main reason for the havoc caused by the May 1999 cyclone, which \npushed the seawater far inland. Little natural vegetation remains except in bands of emergent \naquatics, shrubs, and a few trees surrounding wetland sites. Of the farm area, 17.6% consists of \nwaterlogged or salinized lands; forested land makes up a tiny 0.25% of the area. \n \n7.  The ecology of Mirpurkhas and the western parts of Sanghar district is governed by the \ncanal irrigation network and the LBOD system, which drains saline effluent from some of its \nareas. The former has been adversely impacted by an overall shortage of water. However, the \ntendency of large landholders as well as small farmers is to irrigate as much land as possible, \ndespite the inadequacy of the available water supply over the entire growing season. The LBOD \nsystem has yet to be optimized since it has lowered the water table by about 1 m in a restricted \nzone of a 1 km radius of each tubewell installed in some locations, and has not reduced the \nsalinity of the soil nor restored its productivity. The eastern part of Mirpurkhas and Sanghar \ndistricts lies outside the canal-irrigated system and hence the project area.  \n \n8.  Each side of the Indus floodplain is irrigated by canals emanating from the Kotri barrage. \nIn the absence of an adequate drainage system, about 16.8% of the farm area has become \nwaterlogged and/or salinized while the area under forest cover has shrunk to 1.35%. The \nirrigation system has been adversely affected by an overall and increasing shortage of water; \nyet the tendency of all farmers is to irrigate more land than can be done by the limited supply \nfrom the canals.  \n \n9.  Human and Economic Development. The total population of the four districts is about \n4.2 million. Income is generally sourced from agriculture. Villages are facing shortages of all \nagricultural inputs, and exhibit severely impoverished and degraded environments. Overall, \n64.8%  of  the  villages  have  a  population  of  less  than  50  households. They have neither \ncommercial nor small-scale enterprises that can add value to their produce. Even the urbanized \ncommunities with limited agro-industry bear a rural character and exhibit a highly degraded \nenvironment.  \n   \n10.  Wildlife Populations. Very little upland wildlife is present in the project area owing \nmainly to intensive habitat modification brought about by extensive cultivation and dense human \npopulation. The persistent species include gray francolins, rabbits, and raptorial birds. A small \npeacock population is still present, though in a protected status in a few locations. The recent \nexpansion in sugarcane production in the canal command area has benefited the wild boar (Sus \nscrofa) population, which utilizes the extensive cane fields for both food and shelter, and has \ngreatly multiplied in number. \n \n11.  Several lakes and wetlands (e.g., Tando Bago, Phoosna, Charwo, and Khanjo lakes in \nBadin district and Jafri and Mahboob Shah lakes in the coastal area of Thatta district) are home \nto significant waterfowl habitat. The natural and artificial shallow lakes are wintering areas for \nwaterfowl populations that breed in Siberia. Large flocks of ducks, including marbled and \nwhistling teals, pintail, mallard, gadwall, red-crested pochard, shoveller, and ruddy shelduck are \npresent on these water bodies from about September to March. Other common species are little \ngrebe, grayleg goose, pelican, and black-winged stilt. Thatta district also includes the Kinjhar, \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \nHadero, and Haleji lakes as the officially recognized wetlands of international significance under \nthe  United  Nations'  Ramsar  Convention.  It  may  be  pointed  out,  however,  that  the  bird \npopulations over-wintering on the wetlands of the project area are all threatened by illegal \nshooting. The area along the Nara canal in Sanghar district is home to the Marsh crocodile and \nwaterfowl, especially the marble teal. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures  \n12.  The  appropriate  ADB  guidelines  were  selected  and  a  checklist  of  environmental \nparameters was used to identify and screen the potential environmental impacts of different \nproject components and to suggest possible mitigation measures. In the absence of ADB \nguidelines specific to multisector small-scale interventions proposed in a rural development \nproject such as the present one and in order to comply with ADB's environmental assessment \nrequirements, the specific guidelines consulted for screening of proposed project interventions \nwere as follows (i) Selected Infrastructure Projects: Highways and Roads; and (ii) Selected \nInfrastructure Projects: Water Supply. \n \n1.  Upgraded Rural Infrastructure and Settlement Improvement \n13.  Under this project component, it is proposed to upgrade two types of rural roads. First, \naround 750 km of gravel village link roads will connect selected villages either directly to the \ndistrict road network or to a neighboring village itself connected to the district network. Second, \nfor selected clusters of project villages interconnected by village link roads, the Project will \nprovide for some 200 km of bituminous district link roads that will connect the cluster to the \nexisting district road network. The village link roads will have a raised embankment and a \ncompacted carriageway of suitable material (gravel or broken bricks) and associated small-\nscale structures (culverts and short-span bridges) to provide year-round access. The district link \nroads will generally be 3.1\u20133.6 m wide, with compacted gravel shoulders including side ditches, \ndrainage structures, and short bridge spans as required. In general, district link roads will \ntypically be 3\u20134 km in length, and village link roads 2\u20133 km, and both will follow existing \nalignments,  but  with  flexible  geometric  design  standards  to  avoid  land  acquisition  and \ninvoluntary resettlement.  \n \n14.  The types of road envisaged for upgrading are of a small scale and the traffic is \nexpected to be limited and localized. All roads will be located in areas that have little remaining \nnatural environment, and the selection process includes conducting an environmental sensitivity \nscreening and compliance with strict environmental impact criteria. The potential impacts are \nprimarily  construction  related.  The  nature  of  the  work  will  be  entirely  rehabilitation  or \nimprovement of existing alignments, and the construction periods are expected to be short. \nAppropriate design and construction standards that will be monitored and followed by timely and \nsuitable maintenance will ensure effective mitigation of potential minor environmental impacts. \nThe  prevalent  problem  of  surface  ponding  during  the  rainy  season  will  be  addressed  by \nensuring  adequate  cross  drainage.  The  Project  will  provide  training  to  the  communities \nresponsible for the operation and maintenance of the village link roads. \n \n15.  The  settlement  infrastructure  improvement  subcomponent  will  encompass  the \nprovision/upgrading  of  domestic  drinking  water  supplies  using  different  least-cost, low and \nrobust technology, and simple to operate and maintain tested models (e.g., shallow dugwells or \nsmall-scale tubewells connected to hand pumps; reservoir for storage, filtration and treatment of \nsurface water diverted from irrigation watercourses) Wastewater drainage systems will also be \nupgraded, with localized treatment and disposal. Localized village infrastructure (e.g., village \nlanes) will be improved. These small-scale and localized interventions will not cause negative \n ", "  Appendix 13  59 \nimpacts on the environment during construction or operation; on the contrary, they will improve \nthe living standards in the project area. Since water quality is problematic in the project area, the \ndrinking water supplies will need appropriate testing. Communities will receive awareness \ntraining in maintaining minimum standards of hygiene and sanitation and in conservation of \nscarce water supplies. \n \n16.  During  construction  of  the  district  roads,  there  will  be  some  minor  and  temporary \ndisruption to the surroundings and the environment. Potential environmental issues may include \nsoil erosion, siltation and increase in runoff, waste generation and effluent from temporary \nconstruction camps, noise pollution, air pollution from dust, and increased traffic congestion. \nThese issues will be minimized through appropriate environmental management measures \nspecified  at  the  detailed  design  stage.  Some  of  the  mitigation  measures  may  include \n(i) construction area should be restricted to minimize area disturbed; (ii) soil erosion control \nmethods should be incorporated; (iii) watering of construction sites to reduce dust should be \nundertaken; (iv) waste management measures should be introduced at construction sites and \ncamps; (v) hazardous materials should be safely stored; (vi) groundwater contact should be \nminimized during construction; (vii) vegetation disruption should be limited at construction sites \nand  removal  of  significant  habitat  vegetation  avoided;  and  (viii) disturbed areas should be \nreturned to previous conditions or an improved state. All mitigation requirements will be included \nin the contract document for the contractor and for sensitive areas a performance bond system \nmight be included. Monitoring of environmental effects of the construction activities will be \nundertaken by the project engineer. At the operation stage, periodic microbiological testing of \ngroundwater will be undertaken. In areas close to sensitive areas such as wetlands the water \ntable and water sources will be carefully monitored in terms of any changes in hydrology and \nwater quality. Structured and planned preventive maintenance programs will be developed for \nall facilities constructed under the Project and for existing facilities. \n \n2.  Improved Rural Livelihoods \n17.  The objective of this component is to strengthen the performance of tenants, agricultural \nlaborers, and marginal owners-cum-tenants through improvements to crop cultivation and on-\nfarm water management practices, horticulture, and livestock. The proposed interventions were \nassessed in terms of their sustainability. The examination was conducted within the context of \nprevious land use regimes, which have already brought about severe losses to land productively \nover extensive areas through the twin processes of waterlogging and salinity. The agriculture \ninterventions proposed in the project will result in a reduction of the amounts of fertilizer and \npesticides  discharged  into  the  environment,  and  will  have  positive  environmental  impact. \nSimilarly improvement in farming activities will reduce the degree of waterlogging and soil \nsalinity of the land. This component will not require any further environmental assessment or \nmonitoring. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n18.  Environmental impact considerations are included as one of the selection criteria for the \nrural  infrastructure  subcomponent.  Moreover,  for  each  rural  infrastructure intervention, an \nenvironmental sensitivity screening will be conducted. Consultants and the Sindh Environmental \nProtection Agency will ensure that environmental assessments, where required, are conducted \nand adequately endorsed, and that standards are upheld. Government approved laboratories \nwill be used to test the drinking water and provide quality monitoring after construction of the \nschemes. Implementation of mitigation measures during the construction stage will be the \nresponsibility of the contractor under the supervision of the relevant district government office.  \n \n ", "60  Appendix 13 \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n19.  The  overriding  environmental  impact  on  the  project  area  has  been  the  extensive \nwaterlogging and salinization caused by the Indus Basin irrigation system. As a result, the \nproject area has extensive tracts of land that is no longer suitable for cultivation. The level of \nintervention and expenditure needed to correct this situation is clearly beyond the capacity of \nthe Project. But careful attention to soil fertility and groundwater conditions in planning and \nimplementing particular agricultural and infrastructure interventions will be given in order to bring \nlocal improvement in land capability. In the case of construction-related impacts, these are \nlocalized and temporary in nature and can be minimized through careful planning, proper \nconstruction practices and efficient environmental monitoring. \n \n20.  Overall, the Project is not expected to result in adverse environmental impacts. It is even \nlikely  to  bring  about  positive  impacts,  including  (i) improved  management  of  fertilizer  and \npesticide inputs, (ii) improved water management, and (iii) greater environmental awareness of \nthe communities. \n \nG.  Conclusions \n21.  The IEE has shown that no major impacts will arise from the Project that warrant \nexamination by a full environmental impact assessment. This is also in accordance with the \nframework of Pakistan\u2019s National Conservation Strategy, which is the fundamental national \npolicy document on environmental protection and natural resource conservation. Individual \ninterventions are at small scale, focusing on individual villages or clusters of villages. These \ninterventions are not expected to have major negative environmental impacts. However, if \nproperly implemented, improvements and strengthening of land use performance, including \ncultivation,  livestock  rearing  and  water  use  improvements,  have  the  potential  to  improve \nenvironmental conditions within the project area.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R229-02 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021031085903Z", "Title": "R229-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030110094654+08'00'"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 19 September 2002) \n \nCurrency Unit  \u2013  Pakistan rupee/s (PRe/PRs) \n \nPRe1.00  =  $.01688     \n$1.00  =  PRs59.225     \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  BOR  \u2013  Board of Revenue \n  CBO  \u2013  community-based organization \n  EIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \n  ha  \u2013  hectare \n  IEE  \u2013  initial environmental examination \n  ILO  \u2013  International Labour Organization \n  IPRSP  \u2013  Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \n  KB  \u2013  Khushhalibank \n  LBOD  \u2013  Left Bank Outfall Drainage \n  LGD  \u2013  Local Government Department \n  LRA  \u2013  Land Revenue Act \n  MTR  \u2013  midterm review \n  NGO  \u2013  nongovernment organization \n  NIC  \u2013  national identity card \n  NPV  \u2013  net present value \n  O&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \n  PCU  \u2013  provincial coordination unit \n  PIO  \u2013  project implementation office \n  PIR  \u2013  poverty impact ratio \n  PPTA  \u2013  project preparatory technical assistance \n  PSC  \u2013  provincial steering committee \n  SKAA  \u2013  Sindh Katchi Abadis Authority \n  SRDP  \u2013  Sindh Rural Development Project \n  SSTA  \u2013  small-scale technical assistance \n  STA  \u2013  Sindh Tenancy Act \n  ZPC  \u2013  zila project committee \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 June.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of: Karin Oswald (Team Leader), Caroline \nVandenabeele, Alain Goffeau, and Eva Maria Mayerhofer.  \n \n ", "authors": [{"fullname": "Vandenabeele", "role": "Alain Goffeau", "organization": "and Eva Maria Mayerhofer"}]}
