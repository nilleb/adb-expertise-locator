To mitigate the risks of external \nshocks and meet the demand for needed infrastructure investment for longer-term sustainable \neconomic  development,  Mongolia  needs  to  ensure  that  it  has  a  well-functioning  domestic \nresources  mobilization  mechanism.  Improving  the  efficiency  of  its  tax  administration  and \neffectiveness of its public service delivery through a PIM system predicated on principles such as \ntransparency, efficiency, and effectiveness is key to achieving this. Transparency is essential to \nmake  the  government  more  accountable,  while  efficiency  and  effectiveness  are  necessary  for \nbetter and more effective use of limited public resources for delivery of needed public services. \n \n4. \nEfforts to modernize and improve public finance management systems and arrangements \nin Mongolia have been consistent in direction, even if at times they have materialized slower than \nplanned.  The  government\u2014with  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  World \nBank,  and  other  development  partners\u2014has  made  meaningful  progress  in  achieving  the  key \nobjectives  of  prudent  public  financial  management:  maintaining  fiscal  discipline,  strategic \nallocation of resources, and operational efficiency in the delivery of goods and services. The legal \nand regulatory framework has also been strengthened through the enactment of the Budget Law \n(2002, amended 2011) and investments in ICT systems both for tax administration and PIM. \n \n5. \nHowever, as identified in assessments carried out under ADB technical assistance (TA) \nin 20142 and the World Bank 2015 Public Expenditure and Financial Management Performance \nreport, 3  challenges  with  public  financial  management  remain\u2014high  tax  arrears,  inefficient \ntaxpayer management, limited transparency, and ineffective tax collection\u2014while the PIM system \nsuffers from lack of longer-term fiscal planning, inefficient allocation and management of public \nresources,  and  a  weak  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanism.  Existing  ICT  systems  are \nfragmented, and there is also a lack of integrated information exchange and inefficient business \nprocesses. \n \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2014.

Public Expenditure and Financial Management Performance Report. Washington, DC. \n \n\n\fTax administration system: Government revenues are mainly generated from taxation \n6. \nand  royalties  from  the  mining  industry.4 There  are  over  20  types  of  taxes  administered  by  the \nMongolian  Tax  Authority  (MTA)  based  on  the  General  Law  of  Mongolia  on  Taxation  (2008) \ncovering  the  entire  range  of  direct  and  indirect  taxes  except  customs  duty  and  excise  tax  on \ncertain  goods,  imported  vehicles,  petroleum,  and  other  fuel.  The  MTA  is  the  central  tax \nadministration authority consisting of a number of entities, including the state administrative body \n(referred to as the General Department of Taxation), the agencies\u2019 offices, and tax branches at \nthe provincial and district level.5 Tax offices and branches at the local level independently carry \nout  tax  administration  and  only  periodically  provide  data  to  the  central  server  in  the  General \nDepartment of Taxation.  \n \n7. \nAn effective tax administration system consists of well-defined business processes that \ninclude  taxpayer  registration,  tax  collection,  verification,  accounting  and  auditing,  and  other \nsupporting mechanisms.  However,  the  existing  ICT  systems for tax  administration in Mongolia \nwere  developed  to  merely  replicate  the  manual  business  processes,  providing  for  isolated \nadministration  of  each  tax  without  leveraging  taxpayer  data  across  the  registered  taxes.  The \ncurrent tax filing and payment compliance processes and systems require strengthening so that \nthey can automatically flag suspected cases for detailed assessment and audits. \n \n8. \nA  well-designed  and  integrated  ICT  system  has  a  substantial  role  in  improving  the \ntaxpayer base as it enables the government to (i) identify unregistered and potential taxpayers; \n(ii) manage the life cycle of taxpayer registration and tax liabilities assessment, collection, and \nreporting; and (iii) enhance accountability in tax administration. The MTA began transitioning to \nan  ICT-based  tax  administrative  system  and  has  been  working  to  establish  a  tax  information \nsystem to automate the registration of taxpayers and tax types, tax accounting and auditing, tax \npayment,  and  the  tax  refund  process.  However,  planning  and  investments  in  ICT  have  been \nineffective, especially with different systems being outdated and operating for different business \nprocesses, resulting in isolated data repositories and systems in tax administration.6 \n \n9. \nPublic  investment  management.  The  major  parts  of  the  life  cycle  of  PIM  are \nadministered  by  the  Budget  Investment  Department  (BID)  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).7 \nWhile  a  certain  level  of  autonomy  in  local  government  with  budget  planning  and  execution  for \nsmall investment projects exists, all fixed investment project proposals at the local government \nlevel  that  are  fully  or  partially  funded  by  the  central  government  must  still  be  submitted  to the \nMOF. 8 As  inputs  are  required  from  ministries  and  agencies  through  their  independently  run \nsystems  to  successfully  complete  the  PIM  process  cycle,  interoperability,  availability  of \ninformation from external systems and interface with the core PIM, and monitoring systems are \nmajor challenges for PIM in Mongolia. \n \n                                                \n4  The largest revenue streams of reported government income are windfall tax (36% of total income) and corporate \n\nincome tax (17%). \n\n5  Local governments also have tax administration units for local taxes such as property tax, although a major portion \n\nof local government revenues still rely on central government fiscal transfers. \n\n6  Existing systems were developed separately for each tax type (e.g., personal income tax, corporate tax, value-added \ntax, property tax, etc.) and processes on various technology platforms resulting in more than 20 ICT systems in use \nwith unintegrated data sources. \n\n7  The life cycle of PIM includes development of investment project planning by receiving investment project proposals \nfrom  ministries,  agencies,  and  local  governments;  proposal  review;  submission  for  approval  to  Parliament  of \nMongolia; and implementation of approved investment projects and project monitoring and evaluation. \n\n8  The  authority  of  local  governments  has been  significantly enhanced,  with  provincial  governments  responsible  for \nbasic education,  primary  health  care, urban  planning  and construction,  social  welfare services,  water  supply  and \nsewerage,  public  transport,  urban  roads  and  bridges,  and  municipal  services.  These  functions  will  be  financed \nthrough local taxes and fiscal transfers from shared taxes.   \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n\fOverall,  the  business  process  of  PIM  in  Mongolia  is  fragmented  and  inefficient,  often \n10. \ncausing suboptimal public investment decisions, underperformance of investment projects, and \nopaque monitoring and evaluation. Most of the PIM functions are carried out manually with data \nmaintained in Microsoft Excel sheets and in printed documents, resulting in ineffective monitoring \nof  the  investments,  physical  and  financial  progress,  and  results  and  benefits  from  such \ninvestments. Knowledge gaps also exist in understanding and designing business processes that \nare based on good practice. Thus, a comprehensive business process system for PIM is required \nfor transparent and efficient management of the entire life cycle of public investment. \n \n11. \nThere is also insufficient ICT capacity for PIM in Mongolia, with technical and functional \nlimitations that prevent optimized utilization of ICT for management of public investments. The \nexisting software, called Fiscal, in use for budget preparation offers very limited functionality for \nPIM.  Its  primary  focus  is  on  capturing  the  budgetary  estimates  for  the  project,  with  limited \nfunctionality for managing the entire life cycle of PIM. The system also needs to interface with the \ncritical ICT systems of the government that include the budget management system, the budget \npreparation  information  system,  the  expenditure  management  system,  and  the  government \nfinancial  management  information  system  to  create  a  seamless  management  ecosystem  and \nenhance  accountability  of  overall  PIM.  This  is  in  line  with  the  Government  Action  Plan,  2016\u2013\n2020 to improve PIM. 9 \n \nExisting capacity and resource constraints in the BID also severely impedes the planning \n12. \nand management of PIM functions in Mongolia, particularly in aspects such as (i) the approach to \nand methodology for evaluating project proposals; (ii) selecting projects that fit with the overall \neconomic development vision and growth plans of the country; (iii) investment planning and policy \ndevelopment; and (iv) implementing, financing, monitoring, and evaluating selected projects.  \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: enhanced accountability and efficiency of \n13. \npublic  financial  resource  mobilization  and  management  (footnote  9).  The  project  will  have  the \nfollowing outcome: strengthened transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness in public investment \nand tax administration.10 \n \n14. \nThe  project  is  part  of  ADB  efforts to improve public  financial  resource mobilization and \nmanagement in Mongolia,11 and is built on recommendations and lessons12 from previous ADB \nTA  and  projects.13 The  project  is  also  unique  and  innovative  in  taking  advantage  of  ICT  for \nimproving  tax  administration  and  PIM,  addressing  inefficiency  and  transparency  in  both \ngovernment revenue and expenditure management at the same time. \n \n                                                \n9  Government of Mongolia. 2016.

The  project  will  reengineer  its  current \nbusiness processes of tax administration and PIM in line with international good \npractices, 14  and  provide  necessary  support  in  redesigning  and  improving \nfunctional coverage of the system, integration requirements, and ICT infrastructure \nneeds.  Automation  of  standardized  and  simplified  business  processes  and \ninteractions  enhances \ninternally  as  well  as  with  external \nstakeholders, facilitating better coordination and collaboration. \nOutput  2:  Improved  and  strengthened  information  and  communication \ntechnology  systems \ninvestment \nmanagement. The project will support the executing agency to define functional \nand system requirements and develop ICT systems for the new TAIS and PIMIS. \nNew software and hardware will be procured.

The project will support the \nMTA  in  consolidating  its  ICT  infrastructure  for  hosting  and  managing  its \nbusiness applications, including the TAIS, in the National Government Data \nCentre in Ulaanbaatar and the proposed disaster recovery site in Darkhan \ncity.  The  project  will  provide  for  the  required  ICT  infrastructure  (network, \nsecurity,  computing,  and  storage  infrastructure)  and  associated  system \nsoftware required for hosting the TAIS in the data center and data recovery \nsite. The project will also provide for non-ICT infrastructure (air-conditioning, \nand transformers) needed for the data center. The project will also support \nmodernizing  the  ICT  infrastructure  in  the  MTA  offices  including  desktop \ncomputers,  printers,  local  area  network,  and  wide  area  network  to \ninterconnect the tax offices to the data center and disaster recovery site.  \nPublic  investment  management  information  system.  The  project  will \nsupport the BID to develop or procure an integrated PIMIS and needed ICT \ninfrastructure including network, security, computing and data storage, and \nassociated system software for hosting the PIMIS. The current data center \nfor the MOF where the PIMIS is to be hosted will be expanded. With the \nimplementation  of  the  integrated  PIMIS  system,  Mongolia  will  have  a \nseamless feed to the development plans from actual budget and projects. \nMoreover, development project selection will be based on enhanced and \ninformed  social  cost\u2013benefit  analysis,  and,  hence,  will  deliver  improved \nsocioeconomic value with adequate fund provisioning, which facilitates the \nreduction  of  risks  to  the  government  in  large  projects  including  public\u2013\nprivate partnership projects. \n \n\n                                                \n14 International  good  practice  generally  follows  principles  and  guidelines  of  ADB,  the  Centre  for  Tax  Policy  and \nAdministration,  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development,  or  other  international  standards \ndefined by the International Monetary Fund (Tax Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool). \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\nOutput  3:  Improved  capacity  of  government  staff  in  administering  and \nmanaging  the  tax  administration  and  information  system  and  the  public \ninvestment management information system. A capacity development plan for \nrequired  skills  and  staff  will  be  prepared,  and  technical  training  workshops  and \nseminars will be arranged and conducted. Public awareness activities will also be \nplanned and conducted. Sensitization and capacity building at different levels of \npolicy and execution strengthen the confidence in public service delivery. Citizens \nwill have enhanced trust in the government because of efficient service delivery \nand transparency. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n17. \nStrategic  fit.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  emphasizes  the  importance  of  governance  and \ninstitutional  capacity  in  supporting  public  management  reforms  and  financial  stability  for \nsustainable and inclusive development.15 The project will support the government to continue its \nreform efforts in public financial resource management by strengthening tax administration and \nPIM.16 The design of the project follows ADB\u2019s sector and thematic operational plan, the Financial \nSector  Operational  Plan. 17 The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for \nMongolia, 2017\u20132020; and the Government Action Plan, 2016\u20132020.18 \n \nD. \n \nThe total investment of the project is $26.47 million (Table 1), for which the government \n18. \nhas requested a regular loan of $25.00 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, or 94.45% \nof the investment requirement, to help finance the project. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure \ncategory and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).19 \n \n19. \nThe loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe loan agreement. Based on the straight-line repayment method, the average maturity is 15.25 \nyears, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.1% per year. \n \n20. \nThe summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures amounting \nto  $25  million  in  relation  to  civil  works  for  the  data  center  building;  the  acquisition  of  ICT \ninfrastructure and hardware, ICT software and technical services, ICT maintenance, equipment, \nbusiness  process  and  advisory  services,  and  project  management;  physical  and  price \ncontingencies;  and  financing  charges  during  construction.

This is likely to provide an opportunity for future alignment and \ncoherence of organization and processes involved in public finance management. \n \n23. \nThe TAIS project will replace a multitude of existing and dated ICT systems in place for \nthe MTA with a modern ICT system. Once  the TAIS is implemented and is integrated with the \nexisting taxpayer service delivery systems (e-tax and value-added tax promotion systems) and \nother ICT systems of the government (e.g., General Department State Registration, Mongolian \nCustoms) it will support the MTA in enhancing its capabilities in taxpayer compliance monitoring, \ntimeliness  in  revenue  collections,  and  in  implementing  the  taxpayer  risk  management  audit \nframeworks to minimize revenue leakages. \n \nB. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \n24. \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects  and  Handbook  for  Integrating  Risk  Analysis  in  the  Economic \nAnalysis of Projects.20 The project is considered economically viable with the base-case results \nshowing an economic internal rate of return of 21.14%. The economic benefits considered for the \nproject include cost savings because of a more efficient tax information system, savings in travel \ncosts  for  taxpayers  and  tax  inspectors,  and  savings  attributable  to  improved  efficiency  in \ninvestment  planning  and  project  implementation.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  also  undertaken  to \nfurther  test  the  economic  viability  of  the  project.  The  results  indicate  that  the  project  is  still \neconomically viable in the following scenarios: (i) 10% increase in capital costs; (ii) 10% increase \nin  annual  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs;  (iii)  10%  decrease  in  benefits;  (iv)  10% \nincrease  in  capital  costs  and  O&M  costs,  plus  10%  reduction  in  benefits;  and  (v)  delay  in  the \nrealization of project benefits by 1 year. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n20 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n\n7 \n \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\n \n25. \nSince the project has no revenue-generating component, financial costs and benefits were \nnot analyzed. Financial sustainability analysis was undertaken to evaluate the potential impact of \nthe project on the budget of the MTA for the TAIS and of the MOF for the PIMIS. The TAIS O&M \ncosts in 2023 are estimated at $1.65 million, and for the PIMIS $1.41 million. Loan repayments \nfor the TAIS range from $1.50 million in 2024 to $1.00 million in 2038, and for the PIMIS from \n$0.99  million  in  2024  to  $0.66  million  in  2038.  Apart  from  the  annual  O&M  costs  and  loan \nrepayments, the MTA and MOF should also allocate budget for other recurrent costs that occur \nevery 5\u201310 years. The O&M costs and the recurrent costs for the replacement of some of the ICT \nhardware and software every 5\u201310 years are justified given the significant cost savings from the \nproject. While the fiscal impact of the project on the MTA and MOF can be considered minimal, \nboth agencies have to allocate the necessary budget each year for the recurrent costs to ensure \ncontinuous operations of the information systems. \n \nC. \n \nThe  financial  management  assessment  considered  the  capacity  of  the  MOF  as  the \n26. \nexecuting agency and the implementing agency for the PIMIS, and the MTA as the implementing \nagency  for  the  TAIS,  including  funds  flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial \nreporting systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The assessment concludes \nthat, while the MOF and MTA have organizations that are appropriate for a project implementing \nagency, training and capacity of their financial and accounting staff will need to be strengthened, \nespecially on ADB policies and procedures, and requirements. The implementing agencies have \naccounting  systems  that  allow  for  the  proper  recording  of  project  financial  transactions.  The \nimplementing agencies have internal audit units, and their financial statements are audited every \nyear  by  the  National  Audit  Office.  Budgeting  systems  and  procedures  are  in  place.  Functional \nresponsibilities for internal control are undertaken by different units or individuals. The functions \nfor ordering, receiving, accounting, and payments are appropriately segregated. \n \n27. \nThe overall financial management risk is moderate, mainly because of the lack of MOF \nand  MTA  financial  and  accounting  staff  who  will  provide  support  to  the  project,  the  MTA\u2019s \nunfamiliarity with ADB procedures and requirements, and potential delays in the submission of \nproject  financial  statements.  Mitigation  measures  include  (i)  hiring  a  financial  management \nspecialist  to  assist  the  MOF,  MTA,  and  project  implementation  unit  in  preparing  consolidated \nproject  financial  statements  and  providing  support  in  daily  financial  management,  including \nassisting  with  the  monitoring  and  reporting  requirements;  (ii)  providing  training  on  ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement guidelines and procedures to the relevant staff of the MOF and MTA; and (iii) hiring \nconsultants  to  provide  assistance  to  the  MOF  and  MTA  in  making  timely  submissions  of  the \naudited project financial statements.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n28. \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 18). \n \nD. \n \n29. \nDue diligence has been conducted on (i) poverty and social analysis to assess the impacts \nof the project, following ADB\u2019s Handbook on Social Analysis;21 and (ii) gender analysis to assess \nthe potential of the project to contribute to gender equality, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Gender \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2006.

The project is categorized as having some gender elements. \n \n30.  Mongolia\u2019s  relatively  strong  regulatory  framework  and  international  commitments  to \ngender  equality  provide  a  solid  foundation  for  mainstreaming  and  integrating  gender  issues \nthrough sector and local development policies and actions. Gender inequality is viewed as a major \ncontributing  factor  and  barrier  to  inclusive  growth  and  social  and  economic  development. \nAchieving gender equality contributes to improved economic growth and poverty reduction. The \nproject will include a specific sex-disaggregated target giving female government officers more \nopportunity to build capacity in ICT areas where women are provided with fewer opportunities not \nonly for job assignment but also for career progress, especially in management positions. While \nthe ratio of female staff in the MTA is 52.5% and in the MOF 53.5%, the female staff ratio of the \ninformation  technology  departments  is  only  25.0%  in  the  MTA  and  zero  in  the  MOF.  Capacity \nbuilding programs and activities will target to encourage more female staff participation.  \n \nE. \n \n31. \ncategories are as follows:23 \n \n32. \nEnvironment  (category  C).  The  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  C.  All \nrequired permits and approvals shall be obtained from government authorities following national \nregulations, if needed. The project will involve small construction works, including refurbishment \nand reconfiguration of local tax offices and upgrade of existing server rooms and data centers \nthrough reconfiguration and renovation in government building premises. The expansion of the \ndata center for the PIMIS will only involve adding a small annex to the existing building and will \nnot require foundations. Potential environmental impacts of these activities are expected to be \nminimal, and good practice will be applied during construction and operation following the PAM \nand  national  and  ADB  requirements.  Disposal  of  used  information  technology  equipment  will \nstrictly  follow  Mongolian  legislation  on  solid-waste  management,  especially  the  Law  on Waste \nManagement  enacted  in  2017.
