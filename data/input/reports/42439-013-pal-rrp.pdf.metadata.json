In  2012,  about  80% of  Palau\u2019s  population of \n20,966 lived in Koror and Airai, and 118,754 tourists visited Palau and visitor arrivals to Palau \nincreased by 3.6% over the first half of fiscal year (FY) 2013. Tourism accounted for roughly half \nof the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) of $231.9 million in FY2012.3 The average tourist \nstay is 4 nights, equivalent to a population increase of 6%.4 Palau\u2019s economy has overcome the \neffects of the global financial and economic crises, posting GDP growth of 6.3% in FY2012, with \ngrowth  forecast  at  3.0%  in  both  FY2013  and  FY2014.  Longer-term  growth  prospects  are \npositive  given  the  country\u2019s  appeal  to  tourists  from  Japan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  Taipei, \nChina.  To  support  tourism  growth,  the  country\u2019s  basic  public  infrastructure  must  be  upgraded \nand maintained. Improved water and sewerage infrastructure and an additional 500 hotel rooms \nare needed to accommodate current and projected visitors.  \n \n3. \nPublic finance and debt. The government is in a strong position to undertake long-term \ninvestments to upgrade infrastructure needed to sustain economic growth. It recorded a current \naccount  surplus  (including  grants)  equivalent  to  5.9%  of  GDP  in  FY2012.  The  International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) projects Palau\u2019s current account surplus to remain at this level through to \nFY2017. Strong growth in tourist arrivals underpins Palau\u2019s economic growth and rising current \naccount surpluses, and is expected to continue. The IMF estimates the country\u2019s external debt \nas  34.5%  of  GDP  in  FY2012,  comprising  11.9%  official  government  debt,  17.9%  public \nenterprise  debt,  and  4.7%  other. 5 With  planned  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other \nloans, the country\u2019s external debt to GDP ratio is expected to rise to 48.9% by the end of 2013 \n(7.7%  official  government  debt  and  41.2%  public  enterprise  debt)  in  nominal  terms.  This  is \nbelow  the  50%  threshold  for  debt  sustainability  applied  by  the  IMF  for  countries  with  strong \npolicy  environments  (based  on  the  ADB  and  World  Bank  country  performance  assessment \nscores) if considered in terms of present value (i.e., discounting future payments). \n \nSector  management. Palau\u2019s phased sanitation master plan, the KASMP, is based on \n4. \nextensive  stakeholder  consultation.  The  government  has  adopted  a  new  water  resource \nmanagement policy to manage national and state water resources and Palau\u2019s Parliament, the \nObiil Era Kelulau (OEK), has approved legislation to regulate the abstraction of water from the \nnation\u2019s fresh water sources.6 Through the creation of the Palau Water and Sewer Corporation \n(PWSC) in September 2011, the Government has integrated water and sewerage services into \na  single  state-owned  enterprise  responsible  for  the  delivery  of  water  supply  and  sewerage \nservices. The Utilities Consolidation Act 2013, aimed at optimizing efficiency in the management \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The KASMP was prepared under Asian Development Bank. 2009.

The  Water  Sector  Improvement \nProgram  (WSIP)  is  supporting  establishment  of  the  PPUC  Water  and  Wastewater  Operations \ndivision.8 Implementation  of  the WSIP  has  been  delayed  in  some  areas,  but  all  policy  actions \nare now complete. The creation of the PPUC Water and Wastewater Operations division and its \ndevelopment  as  a  commercial  enterprise  is  a  first  step  toward  possible  private  sector \nengagement in future. \n \n5. \nSector financial stability. The government is implementing its policy to achieve full cost \nrecovery  for  water  supply  and  sewer  services  by  the  end  of  FY2015.  The  Water  and  Sewer \nCorporation Act 2010 and the Utilities Consolidation Act 2013 specify that tariffs must be set so \nthat  they  recover  all  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  depreciation,  and  indebtedness.  The \ntariff structure became effective in April 2011 and includes volumetric water and sewer tariffs for \ndomestic  and  nondomestic  connections.  Tariff \nimprove  demand  side \nmanagement  to  reduce  an  unsustainably  high  level  of  per  capita  water  consumption.  Lifeline \nblocks  to  protect  the  poor  and  vulnerable  are  set  below  the  cost  of  delivery.  By  2015,  the \nmonthly  water  bill  for  households  in  the  5th  income  quintile  is  estimated  at  4.1%  of  monthly \nincome.  In  2011,  the  government  spent  $3.8  million  for  water  and  sewerage  services.  The \ngovernment  aims  to  achieve  the  following  targets  by  the  end  of  FY2015:  (i)  government \nsubsidies  reduced  from  74%  (2011)  to  zero  (ii)  tariff  collection  efficiency  improves  from  92% \n(2011) to 95%, and (iii) nonrevenue treated water reduced from 43% (2010) to 25%. \n \n6. \nSewer system condition and capability. Koror\u2019s centralized sewerage system services \nmore  than  80%  of  the  population.  The  sewerage  network  comprises  40  kilometers  of  gravity \nmains, 13 kilometers of force (pumped) mains, 48 pump stations, and a sewage treatment plant \n(STP)  located  on the  island of  Malakal.  For  the most  part,  the commercial  sector  of the  city  is \nlocated at the crest of the ridge and the residential hamlets stretch down to the coast. Sewage is \npumped up to the ridge and flows to the STP. Two other islands, connected by causeways, are \npart of the network. The sewer network and STP is over 30 years old. While the STP and some \npump stations  have been refurbished  in  the  last 10  years,  these  have not  been  maintained or \noperated as designed.  \n \n7. \nThe  current  sewerage  flow  exceeds  the  design  capacity  of  the  network  and  the  STP. \nThis  causes  overflows  at  the  low-lying  pump  stations  and  subsequent  discharge  of  effluent  to \nthe natural and built-up environment, including through people\u2019s homes, taro patches, and into \nthe  lagoon.  There  are  an  increasing  number  of  overflows  as  the  network  deteriorates.  The \nproblem  is  exacerbated  by:  (i)  poor  maintenance,  (ii)  inadequate  emergency  response \ncapability, (iii) groundwater infiltration, and (iv) illegal storm-water connections. \n \n8. \nThe state of Airai, adjacent to Koror, does not have a sewerage system. Kesebelau is a \ngrowing new residential division in Airai responding to lack of available land for new housing in \nKoror.  Currently  it  has  300  homes;  this  is  expected  to  double  by  2036.  The  soil  types  and \nallotment  sizes  are  unsuitable  for  septic  tanks,  which  frequently  overflow  discharging  effluent \nthrough properties and into nearby water courses. \n\n \n9. \nAdverse  effects  of  insufficient  sewer  capacity.  The  degraded  condition,  limited \ncapacity of the Koror sewerage network, and rapid development and unsuitable soils for septic \ntanks in Arai are causing environmental and health issues with serious impacts on the economy: \n\n                                                \n7  Republic of Palau Public Law 9-4: The Utilities Consolidation Act 2013. \n8   ADB.  2010.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nEnvironmental  issues.  With  limited  flushing  within  Palau\u2019s  lagoons,  sewage \noverflows  result  in  a  buildup  of  waste,  which  damages  the  fragile  marine  and \nmangrove  ecosystem.  The  government  has  placed  swimming  bans  in  some \nareas near tourist hotels and local swimming spots. \nHealth  issues. The failure  of the  sewer  system  is  placing  the  health  of Palau\u2019s \ncitizens  at  risk.  From  1  April  2011  to  31  March  2012,  Koror  had  862  cases  of \ngastroenteritis.9 Fifty percent of these occurred in the last quarter of  2011 when \nsewerage  overflows  were  the  greatest.  Development  of  a  much  more  serious \nwaterborne disease, such as cholera, is a risk. \nImpact  on  the  economy.  The  potential  economic  costs  of  the  failures  in  the \nsewerage system include (i) direct and indirect health cost; (ii) overflow clean-up \ncosts;  and  (iii)  potential  loss of tourism revenue  associated  with  the  impact  of  a \nserious  disease  outbreak.  The  long-term  reputational  risk  to  Palau\u2019s  tourism \nindustry from a major disease outbreak could be significant. \n\n \n10. \nGovernment  policy  and  strategy. The country\u2019s development plans are encapsulated \nin the  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy  (footnote  4). Two of  the five priority  actions are  to \n(i) position  Palau  as  the  island  of  choice  for  environmentally  conscious  visitors  and  realize \nhigher  income  from  tourism;  and  (ii)  make  critical  investments  in  sanitation,  water,  and  power \nand  prioritize  maintenance.  The  ADB  country  partnership  strategy  2009\u20132013  for  Palau 10 \ndirectly  supports  these  priority  actions,  which  are  also  consistent  with  priorities  set  in  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  202011 and the  Pacific  Approach.12 The  project  is  identified  in the  country  partnership \nstrategy and responds to the ADB sector assessment.13 \n \n11. \nSustainability  of  sector  reforms.  ADB  is  supporting  an  integrated  response  to \nimproving  water  and  sanitation  services  in  Palau.  The  WSIP  has  been  supporting  institution \nbuilding  and  PPUC  water  and  wastewater  operations,  especially  in  the  areas  of  board \noperations,  utility  management,  utility  operation  management,  and  financial  management. 14 \nRegional technical assistance (TA) has been complementing capacity building support through \nthe  Pacific  Private  Sector  Development  Initiative  and  the  Pacific  regional  twinning  program.15 \nThe project will share a common steering committee and implementing agency with the WSIP, \nproviding  mutually  reinforcing  support  for  organizational  and  capacity  development,  technical \nadvice,  infrastructure  improvements,  and  community  participation.  To  ensure  sustainability  of \nsewage  treatment  operations,  a  design,  build,  and  operate  contract  will  be  tendered  with \noperations  to  continue  for  5  years  after  infrastructure  commissioning,  as  well  as  for  training \nexisting staff in operation and maintenance. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  improved  environment  and  public  health  in  Koror  and \n\n12. \nAirai. The outcome of the project will be improved delivery of sanitation services by PPUC. \n \n\n                                                \n9   Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10  ADB. 2009.

The sewerage network in Koror will be rehabilitated and augmented to (i) minimize \nthe frequency and severity of uncontrolled sewage overflows; (ii) reduce the energy requirement \nto  operate  the  network;  (iii)  improve  the  operation  of  the  network  through  real-time  system \nmonitoring;  and  (iv)  enable  rapid  response  to  disruptions  in  sewerage  services  resulting  from \nsystem  failures.  A  sewerage  network  will  be  constructed  at  Kesebelau  (Airai)  connecting  the \nresidential and commercial dwellings to an STP.  \n \n14. \nOutput 2: Sewage treatment and disposal meets Palau\u2019s environmental standards. \nSewage  collected in the Koror and Airai sewerage networks will be treated at new STPs to be \nconstructed  at  Koror  and  Airai.  Effluent  from  the  new  STPs  will  meet  Palau\u2019s  environmental \ndischarge quality standards. The STP in Koror will be consolidated on a much smaller footprint \nfurther  from  the  coast  than  the  existing  STP,  protecting  the  infrastructure  from  future  storm-\nsurge  damage  and  releasing  land  for  tourism  development.  The  new  STPs  will  be  procured \nunder design, build, and operate contracts. \n \n15. \nOutput 3: Safe and hygienic public toilet facilities in Koror are available. Six public \ntoilet  facilities  will  be  refurbished  or  built  in  key  locations  in  the  major  tourist  precincts,  which \nlack  modern  public  toilet  facilities  for  tourists  and  female  residents.  PPUC  will  manage  the \nexisting and new facilities. \n \n16. \nOutput  4:  Effective  project  management.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU), \nsupported  by  project  implementation  assistance  (PIA)  consultants,  will  provide  project  design \nand supervision, monitoring, reporting, quality and cost control, and contract administration.  \n \nD. \n \n17. \ninvestment plan is summarized in Table 1. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $30.0 million and will be implemented over 8 years.

Japan\u2019s  technical \ncooperation program provides a laboratory technician to support sewage monitoring.18  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nTechnical  \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n \nTo  address  the  public  health  and  environmental  concerns  in  Koror  and  Airai,  an \n21. \nintegrated  approach  addressing  both  sewage  collection  and  treatment  is  required.  Three \nalternative  approaches  were  considered  in  developing  the  project.  They  reflect  the  options \nidentified  through  public  consultation  and  were  considered  technically  feasible.  The  project \nadopted  the  least-cost  approach  that  (i)  minimized  operation  management  risks,  (ii)  was  the \nlowest environmental risk, and (iii) offered the greatest flexibility for future growth. \n \n22. \nIn  the  Koror  sewerage  network,  dilapidated  and  undersized  sewers  will  be  replaced \nusing  high-density  polyethylene  pipes,  already  used  in  Palau\u2019s  water  distribution  network. \nRebuilding  and  refurbishing  the  pump stations  will  address  the  poor  condition  of  these  assets \nand rationalize the mechanical infrastructure thereby reducing spares and facilitating equipment \nspecialization.  The  Koror  STP  will  employ  sequencing  batch  reactor  technology,  while  the \nKesebelau  STP  will  use  extended  aeration  technology,  both  considered  appropriate  for  the \ncapabilities of PPUC. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nFinancial  analysis. The financial analysis of the project was undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB  requirements and  considered commitments  under  the WSIP.19 For  the  calculation of \nthe  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  incremental  revenues  and  costs  were  estimated  by \ncomparing the with- and without-project conditions. Costs were estimated at 2012 prices taking \ninto  account  foreign  and  domestic  inflation.  The  real  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  for  the \nproject is 1.63% per annum. The financial internal rate of return is 5.86% and is between 3.47% \nand 5.08% under sensitivity analysis of increasing capital costs, operations and maintenance by \n20% and decreasing revenue by 20% or a project delay by one year.20  \n \n24. \nIn  Palau,  tourists  use  2.5  times  more  water  than  residents.  An  equivalent  population \nmeasure is used to assess the sewage loadings by type of system user. In Koror, the equivalent \npopulation  in  2013  is  estimated  to  be  17,147,  of  which  the  contribution  by  hotels,  restaurants, \nand other commercial activities is estimated at 41%. Table 4 summarizes the expected tariffs to \nachieve  full  cost  recovery  by  2015.21 By  setting  a  much  higher  increase  in  nondomestic  rates, \nthe projected revenue collection from the commercial sector is estimated to be 73% in 2013 and \n80% and above from 2015 onward. For hotels, this additional weighting is expected to result in \nan increase of room night costs of only $1 to $2, considered to be insignificant. \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n18  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB.  2005.

Economic  analysis for  the  project   compared the  with-  and  without-\n25. \nproject scenarios to calculate the benefits and incremental costs over the planning time frame of \n25  years.  The  economic  costs  are  based  on  the  with-project  scenario  and  include  (i)  project \nimplementation costs, (ii) ongoing operating costs, and (iii) residual value of assets at the end of \n25 years. Economic benefits of the project include (i) improved asset management, (ii) avoided \nhealth costs and production losses from waterborne disease, (iii) avoided costs from sewerage \noverflows, and (iv) avoided loss of national income from a disease outbreak resulting in a sharp \nand sustained downturn in tourist arrivals in Palau. \n \n26. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at  18.4%  with  a  net  present  value  of \n$14.3 million. The sensitivity analysis examined the impacts of (i) a 20% increase in costs; (ii) a \n20%  decrease  in  benefits;  and  (iii)  a  20%  increase  in  costs  and  a  20%  decrease  in  benefits. \nUnder these scenarios, the economic internal rate of return remains above 12%.22 \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n\n27. \nFinancial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  includes  a  review  of \nthe  accounting  and  reporting  system,  internal  and  external  auditing,  fund  disbursement,  and \ninformation systems.23 The financial control risk is rated moderate and mitigating measures are \nincorporated  in  the  project.  MOF\u2019s  financial  management  systems  are  considered  adequate. \nThe financial officer on the PMU is an MOF officer. The PIA consultants will support MOF and \nPPUC in preparing financial documentation relating to the project for direct payment by ADB. \n \nProcurement  capacity. The procurement capacity of the government was assessed in \n28. \n2010  when  preparing  the  WSIP.24 The  assessment  indicates  the  government  has  sufficient \ninfrastructure  procurement  experience,  including  for  the  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \nevaluation of technical proposals, and monitoring of contract performance. However, PPUC has \nno  experience  with  multilateral  development  bank  procurement  procedures.  Targeted \nprocurement  training  for  PPUC  will  be  conducted  soon  after  project  approval.  The  PIA \nconsultants will support the PMU\u2019s procurement activities. \n \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n29. \nto,  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \n\n                                                \n22 Details of the sensitivity analysis are in the Economic Analysis and Supplementary Economic Analysis (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n23  Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Procurement Assessment. (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social25 \n\n30. \nThe  causes  of  hardship  for  the  population  include  (i)  low  income;  (ii)  limited  access  to \nbasic  social  services,  such  as  sanitation  facilities;  and  (iii)  limited  opportunities  for  paid \nemployment. An estimated 25% of the population  and 20% of households are living under the \nbasic  needs  poverty  line.26 The  government  and  PPUC  will  continue  to  maintain  water  and \nsewerage lifeline rates for the poor and vulnerable, well below the cost of providing the service \nwith the effective subsidies being funded by users charged above the lifeline tariff block. \n \nThe  project  is  classified  under  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  27  Project  design \n31. \nelements that ensure women\u2019s participation and access to project benefits include requirements \nfor  (i)  gender  equality  of  participation  in  the  project  design  and  implementation;  (ii)  equality  in \nemployment opportunities in PPUC; (iii) public infrastructure, particularly targeted to the needs \nof women and children; and (iv) public health and awareness programs on water and sanitation \nissues. \n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n32. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  classified  under  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).  The  project  provides  positive  environmental  benefits  through  improving  the \nenvironmentally safe collection and treatment of sewage in Koror and Airai. Sewage overflows \nwithin the  collection  network  will  be  reduced  significantly. The quality  of sewage treatment  will \nmeet  appropriate  standards  for  the  sensitive  marine  environment.  Sludge  disposal  will  go  to \nlandfill  complying  with  international  standards.  No  significant  environmental  impacts  will  result \nfrom  project  implementation.  The  environmental  management  plan  outlines  the  risks  and \nmitigating  actions  to  be  undertaken  during  project  implementation. 28  The  major  risk  during \nimplementation  is  maintaining  the  quality  of  treated  sewage  effluent  discharged  as  the  STP  is \nbuilt. Measures to mitigate these risks will be included in the design specifications.  \n \n33. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  under \ncategory  C  for  both  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  It  has  no  resettlement \nissues.  All  civil  works  will  be  constructed  on  public  land,  within  public  easements,  or  on  long-\nterm leased land without settlers. The people of Palau consider themselves indigenous in terms \nof  ethnic  origin.  The  project  is  not  expected  to  have  a  negative  impact  on  any  distinct  or \nvulnerable  group  of  indigenous  peoples  as  defined  under  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement. \nAll  project  safeguard  documents  will  be  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  The  project  will  support \ncapacity development within MOF and PPUC to manage safeguards. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\n34.
