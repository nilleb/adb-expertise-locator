This  is  an  eligible  transaction  under  the  Faster  Approach  to  Small  Nonsovereign \nTransactions (FAST) framework.1 The transaction involves a  loan of up to $20,000,000 to \nEastern Bank for Sustainable Projects in the Textile and Garment Sector in Bangladesh. 2 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Textile and Garment Sector. Bangladesh is the world\u2019s second largest exporter of \ntextiles and garments, and this industry accounted for 82% of the country\u2019s total merchandise \nexports in FY2015,3 generating export earnings of $24 billion. It accounted for about 15% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) in FY2014.4 The textile and garment sector employs 4 million \nworkers, of whom almost 85% are women.5 In 2013, after a 2012 factory fire and a 2013 \nbuilding collapse in Bangladesh had killed more than 1,000 ready-made garment (RMG) factory \nworkers and injured thousands more, the Bangladesh government, the European Union, the \nUnited States, and the International Labor Organization (ILO) engaged in a joint initiative called \nBangladesh Sustainable Compact to promote continuous improvements in labour rights and \nfactory safety. A 2015 study by the European Commission found that Bangladesh had made \nmuch progress since the start of the joint initiative in protecting labor rights and improving \nbuilding and workplace safety.6 \n \n3.  Bangladesh and international businesses involved in the textile and garment trade have \nundertaken innovative initiatives and made a positive difference in the area of building and \nworker safety. This has been achieved under the 2013 Accord on Fire and Building Safety in \nBangladesh and the 2013 Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. The accord is a legally \nbinding agreement covering 2013-2018 and signed by more than 200 apparel corporations from \n20 countries, two global trade unions, and many Bangladesh trade unions. The alliance covers \nthe same period and was founded by a group of North American apparel companies. The \naccord and the alliance have engaged qualified consultants to inspect RMG factories for fire, \nelectrical, and structural safety. As of March 2016, 2,197 factories had been inspected, or \n95.4% of the factories covered under the two agreements as suppliers to accord and/or alliance \ncompany signatories.7 A factory\u2019s first inspection produces a corrective action plan (CAP) for \nremedial safety changes that are to be taken within prescribed time limits. The staff of the \naccord and alliance themselves conduct the follow-up inspections to ensure that the CAPs are \nimplemented according to schedule. The accord and the alliance provide capacity building \nthrough health and fire and general safety training for workers, the formation of occupational \nsafety and health committees of worker representatives and management at factories covered \nby their agreements, and the establishment of mechanisms to monitor the health and safety on \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015. Faster Approach to Small Nonsovereign Transactions. Manila \n2  Sustainable projects refer to the construction or expansion of textile and garment factories that after completion will \nmeet the high structural, fire, and electrical safety standards required by the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in \nBangladesh or the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety. All subborrowers will be required to consider energy \nefficiency and be encouraged to select energy efficient design and equipment for the subprojects. \n \n3  ADB. 2016.

The alliance alone has supported basic fire safety training for more than 1.1 \nmillion workers. The two organizations have set up help lines to enable factory workers to report \nsafety and health concerns confidentially. This bottom\u2013up, participatory approach is expected to \nbecome a key element of the RMG factory safety program in the future.  \n \n4.  The ILO\u2019s international training center and the Bangladesh department of inspection of \nfactories and establishments have trained all the government\u2019s labor inspectors on how to \ninspect working conditions, occupational safety and health matters, hazard identification, risk \nassessment, and the investigation of work accidents. The ILO is responsible for managing the \nsafety inspection of export-oriented factories that are not covered by the accord and the alliance \nas suppliers. As of 16 March 2016, 1,549 of these factories, which fall under a government \nnational action plan, had been inspected. Most of the inspections have been done by the private \nsector inspection companies previously engaged for the accord and the alliance programs. The \nILO plans to oversee the inspection and safety remediation of export-oriented RMG factories \nuntil 2021 when the government is expected to be ready to take over after years of capacity \nbuilding.8  \n \n5.  The attention to safety matters given under the accord and alliance program has set the \nstandard for RMG sector worker safety in Bangladesh. Domestic entrepreneurs are starting to \nsee that making their facilities compliant with the accord and alliance standards provides a \ncompetitive advantage that is worth the investment. RMG manufacturing facilities determined to \nbe compliant are gaining market share as export demand shifts toward such factories. This has \ncreated greater demand for the long-term financing for the construction and expansion of RMG \nfactories that will comply with accord and alliance standards after completion. The domestic \nbanks in Bangladesh\u2019s undeveloped finance sector struggle to provide this long-term finance at \ncompetitive interest rates.  \n \n6.  Finance sector. Total credit represented only 59.7% of GDP in FY2015, and credit to \nthe private sector accounted for 43.9%.9 Banks dominate the finance sector and accounted for \n89.8% of the private sector credit. Asset quality in the banking sector is weak. The sector\u2019s year-\nend nonperforming loans ratio was 9.7% in 2014 and 8.8% in 2015. Domestic banks have no \naccess  to  international  capital  markets.  Long-term  US  dollar  funding  is  available  to  them \nprimarily through international financial institutions.10 \n  \n7.  To support continued improvements in the important textile and garment sector and help \nfill financing gaps in the Bangladesh finance market, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nsought to  partner  with  domestic financial  institutions  that  have  demonstrated  the  ability  to \nfinance RMG sector development. In this regard, ADB approved a $30 million loan facility for \nBRAC Bank in 2015.11 ADB consulted Eastern Bank about participating in a possible follow-up \nproject. Eastern Bank was one of the first banks in Bangladesh to join ADB\u2019s Trade Finance \nProgram and has been an active member since 2006. The bank is committed to support the \ndevelopment of socially and environmentally sustainable projects. It has a good track record of \n                                                \n8  The ILO may assume responsibility for inspecting factories supplying to accord and alliance members at the end of \nthe two organizations\u2019 operations commitment period of 2013\u20132018, although both organizations have left open the \npossibility of extensions. \n9  Bangladesh Bank. 2016.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors. Proposed Loan to BRAC Bank \nfor Sustainable Projects in Bangladesh. Manila. The loan agreement was signed in April 2016, and $15 million had \nbeen disbursed by the end of August 2016. \n ", "3 \nfinancing such projects in the textile and garment sector, good corporate governance standards, \na solid past financial performance, and sound safeguards capacity. Eastern Bank was given a \n$10  million  credit  facility  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  to  finance  the \nimplementation of CAPs prescribed after accord and alliance inspections at RMG factories in \nthe country.12 [The rest of this paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive \ninformation.] \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  Eastern Bank is a leading private commercial bank. It was established in 1992 and is \nlisted on the Dhaka and Chittagong stock exchanges. It is one of the most innovative banks in \nthe country and the first to provide online banking services, green loans, US dollar financing \nthrough letters of credit, and aviation finance. In 2015, it was named the\u201d best retail bank\u201d in \nBangladesh by The Asian Banker, a provider of strategic intelligence finance in the Asian region. \n[This  sentence  has  been  redacted  due  to  commercially  sensitive  information.]  As  of  31 \nDecember 2015, Eastern Bank had one of the largest private commercial bank branch networks \nin the country\u2014224 outlets overall, consisting of 80 full service branches, 57 small and medium-\nsized enterprise (SME) centers, 72 bill paying centers, and 15 priority banking centers. The \noutlets are spread throughout Bangladesh but are concentrated in the major cities of Dhaka and \nChittagong. \n \n9.  Eastern Bank is primarily a corporate bank. Corporate loans represented 72.1% of the \ngross loan portfolio at the end of 2015 and 72.7% a year earlier. Eastern Bank considers \ncorporate banking to be an important strength and competitive advantage. The bank\u2019s active \ntrade finance and foreign currency lending operations help attract corporate clients. Foreign \ncurrency loans provided by its overseas banking unit accounted for about 18.4% of its corporate \nlending at the end of 2015. The bank\u2019s SME portfolio accounted for 14.5% of year-end total \nlending in 2015, slightly down from 15.2% the year before. Comprising 12.4% of overall lending \nwhen 2015 ended, its retail banking business is small but competitive and offers a wide variety \nof deposit, loan, and card products. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n10.  Ownership.  The  shareholders  with  board  representation  hold  a  combined  stake of \n31.6%. The largest stake of 10% is held by Namreen Enterprises, a shipping company, followed \nby Mir Holdings (5.0%) and Borak Real Estate (4.8%). Other main shareholders with board \nrepresentation include the board chairperson, M. Ghaziul Haque, who has a combined stake of \n5.2% with his MGH Group, a conglomerate with interests in shipping, retail, and media. [This \nsentence has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.] ADB has conducted \nintegrity due diligence in accordance with its guidelines.13 It identified no significant or potentially \nsignificant  integrity  risks.  [This sentence  has  been  redacted  due to  commercially  sensitive \ninformation.] The majority of the bank\u2019s shares (57.6%) are held by the general public. No \nindividual holds more than 5% of shares. ADB\u2019s project team did not therefore establish details \nregarding these beneficial owners. Eastern Bank was established in Bangladesh, which is not a \njurisdiction with strategic deficiencies identified by the financial action task force. \n \n                                                \n12 The loan was under IFC\u2019s remediation finance program and will be exclusively used to finance the implementation \nof CAPs by the accord or the alliance. ADB\u2019s loan will complement the IFC\u2019s facility by financing construction \nand/or expansion of RMG factories that will comply with accord and/or alliance standards after completion. \n13 ADB. 2015.

Some have previously held senior positions in international banks. The 15-member \nmanagement committee includes the chief executive officer (CEO), one additional managing \ndirector, and two deputy managing directors. The CEO, Ali Reza Iftekhar, has more than 30 \nyears of banking experience, including 12 at Eastern Bank. He was previously deputy managing \ndirector at AB Bank and head of credit at Standard Chartered Bank in Bangladesh.

The board\u2019s risk management committee reviews and monitors overall risk management. \nThe risk management committee at the management level  comprises 12 members and is \nchaired by the chief risk officer (CRO).  [The rest of this paragraph has been redacted due to \ncommercially sensitive information.]  \n \n13.  Governance  structure.  Eastern  Bank  has  some  of  the  banking  sector\u2019s  strongest \ncorporate governance standards. It won a national award for corporate governance excellence \nfrom the Institute of Chartered Secretaries of Bangladesh in 2014 and 2015. Its board is strong, \nand  the  membership  provides  broad  experience  in  business,  banking,  financial  services, \naccounting, and management. Of Eastern Bank\u2019s 11 board members, 1 is an executive director, \n2 are independent non-executive directors, and 8 are non-executive directors nominated by a \ndiverse set of shareholders. The board has an audit committee, a risk management committee, \nand an executive committee; and it monitors and approves the bank\u2019s major financial and \nbusiness  strategies  and  policies.  It  oversees  the  mechanisms  of  financial  control,  internal \ncontrol, and risk management. It ensures that the processes needed to comply with applicable \nlaws are in place. \n \nD.

ADB will provide a 5-year senior unsecured term loan to Eastern Bank of up to $20 \nmillion. The proceeds will be used to finance socially and environmentally sustainable projects \nin  the  textile  and  garment  sector.  More  specifically,  the  proposed  loan  will  finance  the \nconstruction or expansion of textile and garment factories that will meet the high structural, fire, \nand electrical safety standards required by the accord or the alliance after completion. All \nEastern Bank borrowers that benefit from ADB funding will be required to consider improving \n ", "5 \nenergy efficiency in their factories and be encouraged to select energy-efficient designs and \nequipment for the subprojects.14 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  Monitoring of the project will be carried out by ADB. Eastern Bank will provide ADB with \nfinancial and other reports at predetermined regular intervals and as requested. These reports \nwill  include  (i)  unaudited  financial  statements  on  a  quarterly  basis;  (ii)  audited  financial \nstatements  on  an  annual  basis;  (iii)  compliance  certificates  for  financial  covenants;  (iv) \nsemiannual  reporting  on  the  list  of  subprojects  financed  by  ADB,  including  details  on \nimplementation progress; (v) annual reporting on the implementation of the environmental and \nsocial management system (ESMS) and on compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009)  and  the  bank\u2019s  gender  action  plan  (GAP);  and  (vi)  annual  reporting  on  selected \ndevelopment indicators agreed on by ADB and the borrower. \n \n20.  ADB will conduct field visits to Eastern Bank and selected ADB-financed subprojects at \nleast annually after the disbursement of the loan. Eastern Bank\u2019s existing ESMS will be updated \nto improve the screening and monitoring of subprojects.15 The loan agreement between ADB \nand Eastern Bank will include covenants on safeguards and social protection. [The rest of this \nparagraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.] \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n21.  Greater access to long-tenor finance for ready-made garment factory expansion \nand construction. The RMG sector is a critical part of the Bangladesh economy but lacks \naccess to the long-term funding necessary for its development. Local banks cannot obtain long-\nterm US dollar finance from commercial sources. International banks provide them only with \nshort-term trade finance of up to 1 year. The local banks cannot tap the international capital \nmarkets because of Bangladesh\u2019s low country rating. Thus, the long-term funding provided by \nADB will enable Eastern Bank to offer long-term US dollar financing to the subproject clients \nand improve the bank\u2019s asset\u2013liability profile.  \n \n22.  Strengthening of Eastern Bank\u2019s environmental and social management system. \nThe project will help enhance Eastern Bank\u2019s ESMS. Eastern Bank will be required to comply \nwith environmental and social safeguard measures of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. In \naddition  to  complying  with  the  safeguard  requirements  introduced  by  the  IFC  remediation \nfinance program (footnote 12), ADB has proposed further enhancements to Eastern Bank\u2019s \nproject screening and monitoring process, including the expansion of the bank\u2019s due diligence \nchecklist to include environment and social safeguards and other labor aspects.  \n \n23.  Gender equity support for women. The ADB loan will incorporate gender elements in \nEastern Bank\u2019s financing in the RMG industry. The project is classified as effective gender \nmainstreaming.  ADB helped Eastern Bank to develop a GAP16 to ensure the improvements of \nfacilities and working conditions for women working in the RMG factories financed by ADB. The \n                                                \n14 Because few factory owners are willing to incur the costs of energy efficiency certification, it is not possible to \nrequire them to measure energy efficiency level of the subprojects. However, Eastern Bank will include energy \nefficiency as a subloan assessment criterion. It will obtain confirmation from all subborrowers that energy efficient \ndesign and equipment are selected, subject to project cost estimates and other constraints. \n15 Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nGAP\u2019s substantive gender design features will include the provision of a health center and \nsafety training for women working in subproject factories. \n \nD.  Risks \n \n24.  Key risks to the project include the following: [The rest of this paragraph has been \nredacted due to commercially sensitive information.] \n \n25.  [This paragraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.]  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n \n26.  Impacts. The impacts will be the following: \n(i)  Health  and  safety  standards  of  the  garment  industry  in  Bangladesh \nenhanced. The textile and garment industry in Bangladesh has a poor safety \nrecord. The loan will support the joint efforts of the government and other national \ngovernments, international apparel companies and retailers, trade unions, United \nNations\u2019 agencies, multilateral and bilateral development agencies, and domestic \nindustries  to  improve  the  health  and  safety  of  workers  in  the  country\u2019s  RMG \nindustry. Since nearly 85% of the RMG workers are women, the project will have a \ndirect  impact  on  improving  the  working  conditions  for  women  workers  in \nBangladesh. \n(ii)  Finance sector further developed. The project will give Eastern Bank access to \nlong-term  US  dollar  funds,  which  will  in  turn  increase  its  ability  to  provide \ncompetitively priced long-term foreign currency loans to clients in this key sector of \nthe economy. \n(iii)  Energy  efficiency  in  the  textile  and  garment  sector  improved.  While  not \ndirectly measured, the project will help improve the energy efficiency of textile and \ngarment  factories  in  Bangladesh.  This  will  contribute  to  the  reduction  of \ngreenhouse gas emissions and mitigation of climate change. \n \n27.  Outcome. The outcome will be sustainable growth of Eastern Bank\u2019s lending operations \nfor socially and environmentally sustainable projects. \n \n28.  Output.  The  output  will  be  the  expansion  of Eastern  Bank\u2019s  lending  to textile  and \ngarment factories that meet high safety standards and are energy efficient. [The rest of this \nparagraph has been redacted due to commercially sensitive information.]  \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n29.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The midterm review of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2020 calls on ADB to strengthen its support for the finance sector by  helping to \ndevelop financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services.17 The project addresses \nthree priorities identified by the midterm review: (i) support for poverty reduction and inclusive \neconomic  growth,  (ii)  environment  and  climate  change,  and  (iii)  support  for  private  sector \ndevelopment and ADB\u2019s private sector operations. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s country \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n ", "7 \npartnership strategy (CPS) for Bangladesh for 2011\u20132015.18 The CPS prioritized support for \ndeveloping the private sector and the finance sector to accelerate growth, with an emphasis on \nclean energy, infrastructure finance, and expanding credit for SMEs. It called for environmental \nconsiderations to be integrated into sector interventions. \n \n30.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \naligned with ADB\u2019s financial sector operational plan, which calls for finance sector projects to \nserve the needs for developing the real economy and fit the overall development agenda \noutlined in ADB\u2019s CPS.19 The project continues ADB\u2019s past support for the textile and garment \nsectors in Bangladesh (footnote 10).  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n31.  Based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the loan is classified as category FI for \npotential impacts on the environment and involuntary resettlement and category FI (treated as \nC) for indigenous peoples. ADB\u2019s loan proceeds will not finance subloans that are assessed as \ncategory A for environment or involuntary resettlement or categories A or B for indigenous \npeoples. The potential environment and social impacts of the investment, the risks associated \nwith the borrower's existing and/or likely future portfolio, and its commitment and capacity for \nenvironmental and social management have been assessed. Eastern Bank will apply ADB's \nprohibited  investment  activities  list,  ensure  that  investments  using  ADB\u2019s  funds  abide  by \napplicable national laws and regulations and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, \nand enhance its existing ESMS to ADB\u2019s satisfaction before the first disbursement of the loan. \n \n32.  Eastern Bank will enhance its ESMS by improving its ESMS screening process. The \nscreening  process  will  include  ADB\u2019s  prohibited  investment  activities  list  and  cover  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguards requirement. It will cover fire safety, including verification \nof accord and/or alliance CAP implementation status, and will disqualify high-risk factories for \nADB-financed  subloans.  Screening  will  include  the  review  of  the  social  and  labor  audits \nconducted  by  the  factory\u2019s  buyers  and  the  factory\u2019s  compliance  with  local  environmental \nregulations.  Subprojects  found  to  have  high-risk  environmental  and  safety  issues  will  be \nexcluded  from the  ADB  project.  Eastern  Bank  will  enhance  its  staff capacity  by  providing \nrelevant training on the ESMS.20 ADB will monitor the bank\u2019s ESMS implementation. \n \n33.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming under ADB\u2019s guidelines. \nEastern Bank\u2019s GAP outlines how the bank will cooperate with its garment factory subborrowers \nto improve working conditions for women workers, integrate gender-sensitive design in garment \nfactories, conduct fire and building safety training for women, and require subborrowers to \nestablish and operate health center sections in factory clinics to provide appropriate medical \nservices for women.21 Eastern Bank will monitor labor issues and GAP implementation and \nreport on them in its annual environmental and social monitoring report to ADB.
