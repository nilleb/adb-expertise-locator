Adverse impact of \nexogenous shocks  \n\nADB Staff Assessment \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe sudden disruptions to the economy. It is \nprojected  to  lead  to  economic  loss  of  $2.3  billion  or  7.1%  of  GDP  in  FY2020  and \nFY2021. ADB projected 6.3% GDP growth for FY2020 before the pandemic; however, \nthe official GDP growth is estimated to decline to 2.3%.  With rising health and economic \nrelief measures, the FY2020 fiscal deficit is projected to widen from the pre-pandemic \nestimate of 6.4% of GDP to 8.5% of GDP. ADB estimates that the economy may lose \nabout 4.7% of total employment or 997,000 jobs for FY2020\u2013FY2021.a The IMF\u2019s May \n2020  report on  the  Rapid  Credit  Facility projects  Nepal\u2019s  GDP  growth  to  be  1.0%  in \nFY2020 and 3.5% in FY2021.b \nOn 29 March 2020, the government approved the National Relief Program, consisting \nof (i) health and medical support, (ii) social protection for the poor and vulnerable, and \n(iii)  economic  support \nfor  affected  sectors.  The  government\u2019s  countercyclical \ndevelopment expenditure program is estimated to cost about $1.26 billion for FY2020, \nof  which:  (i)  $347  million  for  health  and  medical  support,  (ii) $359 million  for  social \nprotection for the poor and vulnerable, and (iii) $555 million for economic support for \naffected sectors. \nNepal\u2019s macroeconomic management has been generally sound with fast growth and \nbenign inflation. GDP growth averaged 7.3% during FY2017\u2013FY2019. Inflation declined \nsteadily from a peak of 9.9% in FY2016 to 6.5% in the first 8 months of FY2020. The \nfiscal deficit moderated to 5.1% of GDP in FY2019, down from 6.6% in FY2018. Gross \nforeign exchange reserves were adequate at $9.5 billion at the end of FY2019, enough \nto  cover  7.8  months  of  imports,  in  FY2019.  With  an  average  revenue\u2013GDP  ratio  of \n23.8% from FY2017 to FY2019, the revenue mobilization, excluding foreign grants, has \nbeen robust.  \nAs  part  of  the  pandemic  response,  the  government  has  begun  structural  reforms  to \nenhance public sector resilience to emergencies, especially in the health sector. MOHP \ndeveloped  the  Health  Sector  Emergency  Response  Plan:  COVID-19  Pandemic  to \ndevelop  detailed  institutional  mechanisms  and  interventions  to  be  adopted  during  a \npandemic.c  The  government  also  incorporated  finance  sector  structural  reforms  to \nenable  the  regulatory  authorities  and  financial  institutions  to  maintain  the  sector\u2019s \nliquidity and stability during emergencies.   \nNepal\u2019s public debt remains lower than other low-income countries and a net external \ncreditor. ADB\u2019s debt sustainability assessment finds that from 30.1% of GDP in FY2019, \nthe  pandemic  increases  the  debt-to-GDP  ratio  to  39.0%  in  FY2020  and  43.4%  in \nFY2021 as  growth  dips  and the  primary  balance  worsens  to  fight  the pandemic  and \nsupport recovery. As growth picks up, public debt will continue to rise at a slower pace \nand reach 48.5% in FY2025. Approved and proposed COVID-19 response assistances \n\n2.

The  first  case  of  COVID-19 \nwas  identified  in  Nepal  on  24  January  2020.  Since  then,  the  government  initiated  various \ncontainment  measures  including  procuring  essential  supplies,  equipment,  and  medicine; \nupgrading  health  infrastructure;  training  medical  personnel;  and  spreading  public  awareness. \nOther measures included prohibiting promotional activities or events, canceling on-arrival visas, \nsuspending  the  issuance  of  migrant  workers\u2019  work  permits,  suspending  school  classes  and \nexaminations,  canceling  all  international  flights,  and  postponing  the  National  Assembly.  On \n24 March 2020, a nationwide lockdown came into effect. \n \nOn  8  May  2020,  Nepal  had  107 confirmed  cases,  with  no  deaths  recorded.  It  has \n4. \nconducted about 15,492 swab tests and quarantined about 20,217 people. Although the number \nof  confirmed  cases  is  still  small,  Nepal  is  considered  a  high-risk  country  for  rapid  spread  of \nCOVID-19 infections because of its vulnerable public health system, underdeveloped sanitation \nand  other  infrastructure,  and  densely  populated  urban  and  semi-urban  areas.  Further,  a \nsubstantial number of Nepali migrant workers are returning from affected countries. As of 8 May \n2020,  20,217  migrant  workers  returned  to  Nepal.  Without  urgent  and  effective  containment \nmeasures, Nepal\u2019s risk of rapidly spreading the infection is high. As a landlocked country that is \nhighly dependent on imports, Nepal also recognizes regional cooperation to be crucial in ensuring \na coordinated response to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, and maintain open access and \nuninterrupted supply links. It has signed the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation \n(SAARC) COVID-19 response joint plan, which calls for countries in the region to work together \nto implement containment and surveillance measures. In addition, Nepal pledged $1 million to the \nSAARC COVID-19 Emergency Fund.  \n \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nGovernment\u2019s public health forecasts and health system status. In April 2020, under \n5. \nthe  framework  of  the  National  Relief  Program,  the  government  released  the  Health  Sector \nEmergency Response Plan: COVID-19 Pandemic.3 The plan was further revised in May 2020. \nThe plan\u2019s objective is to prepare and strengthen the response of the health system to minimize \nthe pandemic\u2019s health impact. It presents four scenarios based on COVID-19 positive case load \nincluding: (i) a maximum number of positive cases under 2,000; (ii) a maximum number of positive \ncases between 2,000 and 5,000; (iii) a maximum number of positive cases between 5,000 and \n10,000; and (iv) a maximum number of positive cases greater than 10,000.4 Each of these levels \nfurther segregates cases into three levels of severity assuming that 80% of cases would need \ngeneral treatment at the hospital with isolation ward and beds, 15% would need hospitalization \nwith  oxygen  support  and  only  5%  would  need  intensive  care  unit  (ICU)  services.  The  plan \nprescribes strategic approaches and key interventions for (i) health systems, (ii) public health and \nsocial measures, (iii) curative care interventions, and (iv) strengthened management for COVID-\n19  response. 5  To  meet  the  plan\u2019s  requirements,  Nepal\u2019s  health  system  requires  significant \nupscaling  and  expansion,  especially  for  the  number  of  quarantine,  isolation,  hospital  and  ICU \nbeds (Table 2).6 Additionally, Nepal has a lower polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing rate at \n0.56  per  thousand  population  when  compared  to  other  neighboring  countries  such  as  India  at \n1.10, Bhutan at 3.21, and Bangladesh at 0.71.7 Summary of cross country comparison of COVID-\n19 related data is also included in Appendix 2.8  \n \n\nTable 2: Nepal\u2019s Health System Response Capacity for COVID-19 \n\nItem \n\nQuarantine \nBeds \n\nIsolation \nBeds  \n\nPhysicians \n\nICU Beds \n(severe \ncases) \n\nHospital \nBeds with \nOxygen \nSupport  \n26,930 \n\n49,334 \n\nTotal available (as of \n30 April 2020) \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, ICU = intensive care unit. \nSource:  Government  of  Nepal,  Ministry  of  Health  and  Population.  2020.

Before the pandemic, Nepal\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth averaged 7.3% during FY2017\u2013FY2019. Growth increased from 6.7% in \nFY2018  to  7.1%  in  FY2019  mainly  because  of  accelerated  post-earthquake  reconstruction, \nsteady remittance inflows, higher agriculture production, and improved electricity supply. Inflation \ndeclined steadily from a peak of 9.9% in FY2016 to 6.5% in the first 8 months of FY2020. The \nfiscal deficit moderated to 5.1% of GDP in FY2019, after increasing to 6.6% in FY2018, based on \nlower-than-planned capital expenditures.

Nepal\u2019s overall health system capacity is weak to control the pandemic under the outlined scenarios. \nThe  country  has  a  shortage  of  medical  staff,  facilities,  and equipment.  It  has  6.5  doctors  per  10,000  people,  2.7 \nnurses and midwives per 1,000 population, and 0.3 beds per 1,000 people. Nepal\u2019s health care system also lacks \nkey equipment necessary for the pandemic response, such as personal protective equipment for health professionals \nand frontline health workers, and enough ventilators to effectively respond.  \n\n7   Country comparison for testing rate for number of Covid-19 tests per thousand population.

Gross  foreign  exchange  reserves  were  $9.5  billion  in \nFY2019, enough to cover 7.8 months of imports, in FY2019. With an average revenue\u2013GDP ratio \nof 23.8% from FY2017 to FY2019, the revenue mobilization, excluding foreign grants, has been \nrobust.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Article  IV  consultation,  which  concluded  in \nFebruary 2020, confirmed that Nepal had seen strong growth and significant poverty reduction, \nand projected it to grow at 6.0% in FY2020.9 \n  \nEconomic  impact  of  the  pandemic.  The  pandemic  has  caused  serious  economic \n7. \ntransport,  construction,  and \ndisruption,  affecting  segments  such  as  services, \nmanufacturing.  International  travel  bans  and  global  lockdowns  severely  impacted  on  tourism \nrevenue  and  remittance  inflows  of  Nepal.  Contributing  about  a  quarter  of  GDP  and  the  most \nimportant foreign exchange source, a significant fall in remittance income would lead to falling \ndomestic  consumption,  imports  of  goods  and  services,  and  government  revenues.  The \npreliminary estimates from the Central Bureau of Statistics in Nepal show that GDP growth will \nsignificantly  decline  to  2.3%  in  FY2020  (Figure  1:  Gross  Domestic  Product  Growth  Rate \nFY2020).10 ADB\u2019s  GDP  growth  projection  for  FY2020  was  6.3%  before  the  pandemic.  If  the \npandemic and containment measures are assumed to last from mid-March to mid-October 2020 \nfor 7 months, the economy could lose remittance inflows of about 3.6% of GDP. Based on ADB\u2019s \nGDP growth projection, GDP growth would continue to decline to 3.3% from the projected GDP \ngrowth of 6.4% in FY2021. With rising health and economic relief measures due to the COVID-\n19 pandemic, the fiscal deficit will widen from the pre-COVID-19 estimate of 6.4% of GDP to 8.5% \nin FY2020 (Table 3).  \n  \n\ntourism, \n\nTable 3: Provisional Fiscal Position with COVID-19 Impact \n\n  \n\nFY2020 \n\nIndicator \n\n  \n\nA.

Nepal\u2019s finance sector loans outstanding totaled NRs3,213 billion \n8. \nin March 2020, with exposure to hotels, restaurants, and other service industries totaling 8.61% \nof the portfolio. Loans to micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) totaled 10.85%.11 \nThe portfolio performance of loans to the service industries and MSMEs is expected to deteriorate \ndue to the business disruptions caused by the pandemic. The banking nonperforming loan (NPL) \nratio worsened from an NPL ratio of 1.74% in December 2019 to 1.77% in March 2020. Similarly, \nthe finance sector\u2019s capital adequacy ratio deteriorated from 14.19% in December 2019 to 13.97% \nin March 2020.12 The pandemic has also adversely affected the liquidity of the finance system, \nwhich  will  lead  to  limited  access  to  finance  for  the  private  sector,  in  particular  MSMEs. \nRemittances, which grew by 3.61% in FY2019, declined by 50.7% in April 2020 compared with \nApril 2019\u2014falling for the first time since the earthquake in 2015.13 \n \nPoverty,  social,  and  gender  impact.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  disproportionate \n9. \nimpacts  on  the  poor,  informal  sector  workers,  migrant  workers,  households  depending  on \nremittances,  and  women.  With  the  economic  disruption  caused  by  the  pandemic,  vulnerable \nindividuals, including those who are just above the poverty line, are likely to be pushed below the \npoverty line. Also, Nepal\u2019s estimated poverty headcount ratios are 3.9% at $1.90 a day, 27.6% at \n$3.20 a day, and 65.1% at $5.50 a day for FY2020.14 The adverse impacts of the pandemic are \n\n11 Loans to MSMEs refer to loans of less than NRs1 million. \n12  Nepal Rastra Bank. 2020.

Informal  sector  employment  accounts  for  84.6%  of  total  employment.15 \nInformal sector workers are not entitled to sick pay or health insurance, and are ineligible for social \nsecurity benefits. Women are likely to be most affected, as they comprise 66.5% of informal sector \nworkers  in  Nepal,  and  the  lockdown  has  increased  their  household  and  care  work.  Returnee \nmigrant workers are anticipated to remain unemployed because of the pandemic\u2019s adverse impact \non the domestic economy and employment market. Migrant workers comprise about 12% women \nand  several  historically  disadvantaged  groups\u2014the  Adivasi  Janajati  (indigenous  groups),  Hill \nDalits  (lowest  caste),  other  Madheshi  (inhabitants  of  the  Terai)  castes,  Terai  Janajatis,  and \nMadheshi Dalits.16 The decline in remittances, which is a critical source of income for many Nepali \nhouseholds, exacerbated by unpaid care work, reinforces the burden on women as the primary \nfamily  caregiver.  Moreover,  the  imposition  of  home  quarantine  poses  a  higher  risk  of  violence \nagainst women and inhibits timely interventions to gender-based violence. Since women comprise \n70% of public sector health workers including frontline personnel, they face an unprecedented \nworkload in overstretched health facilities. In addition, 51,420 female community health volunteers \nwho  support  basic  health  services  for  the  government\u2019s  National  Relief  Program,  forming  an \nintegral part of the health care system, are at increased risk of infection.17  \n \n11. \ngovernment\u2019s \ncountercyclical  development  expenditure  program  is  estimated  to  cost  about  $1.26  billion  for \nFY2020: (i) $347 million for health and medical support, (ii) $359 million for social protection for \nthe  poor  and  vulnerable,  and  (iii)  $555  million  for  economic  support  for  affected  sectors.  The \nprogram\u2019s key objective is to control the pandemic and mitigate the pandemic\u2019s adverse impacts \non  livelihood  and  employment,  especially  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  including  women.  The \nprogram\u2019s  health  and  medical  support  key  areas  include  (i)  building  additional  quarantine  and \nhospital bed capacity, (ii) scaling up critical care bed capacity, (iii) introducing health insurance \nscheme for medical personnel, and (iv) providing additional financial incentives to medical and \nhealth  personnel.  The  social  protection  component\u2019s  key  areas  include  (i)  mapping  and \nregistration of the poor and vulnerable people, (ii) food distribution to the poor and disadvantaged \npeople, and (iii) extending employment support to informal sector workers and returnee migrant \nworkers. The economic support component focuses on providing a refinancing facility for affected \nsmall-  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  and  returnee  migrant  workers  and  potential  migrant \nworkers who could not depart due to the pandemic situations in host countries.  \n \n12. \nGovernment\u2019s  countercyclical  expenditure  program  -  activities  and  institutional \narrangements. On 1 March 2020, the government formed the High-level Coordination Committee \nfor the Prevention and Control of COVID-19 (COVID-19 High-Level Committee), led by the deputy \nprime minister, and participated by the Ministers of (i) Home Affairs; (ii) Culture, Tourism, and Civil \nAviation; (iii) Finance; and (iv) Health and Population. The key function of the COVID-19 High-\nLevel Committee is to ensure, on behalf of the cabinet, the implementation of the National Relief \n\ncountercyclical \n\nGovernment\u2019s \n\nexpenditure \n\nprogram. \n\nThe \n\n15  Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission, Central Bureau of Statistics. 2019.

The  CARES  Program  has  been  prepared  in  close \ncoordination  with  the  IMF,  and  takes  into  consideration  the  IMF\u2019s  views  on  Nepal\u2019s  economic \ngrowth and debt sustainability in a pre- and post-COVID-19 scenario.18 ADB ensures coordination \nand complementarity with the IMF and the World Bank in supporting the government\u2019s National \nRelief  Program.  Specifically,  the  IMF\u2019s  support  focuses  on  balance  of  payment  support  with \ncontinued  structural  reforms  for  financial  sector  and  fiscal  stability.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  support \ncenters on strengthening public health sector and medical capacity and inclusive social protection. \nADB\u2019s CARES Program focuses on social protection for the poor and vulnerable and economic \nsupport especially for affected MSMEs. ADB also coordinates bilaterally with the World Bank on \nsupport  to  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Employment  Program,  which  as  part  of  the  government\u2019s \ncountercyclical expenditure program, will provide employment to unemployed people. ADB also \ncoordinates with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the IMF and the World Bank \nthrough the framework of the Advisory Committee, through which ADB, AIIB, the World Bank, and \nIMF  participate  as  an  advisor.  On  health  and  social  protection  support,  ADB  coordinates  with \ndevelopment  partners  through  the  International  Development  Partner  Group  health  and  social \nprotection working groups.

The  CARES  Program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030,  including  operational  priorities  on  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \ninequalities, accelerating progress in gender equality, strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity,  and  fostering  regional  integration  and  cooperation. 20 The  program  will  support  the \nGovernment  to  mitigate  the  severe  social  and  economic  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic. \nSpecifically, the program will assist government to extend support to the poor and vulnerable to \nwithstand  the  pandemic\u2019s  adverse  impact  on  their  livelihoods  through  food  assistance  and \nemployment support. It will pay special attention to establishing gender-segregated hospital units \nand  facilities,  and  ensuring  that  additional  incentives  are  extended  to  women  health  workers. \nFurther, the program will increase women\u2019s resilience to the pandemic\u2019s economic shocks. It will \npromote  resilience  to  external  shocks  and  strengthen  public  service  delivery,  especially  in  the \nhealth  sector,  contributing  to  a  reduction  in  shared  health  risks.  The  program  facilitates  the \ngovernment\u2019s mapping of the poor and vulnerable populations for effective food distribution and \nother relief service  delivery.  For  enhanced  regional  integration  and  cooperation, the  program\u2019s \nsupport  to  the  government\u2019s  economic  response  measures,  especially  financing  MSMEs,  will \naccelerate  the  recovery  of  an  export-oriented  manufacturing  as  well  as  tourism  sector.  The \nprogram complements efforts by SAARC and the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nto ensure coordinated responses to mitigate the impact of the pandemic in the region and facilitate \nthe recovery process. \n \nB. \n \n17. \nProposed  program.

ADB will provide policy \nadvice on the National Relief Program implementation by participating in the Advisory Committee \nas an advisor. ADB will  also support the government by developing the government agencies\u2019 \nprogram  implementation  capacity,  especially  on  targeting,  progress  reporting  and  monitoring, \nthrough  the  existing  ADB  TA  (footnote  24).  The  TA\u2019s  original  objective  is  to  improve  the \ngovernment\u2019s overall project implementation capacity especially on environmental and safeguard \ncompliance,  contract  management,  financial  management,  and  project  management  to  critical \nADB projects. For the CARES Program, the TA will be expanded with an additional financing of \n$800,000 for the government agencies\u2019 sustainable public sector capacity development and pro-\npoor service delivery.26 \n \nIn  addition  to  the  proposed  program,  ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  government\u2019s  COVID-19 \n19. \nresponse includes (i) the Rural Enterprise Financing Project, (ii) the Food Safety and Agriculture \nCommercialization Program, and (iii) Regional Support to Address the Outbreak of Coronavirus \n\n \n\n23 The Food Assistance Program is likely to reach at least 2 million women and girls, based on the assumption of two \nfemale members per household. As per the government issued guidelines, each family (of more than 2 members) \nshould be provided with rice (30 kg), lentils (3 kg), salt (2 packets), oil (2 L), soap (4 bars), and sugar (2 kg). The \nguidelines for food distribution outline (i) beneficiary eligibility; (ii) the quantity of relief materials; (iii) implementation \narrangements; and (iv) reporting requirements, including reporting templates. Local government ward offices identify \nthe households eligible for support through self-registration or by reaching out to vulnerable groups. The final list of \neligible  households  will  be  prepared  after  the  necessary  verification,  including  site  visits  by  ward  officials  and \nendorsement by homeowners. Local government ward offices keep the household records, local government offices \ncollect the household records and submit to the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration.  \n\n24 ADB.  2019.

The additional \nconsultant inputs are required for (i) an international and a national governance specialist; (ii) two national social \ndevelopment  specialists;  (iii)  a  national  data  analyst  and  survey  specialist;  (iv)  a  national  financial  management \nspecialist; and (v) a national economist. \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nImpacts of the Program \n\nDisease 2019 and Potential Outbreaks of Other Communicable Diseases. 27 The Rural Enterprise \nFinancing Project, approved in November 2019, will finance micro and small enterprises for rural \nreduction. 28  The  Food  Safety  and  Agriculture \nemployment  generation  and  poverty \nCommercialization Program, approved in October 2019, provides a budgetary support for reforms \nto  improve  food  safety  and  quality  monitoring  systems;  and  strengthen  institutional  capacity, \nparticularly in subnational governments.29 ADB also provided assistance for the procurement of \nessential health equipment under regional TA (footnote 27).  \n \nFor the medium-term recovery engagement, ADB will continue to support affected private \n20. \nsector  enterprises.  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  will  support  access  to  finance  for  priority \nsectors, including agriculture, tourism, and small and cottage industries. ADB will also continue \nsupporting  the  government  in  developing  essential  basic  infrastructure,  including  electricity \ngeneration,  transmission  and  distribution  networks,  transport  and  roads,  urban  infrastructure, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  trade,  and  agribusiness  facilities.  ADB  plans  to  provide  a  policy-\nbased loan for supporting reforms to strengthen subnational level service delivery in 2021. \n \nC. \n \n21.  \nThe program will provide a critical budgetary support for the government to implement the \nNational Relief Program. The National Relief Program will result in (i) upscaling and expansion of \nthe health system to control the pandemic\u2019s spread; (ii) protecting livelihoods and food security of \nthe  poor  and  vulnerable  groups;  and  (iii)  mitigating  the  pandemic\u2019s  impacts  on  the  economy \nespecially for MSMEs. The first area of impact will be measured in the containment of COVID-19 \npositive cases below 10,000 by July 2022, according to the Health Sector Emergency Response \nPlan: COVID-19 Pandemic (footnote 3). The second impact area will be assessed in food insecure \npopulation below 4.6 million in July 2022. The third impact areas will be expressed as over 90% \nof MSMEs that received the concessional loans will remain operational in July 2022. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nD. \n \n22. \nThe  government  estimates  additional  financing  requirements  for  the  National  Relief \nProgram  of  $1.26  billion  in  FY2020  because  of  the  decrease  in  revenue  and  increased \nexpenditure  for  the  COVID-19  response.  It  is  mobilizing  additional  domestic  resources  of \napproximately  $418  million  from  budget  savings,  provincial  and  local  governments,  the \ngovernment\u2019s regulatory and other agencies, and private contributions (Table 6).

The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year \nthereafter;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.30 The \ngovernment\u2019s development policy letter is in Appendix 3.  \n  \n24. \nDebt sustainability. Nepal\u2019s public debt remains lower than other low-income countries \nand a net external creditor. Under the ADB baseline, the public debt to GDP ratio is projected to \nincrease  over  the  projection  period  but  will  remain  below  50%  by  FY2025.  ADB\u2019s  assessment \nfinds that from 30.1% of GDP in FY2019, the pandemic increases the debt-to-GDP ratio to 39.0% \nin FY2020 and 43.4% in FY2021 as growth dips and the primary balance worsens to fight the \npandemic and support recovery. The projected debt path is slightly higher (1 percentage point) \nthan  the  baseline  considered  under  the  IMF\u2019s  Rapid  Credit  Facility  (RCF)  approved  on  6  May \n2020, primarily due to a higher primary deficit assumption in FY2020. For instance, in FY2020 \nalone, the increase in the public debt GDP ratio of 8.9% of GDP is mainly due to the high primary \ndeficit of 7.9%. Nepal\u2019s public-debt to GDP ratio will stabilize when the primary deficit is at 3.5% \nof  GDP.  Further,  while  the  IMF  baseline  includes  COVID-19  response  from  key  development \npartners  namely  ADB  (proposed  $250  million),  IMF  ($214  million  already  approved),  and  the \nWorld Bank ($29 million approved in FY2020), ADB\u2019s baseline includes additional support from \nWorld  Bank  ($250  million  likely  to  be  effective  in  FY2021)  and  AIIB  ($100  million  proposed  in \nFY2021). These multilateral loans are about 1.6% of GDP in FY2020 and 1% in FY2021.  \n \n25.   Risks to Nepal\u2019s debt sustainability remain contained. Main risks include low growth and \nhigh  primary  deficits.  A  slowing  Indian  economy  and  sluggish  remittances  are  likely  to  slow \nNepal\u2019s  growth.  A  negative  growth  shock,  with  GDP  growth  1.1  percentage  points  below  the \nbaseline in the first two years along with corresponding falls in nominal growth, is likely to increase \nthe debt-to-GDP ratio at a faster pace reaching a peak of 49.3% in FY2025. A primary balance \nshock with the primary deficit 1.4 percentage points above the baseline in the first two years of \n\n30 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\nThe  MOF  will  serve  as  the  executing  agency  (EA).  The  EA  will  coordinate  with  the \n\nprojection, will elevate debt levels to 50.5% in FY2025. The two shocks combined will push the \ndebt  to  GDP  ratio  further  higher,  crossing  the  50%  threshold  earlier  in  FY2024  and  reaching \n51.3% in FY2025. The IMF\u2019s latest assessment under the RCF confirmed that even under the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, Nepal\u2019s debt is assessed to remain at a low risk of external and overall debt \ndistress. However, a deeper global slowdown could negatively affect the risk of debt distress.   \n \nE. \n \n26. \nimplementing agencies (IAs) and ensure that they achieve the program\u2019s output targets.  \n \n27. \nThe  IAs  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Livestock  Development;  the  MOHP;  the \nMinistry of Federal Affairs and General Administration; the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and \nSupplies;  the  Ministry  of  Labour,  Employment  and  Social  Security;  and  the  NRB.  The \nimplementing  agencies  will  (i)  implement  the  respective  National  Relief  Program  actions;  (ii) \ncoordinate  with  local  governments,  provide  implementation  guidance,  and  conduct  monitoring \nand supervision; (iii) submit semiannual progress updates and report any implementation issues \nto the EA; and (iv) respond to information requests by the EA. \n \n28. \nThe  COVID-19  High-Level  Committee  will  act  as  the  CARES  Program\u2019s  steering \ncommittee  and  provide  policy  level  guidance  to  the  EA.  The  Advisory  Committee,  under  the \noversight  and  guidance  of  the  COVID-19  High-Level  Committee,  will  conduct  an  integrated \nassessment  of  COVID-19  impacts,  identify  the  IAs\u2019  funding  gaps  in  the  implementation  of  the \nCOVID-19 response plan; and advise on funding requirements and resource mobilization.  \n \n29. \nThe proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  disbursement  will  be  made  in  a  single \ntranche upon loan effectiveness, which is expected in May 2020. The program implementation \nperiod is from May 2020 to July 2021. \n \n30.  Monitoring and reporting. The EA will conduct joint quarterly meetings with the IAs to \nreview the progress of the response plan. The meetings will be chaired by the Joint Secretary, \nInternational Economic Cooperation Coordination Division, MOF. ADB will participate in the EA \nand IAs\u2019 joint quarterly meetings to have an updated program implementation status and provide \nimplementation advice as and when needed by the EA and IAs. \n \nThe  MOF  will  submit  semiannual  progress  reports  covering  (i)  macroeconomic  and \n31. \nfinance sector performance; (ii) the implementation of COVID-19 response measures; (iii) overall \nfinancial  progress  of  the  countercyclical  program;  (iii)  the  achievement  of  poverty,  social,  and \ngender targets and, as feasible and based on sex-disaggregated data, the program\u2019s impact by \ngender;  (v)  compliance  with  the  loan  agreement;  and  (vi)  budget  execution.  ADB  will  provide \nconsultant support to the executing and implementing agencies, to support strengthening of the \ngovernment\u2019s  program  performance  monitoring  system,  including  the  data  and  information \nrequirements, reporting templates, and verification measures (footnote 24). ADB will coordinate \nwith other development partners to harmonize reporting.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nGovernance. ADB\u2019s  2017  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  Nepal\u2019s \n32. \nfinancial management arrangements are satisfactory given the following measures: (i) enhanced \ncustoms automation and its potential to reduce revenue leakages; (ii) rollout of the Computerized \n\n \n\n\fGovernment Accounting System web-based accounting software; (iii) additional staff resources \nand  training,  particularly  in  procurement,  information  technology,  and  integrity;  and  (iv)  added \ninterventions  by  the  national  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability  secretariat  to \nstrengthen  internal  audit  and  budgeting,  and  the  Nepal  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards.31 \nADB,  in  collaboration  with  other  development  partners,  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  integrity \ninstitutions such as the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority and the National \nVigilance Centre.32 \n \nPoverty  and  social.  The  program  will  ensure  that  the  benefits  of  the  government\u2019s \n33. \ncountercyclical measures reach the poor and vulnerable groups. It will support the government to \nextend food assistance to eligible individuals and households and provide employment support \nto informal sector workers and returnee migrant workers. The outreach to poor and vulnerable \ngroups will be tracked by establishing a program performance monitoring system. The program \nwill support the implementing agencies in providing effective outreach and monitoring under the \nTA (footnote 24).  \n \nGender. The program will also ensure specific gender equality and social inclusion targets \n34. \non each response measure, and continue the coordination with other development partners to \nbuild  capacities  for  effective  monitoring.  The  program  sets  specific  measures  in  (i)  increasing \nquarantine  space  with  separate  wards for  women;  (ii)  additional  incentives  to  at  least  490,000 \nfemale  health  and  frontline  personnel;  (iii)  extending  employment  support  to  at  least  250,000 \nwomen including returnee migrant workers and at least 125,000 individuals from disadvantaged \ngroups, and (vi) providing concessional financing to at least 3,000 women MSMEs and at least \n1,500 women MSMEs from disadvantaged groups. Data disaggregation by sex, age, and other \ndimensions  of  social  exclusion  will  be  ensured.  The  government  is  requested  to  report  the \nprogress  on  poverty,  social,  and  gender  targets  through  semiannual  program  performance \nmonitoring reports. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. \n\n \nSafeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \n35. \nis  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  people\u2019s \nsafeguards.  The  program  is  not  expected  to  have  any  environmental  or  social  safeguards \nimpacts, within the meaning of Safeguard Policy Statement.   \n \n36.

This development  policy\nletter affirms our request  to obtain $250  million  from the COVID-1g Active Response\nExpenditure  Support  (CARES)  Program  under ADB's Countercyclical  Support  Facility:  COVID-\n19 Pandemic Response Option  (CPRO).\n\nSince the outbreak  of the COVID-19  pandemic in January  2020,  the World Health Organization\nhas reported more than 3.6 million  confirmed  cases, with nearly  250,000  deaths  worldwide,  so\nfar. As of 7 May 2020, Nepal has 101 confirmed  cases,  with no death  recorded.  Of the\nconfirmed cases, 22 individuals  have been treated successfully. Nepal  has conducted\napproximately  14,500  swab tests and more than 22,000 individuals have been kept in\nquarantine. The  government  has declared  a full-scale  national  lockdown which is in place since\nMarch  24,2020.  There  is also a restriction  on cross-border  movement of people.\n\nThe COVID-19  pandemic has significantly  impacted  lives and livelihood of the Nepali people.\nThe pandemic has led to urgent needs in the health sector. The  poor and vulnerable  groups are\ndisproportionately  affected,  with several  businesses either shut already  or in a crisis. Prior to the\noutbreak, the economy  had been growing  atan average  of 7.0o/o during FY2017 and FY2019.\nThe early estimates show  that the real output growth in F/Y 2019120  will decline  by 2 to 4\npercent  in compare  to pre COVID outlook,  with  possible  impact extending into the next  fiscal\nyear depending on the severity  of the pandemic and the time for resumption to normality.\nCustoms  revenue  collection has significantly  decreased,  while the fiscal deficit is expected  to\nwiden by 2.7To 9f GpP and immediate fiscal  financing  need is about 2.6% of GDP\n(Approximately $ 817 million).  Remittance  inflow in this year is expected  to decline  by about 3%\nof GDP, as the potential  migrants  are held up and job losses  are expected  in destination\ncountries.\n\nTo address the impact  of the pandemic, on 29 March 2020, the government announced a\nNational Relief Program,  which covers  3 components:  (i) health  and  medical  support,  (ii) social\nprotection  for the poor and vulnerable,  and (iii) economic  support  for affected  sectors.  To\nimplement the National  Relief Program, the government  issued  the Relief Program Action\nlmplementation  Plan  on 3'1 March 2020.1n  this action  plan, the government  identified for each\nof the individual  interventions  a responsible  sector  ministry or agency.

The government  also issued  the Standard  for Relief Programs  for\nthe lnformal Sector Worker and the Helpless on 1 April 2020  to provide  clear  instructions to the\ndifferent agencies how the relief packages should reach  the poor and vulnerable.\n\nThe tentative cost for the government's  National Relief  Program for FY2020 is estimated at\n$1.26 billion, with (i) $347 million  for the medical  and health  response,  (ii) $SSg million for the\nsocial protection  for the poor and  vulnerable, and (iii) $555 for the economic support  for the\naffected sectors. The expected  results  for each  component  are summarized  as follows.\ni) \nNational  Relief  Program  - health  and medical support  (component  1). As per the\nproposed Health Sector Emergency Response Plan:  COVID-19  Pandemic, which benefitted\nfrom the advice of the World  Health  Organization  office in Nepal, the government  has\nestablished  coordination  mechanisms  between  different levels of government  structures to\neffectively  engage;  enhanced  testing capacity,  expanded  the quarantine  and isolation  bed\ncapacities;  increased intensive care unit (lCU)  bed  capacity and available  human resources;\nimproved risk  communication  and community engagement  interventions;  and strengthened  case\ninvestigation,  contact  tracing  and  increased  surveillance.  The government aims to strengthen\nthe health system  by August 2020  as per the following  three targets.  The first target is to\nincrease the testing  capacity  of the medical system to at least 3,000 tests per day from the 500\ntest per day capacity  as of end of April 2020. The second  target is to set up quarantine  space\nfor at least 200,000 people with separate  wards for women and men  in all 7 provinces  from\ncapacity available  tor 49,334 people  as of 30 April 2020. The government  has issued  separate\nquarantine  guidelines  to ensure minimum  quality. The third target is to provide  doctors,  nurses\nand other  health professionals  with temporary  salary  increase of 25 to 100% as hazard\nallowance  depending  on their level of involvement.  ln addition,  the village level  female health\nvolunteers will receive  a financial  incentive. ln total, the government aims to provide these\nincentive to at least 70,000  health  and  frontline workers,  of which  about  70o/o  will be women,  by\nAugust  2020.\nAnnex  1 lists the more detailed activities and  the responsible  agencies  for implementation  of\ncomponent  1, as per the Relief Program  lmplementation Action  Plan.\nii)  National  Relief Program  -  social  protection for the poor and vulnerable\n(component  2). The poor and vulnerable,  including returning migrants, will be severely affected\nby the economic  impact  of the pandemic.  The National  Relief  Program includes  several\nmeasures to minimize the negative  impacts. The  government  aims to provide food  to at least  1\nmillion  poor  and disadvantaged  households,  latest by the end of the ongoing  fiscal year. ln a\nworst-case scenario up to 1.3 million  households  might need this support. As many  migrant\nworkers will re[urn home and workers  in the informal sector might  become unemployed,  the\ngovernment targeits  th?{ at least 500,000  workers  will have  received  employment  support\nthrough  the Prime  Ministers  Employment  Program  by the end of next fiscal year. As this is an\ninclusive  program,  at least  507o of the beneficiaries  are expected  to be female  and  25% of the\nbeneficiaries from a disadvantage  background,  in proportion  with the number of people\nregistered.\nAnnex 2 provides more details  on the activities and the agencies  responsible for implementation\nof the second component  as per the Relief Program  Action  lmplementation  Plan.\n\niii)  National  Relief  Program - economic  support for affected  sectors (component  3).\nTo support individual and companies  adversely atfected several measures  are announced  by\n\nTel: Minister  4211g0g,  Secretary  4211332,lnternational Economic Cooperation  Coordination  Division  4211372,4211867\nFax N o. 42111 64, 42111 65, Webs ite : www. mof  . gov.  n p\n\n\fGovernme\n\nMINISTR\n\nof Nepal\nFINANCE\n\nSINGHADURBAR\nKATHMANDU, NEPAL\n\nthe Ministry  of Finance to ease the tax burden  and  address challenges in trade.  ln addition,\nNepal Rastra  Bank (NRB), the central bank, issued  directives to suppo[  affected individuals and\nbusinesses,  including  providing  refinancing  facility  to at least 1o,O0o affected  micro,  small  and\nmedium sized enterprises  (MSMEs), to aviil the concessional  loans by the end of the next fiscal\nyear. ln line with the government's  priority, at least  3}o/o of the loins  will be sanctioned  to\nwomen-led  MSMEs  and at least  50% of these women-led  MSMEs  shall  refresent  women from\ndisadvantaged groups, depending  on the actual number of appticants.

Nepal  is committed to implementing an\ninclusive  and pro-poor  national  relief  program  as outlined  above. fnereiore,  sp\"iin\" target-s  fJr\nwomen and disadvantaged  groups are included.\n\nThe cumulative cost of the health  care,  food support,  social  safety  and economic  recovery\nprograms is estimated  to be about  4% of GDP.  With  declining  revenues  and the need to\nincrease spending,  the government  is reprioritizing  and reprogra,iming  its budgetary  altocation\nfor this and next fiscal  year. Government  agencies  have been instructed  to cut down on less\npriority  expenditures. However,  the primary estimates on financing  requirements  and the net\nfinancing  gap for this fiscal  year is signiflcant.  The government's initial estimate to meet this\nrequirement entails contributions from different sourcel as listed betow in annex  4.\n\nThe government  is fully committed  to responding to the COVID-19  pandemic.  Early on, a High-\nlevel Coordination Committee for the Prevention and Control  of COVID-19,  chlireO  Oy ine\nDeputy Prime Minister and represented  by nine ministers,  was formed  to coordinate  government\nactions to respond to the pandemic.

Adverse impact of \n\nexogenous shocks. \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \n\nDecline  in  growth.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  caused \nsevere sudden disruptions in the economy. It is estimated that \nthe COVID-19 pandemic will lead to economic losses of $2.3 \nbillion or 7.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2020 and \nFY2021. ADB projected 6.3% GDP growth for FY2020 before \nthe pandemic; however, the official GDP growth is estimated \nto  decline  to  2.3%.  The  impacts  have  already  surfaced  in \nsectors  such  as  tourism,  trade,  health,  and  disrupted  supply \nchains.  The  hotel  and  restaurant  sector  revenue  is  likely  to \ncontract  by  16.3%  in  FY2020  after  rising  by  7.3%  a  year \nearlier.  The  transport  sector  revenue  is  estimated  to  fall  by \n2.4% in FY2020 compared to a rise of 5.9% in FY2019. The \nmanufacturing  sector  is  estimated  to  contract  by  2.3%  in \nFY2020 after expanding by 6.8% in FY2019. The restriction of \ntravel has particularly affected Nepal\u2019s hospitality and tourism \nindustry,  which  is  a  major  foreign  exchange  source.  The \nimpact has been also visible in manufacturing industries. In the \ncurrent situation in which many migrant workers are returning \nto Nepal, the effect on remittances is significant and creates a \nsevere  impact  on  the  economy\u2019s  overall  consumption.  The \nlatest  IMF  forecasts  released  on  6  May  2020  projects  GDP \ngrowth to be 1.0% in FY2020 and 3.5% in FY2021.a \n \nFiscal  stress.  The  revenue  mobilization  is  expected  to \ndecrease  from  pre-COVID-19  estimate  of  28.0%  of  GDP  to \n25.8%. With rising health and public order expenses in due to \nthe  COVID-19  pandemic,  fiscal  deficit  will  widen  from  pre-\nCOVID-19  estimate  of  6.4%  of  GDP  to  8.5%  in  FY2020. \nSimilarly,  current  account  deficit  will  widen  from  pre-COVID-\n19 estimate of 5.4% of GDP to 7.5% in FY2020. A twin deficit \nof fiscal and current account balances will be more prominent \nthis  fiscal  year,  exerting  pressure  on  limited  fiscal  space  to \nmeet new expenditures.  \n \nFinancial sector distress. The economic disruptions caused \nby  the  pandemic  are  affecting  the  real  sector,  which  is \nreflected  in  the  financial  sector  performance.  The  NPL  ratio \nstarted showing a worsening trend from NPL ratio of 1.74% in \nDecember  2019  to  1.77%  in  March  2020.  Similarly,  the \nfinancial  sector\u2019s  capital  adequacy  ratio  is  deteriorating  from \n14.19%  in  December  2019  to  13.97%  in  March  2020.b \nRemittances,  which  grew  by  3.61%  in  FY2019,  declined  by \n50.07% in April 2020 as compared to April 2019.b Remittance \ninflow declined first time since the Nepal earthquake in 2015. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n \n2.

The \ncost  of  the  government\u2019s  National  Relief  Program  for  fiscal \nyear  (FY)  2020  is  estimated  at  $1.26  billion,  comprising  (i) \n$347  million  for  health  and  medical  support,  (ii) $359 million \nfor social protection for the poor and vulnerable, and (iii) $555 \nmillion for economic support for affected sectors. \n \nKey  health  and  medical  support  actions  include  (i)  building \n(ii) \nadditional  quarantine  and  hospital  bed  capacity; \nestablishing \n(iii) \ntest  capacity; \ninstructing private hospitals with a capacity of 50 or more beds \nto  prepare  isolation  wards  to  treat  suspected  COVID-19 \npatients;  (iv)  scaling  up  critical  care  bed  capacity;  (v) \nintroducing  health  insurance  scheme  to  medical  personnel; \nand (vi) providing additional financial incentives to medical and \nhealth personnel.  \n \nKey  actions  in  social  protection  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable \ninclude  (i)  mapping  and  registration  of \nthe  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  people;  (ii)  food  distribution  to  the  poor  and \ndisadvantaged  people;  (iii)  instructing  firms  to  pay  wages \nduring the lockdown period; (iv) contributing to the employers \nand employee shares for the social security fund for at least \none  month;  (v)  registering  returnee  migrant  workers;  (vi) \nproving  returnee  migrant  workers  with  employment  support; \nand (vii) extending employment support to informal workers.c \n \nThe  key  actions  for  economic  support  for  affected  sector \ninclude  (i)  allowing  deferred  the  tax  filing  for  at  least  one \nmonth,  and  (ii)  waiving  all  customs  duties  on  medical \nequipment.  NRB,  the  central  bank,  issued  a  directives  in \nrelation  to  the  government\u2019s  response  plan  including  (i) \nallowing  debt  rescheduling  until  end  of  FY2020  with  no \npenalty;  (ii)  instructing  banks  to  provide  10%  interest  rate \ndiscount  to  the  borrowers  who  repay  on  time;  (iii)  extending \nloan repayment of short-term working capital loans by 60 days; \n(iv)  instructing  banks  to  relax  the  loan  amount  ceiling  and \napprove  loans  within  5  days  for  tourism  and  transport \nbusinesses; (v) allowing banks count loans to health facilities \nfor COVID-19 treatment qualify towards priority sector lending \nrequirements;  (vi)  lowering  the  mandatory  cash  reserve  rate \nfrom  4%  to  3%  and  reduce  the  interest rate  on the  standing \nliquidity facility rate from 6% to 5%; (vii) providing a refinancing \nfacility of NRs100 billion for affected small- and medium-sized \nenterprises, including financing for short-term working capital \nas well as for returnee migrant workers; (viii) providing grant \n\n\f3.

More  recently,  inflation \nbecame 6.5% in the first 8 months of FY2020.  \n \nFiscal deficit moderated to 5.1% of GDP in FY2019, after rising \nto  6.6% \nthan  planned  capital \nexpenditures.  Current account deficit narrowed from 8.2% of \nGDP  in  FY2018  to  7.7%  of  GDP  in  FY2019.  Gross  foreign \nexchange reserves were comfortable at $9.5 billion, enough to \ncover  import  of  7.8  months  in  FY2019.   With  an  average \nto  FY2019, \nrevenue \nthe revenue mobilization (excluding foreign grants) has been \nrobust.  Total external debt stood at 17.0% of GDP in FY2019, \nslightly lower than 17.3% of GDP in FY2018. External debt is \nlargely  long-term  at  concessional  rates  from  multilateral \nfinancial institutions and bilateral donors. External debt service \nis equivalent to about 8.2% of exports of goods and non-factor \nservices. \n \nIMF Article IV consultation concluded in February 2020, which \ndid  not  take  the  COVID-19 \ninto  consideration, \nconfirmed that Nepal had seen strong growth and significant \npoverty reduction, and had expected Nepal to growth 6.0% in \nFY2020.  IMF  further  assessed  that  a  neutral  fiscal  stance \ndriven  by  under  spending  of  the  budget  is  expected  to  help \ncontain  external  and  domestic  pressures.e  A  neutral  fiscal \nstance driven by under spending of the budget is expected to \nhelp contain external and domestic pressures. \n \nAs  part  of  the  pandemic  response,  the  government-initiated \npolicy,  and  institutional  structural  reforms  to  enhance  the \npublic  sector  resilience  to  emergencies,  especially  in  the \nhealth sector. MOHP developed the Health Sector Emergency \nResponse Plan: COVID-19 Pandemic, which provides detailed \ninstitutional mechanisms and procedures to be adopted during \na pandemic. The plan provides detailed steps on (i) command \nand  control,  (ii)  risk  assessment,  (iii)  communication,  (iv) \ntreatment,  (vi) \nsurveillance,  (v)  case \n\ninvestigation  and \n\nimpact \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n \n\n5.  Debt sustainability \n\n \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \n\npreventing  spread  of  the  disease  in  the  community,  (vii) \nmaintaining  essential  services,  and  (viii)  research  and \nevaluation. The plan prescribes strategic approaches and key \ninterventions for (i) health systems, (ii) public health and social \nmeasures, (iii) curative care, and (iv) strengthened monitoring. \nThe  management  and  oversight \nfurther \nelaborated  into  (i)  safety  and  security  of  frontline  staff,  (ii) \nhuman  resource  management  and  capacity  building,  (iii) \nlogistics and supply chain management, (iv) collaboration and \npartnership, and (v) monitoring, evaluation and reporting.  \n\nfunctions  are \n\n \n\nthe  pandemic  response  plan, \n\nIn \nthe  government  also \nincorporated financial sector structural reforms to enable the \nregulatory authorities and financial institutions to maintain the \nsector\u2019s liquidity and stability at the time of emergencies. NRB, \nthe central bank included the reform measures of (i) allowing \nbanks count loans to health facilities for COVID-19 treatment \nqualify  towards  priority  sector  lending  requirements,  and  (ii) \nlowering the mandatory cash reserve rate from 4% to 3% and \nreduce  the  interest  rate  on  the  standing  liquidity  facility  rate \nfrom 6% to 5%. Further, the government expanded its scope \nof  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Employment  Program,  which  was \noriginally  targeted  at  domestic  unemployment  to  returnee \nmigrant workers whose contracts in their host countries abroad \nwere affected due to the pandemic.  \n \nADB\u2019s debt sustainability assessment finds that from 30.1% of \nGDP  in  FY2019,  the  pandemic  increases  the  debt-to-GDP \nratio to 39.0% in FY2020 and 43.4% in FY2021 as growth dips \nand  the  primary  balance  worsens  to  fight  the  pandemic  and \nsupport  recovery.  This  assessment  assumes  the  primary \ndeficit  to  be  7.9%  of  GDP  in  FY2020.  As  growth  picks  up, \npublic  debt  will  continue  to  rise  at  a  slower  pace  and  reach \n48.5% in FY2025. The debt path of the ADB baseline is about \n1  percentage  point  higher  than  that  projected  by  IMF  in  the \nRCF  report,  largely  due  to  the  higher  primary  deficit  in \nFY2020.a Nepal\u2019s public-debt to GDP ratio will stabilize when \nthe primary deficit is at 3.5% of GDP. In a stress test scenario \nof  a  negative  growth  shock,  with  GDP  growth  one-half \nstandard deviation (1.1 percentage points) below the baseline \nin the first two years along with corresponding falls in nominal \ngrowth,  is  likely  to  increase  debt  to  GDP  at  a  faster  pace \nreaching  a  peak  of  49.3%  in  FY2025.  A  primary  balance \nshock, where the primary deficit as a percent of GDP is one \nhalf  standard  deviation  (1.4  percentage  points)  above  the \nbaseline  in  the first two years  of  projection,  will  elevate  debt \nlevels to just cross the 50% threshold to 50.5% in FY2025. The \ntwo shocks combined will push the debt-to-GDP ratio further \nhigher,  crossing  the  50%  threshold  earlier  in  FY2024  and \nreaching 51.3% in FY2025. \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\nAsian Development Bank Assessment \n\nApproved  and  proposed  COVID-19  response  assistances \nfrom international financial institutions are $843 million in this \nand next fiscal year. These borrowings are used to finance the \nestimated fiscal deficit in FY2020 and FY2021 and hence are \nalready  reflected  in  the  baseline  debt  path.  The  emergency \nassistance  includes  from  ADB  (proposed  $250  million),  IMF \n($214 million already approved), the World Bank ($29 million \napproved in FY2020 and $250 million likely to be effective in \nFY2021) and AIIB ($100 million proposed in FY2021). These \nmultilateral loans are about 1.6% of GDP in FY2020 and 1% \nin FY2021.  \n  \nThe 2020 IMF Article IV reports that Nepal has a strong debt \ncarrying  capacity.  A  composite  indicator  using  real  GDP \ngrowth,  remittances,  foreign  exchange  reserves  and  world \ngrowth shows a composite indicator score of 3.28 which is in \nthe range of a strong rating. Nepal continues to meet its debt-\nservicing  obligations.  The  thresholds  for  external-debt  to \nrevenue  and  external-debt  to  exports  used  in  Article  IV  are \n21%  and  23%,  respectively.  Between  2009  and  2019,  the \naverage external-debt to revenue and external-debt to exports \nwere 5% and 10%, respectively. The IMF\u2019s latest staff report \nfor  the  disbursement  under  RCF  approved  on  6  May  2020 \nconfirmed that even under the COVID-19 pandemic, Nepal\u2019s \ndebt is assessed to remain at a low risk of external and overall \ndebt distress, unchanged from the 2020 Article IV report. \n \n\n6.  Coordination with the IMF  ADB regularly holds consultation with IMF as part of Article IV \nconsultations,  processing  of  PBLs,  and  other  missions.  The \nlatest  Article  IV  consultation  was  held  in-country  during  5-\n17January  2020.  The  government  has  requested  IMF  to \nextend the Rapid Credit Facility (SDR156.9 million, about $214 \nmillion) \nthe  COVID-19  pandemic.  An \nassessment letter from the IMF has been secured confirming \nthe  government\u2019s  macroeconomic \nthe  soundness  of \nmanagement and other policies. ADB regularly participates in \ndialogue  with  the  World  Bank,  IMF,  and  other  development \npartners on reform initiatives to support macroeconomic and \nfinancial  stability  in  the  country.
