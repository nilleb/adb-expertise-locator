Approximately 52%-\n64% of the 60-70 million microenterprises in Asia and the Pacific are unserved or underserved, \ntranslating to an estimated credit gap of $400-500 billion.2 Historically, banks have not serviced \nlow-income customers, primarily because of the perception of high risk, small loan amounts, lack \nof  proper  identification,  and  absence  of  credit  history  and  collateral.  Microfinance  institutions \n(MFIs)  typically  catering  to  this  market  segment  are  often  not  deposit  taking  and  thus  require \nexternal funding sources.   \n \n2. \nMany  elements  are  needed  to  support  the  development  and  growth  of  a  healthy \nmicrofinance  industry,  including  a  sound  and  transparent  legal  and  regulatory  environment, \nnational  identification  systems  to  aid  know  your  customer  identification,  and  credit  bureaus  to \ncontribute to industry transparency and prevention of client overindebtedness. However, one of \nthe greatest challenges for the microfinance industry is accessing commercial funding to support \ngrowth  and  meet  the  demands  of  their  clients.  With  diminishing  donor  and  grant  funding, \ndiversification  of  funding  sources,  including  commercial,  is  required.  Attracting  commercial \nfunding,  however,  can  be  difficult,  especially  for  smaller  institutions.  Many  domestic  financial \ninstitutions  are  reluctant  to  lend  to  MFIs,  unless  there  are  government-specified  targets  with \nfinancial penalties for non-compliance. While impact funds, bilateral and multilateral development \nfinance banks provide loans to MFIs, the financing gap remains quite large. Additionally, most of \nthese funds are denominated in foreign currency which increases risk for the MFIs unless such \nMFIs  can  hedge  this  risk  in  their  respective  markets.  Therefore,  access  to  diversified  and \naffordable commercial sources of financing, including capital markets, in local currency is critical \nto expand operations and reach more low-income borrowers. \n \n3. \nThe microfinance risk participation and guarantee program (MFP), approved in 2010, fills \nthis market gap by catalyzing commercial financing from the private sector.  Through the program, \nADB shares risks with accredited partner financial institutions (PFIs) to facilitate local currency \nlending to the microfinance sector. Due to the program\u2019s success and increased market demand, \nthe  ADB  Board  of  Directors  removed  the  program  expiration  date  and  included  it  into  ADB\u2019s \nmainstream operations. Through November 2017, the program has supported $598 million of new \nloans  (with  cofinancing  of  $315  million),  reaching  3.45  million  borrowers,  mostly  women.  The \nprogram operates in Bangladesh, India and Indonesia, with the bulk of exposure in India. One of \nthe program\u2019s strongest attribute is its ability to support MFIs through various stages of growth. \nSome of the MFIs in India have grown significantly over time and are now converting to small \nfinance banks and exiting the program. Several of these larger ones are now being funded directly \nby ADB outside the program through long-term debt and equity.3  \n \n\n                                                \n1   A.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAn additional  program  limit  of $100 million  (bringing the  program\u2019s  overall  limit  to  $340 \n4. \nmillion) and major change in scope for the program was approved  by  ADB\u2019s Board of Directors \non  13  December  2017  (Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  under  list  of  linked \ndocuments  in  Appendix  3).  To  expand  the  program  into  different  countries  with  microfinance \nsectors  at  varying  levels  of  maturity  and  to  continue  to  facilitate  funding  to  MFIs  in  existing \ncountries,  it  has  become  evident  that  ADB  needs  to  have  varying  strategies,  structures  and \nproducts. For example, in India the microfinance sector has experienced strong growth and larger \nMFIs have been able to obtain debt and equity from different sources, as well as tap domestic \ncapital markets on a limited basis to decrease dependencies on commercial banks through bond \nissuances and securitization transactions.4 However, the market becomes illiquid beyond highest \nrated  MFIs  with  investors  shying  away  from  lower  rated,  smaller  institutions  and  affordable \ncommercial funding becomes limited for smaller MFIs (38% of funding for mid-sized MFIs and \nonly 14% of funding for small MFIs come through commercial bank borrowing). Interest rates also \nincrease the smaller the  size  of the  MFIs.5 In addition,  MFIs  across the region  have  started to \nbroaden  their  product  offerings  to  include,  for  example,  loans  for  incremental  housing \nimprovements. These types of products are typically delivered through an individual loan product \nand have longer loan terms. This is a clear shift from the group lending methodology historically \nused  in  countries  and  a  clear  sign  of  maturing  clients.  MFIs  in  Bangladesh  have  over  time \ndeveloped new products and upgraded skills of employees to deliver these successfully. In India, \nADB is working with selected MFIs to improve responsible finance practices and \u2013 among others \n- risk management practices, including field operations.  During the expansion to other countries, \nfor  example  Myanmar  and  Sri  Lanka,  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  MFIs  will  be  assessed \ntogether with the PFIs during the due diligence process.  Expansion of the program needs to be \nfacilitated through either domestic commercial banks or other types of PFIs that have established \nmicrofinance lending experience.  \n\nJustification for Cluster Modality \n\n \n5. \nThe transaction cluster technical assistance (TA) will support the MFP major change in \nscope with funds required to develop new guarantee and risk participation products, conduct due \ndiligence  and  financial  analysis  of  potential  new  PFIs,6 expand  to  new  countries  and  facilitate \ndelivery of knowledge products. The design and monitoring framework of the additional financing \nand major change in scope for the MFP covers activities to be supported by the TA. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nThere are no technical assistance funds attached to the program that provide for these \nnew activities. Therefore, a separate transaction TA is proposed. The TA adopts a cluster modality \nfor four  reasons: (i)  it  provides  an  opportunity  to  develop  new  guarantee  and risk  participation \nproducts and conduct due diligence and financial analysis over a longer period of time without \ntying-up the full amount of projected TA resource requirements at the onset, (ii) the TA  can be \nmore flexible and responsive to the needs of the microfinance sector in ADB developing member \ncountries, (iii) it allows a \u201crepeat engagement\u201d with new PFIs for identified weaknesses,7 and (iv) \nis more efficient than processing individual standalone TAs each year.

During PFI annual review processes progress will then also be reviewed. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fand guarantee experts, financial analysts and knowledge experts will be engaged to complement \nMFP staffing.  \n \n7. \nThe proposed TA is designed to support (i) the identification, evaluation and preparation \nof potential new PFIs and MFIs to be accredited under the MFP; (ii) monitoring of portfolio; (iii) \nidentification,  evaluation,  structuring  and  preparation  of  capital  market  instruments  and  other \nguarantee/risk participation products to be guaranteed under the MFP; (iv) capacity building for \nPFIs  and  MFIs,  as  needed;  and  (v)  disseminating  sector  information  and  other  knowledge \nproducts to a broader audience. \n \n8. \nThe TA is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 which focuses on finance sector development \nas one of its five core specializations.8 Poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth is one of \nthe 10 strategic priorities of ADB set forth in the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.9 In its approach \nto inclusive economic growth, ADB will emphasize inclusive finance by improving and expanding \naccess to finance for low-income population and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. The \nexpansion of access to finance for poor women supports ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment Operational Plan, 2013-2020.10 Inclusive finance is also one of the three pillars of \nADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Operational  Plan  which  was  re-affirmed  in  its  2016  review. 11  One \ncomponent of PSOD\u2019s strategic focus is to mobilize third-party support via credit enhancement \nproducts and risk transfer agreements. The TA will support the program to facilitate this through \nencouraging private sector contribution to financing of MFIs.  \n \nC. \n \nOverall  outcome.  The  TA  cluster  will  have  the  following  overall  outcome:  sustainable \n9. \nfinancial inclusion increased. Through a combination of funding instruments, partners will receive \nmore  financing for  lending  to  the  target  population,  and  PFIs  will  be  more comfortable to  lend \ndirectly  to  this  market  segment.  Each  TA  subproject  will  generally  deliver  all  or  some  of  the \nfollowing outputs, as to be specified by each transaction TA subproject proposal. \n \n10.   Output 1: Identification, evaluation and preparation of potential new PFIs and MFIs to be \naccredited under the MFP, including capacity building as needed.  \n \n11. \ninstruments and other guarantee/risk participation products to be guaranteed under the MFP.  \n \n12. \naudience. \n \nD. \n\nOutput 3: Disseminating sector information and other knowledge products to a broader \n\nOutput  2:  Identification,  evaluation,  structuring  and  preparation  of  capital  market \n\nCost and Indicative Financing \n\nOutcome and Outputs \n\n13. \nThe TA cluster is estimated to cost up to $2.0 million which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6 ($1.0 million) and TASF-Other ($1.0 \nmillion)). The first subproject is expected to cost $500,000 (TASF-6) and financing of subsequent \nsubprojects is subject to availability of TA funds. The funds will cover remuneration, travel, and \nper  diem  for  international  consultants;  conference  related  expenditures;  and  miscellaneous \n                                                \n8   ADB.  2014.
