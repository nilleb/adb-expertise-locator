THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Jalalpur Irrigation Project. \n \n2.  The project will build a new kharif season (April to October) surface irrigation system \ncovering about 68,263 hectares (ha) of less productive, predominantly rain-fed land in the Jhelum \nand Khushab districts in Punjab province.1 The irrigation system will become part of the Indus \nBasin Irrigation System (IBIS) by diverting the flows of the Jhelum River at the Rasul Barrage. It \nwill comprise a diversion structure, a 117-kilometer (km) main canal, 23 distributaries, 10 minor \ncanals, 485 watercourses, and associated structures. The primary beneficiaries are 384,000 \npeople in 80 villages in the project area.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector  overview.  Agriculture  contributed  20%  of  gross  domestic  product  and  was \nPakistan\u2019s largest employer, absorbing 42% of the country\u2019s total labor force in fiscal year (FY) \n2015.3 About 30% of the population lived below the poverty line during FY2014, or about 55 million \nout of Pakistan\u2019s estimated population of 186 million (footnote 3). At 36%, the poverty incidence \nin rural areas in FY2014 was almost double the 19% rate in urban areas (footnote 3). Pakistan\u2019s \nmajor crops are wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize, and cotton, which account for 24% of the value \nadded in overall agriculture and 5% of gross domestic product. Punjab\u2019s contribution to the \nagriculture sector is estimated at more than 80%. The province produced 76% of the nation\u2019s total \noutput of wheat, 51% of rice, 65% of sugarcane, 81% of maize, and 72% of cotton. \n \n4.  The Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform has estimated that the agriculture \nsector has to grow 5% per year to reduce the poverty incidence and ensure food security, and for \nthe national economy to reach its 7%\u20138% annual growth target.4 But agriculture\u2019s annual growth \nrate only averaged 2.8% during 2010\u20132014, a significant drop from 4.4% average annual growth \nrates  experienced  during  1990s  and  from  3.2%  during  2000s.5  The  sector  is  increasingly \ndominated by small farmers who produce mostly for their own food needs. Only 17% of farms are \nlarge, produce cash crops, and engage in value-added activities.6 \n \n5.  In the Punjab Growth Strategy 2018,7 the government of Punjab sees growth in the \nagriculture sector as a key element in achieving inclusive growth, and highlights the following: (i) \nincreased crop productivity through improved agriculture research and extension, on-farm water \nmanagement, and farm inputs; (ii) better value chains; (iii) better use of energy; (iv) increased \nhigh-value agriculture; (v) improved land resources and environment and adaptability to climate \n                                                \n1  Kharif refers to the sowing season for summer crops. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Jalalpur Irrigation \nProject (TA 8404-PAK). \n3  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2016.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the \ngovernment of Punjab in strengthening on-farm water management, adapting to climate change \nimpacts, and rehabilitating irrigation systems, all of which require substantial financing resources. \n \n6.  Because  of the  country\u2019s  semi-arid climate,  with  an  average  annual  rainfall  of  240 \nmillimeters in most parts of the country, about 80% of arable land and more than 90% of \nagriculture output depends on irrigation. One of the strengths of the agriculture sector is the \navailability of water from IBIS, the world\u2019s largest contiguous irrigation system covering 15 million \nha  of  farmland,  which  accounts  for  74%  of  the  country\u2019s  irrigated  area.8  The  operational \nperformance of irrigation systems, including IBIS, however, is less than satisfactory. Crop water \nrequirements have dramatically increased as a result of the increase in cropping intensities and \nthe cultivation of high water-consuming crops. While demand for canal irrigation water has \nincreased, surface water availability has essentially remained unchanged as no new reservoirs \nhave been constructed on the Indus River since 1976. Irrigation efficiency is also low at about \n40%. Agriculture productivity per unit of water, land, and other inputs is well below global and \nregional standards because of mismanagement of water resources.9 \n \n7.  IBIS is also financially unsustainable, recovering on average only 24% of the costs \nnecessary for the effective management of the irrigation infrastructure.10 As a result, asset \nmanagement remains a pervasive problem as irrigation departments routinely defer maintenance \nbecause they lack funds to cover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. To establish efficient \nand sustainable irrigation and drainage institutions, the government of Pakistan launched a far-\nreaching sector reform initiative in 1997 across Pakistan\u2019s four provinces with a view to converting \nthe provincial irrigation departments into autonomous and self-accounting irrigation and drainage \nauthorities. The reforms, however, were not fully successful and the self-accounting irrigation and \ndrainage authorities still lack the capacity to carry out their intended tasks.11 ADB, through its \ntechnical assistance (TA), is reviewing the reforms and their related plans and actions and will \nintegrate  them,  as  appropriate,  into  the  transformation  process  of  the  Punjab  Irrigation \nDepartment (PID) into the Water Resources Department.12 \n \n8.  To address the country\u2019s water stress in the short to medium term, Pakistan needs to \ninvest more in (i) water conservation, (ii) high-efficiency irrigation, (iii) the capture of unclaimed \nmonsoon flows to irrigate rain-fed areas, and (iv) modern irrigation systems and measures to \nimprove asset management and irrigation service delivery to ensure food security. \n \n9.  About 20% of Pakistan\u2019s cultivable area is outside IBIS. Farming in most of these areas \n(about 3.24 million ha) is rain fed, resulting in low agricultural productivity. Some of the country\u2019s \npoorest people live in these areas and depend on agriculture for their income. Without a secure \nsource of water for irrigation, farming in rain-fed areas is both a low-productivity and a high-risk \n                                                \n8  FAO. 2012.

Although Punjab accounts for 57% of the nation\u2019s cultivable area and accounts for 78% \nof the nation\u2019s irrigated area, about 13% of cultivable land in Punjab is still rain fed.13 \n \n10.  Proposed investment. The project aims to increase agriculture production by bringing \n68,263 ha of less-productive, predominantly rain-fed agricultural land under new IBIS coverage. \nMore than 500,000 people live in the project area, and more than 70% of these people rely on \nfarming for their livelihood.14 Available water for farming is limited, as runoffs from the nearby hills \nand the groundwater are highly saline. The project will provide as much as 284 million cubic \nmeters of fresh and good quality water annually from the Jhelum River during the high-flow kharif \nseason,15 in accordance with the Water Apportionment Accord that determines the agreed share \nof waters in the Indus Basin among the country\u2019s four provinces.16 ADB first identified the project \nfor possible financing in 201317 and completed a feasibility study in 2015 (footnote 2). \n \n11.  The analysis of climate change impacts in the project area for 2025 and 2050 shows that \nannual rainfall is likely to increase about 4.0% by 2025 and 6.5% by 2050, with the maximum \nincrease  likely  to  occur  in  the  summer  (July\u2013September).  The  analysis  also  suggested  a \nmaximum increase in extreme rainfall events of about 6% by 2025 and 10% by 2050 for a 100-\nyear return period. The temperatures will also rise throughout the year, increasing the water \nrequirements of crops. Such increase will be compensated for by increased precipitation.18 \n \n12.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2015\u20132019, \nwhich prioritizes the promotion of better water resource management and irrigation,19 and is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Pakistan, 2017\u20132019.20 The project is \nincluded in the list of upcoming irrigation subsector investments (footnote 7). It is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 and will contribute to some outputs expected in the \nplan.21 Under the current partnership strategy, ADB has been financing two irrigation subsector \nprojects for the Punjab government. The first was the four-tranche multitranche financing facility \nfor the Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program in 2006. Except for slow progress in the \nfirst tranche, all tranches were completed by the original program completion date of September \n2017 and delivered major intended infrastructure outputs.22 The second is the Trimmu and \nPanjnad Barrages Improvement Project approved in 2014, which is being implemented without \nserious implementation problems.23 \n \n                                                \n13 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of National Food Security and Research. 2013.

Thus, Punjab \nis entitled to an additional 4.4 billion m3 (the balance between the two). The total average water withdrawal of the \nJalalpur irrigation system would be about 6.4% of this unclaimed water entitlement. \n17 ADB. 2013.

The community participatory approach for constructing 485 watercourses under output 2 \nreflects the lessons identified in the country assistance program evaluation, 2002\u20132012: (i) past \nprojects were often successfully facilitated by community-based organizations; and (ii) ADB\u2019s \ndesired shift to infrastructure operations, relying on only a few large contracts, should take into \naccount that certain types of projects may lead to more complete development outcomes when \nnongovernment organizations and community-based organizations are involved.24 \n \n14.  The project is design and procurement ready. The PID completed the detailed engineering \ndesign, successfully and in a timely manner, in August 2017 under the project design advance \n(PDA) approved in January 2016 with $5 million financing.25 The PID has already been in the \nprocess of shortlisting the major project implementation consultants for this project. By the end of \nMay 2018, the PID is expected to complete international competitive bidding for the construction \nof the main irrigation system, and engage the major project implementation consultants. Land \nacquisition for the main irrigation system is in the advanced stage, with 50% completed as of \nSeptember 2017. The improved project readiness reflected the lesson identified in administering \nthe first-tranche of the Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program, which took 10 years to \ncomplete because of the absence of its detailed design and draft bid document at the approval.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: growth of agriculture sector enhanced and \nfood security ensured (footnote 7). The project will have the following outcome: agricultural \nproduction in the project area increased.26 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Output 1: Jalalpur irrigation distribution system established. The structures to be \nconstructed include an intake structure at the right bank of the Jhelum River at the Rasul Barrage, \nwith a design discharge capacity of 38.2 cubic meters per second. The flow will be conveyed to \nthe project area through a 117-km main canal and further distributed throughout the project area \nvia 23 distributaries and 10 minor canals. The good quality water that will be delivered by the \nirrigation system will reduce the use of saline groundwater. Because the main canal will traverse \nnatural drainage channels that carry seasonal and saline flood water from the Salt Range, the \nproject will construct 72 cross-drainage structures for the safe passage of flood water across the \nmain canal. The project will also construct 18 flood-carrier channels to drain saline flood water to \nthe Jhelum River, protect the project area from floods, and restore soil productivity. In addition, \nthe project will construct 253 associated structures, including 42 flow regulators and drops, 16 \nrailway and road bridges, 15 footbridges, and 2 escapes. The project will also construct 485 \nwatercourses and 17 drinking water supply outlets and, for easy access to water by livestock, 30 \ncattle baths. \n \n17.  The project will develop a monitoring and evaluation system using satellite remote sensing \ntechnology to assess irrigation efficiency, crop growing, water productivity, and the abiana;27 and \nwill train staff from the PID and the Punjab Agriculture Department (PAD) to use the system. To \nensure sustainable O&M of the Jalalpur irrigation system, the project will develop a guideline and \na sustainable plan for the system\u2019s O&M with improved asset management and irrigation service \n                                                \n24 Independent  Evaluation  Department.  2013.

To address potential risks \nagainst extreme torrents from the hilly terrain and floods from the Jhelum River, the project will \nalso develop a flood disaster risk management plan. \n \n18.  Output 2: Water-use capacity improved in project areas. The project will construct 485 \nfarm-level field channels (watercourses) to distribute irrigation water over 68,263 ha of farmland \nduring  April\u2013October.  The  project  will  organize  the  beneficiary  farmers  into  water  user \nassociations  (WUAs)  that  will  be  responsible  for  the  O&M  of  the  watercourses  and  their \nassociated structures, and provide training to strengthen their capacity. The project will involve \nthe WUAs in planning, designing, and constructing the watercourses; and will provide precast \nparabolic concrete segments to cover 50% of the length of each watercourse.28 To increase crop \nyields and irrigation application efficiency with minimum water wastage,29 the project will provide \nthe project area with precision land leveling covering about 12,140 ha, high-efficiency irrigation \nsystems (HEISs) covering more than 800 ha, and 20 water storage ponds with solar pumping \nstations, under a cost-sharing arrangement with the beneficiary farmers. The project will train the \nWUAs and the farmers on climate-smart irrigation practices covering (i) the use of solar pumping \nstations, (ii) precise land leveling and HEISs, (iii) irrigation schedules based on crop water \nrequirements, and (iv) other management techniques to maximize water productivity. \n \n19.  Output 3: Farm management capacity improved in project areas. The project will \nestablish 664 agricultural demonstration farms of varying sizes covering 220 ha. The project will \nprovide 6,000 farm households with advisory services and training on climate-smart irrigated \nagriculture practices and more profitable farm management through demonstration activities and \nfarmer field schools. The services and training will cover cropping patterns for high-value crops, \nselection  and  adequate  use  of  seeds  and  fertilizers,  soil  analysis  and  soil  improvement \ntechniques, and better marketing. The project will (i) organize knowledge-sharing events to \npromote modern water management and farming technologies, (ii) provide farmers with private \nagriculture  support  services  for  marketing  and  supply  chain  management  of  high-value \nagriculture, and (iii) help farmers develop links between growers and the market. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The PID will be the executing agency and will oversee the entire project. It has experience \nimplementing projects financed by ADB, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the \nWorld Bank, and has ample technical, procurement, and managerial capacity to oversee these \ninvestments. The project management office (PMO) for canals (PMO-Canals) for the Punjab \nIrrigated Agriculture Investment Program will execute output 1 of this project.31 The PMO-Canals \nstaff has experience in managing ADB projects, such as the Lower Bari Doab Canal Improvement \nProject under the Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program (footnote 22). The PAD will be \nthe implementing agency. A project implementation office (PIO) to be established in the PAD will \nimplement outputs 2 and 3, under the overall coordination and oversight of the PID. Except for \ndirect payments, all funds will be channeled through the PID and the PAD. The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  February 2018\u2013December 2023 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2023 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project Steering Committee \n                                                \n31 In September 2017, the PMO was transformed from the project management unit that implemented two loans under \nthe Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program multitranche financing facility for the Lower Bari Doab Canal \nImprovement Project. \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nChair: Chairperson, Planning and Development Board \nMembers: PID and PAD secretaries, Punjab Finance Department, Punjab \nEnvironment Department, Board of Revenue member \n(ii)  Executing agency  PID \n(iii)  Implementing agency  PAD \n(iv)  Project management office  About 30 main staff in Lahore \n(v)  Project implementation office  About 35 main staff in Lahore and in the field \nProcurement  ICB  3 contracts  $184.0 million \nShopping  Multiple  $26.2 milliona \nConsulting services  QCBS  18 person-months, international  $13.3 million \n(90:10)  524 key person-months, national \nQCBS  277 key person-months, national  $2.8 million \n(90:10) \nQCBS  372 key person-months, national  $2.3 million \n(90:10) \nICS  12 person-months, international  $0.3 million \n30 person-months, national \nRetroactive financing and/or  The project will use advance contracting and has requested retroactive \nadvance contracting  financing for the engagement of the project implementation consultant. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, ICS = individual consultant selection, PAD = \nPunjab Agriculture Department, PID = Punjab Irrigation Department, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, WUA \n= water user association. \na  Includes $20.7 million for the construction of 485 watercourses through community participatory procurements.

The WUAs and the PAD will enter an agreement by which \nWUAs will execute the works. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  The initial 7 km of the Jalalpur main canal from the intake at the Rasul Barrage runs \nthrough a narrow space between the right bank of the Jhelum River and the steep hilly terrain. \nThe PID, under the PDA, examined several alignment options of the initial section through a model \nexperiment, considering potential risks from extreme torrents from the hilly terrain and floods from \nthe Jhelum River, and selected the least-cost solution for capital investment and O&M. The project \nwill build 72 cross-drainages to let the flood flows pass safely across the main canal, and 18 flood-\ncarrier channels to let the saline flood flows pass to the Jhelum River. The design capacity of the \ncross-drainage structures and flood-carrier channels, with a 40-year return period for floods, is \nsufficient to incorporate the risk of the increase in flood events because of climate change.  \n \n24.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project will incorporate innovative satellite remote \nsensing technology into the monitoring and evaluation system for the efficient and transparent \nassessment of irrigation efficiency, crop growing, water productivity, and the abiana. Precise land \nleveling of about 12,140 ha and HEISs covering more than 800 ha will increase irrigation \napplication efficiency to reduce water wastage. The project will build a concrete flume on 50% of \nthe length of each watercourse to avoid water losses. \n \n ", "8 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  The project\u2019s main economic benefits will be increased agricultural production made \npossible by the provision of seasonal irrigation water to about 68,263 ha of land with low \nagricultural productivity. Good quality irrigation, to be made available by the project during April\u2013\nOctober every year, will help not only the summer crops but also the winter crops (October\u2013May) \nbecause of the increased soil moisture at the end of the irrigation season and the gradual \nimprovement in groundwater quality. Over its 6-year implementation period, the project will bring \nabout diversification, increase crop intensity from 13% to 90%, and, depending on the crop, \nincrease crop yield by between 12% and 141%. The estimated internal economic rate of return is \n15%.32 The sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic viability of the project is most sensitive \nto a 2-year delay in the realization of benefits. Therefore, it is essential that the project is \nimplemented as scheduled through the provision of technical and extension support to the project \nbeneficiaries. \n \n26.  The management and O&M of Punjab\u2019s irrigation systems is estimated at $51.30/ha per \nyear. During 2013\u20132016, the government of Punjab has allocated $158 million equivalent or \n$18.60/ha annually on average for this purpose. Despite the financial gap, Punjab\u2019s irrigation \nsystems are in reasonably good condition and deliver an acceptable level of water to end users. \nThe government of Punjab will allocate adequate resources to fully implement the O&M plan to \nbe developed under the project. During the development of the O&M plan, the PID and ADB will \nreassess and reconfirm the adequacy of the O&M requirement.33 ADB will provide small-scale TA \nfor the continued monitoring of the financial sustainability and O&M status of the Jalalpur irrigation \nsystem after project completion. Ensuring the financial sustainability of irrigation systems is the \ncore agenda of irrigation sector reforms. ADB, through its TA, is reviewing the reforms and their \nrelated plans and actions and will integrate them, as appropriate, into the transformation process \nof the PID into the Water Resources Department under ADB TA (footnote 12). \n \nC.  Governance \n \n27.  The  financial  management  assessment  concluded  that  the  PID  and  the  PAD  have \nsatisfactory capability to record financial transactions and balances, provide regular records and \nmonitor reports, and safeguard assets. But their financial management risks were assessed \nsubstantial because the assessment identified an accounting staff shortage in the PID and a lack \nof internal audit arrangement in the PID and the PAD. To address these weaknesses, the PID \nand the PAD will need to be strengthened by appointing additional staff. \n \n28.  Procurement of civil works and goods will follow ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time), while consultant engagement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All civil works contracts valued at $10 \nmillion and above will be procured using international competitive bidding. Consulting services \nwill be recruited in two packages for the project management and construction supervision of the \nPMO-Canals, and one package for implementation support of outputs 2 and 3 under the PIO, \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection method with a 90:10 ratio. Two individual consultants \n(one for social and another for environment) will be required for the external monitoring of \nsafeguard implementation under the PMO-Canals, and two other individual consultants will be \nrequired to support the PID secretary. The procurement risks of the PMO-Canals and the PIO \n                                                \n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 A detailed financial sustainability assessment and a guidance note to develop a plan for the sustainable O&M of the \nJalalpur irrigation system are in the project administration manual. \n ", "9 \nwere rated low.34 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government of Punjab, the PID, and the PAD. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  Agricultural land is turning barren because of groundwater salinity and the use of saline \nflood water from the Salt Range for agriculture, which ultimately reduces crop production and \nleads to increasing poverty in the region. The majority of farmers in the project areas have \nsmallholdings and are considered poor. The construction of a new irrigation system; provision of \nirrigation supplies and agricultural support services; and training on the efficient use of irrigation \nwater, irrigated agriculture practice, and more profitable farm management will contribute to \npoverty  reduction  by  increasing  agricultural  production  and  improving  the  income  of about \n500,000 mostly poor rural people. Irrigated agriculture will create job opportunities for on-farm \nand off-farm labor in both farming and nonfarming communities. The communities will also benefit \nfrom the reliable supply of irrigation water, as well as improved water-use skills. The project will \nconstruct about 17 water supply outlets, which will help reduce poverty by increasing household \naccess to safe water. \n \n30.  In addition to their household tasks, women perform a large proportion of agriculture- and \nlivestock-related activities, which often require the use of water. Yet women farmers are often \nexcluded from training on improved agricultural practices and water-use skills. They also have \nvery little participation in decision making as they are often not WUA members. The project is \nclassified effective gender mainstreaming and will address these gender issues by (i) installing \nwater supply outlets, cattle baths, fencing, and crossing points in strategic places of the irrigation \nsystem; (ii) encouraging women\u2019s participation in the WUAs; (iii) training women on water-use \nskills; and (iv) ensuring women farmers\u2019 participation in training on irrigated agricultural practices \nand profitable farming systems. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows: \n \n32.  Environment (category A). The PID prepared an environmental impact assessment \n(EIA) following the Safeguard Policy Statement. Major anticipated adverse environmental and \nsocial impacts related to construction include soil erosion, noise, cutting trees, and impacts on \npublic structures and infrastructure. Among the potential adverse impacts during operation are \nfloods from hill torrents, disposal of solid waste in canals, and use of fertilizers and pesticides. \nProtected zones near the project area are the Jalalpur Wildlife Sanctuary, which is a breeding \narea for the Punjab urial, and the Rasul Barrage Game Reserve. The EIA established that the \nproject will not have any significant impact on the avifauna and aquatic life of the game reserve, \nnor will it affect wildlife in the wildlife sanctuary. The PID incorporated adequate mitigation \nmeasures into the project design and will implement them through an environmental management \nplan (EMP). The environment experts of the project implementation consultant will supervise the \ncontractor in implementing the EMP. The PID will establish an environmental and social safeguard \nunit, which will ensure that the project is implemented in an environmentally sustainable manner. \nAn external individual environment expert will ensure that all contractual obligations related to \nenvironmental and social compliance are met. The EMP includes provisions on environmental \n                                                \n34 Procurement Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nand social management, as well as an occupational health and safety development program, and \nthe PMO-Canals and contractors will implement them through training and workshops at the \npreconstruction  and  construction  stages.  The  project  complies  with  public  disclosure  and \nconsultation requirements. The PDA consultants held two rounds of community consultations \nduring the EIA process and disclosed the EIA on the ADB website on 4 July 2017. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The main canal, distributaries, and flood-carrier \nchannels to be constructed under output 1 will require 3,283 ha of land. Almost 99% of the \nrequired land is privately owned and will need to be acquired. Out of this, 1,370 ha is agricultural \nland. Only about 5.6 ha is for residential and/or commercial purposes. At the main canal, 216 \nresidential and 10 commercial structures may be affected, along with 43 tube wells and related \nstructures. Construction of the distributaries may also affect about 39 miscellaneous private \nstructures. About 8,000 people may be affected. Of these, 2,920 landowners may lose 10% or \nmore of their agricultural land, while 166 owners of residential and commercial structures may \nneed to relocate. The PDA consultants prepared a draft land acquisition and resettlement plan \n(LARP) following the Safeguard Policy Statement based on a socio-economic survey of 400 \npotentially displaced persons and community consultations. The PID disclosed the draft LARP on \nthe ADB website on 25 August 2017. The PID will prepare the final LARPs following the \nnotification of land acquisition under Sections 4 and 6 of the Pakistan Land Acquisition Act (1894), \nmarking of the project boundaries in the field, census, detailed measurement surveys, and further \nconsultations with affected persons. Under output 2, land will be required for the 485 watercourses \nto be constructed, along with more than 18,910 small farm turnout structures. The required land \nwill be provided by the farmers and local communities as counterpart support, including other \nassets, therefore involuntary resettlement is not involved. Safeguard measures to ensure that \ncontributions are voluntary and documented are provided in the PAM. \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Punjabis comprise the majority of the population in \nthe project area, and there are no communities or groups that may be considered as indigenous \npeoples as defined under the Safeguard Policy Statement. All ethnic groups are mainstreamed \ninto the general Pakistan society and culture. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n35.  ADB has identified and assessed the risks associated in the implementation and sustained \nperformance of the project in aspects such as technical; economic and financial; governance; \npoverty, social, and gender; and safeguards. The project\u2019s overall risk was assessed moderate. \nSignificant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nExtreme weather events cause hill torrent  The PID examined several options for the initial section using a model \nfloods above design discharges, damaging  experiment and selected the least-cost solution for capital investment \nthe irrigation system, farm land, and  and O&M.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n36.  The government and the PID have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the PID have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan agreement and project agreements. \n \n37.  The government of Punjab has assured ADB that (i) by 31 November 2021, the PID will \napprove for the Jalalpur irrigation system (a) the guidelines and plan for sustainable O&M with \nimproved  asset  management  and  irrigation  service  delivery,  and  (b)  a  flood  disaster  risk \nmanagement plan; (ii) by no later than 30 June 2022, the PID will start the implementation of the \nplans;  (iii)  an  adequate  O&M  budget  for  the  completed  Jalalpur  irrigation  system  and  its \nassociated facilities is provided starting in FY2023; and (iv) actual O&M expenses, budget \nallocations, and assessment of recovery of abiana are monitored and recorded annually and \npromptly provided to ADB for at least 5 years following the project completion. The government \nof Punjab has also agreed that no withdrawals shall be made from the loan account until qualified \naccounting staff are engaged at the PMO-Canals in the PID and the PIO in the PAD. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$274,630,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Jalalpur Irrigation Project, from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 20 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n2 November 2017 \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nGrowth of agriculture sector enhanced and food security ensured (Punjab Growth Strategy 2018)a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2024:     \nAgricultural  a.
