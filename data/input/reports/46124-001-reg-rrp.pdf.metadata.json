The  CAREC  corridor  performance  measurement  and  monitoring  (CPMM) \nsystem indicates that in 2012 a typical 500-kilometer journey by a 20-ton truck took an average \nof  19.3  hours  and  cost $1,068.6 A  similar journey  in Western  Europe  takes  about  8  hours  and \ncosts  $800. 7  Delays  are  mainly  due  to  poor  physical  infrastructure  and  inadequate  trade \nlogistics  facilities,  cumbersome  customs  clearance  procedures,  and  limited  utilization  of \ninformation and communication technologies.  \n \nNSW facilities, which enable trade- and transport-related information and documents to \n4. \nbe  submitted  only  once  through  a  single  entry  point,  and  to  be  reviewed  and  processed  by \nrelevant government agencies prior to the cargo\u2019s arrival at the border, can provide significant \nefficiency  gains.  To  maximize  the  benefits  of  NSWs,  coverage  should  be  extended  to  include \ncross-border  electronic  data  exchange.  Many  CAREC  governments\u2014supported  by  business \ncommunities\u2014are designing NSWs to accommodate eventual CAREC-wide interoperability. \n \n5. \nThe  benefits  of  good  BCP  infrastructure  and  NSWs  can  only  be  fully  realized  when \ncountries  on  both  sides  of  the  border  fund  complementary  investments,  and  border  control \nagencies  cooperate.  The  project  supports  the  construction  and  renovation  of  BCPs  in  cases \nwhere  investments  to  upgrade  complementary  facilities  on  the  other  side  of  the  border  have \nbeen  completed  or  are  nearing  completion.  It  will  help  develop  NSWs  based  on  international \nstandards  to  streamline  trade-related  procedures.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.

Both governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \naccord high priority to the project. \n \n6. \nAs landlocked countries, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan need to develop predictable \nand transparent trading environments, improve trade facilitation, and leverage more transit and \ninternational  trade  to  increase  competitiveness  and  sustain  inclusive  growth.  By  modernizing \nBCP infrastructure and developing electronic trade platforms  like NSWs, they can improve the \nperformance  of  CAREC  corridors,  minimize  negative  impacts  of  geographic  isolation,  foster \nmore diverse economic activity, and realize their economic potential. Two road BCPs have been \nselected under the project: the Karamyk in the Kyrgyz Republic and the Guliston in Tajikistan. \nThe BCPs selection is based on the governments\u2019 priority, their special significance for regional \ntrade, complementary development on both sides of the border, and minimal safeguard impacts.  \n\nADB  support for regional  cooperation  intersects with the  strategies  and priorities of the \n7. \nproject  countries,  particularly  those  related  to  promoting  sustainable  growth  and  improving \ngovernance.  The  project  will  help  improve  the  environment  for  trade,  which  is  an  engine  for \neconomic  growth  and  development.  NSW  development  is  consistent  with  the  main  priority  of \ngovernments to improve governance, reduce corruption by increasing transparency, and ensure \neffective public administration by improving the capacity of the civil service. \n\n8. \nThe  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  2012\u20132013  for  the \nKyrgyz  Republic8 and  is  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  development  program  for \n2012\u20132014. The main goal of the development plan is to improve living standards and reduce \npoverty  by  accelerating  economic  growth,  improving  the  business  climate,  and  developing  an \nefficient governance system.  \n \n9. \nThe ADB country partnership strategy for Tajikistan supports addressing the most critical \ndevelopment constraints and creating a basis for higher economic growth.9 ADB is committed to \nhelping  ensure  access  to efficient  and  cost-effective regional transport,  developing  new  export \nmarkets, improving regional customs facilities, and facilitating regional trade. ADB\u2019s strategy is \nto  reduce  logistics  costs  for  trade  and  encourage  knowledge  sharing  between  Tajikistan  and \nother  CAREC  member  countries  to  foster  regional  integration  and  facilitation.  Key  intended \noutcomes  include  improved  regional  transport  connections,  improved  trade  and  transit \ninfrastructure,  and  reduced  cross-border  barriers.  The  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations business plan 2013\u20132014 for Tajikistan.10 \n \n10.  With ADB support, the Kyrgyz Republic has made an initial $1.1 million investment in its \nNSW 11 to  complement  the  development  of  a  customs  unified  automated  information  system \nunder the first CAREC regional project loan.12 Tajikistan has benefited substantially from ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2012.

The  proposed \nproject has incorporated key lessons learned from the past projects: (i) harmonization of trade-\nrelated procedures through enhanced interagency coordination and commitment at the highest \nlevel  are  prerequisites  for  the  success  of  NSW  development;  (ii)  adequate  capacity  of  the \ninformation technology staff is the key in achieving technical and operational sustainability of the \nsystem; and (iii) users\u2019 acceptance is critical to smooth operations of NSW systems.  \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe impact will be accelerated trade growth within the CAREC region and with the rest \nof  the  world.  The  outcome  will  be  faster,  more  predictable  and  cost-efficient  cross-border \ntransport and trade.  \n \nC. \n \n12. \nBorder  crossing  point  improvement.  The  project  will  improve  infrastructure  at  the \nfollowing two road BCPs to improve working conditions and performance of border management \npersonnel, and reduce processing time and cost:  \n \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIn the Kyrgyz Republic, at the Karamyk BCP, located along CAREC corridors 3b \nand  5,  (a)  the  inspection  facilities  including  customs,  sanitary  and  quarantine, \nand veterinary checkpoints will be improved to handle traffic growth and improve \nthe  inspection  process;  and  (b)  power,  water  supply  and  sewerage  facilities, \ncommunication  facilities,  and  office  and  inspection  equipment  will  be  provided; \nand  \nIn Tajikistan, at the Guliston BCP, located in a key conduit of the regional Osh\u2013\nKhujand  highway, \nincluding \ninfrastructure for vehicle inspection and two new border check posts, and water \nsupply and sewerage facilities provided. \n\nfacilities  will  be  upgraded  and  equipped, \n\n13. \nNational  single  window  development.  This  project  will  support  the  establishment  of \nNSW  facilities  to  streamline  data  submission  to  international  trade  regulators,  and  ensure \nconformity of submitted data with the requirements of business processes in  various stages of \ntrade and transport in the international supply chain. International standards will be adopted to \nensure regional interoperability.13  \n\nThe subcomponents of NSW facilities include (i) single window and trade portal software \n14. \ndevelopment; (ii) single window backup system and hardware, regional centers, and trade portal \nhardware;  (iii)  certificate  of  origin  and  licensed  track  and  trace  of  system  development;  \n(iv)  operating  assistance  to  the  single  window  governance  and  working  groups;  (v)  business \nprocess  analysis  and  re-engineering  (for  up  to  10  government  agencies);  (vi)  legal  and \nregulatory framework review; (vii) stakeholder engagement and public awareness activities; and \n(viii)  market  study  and  research.  In  terms  of  sequencing,  a  flexible  software  development \nprocess will incorporate possible policy and regulatory changes resulting from  subcomponents \n(v) and (vi). \n\n15. \nProject management  and  supervision  capacity  strengthening. The project provides \nfunding to engage project management consultants for the project implementation unit (PIU) of \neach project country to provide oversight and supervision.  \n                                                \n13 United  Nations  Centre  for  Trade  Facilitation  and  Electronic  Business  recommendations,  World  Customs \n\nOrganization database requirements, and World Trade Organization standards. \n\n \n\n\fD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $21,007,000  equivalent  (Table  1).

The  State  Enterprise  Single  Window  Center  in  the  Foreign  Arena  under  the \nMinistry of Economy of the Kyrgyz Republic (with support  of the State Customs Service of the \nKyrgyz Republic), and the Customs Service under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan \nwill be the implementing agencies for their respective subprojects. The executing agencies will \nhelp the implementing agencies coordinate closely with other government agencies and ADB for \nthe prompt resolution of any issue, expedite the procurement process, organize project steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  meetings,  and  complete  the  project  by  the  established  target  date.  \nThe  executing  agencies  will  designate  project  coordinators  to  carry  out  these  tasks.  \nThe  implementing  agencies  will  designate  project  directors  to  work  with  project  management \nconsultants  to  provide  overall  supervision  of  project  implementation.  ADB  will  organize  joint \nconsultations  on  project  implementation  at  least  annually  during  the  CAREC  Customs \nCooperation Committee and Transport Sector Coordinating Committee meetings to ensure that \nthe project countries coordinate with each other closely to complete the project in a timely and \nsynchronized manner.  \n \n21. \nEach  project  country  will  set  up  a  PSC,  chaired  by  the  project  coordinator,  to  ensure \ninteragency  cooperation  for  project  oversight.  The  PSCs  will  be  responsible  for  (i) guiding  the \nproject\u2019s  overall  policy  and  strategic  direction;  (ii)  evaluating  project  performance;  (iii)  helping \ncoordinate other projects relating to BCP improvement and single window development funded \nby  development  partners;  (iv)  serving  as  a  platform  to  promote  private  sector  participation  in \ncustoms  and border  control  improvement  initiatives  under the  project;  and (v)  ensuring  project \nimplementation adheres to agreed schedules. They will meet at least twice a year or as needed.  \n \n22. \nEach  project  country  will  establish  a  PIU  under  the  implementing  agency.  The  PIU  will \nmanage procurement  activities,  supervise  the  implementation  of  each  subproject,  prepare  and \nsubmit  periodic  progress  reports  to  the  executing  agencies  and  ADB,  provide  secretariat \nsupport to the PSCs, and regularly liaise with the executing agencies and ADB. The PIU will be \nheaded  by  a  project  manager  and  comprise  a  team  of  project  management  consultants, \nincluding  procurement  specialists,  border  crossing  point  supervision  specialists,  single window \nexperts,  project  performance  monitoring  specialists,  finance  specialists,  and  administration \nofficers. The project manager will report to the implementing agency. \n \n23. \nthe project administration manuals (footnote 14).  \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fTable 3: Implementation Arrangements  \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2017 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body \n\nArrangements \nJune 2013\u2013December 2017 \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n\nA project steering committeea in each of the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan \nKyrgyz Republic: Ministry of Economy \nTajikistan: Ministry of Economic Development and Trade  \n\n(iii)  Implementing agency  Kyrgyz Republic: State Enterprise Single Window Center (SWC) in the \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nQuality and cost-\nbased selection \n\nForeign Arena under the Ministry of Economy \nTajikistan: Customs Service under the Government of the Republic of \nTajikistan (CST) \nKyrgyz Republic: PIU under SWC, 8 staff \nTajikistan: PIU under CST, 8 staff  \n \nInternational \ncompetitive bidding \nNational \ncompetitive bidding \nShopping \n\nTajikistan \n2 contracts \n$5.091 million \n1 contract \n\n2 contracts \n$4.568 million \n \n\nKyrgyz Republic \n\n   $0.753 million \n\n2 contracts \n$0.065 million \n3 contracts \n760 person-months (52 \nperson-months \ninternational, \n708 person-months \nnational)  \n$4.032 million \n\n2 contracts \n$0.189 million \n3 contracts   \n469 person-months (55 \nperson-months \ninternational, \n414 person-months \nnational) \n$4.120 million \n\nAdvance contracting \nDisbursement  \n\nConsulting services \nThe loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the governments and ADB. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PIU = project implementation unit. \na Representatives of other key stakeholders may be appointed as project steering committee members. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n24. \nThe  primary  stakeholders  and  project  beneficiaries  are  (i)  government  agencies \nresponsible  for  regulating  international  trade;  (ii)  civil  servants  responsible  for  carrying  out \nborder  management  functions;  (iii)  traders,  truck  drivers,  freight  forwarders,  and  transport \nservice  providers  engaged  in  international  trade  and  transport  activities;  and  (iv)  communities \nsituated in the vicinity of BCPs that depend on cross-border markets.  \n \nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n25. \nSelection  criteria  for  identifying  BCPs  to  be  part  of  the  project  include  (i)  government \npriority;  (ii) BCP  along  a  CAREC  corridor  or  of  special  significance  for  regional  trade;  \n(iii)  complementary  development  on  both  sides  of  the  border;  and  (iv)  minimal  safeguard \nimpacts.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the  Karamyk  BCP  is  an  important  gateway  in  the  CAREC \nregion. Based on the volume of transit traffic it supports, its significance is clearly of a regional \nnature.  ADB  supported  the  rehabilitation  of  border  facilities  on  the  Tajikistan  side  of  Karamyk; \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nthe project will upgrade facilities in the Kyrgyz Republic. In Tajikistan, new traffic patterns based \non  recent  economic  development  increased  freight  transport.  BCPs  along  these  new  routes \nneed upgrading. Guliston, in particular needs urgent attention to match renovations made by the \nKyrgyz Republic at Kyzyl-Bel on the other side of the border. The Guliston\u2013Kyzyl-Bel BCP pair \nhas special significance for regional trade given its strategic location in an important Tajikistan, \nKyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan  triangle  providing  critical  trade  and  transport  services. \nOverall, the performance of CAREC corridors 3 and 5 is less than optimal. The BCPs are major \nbottlenecks: in 2012, it required 11.8 hours and $147 to cross Karamyk (corridors 3 and 5), and \n1.5 hours and $171 to cross Guliston. \n\n26. \nIn  developing  NSW  facilities,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  have  carried  out \nimportant  preparatory  work,  including  development  of  necessary  information  technology \ninfrastructure  with  support  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  The  work  provides  the \ncountries  with  solid  foundations  for  developing  NSW  facilities.  With  ADB  support,  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic has made an initial $1.1 million investment in its NSW (footnote 11) to complement the \ndevelopment  of  a  customs  unified  automated  information  system  under  the  first  CAREC \nregional  project  loan  (footnote  12).  Tajikistan  has  benefited  substantially  from  ADB\u2019s  previous \ninvestment in a unified automated information system (footnote 12),  Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nInternationale Zusammenarbeit\u2019s conduct of business process analyses, and a \u20ac2 million grant \nfrom  the  European  Union17 to  fund the  initial  stage  of  single  window  development  focusing  on \ndeveloping  system  specification  requirements.  Substantial  work  remains  to  develop  fully \nfunctional  NSW  facilities  that  will  maximize  the  benefits  to  be  derived  from,  and  ensure  the \nsustainability  of,  initial  investments.  The  project  was  prepared  in  coordination  with  other \ndevelopment partners. Effective aid coordination will continue during project implementation to \navoid duplication of efforts.   \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nClear  selection  criteria  were  established  to  identify  BCPs  to  be  upgraded.  NSW \n27. \ncomponents  were  identified  using  a  needs  assessment  and  gap  analysis  based  on  work \ncompleted  or  planned  for  a  specific  country.  The  anticipated  economic  benefits  of  the  project \ninclude  (i)  a  more  informed  trade  subsector  through  the  information  portal,  which  is  a  core \ncomponent of a NSW providing traders with access to information about the relevant governing \nregulatory  agencies,  certification  agencies\u2019  specific  documentary  requirements,  and  official \ncosts  and times for  issuance;  (ii)  reduced  documentary  requirements  for  submission  and time \nspent on obtaining regulatory certification from and submitting documents to customs and other \nregulatory  agencies;  (iii)  reduced  time  and  cost  for  import  and  export  businesses  that  lead  to \nincreased  supply  chain  productivity,  reduce  waiting  time  at  BCPs,  and  translate  to  efficiency \ngains for vehicle operators and passengers; (iv) reduced scope for rent seeking at the interface \nbetween  regulatory  agencies  and  traders  and/or  brokers  as  a  result  of NSW facilities,  thereby \nremoving  the  potential  for  human  factor  intervention;  and  (v)  increased  interest  by  foreign \ninvestors  as  international  trade  processing  becomes  less  cumbersome  and  more  efficient.  \nThe  economic  analysis  resulted  in  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  36.37%  and  net \npresent  value  of  $11.42  million  for  the  subproject  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic;  37.19%  and  $19.48 \nmillion for the subproject in Tajikistan; and 36.99% and $30.89 million for the project as a whole. \nThus,  the  investments  in  the  NSW  and  the  BCP  components  are  considered  to  be  highly \neconomically justifiable and implementation is therefore recommended. \n\n                                                \n17 The European Union-funded project focusing on developing system requirements and software design is expected \nto be completed by October 2013. The ADB project will build on the European Union project and provide support \nfor the NSW hardware and backup system, which will be procured in Q2 2014 to ensure technical compatibility. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nNSW  implementation  aims  to  reduce  administrative  barriers  to  foreign  trade.  Improved \n28. \ntrade  facilitation  will  simplify  trade  processes  and  administrative  procedures,  and  promote \ngreater  transparency  and  predictability  in  international  trade  transactions,  thus  leading  to \nreduced costs for foreign trade participants. NSW benefits will be gained at both the macro and \nmicro  levels.  The  improvement  of  BCPs  will  generate  time  savings  for  freight  movements  and \neventually  have  a  positive  impact  on  trade.  The  provision  of  enabling  infrastructure  such  as \nreliable power supply, water supply and sanitation, and better staff accommodation will lead to \nimproved  staff  welfare  and  productivity  gains.  The  underlying  assumption  is  that  poor \ninfrastructure is causing congestion and delays, negatively affecting trade between neighboring \nCAREC countries and causing decreases in the overall welfare of consumers. Noteworthy to the \nanalysis  is  that  substantial  synergy  could  result  from  the  collective  BCP  upgrades  and \nestablishment  of  NSWs,  transforming  the  CAREC  region  from  one  that  has  been  considered \n\u2015problematic\u201618 to  one  that  welcomes  and  supports  transit  traffic.  Becoming  the  land  bridge \nbetween  Asia  and  Europe  would  generate  considerably  more  benefits  than  are  shown  in  the \neconomic and financial analysis. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nA governance assessment undertaken during project preparation examined policy, legal, \nand  institutional  capacity  to  adopt  good  governance  processes  for  project  implementation.  \nOver the past decade, the two governments have implemented public expenditure reforms that \ncontributed  to  improvements  in  efficiency,  accountability,  and  transparency  in  public  financial \nmanagement.  They  adopted  national  procurement  laws  and  strengthened  efforts  to  reduce \ncorruption.  Further,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  for  the  two  countries  have \nexperience  in  successfully  implementing  ADB  projects,  and  in  the  process  augmented  their \nfinancial management capacity.19 \n\n30. \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  All  consulting  services  to  be \nfinanced under the project will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended from  time  to  time).  Project  implementation,  procurement,  and \nfinancial  management  will  be  aligned  with  the  governments\u2019  standard  operating  procedures. \nAuditors acceptable to ADB will audit the project accounts annually. The project will strengthen \nstaff capacity  in financial  management  procedures.  It  will  use  existing government  websites to \n(i) disclose the implementation progress, and bid notifications and their results; and (ii) provide \nopportunities for reporting any corrupt practice. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with the governments. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manuals (footnote 14). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n31. \nBy  eliminating  physical  and  administrative  obstacles  to  trade  at  BCPs  and  developing \nNSW facilities with regional interoperability capable of electronic data exchange, the project will \n\n                                                \n18 See World Bank Logistics Performance Index and World Bank Doing Business Survey, both of which regularly rank \nthe Central Asian countries quite low. In terms of trading across borders (Doing Business Survey 2013), the Kyrgyz \nRepublic  ranked  174th  out  of  185  economies  and  Tajikistan  184th.  In  Logistics  Performance  Index  2012,  the \nKyrgyz Republic ranked 130th out of 155 countries and Tajikistan 136th. \n\n19 The  State  Enterprise  Single  Window  Center  in  the  Foreign  Arena  under  the  Ministry  of  Economy  of  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  implemented  the  Foreign  Trade  Single  Window  under  the  Investment  Climate  Improvement  Program \nSystem Support Project; and the Customs Service under the Government of Tajikistan implemented the Regional \nCustoms Modernization and Infrastructure Development Project. \n\n\f9 \n\n(i) provide and/or upgrade infrastructure; (ii) improve customs services; (iii) create direct  short-\nterm  employment 20  and  NSW  development, 21  and  indirect  long-term  income  generating \nopportunities;  and  (iv)  reduce  logistics  costs  for  trade  leading  to  lower  consumer  prices  in the \nmarket, thereby contributing to improved economic development for CAREC residents. \n\n32. \nThe  project  design  includes  some  gender  elements.  Public  health  and  gender  equity \nconcerns will be addressed by designing gender-sensitive BCPs, such as separate washrooms, \ninspection  lanes,  and  nursing  areas  for  women;  and  providing  equal  opportunities  for  female \nborder staff. Development of gender-sensitive infrastructure for cross-border trade will improve \nwomen\u2019s livelihood in border communities, as most local traders are women. \n\n33. \nA  more  liberal  trading  environment  could  result  in  increased  human  and  narcotics \ntrafficking, and rate of transmission of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. The project \nwill  augment  measures  for  prohibiting  human  and  narcotics  trafficking  by  providing  relevant \ninformation material to border officers and necessary inspection equipment.  \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n34. \nThe  project  will  not  have  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  or  cause  any  negative \nregional or international environmental impacts. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009),  the  project  is  classified  environment  category  C.  Social  safeguard  due  diligence  was \nconducted  during  project  preparation.  The  project  does  not  involve  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  for  the  components  in  Tajikistan.  However,  three  households \ncurrently  leasing  land for  cultivating  crops  at  the  Karamyk  BCP  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  will  be \naffected.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified  as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement. Affected persons will be provided with appropriate cash \ncompensation  for  the  potential  income  loss  from  the  leased  plots.  The  details  of  the  impact, \ncash  compensation,  and  its  delivery  schedule  are  provided  in  the  draft  resettlement  plan \napproved  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  ADB,  and  disclosed  at  the \nADB  website  on  5  February  2013.  No  ethnic  minority  communities  will  be  affected  since  the \nBCP civil works will be carried out within customs-controlled zones or public land owned by local \nadministrations. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures  \n\ntests \n\nindicate \n\nSensitivity \n\nthat  economic  circumstances  would  have \n\n35. \nto  become \nsubstantially worse for the project to lose its economic viability. Stable economic performance is \nexpected  based  on  the  governments\u2019  projections  and  growth  trends.  Risks  associated  with \npotential changes in government policy are moderate. The project is a high-priority supported by \nthe  governments.
