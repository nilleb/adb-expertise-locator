I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2018s Republic of Bangladesh for the Third Primary Education Development Project.1 \n2.  The  project  is  a  follow-on  to  the  ongoing  Second  Primary  Education  Development \nProgram  (PEDP  II),  the  first  sector\u2500wide  approach  (SWAp)  in  the  education  sector  in \nBangladesh. The project will contribute to the government\u2018s 5-year (FY2012\u2013FY2016) Third \nPrimary Education Development Program (PEDP III) covering 1 year of preprimary education \n(PPE) and 5 years of primary education. Together with eight other development partners, the \nproject will support the government\u2018s priorities of improving student learning outcomes and \ncompletion rates, and reducing disparities across regions. PEDP III will focus on achieving key \noutput  results  and  other  implementation  steps  to  policy  and  institutional  changes  that  are \nessential to meet the government\u2018s objective of providing quality education for all children.2   \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale  \n  1.  Rationale for the Project \n \n3.  Bangladesh has one of the largest primary school systems in the world, with over \n16 million children enrolled in over 80,000 primary schools. Considerable progress has been \nmade in improving access to free and compulsory primary education. Gross enrollment rates in \nprimary education improved from 93.7% in 2005 to 103.5% in 2009, and net enrollment rates \nimproved from 87.2% in 2005 to 93.9% in 2009. Bangladesh was one of the few countries to \nachieve gender parity up to the secondary level by 2005. Despite significant progress in access \nto  education,  high  inefficiencies  persist\u2014high  student  dropout  and  repetition  rates,  low \ncompletion,  and  high  student  and  teacher  absenteeism.  Two  rounds  of  national  student \nassessment indicate low student achievements in grades 3 and 5, but the results are improving.   \n \n4.  The government prepared the National Education Policy (NEP) to address the above \nsystemic issues in primary education.3 The NEP plans to (i) achieve education for all by 2015, \nand (ii) ensure that every child starts primary school by 2011. The NEP aims at reducing \ndisparities between different types of schools, and expanding and improving primary education \nin disadvantaged locations in rural communities and urban slums. The major benefits foreseen \nare reduced repetition and dropout, improved completion rates, enhanced net enrolment rates, \nand improved transition rates to secondary education\u2014all as a result of improved quality and \nrelevance of education in schools with initial input deficits. \n   \n5.  The ongoing PEDP II is jointly funded by the government and 11 development partners; \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is the lead development partner.4 The PEDP II largely \ncontributed to improving primary education participation and introducing key reforms. It has \nachieved  (i)  mainstreaming  minimum  service  standards  across  government  administered \nprimary schools through the primary school quality level standards; (ii) a fair, transparent, and \nefficient teacher recruitment system for government primary schools; (iii) the introduction of \nresults-based  management  (RBM),  which  has  led  to  the  publication  of  the  annual  sector \nperformance report that helps monitor progress on key performance indicators and primary \nschool quality level standards; (iv) initiation of the school level improvement plans (SLIPs) to \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Education Development Program. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \nsupport  decentralized  planning,  and  SLIPs  include  school  grants  to  address  the  needs  of \nparticipating schools; and (v) introduction of the annual grade 5 completion examination and \nimplementation of the national student assessment every alternate year to assess progress on \nstudent achievements in grades 3 and 5. The PEDP II has also established a strong foundation \nfor a SWAp by bringing the government and development partners together for the first time \nunder one program instead of separate projects funded by different development partners. \nLessons  identified  from  the  PEDP  II  and  those  from  the  sector  assistance  performance \nevaluation5 are available in Appendix 2.6  \n \n6.  The PEDP III, which the project will support, will build on the PEDP II achievement, \nlessons identified, and joint experience of the government and development partners. It will \n(i) broaden the scope to include 1 year preprimary, and nonformal and second chance primary \neducation; (ii) deepen quality improvement through improved teaching and learning practices in \nthe classroom, including improved assessment; (iii) enhance school governance, accountability, \nand  community  mobilization;  (iv)  provide  targeted  support  to  disadvantaged  groups  and \nlocations;  (v)  institutionalize  human  resource  development  to  incentivize  the  system  and \nenhance capacity; (vi) deepen and institutionalize an RBM and monitoring mechanism at all \nlevels; (vii) target and ensure effective utilization of technical assistance (TA) at all levels within \nan  emerging  decentralization  framework;  and  (viii)  enhance  subsector  management, \ncoordination, and greater alignment with the country system.  \n \n7.  The  project  will  support  the  PEDP  III  with  a  project  lending  modality  since  (i) the \ninterventions are more of an investment nature and incremental steps toward reforms, rather \nthan structural policy reforms; and (ii) there is a need to ensure close oversight of the fiduciary \nenvironment, so it is not suitable for the use of program lending. However, to align with the \nsalient features of the PEDP III under a SWAp, the project has incorporated some innovative \nfeatures. \n \n2.  Key Innovative Features of the Project  \n8.  The project has three innovative features that are explained in detail in Appendix 2.6  \n(i)  Greater  focus  on  results.  The  project  will  link  financing  to  the  government \nachieving nine annual disbursement linked indicators (DLIs)\u2500output level results \nand implementation steps to policy and institutional changes that are deemed \nessential  to  meet  the  project\u2018s  objectives.  The  use  of  DLIs  will  help  Project \ninterventions move from a focus on activities to a broader program approach that \nfocuses on results. It will also help strengthen the monitoring and evaluation \nsystem and the government\u2018s capacity in results monitoring and reporting.  \n(ii)  Alignment with government system. The fiduciary risk assessment undertaken \nduring project preparation suggested ADB and the development partners to use \nthe government\u2018s treasury system for disbursement and financial management. \nThe  ADB  loan  and  development  partners\u2018  funds  will  be  channeled  to  the \ngovernment\u2018s treasury to finance PEDP III eligible expenditures, included under \ncertain program budget heads (PBHs) in the government\u2018s chart of accounts, as \nagreed between the government and the development partners. The PBHs will \ninclude total subsector expenditures that contribute to PEDP III outcomes, with \nsome  exceptions,  and  will  comprise  both  development  and  nondevelopment \nexpenditures.  \n                                                \n5 ADB. 2008.

Greater  alignment  with  the \ngovernment system enhances harmonization among development partners. The \ngovernment and development partners will sign a joint financing arrangement that \nsets forth the jointly agreed terms and procedures for partners\u2018 support to the \nPEDP III.  \n(iv)  Development partners have enhanced delegated cooperation in key areas of \nmonitoring and oversight, including joint fiduciary oversight of PEDP III by ADB \nand the World Bank.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the PEDP III will be quality education for all children. The outcome of the \nPEDP III is an efficient, inclusive, and equitable primary education system delivering effective \nand relevant child-friendly learning to all of Bangladesh\u2018s children from preprimary through \ngrade 5. As the project is to support the PEDP III, the project\u2018s expected impact and outcome \nwill be consistent with the impact and outcome of the PEDP III.  \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n10.   The four interrelated broad results areas or outputs are (i) improved teaching and \nlearning for all, (ii) reduced disparities and universal access and participation, (iii) decentralized \nand effective organization of the primary education system, and (iv) improved program planning \nA\nand management. The nine DLIs are represented across the four results areas.  p\np\n  en\nd\n11.  Output 1: Improved teaching and learning for all. Output 1 will support (i) initiatives to  ix\n 2\nenhance the performance of all children, (ii) school and classroom based assessment to ensure   \nmonitoring and feedback on every child\u2018s learning outcomes, (iii) initiatives to strengthen the \ncurriculum and textbooks based on revised competencies, (iv) timely production and distribution  3\n \nof quality textbooks to all eligible children, (v) gradual access to information and communication \ntechnology in education to enhance teaching and learning, and (vi) activities to improve teacher \neducation and development to ensure that every child learns. The output includes two DLIs: \n(i) textbooks for each subject produced and distributed to eligible schools within a month of \nopening  day,  and  (ii) a  complete  teacher  development  plan  prepared  and  adopted  by  the \nMinistry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME) and the new diploma in education provided \nto 11,000 teachers annually.   \n \n12.  Output 2: Reduced disparities (universal access and participation).

Two DLIs are included in this output: (i) \nguidelines  for  preprimary  education  on  the  role  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nendorsed by the MOPME, and the coverage of preprimary education expanded; and (ii) needs-\nbased infrastructure implemented to achieve a pupil to usable classroom ratio of 56:1.  \n  \n ", "4 \n \n13.  Output  3:  Decentralized  and  effective  organization.  Output  3  will  support                   \n(i)  strengthening  field  level  offices  by  filling  critical  vacancies  with  qualified  and  trained \npersonnel; (ii) decentralizing school management and governance by deepening SLIPs and \nupazila (subdistrict) primary education plans, and introducing district primary education plans to \nplan, monitor, and target improvements; (iii) developing school level leadership by enhancing \nthe role of head teachers as academic supervisors; (iv) organizational review and strengthening \nfield  offices  by  creating  and  filling  new  positions,  and  institutionalizing  a  career  path;  (v) \nimproving the quality and reliability of the grade 5 completion examination; (vi) maintaining \nefficient recruitment and deployment of teachers; (vii) strengthening the annual school census \nby  expanding  its  coverage  to  include  all  types  of  schools;  and  (viii) strengthening  and \ninstitutionalizing national student assessment. Four DLIs are included in this output: (i) school \nmanagement committees and upazila education offices are strengthened to implement SLIPs \nand district and upazila primary education plans effectively; (ii) the grade 5 completion exam is \ncompetency based and its administration enhanced; (iii) new teachers are recruited based on \nneeds to meet the pupil\u2013teacher ratio of 40:1, and using the existing fair and transparent \nrecruitment system; and (iv) the annual school census coverage will include all types of schools, \nwith improvement in the census form, administration, and reporting accuracy and timeliness. \n \n14.  Output  4:  Improved  program  planning  and  management.  Output  4  will  support         \n(i)  MOPME  and  the  Directorate  of  Primary  Education  (DPE)  in  managing  the  PEDP  III,             \n(ii) implementation of the PEDP III procurement financial management action plan, (iii) ensuring \nadequate sector financing to meet the requirements of the PEDP III in line with the medium-term \nbudgetary framework, (iv) strengthening monitoring functions by building on evidence-based \nplanning  and  RBM,  (v)  strengthening  human  resource  development  based  on  needs  and \nrevising the organizational development and capacity building handbook prepared under the \nPEDP II, and (vi) promoting public\u2013private partnership to engage relevant NGOs and the private \nsector to support education for all. One DLI is included in this output: the primary education \nbudget aligned with the program framework and consistent with the medium-term budgetary \nframework, and at least 1.03% of gross domestic product (GDP) allocated to primary education \nevery year. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n15.  The PEDP III is estimated to cost $8.3 billion, of which ADB will provide $320 million \nequivalent (Table 1) as part of the pooled financing from government and development partners.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem           Amount \nA.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR202,212,000 from ADB\u2018s Special Funds resources to help finance part of the PEDP III. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the loan agreement between the government and ADB. The ADB loan is \n3.84%  of  the  PEDP  III  cost  and  will  be  used  to  finance  eligible  expenditures,  including \ndevelopment and non development, under the government\u2018s PBH. The ADB loan proceeds may \nbe  used  to  finance  taxes  and  duties.  These  are  considered  reasonable,  transparent,  and \nnondiscriminatory. ADB will also finance recurrent expenditures. \n17.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The project is expected to be cofinanced by eight other \ndevelopment partners for a total of $735.5 million, including a $300 million loan from the World \nBank and $435.5 million equivalent in grants from other development partners.

Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The MOPME will be the executing agency and the DPE will be the key implementing \nagency. The MOPME will lead overall coordination of the PEDP III. An interministerial program \nsteering committee (PSC) will be established, chaired by the secretary of MOPME. Comprising \nrepresentatives of key ministries and civil society, the PSC will oversee the PEDP III policy \nimplementation, review program progress, approve the annual budget, ensure timely decisions \nin critical interministerial policy and implementation issues, and provide operational guidance. \nThe PSC will be supported by a program surveillance unit (PSU), headed by the MOPME \nadditional secretary, and a program support office. The PSU will promote collaboration and \ncoordination across ministry level agencies, work as a focal point for development partner \nsupport, organize joint review meetings, and mobilize TA support to concerned agencies. The \nprogram support office within the PSU will serve as the secretariat of the PSC, will promote \nregular  communication  and  coordination  with  relevant  ministries,  and  present  a  summary \nprogress report of project implementation to the PSC. The Ministry of Finance will ensure \nsmooth fund flow, budget, and fund appropriation. \n19.  The DPE will (i) formulate guidelines and plans; and (ii) implement, supervise, and \nmonitor the PEDP III through field level agencies. The DPE will be restructured into eight \ndivisions  from  the  existing  six,  with  additional  personnel.  A  position  for  additional  director \ngeneral will be established to support the DPE director general.  The DPE will realign job \ndescriptions within each existing division to ensure clear roles and responsibilities, and to \nmainstream project implementation through the regular system. A technical committee headed \n ", "6 \n \nby the director general of DPE will help coordinate different agencies at the operational level.7 \nTargeted TA based on needs assessment will be provided to strengthen capacity for effective \nimplementation of the PEDP III. For implementation of specific parts of the PEDP III, other \nexisting  agencies  at  the  national  level  will  continue  to  be  responsible.  Detailed  project \nmanagement arrangements are set forth in the project administration manual (PAM).8  \n20.  Procurement arrangements. The ADB loan proceeds will be used to finance goods, \nworks,  and  related  services  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  Such \nprocurement will follow the government\u2018s Public Procurement Act, 2006 and Public Procurement \nRules, 2008, with modifications and/or clarifications to the procedures agreed between the \ngovernment, ADB, and other development partners, as set out in the PAM and procurement \nplan, acceptable to ADB, and in accordance with ADB\u2018s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time). Aside from ADB, other development partners will jointly finance \ngoods, works, and related services procured using NCB. ADB will not finance any goods and \nworks that will be procured using international competitive bidding as this will follow World Bank \nguidelines. All consulting services will be engaged using  ADB\u2018s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The World Bank will not finance consulting \nservices. \n21.  Considering  the  joint  nature  of  the  financing  and  the  eligibility  policies  of  other \ndevelopment partners, in particular the World Bank, the procurement process for goods, works \nand services using NCB will need to be open to firms, contractors, and materials from any \ncountry  eligible  under  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  Accordingly,  ADB\u2018s  Board  of \nDirectors\u2018 waiver of member country procurement eligibility restrictions is sought to permit the \nparticipation of bidders from non-ADB member countries and/or procurement of goods and \nservices, including consulting services, from non-ADB member countries.  \n22.  Disbursement  conditions  and  arrangements.  Funds  will  flow  from  ADB  to  the \ngovernment  consolidated  funds  based  on  withdrawal  applications  submitted  by  the  DPE. \nExpenditures will be made from the treasury via accounting offices under the controller general \nof accounts system on the basis of the approved PEDP III\u2018s annual budget. The statement of \nexpenditure  (SOE) format  will  be  based  on  semiannual  interim  unaudited financial  reports \n(IFRs), which will be used for harmonized financial reporting and reimbursement.9 The IFRs will \nreflect eligible expenditures covering procurable (works, goods) and non-procurable (salaries, \ngrants) items. \n    \n \n23.  ADB will reimburse the government every 6 months in accordance with the following \nagreed arrangements: (i) 50% on achievement of nine annual DLIs that will be priced equally, \nand receipt of SOE, and (ii) 50% on receipt of SOE and submission of agreed reports. SOEs or \nIFRs generated by the government\u2018s integrated budget and accounting system (iBAS) every 6 \nmonths should indicate that eligible expenditures under the PBH exceed the total contributions \nto be made by the development partners for the same period. The agreed reports will enable \nADB to assess sector and program performance; verify evidence of DLI achievement and \nexpenditures; and assess compliance with procurement, financial management, and social and \nenvironmental safeguard requirements. The first reimbursement is subject to receipt of SOE for \nthe period from 1 July 2011 to the loan effective date, and achievement of DLIs for FY2011.  \n24.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial  7\n \n25.  Economic viability. The economic analysis for the project assesses the benefits and \ncosts associated with the PEDP III, whereby the project investment is the estimated additional \ncost over and above the currently run PEDP II spending. The benefits are those changes in the \nquantity, quality, and reduction in internal inefficiency of education produced over the period as \na result of the PEDP III. Benefits come from three sources: (i) increased number of primary \nschool completers who earn higher wages (relative to non-completers), (ii) increased quality of \neducation  resulting  in  a  higher  wage-premium  for  all  primary  school  completers,  and \n(iii) decreased wastage of public and private resources as a result of reduced dropouts and \nrepetitions. Costs include additional program costs (from government and development partner \nsources) and private costs that comprise direct household outlays as well as opportunity costs. \nThe PEDP III is expected to implement a wide range of demand- and supply-side interventions \nto improve access, equity, and efficiency. At the same time, it aims at enhancing the quality of \nschooling through improved student, school, and teacher-level subprograms as well as some \noverriding policy and institutional reforms. The internal rate of return associated with this net \npresent value is 24% for a 5-year program, which suggests that the PEDP III is expected to be a \nvery sound investment. \n26.  Fiscal sustainability. The long-term sustainability of the PEDP III will depend on two \nfactors: (i) adequate budget to the MOPME to cover estimated investments as per the fiscal \nprojection  for  GDP  growth  scenarios,  and  (ii)  improvements  in  quality  and  efficiency  as \nenvisaged. The NEP proposes a significant increase in government budget allocation to the \neducation sector (up to 6% of GDP from 2.3% in 2010-2011), confirming the urgency to ensure \nhigher allocations to the education sector. Given the positive outlook for GDP growth, the NEP\u2018s \ncall for a higher allocation, and a minimum allocation of 1.03% of GDP to the MOPME budget \n ", "8 \n \nagreed and reflected as a DLI, the Ministry of Finance has agreed to allocate $8.3 billion to the \nPEDP III. It is expected that (i) the PEDP III will fully absorb the incremental costs from the \nPEDP II; (ii) the projected incremental costs from the PEDP III (annual recurrent, short cyclical \ninvestments in areas such as curriculum reform, and long-term capital investment) will be \nsustained beyond the PEDP III life within the regular government system that the PEDP III is \nemphasizing; and (iii) reliance on external financing is likely to diminish if the systemic reforms, \nefficiency gains, and budget allocations are realized as envisaged. The PEDP III brings two \nmajor  synergies:  (i) without  development  partners\u2018  funds,  government  funds  would  be \ninadequate  to  address  quality  and  efficiency  improvements;  and  (ii) in  case  of  a  revenue \nshortfall, the government would be able to continue providing resources for the PEDP III\u2014in \norder not to lose development partners\u2018 funds to sustain priority reforms.   \nB.  Governance  \n27.  Financial  due  diligence  work  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2018s  Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects10 and  Financial  Due  Diligence  Methodology  Note.11 \nAssessment of the public financial management (PFM) system focused on the government\u2018s \nregular PFM system as well as the capacity of the MOPME and/or DPE to manage and account \nfor public funds, using the PEDP II as a point of departure. While the assessments clearly \nprovide evidence that parallel systems for development partners\u2018 fund management carry higher \nfiduciary risks, the government treasury system carries risks within MOPME and/or DPE in \nmanaging  funds  and  accounting  for  program  expenditures.  A  PFM  action  plan,  including \nfinancial management and procurement, has been developed to address these and other risks \nconsidered critical for reports generated from the integrated budget and accounting system to \ngive adequate assurance as to how funds for the PEDP III are spent. Annual fiduciary review, \nwhich includes risk assessment and post-procurement audit and quarterly fiduciary review, will \nhelp  identify  and  improve  government  capacity  to  manage  associated  risks.  ADB\u2018s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment, MOPME, and DPE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM.  \nC.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Positive effects of public investment in education and health, and NGOs\u2018 contribution in \neconomic and social empowerment activities, have contributed to significant improvement in \npoverty reduction in the 1990s and 2000s. Government subsidies of about 56% on primary \neducation benefit the poor\u2014about 50% of the population\u2014but this is inadequate since poor \nsegments  of  the  population  are  systematically  lagging  in  enrolment  and  primary  cycle \ncompletion. They cannot afford the (direct and indirect) expenses of primary schooling. The 6% \nof school-age children not yet enrolled in primary education are children from extremely poor \nfamilies, children from women-headed households, working children, street children, children \nwith  special  needs,  children  from  minority  ethnic  and  language  groups,  and  children  from \nremote or inaccessible areas. Building on PEDP II experience, the PEDP III has harmonized the \nstrategies and action plans developed for tribal, vulnerable, and special needs children, and \ngender, under the inclusive education action plan. This will support expansion of a conditional \nstipend  program,  supply  of  free  textbooks,  tuition  waivers,  expansion  of  the  school  meal \nprogram, provision of second chance education, inclusive education, and quality improvements. \n29.  Gender  and  development.  The  PEDP  II  has  contributed  to  Bangladesh  achieving \ngender equity in primary school enrollment, retention, and in teacher recruitment in government \nprimary schools. However, efforts are needed to promote women\u2018s participation in other types of \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n11 ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence and Methodology Note. Manila.  \n ", "         9 \n \nschools and in education management. Girls\u2018 education as a means to women\u2018s empowerment \nis not widely shared yet. Early marriage is still prevalent in Bangladesh. Boys are withdrawn \nfrom school for employment and girls face serious obstacles in the form of low mobility because \nof insecurity and harassment, lack of hygienic sanitation, and low confidence. A gender equity \nframework (gender action plan),12 which is part of the inclusive education action plan, has been \ndeveloped  to  promote  gender  equity  by  ensuring  enrollment,  retention,  and  learning \nachievement of girls from all communities in schools.  \nD.  Safeguards \n30.  Environment.  The  project  is  environment  category  B.  A  common  harmonized \nenvironmental management framework has been prepared. The PEDP III, based on needs \nassessment and agreed criteria, will support construction of new schools and dormitories; repair \nand  maintenance  of  existing  schools;  and  provision  of  safe  drinking  water,  sanitation  and \ndrainage facilities. With adequate arrangements for site selection, design, construction, and \noperation and maintenance, the PEDP III is not expected to create any significant or long-term \nadverse  environmental  impact.  Consistent  with  government  and  ADB  policy,  the  Local \nGovernment  and  Engineering  Department  will  monitor  implementation  of  the  environment \nmanagement  framework  semiannually.  The  department  has  the  capacity  to  implement  the \nframework. It will prepare and disclose periodic monitoring reports that describe progress on \nimplementation of the framework, and compliance issues and corrective actions, if any.   \n31.  Resettlement. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement. Social safeguard  A\np\nissues  may  arise  from  the  extension  of  existing  and  creation  of  new  physical  facilities.  p\ne\nBangladesh\u2018s schools are generally established on designated government-owned land, free  n\nd\nfrom  other  temporary  or  permanent  use.  The  PEDP II  did  not  trigger  the  Involuntary  ix 2\n \nResettlement Policy (1995) because beneficiary communities provided lands, where needed. \nUnder the PEDP III, local communities are expected to continue to contribute land. Consistent \nwith government and ADB policy, a harmonized resettlement framework has been prepared\u2014 9\n \ncovering  school  selection  guidelines;  guidelines  for  obtaining  different  types  of  land; \ncompensation  principles  and  standards;  monitoring  and  reporting;  and  consultation, \nparticipation, and disclosure. \n32.  Indigenous people. The project is category B for indigenous people. Three districts\u2014\nBandarban, Rangamati, and Khagrachari\u2014of Chittagong Hill Tracts are home to the largest \nproportion of the country\u2018s small indigenous population. The rest are dispersed in the plains \ndistricts of greater Sylhet, Mymensingh, and the north and southwest regions, where they \ngenerally live in isolated settlements among the mainstream population. Under the PEDP II, a \nplan for expanding education of tribal children was developed for extension and rehabilitation of \nexisting government schools for out-of-school children; capacity building of indigenous/tribal \ninstitutions; social mobilization to motivate parents to send children to school; supplementary \nreading materials development in indigenous language; and recruitment and training of teachers \nin the hill tracts. Building on this experience, a harmonized indigenous peoples plan consistent \nwith government and ADB policies has been prepared, to ensure that program activities in \ngeneral and physical works in particular do not adversely affect indigenous peoples, and that \nthey receive culturally compatible social and economic benefits.  \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Among  the  key  program  implementation  risks  and  mitigating  measures,  four  are \nsummarized  here.  The  first  relates  to  inadequate  institutional  and  personnel  capacity  to \nmanage,  implement,  and  monitor  the  PEDP  III.  The  project  emphasizes  institutional \n                                                \n12 The Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nstrengthening and human resource development. Partnership arrangements with government \norganizations, NGOs, and the private sector are planned. Slippage in meeting the DLIs is the \nsecond risk. A TA will be included to target DLI areas needing support along with realistic \ncommitment  from  the  government.  The  third  risk  relates  to  fiduciary  risks  associated  with \nprocurement  and  financial  management.  The  project  includes  a  quarterly  and  an  annual \nfiduciary review by ADB and the World Bank in close consultation with other development \npartners. Representative(s) from the civil society will be on the PSC and will be invited during \nthe joint annual reviews of the PEDP III. The DPE will establish a PEDP III website to ensure \ntimely  public  disclosure  of  key  documents  endorsed  by  the  government  for  updating  key \ninformation and progress on the PEDP III. The fourth risk is limited experience of the regular \ntreasury system in implementing development programs. To mitigate this risk, orientation of the \nPEDP III implementation procedures with detailed implementation and operations manual and \ntargeted high quality regular monitoring is planned with TA support to strengthen the regular \nsystem by building on the PEDP II. \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n34.  The government, MOPME, and DPE have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall confirm to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. The government, \nMOPME, and DPE have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set \nforth in the loan agreement. \n \n35.  Before the loan can be declared effective, the joint financing arrangement will have to be \nsigned by the government and ADB and at least one other development partner. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.
