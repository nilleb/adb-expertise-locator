The  project  will  contribute  to  the  government\u2018s  5-year  (FY2012\u2013FY2016)  Third \nPrimary  Education  Development  Program  (PEDP  III)  covering  1  year  of  preprimary  education \n(PPE)  and  5  years  of  primary  education.  Together  with  eight  other  development  partners,  the \nproject  will  support  the  government\u2018s  priorities  of  improving  student  learning  outcomes  and \ncompletion rates, and reducing disparities across regions. PEDP III will focus on achieving key \noutput  results  and  other  implementation  steps  to  policy  and  institutional  changes  that  are \nessential to meet the government\u2018s objective of providing quality education for all children.2   \n\nA. \n\nRationale  \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n1. \n\nRationale for the Project \n\n \n \n3. \nBangladesh  has  one  of  the  largest  primary  school  systems  in  the  world,  with  over \n16 million  children  enrolled  in  over  80,000  primary  schools.  Considerable  progress  has  been \nmade in improving access to free and compulsory primary education. Gross enrollment rates in \nprimary  education  improved  from  93.7%  in  2005  to  103.5%  in  2009,  and  net  enrollment  rates \nimproved  from  87.2%  in  2005  to  93.9%  in  2009.  Bangladesh  was  one  of  the  few  countries  to \nachieve gender parity up to the secondary level by 2005. Despite significant progress in access \nto  education,  high  inefficiencies  persist\u2014high  student  dropout  and  repetition  rates,  low \ncompletion,  and  high  student  and  teacher  absenteeism.  Two  rounds  of  national  student \nassessment indicate low student achievements in grades 3 and 5, but the results are improving.   \n \nThe  government  prepared  the  National  Education  Policy  (NEP)  to  address  the  above \n4. \nsystemic issues in primary education.3 The NEP plans to (i) achieve education for all by 2015, \nand  (ii)  ensure  that  every  child  starts  primary  school  by  2011.  The  NEP  aims  at  reducing \ndisparities between different types of schools, and expanding and improving primary education \nin disadvantaged locations in rural communities and urban slums. The major benefits foreseen \nare reduced repetition and dropout, improved completion rates, enhanced net enrolment rates, \nand  improved  transition  rates  to  secondary  education\u2014all  as  a  result  of  improved  quality  and \nrelevance of education in schools with initial input deficits. \n   \n5. \nThe ongoing PEDP II is jointly funded by the government and 11 development partners; \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  the  lead  development  partner.4 The  PEDP  II  largely \ncontributed  to  improving  primary  education  participation  and  introducing  key  reforms.  It  has \nachieved  (i)  mainstreaming  minimum  service  standards  across  government  administered \nprimary  schools through  the  primary  school quality  level  standards;  (ii)  a fair,  transparent,  and \nefficient  teacher  recruitment  system  for  government  primary  schools;  (iii)  the  introduction  of \nresults-based  management  (RBM),  which  has  led  to  the  publication  of  the  annual  sector \nperformance  report  that  helps  monitor  progress  on  key  performance  indicators  and  primary \nschool  quality  level  standards;  (iv)  initiation  of  the  school  level  improvement  plans  (SLIPs)  to \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Education Development Program. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n \n\nsupport  decentralized  planning,  and  SLIPs  include  school  grants  to  address  the  needs  of \nparticipating  schools;  and  (v)  introduction  of  the  annual  grade  5  completion  examination  and \nimplementation of the national student assessment every alternate year to assess progress on \nstudent achievements in grades 3 and 5. The PEDP II has also established a strong foundation \nfor  a  SWAp  by  bringing  the  government  and  development  partners  together  for  the  first  time \nunder  one  program  instead  of  separate  projects  funded  by  different  development  partners. \nLessons  identified  from  the  PEDP  II  and  those  from  the  sector  assistance  performance \nevaluation5 are available in Appendix 2.6  \n \n6. \nThe  PEDP  III,  which  the  project  will  support,  will  build  on  the  PEDP  II  achievement, \nlessons  identified,  and  joint  experience  of  the  government  and  development  partners.  It  will \n(i) broaden the scope to include 1 year preprimary, and nonformal and second chance primary \neducation; (ii) deepen quality improvement through improved teaching and learning practices in \nthe classroom, including improved assessment; (iii) enhance school governance, accountability, \nand  community  mobilization;  (iv)  provide  targeted  support  to  disadvantaged  groups  and \nlocations;  (v)  institutionalize  human  resource  development  to  incentivize  the  system  and \nenhance  capacity;  (vi)  deepen  and  institutionalize  an  RBM  and  monitoring  mechanism  at  all \nlevels; (vii) target and ensure effective utilization of technical assistance (TA) at all levels within \nan  emerging  decentralization \nframework;  and  (viii)  enhance  subsector  management, \ncoordination, and greater alignment with the country system.  \n \n7. \nThe  project  will  support  the  PEDP  III  with  a  project  lending  modality  since  (i) the \ninterventions  are  more  of  an  investment  nature  and  incremental  steps  toward  reforms,  rather \nthan structural policy reforms; and (ii) there is a need to ensure close oversight of the fiduciary \nenvironment,  so  it  is  not  suitable  for  the  use  of  program  lending.  However,  to  align  with  the \nsalient  features  of  the  PEDP  III  under  a  SWAp,  the  project  has  incorporated  some  innovative \nfeatures. \n \n\nKey Innovative Features of the Project  \n\n2. \nThe project has three innovative features that are explained in detail in Appendix 2.6  \n\n8. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nGreater  focus  on  results.  The  project  will  link  financing  to  the  government \nachieving  nine  annual  disbursement  linked  indicators  (DLIs)\u2500output  level  results \nand  implementation  steps  to  policy  and  institutional  changes  that  are  deemed \nessential  to  meet  the  project\u2018s  objectives.  The  use  of  DLIs  will  help  Project \ninterventions move from a focus on activities to a broader program approach that \nfocuses  on  results.  It  will  also  help  strengthen  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem and the government\u2018s capacity in results monitoring and reporting.  \n\nAlignment with government system. The fiduciary risk assessment undertaken \nduring  project  preparation  suggested  ADB  and  the  development  partners  to  use \nthe  government\u2018s  treasury  system  for  disbursement  and  financial  management. \nThe  ADB  loan  and  development  partners\u2018  funds  will  be  channeled  to  the \ngovernment\u2018s  treasury  to  finance  PEDP  III  eligible  expenditures,  included  under \ncertain  program  budget heads  (PBHs)  in  the government\u2018s chart  of accounts,  as \nagreed  between  the  government  and  the  development  partners.  The  PBHs  will \ninclude  total  subsector  expenditures  that  contribute  to  PEDP  III  outcomes,  with \nsome  exceptions,  and  will  comprise  both  development  and  nondevelopment \nexpenditures.  \n\n                                                \n5 ADB.  2008.

Greater  alignment  with  the \ngovernment system enhances harmonization among development partners. The \ngovernment and development partners will sign a joint financing arrangement that \nsets  forth  the  jointly  agreed  terms  and  procedures  for  partners\u2018  support  to  the \nPEDP III.  \n\n(iv) \n\nDevelopment  partners  have  enhanced  delegated  cooperation  in  key  areas  of \nmonitoring  and  oversight,  including  joint  fiduciary  oversight  of  PEDP  III  by  ADB \nand the World Bank.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs  \n\n9. \nThe impact of the PEDP III will be quality education for all children. The outcome of the \nPEDP  III  is  an  efficient,  inclusive,  and  equitable  primary  education  system  delivering  effective \nand  relevant  child-friendly  learning  to  all  of  Bangladesh\u2018s  children  from  preprimary  through \ngrade 5. As the project is to support the PEDP III, the project\u2018s expected impact and outcome \nwill be consistent with the impact and outcome of the PEDP III.  \n \nC. \n \n10. \n The  four  interrelated  broad  results  areas  or  outputs  are  (i)  improved  teaching  and \nlearning for all, (ii) reduced disparities and universal access and participation, (iii) decentralized \nand effective organization of the primary education system, and (iv) improved program planning \nand management. The nine DLIs are represented across the four results areas. \n \nOutput 1: Improved teaching and learning for all. Output 1 will support (i) initiatives to \n11. \nenhance the performance of all children, (ii) school and classroom based assessment to ensure \nmonitoring  and  feedback  on  every  child\u2018s  learning  outcomes,  (iii)  initiatives  to  strengthen  the \ncurriculum and textbooks based on revised competencies, (iv) timely production and distribution \nof quality textbooks to all eligible children, (v) gradual access to information and communication \ntechnology in education to enhance teaching and learning, and (vi) activities to improve teacher \neducation  and  development  to  ensure  that  every  child  learns.  The  output  includes  two  DLIs: \n(i) textbooks  for  each  subject  produced  and  distributed  to  eligible  schools  within  a  month  of \nopening  day,  and  (ii) a  complete  teacher  development  plan  prepared  and  adopted  by  the \nMinistry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME) and the new diploma in education provided \nto 11,000 teachers annually.   \n \nOutput  2:  Reduced  disparities  (universal  access  and  participation).  Output  2  will \n12. \nsupport  (i)  second  chance  and  alternative  education  for  students  that  have  never  enrolled  or \nmay have dropped out from formal school; (ii) 1 year preprimary education to children at age 5 \nto prepare them for schooling, retention, and completion; (iii) mainstreaming inclusive education \nto address the needs in formal schools of tribal children, ethnic minorities, children with learning \ndisabilities, and disabled children; (iv) education in emergencies to prepare disaster-prone areas \nfor continuing schooling during emergencies; (v) developing and implementing a communication \nframework and action plan for a social change strategy; (vi) targeting stipends to encourage the \npoorest  families  to  enroll  and  retain  their  children  in  school;  (vii)  school  health  and  school \nfeeding to ensure the nutrition and good health of particularly needy children; (viii) an enhanced \nschool  physical  environment  based  on  actual  physical  conditions;  and  (ix)  needs-based \ninfrastructure  and  furniture  for  conducive  learning.  Two  DLIs  are  included  in  this  output:  (i) \nguidelines  for  preprimary  education  on  the  role  of  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nendorsed by the MOPME, and the coverage of preprimary education expanded; and (ii) needs-\nbased infrastructure implemented to achieve a pupil to usable classroom ratio of 56:1.  \n  \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n2\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nOutput  3:  Decentralized  and  effective  organization.

The government \nwill provide the equivalent of $7.3 billion.  \n\nSource \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n\nADB  \nDevelopment Partners  \nAusAID: $35 million, CIDA: $65 million, DFID: $190 million, EU: $70 million, JICA: \n$30 million, Sida: $45 million, World Bank\u2013IDA: $300 million, UNICEF: $0.50 million \nGovernment \n      Total \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AusAID  =  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  CIDA  =  Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency,  DFID  =  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom, \nEU = European  Union,  IDA  =  International  Development  Agency,  JICA  =  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency, \nSida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, UNICEF = United Nations Children\u2018s Fund. \nSources: Government\u2018s Third Primary Education Development Program document and ADB estimates. \n\n \n7,281.47 \n8,336.97 \n\n320.00 \n \n \n735.50 \n\n87.34 \n100.00 \n\n3.84 \n \n\n8.82    \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n18. \nThe  MOPME  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  DPE  will  be  the  key  implementing \nagency. The MOPME will lead overall coordination of the PEDP III. An interministerial program \nsteering committee (PSC) will be established, chaired by the secretary of MOPME. Comprising \nrepresentatives  of  key  ministries  and  civil  society,  the  PSC  will  oversee  the  PEDP III  policy \nimplementation, review program progress, approve the annual budget, ensure timely decisions \nin  critical  interministerial  policy  and  implementation  issues,  and  provide  operational  guidance. \nThe  PSC  will  be  supported  by  a  program  surveillance  unit  (PSU),  headed  by  the  MOPME \nadditional  secretary,  and  a  program  support  office.  The  PSU  will  promote  collaboration  and \ncoordination  across  ministry  level  agencies,  work  as  a  focal  point  for  development  partner \nsupport,  organize joint  review  meetings,  and  mobilize  TA  support  to  concerned  agencies.  The \nprogram  support  office  within  the  PSU  will  serve  as  the  secretariat  of  the  PSC,  will  promote \nregular  communication  and  coordination  with  relevant  ministries,  and  present  a  summary \nprogress  report  of  project  implementation  to  the  PSC.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  ensure \nsmooth fund flow, budget, and fund appropriation. \n\n19. \nThe  DPE  will  (i)  formulate  guidelines  and  plans;  and  (ii)  implement,  supervise,  and \nmonitor  the  PEDP  III  through  field  level  agencies.  The  DPE  will  be  restructured  into  eight \ndivisions  from  the  existing  six,  with  additional  personnel.  A  position  for  additional  director \ngeneral  will  be  established  to  support  the  DPE  director  general.  The  DPE  will  realign  job \ndescriptions  within  each  existing  division  to  ensure  clear  roles  and  responsibilities,  and  to \nmainstream project implementation through the regular system. A technical committee headed \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n2\n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\n \n\nby the director general of DPE will help coordinate different agencies at the operational level.7 \nTargeted TA  based  on needs  assessment  will  be  provided to strengthen  capacity for  effective \nimplementation  of  the  PEDP  III.  For  implementation  of  specific  parts  of  the  PEDP  III,  other \nexisting  agencies  at  the  national  level  will  continue  to  be  responsible.  Detailed  project \nmanagement arrangements are set forth in the project administration manual (PAM).8  \n\n20. \nProcurement  arrangements.  The  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  goods, \nworks,  and  related  services  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB).  Such \nprocurement will follow the government\u2018s Public Procurement Act, 2006 and Public Procurement \nRules,  2008,  with  modifications  and/or  clarifications  to  the  procedures  agreed  between  the \ngovernment,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners,  as  set  out  in  the  PAM  and  procurement \nplan,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2018s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Aside  from  ADB,  other  development  partners  will  jointly  finance \ngoods,  works,  and  related  services  procured  using  NCB.  ADB  will  not  finance  any  goods  and \nworks that will be procured using international competitive bidding as this will follow World Bank \nguidelines.  All  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  using  ADB\u2018s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The World Bank will not finance consulting \nservices. \n\n21. \nConsidering  the  joint  nature  of  the  financing  and  the  eligibility  policies  of  other \ndevelopment partners, in particular the World Bank, the procurement process for goods, works \nand  services  using  NCB  will  need  to  be  open  to  firms,  contractors,  and  materials  from  any \ncountry  eligible  under  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  Accordingly,  ADB\u2018s  Board  of \nDirectors\u2018  waiver  of  member  country  procurement  eligibility  restrictions  is  sought  to  permit  the \nparticipation  of  bidders  from  non-ADB  member  countries  and/or  procurement  of  goods  and \nservices, including consulting services, from non-ADB member countries.  \n\n22. \nDisbursement  conditions  and  arrangements.  Funds  will  flow  from  ADB  to  the \ngovernment  consolidated  funds  based  on  withdrawal  applications  submitted  by  the  DPE. \nExpenditures will be made from the treasury via accounting offices under the controller general \nof  accounts  system  on  the  basis  of  the  approved  PEDP  III\u2018s  annual  budget.  The  statement  of \nexpenditure  (SOE)  format  will  be  based  on  semiannual  interim  unaudited  financial  reports \n(IFRs), which will be used for harmonized financial reporting and reimbursement.9 The IFRs will \nreflect  eligible  expenditures  covering  procurable  (works,  goods)  and  non-procurable  (salaries, \ngrants) items. \n     \n23. \nADB  will  reimburse  the  government  every  6  months  in  accordance  with  the  following \nagreed  arrangements: (i) 50%  on  achievement  of  nine  annual  DLIs that will  be  priced  equally, \nand receipt of SOE, and (ii) 50% on receipt of SOE and submission of agreed reports. SOEs or \nIFRs generated by the government\u2018s integrated budget and accounting system (iBAS) every 6 \nmonths should indicate that eligible expenditures under the PBH exceed the total contributions \nto  be  made  by  the  development  partners  for  the  same  period.  The  agreed  reports  will  enable \nADB  to  assess  sector  and  program  performance;  verify  evidence  of  DLI  achievement  and \nexpenditures; and assess compliance with procurement, financial management, and social and \nenvironmental safeguard requirements. The first reimbursement is subject to receipt of SOE for \nthe period from 1 July 2011 to the loan effective date, and achievement of DLIs for FY2011.  \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \n\n24. \nthe PAM, which includes an indicative procurement plan. \n  \n                                                \n7  The  agencies  include  Bureau  of  Non  Formal  Education,  National  Academy  for  Primary  Education,  Local \n\nGovernment Engineering Department, and National Curriculum and Textbook Board. \n\n8  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9 The Statement of Expenditure format (accessible from the list of linked documents is in Appendix 2). \n\n\fAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)   Key implementing \n\nagencies \n\n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\nAdvance contracting and \nRetroactive financing \nDisbursement  \n\n         7 \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nJuly 2011\u2014June 2016 \n30 June 2016 \n\nProgram steering committee chaired by the secretary of MOPME, supported by the \nprogram support unit and program support office. \nMOPME \nDirectorate of Primary Education  \n\nNo  separate  project  implementation  unit  will  be  established.

The  economic  analysis  for  the  project  assesses  the  benefits  and \n25. \ncosts associated with the PEDP III, whereby the project investment is the estimated additional \ncost over and above the currently run PEDP II spending. The benefits are those changes in the \nquantity, quality, and reduction in internal inefficiency of education produced over the period as \na  result  of  the  PEDP  III.  Benefits  come  from  three  sources:  (i) increased  number  of  primary \nschool completers who earn higher wages (relative to non-completers), (ii) increased quality of \neducation  resulting  in  a  higher  wage-premium  for  all  primary  school  completers,  and \n(iii) decreased  wastage  of  public  and  private  resources  as  a  result  of  reduced  dropouts  and \nrepetitions. Costs include additional program costs (from government and development partner \nsources) and private costs that comprise direct household outlays as well as opportunity costs. \nThe PEDP III is expected to implement a wide range of demand- and supply-side interventions \nto improve access, equity, and efficiency. At the same time, it aims at enhancing the quality of \nschooling  through  improved  student,  school,  and  teacher-level  subprograms  as  well  as  some \noverriding  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  The  internal  rate  of  return  associated  with  this  net \npresent value is 24% for a 5-year program, which suggests that the PEDP III is expected to be a \nvery sound investment. \n\n26. \nFiscal  sustainability.  The  long-term  sustainability  of  the  PEDP  III  will  depend  on  two \nfactors:  (i)  adequate  budget  to  the  MOPME  to  cover  estimated  investments  as  per  the  fiscal \nprojection  for  GDP  growth  scenarios,  and  (ii)  improvements  in  quality  and  efficiency  as \nenvisaged.  The  NEP  proposes  a  significant  increase  in  government  budget  allocation  to  the \neducation sector (up to 6% of GDP from 2.3% in 2010-2011), confirming the urgency to ensure \nhigher allocations to the education sector. Given the positive outlook for GDP growth, the NEP\u2018s \ncall for a higher allocation, and a minimum allocation of 1.03% of GDP to  the MOPME budget \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n2\n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n \n\nagreed and reflected as a DLI, the Ministry of Finance has agreed to allocate $8.3 billion to the \nPEDP  III.  It  is  expected  that  (i)  the  PEDP  III  will  fully  absorb  the  incremental  costs  from  the \nPEDP II; (ii) the projected incremental costs from the PEDP III (annual recurrent, short cyclical \ninvestments  in  areas  such  as  curriculum  reform,  and  long-term  capital  investment)  will  be \nsustained  beyond  the  PEDP  III  life  within  the  regular  government  system  that  the  PEDP  III  is \nemphasizing; and (iii) reliance on external financing is likely to diminish if the systemic reforms, \nefficiency  gains,  and  budget  allocations  are  realized  as  envisaged.  The  PEDP  III  brings  two \nmajor  synergies:  (i) without  development  partners\u2018  funds,  government  funds  would  be \ninadequate  to  address  quality  and  efficiency  improvements;  and  (ii) in  case  of  a  revenue \nshortfall,  the  government  would  be  able  to  continue  providing  resources  for  the  PEDP  III\u2014in \norder not to lose development partners\u2018 funds to sustain priority reforms.   \n\nB. \n\nGovernance  \n\n27. \nFinancial  due  diligence  work  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2018s  Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects 10  and  Financial  Due  Diligence  Methodology  Note. 11 \nAssessment  of  the  public  financial  management  (PFM)  system  focused  on  the  government\u2018s \nregular PFM system as well as the capacity of the MOPME and/or DPE to manage and account \nfor  public  funds,  using  the  PEDP  II  as  a  point  of  departure.  While  the  assessments  clearly \nprovide evidence that parallel systems for development partners\u2018 fund management carry higher \nfiduciary  risks,  the  government  treasury  system  carries  risks  within  MOPME  and/or  DPE  in \nmanaging  funds  and  accounting  for  program  expenditures.  A  PFM  action  plan,  including \nfinancial management and procurement, has been developed to address these and other risks \nconsidered  critical  for  reports  generated  from  the  integrated  budget  and  accounting  system  to \ngive adequate assurance as to how funds for  the PEDP III are spent. Annual fiduciary review, \nwhich includes risk assessment and post-procurement audit and quarterly fiduciary review, will \nhelp \nto  manage  associated  risks.  ADB\u2018s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \ngovernment, MOPME, and DPE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM.  \n\nimprove  government  capacity \n\nidentify  and \n\nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPositive effects of public investment in education and health, and NGOs\u2018 contribution in \n28. \neconomic  and  social  empowerment  activities,  have  contributed  to  significant  improvement  in \npoverty  reduction  in  the  1990s  and  2000s.  Government  subsidies  of  about  56%  on  primary \neducation  benefit  the  poor\u2014about  50%  of  the  population\u2014but  this  is  inadequate  since  poor \nsegments  of  the  population  are  systematically  lagging  in  enrolment  and  primary  cycle \ncompletion. They cannot afford the (direct and indirect) expenses of primary schooling. The 6% \nof  school-age  children  not  yet  enrolled  in  primary  education  are  children  from  extremely  poor \nfamilies,  children  from  women-headed  households,  working  children,  street  children,  children \nwith  special  needs,  children  from  minority  ethnic  and  language  groups,  and  children  from \nremote or inaccessible areas. Building on PEDP II experience, the PEDP III has harmonized the \nstrategies  and  action  plans  developed  for  tribal,  vulnerable,  and  special  needs  children,  and \ngender,  under the  inclusive education  action  plan. This  will  support  expansion  of  a  conditional \nstipend  program,  supply  of  free  textbooks,  tuition  waivers,  expansion  of  the  school  meal \nprogram, provision of second chance education, inclusive education, and quality improvements. \n\n29. \nGender  and  development.  The  PEDP  II  has  contributed  to  Bangladesh  achieving \ngender equity in primary school enrollment, retention, and in teacher recruitment in government \nprimary schools. However, efforts are needed to promote women\u2018s participation in other types of \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

Girls\u2018 education as a means to women\u2018s empowerment \nis  not  widely  shared  yet.  Early  marriage  is  still  prevalent  in  Bangladesh.  Boys  are  withdrawn \nfrom school for employment and girls face serious obstacles in the form of low mobility because \nof insecurity and harassment, lack of hygienic sanitation, and low confidence. A gender equity \nframework (gender action plan),12 which is part of the inclusive education action plan, has been \ndeveloped \nlearning \nto  promote  gender  equity  by  ensuring  enrollment,  retention,  and \nachievement of girls from all communities in schools.  \n\nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n30. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  environment  category  B.  A  common  harmonized \nenvironmental  management  framework  has  been  prepared.  The  PEDP  III,  based  on  needs \nassessment and agreed criteria, will support construction of new schools and dormitories; repair \nand  maintenance  of  existing  schools;  and  provision  of  safe  drinking  water,  sanitation  and \ndrainage  facilities.  With  adequate  arrangements  for  site  selection,  design,  construction,  and \noperation and maintenance, the PEDP III is not expected to create any significant or long-term \nadverse  environmental  impact.  Consistent  with  government  and  ADB  policy,  the  Local \nGovernment  and  Engineering  Department  will  monitor  implementation  of  the  environment \nmanagement  framework  semiannually.  The  department  has  the  capacity  to  implement  the \nframework.  It  will  prepare  and  disclose  periodic  monitoring  reports  that  describe  progress  on \nimplementation of the framework, and compliance issues and corrective actions, if any.   \n\n31. \nResettlement.  The  project  is  category  B for  involuntary  resettlement.  Social  safeguard \nissues  may  arise  from  the  extension  of  existing  and  creation  of  new  physical  facilities. \nBangladesh\u2018s  schools  are  generally  established  on  designated  government-owned  land,  free \nfrom  other  temporary  or  permanent  use.  The  PEDP II  did  not  trigger  the  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  because  beneficiary  communities  provided  lands,  where  needed. \nUnder the PEDP III, local communities  are expected to continue to contribute land. Consistent \nwith government  and  ADB  policy,  a  harmonized  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared\u2014\nland; \ncovering  school  selection  guidelines;  guidelines \ncompensation  principles  and  standards;  monitoring  and \nreporting;  and  consultation, \nparticipation, and disclosure. \n\nfor  obtaining  different \n\ntypes  of \n\nIndigenous  people.  The  project is category B for indigenous people.  Three districts\u2014\n32. \nBandarban,  Rangamati,  and  Khagrachari\u2014of  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  are  home  to  the  largest \nproportion  of  the  country\u2018s  small  indigenous  population.  The  rest  are  dispersed  in  the  plains \ndistricts  of  greater  Sylhet,  Mymensingh,  and  the  north  and  southwest  regions,  where  they \ngenerally  live in isolated  settlements  among the mainstream  population. Under  the  PEDP II, a \nplan for expanding education of tribal children was developed for extension and rehabilitation of \nexisting  government  schools  for  out-of-school  children;  capacity  building  of  indigenous/tribal \ninstitutions;  social  mobilization  to  motivate  parents  to  send  children  to  school;  supplementary \nreading materials development in indigenous language; and recruitment and training of teachers \nin the hill tracts. Building on this experience, a harmonized indigenous peoples plan consistent \nwith  government  and  ADB  policies  has  been  prepared,  to  ensure  that  program  activities  in \ngeneral  and  physical  works  in  particular  do  not  adversely  affect  indigenous  peoples,  and  that \nthey receive culturally compatible social and economic benefits.  \n\nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n33. \nAmong  the  key  program  implementation  risks  and  mitigating  measures,  four  are \nsummarized  here.  The  first  relates  to  inadequate  institutional  and  personnel  capacity  to \ninstitutional \nmanage, \n\nIII.  The  project  emphasizes \n\nimplement,  and  monitor \n\nthe  PEDP \n\n                                                \n12 The Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n2\n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\fstrengthening  and  human  resource  development.  Partnership  arrangements  with  government \norganizations,  NGOs,  and  the  private  sector  are  planned.  Slippage  in meeting  the  DLIs  is  the \nsecond  risk.  A  TA  will  be  included  to  target  DLI  areas  needing  support  along  with  realistic \ncommitment  from  the  government.  The  third  risk  relates  to  fiduciary  risks  associated  with \nprocurement  and  financial  management.  The  project  includes  a  quarterly  and  an  annual \nfiduciary  review  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  in  close  consultation  with  other  development \npartners.  Representative(s) from  the  civil  society  will  be  on  the  PSC  and  will  be  invited  during \nthe joint  annual reviews  of the  PEDP  III.  The  DPE  will  establish a  PEDP III  website to  ensure \ntimely  public  disclosure  of  key  documents  endorsed  by  the  government  for  updating  key \ninformation  and  progress  on  the  PEDP  III.  The  fourth  risk  is  limited  experience  of  the  regular \ntreasury system in implementing development programs. To mitigate this risk, orientation of the \nPEDP  III  implementation  procedures  with  detailed  implementation  and  operations  manual  and \ntargeted  high  quality  regular  monitoring  is  planned  with  TA  support  to  strengthen  the  regular \nsystem by building on the PEDP II. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe  government,  MOPME,  and  DPE  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \n34. \nproject  shall  confirm  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents.
