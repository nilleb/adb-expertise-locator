THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Tourism Infrastructure \nfor Inclusive Growth Project.1 This is one of three complementary projects for the participating \nGMS countries; the others will be in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam.2 \n \n2.  The project will remove physical and capacity constraints impeding tourism development \nin Kampot, Kep, and Koh Kong, three provinces situated in the GMS Southern Coastal Corridor. \nIt will contribute to inclusive economic growth in Cambodia by (i) creating about 17,000 tourism-\nrelated jobs, 60% of which will be held by women; (ii) paving 6.5 kilometers of rural roads and \nconstructing a marine ferry terminal to open new areas for tourism and improve access to \nmarkets and social services for about 12,000 residents; (iii) improving wastewater management \nin areas important for tourism to reduce public health hazards for 12,700 residents and 1.16 \nmillion annual visitors beginning in 2019; and (iv) facilitating business support services and \naccess to microfinance for at least 375 micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The project \nwill strengthen regional cooperation and integration by implementing regional tourism standards, \npromoting  multi-country  tour  circuits,  and  facilitating  policy  dialogue  to  reduce  nonphysical \nbarriers to travel. The project investment plan is in line with the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy, \n2005\u201320153 and Cambodia\u2019s Tourism Development Strategic Plan, 2012\u20132020.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Subregional context. Among country groupings in Asia and the Pacific, the GMS has a \nstrong comparative advantage in tourism as a result of its diverse cultural and natural assets, \ngood international air and land transport connectivity, and surging demand for intraregional \nleisure travel. International tourist arrivals are growing by 12.4% per year and reached an all-\ntime high of 44.8 million in 2012, generating $44.3 billion in receipts. Tourism sustains 7 million \njobs and creates significant positive economic spillovers in other sectors. About one-third of \ninternational arrivals visit at least two countries while travelling in the GMS, and millions of \nresidents cross borders for day trips. GMS countries are keen to strengthen subregional tourism \ncooperation and recently reaffirmed their commitment to promote cross-border tourism under \nthe GMS Economic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework, 2012\u20132022.5 Nevertheless, \nunderinvestment in public infrastructure beyond the major gateways holds back the expansion \nof private tourism enterprises and the dispersal of benefits to less-developed areas.6 \n \n4.  National priorities. Cambodia received 3.58 million international tourists in 2012, a 24% \nincrease compared with 2011 but only 8% of total GMS arrivals. Tourism directly contributes \n11.5% to gross domestic product and sustains 780,000 jobs (12.4% of total employment).7 The \ngovernment\u2019s Tourism Development Strategic Plan 2012\u20132020 is consistent with the GMS \nTourism  Sector  Strategy,  prioritizing  transport  and  urban  infrastructure  upgrades,  human \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Travel and Tourism Economic Impact 2013: Cambodia. London. ", "2     \nresource development, and policy enhancements to improve the business enabling environment \nfor tourism. The 2009 Law on Tourism provides the legal basis for the plan, directing the \nMinistry of Tourism (MOT) to lead development of a quality and sustainable tourism industry \nthat contributes to job creation and poverty reduction. Strategic objectives are to (i) diversify \ntourism products and services with a focus on the coastal zone and northeast, (ii) improve \ninternal  transportation  networks  and  regional  connectivity,  (iii)  enhance  marketing  and \npromotion,  and  (iv)  minimize  negative  tourism  impacts.  Targets  for  2020  are  7  million \ninternational arrivals, 10 million domestic trips, and $5 billion equivalent in tourism receipts. \n \n5.  Key issues. Although Cambodia has long stretches of pristine beaches, a protected \narea network covering 24% of the country, and widely dispersed cultural attractions with good \ndevelopment potential, tourism is highly concentrated in Siem Reap and the temples of Angkor, \nwhich account for 58% of international arrivals, 30% of hospitality investment, and the majority \nof  tour  operations.8 Women  comprise  about  60%  of  tourism  workers;  however,  many  are \nemployed  in  lower-skilled  jobs  paying  lower  wages,  and  women  are  underrepresented  in \ntourism management. The key impediments to more inclusive and geographically balanced \ngrowth are insufficient transport infrastructure in secondary destinations, weak market linkages \nbetween the tourism supply chain and other economic sectors, and limited institutional capacity \nto promote tourism-related enterprise development in lagging areas. Consequently, up to 40% \nof  tourism  receipts  leave  the  country  to  purchase  tourism-related  imports  such  as  food, \nsouvenirs, and manufactured goods, and as little as 11% of destination spending reaches the \npoor.9 Low service standards and inadequate environmental services also suppress tourist \nspending and length of stay, limiting average receipts per visitor to about $620\u2014less than half \nthe benchmark $1,390 in Asia and the Pacific.10 \n \n6.  To engender a more equitable pattern of tourism development, the project will develop \nan international marine passenger pier in Kampot to facilitate the movement of tourists into the \nsouthern coastal zone. This will establish a new gateway between southern Cambodia, Viet \nNam, and other destinations in the Gulf of Thailand, helping to unlock the area\u2019s clear potential \nfor tourism growth. Complementary project investments will improve wastewater management \nand sanitation in neighboring Kep province and strengthen the capacity of local entrepreneurs \nand destination management organizations.11 This integrated approach will catalyze additional \nprivate investment in tourism superstructure and services, and ensure that tourism growth is \nenvironmentally and socially sustainable.12 \n \n7.  Related  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s \nRectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Efficiency, Phase III, which aims to \naccelerate economic growth, create jobs, and reduce inequality. 13 Project outputs align with \nstrategic thrusts to (i) develop physical infrastructure in areas with high economic and tourism \npotential, (ii) promote private sector development and employment, and (iii) accelerate capacity \nbuilding  and  human  resource  development.  The  emphasis  on  improving  subregional \nconnectivity, improving the quality and coverage of environmental services, strengthening value \nchains, and creating jobs for unskilled and semiskilled workers supports the overarching aim of \n                                                \n8  Ministry of Tourism, Cambodia. 2012.

Development  coordination.  The  GMS  Tourism  Working  Group  is  the  forum  for \ncoordinating regional tourism sector assistance.15 Senior GMS tourism officials and ADB co-\nchair semiannual working group meetings to guide implementation of the GMS Tourism Sector \nStrategy and identify policy issues for elevation to the annual GMS tourism ministers meeting \nand the triennial GMS summit. In Cambodia, sector coordination is led by the MOT and Council \nfor the Development of Cambodia. Other development partners engaged in tourism are the \nGerman  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale \nZusammenarbeit,  the  Government  of  New  Zealand,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency,  and the Wildlife  Conservation  Society. The  Pacific  Asia Travel  Association  is  the \nleading industry group with over 1,100 members. \n \n9.  Lessons.  ADB\u2019s  GMS  tourism  sector  assistance  program  and  completed  tourism \nprojects in Cambodia are rated successful.16 Lessons from past projects include the need to (i) \nanalyze tourism demand in project areas to guide the selection of infrastructure investments, (ii) \nimprove cross-sector coordination and build synergies with other ADB assistance, (iii) provide \ncapacity building for project management and infrastructure operation and maintenance (O&M), \nand (iv) promote private enterprise development alongside infrastructure to expand income-\ngenerating opportunities for local residents. Applying these lessons, the project has selected \nrelevant infrastructure subprojects based on robust market analysis and complementarities with \nother  ADB  and  development  partner  assistance  for  urban  development,  water  supply  and \nsanitation, vocational training, and tourism.17 Capacity building for entities responsible for O&M \nand parallel support for micro and small enterprises that are mainly led by women will enhance \nthe sustainability of project outputs and ensure benefits reach vulnerable groups. The project \ndeliberately focuses on improving infrastructure and capacity to connect lower-income groups to \nmarkets,  and  enabling  lower-educated  residents  to  access salaried  employment  and  other \neconomic opportunities. \n \n10.  Special features. The project will (i) strengthen collaboration between the government, \nthe  private  sector,  civil  society,  and  local  communities  to  improve  tourism  destination \nmanagement;  (ii)  demonstrate  how  tourist  entry  fees  and  charges  can  help  finance  the \nmaintenance of public goods such as water transport terminals and wastewater treatment; (iii) \nstrengthen  knowledge  partnerships  among  GMS  and  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian \nNations members; and (iv) leverage service sector opportunities to accelerate widening of the \nGMS transport corridors into economic corridors by linking secondary tourism destinations with \nincreasingly affluent regional markets. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the project will be increased tourism employment for people living in \nunderdeveloped  segments  of  the  GMS  Southern  Coastal  Corridor.  The  outcome  will  be \nincreased tourism receipts in the three project provinces of Kampot, Kep, and Koh Kong. By \n2019, aggregate annual international tourism receipts in the three project provinces will increase \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2014.

All  consultants  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n19.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  based  on  previous  ADB  projects. 21 Policy \nguidance  and  oversight  will  be  provided  by  subregional,  national,  and  provincial  steering \ncommittees that will meet at least twice per year. Development partners and members of the \nGMS Tourism Working Group will join steering committee meetings to coordinate other tourism \nsector assistance. The MOT will be the executing agency and DOTs of the project provinces will \nbe the implementing agencies. Overall project coordination and regional cooperation activities \nwill be led by a project coordination unit (PCU) embedded in the MOT. The minister of tourism \nwill be Cambodia\u2019s representative to the subregional steering committee and chairperson of the \nnational  steering  committee.  DOTs  in  each  participating  province  will  establish  a  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) staffed with multidisciplinary teams to oversee day-to-day project \nimplementation.  PIUs  will  report  to  provincial  vice-governors  and  the  PCU,  which  will \nconsolidate  quarterly  project  progress  reports  for  submission  to  members  of  the  national \nsteering committee and ADB. The PCU and PIUs will share consultant resources and attend all \nsteering committee meetings to ensure project activities are well coordinated. \n \n20.  The project will work directly with community-based organizations, village development \ncommittees, and business associations, which will appoint local focal points to ensure good \ncoordination between the PIUs and project beneficiaries. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  The project will construct a new marine passenger pier in Kampot and facilitate private \ninvestment to operate international ferry services between Cambodia, Viet Nam, and other \ndestinations.22 It will improve wastewater management in Kep to create favorable conditions for \neconomic growth and enterprise development by local residents, particularly women and youth. \nEngineering solutions are technically feasible and consider cost, durability, affordability, and \nclimate resilience.23 The civil works are compatible with standard design parameters and the \nO&M  capacity  of  local  authorities.  Contract  packaging  will  attract  contractors  with  suitable \nqualifications and ensure efficient procurement. Capacity building programs will improve the \nbusiness enabling environment and help small entrepreneurs to become more competitive. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  An  economic  analysis  was  conducted  for  infrastructure  subprojects  following  ADB \nguidelines.24 Benefits quantified are (i) increased tourism receipts arising from an incremental \nincrease in tourist arrivals (1%\u20137% annually) and length of stay (0.5 days) in the project-\nsupported  destinations,  and  (ii)  tourism  loss  avoidance  arising  from  better  environmental \nmanagement of the Kep crab market and adjacent public beaches. Economic benefits not \nquantified are transport time savings, increased land values for property owners, and health \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to the \nKingdom of Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the \nGreater Mekong Subregion Mekong Tourism Development Project. Manila. \n22 During project preparation the MOT conducted a market sounding and five firms expressed interest in operating \ninternational ferry services. \n23 Climate Change Resilience Measures (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n 24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8     \nbenefits from improved environmental conditions. The base case results indicate all subprojects \nare  economically  viable,  with  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  exceeding  the \nassumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12.0%. Returns are 23.6% for the Kampot pier \nand 15.2% for the Kep crab market. Findings of the analysis are consistent with the past \nperformance of other ADB-financed public tourism infrastructure in Cambodia, which applying \nsimilar  assumptions,  generated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  exceeding  29.0%.25 The \nsubprojects are most sensitive to a reduction in tourist arrivals but remain viable under all \nadverse scenarios tested. 26  \n \n23.  The financial analysis followed ADB guidelines.27 The financial internal rate of return for \nthe Kampot pier is 4.2%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital, calculated at 0.9%. A \npier  management  authority  will  be  established  to  recover  O&M  costs  through  passenger \nterminal fees, berthing fees, and other income streams. The Kep DPWT will recover the cost of \nmaintaining  the  wastewater  treatment  system  at  the  Kep  crab  market  by  collecting  an \nenvironmental fee from businesses in the market. The access road component of the Kampot \npier subproject was identified as nonrevenue generating, thus a financial sustainability analysis \nof the DPWT that will be responsible for O&M of the asset was undertaken. The financial \nsustainability analysis found that there will be sufficient funds to maintain the road.28 \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  An assessment of the executing and implementing agencies\u2019 capacity to undertake \nprocurement  and financial  management  envisaged  under the  project\u2014including the  use  of \nstatement of expenditure and imprest fund procedure\u2014determined that pre-mitigation financial \nmanagement risks are high. Measures to mitigate identified risks, such as the potential for \ncorruption from weak procurement oversight and the shortage of financial management skills, \nwill  be  addressed  by  applying  standard  ADB  bidding  documents,  developing  a  financial \nmanagement  training  manual  and  suitable  accounting  systems,  and  embedding  long-term \nconsultants in the PCU and PIUs to provide on-the-job training for project staff and counterparts. \nCompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  and  external  audit  requirements  will  be \nmonitored  by  review  missions  and  normal  project  supervision.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOT. \nThe specific policy requirements and supplementary measures, including the MOT-endorsed \ngood governance framework, are described in the project administration manual (footnote 18). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  about  30,000  people  in  the  three  participating \nprovinces.29 Poverty rates in project areas range from 16% in Kampot to as high as 42% in Koh \nKong, mainly due to a lack of access to economic opportunities, underdeveloped human capital, \nand a lack of enterprise support services. The project\u2019s complementary investments to improve \naccess  infrastructure  and  environmental  services,  build  capacity  to  strengthen  tourism \nmanagement,  and  provide  micro  and  small  enterprises  with  training  and  business  support \nservices are designed to overcome these constraints and expand economic opportunities to \nbenefit  the  poor  and  low-income  households.  The  project  is  categorized  \u201ceffective  gender \n                                                \n25 ADB. 2011. Completion Report: Greater Mekong Subregion Tourism Development Project.

A gender action plan has been prepared specifying women will comprise 50% \nof participants in community consultations, 60% of participants in hospitality training, 40% of \nleadership positions in destination management organizations, and 25% of project management \nand  technical  staff.30 The  project  will  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  women  and  children  to \nHIV/AIDS  transmission,  human  trafficking,  and  other  forms  of  exploitation  by  conducting \nawareness programs and promoting collaboration between private enterprises, nongovernment \norganizations, and law enforcement agencies.31 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  All safeguards documents were prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and are posted on the ADB website in compliance with disclosure requirements (Public \nCommunications Policy 2011). The safeguards categorization for environment and involuntary \nresettlement is B, and the categorization for indigenous peoples is C. Initial consultations with \nmen and women residents, government officials, and civil society confirm broad support for the \nproject. Consultation with these groups will continue throughout the project cycle following the \nconsultation  and  participation  plan  and  stakeholder  communications  strategy.  The  project \nincludes resources to effectively implement social and environmental safeguards. Monitoring \nrequirements and appropriate grievance redress mechanisms are in the safeguards documents. \n \n27.  Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) were prepared in the context of the project\u2019s \narea of influence and based on current information.32 The potential environmental impacts are \nnot irreversible, diverse, or unprecedented. Expected impacts and risks are site-specific, and \nappropriate  mitigating  measures  are  incorporated  into  environmental  management  plans \n(EMPs) prepared for each infrastructure subproject. The Kampot pier will be developed a safe \ndistance upstream of seagrass conservation areas in Kampot bay. Mitigating measures are \ndesigned  in  accordance  with  international  good  practice  and  applicable  national  laws  and \nregulations. The IEEs and EMPs will be updated and finalized at the detailed design stage. The \nupdated documents will be cleared by the government and ADB, posted to the ADB website, \nand form part of bidding and contract documents. The final IEEs and EMPs will guide the \npreparation of site management plans with environmentally sensitive O&M guidelines. \n \n28.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  involve  only  temporary  disruption  of  33 \nbusinesses in the Kep crab market during construction of the wastewater treatment system, with \nno permanent impacts, no land acquisition, and no physical dislocation or severely affected \npersons. Due diligence undertaken confirms that there is no past or present involuntary land \nacquisition for either infrastructure subproject, there are no pending resettlement issues for \nexisting facilities, and the process of voluntary land donation for the Kampot pier is legitimate. A \nresettlement plan has been prepared for the Kep crab market subproject that is commensurate \nwith the extent and degree of the expected impacts.33 The initial cost of compensation for \nbusiness losses is estimated at $11,000. This amount is considered adequate, based on the \ncensus  and  inventory  of  losses  prepared  in  consultation  with  affected  persons  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s interministerial resettlement committee. Project information was disclosed to all \naffected persons, and a cutoff date for inclusion in the resettlement plan was established during \n                                                \n30 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 The project will collaborate with the Child Safe Tourism Campaign in cooperation with World Vision, the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, and Interpol.  \n32 Initial Environmental Examinations (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Resettlement Plan: Kep Crab Market Environmental Improvements (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2).  \n ", "10     \nresettlement consultations. The project information booklet will be updated and disseminated \nduring the detailed measurement survey. The resettlement plan will be updated and finalized at \nthe  detailed  design  stage,  cleared  by  the  government  and  ADB,  and posted  on  the  ADB \nwebsite. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  With mitigating measures, the overall risk for the project is assessed as low, and the \nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures \nare summarized in Table 5 and described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProvincial project staff lack experience with  Advance actions for consultant recruitment and capacity building  \nADB financial management and procurement  for financial management, procurement, and safeguards \nprocedures; delays in civil works \nprocurement and safeguards implementation \nAsynchronous implementation of regional  Appointment of counterparts with regional planning and \nactivities  coordination experience; meetings of the subregional and national \nsteering committees to resolve implementation issues \nLower-than-expected tourist arrivals in  Destination marketing programs target fast-growing priority \nproject provinces  markets; selection of provinces that are in multi-country tour \ncircuits being promoted by all GMS countries \nLack of private sector interest in operating  Preparation of a professional project brief and transaction \nferry services at Kampot pier  advisory services to facilitate selection of a suitable private \noperator \nIneffective financial management  Preparation of O&M plans for all infrastructure subprojects and \nundermines infrastructure O&M  financial management training for entities responsible for O&M \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GMS = Greater Mekong Subregion, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nIV.
