THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant, and (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of \nAustralia, both to the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) for the Ebeye Water Supply and \nSanitation Project.1  \n \n2.  The project will increase access to safe water and sanitation and promote behavioral \nchange to improve hygiene standards on Ebeye, an island within Kwajalein Atoll. Ebeye is the \nlargest population center in Kwajalein Atoll and is the second largest urban center in RMI with \nan area of approximately 31 hectares and a population of more than 9,600.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Ebeye has a high incidence of waterborne disease: about one reported case per eight \nresidents each year. Since 2001, Ebeye Hospital has reported an average of 1,182 cases per \nyear of waterborne disease, primarily gastroenteritis. The high incidence of waterborne disease \nis due to (i) limited access to safe water; (ii) ineffective hygiene, particularly among children; and \n(iii) a dilapidated sanitation system. \n \n4.  Limited sources of freshwater. The primary sources of potable water for households \non Ebeye are the public freshwater supply (78%) produced by a seawater reverse osmosis \n(SWRO)  desalination  plant  operated  by  the  Kwajalein  Atoll  Joint  Utilities  Resource,  Inc. \n(KAJUR),3 household  rainwater  tanks  (21%),  and  bottled  water  (1%).  Ebeye  has  minimal \ngroundwater reserves and no freshwater streams. The Ebeye SWRO plant has four units with \nthe following potable water production capacities: 387,500 liters per day for units 1 and 2, \n581,250 liters per day for unit 3, and 116,250 liters per day for unit 4. The first two units were \ninstalled in 2000, but unit 1 has not operated since 2005 and unit 2 has not worked since 2011 \nbecause essential spare parts are no longer available. Unit 3, commissioned in 2001, produces \nan average of 474,000 liters per day, but it requires about 20% more energy than modern \nSWRO plants to produce the equivalent volume of potable water. Unit 4 was commissioned in \n2014 and is operating at about 67% of its rated capacity.4 In total, the SWRO plant produces \nabout 590,100 liters of freshwater daily, potentially providing 61.5 liters per day to each Ebeye \nresident. \n \n5.  However, about half of the freshwater produced is lost because of leaks in the supply \nnetwork. Freshwater production capacity is also constrained by the limited capacity of the \nsaltwater water supply system. Freshwater is supplied to households through the freshwater \nsupply network for about 1 hour per week. Although KAJUR provides a water carting service, \nmost households cannot afford the delivery charge and obtain water from a freshwater filling \nstation operated by KAJUR when household supplies are depleted. Households are increasingly \nharvesting rainwater to increase access to freshwater, but this source is not secure because of \nseasonal  rainfall  patterns  and  more  frequent  droughts.  In  drought  years,  water  stored  in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n2  The project was prepared under Asian Development Bank. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands to Prepare the Ebeye Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila (TA 8306-RMI). \n3  KAJUR, a state-owned enterprise, also provides electricity generation and distribution, and sewerage services on \nEbeye. KAJUR also has a saltwater distribution network for the operation of the Ebeye\u2019s sewerage network. \n4  The United States provided unit 4 as part of its response to the RMI drought disaster in 2013. ", "2 \nrainwater tanks is rapidly consumed and the tanks may remain empty for long periods unless \nfilled from the KAJUR freshwater supply. \n \n6.  Low  awareness  on  hygiene  and  water-related  issues.  Public  awareness  and \neducation activities and outreach on hygiene and water-related issues are limited. A long-\nduration hygiene and water awareness campaign is required to foster the sustained behavioral \nchange  required  to  improve  hygiene  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases. \nCampaigns need to focus on women and children through programs delivered to womens\u2019 \ngroups and in schools.5 Upgrading school sanitation facilities on Ebeye, where the ratio of \nstudents to functioning toilets exceeds 150 to 1 in some cases, is necessary to foster improved \nhygiene behavior among Ebeye\u2019s students. \n \n7.  Dilapidated sewer system. The Ebeye saltwater sewerage system, commissioned in \n1967, has progressively failed because of a lack of maintenance. Saltwater for the operation of \nthe sewer system and for firefighting is sourced from two deep wells and pumped through a \ndedicated saltwater reticulation network to most areas on Ebeye. However, pressure in the \nsaltwater reticulation mains is too low to operate fire hydrants. The sewage treatment plant has \nnot operated since 2001 and untreated sewage is discharged into the lagoon. The sewage \npump stations have limited pumping capacity and break down frequently. Most sewers on the \nnorthern and eastern sides of Ebeye are partially blocked with sediment, and high levels of \nseawater have infiltrated the sewers. The seawater infiltration and pump failures often result in \nsewage overflows. Those overflows and the discharge of raw sewage to the lagoon present a \nserious health hazard. Water quality testing by the government\u2019s Environmental Protection \nAgency  indicates that the marine water quality at several locations on Ebeye\u2019s lagoon foreshore \ndoes not meet agency standards because of sewage contamination. \n \n8.  Reliance  on  electricity  supply.  Because  of  the  topography  and  the  scarcity  of \nfreshwater, the water supply and sewerage systems on Ebeye rely on the electricity distribution \nsystem to (i) pump saltwater from wells to the SWRO plant and to the saltwater sewerage \nsystem, (ii) operate the SWRO plant for production of freshwater, (iii) distribute freshwater \nthrough the freshwater supply network, and (iv) operate the sewage pump stations. Overall, \nEbeye\u2019s  electricity  system  is  reliable  and  continuously  meets  the  demand  for  electricity. \nHowever, several components of the electricity distribution system have outlived their design \nlives or require replacement to build the resilience of the electricity supply. These components \ninclude the high-voltage busbars and protection systems and high-voltage switchgear at the \nEbeye power station, and most wooden power poles. The power station monitoring system \nneeds to be replaced to improve the station\u2019s operational efficiency. \n \n9.  Unsustainable  water  and  sewerage  services.  Since  2008,  KAJUR  has  recorded \nannual operating losses of $2 million or more. Electricity services account for about 88% of \nKAJUR\u2019s operating revenue, with the balance sourced from freshwater sales to commercial and \ngovernment  customers.  KAJUR  provides  freshwater  and  sewerage  services  to  residential \ncustomers for free. KAJUR has financed the gap between expenditure and operating revenue \nthrough grants from the United States.6 KAJUR has developed a reform strategy to improve its \nfinancial sustainability through better operational efficiency and higher revenues.7 The reform \nstrategy includes the installation of consumer meters and the introduction of user charges for \n                                                \n5  Children under the age of 15 years are 45% of Ebeye\u2019s population. \n6  Through the RMI\u2013United States Compact of Free Association. \n7  KAJUR. 2011.

Implementation of the reform strategy has been delayed to \nsynchronize with the implementation of the project. \n \n10.  The project supports several of RMI\u2019s national development themes, as articulated in \nNational Strategic Plan, 2015\u20132017.8 It is also aligned with (i) the strategic priority of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  as  stated  in  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,9 to  make \ninfrastructure more inclusive; (ii) ADB\u2019s Approach to Assisting the Pacific, 2010\u20132014,10 which \nincludes improving water supply and sanitation services; and (iii) ADB\u2019s Water Policy11 and \nWater Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020,12 which aim to increase efficiency and productivity in the \ndelivery  of  water  services,  and  to  increase  investments  in  sanitation  and  wastewater \nmanagement. The project is included in RMI\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017.13 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be reduced incidence of waterborne disease on Ebeye, which is aligned \nwith RMI\u2019s national development theme of empowering people and communities to reduce the \nincidence  of  \u201caccess-related\u201d  poverty  through  improvements  in  all  areas,  including  social, \neconomic,  environment,  governance,  and  infrastructure,  as  articulated  in  RMI\u2019s  National \nStrategic Plan, 2015\u20132017. The outcome will be improved access to safe water and improved \nsanitation. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  Output 1: Secure and safe freshwater supplies. Ebeye\u2019s public water supply system \nwill be improved and safe freshwater supplied continuously to all households by  \n(i)  increasing the availability of freshwater to each resident of Ebeye to 105 liters a \nday through (a) the installation of a new SWRO unit with a freshwater production \ncapacity of 1.6 million liters per day,14 (b) the construction of two new saltwater \nwells with the capacity to fully meet the saltwater demand, (c) the construction of \na brine outfall to dispose of effluent from the SWRO plant, and (d) the installation \nof bulk supply meters at strategic locations within the water supply network; \n(ii)  improving the delivery of freshwater through the supply network by (a) building a \nnew  freshwater  pumping  station,  (b)  upgrading  about  350  meters  (m)  of \nfreshwater distribution mains from 100 millimeter (mm) to 200 mm diameter, (c) \ninstalling an 100,000-liter elevated freshwater reservoir, (d) implementing a leak \ndetection and repair program and replacing up to 370 m of 100 mm and 150 mm \ndiameter mains, and (e) replacing up to 880 freshwater service connections and \ninstalling prepayment water meters on all freshwater service connections; and \n(iii)  expanding the freshwater supply network by about 160 m and installing service \nconnections to 365 unserviced households. \n \n                                                \n8   Government of the Marshall Islands. 2014.

Output 2: Effective and efficient sewerage services. The sewerage system on Ebeye \nwill be upgraded to minimize the frequency and severity of uncontrolled sewage overflows and \nto reduce the environmental and health impacts of effluent disposal by  \n(i)  upgrading the sewerage collection system by (a) reconstructing all four sewage \npump  stations,  (b)  rehabilitating  or  replacing  450  m  of  existing  sewers, \n(c) rehabilitating or replacing 120 manholes, and (d) expanding the sewerage \nsystem by about 500 m and connecting 445 unserviced households; \n(ii)  upgrading  of  the  saltwater  supply  system  including  (a)  rehabilitation  or \nreplacement of 500 m of saltwater mains, (b) rehabilitation or replacement of 880 \nsaltwater service connections, (c) construction of an elevated saltwater reservoir \nwith a capacity of 50,000 liters, and (d) replacement of corroded fire hydrants \n(connected to the saltwater supply system) with 62 standpipes and purchasing a \nnew fire truck; and \n(iii)  improving the treatment and disposal of sewage by (a) installing primary sewage \ntreatment facilities (milli-screens), and (b) constructing a 350 m lagoon outfall \ndischarging at a depth of 35 m. \n \n14.  Output  3:  Enhanced  hygiene  awareness  and  improved  hygiene  behaviors.  A \nhygiene awareness and promotion program focusing on women and children, and building upon \nhygiene  awareness  and  promotion  activities  undertaken  during  project  preparation,  will  be \nimplemented over the duration of the project. Educational activities will promote good sanitation \nand  hygiene  practices  that  help  prevent  water-  and  sanitation-related  diseases.  Sanitation \nfacilities at schools, where the ratio of students to functioning toilets exceeds 150 to 1, will be \nupgraded and expanded. \n \n15.  Output 4: Secure electricity supply for water and sewerage operations. The power \ngeneration and electrical distribution system on Ebeye will be improved to reduce risks to \nEbeye\u2019s water supply and sewerage systems by (i) replacing the Ebeye power station\u2019s high-\nvoltage busbars and protection equipment, (ii) replacing the existing switchgear, (iii) installing a \npower plant data monitoring system, and (iv) replacing all wooden power poles. \n \n16.  Output 5: Financial and technical sustainability of Kwajalein Atoll Joint Utility \nResource, Inc. A program will be implemented to help KAJUR implement its reform strategy to \nbuild  its  financial,  technical,  and  operational  sustainability.  The  program  will  (i)  strengthen \nKAJUR\u2019s financial management systems; (ii) implement the tariff frameworks developed during \nproject preparation to ensure KAJUR\u2019s services are accessible to all households, including \nthose  in  greatest  hardship,  with  a  target  of  full  recovery  of  operations,  maintenance,  and \ndepreciation costs; (iii) introduce mechanisms to improve cost recovery, such as universal \n(prepayment) metering of electricity and freshwater supply; (iv) review the personnel structure \nand  strengthen  KAJUR\u2019s  administrative  capacity;  and  (v)  strengthen  water  and  sewerage \noperations. To foster household water conservation and reduce KAJUR\u2019s water supply and \nsewerage system operational costs, KAJUR will implement a household water service and \nsanitation fixtures program to repair plumbing leaks and install water-efficient water supply and \nsanitation fixtures. This component will initially focus on poorer households. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  An integrated approach will be adopted to address the water supply, sewerage, and \nelectricity supply infrastructure deficiencies in addition to fostering improved hygiene behaviors \nthrough hygiene awareness and education programs. Water supply, sewerage, and electricity \nmaster plans and associated prioritized investment plans have been prepared along with a \nhygiene  awareness  and  education  program.  Project  components  were  selected  and \ninvestments were prioritized in the master plans through a public consultation process. The \n                                                \n17  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nproject adopts the least-cost approach, which (i) minimizes operation management risks, (ii) has \nthe lowest environmental risk, and (iii) offers the greatest flexibility for future growth. \n \n21.  The existing water supply and sewerage systems will be rehabilitated and expanded to \nconnect households that are unserviced. The energy-inefficient SWRO plant will be replaced \nand the freshwater production capacity increased. Primary sewage treatment facilities will be \ninstalled and treated effluent will be discharged through a new lagoon outfall. The SWRO \nfreshwater  production  and  primary  sewage  treatment  technologies  are  appropriate  given \nKAJUR\u2019s  SWRO  plant  operation  experience  and  the  simplicity  of  the  proposed  sewage \ntreatment process. Under their supply contracts, SWRO and sewage treatment plant suppliers \nwill be required to guarantee the availability of essential spare parts for at least 15 years. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The integrated benefits of the project are expected to outweigh the project costs. The \nfinancial evaluation of the project was based on its full financial costs, including taxes and duties \nand  physical  contingencies.  Incremental  financial  costs  were  evaluated  against  projected \nincremental revenues from electricity, water supply, and sewer service operations that are \nenabled by the project. Incremental values, for both costs and revenue, were determined by \ncomparing the with-project and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return for \nthe project is 18.1%, substantially above the estimated weighted average cost of capital of \n3.5%, indicating that the project is financially viable. \n \n23.  The economic analysis compared the discounted costs and benefits under the with- and \nwithout-project scenarios during 2014\u20132048 in constant 2015 prices.18 The without-project case \nrepresents a continuation of the existing situation; the with-project case represents the project \ninvestment scenario. The project cost is estimated at $16.6 million, excluding taxes and duties, \nprice contingencies, and grant administration fees. The economic benefits used to assess the \nproject economic viability were (i) incremental water supply valued at willingness to pay; and (ii) \nhealth benefits measured as avoidance of the costs of illness related to waterborne diseases, \nespecially diarrhea and gastroenteritis. The economic internal rate of return of the project is \nestimated at 12.8%, above the opportunity cost of capital (12.0%). \n \n24.  Sensitivity analyses were undertaken on the economic results to examine the impacts of \nkey assumptions and project risks as follows: (i) capital cost increased by 20%, (ii) operation \nand maintenance cost increased by 20%, (iii) incremental water supply benefits decreased by \n20%,  and  (iv)  health  benefits  decreased  by  20%.  Under these  scenarios,  when  assessed \nindividually, the viability of the project falls, with economic internal rates of return of 8.9%\u2013\n12.8%. When all scenarios are considered together the economic internal rate of return for the \nproject drops to 5.9%.19 \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  Financial  management.  Since  2008,  KAJUR  has  recorded  operating  losses  of  $2 \nmillion  or  more,  primarily  because  of  inadequate  tariffs  and  high  fuel  costs  for  electricity \nproduction. Limited financial reporting and poor financial record management, coupled with \n                                                \n18 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Programs and projects in weakly performing countries should not be expected to always yield the same financial \nand economic rates of return as would be expected in stronger performing developing member countries. ADB. \n2007. Achieving Development Effectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries (The Asian Development Bank\u2019s \nApproach to Engaging with Weakly Performing Countries). Manila.  \n ", "8 \nturnover of experienced senior management since 2010, have also contributed to KAJUR\u2019s poor \nfinancial performance. The financial management assessment of KAJUR concluded that the \nfinancial control risk is high because of KAJUR\u2019s (i) lack of experience in managing large \nprojects,  (ii)  weak  record-keeping,  and  (iii)  new  management.  Mitigating  measures  are \nincorporated in the project. KAJUR will be responsible for maintaining project accounts and \npreparing grant withdrawal applications. A financial management advisor will be recruited under \nthe project to help KAJUR implement its financial reform plan, build its financial management \ncapacity, and support the preparation of the project\u2019s financial documentation. \n \n26.  Procurement  capacity. Procurement capacity assessments were undertaken of the \ngovernment  for  the  public  sector  program  in  2012  and  of  KAJUR  in  2014.  Government \nprocurement is done in accordance with the Procurement Code (Act), 1988 and applies to \nexpenditure of public funds irrespective of their source by the government. KAJUR, as a state-\nowned enterprise, is subject to the Procurement Code. Procurement risks under the project are \nconsidered low. However, KAJUR has limited procurement experience and no experience with \nthe procurement procedures of a multilateral development bank. All procurement of goods and \nworks will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time).20 All consultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Targeted procurement training for KAJUR \nwill  be  conducted  soon  after  project  approval.  The  project  implementation  assistance \nconsultants will support the project management unit\u2019s procurement activities. \n \n27.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto, and discussed with, the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Ebeye residents have a high incidence of gastroenteritis and other waterborne diseases. \nThe project impact will reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases by providing all residents \nwith direct access to safe and sustainable water and sewerage services, and by enhancing \npublic  awareness  of  hygiene  and  water  issues.  The  result  will  be  a  healthier  and  more \nproductive population with fewer private and public funds spent on medical services, and fewer \nwork and school days lost to illness. About 50% of households have access to both freshwater \nsupply and sewerage connections. Households that do not have access to freshwater and \nsewerage connections are those that suffer income poverty. The project will reduce poverty of \nopportunity by improving and extending potable water and sewerage services to all residents. \nThe project will also help institute lifeline tariffs to enable poor households to access freshwater, \nsewerage, and electricity services. \n \n29.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The project includes gender \ndesign features to ensure women\u2019s participation in the project and access to project benefits. A \ngender action plan has been prepared and includes (i) the Hygiene Awareness and Promotion \nProgram, which targets women and children; (ii) creation of jobs and skills training for women in \noperation and maintenance and as part of the household water service and sanitation fixtures \nprogram;  (iii)  engagement  of  an  international  gender  specialist  and  a  national  community \n                                                \n20 Since ADB is administering cofinancing in the form of a grant from the Government of Australia for operations \nfinanced by the ADF, universal procurement will apply to all procurement packages to be financed by ADF \nresources and/or the grant from the Government of Australia. \n ", "9 \nparticipation  and  gender  specialist;  and  (iv)  training  in  gender  analysis  and  gender \nmainstreaming in service provision for KAJUR staff.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).  The  project  provides  positive  environmental  benefits  by  improving  the \nenvironmentally safe collection and treatment of sewage on Ebeye. Sewage overflows within \nthe collection network will be reduced significantly. The quality of sewage treatment will meet \nappropriate standards for the marine environment. Sludge disposal will go to landfills complying \nwith  international  standards.  Adverse  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  will  mainly  be \nconstruction impacts, which are expected to be minimal for land-based works. The proposed \nsewer effluent outfall construction on the lagoon reef will require adequate mitigation measures. \nThe environmental management plan outlines the risks and mitigating actions to be undertaken \nduring project implementation.21 As KAJUR\u2019s environmental management capacity is limited, an \ninternational and a national environmental specialist will be engaged through the project to \nstrengthen KAJUR\u2019s capacity in this area. \n \n31.  Climate change. The project is assessed as having medium climate change risks. Key \nclimate change risks are sea level rise and onshore category 1 storms. Climate risk profiles for \nRMI indicate that the main impacts of climate change will be higher air and water temperatures, \nhigher sea levels, changing rainfall patterns, more severe and frequent droughts, and continuing \nocean acidification. Best estimates of long-term, systematic changes in the average climate for \nRMI indicate that sea level is likely to rise by up to 30 centimeters and the frequency of severe \nshort-term sea level rise resulting from a storm surge will increase from a one in 500-year event \nto a one in 2-year event by 2055.22 The project will help Ebeye develop greater resilience to \nclimate change by increasing freshwater production and introducing more energy-efficient water \nsupply and sewerage systems. \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is classified category \nB for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. A resettlement plan was \nprepared for the project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Most of the civil \nworks will be constructed on land leased to the Kwajalein Atoll Development Authority, which \ndedicates existing and planned road and utility corridors to public use in perpetuity. The project \nwill  have  minor resettlement  impacts  affecting 20  households  (147  persons),  including  the \nacquisition  of  easements  (about  0.54  hectares).  KAJUR  and  the  government  will  finance, \nimplement,  and  monitor  the  resettlement  plan.  The  people  of  Ebeye  consider  themselves \nindigenous in terms of ethnic origin. The project is not expected to have a negative impact on \nany distinct or vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The project will support capacity development within KAJUR to manage safeguards. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.23  \n \n                                                \n21  Initial Environmental Evaluation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Marshall Islands National Weather Service Office. 2011.
