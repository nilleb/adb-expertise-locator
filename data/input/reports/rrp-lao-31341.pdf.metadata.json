Reinforcement  and  extension  of  the \n115-kilovolt (kV) transmission line and substation facilities will also \nimprove  service  to  industrial  and  commercial  consumers  and \nreduce system losses . \n \nThe Lao PDR is one of the least developed countries in Southeast \nAsia. As 80% of the country\u2019s population is rural, rural development \nis  needed  to  reduce  poverty.  Bringing  electricity  to  rural  areas, \nespecially  poor  villages,  is  key  to  promoting  rural  development. \nDespite  the  country\u2019s  comparative  advantage  in  producing  power \nand the low cost of production, low population density makes initial \ncapital investments in rural electrification expensive. The Lao PDR \nthus has one of the lowest electrification rates in the region, which \nhinders  the  country\u2019s  ability  to  attract  investments  and  to  develop \nrural  areas.  The  Project  will  electrify  342  villages  and  towns,  and \ndirectly  benefit  poor  households  (about  43%  of  the  total  rural \npopulation).  These  households  will  substantially  reduce \ntheir \nexpenditure on energy, and improve their income and quality of life. \nThe  indirect  benefits  include  improved  health  and  education  and \nother benefits from rural development. Access to reliable and good \nelectricity  services  will  improve  the  ability  of  the  rural  population  to \ngenerate economic growth and better benefit from it. \n \nThe  project  objectives  are  to  (i)  extend  the  transmission  and \ndistribution  system  in  northern  rural  areas  to  provide  electricity to \nrural low-income communities, and to improve their living standards \nand  economic  condition;  and  (ii)  help  the  Government  restructure \nthe power sector, and strengthen  Electricit\u00e9  du  Laos (EdL) project \nmanagement capacity and operational efficiency. The Project scope \nincludes  (i)  reinforcement  and  extension  of  the  high-voltage (115 \nkV) power grid; (ii) construction of associated medium- (34.5/22 kV) \nand  low-voltage  (400  volts  [V])  distribution  systems;  and  (iii) \nprovision  of  consulting  services  to  help  EdL  in  detailed  project \ndesign,  implementation  supervision,  and  other  capacity  building \nactivities.  \n \n\n\fiv \n\nCost Estimates \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $51.51  million,  including  $35.90 \nmillion  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $15.61  million  equivalent in \nlocal currency costs. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n($ million)\n\nSource \n\n  Foreign \n  Exchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal \n\n% \n\nAsian Development \nBank  \nNordic Development \nFund  \n \nGovernment/Electricit\u00e9  \n \ndu Laos  \n\n \n\n26.60 \n\n9.30 \n\n0.0 \n\nTotal \n\n35.90 \n\n3.40 \n\n0.70 \n\n11.51 \n\n15.61 \n\n30.00 \n\n10.00 \n\n11.51 \n\n51.51 \n\n58.2 \n\n19.5 \n\n22.3 \n\n100.0 \n\n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $30 million equivalent from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Special Funds resources will be provided. The loan will have \na 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest \nrate  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  during  principal \namortization,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the \ndraft loan and project agreements. \n \nThe proceeds of the loan will be re-lent to EdL for 20 years maturity, \nincluding  a  5-year  grace  period,  at  an  interest  rate  of  3.0%  from \n2004  to  2005  and  6.0%  in  2006  and  thereafter.

Consultants will be recruited by EdL, in \naccordance with the Guidelines of Nordic Competitive Bidding, and \nin  full  consultation  with  ADB.  Approximately  13  person-months of \ninternational consulting services will be financed by the ADB loan, in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Use  of  Consultants, to \nhelp strengthen the power sector. \n \nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  33,800  households  in  342  rural \nvillages and towns, improve the lives of the people, and reduce their \nexpenditure  on  energy.  Reinforcement  and  extension  of \ntransmission  lines  and  substation  facilities  will  make  power  supply \nmore reliable and thus improve service to industrial and commercial \nconsumers.  New  facilities  will  help  reduce  system  losses.  EdL\u2019s \nproject management capacity will be strengthened.

This  report  is  based  on  the  findings  of  the  Loan \nAppraisal  Mission  and  discussions  with  government  agencies.  The  project  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n3. \nThe  power  sector  is  organized  under  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Handicrafts  (MIH), \nwhose  main  duties  include  preparing  power  sector  development  plans  and  regulations, \nrecommending  tariff  levels  to  the  Government,  and  administering  and  inspecting  electricity \nenterprises.  Under  MIH  is  Electricit\u00e9  du  Laos  (EdL),  a  wholly  state-owned  public  enterprise, \nwhich  owns  and  operates  the  country\u2019s  main  generation,  transmission, and distribution assets \nand manages electricity imports and exports. The organization structure of EdL is in Appendix 2. \n\nThe Lao PDR is one of the least developed countries in Southeast Asia. As 80% of the \n4. \npopulation lives in rural areas, these need to be developed to reduce poverty. Increasing access \nto  electricity  in  rural  areas,  especially  poor  villages,  is  key  to  their  development.  Despite  the \ncountry\u2019s  comparative  advantage  in  producing  power  and  the  low  cost  of  production,  low \npopulation  density  makes  initial  capital  investments  in  rural  electrification  expensive.  The  Lao \nPDR  thus  has  one  of  the  lowest  electrification  rates  in  the  region,  which  hinders  the  country\u2019s \nability to attract investments and develop rural areas.  \n\nOnly about 20% of all villages and 34% of households have electricity. The country has \n5. \nno  fully  integrated  national  grid.  The  power  system  covers  four  regions  and  serves  about \n250,000 customers. In the northern region, with 18% of the total population, only about 14% of \nvillages have access to electricity. Rural households and communities with no access to the grid \neither  have  no  electricity  supply  or  rely  on  more  expensive  and  limited  off-grid power supply, \nwhich stunts the growth of agriculture, services, and industry.  \n\n6. \nDespite  overall  reduction  of  poverty  due  to  significant  economic  growth  during  the \n1990s, poverty was only marginally reduced in the northern region, the country\u2019s poorest, where \nover 52% of the population is poor.1 With only basic infrastructure, the region has not benefited \nfrom economic growth as much as other regions. \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nContinued  economic  growth \n\n7. \nto  reduce  poverty  and  achieve  social \ndevelopment.  Although  the  country  has  development  potential,  particularly  in  land  and  water \nresources,  it  is  constrained  by  (i)  the  land-locked  nature  of  the  country;  (ii)  shortage  of  skilled \n\nis  needed \n\n                                                 \n1   Lao National Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2 1997/98. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nhuman  resources;  (iii)  weak  institutional  capabilities;  and  (iv)  limited  transport,  power,  and \ncommunication infrastructure serving the small and widely dispersed population. \n\n8. \nThe Government gives priority to power sector development to achieve macroeconomic, \nmicroeconomic, and social goals. The power sector policy2 is to maintain and expand low-cost, \nreliable,  and  sustainable  electricity,  increase  the  national  electrification  ratio  as  quickly  as \npossible,  and  bring  electricity  to  all  by  expanding  and  improving  the  main  grid.  If  more  cost-\neffective  than  grid  extension,  off-grid  electrification  in  remote  and  isolated  areas  will  also  be \nencouraged.3 \n\n9. \nEdL is extending the main grid, preferring  projects that accelerate social and economic \ndevelopment  and  reduce  rural  poverty.  To  achieve  the  government  target  of  raising  the \nelectrification  ratio  from  34%  to  70%  by  2010,  EdL  intends  to  supply  electricity  to  270,000 \nhouseholds with road access, mostly in rural areas. A detailed analysis of the power sector is in \nAppendix 3. \n\n10. \nADB has been the largest source of assistance to the power sector in Lao PDR, helping \nexport  hydropower  and  meet  local  electricity  demand  by  providing  over  $230  million  in  loans \nand technical assistance (TA) by the end of 2002 (Appendix 4). Of the eight completed power \nprojects, six were rated successful and the other two, partly successful.4 The sector should be \nmade  sustainable  and  able  to  deal  with  social  and  environmental  concerns  and  contract \nmanagement.  Low  domestic  retail  tariffs  and  EdL\u2019s  poor  financial  performance  impede \nsustainable  power  expansion.  The  Government  needs  to  set  tariffs  based  on  marginal-cost \npricing, progressively remove heavy subsidies to domestic consumers, and discourage waste. \nOnce electricity becomes available, the upper middle-class and wealthy households are the first \nto adopt  it.  If  a  project,  however,  also  introduces  reasonable  and  affordable  up-front charges \nand  lifeline  tariffs,  even  poor  households  pay  for  electricity.  The  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment addressed these issues (paras. 21\u201332), taking into account experience gained. \n\nThe  most  recently  completed  project  performance  audit  report  for  the  Nam  Ngum-\n11. \nLouang Phrabang Power Transmission highlights a number of lessons, which, along with follow-\nup actions, were incorporated into project design: (i) monthly tariff adjustment is suitable to raise \ntariffs  to  acceptable  and  viable  levels  without  causing  undue  consumer  resistance;  (ii) \ntransmission  projects  that  carry  electricity  across  populated  rural  areas  should  also  distribute \nelectricity  to  them  to  minimize  objections  from  affected  communities;  and  (iii)  more  rigorous \nchecks  are  needed  at  commissioning  so  that  faulty  equipment  does  not  impair  technical \noperations. \n\nADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program5  for  the  Lao  PDR  aims  to  promote  sustainable \n12. \neconomic  growth  and  development  through  infrastructure  investments.  Specifically,  ADB  will \ncontinue to help the power sector, emphasizing rural electrification. As most of the poor live in \nrural  areas  and  most  people  depend  on  agriculture  to  live,  rural  development  is  critical  to \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Widespread  rural  electrification  will \nimprove  productivity,  consumer  demand,  and  economic  opportunities.  Internationally,  rural \nelectrification  alone  has  not  triggered  industrial  development  and  economic  growth:  other \n                                                 \n2   Power Sector Policy Statement, Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts, March 2001 (Supplementary Appendix A). \n3  \n\nIn  general,  off-grid  electrification  is  a  viable  alternative  for  communities  too  far  from  dis tribution networks to be \neconomically served from the grid. A number of demonstration projects on off-grid electrification are ongoing with \nhelp  from  the  World  Bank,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  and  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme/Global Environmental Facility (UNDP/GEF) funds.  \n\n4   The  two  partly  successful  projects  are  (i)  Vientiane  Power  Distribution,  which  had  cost  overruns  following  civil \nunrest in the mid-1970s; and (ii) Nam Ngum -Louang Phrabang Power Transmission, which also had cost overruns \ndue to high inflation and the deteriorating exchange rate. \n\n5    ADB. 2002. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic Country Strategy and Program Update (2003-2005). Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\ninfrastructure  such  as  roads  and  improved  irrigation  must  be  available  or  developed \nsimultaneously.  The  Government  has  thus  agreed  that  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  focus  on  the \npoorest  northern  provinces.6  Such  an  integrated  approach  will  reinforce  projects,  thereby \nmaximizing efforts to reduce poverty and develop the economy. As ADB has approved a loan7 \nto finance the Northern Economic Corridor Project, which will link the Lao PDR to neighboring \nThailand  and  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  which  are  rapidly  growing  economies,  the  northern \nregion  can  expect  an  economic  boom.  The  proposed  Project  will  directly  complement  ADB\u2019s \nefforts, promote socioeconomic development, and reduce poverty. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n13. \nADB  is  helping  EdL  build  a  backbone  high-voltage  transmission  network  through  the \nPower Transmission and Distribution (PTD) Project.8 By project completion in September 2003, \nthese  backbone  lines  will  permit  further  high-voltage  extension  of  the  northern  grid  while \nsubstations will enable expanded coverage at 22.0-kilovolt (kV) or 34.5 kV distribution levels.  \n\n14. \nThe  proposed  Project  is  designed  to  maximize  the  benefit  of  previous  investment  in \ntransmission and distribution facilities and further extend the distribution network. The feasibility \nstudy  completed  in  September  2002  covers  potential  project  areas  in  Xieng  Khouang, \nPhongsali,  Louang  Namtha,  Oudomxai,  Louang  Phrabang,  and  Sayaburi  provinces,  and \nXaisomboun Special Region, which are due to receive special development assistance as they \nare the poorest parts of the country. \n\n15. \nThe distribution work should not be started all at the same time. During the Fact-Finding \nMission  the  Government  and  ADB  agreed  to  divide  the  northern  area  rural electrification into \nthree phases. The proposed Project is phase one and will intensify electrification in areas near \nthe backbone 115 kV transmission lines being constructed under the PTD Project to maximize \nfinancial and socioeconomic benefits. ADB has also committed to other infrastructure projects in \nareas  with  the  highest  poverty  incidence  and  potential  for  economic  development.9  Project \nareas include districts in Xieng Khouang, Sayaburi, Oudomxai, and Louang Namtha provinces, \nand Xaisomboun Special Region (see project map). Areas not covered under the Project will be \nelectrified  in  the  follow-on  phases.  This  Project  and  the  follow-on  projects  were  included  in \nEdL\u2019s updated Power Development Plan (2002-2011).  \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  objectives  are  to  (i)  extend  the  transmission  and  distribution  system  in \n16. \nnorthern  areas  to  provide  electricity  to  rural  low-income  communities,  and  improve  their  living \nstandards  and  local  economic  conditions;  and  (ii)  help  the  Government  restructure  the  power \nsector, and strengthen EdL\u2019s project management capacity and operational efficiency. \n\n                                                 \n6  \n\nIncluding  Phongsali,  Louang  Namtha,  Oudomxai,  Bokeo,  Louang  Phrabang,  Houaphanh, Sayaburi, and Xieng \nKhouang provinces. \n\n7  ADB. 2002.

The network facilities consist of 115 kV lines from Nam \nLeuk to Xieng Khouang, Xieng Ngeun to Sayaburi, and Thalat to Muang Feuang, and 115/22 kV substations at \nthe end of each line. \nIncluding  the  Northern  Economic  Corridor,  Rural  Access  Roads,  Northern  Community  Managed  Irrigation,  and \nNorthern and Central Water Supply and Sanitation projects. \n\n9  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Project  will  reinforce  and  extend  the  existing  high-voltage transmission lines (115 \n17. \nkV)  and  construct  associated  medium-  (34.5/22  kV)  and  low-voltage  (400-volt [V])  distribution \nsystems  in  the  northern  area.  Reinforcement  and  extension  of  the  115  kV  transmission  lines \nand substation facilities will improve service to industry and commerce. New transmission and \ndistribution  facilities  will  increase  the  capacity  of  transmission  lines,  substations,  and  shunt \ncapacitors, and thus lessen system losses. \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n18. \nGrid extension and distribution facilities will be developed along main and branch roads. \nRoad access ensures that grid extension is technically possible and economically beneficial. All \nvillages  along  the  main  roads  or  up  to  10  kilometers  (km)  from  the  transmission  line  are  the \nprincipal  candidates  for  electrification.  The  power  demand  forecast  projected  residential \nconsumption based on an inventory of appliances by house size and the assumed intensity of \ntheir  use.  Projected  nonresidential  consumption  in  villages  gave  allowance  for  schools, \nhospitals, markets, rice milling, guest houses, community water supply systems, and some large \nindustry users.10 Most targeted customers will be households in economically viable population \ncenters and rural villages with road access. Total projected energy sales from the project areas \nare estimated at 8% of EdL\u2019s projected domestic turnover in 2010. Given the limited increase of \npower  demand  in  rural  areas  and  adequate  power  surplus  in  the  Lao  PDR,  power  generation \nsources will be sufficient for power supply in project areas.11 \n\n19. \nThe Project will electrify 342 villages and towns, directly benefiting 33,800 households. \nThese  households  will  substantially  reduce  their  expenditure  on  energy,  and  improve  their \nincome and quality of life. The indirect benefits include improved health and education and other \nbenefits from rural development. Access to reliable and good electricity services will improve the \nability of the rural population to generate economic growth and better benefit from it. The Project \nwill lift barriers to access and lay the foundation for future poverty targeting of electricity access \nbeyond the project areas (paras. 26-28). \n\n20. \nThe  project  components  were  developed  following  technical,  economic,  and  financial \nstudies that consider environmental and social aspects. The feasibility study compared various \nways of extending rural electrification, including on- and off-grid options, and concluded that grid \nextension was the most cost-effective and would generate acceptable economic returns.12 The \nspecific  construction  quantities  will  be  revised  after  detailed  design  during  implementation. \nSpecifically, the Project will consist of the following components: \n\n(i) \n\nextension of high-voltage (115 kV) transmission lines totaling 303 km, including a \n173  km  line  from  Louang  Phrabang  to  Oudomxai,  and  a  79  km  line  from \nOudomxai to Louang Namtha, a 46 km line from Hin Heup to Vang Vieng, and a \n5 km line from Nam Ngum to Thalat; \n\n(ii) \n\nconstruction of 115, 34.5, and 22 kV substations at Oudomxai, Louang Namtha, \nand  Louang  Phrabang  (extension);  \u201cT\u201d  tap  junction13  at  Hin  Heup  substation; \n\n                                                 \n10   Under the  feasibility  study  as  well  as  the  Fact-Finding  Mission\u2019s  field  survey,  a  number  of  large  industrial  users \n\nsuch as cement plants, a sawmill, and a garment factory were operating or would be developed. \n\n11   By completion, total increased demand on annual energy in the project areas is estimated at 46,000 MWh/year. \nDetailed power supply and demand balances for the country and regions show that the increased demand up to \n2020 could be met by increasing power supply sources. \n\n12   As  an  optimal  design,  the  conventional  22  kV,  three-phase,  three-wire  distribution  system  is  employed  for  high-\ndensity town centers or villages, while the 34.5 kV, three-phase, two-shield wire, earth return shield-wire system is \nthe least-cost solution to electrify low-density service areas with small loads. \n\n13   A \u201cT\u201d-shaped junction where a new transmission line is connected to an existing line to tap power supply. \n\n\f5 \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n\u201cInterface\u201d at Sayaburi and Phonsavanh substations; and some minor extension \nwork at Vang Vieng, Thalat, and Nam Ngum substations; \n\nerection  of  796  km  of  medium-voltage  (34.5/22  kV)  distribution  lines,  237 \ndistribution  transformers,  and  609  km  of  low-voltage  (380  V)  distribution  lines; \nand connection of 33,800 households in 342 villages;  \n\nclearance of unexploded ordnance (UXO) in project areas; \n\nmiscellaneous  works, \ncompensation programs; \n\nincluding  benefit  monitoring, \n\nresettlement,  and \n\nconsulting  services  to  help  EdL  in  detailed  project  design,  implementation \nsupervision, and other capacity-building support; and \n\nconsulting  services  to  the  Government  to  further  study  the  separation  of  its \nexisting shareholdings and future independent power producer (IPP) investments \nfrom  EdL,  and  development  of  IPP  project  selection  and  implementation \nprocedures. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Recovery Program \n\nEdL\u2019s  financial  performance  since  1997  has  been  significantly  affected  by  the \n21. \ndepreciation of the kip. As EdL borrows almost all its debt in foreign currency, the depreciation \nof the kip has prevented it from meeting its financial ratios (Appendix 5). With the help of ADB \nand  the  World  Bank,  the  Government  and  EdL  have  made  great  efforts  to  improve  EdL\u2019s \nfinancial  performance.  In  late  1999  the  Government  approved  a  comprehensive  financial \nrecovery  program  (FRP)  for  EdL  to  restore  its  financial  viability  and  improve  its  internal  cash-\ngenerating capacity to meet future investment needs. \n\n22. \nSpecific  financial  recovery  measures  include  the  following:  (i)  increase  retail  electricity \ntariffs starting in May 2002 for all consumer classes by approximately 2.3% per month through \nApril 2005; (ii) convert some EdL debt into government equity; (iii) retain dividends from EdL\u2019s \nsubsidiary  companies;  (iv)  revaluate  EdL\u2019s  fixed  assets  in  service;  (v)  temporarily  relax \nrepayment terms of subsidiary loan agreements; (vi) review EdL\u2019s capital expenditure program \nto  ensure  EdL\u2019s  financial  viability  in  meeting  the  Government\u2019s  electrification  targets; and (vii) \nimplement  EdL\u2019s  performance  contract  with  the  Government,  which  includes  eliminating \npayment  arrears  from  government  agencies.  The  Government  agreed  to  offset  its  arrears  and \ncurrent  consumption  against  EdL\u2019s  tax  and  other  financial  liabilities.  In  May  2003  the \nGovernment  confirmed  that  the  first  offsetting  payment  had  been  made,  and  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  agreed  on  a  schedule  of  consecutive  quarterly  offsets  in  2004  and  2005  to  fully \nsettle the arrears. Completion of the FRP and other beneficial transactions in 200214 has helped \nEdL  recover  from  its  financial  crisis  and  become  more  stable.  EdL  operations  should  be \nprofitable  and  sustainable  for  the  next  several  years.  However,  EdL  faces  some  risks  as  it \nattempts to balance its capital expansion plans (including rural electrification projects on behalf \nof  the  Government)  with  its  financial  performance  as  a  commercial  organization.  ADB  will \n                                                 \n14  The  proceeds  from  refinancing  of  the  Theun  Hinboun  Hydropower  Project  were  applied  to  outstanding  liabilities \n\nwith the Government. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ncontinue  to  monitor  EdL\u2019s  financial  recovery  and  help  in  future  planning  to  ensure  that  EdL \nremains properly capitalized. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation of the Power Sector Strategy  \n\n23. \nIn  the  last  several  years,  ADB  has  focused  its  policy  dialogue  efforts  on  financial \nrestructuring and revisions of EdL\u2019s tariff structure, which has allowed EdL to recover from the \n1997  financial  crisis  and  move  to  full  loan  covenant  compliance.  Recently,  ADB  has  also \nengaged MIH and EdL in institutional and sector restructuring. Under an ADB TA, 15 the Power \nSector  Strategy  Study  (PSSS)  was  completed  in  September  2002,  reviewing  overall  sector \ndevelopment and policies. Key policy recommendations include (i) developing a more rigorous \nleast-cost hydropower development plan and selection process and accordingly updating EdL\u2019s \nPower  Development  Plan;  (ii)  segregating  non-core  operations  such  as  off-grid  rural \nelectrification  and  IPP  investment  functions,  allowing  EdL  to  concentrate  on  power  grid \noperation and development; (iii) reevaluating the role of the Government in the power sector as \nan operator, investor, and regulator; and (iv) establishing a procedure for competitive tendering \nof  future  generation  projects.  These  recommendations  focus  on  long-term  development \nstrategies  and  will  guide  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government.  Further  work  on \ncoordination with the World Bank to jointly implement those strategies is ongoing. \n\nBased on the findings of the PSSS and a workshop16 on options for power sector reform, \n24. \nthe  Government  has  approved  a  sector-strengthening  strategy,  including  a  time-bound \nimplementation plan in June 2003, and began implementing it thereafter. \n\nThe Government prioritizes power generation for export to raise revenue. The Electricity \n25. \nLaw  gives  EdL  the  mandate  to  ensure  domestic  power  supply  through  development  and \noperation  of  domestic  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  However,  EdL  has  been \ndistracted  from  financially  managing  its  core  operations  as  it  is  the  Government\u2019s  shareholder \nfor  IPP  projects.  EdL  uses  dividends  from  IPP  investments  to  cross-subsidize core operations \nand meet loan covenants. EdL has also unintentionally reduced the direct financial benefits that \nthe Government receives from IPP. Although the Government\u2019s Power Sector Policy Statement \nand  studies  support  the  establishment  of  a  wholly  government-owned  IPP  shareholding \ncompany to assume ownership of shares held by EdL, a detailed implementation framework to \nestablish  and  operate  this  company  needs  further  study  and  stakeholder  consultation.  The \nGovernment  and  ADB  have  agreed  to  study  IPP  project  selection  criteria  and  introduce clear \nIPP project implementation procedures (para. 41). \n\n3. \n\nConnections for the Poor \n\n26. \nThe Project addresses two key barriers that prevent the poor from accessing electricity \nservices from the grid. The first is the policy of cost sharing, where the village contributes 30% \nof  low-voltage  distribution  costs,  and  thus  disproportionately  burdens  the  poorer  and  more \nremote  villages  and  may  deter  villages  from  connecting  entirely.  MIH  recognized  the  inequity \nand,  to  provide  affordable  electricity  services  to  the  poor,  has  abolished  the  policy  of  cost \nsharing.  \n\n27. \nThe second barrier was the up-front connection charges paid by individual households. \nPoor  households  may  find  the  charges  too  steep  to  pay  in  one  lump  sum.  The  Fact-Finding \n\n                                                 \n15   ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Lao PDR for the Power Sector Strategy Study. Manila. \n16   Vientiane, November 2002. \n\n\f7 \n\nMission\u2019s findings confirm that poor households in electrified villages are either not connected or \nconnect  through  shared  (illegal)  connections,  which  are  paid  for  at  a  flat  rate  and  thus \nsubstantially more expensive per kWh than direct connections. This also implies that electricity \nsubsidies are not reaching the poor but, in effect, benefiting the nonpoor.  \n\n28. \nEdL  has  agreed  to  allow  residential  consumers  connecting  to  3/9-ampere  meter \nconnections,  and  all  new  residential  consumers,  and  not  just  those  under  ADB  projects,  to \namortize  the  initial  up-front  costs  over  up  to  12  months.  Charges  for  wiring  from  the  pole  and \nworks  on  inside  house  wiring  will  be  left  entirely  to  the  private  sector  to  promote  small-scale \nrural  enterprise.  The  private  sector  is  expected  to  provide  credit  on  the  work  to  secure \ncustomers. However, EdL will carefully monitor connections under the Project as part of benefit \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  and  require  revision  of  credit  provision  if  needed.  The  number  of \nconnected  poor,  compared  to  the  anticipated  number,  will  be  reported  in  quarterly  reports  to \nADB as part of project performance monitoring. \n\n4. \n\nLoss Reduction on Distribution System \n\n29. \nEdL\u2019s distribution losses were relatively high during the past 5 years at around 20%. The \nloss  reduction  program  under  the  PTD  Project  identified  a  number  of  factors  contributing  to \nEdL\u2019s  technical  and  nontechnical  distribution  losses,  and  recommended  ways  to  reduce  them. \nEdL established a loss reduction unit (LRU) to record and analyze distribution losses. Staff in all \nmain  field  branches  are  trained  regularly  in  loss  reduction.  Through  consultant  services,  the \nProject will help EdL implement recommendations for loss reduction. \n\nEdL  will \n\nimplement \n\nincluding \nthese  recommendations  under \n30. \nimprovement  of  its  billing  system,  upgrading  low-  and  medium-voltage distribution conductors, \ncalibrating and replacing inaccurate meters in substations, and installing new capacitors. EdL is \ncommitted to reduce total domestic distribution loss17 to less than 17% by the end of 2003, 16% \nby  2004,  and  15%  by  2005,  and  maintain  these  levels  thereafter.  The  Project  will  help  EdL \nreduce  losses,  and  the  consultant  engaged  will  provide  technical  supervision  and  training  for \nEdL  staff,  particularly  at  EdL  branch  offices,  to  continually  improve  EdL\u2019s  operational \nperformance.  EdL  will  submit  to  ADB  annual  progress  reports  on  LRU  operations  and \nmanagement, and statistics of total system losses. \n\nits  own  budget, \n\n5. \n\nCapacity Building \n\nEdL  has  successfully \n\nimplemented  seven  ADB-assisted  projects. \n\nIts  overall \n31. \nperformance,  including  that  for  projects  financed  by  other  lending  agencies,  is  satisfactory. \nEdL\u2019s institutional capacity has been strengthened substantially. However, capacity weaknesses \nstill  exist,  particularly  in  the  design  and  operation  of  high-voltage transmission and distribution \nfacilities, financial management, social and environmental management, contract management, \nand benefit and evaluation monitoring. The Project will complement ADB\u2019s previous efforts and \nfurther strengthen EdL\u2019s capacity in these areas through consultant services in coordination with \nother funding agencies support. The consultants will (i) train EdL staff in bid evaluation, contract \nawarding,  supervision  of  construction  work,  and  system  testing  and  commissioning;  (ii) \nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  staff  in  main  field  offices  through  regular  training  seminars, \ndissemination  of  technical  standards,  and  implementation  of  the  computerized  management \n\n                                                 \n17  Domestic  distribution  losses  are  defined  as  the  difference  between  (i)  gross  energy  (gigawatt-hours [GWh]) sent \nout from the 115 kV substation, and (ii) electricity (GWh) billed to all consumers and expressed as a percentage of \ngross energy. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ninformation system; and (iii) help  improve social and environmental assessment, management, \nand monitoring of projects. \n\n32. \nThe Project will also provide capacity building in consumer services through a consumer \nawareness  program,  which  will  include  information  on  safe  use  of  electricity, connection cost \npolicy, tariffs, billing statements and timing of bills, and due payment and disconnection policy. \nThe program design will take into account the difficulties of language barriers. The Project will \nhelp  build  sustainable  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  feed  into  project  design  and \nevaluation (para. 46). \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n33. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $51.51 million equivalent, comprising $35.90 million \nequivalent  (70%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $15.61  million  equivalent  (30%)  in  local \ncurrency  cost.  The  cost  estimates  are  based  on  2003  price  levels  for  base  costs,  and  include \nphysical  contingencies,  price  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and  interest  charges  during \nconstruction.  Physical  contingencies  have  been  estimated  at  10%  of  base  costs,  and  price \ncontingencies  were  calculated  using  ADB\u2019s  current  rates  of  inflation.  The  cost  estimates  are \nsummarized in Table 1 and details in Appendix 6. \n\nTable 1: Summary of Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \n\nA.  Base Cost \n \n \n \n\n1.

The loan will finance $26.6 million of the Project\u2019s foreign exchange cost, \nincluding interest during construction on the loan to the Government. The loan will also finance \n$3.4  million  equivalent  of  the  Project\u2019s  local  costs.  The  proportion  of  local  currency  funding \n\n\f9 \n\nproposed under this loan is justified by the nature of the Project, particularly its focus on poverty \nreduction,  electrification  of  rural  areas,  and  fiscal  condition  of  the  Government.  The  Nordic \nDevelopment  Fund  (NDF)  will  provide  parallel  cofinancing  of  \u20ac10  million  (approximately  $10 \nmillion  equivalent)  for  the  substation  package  and  project  implementation  consulting  services, \nrepresenting 19.5% of total project cost.18 EdL will fund $11.5 million of local costs (representing \n22.3% of total project cost) from its internally generated funds. The proposed financing plan is in \nTable 2. \n\nThe ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including an 8-year grace period, with an \n35. \ninterest  rate  of  1.0%  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  during  principal  amortization  and  on \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  borrower  will  be \nthe Lao PDR, and the proceeds of the loan will be re-lent to EdL pursuant to a subsidiary loan \nagreement  with  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  borrower  will  re-lend the ADB \nloan  to  EdL  for  20  years  maturity,  including  a  5-year grace period, at interest rates consistent \nwith  the  re-lending  terms  included  in  the  government-approved  FRP  (3.0%  interest  in  2004-\n2005, 6.0% interest in 2006 and thereafter). The Government will re-lend NDF\u2019s loan to EdL on \nthe same terms. EdL agreed to bear the Government\u2019s foreign exchange risk of the proposed \nloans, as EdL\u2019s foreign currency  earnings  from  export  sales  of  electricity  should  mitigate  this \nrisk. \n\nTable 2: Proposed Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n\nSource \n\n  Foreign  Share of \n\nCurrency \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nShare of \nTotal \n(%) \n  \n\n6.6 \n\n1.4 \n\n  \n\nTotal \n  \n\n30.00 \n\n10.00 \n\n  \n\n3.40 \n\n0.70 \n\nShare \nof   \nTotal \n(%) \n  \n\n58.2 \n\n19.5 \n\n11.51 \n\n22.3 \n\n11.51 \n\n22.3 \n\nTotal \n(%) \n  \n\n51.6 \n\n18.1 \n\n0.0 \n\n  \n\n26.60 \n\n9.30 \n\n0.00 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n35.90 \n\n69.7 \n\n15.61 \n\n30.3 \n\n51.51 \n\n100.0 \n\nAsian Development Bank Loan \n\nNordic Development Fund Loan \nGovernment/Electricit\u00e9 du Lao  \nCounterpart Funding \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n36. \nEdL  will  be  the  Project\u2019s  executing  agency.  The  EdL  general  manager  will  be \nresponsible for overall project management. The project management unit (PMU) headed by the \nproject manager was established at EdL on 18 March 2003.19 Supervised by the Development \nDepartment  deputy  general  manager,  the  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  all  aspects  of  project \nimplementation:  (i)  overall  project  implementation  planning,  budgeting,  finance  planning,  and \naccounting;  (ii)  recruitment  of  consultants;  (iii)  supervision  and  coordination  of  detailed  project \ndesign;  (iv)  procurement  of  goods  and  services;  (v)  implementation,  supervision,  and \n                                                 \n18   The NDF board had approved the loan proposal on the cofinancing arrangement for the Project in May 2003. The \nNDF  loan  will  be  denominated  in  euros  and  have  a  maturity  of  40  years,  with  a  10-year grace period, 0.75% \nservice  charge,  and  0.50%  commitment  fee.  NDF  will  administer  its  own  loan  portion,  including  the  relevant \nprocurement and disbursement. \n\n19   The PMU consists of the project manager, project accountant, procurement specialist, and project engineer. \n\n  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fcommissioning  of  all  project  components;  (vi)  organization  of  the  project  performance \nmonitoring system; and (vii) preparation of periodic progress reports and the project completion \nreport.  A  team  of  international  consultants  will  help  the  PMU  in  its  day-to-day  operations. \nConsultant  services  and  construction  work  will  be  carried  out  under  contracts  administered by \nEdL.  It  will  establish  a  permanent  socioeconomic  cell  by  the  end  of  2003  under  the \nEnvironmental and Social Management Office. \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n37. \nThe Project will be implemented over 4.5 years beginning in the fourth quarter of 2003. \nPhysical  works  are  expected  to  be  completed  by  the  first  quarter  of  2008,  with  loan  closing  in \nSeptember 2008 (6 months following completion of works). The 4.5-year implementation period \nis  considered  appropriate,  given  the  large  number  of  project  components,  distances  of  the \nproject sites, and the difficult terrain. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n38. \nProcurement of goods and services to be financed from the proposed ADB loan will be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  International  competitive \nbidding procedures will be used for major civil works contracts estimated to cost over $1 million, \nand supply contracts valued over $500,000. For civil works contracts not exceeding $1 million, \nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  used.  The  Government\u2019s  procurement  guidelines \n(Implementing  Rules  and  Regulations  on  Government  Procurement  of  Goods,  Construction, \nRepairs  and  Services,  December  1988),  prepared  under  an  ADB  TA,  are  considered \nsatisfactory  for  this.  For  supply  contracts  valued  at  $500,000  or  below,  international  shopping \nprocedures will be followed. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 8. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n39. \nConsidering  EdL\u2019s  limited  project  management  capacity  and  technical  expertise, \napproximately 110 person-months of international and 20 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices will  be  required  to  support  project  implementation  and  capacity  building.  Consultants \nwill  focus  on  supervising  and  guiding  project  implementation  and  EdL  staff  training,  while  the \nPMU will be responsible for project implementation.  The consultant team, including experts on \ntransmission,  substation,  distribution,  environmental  and  socioeconomic  survey,  assessment \nand monitoring, will help EdL (i) conduct detailed project design; (ii) procure goods and services; \n(iii)  supervise  installation  and  construction;  (iv)  final  system  test  and  commission;  (v)  oversee \nquality assurance on UXO detection and clearance; (vi) provide technical support for distribution \nmanagement  and  loss  reduction;  (vii)  conduct  social  and  environmental  assessment, \nmanagement,  and  monitoring;  (viii)  build  capacity  for  social  and  environmental  assessment, \nmanagement,  and  monitoring;  (ix)  undertake  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation; \nand (x) conduct a consumer awareness campaign. \n\n40. \nProject  implementation  consultant  services  will  be  entirely  financed  from  the  proposed \nNDF  loan.  EdL  will  recruit  consultants  in  accordance  with  NDF\u2019s  General  Procurement \nGuidelines  (to  be  attached  to  NDF\u2019s  credit  agreement)  based  on  Nordic  competitive  bidding, \nand in full consultation with ADB. The general procurement principles and documents will follow \nand  be  based  on  ADB\u2019s  practice  and  guidelines.  The  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  for  project \nimplementation consulting services are in Appendix 9. \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nAround  13  person-months  of  separate  consulting  services  will  be  required  to  help  the \n41. \nGovernment  strengthen  the  power  sector.  EdL  will  closely  coordinate  with  the  Committee for \nPlanning and Cooperation, MIH, and other agencies. These consulting services will be financed \nfrom  the  ADB  loan  and  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.20 The major tasks include (i) develop transparent IPP project selection criteria and \nintroduce  clear  IPP  project  implementation  procedures,  and  (ii)  identify  and  structure  an \nappropriate  government  agency  to  assume  ownership  of  the  Government\u2019s  existing  IPP \nshareholdings and future IPP equity investments.  The TOR for these consulting services are in \nAppendix 10. \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nFor  ADB  loan  funds,  all  standard  disbursement  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n42. \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (January  2001)  will  be  used.  Disbursements  will  be  for  supply \nand installation of power distribution and transmission equipment and accessories. Considering \nEdL\u2019s  adequate  cash-flow capacity, the Government and EdL agreed that an imprest account \nwould not be required. However, to facilitate disbursement processing, statement of expenditure \nwill be used, with a ceiling of $50,000.  \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n43. \nEdL will maintain separate accounts for the proposed Project and submit to ADB within 9 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year audited annual project accounts describing in detail fund \nsources and expenditures. EdL will also submit within 9 months after the end of the fiscal year \naudited annual financial statements. \n\n44. \nUnless otherwise agreed in advance by ADB, EdL will continue to hire external auditors \nfor  its  annual  financial  statements  and  annual  project  accounts,  and  the  audit  report  together \nwith the memorandum on issues identified during the audit will be attached to these reports. For \nfuture contracts and revisions, ADB will approve the auditors\u2019 TOR before work starts. While the \naccounts  will  be  prepared  using  Lao  accounting  standards,  the  audit  will  be  done  using \ninternational  standards  of  auditing.  The  auditors  will  provide  detailed  comments  on  any \ndivergence  from  such  standards,  provide  opinions  on  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  financial \ncovenants, and indicate the details of the actual calculation for all ratios, in conformity with the \ndefinitions contained in the loan and project agreements.  \n\nRegular  progress  reports  for  the  proposed  Project  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMU  and \n45. \nsubmitted  quarterly  to  ADB  and  NDF.  The  reports  will  describe  the  physical  progress, \nprocurement  and  contractual  status,  highlights  of  implementation  issues,  total  number  of \nconsumers connected, and a summary of project components, with details of the latest project \ndisbursements  of  incremental  expenditures  and  contract  amounts.  A  project  completion  report \nwill  be  submitted  to  ADB  and  NDF  within  3  months  after  project  completion.  Aside  from \nassessing  project  execution  and  operation,  the  report  will  indicate  compliance  with  the  loan \ncovenants. \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n46. \nEdL will ensure that a comprehensive program for project performance monitoring and \nevaluation (PPME) acceptable to ADB will be carried out during implementation and subsequent \n                                                 \n20 The selection of consultants will employ the quality- and cost-based selection method, involving the simultaneous \n\nsubmission of technical and financial proposals and the use of price as an evaluation criterion. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\noperation to assess the achievement of the Project\u2019s objectives. The PPME will be based on the \nproject  framework  in  Appendix  2,  including  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  project physical \nprogress, operations, and project benefits and impacts. With help from the consultants and in \nconsultation with local communities, the PMU will develop a set of PPME indicators at the start \nof  the  Project.  The  PMU  will  carry  out  the  PPME,  including  initial  baseline  physical  and \nsocioeconomic  surveys,  data  collection,  and  analysis.  To  set  a  benchmark  to  monitor  and \nevaluate  social  and  economic  benefits,  a  baseline  socioeconomic  survey  will  be  carried  out \nbefore connections are made in project areas. A second socioeconomic survey will be carried \nout 3 years after the first connections to evaluate project effectiveness in targeting the poor and \nenhancing  the  welfare  of  households  and  communities.  The  surveys  will  cover  electrified  and \nunelectrified  areas.  The  new  connection  policy  will  be  assessed  continuously  throughout  the \nProject.  EdL  will  submit  a  detailed  PPME  implementation  plan  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and \nconcurrence within 6 months of loan effectiveness, as well as annual PPME reports. \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n47. \nA project inception mission will be fielded soon after approval of the proposed loan. ADB \nwill  also  conduct  regular  reviews  (at  least  twice  annually)  throughout  project  implementation. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  agree  on  measures  to  remove  any  hurdles  to  project \nimplementation  and  to  meet  project  objectives.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  NDF  will  jointly \nundertake a detailed midterm review of the Project after 2 years of implementation, or earlier if \nmajor  difficulties  threaten  the  project  objectives.  The  midterm  review  will  appraise  the  project \nscope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, number of connections, and compliance \nwith  loan  covenants;  and  identify  issues  to  be  resolved  to  improve  project  impact  and \nsustainability.  The  Government,  ADB,  and  NDF  will  jointly  decide  on  any  changes  needed  in \nproject design and implementation. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n48.  Most  households  have  no  access  to  grid  electricity.  However,  province-sponsored \nsystems and privately operated diesel-run generators or small hydro systems and imports from \nThailand  provide  limited  amounts  of  electricity  to  homes,  industry,  and  commerce,  albeit  at \nsubstantially higher prices than those paid by EdL customers. \n \n49. \nThe  economic  benefits  of  extending  grid  supply  to  unserved  areas  are  estimated  for \nincremental  and  nonincremental  consumption.  Benefits  for  existing  consumption  levels  are \nbased  on  the  cost  of  alternative  energy  sources  when  grid  electricity  is  absent,  and  on \nconsumers\u2019 willingness to pay when it is available. Benefits were estimated separately for poor \nand nonpoor residential consumers, and for industrial, commercial, and irrigation customers. \n \nDerivations  for  the  willingness-to-pay  demand  curve  were  made  for  poor  and  nonpoor \n50. \nhouseholds,  with  the  nonpoor  divided  into  established  and  first-time  consumers.  The  initial \nconsumption point of each demand curve is set and valued individually based on the load profile \nof each category, reflecting its ability to pay.  \n \n51. \nEstimated costs of private power supply for commercial customers are based on the use \nof a 40 kW gas oil generator, and for industrial customers, on a 200 kW gas oil generator. The \ncost of alternative energy sources for irrigation is based on the estimated cost for diesel pumps \n\n\f13 \n\nwith  an  8-horsepower  motor.  As  for  domestic  customers,  benefits  were  estimated  for \nincremental  and  nonincremental  consumption  levels  based  on  load  forecasts  for  the  three \nconsumer segments. \n \nThe  economic  analysis  is  carried  out  at  border  price  level  using  2003  prices.  Financial \n52. \nproject  costs  were  converted  into  economic  cost  by  deducting  taxes  and  duties.  No  price \ncontingencies  are  included  in  the  base  capital  cost,  but  the  economic  capital  costs  include \nphysical  contingencies.  Costs  were  separated  into  foreign  exchange  and  local  costs,  and  a \nstandard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  has  been  applied  to  local  costs.  Annual  operation  and \nmaintenance costs were also calculated in economic  prices as a percentage of the total capital \ninvestment  cost.  The  economic  cost  also  includes  provision  for  residential  wiring,  which  is \nexcluded from financial cost. Energy costs have been valued based on the actual export price of \nelectricity as the foregone economic benefit. System losses were calculated separately for each \nnew  feeder  based  on  estimated  peak  demand  and  on  load  and  loss  factors,  and  included  in \nestimating energy costs. On the basis of a comparison of economic costs and benefits over a \n35-year project lifetime, including the construction period and excluding any residual value, the \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  was  estimated  at  23.3%,  with  a  net  present  value  of  KN356 \nbillion. Sensitivity testing and risk analysis show that the Project will be robust in all scenarios. A \ndistribution  analysis  showed  that  electricity  consumers  and  local  labor  will  benefit  from  the \nProject,  while  the  Government  return  on  the  Project  will  be  negative  as  a  result  of  the  highly \nsubsidized tariff structure. The  poverty  impact  ratio  was  estimated  to  be  10%.  Details  of  the \neconomic, distribution, and risk analysis and the sensitivity tests are in Appendix 11. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n53. \nThe Project\u2019s financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is based on the Project\u2019s capital and \noperating  and  maintenance  costs,  and  revenue  generated  from  new  connections  and \nincremental energy sales. The project FIRR is 2.71% (Appendix 12). The pro forma net annual \nrevenues  are  generally  positive  and  cover  project  operating  expenses.  However,  with  a \nweighted average cost of capital at 4.77%, the financial returns of the investment do not exceed \ntotal  project  financing  cost.  Although  the  financial  performance  of  the  Project  is  marginal,  its \nimpact  on  EdL\u2019s  operation  is  minimal  compared to EdL\u2019s total domestic sales. Total projected \nenergy sales from the project areas are only 8% of EdL\u2019s projected domestic turnover in 2010. A \nmore meaningful measure of project performance in this case is the average cost recovery ratio \n(i.e.,  financial  benefit-cost  ratio).  Based  on  the  projected  real  tariffs  in  2005,  the  Project\u2019s  cost \nrecovery  ratio  is  95%,  indicating  that  95%  of  total  project  capital  and  operating  costs  are \nrecovered directly from sales revenue, and is considered satisfactory given  the nature of rural \nelectrification programs. \n\n54. \nA  low  FIRR  raises  the  important  question  of  how  the  Project  can  be  sustained  so  that \neconomic  benefits  will  continue  to  materialize  and  accrue  to  the  targeted  beneficiaries.  Rural \nelectrification  alone  is  rarely  financially  viable  in  developing  member  countries  and  often \nrequires  cross-subsidization  from  other  consumer  groups.  While  retail  tariff  for  almost  all  Lao \nconsumer groups will be below the long-run marginal cost when connections begin, the cross-\nsubsidy  needs  to  come  from  another  source  within  EdL  or  directly  from  the  Government.  The \ncurrent  Lao  PDR\u2019s  fiscal  problems  prevent  an  explicit  subsidy  transfer  from  the  Government. \nEdL  earns  additional  revenue  (in  dollars  and  baht)  from  exporting  surplus  energy  to  Thailand. \nEven  as  more  energy  is  required  domestically,  exports  to  Thailand  will  remain  a  significant \nportion  of  EdL\u2019s  turnover  as  new  generation  is  commissioned  and  connected  to  EdL\u2019s  supply \nsystem.  This  export  revenue  boosts  EdL\u2019s  financial  performance,  hedges  a  portion  of  EdL\u2019s \nforeign  exchange  risks,  and  helps  EdL  meet  its  financial  obligations  to  lenders  and  the \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nGovernment.  Export  revenue  is,  in  effect,  a  government  subsidy  to  EdL  for  carrying  out  rural \nelectrification  and  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  be  sustainable  despite  its  marginal  financial \nperformance. \n \nB. \n\nProject Impacts \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  for  the  Project.  A  summary \n55. \nIEE is in Appendix 13.  The IEE concluded that only minor potential impacts would be expected \nbecause of the following: \n\nThe transmission lines will pass through areas where people engage in hunting, \nlogging, and shifting cultivation. \n\nThe route was selected to avoid environmentally sensitive areas and areas with \nsocial, historical, and culture value. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nPotential for resettlement is minimal. \n\n \n(iii) \n \n(iv)  Measures are available to mitigate potential impacts. \n\n56.  Wherever  possible,  the  115  kV  lines  will  be  parallel  and  close  to  existing  roads  to \nminimize  environmental  impacts.  Mature  forests  and  other  environmentally  sensitive  areas  will \nbe  avoided.  Construction  will  have  other  minor  and  temporary  impacts,  but  measures  are \nproposed to mitigate them. \n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n57. \nThe social assessment carried out in the feasibility study identified the need to prepare a \nresettlement  plan.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  only  a  short \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  because  the  Project  will  have  insignificant21  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts.  The  plan  incorporates  the  Government\u2019s  national  policy  on  resettlement \nand compensation, decree on resettlement and compensation, and implementation regulations \nfor  project-related  resettlement  and  compensation.22  The  plan  is  summarized  in  Appendix  14 \nand will be updated after the detailed design and measurement survey and approval by ADB. \n\n58. \nEdL  has  made  every  effort  to  minimize  land  acquisition  impacts  by  avoiding  wherever \npossible  villages  and  other  settlement  areas,  agricultural  land,  and  trees.  Sites  that  will  be \nacquired for the three substations and one \u201cT\u201d tap junction will affect only scrubland. Only two \nhouses that may be affected by a 115 kV line will have to relocate nearby. A minimum amount \nof  mainly  nonagricultural  land  will  be  required  for  115  kV  towers.  Farmers  will  still  be  able  to \ncultivate  under  the  transmission  lines  and  towers.  Electric  poles  and  lines  will  be  adjacent  to \nexisting roads between villages, and along roads and pathways in villages. The construction of \nlow- and medium-voltage distribution systems will entail height restrictions to 3 meters for trees \nand  structures,  requiring  some  trees  to  be  cut.  Actual  impacts  of  transmission  and  distribution \n\n                                                 \n21  Resettlement  is  \u201csignificant\u201d  where  200  or  more  persons  are  displaced  from  their  houses  and/or  lose  more  than \n\n10% of their productive income-generating assets. \n\n22  Draft  documents  prepared  under  ADB  Loan  1867:  Environment  and  Social  Program,  for  $20  million,  approved \nNovember 2001; and TA 3746-LAO. Final documents were approved and issued by Government in May 2003. \n\n\f15 \n\nlines will be determined only during detailed design. The short resettlement plan provides for full \ncompensation  for  all  losses  and  relocation.  All  compensation  and  resettlement  for  a \nsubcomponent  will  have  to  be  completed,  rehabilitation  measures  in  place,  and  the  contract \narea free of all encumbrances before award of the civil works contract for that component. \n\n59. \nEdL has a well-established land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement procedure, \nwhich  is  not  always  implemented  well  because  of  limited  staff  and  capacity.  EdL  has  also \ndeveloped  a  comprehensive  public  involvement  program  for  people  affected  by  projects,  but \nrequires  adequate  staff  to  implement  the  program  well.  EdL  has  established  the  Environment \nand  Social  Management  Office,  with  an  experienced  environmental  specialist  manager,  three \nenvironment specialists, and one social development specialist. The Project will strengthen this \noffice\u2019s  capacity  by  helping  EdL  recruit  and  train  another  social  development  specialist  and \nanother rural development specialist. \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Impacts  \n\n60.  More  than  43%  of  the  project  beneficiaries  are  poor.  Many  more  live  just  above  the \npoverty  line  and  are  in  danger  of  falling  below  it.  They  live  mainly  by  engaging  in  subsistence \nagriculture  and  providing  manual  labor,  and  are  thus  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  such  as \nnatural disasters and poor economic growth. While energy is a major input into the livelihood of \nthe poor, they rely on high-cost sources such as diesel for lighting and batteries for radios, and \nmanual energy. Fuel poverty is a major  burden, especially for women, who supply the manual \nenergy  to  process  food.  Fuel  poverty  also  constrains  the  livelihoods  of  the  poor,  restricts \ncommerce,  and  reduces  the  ability  of  the  poor  to  diversify  their  income  sources.  Most  rural \nvillages have rice mills that run on diesel. The high cost of diesel is transferred to consumers, \nwhich  results  to  high  costs  of  using  rice  mills  and  thus  deter  the  poorest  from  using  more \nmodern and cheaper ways to process food. \n\nThe  most  immediate  and  direct  project  impact  on  the  poor  includes  reducing  cash \n61. \nexpenditure on energy. Unelectrified poor households spend from $1.00 to $1.25 per month on \ndiesel  for  lighting,  or  from  14%  to  18%  of  total  cash  household  income.  Connecting  poor \nhouseholds  will  immediately  reduce  cash  expenditure  to  about  $0.03,  or  less  than  0.25%  of \ncash income, so that scarce and fungible cash income can be diverted to other more beneficial \nexpenditure  items.  As  poor  households\u2019  electricity  consumption  is  likely  to  increase  as \nappliances become more affordable, expenditure on electricity will increase to around from 2 to \n3% of household income, normally within the first 2 years of electrification. \n\n62. \nOther  benefits  of  village  electrification  include  reduced  reliance  on  manual  energy  to \nprocess food, which gives women more time and significantly reduces their workload, whether \nthe  household  is  electrified  or  not.  National  data  show  that  women  living  in  villages  with  no \nelectricity spend approximately 14 hours a week processing food. Much time is spent manually \nprocessing  rice,  which  could  be  done  by  rice  mills.  In  villages  with  electricity,  food  processing \ntakes only 5 hours. Access to electricity may also improve social services, including education \nand health services, as children can study at night, and vaccines and other medications can be \nstored  safely  even  in  remote  villages.  Electric  lighting  at  night  will  also  keep  households  safe \nfrom wild animals and robbers. More people will enjoy social interaction and leisure when they \ncan  stay  out  longer  in  the  evenings.  Villagers  mentioned  that  they  would  receive  more \ninformation  from  the  outside  world  through  television.  While  the  social  benefits  are  difficult  to \nquantify,  they  reflect  improved  quality  of  life  and  save  money.  Many  social  benefits  have  a \n\u201cpublic good\u201d character and are not limited to connected households. The detailed results of the \npoverty impact assessment are in Appendix 15. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nC. \n\nProject Risks  \n\n63. \nThe  major  risks  facing  the  Project  are  the  following:  (i)  incomplete  implementation  of \nEdL\u2019s  FRP,  including  retail  tariff  increases;  (ii)  poor  households\u2019  inability  to  pay  connection \ncharges;  (iii)  delayed  consultant  appointment  and  bid  evaluation  processing;  and  (iv) \nunsatisfactory  implementation  of  an  approved  resettlement  plan  before  civil  works  start.  To \nmitigate  these  risks,  a  number  of  measures,  including  associated  loan  covenants,  have  been \ndevised,  involving  the  following:  (i)  financial  covenants  binding  the  Government  and  EdL  to \nimplement  the  FRP;  (ii)  government  commitment  to  amortize  up-front  charges  for  poor \nhouseholds  and  officially  approve  the  new  connection  policy;  and  (iii)  advance  recruitment  of \nconsultants and advance procurement actions.  \n\nD. \n\nOverall Assessment  \n\n64. \nThe  project  scope  and  estimated  costs  were  established  by  a  detailed  feasibility  study \nand found to be technically sound and appropriate. The Project\u2019s physical components form part \nof EdL\u2019s least-cost development plan, and technologies applied are reliable. Actions have been \nproposed to  minimize  and  mitigate  potential  project  risks  or  minor  social  and  environmental \nimpacts. The Project will fulfill the criteria for poverty intervention. Economic analysis has also \nshown  that  the  Project  will  have  robust  economic  returns.  The  Project  will,  therefore,  be \ntechnically and economically sustainable. \n\nD. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  EdL  have  given  the \n\n65. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents: \n\nFinancial Matters \n\n1. \n\n(i) \n\nThe Government will ensure or cause EdL to ensure the following: \n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n(h) \n\ncontinue  to  implement  EdL\u2019s  FRP  and  revise  EdL\u2019s  capital  expenditure \nprogram annually;  \nmaintain  a  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  at  least  1.5  for  FY2003  and \nthereafter;  \ngenerate  internal  cash  of  at  least  30%  of  the  three-year  average  of \nplanned capital expenditures in FY2003 and thereafter;  \nmaintain a debt-equity ratio of 1.5 or below; \nreduce EdL\u2019s accounts receivable for domestic electricity sales equivalent \nto 2 months\u2019 average sales by FY2003 and maintain this level thereafter; \nmaintain  levels  of  electricity  tariffs  for  EdL  to  meet  its  financial  loan \ncovenants in FY2005 and thereafter; \nmaintain the lifeline tariff block for residential consumers at no more than \n50 kWh/month; and \noffset  government,  provincial,  and  municipal  receivables  (including \narrears as of 31 December 2002) above 2 months\u2019 average sales against \nEdL\u2019s tax and other financial liabilities with the Government every quarter \nin  2004  and  2005,  and  submit  quarterly  statements  to  ADB  concerning \nthese settlements.  \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n2. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n3. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Government  will  arrange  additional  financing  as  required  for  EdL  to  meet \nassurances set out in (b), (c), and (d) of (i) for FY 2003 and thereafter. \nThe  Government  and  EdL  will  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart  funds  are \navailable on time to meet all local-cost components of the Project. \nUnless it complies with covenants contained in (a), (b), (c), and (h) of (i) for fiscal \n2003  and  thereafter,  EdL  will  not  declare  any  dividend  to  the  Government. \nCompliance with (a), (b), and (c) will be certified by audited financial statements \nfor  the  fiscal  year.  Compliance  with  (h)  will  be  monitored  by  EdL  and  ADB \nquarterly. \n\nSocial, Environmental, and Resettlement Matters \n\nEdL  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  fully  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nthe  Government\u2019s  environmental  regulations \nAssessment  Guidelines  and \nthroughout  project  implementation,  and  meet  the  mitigation  and  monitoring \nrequirements described in the IEE.  Project budget will be set aside to implement \nthe mitigation measures identified in the IEE to the satisfaction of ADB.  \nFull census and inventory of lost assets of people affected by the Project will be \nundertaken following detailed design during project implementation. An updated \nresettlement plan will be prepared and submitted to ADB for approval before land \nacquisition for those components. \nThe  updated  resettlement  plan  approved  by  ADB  will  be  implemented  to  its \nsatisfaction.  Before  the  award  of  civil  works  contract  for  each  component,  all \npeople \nit  affects  will  be  satisfactorily  compensated  and  resettled,  and \nrehabilitation  measures  will  be  in  place  in  accordance  with  the  updated \nresettlement  plan,  government  procedures,  and  ADB's    policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement. \nContractors  will  not  pay  men  and  women  unequal  wages  for  equal  work.  Child \nlabor will not permitted under the Project. \nEdL  will  submit  a  detailed  implementation  plan  of  the  PPME  for  ADB\u2019s  review \nand  concurrence  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  and  annual  PPME \nreports within 1 month after the end of each calendar year. \nEdL  will  assign  at  least  one  staff  at  each  provincial  branch  office  by  the  end  of \n2003 to be responsible for social and environmental management. \n\nOperational Matters \n\nEdL will use its own funds to continually carry out the loss reduction program and \nensure that the total domestic distribution loss will be less than 17% by the end of \n2003, 16% by 2004, and 15% by 2005, and maintain those levels thereafter. EdL \nwill  annually  submit  to  ADB  the  progress  report  on  the  LRU\u2019s  operations and \nmanagement and the statistics of total system losses . \nEdL will annually prepare and provide to ADB for its review and comment a draft \npower development plan for all capital expenditures planned for the subsequent \n10 years, including EdL\u2019s load  forecast, investment requirements for generation, \ntransmission, and distribution; indicative financing assumptions; and its financial \nprojections over the same period. \nEdL will continue to implement the MIH policy under which EdL will fund 100% of \nthe low-voltage distribution costs for villages.  \nEdL  will  issue  information  on  the  amortization  option  for  residential  consumers \nwith 3/9 ampere meter connections to all branch offices and consumers at least 2 \nmonths  before  connections  are  made.  Amortization  will  apply  to  all  EdL \n\n \n\n\f(v) \n\nresidential consumers with 3/9 ampere meter connections, including consumers \nin areas not supported by ADB, by the end of 2003. \nAt least 2 months before connections are made, EdL will implement a consumer \nawareness  campaign  on  the  safe  use  of  electricity,  billing  practices,  and \nconnection policy. \nEdL will establish a socioeconomic cell and assign appropriate counterpart staff \nto train in systematic data collection, benefit monitoring, and economic modeling. \n(vii)  EdL  will  strengthen  its  Environmental  and  Social  Management  Office  by \nengaging  at  least  one  social  development  specialist  and  one  rural  development \nspecialist by the end of 2003. \n\n(vi) \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n65.

\n \n\nThe  power  sector  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  is  still  in  its \n1. \ninfancy, with only 34% of households having access to electricity, according to the Hydropower \nOffice,  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Handicraft  (MIH).  The  sector  has  the  potential  to  be  pivotal  in \nachieving  the  Government\u2019s  social  and  economic  development  objectives  by  expanding  the \navailability of low-cost, reliable electricity within the country and earning foreign exchange from \nsales  to  the  region.  The  power  sector  policy  encourages  optimal  use  of  the  country\u2019s  natural \nresources,  promoting  efficiency  in  power  sector  institutions  and  creating  a  conducive \nenvironment for responsible infrastructure investment, public and private.  \n \nB. \n\nPower System Facilities and Operations \n\n2. \nThe  power  system  facilities  cover  the  Northern,  Central  1,  Central  2,  and  Southern \nregions,  serving  about  250,000  customers.  The  largest  two  regions,  Northern  and  Central  1, \nwhich  cover  Vientiane  Prefecture  and  Vientiane  and  Louang  Phrabang  provinces,  as  well  as \nother surrounding areas, are supplied from the Nam Ngum hydropower station (150 megawatts \n[MW])  and  partly  from  the  recently  completed  Nam  Leuk  hydropower  station  (60  MW).  The \nsouthern region covers Saravan and Champassak provinces and is supplied from the Xeset (45 \nMW)  and  Selabam  (5  MW)  hydropower  stations.  Existing  power  grids  for  these  areas  are \ninterconnected  with  the  power  grid  in  Thailand  to  export  electricity  generated  in  excess  of \ndomestic  demand.  Central  2,  which  covers  Khammouane  and  Savannakhet  provinces,  is \nsupplied  from  Thailand  through  22-kilovolt  (kV)  submarine  cables  across  the  Mekong  River. \nScattered small generating sets (hydro and diesel) with a total installed capacity approximately \nof 10 MW also provide limited supply serving small communities. The Lao PDR power stations \nare listed in Table A3.1. \n\nTable A3.1: Power Stations in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic  \n\n \n\n \nNo. \n\n \nOwners \n\n \nRegions \n\nAverage \nGeneration \n(GWh/year) \n\n \nInstalled \nCapacity (MW) \n\n \nPower \nStation \n1  Nam Ngum 1 \n2  Selabam \n3  Xeset 1 \n4  Nam Dong \n5  Nam Phao \n6  Nam Ko \n7  Theun Hinboun \n8  Houay Ho \n9  Nam Leuk \n \n \nTotal   \nEdL = Electricit\u00e9 du Laos, GWh = gigawatt-hour, IPP = independent power producer, MW = megawatt.  \nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Laos.  \n\nEdL \nEdL \nEdL \nEdL \nProvincial \nProvincial \nIPP \nIPP \nEdL \n \n \n\nCentral 1 \nSouthern \nSouthern \nCentral 1 \nCentral 1 \nNorthern \nCentral 1 \nSouthern \nCentral 1 \n \n \n\n \nCommissioning \nYear \n1971/78/84 \n1970/93 \n1991 \n1970 \n1995 \n1997 \n1998 \n1999 \n2000 \n \n \n\n150.0 \n5.0 \n45.0 \n1.0 \n1.6 \n1.5 \n210.0 \n150.0 \n60.0 \n \n624.1 \n\n998 \n24 \n180 \n5 \n- \n- \n1620 \n617 \n230 \n \n3674 \n\n3. \nThe  standard  of  transmission  system  voltage  is  divided  into  three  levels:  230  kV  for \nindependent power producer (IPP) projects producing for export, and 115 kV for domestic high-\nvoltage transmission lines; 22/34.5 kV for the medium-voltage distribution network; and 0.4 kV \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n23 \n\nfor  the  low-voltage  distribution  system.

Export of hydropower \nis the largest single foreign exchange earner for the country. The Government thus emphasizes \ndevelopment  of  export-oriented hydropower projects and mobilizing private sector investment. \nWith  external  assistance,  two  IPP  hydropower  projects  with  substantial  generating  capacities \nwere  completed  recently,  and  demand  for  electricity  for  domestic  use  and  export  is  growing \nrapidly. Table A3.4 shows Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) statistics on generation, and electricity sales \nfrom 1996 to 2000.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTable A3.4: Electricity Generation and Sales, 1996\u20132000  \n(million kWh) \n \n\n1996 \n\n1997 \n\n1998 \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n1248 \n87 \n792 \n379 \n\n1219 \n102 \n710 \n433 \n\n948 \n142 \n405 \n513 \n\n1169 \n172 \n598 \n565 \n\n1579 \n160 \n863 \n639 \n\nGrowth Rate \n(%) \n6.1 \n16.4 \n2.2 \n14.0 \n\n \nCategory \nGeneration \nImports \nExport \nDomestic Consumption \n\n \nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Laos. \n\nPower Sector Development \n\n6. \nElectricity is supplied through main grids and off grid. Three sources provide generation \nfor EdL main grids: (i) small or medium-sized power generation projects, generally up to about \n100  MW,  developed  by  EdL  primarily  to  supply  the  national  market;  (ii)  domestic  off-take \nentitlements  from  IPPs;  and  (iii)  imports  from  neighboring  countries  (Thailand  and  Viet  Nam). \nGeneration  for  export  is  provided  from  two  sources:  (i)  surplus  electricity  from  EdL\u2019s  domestic \nhydropower projects and (ii) IPP hydropower projects. \n \n7. \nUnserved  areas  are  targeted  by  grid  extension  projects,  off-grid  development,  and \ndomestic  off-take  entitlements  from  IPP  projects.  Grid  extension  is  used  to  supply  the  main \ncenters and densely populated areas on the floodplains of the Mekong and its tributaries. Off-\ngrid  electrification  through  isolated  grids\u2014from  provincial  and  town  to  multi-  and  single-village \ngrids\u2014is  more  advantageous  than  a  high-cost  grid  extension  thinly  distributed  over  difficult \nterrain.  \n \n8. \nLess  than  20%  of  villages  have  electricity,  which  limits  commercialization  and \ndiversification of the economy. Poverty incidence strongly correlates with the lack of electricity. \nThe  Government  thus  gives  electrification  high  priority,  particularly  in  rural  areas, and expects \nthat by 2010 70% of the population will have electricity.  \n \n9. \nThe  financial  and  technical  resources  needed  to  expand  export  capacity  and  extend \nrural  electrification  are  far  beyond  the  Government\u2019s  means  and  requires  partnership  between \npublic and private investors. This partnership, however, will depend on reforms and measures to \nstrengthen  the  energy  sector  and  to  ensure  that  the  people  share  equitably  in  the  benefits  of \nhydropower development. \n  \n10. \nGiven  the  pivotal  economic  role  of  the  power  sector, the Government has focused on \nharnessing  private  sector  resources  to  accelerate  power  development.  As  part  of  the  market-\noriented economic restructuring, foreign capital is encouraged and regulated. \n \n11. \nThe  Government  has  restructured  and  commercialized  power  sector  institutions  to \nenhance  their  operating  efficiency.  EdL,  the  state-owned  national  power  utility,  is  being \ncommercialized through the following measures: (i) EdL was incorporated as a public company \nunder  a  charter  approved  by  MIH  on  29  December  1997;  (ii)  EdL  average  retail  tariffs  were \nincreased by 3.0% per month from 1999 to 2001 and again by 2.3% per month starting in May \n2002  through  April  2005;  (iii)  EdL  signed  a  performance  contract  plan  for  2001-2003 with the \n\n \n\n \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n25 \n\nMinistry  of  Finance  and  MIH  in  February  2001,  which  establishes  targets  for  EdL\u2019s  technical, \ncommercial,  and  financial  performance;  commits  the  Government  to  improve  EdL\u2019s  financial \nviability (including through tariff increases); and provides for monitoring of compliance by MIH; \n(iv) Reorganized into profit centers, EdL introduced formal cost accounting and internal transfer \npricing for each profit center; (v) Formal auditing practices have been adopted and an external \nauditing  firm  engaged  beginning  in  1998;  and  (vi)  A  loss  reduction  unit  has  been  established \nand investments are being made to reduce losses. \n\nD. \n\nKey Development Challenges \n\n12. \nPower potential should be harnessed to best serve the people\u2019s interests, especially to \nreduce poverty by promoting sustainable economic growth. Large-scale projects can and should \nbe  supported  if  community  groups  displaced  by  such  projects  are  fully  compensated,  if  the \nenvironmental  effects  are  carefully  assessed  and  mitigated,  and  if  the  net  benefits  are  shared \nequitably  between  investors  and  the  people  as  owners  of  the  resources.  The  revenues \ngenerated from increased export earnings will be vital to improving basic government services, \nincluding education, health, and infrastructure services in poor areas. \n\n13. \nThe  development  strategy  should  distinguish  between  the  appropriate  roles  for  the \npublic  and  private  sectors,  taking  account  of  the  Lao  PDR\u2019s  continuing  transition  to  a  market-\nbased economy. The private sector should be encouraged to invest in electricity generation and \ndistribution,  leaving  the  Government  to  focus  on  the  regulatory  framework  and  overall \ntransmission system.  \n\n14. \nOther management issues also demand public attention and resolution. Electricity use is \nhighly  subsidized  and,  despite  monthly  increases  in  domestic  tariffs  since  early  1999,  full cost \nrecovery is still distant. EdL thus has a serious debt burden, which also reflects EdL\u2019s history of \nborrowing  unprotected  for  exchange  rate  risk.  The  sharp  devaluation  of  the  kip  following  the \nAsian  financial  crisis  has  greatly  deepened  EdL\u2019s  problems.  EdL  must  be  strengthened \nfinancially and made more efficient. \n\n15. \nThe  Government  is  an  investor  in  power  development  and  the  regulator  of  the  sector, \nwhich leads to conflicting interests. The Government\u2019s encouragement of social and economic \ndevelopment through electrification at highly subsidized tariffs, for example, is counter to sound \npower management and EdL\u2019s commercial viability. If the Government wishes to be a regulator \nand  an  investor,  then  it  should  establish  an  institutional  framework  that  ensures  that  the  two \nroles do not conflict. \n\n16. \nInternational  best  practices  should  help  determine  the  right  course  of  action.  The \nGovernment has drawn from these practices, notably adjusting the pricing system to harmonize \nwith cost recovery principles. The Government is also restructuring EdL\u2019s debt obligations and \ninitiating  other  institutional  and  regulatory  matters  central  to  sound  management  of  the  power \nsector.  EdL  has  successfully  engaged  the  private  sector  as  a  partner  in  power  development. \nHowever, the Government should consider consolidating this experience, drawing benefits from \npower  projects  through  concession  fees,  royalties,  and  taxation.  Seeking  a  large  ownership \nposition  through  equity  participation  can  be  risky,  and  may  not  conform  to  EdL\u2019s  or  the \nGovernment\u2019s financial interests. \n\n \n\n\fTechnical Assistance \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPREVIOUS ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SECTOR \n \n\n \n Loan \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nProject   \n\n \n  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nAmount  \n \n    ($) \n\nDate of \nApproval \n\n26 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n65-LAO \n128-LAO(SF) \n501-LAO(SF) \n642-LAO(SF) \n698-LAO(SF) \n846-LAO(SF) \n928-LAO(SF) \n\n1063-LAO(SF) \n1214-LAO(SF) \n1308-LAO(SF) \n \n1329-LAO(SF) \n1456-LAO(SF) \n1558-LAO(SF) \n \n\n275-LAO \n374-LAO \n909-LAOa \n1080-LAO \n \n1081-LAO \n \n1082-LAO \n \n1221-LAO \n \n1301-LAOb \n \n909-LAOc \n1532-LAOd \n \n1548-LAO \n1301-LAOb \n\nVientiane Power Distribution \nVientiane Power Distribution (supplementary) \nVientiane Plain Rural Electrification \nVientiane Plain Rural Electrification (phase II) \nXeset Hydropower (TA loan) \nXeset Hydropower \nNam Ngum -Louang Phrabang Power \nTransmission \nXeset Hydropower (supplementary) \nNam Song Hydropower Development \nNam Ngum -Louang Phrabang Power \nTransmission (supplementary) \nTheun-Hinboun Hydropower Project \nNam Leuk Hydropower Project \nPower Transmission and Distribution \n\nTotal \n\nVientiane Plain Rural Electrification \nXeset Hydropower \nXeset Hydropower (implementation) \nXieng Khouang and Sayaburi Power \nTransmission Study \nNam Ngum Hydropower Station \nOperational Study \nInstitutional Improvement to EdL \nLouang Phrabang \nNam Song-Nam Leuk Hydropower  \nDevelopment Feasibility Study \nNam Ngum -Louang Phrabang Power \nTransmission \nXeset Hydropower (supplementary) \nNam Song-Nam Leuk Hydropower  \nDevelopment Feasibility Study \nNam Mang 3 Prefeasibility Study \nNam Ngum -Louang Phrabang Power \nTransmission  \nSupplementary \nTheun-Hinboun Power Legal Power \nPower Transmission and Distribution \nCorporate and Financial Development of EdL \nPower System Planning in the Ministry of \nIndustry and Handicraft \nStudy for Establishing Lao  \nNational Grid Company \nNorthern Area Rural Power Distribution Project  \nNam Ngum 500 kV Transmission Project \nPower Distribution \nPower Sector Strategy Study \n\n \n2054-LAO \n2479-LAOd \n2569-LAOd \n2583-LAOd \n \n2728-LAOd \n \n3087-LAOd \n2926-LAOd \n \n3374-LAOd \n \nEdL = Electricit\u00e9 du Laos, kV = kilovolt, TA = technical assistance. \na   United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) funds. \nb  Swiss funds. \nc  Norwegian funds. \nd  Japan special funds. \n\nTotal \n\n \n\n3,370,000 \n1,350,100 \n4,300,000 \n6,300,000 \n1,000,000 \n15,500,000 \n11,000,000 \n\n3,000,000 \n31,500,000 \n \n4,000,000 \n60,000,000 \n52,000,000 \n30,000,000 \n223,320,000 \n\n140,000 \n246,000 \n1,760,000 \n \n85,000 \n \n192,000 \n \n198,000 \n \n500,000 \n \n960,000 \n1,000,000 \n \n1,300,000 \n50,000 \n \n\n1,034,000 \n100,000 \n250,000 \n340,000 \n \n600,000 \n \n600,000 \n580,000 \n510,000 \n \n800,000 \n11,245,000 \n\n06 May 1971 \n03 May 1971 \n19 Dec 1980 \n11 Oct 1983 \n23 Oct 1984 \n27 Oct 1987 \n06 Dec 1988 \n\n11 Dec 1990 \n21 Dec 1992 \n \n30 Aug 1994 \n08 Nov 1994 \n10 Sept 1996 \n30 Sept 1997 \n \n\n22 Dec 1978 \n14 Nov 1980 \n27 Oct 1987 \n \n03 Jan 1989 \n \n03 Jan 1989 \n \n03 Jan 1989 \n \n10 Nov 1989 \n \n29 Mar 1989 \n14 Dec 1990 \n \n08 Jul 1991 \n07 Aug 1991 \n \n\n14 Oct 1992 \n04 Jan 1994 \n18 Dec 1995 \n15 May 1996 \n \n07 Jun 1996 \n \n23 Dec 1996 \n28 Nov 1997 \n14 Oct 1998  \n \n23 Dec 1999 \n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n27 \n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS OF ELECTRICIT\u00c9 DU LAOS \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe financial performance of Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) since 1998 has been  significantly \n1. \naffected  by  the  depreciation  of  the  kip  during  the  Asian  financial  crisis.

The depreciation of the kip has resulted in large foreign \nexchange  losses  on  loans,  which  must  be  serviced  from  EdL\u2019s  kip-denominated  cash  flow. \nEdL\u2019s profitability in the last several years is attributed to nonoperating income (dividends from \nthe  Theun-Hinboun  Power  Company,  of  which  EdL  owns  60%),  which  covers  the  foreign \nexchange losses on existing debt. EdL\u2019s operating efficiency and tariff levels should, therefore, \nbe assessed. \n\n3. \nWhile  it  has  remained  positive,  EdL\u2019s  cash  flow  from  internal  sources  has  been \ndecreasing in recent years. This trend can be partly attributed to the declining share of export \nrevenue,  denominated  in  dollars  and  baht,  which  has  helped  mitigate  some  of  EdL\u2019s  foreign \nexchange losses. As the share of electricity exported declines relative to domestic sales, cash \nflow  decreases  as  domestic  tariffs  do  not  cover  the  full  cost  of  service.  Technical  losses,  low \ntariffs,  and  low  collection  of  accounts  receivable  need  to  be  addressed.  Accounts  receivable \nhave  remained  significantly  above  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  covenant  level  of  2 \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nC. \n\nTariffs  \n\nmonths\u2019 worth of  sales, mostly attributable to unpaid government sales (11.0 months in 2001) \nand domestic sales (4.5 months). \n\n4. \nLow average retail tariffs contributed to the poor performance of EdL as it expanded its \nelectrification  rate.  While  revenues  from  export  sales  cross-subsidized  these  domestic  sales \nover the past several years, declining export revenue will expose EdL\u2019s weak financial position \nand the need for significant retail tariff restructuring. \n\nEdL  carried  out  a  detailed  tariff  study1  in  late  2001,  which  justified  applying  for  a  new \n5. \ntariff  increase  with  the  Government.  This  tariff  report  indicated  that  the  long-run marginal cost \nfor  EdL  was  approximately  KN741  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  in  2002.  The  tariff  study  also \nanalyzed the appropriate lifeline tariff (now set at 50 kWh) and revenue analysis as required for \nEdL to meet its loan covenants in the next couple of years.

The plan was developed with assistance from the World Bank and \nADB, EdL\u2019s key creditors. The FRP underscores the Government\u2019s commitment to EdL and the \npower sector, provides financial terms to encourage further rural electrification and expansion of \nthe  national  grid,  and  puts  EdL  on  commercial  footing.  The  FRP  includes  the  following \nprovisions: \n                                                 \n1 Power Supply Tariff Study \u2013 Final Report, February 2002, EdL. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n29 \n\nConversion  of  Electricit\u00e9  du  Laos  Debt  to  Equity.  The  Government  converted  $69 \n7. \nmillion  of  EdL  debt  into  government  equity  in  2001,  including  the  re-lent  proceeds  of  Loan \n1329.2 This conversion was equivalent to the Government injecting additional equity capital into \nEdL, which was needed to reduce its debt leverage.  \n\n8. \nVariable Remittance to the Government as Taxes and Dividends. The Government \nagrees  that  EdL  can  retain  dividends  from  its  subsidiary  investments,  notably  Theun  Hinboun \nPower Company (THPC), to ensure that EdL complies with the financial loan covenants of the \nWorld Bank and ADB. Should EdL comply, it pays 29% of total net income as dividends to the \nGovernment,  giving  EdL  more  flexibility  in  managing  its  finances  and  the  ability  to  reinvest \ndividends  in  capital  expansion.  ADB  supports  this  agreement  but  EdL  needs  to  discuss  a \nlonger-term solution with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) on the dividends to ensure proper equity \ncapitalization. \n\n9. \nRevaluation of Fixed Assets. The Government agreed to revalue 100% of fixed assets \ndirectly related to power generation, transmission, and distribution. ADB deemed the revaluation \nstudy acceptable as it was incorporated into a comprehensive financial restructuring plan, and \nasset  revaluation  will  be  permitted  for  all  Lao  businesses  in  the  future.  The  final  study  report \nwas  completed  in  November  2002,  and  the  results  are  being  translated  in  the  2002  financial \nstatements.  Asset  revaluation  will  substantially  increase  the  depreciation  expense  of  EdL, \nthereby reducing its net income and tax liability with the Government. \n\n10. \nRelaxation of Repayment Terms of Subsidiary Loan Agreements. In 2001 MOF and \nEdL amended most of its subsidiary loan agreements with World Bank and ADB. These steps \ninclude reducing interest rates and extending repayment terms by five years on existing loans. \nThe  amendments  are  reasonable,  considering  the  extended  terms  are  only  a  temporary \nrelaxation.  EdL\u2019s  debt  service  burden  is  reduced  until  other  financial  measures  can  be \nimplemented,  improving  EdL\u2019s  operational  cash  flow.  ADB  formally  approved  the  amended \nagreements  in  January  2003.  EdL  agreed  to  involve  ADB  in  any  future  plans  for  debt \nrestructuring. \n\n11.  Maintenance  of  Electricity  Tariffs  to  Meet  Electricit\u00e9  du  Laos\u2019s  Financial \nObjectives.  After  conducting  a  tariff  study  in  2002,  the  Government  agreed  to  a  schedule  of \nretail  electricity  tariff  increases  starting  in  May  2002.  Tariffs  will  increase  for  all  consumer \nclasses at 2.3% per month (a compounded annualized rate of 31.0%) through April 2005. This \nschedule  will  increase  tariffs  to  approximately  KN612/kWh  ($.053/kWh)  in  2005  (Table  A5.2). \nWhile still below full cost recovery, this decision clearly indicates the Government\u2019s support for \nEdL to become a more commercial entity. The Government agreed to fully implement the tariff \nschedule  as  planned,  and  EdL  will  inform  ADB  of  any  deviation  from  the  plan,  as  it  would \nsignificantly affect long-term financial performance. \n\n12. \nReview  of  Electricit\u00e9  du  Laos\u2019s  Capital  Expenditure  Program.  EdL  has  agreed  to \nregularly review its capital expenditure program (officially, EdL\u2019s Power Development Plan) and \nits ability to finance the expansion program through new debt and internal cash generation. ADB \nsupported this planning effort through TA 3374-LAO: Power Sector Strategy Study. The World \nBank  is  also  funding  a  study  to  update  the  recommendations  and  analysis  based  on  recent \nchanges.  EdL  will  annually  update  a  more  robust  and  analytical  power  development plan by \nconsidering  short-  and  long-term  strategy,  combined  planning  of  domestic  and  export \n\n                                                 \n2 ADB. 1994.

These developments will reduce technical, commercial, and financial risks to EdL as it \nexpands its service. \n\nLimitation  on  the  period  of  debt-servicing  relief  to  Electricit\u00e9  du  Laos.  While  it \n13. \nstrongly  supports  EdL,  the  Government  also  stipulates  its  intent  to  consider  a  phased \nwithdrawal  of  financial  support  as  EdL\u2019s  operations  become  more  commercial  and  self-\nsustaining.  ADB  appreciates  the  Government\u2019s  limitation  to  provide  assistance  due  to  fiscal \nconstraints,  but  with  an  electrification  target  rate  of  90%  by  2020,  it is unlikely that EdL can \nfinance  this  expansion  without  additional  government  financing  assistance.  EdL  may  require \ngovernment equity injections (direct or through conversions to equity) to prevent it becoming too \nleveraged. This issue will be addressed when future power development plans are submitted to \nADB for review and comment. \n\n14.  Most of the FRP has already been implemented, and tariff increases began in May 2002. \nThis  is  the  Government\u2019s  strongest  signal  of  intent  to  support  EdL  and  transform  it  into  a \ncommercially viable organization. Other aspects (e.g. asset revaluation) are being translated in \nthe  2002  financial  statements.  EdL  agreed  to  ensure  full  implementation  of  the  FRP;  comply \nwith  ongoing  provisions  on  tariff  levels,  dividend  remittances,  and  capital  expenditure  review; \nand keep ADB informed of its completion. \n\nE. \n\nFuture Financial Performance  \n\n15. \nEdL\u2019s  projected  financial  statements  are  in  Table  A5.3.  EdL  has  greatly  improved  its \nfinancial  and  operational  performance  as  a  result  of  the  FRP  in  FY2002  (based  on  unaudited \nestimated results) and also because the Government applied the $33 million THPC proceeds3 to \noutstanding  liabilities  with  MOF.  Asset  revaluation  results  were  much  greater  than  initially \nestimated during the drafting of the FRP, so future financial performance appears to be stronger \nthan anticipated.  \n\n16. \nEdL\u2019s  financial  performance  depends  on  full  and  timely  retail  tariff  increases  and \nrationalization of the Power Development Plan. Tariffs will continue to increase until they reach \nan  estimated  equivalent  level  of  KN612/kWh  in  2005.  Tariffs  will,  at  minimum,  need  to  be \nmaintained at this level in real terms, meaning that further increases will be required after 2005 \nto  keep  pace  with  exchange  rate  movements.  EdL  is  planning  a  more  detailed  tariff  review  in \n2003  to  see  how  the  tariff  structure  and  rates  can  be  changed  to  eventually  move  toward  full \ncost recovery. \n\n17. \nProjections  for  some  of  EdL\u2019s  financial  ratios  (specifically,  debt  service  coverage  and \ndebt-equity ratio) are declining  from 2003 to 2010. While these ratios have been complied with \nfor  several  years,  their  deterioration  is  related  to  the  ambitious capital expenditure program to \nreach a nationwide electrification ratio of 90% in 2020. This plan assumes that debt will be used \nto  finance  expansion,  even  though  lenders  or  donors  do  not  appear  committed  to  finance  it. \nEven if this new debt is concessional, EdL\u2019s projected operations and growth may not sustain \nthe  required  debt  service.  EdL  agrees  to  review  and  update  its  capital  expansion  plan  and \ndevelop  financing  plans  (including  future  government  contributions  to  EdL  equity),  which \nindicates EdL\u2019s intent to remain financially viable. \n\n                                                 \n3 THPC refinanced its original financing package in May 2002 to take advantage of lower costs of debt than required \nfor financial close in 1996. THPC then returned 50% of the share capital to the owners, including EdL. Therefore, \n$33 million was returned to EdL in May 2002. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n31 \n\nEdL  agrees  to  financial  loan  covenants  consistent  with  previous  loans  and  to  maintain \n18. \noperational  and  financial  performance  so  that  these  covenants  are  met  annually.  ADB  will \nassess covenants based on audited financial statements submitted within nine months after the \nclose of EdL\u2019s fiscal year (31 December). The following indicates financial loan covenant levels \nand  steps  required  to  ensure  such  levels  are  met  during  project  implementation and principal \nrepayment. The Government also agrees that EdL will not remit any dividends until the audited \nfinancial  statements  certify  compliance  with  the  debt  service  coverage,  debt-equity,  self-\nfinancing, and government receivables settlement plan. \n\n19. \nSelf-Financing Ratio. EdL agrees to maintain a self-financing ratio of no less than 30%. \nThe  revaluation  of  assets  will  increase  allowable  depreciation  expense  and  reduce  EdL\u2019s  tax \nliabilities.  This  should  enhance  EdL\u2019s  ability  to  meet  its  self-financing  ratio  covenant,  but  the \ncapital  expenditure  plan  should  still  be  reviewed  regularly  to  ensure  that  it  does  not  strain \nfinancial performance.  \n\n20. \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio. EdL agrees to maintain net revenues of no less than 1.5 \ntimes annual debt service payments. This is an small increase from Loan 1558 covenants (1.3 \ntimes) to harmonize financial covenants with those of the World Bank. ADB recommends that \nEdL review its capital expenditure program to ensure that future projects are not financed with \nhigh  levels  of  debt,  which  will  jeopardize  financial  performance  once  the  grace  periods  on \nprincipal repayment end.  \n\n21. \nDebt-to-Equity Ratio: EdL agrees to maintain the ratio of its long-term debt to no more \nthan  1.5  times  its  equity.  ADB  believes  this  covenant  warrants  significant  attention.  EdL\u2019s \nfinancial  projections  and  capital  expenditure  plan  indicate  that  EdL  will  be  unable  to  meet  this \ncovenant after FY2004  due  to  the  large  amount  of  long-term debt assumed to finance capital \nexpansion. ADB requested MOF to ensure that the Government maintains significant equity in \nEdL  to  ensure  compliance.  As  long  as  EdL  maintains  the  Government\u2019s  shareholding  in \nindependent power producer projects, ADB will support EdL retaining Theun Hinboun dividends \nin the future. EdL\u2019s retention of these dividends is equivalent to future Government injections of \nequity, which will be required to sustain EdL\u2019s growth. \n\nAccounts  Receivable:  ADB  is  concerned  about  the  growing  accounts  receivable, \n22. \nmostly  with  central  government,  provincial,  and  municipal  offices.  The  Government  has  not \ncomplied  with  the  relevant  covenant  for  several  years.  While  ADB  is  cognizant  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal difficulties, EdL cannot function as a true commercial enterprise under the \nconditions  of  nonpayment  without  permission  to  terminate  electricity  service.  EdL  agrees  to \nreduce  its  overall  accounts  receivable  to  no  more  than  two months\u2019 average electricity sales. \nThe Government also agreed to offset EdL\u2019s arrears (calculated as of 31 December 2002) and \ncurrent government consumption above two months\u2019 average from EdL\u2019s tax and other financial \nliabilities with the Government. In May 2003 the Government confirmed that the first offsetting \npayment was made, and ADB and the Government have agreed on a schedule of consecutive \nquarterly  offsets  in  2004  and  2005  to  fully  settle  the  arrears.  Receivables  with  domestic \ncustomers  also  require  improvement.  EdL  is  introducing  a  new  billing  system  that  will  permit \nEdL  to  carry  out  more  detailed  analysis  and  aging  of  the  receivables,  and  increase  timely  bill \ncollection from delinquent customers.  \n\n23. \nThe completion of the FRP and other financially attractive beneficial transactions in 2002 \n(proceeds  from  THPC  refinancing  applied  to  outstanding  liabilities  with  the  Government)  have \n\nF. \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nhelped EdL recover from its financial crisis and become more stable. This position should allow \nEdL  operations  to  be  profitable  and  sustainable  for  the  next  several  years,  and  financial \nprojections  indicate  that  EdL  will  meet  its  loan  covenants  from  FY2002  to  2008,  based  on  the \ncapital expenditure plan approved in 2001.  \n\n24. \nCompliance  with  financial  covenants  could  become  a  problem,  however,  as  EdL \nattempts  to  balance  ambitious  capital  expansions  plans  (including  rural  electrification  projects \non  behalf  of  the  Government)  with  financial  performance  as  a  commercial  organization.  ADB \ncontinues to pursue financial improvements with EdL on operating efficiency and tariff increases \nand with MIH and MOF on sector structure and capitalization of EdL. ADB will ensure that the \ncapital  expansion  plans  are  reviewed  and  rationalized,  which  will  reduce  the  pressures  for \nadditional  and  excessive  foreign  debt  borrowings.  In  this  case,  the  risk  of  noncompliance  with \nloan covenants will be mitigated through the above assurances and covenant to ensure direct \ngovernment  financing  (equity  injections  of  cash)  when  and  as  required  to  ensure  a  financially \nsustainable EdL. \n\n \n\n\fTable A5.3: Income Statement \n(KN millions) \n\nYears\n\nDomestic turnover\n    Installation Fees and other Misc.

The Project consists of (i) construction of about 303 kilometers (km) of 115-kilovolt \n(kV)  transmission  lines,  including  shield-wire  distribution  at  34.5  kV;  (ii)  three  115.0,  34.5,  and \n22.0  kV  substations,  and  other  extension  work;  (iii)  construction  of  about  796  km  of  medium-\nvoltage  (34.5  and  22.0  kV)  distribution  lines  and  distribution  substations;  (iv)  construction  of \napproximately  608  km  of  low-voltage  [380-volt  (V)]  distribution  lines  and  transformers,  and \nconnection  of  about  33,800  households;  and  (v)  miscellaneous  work,  including  unexploded \nordnance  (UXO)  clearance,  benefit  monitoring  program,  and  resettlement  and  compensation \nprogram. \n\n2. \nA  team  of  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  help  EdL  implement  the  Project \nand improve the agency\u2019s project management capacity. Consultants will focus on supervising \nand guiding project implementation and training EdL staff, while EdL\u2019s project management unit \nwill  be  responsible  for  project  implementation.  The  team  will  include  transmission  and \ndistribution specialists, social and environmental management and monitoring specialists, and a \nUXO quality assurance specialist. The consultants will perform the above tasks in the Lao PDR \nto  improve  the  design  and  project  supervision  skills  of  EdL  staff  and,  where  possible,  will use \nlocal expertise.  \n\nConsultant  services  will  also  include  the  following  to  strengthen  EdL\u2019s  capacity  to \n\n3. \nundertake rural electrification: \n\n(i) \n\nCapacity  building  for  socioeconomic  assessment.  EdL  is  planning  to  establish  a \nsocioeconomic  cell  within  the  Environment  and  Social  Management  Office  to  improve \ncoordination  of  electrification  data  collection,  build  a  consumer  database,  and  build  in-\nhouse capacity for benefit monitoring. To use benefit monitoring data efficiently and build \ncapacity  to  evaluate  subprojects,  the  Nordic  Development  Fund  (NDF)  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) agreed to support capacity building for economic, social, and \npoverty  impact  assessments  of  subprojects.  The  capacity-building  component  will \ninclude  training  of  three  EdL  staff  in economic modeling for subproject evaluation. EdL \nwill  appoint  three  staff  to  the  socioeconomic  cell,  to  be  trained  under  the  program.  A \nnumber of field staff will be trained to collect subproject data to feed into the model. The \nconsultants  will  set  up  the computerized model, and establish a system for systematic \ndata  gathering,  including  standardized  questionnaires  for  socioeconomic  surveys  and \ntrain  staff.  The  system  will  ensure  that  benefit  monitoring  directly  feeds  into  subproject \ndesign  and  evaluation. The  Appraisal  Mission  estimates  that  approximately  3  person-\nmonths  will  be  required  to  set  up  the  model,  establish  systematic  data  gathering,  and \ntrain  staff.  Three  more  person-months  will  be  required  to  design  and  implement  the \nbenefit  monitoring  program.  EdL  agreed  to  use  NDF  credit  for  consulting  services  to \nbuild capacity for socioeconomic assessment and for the benefit monitoring program. \n \nConsumer awareness campaign. The consultants will help EdL design and implement \nan  information  and  awareness  campaign  on  safe  use  of  electricity.  The  awareness \ncampaign will also inform consumers of connection cost policy, tariffs, billing statements \nand  timing  of  bills  and  due  payment,  and  disconnection  policy.  The  campaign  will  be \nundertaken at least 2 months before connection and take into account language barriers. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n41 \n\nB. \n\nScope of Work \n\n1. \n\nEngineering Services \n\n4. \nThe  consultant  will  be  responsible  for  detailed  engineering;  preparation  of  bid \ndocuments;  assistance  in  bid  evaluation  and  contact  awarding;  and  supervision  of  installation \nwork, final testing, and commissioning.

The \nstatement emphasizes the need to strengthen and clarify the framework for independent power \nproducer  (IPP)  development  to  facilitate  and  promote  transparent  private  participation  in  the \npower sector. \n \nThe statement does not specify sector-strengthening strategies. These were explored at \n2. \na workshop held in November 2002 and, based on these discussions, MIH and the Lao National \nCommittee  on  Energy  (LNCE)  developed  the  Power  Sector  Policy  Implementation  Plan.  The \nplan  defines  the  actions  and  time  frame  to  strengthen  of  the  power  sector,  including  those  to \nimprove promotion, selection, and development of IPPs. \n \nThe  statement  emphasizes  the  need  to  reform  institutional  structures  to  clarify \n3. \nresponsibilities,  strengthen  commercial \nfunctions,  and  streamline  administration.  The \nGovernment has recognized the need to restructure how it participates as an equity investor in \nIPP projects so that the benefits to the people are maximized and that Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) \ncan focus on its core operations of domestic power supply and distribution. \n \nTo support IPP development and institutional restructuring, MIH and LNCE will conduct \n4. \na detailed study on IPP project selection and implementation, and stakeholder consultation. The \nconsulting  services  are  to  develop  a  systematic  framework  for  IPP  selection  and  project \ndevelopment that will do the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\nInclude transparent IPP project section criteria and clear project implementation \nprocedures. \n\n(ii) \n\nMaximize revenue and nonrevenue benefits from IPP development. \n\n(iii) \n\nIdentify  and  structure  a  publicly  owned  vehicle  to  own  and  manage  the \nGovernment\u2019s  existing  and  future  IPP  investments  to  bring  financial  expertise \nand discipline to bear on IPP investment decisions and allow EdL to focus on its \nutility responsibilities. \n\nScope of Work \n\nB. \n \n\nThe scope of work involves the development of a systematic IPP framework to develop \n\n5. \nprivate generation. In particular, the consultant will do the following: \n\n1. \n\nRationalize Independent Power Producer Mandates  \n\n6. \n\nTasks include the following: \n\n(i) \n\nReview  existing  memorandums  of  understandings  (MOUs)  and  concessions, \noutline which are inactive, and determine which of the inactive mandates are still \nlegally binding. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n47 \n\n(ii) \n\nDevelop  criteria  to  determine  which  of  the  legally  active  mandates  continue  to \nserve  the  national  interest,  taking  into  account  project  economics  and  finance \nability,  power  market,  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  characteristics  of \nthe developer. Advise the Government on options regarding those mandates that \nare no longer in the national interest. \n\n(iii) \n\nAssess inactive MOUs and concessions, and determine which can be terminated \nwith little or no negotiation or compensation. Outline the procedures to terminate \nand provide draft documentation to formally terminate inactive mandates. \n\n2. \n\nDevelop Independent Power Producer Project Selection Criteria \n\nTasks include the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nReview recent power generation planning studies and project feasibility studies, \nincluding the following: \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n\nPower System Development Plan, (ongoing, World Bank); \nPower Development Plan 2001-2010, (November 2001, EdL); \nPower Sector Strategy Study (March 2002, ADB); and \nHydropower  Development  Strategy  Study  (September  2000,  World \nBank). \n\nrisk  characteristics.  Prepare \n\nGroup potential IPP generation projects into generic categories according to their \nfinancing  and \nrisk  matrixes  and  propose \nimplementation modalities and indicative financing plans tailored for each project \ncategory.  A  project  may  be  included  in  more  than  one  category,  depending on \nthe proposed development of a site (e.g. domestic or export, storage vs. run-of-\nriver, availability of multilateral support, etc.). \n\nPropose objective criteria to decide which projects or categories of projects are \nbest  suited  for  private  sector  participation.  The  criteria  will  be  designed  to \nevaluate those projects with the greatest likelihood to reach financial close and to \nbenefit  the  Lao PDR.  Accordingly,  they  will  be  selected  based  on  the  following, \namong other criteria: \n\nexpected  revenue  benefits  to  the  Government,  with  emphasis  on  taxes, \nroyalties,  and/or  dividends  for  export  projects  and  low  off-take price for \ndomestic projects; \n\nexpected  nonrevenue  benefits \nfulfillment  of  power  market \nrequirements,  regional  development,  stability  of  domestic power system, \nand local infrastructure); \n\n(e.g. \n\navoidance of adverse social and environmental impacts; \n\navoidance  of  opportunity  costs  (e.g.  impacts  on  other  projects  and  land \nuses); and \n\nability  to  reach  financial  close  (e.g.  likelihood  of  financial  support  from \nreputable developers, commercial banks, multilateral agencies, and other \nlenders). \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n \n\n \n\n7. \n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n8. \n\nTasks include the following: \n\n3. \n\nDevelop Independent Power Producer Project Implementation Procedures \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nOutline transparent and competitive developer selection and project procurement \nmodels.  They  should  be  suitable  for  awarding  IPP  concessions,  taking  into \naccount  the  characteristics  of  different  project  categories  defined  under  7  (ii) \nabove.  \n\nAny  proposals  for  use  of  selection  models  that  do  not  include  some  form  of \ncompetitive  bidding  (negotiated  or  unsolicited)  should  be  identified,  and  the \ncircumstances where they could be permitted outlined. \n\nPrepare  a  draft  manual  on  IPP  project  procurement  procedures,  specifying \nprocedures for evaluating and awarding IPP concessions for the different project \ncategories. Where appropriate, the procedures will include flow charts, diagrams, \nand other formats for clear presentation. For each procurement model, the draft \nmanual  will  stipulate  systematic  IPP  procedures  to  promote  projects,  prequalify \ndevelopers, evaluate and select project developers, and award IPP licenses. The \nmanual will set out the requirements for each stage of the procurement process:  \n\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n(e) \n(f) \n(g) \n\nscreening and selection of projects, \nselection of appropriate procurement models, \nprequalification of prospective developers, \npreparation of procurement documentation, \nrequest for proposals and draft agreements, \nevaluation and ranking of proposals, and \nnegotiation of final project agreements and awarding of concessions \n\n(iv) \n\nPropose  objective  prequalification  criteria  to  assess  project  developers.  The \nin \ncriteria  should  ensure \ndeveloping,  financing,  constructing,  and  operating hydropower projects. Special \nattention should be given to the developer\u2019s experience in complying with social \nresettlement  policies  associated  with \ndevelopment,  environmental,  and \nhydropower development. \n\ninternational  experience \n\nthat  developers  have \n\n(v) \n\nSpecify clear project implementation sequences and steps, defining the following: \n\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n\nactions and outcomes; \nprerequisite approvals and consent; \nresponsible agencies; and \ntimelines.  \n\n(vi) \n\nReview  progress  made  by  United  Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization \n(UNIDO) consultants on project-specific agreements and any model concession \nagreements  and  power  purchase  agreements  (PPAs).  Drawing  on  these \nagreements where appropriate, prepare model agreements suitable for different \nproject categories: \n\n(a) \n(b) \n\n(d) \n\nstandardized MOU; \nrequest  for  proposals  (e.g.  invitation  to  bid,  instructions  to  bidders,  etc.) \nfor use in competitive solicitations; and  \nPPA specifically for EdL off-take. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nIdentify  an  Agency  to  Own  and  Manage  the  Government\u2019s  Existing  and \nFuture Independent Power Producer Equity Investments \n\n9. \n\nTasks include the following: \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n49 \n\nAnalyze the benefits and risks inherent in the Government\u2019s policy of investing in \nIPP  projects.  Outline  decision  criteria  to  help  the  Government  in  its  equity \ninvestment decisions. \n\nIdentify  an  appropriate  entity  (existing  or  new)  to  own  and  manage  the \nGovernment\u2019s existing and future IPP equity investments and leave EdL to focus \non  its  utility  responsibilities.  Consultants  should  review  any  previous  reports  on \nsegregation of IPP benefits from EdL. \n\nIf  establishing  a  new  company  is  recommended,  determine  which  government \nagency  should  hold  the  majority  of  shares.  Determine  whether  any  other \ninstitutions  should  hold  a  minority  interest  to  increase  the  company\u2019s  credibility \nand ability to raise financing. \n\nOutline steps required (institutional, legal, financial, etc.) to establish a new entity \nwith such a mandate and to transfer existing IPP shares from EdL. Review what \nchanges, if any, may be necessary to the Electricity Law to establish this entity.  \n\nPropose the organizational structure and composition of the entity and describe \nhow  it  can  bring  financial  expertise  and  discipline  to  bear  on  the  investment \ndecisions  it  makes.  Prepare  an  initial  business/operating  plan,  capital  structure, \nand, from existing IPP financial flows to EdL, assess initial financial forecasts to \ndetermine self-sufficiency. \n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n10. \nEdL  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  consulting  services.  It  will  provide  administrative \nservices,  office  facilities,  phone  and  fax  facilities,  documents,  and  information  as  required  to \nefficiently  execute  the  services.  Consultants  will  be  required  to  coordinate  all  work  with  the \ncommittee  for  planning  and  cooperation,  MIH,  and  LNCE.  EdL  will  facilitate  interaction  with \nother government agencies to ensure efficient consulting services. \n\n \n11. \nUNIDO  is  helping  LNCE  develop  IPPs  and  structure  contracts.  While  a  portion  of \nUNIDO\u2019s scope has been focused on specific IPP projects, substantial progress has been made \nin  drafting  model  agreements  and  documents.  Consultants  must  interface  closely  with  UNIDO \nand  LNCE  to  ensure  that  efforts  are  not  duplicated.  UNIDO  has  expressed  its  willingness  to \ncoordinate with ADB-financed consultants once they are engaged. \n\nD. \n\nReporting Requirements \n\n12. \nThe  consultants  will  provide  the  reports  specified  below,  and  all  reports  must  be \nprepared in 20 hardcopies and three CD-ROMs.1 The following reports should be distributed as \ndirected by EdL to MIH, Committee for Planning and Cooperation, LNCE, and ADB: \n\n                                                 \n1 Compact discs-read only memory. \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ninception report, within 4 weeks from the start of the assignment; \n\ninterim report, within 2 months after approval of the inception report; \n\ndraft final report, within 2 months after the approval of the interim report; and \n\nfinal report, within 1 month after the approval of the draft final report. \n\nAlong with the draft final report and final report, the consultants will prepare and submit \n13. \nto EdL supporting documents concerned, including (i) model procurement documents; and (ii) a \ndraft IPP project procurement procedure manual, based on the study results. \n\n14. \nBefore  submission  of  the  inception  report,  the  consultant  will  conduct  a  workshop \nincluding all stakeholders. A second workshop must be organized shortly after completion of the \ndraft final report. \n\nE. \n\nExpertise Required and Person-Month Estimates \n\n15. \nThe  consultants  will  include  specialists  in  (i)  IPP  hydropower  development,  (ii) \ninfrastructure investment promotion and project financing, (iii) legal and regulatory issues in IPP \ndevelopment, and (iv) institutional framework for private participation. \n\n16. \nAn estimated total input of 13 person-months of international consulting services will be \nrecruited by MIH, in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers, and the quality- and cost-based selection method as set \nout  in  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  for  Users  of  Consulting  Services  (September  2002)  will  be  used  to \nselect consultants. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\nA. \n\nLoad Forecast \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nLoad  forecasts  were  estimated  for  four  major  consumption  categories:  domestic, \n1. \ncommercial, agriculture/irrigation, and industrial. The domestic category was further divided by \nincome level and whether households are using off-grid services or not. To accommodate other \nconsumer  categories,  a  residual  amount  of  demand  was  allocated  for  other  domestic  and \nindustrial consumers.  \n \n2. \nFor  the  domestic  category,  1,900  villages  in  21  districts  in  the  project  area,  identified \nfrom  existing  data,  were  screened  to  prepare  a  list  of  villages  within  several  kilometers  of  the \nmain  roads  as  principal  candidates  for  electrification  and  to  obtain  population  and  household \ndata  for  load  forecasting.  Subsequent  field  visits  indicated  that  many  communities  were  too \nremote to be economically connected to the grid in the short to medium term. Thus, the number \nof villages under consideration for electrification was reduced to about 700. These villages were \nassigned  to  one  of  four  classifications  based  on  income  level  and  typical  pattern  of  energy \nconsumption.  Data  on  population,  population  growth,  and  migration  patterns  were  also \nconsidered.  \n \nSome 800 households in the study area were surveyed to obtain indicative measures of \n3. \neconomic activity, social and housing conditions, ownership of households assets, and energy \nuse.  Livelihood  and  production  systems  of  households  were  also  assessed  as  well  as  the \nenergy  sources  that  are  used  for  those  activities.  The  analysis  of  energy  use  of  households \nincluded  information  on  sources,  use  and  cost  of  different  fuels  for  different  household  and \nagricultural  activities,  supply  of  electricity  and  other  energy  sources,  and  attitudes  toward \nelectricity. Selected villages that had been electrified in the last 3\u20134 years were also surveyed to \nprepare demand forecasts for individual villages.  \n \n4. \nBased on the socioeconomic survey carried out under the  project preparatory technical \nassistance  (PPTA),1  a  list  of  typical  household  appliances  and  their  daily  use  in  hours  was \nestablished  to  arrive  at  a  daily  load  pattern  for  domestic  consumers.  Assumptions  were made \nabout the percentage of ownership of these appliances for the three different income levels for \nyear  0,  the  year  of  project  commissioning,  and  for  year  15  after  commissioning  to  reflect \ninduced  consumption  patterns  as  a  result  of  economic  growth.  The  load  pattern  was  further \nanalyzed by applying these consumption patterns by income level to four village classifications. \nEach  classification  was  assumed  to  have  a  fixed  mix  of  the  three  income  classifications. \nEstablished  consumers  using  off-grid  services  are  assumed  to  have  a  higher  annual \nconsumption than first-time consumer households since the former will have already purchased \nmore  diverse  appliances  than  the  latter.  A  fourth  domestic  category  was  introduced  to  reflect \nconsumption by the poor. Their share was calculated based on the census data of households \nbelow the national poverty line for each district.  \n \n5. \nTo  calculate  the  replacement  portion  of  energy  to  be  displaced  by  the  Project, \nhouseholds  consuming  power  from  off-grid systems available  for  restricted  hours  a  day  were \nsurveyed  and  the  billing  information  reviewed  to  calculate  monthly  consumption  rates. \nConsumption rates range from 4.0  kilowatt-hour (kWh)/month to 33.5 kWh/month for a system \nthat  operates  only  4  hours  daily.  A  monthly  electricity  consumption  of  4  kWh  is  equivalent  to \noperating two small kerosene or diesel lamps, the main alternate energy source for lighting, for \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to Lao PDR for the Northern Area Rural Power Distribution Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nthree hours daily. The survey found that residential consumers prefer to have at least one light \nin each room plus one outside light. Assuming that poor households live in single-room houses, \na replacement consumption of 44 kWh/year for poor households appears realistic.  \n \nFor  nonpoor  first-time  domestic  customers,  the  replacement  portion  is  considerably \n6. \nhigher  although  electricity  is  initially  only  used  for  lighting.  However,  nonpoor  domestic \ncustomers live in larger houses and use more lights longer. Using two 20-watt (W) fluorescent \nlights,  one  40  W  fluorescent  bulb,  and  one  60  W  incandescent  light  for  a  few  hours each day \nresults  in  annual  consumption  of  254  kWh  per  year.  Besides  better  and  more  lighting,  the \nnonpoor established domestic customers have small appliances such as fans, radios, sewing \nmachines, and color televisions, resulting in a replacement portion of about 560 kWh/year.  \n \nInduced consumption for poor households is assumed to be for lighting only since other \n7. \nappliances might be too expensive. Acquisition of more lighting sources and longer daily use will \nresult in an annual consumption after 15 years equivalent to the replacement portion of nonpoor \nfirst-time  households.  They  are  assumed  to  acquire  the  same  type  of  small  appliances  as  the \nnonpoor established households had during year 1 and, thus, their annual consumption after 15 \nyears  is  estimated  to  be  about  the  same.  Nonpoor  established  households  will  make  more \nintensive  use  of  their  existing  appliances  and  lighting  sources  once  connected  to  the  grid. \nHowever,  such  households  will  also  acquire  more  appliances,  of  which  refrigerators  and  fans \nare the most popular, resulting in an annual consumption of about 1,400 kWh. Graphs showing \nthe demand curves for the three domestic categories are in Figures A11.1\u2013A11.3. \n \n8. \nGiven the limitations of Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) to connect all households im mediately, \n50% of all rural and 60% of urban households are assumed to be electrified in the first year of \nproject commissioning, then rise gradually to 80% for rural and 90% for urban households over \n10 years.  \n \nA similar analysis was carried out for nondomestic consumption. The energy situation for \n9. \ncommercial and industrial activities in each project area was analyzed. If grid or off-grid supply \nwas  available,  the  data  on  number  of  customers  and  operating  hours  per  day  were  collected. \nProvincial  authorities  were  interviewed  about  ongoing  and  planned  investment  and  expected \npower  demand.  For  each  of  the  four  village  classifications  a  number  of  commercial  and \nindustrial uses are assumed based on the field survey findings. For example, the largest village \nwould have government offices, a hospital, and senior-level schools, as well as an allowance for \nlarger  industrial  supply  such  as  a  sawmill  or  garment  factory.  The  remote  village  would  have \ninstead a junior school and community water pumps and only less industrial consumption. \n\nFigure A11.1: Demand Curve-\u2014Non-Poor New Customer \n\n)\nh\nW\nk\n/\n$\n(\n \ne\nc\ni\nr\nP\n\n0 . 6\n\n0 . 5\n\n0 . 4\n\n0 . 3\n\n0 . 2\n\n0 . 1\n\n0 . 0\n\n0\n\n \n\nkWh/yr = kilowatt-hour per year. \n\n1 0 0\n\n2 0 0\n\n3 0 0\n\n4 0 0\n\n5 0 0\n\n6 0 0\n\nQ u a n t i t y  D e m a n d e d  ( k W h / y r )\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fFigure A11.2: Demand Curve\u2014Non-Poor Existing Customer \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\n0 . 4\n\n0 . 3\n\n0 . 2\n\n0 . 1\n\n0 . 0\n\n0\n\n0 . 8\n\n0 . 7\n\n0 . 6\n\n0 . 5\n\n0 . 4\n\n0 . 3\n\n0 . 2\n\n0 . 1\n\n0 . 0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2 0 0\n\n4 0 0\n\n6 0 0\n\n8 0 0\n\n1 0 0 0\n\n1 2 0 0\n\n1 4 0 0\n\n1 6 0 0\n\nQuantity Demanded (kWh/yr)\n\nkWh/yr = kilowatt-hour per year. \n\n \n\nFigure A11.3: Demand Curve\u2014Poor New Customer \n\n0\n\n5 0\n\n1 0 0\n\n1 5 0\n\n2 0 0\n\n2 5 0\n\n3 0 0\n\nQ u a n t i t y  D e m a n d e d  ( k W h / y r )\n\nkWh/yr = kilowatt-hour per year. \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nElectricity  consumption  for  irrigation  pumping  and  rice  milling  is  included  in  the \n10. \nagriculture/irrigation category. In the absence of specific plans to make irrigation pumping more \navailable,  and  considering  that  not  all  households  will  have  access  to  individual  pumps,  the \nforecast  includes  a  fixed  allowance  per  household  for  all  village  classifications.  This  estimate \nwas based on assumptions about water requirements for irrigating rice and average lift, and that \nabout 20% of households would opt for electric pumping. Electricity consumption for rice milling \nhas  been  estimated  based  on  daily  rice  consumption  and  the  operating  specifications  of  a \nmedium-sized rice mill. \n \nB. \n\nLong-Run Marginal Cost and Economic Subsidies \n\nThe Power Supply Tariff Study2 calculated the economic long-run marginal cost (LRMC) \n11. \nbased  on  the  capital  expenditure  plan  as  agreed  on  by  EdL  and  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and \nHandicrafts, which foresees a total investment of $730 million in 2001-2010. This ambitious plan \nreflects the Government's objective of increasing electricity coverage to 90% of households by \n2020.  LRMC  reflects  the  incremental  costs  of  all  adjustments  in  the  system  development  plan \nand  system  operations  that  are  attributable  to  an  increase  in  demand  sustained  long  into  the \nfuture.  As  grid  outreach  is  limited,  LRMC  will  be  expected  to  increase  in  the  medium  to  long \nterm  until  a  balance  between  power  demand  and  supply  is  achieved.  In  other  words,  LRMC \nreflects the cost to the economy of connecting and supplying future customers, which provides \nan  indication  for  tariff-setting  principles.  If  tariffs  are  kept  below  the  average  LRMC,  the \neconomy as a whole subsidizes power consumption of those connected to the electricity grid at \nthe expense of those that are not.  \n \nEffective  1  March  2002,  the  Government  increased  tariffs  and  rationalized  the  tariff \n12. \nstructure for domestic consumers by reducing tariff blocks to three and drastically increasing the \ntariff for the highest block. About 15% of sales occur in the lifeline block set at 50  kilowatt-hour \n(kWh)/month,  thus  protecting  the  poor  consumers.  In  the  same  tariff  order,  the  Government \nannounced  that  tariffs  for  all  categories  will  increase  by  2.3%  per  month  over  36  months.  The \nfollowing  table  compares  projected  average  tariff  levels  with  LRMC  per  customer  category  for \n2001\u20132004. \n \n\nTable A11.1: Long-Run Marginal Cost and Projected Average Tariffs  \nfor the Years 2001-2004 \n \n2002 \nTariff     LRMC \n(KN/kWh) \n\n2003 \nTariff     LRMC \n(KN/kWh) \n\n(KN/kWh) \n\n   LRMC \n\nTariff  \n\n2001  \n\n 2004 \nTariff     LRMC \n(KN/kWh) \n\n174 \n386 \n335 \n132 \n335 \n319 \n221 \n\n241 \n1,013 \n488 \n856 \n422 \n710 \n176 \n670 \n400 \n671 \n374 \n575 \n872 \n283 \n      Govt. = government, KN = kip, kWh = kilowatt-hour, LRMC = long-run marginal cost, MV = medium voltage. \n \n13. \nTable  A11.1  shows  that  no  customer  category  pays  the  full  cost  of  supply  and, \nconsequently,  the  system  has  no  cross-subsidies.

Power Supply Tariff Study\u2014Final Report. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n55 \n\nmedium-voltage  services  customer  will  be  slightly  higher  than  their  respective  cost  of  supply. \nGiven  the  limited  sales  to  those  categories,  the  revenues  will  not  be  sufficient  to  cover  the \nsubsidies extended to other consumers, although the average revenue increases from 29% of \nLRMC  to  53%.  Almost  all  domestic  consumption  is  subsidized  by  EdL\u2019s  export  earnings, \nreducing  earnings.  For  FY2001  the  economic  subsidy\u2014the  difference  between  LRMC  and \nfinancial revenue\u2014amounts to KN350 billion. \n \n14. \nAll  customer  categories  are  subsidized,  but  the  greatest  subsidies  are  given  to \nresidential and irrigation customers who jointly account for about 72% of total sales. Given the \nhigh total domestic consumption at about 68% and the absence of time-of-day pricing or energy \nefficiency  programs,  the  daily  load  curve  peaks  only  once,  for  three  hours,  in  the  evening.  As \nthe  industrial  load  rises  continuously,  this  pattern  of  use  is  expected  to  change,  but  not  in  the \nshort  run.  Since  the  system  is  entirely  hydro  based,  the  difference  between  the  peak  and  off-\npeak  marginal  energy  cost  at  bus  bar  is  small,  with  KN286/kWh  versus  KN248/kWh. When \nincluding system losses, the difference between peak (KN404/kWh) and off-peak (KN313/kWh) \nmarginal  energy  cost  at  low-voltage  level  increases  visibly,  with  an  annual  average  of \nKN324/kWh.  Current  tariffs  for  residential  and  irrigation  customers  do  even  cover  the  off-peak \nenergy cost. Since class-specific load research has not been carried out in EdL, other countries\u2019 \nexperiences  were  used  as  a  reasonable  basis  to  estimate  class  coincidence  and  class  load \nfactors to estimate marginal capacity cost and strict LRMC for each tariff class.  \n \n15.  While  government  subsidy  of  electricity  consumption  can  be  justified  economically,  the \nsubsidy budget should be calculated transparently. Current subsidies should also be assessed \nto  see  if  they  are  sufficiently  targeted  and  whether  the  intended  beneficiaries  are  indeed \nreached or whether most subsidies go to customers able to pay. Moreover, the current subsidy \nstructure limits the ability of EdL reach the Government\u2019s 90% electrification target. \n \nC.  \n \n16. \nAn economic evaluation was carried out for the entire Project, consisting of transmission \nand  distribution  investments.  The  results  are  summarized  below.  Details  of  the  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) calculations are in Table A11.2. \n \n17. \nThe  vast  majority  of  households  in  the  Lao  PDR  have  no  access  to  grid  electricity. \nHowever,  province-sponsored  systems  and  privately  operated  generators  based  on  diesel  or \nsmall  hydro  systems  and  imports  from  Thailand  provide  limited  amounts  of  electricity. Thus, \neven  in  the  absence  of  grid  supply,  a  certain  amount  of  electricity  is  consumed  by  the \nresidential, industrial, and commercial sectors, albeit at substantially higher prices than paid by \nEdL customers. \n \nThe economic benefits of extending grid supply to unserved areas are estimated based \n18. \non  the  cost  of  alternative  energy  sources  used  for  existing  consumption  levels,  and  based  on \nthe willingness to pay for induced consumption as a consequence of the availability of reliable \ngrid  supply.  Benefits  were estimated separately for poor and nonpoor residential consumers, \nand  for  industrial,  commercial,  and  irrigation  customers.  To  underline  the  differential  cost \nstructure of grid and off-grid supply, it is worth noting that in Louang Nam Thai, where a diesel \ngenerator  produces  electricity  for  about  4  hours/day,  customers  are  asked  to  pay  a  tariff  of \n1,200  KN/kWh,  while  in  Xaiboury  customers  are  required  to  pay  KN1,800/kWh,  and  in \nXaisomboun,  KN2,000/kWh,  for  the  same  standard  and  quality  of  supply.  In  Pak  Lai, where \npower  is  imported  from  Thailand,  connected  households  that  have  24-hour  supply  pay \nKN564/kWh. However, no new connections are possible in Pak Lai due to capacity constraints \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nin  Thailand.  These  tariffs  must  be  compared  with  the  recently  announced  new  tariffs  of \nKN64/kWh  for  the  first  50  kWh  block  of  domestic  consumption  and  KN150/kWh  for  the  next \nblock of 50 kWh. Even after the recent tariff increase, none of the customer categories (except \nfor embassy and entertainment) pay a tariff equal to even the lowest tariff for off-grid supply, but \nthe  highest  EdL  tariff  (for  the  commercial  category)  equals  only  83%  of  the  rate  charged  to \ncustomers  in  Pak  Lai.  Neither  diesel  nor  kerosene  and  gasoline  are  subsidized,  so \nnonelectrified consumers are paying actual cost of supply for these energy sources.  \n \nUnelectrified households typically get energy from four sources: (i) candles and simple \n19. \nkerosene or diesel lamps for lighting, (ii) dry-cell batteries for lighting and radio, (iii) car batteries \nfor  televisions,  and  (iv)  small  diesel  generators  for  most  household  and  many  commercial \nactivities.  The  economic  value  of  electricity  for  domestic  use  was  evaluated  on  the  basis  of  a \ndemand  curve  consisting  of  the  estimated  costs  of  alternative  sources  of  basic  energy  for \nlighting and induced demand for other uses at rates approaching the domestic tariff level. The \ncost of self-generation, and the tariff for off-grid supply are much higher than EdL\u2019s current and \nfuture  tariffs.  Not  all  domestic  consumption  will  be  so  expensive,  so  only  the  initial  portion  of \ndomestic consumption is valued accordingly (replacement portion). Additional consumption has \ndecreasing marginal values until the lower limit for marginal consumption becomes almost equal \nto expected tariff levels (induced portion). \n \nDerivations for the willingness-to-pay demand curve have been made for three different \n20. \ndomestic categories, and conservative assumptions have been used for all. For poor consumers \nthe  initial  point  on  the  demand  curve  (44  kWh/year)  has  been  valued  as  the  cost  of  a  small \nkerosene  lamp  (KN7,200/kWh).  For  nonpoor,  established  consumers,  the  initial  portion  of \nconsumption (560 kWh/year) has been valued as the cost of a small residential diesel generator \nat  KN2,480/kWh.  For  nonpoor,  first-time  consumers  the  initial  consumption  portion  (254 \nkWh/year)  is  valued  as  the  average  of  the  average  initial  tariff  for  off-grid  electricity  provision \nand  the  unit  cost  of  small  diesel  generators,  at  KN2,019/kWh.  The  average  willingness  to  pay \nfor the  remaining  area  under  the  demand  curve  has  been  estimated  at  KN2,646/unit  for  poor \nand KN1,019/unit for nonpoor consumers.  \n \n21. \nEstimated  costs  for  private  power  supply  for  commercial  customers  are  based  on  the \nuse of a 40 kW gas oil generator and a 35% load factor, and for industrial customers, on a 200 \nkW  gas  oil  generator,  also  with  a  35%  load  factor.  The  economic  replacement  cost  for \ncommercial customers is KN1,550/kWh, and for industrial consumers, KN1,140 kWh, while the \naverage  willingness  to  pay  for  induced  commercial  consumption  is  KN812/kWh,  and  for \nindustrial  consumption,  KN635/kWh.  The  cost  of  alternative  energy  sources  for  irrigation  is \nbased  on  the  estimated  cost  for  diesel  pumps  with  an  8-horsepower  motor.  The  economic \nreplacement  cost  for  initial  consumption  is  estimated  at  KN1,935/kWh,  and  for  induced \nconsumption, at KN790/kWh.  \n \n22. \nTo convert financial project cost into economic cost, taxes and duties were deducted. No \nprice contingencies are included in the base capital cost but the economic capital costs include \nphysical  contingencies.  Costs  were  separated  into  foreign  exchange  and  local  costs,  and  a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to local costs. Annual operation and maintenance \ncosts were calculated in economic prices as a percentage of the total capital investment cost. \nThe  economic  cost  includes  provision  for  residential  house  wiring,  which  is  excluded  from \nfinancial  costs.  Energy  costs  have  been  valued  based  on  the  long-run  marginal  cost  for \ngeneration  and  transmission  as  calculated  by  the  recently  completed  Power  Supply  Tariff \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n57 \n\nStudy.3 System losses were calculated for each feeder based on the estimated peak demand, \nand the load and loss factor and were included in estimation of energy costs. \n \n23. \nOn  the  basis  of  a  comparison  of  economic  costs  and  benefits  over  a  35-year project \nlifetime, including a 2-year construction period and excluding any residual value, the EIRR was \nestimated at 23.3%, with a net present value of KN356,168 million. Extensive sensitivity testing \nshows that the Project will remain robust for all 13 variables tested, with only minor impacts on \nthe  EIRR  (Table  A11.3).  The  most  significant  impact  resulted  from  a  20%  reduction  of  total \nbenefits. The EIRR dropped to 18.3%. Risk analysis was undertaken by running simulations for \nthe energy input cost and for all seven willingness-to-pay values. The Project is very robust, with \nonly a 5% probability that the EIRR will drop below 13%. Distribution analysis (Supplementary \nAppendix C) for the Project shows that electricity customers and local labor are the main project \nbeneficiaries, whereas the return of the Project for the Government is negative. This is the result \nof the highly subsidized tariff structure, the cost of which is shared by the public utility, and thus \nthe  Government,  through  lost  tax  income.  The  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  ratio  (Supplementary \nAppendix C) is 10%, primarily due to the fact that the share of the poor in the overall loss to the \neconomy  is  higher  than  the  benefits  they  receive  as  consumers  and  project  workers.  Risk \nanalysis  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  shows  that  the  probability  of  the  poverty  impact  ratio \nfalling below 5% is 5%. \n \n\nTable A11.2: Sensitivity Testing \n\n \n\nItem \n\nEIRR

\n1. \non  total  project  financial  cost  and  additional  revenue  generated  from  new  and  incremental \nenergy sales. All revenue and costs are based on 2003 base figures. The Project is assumed to \noperate for 35 years, including the implementation period. This operating period corresponds to \nthe  estimated  useful  life  of  the  assets  being  constructed.  No  salvage  value  is  assumed  at  the \nend of the operating period. \n\nB. \n\nCapital Costs \n\n2. \nCapital costs include transmission and substation costs (115.0 kilovolt [kV]),  distribution \ncosts  (34.5  kV  and  22.0  kV),  and  low-voltage  (400  volt  [V])  costs  of  wiring  to  the  external \nhousehold electricity meter. Investments in residential house wiring are the responsibility of the \nhouse owner and, therefore, excluded from this analysis. Capital costs include the base project \ncosts  plus  physical  contingencies  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during \nconstruction capitalized on the loan. The analysis assumes construction of 115 kV transmission \nlines  in  years  2  and  3  (2005-2006)  and  medium-  and  low-voltage distribution lines in years 3 \nand 4 (2006-2007). Household connections will start in 2006 and continue in the service areas \nthrough 2020. Capital costs associated with these connections are appropriately reflected. \n\nC. \n\nDemand Forecast / Sales Revenue  \n\n3. \nThe demand forecast is based on the forecast developed under the  project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance.1  Total  expected  sales  are  based  on  newly  electrified  customers  in  the \nproject  areas,  and  the  incremental  sales  in  Louang  Phrabang  resulting  from  additional \ntransmission capacity. The bulk of the energy demand forecast is for residential and commercial \nend  users.  Industrial  demand  from  the  prospective  cement  plant  at  Namo  is  forecast  at  50% \ncapacity in 2010 and full capacity in 2020. Total energy demand is forecast from 2006 to 2020, \nwhen all incremental electricity usage and new connections from the Project are assumed to be \nfully realized. Sales revenue is based on demand forecast per customer category and reflects \nthe planned increase in retail tariffs from 2002 to 2005, which the Government approved in April \n2002  and  implemented  in  May  2002  (2.3%  per  month  for  36  months).  The  weighted  average \nreal retail tariff for the project areas will be approximately KN612/kWh ($0.0526/kWh) in 2005, \nwhich is still below the long-run marginal costs but represent a significant step to cost recovery. \nTotal  revenue  also  includes  connection  charges  (meter,  installation)  paid  by  new  customers. \nWhile customers may amortize connection charges under this Project, revenue accrues to EdL \nas services are performed. \n\nD. \n\nOperation and Maintenance Costs \n\n4. \nThese costs include the cost of energy sent out to the transmission system, transmission \nlosses,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs,  and  general  and \nand  distribution \nadministrative expenses. The incremental financial cost of electricity generation is assumed at \nKN95/kWh  ($0.01/kWh).  Estimated  costs  for  transmission  and  distribution  losses  have  also \nbeen  included  in  operating  expenses.  Based  on  EdL  operating  data  from  2000,  the  average \nO&M cost per customer is KN235,000, which is assumed to stay constant as more customers \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997.

Average administrative and staff costs are also based on 2000 operating data at \nKN72,000 per customer. \n\nE. \n\nTurnover and Profit Tax \n\n5. \nThe Government charges EdL a 5% turnover tax on all domestic sales, which has been \nincluded  in  the  financial  analysis.  EdL  also  pays  profit  tax  of  35%  on  net  income.  If  EdL\u2019s  net \nincome  for  the  year  is  negative,  then  the  Government  assesses  1%  on  total  turnover  as \nminimum profit tax on EdL. \n\nF. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital  \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  comprises  three  financing \n6. \nsources:  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan,  Nordic  Development  Fund  (NDF)  loan,  and \ngovernment counterpart funds (equity). The ADB and NDF loans are concessional (assuming a \nMinistry of Finance relending rate of 6%), so the real cost falls below the minimum rate test of \n4%. Individual real costs are shown in Table A12.1. \n\n7. \nDetermining  the  cost  of  EdL  equity  is  complicated  as  debt  and  capital  markets  are \nunderdeveloped. The opportunity cost of government counterpart funds, in real terms, has been \ncalculated  according  to  the  following  methodology.  The  Government  does  issue  bonds \nperiodically (not at fixed intervals), but they may not be default free, so the dollar savings rate \noffered by the Banque pour le Commerce Exterieur Lao at 6% for 1 year has been selected as \nthe risk-free equity rate of return.2 To this risk-free rate 4% has been added as an appropriate \npremium to reflect the volatile nature of inflation and financing using external currencies. After \nconverting  this  nominal  rate  into  real  terms,  the  opportunity  cost  of  EdL  funds  has  been \ncomputed to be 7.42%. \n\n \n\nFinancing \n($ million) \n\nTable A12.1: Weighted Av erage Cost of Capital \nMinimum \nRate Test \n(%) \n4.00 \n4.00 \n\u2013 \n \n\nADB Loan (Special Fund) \nNDF  Loan \nEdL Equity \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EdL = Electricit\u00e9 du Laos, NDF = Nordic Development Fund. \n\n58.2 \n19.40 \n22.30 \n100.00 \n\nWeighting \n(%) \n\n3.90% \n3.90% \n7.42% \n\n10.00  \n11.51  \n51.51  \n\nReal Cost \n\n30.00  \n\n \n\n2.33 \n0.78 \n1.66 \n4.77 \n\nComposite  \nCapital Cost \n(%) \n\n \n\nG. \n\nResults and Conclusions  \n\n8. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  on  the  Project  is  based  on  its  capital  and \nO&M  costs  and  the  revenue  generated  from  new  connections  and  incremental  energy  sales. \nThe project FIRR is 2.71%. The pro forma net annual revenues are generally positive and cover \nproject  operating  expenses.  However,  with  a  WACC  at  4.77%,  financial  returns  of  the \ninvestment do not exceed the total project financing cost.  \n\n9. \nAlthough the Project\u2019s financial performance is marginal, its impact on EdL\u2019s operation is \nminimal compared to EdL\u2019s total domestic sales. Total projected energy sales from the project \nareas are only 8% of EdL\u2019s projected domestic turnover in 2010. A more meaningful measure of \nproject  performance  is  the  average  cost  recovery  ratio  (financial  benefit-cost ratio). Based on \n                                                 \n2  Commercial banks in the Lao PDR do not offer savings rates longer than 1 year. As information was insufficient to \n\nreflect typical long-term cost of capital, the 1-year savings rate has been used. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nthe projected real tariffs in 2005, the Project\u2019s cost recovery ratio is 95%, which means that 95% \nof the Project\u2019s total capital and operating costs are recovered directly from sales revenue. \n\n10. \nThe  main  constraint  is  the  current  and  projected  level  of  retail  tariffs,  which  do  not  yet \nfully  recover  the  cost  of  service,  especially  for  residential  consumers. No real tariff increases \nhave been assumed in this base case beyond what has been approved and implemented in the \ncurrent  tariffs  (2.3%  per  month  for  36  months,  ending  in  mid-2005).  These  scheduled  tariff \nincreases  were  adjusted  to  reflect  real  increases  in  2003  terms.  However,  the  Government \nshould  continue  to  move  to  full  cost  recovery  long  run  marginal  cost  (LRMC)  (calculation  of \napproximately KN741/kwh in 2001) to ensure viability of future connections. For the Project to \nbe financially viable (FIRR exceeding WACC), EdL should continue to increase average tariffs \nby approximately 9% per year from 2006 to 2010. \n\n11. \nA low FIRR raises the important question of how the Project can be sustainable so that \neconomic  benefits  materialize  and  accrue  to  the  targeted  beneficiaries.  Without  cross-\nsubsidization  from  other  consumer  groups,  rural  electrification  is  rarely  financially  viable  in \ndeveloping member countries. While almost all consumer groups will be below the LRMC when \nconnections begin, the cross-subsidy needs to come from another source within EdL or directly \nfrom  the  Government.  Current  fiscal  problems  prevent  an  explicit  subsidy  transfer  from  the \nGovernment. EdL earns additional revenue (in dollars and baht) from exporting surplus energy \nto  Thailand.  Even  as  more  energy  is  required  domestically,  exports  to  Thailand  will  remain  a \nsignificant portion of EdL\u2019s turnover as new generation is commissioned and connected to EdL\u2019s \nsupply  system.  Export  revenue  boosts  the  finances  of  EdL,  hedges  a  portion  of  its  foreign \nexchange risks, and helps it meet its financial obligations to lenders and the Government. The \nrevenue  is,  in  effect,  a  government  subsidy  to  EdL  for  carrying  out  the  Government\u2019s  rural \nelectrification programs. Taking these into consideration, the Project will be sustainable despite \nits marginal financial performance. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fTable A12.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) \n(All figures in KN million unless otherwise noted) \n\n6\n2\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n63 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION  \n \n\n1. \nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Project was undertaken as part of the \nproject  feasibility  study.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B,  as  per \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  IEE  is \nbased  on  an  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  the  proposed  works  and  a  visual  assessment  of  the \nproject areas. The IEE\u2019s main findings are summarized below. \n\nA. \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nThe  Project  will  extend  the  transmission  and  distribution  system  in  the  northern  rural \n\n2. \narea. Project details are given in the main text of the report. \n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n3. \nThe  northern  provinces  are  predominantly  steeply  dissected  hill  country,  ranging  from \n320-meter  (m)  valley  bottom  areas  such  as  Sayaburi  and  Louang  Phrabang  to  over  2,000  m \nmountain  ridges.  About  85%  of  Louang  Phrabang  Province  is  cut  into  mountainous,  as  is \nOudomxai. The slopes of the lower hill zone are steep where tributaries have down V-shaped \nvalley  bottoms.  Upper  hill  slopes  are  less  steep  and  more  rounded.  Large  flat  areas  are  rare, \noccasionally along the Mekong and other major rivers where valleys open up to allow river flood \nplains to develop. \n\n4. \nThe  steep  mountain  slopes  are  particularly  prone  to  erosion  and  mass  wasting  when \nvegetation  is  removed  and  soil  exposed  to  rainfall  and  surface  water  flows.  Water  quality  of \nmountain streams and rivers is generally quite high but can be rapidly degraded when soil that \nis  eroded  or  wasted  from  exposed  slopes  enters  the  streams  and  increases  turbidity,  thereby \ndegrading water quality for aquatic organisms, and domestic and livestock consumption. \n\nThe  climate  is  subtropical.  The  rainy  season  starts  in  April  and  ends  in  September  or \n\n5. \nOctober, when the region receives 85\u201391% of its annual rainfall.  \n\n2. \n\nEcological Resources \n\nThe  steep  terrain  of  the  northern  region  is  part  of  an  intricate  system  of  streams  and \n6. \nrivers that form the Mekong River watershed. No significant wetland areas exist aside from the \nnetwork of streams and rivers. Many villagers supplement their diets with fish, fresh water crabs, \nand other aquatic organisms caught from streams and ponds. \n\n7. \nThe latest satellite data of the northern provinces indicates that only 21% is covered by \nforest.  Only  small  pockets  of  primary  forest  are  left  in  the  project  area.  The  Government  has \nestablished  20  national  protected  areas  throughout  the  country.  Provinces  and  districts  have \nalso  established  a  number  of  provincial  protected  areas  and  district  protected  areas  (DPAs). \nHowever, their borders are often not clearly defined, and the protection level not defined. \n\n8. \nNam Phouy national protected area lies 5 kilometers (km) from the 22-kilovolt (kV) line \nbetween  Xaibnabouli  and  Ban  Namxong.  Residents  exploit  the  natural  resources  of  the  area, \nwhich is an important habitat for species such as the Asian elephant, tiger, gaur, Asian wild dog, \nand Asiatic black bear. \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n3. \n\nHuman and Economic Development \n\n9. \nAgriculture,  forestry,  and  fishing  are  the  major  economic  sectors.  Rice  cultivation \noccupies  about  80%  of  all  agricultural  land.  Commercial  crops  include  sugarcane,  tea,  coffee, \nsesame, and cotton. Nearly 90% of rural households raise livestock, including water buffaloes, \ncattle, pigs, and poultry, for household consumption and to sell. \n\n10. \nSmall- and medium-sized enterprises operate in the project area, including garment and \nfurniture  factories;  and  agro-processing  establishments,  including  distilleries,  breweries,  and \nmeat-processing factories. Phongsali and Sayaburi have sawmills with 50-200 employees each. \n\nThe Plain of Jars in Xieng Khouang is a world heritage site and major tourist attraction, \n\n11. \nas is the town of Louang Phrabang. \n\nC. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n12. \nmeasures are available: \n\nThe  following  potentially  significant  impacts  have  been  identified  and  their  mitigation \n\n1. \n\nNatural Vegetation and Wildlife \n\n13. \nThe 115 kV lines will be sited to minimize impacts on natural resources. The Project will \nrely on existing roads for construction and maintenance. No new roads will be constructed, and \nonly small access tracks for light-duty vehicles will be needed at selected spots for construction \nand  maintenance.  Due  to  the  poor  habitat  conditions  and  heavy  human  activity  along  the \nalignments, fauna and flora will not be significantly affected. The 34.5 and 22.0 kV distribution \nsystems  will  generally  be  situated  within  existing  rights  of  way  and,  therefore,  the  impacts \ngenerated  by  the  distribution  network  are  much  less  significant  than  those  of  the  115.0  kV \nsystem. \n\n14. \nClose attention will be paid to provincial protected areas, DPAs, and forests to avoid or \nminimize  impacts  on  the  environment.  The  alignment  is  planned  along  highways,  where  the \nenvironment  has  been  degraded  by  human  activities.  Several  provincial  protected  areas and \nDPAs are near the highways although they are not well demarcated, and two DPAs straddle the \nhighway in Oudomxai. During the detailed design survey, the alignment will be selected in close \nconsultation  with  local  forestry  officials  to  minimize  further  environmental  degradation.  If \nsecondary  or  plantation  forest  needs  to  be  cut,  it  will  be  done  in  close  consultation  with  the \nDepartment  of  Forestry.  Compensation  will  be  paid  according  to  Lao  Forestry  Law  and \nregulations for compensatory planting. In dissected or steeply undulating areas, clearing of the \nright of way will not be necessary where the tops of the highest trees are a safe distance from \nthe conductor. To avoid possible wildlife poaching by construction contractors, project staff and \nwork crews will not be allowed to possess firearms or animal traps. \n\n15. \nEdL  will  maintain  the  corridor  by  manually  trimming  vegetation  not  by  using  herbicide. \nVegetation beneath the transmission lines will be maintained in an early seral stage to provide \nminimum clearance of 10 meters from the conductors. \n\nThe Project will involve only minimal excavation that could contribute to soil erosion and \n\n16. \nsedimentation of water sources.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n65 \n\n2. \n\nLand Use and Resettlement \n\n17. \nDuring  selection  of  the  alignments,  efforts  were  made  to  avoid  existing  settlements; \nprivate and community structures; agricultural land; mature forest; areas of social, historical, and \ncultural  value;  and  environmentally  sensitive  areas.  During  the  detailed  alignment  survey, \nvillagers along the route will be consulted. The potential for resettlement is minimal, and a short \nresettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement. The resettlement plan will be updated after detailed project design, and approved \nby ADB before implementation.  \n\n3. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\n18.  Main health risks during construction may arise from (i) inadequate sanitation facilities in \nworkers\u2019 camps, (ii) introduction of sexually transmitted or other diseases by immigrant workers, \n(iii)  outbreaks  of  malaria  in  the  labor  force,  and  (iv)  explosion  of  unexploded  ordnance (UXO). \nTo avoid these risks (i) the contractor will prepare a worker health and safety plan, (ii) workers \nwill  receive  health  and  safety  training,  (iii)  workers  will  undergo  pre-employment  health \nscreening,  and  (iv)  UXO  will  be  cleared  before  construction.  Local  villagers  will  also  receive \nhealth education. \n\n4. \n\nEncroachment on Historical and Cultural Sites \n\nThe project area encompasses two world heritage sites: the Plain of Jars and the town \n\n19. \nof Louang Phrabang. The transmission lines will avoid them. \n\nD. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n20. \nThroughout project implementation, EdL will be responsible for ensuring that the Project \nfully  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  and  the  Government\u2019s \nenvironmental regulations, and meet the IEE\u2019s mitigation and monitoring requirements.  Project \nbudget  will  be  set  aside  to  implement  the  mitigation measures to ADB\u2019s satisfaction.  EdL will \nestablish  a  project  environmental  management office  consisting  of  a  representative  of  EdL\u2019s \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Management  Office,  the  contractor,  and  relevant  government \nministries,  especially  the  Science,  Technology,  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA),  to  ensure \nimplementation of the environmental management plan and monitoring.  \n\nThe environmental management office will prepare monthly environmental management \n21. \nreports  for  submission  to  EdL,  and  the  reports  will  be  sent  to  other  ministries  and  STEA  for \nreview and inspection. EdL also will prepare quarterly summaries for inclusion in the quarterly \nprogress report to ADB. \n\nE. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n22. \nenvironmental impacts are deemed to be minor because of the following: \n\nThe  environmental  screening  process \n\nfor \n\nthe  Project  was  adequate.  Overall \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCareful consideration has been given to route selection to avoid environmentally \nsensitive areas and areas of social, historical, and cultural value. \nTwo  households  might  be  resettled.  If  they  are,  they  will  be  adequately \ncompensated. \n\n(iii)  Measures  are  readily  available  to  mitigate  potential  impacts,  with  adequate \n\nmonitoring. \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nF. \n\nConclusions \n\n23. \nCompensatory  and  mitigation  measures  have  been  identified  to  address  potential \nimpacts. The IEE, therefore, is sufficient and, with the recommended environmental monitoring \nprogram,  is  the  completed  environmental  assessment  report  for  the  Project.  No  further \nassessment is needed and the Project will expect minor impacts that can be mitigated. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n67 \n\nA. \n\nScope of the Resettlement Plan \n\nSUMMARY SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN  \n\n1. \nA social analysis carried out in the project area concluded that the Project would require \nminimal land acquisition and resettlement. A short resettlement plan has been prepared for the \nProject  in  compliance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement and the  Handbook  on  Resettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice.  The only project \nsites that can be identified are for the substations. Transmission and distribution line alignments \ncannot be identified until after detailed design. However, as alignments will be selected to avoid \nall but two possible houses, and most, if not all, residential and agricultural land, land acquisition \nimpact will be insignificant. The resettlement plan will be updated following detailed design and \nsubmitted to ADB for approval before implementation. \n\nB. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n2. \nThe  115-kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  alignments  will  be  sited  to  avoid,  wherever \npossible,  crossing  villages  and  other  settlement  areas  as  well  as  agricultural  land  and  trees. \nOnly  restricted  land  use  for  agriculture  will  be  permitted  below  the  115  kV  lines.  Transmission \nline towers will also be situated to avoid agricultural land. The number and location of towers will \nbe  determined  during  detailed  design.  Each  landowner  will  lose  only  a  small  area  for  a  tower \nand will be able to cultivate under the transmission lines and towers. The Project will not have a \npermanent adverse effect on livelihood or income. Farmers will be able to continue growing their \ncrops  under  the  transmission  lines  and  towers.  Approximately  5  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be \nrequired  for  permanent  acquisition  for  three  substations  on  scrubland  belonging  to  the  local \ngovernment  or  Electricit\u00e9  du  Laos  (EdL),  and  private  scrubland  (0.25  ha)  will  be  acquired  for \none \u201cT\u201d tap junction.1 Only two houses on 0.25 ha of land in the proposed alignment of the Nam \nNgum to Thalat 115 kV transmission line may  be affected. If they are, they will be able to move \nwithin  500  meters  (m).  Land  may  also  be  required  temporarily  for  access  tracks.  The \nconstruction  of  distribution  systems  to  provide  electricity  to  villages  will  not  require  any  land \nacquisition or displacement of households, although trees and structures will be restricted to 3 \nm.  Electric  poles  and  lines  will  be  located  adjacent  to  existing  roads  between  villages,  and  in \nvillages, along roads and pathways. Living close to 22.0 kV and 34.5 kV power lines does not \npose a health hazard. Land acquisition requirements for each project component are identified \nin the resettlement plan.  \n\nC. \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n3. \nThe  policy  framework  and  entitlements  have  built  principally  on  the  Constitution  and \nLand  Law,  national  policy  on  resettlement  and  compensation,  decree  on  resettlement  and \nresettlement  and \nregulations \ncompensation,  and \ncompensation.2  The  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Handicrafts  (MIH)  has  decided  to  follow  these \nimplementation  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  and  government-\napproved resettlement plans for other ADB and World Bank projects. \n\nfor  project-related \n\nimplementation \n\n                                                 \n1   A \u201cT\u201d-shaped junction where a new transmission line is connected to an existing line to tap power supply. \n2  The  draft  policy,  decree,  and  implementation  regulations  have  all  been  prepared  under  ADB  Loan  1867: \nEnvironment and Social Program, for $30 million, approved 6 December 2001 and TA 3746. The final documents \nwas approved by the Government in May 2003. \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nD. \n\nResettlement Principles and Objectives \n\nThe  following  are  the  key  principles  and  objectives  adopted  for  electricity  projects  and \n\n4. \nwill be applied to this Project: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nInvoluntary  displacement  will  be  avoided  or  minimized  wherever  possible  by \nexploring all viable alternative project designs and locations. \nLand acquisition and resettlement will be planned and implemented to cause the \nleast possible social, cultural, and economic disruption. \nAffected people will be \n(a) \n(b) \n\ncompensated as per the compensation principles below; \nhelped  to  move,  if  required,  during  the  transition  period  to  the  relocation \nsite; and  \nhelped to improve their living standards there. \n\n(c) \nLivelihoods will be restored without detriment to the environment. \nCultural  and  religious  practices  will  be  respected  and,  as  much  as  possible, \npreserved. \nSpecial measures will protect socially and economically vulnerable groups such \nas  ethnic  minorities,  woman-headed  families,  children  and  the  aged  without \nsupport structures, and extremely poor people. \n\n(vii)  All people residing, cultivating, or making a living within the project areas before \na  formally  recognized  cut-off  date  will  be  considered  as  affected  people  and \nentitled  to  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  assistance  to  help  them  improve  or  at \nleast  maintain  their  pre-project  living  standards,  income-earning  capacity,  and \nproduction levels. Lack of legal titles to the land a person is cultivating  or to the \nplace of residence will not be a bar to resettlement entitlements. \n\n(viii)  Replacement residential and agricultural land will be as close as possible to the \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nland that was lost, and acceptable to the affected persons. \nTemporarily  affected  land  and  communal  infrastructure  will  be  restored  to  pre-\nproject condition. \nThe compensation and resettlement activities will be satisfactorily completed and \nrehabilitation measures in place for a contract. The contract area will be free of \nencumbrances before ADB approves the award of the contract for civil works. \nThe  previous  level  of  community  services  and  resources  will  be  improved  after \nresettlement. \n\n(xii)  A  project-affected  person  will  not  be  dispossessed  of  his  or  her  property  nor \ndisplaced from his or her place of residence or employment without payment of \nfull  compensation  and/or  without  making  arrangements  for  relocation  and \nrehabilitation. \n\n(xiii)  EdL will see that institutional arrangements are in place to ensure effective and \nthe  short \n\nimplementation  of \n\ntimely  design,  planning,  consultation,  and \nresettlement plan. \n\n(xv) \n\n(xiv)   The entire cost of the resettlement program will be considered as an integral part \nof  the  project  cost  and  budgeted  in  annual  and  overall  project  implementation \nplans. \nThe  resettlement  programs  will  be  planned  and  implemented with the consent \nand  agreement  of  the  affected  people  and  host  population  and  will  encourage \ntheir  active  participation.  A  full  participatory  public  involvement  process  will  be \nimplemented. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n69 \n\n(xvi)  After detailed project design and identification of affected persons, details of the \nupdated  resettlement  plan  will  be  disclosed  to  them  in  a  form  and  manner  that \nthey can understand. \n\n(xvii)  The  district  authorities  will  establish  a  grievance  committee \n\ninclude \nrepresentatives  of  MIH  and  EdL,  a  representative  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture \nand  Forestry  at  the  provincial  level,  district  and  village  representatives  such  as \nthe headman and chief elders, representatives of local organizations such as the \nLao Women\u2019s Union, and representatives of affected households other than the \nvillage heads. The committee will not be dominated by organizations that have a \ndirect interest in project implementation (such as MIH and EdL). Each committee \nmember will receive an honorarium per case reviewed. \n\nto \n\nE. \n\nEntitlement Matrix \n\n5. \nThe summary entitlement matrix (Table A14) summarizes the main types of losses and \nsupport for each type. The provinces will prepare compensation unit rates for all categories of \nloss at full replacement cost. \n\nTable A14: Entitlement Matrix \n \n\nCompensation Entitlement \n\nImplementation issues \n\nFull replacement cost with no \ndeduction for depreciation or \nsalvageable materials  \nCompensation with replacement \nland and helped to develop the \nnew site \nLump-sum payment of actual \nrelocation cost  \n\nStakeholder consensus on \nreplacement value \nassessment \nStakeholder consensus on \nsuitability of new land \n\nStakeholder consensus on \ndefinitions and amounts \n\nLump-sum payment for actual \nrelocation cost \nLump-sum payment for actual \nrelocation  \nReplacement land of comparable \nyield as a priority, or cash at \ncurrent market value \n1 year\u2019s advance notice to harvest \ncrops, otherwise anticipated \nharvest to be fully compensated at \nmarket value \nExtreme care by contractors to \navoid damaging property, \nand immediate payment by \ncontractor where damage does \noccur to affected families, groups, \ncommunities, or government \nagencies  \nLump-sum payment for actual \ncost of transporting household \neffects and old and new building \nmaterials to the new site \nLump-sum payment to cover a \nfood allowance and suitable \ndevelopment assistance \n\nAssessment of suitability of \nrelocation sites  \nReview of shop recorded \nduring survey \nDetailed survey of final impact \narea and identification of \nbeneficiaries  \nConsensus among \nstakeholders on valuation \nassessment  \n\nDamaged property restored \nimmediately to its former \ncondition \n\nStakeholder consensus on \namounts  \n\nStakeholder consensus on \namounts  \n\nType of Loss \nDwellings (possibly \nonly two affected) \n\nResidential land \n(0.25 ha possibly \naffected) \nExpenses of \nresidential \nrelocation \nRice storage bins \n(none affected) \nSmall retail shops \n(none affected) \nAgricultural land  \n\nCrops and trees  \n\nEntitled Persons \nRegistered taxpayer or \noccupant identified \nduring survey \nRegistered taxpayer or \noccupant identified \nduring survey \nRegistered taxpayer or \noccupant identified \nduring survey \nOwner identified during \nsurvey \nOwner identified during \nsurvey \nOwner or person with \nusage rights identified \nduring survey \nOwner or person with \ncustomary usage \nrights  \n\nTemporary impact \nduring construction \n\nOwner or person with \nusage rights identified \nduring survey \n\nRelocating household \n\nAll persons displaced \nand severely affected \ndue to the loss of \nincome and means of \nlivelihood \n\nTransport \nallowance \n\nTransition \nallowance \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nF. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n6. \nEdL  established  the  Environmental  and  Social  Management  Office  to  monitor \nresettlement  plan  implementation.  The  office  is  staffed  by  an  experienced  environmental \nspecialist  manager,  and  three  other  environmental  specialists  and  one  social  specialist,  but \nneeds more qualified social and environmental expertise. The Project will help EdL recruit and \ntrain one more social development and one rural development specialist. \n\nG. \n\nPreliminary Compensation Budget \n\n7. \nAn  amount  of  $250,000  has  been  estimated  for  compensation  and  resettlement \nactivities.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  it  meets  any  budget  shortfall  needed  to  meet  the \nresettlement plan objectives, once the resettlement plan is updated. \n\nH. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe preparation and implementation of the updated resettlement plan will be monitored \n8. \nby the Environmental and Social Management Office with help from the consultants. They will \nmaintain a database of resettlement monitoring information. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n71 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty  \npartnership agreement? Yes \n\nA. \nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \nYes \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR): \n \n1.  The poor in the Lao  PDR are heavily burdened by lack of access to modern energy. Poor women are particularly \naffected as they are responsible for food processing. They spend a large proportion of scarce household cash \nincome on alternative but less efficient sources of energy, are exposed to inadequate and smoky lighting, have \nlittle access to information, have little social activity, and spend long hours producing manual energy. Vaccines, \nmedication,  and  animal  vaccines  cannot  be  stored  nearby.  Children  have  less  time  for  studying. People feel \nunsafe at night. Fuel poverty particularly affects the poor because their cash income is scarce, their workload is \nheavy, and opportunity cost of time high. Inadequate and expensive sources of energy affect reduce the poor\u2019s \nability  to  diversify  livelihood  and  income  activities.  Access  to  modern  energy  will  significantly  reduce  the \nvulnerability  of  poor  households;  reduce  their  expenditure  on  energy;  improve  their  quality  of  life;  provide \nincreased access to information; and help reduce workload, especially for women. \n\n \n2.  Access to modern sources of energy and the grid in particular is also an equity issue. Access to the grid means \naccess  to  subsidized  energy.  Most  of  the  poor  do  not  have  access  to  the  grid  and,  thus,  indirectly  pay  for \nsubsidies  that  do  not  benefit  them.  The  poor  with  no  access  spend  more  on  energy  than  the  nonpoor.  Grid \nexpansion and connecting the poor will substantially reduce these inequities.  \n\n \n3.  Electricity  is  a  key  input  to  food  processing  and  small-scale  enterprise  development. Reliable electricity supply \nwill  reduce  barriers  to  expand  and  enhance  productivity.  Increased  rural  commercial  activity  is  key  to  reduce \npoverty.  Improved  electricity  supply  will  lift  a  significant  constraint  on  economic  growth  and  enable  the  poor to \ncapture the benefits of economic growth.  \n\nPoverty Analysis Classification: Poverty Intervention \n\n \n \nB. \nPoverty Profile: \n \n4.  The  poverty  profile  is  based  on  district  poverty  data  from  the  latest  Lao  expenditure  consumption  survey \n(1997/98).  The  estimated  poverty  incidence  among  targeted  beneficiaries  is  43.4%.  Poor  households  make  up \n41.5% of the total. Nearly 60% of the project beneficiaries are poor, compared to 39% of the total population. \nMost  of  the  poor  in  the  project  area  are  ethnic  minorities.  Na  Mo  is  one  of  the  poorest  districts,  with  the  poor \nmaking up more than 92% of the population. \n\n \nConnecting the Poor: \n \n5.  To ensure that they can fully benefit from rural electrification and existing power subsidies, the poor need to have \ndirect access to the grid. Investments in the sector, therefore, should be targeted at the poor. However, targeting \ninvestments  may  be  inefficient  if  barriers  prevent  poor  households  from  directly  accessing  electricity.  For \ninstance, if the poor are unable to connect, they will not be able to save on expenditures. As the sector contains \nsignificant  subsidies,  an  important  aspect  is  the  inability  to  target  subsidies  when  the  poor  are  excluded  from \naccess. This has strong distributional effects. If the sector is to become more pro-poor, barriers must be brought \ndown. Two up-front barriers were identified as potentially reducing the poverty impact of the Project and of future \ninvestments.  \n\n \n6.  The  first  barrier  is  the  policy  of  cost  sharing,  where  the  village  contributes  30%  of  the  low-voltage  distribution \ncosts. This was found to have two apparent effects. First, cost sharing burdens poor more than nonpoor villages. \nAs poor villages are more remote and have fewer households (including those who can afford to pay), they pay \nmore per capita than nonpoor villages in less remote areas. Second, poor villages may be deterred entirely from \nconnecting because it is unaffordable. Thus, none of the potential poverty impacts of investments in the sector \nwould  be  realized.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  found that Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) was already having difficulty \ncollecting  village  contributions.  MIH  and  EdL  recognized  the  inequity  of  the  policy  and  abolished  cost  sharing \npolicy.  \n\n \n7.  The  second  barrier  to  access  included  the  lump-sum  up-front  charges  for  connection  paid  by  individual \nhouseholds. While the poor may still indirectly benefit in many ways from electrification, poverty impacts will not \nbe  fully  realized  if  the  poor  are  deprived  of  the  most  immediate  and  direct  impact  of  expenditure  savings.  The \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nbe  fully  realized  if  the  poor  are  deprived  of  the  most  immediate  and  direct  impact  of  expenditure  savings.  The \nFact-Finding  Mission\u2019s  findings  confirm  that  poor  households  in  electrified  villages  are  either  not  connected  or \nconnect through shared (illegal) connections, and charged a substantially higher flat rate per kilowatt-hour. Thus, \neven if poor households are connected, they still do not fully benefit from sector subsidies. Most households in \nelectrified  areas  were  able  to  pay  the  initial  up-front  charges  by  selling  cattle  or  borrowing  from  relatives.  No \ncredit,  beyond  borrowing  from  relatives,  was  available.  Some  individuals  had  managed  to  negotiate  with  EdL \nstaff to be allowed to amortize the payment. However, the poor are less able to negotiate amortization than the \nnonpoor.  The  poor  said  they  would  connect  if  up-front  charges  could  be  paid  over  a  longer  time. Therefore, \nformalizing amortization was found to be a viable option to connect poor households. \n\n \n8.  Under EdL\u2019s new connection policy, wiring from the pole to the house and inside wiring have been handed over \nto the private sector1.  The  connection  fee,  cost for installation and material, administration charges, and meter \ndeposit are charged by EdL. It has agreed to offer new consumers the option of amortizing their share of the up-\nfront charges over up to 12 months. This option will apply to residential consumers with 3-ampere connections.2 \nTo  ensure  consistency  of  business  practices  across  branch  offices,  the  amortization  will  apply  to  all  new \nconsumers  and  not  limited  to  consumers  connected  under  ADB-supported  projects.  The  private  sector  is \nexpected to provide credit to households unable to pay in lump sum. This will ensure some economies of scale in \nproviding wiring to villages connected to the grid. However, EdL should carefully monitor private sector services \nto ensure that they are affordable, of good quality, and safe. \n\n \nExpected Impacts on the Poor: \n \n9.  The most immediate and direct impact of providing reliable electricity services to the poor is expenditure savings \n\non energy (Table A15). \n\nTable A15: Immediate Impact on Poor Households: Cash Savings  \n(average KN/month) \n\n \nHH Diesel \nExpenditure \n@ 3 liters/ \nmonth \n\n10,500 \n12,000 \n\n13,500 \n \n\nInitial HH \nElectricity \nexpenditure \n \n@ 4 kWh \n319 \n319 \n\n319 \n1740 \n\nNon-\nelectrified \n\n14.1 \n16.1 \n\n18.1 \n \n\n \n\nShare of HH Cash \nIncome (%) \n\n \nShare of Total HH Expenditure \n(%) \n \nElectrified \n0.23 \n0.23 \n\n \nNon-electrified \n7.4 \n8.5 \n\n \nElectrified \n0.43 \n0.43 \n\n0.43 \n2.3 \n\n9.5 \n \n\n0.23 \n1.2 \n\nLocation \n\nLess remote \nIntermediate \nremote \nVery remote \nConsumption  @ \n20 kWh \n\nHH = household, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Lao National Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2 1997/98. \nCalculations based on average cash income and expenditure of poor households for the country as a whole. \nCost and consumption data are based on findings from field visits. \n \n10.  The  poor  spend  14-18%  of  their  cash  income  on  unreliable  and  poor-quality  energy  for  lighting.  Access  to \nreliable grid supply of electricity would significantly reduce cash expenditure to well below 1% of cash income or \ntotal household expenditure. Most rural poor households have a high degree of subsistence with scarce cash \nincome. The fungibility of available cash will divert household expenditure to other items and change household \nexpenditure  patterns.  As  households  are  able  to  diversify  livelihoods  and  earn  cash,  appliances  will  become \naffordable  and  demand  for  electricity  expand for other purposes than lighting. Poor households increase their \nconsumption sharply during the first 2 years of connection. Consumption levels for poor households will likely be \naround 20-50 kWh per month, with expenditure shares at about 2-4% of cash income.  \n\n \n11.  Another significant economic effect on poor households of providing electricity to villages is the reduction of food-\nprocessing  costs.  Most  villages  have  rice  mills  operating  on  diesel,  the  high  cost  of  which  is  transferred  to \nconsumers, which may  deter  the  poor  from  using  modern  rice  processing,  leave  them  with  manual  processing \nmethods,  and  ultimately  raise  food  prices.  The  cost  of  food  processing  would  be  expected  to  decrease  as  a \nresult  of  village  electrification  whether  the  poor  household  is  electrified  or  not.  As  poor  households  spend  a \nhigher  share  of  their  expenditure  on  food  (the  sum  of  own  produce  and  purchased  food)  than  nonpoor,  a \nreduction in food prices would disproportionately benefit the poor.  \n\n                                                 \n1 An exception to the new policy is connections for shield wiring along transmission lines where EdL will complete all \n\nconnection tasks. \n\n2  Poor households are unlikely to connect to loads above 3 amperes. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n73 \n\nreduction in food prices would disproportionately benefit the poor.  \n\n \n12.  Analysis  of  poor  households\u2019  expenditure  patterns  suggests  that  they  are  affected  by  electrification.  A  simple \n\nregression model gave the following results:  \n\nln(food expenditure/total expenditure)=3.80*-0.080* el+0.059* ln(per capita expenditure)+0.07*Region \n\nR2=0.24, n=3391 \n(* Denotes statistical significance at 0.01 level) \n \nAlthough  this  simple  model  may  only  explain  a  part  of  expenditure  patterns,  the  results  suggest  that \nelectrification reduces food expenditure shares by 8% when controlling for household per capita expenditure and \nregional differences. On average non-electrified poor households spend 76% of their total expenditure on food, \ncompared  with  64%  for  electrified  poor  households,  which  may  be  a  result  of  a  combined  effect  of  increased \nincomes  and  a  reduction  of  food  prices.  Food  prices  are  expected  to  go  down  due  to  more  efficient  food \nprocessing. \n\n \n13.  Other  impacts  of  electrification  on  the  poor  include  increased  social  activity;  more  access  to  information  and \nenjoyment  from  television;  ability  of  children  to  study  at  night;  and  ability  to  better  store  vaccines,  other \nmedications, and animal vaccines. Electrification will significantly reduce the workload for women and give them \ntime for other activities. Data suggest that women\u2019s time spent on food processing will be reduced from 14 to 5 \nhours  if  electricity  is  available,  significantly  benefiting  women\u2019s  health.  While  many  of  these  social  benefits  are \ndifficult to quantify and are subjective opinions of the poor, they do reflect improvements in the quality of life and \nare  equally  important  to  expenditure  savings.  Many  of  the  social  benefits  occur  on  the  village  level  and  are \n\u201cpublic goods.\u201d Thus they do not exclude unconnected households in electrified villages.  \n\n \nAffordability of Tariff Increases: \n \n14.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  maintain  a  lifeline  tariff  at  consumption  levels  below  50  kWh,  well  within  the \nrange  of  consumption  levels  of  poor  households.  In  general,  the  poor\u2019s  consumption  is  determined  by  the \naffordability of appliances, and prices are relatively inelastic at these low levels of consumption. Therefore, the \npoor  can  be  expected  to  maintain  their  consumption  at  a  basic-needs  level  even  as  tariffs  increase.  At  a \nconsumption  of  50  kWh  per  month  a  poor  household  would,  assuming  initial  levels  of  income  or  expenditure, \nspend 5.8% of  cash  income  or  3.1  %  of  total  expenditure  on  electricity.  While  this  is  affordable,  incomes  are \nlikely to increase as a result of electrification, and the share spent on electricity would be even lower. Average \nper  capita  cash  income  earnings  (excluding  remittances and pensions to reflect income potential) is about 3.4 \ntimes  higher  for  electrified  than  non-electrified poor households, suggesting that the share spent on electricity \nwould be about 2%.  \n\n \n15.  Assuming no sector subsidies and an increase in the lifeline tariff to cost recovery level (from 87 KN/kWh to 947 \nKN/kWh), the share of cash income spent on electricity would be 7% for 20 kWh per month and 18% for 50 kWh. \nAt the initial consumption level of 4 kWh per month the share would be 1.5%. Differences  in total expenditure of \nelectrified  and  non-electrified  households  is  negligible.  The  corresponding  expenditure  shares  for  electricity \nwould be 2% at 4kWh, 13% at 20 kWh, and 33% for 50 kWh. Thus, while tariff increases are affordable for the \npoor,  cost  recovery  tariffs  at  these  low  levels  of  consumption  will  probably  not  be  sustainable.  As  the  poor \nconsume so little, a well-targeted lifeline would be affordable.  \n\n \nC. \n16.  Stakeholder  analysis  prepared.
