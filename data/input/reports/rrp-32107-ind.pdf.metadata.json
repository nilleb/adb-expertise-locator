Transmission  services  to  delinquent  states  will  be  suspended  but\nstates that have implemented power sector reform programs will receive\npreference for investment under the proposed loan. The proposed Project\nwill provide strong transmission networks to create flexibility to switch the\npower supply from delinquent or nonreforming states to states that have\ngood  payment  records  and  have  implemented  or  will  implement  sector\nreform.  The  sector  loan  modality  is  being  adopted,  which  provides\nflexibility  in  choosing  subprojects  that    meet  the  criteria  agreed  upon  by\nPowergrid and  the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n\nThe Project comprises two components: part A: upgrading and expansion\nof 400 kilovolt (kV), 220 kV, and 132 kV transmission systems to transfer\nadditional  power,  to  improve  system  reliability,  and  to  enhance  the\nefficient  utilization  of  power  plants;  and  part  B:  establishing  400  kV  and\n220  kV  transmission  systems  to  evacuate  the  power  generated  by  the\npower  stations  of  the  central  power  utilities  and  independent  power\nproducers.\n\nThe  Project\u2019s  strategic  objectives  are  to  (i)  enhance  private  sector\nparticipation  in  the  power  sector;  (ii) strengthen  the  newly  established\nregulatory mechanisms by pricing bulk supply and power transmission on\na sound economic basis; and (iii) enhance the autonomy of Powergrid by\nassisting its transition from Government-guaranteed programs and funds\nto market-based ones.

The reforms continue to be supported by ADB at both levels and\nare  now  approaching  self-sustainability  at  the  central  level  where  Powergrid  is  playing  an\nimportant role in initiating and accelerating the reform process through increasing competition in\nthe  sector  and  through  greater  commercialization.  Powergrid\u2019s  investments  are,  therefore,\naccorded priority by the Government of India. This loan will be ADB\u2019s second loan in support of\nPowergrid\u2019s  operations.  For  India,  this  will  be  the  first  time  that  international  commercial\ncofinancing  is  raised  using  ADB's  partial  credit  guarantee  after  approval  of  the  ADB's  new\nGuarantee  Policy  in  1995.    Loan  fact-finding  was  carried  out  during  11-22  May  1998  and\nappraisal from 7 to 19 September 1998.1\n\nPowergrid\u2019s  investment  program  is  well  conceived  and  meets  the  priority  needs  of  the\n3.\nnational economy.  Powergrid\u2019s competence as an executing agency has been demonstrated by\nthe successful implementation of the ongoing loan 2, including its policy issues. A sector loan is\ntherefore considered appropriate to finance a portion of Powergrid\u2019s investments over the next\nfive  years.    Through  the  sector  loan  approach,  ADB  can  support  Powergrid  to  improve  power\nsystem performance, facilitate further sector reform in central sector agencies, as well as cause\nstates  to  accelerate  their  power  sector  reforms.  A  sector  loan  approach  will  internalize  the\nprocess  of  choosing  subprojects  that  meet  technical,  financial,  economic,  environmental,  and\nsocial criteria appropriate to modernizing the sector. The sector loan approach will also provide\nPowergrid  with  sufficient  flexibility  to  optimally  utilize  the  commercial  cofinancing  raised  using\nADB\u2019s partial credit guarantee facility. Appendix 1 gives the project framework.\n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\n4.\nIndia\u2019s economy has grown by about  6 percent annually over the last five years. While it\nis important for India to adopt a macroeconomic framework conducive to ensuring sustainable\ngrowth,  the  Government  needs  to  pay  equal  attention  to  removing  infrastructure  deficiencies\nthat present severe bottlenecks in the continued expansion of the economy. Estimates indicate\nthat the level of investment in infrastructure needs to be increased by almost 50 percent in real\n\n                                                \n1  The  Mission  comprised  H.  Nakajima,  Project  Engineer/Mission  Leader;  R.  Vokes,  Senior  Programs  Officer,\nT.D. Hodgkinson,  Senior  Cofinancing  Officer;  E.  Brotoisworo,  Senior  Environment  Specialist;  V.  S.  Rekha,\nCounsel;  S. Chander,  Senior  Project  Engineer;  K.  Moktan,  Senior  Financial  Analyst;  and  D.  Graczyk,  Project\nEconomist. ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission provided assistance to the Mission.  In January 2000, the appraisal  was\nupdated  by  a  mission  comprising  S.  Chander,  Senior  Project  Engineer/  Mission  Leader,  K.  Moktan,  Senior\nFinancial Analyst, D. Graczyk, Project Economist and M. Hamano, Project Engineer.\n\n2  Loan 1405-IND: Power Transmission (Sector) Project, for $275 million, approved on 16 November 1995. The loan\n\ncloses on 31 March 2001.\n\n\f2\n\nterms during the next decade if India is to maintain a target annual growth of at least 7 percent,\nwhich is necessary for significantly reducing the incidence of poverty.\n\n5.\nElectricity  is  one  of  the  key  inputs  for  India\u2019s  overall  socioeconomic  development,\nespecially in commercial and industrial activities, and has strong linkage to other infrastructure\nsuch as transportation and telecommunications. Basic human needs such as water supply and\nsewerage,  and  many  social  welfare  activities  such  as  education  and  health  care,  are  also\ndirectly or indirectly supported by electricity supply. Although India\u2019s power sector has expanded\nrapidly,  continuous  power  shortages,  combined  with  poor  quality  of  supply,  severely  constrain\neconomic development in almost all parts of the country.\n\n6.\nThe  development  of  the  power  sector  is  currently  limited  by  two  major  factors:  public\nsector  funding  constraints,  and  the  absence  of  the  required  long-term  policy  and  regulatory\nframework for enhanced private investment in the sector. Public sector funding constraints are\ndirectly  linked  to  the  broader  issue  of  the  system  of  subsidies  in  the  Indian economy.  In  fiscal\nyear  (FY)1999,  total  budgetary  subsidies  at  the  central  and  state  levels  amounted  to\nRs557.26 billion ($12.8 billion), or over 3.1 percent of India's gross domestic product.\n\n7.\nOf these subsidies, Rs225.37 billion ($5.18 billion), or about 40 percent of the total, was\nchanneled to the power sector to compensate the utilities for the lower-than-supply cost tariffs\nfor certain consumers groups. Adjustment of tariffs to achieve higher cost recovery not only is\ncrucial  to  increase  the  self-financing  position  of  public  sector  power  entities  but  has  a  direct\nbearing on further commercialization and privatization of the power sector. The chronic financial\ndifficulties  of  most  state  electricity  boards  (SEBs)  account  for  much  of  the  sector\u2019s  difficulties.\nCollectively, SEBs have a high level of accounts payable to central power agencies that supply\nelectricity to them, threatening the financial viability of these agencies.\n\n8.\nThe present status of the power sector also reflects attempts to politically manage such\na large and complex system, and the limited autonomy under which many of the power utilities\noperate. Establishing an independent regulatory body at central and state levels is essential to\nensure  the  commercial  and  technical  soundness  of  the  power  sector  and  the  autonomy  of\npower sector entities from political interference.\n\nA. \n\nPower Sector Overview\n\n1. \n\nOrganization\n\n9.\nIndia consists of 25 states and 7 union territories with a total population of over 1 billion.\nIts  power  sector  is  the  third  largest  in  Asia  after  that  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and\nJapan. Installed generation capacity grew from about 2,000 megawatts (MW) in 1950 to about\n98,000 MW as of 31 March 2000, with an additional 12,000 MW of captive generation capacity.\nThere  are  more  than  77 million  electricity  consumers  and  about  86  percent  of  villages  have\nbeen electrified. However, the annual per capita consumption was only about 360 kilowatt-hours\n(kWh)  in  FY2000,  which  is  lower  than  the  consumption  levels  of  many  other  developing\ncountries.\n\n10.\nThe  organization  of  the  power  sector  is  determined  by  India\u2019s  federal  structure.  The\nGovernment\u2019s  Ministry  of  Power  provides  overall  guidance  to  the  sector,  mainly  through  the\nCentral  Electricity  Authority  (CEA),  and  owns  the  central  power  sector  utilities  such  as  the\nNational  Thermal  Power  Corporation  (NTPC),  the  National  Hydro-electric  Power  Corporation\n(NHPC), the Nuclear Power Corporation (NPC), and Powergrid, and financing institutions such\n\n\f3\n\nas  the  Power  Finance  Corporation  (PFC)  and  the  Rural  Electrification  Corporation.  State\ngovernments  control  the  rest  of  the  sector  through  17 SEBs  and  12  electricity  departments\n(EDs). These SEBs and EDs provide distribution facilities and set retail tariffs. Power generation\nand  transmission  are  split  between  the  central  power  sector  agencies  and  SEBs.  The  central\nagencies  own  and  operate  32 percent  of  the  country\u2019s  total  generation,  while  SEBs  and  EDs\nhave  64  percent  of  the  total.  In  addition,  five  private  utilities  in  urban  agglomerations  have  a\nshare of 4 percent in power generation.\n\n11.\nAs a result of India\u2019s federal structure, all major issues affecting the power sector require\nconcurrent action by the Government and state governments. Although the structure gives the\nGovernment  a  say  in  the  affairs  of  the  power  sectors  of  the  states,  this  shared  responsibility\nlimits  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  influence  the  power  sector  policies  of  state  governments,\nespecially with respect to retail tariffs.\n\n2. \n\nState Electricity Boards\n\n12.\nPrior to the reorganization of the power sectors in the states of Orissa (1996), Haryana\n(1998), Andhra Pradesh (1999), Karnataka (1999), and Uttar Pradesh (2000), the power sector\nin  every  major  state  was  organized  through  its  SEB.  Even  today,  other  than  in  these  states,\nSEBs  still  control  the  operations  of  the  sector.  The  Electricity  Act  of  1910  and  the  Electricity\nSupply  Act  of  1948  with  their  several  amendments  provide  the  legal  basis  for  the  sector\u2019s\nfunctioning  and  utilities\u2019  operation.  These  acts  allow  considerable  managerial  and  financial\nautonomy  to  the  SEBs,  but  this  autonomy  is  often  nominal  as  most  state  governments  use\nSEBs to pursue noncommercial objectives, particularly to provide low-priced or free electricity to\nthe agriculture sector. Initially, this cross-subsidization was done to provide low-cost inputs for\nagriculture  to  stimulate  food  production  and  was  very  successful.  However,  that  stage  is  now\nwell past but  the practice has continued largely to attract political support. State governments\nalso  tend  to  interfere  with  SEB\u2019s  day-to-day  operations,  thus  complicating  the  task  of  SEB\nmanagement.  These  interventions  have  led  to  the  SEBs\u2019  deteriorating  financial  health,  which\nhas become the central problem of India\u2019s power sector.\n\n13.\nSeveral years of negative internal cash generation has impoverished the SEBs, impeded\nthe construction of new power facilities, and restricted the funds available for maintenance and\nrehabilitation  of  existing  assets,  thus  making  it  impossible  to  close  the  demand-supply  gap.\nChronic power shortages and poor quality of power supply continue to plague the economy in\nalmost all parts of the country. If not remedied, the unavailability of sufficient power will be the\nsingle most important constraint to economic development in the coming years and will thwart\nthe Government\u2019s efforts to attract domestic and foreign investment.\n\n14.\nA reform of the power sector at the state level is urgently needed to reduce the need for\nsubsidies and public spending on the sector. As a result of the state governments' interference\nin  SEB  operation  and  subsidies  to  agriculture  customers,  the  sector\u2019s  losses  in  FY1999\naggregated  to  Rs63.3  billion  ($1.4  billion),  but  were  reduced  to  Rs45.0 billion  ($1.0  billion)  by\nsubsidies from state governments. Power sector reform would significantly reduce claims on the\ncountry\u2019s fiscal resources and allow additional spending on other priority sectors such as health\nand education, which are essential for poverty reduction.\n\n3. \n\nCentral Power Utilities\n\n15.\nUntil  1972,  the  SEBs  were  almost  solely  responsible  for  development  of  power\ngeneration and transmission within their states but were unable to meet the rapidly increasing\n\n\f4\n\ndemand for electricity. To improve the efficiency of generation, three central sector agencies -\nNTPC, NHPC and NPC, were established in 1975 to generate bulk power for sale to SEBs. In\n1989,  Powergrid  was  established  as  a  transmission  and  dispatch  company  by  amalgamating\nthe transmission and dispatch assets of all central power sector agencies. In addition to these\nwholly  owned  companies,  the  Government  also  has  shares  in  special-purpose  generating\ncompanies such as the Bhakra-Beas Management Board, the Damodar Valley Corporation, the\nTehri Power Corporation, the Nathpa-Jhakhri Power Corporation, the North-East Electric Power\nCorporation, and the Neyveli Lignite Corporation.\n\nThe central agencies, including NTPC, NHPC, and Powergrid, are seriously affected by\n16.\nthe  poor  financial  health  of  most  SEBs,  as  was  evidenced  several  times  in  the  past  when\nexcessive accounts receivable from the SEBs seriously impaired the central agencies\u2019 financial\nliquidity.  To  resolve  this  problem,  NTPC  has,  in  addition  to  restricting  supply  and  obtaining\nGovernment appropriation to settle debts of SEBs, even resorted to taking over the generation\nfacilities of SEBs in settlement of accounts receivable.3\n\n4.\n\nPowergrid\n\n17.\nPrior  to  1991,  NTPC  and  other  central  sector  generating  companies  constructed  and\noperated the transmission facilities to evacuate power from their power plants and transmit the\npower  to  client  SEBs.  As  the  transmission  systems  grew,  it  was  recognized  that  it  would  be\nmore  efficient  to  have  a  national  transmission  utility  that  would  be  responsible  for  the\ntransmission  systems  required  to  evacuate  power  from  the  central  sector  power  plants,  and\nconstruct  and  operate  the  transmission  and  dispatch  facilities  required  for  power  interchange\namong SEBs within a region and for interchanges between regions.\n\n18.\nTo  serve  that  purpose,  Powergrid  was  established  in  October  1989  as  a  Government-\nowned corporation and commenced operation in late 1991. It has been profitable since its first\nfull year of commercial operation in FY1993, and is expected to remain so. The development of\nPowergrid was planned in three phases. The first phase, which was completed in 1992, involved\nthe transfer of transmission facilities and associated staff from the other central sector agencies\nto Powergrid. The second phase of development involved taking over from CEA  the operations\nof the regional system coordination centers (RSCCs) and associated communication facilities in\neach region. This was accomplished in 1996.\n\nThe  third  phase,  which  is  ongoing,  is  the  development  of  a  national  transmission  grid\n19.\nand  facilities  for  intensified  interregional  cooperation  and  coordination.  Transmission  links\nbetween the five power regions are very limited, 4 and the different regions are not synchronized\nin  frequency.  The  development  of  a  national  grid  will  enhance  operational  efficiency  by  the\nsharing of reserve margins, trading of surplus generation between regions, and long-term power\ntransfer from regions with low-cost hydropower or coal resources. Powergrid will now construct\nand  operate  new  RSCC  facilities,  which  will  improve  the  coordination  of  regional  grids  and\nfacilitate bulk power trading between SEBs. Development of additional transmission facilities for\n\n                                                \n3  As part of the agreement to change the executing agency for Loan 907-IND Unchahar Thermal Power Project for\n$160.0 million approved on 29September 1988 to NTPC, ADB, the Government, the Government of Uttar Pradesh,\nand  NTPC  agreed  to  transfer  title  to  the  420-MW  Stage-I  to  NTPC.  NTPC  has  since  taken  over  the  Talcher\nThermal Power Station from Orissa SEB, and the Tanda Thermal Power Station from Uttar Pradesh SEB.\n\n4  Transmission links between regions are set up by high voltage direct current (HVDC) back-to-back connections or\nradial alternating current connections with isolated systems, because of lack of frequency control and power flow\ncontrol schemes.\n\n\f5\n\nnew central sector power stations and for power trading between SEBs within a region will also\ncontinue.\n\n20.\nAs on 31 March 2000, Powergrid owned and operated 28,985 circuit kilometers (cct-km)\nof  800  kV  and  400  kV  transmission  lines,  1,630  cct-km  of  500  kV  high  voltage  direct  current\n(HVDC)  transmission  lines,  8,402  cct-km  of  220  kV  and  132  kV  transmission  lines,  3  HVDC\nback-to  back  links,  5  load  dispatch  centers,  and  65  extra  high  voltage  substations  with  a  total\ntransformation  capacity  of  31,655  megavolt-amperes  (MVA),  making  it  one  of  the  largest\ntransmission systems companies in the world.\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1. \n\nOverall Power Sector Reform\n\n21.\nDespite  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  Indian  power  system  over  the  last  50  years,  power\nshortage is currently estimated to be about 11.3 percent of peak load and 8.3 percent of energy\nsupply on an all India basis, although this varies considerably from region to region. Electricity\ndemand is expected to grow rapidly. The planned capacity addition during 1997 to 2002 is about\n40,000  MW,  although  it  is  expected  that  only  about  25,000  MW  of  additional  capacity  would\nactually be realized. About $5 billion in investment will be necessary to transmit output power of\nsuch large-scale additional generating capacity with adequate reliability and quality. Powergrid\nas  the  central  agency  responsible  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  main  bulk\ntransmission network has planned substantial investments during the next five years for system\nexpansion and strengthening (Appendix 2).\n\nIn  October  1994,  the  National  Development  Council,5  (NDC)  submitted  a  key  policy\n22.\nreport on power sector reform which recommended: (i) organizational reforms at the state level,\nconsisting  of  commercialization  and  unbundling  of  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution;\n(ii) organizational reforms at the regional and national levels aimed at strengthening the role of\nthe  central  sector  agencies,  freeing  them  from  governmental  control,  allowing  them  to\nimplement  new  projects  on  a  joint-venture  basis  with  the  private  sector,  ultimately  reducing\nGovernment\u2019s  equity  in  them  to  not  more  than  26  percent;  (iii)  large-scale  involvement  of  the\nprivate sector in generation and distribution, with the sponsors selected through transparent and\ncompetitive bidding procedures; (iv) depoliticizing electricity tariff setting by creating a national\ntariff  board  for  regulating  bulk  and  transmission  tariffs  at  the  national  level  and  regional  tariff\nboards for regulating bulk and retail tariffs for both public and private utilities at the state level;\nand (v) progressive phasing out of subsidies to agriculture consumers, with a minimum tariff of\nnot less than 50 percent of the average cost of supply. These recommendations, especially the\nissues  related  to  the  autonomy,  regulation  and  tariff  setting  in  central  sector  agencies,  were\nlargely the result of sustained policy dialogue by ADB and the World Bank, and ADB\u2019s technical\nassistance 6 (TA).\n\n23.\nThese recommendations have been confirmed in meetings of the power ministers of the\nGovernment and the states in October and December 1996 as the \u201cCommon Minimum National\nAction  Plan  for  Power.\u201d  Key  elements  of  the  plan  include;  (i)  establishing  state  regulatory\ncommissions;  (ii)  rationalizing  tariffs  to  ensure  that  each  consumer  category  provides  at  least\n50 percent  cost  recovery;  (iii)  agriculture  tariffs  be  set  at  Rs  0.50/  kWh    ($  0.015/  kWh)\n\n                                                \n5  NDC  is  India\u2019s  highest  political  body.  It  is  chaired  by  the  prime  minister  and  comprises  the  Chief  Ministers  of  all\n\nstates in India.\n\n6  TA 1756-IND: Study of Bulk Supply and Transmission Tariffs and Transmission Regulation, for $600,000 approved\n\non 29 September 1992, completed in February 1994.\n\n\f6\n\nimmediately and achieve 50 percent cost recovery within three years: and (iv) enhanced private\nsector participation.\n\n24.\nIn line with the above policy, the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act 1998 (ERC Act)\nwas  approved  by  the  Indian  Parliament  on  2  July  1998.  Thereafter,  on  24  July  1998,  the\nGovernment appointed the members of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission  (CERC),\nwhich was established through the ERC Act. Under the ERC Act, the CERC has full authority to\nregulate central power utilities and set bulk tariffs. The ERC Act also urges state governments to\nestablish  state  electricity  regulatory  commissions  (SERCs)  with  full  authority  on  state-level\npower  utilities.  Since  power  sector  reform  at  the  state  level  varies,  a  uniform  approach  in\nestablishing the SERCs is necessary because of increasing interstate/regional power exchange\ndue  to  large-scale  generation  projects  by  central  power  utilities  and  independent  power\nproducers. The ERC Act, therefore, provides strong legislative support for power sector reform\nat the state level through CERC\u2019s guidelines on bulk power tariffs and establishment of model\nSERCs.  The  passage  of  the  ERC  Act  is  a  milestone  action  of  the  Government  toward  sector\nreform.  On  28  July  1998,  the  Indian  Parliament  approved  the  amendment  to  the  Electricity\n(Supply) Act, 1948 to allow private sector participation in the transmission subsector. With the\npassage of this amendment, all subsectors of the power sector were opened to private sector\nparticipation.\n\n  Good  governance  at  both  the  macro-sector  and  the  corporate  levels  is  being\n25.\nemphasized  in  the  reform  process.  At  the  sector  level,  governance  is  sought  to  be  improved\nthrough  predictability  (long-term  planning,  codification  and  simplification  of  rules  and\nregulations,  and  predictable  policies  on  tariffs),  transparency  (systematic  dissemination  of\nrelevant  sector  information,  independent  regulatory  commissions,  public  hearings  on  issues\nbefore  they  are  decided),  and  accountability    (cause-effect  structure  of  incentives).  At  the\ncorporate  level,  governance  is  being  enhanced  through  corporatization,  independence  of  the\nboards  of  directors  from  the  Government,  defined  delegation  of  powers  to  staff,  computerized\nmanagement information systems, and commercialization of activities.\n\n2. \n\nSector Reform at State Level\n\nOn account of their high technical and nontechnical losses, as well as the low tariffs set\n26.\nfor  agriculture  consumers,  all  SEBs  lack  the  necessary  investment  funds  to  undertake\nexpansion, renovation, and modernization programs. Weak financial and commercial viability of\nSEBs is also inhibiting private entrepreneurs from participating in the entire power sector from\ngeneration through transmission to distribution. Therefore, the most critical part of sector reform\nis at the state level. State governments must resolve three major issues: (i) the tariff structure\nneeds  to  be  revised  to  reflect  the  cost  of  supply  based  on  metered  energy;  (ii)  subsidies  to\nspecific  customer  categories  should  be  provided  explicitly  through  institutional  measures  such\nas the state budget;  and (iii) autonomy and accountability need to be delegated to the electric\nutility  business  on  a  commercial  basis.  In  principle,  the  Government  and  state  governments\nhave agreed that these issues can be resolved by (i) the unbundling of the SEB\u2019s activities into\ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  and  vesting  these  functional  responsibilities  with\ndifferent  entities;  (ii)  corporatization  of  the  new  successor  entities;  (iii)  establishment  of  an\nindependent body to regulate sector issues such as tariff setting; and (iv) facilitation of private\nsector participation in generation and; if viable and justified, in distribution and transmission.\n\nIn line with the above framework, several state governments have undertaken studies on\n27.\npower sector reform in association with aid agencies such as ADB, World Bank, Department for\nInternational\nInternational  Development  (DFID)  of \n\nthe  United  Kingdom, \n\nthe  Canadian \n\n\f7\n\nDevelopment  Agency  (CIDA),  and  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development\n(USAID).  Orissa  State  is  the  first  state  to  commission  such  studies  and  implement  reforms.\nSeveral  other  states  (Andhra  Pradesh,  Assam,  Gujarat,  Haryana,  Karnataka,  Kerala,  Madhya\nPradesh,  Punjab,  Rajasthan,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  West  Bengal)  have  also  initiated  reforms\nand/or studies for reforms.\n\nADB  is  supporting  reforms  in  Gujarat  and  Madhya  Pradesh.  Four  TAs7  supporting  the\n28.\nreforms  in  Gujarat  have  been  implemented  and  one  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  CIDA,  is  supporting\nADB\u2019s effort in Madhya Pradesh and is funding two of the studies. In addition, CIDA has, on its\nown,  also assisted the state of Kerala, which has been designated as the third focal state for\nADB\u2019s assistance, in carrying out comprehensive studies for power sector reform.\n\n29.\nIn  addition  to  its  support  for  power  sector  reforms  in  the  three  focal  states  of  Gujarat,\nMadhya Pradesh, and Kerala, ADB and USAID have accorded TA for supporting PFC 8. The TA\nwill conduct studies to aid the restructuring of the power sector in the states of Assam, Punjab,\nand West Bengal.\n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation\n\n30.\nDuring  the  period  1991-1994,  the  Government  formulated  policies  to  attract  private\nsector  investments  mainly  in  power  generation  by  offering  attractive  returns  on  private\ninvestments  through  measures  such  as  a  guaranteed  rate  of  return  on  equity,  counter-\nguarantees of the Government, and tax-exempt status. In response to the announcement of the\npolicy in 1991, more than 250 proposals were submitted by independent power producers (IPP).\nHowever, implementation of these private sector projects were delayed because of high capital\ncosts, and the potential foreign exchange liabilities of the Government on account of sovereign\nguarantees. As the projects were initially awarded on the basis of memoranda of understanding\nrather  than  through  competitive  bidding,  the  capital  costs  tended  to  be  higher  than  those  of\npublic sector projects, and resulted in higher tariffs. Unresolved issues related to tariffs, security\nof payment, and fuel supply have delayed progress on the private sector projects.9\n\n31.\nInadequate transmission infrastructure for power evacuation has been one of the major\nconstraints in the progress of some large-scale IPP projects. For example, one of the reasons\nfor  lack  of  financial  closure  for  some  IPP  power  projects  such  as  Cogentrix  (1,000  MW)  in\nKarnataka  was  the  uncertainty  of  finalizing  the  associated  transmission  project.  To  cover  the\nshortfall  in  transmission  investments,  on  10  August  1998  the  Indian  Parliament    enacted  the\nElectricity  Laws  (Amendment)  Act,  1998  (Transmission  Act)  to  recognize  transmission  as  an\nindependent  activity  that  can  also  be  implemented  through  private  sector  participation  in\ntransmission  projects.  Under  this  act,  a  transmission  license  can  be  granted  to  any  person,\nauthorizing  such  licensee  to  construct  and  maintain  any  interstate  or  intrastate  transmission\n\n                                                \n7  The TAs for Gujarat include: (i) 2738-IND: Preparation of a Power System Master Plan for $600,000; (ii) 2739-IND:\nDevelopment  of a Framework for Electricity Tariffs  for  $300,000;  (iii)  2740-IND: Review of Electricity Legislation\nand Regulations for $235,000; (iv) Financial Management Support to Kheda and Rajkot Distribution Profit Centers\nfor  $580,000;  all  approved  on  17  December  1996  and Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Project,  for\n$1,000,000 approved on 7 January 1998.\n\n8 TA No. 3305\u2013IND: Support to the Power Finance Corporation, for $1.0 million,  approved on 24 November 1999.\n9  Although  the  state  governments  tried  to  address  the  issue  of  security  of  payment  and  to  introduce  competitive\nbidding, capacity addition by the private sector during the period 1992-1999 was only about 2,600 MW. Recently,\nas  part  of  further  action  to  facilitate  private  sector  participation,  the  Government  decided  to  allow  the  state\ngovernments  to  clear,  without  reference  to  the  Foreign  Investment  Promotion  Board,  fully  foreign-owned  power\nplants, each up to an investment ceiling of Rs15 billion (approximately $376 million).\n\n\f8\n\nsystem under the direction, control, and supervision of the central or state transmission utilities,\nrespectively.\n\n32.\nSince Powergrid is the central agency responsible for the construction and operation of\nthe main transmission network in each region of India as well as for all interregional tie lines, it\nhas  been  entrusted  with  the  selection  of  sponsors  for  private  sector  and  joint-venture\ntransmission  projects  at  the  national  or  regional  level.  Since  real-time  operation  of  a  bulk\ntransmission  system  is  strongly  related  to  the  security,  reliability,  safety  of  the  power  system,\nand  fair  power  transactions,  private  companies  will  not  be  involved  in  the  operation  of\ntransmission lines, load dispatching, and coordination. The Government also proposed to apply\na  bulk  transmission  tariff  structure  for  these  projects  with  incentives  similar  to  those  for  IPPs,\nwith fixed charges based on the availability of the contracted transmission system.\n\n4. \n\nPowergrid\u2019s Role in the Reforms\n\n33.\nThe  three-phase  development  of  Powergrid\u2019s  transmission  systems  and  operations\ndescribed in paras. 18 and 19 will facilitate the restructuring of the power sector into separate\nand more efficient generation and distribution companies. The development of the regional and\nnational transmission grids and control centers will also improve the coordination and efficiency\nof power sector operations on regional and national basis. The World Bank\u2019s study \"India: Long-\nTerm  Issues  in  the  Power  Sector,\"  prepared  in  1991,  concluded  that  improved  coordination  in\nsystem  operations,  through  such  measures  as  effective  operation  of  the  regional  grids  and\nimproved bulk power tariffs, could reduce the total unserved electric energy by half of the then\nprevailing level of about 9 percent of total energy demand. Potential savings through improved\ncoordination in operations and commercialization were estimated at $5 billion to $10 billion by\nthe year 2001. The study further estimated that the unserved energy demand could be reduced\nby an additional 30 percent, and fuel costs could also be reduced, if interregional transmission\nfacilities  were  developed  for  national  power  trading.  The  combined  savings  were  found  to  be\nequivalent to about 10 percent of the total capital investment required in the power sector over\nthis  period.  Clearly,  Powergrid  has  a  major  role  to  play  in  improving  the  efficiency  and\nproductivity of India\u2019s power sector.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n34.\nThe power sector has received a major portion of India's external assistance. Of ADB\u2019s\ntotal  Government-guaranteed  lending  to  India  amounting  to  $7.718  billion  as  of  end  1999,  six\nloans  for  $1.265  billion  (16 percent)  have  been  approved  for  the  power  sector.  The  first  four\nprojects  were  for  power  generation;  the  two  most  recent  have  been  sector  loans  to  support\nimprovements  in  the  efficiency  of  SEBs  and  development  of  the  national  transmission  grid.  In\naddition,  the  ADB's  private  sector  group  (PSG)  has  approved  three  loans  and  investments\ntotaling  $79.8  million  for  one  captive  transmission  and  two  generation  projects.  10  Power\nsubprojects  have  also  been  considered  for  financing  under  the  ADB's  private  sector\ninfrastructure facility  11 and the Infrastructure Development Finance Company.12 ADB also has\n\n                                                \n10 Loan 7058/1036-IND: CESC Limited, for $17.8 million approved on 4 October 1990; Loan 7082/1142-IND: CESC\nLimited II, for $32.0 million approved on 13 December 1991; and Loan 7130/1499-IND: Balagarh Power Company\nLimited for $15 million in equity  and a  loan of $25 million, approved on 5 December 1996.\n\n11 Loan  1480-IND:  Private Sector Facility: Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Ltd.;  1481-IND:\nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Facility: Industrial Finance Corp. of India Ltd.; 1482-IND: Private Sector Infrastructure\nFacility: SCICI Ltd. approved on 7 November 1996 for a total of $300 million.\n\n12 Investment  7138-IND: Infrastructure Development Finance Company,  for  $30 million  equity  investment  approved\non 14 October 1997. The loan amount was subsequently reduced to $15.463 million due to greater than expected\nsubscription from the investors.\n\n\f9\n\napproved $11.834 million for 16 TAs mainly advisory, at both the national and state levels. The\nTAs  have  focused  on  environmental  and  pollution  control  issues  related  to  power  generation,\nbulk  transmission  tariffs,  improving  least-cost  system  planning,  tariff  studies  at  the  retail  level,\nimprovement  of  technical  and  commercial  operations,  power  sector  restructuring,  and\nestablishment  of  an  independent  regulatory  authority.  Previous  ADB  assistance  to  the  power\nsector in India is listed in Appendix 3.\n\n35.\nThe  major  funding  source  to  the  sector  is  the  World  Bank  group.  NTPC,  the  World\nBank's  largest  single  client  worldwide,  has  been  a  major  beneficiary  of  this  assistance.  The\nWorld Bank has supported power generation, transmission, and distribution projects, including\nassistance  directed  to  SEBs.  ADB  coordinates  with  the  World  Bank  on  the  geographical\ndemarcation of state-level operations, as well as to ensure overall complementarity of actions at\nboth the central and state levels. ADB and the World Bank have concurrent ongoing operations\nfor  different  projects  with  three  organizations:  PFC,  Powergrid,  and  NTPC.  Other  major\nagencies  funding  the  sector  are  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC),\nKreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (for  the  Government  of  Germany),  DFID,  CIDA,  and  USAID.\nAlthough the combined assistance of all aid agencies constitutes only about 8-10 percent of the\ntotal investments in the sector, several key policy initiatives have been catalyzed as a result of\nthis assistance. Major external assistance provided to Powergrid by other aid agencies is also\nlisted in Appendix 3.\n\n36.\nAbout $5 billion of investment will be necessary to transmit output power with adequate\nreliability and quality from the proposed large-scale additional generating capacity programmed\nduring  the  next  five  years  (Appendix  2).  Powergrid  has  segregated  and  prioritized  the  total\ninvestments  and  has  posed  subprojects  for  assistance  to  the  World  Bank,  ADB,  and  some\nbilateral aid agencies.\n\n37.\nThe World Bank has the same general direction and agenda as ADB in the sector and is\nprocessing a similar loan to Powergrid based on its \u201ctime slice\u201d project concept. The World Bank\nis  also  supporting  power  sector  reforms  in  the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Haryana,  Orissa,\nRajasthan  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  In  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Uttar  Pradesh,  power  sector  reform  is\nviewed as part of overall reform of the state finances as is being attempted by ADB in Gujarat\nand Madhya Pradesh.\n\nJBIC  is  supporting  the  expansion  of  public  sector  generation,  transmission  and\n\n38.\ndistribution including rural electrification. It has no geographic preferences.\n\n39.\nDFID is financing studies for restructuring of the sector in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and\nOrissa.  It  has  no  plans  to  participate  in  the  financing  of  hardware  other  than  in  renewable\nenergy  systems.  It  has  offered  to  cooperate  with  ADB  in  funding  studies  for  power  sector\nrestructuring  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and  West  Bengal  states  and  to  assist  these  states  in  other\nareas also, preferably in the \"soft\" sectors.\n\n40.\nUSAID  has  extensively  supported  and  continues  to  support  policy  aspects  of  private\nsector participation. It has supported studies for state sector reforms through PFC, and through\nprovision  of  grant  assistance  for  energy  management,  conservation  and  training.  It  is  working\nwith ADB and PFC for studies in Assam, Punjab and West Bengal.\n\nCIDA  has  assisted  Kerala  in  conducting  extensive  studies  for  restructuring  its  power\n41.\nsector, and is working with ADB in conducting such studies in Madhya Pradesh,  and with the\n\n\f10\n\nWorld Bank in Andhra Pradesh. ADB is following up on CIDA's work in Kerala through its policy\ndialogue and preparations for a possible loan project.\n\n42.\nThe  broad  policy  content  of  the  Project  has  been  discussed  with  all  the  aid  agencies,\nwhich  have  supported  activities  associated  with  sector  reforms  at  the  central  and  state  levels.\nAll these agencies have expressed general support for the Project.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n1. \n\nOverall Bank Operations\n\n43.\nThe  operations  of  ADB  and  other  aid  agencies  in  the  power  sector  in  India  have\ngenerally been successful from a project point of view; i.e., the projects concerned have been\ncompleted, although with implementation delays, and performed to the desired technical levels.\nHowever,  except  for  the  ongoing  loan  to  Powergrid,  these  projects  were  not  designed  to\nchange  the  business  environment,  and  the  sector  performance  has  continued  to  deteriorate,\nalthough  the  operations  of  the  project  components,  taken  individually,  were    satisfactory.  This\nwas  primarily  on  account  of  the  (i) political  interference  in  tariff  setting;  (ii) rapid  growth  of  the\ndemand for electricity, making conventional investment strategies unworkable; (iii) government\nrules and regulations and control of the SEBs that inhibited speedy decision making; and (iv) the\nnoncommercial  setup  of  the  sector  that  did  not  generate  the  market  for  alternative  players  to\nstep in to bridge the gap between supply and demand.\n\n44.\nIn the past, ADB extended assistance to discrete power projects in various states as well\nas  to  the  central  power  sector  agencies.  Although  this  policy  enabled  ADB  to  support  many\nprojects, it spread ADB's resources too thinly, with the result that it could not achieve its desired\ngoal of policy reforms with its power sector borrowers. In most states, the power sector was the\nlargest recipient of state resources, in terms of both subsidies and in terms capital investments,\nand it was realized that macro management of the state's finances needed to be improved for\nthe successful turnaround of the power sector. Therefore, ADB is now assisting states for power\nsector reforms only in the context of a holistic change in their macroeconomic management.\n\n2. \n\nPolicy Achievements of the Ongoing Loan to Powergrid\n\n45.\nOn  the  physical  side,  the  objectives  of  the  ongoing  loan  are  to  strengthen  Powergrid\u2019s\ntransmission systems in order to reduce system losses and allow efficient utilization of existing\nand  planned  power  plants  by:  (i)  supporting  development  of  the  Northeastern  regional  power\ngrid;  (ii)  interconnecting  the  Southern  and  Eastern  regional  power  grids;  (iii)  constructing\ntransmission facilities for power evacuation from new and expanded power plants.\n\nOn  the  reforms  side,  the  ADB\u2019s  intervention  in  the  sector  through  Powergrid  has\n46.\nimproved  commercialization  and  overall  operating  efficiencies  in  the  sector.  A  covenant  on\nlimiting  accounts  receivable,  coupled  with  the  provision  for  suspension  of  investments  in\ndelinquent states, has pressured most states to maintain their outstanding dues with Powergrid\nwithin reasonable limits. A covenant on implementing an economic dispatch policy has resulted\nin the decision to establish the CERC and switch over to an \u201cavailability\u201d based tariff for power\nstations  owned  by  central  public  sector  units.  This  is  expected  to  enhance  efficiencies  in  the\nproduction and use of generation assets.\n\n47.\nThe implementation of the ongoing loan has been successful. Powergrid\u2019s management\nand  administration  capability  have  improved,  as  well  as  their  technical  capability  to  physically\n\n\f11\n\nimplement  projects.  The  entire  loan  has  been  committed,  and  about  63  percent  has  been\ndisbursed.  The  majority  of  the  contracts  have  been  awarded  on  or  ahead  of  schedule.  The\nshortfalls  in  disbursement  have  largely  been  due  to  the  depreciation  of  the  rupee  versus  the\ndollar  over  the  past  five  years.  The  Government  and  Powergrid  have  generally  met  the  loan\nconditions  and  covenants,  except  for  those  pertaining  to  penal  interest  rates  13  and  accounts\nreceivables. 14\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  in  India  is  to  support  efforts  to  achieve  higher  sustainable\n48.\neconomic growth to promote employment and reduce poverty. Its contribution to higher growth\nfocuses  on  improving  the  supply  side  efficiency  of  the  economy,  especially  by  reducing\nbottlenecks in key infrastructure sectors. Emphasis is on improving the policy, institutional, and\nregulatory  framework  so  as  to  enhance  the  efficiency  of  public  sector  operations  and  to\nencourage  private  investment.  Improving  resource  mobilization  to  finance  the  necessary\ninvestments is a key component of ADB\u2019s assistance, and includes support for the development\nof  financial  and  capital  markets  as  well  as  for  improving  internal  resource  mobilization  in  the\nsector  agencies  and  enhancing  their  creditworthiness.  High  priority  is  also  given  to  assisting\nprojects that contribute to environmental improvement.\n\nADB's  strategy  for  India  was  revised  in  1996  to  accommodate  an  urgent  need  for  a\n49.\nportion  of  its  assistance  to  be  provided  in  a  systematic  and  comprehensive  way  at  the  sub-\nnational or state level. This need reflects the facts that (i) a geographic focus, together with the\nongoing selective sector focus, enables ADB to maximize its developmental impact both in the\nstates concerned and, through the demonstrational impact of its operations, on other states as\nwell; (ii)  state-level economic reforms, which have been lagging behind initiatives taken by the\nGovernment, need support and incentives; and (iii) the states have considerable autonomy and\nhave major legislative, administrative, and fiscal responsibilities in many economic sectors. Key\nelements  of  the  subnational  assistance  include  (i)  reducing  the  states'  fiscal  deficits,\n(ii) reforming  and  restructuring  public  sector  enterprises,  and  (iii)  supporting  reforms  in  key\ninfrastructure  sectors  with  a  view  to  increasing  private  investment.  Gujarat  was  the  first  state\nchosen  for  this  type  of  holistic  support  and  the  first  loan  was  granted  by  ADB  in  December\n1996.15 Madhya Pradesh is the second and its loan was accorded in December 1999. 16\n\n50.\nReflecting  ADB\u2019s  overall  country  strategy  for  India  and  in  recognition  of  the  dualistic\nstructure  of  India's  power  sector,  ADB's  strategy  for  the  sector,  which  has  been  pursued  in\ncoordination  with  the  World  Bank,  intends  to  operate  at  two  levels.  At  the  central  level,\n\n                                                \n13 Powergrid\u2019s current tariff agreements with SEBs provide for a penal rate of 1.5 percent.  Although the penalty rate\nwas to be raised from 1.5 to 2.0 percent in accordance with the Loan condition, it is recognized that the use of a\nrebate system in the billing to encourage prompt payments would be better to improve collections. Until 1994, a flat\n1.0 percent rebate was provided for prompt payment of bills. Since then Powergrid has enhanced the rebate up to\n2.5 percent on a staged basis. This rebate scheme has been effective in expediting payments, except for chronic\ndefaulters. Therefore, the requirement to increase the penal rate has been  waived since this does not seem to be\nan effective instrument in increasing payments and incentives seem to be working better.\n\n14  Accounts  receivable  have  generally  exceeded  the  covenanted  level  of  2.0  months  of  billing  on  account  of\ndelinquency by a few large SEBs. However, the Government and Powergrid have taken actions to reduce them. As\non 31 May 2000, exclusive of the amount under central appropriation, Powergrid\u2019s receivables were equal to 5.6\nmonths  of  billing.  However,  in  the  western  and  southern  regions  where  most  of  the  approved  subprojects  are\nlocated, the outstanding receivables were equal to only 1.78 months and 1.08 months, respectively.\n\n15 Loan  1506-IND:  Gujarat  Public  Sector  Resource  Management  Program,  for  $250  million  approved  on\n\n16 Loan  1717-IND:  Madhya  Pradesh  Public  Resource  Management  Program,  for  $250  million  approved  on\n\n18 December 1996.\n\n14 December 1999.\n\n\f12\n\nassistance is provided to central power sector companies such as Powergrid 17 and PFC 18, with\na  view  to  supporting  their  commercialization  and  using  them  as  agents  to  leverage  reform  in\ntheir  client  SEBs.  Through  Powergrid,  ADB  also  seeks,  at  the  central  level,  to  implement\nnationwide  power  sector  reforms  through  establishment  of  model  cases  in  tariff  structures,\ncompetitive  pool  operations;  regulation  of  power  supply  to  delinquent  SEBs,  and  investments\nbased on commercial viability of projects. At the state level, by considering assistance only for\nstates  that  demonstrate  the  political  will  to  substantially  restructure  and  commercialize  their\npower sectors, and by assisting them to actualize the reforms, ADB is building up the reforms\nprocess from the grassroots. Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala states have been identified\nfor  ADB\u2019s  holistic  support.  Improvements  in  the  power  sector,  will  increase  the  fiscal  space  of\nthe  state  governments  and  increase  their  ability  to  allocate  more  resources  for  poverty\nalleviation.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n1. \n\nIntroduction of Availability Based Tariff\n\nAvailability-based  tariffs  19  are  necessary  for  competitive  merit  order  dispatch  of\n51.\ngenerated  power,  which  ensures  that  the  electricity  pool  makes  available  the  lowest-cost\ngeneration to its consumers. In India, this has not been possible on account of the plant-load-\nfactor-based tariff currently in force for generation stations. As part of policy dialogue under its\nongoing loan activity,  ADB requested the Government and Powergrid to examine the feasibility\nof  introducing  availability-based  tariff  for  at  least  central  sector  generation  in  every  electricity\nregion.  As  a  result  of  this  dialogue,  a  National  Task  Force  chaired  by  CEA,  was  appointed  to\nimplement  the  recommendation  of  the  ADB-financed  tariff  study.  In  its  eighth  meeting  on\n7 October  1997,  the  National  Task  Force  decided  on  a  time-bound  program  for  implementing\navailability-based tariff. Mock exercises to ensure that necessary metering and other matching\nfacilities  were  in  place,  were  carried  out  in  1997  and  1998.  On  4  January  2000,  CERC\nannounced its decision to implement availability-based tariff in a phased manner for all central\ngeneration. The switch to availability-based tariff was directed to be undertaken from April 2000\nfor the south electricity region and June 2000 for the east electricity region. However, NTPC has\nsought a judicial review of some of the aspects of CERC\u2019s decision, and the court has referred\nthe  same  to  CERC  for  its  consideration.  It  is  expected  that  availability-based  tariffs  will  be\nimplemented by 1 April 2001.\n\n2. \n\nFacilitating SEB Reforms\n\nThe  main  problem  in  the  sector  is  the  default  in  payments  by  delinquent  SEBs.  In  the\n52.\npast no attempt was made to distinguish between good and bad SEBs in terms of investment by\ncentral PSUs, and little attempt to commercially enforce the bulk supply contracts. ADB\u2019s policy\ndialogue requested power supply restrictions to defaulting SEBs under the ongoing loan and a\npolicy  of  not  investing  for  their  benefit.  Powergrid  agreed,  and  these  actions  have  halted  the\ndeterioration in the realization of accounts receivable from defaulting SEBs. In accordance with\nthe covenant of the ongoing loan, the Government released to Powergrid a general advisory on\n\n                                                \n17 Loan No. 1405-IND: Power Transmission (Sector) Project, for $275 million approved on 16 November 1995.\n18 Loan  No.  1161-IND: Power Efficiency (Sector) Project,  approved  on  26  March  1992  for  $250  million.  The  loan\n\naccount was closed on  18 December 1998.\n\n19 Availability based tariff means a tariff structure composed of a capacity charge and an energy charge. The capacity\ncharge is based on the availability of the generating unit concerned to produce power should it be called upon to do\nso, irrespective of its actual usage. This enables the dispatcher to effectively use all the generators in the system in\na  competitive  manner.  Plant-Load-Factor  based  tariff  is  a  payment  based  on  the  actual  usage  of  the  plant,  and\nprovides an incentive for the generator to maximize generation, irrespective of whether it is required or not.\n\n\f13\n\npower supply restriction to defaulting SEBs in March 1996 for the Andhra Pradesh SEB and in\nMay  1996  for  the  SEBs  of  Uttar  Pradesh  and  West  Bengal.  In  May  1996,  as  a  follow-up\nmeasure,  Powergrid  and  NTPC  exercised  partial  power  supply  restriction  on  Uttar  Pradesh.\nThese measures have helped to improve commercial discipline in the SEBs.\n\nAs of June 2000, the major defaulters among SEBs  are Bihar SEB (Rs1,072.98 million\n53.\nor 8.84 months of sales), and the Delhi Vidyut Board (Rs738.75 million or 7.35 months of sales).\nUPPCL which was one of the major defaulters recently agreed to increase the amount in letter\nof credit from Rs80 million to Rs120 million and has liquidated all outstanding dues as on March\n1999, both principal and a large portion of the surcharge, in the form of bonds in June 2000. To\nencourage large defaulting states to reduce their outstanding dues, ADB\u2019s subproject condition,\ncovenanted  under  the  ongoing  loan,  that  Powergrid  will  not  seek  to  invest  in  assets  that  will\nbenefit  states  that  have  outstanding  dues  of  more  than  two  months  of  sales  to  them,  will  be\nmaintained. The overall position of outstanding accounts in the southern and western regions,\nwhere  most  of  the  Project\u2019s  subprojects  are  located,  is  satisfactory  at  -0.39  (credit)  and\n0.36 months of billing, respectively.\n\n3. \n\nFinancial Strengthening of the Transmission Subsector\n\n54.\nIn accordance with the covenant of the ongoing loan, the Government, on 16 December\n1997,  issued  a  notification  to  set  Powergrid\u2019s  transmission  tariff  at  a  level  that  will  enable\nPowergrid  to  recover  full  cost  of  its  services  and  earn  a  16  percent  return  on  its  equity\ninvestments.  The  notification  is  retroactive  from  1  April  1997  and  is  provided  for  in  the  loan\nagreements entered into between Powergrid and the SEBs. Powergrid has revised its contracts\nwith  each  SEB  to  reflect  this  change.  This  measure  further  enhances  Powergrid\u2019s  financial\nstrength to be able to invest and expand on its own.\n\n4. \n\nCommercialization of Powergrid\n\n55.\nSince the start commencement of commercial operations in 1991, Powergrid has\ngrown rapidly to become one of the largest power transmission companies in the world. Apart\nfrom physical expansion, it has registered healthy growth rates in sales revenue and profits. In\nthis growth phase, Powergrid has been supported by multilateral and bilateral aid agencies with\ntheir  funds  guaranteed  by  the  Government.  The  past  success  of  Powergrid  has  motivated  the\nGovernment  to  encourage  Powergrid  to  further  commercialize  all  aspects  of  its  functioning,\nalbeit in a phased manner. This objective of the Government is fully recognized and supported\nby Powergrid, and is also in line with ADB\u2019s philosophy of allowing competent beneficiaries to\n\u201cgraduate\u201d  from  its  lending  programs.  In  line  with  this  objective,  the  following  policy  dialogue\nwas undertaken in processing the Project.\n\na. \n\nEnhancement of Autonomy\n\n56.\nIn  August  1998,  as  a  measure  of  distancing  the  Government  from  Powergrid  and\nstrengthening  the  capability  of  its  board  of  directors,  the  board  was  reconstituted  to  comprise\nfive  full-time  board  members  from  Powergrid\u2019s  management  (including  its  chairman  and\nmanaging director); two members from the Government, and three non-government members.\nThe  outsiders  are  eminent  personalities  from  the  private  sector  and  at  present  are  (i)  the\nChairman  and  managing  director  of  the  Bombay  Suburban  Electric  Supply  Company,  the\nlargest  private  sector  distribution  company  in  India;  (ii)  the  managing  director  of  the\nInfrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited, a private sector fund; and (iii) a professor\n\n\f14\n\nof the Indian Institute of Management at Ahmedabad, the top school for management education\nin India.\n\n57.\nIn  addition  to  the  restructuring  of  Powergrid\u2019s  board  of  directors,  the  Government  also\nenhanced  the  autonomy  of  Powergrid  by  giving  it  the  power  to  approve  projects  costing  less\nthan  Rs3,000 million ($68.8 million), subject to other statutory clearances and approvals. This\nmeasure  has  considerably  enhanced  Powergrid\u2019s  autonomy  and  flexibility  to  respond  to\nbusiness opportunities.\n\nb. \n\nCommercial Borrowings from International Financial Markets\n\n58.\nFor  its  long-term  capital  needs,  Powergrid  needs  to  tap  international  financial  markets.\nTherefore, as part of the Project\u2019s financing arrangements, it is proposed to mobilize commercial\ncofinancing of  $120 million (30 percent of total foreign currency requirements of the Project) by\nway of an international syndicated loan, with credit enhancement by ADB through the use of its\npartial credit guarantee facility. The Government has agreed to counterguarantee ADB\u2019s partial\ncredit guarantee.  This will be the first foreign currency loan with a final maturity of 15 years for\nPowergrid.\n\n59.\nTo progressively move away from Government-guaranteed financing and to leverage its\nown  considerable  self-generated  resources  through  market  borrowings,  Powergrid,  as  part  of\nthe  policy  dialogue  for  the  Project,  has  adopted  a  policy  and  financial  planning  of  not  seeking\nGovernment-guaranteed funds for projects costing less than Rs1,000 million each after FY2002.\nThis policy has been covenanted under the loan.\n\nc. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation in the Transmission Subsector\n\n60.\nIntensive  discussions  were  held  with  Powergrid  and  the  Government  on  the  sector\u2019s\npolicy  to  introduce  private  sector  participation  in  the  transmission  subsector.  The  need  to\nestablish fair, transparent, and competitive practices in establishing private sector transmission\nprojects  was  emphasized.  Introduction  of  private  sector  participation  through  fair  and\ntransparent  competition  will  be  beneficial  for  the  entire  transmission  subsector  by  providing\nbenchmarks for construction costs and costs of finance. ADB provided TA20 to assist Powergrid\nin  competitively  soliciting  for  private  sector  implementation  of  the  Vizag-Vijayawada  400  kV\ntransmission  line.  When  implemented,  this  line  will  be  the  first  extra-high  voltage  line\nestablished by the private sector for a central or state power utility.\n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n61.\nThe Project furthers the ongoing power sector reforms at the central level to (i) improve\ngovernance, (ii) build long-term institutional capacity, (iii) improve efficiencies, and (iv) facilitate\nprivate sector participation.\n\n62.\nInvestment of about $5 billion will be necessary to transmit with adequate reliability and\nquality  output  power  from  the  additional  generating  capacity  programmed  during  the  next  five\nyears.  Substantial  investments  are  also  needed  during  the  next  five  years  for  system\nstrengthening.  The  Project  will  focus  on  subprojects  that  are  essential  for  entire  system\n                                                \n20 TA  3380\u2013IND:Private Sector Participation in Electricity Transmission,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  28 December\n\n1999.\n\n\f15\n\nperformance. Such subprojects will also facilitate private sector participation although indirectly,\nin  the  generation  and  distribution  subsectors  through  improvement  of  power  system  reliability\nand  performance.  The  loan  will  finance  part  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  of  a  group  of\ntransmission  subprojects  to  be  undertaken  during  a  five-year  time  slice  commencing  in  2000.\nThe  subprojects  are  accorded  high  priority  by  the  Government  and  Powergrid  and  are  an\nintegral part of Powergrid\u2019s transmission development plan.\n\n63.\nTo  leverage  sector  reform  at  the  state  level,  the  Project  is  designed  to  differentiate\nbetween states undertaking sector reform and those that are not, in selecting subprojects under\nthe  proposed  loan.  The  proposed  Project  will  provide  strong  transmission  networks  to  switch\npower  supply  from  delinquent  state  power  sector  entities  to  those  that  have  good  payment\nrecords,  and  also  accord  preference  in  investment  to  improve  transmission  service  to  these\nentities.\n\n64.\nThe sector loan modality is being adopted for this loan to provide flexibility in choosing\nsubprojects  that  meet  technical,  financial,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  criteria  agreed\nupon  by  Powergrid  and  ADB.  The  sector  loan  approach  will  also  provide  Powergrid  with\nsufficient  flexibility  to  optimally  utilize  the  commercial  cofinancing  raised  using  ADB\u2019s  partial\ncredit guarantee facility.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n65.\nThe  technical  objective  is  to  strengthen  Powergrid\u2019s  transmission  systems  to  improve\nsystem  reliability,  reduce  transmission  losses,  improve  system  quality,  and  allow  efficient\nutilization of existing and planned generation plants. The strategic objectives are to (i) support\nthe  restructuring  of  India\u2019s  power  sector;  (ii)  enable  private  sector  participation,  (iii) encourage\nthe adoption of appropriate pricing mechanisms for all bulk supply of electricity; and (iv) improve\nthe  commercial  basis  for  all  transmission  transactions,  thus  ensuring  Powergrid's  profitability,\nliquidity,  and  ability  to  mobilize  more  commercial  counterpart  funds.  The  Project  will  also  help\nPowergrid\u2019s  transition  from  relying  on  Government-guaranteed  programs  and  funds  to  funding\nthrough  market-based  programs,  thus  making  Powergrid  more  autonomous  and  commercially\noriented.\n\n66.\nThe Project has two components: Part A: upgrading and expanding 400 kV, 220 kV, and\n132  kV  transmission  systems  to  transfer  additional  power,  to  improve  system  reliability,  and\nenhance  the  efficient  utilization  of  power  plants;  and  Part  B:  installing  400  kV  and  220  kV\ntransmission systems to evacuate the power generated by central power utilities and IPPs.\n\n67.\n\nThe candidate subprojects are described briefly in Appendix 4.\n\nC. \n\nTechnical Justification and Criteria for Subproject Selection\n\n68.\nSubprojects were selected on the basis of (i) technical suitability; (ii) environmental and\nsocial  soundness  conforming  to  relevant  ADB  guidelines;  (iii)  financial  viability:  the  financial\ninternal rate  of  return  (FIRR)  being  greater  than  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital\n(WACC); (iv) economic viability: the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) being greater than\n12   percent;  and  (v)  satisfactory  payment  record  of  the  major  beneficiary  SEBs:  accounts\nreceivable being less than two months equivalent of sales. The justification of each subproject is\nsupported  by  load-flow  diagrams,  evaluation  of  alternatives,  detailed  design,  cost  estimates,\nfinancial  and  economic  analyses,  summary  initial  examination  of  environmental  and  social\n\n\f16\n\nissues,  and \nsubprojects under Powergrid\u2019s transmission development plan for support under this loan.\n\nimplementation  schedules.  Nine  subprojects  were  selected  as  candidate\n\n69.\nTo  date,  four  subprojects  have  been  preliminarily  approved  by  ADB  and  one  is  in  an\nadvanced  stage  of  approval.  Since  all  the  identified  subprojects  are  based  on  well-proven\ntechnology  and  are  generally  within  Powergrid\u2019s  implementation  capability,  there  are  no\nsignificant  technical  or  engineering  risks.  Through  the  investment  in  these  subprojects,\nPowergrid will improve its system to international standards of availability and reliability.\n\nIndia has idle generating capability, especially in the eastern and northeastern regions,\n70.\nbecause  of  inadequate  transmission  facilities.  The  excess  generating  capacity  in  the  eastern\nregion alone is about 1,800 MW. On the other hand the southern, western and northern regions\nare in short supply. Interconnecting areas with deficits and surpluses will provide a market to the\nareas  with  surplus  and  alleviate  the  shortages  in  the  deficit  regions.  This  will  decrease  the\noverall  cost  of  supply  to  all  regions.  Inadequate  transmission  facilities  have  also  led  to  local\nimbalances  in  the  demand-supply  situation  even  in  areas  with  sufficient  generation  capacity\ncausing low voltage and load shedding. In some cases, a breakdown at one point of the system\ncauses  a  cascade  of  system  outages  and  results  in  large-scale,  statewide,  or  regionwide\nblackouts.  Subprojects  in  part  A  will  address  such  problems  and  will  facilitate  the  supply  of\nadditional  power,  thereby  using  planned  and  existing  power  generation  capacity  optimally.\nSubprojects  in  part  B  will  provide  transmission  systems  for  new  generating  stations  under\ncentral sector agencies and IPPs.\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates\n\n71.\nThe total cost of the identified subprojects is $491.5 million equivalent (Rs25,828 million)\ncomprising foreign exchange costs of $394.2 million (80.2 percent) and local currency costs of\n$97.3  million  equivalent  (19.8  percent).  The  cost  estimates  are  expressed  in  2000  prices  and\ninclude  provisions  for  physical  and  price  contingencies,  currency  movements,  and  interest\nduring  construction  (IDC).  The  cost  estimates  are  summarized  in  Table  1  and  detailed  in\nAppendix  5.  However,  since  this  is  a  sector  loan,  Powergrid  retains  the  flexibility  to  add  or\ndelete,  subprojects to this list.\n\nItem\n\nBase Cost\n\n  Part A\n  Part B\n  Tax and Duties\n          Subtotal\nPhysical Contingency a\nPrice Contingency b\n  IDC\n          Total\n\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n117.3\n163.7\n0.0\n281.0\n28.1\n21.3\n63.8\n394.2\n\n21.5\n12.5\n35.9\n69.9\n7.0\n9.1\n11.3\n97.3\n\nTotal\n\n52.8\n262.2\n35.9\n350.9\n35.1\n30.4\n75.1\n491.5\n\na Physical contingency computed as 10 percent of base cost.\nb Price  contingency  computed  on  the  basis  of  6.5  percent  local  currency  and  2.4  percent  per\n\nannum on foreign exchange costs.\n\n\f17\n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan, Cofinancing Loan and Partial Credit Guarantee\n\n72.\nThe proposed ADB loan of $250 million will finance a major part of the foreign currency\ncosts, including the related front-end fee, commitment charges, and IDC. The loan will be drawn\nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and will have a repayment period of 20 years, including a\ngrace period of 5 years. The interest will be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based\nvariable lending rate for US dollar loans. Powergrid will be the Borrower, with a guarantee from\nthe Government, and will bear the foreign exchange risk.

The remaining\nforeign  currency  requirement,  amounting  to  25  percent  of  total  project  cost,  is  proposed  to  be\nraised through a cofinancing loan of $120 million sourced from offshore commercial lenders in\nthe syndicated bank loan market. The lead arranger bank has fully underwritten the loan. The\ncofinancing  loan  will  have  a  final  maturity  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  four  years.\nPowergrid will be the Borrower. The cofinancing loan will be supported by an ADB partial credit\nguarantee covering interest payments and principal re-payments due from years 8 through 15.\nThe  main  terms  and  conditions  of  the  cofinancing  loan  are  summarized  in  Appendix  6.  The\ncofinancing loan, the ADB's partial credit guarantee, and the Government's counter guarantee\nare  subject  to  the  final  terms  and  conditions  being  mutually  accepted  by  the  Government,\nPowergrid  and  ADB.  In  case  the  cofinancing  does  not  materialize  within  six  months  from  the\ndate of approval of the Loan, Powergrid shall raise necessary funds of upto $120 million, to the\nsatisfaction of ADB, to ensure timely completion of the Project.\n\n74.\nAn ADB guarantee was necessary to obtain the required long-term debt financing and to\nimprove  the  terms  of  such  financing.  At  present,  Indian  borrowers,  including  public  sector\nborrowers  such  as  Powergrid,  can  achieve  maximum  maturities  of  up  to  7  years  on  their  own\ncredit.  Longer-term  financing  is  generally  not  available.  However,  the  proposed  Project  (like\nother  capital-intensive  infrastructure  projects),  requires  extended  maturities  to  amortize  its\nexpenditures.  To  achieve  this,  the  ADB  guarantee  was  applied  to  years  8  through  15  of  the\ncofinancing loan, leaving the debt service falling due prior to that uncovered. The pricing of the\ncofinancing loan (expressed as a margin above LIBOR)21 is 80 basis points per annum in years\n1 through 7, reducing to 20 basis points per annum in years 8 through 15 (the period covered by\n\n                                                \n21 The  cofinancing  loan  is  structured  as  a  floating  rate  loan  priced  against  the  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate\n\n(LIBOR).\n\n\f18\n\nthe ADB guarantee).  This pricing is considered competitive and properly reflective of the credit\nenhancement provided by the ADB guarantee. ADB will charge a guarantee fee of 0.40% p.a.\non  present  values  of  the  guarantee  obligations  and  a  front-end  fee  of  0.39%  of  the  nominal\nguaranteed amount in accordance with the ADB\u2019s guarantee policy (Estimated guarantee fees\nschedule is in Appendix 6).\n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n75.\nThe subprojects will be implemented over five years from November 2000 to September\n2005.  The  implementation  schedule  of  the  five  candidate  subprojects  that  have  secured\npreliminary  approval,  or  are  in  an  advanced  stage  of  securing  such  approval,  is  given  in\nAppendix 7. Procurement activities for the first subprojects have commenced.\n\n76.\nPowergrid will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB, within 30 days after the end of\neach  quarter.  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  of  the  subprojects  and  meet  with  the\nconcerned  staff  of  Powergrid  to  discuss  progress.  ADB  will  also  monitor  Powergrid\u2019s  overall\ntechnical  and  financial  performance.  In  view  of  the  long  lead  time  needed  to  implement  major\ntransmission  projects,  Powergrid  will  submit  for  ADB\u2019s  approval  by  June  2002  the  appraisal\nreports for the remaining subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan.\n\n2. \n\nProcurement of Equipment and Materials\n\n77.\nEquipment and materials will be procured through international competitive bidding (ICB)\nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The agreed upon contract package list\nfor the first five subprojects, which may attract international bidders, is indicated in Appendix 8.\nContract  packages  and  bid  specifications  have  been  prepared  in  such  a  way  as  to  ensure\nmaximum  competition  under  ICB.  Similar  contractual  structures  and  specifications  will  be\napplied to other subprojects. Powergrid will provide a procurement notice for inclusion in ADB\nBusiness Opportunities  at  least  42  days  before  issuing  bidding  documents  for  any  contract\nfinanced by ADB. Local manufacturers and contractors may participate in the bidding and avail\nof  a  15  percent  domestic  preference  margin.  If  procurement  is  done  under  international\nshopping, ADB\u2019s standard procedures and threshold limits will be followed. ADB\u2019s funds will not\nbe utilized to fund procurement under local competitive bidding procedures.\n\nTo \n\ntimely \n\nfacilitate \n\nimplementation  of \n\n78.\nthe  Project,  ADB  has  allowed  advance\nprocurement  action  for  eligible  subprojects.  As  of  August  2000,  four  subprojects  have  been\npreliminarily approved and one other is in an advanced stage of approval. However, approval of\nadvance procurement action does not in any way commit ADB to finance the proposed Project.\nADB will not consider retroactive financing for expenditures incurred prior to loan effectiveness.\n\n79.\nFor contracts to be awarded based on ICB procurement procedures, Powergrid shall be\nexempted  from  ADB\u2019s  prior  review  of  its  bid  documents  provided  that  such  documents  are\nforwarded  at  the  time  of  their  release  to  ADB  for  post-facto  approval,  and  Powergrid  issues\namendments to such documents based on comments made by ADB, if any, during the bidding\nperiod. Further, Powergrid may also award contracts of value less than $3.0 million in each case\nwithout seeking approval of ADB, provided the lowest priced bidder is also the lowest evaluated\nbidder, and further provided that (i) all cases involving unusual issues shall be submitted to ADB\nfor prior approval, and (ii) all cases shall be subject to post-facto approval of ADB which shall\nretain  the  right  to  disallow  utilization  of  loan  proceeds  in  case  it  is  unable  to  agree  with\nPowergrid on either the bid documents or the bid evaluation report.\n\n\f19\n\n3. \n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\n80.\nADB\u2019s direct payment, commitment letter, or reimbursement procedures will be applied\nfor  turnkey  contracts,  for  supply,  delivery,  and  installation  of  goods,  and  for  procurement  of\ngoods, materials, equipment, and services.\n\n4. \n\nReports,  Accounts,  and Audits\n\n81.\nPowergrid  will  prepare  separate  progress  reports  for  their  respective  components  and\nsubmit  them  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis.  The  reports  will  provide  a  narrative  description  of\nprogress  made  during  the  period,  changes  to  the  implementation  schedule,  problems  or\ndifficulties  encountered,  and  the  work  to  be  carried  out  in  the  upcoming  period.  The  progress\nreports  will  also  include  a  summary  financial  account  for  the  Project.  It  will  consist  of  project\nexpenditures during the period, year to date, and total expenditure to date. ADB will review the\nimplementation and operation of the Project based on these reports and meet with the executing\nagencies  and  the  Government  semiannually  to  discuss  project  progress.  Project  completion\nreports will be submitted to ADB within six months of project completion.\n\n82.\nPowergrid  will  have  its  annual  financial  statements  -  income  statement,  balance  sheet,\nand sources and application of funds statement-audited by an auditing firm acceptable to ADB.\nCertified audited accounts and financial statements of Powergrid will be submitted to ADB within\nsix months of the close of the financial year. Powergrid will also submit audited accounts for the\nProject each year, within six months of the close of each financial year.\n\nG. \n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n1. \n\nOrganization\n\nPowergrid  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  Powergrid  is  managed  by  a\n83.\nboard  of  directors  consisting  of  a  full-time  chairman/managing  director,  four  full-time  directors,\nthree  part-time  directors  from  the  private  sector,  and  two  directors  representing  the\nGovernment. Powergrid\u2019s board has full powers for day-to-day operation and administration and\nlimited  powers  for  capital  investment.  Similar  to  other  Government-owned  enterprises,\nPowergrid  annually  signs  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with  the  Government  which  sets\noperational and financial performance targets and the Government\u2019s corresponding obligations.\n\n84.\nPowergrid\u2019s organizational structure (Appendix 9) consists of (i) a corporate center at the\nhead office in New Delhi that is responsible for overall corporate planning, system planning and\nengineering, management of transmission system operations and projects, finance, commercial\nmatters,  and  personnel;  and  (ii)  regional  headquarters,  each  of  which  manages  several  group\nheadquarters. Powergrid\u2019s projects department at the corporate headquarters in New Delhi will\nundertake planning, design, procurement, and will also liase with ADB. Regional offices will be\nresponsible for construction supervision, commissioning, maintenance, and operation.\n\n85.\nPowergrid has strong capability in project implementation and designs and manages its\nprojects  on  its  own  with  limited  use  of  external  consultants.  Powergrid  usually  retains  the\nresponsibility for implementing and coordinating projects; contractors are used for erection work.\nSite supervisors report to the executive directors of the regions. The regional executive directors\nchair  monthly  review  meetings  to  review  progress  and  address  implementation  issues.  Site\nmanagers  authorize  payments  to  suppliers  and  contractors.  The  management  of  Powergrid\nreceives  monthly  progress  reports  and  reviews  each  subproject  in  quarterly  project  review\n\n\f20\n\ncommittee  meetings.  Powergrid  has  introduced  computerized  project  management  systems  to\nassist  with  planning  and  monitoring  of  project  implementation  and  to  facilitate  comprehensive\nand  timely  progress  reporting.  Powergrid\u2019s  organization  structure  and  management  systems\nhave been found adequate for its operations.\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Performance\n\n86.\nPowergrid has been operating profitably since its first full year of commercial operations,\nwhich  ended  on  31  March  1994.  A  summary  of  past  financial  performance  indicators  is  in\nTable 3. Historical financial statements, financial projections, and the critical assumptions used\nin developing the financial projections are provided in Appendix 10.\n\n                Table 3: Summary of Past Financial Performance of Powergrid\n(Rs million)\n\nFY1994 FY1995 FY1996 FY1997 FY1998 FY1999\n\n6,487\n1,879\n\n8,099\n2,076\n\n9,836 10,582 14,346 17,703\n4,444\n2,759\n\n3,058\n\n3,372\n\nFY2000\n(provisional)\n21,239\n6,009\n\nItem\n\nTotal Revenue\nNet Profit\n\nTotal Assets\n     Accounts Receivable\nTo Be Repaid Through Central\n Appropriation\nLong-Term Debts\n\n65,221 73,796 87,278 99,698 113,792 126,095\n7,342 10,127\n2,742\n3,157\n\n1,191\n0\n\n2,982\n0\n\n4,207\n3,460\n\n4,075\n0\n\n141,238\n12,364\n2,385\n\n39,072 31,189 38,996 47,717 55,905 65,311\n\n73,144\n\nNet Profit Margin (%)\nROR on Net Fixed Assets (%)\nSFR 3-Year Average (%)\nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (times)\nDebt Equity Ratio\nAccounts Receivable (# months sales)\n# Months Sales Excluding Accounts to\nbe Repaid Through Central\nAppropriation\n\n29.0\n4.8\n27.5\n1.5\n44:56\n2.2\n2.2\n\n25.6\n4.7\n15.7\n2.2\n47:53\n5.1\n4.4\n\n28.1\n6.1\n27.2\n2.4\n50:50\n5.8\n5\n\n28.9\n7.1\n22.8\n1.9\n53:47\n5.5\n0.8\n\n23.5\n5.2\n12.8\n1.4\n55:45\n7.2\n3.5\n\n25.1\n6.8\n13.1\n1.1\n57:43\n7.8\n5.0\n\n28.3\n7.8\n22.9\n1.9\n55:45\n8.4a\n5.6\n\nROR = rate of return;  SFR = Special Funds resources.\na    This  does  not  take  into  account  the  liquidation  of  dues  of  Rs720  million  by  Uttar  Pradesh  Power\n\nCorporation in June 2000.\n\n87.\nPowergrid derives its revenues from its transmission services. The current tariff structure\nunder which Powergrid operates was established on 16 December 1997, retroactive to 1 April\n1997.  Under  the  tariff  protocol,  Powergrid  is  granted    full  recovery  of  depreciation,  interest  on\nforeign  and  domestic  borrowings,  foreign  exchange  losses,  and  taxes  on  profits  generated\nthrough  transmission  activity.  In  addition,  the  tariff  includes  a  provision  for  interest  on  working\ncapital,  an  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  charge  (based  on  1.5  percent  of  the  original\ncapital  cost  of  productive  fixed  assets),  a  12  percent  ROE  up  to  31  March  1997,  and  a\n16 percent  ROE  computed  on  paid-up  capital  applicable  to  transmission  assets  and  any  new\ninvestment in transmission projects from internal resources, on or after 1 April 1997. Powergrid\nshould remain profitable, provided its costs remain within the perimeters established by the tariff\nprotocol  (i.e.  accounts  receivable  and  inventory  levels  are  maintained  at  suitable  levels  and\nO&M costs stay within 1.5 percent of capital investment).\n\n\f21\n\n88. While its overall financial performance is sound, Powergrid has some difficulty collecting\naccounts receivable. The collection problems are not systemic, but relate to a limited number of\nfinancially distressed SEBs that do not generate sufficient cash flow to honor their obligations to\nPowergrid.  Recognizing  the  problem,  the Government  approved  in  1997,  the  provision  of\nRs3,460 million  over  a  10-year  period  from  the  central  budget.  Powergrid  received  the  first\ninstallment of Rs303 million during FY1998; the balance is to be paid out on a variable basis,\nwith a final installment of Rs226 million scheduled for FY2007. Powergrid is taking further steps\nto improve its collection performance. Letters of credit are now mandatory for all client SEBs to\nsupport the timely payment of monthly billings. Further, in FY2001, a substantial portion of the\noutstandings  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Uttar  Pradesh  have  been  liquidated\nthrough  the  issue  of  bonds  guaranteed  by  the  respective  state  governments.  To  facilitate\ncompliance by Powergrid of its accounts receivable covenants under the ongoing loan and the\nproposed  loan,  modifications  to  the  same  have  been  incorporated  in  the  respective  loan\nagreements. This will ensure that investments flow to financially responsible utilities.\n\n89.\nPowergrid\u2019s  debt  structure  is  summarized  in  Table  4.  Approximately  39  percent  of\nPowergrid\u2019s  outstanding  long-term  debt  as  of  31  March  2000  has  been  raised  from  foreign\nsources  and  is  denominated  in  a  variety  of  currencies  including  Canadian  dollars,  French\nfrancs,  Japanese  yen,  Swiss  francs,  and  US  dollars.    While  interest  rates  and  maturities  on\nforeign  debt  have  been  reasonable,  domestic  debt,  which  accounts  for  61  percent  of\nPowergrid\u2019s debt burden, tends to have significantly higher interest rates and shorter maturities.\nBond  issues,  which  account  for  slightly  more  than  25  percent  of  total  borrowings,  have  been\nstructured with a single repayment mechanism, with 100 percent of the principal being paid in\nthe  year  of  maturity.  Powergrid  has  not  maintained  a  sinking  fund  for  principal  repayments.\nThus,  its  cash  flows  and  self-financing  ratios  fluctuate  significantly  between  years.  The\nproposed loan, together with use of ADB\u2019s partial risk guarantee, will help to reduce Powergrid\u2019s\noverall borrowing costs and will facilitate improved cash flow management.\n\nTable 4: Powergrid's Debt Structure as of 31 March 2000\n\nCurrency Modality\n\nSource\n\nDomestic\n\nLoan Domestic Financial Institutions\nLoan Government of India\nBond Various Issues to Domestic Investors\n\nForeign\n\nSubtotal\n\nLoan Multilateral Sources\nLoan\nLoan Commercial Sources\n\nBilateral Sources\n\nSubtotal\n                  Total\n\nBalance\n(Rs million)\n\nInterest\n(%)\n\nTerms (years)\n\nGrace Maturity\n\n14,635     13-18 Various\n18,580          15\n11,483       9-17\n44,698\n\n5\n  bullet\n\n16,677         7-9\n\n5\n\n1,150      3-9.5 Various\n10,619 1.4-6.35 Various\n28,446\n73,144\n\n5 - 7\n   15\n5 - 7\n\n   15\n5-10\n5-10\n\n90.\nThe  financial  projections  for  Powergrid,  based  on  the  tariff  protocol  discussed  in\npara. 87,  indicate  strong  financial  performance  over  the  term  of  the  loan.  Table  5 summarizes\nthe  projected  financial  performance.  Cash  flows  are  sufficient  to  meet  all  operating  costs  and\ndebt and equity service requirements. The minimum debt-service coverage ratio from FY2001 is\nexpected to be 1.48 times; the highest debt/equity ratio is expected to be 64:36 in FY2004.  The\nself-financing ratio is expected to be no less than 20 percent.\n\n\fTable 5: Summary of Projected Financial Performance of Powergrid\n\n22\n\n(Rs million)\n\nFY\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n25,637\n6,119\n\n29,888\n7,925\n\n33,773\n9,287\n\n38,246\n10,966\n\n46,896\n12,740\n\n54,428\n15,802\n\n157,682\n11,610\n\n193,608\n9,893\n\n243,371\n10,265\n\n271,921 291,894\n11,922\n\n10,734\n\n309,072\n12,936\n\n1,549\n\n1,273\n\n997\n\n721\n\n467\n\n226\n\n105,082\n73,455\n\n122,277\n103,784\n\n138,440\n139,277\n\n158,334 181,255\n153,337 161,504\n\n214,582\n165,820\n\n23.9\n6.4\n32.3\n\n26.5\n7.0\n31.5\n\n1.48\n53.47\n\n1.72\n59.41\n\n5.4\n\n4.7\n\n4.0\n\n3.5\n\n27.5\n7.1\n47.6\n\n2.67\n63.37\n\n3.6\n\n3.3\n\n28.7\n7.4\n66.4\n\n27.1\n7.5\n59.0\n\n29.0\n7.6\n65.3\n\n2.64\n64.36\n\n2.06\n63.37\n\n1.68\n61.39\n\n3.4\n\n3.1\n\n3.1\n\n2.9\n\n2.9\n\n2.8\n\nItem\n\nTotal Revenue\nNet Profit\n\nTotal  Assets\n     Accounts Receivable\n     to be repaid through\n         Central Appropriation\n     Net Fixed Assets\n        (Productive)\nLong-Term Debts\n\nNet Profit Margin (%)\nROR on Average Net Fixed Assets (%)\nSFR 3-Year Average (%)\nDebt-Service Coverage Ratio\n   (times)\nDebt Equity Ratio\nAccounts Receivable\n   (# months sales)\n   # Months Sales excluding\n          Central Appropriation\n\nROR = rate of return; SFR = self financing ratio.\n\nH. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\n91.\nThe Project has been classified as Category B under ADB\u2019s environmental classification\nof  projects,  and  requires  that  a  sample  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  be\ncirculated  to  the  Board.  Powergrid  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and\nSIEE of the sample subproject for the 400 kV double-circuit transmission line extending about\n400  km  from  Raipur  to  Rourkela,  which  is  considered  as  the  most  environmentally  sensitive\ncandidate subproject.  This SIEE was circulated to the Board on 29 July 1998.\n\n92.\nOf the total 400 km length of the Raipur-Rourkela transmission line, only 14.25 km will\npass  through  forested  areas  (with  a  density  of  0.4)  in  Orissa  State.  The  affected  forest  is\nrevenue  forest  (14.1  km  affecting  67.5  hectares  [ha])  and  plantation  forest  (0.15  km  affecting\n0.7 ha) of minor ecological importance. There are no recorded endangered, threatened, or rare\nspecies of fauna or flora in the affected forest. Traversing this forest could not be avoided due to\nterrain and the presence of the Hirakud reservoir. A 3-meter-wide strip of land will be retained\nas  maintenance  right-of-way.  Powergrid  will  adhere  to  the  Government\u2019s  procedure  for\ncompensation  for  loss  of  trees  and  forested  areas;  hence  there  will  be  a  provision  for\ncompensatory  forestry.  Good  environmental  practices  will  be  followed  to  ensure  minimal\ndisturbance. To further minimize impact, low-canopy seed trees and shrubs will be kept intact as\n\n\f23\n\nlong  as  they  do  not  interfere  with  tower  erection  and  line  installation.  The  IEE  concluded  that\noverall environmental impacts were minor or insignificant because potential impacts associated\nwith transmission lines have been minimized through careful route selection. The project design\n(i) minimizes  the  need  for  resettlement;  (ii)  does  not  affect  monuments  of  cultural  or  historical\nimportance;  (iii)  does  not  create  a  threat  to  the  survival  of  any  community,  including  tribal\ncommunities;  (iv)  does  not  affect  public  places  such  as playgrounds  or  schools;  (v)  does  not\npass through any sanctuary, national park, or other protected areas; (vi) minimizes damage to\nexisting  forest  resources;  and  (vii)  provides  for  alignments  of  10-15  km  from  major  towns  to\naccount for future urban expansion.\n\n93.\nIn  1998,  Powergrid  adopted  a  comprehensive  company  policy  on  environmental  and\nsocial protection titled Environmental and Social Policy and Procedures (ESPP). ADB reviewed\nthe  ESPP  and  found  it  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy on Involuntary Settlement.  During  fact-\nfinding and appraisal, similar subprojects executed by Powergrid in the past were examined and\nfound to be acceptable from the viewpoint of environmental and social impact, and mitigation,\nparticularly  because  of  the  special  care  taken  by  Powergrid  and  the  government  agencies  in\ndelineating  the  alignment  to  avoid  dense  old  growth  forest  and  agricultural  land,  minimize\nacquisition of rights-of-way, and eschew obtaining borrowed material from agricultural land and\nforests. The field practices of Powergrid are consistent with sound environmental management.\n\n ADB examined the SIEE reports of the core subprojects under the proposed loan and\n94.\nfound  the  environmental  impacts  insignificant  and  the  proposed  environmental  management\nmeasures adequate. Where necessary, required mitigation measures have been incorporated.\nThe details are in Appendix 11. A review of the proposed subprojects, suggests that a full-scale\nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) may not be necessary and an IEE may be adequate for\nidentifying  potential  impacts  and  designing  environmental  management  measures.  However,\nany subproject confirmed by ADB as environmentally sensitive will require the preparation of an\nEIA or summary EIA (SEIA) which will be submitted to ADB.\n\n2. \n\nSocial Impacts\n\nSince  this is a transmission project, the social impacts\u2014land acquisition and involuntary\n95.\nresettlement\u2014are  minimal,  arising  only \nfor  subprojects  entailing  construction  of  new\nsubstations.  Compensation  will  be  required  for  crop  damage  caused  by  tower  construction.\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  be  minimal  since  Powergrid\u2019s  policy  is  to  construct\nsubstations and select route alignments away from built-up areas, utilizing as much as possible\ngovernment-owned  land.  To  date,  Powergrid  projects  have  not  entailed  large-scale  land\nacquisition  and  resettlement.  Of  the  55  subprojects  entailing  land  acquisition  in  the  past,  only\none  homestead  was  acquired  and  only  a  small  number  of  families  were  affected  by  land\nacquisition.\n\n96.\nAlthough  Powergrid  projects  have  involved  minimal  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,\nPowergrid has a comprehensive ESPP to address the environmental and social impacts of their\nprojects.  Within  its  organizational  structure,  Powergrid  has  also  established  an  environmental\nand social management department within its organizational structure to implement the ESPP.\n\n97.\nThis is a sector project, and Powergrid has not yet confirmed or approved all subprojects\nat this stage. Details of the precise amount of land to be acquired and the number of affected\nhouseholds are not yet available for all candidate subprojects. For each preliminarily approved\nsubproject  requiring  significant  resettlements,  Powergrid  has  prepared  an  initial  social\n\n\f24\n\nassessment (ISA) detailing the estimates of land acquisition, listing of the affected households,\nand identifying any vulnerable groups such as tribal communities. Of the five core subprojects,\ntwo  will  not  require  land  acquisition  and  two,  only  small  amounts.  The  ISAs  were  reviewed\nduring  project  appraisal  and  the  subprojects  confirmed  to  present  minimal  social  impacts.  A\nsample ISA for the Kolhapur- Ponda transmission line is summarized in Appendix 12.\n\n98.\nFor  subprojects  identified  following  loan  approval,  an  ISA  must  be  included  in  the\nsubproject  appraisal  report.  For  subprojects  that  entail  involuntary  resettlement  affecting  40  or\nmore  families,  a  detailed  social  impact  assessment,  including  a  resettlement  action  plan  with\ntime-bound actions and budgets, must be submitted to ADB for review prior to the of physical\nimplementation of the subproject. Powergrid will implement and monitor the resettlement action\nplan in a manner consistent with Powergrid\u2019s ESPP and ADB\u2019s requirements. ADB will monitor\nthe resettlement process through its regular review missions.\n\n3. \n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n99.\nBenefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  Project  will  be  done  by  Powergrid  and  will  be\nreviewed by ADB missions as part of the supervision work. This will include verification of (i) the\nfinancial status of the Project\u2019s beneficiary regions and states, and (ii) improvements in service\nfor the existing consumers in the beneficiary regions. Institutional parameters such as accounts\nreceivable, and systems loss will also be evaluated.\n\nI. \n\nTechnical Assistance\n\nIn line with the policy dialogue with the Government regarding private sector participation\n100.\nin power transmission and to help Powergrid explore contracting out BOOT projects, ADB has\naccorded  advisory  TA  22  to  assist  Powergrid  to  implement  one  transmission  project,  the\nMadurai-Trivandrum  400  kV  transmission  line,  on  a  BOO/BOT  basis  by  reviewing  the\nGovernment\u2019s  procedures  and  guidelines,  developing  documents  for  bidding,  and  evaluating\nproposals  received  during  the  solicitation.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $830,000\nequivalent.  ADB  is  financing  $600,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.\nPowergrid is financing the remaining $230,000 equivalent.\n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nThe financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2000\n101.\nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to\nreal  terms  by  removing  the  projected  effects  of  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency\nfluctuations.  The  FIRR  was  computed  for  the  total  Project  because  of  the  Project\u2019s  integrated\nnature  and  the  practical  difficulties  associated  with  allocating  benefits  and  operating  costs\namong  the  various  subprojects.  The  subprojects  will  contribute  to  the  overall  strengthening  of\nthe power transmission system in India, but they are not stand-alone cost or revenue centers.\n\n                                                \n22 TA-3380  IND:  Private Sector Participation in Electricity Transmission,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  28  December\n\n1999.\n\n\f25\n\n102.\nThe FIRR computed on an after-tax basis, is 7.8 percent. An FIRR of 7.8% in real terms\nequates to a rate of return, in nominal terms of approximately 14%. This is consistent with the\nrate of return of equity stipulated at 16%. The FIRR compares favorably with the WACC, also\ncomputed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  of  5.1 percent.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRR  is\nrobust under adverse conditions. The tariff protocol, described in para. 87, allows for full pass-\nthrough of any foreign exchange loss on the foreign currency-denominated debt. Normal levels\nof  devaluation,  based  on  the  differential  between  domestic  and  international  inflation\nprojections,  have  been  incorporated  into  the  financial  projections.  Sensitivity  to  further\ndevaluation  was  analyzed  given  the  provisions  of  the  tariff  protocol.  The  sensitivity  analysis  is\nsummarized in Table 6 and the detailed financial evaluation is in Appendix 13.\n\nTable 6: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nScenario\n\nBase Case\nOne year Construction Delay\n10 Percent Increase in Project Cost\n10 Percent Decrease in Tariffs\n\nFIRR WACC\n ( % )\n( % )\n\n7.8\n6.8\n6.6\n6.2\n\n5.1\n5.1\n5.4\n5.1\n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return,   WACC = weighted average cost of capital.\n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n103.\nThe  proposed  sector  loan  will  finance  a  number  of  separate  subprojects,  which  will  be\nevaluated  individually  before  final  approval  by  ADB  to  ensure  that  they  are  (i)  technically\nfeasible,  (ii)  the  least-cost  alternative,  and  (iii)  economically  viable  with  an  economic  internal\nrate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  at  least  12  percent.  Five  subprojects  have  been  identified  for  the  first\nbatch  of  appraisal  activity;  three  are  generation-linked  schemes  while  the  remaining  two  are\ngrid-strengthening activities.  Economic analysis was undertaken for all subprojects.  Details of\nthe analysis are in Appendix 14; a summary is in the following paragraphs and in Table 7.\n\nTable 7: Economic Internal Rates of Return of Subprojects\n\nSubproject\n\nEIRR (%) NPV (Rs million)\n\nPart A.

The present capacity of direct interconnection\nbetween  the  eastern  and  western  regions  is  limited  and  allows  for  only  suboptimal  use  of\n\n\f26\n\nexisting generating facilities in the eastern region.  Interconnection between the two regions is a\nstrategic investment for creating a national grid, since it permits future transmission links to the\nnorthern and southern regions.\n\n105.\nThe  western  region  is  suffering  a  deficit  of  about  2,000  MW  during  peak  hours  and  is\ncurrently importing up to 400-450 MW of power from the eastern region, which has a surplus of\nabout 1,500 MW. This generation surplus is expected to increase further in the medium term.  In\naddition,  power  from  neighboring  countries  like  Bhutan  and  Nepal  will  also  be  imported  to  the\neastern region for onward transfer to other deficit regions of the Indian grid.\n\n106.  Two thirds of power transferred through the Raipur-Rourkela line is allocated to Gujarat\nand Madhya Pradesh, while the state of Maharashtra will receive the other one third according\nto a formula specified by the CEA. Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are two of ADB\u2019s focal states,\nwhich are in the process of undertaking far-reaching reforms in government finances and their\nrespective  power  sectors.  In  addition  to  the  public  resource  management  program  loans\napproved  for  Gujarat  and  Madhya  Pradesh  23  ADB  is  currently  preparing  power  sector  reform\ninterventions  in  both  states.  The  east-west  Interconnector  will  help  ensure  that  Gujarat  and\nMadhya  Pradesh  can  improve  the  delivery  of  power  supply  to  their  customers  at  lower  costs\nand  thereby  maintain  and  reinforce  the  momentum  and  support  for  power  sector  reform.\nPowergrid\u2019s  alignment  of  its  investment  program  to  directly  support  state  power  reform\nprograms  is  a  critical  complement  to  ADB\u2019s  state-level  activities  and  underlines  the  policy\nconcept of targeting investments in central sector agencies,which promote state sector reforms.\nThe EIRR calculated on the basis of 675 million additional units of power is 23 percent.\n\nThe  Kolhapur-Ponda  subproject  is  dedicated  to  serve  the  small  coastal  state  of  Goa,\n107.\nwhich does not have generating capacity of its own. Goa, located in the extreme far west of the\nwestern  region,  depends  fully  on  power  transfers  through  one  220  kV  double-circuit  line\ntraversing Maharashtra, the state\u2019s only neighbor in the western region. Given the overloading\nof this line and the fact that the line is also tapped at two substations in Maharashtra, Goa is not\nin a position to draw its full share of central sector generation capacity from the grid. The current\nshortfall  is  approximately  90  MW.  The  proposed  400  kV  line  will  enable  Goa  to  draw  its\nmaximum allocation from the western grid. In addition, the subproject will lead to other benefits,\nsuch  as  the  ability  to  service  the  future  load  growth  in  Goa  and  parts  of  Maharashtra  and  to\nincrease the reliability of power supply to those areas.\n\n108.\nThe  second  major  quantified  economic  benefit  associated  with  the  Kolhapur-Ponda\nsubproject  is  a  reduction  in  transmission  loss  of  about  40  MW  compared  with  the  220  kV\nalternative. Least-cost analysis by Powergrid showed that the higher capital cost of the 400 kV\nline is easily compensated by the savings in annual incremental energy loss. The EIRR of the\nsubproject is estimated at 23 percent.\n\n109. As  the  new  transmission  lines  are  linked  to  the  existing  generating  capacity,  only\nincremental  economic  sent-out  costs  were  taken  into  account  in  the  economic  evaluation.\nA similar approach was taken with regard to incremental distribution cost. The limiting factor in\ndrawing  a  full  share  of  allocated  central  generation  is  insufficient  intra  and  interregional\ntransmission capacity;  thus, it is  assumed that no new distribution investment is required,  and\nthat  the  existing  distribution  network  in  each  beneficiary  state  is  sufficient  to  absorb  the\nadditional energy. Given the size of the states and the amount of incremental energy used in the\n\n                                                \n23 Loan IND-1506 Gujarat Public Sector Resource Management Program, for $250 million, approved on 18 December\n1996; and Loan 1707-IND: Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program, for $250 million, approved on\n14 December 1999.\n\n\f27\n\neconomic evaluation this assumption appears reasonable.  Consequently, only additional costs\nfor the distribution network were included in the calculation.\n\n110.\nThe  incremental  economic  benefits  were  estimated  based  on  the  value  of  the  power\nsupply to the final consumers, calculated separately for the major consumer categories in each\nstate benefiting from the new transmission lines, after deducting for auxiliary consumption, and\ntransmission and distribution losses.\n\nb. \n\nGeneration-Linked Schemes\n\n111. NTPC is expanding three of its gas-fired generation facilities at Anta in Rajasthan State,\nand  Gandhar  and  Kawas  in  Gujarat  State.  These  facilities  are  to  be  constructed  within  the\npremises of already existing plants, making extensive use of facilities on site and rights-of-way\nto  achieve  economies  of  scale.  The  alternative  would  have  been  to  build  coal-fired  power\nstations and to transport the coal from far-off mines. However, NTPC determined in 1993 that\ntransporting the high-ash coal available in India beyond 400 km is uneconomical and also leads\nto environmental problems related to disposal of the residual ash especially in populated areas.\n\n112. While  the  power  evacuation  project  associated  with  the  Anta-II  generation  project  is  in\nthe northern region, those associated with the Kawas-II and Gandhar-II generation projects are\nin the western region. The general approach used to evaluate transmission lines linked to new\ngeneration plants is to compare the total incremental economic cost of generation, transmission\nfrom and distribution with the incremental economic benefits. The benefits are estimated on the\nvalue of the power supply to the final consumers, calculated separately for the major consumer\ncategories  in  each  state  supplied  by  the  new  power  plants,  after  deducting  for  auxiliary\nconsumption, and transmission and distribution losses.  Sent-out costs per kWh from the new\ngeneration plants were taken from the respective feasibility studies and were adjusted to reflect\neconomic costs.\n\n113.\nThe three power plants are all designed to use natural gas as well as naphtha and the\nfeasibility studies ran calculations for sent-out costs for both types of fuel. Use of natural gas in\nthe plants depends on the development of gas terminals, and Memorandum of Understanding\nfor  the  construction  of  two  terminals  dedicated  to  serve  the  three  plants  were  signed  in  early\n2000. The terminals are expected to come into operation by end-2003, which is approximately\nsix  months  after  the  construction  of  the  power  plants  will  be  completed.  In  the  economic\nevaluation of the transmission projects, variable sent-out costs were calculated on the basis of a\nliquefied natural gas (LNG) price of $4 per million Btu. However, for the first year of the plants\noperations,  it  was  assumed  that  indigenous  naphtha  would  be  used  at  a  cost  of  Rs17,000\n($382) per ton.\n\n114. Associated investments in distribution facilities to utilize the incremental power from the\nnew  power  stations  had  been  assumed  for  states  that  are  allocated  more  than  100  MW.  For\nstates  with  allocations  below  100  MW,  it  was  assumed  that  this  incremental  power  will  be\nutilized  to  offset  the  current  power-supply  shortages.  Therefore  only  incremental  O&M  cost\nrelated to distribution services were assumed.\n\nThe  EIRRs  were  estimated  to  be  36  percent  for  Anta-II,  24  percent  for  Kawas-II,  and\n\n115.\n28 percent for Gandhar-II.\n\n116. Sensitivity analysis was carried out for all subprojects. The details are in Appendix 14.\n\n\f28\n\n3. \n\nRisks\n\n117.\nThe Project involves no major risk. Powergrid is required to provide internally generated\nfunds  to  finance  20  percent  of  the  project  cost.  The  risk  of  shortfall  in  this  is  low  because  its\nfunds resources are expected to be comfortably above this requirement from FY2000 onward.\nAlso, since the project expenditure forms only part of Powergrid\u2019s capital expenditure program,\nthe Project will be given priority. From Powergrid\u2019s past performance, especially in the ongoing\nloan,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  risks  are  minimal.  Since  all  foreign  exchange\nfluctuations are a pass-through to the transmission service tariff, the only risk would arise from\ndelays in tariff increase. However, the establishment of CERC minimizes this risk. Demand risk\nis  minimal  since  the  national  construction  program  is  planning  for  shortages,  even  after  its\ncompletion. If demand growth is lower than that assumed, the satisfaction level will increase. In\nany case the identified subprojects are part of the least-cost solutions, and therefore  will always\nenjoy priority over other investments in transmission.  The only risk arises from the deferment of\nthe  construction  of  the  generation  projects  of  NTPC  to  which  these  transmission  systems  are\nlinked.  This  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  delaying  subproject  implementation  until  a  reasonable\nlevel of commitment has been received from NTPC. The EIRR of the Project has been tested\nfor delays of up to two years for completion of the generation facilities and has been found to be\nrobust.\n\nB. \n\nEnvironment\n\n118.\nThe transmission subprojects and the implementation of the availability tariff will reduce\nthe  total  output  of  pollutants  from  power  plants  by  enforcing  the  optimal  use  of  generation\nfacilities  through  (i)  a  tariff  structure  that  ensures  economical  load  dispatching  wherein  least-\ncost  hydropower  and  efficient  thermal  plants  have  the  highest  position  in  the  merit  order;\n(ii) transferring electricity from one regional grid to another to benefit from the diversity in peak\ndemand hours and optimizing the interregional use of power plants; and (iii) reducing demands\nto  transport  coal  with  a  very  high  ash  content  on  the  overloaded  railroad  systems,  which  will\nlead  to  environmental  benefits  from  reduced  ash  disposal.  Energy  resources  will  be  saved  by\nreducing  transmission  losses,  improving  voltage  and  frequency,  and  decreasing  system\noverloading.  The  availability  of  improved  power  supply  will  reduce  the  use  of  uneconomical\ncaptive power generation.\n\nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions\n\nThe  Project  will  benefit  industrial,  commercial,  residential,  and  agriculture  customers\n119.\nthroughout India. It will allow India to supply electricity to additional households and to have a\nmore  reliable  supply  of  power.  By  inducing  industrial  and  commercial  activity,  the  Project  will\ncreate  more  job  opportunities  and  improve  productivity  and  the  quality  of  outputs  in  the\nmanufacturing sector.\n\nD. \n\nPoverty Reduction\n\nThe Indian economy needs to grow by about 7 percent per annum to significantly reduce\n120.\npoverty  over  the  next  20  years.  Availability  of  low-cost  reliable  power  is  one  of  the  key\nrequirements  for  such  growth.  By  supporting  provision  of  low-cost  power,  the  Project  is\ncontributing to pro-poor growth in the country.\n\n\fE. \n\nInformation Technology\n\n29\n\n121. Several of the transmission lines being financed by ADB's ongoing loan and the Project\nhave  optic  fibre  cores  incorporated  in  their  earth  wires.  This  has  opened  up  possibilities  of\nimproving  communications  in  India  through  leasing  of  these  optic  fiber  cores.  Powergrid  is\nworking  with  telecom  companies  to  commercialize  this  asset.  The  first  of  such  high  capacity\nlinks between New Delhi and Chandigarh was inaugurated on 2 August 2000.\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nA. \n\nPrior Actions by the Government and Powergrid\n\n122.\nIn order to obtain the commitment of the Government and Powergrid for implementation\nof sector reform and the proposed loan, the following key actions were undertaken prior to the\nloan negotiations:\n\na) \n\nPowergrid  submitted  subproject  appraisal  reports  to  ADB,  with  the  total  cost  of\nthe subprojects exceeding 50 percent of the total Project cost;\n\nPowergrid  has  identified  the  Vizag-Vijayawada  400kV  transmission  project  for\nprivate sector participation under ADB\u2019s TA;\n\nCERC has issued orders for the time-bound implementation of availability based\ntariff.

Currently,\n1.\nsurplus  power  up  to  500  MW  is  being  transferred  to  other  regions  on  radial  AC  transmission\nlines  or,  in  the  near  future,  high  voltage  direct  current  (HVDC)  systems.  The  proposed\nsubproject intends to install the first AC interconnection through synchronous link between the\neastern and western regions. The proposed AC synchronous interconnection has the following\nadvantages compared with HVDC interconnection.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nIt is far more economical than HVDC link for the same transfer capacity and more\nflexible for future expansion.\nThe  strong  system  stability  of  the  western  region  can  strengthen  the  system\nstability of the eastern region.\nSystem frequency will be improved due to the larger synchronized system.\nPostdisturbance  system  frequency  deviation  and  system  instability  will  be\ndecreased by the larger synchronized system\nLoad  dispatch  will  be  optimal  because  more  economic  reserve  power  will  be\nshared by  both regions.\n\n2.\n\n The scope of work of the proposed subproject is as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nRourkela  \u2013  Raipur  400  kilovolt  (kV)  double-circuit  (D/C)  transmission  line  (400\nkilometers [km])\nBay extensions at Rourkela and Raipur\n\nA-2. Grid Strengthening for Goa (First Batch)\n\n3.\nGoa receives substantial share of its power from the central sector generating stations in\nwestern region through Kolhapur \u2013 Ponda 220 kV D/C line which is inadequate to transfer the\nfull share of Goa from the rest of the western region. Moreover, voltage level at the Goa end is a\nvery low level of about 170 kV at 220 kV bus bar, especially at the peak demand time. Taking\ninto  account  the  load  growth  in  Goa  and  above  constraints,  it  is  proposed  to  install  a  direct\n400 kV link to the existing 220 kV Goa system. Additional power supply for future load growth\nwith improved reliability is expected in addition to transmission loss reduction.\n\n4.\n\nThe scope of work is as follows:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nKolhapur \u2013 Ponda 400 kV D/C transmission line (160 km)\nNew 400/220 kV substation at Ponda with 2X315 MVA auto transformers\n50 MVAR, 420 kV bus reactor at Ponda\nBay extension at Kolhapur\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nA-3. Grid Strengthening for Southern Region (second batch)\n\n5.\n\nScope of work of the proposed subproject is indicated below:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nKhammam \u2013 Nagarjunasagar 400 kV S/C transmission line (150 km)\nHyderabad \u2013 Kurnool \u2013 Gooty 400 kV S/C transmission line (300 km)\nGooty \u2013 Bangalore 400 kV S/C transmission line (300 km)\nBay  extension  at  Khammam,  Nagarjunasagar,  Hyderabad,  and  Gooty\n(Powergrid)\nBay extension at Bangalore (KEB)\nBay extension at Kurnool (APSEB)\n\nA-4.\n\nInterconnection Strengthening between India and Bangladesh\n(second batch)\n\nThe eastern region of India has surplus power round the year and it shares the boundary\n6.\nwith  the  west  zone  of  Bangladesh,  which  has  power  deficit.  An  interconnection  between  the\neastern region of India and the west zone of Bangladesh can facilitate the transfer of power to\nBangladesh. Similarly, an interconnection between the east zone of Bangladesh and the north-\neast region of India will enable Bangladesh to supply power to India.\n\n7.\n\nThe scope of work is as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nKrishnanagar/Baharampur (India) \u2013 Ishurdi (Bangladesh) 220 kV D/C\n transmission line (45 km)\nKumarghat  (India)  \u2013  Shahjibazar  (Bangladesh)  220  kV  D/C  transmission  Line\n(40 km)\nNew 400/220 kV Substation at Krishnanagar with 315 MVA Auto Transformer\nBay extension at 132 kV Kumarghat\n\nPart B:\n\nGeneration Linked Schemes\n\nB-1. Kawas-II Transmission System (first batch)\n\n8.\nOutput  power  of  the  existing  Kawas-I  (650  MW)  is  evacuated  by  three  220  kV\ntransmission  systems.  Because  of  severe  constraint  of  the  right-of-way  around  Kawas,  the\nproposed  subproject  will  install  400  kV  transmission  system  to  evacuate  Kawas-II  (additional\n650 MW). Furthermore, a new 400 kV substation (Valsad) will be installed in the southern part\nof  Gujarat  with  overall  network  enhancement.  This  subproject  will  result  in  more  reliable  and\nadditional power supply to southern Gujarat and transmission loss reduction.\n\n9.\n\nThe scope of work is as follows:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nKawas-Valsad 400 kV D/C transmission line (125 km)\nLILO of Gandhar-Padge 400 kV S/C line at new Valsad substation (15 km)\nNew 400/220 kV substation at Valsad with 2X315 MVA Auto Transformers\n\nB-2. Gandhar-II Transmission System  (first batch)\n\n10.\nAlong  with  the  installation  of  Gandhar-II  (additional  650  MW),  Gujarat  Electricity  Board\nwill  install a  new  400 kV  substation  at Kasor  to supply power to  major load  centers in  north\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\nGujarat.  The  existing  200  kV  line  from  Gandhar  to  Haldawara  is  sometimes  overloaded.  The\nproposed  subproject  intends  to  install  direct  connection  between  Gandhar  and  Kasor  and  to\nresolve the overload in the existing system.\n\n11.\n\nThe scope of work is as follows:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nGandhar (NTPC) - Mobha 220 kV D/C transmission line (50 km)\nLILO of Gandhar-Dehgam 400 kV D/C transmission line at Kasor (25 km)\n\nB-3. Anta-II Transmission System  (first batch)\n\nOutput power of the existing Anta-I (413 MW) is evacuated by four 220 kV transmission\n12.\nlines. Because of the load growth of Beawar and Ajmer areas, direct power transfer from Anta to\nBeawar  by  400  kV  transmission  lines  is  preferable  after  expansion  of  Anta-II  (additional  650\nMW)  to  improve  system  reliability  and  to  reduce  transmission  loss.  In  addition,  the  proposed\nsubproject will conserve the right-of-way around Anta.\n\n13.\n\nThe scope of work is as follows:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nAnta-Beawar 400 kV D/C transmission line (200 km)\nNew 400/220 kV substation at Beawar with 2X315 MVA auto transformers\n\nB-4. Ramagundam-III Transmission System  (second batch)\n\n14.\nThe output power of the existing Ramagundam (2,100 MW) power station is evacuated\nby  five  400  kV  transmission  lines.  The  lines  remain  critically  loaded  most  of  the  time.\nConstraints in power transmission have been experienced very often, especially during summer\nand winter, compounded by the low-voltage conditions of the system. The proposed subproject\nwill provide an additional 400 kV power evacuation line for the expansion of Ramagundam (500\nMW) and result in a more reliable power supply to the southern region.\n\n15.\n\nThe scope of work is as follows:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nRamagundam \u2013 Hyderabad 400 kV D/C transmission line (200 km)\nBay extension at Hyderabad (Powergrid)\n\nB-5.\n\nTala Transmission System (second batch)\n\n16.\nThe Tala hydropower project (1,020 MW) is being developed by the Royal Government\nof  Bhutan  with  assistance  from  the  Government  of  India.  Tala  Hydro  Power  Authority,  an\nautonomous  body,  is  executing  the  project.  A  large  quantum  of  power  from  this  project  is\nplanned  to  be  transferred  to  India.  The  proposed  subproject  intends  to  transfer  the  generated\npower through the eastern region and then further to the northern region, which suffers power\ndeficit.  Possibility  of  transfer  of  part  of  this  power  to  Bangladesh  can  also  be  considered\nsubsequently.\n\n17.\n\nThe scope of work is as follows:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nBay extensions at Siliguri, Purnea, Gorakhpur, and Lucknow\nNew 400/200 kV substation at Muzaffarpur.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 5\n\nProject Component\n\nCOST ESTIMATES OF THE CANDIDATE SUBPROJECTS\n\nForeign\nCost\n($ million)\n\nLocal Costs\n\n(Rs. millions)\n\n($ millions\nequivalent)\n\nTotal\nCost\n($ million)\n\nPart A: Grid Strengthening Schemes (First Batch) \n\nA-1\n\nInter-regional Link Strengthening (East-West, \n400 kV D/C Raipur-Rourkela)\nBase Cost\nPhysical Contingencies\nPrice Contingencies\nIDC\nTotal Cost\n\n43.85\n4.39\n2.91\n10.36\n61.51\n\nA-2 Grid Strengthening for Goa (400 kV D/C Kolhapur-Ponda)\n29.47\n2.95\n1.96\n6.95\n41.33\n\nBase Cost\nPhysical Contingencies\nPrice Contingencies\nIDC\nTotal Cost\n\nPart B: Generation Linked Schemes (First Batch)\n\nB-1 Kawas-II (650 MW) Transmission System\n\nBase Cost\nPhysical Contingencies\nPrice Contingencies\nIDC\nTotal Cost\n\nBase Cost\nPhysical Contingencies\nPrice Contingencies\nIDC\nTotal Cost\n\nBase Cost\nPhysical Contingencies\nPrice Contingencies\nIDC\nTotal Cost\n\nB-2 Gandhar-II (650 MW) Transmission System\n\n(NTPC, Gujarat)\n\nB-3 Anta-II (650MW) Transmission System\n\n(NTPC, Rajasthan)\n\n625.70\n62.56\n79.65\n110.27\n878.18\n\n536.74\n53.68\n66.65\n127.73\n784.80\n\n411.89\n41.19\n47.36\n109.76\n610.20\n\n133.83\n13.38\n15.46\n21.52\n184.19\n\n498.52\n49.85\n53.23\n69.95\n671.55\n\n12.88\n1.29\n1.60\n2.19\n17.96\n\n11.19\n1.12\n1.36\n2.50\n16.17\n\n8.55\n0.86\n0.96\n2.14\n12.51\n\n2.75\n0.28\n0.31\n0.42\n3.76\n\n10.33\n1.03\n1.08\n1.36\n13.80\n\n56.73\n5.68\n4.51\n12.55\n79.47\n\n40.66\n4.07\n3.32\n9.45\n57.50\n\n26.26\n2.63\n2.13\n6.33\n37.35\n\n13.18\n1.32\n1.00\n2.88\n18.38\n\n40.56\n4.05\n3.10\n8.40\n56.11\n\n(NTPC, Gujarat)\n17.71\n1.77\n1.17\n4.19\n24.84\n\n10.43\n1.04\n0.69\n2.46\n14.62\n\n30.23\n3.02\n2.02\n7.04\n42.31\n\nIDC = interest during construction;  NTPC = National Thermal Power Corporation Limited\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 6, page 1\n\nMAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE COMMERCIAL COFINANCING\nAND ESTIMATED GUARANTEE FEES SCHEDULE\n\nBorrower\n\nPower Grid Corporation of India Limited\n\nADB  in  the  form  of  a  partial  credit  guarantee  (Guarantee)  covering  the\nperiod  specified  below.

It  is  a  national  transmission\nutility  responsible  for  evacuating  power  from  central  power  plants  and  for  developing  and\noperating  transmission  facilities  to  enable  power  interchange  among  state  electricity  boards\nboth within and between regions.\n\nPowergrid has a total authorized capital of Rs50 billion, comprising of 50 million shares\n2.\nwith  a  par  value  of  Rs1,000  per  share.  As  of  31  March  2000,  28,886,540  shares  had  been\nissued for a total paid-up and subscribed capital of Rs30,495 million (including a share capital\ndeposit of Rs1,609 million). Powergrid is 100 percent owned by the Government of India.\n\nB. \n\nPast Financial Performance\n\n3.\nPowergrid  commenced  commercial  operations  in  August  1991  and  has  been  profitable\nin  each  year  with  the  exception  of  the  first  partial  year  of  operations.  Since  31  March  1993,\nsales  have  grown  at  an  average  rate  of  18  percent  per  annum,  with  net  profit  increasing  by\napproximately 9 percent per annum. Total operating expenses have been less than 11 percent\nof net fixed assets.\n\n4.\nPowergrid has maintained positive cash flow from operations. Continued expansion has\nbeen  financed  partially  through  internally  generated  funds,  equity  contributions  from  the\nGovernment, and a combination of short-, medium-, and long-term debt.\n\n5.\nWhile maintaining a positive cash flow and a relatively strong balance sheet, Powergrid\nis  facing  some  difficulty  with  collecting  accounts  receivable.  Accounts  receivable  amounted  to\n8.4  months  of  sales  at  the  end  of  FY2000.  The  Asian  Development  Bank's  loan  covenant\nstipulated  that  accounts  receivable  should  represent  no  more  than  2.0  months  of  sales.  The\nGovernment has approved a provision of Rs3,460 million as central appropriation to Powergrid\nto liquidate the outstanding accounts receivable as of 31 March 1997. Rs1,075 million had been\nreceived as of 31 March 2000, and the balance of Rs2,385 million will be received over the next\nseven years.  After taking into account the component of accounts receivable to be paid through\nthe  central  appropriation,  the  adjusted  accounts  receivable  balance  as  of  31  March  2000\nrepresents 5.6 months sales.\n\nC. \n\nFinancial Projections\n\n1.  General\n\n6.\nThe  effect  of  the  proposed  Project  on  the  financial  position  of  Powergrid  has  been\nreflected  in  the  projected  financial  statements.  Projections  were  prepared  on  a  nominal  basis\nbased on major assumptions outlined in the following paragraphs.\n\n7.\nDomestic  inflation  rates  were  assumed  to  be  6.5  percent  while  international  inflation\nrates were assumed to be 2.4 percent throughout the projections from the year ending 31 March\n2001.\n\n\f2. \n\nRevenues\n\n56\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\n8.\nPrimary  sources  of  revenue  for  Powergrid  will  be  transmission  tariffs  and  the  sale  of\nelectricity. In addition, Powergrid will continue to provide nominal project management services\nand  generate  a  limited  amount  of  revenue  through  sale  of  services  and  documentation  for\ncontracts, bidding documents, and other miscellaneous sources (Table A 4.1).\n\na. \n\nTransmission Revenue\n\n9.\nPowergrid's  transmission  tariff  is  defined  by  F.  No.  2/3/Powergrid/Tariff/97,  the  tariff\nprotocol  passed  by  the  Government  of  India's  Ministry  of  Power  on  16  December  1997  with\neffect from 1 April 1997.  According to the notification, the tariff structure includes the following\ncomponents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n16  percent  return  on  the  deemed  equity  portion  of  transmission  assets  as  of\n31 March  1997.    For  purposes  of  computation,  this  has  been  defined  as\n50 percent of net book value of fixed assets as of 31 March 1997.\n\n16 percent return on equity as of 31 March 1997 (less deemed equity defined in\n(i) plus the self-financed portion of annual capital expansion.\n\nFull  recovery  of  depreciation,  interest  on  foreign  and  domestic  borrowings,\ninterest  on  bonds,  foreign  exchange  losses,  and  taxes  on  profits  earned  from\ntransmission activities.\n\nInterest on working capital, based on 2 months sales in accounts receivable, one\nmonth\u2019s  operating  and  maintenance  expenditure,  and  a  spares  provision  based\non  1  percent  of  fixed  assets.  Interest  on  working  capital  charged  at  the  rate  of\n17 percent per annum.\n\nA provision for operating and maintenance expenditure based on 1.5 percent of\nthe  original  value  of  fixed  assets,  adjusted  annually  to  reflect  the  impact  of\ndomestic inflation.\n\n10.\n\nBased on the above, the annual tariffs are assumed as in Table A10.1\n\nTable A10.1: Annual Tariffs\nRs Million\n\nItem\n\n2000/01\n\n2001/02\n\n2002/03\n\n2003/04\n\n2004/05\n\n2005/06\n\n2006/07 \u2026 2019/20\n\nReturn on deemed capital\nReturn on share capital\nDepreciation\nInterest\nForeign exchange loss\nTaxes\nInterest on working capital\nOperation  &  maintenance\nprovision\n\n3,439\n2,240\n6,707\n7,053\n635\n0\n582\n3,247\n\n3,439\n3,365\n7,805\n6,511\n1,754\n718\n621\n3,833\n\n3,439\n4,335\n8,837\n6,307\n2,876\n930\n635\n4,457\n\n3,439\n5,498\n10,106\n5,925\n4,192\n1,089\n721\n5,197\n\n3,439\n6,836\n11,570\n9,829\n4,850\n1,287\n824\n6,052\n\n3,439\n9,243\n13,697\n10,770\n5,317\n1,495\n970\n7,150\n\n3,439\n10,408\n13,959\n12,432\n5,123\n1,882\n1,069\n7,886\n\n3,439\n21,322\n21,342\n16,860\n1,528\n17,144\n3,036\n25,223\n\n23,903\n\n28,046\n\n31,816\n\n36,167\n\n44,687\n\n52,081\n\n56,198\n\n109,894\n\n\fb.\n\nOther Revenue\n\n57\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\n11.\nSale  of  electric  power  was  based  on  actual  1999-2000  levels,  adjusted  to  reflect  the\nannual  impact  of  domestic  inflation.

In  addition,  real  growth  rates  of  20  percent  in  2000-01  through\n2002/03  and  15  percent  in  2003/04  and  2004/05  were  assumed  to  reflect  the  rapid  levels  of\ncapital expansion expected during this period.\n\nAdministrative expenses were based on actual costs in 1999-2000 adjusted to reflect the\n15.\nimpact of domestic inflation. In addition, real growth was assumed on a diminishing basis from\n2000/01 through 2002/03 to reflect capital expansion expected during this period.\n\nDepreciation  was  computed  at  an  average  rate  of  6  percent  on  a  declining  balance\n\n16.\nbasis.\n\nPurchase  of  electricity  was  based  on  actual  costs  in  1999-2000,  which  amounted  to\n\n17.\nalmost 100 percent of total electricity sales.\n\n18.\nInterest expense was been computed on a facility basis. It was assumed that interest will\nbe  paid  in  the  year  incurred,  with  the  exception  of  certain  bond  facilities,  where  interest  is\naccrued until such time as the bond is paid in full (Table A10.5).\n\nb.\n\nInterest Expense\n\nc.\n\nTax Expense\n\n19.\nTaxes  were  computed  at  a  rate  of  10.5  percent  per  annum  until  2003/04  to  reflect  the\ncapital expansion stage of the company. From 2004/05 onward, taxes were computed at a rate\nof 30 percent per annum.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nd.\n\nDividend Expense\n\nDividends  weere  computed  on  the  basis  of  Rs220  million  per  annum  from  2000/01  to\n20.\n2002/03.  This  is  the  amount  stipulated  by  the  Government  of  India.  It  was  assumed  that  from\n2002/03  onwards,  dividends  would  be  based  on  the  balance  of  cash  available  in  excess  of\ncurrent debt service obligations.\n\n4. \n\nBalance Sheet Assumptions\n\n21.\nAccounts  receivable  represent  3  months  sales  in  2000-/1,  and  2  months  sales  from\n2001/02  onward.  Inventory  levels  were  assumed  to  be  33  months  of  transmission  expenses\nbased on actual inventory levels as of 31 March 2000.\n\n22.\nConstruction  in  progress  (Table  A10.5)  reflects  projects  currently  being  undertaken\nunder  Powergrid's  9th  development  program  including  the  Project.  It  was  assumed  that  assets\nwill  be  gradually  transferred  to  fixed  assets  during  the  period  2000/01  through  2003/04.  From\n2003/04  through  2009/10  additional  capital  expansion  is  assumed  according  to  Powergrid's\ncapital  investment  program.  From  2009/10  onward  capital  expansion  is  assumed  to  be\napproximately  78  per  annum  with  an  average  project  taking  two  years  to  implement.\nConstruction stores and supplies were assumed to be constant at 1999-2000 actual levels.\n\n23.\nAccounts  payable  were  computed  on  the  basis  of  one  month\u2019s  expenditures  on\nelectricity  purchases,  transmission  and  administration,  and  procurement  of  inventory  and\nconstruction  supplies.  In  addition,  one  month\u2019s  construction  in  progress  is  included  in  the\naccounts payable balance.\n\nInterest  and  taxes  were  assumed  to  be  paid  in  the  year  in  which  they  are  incurred.\n\n24.\nDividends will be paid in full one year following their declaration.\n\nPrincipal  repayments  with  respect  to  bonds,  and  foreign  and  domestic  debt  were\n\n25.\ncomputed on

population that is expected to consume the power which will be\nproduced or distributed.\n\nAs per the agreement reached with the constituents of Western region Goa\u2019s  share of  Power\nfrom  central  sector  projects  of  Western  Region  is  395  MW.  Since  this  transmission  line  is\nconstructed exclusively for transferring power from Western grid to Goa state the population of\nentire Goa is going to be benefited.\n\nIdentify and quantify the subgroups, within the client population (e.g. industrial consumers,\nresidential consumers, electric co-operatives etc) which are likely to have different needs and\ndemands.\n \n Not  applicable,  since  Powergrid\u2019s  role  is  restricted  only  to  transmission  of  bulk  power  from\ngenerating station to different load center and further distribution of available power is taken up\nby concerned SEBs.\n \nB.\n\nClientele Demands\n\nAssess the ability and willingness of the major consumer groups to pay tariffs for electricity\nwhich are needed to sustain the operations of the facilities.\n\nThe  project  is  regional  in  nature  and  all  the  constituents  of  Western  Region  decided  in  the\nstanding committee meeting of Power System Planning in Western Region arranged by CEA on\n18th  July  1998  at  Mumbai,  that  all  the  beneficiaries  of  Western  Region  will  share  the\ntransmission tariff.\n\n   C.\n\nPotential Adverse Impacts\n\nDetermine if some groups of people will have to be relocated according to the power generation,\ntransmission or distribution plan (e.g from dam sites, thermal power sites, rights-of-way).\n\nAs  per  the  existing  Indian  laws,  land  for  right-of-way  (ROW)  of  a  transmission  line  is  not\nacquired.    As  such  there  is  no  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  involved  in  transmission  line\nconstruction works.  However, for the proposed new substation at  Mapusa in Goa State, 30.34\nhectare land is being acquired that may affect about 17 people.\n\nDetermine if the project will cause the loss of farmland, grazing land, forests streams or\ngroundwater  which supply local livelihoods, provide food or water sources.\n\nFor the proposed new  substation near Mapusa a total of 30.34 ha. Of land in village Colvale,\nBardez Taluka, Mapusa district, has been selected and acquired after analysis of 4-5 different\nsites by the Committee constituted by the Government of Goa. The proposed land is located at\napproximately  6  km.  from  Mapusa  and  25  km  from  the  state  capital  Panjim,  on  the  National\nhighway # 17.  Most of  the land  i.e. 27.56 ha.  (90%) is  government  land under  the control  of\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nComunidade and rest 2.77 ha (10%) is private land. The land is mostly undulated and barren.\nAcquisition of land will affect approximately 17 persons.\n\nDetermine the possible exposure of certain groups to health hazards( e.g from downstream\nriver pollution , water-bome diseases through creation of breeding sites , from vibrations, fly ash\nfrom thermal power sites, hazardous wastes, explosions)\n\nDetermine the possibility of conflict over water rights e.g water used for downstream irrigation\ndiverted to cool boilers etc.\n\nNot  applicable.\n\nNot applicable.\n\nDetermine if traditional lands, heritage and cultural property of indigenous people  will be\ndamaged or lost ( e.g ancestral  burial  grounds, ritual sites, links with plants/substances\nessential for traditional medicine etc). Determine any significant changes in affected groups \"life\nstyles\".\n\nMore  than  90%  land  acquired  for  the  substation  is  government  land.  The  land  is  barren  and\ndoes not come under the category of ancestral burial ground or ritual sites of indigenous people.\nDetails assessment of the impact of acquisition as per the provisions of ESPP is under progress\nfor preparation of management plan to address any adverse affect.\n\nDetermine how pricing policies would affect the distribution of and access to project benefits by\npoor clients. Assess the ability of client groups who are defined as poor to afford a basic level of\nservice; identify financing measures which  are affordable for the poor groups on a sustainable\nbasis.\n\nDetailed social assessment for preparation of management plan (SAMP) is under progress as\nper  the provision of ESPP  which will include measures to be adopted for minimizing the likely\nimpact of land acquisition.\n\nPrepare a socio-economic profile for each group which would be adversely affected and\ndescribe and quantity the impact(s) on the  affected group.\n\nAs  per  the  ESPP  whenever  affected  families  are  more  than  40,  a  detailed  socio-economic\nsurvey of the proposed area is undertaken by the outside agency for making a detailed socio-\neconomic  profile.  However,  if  the  affected  families  are  less  than  40,  Social  Assessment  and\nManagement  Plan  (SAMP)  is  prepared  by  Powergrid  in-house.    Since  in  the  instant  case  the\nnumber  of  affected  families  are  far  below  the  limit  i.e.  40,  Powergrid  has  already  taken  the\ninitiative to prepare Social Assessment and Management Plan (SAMP) in consultation with the\nState Authority.  This will be in place within 60-90 days and will be implemented along with the\nproject execution.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 13, page 1\n\nFINANCIAL EVALUATION OF THE PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nGeneral\n\nThe  financial  evaluation  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  real  terms.  The  Project  cost\n1.\nestimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by removing\nthe effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations.\n\nB. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return\n\n2.\nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was calculated on a total project basis. Each\nof  the  subprojects  will  act  to  strengthen  the  overall  power  transmission  system  in  India,\nhowever, not one will operate in a stand-alone fashion. Given the practical difficulties associated\nwith arbitrarily allocating specific costs and benefits to individual subprojects, the analysis was\ncompleted on an incremental basis for Powergrid with and without the various subprojects.\n\nThe  FIRR  was  calculated  for  a  20-year  period  (to  coincide  with  the  terms  of  the  Asian\n3.\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB's) loan) on an after-tax basis (Table A 13.1) with a residual value of\n5% of capital investment cost.\n\nTable A13.1: FIRR Calculation\n(Rs Million)\n\nFiscal\nYear\n\nCapital\nInvestment\n\nIncremental\nInflows Outflows\n\nResidual\nvalue\n\nNet\n\n(2,150)\n(5,913)\n(6,812)\n(3,989)\n(2,317)\n\n2000/01\n2001/02\n2002/03\n2003/04\n2004/05\n2005/06\n2006/07\n2007/08\n2008/09\n2009/10\n2010/11\n2011/12\n2012/13\n2013/14\n2014/15\n2015/16\n2016/17\n2017/18\n2018/19\n2019/20\n\n(2,150)\n(5,913)\n(6,812)\n(3,989)\n(2,317)\n2,809\n3,383\n3,275\n3,187\n3,072\n2,952\n2,842\n2,738\n2,634\n2,536\n2,438\n2,351\n2,281\n2,211\n3,206\n\n7.8%\n\n2,937\n3,840\n4,091\n4,089\n3,978\n3,839\n3,706\n3,577\n3,446\n3,322\n3,198\n3,089\n3,001\n2,916\n2,836\n\n(128)\n(457)\n(816)\n(902)\n(906)\n(887)\n(864)\n(839)\n(812)\n(786)\n(760)\n(738)\n(720)\n(705)\n(689)\n\nFIRR\n\n1,059\n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nC. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital\n\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was calculated in real terms based on the\n\n4.\nfollowing capital structure (Table A 13.2).\n\nTable A13.2: Financing Plan\n(Rs Million)\n\nItem\n\nADB loan\nForeign Commercial Borrowings\nDomestic Commercial Borrowings\nPowergrid Internal Resources\nTotal\n\nProject\nCost\n\n13,401\n6,426\n807\n5,194\n25,828\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank\n\nThe  cost  of  foreign  debt  was  been  calculated  based  on  an  interest  rate  of  6.8  percent\n5.\napplicable  to  ADB's  loan  with  a  Government  of  India  guarantee  fee  of  1.2,  an  interest  rate  of\n7.75  percent  on  foreign  commercial  borrowings,  an  income  tax  rate  of  30  percent  per  annum,\nand an international inflation rate of 2.4 percent per annum. The cost of foreign debt took into\nconsideration  the  commitment  fee,  guarantee  fees  and  front-end  fees  applied  to  foreign\nborrowings.  On  this  basis,  and  using  an  average  outstanding  loan  balance  of  approximately\n$173.6  million  over  the  life  of  the  loans,  the  cost  of  foreign  debt  capital,  in  real  terms  was\ncomputed to be 4.1 percent.\n\n6.\nThe  cost  of  domestic  debt  was  been  calculated  based  on  an  interest  rate  of\n13.5 percent,  an  income  tax  rate  of  30  percent  per  annum  and  an  average  domestic  inflation\nrate of 6.5 percent per annum. On this basis, and using an average outstanding loan balance of\napproximately  Rs407million  over  the  life  of  the  loan,  the  cost  of  domestic  debt  capital  was\ncomputed to be 3.6 percent.\n\n7.\nThe cost of Powergrid internal resources was based on an imputed opportunity cost of\ncapital  to  the  Government  of  India,  POWERGRID\u2019s  sole  shareholder.  The  opportunity  cost  of\nequity, in real terms was computed as follows (Table A 13.3):\n\nTable A 13.3: Financial Cost of Equity in Real Terms\n\n(Rs million)\n\nItem\n\nCost of\nEquity (%)\n\nCurrent interest rate on fixed term deposits\nPlus risk premium\nFinancial cost of equity in nominal terms\nAverage domestic inflation rate\nFinancial cost of equity in real terms\n\n13.00\n3.00\n16.00\n6.5\n8.9\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\n8.\n\nBased on the above, the WACC was calculated as follows:\n\nSource\n\nForeign debt capital\n\nDomestic debt capital\n\nEquity capital\n\nWACC\n\nTable A 13.4: WACC Calculation\n(Rs million)\n\nAmount\n\n Cost (%) Weighted\nCost (%)\n\n19,827\n\n807\n\n5,194\n\n4.1\n\n3.6\n\n8.9\n\n3.2\n\n0.1\n\n1.8\n\n5.1\n\nWACC = weighted average cost of capital\n\nD. \n\nConclusion\n\n9.\nThe FIRR is expected to be 7.8 percent compared to the projected WACC of 5.1 percent\n(both computed on an after-tax basis). Considering that the main objective of the Project is to\nstrengthen  the  power  transmission  system  in  India,  the  financial  performance  is  deemed\nacceptable.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 14, page 1\n\nECONOMIC EVALUATION OF APPROVED SUBPROJECTS\n\n1.\nThe  results  of  economic  evaluation  for  the  first  five  subprojects  are  summarized  in  the\nfollowing paragraphs. Details for the Kawas- II and the Raipur-Rourkela sub-projects are shown\nin Tables A 14.1 and A 14.2. Results of the sensitivity analysis for all five subprojects are given\nin Tables A 14.3 and A 14.4.\n\nA.\n\nEconomic Benefits\n\n2.\nBase  data  and  assumptions  used  with  respect  to  the  estimation  of  economic  benefits\nwere alike for all subprojects.  Economic benefits were calculated for the four major consumer\nsegments: domestic, commercial, industrial, and agriculture.\n\n3.\nEach  subproject  was  analyzed  as  to  which  states  would  benefit  from  the  incremental\npower  supply  at  what  proportion.  Economic  benefits  were  then  calculated  separately  for  each\nstate and consumer segment.\n\n4.\nThe shares of electricity supply assumed to replace an alternative energy source in each\nconsumer  category  are  the  following:  10  percent  for  domestic,  50  percent  for  commercial  and\nindustrial,  and  20  percent  for  agriculture.  The  economic  benefit  of  fuel  substitution  is  the\nresulting  economic  resource  cost  saving,  that  is,  the  economic  cost  of  alternative  energy  that\nthe country saves by using electricity.\n\n5.\nThe shares of incremental electricity supply corresponding to induced consumption are\n90  percent  for  domestic,  50  percent  for  commercial  and  industrial,  and  80  percent  for\nagriculture.  Induced  consumption  was  valued  by  estimating  the  consumer\u2019s  willingness  to  pay\nfor this part of incremental electricity supply and adding the related consumer surplus benefits to\nthe tariff-based revenues.\n\n6.\nAlternative  sources  of  power  used  by  the  four  major  consumer  segments  were\ndetermined and their respective costs were estimated.  It was found that the dominant source of\nalternative  power  in  the  domestic  sector  is  kerosene  lamps.    Urban  domestic  consumers  use\nLPG  lights  (Petromax)  and  candles  in  addition  to  kerosene  lamps.  Rural  domestic  consumers\nrely  almost  entirely  on  kerosene  lamps.  Private  ownership  of  small  and  medium-size  diesel\ngenerators is very low and is prevalent only among high-income  consumers. Roughly around\n50 percent of total end-consumption of alternative sources of power in the domestic sector is for\nlighting  purposes.  In  the  rural  areas,  these  numbers  are  considerably  higher  due  to  the\nsignificantly  lower  ownership  of  electrical  appliances.  Thus,  during  power  cuts,  substitution  for\nelectricity  is  almost  exclusively  for  lighting  purposes.  Therefore,  economic  benefits  for  the\ndomestic sector were calculated only for 50 percent of total domestic consumption.\n\n7.\nThis  50  percent  share  was  allocated  over  three  to  four  alternative  energy  sources\ndepending  on  the  state.  For  example,  while  it  can  be  expected  that  about  5  percent  of\ncustomers in Gujarat and Maharastha own small diesel generators, this is highly unlikely to be\nthe  case  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  Therefore,  only  kerosene  lamps,  inverters,  and  kerosene\ngenerator sets were used for calculating alternative energy cost in Madhya Pradesh. However,\nthe  assumed  percentage of  ownership of these  three alternative  energy forms varies  with\nthe  economic  profile  of  each  state.  Induced  consumption  was  valued  using  the  willingness-to-\npay method plus the related consumer surplus with a curvature factor of 0.3.\n\n8.\nCommercial sector use of alternative sources of power also differs between urban and\nrural  areas.    While  in  the  urban  areas  the  commercial  sector  uses  a  mix  of  small  diesel\ngenerators, petromax, and kerosene lamps, in the  rural area kerosene lamps and  candles are\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\ndominant.  However, the large commercial sector segment shows user  patterns more similar to\nthose  small  and  medium-size  industries.  Typically,  hotels,  hospitals,  office  complexes,  and\nuniversities  would  be  considered  large  commercial  sector.  Alternative  generation  sets  vary  in\nsize  from  10  kVA  to  500  kVA.    The  average  economic  cost  of  alternative  energy  sources  for\ncommercial establishments has been estimated at Rs6.3 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for a 75- kVA\ngenerator.\n\nIn  agriculture  the  only  possible  power  alternative  is  generators  as  electric  power  is  a\n9.\nnecessity for operating irrigation pumps. The economic cost of alternative energy sources was\nthe estimated to be around Rs5.3 per kWh.\n\nThe  industry  sector  has  a  large  percentage  of  alternative  sources  of  energy.  For\n10.\nexample,  in  the  state  of  Orissa  installed  captive  generation  capacity  is  600  megawatts  (MW),\nwhich  is  50 percent  higher  than  the  amount  of  sales  to  industry  by  the  local  power  utilities.\nCaptive power facilities cover a wide range of unit size and plant types, with the most dominant\nbeing  large  diesel  generator  sets  and  thermal  plants.  For  industries  already  owning  captive\nplants  the  average  operating  cost  is  between  Rs1.50  (for  cogeneration)  and  Rs2.5  per  kWh.\nFor new captive plants, the unit costs would vary between Rs2.0 to Rs3.5 (based on 1998 fuel\nprices).   Based on a 400 kW diesel generator, captive power cost was calculated at Rs3.6 per\nkWh.\n\nB.\n\nEconomic Costs\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  economic  analysis,  the  estimated  capital  costs  for  the  five\n11.\nsubprojects  were  broken  down  into  direct  foreign  exchange  items,  indirect  foreign  exchange,\nand local goods and services.  All costs elements were valued in border prices, using a world\nprice numeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded and a standard conversion factor of 0.9 and\na  labor  conversion  factor  of  0.85  being  applied  to  all  nontraded  items.  Operating  costs  were\ncalculated  as  a  fixed  percentage  of  investment  cost  and  were  adjusted  to  reflect  economic\nvalues.\n\nFor  the  grid-strengthening  subprojects,  it  was  assumed  that  the  incremental  power\n12.\nsupply can be delivered within the existing power system network. No capital cost for generation\nand  distribution  was  therefore  included  in  the  calculation.  However,  variable  generation  costs\nwere included and valued at Rs1.2 per kWh for a typical coal-fired plant located in the eastern\nregion  close  to  the  coal  mine  mouth.      A  proportion  of  25  percent  of  the  costs  of  the  state\nelectricity  boards  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  administration,  and  miscellaneous\nexpenditures reflects incremental distribution costs.\n\nThe economic benefits of transmission required to evacuate power from new generation\n13.\nprojects, such as Kawas II, are difficult to determine independently.  Transmission is an integral\npart  of  the  total  power  system  development  plan  and  not  an  independent  investment.    The\neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  on  the  complete  investment  required  in  a  new\ngeneration  project  plus  the  associated  transmission  and  distribution  is  normally  considered  as\nrepresentative of the rate of return on this investment, as transmission is typically a small part of\nthe total investment.\n\nTherefore,  the  economic  evaluations  of  the  generation-linked  subprojects  include\n14.\neconomic  sent-out  costs  of  power  consisting  of  a  capacity  and  an  energy  component.    These\nwere estimated based on data in the feasibility studies for the three generation plants. Capital\nand maintenance costs were annualized over an assumed 20-year economic life of the plants at\na social discount rate of 12 percent.  All costs were adjusted to reflect economic costs. Sent-\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nout  costs  are  estimated  at  Rs1.23  per  kWh  for  Anta-  II,  Rs1.22  per  kWh  for  Gandhar  II,  and\nRs1.19 per kWh for Kawas- II.\n\nAnta- II is located some 600 kilometers (km) inland from the gas terminal and depends\n15.\non  the  HBJ-pipeline  for  transportation.  For  a  conservative  estimate,  a  capital  investment  of\n$50 million for compressors and other facilities to increase the pipeline capacity was included in\nthe economic evaluation.\n\n16.\nGiven  the  magnitude  of  the  incremental  electricity  supply,  additional  investment  in\ndistribution facilities will be required. It was assumed that beneficiary states with an allocation of\nmore  than  100  MW  will  need  to  expand/upgrade  their  distribution  system.  Those  costs  were\nestimated  based  on  the  commonly  used  formula  for  system  expansion,  which  assumes\ninvestment in generation:transmission:distribution, by a proportion of 60:15:25. It was assumed\nthat the distribution investment would be made in parallel to the transmission investment.  For\nstates with an allocation of less than 100 MW, only incremental distribution costs, estimated the\nsame way as for the grid-strengthening subprojects, were included.\n\nC.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn  the  basis  of  a  comparison  of  economic  costs  and  benefits  over  a  20-year  project\n17.\nlifetime,  the  proposed  subprojects  all  show  EIRR  well  above  the  social  discount  rate  of  12\npercent (Table A 14.3). Extensive sensitivity testing was carried out for the five subprojects. In\naddition  to  the  traditional  testing  for  increases  in  capital  costs,  decreases  in  benefits,  and\nimplementation  delays,  further  variables  considered  crucial  parameters  for  economic  viability\nwere  identified.  Testing  for  changes  in  the  replacement  and  incremental  shares  of  additional\nenergy  for  the  different  consumer  groups  showed  very  low  sensitivity,  with  no  impact  on  the\nviability of the subprojects. Further reduction of domestic consumer benefits to only 15 and 30\npercent of total domestic consumption shows that all projects will stay viable with the exception\nof  Anta-  II  where  the  EIRR  would  drop  to  10  percent  if  only  15  percent  of  total  domestic\nconsumption  is  included  in  the  benefit  stream.  Sensitivity  testing  for  sent-out  cost  of  power\nshowed that the viability of the Anta- II subproject depends critically on the availability of LNG as\na fuel source for the proposed new generation plant. If naphtha would need to be used during\nthe first year of operation, the project would not be viable.\n\nThis  is  explained  by  two  particularities  of  the  subproject.  The  first  reason  is  the  higher\n18.\ncapital cost for the plant since the existing site is not as evolved as the sites for Gandhar- II and\nKawas- II. Second, Anta- II will serve states not served by Kawas- II and Gandhar-II plants, and\nthus  has  a  different  benefit  stream.    The  project  sponsors  recognized  this  sensitivity  and,  to\nmitigate  the  risks,  have  decided  that  production  of  the  plant  will  only  commence  after  LNG  is\nmade  available.  Even  with  a  two-year  delay  between  the  finalization  of  construction  of  the\ntransmission  lines  and  the  commencement  of  power  generation,  the  subproject  will  be  viable.\nIn  the  base  case  analysis  for  the  grid-strengthening  subprojects,  power  generation  costs  from\ncoal-fired plants were assumed to be Rs1.2 per kWh, or double the cost indicated by NTPC and\nPowergrid.  An  increase  in  the  send-out  costs  to  Rs2/kWh  shows  that  both  subprojects  would\nbecome unviable. However, Powergrid and NTPC officially state that the sent-out costs from the\ncoal-fired plants are only Rs0.64/kWh as the coal plants are fully depreciated and testing for this\ncost shows that both projects are very robust.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 14, page 4\n\nTable A 14.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\nfor Kawas Transmission Line\n\n(Rs millions)\n\n
