In  2003, \nfollowing  an  extensive  review,  ADB  introduced \nthe  Accountability  Mechanism,  which  built  on \nthe  Inspection  Function.  The  Accountability \nMechanism  was  designed  to  enhance  ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment  effectiveness  and  project  quality; \nbe responsive to the concerns of project-affected \npeople  and  fair  to  all  stakeholders;  reflect  the \nhighest professional and technical standards in its \nstaffing and operations; be as independent and \ntransparent  as  possible;  and  be  cost-effective,  \nefficient, and complementary to the other super-\nvision,  audit,  quality  control,  and  evaluation  \nsystems at ADB. \n\nAt the 43rd Annual Meeting of the ADB Board of \nGovernors  held  in  Tashkent,  Uzbekistan  in  May \n2010,  the  President  announced  a  joint  Board \nand  Management  review  of  the  Accountability \nMechanism.  A  Board\u2013Management  working \ngroup was established to undertake the review. \nThe  working  group  engaged  two  independent \ninternational  experts  to  assist  with  the  review. \nThe objective of the review was to take stock of \nthe ADB experience, draw from the experiences \nof  similar  mechanisms,  and  examine  the  scope \nfor improving the Accountability Mechanism. The \nreview included extensive public consultations. \n\nThe review concludes that the ADB Accountability \nMechanism  has  several  strengths.  The  mecha-\nnism  was  a  pioneer  among  multilateral  devel-\nopment  banks  in  institutionalizing  the  problem \nsolving  function  for  public  and  private  sector \n\noperations. The dual functions of consultation and \ncompliance  review  effectively  complement  each \nother, ensure the right balance between indepen-\ndence  and  effectiveness,  and  are  conceptually \nsound  and  practically  valid.  The  Accountability \nparticipatory,  \nMechanism \ncredible, and effective. Both the consultation and \ncompliance review phases have been useful and \ndelivered effective outcomes. \n\ntransparent, \n\nis \n\nThe  Accountability  Mechanism  complements \nother  problem  solving  and  compliance  sys-\ntems  at  ADB.  It  reflects  ADB\u2019s  philosophy  that \nproblem  prevention  and  compliance  should  be \nmaximized in its operations, and also that once \nproblems and noncompliance occur, they should \nbe addressed promptly at the project and oper-\national  levels.  The  Accountability  Mechanism \nis  the  \u201clast  resort\u201d  for  dealing  with  problems \nand  noncompliance  that  were  not  prevented \nor  solved  at  the  project  and  operational  levels. \nThe  design  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism \nalso  recognizes  that  ADB  has  several  well- \ndeveloped  audit,  evaluation,  and  learning  sys-\ntems to ensure that its operations are conducted \nin accordance with operational policies and pro-\ncedures,  and  deliver  the  intended  results.  The \nAccountability  Mechanism  complements  these \nsystems  by  serving  as  a  focused  mechanism \nfor  project-affected  people,  thereby  enhancing \nADB\u2019s development effectiveness. \n\nHowever, the review also identified several weak-\nnesses that could be improved upon: \n\n(i)  Enabling  direct  access  to  compli-\nance  review.  ADB  should  eliminate \nthe  requirement  that  affected  people \nmust  start  with  the  consultation  pro-\ncess before they can file for compliance \n\nvii\n\n\freview. This will address the perception \nthat the problem solving function might \nhave  reduced  recourse  to  the  compli-\nance review function. It can also shorten \ndelays  for  people  who  want  to  file  for \ncompliance review directly.\n\n(iii)  Addressing  site  visit \n\n(ii)  Establishing a single entry point. Once \nADB provides direct access to both prob-\nlem  solving  and  compliance  review,  a \ncomplaint  receiving  officer  should  be \nappointed  to  serve  as  the  single  entry \npoint  to  receive  and  forward  all  com-\nplaints.  This  would  improve  the  acces-\nsibility of the Accountability Mechanism. \nissues.  ADB \nshould  use  its  good  offices  and  estab-\nlished institutional mechanisms to assist \nthe  Compliance  Review  Panel  (CRP)  in \nobtaining  access  for  site  visits.  When \na  borrowing  country  declines  to  grant \naccess  to  a  site,  Management  will  sub-\nmit  an  information  paper  to  the  Board \nexplaining why the country declined the \nsite  visit.  The  CRP  should  complete  a \ncompliance  review  even  if  a  borrowing \ncountry declines a site visit request.\n\n(iv)  Enhancing \n\nindependence. \n\nSeveral \nmeasures  are  required  to  improve  the \nCRP\u2019s  independence.  For  example,  the \nBoard  should  appoint  CRP  members \nbased  on  the  recommendation  of  the \nBoard  Compliance  Review  Committee  in \nconsultation  with  the  President.  This \nwould  improve  on  the  current  prac-\ntice  of  having  CRP  members  appointed \nby  the  Board  based  on  the  President\u2019s \nrecommendation. \n\n(v)  Clarifying  the  roles  of  compliance \nreview.  The  compliance  review  should \nfocus  on  findings  of  alleged  harm  and \nnoncompliance.  Management  should \npropose remedial actions for the Board\u2019s \napproval.  The  CRP  should  be  provided \nwith  an  opportunity  to  comment  on \nremedial \nManagement\u2019s \n\nproposed \n\nactions and communicate its comments \nto the Board.   \n\n(vi)  Clarifying the cutoff date. ADB should \nchange  the  cutoff  date  for  filing  com-\nplaints  from  the  issuance  date  of  the \nproject  completion  report  to  2  years \nafter the loan or grant closing date. This \nwould improve the clarity, certainty, and \npublic awareness of the cutoff date.\n(vii) Improving  efficiency.  Because \n\nthe \nAccountability  Mechanism  is  demand-\ndriven,  it  should  have  two  types  of  \noperating  costs: \n(a)  fixed  costs  to \nmaintain  and  operate  the  mechanism, \nregardless of the number of complaints; \nand  (b)  variable  costs  to  respond  to \nchanges  in  demand.  The  monitoring \ntime frames of the Office of the Special \nProject  Facilitator  (OSPF)  and  the  CRP \nshould  be  tailored  to  suit  each  project. \nThese  will  promote  the  optimal  use \nof  resources,  while  providing  effec-\ntive  services  to  affected  people.  The \nAccountability  Mechanism  processes \nshould be simplified. \n\n(viii) Enhancing tracking. The current track-\ning  by  the  OSPF  and  Office  of  the \nCompliance  Review  Panel  (OCRP)  of \nthe  processes  and  results  in  addressing  \nthe  complaints  should  be  comple-\nmented  by  more  systematic  tracking \nby  the  operations  departments  of  the \nineligible complaints forwarded to them \nby the OSPF or OCRP. This will improve \nthe  transparency  and  responsiveness \nof  the  Accountability  Mechanism.  The \ncomplaint  receiving  officer  should  have \naccess  to  the  tracking  information  by \nthe  OSPF,  OCRP,  and  the  operations \ndepartments.  \n\n(ix)  Improving  awareness.  The  OSPF  and \nOCRP  should  undertake  more  system-\natic  and  effective  outreach  activities \nwithin  ADB  and  in  developing  member \ncountries. \n\nExecutive Summary\n\nviii\n\n\fExecutive Summary\n\n(x)  Enhancing  learning  and  promoting \na  culture  change.  The  Accountability \nopportunities  \nprovides \nMechanism \nfor ADB to learn lessons and do better.  \nFor \nthe  Accountability  Mechanism \nto  be  viewed  as  a  positive  tool  for \n\ndevelopment  effectiveness,  a  culture \nchange is needed. \n\nThese  changes  are  expected  to  improve  the \naccessibility,  credibility,  efficiency,  and  effective-\nness of the Accountability Mechanism. \uf03c\n\nix\n\n\f\fIntroduction\n\n1\n\n1. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  cre-\nated the Inspection Function in 1995 to provide \nan open forum for public scrutiny to ensure that \nADB  complies  with  its  operational  policies  and \nprocedures.1 Building on the Inspection Function \nand  benefiting  from  intensive  public  consul-\nintroduced  the  Accountability \ntations,  ADB \nin  2003.2  The  Accountability \nMechanism \nMechanism encompasses two mutually support-\nive  functions:  problem  solving  and  compliance \nreview.  An  effective  Accountability  Mechanism \nto  address  the  grievances  of  people  adversely \naffected  by  ADB-financed  projects  and  ensure \ncompliance  with  ADB  operational  policies  and \nprocedures is fundamental to equitable and sus-\ntainable development.\n\nthat \n\nADB \n\nensure \n\nintends \n\n2. \nthe \nto \nAccountability  Mechanism  remains  adequate \nand  effective  in  keeping  with  international  best \npractices.  At  the  43rd  Annual  Meeting  of  the \nADB Board of Governors in Tashkent, Uzbekistan \nin May 2010, the President announced that the \nADB Board of Directors and Management would \njointly  review  the  Accountability  Mechanism.3 \nA working group was established in April 2010 \ncomprising four members of the Board and the \nmanaging  director  general.  The  working  group \nfinalized  the  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  for  the \nreview  in  June  2010  in  consultation  with  the \n\nBoard,  and  engaged  two  international  exter-\nnal  experts  to  provide  independent  advice. \nAppendix 1 presents the TOR of the review.\n\n3. \nThe  objectives  of  the  review  are  to  take \nstock of the ADB experience, draw on the experi-\nences of similar mechanisms at other multilateral \nfinancial institutions, and examine the scope for \nimproving  the  Accountability  Mechanism.  The \nreview has included wide-ranging public consul-\ntations  with  a  broad  spectrum  of  stakeholders \nthrough  face-to-face  meetings,  multiple  stake-\nholder workshops, and visits to project sites. To \nsystematically respond to stakeholder comments, \nADB has produced a series of review documents: \ntwo  consultation  papers,  two  working  papers, \nand  the  final  paper.  The  consultation  papers \nwere  completed  in  February  and  June  2011, \nand the working papers were considered by the \nBoard  in  April  and  October  2011.  The  working \ngroup  has  sought  public  comments  through \na  dedicated  Accountability  Mechanism  review \nwebsite.4  Appendix  2  summarizes  the  consulta-\ntions undertaken as part of the review. \n\n4. \nThis  paper  presents  key  findings  of  the \nreview and proposes changes to strengthen the \naccessibility,  credibility,  efficiency,  and  effective-\nness of the Accountability Mechanism. \uf03c\n\n1  ADB. 1995. Establishment of an Inspection Function. Manila.\n2  ADB. 2003. Review of the Inspection Function: Establishment of a New Accountability Mechanism. Manila.\n3  The Accountability Mechanism policy was declared effective on 12 December 2003. It envisaged a review by Management \n3 years after it went into effect, i.e., by the end of 2006. The review was deferred because the Office of the Special Project \nFacilitator had only received four eligible complaints by the end of 2006, and the Compliance Review Panel had received only \ntwo requests (only one of which was eligible). Further, ADB has been undertaking policy reforms since 2005, including adopt-\ning the new Safeguard Policy Statement in 2009. This had implications for the Accountability Mechanism.\n\n4  ADB. Accountability Mechanism Review. http:// www.adb.org/AM-Review\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nEstablishment  \nand Evolution\n\nthe 1995 inspection function\n\nthe \n\n5. \nIn  December  1995,  the  ADB  Board \napproved  the  establishment  of  an  Inspection \nthird  multilateral  \nFunction.  ADB  was \ndevelopment  bank  (MDB)  to  establish  such  a \nmechanism,  following  the  Inspection  Panel  at \nthe  World  Bank  in  1993  and  the  Independent \nInvestigation  Mechanism  at  the  Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank in 1994.\n\n6. \nThe Inspection Function aimed to provide \na  forum  for  people  affected  by  ADB-assisted \nprojects  to  appeal  to  an  independent  body  for \nmatters  relating  to  ADB\u2019s  compliance  with  its \noperational policies and procedures. From 1995 \nto 2003, ADB received eight requests for inspec-\ntions, of which six were deemed ineligible. Two of \nthe requests\u2014for the Samut Prakarn Wastewater \nManagement  Project  in  Thailand5  and  for  the \nChashma Right Bank Irrigation Project (Stage III) \nin Pakistan6\u2014underwent a full inspection. \n\n7. \nThe inspection process for these two proj-\nects  raised  concerns  about  the  effectiveness  of \nthe  Inspection  Function.  In  2002  and  2003, \nADB  reviewed  the  Inspection  Function  and  \ncarried  out  extensive  external  and  internal  con-\nsultations.  The  consultations  reinforced  support \nfor  (i)  an  independent  accountability  mecha-\nnism  that  addresses  the  complaints  of  people \n\nadversely affected by ADB-assisted projects, and \n(ii)  more  problem  solving  measures  within  the \naccountability  mechanism  processes.  The  new \nmechanism  was  expected  to  enhance  ADB\u2019s  \ndevelopment  effectiveness  and  project  quality. \nThis review ushered in the new ADB Accountability \nMechanism in 2003. \n\nthe 2003 Accountability \nMechanism\n\nThe most significant change introduced in \n8. \nthe  2003  policy  was  the  establishment  of  two \nseparate  but  complementary  phases  within  the \nAccountability  Mechanism:  (i)  a  consultation \nphase,7 consisting of a special project facilitator \n(SPF)  to  respond  to  specific  problems  of  peo-\nple  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects  through \na  range  of  informal  and  flexible  methods;  and \n(ii)  a  compliance  review  phase,8  consisting  of  a \nCompliance  Review  Panel  (CRP)  to  investigate \nalleged  violations  of  ADB\u2019s  operational  policies \nand  procedures  that  have  resulted,  or  are  likely \nto result, in direct and material harm to project-\naffected people.\n\nADB  was  the  first  MDB  to  establish  an \n9. \naccountability  mechanism  that  went  beyond \nan  inspection  function  by  introducing  the  dual \ndimensions  of  problem  solving  and  compliance \n\n5  ADB. 1995.

Manila  (Loan  1146-PAK  for \n$185 million, approved on 17 December 1991).\n\n7  The 2003 policy referred to the \u201cproblem solving\u201d phase as the \u201cconsultation process\u201d to avoid unrealistic expectations that \n\nevery problem would be resolved by ADB.\n\n8  The term \u201ccompliance review\u201d is used in the 2003 policy to avoid negative associations with the term \u201cinspection.\u201d\n\n2\n\n\fEstablishment and Evolution \n\nreview for private and public sector operations.9 \nThe  Accountability  Mechanism  policy  stressed \nthat  problem  solving  should  precede  compli-\nance  review  to  enable  immediate  resolution  of  \nthe  concerns  of  project-affected  people.  At  the \nsame  time,  it  provided  complainants  with  the \noption to exit the consultation phase and request \na compliance review.\n\n10.  Dedicated  institutional  support  has  been \nprovided  to  both  the  consultation  and  compli-\nance  review  phases  to  reflect  their  distinctive  \nfeatures and needs. The SPF handles the consul-\ntation phase, assisted by the Office of the Special \nProject Facilitator (OSPF), and reports directly to \nthe  President.  The  compliance  review  phase  is \nhandled  by  three  CRP  members,  one  of  whom \nis the chair. The CRP is assisted by the Office of \nthe  Compliance  Review  Panel  (OCRP).  It  reports \n\ndirectly to the Board on all activities, except for \nsome specific activities10 for which the CRP reports \nto  the  Board  Compliance  Review  Committee \n(BCRC). Both the SPF and CRP are empowered to \nmonitor the implementation of remedial actions. \nThe Accountability Mechanism policy covers both \npublic and private sector operations. \n\ntime \n\nFrom \n\nthe  Accountability \n11. \nthe \nMechanism  became  effective \nin  December \n2003  until  the  end  of  2011,  the  OSPF  received \n39 complaints.11 Of these, 13 were found eligible  \nfor  problem  solving,  24  were  ineligible,  and  \neligibility  determination  for  2  complaints  is \nongoing.  The  CRP  received  5  requests  for  com-\npliance  review  over  the  same  period,  of  which \n4 were eligible and 1 was ineligible. Appendix 3  \nsummarizes the experience since 2003. \uf03c\n\n9  The compliance advisor ombudsman of the International Finance Corporation was the first to introduce problem solving for \nprivate sector operations. ADB was the first to introduce problem solving for both public and private sector operations. \n\n10  See para. 102 of the 2003 Accountability Mechanism policy (footnote 2) for the specific activities.\n11  The cases received by OSPF are termed \u201ccomplaints\u201d in the 2003 policy.\n\n3\n\n\f3\n\nAssessment of the \nAccountability \nMechanism\n\n12.  This  section  provides  an  assessment  of \nthe current Accountability Mechanism based on \nfeedback  from  consultations,  a  review  of  docu-\nments, and project site visits. Both strengths and \nweaknesses have been identified. \n\nstrengths\n\nPioneer in Introducing  \nthe Problem Solving Function \n\n13.  The 2003 Accountability Mechanism intro-\nduced  a  new  dimension  of  accountability:  the \nproblem  solving  function.  A  majority  of  stake-\nholders  preferred  an  Accountability  Mechanism \nconsisting  of  two  functions\u2014problem  solving  \nand  compliance  review\u2014during  the  public  \nconsultations  leading  to  the  adoption  of  the \n2003 policy. The adoption of the problem solving \nfunction  was  a  significant  innovation  that  was \nexpected to be particularly positive and beneficial \nfor  project-affected  people  by  addressing  their \nproblems.  In  addition  to  addressing  their  con-\ncerns,  development  agencies  should  empower \nproject-affected  people  to  participate  in  the  \nproblem  solving  process,  rather  than \njust  \nletting them be recipients of the inspection results. \ninternational  financial  \nFollowing  ADB,  most \ninstitutions  have  instituted  problem  solving  in \ntheir own accountability mechanisms.\n\n14.  At the same time, ADB continues to place \nhigh  importance  on  compliance  review.  The \nproblem solving and compliance review functions \ncomplement  each  other.  The  consultations  in \n2010  confirmed  that  these  dual  functions  are \nworking well and remain sound. \n\nEmphasis on Independence \nand\u00a0Effectiveness \n\n15.  The  dual  Accountability  Mechanism  func-\ntions  require  an  appropriate  institutional  setup \nto ensure their independence and effectiveness. \nThe 2003 Accountability Mechanism policy stipu-\nlates  that  the  CRP  should  be  independent  from  \nManagement to ensure the credibility of its inves-\ntigation of alleged ADB noncompliance with its \noperational  policies  and  procedures.  Therefore, \nunder the policy, the CRP reports directly to the \nBoard except on certain activities where it reports \nto  the  BCRC  (footnote  10).  The  CRP  members \nhave nonrenewable terms of 5 years. This is con-\nsidered  appropriate  for  drawing  on  fresh  expe-\nrience  and  minimizing  external  influence.  Thus, \nthe CRP operates with a high degree of indepen-\ndence from Management. \n\n16.  The 2003 Accountability Mechanism policy \nrequires that the SPF be independent from oper-\nations.  The  SPF  reports  directly  to  the  President \nand  should  not  be  involved  in  the  formulation, \nprocessing,  or  implementation  of  any  project. \nThis  arrangement  is  considered  appropriate  for \nstriking  a  balance  between  (i)  the  need  for  an \nobjective and detached perspective on a project, \nand (ii) the need for sufficient knowledge of and \nexperience with ADB operations. \n\n17.  Striking  this  balance  suggests  that  the \nconsultation  phase  should  be  located  under \nManagement for two reasons. First, the problem \nsolving  process  is  not  for  determining  liability \nor apportioning blame. Rather, it is designed to \naddress genuine complaints about ADB-assisted \ninformal,  consensus-based \nprojects \n\nthrough \n\n4\n\n\fAssessment of the Accountability Mechanism\n\nmethods.  People  who  believe  they  have  been \nadversely  affected  by  an  ADB-assisted  project \ncan  use  the  consultation  process  regardless  of \nwhether  ADB  operational  policies  and  proce-\ndures  have  been  complied  with.12  Second,  the \nSPF needs to work closely with staff in operations \ndepartments to solve problems. By reporting to \nthe President, the OSPF has an appropriate level \nof independence and is sufficiently empowered, \nbut is not isolated from operations staff. \n\n18.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  demar-\ncates  problem  solving  and  compliance  review  as \nseparate matters. Therefore, different institutional \nsetups  have  been  put  in  place  for  the  two  func-\ntions. ADB\u2019s experience since 2003 suggests that \nthe institutional setup is sound and suitable for \nmaintaining  the  appropriate  balance  between \nthe  independence  and  effectiveness  of  the \nAccountability Mechanism.\n\nMonitoring Mandate Enhancing \nCredibility \n\n19.  The 2003 Accountability Mechanism policy \nempowers the SPF and CRP to monitor the imple-\nmentation of remedial actions. The CRP and SPF \nproduce annual monitoring reports that describe \nthe  implementation  of  remedial  actions.  These \nreports are disclosed to the public. The SPF\u2019s and \nCRP\u2019s monitoring roles strengthen the credibility \nof the Accountability Mechanism. \n\nGood Practice on Accessibility\n\n20.  The  processes  in  the  2003  Accountability \nMechanism  policy  conform  to \ninternational \ngood practices. The procedures for filing a com-\nplaint  are  clearly  articulated  in  the  policy,  the \nOperations Manual, the ADB website, brochures, \nand other OSPF and OCRP publications. Requests \nfor  consultation  and  compliance  review  can  be \n(i)  brief;  (ii)  written  in  English  or  in  any  official \nor  national  language  of  a  developing  member \n\ncountry  (DMC);  and  (iii)  submitted  by  mail,  fax, \ne-mail,  or  hand  delivery  to  ADB  headquarters \nor  resident  missions.  The  identity  of  complain-\nants is kept confidential, if they so request. The \nrequesters are encouraged to cite specific policy  \nviolations  in  describing  a  request,  but  that  is  \nnot mandatory. \n\n21.  The  OSPF  and  OCRP  have  pursued  sys-\ntematic  outreach  activities  and  consultations \nwith  project  beneficiaries  and  project-affected \npeople, governments, nongovernment organiza-\ntions (NGOs), the private sector, and the public. \nThey  have  regularly  conducted  training  courses \non  the  Accountability  Mechanism  to  improve \nstaff  capacity  in  ADB.  The  internet  is  instru-\nmental  in  disseminating  information  about  the \nAccountability  Mechanism.  A  joint  OCRP  and \nOSPF  outreach  strategy  was  adopted  in  2010. \nADB  has  also  approved  technical  assistance \nfunding of $225,000 for the OCRP to pilot a new \noutreach  program.13  From  2009  to  2011,  the \nnumber of complaints received by OSPF and CRP \nincreased,  which  may  partly  reflect  an  increas-\ning awareness of the Accountability Mechanism \nthrough these efforts.\n\nVertical Complementarity:  \nThe Problem Solving\u2013Compliance \nContinuum\n\n22.  The  continuum  of  problem  prevention, \nproblem  solving,  and  compliance  is  a  strength \nof  the  2003  Accountability  Mechanism.  ADB\u2019s \nphilosophy  is  that  problem  prevention  and  \ncompliance  should  be  maximized  in  ADB  oper-\nations.  Once  problems  and  noncompliance \noccur, they should be addressed promptly at the \noperational level. \n\n23.  During  the  design  and  appraisal  stage, \nall  projects  undergo  due  diligence  on  mul-\ntiple  fronts,  such  as  technical,  financial,  eco-\nnomic,  social,  safeguards,  and  governance. \n\n12  The SPF\u2019s role is limited to ADB-related issues concerning ADB-assisted projects.\n13  ADB.  2010.

The Board reviews \neach proposed project based on the report and \nrecommendation of the President. \n\n24.  During  implementation,  a  bottom\u2013up, \nmultilevel mechanism is in place to solve prob-\nlems  and  ensure  compliance,  consisting  of  \n\ngrievance  handling  mechanisms  at  the  proj-\nect  level,  operations  departments,  and  the \nAccountability Mechanism (see figure). \n\n25.  Most  of  the  grievances  are  handled  at \nthe  project  level  by  the  executing  agencies \nand  implementing  agencies.  In  the  Southern \nTransport Development Project, for example, the  \nGovernment  of  Sri  Lanka  established  a  Land \nAcquisition  and  Resettlement  Committee  and \nSuper  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement \nCommittee. Most affected people resolved their \nproblems  through  these  mechanisms.  Research \nby  the  Centre  for  Poverty  Analysis  in  Sri  Lanka \nfound that the project made remarkable progress \nin  addressing  grievances.14  The  ADB  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009)  requires  the  establish-\nment  of  project-level  grievance  redress  mecha-\nnisms  to  respond  quickly  to  project-affected \npeople.

ADB  staff \nand  executing  agencies  have  progressively \nbecome  more  familiar  with  the  safeguard  poli-\ncies and more conscious of preventing problems \nand  ensuring  compliance.  They  recognize  that \ndealing  with  problems  and  compliance  issues \nafter they occur is suboptimal compared to pre-\nventing the problems and ensuring compliance \nin  the  first  place.  Moreover,  solving  problems \nearly is better than delaying their resolution. All \noperations  departments  have  dedicated  safe-\nguard  teams,  and  some  have  set  up  dedicated \nsafeguard units. Numerous training sessions on \nsafeguards  have  been  held  in  ADB  and  DMCs \neach  year.  When  problems  occur,  operations \ndepartments  are  ADB\u2019s  first  point  of  entry  in \naddressing them. \n\n27.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  augments \nthese existing systems by providing a \u201clast resort\u201d \nprocess  for  dealing  with  problems  and  compli-\nance issues that were not prevented or solved at \nthe  project  and  operational  levels.  Research  on \naccountability  mechanisms  highlights  the  need \nfor multiple mechanisms within an institution to \naddress the concerns of project-affected people.  \nThe ADB system conforms to this principle. Early \nproblem prevention, problem solving, and com-\npliance are beneficial for affected people, DMCs, \nand ADB. Where problems occur, ADB\u2019s philoso-\nphy is to respond promptly and effectively at the  \nproject and operational levels. Complaints to the \nSPF  and  CRP  should  only  occur  as  exceptions.  \nThe  Accountability  Mechanism  has  been,  and \nshould  continue  to  be,  the  last  resort  for  both \nproblem solving and compliance review. \n\nHorizontal Complementarity: \nThe Accountability Mechanism \nas an Integral Part of ADB\u2019s \nCompliance Systems\n\nlearning  systems.  It  is  designed  to  complement \nthese systems. \n\n29.  To  address  concerns  of  project-affected \npeople, the Accountability Mechanism is set up \nas a demand-driven mechanism. Project-affected \npeople report problems and alleged noncompli-\nance.  ADB  works  with  stakeholders  to  resolve \nproblems  and  address  noncompliance  that  has \ncaused, or is likely to cause, direct and material \nharm to project-affected people. \n\ndevelopment \n\neffectiveness, \n\n30.  To  ensure  lessons  are  learned  and  to \nenhance \nthe \nIndependent Evaluation Department (IED) evalu-\nates  activities  to  help  the  Board  of  Directors, \nManagement, and decision makers in DMCs know \nwhether expected outcomes have been achieved. \nIED\u2019s evaluations cover all aspects of ADB oper-\nations,  including  policies,  strategies,  projects, \npractices,  and  procedures.  These  evaluations  \nemphasize  effective  feedback  on  performance \nand  use  of  lessons  identified  to  improve  the \ndevelopment  effectiveness  of  ADB  operations. \nOne  dimension  of  the  evaluation  is  compliance  \nwith  ADB  policies  during  and  after  project  \nimplementation,  irrespective  of  alleged  harm. \nIED reviews are driven by ADB\u2019s own initiatives as \nwell as by the demands of stakeholders. \n\n31.  To  ensure  that  ADB  resources  are  used  \neconomically,  efficiently,  and  for  the  intended \npurposes,  the  Office  of  the  Auditor  General  \nregularly  audits  ADB\u2019s  financial,  administra-\ntive,  and  information  systems.  The  Office  of \nAnticorruption  and  Integrity  deals  with  alleged \nfraud  and  corruption  in  activities  financed, \nadministered, or supported by ADB. It also pro-\nactively conducts reviews related to procurement \nto  reduce  the  risk  of  corrupt  and  fraudulent \npractices in ADB projects. The Central Operations \nServices  Office  focuses  on  procurement  quality  \nassurance.  The  Office  of  Risk  Management  is \nresponsible for the overall management of ADB\u2019s \ncredit, market, and operational risks.\n\nthe  Accountability \n28.  The  design  of \nMechanism  recognizes  that  ADB  already  has \nseveral  well-developed  audit,  evaluation,  and \n\nIn  addition, \n\n32. \nthe  Board  has  various  \ncommittees  on  oversight:  Audit,  Budget, \n\n7\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nCompliance Review, Development Effectiveness, \nand Ethics. \n\n33.  All  these  mechanisms  are  designed  to \nensure  that  ADB  operations  are  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  approved  operational  policies \nand procedures, and deliver the intended results. \nADB\u2019s  philosophy  is  that  accountability  should \nbe  mainstreamed  across  all  operations  and \nactivities.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  plays \nan important and unique role as a focused and \ndemand-driven  mechanism  for  project-affected \npeople and for development effectiveness. \n\nDelivering Effective Results \n\n34.  Consultation  phase.  Of  the  13  eligible \ncomplaints received by the OSPF between 2004 \nand  2011,  7  were  fully  or  partially  resolved, \n2 were withdrawn, 1 was not resolved, and 3 are \nstill undergoing consultation and monitoring of \nimplementation of agreements. The 2 withdrawn \nand  1  unresolved  complaints,  as  well  as  1  par-\ntially  resolved  and  1  resolved  complaint,  were \nsubmitted to the CRP.15 \n\n35. \nFor  the  ineligible  complaints,  the  OSPF \ninformed the complainants how to pursue their \ngrievances through the operations departments; \nthey then resolved many of the issues after proper \ncontacts were made. This is a significant aspect \nof  OSPF  operations. The OSPF  has  assumed  an \ninformal  role  in  connecting  complainants  with \nthe  appropriate  ADB  staff.  In  all  the  cases,  the \nOSPF informed the complainants that they can \ncome  back  to  OSPF  if  they  are  still  dissatisfied \nafter working with the operations departments. \nWhen a complaint is found ineligible, the OSPF \ninforms the complainants that they can submit \na request to the CRP. Thus, in addition to directly \naddressing the problems of affected people, the \n\nconsultation  phase  has  also  provided  a  useful \nchannel  to  link  them  with  operations  depart-\nments and the CRP. Appendix 4 summarizes the \neligible complaints dealt with by the OSPF. \n\n36.  Compliance  review  phase.  Since  2004, \nthe CRP has conducted a compliance review on \nthe  Sri  Lanka  Southern  Transport  Development \nProject  and  monitored  the  implementation  of \nthe Inspection Panel\u2019s recommendations on the \nChashma Right Bank Irrigation Project (Stage III). \nThe implementation of the recommendations on \nboth of these projects was satisfactory. \n\ninto  compliance.  Consultations \n\n37.  On  the  Southern  Transport  Development \nProject,  the  CRP  concluded  in  its  fifth  and  final \nannual monitoring report that ADB had complied \nwith all the recommendations with the exception \nof  one  that  had  been  superseded  by  events.16 \nThe CRP played an important role in bringing the  \nproject \nin \nSri Lanka indicated that the CRP\u2019s work helped to \naddress the problems faced by the affected people \nand  facilitated  the  government\u2019s  improvement \nof its own systems. On the Chashma Right Bank \nIrrigation Project (Stage III), the CRP found that  \nby  2009  ADB  had  fulfilled  24  of  the  29  Board-\napproved  recommendations  and  had  made  \nsufficient  progress  on  the  4  partially  complied- \nwith  recommendations.  One  recommendation \nwas  superseded  by  events  and  could  not  be  \ncomplied  with.  Appendix  5  summarizes  the \nrequests dealt with by the CRP. \n\nHigh Degree of Transparency \n\n38.  The  ADB  Accountability  Mechanism  has \nmaintained  a  high  degree  of  transparency  in \ninformation  disclosure,  while  ensuring  that \nthe  required  confidentiality  is  also  met.  Both \nthe  OSPF  and  OCRP  have  proactively  posted \n\n15  The  withdrawn  cases  were  the  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Project  in  Nepal  and  the  Visayas  Base-Load  Power  Development  \nProject in the Philippines. The request for compliance review on the Melamchi Water Supply Project was found ineligible, \nwhile the request on the Visayas Base-Load Power Development Project was eligible. The unresolved case was the Sri Lanka \nSouthern Transport Development Project and the partially resolved case was the People\u2019s Republic of China: Fuzhou Environ-\nmental Improvement Project. The complaint on the CAREC Transport Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road), Project 2, in the \nKyrgyz Republic was fully resolved. All these 5 cases were submitted to the CRP. \n\n16  ADB. 2011.

A  review  of  the \naccountability mechanism websites across differ-\nent  development  institutions  suggests  that  the \nADB Accountability Mechanism compares favor-\nably in terms of its comprehensiveness and clarity \nof disclosed information.\n\n42.  Staff, Management, and the Board increas-\ningly see the Accountability Mechanism as a tool \nfor ADB to respond positively to public scrutiny. \nThe  Accountability  Mechanism  helps  ADB  to \nlearn lessons and improve its project quality. \n\nAccountability as a Learning Mechanism \n\nweaknesses \n\n39.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  has  \ncontributed to learning by ADB as well as DMCs. \nThe  findings  of  both  the  OSPF  and  OCRP  are \nwidely disseminated through their websites. As a \npart of enhanced learning efforts, the OSPF and \nOCRP  have  started  to  provide  training  courses \nto staff and undertake more outreach activities  \nin DMCs. \n\n40.  The 2003 Accountability Mechanism policy \nemphasizes  the  role  of  the  OSPF  in  strengthen-\ning the internal problem solving function of the \noperations departments. The OSPF has developed \nguidelines  for  establishing  and  implementing \ngrievance redress mechanisms in various DMCs. \nThe  OSPF  also  developed  a  project  complaint \ntracking system in 2009 together with the Office \nof Information Systems and Technology and the  \nIndia  Resident  Mission.17  This  system,  which \nis  gradually  being  adopted  by  other  resident  \nmissions,  provides  a  user-friendly  way  of  \ntracking complaints.\n\n41.  To facilitate learning, the OCRP established \nan  internet-based  platform  for  people  working  \non  different  accountability  mechanisms \nto \nexchange views.18 It also established a system to \ntrack the implementation of remedial actions. In \nSri Lanka, implementation of the ADB safeguard \npolicy  in  the  Southern  Transport  Development \nProject  led  to  the  establishment  of  government \nsafeguard  and  grievance  redress  systems,  and \nthe compliance review enhanced the implemen-\ntation of these systems.\n\n43.  The  assessment  has  also \nidentified \nsome  weaknesses  in  the  2003  Accountability \nMechanism. \n\nLack of Direct Access to the Compliance \nReview Function\n\n44.  Under the 2003 Accountability Mechanism \npolicy, complainants are required to start with the \nconsultation phase. The 2003 policy adopted this \nsequential  approach  to  address  problems  faced \nby project-affected people before addressing the \nquestion  of  ADB\u2019s  compliance.  Project-affected \npeople  were  thought  to  be  more  interested  in \nhaving their complaints addressed first. The 2003 \nAccountability  Mechanism  policy  also  provides \noptions for complainants to exit the consultation \nprocess and request a compliance review. \n\n45.  The requirement to start with the consul-\ntation  process  has  generated  two  issues.  First, \nsome  stakeholders,  especially  NGOs,  argue  that \nthe OSPF has blocked the access of complainants \nto the compliance review. Second, according to \nsome  stakeholders,  this  requirement  may  have \nprolonged the process for people who wanted to \naccess compliance review in the first place. ADB \nneeds  to  consider  giving  complainants  direct \naccess to the compliance review function. \n\n46.  Under the 2003 Accountability Mechanism \npolicy,  complainants  can  exit  the  consultation \nphase  and  proceed  to  the  compliance  review \nat  various  predefined  points,  one  of  which  is \n\n17  ADB. 2010.

The network is available on http://iamnet.adb.org\n\n9\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nwhen  the  complainants  have  serious  concerns \nabout  compliance  issues  during  step  7  of  the \nconsultation  process,  entitled  \u201cimplementa-\ntion of the course of action.\u201d At this stage, the \ncomplainants  can  request  a  parallel  compliance \nreview  (paras.  42  and  88,  2003  Accountability \nMechanism  policy,  footnote  2).  However,  the \n2003 policy is unclear on what \u201cimplementation \nof the course of action\u201d means. This lack of clar-\nity has led to confusion in practice. The transition \npoint between the consultation and compliance \nreview processes should be clarified. \n\nNeed for a Single Entry Point \n\n47. \nIf project-affected people are to be able to \ndirectly access either the problem solving function \nor the compliance review function, ADB needs to \nestablish a single entry point where complainants \ncan easily access the Accountability Mechanism. \nThis  entry  point  should  be  both  credible  and \nefficient.\n\nUncertainty on Site Visits \n\n48.  Site  visits  to  borrowing  countries  by  the \nCRP are controversial.19 In both internal and exter-\nnal  consultations,  strong  views  were  expressed \nthat  site  visits  are  essential  for  the  effectiveness \nof  compliance  review,  stakeholder  participation, \nand independent verification of facts and alleged \npolicy  violations.  As  a  result,  some  stakeholders  \nhave  suggested  that  ADB  insist  on  site  visits  in \nthe  mechanism;  otherwise,  they  have  argued, \nthe  Accountability  Mechanism  process  would \nbe  compromised.  Some  of  these  stakeholders  \nsuggested that site visits and general cooperation \nwith the CRP should be included in the conditions \nof loan agreements for all projects. DMC govern-\nments,  however,  have  argued  that  ADB  has  no \nbasis  to  mandate  site  visits  through  loan  agree-\nments  because  the  compliance  review  is  about \nADB\u2019s  compliance  with  its  own  policies  and  \nprocedures, not about a borrower\u2019s breach of any \nobligations, which are dealt with separately. \n\n49.  The 2003 Accountability Mechanism policy \nrequires  obtaining  a  borrowing  country\u2019s  con-\nsent  for  a  site  visit.  The  policy  (para.  56,  2003 \nAccountability  Mechanism  policy,  footnote  2) \nstates  the  following:  \u201cIf,  as  many  stakeholders \nbelieve,  site  visits  are  important  to  the  compli-\nance  review  process,  then  a  sensible  approach \nis  to  enable  site  visits  to  take  place  in  consul-\ntation  with  the  borrowing  country.  When  the \nBoard  approves  the  proposed  mechanism,  the \npolicy and procedures should assume the good \nfaith cooperation of all parties in the compliance \nreview  process,  including  the  borrowing  coun-\ntry. This would also contribute to a collaborative \nspirit of improving ADB accountability and policy \ncompliance. Seeking prior consent of the borrow-\ning country, under an operating assumption that \nsuch  consent  would  be  routinely  given,  would \nbe preferable to the heavy-handed approach of \nincluding conditions in the loan agreement.\u201d\n\n50.  The  advantage  of  the  approach  in  the \n2003  policy  is  its  clarity  on  the  requirement  of \nthe  borrowing  country\u2019s  consent.  This  require-\nment is also consistent with those of other MDB \naccountability  mechanisms.  The  disadvantage \nis  that  the  policy  is  silent  on  the  process  and \nresponsibility  for  obtaining  the  consent  from \na  borrowing  country.  Further,  it  lacks  clarity  on \nhow  ADB  should  deal  with  a  situation  where \na  borrowing  country  declines  a  request  for  a  \nsite visit. \n\n51.  The  opinions  on  site  visits  are  deeply \ndivided. ADB  needs  to  address  issues  surround-\ning  site  visits  by  drawing  on  the  extensive  \nconsultations  it  conducted  and  the  experiences \nof ADB and other MDBs. \n\nNeed to Enhance the Independence \nand Effectiveness of the Compliance \nReview Panel\n\n52.  The CRP\u2019s independence can be enhanced \nin several areas. First, CRP members are appointed \n\n19  In this document, the term \u201cborrower\u201d includes grant recipients, and the term \u201cloan\u201d includes grants. \n\n10\n\n\fAssessment of the Accountability Mechanism\n\nby the Board, but on the President\u2019s recommen-\ndation. Second, a senior staff member is assigned \nas the secretary of the OCRP. Public consultations \nindicate  that  some  stakeholders  see  the  OCRP \nsecretary  as  a  representative  of  Management. \nThird,  the  CRP  does  not  have  a  formal  work  \nprogramming  and  budgeting  process,  reducing \nthe opportunities for systematic work planning.\n\n53.  The  effectiveness  of  the  CRP  should  also \nbe improved. The CRP has little interaction with \nManagement  and  staff.  Unlike  with  the  World \nBank\u2019s Inspection Panel, ADB\u2019s compliance review \nphase does not give Management the opportu-\nnity to respond before the eligibility of a request \nis determined. The borrower is also not given the \nopportunity to respond to the draft CRP report, \neven though it is primarily responsible for imple-\nmenting remedial actions. This gap can diminish \ngoodwill and undermine the effectiveness of the \nAccountability Mechanism. CRP members are not \nevaluated,  potentially  reducing  the  accountabil-\nity  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism.  The  BCRC \nalso has little interaction with the CRP, which may \nreduce  appropriate  Board  oversight  and  neces-\nsary dialogue. \n\nNeed to Clarify the Roles of the \nCompliance Review Panel \n\n54.  Under the 2003 Accountability Mechanism \npolicy, the CRP has been mandated to make rec-\nommendations  to  bring  projects  into  compli-\nance.  Since  2003,  however,  the  CRP  has  made \nbroad  recommendations  on  how  to  bring  a \nproject into compliance, while Management has \ndeveloped remedial actions in consultation with \nthe  borrower.  This  policy  stipulation  and  prac-\ntice have created three problems. First, the CRP \nrecommendations  are  sometimes  too  specific \nand  detailed,  blurring  the  mandates  between \n\ncompliance review and project design and imple-\nmentation by operations departments.20 Second, \nthe  CRP  recommendations  are  sometimes  too \nbroad, touching upon the adequacy and suitabil-\nity of ADB policies and procedures, even though \nthe  2003  Accountability  Mechanism  states  that \nthis  should  not  be  part  of  compliance  review \n(para. 72, 2003 Accountability Mechanism policy, \nfootnote 2).21 Third, the CRP has not been given \nan  opportunity  to  comment  on  Management\u2019s \nremedial actions, limiting the CRP\u2019s sharing of its \nknowledge  on  the  project.  The  role  of  the  CRP \nneeds to be clarified. \n\nLack of Clear and Predictable \nCutoff\u00a0Dates\n\n55.  The  current  cutoff  date  for  filing  a  com-\nplaint  is  the  issuance  of  the  project  completion \nreport (PCR). Using the PCR as a cutoff date has \ncreated  problems  since  this  date  is  uncertain. \nPCRs are issued 1\u20132 years after project comple-\ntion,  but  the  exact  dates  are  difficult  to  know \nin advance. In practice, the time frame in which \nthe PCRs are issued varies significantly. The cutoff \ndates need to be more predictable. \n\nEfficiency Improvement Possibilities \n\n56.  Time.  For  the  consultation  phase,  the \naverage time for determining eligibility is about \n47 days. For eligible cases, the average time from \nreceiving  a  complaint  to  starting  to  implement \nthe course of action has been about 170 days. For \nthe  compliance  review  phase,  the  average  time \nfrom  receiving  a  request  to  the  CRP  informing  \nthe  requesters  of  the  eligibility  was  about \n20  days.  Only  2  requests  have  gone  through \nthe  full  compliance  review  process\u2014it  took  an \naverage of 367 days from receiving the requests \nto  informing  the  requesters  about  the  Board\u2019s \n\n20  For  example,  in  the  Chashma  Right  Bank  Irrigation  Project  (Stage  III),  it  was  recommended  that  ADB  discuss  with  the  \nGovernment of Pakistan the possibility of extending the project completion date, utilizing surplus loan proceeds to address \nthe problems, and ensuring long-term funding (i.e., for at least 5 years) for the implementation of a full environmental \nmanagement plan.\n\n21  For example, in the case of the Sri Lanka Southern Transport Development Project, the CRP recommended that ADB develop \nadditional guidance for inclusion in the handbook on resettlement (ADB. 1998. Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good \nPractice. Manila).\n\n11\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\ndecision on the CRP review report.22 Other MDB \naccountability mechanisms also customarily take \nmore than a year to complete the problem solv-\ning or compliance review process. \n\n57.  The \nlong  duration  of  Accountability \nMechanism processes may be attributed primarily \nto two factors. First, the processes are complex. \nField  consultations  indicate  that  project-affected \npeople  still  have  difficulty  filing  complaints. \nSecond, consultation and compliance review are \nintensive processes that often require hiring medi-\nators or experts. The processes are initiated from \nManila and field visits can only be carried out peri-\nodically. During the site visits to the Community \nEmpowerment for Rural Development Project23 in \nIndonesia, local communities expressed a strong \ndesire to use the ADB resident mission to expedite \nproblem solving. \n\n58.  The CRP has set its monitoring time frame \nat  5  years  for  every  project,  even  though  the \n2003  Accountability  Mechanism  policy  and  the \nOperations  Manual  (section  L1)  have  not  pre-\nscribed  such  a  time  frame.  This  one-size-fits-all \napproach demands time and resources from the \naffected  people,  DMCs,  and  ADB.  A  more  flex-\nible time frame tailored to each project would be \nmore efficient. \n\n59.  Costs.  The  costs  associated  with  the \nAccountability  Mechanism  include  the  direct \noperating costs and indirect costs of staff time, \nthe  potential  increases  in  costs  of  implement-\ning  projects,  and  the  costs  to  affected  people. \nADB shoulders the operating costs. In 2009, the \noperating  cost  was  $2.1  million.24  Because  the \nAccountability  Mechanism  is  demand  driven, \nthe  operating  costs  vary  from  year  to  year. \nSome costs have to be incurred to maintain the \nAccountability  Mechanism  regardless  of  the \nnumber  of  complaints  received.  However,  ADB \n\nneeds  to  ensure  that  adequate  resources  are \navailable  for  the  Accountability  Mechanism  to \nrespond  effectively  to  the  requests  of  project-\naffected people, while not putting in place large \nexcess  capacity  that  leads  to  inefficient  use  of \nscarce resources. \n\n60.  A  common  concern  among  the  DMCs \nis  that  the  Accountability  Mechanism  causes  \nsignificant costs above the normal project imple-\nmentation and compliance costs that they must \nbear. DMCs have identified the following possible \ncosts  related  to  the  Accountability  Mechanism: \n(i) delays in project implementation, which lead \nto cost escalation, cost overruns, higher commit-\nment charges, and postponed benefits while the \ncountry repays the loan and interest as originally \nscheduled; (ii) changes of scope that require more \nfunding  and  make  project  design  sub optimal \nfor  the  beneficiaries  as  a  whole;  (iii)  higher  \ncompensation  above \nthe  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  requirements;  (iv)  higher  administra-\ntive costs; and (v) nonfinancial costs such as risk \naversion  by  ADB  to  avoid  needed  but  complex \nprojects, lack of innovation, and the tendency to \nfocus  on  compliance  rather  than  development \nresults. For example, the Government of Sri Lanka \nestimated the costs related to the Accountability \nMechanism \nTransport \nDevelopment  Project  at  about  $45.0  million \nbecause  of  delays  in  project  implementation \nand  cost  escalations.  In  the  Chashma  project, \nthe PCR indicated that $12.5 million of the total \nADB  loan  was  disbursed  for  implementation  of \nthe  remedial  action  plan.  DMCs  expressed  their \nuneasiness  in  bearing  the  costs  resulting  from \nADB\u2019s  noncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  operational \npolicies and procedures. \n\nSouthern \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nthe  costs \n\n61.  However, \nthe \nAccountability  Mechanism  processes  must  be \nbalanced  against  the  potential  benefits  that  \n\nincurred \n\nin \n\n22  The duration from receiving the request to providing information to the requesters about the Board\u2019s decision was 223 days \n\nfor the Southern Transport Development Project and 511 days for the Fuzhou project.\n\n23  ADB. 2000.

Manila (Loan 1765-INO \nfor $115 million, approved on 19 October 2000).\n\n24  The operating costs include salary, benefits, relocation, consultants, business travel, and representation.\n\n12\n\n\fAssessment of the Accountability Mechanism\n\nthe mechanism generates in solving problems of  \nproject-affected  people,  ensuring  ADB\u2019s  com-\npliance  with  its  policies  and  procedures,  and  \ncontributing  to  the  development  effectiveness \nof  ADB  operations  (paras.  28\u201337).  ADB  needs \nto  be  fully  aware  of  the  costs  and  demonstrate \nthe benefits of the Accountability Mechanism to \nensure  its  credibility  and  ownership  by  DMCs. \nBetter  understanding  of  the  benefits  and  costs \nof the Accountability Mechanism will also help in  \ndesigning and implementing an effective policy. \n\n62.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  processes \nalso  require  the  project-affected  people  to \nspend  time  and  resources.  A  protracted  process \ndemands extra time and effort, and puts a burden \non their work and daily life. The transaction costs \nto address the problems faced by project-affected \npeople  need  to  be  minimized.  From  the  outset, \nADB  should  make  the  utmost  efforts  to  ensure \nproblem prevention, problem solving, and com-\npliance.  If  problems  and  noncompliance  occur, \nthey should be addressed as quickly as possible.\n\nInadequate Awareness and Tracking \n\n63.  Consultations  revealed  limited  awareness \nof  the  Accountability  Mechanism,  especially \namong local communities. Reaching people with \nlimited internet access remains a huge challenge. \nAwareness  among  staff  also  needs  to  be  con-\ntinually enhanced through in-house training and \nawareness-raising activities. \n\n64.  While the cases dealt with by the SPF and \nCRP  have  been  well  tracked,  no  system  is  in \nplace to track the ineligible complaints that the \nOSPF  forwarded  to  the  operations  departments \nbecause  the  complainants  did  not  make  prior \ngood  faith  efforts  to  resolve  the  problems  with \nthe  operations  departments.  This  information \ngap should be addressed. \n\nInsufficient Learning\n\nthe  Board \n65.  Staff,  Management,  and \nincreasingly  see  the  Accountability  Mechanism \nas a tool for ADB to respond positively to public \n\nscrutiny and learn how the organization can do \nbetter. However, the perception that the compli-\nance  review  is  adversarial  remains.  More  inter-\nactions  are  needed  among  the  SPF,  CRP,  staff, \nManagement,  and  DMCs  for  constructive  dia-\nlogue and learning. Further positive interactions \nwill  change  the  perception  of  the  compliance \nreview from an adversarial process to a positive \ninstrument for learning and development. \n\nToo Few Compliance Review\u00a0Requests?\n\n66.  The OSPF received 39 complaints between \n2004 and 2011, while the CRP received 5 requests \nover the same period. Some stakeholders argued \nthat the CRP received too few requests. However, \nthe  limited  recourse  to  compliance  review  is  in \nline  with  the  experience  of  other  MDBs.  The \nWorld Bank Inspection Panel investigated 33 eli-\ngible  requests  from  1994  to  2011,  an  average \nof fewer than 2 eligible cases a year for an insti-\ntution whose portfolio is nearly 4 times the size \nof ADB\u2019s. The Office of the Compliance Advisor \nOmbudsman  of \nInternational  Finance \nCorporation  and  the  Multilateral  Investment \nGuarantee  Agency  received  127  complaints \nfrom  2000  to  2010,  but  only  8  went  through \nthe  full  compliance  audit  process.  The  African \nDevelopment  Bank  has  received  7  cases  since \n2007,  of  which  2  were  eligible  for  compliance \nreview. Appendix 6 presents the number of cases \nreceived by different accountability mechanisms.\n\nthe \n\n67.  Consultations suggested various reasons for \nthe low number of compliance review requests at \nADB. A major reason is that a bottom\u2013up, multi-\nlevel problem prevention and solving mechanism \nhas  been  in  place  (paras.  22\u201327).  Most  of  the \ngrievances are handled at the project and oper-\national  levels.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  is \nthe  last  resort  for  problem  solving  and  compli-\nance  review,  and  complaints  submitted  to  it \nshould occur as exceptions. However, awareness \nof the Accountability Mechanism is also limited, \ncontributing  to  the  low  number  of  requests.  In \naddition, the Accountability Mechanism process \nis  complicated.  Some  stakeholders  believe  that \nthe  requirement  that  affected  people  start  at \n\n13\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nthe consultation stage\u2014before they can request \nfor  compliance  review\u2014may  also  have  reduced \nrecourse to compliance review. \n\nissues related to awareness, accessibility, and the \nlack of direct access to the CRP. \n\n68.  Thus,  the  reasons  for  the  low  number  of \ncompliance review cases are mixed. ADB needs to \nstrengthen the positive aspect of effective prob-\nlem  solving  and  compliance  at  the  project  and \noperations  department  levels,  while  addressing \n\n69.  Appendix 7 summarizes the Accountability \nMechanism\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and poten-\ntial  areas  for  improvement,  reflecting  the  four \ndesirable  attributes  of  an  accountability  mech-\nanism:  accessibility,  credibility,  efficiency,  and \neffectiveness.25 \uf03c\n\n25  E.

This  section  outlines  major  changes  to \naddress the weaknesses identified in Section 3.\n\nenabling Direct Access to the \ncompliance Review function\n\n71.  The  working  group  that  reviewed  ADB\u2019s \nAccountability  Mechanism  considered  several \noptions to address perceptions and issues related \nto the current requirement that project-affected \npeople must start with the consultation phase.26 \nBased  on  careful  consideration  of  the  pros  and \ncons of these options, the working group recom-\nmends that complainants be given direct access \nto the compliance review function.   \n\n72.  Under  this  approach,  complainants  may \nchoose  whether  to  start  with  the  consultation \nor  the  compliance  review  phase.  Further,  they \ncan  exit  the  consultation  phase  and  request \ncompliance  review  at  any  time  during  the  pro-\ncesses. Complainants can also file for compliance \nreview upon the completion of the consultation \nprocess  when  all  the  parties  have  reached  an \nagreement on the remedial actions, or when the \nSPF concludes that no agreement on the reme-\ndial actions can be reached. Consistent with the \n2003  Accountability  Mechanism  policy,  com-\nplainants  also  have  the  opportunity  to  request \na compliance review during the implementation \nand monitoring of remedial actions if they have \nserious  concerns  on  compliance  issues  (para. \n42,  2003  Accountability  Mechanism  policy, \nfootnote 2). \n\n73.  Complainants  can  only  switch  from  the \ncompliance review to the consultation process if \nthe CRP finds the request for compliance review \nineligible.  The  reason  for  this  restriction  is  that \nproblem  solving  would  have  limited  usefulness \nafter  the  compliance  review.  The  CRP\u2019s  find-\nings  may  pinpoint  the  problems  that  will  then \nbe  addressed  by  the  operations  departments. \nAlternatively, even if the CRP finds that ADB has \ncomplied with its operational policies and proce-\ndures,  operations  departments  can  still  address \nproblems as part of the project implementation \nprocess.  To  facilitate  complainants\u2019  informed \ndecisions  in  choosing  problem  solving  or  com-\npliance review, a basic information packet and a \ntemplate  should  be  developed  and  provided  to \ncomplainants as soon as they seek access to the \nAccountability Mechanism. \n\nestablishing a single entry Point\n\n74. \nIf  project-affected  people  are  given  direct \naccess  to  both  the  consultation  and  compli-\nance  review  phases,  ADB  needs  to  establish \na  single  entry  point  to  receive  all  complaints. \nThis  focal  point,  the  complaint  receiving  officer \n(CRO), should serve as a first contact for project-\naffected  people  when  they  want  to  access  the \nAccountability Mechanism. \n\n75.  The  single  point  of  entry  should  be  effi-\ncient,  impartial,  and  capable  of  dealing  with \nconfidentiality  requirements  by  complainants. \nTo  ensure  that  the  CRO  has  these  qualities,  the \n\n26  For  the  options  on  the  direct  access  and  other  issues,  see  ADB.  2011.  Review  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism.  Second  \n\nworking paper. Manila. http://www.adb.org/AM-Review/\n\n15\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nworking group recommends that the OSPF and \nOCRP jointly engage a CRO in a way similar to the \nengagement of the executive secretary of ADB\u2019s \nAdministrative Tribunal.27 The CRO will not be an \nADB staff member. The nature of the CRO\u2019s work \nwill  demand  full-time  engagement,  particularly  \nsince  the  CRO  needs  to  respond  promptly  \nto complainants. \n\nAddressing site visit issues\n\n76.  The  issues  related  to  CRP  site  visits  are \nsensitive and important. Any controversy on site  \nvisits  harms  the  reputation  of  ADB,  the  CRP, \nand  the  borrowing  country  alike.  Therefore, \nADB\u2019s policy on site visits must be fair, credible, \nand  implementable.  The  working  group  fully  \nrecognizes  the  sensitivities  and  importance  of \nsite visits. Based on careful consideration of sev-\neral options, the working group recommends a \npartnership approach on site visits. \n\n77.  Under  this  approach,  the  CRP  site  visits \nwould  be  handled  using  the  same  principles \nand  practices  applicable  to  all  ADB  missions, \nbut  without  recourse  to  provisions  in  a  loan  \ncovenant.  ADB  would  use  its  good  offices  and \nestablished institutional mechanisms to assist the \nCRP in obtaining access to site visits. Management \nand staff would facilitate a borrowing country\u2019s \nconcurrence for site visits. This approach aims to \nimprove communication between ADB, the CRP, \nand the borrowing countries. ADB and the bor-\nrowing countries would need to work as partners \nto  ensure  the  Accountability  Mechanism  func-\ntions smoothly. \n\n78.  This approach is underpinned by the con-\nsideration  that  managing  country  relations  is  a \ncore dimension of ADB\u2019s engagement with bor-\nrowing countries, with resident missions playing \na particularly important role. The CRP should also \nproactively seek the assistance of the ADB Board \nmember for the borrowing country concerned. \n\n79.  The  partnership  approach  aims  to  mini-\nmize the risk of a borrowing country\u2019s refusal of \nsite visits. Intensive communications are required \nto gain a borrowing country\u2019s acceptance of CRP \nsite visits, and to ensure that the borrower imple-\nments  the  remedial  actions  at  the  end  of  the \ncompliance  review.  The  latter  point  is  especially \nimportant for making compliance review a posi-\ntive tool for improving project quality.\n\n80.  The use of ADB\u2019s institutional mechanisms \nwould be limited to assisting the CRP in gaining \na borrowing country\u2019s acceptance for site visits. \nIt is not designed to influence the outcomes of a \ncompliance review, nor to compromise the CRP\u2019s \nindependence.  The  independence  of  the  CRP \nrests  on  its  ability  to  make  independent  judg-\nments,  and  this  would  not  be  compromised  by \nusing ADB\u2019s institutional arrangements to obtain \nborrowing countries\u2019 consent for site visits.\n\n81.  All  stakeholders  agree  that  site  visits  will \ngenerally  take  place  if  requested  by  the  CRP. \nThe  assumption  in  the  2003  Accountability \nMechanism policy that site visits will be granted \nroutinely  should  be  maintained.  In  the  excep-\ntional  situation  of  refusal,  Management  will \ndiscuss with the borrowing country the reasons \nfor  not  accepting  the  requested  site  visit.  In \nconsultation  with  the  BCRC  and  the  borrowing  \ncountry, Management will convey the reasons to \nthe Board through an information paper.\n\nIn  the  unlikely  event  that  a  site  visit  is \n82. \ndeclined,  a  closure  of  the  compliance  review \nprocess  will  be  highly  desirable,  especially  from \nthe  perspective  of  the  complainants.  The  CRP \nwill complete its work and deliver its final report \nwithout a site visit. The CRP will use all available \ninformation,  make  appropriate  assumptions, \nand  draw  appropriate  inferences  to  complete \nits work. The CRP will present the best and most \ndetailed  analysis  possible  after  exhausting  the \nmost cost-effective and logical alternative means \nto acquire necessary information. In the absence \n\n27  ADB. 2006. Statute of the Administrative Tribunal of the Asian Development Bank.

The  BCRC  will  seek  inputs  from \nthe CRP chair in providing performance feedback \nto the other two CRP members. \n\nenhancing the independence of \ncompliance Review\n\n83.  The review leading to the establishment of \nIED provides insights on how the independence \nof the CRP could be improved.28 Several changes \ndrawing from the IED model are proposed. First, \nCRP members should be appointed by the Board \nbased  on  the  recommendation  of  the  BCRC  in \nconsultation with the President\u2014a process simi-\nlar to the appointment of the director general of \nIED. This would depart from the current practice \nof the Board appointing CRP members based on \nthe  President\u2019s  recommendation.  Second,  the \nCRP chair should be the head of the OCRP with \nfull responsibility for running the office, instead \nof a senior staff member serving as the secretary \nof the OCRP. Third, the CRP\u2019s work program and \nbudget process should be strengthened. The CRP  \nchair  should  be  responsible  for  preparing  a  \ncombined CRP and OCRP annual work plan and \nbudget. The annual work plan and budget should \nbe  endorsed  by  the  BCRC  in  consultation  with \nthe  President,  reviewed  by  the  Board\u2019s  Budget \nReview Committee, and approved by the Board. \n\n84.  The  review  leading  to  the  establishment \nof  IED  also  concluded  that  independence  alone \ndoes not ensure accountability and high-quality  \nis  \nevaluations.  Appropriate  Board  oversight \nnecessary to promote effectiveness and account-\nability  of  an  independent  mechanism.  Like  the \nDevelopment  Effectiveness  Committee\u2019s  role \nwith IED, the BCRC should be the focal point for \nthe CRP\u2019s interaction with the Board and an ave-\nnue  for  regular  dialogue  on  the  Accountability \nMechanism. To enhance accountability, the BCRC \nshould provide written annual performance feed-\nback on each CRP member, similar to the written \nannual  performance  feedback  the  Development \nEffectiveness Committee provides on the director \n\nclarifying the Roles of \ncompliance\u00a0Review\n\n85.  To better use the expertise of the CRP and \nManagement,  the  compliance  review  should \nascertain  the  alleged  direct  and  material  harm, \nand  determine  whether  such  harm  was  the \nresult  of  ADB\u2019s  failure  to  comply  with  its  oper-\national  policies  and  procedures.  Responding  to \nthe  CRP  findings,  Management  should  propose \nremedial  actions  in  consultation  with  the  bor-\nrower,  and  submit  these  to  the  Board  for  con-\nsideration.  To  benefit  from  the  CRP\u2019s  insights \non  the  project,  the  CRP  should  have  an  oppor-\ntunity to comment on Management\u2019s proposed \nremedial actions. The clarification of the roles of \nthe  CRP  and  Management  will  enable  the  CRP \nto use the knowledge it has acquired during the \nreview  process  to  comment  on  Management\u2019s \nremedial actions. It will also allow Management \nto  utilize  its  competency  in  project  design  and \nimplementation  to  identify  remedial  actions  to \nbe discussed and agreed upon with the borrower \nand  approved  by  the  Board.  This  approach  will \nstrengthen the role of the CRP in shaping reme-\ndial actions, and also clarify the specific functions \nof the CRP and Management. The CRP will moni-\ntor the implementation of the remedial actions.\n\n86.  The  IED  experience  demonstrates  that \nwhile  independence  is  an  important  prerequi-\nsite  for  the  credibility  of  a  mechanism,  it \nshould not mean isolation. Consistent with the \npartnership  principle,  the  CRP  should  seek  to \nengage  all  stakeholders  concerned  throughout \nthe  review  process.  The  borrower  should  be \ninformed  about  a  complaint  before  and  after \nits  eligibility  is  determined  and  should  have \nan  opportunity  to  respond  to  the  draft  CRP \ncompliance  review  reports.  This  will  help  build \n\n28  ADB. 2008. Review of the Independence and Effectiveness of the Operations Evaluation Department.

Like  the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Inspection Panel, the CRP should \nprovide \nfor  Management \nto  respond  before  the  eligibility  of  a  request \nis  determined.  However,  the  CRP  alone  is  \nresponsible for all stages and outcomes of the \ncompliance review process. \n\nthe  opportunity \n\nclarifying the cutoff Date\n\n87.  Establishing the cutoff date for filing com-\nplaints based on the PCR lacks predictability since \nthe date of PCR is uncertain. Some stakeholders \nsuggested  extending  the  cutoff  date  to  some-\ntime beyond the issuance of the PCR. However, \nas the issuance of the PCR is uncertain, extend-\ning the date based on the PCR will not address \nthis  problem.  A  better  option  might  be  choos-\ning a date that is known more clearly in advance. \nThe loan or grant closing date is predictable and \nis  disclosed  to  the  public  throughout  the  proj-\nect cycle.29 The cutoff date for filing complaints \ncould be 2 years after the loan or grant closing \ndate, which would provide more clarity and cer-\ntainty, and is also on average longer than the cur-\nrent PCR-based cutoff date.30 \n\n88.  Appendix  8  compares  the  key  features  of \naccountability mechanisms in nine development \nagencies, including the cutoff dates. \n\nimproving efficiency\n\nImproving Processes\n\nphase \n\nconsultation \n\n89.  The \nthe \nAccountability Mechanism requires complainants  \nto provide written comments on the SPF review \nand  assessment  reports.  This  requirement  has \nsometimes been a burden on complainants and \n\nof \n\ndelays the process. Instead, it should be offered \nas  one  option  for  complainants,  rather  than  as \na  requirement.  Complainants\u2019  feedback  can  be \nobtained  through  more  user-friendly  and  faster \nmeans, such as meetings, discussions, and tele-\nphone  calls.  While  the  SPF  should  inform  the \nPresident  about  the  complaints  and  results,  \nthe  current  requirement  that  the  SPF  consult  \nwith  the  President  on  the  procedural  steps  is \nunnecessary and should be dropped. \n\n90.  Operations  departments  and  project-level \ngrievance redress mechanisms should have more \nscope for problem solving. The SPF can engage \nthe  operations  department  concerned  and  the \nproject-level grievance redress mechanism if the \nSPF  thinks  this  will  improve  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of problem solving. The SPF should \ndecide on the degree and manner of the engage-\nment on a case-by-case basis. \n\n91.  The  SPF  and  CRP  should  adopt  a  more \nflexible  monitoring  time  frame  tailored  to  each  \nproject.  SPF  monitoring  should  generally  not \nexceed  2  years  and  CRP  monitoring  should  \ngenerally not exceed 3 years. \n\nrequirements \n\n92.  The  documentation \nfor  \nfiling a complaint can be simplified. The require-\nments should focus on essential information that \nenables  the  processing  of  a  complaint,  while \nmaking  requirements  such  as  specification  of \nthe  complainants\u2019  desired  outcomes  optional. \nrequiring  a  minimum  amount \nMeanwhile, \nof  information  will  help  reduce  the  time  for  \nprocessing the complaint later on. \n\n93.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  policy \nshould  enable  complainants  to  provide  addi-\ntional  information  and  evidence  on  their  com-\nplaint during the problem solving or compliance \nreview processes. This will increase the flexibility \nfor the complainants to strengthen their cases. \n\n29  According to the Project Administration Instruction (4.05), the loan or grant closing date is the last date for the borrowers to \n\nwithdraw from the loan or grant account.\n\n30  An analysis of PCR issuance dates between 2008 and October 2011 shows a large variation, highlighting the uncertainty and \nunpredictability. The loan or grant closing dates plus 2 years will on average provide about 280 more days compared to the \nPCR issuance dates.\n\n18\n\n\fMajor Proposed Changes\n\nImproving Cost Effectiveness\n\n94.  Because  the  Accountability  Mechanism \nis demand-driven, its costs can conceptually be \nseparated into two parts: (i) fixed costs, regard-\nless  of  the  number  of  complaints,  to  maintain \nand  operate  the  Accountability  Mechanism; \nand  (ii)  variable  costs  based  on  demand  and \nworkload.31 The OSPF currently has one interna-\ntional staff in addition to the SPF, one national \nstaff,  and  one  administrative  staff.  The  OCRP \nhas  two  international  staff,  one  national  staff, \nand two administrative staff supporting the CRP \nchair and two other CRP members. Based on a \nreview  of  their  past  workloads,  it  is  proposed \nthat the basic structure for the OSPF and OCRP  \nbe similar.\n\n95.  The 2003 policy provides for the CRP chair \nto  work  full-time  for  a  minimum  of  1  year  to \norganize the OCRP and undertake other related \ntasks (para. 97, 2003 Accountability Mechanism \npolicy, footnote 2). However, since 2003, the CRP \nchair has been full-time in 6 of the 7 years, while \nthe CRP members have been part-time. This has \nbeen shown to be an appropriate arrangement. \nTo  strengthen  the  CRP  and  to  enable  the  chair \nto  fulfill  the  mandate  as  the  head  of  OCRP,  the \nworking  group  recommends  that  the  CRP  chair \nwork full-time. \n\nimproving Awareness and \nenhancing learning\n\n96.  The  joint  OSPF  and  OCRP  outreach  strat-\negies  should  support  three  kinds  of  activi-\nties:  (i)  improving  the  awareness  of  ADB  staff; \n(ii)  undertaking  targeted  outreach  for  govern-\nment  project  teams;  and  (iii)  working  with \nresident  mission  staff,  and  undertaking  regular  \ndissemination  activities  in  DMCs  involving  local \ncommunities,  governments,  NGOs,  and  other \n\nrelevant  stakeholders.  Each  resident  mission \nshould  have  focal  person  working  with  project \nteams on grievance handling and Accountability \nMechanism  outreach.  Operations  staff  should \nbe  the  main  conduit  for  disseminating  infor-\nmation  about  the  Accountability  Mechanism, \nwhich  should  be  viewed  as  a  tool  for  learn-\ning  and  development  effectiveness,  instead  of  \nbeing adversarial.\n\n97.  The  OSPF  and  OCRP  track  the  processes \nand  outcomes  of  all  the  complaints  they  have \nhandled.  The  tracking  should  be  extended  to \ncomplaints  that  were  forwarded  to  the  opera-\ntions  departments  because  of  a  lack  of  prior \ngood  faith  efforts  by  complainants  to  solve  the \nproblems  with  the  operations  department  con-\ncerned.  The  operations  departments  are  also \nencouraged  to  keep  records  of  meetings  and \nother discussions with complainants. This should \nenrich the information for analyzing and reduc-\ning problems. Some good practices have already \nstarted (para. 40).\n\n98.  The  OSPF  and  OCRP  should  distill  les-\nsons  from  their  operations.  The  OSPF  and  CRP  \ncurrently  produce  separate  annual  reports.  A \njoint  Accountability  Mechanism  annual  report \nis recommended to promote synergy. The OSPF \nand OCRP currently have separate websites, lead-\ning  to  fragmentation  and  less  accessibility.  The \nOSPF and OCRP websites\u2014and all other informa-\ntion related to the Accountability Mechanism\u2014 \nshould  be  consolidated  under  a  common \nAccountability Mechanism website within ADB\u2019s \npublic  website  (adb.org).  Similarly,  the  OSPF \nand  OCRP  (or  the  SPF  and  CRP)  logos  and  let-\nterheads should be placed under a common ADB \nAccountability Mechanism logo and letterhead.\n\n99.  The  OSPF,  OCRP,  IED,  and  RSDD  should \nproduce  a  joint  learning  report  every  3  years \nto  distill  lessons  and  insights.  A  collaborative \neffort among these departments would enhance  \n\n31  The  term  \u201cfixed  costs\u201d  in  this  paper  refers  to  the  resources  required  to  support  the  basic  structure  of  the  Accountability \nMechanism regardless of the number of requests. This will include the basic number of staff, offices, and other facilities to \nmaintain and operate the Accountability Mechanism. The term \u201cvariable costs\u201d refers to the resources required to respond to \nfluctuating demand. This could be satisfied, for example, by staff consultants and contractual staff.\n\n19\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nlearning, guide staff in improving project design \nand  implementation, help ADB  avoid  the recur-\nrence  of  common  problems,  and  facilitate  a  \nculture  change  so  that  the  Accountability \nMechanism \ntool  \nfor learning.\n\nis  viewed  as  a  positive \n\n100.  Interactions  between  the  Accountability \nMechanism, the Board, Management, and staff \nwill accelerate the application of lessons learned. \nThe OCRP should provide regular (e.g., quarterly) \nbriefings  to  the  BCRC.  One  of  the  sessions  can \ninvolve  the  joint  OSPF  and  OCRP  dissemination \nof the Accountability Mechanism annual report. \nThe OSPF and OCRP should continue their train-\ning and workshops for ADB staff.\n\n101.  ADB  should  also  revise  some  terms  to \nsharpen  the  Accountability  Mechanism  mes-\nsages.  First,  the  \u201cconsultation  phase\u201d  should \nbe  renamed  the  \u201cproblem  solving  function.\u201d \n\nThe  2003  policy  used  the  term  \u201cconsultation\u201d \nbecause of the concern that the term \u201cproblem \nsolving\u201d  would  create  the  expectation  that  all \nproblems would be solved by the OSPF. However, \nconsultations undertaken as a part of this review \nindicate that this risk is not significant. \u201cProblem \nsolving\u201d would more accurately reflect the nature \nand objective of this function. Second, the 2003 \npolicy  refers  to  cases  received  by  the  OSPF \nas  \u201ccomplaints,\u201d  while  those  received  by  the \nCRP  are  \u201crequests.\u201d  To  promote  simplicity  and  \ndistinguish  Accountability  Mechanism \nissues \nfrom  general  requests  that  can  be  raised  with \nany  part  of  ADB,  it  is  proposed  that  the  cases \nreceived by the OSPF and CRP be referred to as \n\u201ccomplaints\u201d  and  the  people  asking  for  them \nbe  referred  to  as  \u201ccomplainants.\u201d  Third,  as  the \ncomplainants will choose either problem solving  \nor  compliance  review,  the  term  \u201cphase,\u201d  which \nimplies a sequential approach, should be replaced \nwith the term \u201cfunction.\u201d \uf03c\n\n20\n\n\fThe Revised \nAccountability \nMechanism Policy\n\n5\n\n102.  This section uses the 2003 policy as a basis \nand incorporates the recommendations outlined \nin Section 4 and other necessary changes. \n\nstructure\n\nobjectives and Guiding Principles\n\n103.  The  objectives  of \nthe  Accountability \nMechanism  will  be  to  provide  an  independent \nand effective forum for people adversely affected \nby ADB-assisted projects to voice their concerns \nand  seek  solutions  to  their  problems,  and  to \nrequest  compliance  review  of  the  alleged  non-\ncompliance by ADB with its operational policies \nand procedures that may have caused, or is likely \nto cause, them direct and material harm. \n\n104.  The Accountability Mechanism is designed \nto  (i)  increase  ADB\u2019s  development  effectiveness \nand project quality; (ii) be responsive to the con-\ncerns  of  project-affected  people  and  fair  to  all \nstakeholders; (iii) reflect the highest professional \nand technical standards in its staffing and opera-\ntions; (iv) be as independent and transparent as \npossible;  (v)  be  cost-effective  and  efficient;  and \n(vi) be complementary to the other supervision, \naudit,  quality  control,  and  evaluation  systems \nat ADB. \n\n105.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  will  be  a \n\u201clast resort\u201d mechanism. ADB must continue to \nstrengthen  its  project  design,  implementation, \nand  learning  mechanisms  to  prevent  problems \nand  ensure  compliance  from  the  outset,  and \nto deal with the legitimate concerns of project-\naffected  people  at  the  project  and  operational \nlevels wherever possible. \n\n106.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  will  have \ntwo functions. The problem solving function will \nbe led by the SPF who will respond to problems \nof local people affected by ADB-assisted projects  \nthrough  a  range  of \ninformal  and  flexible  \nmethods.  The  compliance  review  function  will \nbe led by the CRP, which will investigate alleged \nnoncompliance  by  ADB  with  its  operational  \npolicies  and  procedures  that  has  caused,  or \nis  likely  to  cause,  direct  and  material  harm  to  \nproject-affected people. \n\n107.  To  provide  an  easily  accessible  single \nentry  point  for  project-affected  people,  this \ntwo-pronged  structure  will  be  supported \nby \nreceive  all  com-\nplaints  from  people  seeking  access  to  the  \nAccountability Mechanism. \n\nthe  CRO  who  will \n\nhuman and financial Resources\n\nThe Problem Solving Function\n\n108.  The SPF will head the OSPF, which will have \none  other  international  staff  member  and  two \nadministrative  or  national  staff  members.  The \nSPF will be a special appointee at a level equiv-\nalent  to  a  director  general.  Appointed  by  the \nPresident after consultation with the Board, the \nSPF will report directly to the President. The OSPF \nmay  engage  technical  experts  as  consultants  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use \nof  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time \nto time) and other arrangements satisfactory to \n\n21\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nADB to assist the OSPF\u2019s work, including moni-\ntoring activities. \n\n109.  The  selection  criteria  for  the  SPF  will \ninclude (i) the ability to deal thoroughly and fairly \nwith complaints; (ii) integrity and independence \nfrom  the  operations  departments;  (iii)  exposure \nto  developmental  issues  and  living  conditions \nin  developing  countries;  and  (iv)  knowledge  of, \nand  experience  with,  the  operations  of  ADB  or \ncomparable  institutions,  and/or  private  sector \nexperience. Mediation skills will be an asset. The \nSPF\u2019s  term  will  be  3  years  and  may  be  renew-\nable for another 2 years. The SPF must not have \nworked  in  any  ADB  operations  departments  for \nat  least  5  years  before  the  appointment.  The \nSPF  must  disclose  immediately  to  the  President \nany personal interest or significant prior involve-\nment  in  a  project  that  is  subject  to  problem  \nsolving procedures. The SPF will have access to all \nADB staff and Management, and all ADB records \nthat  the  SPF  deems  relevant,  except  personal \ninformation that is typically restricted. \n\n110.  The  President  will  evaluate  the  perfor-\nmance of the SPF. The work planning, budgeting, \nand staffing of the OSPF will be processed in the \nsame way as other ADB departments. Necessary \nflexibility will be ensured in the work plans and \nbudget  to  accommodate  the  demand-driven \nnature  of  the  problem  solving  function.  Any \nadditional human and financial resources for the \nOSPF,  if  required,  will  be  approved  through  the \nwork program and budget framework process or \nby  the  President.32  The  Budget,  Personnel,  and \nManagement Systems Department (BPMSD) will \nhandle the administrative processes according to \nADB guidelines.\n\nThe Compliance Review Function\n\n111.  Compliance  Review  Panel.  The  CRP  will \nhave  three  members,  one  of  whom  will  be  the \nchair. The CRP chair will be full time and the two \nCRP  members  will  be  part  time  and  called  on \n\nwhen required. CRP members will be appointed \nby  the  Board  upon  the  recommendation  of  the \nBCRC  in  consultation  with  the  President.  The \nBCRC will direct the search and selection process, \nwhich may involve the use of an executive search \nfirm  if  the  BCRC  considers  it  necessary.  BPMSD \nwill handle the administrative processes.\n\n112.  Each  panel  member  will  have  a  5-year, \nnonrenewable term. Two panel members will be \nfrom  regional  member  countries,  with  at  least \none  from  a  DMC.  The  third  panel  member  will \nbe  from  a  nonregional  member  country.  The \nselection criteria for panel members will include \n(i)  the  ability  to  deal  thoroughly  and  fairly  with \nthe  complaints;  (ii)  integrity  and  independence \nfrom  Management;  (iii)  exposure  to  develop-\nmental issues and living conditions in developing \ncountries; and (iv) knowledge of, and experience \nwith, the operations of ADB or comparable insti-\ntutions, and/or private sector experience. \n\n113.  Directors,  alternate  directors,  directors\u2019 \nadvisors,  Management,  staff,  and  consultants \nwill be ineligible to serve on the CRP until at least \n3 years have elapsed from their time of employ-\nment with ADB. After serving on the CRP, panel \nmembers will be barred from any future employ-\nment at ADB. A panel member may be removed \nin the same way as he or she was appointed on \nthe  grounds  of  inefficiency  and/or  misconduct. \nA  panel  member  will  be  disqualified  from  par-\nticipating  in  a  compliance  review  if  he  or  she \nhas  a  personal  interest  or  has  had  significant \nprior involvement in a project under compliance  \nreview.  A  panel  member  must  disclose  imme-\ndiately  to  the  BCRC  any  personal  interest  or  \nsignificant prior involvement in a project subject \nto compliance review.\n\n114.  The  CRP  will  be  a  fact-finding  body  that \nreports  to  the  Board  through  the  BCRC.  CRP \nmembers will not be subject to the formal annual \nperformance  review  process  for  staff.  However, \nthe BCRC chair, in consultation with other BCRC \n\n32  Resource  needs  from,  for  example,  an  unanticipated  rise  in  complaints  can  be  addressed  by  hiring  contractual  staff  or  \n\nconsultants.\n\n22\n\n\fThe Revised Accountability Mechanism Policy\n\nmembers,  will  provide  written  annual  feedback \non their performance. The BCRC will seek inputs \nfrom  the  CRP  chair  in  providing  performance \nfeedback on the other two CRP members. \n\n115.  The  Board  will  determine  the  CRP  chair\u2019s \nsalary,  upon  recommendation  of  the  BCRC  in \nconsultation with the President. The CRP chair\u2019s \nannual salary increase will be the average of the \nsalary increases given to the vice-presidents. The \npart-time  CRP  members  will  be  remunerated  at \nlevels  comparable  to  those  received  by  panel  \nmembers of accountability mechanisms at simi-\nlar  institutions,  or  based  on  their  experience  \nand expertise. \n\n116.  The  CRP  may  engage  technical  experts  as \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended \nfrom time to time) and other arrangements sat-\nisfactory  to  ADB  to  assist  in  its  work,  including \npost-compliance review monitoring. The CRP will \nhave  access  to  all  ADB  staff  and  Management, \nand  all  ADB  records  that  the  CRP  deems  rel-\nevant,  except  personal \nis  \ntypically restricted. \n\ninformation  that \n\n117.

The  OCRP \nwill be headed by the CRP chair and will have one \ninternational staff member and two administra-\ntive or national staff members. The international \nstaff  member  of  the  OCRP  will  report  to  the  \nCRP chair. \n\n118.  OCRP  staff  will  be  ADB  staff.  The  terms \nand conditions of their employment will be the \nsame  as  for  other  ADB  staff,  as  provided  by \nADB staff regulations and administrative orders. \nOCRP staff can be transferred to and from other \nparts of ADB. As the IED experience has demon-\nstrated,  this  flexibility  in  staff  movement  helps \nguard  against  the  potential  isolation  of  the \n\nCRP  and  enriches  both  compliance  review  and \noperations through the exchange of knowledge  \nand experience.\n\n119.  The  CRP  chair  will  be  responsible  for  \npreparing  the  combined  annual  work  plan  and \nbudget  of  the  CRP  and  OCRP.  The  annual  work \nplan and budget will be endorsed by the BCRC in \nconsultation with the President, and reviewed by \nthe Board\u2019s Budget Review Committee. The work \nplan and budget proposal will then be presented \nto the Board for approval, separately from ADB\u2019s \noverall  administrative  budget.  Necessary  flex-\nibility will be ensured in the work plan and bud-\nget to accommodate the demand-driven nature \nof  the  compliance  review  function.  The  CRP \nchair,  in  consultation  with  other  CRP  members, \nmay  request  additional  human  and/or  financial \nresources,  if  needed.33  The  BCRC,  in  consulta-\ntion with the President, will endorse these addi-\ntional resources, which will then be approved by  \nthe Board. BPMSD will handle the administrative \nprocesses in relation to OCRP staff in accordance \nwith ADB guidelines.\n\n120.

The  BCRC  members \nwill be appointed in accordance with the Board\u2019s \nRules  of  Procedure.  The  Office  of  the  Secretary \nwill provide support to the BCRC. \n\nThe Complaint Receiving Officer\n\n121.  The  OSPF  and  OCRP  will  jointly  engage  a \ndedicated CRO from outside ADB, in a way simi-\nlar to the engagement of the executive secretary \nof ADB\u2019s Administrative Tribunal. The CRO will be \nengaged on a full-time basis to respond promptly \nto complainants. The CRO will report to the SPF \nand the CRP chair. \n\n33  As with the OSPF, resource needs from, for example, an unanticipated rise in complaints can be addressed by hiring contrac-\n\ntual staff or consultants.\n\n23\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nLegal Advice\n\n122.  The  Office  of  the  General  Counsel  will \nadvise the OSPF, SPF, OCRP, CRP, BCRC, and Board \non matters concerning ADB\u2019s legal status, rights, \nand obligations under the Agreement Establishing \nthe Asian Development Bank (the Charter)34 and \nany agreement to which ADB is a party, and on \nany  other  matters  relating  to  ADB\u2019s  rights  and  \nobligations  with  respect  to  any  complaint  \nrequesting problem solving or compliance review \nunder the Accountability Mechanism policy. \n\n123.  Consistent  with  the  current  practice,  the \nOffice  of  the  General  Counsel  will  facilitate  the \nCRP\u2019s access to specialist legal advice on the laws  \nand  regulations  of  the  borrowing  countries  \nconcerned as necessary.\n\nfunctions\n\nReceiving Complaints\n\n124.

The  CRO  will  carry  out  all  functions  with \nobjectivity and neutrality. \n\nProblem Solving\n\n126.  The  problem  solving  function  will  assist \npeople  directly,  materially,  and  adversely \naffected  by  specific  problems  caused  by  ADB-\nassisted  projects  through  informal,  flexible,  and  \nconsensus-based methods with the consent and \nparticipation of all parties concerned. The general \napproaches will include (i) consultative dialogue, \n(ii)  information  sharing,  (iii)  joint  fact-finding, \nand (iv) mediation. The SPF may suggest various \nspecific  approaches  to  resolve  problems,  such \nas  convening  meetings,  organizing  and  facili-\ntating  consultation  processes,  or  engaging  in  a \nfact-finding review of the situation. The problem \nsolving  function  will  be  outcome-driven.  It  will \nnot focus on the identification and allocation of \nblame, but on finding ways to address the prob-\nlems of the project-affected people. \n\n127.  The SPF problem solving function will also \naim  to  strengthen  the  internal  problem  solving  \nprocesses  of  operations  departments.

The  OSPF  problem  solving  function  will \nnot  replace  the  project  administration  and \nproblem solving functions of operations depart-\nments which are an inherent part of their work. \nOperations departments have the initial respon-\nsibility for responding to the concerns of affected \npeople.  The  operations  departments  will  also \ncontinue  to  improve  their  problem  prevention \nand  problem  solving  capabilities.  The  SPF\u2019s \nrole  will  be  confined  to  ADB-related  issues  on  \nADB-assisted  projects.

For both the problem solving and compli-\nance  review  functions,  complaints  may  be  filed \nby (i) any group of two or more people in a bor-\nrowing country where the ADB-assisted project is \nlocated or in a member country adjacent to the \nborrowing  country  who  are  directly,  materially, \nand adversely affected; (ii) a local representative \nof such affected persons; or (iii) a nonlocal repre-\nsentative of such affected persons, in exceptional \ncases where local representation cannot be found \n\nand the SPF or CRP agrees. If a complaint is made \nthrough a representative, it must clearly identify \nthe project-affected people on whose behalf the \ncomplaint  is  made  and  provide  evidence  of  the \nauthority to represent such people. \n\n139.  For  the  compliance  review,  complaints \nmay also be filed by any one or more ADB Board \nmembers,  after  first  raising  their  concerns  with \nManagement,  in  special  cases  involving  allega-\ntions  of  serious  violations  of  ADB\u2019s  operational \npolicies  and  procedures  relating  to  an  ongoing \nADB-assisted  project.  These  alleged  violations \nmust have, or are likely to have, a direct, mate-\nrial, and adverse effect on a community or other \ngrouping  of  individuals  residing  in  the  country \nwhere the project is being implemented or resid-\ning  in  a  member  country  adjacent  to  the  bor-\nrowing country. The conduct of the compliance \nreview  requested  by  a  Board  member  will  not \naffect or limit the existing rights of Board mem-\nbers to request or initiate reviews of ADB policies \nand procedures.\n\n140.  Compliance  reviews  cover  only  ADB-\nassisted  projects.40  The  filing  of  a  complaint  to \neither the SPF or CRP will not suspend or other-\nwise affect the formulation, processing, or imple-\nmentation of the project unless agreed to by the \nborrower concerned and ADB.\n\nScope and Exclusions\n\n141.  Problem  solving  function.  The  problem \nsolving function will be outcome-driven, focusing \nnot on the identification and allocation of blame, \nbut on finding ways to address the problems of \nthe  people  affected  by  ADB-assisted  projects. \nThe  scope  of  the  problem  solving  function  will \nbe broader than the compliance review function. \nPeople  who  believe  they  have  been  or  will  be \ndirectly, materially, and adversely affected by an \nADB-assisted project can use the problem solving \nfunction regardless of whether ADB operational \npolicies  and  procedures  have  been  complied \nwith.  However,  the  problem  solving  function \n\n40  The term \u201cADB-assisted project\u201d refers to a project financed or to be financed, or administered or to be administered, by ADB; \n\nand covers both sovereign and nonsovereign operations.\n\n28\n\n\fThe Revised Accountability Mechanism Policy\n\nwill be limited to ADB-related issues concerning  \nADB-assisted projects. \n\ncompleted  the  compliance  review  process), \nexcept those complaints considered ineligible for \ncompliance review by the CRP.\n\n142.  Complaints will be excluded if they are\n\n(i)  about  actions  that  are  not  related  to \nADB\u2019s action or omission in the course of \nformulating,  processing,  or  implement-\ning ADB-assisted projects;\n\n(ii)  about  matters \n\nthat \n\ncomplainants \nhave  not  made  good  faith  efforts  to \naddress with the operations department \nconcerned;\n\n(iii)  about  matters  already  considered  by \nthe  SPF,  unless  the  complainants  have \nnew evidence previously not available to \nthem  and  unless  the  subsequent  com-\nplaint  can  be  readily  consolidated  with \nthe earlier complaint;\n\n(iv)  about an ADB-assisted project for which \n2  or  more  years  have  passed  since  the \nloan or grant closing date;41\n\n(v)  frivolous, malicious, trivial, or generated \n\nto gain competitive advantage;\n\n(vi)  about decisions made by ADB, the bor-\nrower  or  executing  agency,  or  the  pri-\nvate sector client on the procurement of \ngoods and services, including consulting \nservices;\n\n(vii) about allegations of fraud or corruption \nin ADB-assisted projects or by ADB staff;\n(viii) about  the  adequacy  or  suitability  of \nADB\u2019s existing policies and procedures;\n(ix)  within the jurisdiction of ADB\u2019s Appeals \nCommittee  or  ADB\u2019s  Administrative \nTribunal,  or  relate  to  ADB  personnel \nmatters; and/or\n\n(x)  about  ADB\u2019s  non-operational  house-\nkeeping  matters,  such  as  finance  and \nadministration.\n\n143.  The  problem  solving  function  will  also \nexclude  matters  being  dealt  with  or  already \ndealt with by the CRP (including those that have \n\n144.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  policy  will \nnot  require  complainants\u2019  good  faith  efforts \nto  solve  problems  with  project-level  griev-\nance  redress  mechanisms  as  a  precondition  for \ntheir  access  to  the  Accountability  Mechanism. \nHowever,  complainants  will  be  encouraged  to \nfirst  address  their  problems  with  the  project-\nlevel  grievance  redress  mechanisms  to  facilitate \nprompt problem solving on the ground.\n\n145.  Compliance  Review  Function.  The  CRP \nwill  examine  whether  the  direct  and  material \nharm  alleged  by  the  complainants  is  the  result \nof ADB\u2019s failure to follow its operational policies \nand procedures in the course of formulating, pro-\ncessing, or implementing an ADB-assisted project. \nThe  scope  of  compliance  review  will  be  ADB\u2019s \noperational policies and procedures as they relate \nto formulating, processing, or implementing an \nADB-assisted project. The applicable operational \npolicies and procedures will depend on whether \nthe complaint concerns a proposed or an ongo-\ning project. A \u201cproposed project\u201d refers to a proj-\nect being prepared that has not been approved \nby  the  Board  or  the  President  (as  delegated  by \nthe Board). An \u201congoing project\u201d refers to a proj-\nect that has been approved by the Board or the \nPresident (as delegated by the Board). For a pro-\nposed project, the time frames refer to the poli-\ncies and procedures that were in effect when the \ncomplaint was filed with the CRP. For an ongoing \nproject,  these  refer  to  policies  and  procedures \nthat were in effect at the time of the Board\u2019s or \nPresident\u2019s approval of the project, unless other-\nwise specified in the relevant project, procedural, \nor policy documents.\n\n146.  The  Board  will  decide  whether  a  policy \nis  an  operational  policy  subject  to  compliance \n\n41  For programmatic operations, such as multitranche financing facilities, additional financing, and policy-based lending, the \ncutoff will be tranche- (or its equivalent) based. For projects whose loan or grant closing dates are kept open after project \ncompletion  for  purposes  such  as  capitalizing  interest  payments  and  liquidation,  the  cutoff  date  will  be  2  years  after  the  \nproject completion date. \n\n29\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nreview,42 and the CRP will determine which part \nof the operational policies and procedures was or \nis not complied with after carrying out a compli-\nance review. The ADB\u2019s operational policies and \nprocedures  subject  to  compliance  review  will \nnot include guidelines and/or similar documents  \nor statements.\n\n147.  The CRP must be satisfied that there is evi-\ndence of the coexistence of (i) direct and mate-\nrial  harm  caused  by  the  ADB-assisted  project, \n(ii)  noncompliance  by  ADB  with  its  operational \npolicies and procedures, and (iii) the noncompli-\nance as a cause for such harm. \n\n148.  All types of complaints excluded from the \nproblem  solving  function  will  also  be  excluded \nfrom  the  compliance  review  function  with  the \nexception of item (iii) in para. 142. In addition, \nfor the purpose of compliance review, the follow-\ning will also be excluded: \n\n(i)  complaints  relating  to  actions  that  are \nthe  responsibility  of  other  parties,  such \nas  a  borrower,  executing  agency,  or \npotential  borrower,  unless  the  conduct \nof  these  other  parties  is  directly  rel-\nevant  to  an  assessment  of  ADB\u2019s  com-\npliance with its operational policies and \nprocedures; \n\n(ii)  complaints  that  do  not  involve  ADB\u2019s \nnoncompliance with its operational poli-\ncies and procedures; \n\n(iii)  complaints being dealt with by the SPF \nup  to  the  completion  of  step  3  under \nthe  problem  solving  function  (paras. \n164\u2013173);\n\n(iv)  complaints relating to the laws, policies, \nand regulations of the DMC government \nconcerned  unless  they  directly  relate  to \nADB\u2019s  compliance  with  its  operational \npolicies and procedures; and/or\n\n(v)  complaints  about  matters  already \nconsidered  by  the  CRP,  unless  the \n\ncomplainants  have  new  evidence  pre-\nviously  not  available  to  them  and \ncomplaint \nsubsequent \nunless \ncan  be  readily  consolidated  with  the  \nearlier complaint.\n\nthe \n\n149.  The  CRP  will  not  consider  the  policies \nand  procedures  of  other  institutions  except  to \nthe  extent  that  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  procedures \nhave  explicit  reference  to  those  of  the  other \ninstitutions.\n\nhow to file a complaint\n\n150.  Complaints must be in writing and prefer-\nably  addressed  to  the  CRO.  Complaints  may  be \nsubmitted by mail, fax, e-mail, or hand delivery \nto  the  CRO  at  ADB  headquarters.  Complaints \nfrom people seeking access to the Accountability \nMechanism  will  also  be  accepted  by  any  ADB \noffice, such as a resident mission or representa-\ntive office, which will forward them to the CRO. \nThe  working  language  of  the  Accountability \nMechanism  is  English,  but  complaints  may  be \nsubmitted  in  any  of  the  official  or  national  lan-\nguages of ADB\u2019s DMCs. In cases where the com-\nplaints  are  submitted  in  languages  other  than \nEnglish,  additional  time  will  be  required  for \ntranslation. The identities of complainants will be \nkept confidential unless the complainants agree \nto disclose their identities, but anonymous com-\nplaints will not be accepted.43 \n\n151.  The complaint must specify the following:\n\n(i)  names,  designations,  addresses,  and \ncontact information of the complainants \nand their representative;\n\n(ii)  if  a  complaint  is  made  through  a  rep-\nresentative, identification of the project-\naffected  people  on  whose  behalf  the \ncomplaint is made and evidence of the \nauthority to represent them;\n\n42  Whether a policy is subject to the Accountability Mechanism is generally indicated in the policy when it is submitted to  \nthe  Board  for  its  consideration.  The  ADB  Operations  Manual  clearly  indicates  whether  a  specific  section  is  subject  to  \ncompliance review.\n\n43  The identities of representatives will not be kept confidential, but will be disclosed to ensure transparency.\n\n30\n\n\fThe Revised Accountability Mechanism Policy\n\n(iii)  whether  the  complainants  choose  to \n\nProcessing complaints\n\nkeep their identities confidential; \n\n(iv)  whether  the  complainants  choose  to \nundergo problem solving with the OSPF \nor compliance review with the CRP;\n(v)  a  brief  description  of  the  ADB-assisted \nproject, including the name and location;\n(vi)  a description of the direct and material \nharm  that  has  been,  or  is  likely  to  be, \ncaused to the complainants by the ADB-\nassisted project; \n\n(vii) a description of the complainants\u2019 good \nfaith efforts to address the problems first \nwith  the  operations  department  con-\ncerned, and the results of these efforts; \nand\n\n(viii) if  applicable,  a  description  of  the  com-\nplainants\u2019  efforts  to  address  the  com-\nplaint with the OSPF, and the results of \nthese efforts.\n\n152.  Complainants can also provide the follow-\ning optional information:\n\n(i)  an  explanation  of  why  the  complain-\nants  claim  that  the  direct  and  mate-\nrial  harm  alleged  is,  or  will  be,  caused \nby the alleged failure by ADB to follow \nits  operational  policies  and  procedures \nin  the  course  of  formulating,  process-\ning,  or  implementing  the  ADB-assisted  \nproject;\n\n(ii)  a  description  of  the  operational  poli-\ncies and procedures that have not been \ncomplied with by ADB in the course of \nformulating,  processing,  or  implement-\ning the ADB-assisted project; \n\n(iii)  a  description  of  the  complainants\u2019 \nefforts to address the problems with the \nproject-level  grievance  redress  mecha-\nnisms  concerned,  and  the  results  of \nthese efforts;\n\n(iv)  the  desired  outcome  or  remedies  that \ncomplainants  believe  ADB  should  pro-\nvide or help through the Accountability \nMechanism; and \n\n(v)  any other relevant matters or facts with \n\nsupporting documents.\n\n153.  The complainants will decide and indicate \nwhether they want to undergo the problem solv-\ning or compliance review function. They can exit \nthe  problem  solving  function  and  file  for  com-\npliance  review.  Complainants  can  also  request \ncompliance  review  upon  the  completion  of  \nstep  3  of  the  problem  solving  process  (paras. \n170\u2013173)  if  they  have  serious  concerns  on \ncompliance  issues.  Complainants  can  exit  or  \ndisengage  from  either  the  problem  solving  or \ncompliance review function at any time, which will \nterminate  the  process.  However,  complainants  \ncannot switch from compliance review to prob-\nlem  solving  during  the  compliance  review  pro-\ncess, or request problem solving upon the com-\npletion  of  a  compliance  review.  Complainants \ncan  provide  additional  information  or  evidence \non  the  complaint  during  the  problem  solving \nor compliance review processes. However, com-\nplaints about different issues will be filed as new \ncomplaints.  The  OSPF  and  CRP  will  determine \nindependently  whether  the  complaint  meets \ntheir respective eligibility criteria. The OSPF and \nCRP will fully share information and analysis with \neach other on the complaint.\n\nindicative  steps  are  described \n\n154.  The \nin \nparas.155\u2013195. The term \u201cdays\u201d refer to working  \ndays unless otherwise specified. \n\nReceiving Complaints\n\n155.  Step 1: Receiving and registering a com-\nplaint.  The  complainants  or  their  representa-\ntive  file  a  complaint  with  the  CRO.  Complaints \nreceived by any other ADB departments or offices \nfrom people seeking to access the Accountability \nMechanism  will  be  forwarded  to  the  CRO.  \nThe CRO will inform the SPF, the CRP chair, and the  \noperations  department  concerned  about  the \ncomplaint  within  2  days  of  receiving  it;  attach-\ning a copy of the complaint letter. In copying or \nforwarding  the  information,  the  CRO  will  take \nnecessary measures to ensure the confidentiality \nof  the  complainants\u2019  identities  (for  example,  by \n\n31\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nmasking the names of the complainants) unless \nthe  complainants  indicated  that  confidential-\nity is not required. The CRO will also stress to all \nparties  concerned  within  ADB  the  importance \nof  ensuring  the  confidentiality  requested  by  \ncomplainants. The CRO will register the complaint \non the Accountability Mechanism website within  \n2  days  of  receiving  it.  This  is  an  administra-\ntive  step  and  does  not  mean  the  complaint  is \nadmissible  or  eligible  for  problem  solving  or  \ncompliance review.\n\n156.  Step  2:  Acknowledging  the  complaint. \nWithin  2  days  of  receiving  the  complaint,  the \nCRO  will  acknowledge  receipt  of  the  complaint \nand send an Accountability Mechanism informa-\ntion  packet  to  the  complainants.  The  CRO  will \ninform  the  complainants  that  they  can  change \ntheir choice on whether to undergo the problem \nsolving or compliance review within 21 calendar  \ndays  from  the  date  of  the  CRO\u2019s  acknowledge-\nment  letter.  The  CRO  will  also  ask  the  com-\nplainants to clarify their choice if this is not clearly \nindicated in the complaint letter. \n\n157.  Step 3: Forwarding the complaint. Within \n5 days after the deadline for the complainants to \nnotify the CRO of any change in their choice of \neither to undergo problem solving or compliance \nreview, the CRO will decide whether to forward \nthe complaint to\n\n(i) \n\nthe SPF, if the complainants indicated a \nchoice to undergo problem solving; or\n\n(ii)  the  CRP  chair,  if  the  complainants  indi-\ncated  a  choice  to  undergo  compliance \nreview; or\n\n(iii)  other \n\nand/\nrelevant  departments \nor  offices  as  appropriate  if  the  com-\nplaints  fall  outside  the  mandate  of  the \nAccountability  Mechanism,  such  as \nthose  on  procurement  or  corruption, \naccording to the relevant ADB policies.\n\ninform \n\n158.

The  CRO  will  give \nthe  relevant  parties  3  days  to  raise  any  objec-\ntions  and  concerns \nthe  CRO\u2019s \ndecision.  The  CRO  will  forward  the  com-\nplaint  to  the  relevant  party  and  copy  other  \nrelevant parties if there is no objection. \n\nregarding \n\n159.  The  CRO  will  return  the  complaint  to  \nthe  complainants  and  seek  their  clarification  if \nthe  complainants  have  not  clearly  indicated  a \nchoice for problem solving or compliance review, \nor  if  any  party  in  ADB  objects  the  CRO\u2019s  deci-\nsion  regarding  where  to  forward  the  complaint \n(paras. 157\u2013158). \n\n160.  When  the  CRO  needs  to  return  the  com-\nplaint  to  the  complainants  and  seek  their  clari-\nfication,  the  CRO  will  include  an  information \npacket  on  ADB\u2019s  Accountability  Mechanism. \nThe  information  packet  will  indicate  that  the \ncomplainants  can  choose  to  undertake  either \nproblem  solving  or  compliance  review.  It  will \nhighlight  the  differences  between  the  two  \nfunctions,  indicating  that  the  problem  solving \nfunction is intended to address the problems on \nthe ground and facilitate resolution of the prob-\nlem, while the compliance review function is to \nreview  ADB\u2019s  compliance  with  its  operational \npolicies  and  procedures.  The  resulting  remedies \n(if  any)  to  bring  a  project  into  compliance  may \nor  may  not  mitigate  any  harm.  The  informa-\ntion  packet  will  also  explain  the  procedural  dif-\nferences between these two functions. The CRO \nwill give the complainants 60 calendar days from \nthe  date  of  the  CRO\u2019s  letter  to  respond.  If  the  \ncomplainants  do  not  respond  by  such  dead-\nline,  their  complaint  will  be  treated  as  a  \nnew complaint. \n\n161.  Step  4:  Informing  the  complainants. \nWithin  2  days  of  forwarding  the  complaint \nto  the  relevant  party,  the  CRO  will  notify  the \ncomplainants  and \nrepre-\nsentative  about  where  the  complaint  was  \nforwarded to, and the contact person(s) for the  \nsubsequent steps. \n\ntheir  authorized \n\n32\n\n\fThe Revised Accountability Mechanism Policy\n\nThe Problem Solving Function\n\n162.  The  problem  solving  process  is  expected \nto take about 180 days from the registration of \nthe  complaint  to  an  agreement  on  the  reme-\ndial  actions.  This  excludes  translation  time,  any \nrequest  for  extension  to  provide  information  or \nfile documents, and the time needed by the par-\nties to facilitate the resolution of their problems. \nThe  SPF  may  draw  on  the  project-level  griev-\nance redress mechanisms and/or the operations \ndepartments to resolve problems. \n\n163.  Step  1:  Determining  eligibility.  After \nacknowledging the complaint, the SPF will screen \nthe complaint and determine its eligibility within \n21  days  of  receiving  the  complaint  forwarded \nby  the  CRO.44  To  find  a  complaint  eligible,  the \nSPF must be satisfied with the following require-\nments:  (i)  the  complaint  satisfies  all  eligibility \ncriteria  and  scope  and  does  not  fall  within  any \nof  the  exclusions  (paras.  141\u2013143);  and  (ii)  the \nSPF believes, at his or her sole discretion, that the \nSPF\u2019s involvement could be useful.  \n\n164.  In  determining  whether  the  complaint  is \neligible,  the  SPF  will  review  whether  the  com-\nplainants made prior good faith efforts to solve \nthe  problems  with  the  operations  department \nconcerned.  The  SPF  will  forward  the  complaint \nto  the  operations  department  concerned  if  the \ncomplainants did not make such efforts. The SPF \nwill  consult  and  seek  information  from  relevant \nparties, such as the complainants, the borrower, \nand  the  operations  department  concerned.  The \nSPF  should  also  ascertain  whether  confiden-\ntiality  is  being  requested  by  the  complainants \nand  take  the  necessary  actions  to  ensure  such \nconfidentiality.\n\n165.  The  SPF  will  report  the  decision  on  eligi-\nbility  to  the  President,  with  a  copy  to  the  vice- \npresident concerned, the operations department, \nand the CRO. The SPF will inform the complainants  \nupon the determination of eligibility. \n\n166.  Step  2:  Review  and  assessment.  If  the \ncomplaint  is  eligible,  the  SPF  will  review  and \nassess the complaint to (i) understand the history \nof  the  complaint,  (ii)  confirm  the  stakeholders, \n(iii) clarify the issues of concern and the options \nfor resolving them, (iv) explore the stakeholders\u2019 \nreadiness for joint problem solving, and (v) rec-\nommend how the problem can best be solved. \n\n167.  The  review  may  include  site  visits;  inter-\nviews; and meetings with the complainants, the \nborrower, and any other people the SPF believes \nwould  be  helpful  and  beneficial.  The  SPF  will \nobtain information from the operations depart-\nment  and,  if  necessary,  request  the  operations \ndepartment\u2019s  advice  and  support.  The  SPF  will \nfield fact-finding missions on his or her own ini-\ntiative;  or  participate,  in  consultation  with  the \noperations department, in special project admin-\nistration missions of the operations department. \n\n168.  The  SPF  will  complete  the  review  and \nassessment,  and  report  the  findings  to  the \nPresident, with a copy to the vice-president con-\ncerned.  The  SPF  will  also  send  the  findings  to \nthe complainants, the borrower, and the opera-\ntions department concerned, with a request for \ntheir  comments.  Based  on  the  assessment  and \ntaking into account the comments received, the \nSPF  will  decide,  solely  at  his  or  her  discretion, \nwhether  to  (i)  proceed  with  problem  solving, \nor  (ii)  determine  that  no  further  problem  solv-\ning efforts will be purposeful and conclude the \nprocess.  The  SPF  is  expected  to  take  120  days \nfrom determination of eligibility to complete the \nreview and assessment.\n\n169.  Step 3: Problem solving. If problem solv-\ning  proceeds,  the  SPF  will  assist  the  parties  to \nengage  in  resolving  the  problem.  The  problem \nsolving process will depend on the circumstances. \nThe  OSPF  may  facilitate  a  consultative  dialogue, \npromote  information  sharing,  undertake  joint  \nfact-finding, facilitate the establishment of a medi-\nation mechanism, and/or use other approaches to \n\n44  The forwarding of the complaint by the CRO to the SPF does not constitute a determination of the eligibility of the complaint.\n\n33\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nproblem solving. The time required for the prob-\nlem  solving  will  vary  depending  on  the  nature, \ncomplexity, and scope of the problems. \n\n170.  Implementing  the  problem  solving  pro-\ncess requires the consent of every party involved. \nExcept for the SPF, a party can walk away from \nthe process if the party does not consider it pur-\nposeful  or  if  there  is  no  consensus.  This  would \nformally close the problem solving process.\n\n171.  Remedial  actions  that  are  adopted  as \na  result  of  the  problem  solving  process  will  be \nreflected  in  a  written  agreement  or  series  of \nagreements among the parties. Remedial actions \ninvolving  a  change  in  the  project  will  require \napproval  according  to  ADB\u2019s  applicable  proce-\ndures, and agreement by the borrower.\n\n172.  When  the  problem  solving  process  has \nbeen  completed  (with  or  without  any  agree-\nment),  the  SPF  will  submit  a  report  to  the \nPresident, with a copy to the vice-president and \nthe  operations  department  concerned,  summa-\nrizing the complaint, steps to resolve the issues, \ndecisions  by  the  parties  concerned,  and  the \nagreement, if any, by the parties concerned. The \nSPF will issue this report and furnish it to the com-\nplainants, the borrower, the CRP, and the Board  \nfor information. \n\n173.  Upon  completion  of  this  step,  the  com-\nplainants  can  also  file  for  compliance  review  if \nthey have serious concerns on compliance issues, \nto  be  carried  out  with  the  implementation  and \nmonitoring of the remedial actions (step 4). \n\n174.  Step 4: Implementation and monitoring. \nThe  relevant  parties  will  implement  the  agreed \nupon remedial actions, and the SPF will monitor \nthe  implementation.  The  SPF  will  report  annu-\nally  to  the  President,  with  a  copy  to  the  Board, \nregarding the status of implementation. As part \nof  the  monitoring  process,  the  SPF  will  consult \nwith  the  complainants,  the  borrower,  and  the \noperations department concerned. The monitor-\ning time frame will be project specific depending \non the implementation of the remedial actions, \n\nbut  will  generally  not  exceed  2  years.  All  stake-\nholders, including the public, may submit infor-\nmation  regarding  the  status  of  implementation \nto the SPF. \n\n175.  The  SPF\u2019s  monitoring  reports  will  be  sent \nto the complainants, the borrower, and the oper-\nations  department  concerned;  and  submitted \nto the President and the Board for information. \nThe SPF will produce annual monitoring reports \nfor  a  complaint  if  the  monitoring  time  frame \nexceeds  1  year.  If  the  monitoring  time  frame  is \nabout 1 year or less, the monitoring results may \nbe  included  in  the  SPF  final  report  described  in \nstep  5.  In  monitoring  the  remedial  actions,  the \nSPF can either produce monitoring reports for a \nsingle complaint or combined monitoring reports \nfor multiple complaints. \n\n176.  Step 5: Conclusion of the problem solv-\ning  process.  When  the  monitoring  has  been \ncompleted,  the  SPF  will  prepare  a  final  report \nand submit it to the President, the complainants, \nthe  borrower,  the  operations  department,  the \nCRP,  the  BCRC,  and  the  Board  for  information.  \nThe  SPF  can  either  produce  a  final  report  for  a \nsingle  complaint  or  a  combined  final  report  for \nmultiple complaints.\n\nThe Compliance Review Function\n\n177.  The  complainants  will  be  informed  about \nwhether  the  Board  has  authorized  the  compli-\nance review they have requested about 70 days \nafter receipt of the CRO\u2019s notification of registra-\ntion of the complaint. They will be informed of \nthe  outcome  of  the  Board  decision  on  the  CRP \nfinal  report  about  200  days  after  the  receipt  of \nthe notification of registration of the complaint. \nThese  periods  exclude  time  for  translation,  any \nrequest  for  extension  to  provide  information  or \nfile  documents,  and  the  time  for  conducting \nthe compliance review, which is not time-bound \n(paras. 184\u2013185). \n\n178.  Step  1:  Requesting  Management \nresponse.  After  acknowledging  the  complaint, \nthe  CRP  will  carry  out  the  initial  assessment \n\n34\n\n\fThe Revised Accountability Mechanism Policy\n\nand  confirm  whether  the  complaint  falls  within \nthe  mandate  of  the  compliance  review  func-\ntion  within  5  days  of  receiving  the  complaint \nforwarded by the CRO. After satisfying this, the \nCRP will forward the complaint to Management \nand  request  a  response  within  21  days.  In  its \nresponse,  Management  must  provide  evidence \nthat (i) ADB has complied with the relevant ADB \npolicies and procedures; or (ii) there are serious \nfailures  attributable  exclusively  to  ADB\u2019s  actions \nor  omissions  in  complying  with  its  policies  and \nprocedures,  but  Management  intends  to  take \nactions  to  ensure  compliance,  as  appropriate. \nThe CRP will copy the BCRC in its correspondence \nwith  the  Management.  The  CRP  will  inform \nthe  DMC  and  the  Board  member  representing  \nthe  DMC  concerned  about  receipt  of  the  com-\nplaint. The CRP should ascertain whether confi-\ndentiality is being requested by the complainants  \nand  take  the  necessary  actions  to  ensure  \nsuch confidentiality.\n\n179.  Step  2:  Determining  eligibility.  Within \n21 days of receiving the Management\u2019s response, \nthe CRP will determine the eligibility of the com-\nplaint.45  The  CRP  will  review  the  complaint,  \nManagement\u2019s  response,  and  other  relevant \ndocuments.  To  find  a  complaint  eligible,  the \nCRP  must  be  satisfied  that  the  complaint  meets \nall  the  eligibility  criteria,  satisfies  the  scope,  and \ndoes not fall within the exclusions (para. 142 and \nparas. 145\u2013149). The CRP must be satisfied that \n(i) there is evidence of noncompliance; (ii) there is \nevidence that the noncompliance has caused, or \nis likely to cause, direct and material harm to proj-\nect-affected people; and (iii) the noncompliance is \nserious enough to warrant a compliance review. \n\n180.  As  part  of  the  eligibility  determination, \nthe  CRP  will  review  and  determine  whether  the \ncomplainants  made  prior  good  faith  efforts  to \nresolve  issues  with  the  operations  department \nconcerned.  The  CRP  will  forward  the  complaint \nto  the  operations  department  concerned  if  the \ncomplainants did not make such efforts. \n\n181.  The CRP will inform the complainants, the \nborrower,  the  Board  member  representing  the \nborrowing country, Management, and the oper-\nations  department  concerned  of  its  determina-\ntion concerning eligibility. \n\n182.  Step  3:  Board  authorization  of  compli-\nance  review.  The  CRP  will  submit  its  eligibility \nreport  through  the  BCRC  to  the  Board,  attach-\ning the complaint and Management\u2019s response. \nIf  the  CRP  determines  that  the  complaint  is  eli-\ngible, it will recommend, through the BCRC, that \nthe Board authorize a compliance review. Within \n21  calendar  days  from  receipt  of  the  CRP\u2019s  \nrecommendation, the Board will decide whether \nto  authorize  the  compliance  review  on  a  \nno-objection  basis  and  without  making  a  judg-\nment  on  the  merits  of  the  complaint.  Within \n7 days from receipt of the Board\u2019s authorization, \nthe  OCRP  will  inform  the  complainants  of  the \nBoard\u2019s decision. \n\n183.  Step  4:  Conducting  compliance  review. \nThe  BCRC  will  clear  the  compliance  review  TOR \nprepared  by  the  CRP.  The  TOR  will  include  the \nscope,  methodology,  estimated  review  time \nframe,  budget,  CRP  member(s),  and  other \nnecessary  information  for  the  review.  Within \n10  days  from  the  receipt  of  the  Board\u2019s  autho-\nrization  to  conduct  the  compliance  review,  the \nTOR  will  be  provided  to  the  Board  and  copied  \nto Management. \n\n184.  The CRP will begin the compliance review \nupon receiving the Board\u2019s authorization of the \ncompliance  review  and  the  BCRC\u2019s  clearance  of \nthe TOR. The time required for the CRP\u2019s review \nwill  vary  depending  on  the  nature,  complexity, \nand  scope  of  the  project  and  the  alleged  non-\ncompliance.  Throughout  the  compliance  review \nprocess, the CRP will consult, as appropriate, all \nrelevant  parties  concerned,  including  the  com-\nplainants,  the  borrower,  the  Board  member  \nrepresenting \nconcerned, \nManagement,  and  staff.  They  will  be  given  an \n\ncountry \n\nthe \n\n45  The forwarding of the complaint by the CRO to the CRP does not constitute a determination of the eligibility of the complaint.\n\n35\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nopportunity  to  record  their  views,  if  any.  The \ncompliance  review  may  include  desk  reviews, \nmeetings, discussions, and a site visit. \n\n185.  Step  5:  Compliance  Review  Panel\u2019s \ndraft  report.  Upon  completion  of  its  compli-\nance review, the CRP will issue a draft report of \nits  findings  to  the  complainants,  the  borrower, \nand  Management  for  comments  and  responses \nwithin  45  days.  The  CRP  will  also  forward  the \ndraft report to the BCRC for its review. Each party \nwill  be  free  to  provide  comments,  but  only  the \nCRP\u2019s final view on these matters will be reflected \nin its final report.\n\n186.  The  CRP  compliance  review  report  will \nfocus on the specific complaint. It will document \nthe  CRP\u2019s  findings  concerning  any  noncompli-\nance,  and  alleged  direct  and  material  harm.  It \nwill include all relevant facts that are needed to \nfully  understand  the  context  and  basis  for  the \nCRP\u2019s  findings  and  conclusions.  It  will  focus  on \nwhether  ADB  failed  to  comply  with  its  opera-\ntional  policies  and  procedures  in  formulating, \nprocessing, or implementing the project in rela-\ntion  to  the  alleged  direct  and  material  harm.  It \nwill also ascertain whether the alleged direct and \nmaterial harm exists. If noncompliance is found \nand the alleged direct and material harm is con-\nfirmed, the report will focus on establishing the \nnoncompliance as a cause for the alleged harm. \n\n187.  For assessing direct and material harm, the \nwithout-project situation will be used as the base \ncase for comparison, taking into consideration the \navailability of information. Non-accomplishments \nand unfulfilled expectations that do not generate \ndirect and material harm compared to the with-\nout-project situation will be excluded.46 Because \nthe assessment of direct and material harm in the \ncontext of the complex reality of a specific project \ncan be difficult, the CRP will exercise careful judg-\nment on these matters and will be guided by ADB \npolicies and procedures where relevant. \n\n188.  Step 6: Compliance Review Panel\u2019s final \nreport. Within 14 days of receiving the responses \nto the CRP\u2019s draft report from the complainants, \nthe  borrower,  and  Management,  the  CRP  will \nconsider  these  responses  and  make  changes  as \nnecessary  before  the  CRP  issues  its  final  report \nto the Board through the BCRC. The CRP\u2019s final \nreport  will  attach  the  responses  from  the  com-\nplainants, the borrower, and Management, and \na matrix prepared by the CRP summarizing how \nit  has  responded  to  such  responses.  The  CRP\u2019s \nfindings will be reached by consensus among the \npanel members. In the absence of a consensus, \nthe majority and minority views will be stated.\n\n189.  Step  7:  Board  consideration  of  the \nCompliance  Review  Panel  Report.  Within  \n21  calendar  days  of  receiving  the  CRP\u2019s  final \nreport, the Board will consider the report. Within \n7  days  after  the  Board\u2019s  consideration,  the \nCRP\u2019s  final  report,  with  the  responses  from  the \ncomplainants,  the  borrower,  and  Management \nattached,  will  be  released  to  the  complainants \nand the borrower.\n\n190.  Step 8: Management\u2019s remedial actions. \nIf the CRP concludes that ADB\u2019s noncompliance \ncaused  direct  and  material  harm,  Management \nwill  propose  remedial  actions47  to  bring  the \nproject  into  compliance  with  ADB  policies  and \naddress  related  findings  of  harm.  Because  the \nlegal  ownership  of  the  project  lies  with  the \nborrower,  which  also  has  the  principal  respon-\nsibility  for  implementing  the  remedial  actions, \nManagement must obtain the agreement of the \nborrower on the remedial actions. Management \nmay consult the CRP in developing the remedial \nactions. Management will refer its draft remedial \nactions to the CRP and seek its comments to be \nprovided within 5 days. Upon receiving the CRP \ncomments,  Management  will  submit  a  report \non the proposed remedial actions to the Board, \nattaching  the  CRP  comments.  The  report  will \ninclude the parties responsible for implementing \n\n46  During the eligibility determination or the compliance review, if the CRP finds that the alleged direct and material adverse \neffect is not totally or partially caused by ADB\u2019s noncompliance, its eligibility determination and/or compliance review report \nwill state this without analyzing the direct and material adverse effect itself or its causes.\n\n47  These may include an action plan.\n\n36\n\n\fThe Revised Accountability Mechanism Policy\n\nthe remedial actions, estimates of costs to imple-\nment the remedial actions, and parties to shoul-\nder  the  costs.  The  expected  duration  between \nthe  Board\u2019s  consideration  of  the  CRP  final \ncompliance  review  report  and  Management\u2019s  \nsubmission of the proposed remedial actions to \nthe Board is 60 days. \n\n191.  Step  9:  Board\u2019s  decision.  The  Board  will \nconsider  Management\u2019s  proposed \nremedial \nactions  within  21  calendar  days  of  receiving \nthem.  The  Board  will  make  a  decision  regard-\ning  the  remedial  actions  to  bring  the  project \ninto  compliance  and/or  mitigate  any  harm,  as \nappropriate. Within 7 days after the Board\u2019s con-\nsideration,  the  Board\u2019s  decision,  Management\u2019s \nremedial actions, and the CRP comments will be \nreleased to the complainants and the borrower.  \n\n192.  Step 10: Monitoring and conclusion. The \nCRP will monitor implementation of any remedial \nactions approved by the Board. It will report to \nthe  Board  concerning  implementation  of  Board \ndecisions related to remedial measures, including \nits determination on the progress in bringing the \nproject into compliance. \n\n193.  Any remedial actions in relation to project \nscope or implementation approved by the Board \nwill be carried out in accordance with applicable \nADB  policies  and  procedures.  Unless  the  Board \nspecifies a different timetable, the CRP will report \non the progress annually. The CRP chair, in con-\nsultation  with  the  BCRC,  will  determine  which \nCRP member(s) will conduct the monitoring exer-\ncise each year. The monitoring time frame will be \nproject-specific  depending  on  the  implementa-\ntion of the remedial actions, but will generally not \nexceed  3  years.  The  final  monitoring  report  will \nalso conclude the compliance review process. \n\n194.  The  methodology \nfor  monitoring \nmay  include  (i)  consultations  with  the  com-\nplainants,  the  borrower,  the  Board  member  \nconcerned; Management; and staff; (ii) a review \nof  documents;  and  (iii)  site  visits.  The  CRP  will \nalso consider any information received from the  \ncomplainants and the public regarding the status \n\nof implementation. The CRP will forward its draft \nmonitoring reports to the BCRC for review. It will \nfinalize the reports in consultation with the BCRC \nbefore  making  them  available  to  the  complain-\nants,  the  borrower,  the  Board,  Management, \nstaff, and the public. \n\nOperations Departments\u2019 Tracking of \nComplaints and Roles\n\n195.  Operations departments will address prob-\nlems  or  issues  relating  to  complaints  forwarded \nto  them  by  the  OSPF  or  CRP  because  the  com-\nplainants  did  not  make  prior  good  faith  efforts \nto solve the problems or issues with the depart-\nments. Operations departments should ascertain \nwhether confidentiality is being requested by the \ncomplainants  and  take  the  necessary  actions  to \nensure  such  confidentiality.  Operations  depart-\nments will track the process and results in resolving  \nthese  complaints.  They  can  develop  a  tracking \nsystem.  In  doing  so,  they  may  take  advantage  \nof the existing project complaint tracking systems, \nsuch as the system developed by the OSPF in 2009 \nin  collaboration  with  the  Office  of  Information \nSystems  and  Technology  and  the  India  Resident \nMission. Operations departments, including resi-\ndent  missions,  are  encouraged  to  keep  records \nof meetings, correspondence, and other relevant \ninformation regarding complaints. \n\n196.  At the end of the process of addressing the \nineligible complaints forwarded to the operations \ndepartments by the OSPF or CRP, the operations \ndepartment  will  produce  a  report  summarizing \nthe  complaint,  issues,  actions  taken  to  address \nthe problems or issues, decisions or agreements \nby parties concerned, results, and lessons. \n\n197.  Operations  departments  play  an  essential \nrole in problem prevention, problem solving, and \nensuring compliance, as follows:\n\n(i)  As  a  part  of  project  design  and  imple-\nmentation,  operations  departments \nengage  in  day-to-day  problem  preven-\ntion, problem solving, and prevention of \nnoncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  operational \npolicies and procedures. \n\n37\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\n(ii)  During  the  Accountability  Mechanism \nprocesses, operations departments con-\ntribute to smooth problem solving, and \nprovide  necessary  cooperation  for  the \neffective compliance review. \n\n(iii)  Operations departments are a key party \nimplementation  of \nin  ensuring  the \nthe  remedial  actions  as  a  result  of  the \nAccountability Mechanism processes. \n\nsite visits\n\n198.  Site  visits  should  be  a  routine  and  non-\nthe  Accountability \ncontroversial  aspect  of \nMechanism.  ADB  will  adopt  a  partnership \napproach to help ensure that necessary site visits \nby  the  CRP  take  place.  Goodwill  and  collabora-\ntion between the CRP and the borrowing coun-\ntries  will  be  necessary.  Site  visits  will  take  place \nin consultation with the borrowing country and \nafter obtaining the borrowing country\u2019s consent \nfor both sovereign and nonsovereign operations. \nADB  expects  borrowing  countries  to  cooperate \nand allow site visits to take place.\n\n199.  The  CRP  is  responsible  for  arranging  site \nvisits and ensuring the independence of the pro-\ncess.  Management  and  staff,  especially  those \nin resident missions, will facilitate the CRP visits \nwhen required and when requested by the CRP. \nResident  missions  may  assist  in  obtaining  the \nborrowing  country  government\u2019s  consent,  and \nmay  share  the  site  visit  and  compliance  review \nTOR  with  the  borrowing  country  government. \nThe TOR will clearly explain why a site visit is nec-\nessary, what will be reviewed, and how it will be \nconducted. The scope of the TOR will be limited \nto  the  specific  complaint.  The  CRP  is  encour-\naged  to  seek  the  assistance  of  the  ADB  Board \nmember  representing  the  borrowing  country, \nand will share the TOR with the Board member \nbefore submitting a mission request to the DMC \nthrough the resident mission. \n\n200.  If a site visit is declined, Management will \ndiscuss  with  the  borrowing  country  the  rea-\nsons  for  not  accepting  the  requested  visit.  In \nconsultation  with  the  BCRC  and  the  borrowing  \ncountry, Management will convey the reasons to \nthe Board through an information paper. \n\n201.  If a site visit is declined, the CRP will com-\nplete the compliance review and deliver its find-\nings and final views without a site visit. The CRP \nwill use all available information, and may make \nappropriate  assumptions  and  draw  appropriate \ninferences in completing the compliance review. \nThe CRP will present the best and most detailed \nanalysis possible after exhausting the most cost-\neffective and logical alternative means to acquire \nthe  necessary  information.  In  the  absence  of  a \nnecessary  site  visit,  the  CRP  may  give  added \nweight to the complainants\u2019 views. \n\ntransparency and \ninformation\u00a0Disclosure\n\n202.  The  OSPF  and  CRP  operations  will  be  as \ntransparent  as  possible,  both  within  ADB  and \nwith  the  public.  Information  disclosure  to  the \npublic will be consistent with the fundamentals \nof the Public Communications Policy (2011). The \nproposed disclosure requirements are set out in \nAppendix 9.\n\n203.  A common ADB Accountability Mechanism \nwebsite will be set up within the ADB website to \ndisseminate  information  on  both  problem  solv-\ning and compliance review to enable easy access \nand  ensure  synergy.  The  OSPF  and  OCRP  will \nhave their own components within this common \nwebsite.  Any  other  information  related  to  the \nAccountability Mechanism will also be posted on \nthe common Accountability Mechanism website.48 \nThe common pages (the so-called landing pages) \nlinking  the  OSPF  and  OCRP  components,  and \nother  information  related  to  the  Accountability  \n\n48  The OSPF and CRP currently have separate websites, with information on the Accountability Mechanism scattered between \nthem  as  well  as  other  websites.  This  fragmented  arrangement  will  be  rectified  by  having  one  Accountability  Mechanism  \nwebsite within ADB\u2019s public website. \n\n38\n\n\fThe Revised Accountability Mechanism Policy\n\nMechanism  within  the  site,  will  be  regularly \nupdated  and  improved.  The  OSPF  and  CRP  will \neach  have  distinctive  logos  and  letterheads,  but \ntheir logos and letterheads will be placed under \na common ADB Accountability Mechanism logo \nand  letterhead.  The  OSPF  and  OCRP  outreach \nto the public will include an introduction to the \nAccountability Mechanism in general, while also \nfocusing on specific subjects. \n\n204.  The  nature  of  problem  solving  and  com-\npliance  review  demands  an  appropriate  degree \nof  confidentiality.  For  example,  general  descrip-\ntions about the process and final solution can be \nmade  public,  but  substantive  details  about  the \ndiscussions should be kept confidential. The final \nagreement and resolution will also be kept confi-\ndential if the parties so request. Any information \nsubmitted to the OSPF or OCRP on a confidential \nbasis  may  not  be  released  to  any  other  parties \nwithout  the  consent  of  the  party  that  submit-\nted  it.  When  requested,  the  SPF  and  CRP  may \nwithhold the identities of the complainants from \nother stakeholders. \n\n205.  The SPF and CRP chair will have the author-\nity to issue press releases and public communica-\ntions, as appropriate. Before doing so, the SPF or \nCRP will inform DER, not for purposes of review, \nbut  to  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  \nprepare responses to queries from the media or \nthe public. \n\n206.  The SPF and CRP, and all staff working on \nthe Accountability Mechanism, will exercise dis-\ncretion and maintain a low profile while making \nsite visits or otherwise operating in the borrowing \ncountry. The SPF and CRP will not give any media \ninterviews  at  any  stage  of  the  Accountability \nMechanism process.\n\nApplication\n\n207.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  applies  to \nall  ADB-assisted  sovereign  and  nonsovereign \noperations.  In  cases  where  country  safeguard \nsystems  are  used  for  ADB-assisted  projects  in \n\naccordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009),  the  use  of  the  country  safeguard  sys-\ntems will not alter the role and function of ADB\u2019s \nAccountability Mechanism, including the role of \nthe  OSPF  and  CRP.  In  the  event  of  a  claim,  the \nCRP  could  examine  ADB\u2019s  assessment  of  the \nequivalence  between  ADB\u2019s  policy  scope,  trig-\ngers, and applicable principles with the country \nsafeguard systems (and any additional measures \nagreed upon to achieve equivalence) in materially \nachieving the objectives of the Safeguard Policy \nStatement, as well as ADB\u2019s project supervision in \naccordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement \n(para.  20,  page  81).  The  Accountability \nMechanism will also apply to ADB-administered \ncofinancing operations. \n\nAwareness and learning\n\n208.  The  OSPF  and  OCRP  should  update  their \noutreach strategies regularly (for example, every \n3 years). The OSPF, OCRP, and staff should under-\ntake three kinds of outreach activities to achieve \na positive culture change.\n\n209.  Internal.  This  outreach  should  improve \nawareness and disseminate lessons to ADB staff \nthrough workshops, training courses, and orien-\ntation  sessions.  The  Accountability  Mechanism \nshould be included as part of regular staff train-\ning.  The  Accountability  Mechanism  should  be \nseen  as  an  important  instrument  for  learning, \nand  for  ensuring  project  quality  and  develop-\nment  effectiveness.  The  SPF  and  OSPF,  the  CRP \nand  OCRP,  staff,  Management,  and  the  Board \nshould all promote a culture change to eliminate \nthe remaining perception that the Accountability \nMechanism is adversarial. \n\n210.  National level. The OSPF and OCRP should \nhold  regular  dissemination  activities  in  DMCs. \nThey should distribute simple, pictorial-based and \nuser-friendly  descriptions  of  the  mechanism.  In \neach resident mission, a staff member should be \ndesignated as a focal person for handling griev-\nances  caused  by  ADB  financed  projects.  Some \nresident  missions  have  already  assigned  such \n\n39\n\n\fAccountability Mechanism Policy 2012\n\nfocal  persons;  this  practice  should  be  extended \nto all resident missions. \n\n211.  Project level. Improving the awareness of \nthe Accountability Mechanism requires that ADB \nstaff  work  as  conduits  to  disseminate  informa-\ntion.  Staff,  working  with  the  borrower,  will  dis-\nseminate  information  early  in  the  project  cycle \nabout  the  Accountability  Mechanism  and  its \navailability  as  a  recourse  in  case  other  mecha-\nnisms for dealing with harmful project effects are \nnot  successful.  The  intensity  and  format  of  this \nactivity  will  vary  with  the  nature  of  the  project. \nOperations  departments  will  focus  on  projects \nwith  a  high  degree  of  safeguard  risks,  such  as \nprojects  with  heavy  resettlement.  Pamphlets  in \nnational or official languages, community notice \nboards, audiovisual materials, or other appropri-\nate  and  effective  means  will  be  used  to  inform \npeople. The Safeguard Policy Statement requires \nthat grievance redress mechanisms be set up at \nthe project level. It also requires government staff \nand/or project proponents working on the griev-\nance redress mechanisms to organize awareness \nseminars in coordination with resident missions, \nproject teams, local government units, and exe-\ncuting  agencies.  ADB  can  explore  the  possibil-\nity of outsourcing outreach activities to credible \nNGOs or civil society organizations. Gender issues \nwill be taken into consideration when designing \nthe outreach strategy.\n\n212.  The  joint  learning  reports  by  the  OSPF, \nOCRP, IED, and RSDD will distill ADB\u2019s experience, \ninsights, and lessons, including the Accountability \nMechanism\u2019s  development  impacts,  benefits, \nand costs. The Accountability Mechanism annual \nreports will (i) outline key activities and outputs \nof  the  Accountability  Mechanism;  (ii)  summa-\nrize  the  complaints;  (iii)  analyze  the  develop-\nment  impact  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism; \n(iv)  discuss  the  benefits;  (v)  record  and  monitor \nthe direct and indirect costs on project-affected \npeople, the borrowers, and ADB for each project; \nand  (vi)  provide  other  relevant  information  and \nanalysis. To guide future policy design and imple-\nmentation, Management will engage expert(s) to \nundertake  a  study  on  the  benefits  and  costs  of \nthe revised Accountability Mechanism.49\n\neffective Date and \ntransition\u00a0Period\n\n213.  The  revised  Accountability  Mechanism \nwill  become  effective  3  months  after  the  date \nof the Board of Directors\u2019 approval of the policy, \nsuperseding the 2003 Accountability Mechanism \npolicy (footnote 2).50 Complaints and/or requests \nfiled  before  the  effectiveness  of  the  revised \nAccountability  Mechanism  policy  will  follow \nthe  2003  Accountability  Mechanism  policy  and \nrelated procedures. \uf03c\n\n49  This is akin to a regulatory impact assessment. The study will assess the impacts of both the 2003 Accountability Mechanism \nand the revised Accountability Mechanism policy. It will analyze the incremental impacts induced by the changes introduced \nin the revised policy. In analyzing the costs, the study will especially cover items (vii) and (viii) in the terms of reference on the \nreview of the Accountability Mechanism (para. 5, Appendix 1).\n\n50  The 2003 policy requires the OSPF and CRP to prepare operating and administrative procedures. These procedures are not \nrecommended under this revised policy to reduce duplication and increase transparency. Any necessary operating and admin-\nistrative procedures will be reflected in the policy and/or the Operations Manual.\n\n40\n\n\fResource Implications\n\n6\n\n214.  The proposed changes in the Accountability \nMechanism policy are expected to have resource \nimplications for ADB in the following areas: \n\n(i)  More  outreach  activities  will  require \nadditional  resources.  The  OSPF  and \nOCRP spent about $130,000 in 2010 on \noutreach.  Assuming  that  the  outreach \nexpenditures were to double, an annual \nincremental cost of about $130,000 will \nbe required.  \n\n(ii)  The proposal that each resident mission \nassign  a  staff  member  as  a  focal  per-\nson  for  handling  grievances  caused  by \nADB  financed  projects  will  mean  addi-\ntional costs. Some resident missions will \nassign  existing  staff  as  the  focal  per-\nsons.  However,  some  resident  missions \nwill require additional staff. The annual \nincremental cost for the focal persons is \nestimated to be $220,000.\n\n(iii)  The engagement of a full-time CRO will \nrequire  additional  costs.  The  estimated \nannual cost will be $50,000. \n\n(iv)  Some costs will be reduced because the \nOCRP  will  have  one  fewer  international \nstaff member and one fewer administra-\ntive or national staff member. The reduc-\ntion is estimated to be $250,000. \n\n215.  The  net  annual  cost  increase  from  these \nitems  is  estimated  to  be  $150,000.51  Thus,  the \noverall  budget  implications  from  the  policy \nchanges are expected to be moderate. This esti-\nmate  represents  the  direct  operating  costs  to \nADB.  Other  direct  and  indirect  costs  to  project-\naffected people, DMCs, and ADB will depend on \nthe number and nature of the complaints. \uf03c\n\n51  The cost estimation does not include annual increases because of inflation and salary adjustments. These incremental costs \n\nneed to be added during the implementation of the revised Accountability Mechanism policy.\n\n41\n\n\f7\n\nRecommendation \n\n216.  The President recommends that the Board \napprove  the  revised  Accountability  Mechanism \npolicy as described in Section 5 of this paper. \uf03c\n\n42\n\n\fAppendix 1 \nTerms of Reference for Review of the \nAccountability Mechanism\n\n1. \nIn 1995, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) established its Inspection Function \nto provide a forum for project beneficiaries to appeal to an independent body regard-\ning matters relating to ADB\u2019s compliance with its operational policies and procedures \nin ADB-assisted projects.1 In 2003, following an extensive review, ADB introduced the  \ncurrent  Accountability  Mechanism,2  building  on  the \nInspection  Function.  The \nAccountability Mechanism was designed to enhance ADB\u2019s development effectiveness \nand project quality; be responsive to the concerns of project-affected people and fair to \nall stakeholders; reflect the highest professional and technical standards in ADB staffing \nand operations; be as independent and transparent as possible; and be cost-effective, \nefficient, and complementary to the other supervision, audit, quality control, and evalua-\ntion systems already in place at ADB. The Accountability Mechanism was declared effec-\ntive on 12 December 2003. At the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of \nADB  in  Tashkent,  Uzbekistan  in  May  2010,  the  President  announced  that  ADB  would \nundertake  a  review  of  its  Accountability  Mechanism.  A  joint  Board  and  Management \nworking group was subsequently established for this purpose. 52 53 \n\nThe  objective  of  the  review  is  to  examine  the  scope  for  improvements  in  the \n2. \nAccountability Mechanism. The review will be broad-based and include the following \naspects:\n\n(i)  an analysis of the effectiveness and adequacy of the Accountability Mechanism \nin light of its historical perspectives and objectives, and the principles contextu-\nalized in the 2003 Accountability Mechanism policy;\n\n(ii)  an  evaluation  of  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  the  Accountability  Mechanism  since \n2003,  reflecting  the  changing  context  of  ADB  operations,  especially  the  \nadoption of Strategy 2020; 3 54 \n\n(iii)  comparison  and  analysis  of  ADB\u2019s  Accountability  Mechanism  with  other  \n\nrelevant comparators;\n\n(iv)  consultation  with  stakeholders  including  the  public,  project-affected  people,  \ngovernments,  ADB  Board  members,  Management,  operations  staff,  and  \nnongovernment and civil society organizations;\n\n(v)  the addressing of key issues arising out of the analysis, comparison, evaluation, \n\nand consultation; and\n\n(vi)  recommendations, based on this analysis, for changes and improvements in the \npolicies,  the  functioning  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism,  and  its  operating \nand administrative procedures.\n\n1  ADB. 1995.

The \nfirst  phase  will  be  inviting  public  comments  on  the  Accountability  Mechanism  policy \nthrough the ADB website. The second phase will be country consultations in developed \nand developing member countries. The proposed locations were Frankfurt, Islamabad, \nJakarta,  Manila,  Tokyo,  and  Washington,  DC.4  Consultation  will  include  governments, \nnongovernment organizations, the private sector, and, where possible, project beneficia-\nries and affected people. The third phase will be an invitation for public comments on the \nworking group report through the ADB website, for which a dedicated Accountability \nMechanism review website was established. 55  \n\n4. \n\n(i) \n\nThe following key issues were included in the external experts\u2019 terms of references:\nthe approach to site visits under the existing Accountability Mechanism, which \nrequires permission from the borrowing country to carry out site visits;\n\n(ii)  limited recourse to the compliance review phase;\n(iii)  the mechanism\u2019s degree of independence, including reporting lines, ownership, \nand dissemination of Accountability Mechanism documents and materials, as \nwell as issues of budgeting, staffing, performance assessment, access to inde-\npendent legal advice, and the right to engage experts and consultants;\n\n(iv)  affected people\u2019s access to the mechanism;\n(v)  eligibility criteria for filing a complaint; \n(vi)  the  effectiveness  of  the  Office  of  the  Compliance  Review  Panel  and  ADB  in  \ndisseminating  information  and  conducting  public  outreach,  indicated  by  \nawareness of the ADB Accountability Mechanism;\n\n(vii) an assessment of the implications of bringing projects into compliance in terms \n\nof time required, delays, and increased financial costs;\n\n(viii) the  concerns  of  developing  member  countries  in  particular  and  the  broader \nimpact  that  the  Accountability  Mechanism  has  had  on  ADB\u2019s  approach  to  \ndecision making and project selection;\n\n(ix)  from  the  experience  of  ADB  and  similar  institutions,  the  extent  of  benefits \n\nobtained by complainants and/or adversely affected people; and\n\n(x)  any  other \n\nissues \n\nviewed  as \n\nimportant \n\nfor \n\nimproving \n\nthe  ADB  \n\nAccountability Mechanism.\n\n4 \n\nIslamabad was later replaced with Colombo, Sri Lanka because of flooding in Pakistan in late 2010. \n\n44\n\n\fAppendix 2 \nSummary of the Consultation Process\n\n1. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  committed to  consulting  all  stakeholders \nto  ensure  the  quality  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism  review.  As  an  integral  part  of \nthe  review,  ADB  carried  out  intensive  and  extensive  public  consultations  beginning  in \nJune 2010. \n\n2. \n\nThe consultation process included \n\n(i)  consulting with all Board members, Management, and a large number of staff \n\nin both headquarters and field offices;\n\n(ii)  consulting a broad spectrum of external stakeholders, including project-affected \npeople,  project  beneficiaries,  project  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  \ngovernments,  nongovernment  organizations,  the  private  sector,  academia, \nthink  tanks,  and  people  working  on  accountability  mechanisms  of  other \ninstitutions; \n\n(iii)  holding  in-country  and  regional  consultations  in  six  countries\u2014Germany, \nIndonesia,  Japan,  the  Philippines,  Sri  Lanka,  and  the  United  States\u2014and  \nconsulting Canadian stakeholders through a videoconference; \n\n(iv)  establishing  a  dedicated  website  for  the  review \n\n(http://www.adb.org/ \nAM-Review/)  and  posting  four  papers  for  public  comments  on  the  review \nwebsite: (a) the 2003 Accountability Mechanism policy, which was posted for \n12 weeks from June to September 2010; (b) the review\u2019s first consultation policy,  \nposted for 8 weeks from February to April 2011; (c) the working paper, posted \nfor 1 month from April to June 2011; and (d) the second consultation paper, \nposted from July to August 2011; and  \n\n(v)  posting all public comments received on the review website, along with summa-\nries of in-country consultations; and the external experts\u2019 issues paper, presenta-\ntions, and various drafts of the review reports.\n\nThe  working  group  on  the  review  was  highly  transparent  throughout  the \n3. \nAccountability Mechanism review process. The Accountability Mechanism review web-\nsite includes information on the composition of the working group, the review terms of \nreference, the review timetable, the external experts\u2019 issues paper, the external experts\u2019 \nreport, and various drafts of the review paper. All the draft policy papers were released \nto the public on the same day as they were circulated to the Board for consideration. \nImportant documents, such as the consultation policy paper, were translated into sev-\neral languages of developing member countries (DMCs). To ensure wide participation, \ninvitations  to  comment  on  the  Accountability  Mechanism  policy  drafts  and  participa-\ntion in in-country workshops were extended to all interested stakeholders by posting it \non the Accountability Mechanism review website. ADB provided written responses on \nkey  points  received  from  the  consultation  process  and  released  them  on  the  review\u2019s \n\n45\n\n\fAppendix 2\n\n46\n\nwebsite. ADB acknowledges with thanks the inputs of all workshop participants and all \ncontributors who provided comments during the consultations.\n\n4. \nSince June 2010, the working group has frequently held meetings to discuss the \nissues,  public  consultations,  options,  and  the  direction  of  the  review.  The  Board  met \nthree times in informal Board seminars to discuss the terms of reference of the review, \nthe external experts\u2019 review report, and the working group\u2019s consultation policy paper. \n\n5. \nThe review paid special attention to reaching project-affected people. The review \nmission met with project-affected people, project beneficiaries in general, and those who \nrequested meetings in the DMCs it visited. To learn from similar mechanisms, the review \nmission met with the people working on the accountability mechanisms of the World \nBank,  International  Finance  Cooperation,  European  Investment  Bank,  Inter-American \nDevelopment  Bank,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  and  Overseas  Private \nInvestment  Corporation  of  the  United  States.  The  mission  also  met  with  staff  of  the \nUnited States Agency for International Development. The outcome of all public consul-\ntations, including a summary and presentation of group findings in the workshops, are \nposted on the review\u2019s website.\n\nConsultations  were  fruitful  and  benefited  from  the  wide  participation  of  stake-\n6. \nholders. Feedback reinforces the validity of problem solving and compliance review in \nthe  ADB  Accountability  Mechanism.  Both  functions  are  seen  as  integral  parts  of  the \nAccountability Mechanism that effectively complement each other. Many stakeholders \nacknowledged  the  innovation  and  many  other  strengths  of  the  2003  Accountability \nMechanism.  While  stakeholders  agree  on  many  issues,  there  is  much  debate  on \nsome others: \n\n(i)  Site  visits.  While  some  stakeholders  believe  site  visits  should  be  mandatory, \nothers  argue  they  should  take  place  only  with  the  consent  of  the  borrowing \ncountry. \n\n(ii)  Direct  access  to  the  compliance  review  phase.  Some  stakeholders  consider \nit desirable and logical to start with the problem solving function. Others hold \nthat affected people should be able to choose which function to start with. \n(iii)  Eligibility criteria for filing complaints. Some stakeholders suggest that cutoff \ndates for filing complaints should be clarified and extended beyond the issu-\nance of the project completion report, that individuals should be allowed to file \ncomplaints  instead  of  the  current  minimum  requirement  of  two  people,  and \nthat people who are indirectly and not materially harmed should be able to file \ncomplaints. Other stakeholders consider current eligibility criteria to be sound. \n(iv)  Mandate  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism.  Some  stakeholders  suggest \nthat  the  mandate  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism  should  be  expanded  to \ncover procurement and anticorruption measures, while others argue that the \nAccountability Mechanism should focus on solving problems and compliance \nwith  ADB  operational  policies  and  procedures,  noting  that  procurement  and \ncorruption issues are covered by other dedicated mechanisms. \n\n(v)  Number  of  requests  to  the  Compliance  Review  Panel.  Some  stakeholders \nbelieve that the sequential approach  prevented some  people  from  participat-\ning in the compliance review phase. Others argue that the sequential process is \njustified and that the limited number of compliance review cases is a result of \n\n\fSummary of the Consultation Process\n\nthe existence of other problem solving and compliance functions in projects and \noperational departments. \n\n(vi)  Costs to developing member countries. Some believe that the Accountability \nMechanism  imposes  significantly  higher  costs  on  DMCs  than  other  policies, \nsuch as safeguard policies. Others believe that the cost to ensure compliance is \nnecessary for achieving project quality. \n\n7.

It was followed by water and other municipal infrastructure and \nservices with 9 complaints. The high number of complaints in these sectors was partly \nthe result of their large portfolio of projects.

The government \nconsiders the land purchase \nillegal and not entitled under \ngovernment rules to the same \ncompensation as for residents. \nThe complainants felt this was \ninconsistent with ADB\u2019s 2004 \nresettlement plan.\n\nBy 31 March 2009, five of the seven \nhouseholds decided to accept the \ncompensation package arrived at \nthrough the mediation, but two \nhouseholds did not accept it. The \ngovernment extended the deadline \nfor accepting the package twice, but \nthe two families remained unwilling \nto accept it and submitted a request \ndated 28 April 2009 to the CRP. The \ngovernment decided to change the \ndesign for rehabilitating the river so that \nthe houses of all seven families would \nnot need to be demolished.\n\nADB closed the loan in July 2009 \nwithout construction of the wastewater \ntreatment plant, but issues of \nland acquisition payments and \ncompensation for damages remained. \nOSPF\u2019s consultant interviewed all the \ncomplainants, and the SPF met again \nwith them and the other stakeholders \nin October 2011. It was agreed that \nfinal compensation payments would be \nmade, and the OSPF plans to close the \ncomplaint when payments have been \ncompleted. Problem solving is ongoing. \n\nThe OSPF final report stated that \nthe national law on land acquisition \nstipulated that only the courts could \nrevise land compensation rates, so the \nconsultations were unable to resolve \nthat issue. \n\nIn view of this, and considering that the \nproject had been closed with no clear \nindication of if or when the sewage \ntreatment plant would be built, the SPF \nconcluded that no further consultation \nwould be purposeful, and the complaint \nwas partially resolved and closed. The \nOSPF, however, made it clear that, \nshould the sewage treatment plant be \ntaken up under a new loan, and if the \ncomplainants felt they were harmed by \nan act or omission of ADB, they could \ncome back to the OSPF.\n\ncontinued on next page\n\n7.
