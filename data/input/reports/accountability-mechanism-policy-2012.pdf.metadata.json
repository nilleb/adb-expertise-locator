The President recommends that the Board \napprove the revised Accountability Mechanism \npolicy as described in Section 5 of this paper. \uf03c\n42", "Appendix 1 \nTerms of Reference for Review of the \nAccountability Mechanism\n1.  In 1995, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) established its Inspection Function \nto provide a forum for project beneficiaries to appeal to an independent body regard-\ning matters relating to ADB\u2019s compliance with its operational policies and procedures \nin ADB-assisted projects.1 In 2003, following an extensive review, ADB introduced the  \ncurrent  Accountability  Mechanism,2  building  on  the  Inspection  Function.  The \nAccountability Mechanism was designed to enhance ADB\u2019s development effectiveness \nand project quality; be responsive to the concerns of project-affected people and fair to \nall stakeholders; reflect the highest professional and technical standards in ADB staffing \nand operations; be as independent and transparent as possible; and be cost-effective, \nefficient, and complementary to the other supervision, audit, quality control, and evalua-\ntion systems already in place at ADB. The Accountability Mechanism was declared effec-\ntive on 12 December 2003. At the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of \nADB in Tashkent, Uzbekistan in May 2010, the President announced that ADB would \nundertake a review of its Accountability Mechanism. A joint Board and Management \nworking group was subsequently established for this purpose. 52 53 \n2.  The objective of the review is to examine the scope for improvements in the \nAccountability Mechanism. The review will be broad-based and include the following \naspects:\n(i)  an analysis of the effectiveness and adequacy of the Accountability Mechanism \nin light of its historical perspectives and objectives, and the principles contextu-\nalized in the 2003 Accountability Mechanism policy;\n(ii)  an evaluation of ADB\u2019s experience with the Accountability Mechanism since \n2003,  reflecting  the  changing  context  of  ADB  operations,  especially  the  \nadoption of Strategy 2020; 3 54 \n(iii) comparison  and  analysis  of  ADB\u2019s  Accountability  Mechanism  with  other  \nrelevant comparators;\n(iv) consultation with stakeholders including the public, project-affected people,  \ngovernments,  ADB  Board  members,  Management,  operations  staff,  and  \nnongovernment and civil society organizations;\n(v)  the addressing of key issues arising out of the analysis, comparison, evaluation, \nand consultation; and\n(vi) recommendations, based on this analysis, for changes and improvements in the \npolicies, the functioning of the Accountability Mechanism, and its operating \nand administrative procedures.\n1  ADB. 1995.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed to consulting all stakeholders \nto ensure the quality of the Accountability Mechanism review. As an integral part of \nthe review, ADB carried out intensive and extensive public consultations beginning in \nJune 2010. \n2.  The consultation process included \n(i)  consulting with all Board members, Management, and a large number of staff \nin both headquarters and field offices;\n(ii)  consulting a broad spectrum of external stakeholders, including project-affected \npeople, project beneficiaries, project executing and implementing agencies,  \ngovernments, nongovernment organizations, the private sector, academia, \nthink  tanks,  and  people  working  on  accountability  mechanisms  of  other \ninstitutions; \n(iii) holding  in-country  and  regional  consultations  in  six  countries\u2014Germany, \nIndonesia,  Japan,  the  Philippines,  Sri  Lanka,  and  the  United  States\u2014and  \nconsulting Canadian stakeholders through a videoconference; \n(iv) establishing  a  dedicated  website  for  the  review  (http://www.adb.org/ \nAM-Review/) and posting four papers for public comments on the review \nwebsite: (a) the 2003 Accountability Mechanism policy, which was posted for \n12 weeks from June to September 2010; (b) the review\u2019s first consultation policy,  \nposted for 8 weeks from February to April 2011; (c) the working paper, posted \nfor 1 month from April to June 2011; and (d) the second consultation paper, \nposted from July to August 2011; and  \n(v)  posting all public comments received on the review website, along with summa-\nries of in-country consultations; and the external experts\u2019 issues paper, presenta-\ntions, and various drafts of the review reports.\n3.  The  working  group  on  the  review  was  highly  transparent  throughout  the \nAccountability Mechanism review process. The Accountability Mechanism review web-\nsite includes information on the composition of the working group, the review terms of \nreference, the review timetable, the external experts\u2019 issues paper, the external experts\u2019 \nreport, and various drafts of the review paper. All the draft policy papers were released \nto the public on the same day as they were circulated to the Board for consideration. \nImportant documents, such as the consultation policy paper, were translated into sev-\neral languages of developing member countries (DMCs). To ensure wide participation, \ninvitations to comment on the Accountability Mechanism policy drafts and participa-\ntion in in-country workshops were extended to all interested stakeholders by posting it \non the Accountability Mechanism review website. ADB provided written responses on \nkey points received from the consultation process and released them on the review\u2019s \n45", "Appendix 2\nwebsite. ADB acknowledges with thanks the inputs of all workshop participants and all \ncontributors who provided comments during the consultations.\n4.  Since June 2010, the working group has frequently held meetings to discuss the \nissues, public consultations, options, and the direction of the review. The Board met \nthree times in informal Board seminars to discuss the terms of reference of the review, \nthe external experts\u2019 review report, and the working group\u2019s consultation policy paper. \n5.  The review paid special attention to reaching project-affected people. The review \nmission met with project-affected people, project beneficiaries in general, and those who \nrequested meetings in the DMCs it visited. To learn from similar mechanisms, the review \nmission met with the people working on the accountability mechanisms of the World \nBank, International Finance Cooperation, European Investment Bank, Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation of the United States. The mission also met with staff of the \nUnited States Agency for International Development. The outcome of all public consul-\ntations, including a summary and presentation of group findings in the workshops, are \nposted on the review\u2019s website.\n6.  Consultations were fruitful and benefited from the wide participation of stake-\nholders. Feedback reinforces the validity of problem solving and compliance review in \nthe ADB Accountability Mechanism. Both functions are seen as integral parts of the \nAccountability Mechanism that effectively complement each other. Many stakeholders \nacknowledged the innovation and many other strengths of the 2003 Accountability \nMechanism.  While  stakeholders  agree  on  many  issues,  there  is  much  debate  on \nsome others: \n(i)  Site visits. While some stakeholders believe site visits should be mandatory, \nothers argue they should take place only with the consent of the borrowing \ncountry. \n(ii)  Direct access to the compliance review phase. Some stakeholders consider \nit desirable and logical to start with the problem solving function. Others hold \nthat affected people should be able to choose which function to start with. \n(iii) Eligibility criteria for filing complaints. Some stakeholders suggest that cutoff \ndates for filing complaints should be clarified and extended beyond the issu-\nance of the project completion report, that individuals should be allowed to file \ncomplaints instead of the current minimum requirement of two people, and \nthat people who are indirectly and not materially harmed should be able to file \ncomplaints. Other stakeholders consider current eligibility criteria to be sound. \n(iv) Mandate  of  the  Accountability  Mechanism.  Some  stakeholders  suggest \nthat the mandate of the Accountability Mechanism should be expanded to \ncover procurement and anticorruption measures, while others argue that the \nAccountability Mechanism should focus on solving problems and compliance \nwith ADB operational policies and procedures, noting that procurement and \ncorruption issues are covered by other dedicated mechanisms. \n(v)  Number of requests to the Compliance Review Panel. Some stakeholders \nbelieve that the sequential approach prevented some people from participat-\ning in the compliance review phase. Others argue that the sequential process is \njustified and that the limited number of compliance review cases is a result of \n46", "Summary of the Consultation Process\nthe existence of other problem solving and compliance functions in projects and \noperational departments. \n(vi) Costs to developing member countries. Some believe that the Accountability \nMechanism imposes significantly higher costs on DMCs than other policies, \nsuch as safeguard policies. Others believe that the cost to ensure compliance is \nnecessary for achieving project quality. \n7.
