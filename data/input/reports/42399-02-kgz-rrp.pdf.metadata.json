The  main  component  of  the  project  will  facilitate  more  regional  trade  and  higher \nmobility  for  the  local  people  by  improving  an  important  part  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nthe \nEconomic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Corridor  1.  The  other  component  will \nsustainability of the national road network by staff training on infrastructure management.  \n\nincrease \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3.  \nThe Kyrgyz Republic plays a crucial role in regional trade and transit traffic because its \nroads form part of the transport network in Central Asia. The condition of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s \nroad network and its management improved substantially from 2005 to 2010. However, several \ndilapidated network links and poor infrastructure management skills continue to hamper regional \ntrade  and  economic  growth. 2  The  project  will  help  the  government  make  some  of  these \nimprovements  in  accordance  with  Strategy  2020  and  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).3 \nThe project fits within ADB\u2019s Country Partnership Strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic.4 \n\n4.  \nAside  from  being  landlocked,  80%  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  land  is  covered  by  the \nTian Shan  mountain range.  Trade  and  travel  are  almost  entirely  dependent  on  road  transport. \nMore  than  90%  of  the  passenger  trips  and  about  60%  of  the  freight  in  2009  was  moved  by \nroad.5 This  has  been  made  partly  possible  by  development  partner  assistance  since  1996  to \nupgrade about 2,000 kilometers (km) of strategic roads. More roads are waiting to be improved. \nThe 539 km Bishkek\u2013Torugart road is one of them. Its surface, most bridges, and safety devices \nare  either  inadequate  or  functionally  obsolete.  Traffic  volumes  in  several  sections  exceed  the \ncapacities, causing heavy delays during the summer months, and movement in some sections \nis frequently interrupted by landslides, snow drifts, waterlogging, and flooding. \n\nThe  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  plays  several  important  functions.  It  is  part  of  the  CAREC \n5.  \nCorridor 1(c), which extends from Troitsk in the Russian Federation to Kashi in Xinjiang Uygur \nAutonomous  Region  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC);  it  is  the  shortest  thoroughfare \nfrom  Bishkek  to  Kashi;  and  the  only  north\u2013south  trunk  road  in  the  central  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nconnecting Naryn oblast (province), the poorest of the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s seven oblasts, and the \ncity  of  Naryn  to the  rest  of  the  country.6 It  is  also  the  only  road  that  provides  direct  access  at \npresent to Issyk Kul lake region, one of Central Asia\u2019s best known tourist destinations with huge \npotential  to  grow.  However,  the  costly,  slow,  unreliable,  and  unsafe  travel  caused  by  the  poor \nroad condition  has  hampered the  development of the  entire corridor,  particularly  Naryn  oblast. \nImports from the PRC continue to grow, but exports are limited to a few products because only \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  These gaps are depicted in the problem tree (Figure 1) of the Sector Assessment (Summary): Roads (accessible \n\nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n3  ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n4   ADB. Joint Country Partnership Strategy 2007\u20132010.

Washington, DC (August).  \n\n6  Corridor 1(c) connects to Corridor 2 and Corridor 5, which extend from Kabul (Afghanistan) to Hami (PRC). \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\na few local communities are able to transport their produce to the consolidation centers such as \nNaryn and At Bashi. \n\n6.  \nAlthough  the  government  prepared  the  Road  Sector  Development  Strategy  for  2007\u2013\n2010, in which the Bishkek\u2013Torugart road improvement features prominently as an action item, \nit  lacked  resources  for  implementing  the  strategy.7 As  the  country\u2019s  first  development  partner \nand  largest  multilateral  lender  to  the  road  sector,  ADB  was  first  to  offer  to  meet  part  of  the \nresource need. In 2008 and 2009, it financed the improvement of 114 km (km 365\u2013km 479) of \nthis  road.8 It  is  also  helping  the  government  through  CAREC  to  strengthen  trade  ties  with  its \nneighbors. The government of the PRC provided $200 million in 2010 to improve 223 km (from \nkm  9  to  km  272).9 Works  under  these  projects  are  progressing  mostly  on  schedule,  and  are \nexpected  to  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2014.  The  government  is  discussing  with  the  Arab \nCoordination Group a financing package of $80 million for improving 93 km (km 272\u2013km 365).10 \nIf unimproved, the 60 km section from km 479 to km 539 at the Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013PRC border \nwill be the only bottleneck in the corridor. \n\nInfrastructure  preservation  is  another  task  that  the  government  has  yet  to  accomplish \n7.  \nefficiently. Between 1996 and 2010, total investment in road improvement exceeded $1 billion\u2014\nADB  provided  about  $300  million  of  this.  However,  investment  in  preservation  was  about  $28 \nmillion  in  2009,  six  times  more  than  in  2005;  only  half  of  what  was  needed  to  keep  the \n19,000 km  network  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications \n(MOTC)  in  good  shape.  Cost  recovery  from  road  users  covers  only  a fraction  of  the  needs  at \npresent,  and  the  government  is  facing  ever-rising  construction  and  maintenance  costs. \nTherefore, more attention must be paid to preservation. For this, the government not only needs \ntools\u2014legislation,  policies,  techniques,  and  procedures\u2014but  also  skilled  staff  to  use  the  tool \nand to champion change. \n\n8.  \nThe project will help the government improve the 60 km section from At Beit to Torugart \nat  the  PRC  border, the  last  segment  of the  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road. Together  with the  ongoing \nimprovement  works  in the other  sections,  it  will  enable all-weather road  travel  from  Bishkek to \nKashi.  Aside  from  the  economic  benefits  of  higher  speeds  and  reliability,  the  better  road \ngeometry  and  protective  structures  resulting  from  the  improvement  will  reduce  the  accidental \ntoxic spill risk and material runoff from vehicles. These reductions will benefit the ecosystem of \nChatyr  Kul  Lake\u2014a  wetland  of  international  significance  that  is  protected  under  the  Ramsar \nConvention on Wetlands. \n\n                                                \n7  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, Ministry of Transport and Communications. 2007.

Manila (Loan 2533-KGZ, for $28 million, \nand Grant 0153-KGZ, for $22 million approved on 14 July).  The section from km 400 to km 439 (Torugart at the \nPRC border) is being improved under the CAREC Corridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project (Grant 0123-KGZ) \nand  the  sections  from  km  439  to  km  479  and  from  km  365  to  km  400  are  being  improved  under  the  CAREC \nCorridor 1 (Bishkek\u2013Torugart Road) Project 2 (Grant 0153/ Loan 2533). These two projects also have components \nfor  improving  border  control  facilities  at  Torugart,  formulating  a  transport  sector  masterplan,  and  establishing  a \nBishkek\u2013Torugart road corridor management department. \n\n9   Chainage starts (km 0) at the Bishkek end of the road. \n10 Arab  Coordination  Group  is  comprised  of  the  Saudi  Development  Fund,  Kuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic \n\nDevelopment, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development. \n\n\fThe project will also strengthen the infrastructure management skills of government staff \n9.  \nengaged  in  the  road  sector.  This  is  an  essential  and  natural  complement  to  the  capital \ninvestment.  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  for  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \nbuilding totaling nearly $6 million from 1996 to 2010. The World Bank and the European Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development have further assistance programmed for 2011. These are \nshort  and one-off  interventions. The  project,  in contrast,  supports  a long-term, results-oriented \nprogram of learning and development for government staff. It will result in better informed staff, \nequipped to champion strategies for reducing lifecycle costs and improving user cost recovery.11 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10.  \nThe  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  increased  regional  trade,  particularly  between  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic and the PRC. Its outcome will be higher mobility for people and goods with origins and \ndestinations  in the road corridor  between Naryn  and Torugart.12 The  project  complements  and \nutilizes the synergy created by road sector investments by other development partners.13 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n11.  \nThe project\u2019s primary output will be 60 km of two-lane Bishkek\u2013Torugart road (km 479\u2013\nkm  539)  repaired,  rehabilitated,  or  reconstructed  to  national  Category  III  road  standards  with \nspecial  structures  for  protecting  the  environment,  preserving  the  road  structure,  and  reducing \nvehicle crashes. This will be delivered through the civil works component. The other output will \nbe  improved  infrastructure  management  skills  of  MOTC  and  other  government  agency  staff. \nThis will be achieved through training, education, and mentoring from national and international \nconsultants. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n12.  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $70 million equivalent.

MOTC  will  be  the  executing  agency.  It  has  implemented  all  development  partner \nfinanced  road  projects  since  1995,  and  has  accumulated  considerable  experience.  The \ninvestment  project  implementation  group  (IPIG)  in  MOTC  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nadministration  of  project  activities. The IPIG  was established  in 1996,  and  has  since  delivered \nmore than 12 road projects valued at nearly $500 million. The IPIG has 29 full-time staff, and is \nimplementing  13 projects  with  an  estimated  total  value  of  $520  million.  Its  project  delivery \nperformance  in  terms  of  timeliness  and  final  cost  to  date  has  been  satisfactory,  and  staff  has \nadequate  technical  know-how  and  understanding  of  ADB  procedures  to  manage  the  project. \nThere are provisions in the project to enhance delivery performance in terms of timeliness and \nbudget  adherence.  MOTC  will  engage  consultants,  financed  from  the  loan,  as  and  when \nneeded,  to  assist  its  staff  with  complex  issues,  especially  those  related  to  environmental \nmanagement and ecosystem preservation. It will also engage consultants to improve staff skills \non project delivery. \n\n15.   MOTC  will  procure  civil  works  and  consulting  services  for  civil  works  supervision  from \nfirms  with  global  experience  and  proven  records  of  efficient  delivery.  The  implementation \narrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration \nmanual (PAM).14 \n\n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting services \n\n \n\n \nAdvance contracting \n\nDisbursement \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \n\n1 January 2011\u201330 September 2015 \n30 September 2015 \n\nArrangements \n\n1 design-build contract  $50.0 million \n\nMinistry of Finance \nM.

MOTC has prepared detailed design drawings, specifications, and bills of quantities for \nthe  civil  works. These  would normally  be  adequate for  an  admeasurement  contract (based  on \nbills  of  quantities).  However,  the  project  site  conditions  are  unique.  Its  elevation  is  more  than \n3,000  meters,  the  ground  there  is  permanently  frozen,  and  the  road  alignment  is  close  to  a \nunique  wetland.  Therefore,  the  current  design  will  require  numerous  changes  during \nconstruction.  Accordingly,  MOTC  will  procure  the  civil  works  using  the  design-build  project \ndelivery method according to specifications detailed in ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. This \nmethod  allows  (i)  MOTC  to  share  the  cost,  delay,  and  the  risk  of  design  changes  with  the \ncontractor; and (ii) the contractor to use technology and construction methods more economical \nand relevant to the site. Past data suggests that the initial price of design-build contracts is 5%\u2013\n10% higher than admeasurement method contracts, but the final price of design-build contracts \nis often less. Moreover, under a design-build contract, MOTC and the construction supervision \nconsultant can focus more on output quality, which is critical at this site. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17.  \nThe  benefit  of  the  project  is  dependent  on  the  improvement  of  the  entire  Bishkek\u2013\nTorugart road,  which provides  both  national  and  international  access  to the  people  and goods \nwithin  and  outside  the  corridor.  Improvement  of  the  entire  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road  will  bring \nabout  significant  regional  benefits,  because  it  helps  increase  trade,  particularly  between  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  and  the  PRC.  MOTC  and  ADB  have  found  the  economic  benefits  of  the \ninvestment in the road to be robust and sustainable. The economic internal rate of return on the \ninvestment is about 34%, assuming that all other sections of the road are improved by the end \nof 2015.15  \n\n18.  \nThe government recognizes that the increasing number of heavy vehicles and their axle \nloads  are  reducing  the  service  life  of  many  roads,  and  that  this  trend  has  to  be  reversed  for \npreserving the newly created assets. Besides continuing to increase the maintenance budget, it \nis implementing axle load limits on roads according to the design standards. However, if loads \nexceed the limit, under the present scheme, the vehicles are charged a fee and allowed on the \nroad.  The  government  will,  therefore,  revise  the  fees  and  tolls  to  reflect  the  level  of  use  and \nvehicle type, and ban vehicles with axle loads in excess of limit. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n19.   MOTC  has  been  following  ADB\u2019s  safeguards,  procurement  and  financial  management \nguidelines, policies, and procedures for implementing road projects since 1996, and its staff  is \nknowledgeable  about  ADB\u2019s  requirements.  Project  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  by  a \nprivate  audit  firm  acceptable  to  ADB.  Past  audit  reports  on  ADB  projects  have  not  highlighted \nany  irregularities.  MOTC  will  conduct  periodic  technical  audits  of  the  work  of  the  supervision \nconsultant  and  contractor  as  part  of  its  increased  oversight  of  works,  services,  and  goods \ncontracts. MOTC will also train its staff under the skills development component of the project, \nand introduce internal financial audits and technical audits.16 \n\n20.   ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  MOTC.  IPIG  staff  responsible  for  procurement  and  contract \nthe  requirements.  The  requirements  and \nadministration \nsupplementary measures that must be included in all contracts are described in the PAM. \n\nis  aware  of  and  understand \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n21.   When  viewed  in  the  context  of  the  entire  Bishkek\u2013Torugart  road,  the  project  will  bring \nsignificant benefits to both the people of Naryn oblast and the Kyrgyz Republic as a whole, and \nwill also have positive impacts on poverty reduction in the PRC. The 30% reduction in trip times \nand  vehicle  operating  costs  from  Torugart  to  Naryn  will  increase  activity  at  the  freight  transit \ncenter  in  Naryn  city.  This  will  create  more  jobs  and  increase  the  demand  for  local  services.17 \nPeople residing along the road will be able to find employment in physical works and ancillary \nservices during construction. The increase in traffic will help sustain the service businesses that \npeople  started  during  construction.  Civil  works  and  service  contracts  financed  by  ADB  will \nrequire equal employment opportunities, wages, and relevant working conditions to be given to \nwomen. The government  has gradually  increased  border  and  internal  security  monitoring,  and \n                                                \n15 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Details  are  in  Section  V  of  the  Project  Administration  Manual  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\n17 Country  Economic  Indicators  and  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nAppendix 2) \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fwill  implement  a  national  road  safety  awareness  program  in  the  local  communities.  These \nmeasures will help prevent possible negative social effects such as traffic accidents, human and \ndrug trafficking, and spread of sexually transmitted infections, which may result from increased \ntravel and trade.    \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n22.  \nThe project is classified as environmental category A, because about 35 km of the road \npasses in close  proximity  to  Chatyr  Kul  Lake  protected  area.  ADB  assisted the government  in \nconducting an environmental impact assessment (EIA), which shows that (i) the impacts during \nconstruction  are  mostly  acute,  temporary,  and  reversible,  with  the  exception  of  possible \nhazardous  materials  spills;  (ii)  potential  impacts  during  operations  are  expected  to  be  much \ngreater  as the road  has a  design  lifetime  of  20+ years,  and pollutants  entering the  Chatyr  Kul \naquatic ecosystem could accumulate because the lake has no outlet; (iii) some improvements in \ndust, noise, and vibration are expected; and (iv) long-term impacts caused by increased traffic, \nvehicle emissions, and possible hazardous materials spills pose potential risks to the Chatyr Kul \necosystem. \n\n23.  \nThe draft EIA report was discussed with the stakeholders and disclosed to the public in \nNovember  2010.18 The report  contains  a two-track  environmental management  plan  (EMP) for \n(i) pollutant source control, and (ii) receptor (biodiversity) protection. The control and protection \nmeasures  include  speed  limits,  signs,  and  special  permits  for  hazardous  material  movement, \nand  hydraulic  structures  such  as  retention  pods  and  diversion  channels  to  prevent  runoff \npollutants and accidentally spilled toxic substances from entering the wetlands.  \n\n24.   ADB and the government have agreed that MOTC will \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nin \n\ntheir  contracts  outlining  penalties \n\nsurvey  the  ecosystem,  establish  baseline  indicators,  update  the  EIA  report,  and \nobtain ADB\u2019s approval before handing over the civil works site to the contractor;   \nselect a contractor and an engineer for civil works only if they have proven work \nexperience in highly environmentally sensitive areas and international standards \norganization certification; \ninclude  particular  conditions \nnoncompliance with the EMP; \nengage  qualified  and  experienced  external  experts  or  qualified  nongovernment \norganizations  under  a  selection  process  and  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to \nADB, to verify information produced through the project monitoring process, and \nfacilitate the carrying out of any verification activities by such external experts; \npromptly  inform  ADB  of  the  occurrence  of  any  risks  or  impacts,  with  detailed \ndescription of the event and proposed corrective action plan if any unanticipated \nenvironmental  and/or  social  risks  and  impacts  arise  during  construction, \nimplementation,  or  operation  of  the  project  that  were  not  considered  in  the  EIA \nand the EMP; \nreport  any  actual  or  potential  breach  of  compliance  with  the  measures  and \nrequirements set forth in the EMP promptly after becoming aware of the breach; \nand \nsubmit at least semiannual monitoring reports during project construction, and at \nleast annual reports during operation. \n\nfor \n\n \n\n                                                \n18 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nThe  project  does  not  require  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement,  as  all  civil \n25.  \nworks  will  take  place  within  the  existing  right-of-way.  There  are  no  indigenous  peoples  in  the \nproject  area.    Accordingly,  the  project  is  classified  as  resettlement  category  C  and  indigenous \npeoples  category  C.  If  there  is  a  need  during  project  implementation,  for  acquisition  of  land, \nresettlement of people, or any impact of indigenous peoples, MOTC will consult with ADB and \nprepare  plans  for  addressing  the  issues  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguards  Policy  Statement \n(2009). \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n26.  \nThe  factors  that  have  a  high  likelihood  of  placing  the  project\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  and \noutput targets at risk during various stages of the life cycle were identified and grouped into six \ncategories.
