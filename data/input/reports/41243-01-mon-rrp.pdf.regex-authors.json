THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Mongolia for the Fourth Health Sector Development Project. \n \n2.  The project will strengthen the hospital sector in Ulaanbaatar and improve drug safety \nnationwide. It complements previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) development initiatives in \nthe health sector in Mongolia. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  project  builds  on  previous  health  sector  development  initiatives  to  continue \nreforming the Mongolian health sector, including health care financing, in line with the National \nDevelopment Strategy and the government\u2019s Health Sector Master Plan (2006\u20132015). The ADB \nIndependent  Evaluation  Department\u2019s  sector  recommendations1  emphasize  the  need  for \nstructural  changes  in  health  care  delivery  by  rationalizing  excess  hospital  capacity  at  the \nsecondary  and  tertiary  level,  particularly  in  Ulaanbaatar.  The  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan (2009\u20132012)2 and country partnership strategy (2010\u20132015, in \npreparation). The project is in line with Strategy 20203 and the Operational Plan for Health,4 in \naddressing  sector  governance  issues  and  promoting  more  efficient  allocation  of  health \nresources.  \n \n4.  ADB is the largest external financier to the health sector, and plays a pivotal role in \nassisting the government to formulate and implement health sector reforms. Support from other \npartners  tends  to  focus  on  assisting  the  government  to  address  particular  diseases  or  to \ndevelop certain programs. ADB works in close consultation with these partners and, to improve \naid effectiveness, efforts are made to support the implementation of the Health Sector Master \nPlan.  Efforts  are  underway  under  the  leadership  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  and  in \ncoordination with other development partners in the sector to evolve gradually toward more \nsector-based assistance. The World Health Organization is providing parallel cofinancing for the \nproject. \n \n5.  The  hospital  sector  absorbs  the  bulk  of  the  MOH  budget  and  is  characterized  by \nexcessive capacity, inefficiencies, fragmentation, and lack of quality services. Mongolia has \nmoved from a health service based on the Semashko5 model of polyclinics and mono-profile \nspecialist hospitals6 to a focus on primary health care provided by family doctors working in \nfamily group practices. Public secondary and tertiary care in Ulaanbaatar is provided by over 50 \nhospitals. Six mono-profile hospitals managed by the MOH provide tertiary and secondary care \nin cancer, traumatology and orthopedics, psychiatry, dermatology, pediatrics, and maternal and \nchild care. The MOH also manages three multifunctional hospitals that provide a wide range of \nsecondary and some tertiary services. District hospitals, under the Ulaanbaatar City Mayor\u2019s \nOffice, provide a limited range of services, mainly internal medicine and neurology services. The \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Mongolia Country Assistance Program Evaluation: From Transition to Takeoff. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n4  ADB. 2008. An Operational Plan for Improving Health Access and Outcomes under Strategy 2020. Manila. \n5  The Semashko model was a Soviet-style centralized and hierarchical health system with strong emphasis on \nexpensive curative services and hospital-based physicians in extensive and numerous facilities. \n6  Mono-profile hospitals provide specialized care (e.g., maternal care, pediatrics, traumatology); this can be justified, \nbut in Mongolia it leads to fragmentation of care, making it difficult for patients to be served efficiently. ", "2 \ndeficient quality of services at the primary level and the weakness of the district hospital system \nresult in patients seeking care at the tertiary level where lower-level services are provided at \nhigher costs.   \n \n6.  There  is  a  rapidly  growing  and  poorly  regulated  private  health  sector  consisting  of \nhospitals, clinics, laboratories, and pharmacies, primarily concentrated in Ulaanbaatar. Hospital \nbuildings and equipment in the public and private sectors are generally in poor condition. \nPatients stay too long in hospitals and there are many inappropriate admissions. The training of \nspecialist medical staff is not up to international good practice standards and the management \nof the hospital sector is weak. Increasing investments in the hospital sector are expected as the \neconomic outlook for Mongolia is promising. The challenge is to ensure that investments are \nused efficiently to improve accessibility and service quality.  \n \n7.  The cost of reforming the hospital sector in Ulaanbaatar is estimated at $450 million.7 A \ncentral question is how to use the limited budget available to the project strategically to ensure \nan efficient use of future investments. A vision, a hospital policy, and a clear hospital reform \nplan for Ulaanbaatar (including legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms; capacity building \nneeds; and potential financing sources) are lacking. Decision makers have little understanding \nof how to improve hospital sector management, rationalize hospital services, and how to turn \ndistrict hospitals into multiprofile hospitals.8   \n \n8.  Mongolia suffers from illegal importation of drugs and the circulation of substandard and \ncounterfeit medicines. Drug regulatory functions are fragmented and local drug manufacturers \ndo not comply with good manufacturing practices. Public information, drug promotion, and post-\nmarketing surveillance are significantly underdeveloped. The social and economic costs of \nunsafe drugs are high and there is little awareness among decision makers. Drug safety needs \ngovernment intervention as market forces alone will not solve the problem. Mongolia requires \ninvestments and technical support as domestic skills in the area of drug safety are scarce. \n \n9.  The need to reform the hospital sector has been identified for more than 10 years (with \nlittle achievement), although it is clearly reflected in the government\u2019s Health Sector Master Plan \n(2006\u20132015). In 1997, under the Health Sector Development Program,9 ADB provided initial \nsupport for critical changes in the Mongolian health care system. A key achievement of this \nprogram includes developing the family group practice system10 as a means of transforming the \nhealth system towards primary health care. However, the government's low commitment and \ndetermination  to  rationalize  hospitals  and  staffing  resulted  in  continued  limited  budget \nallocations for primary health care and limited system efficiency.11 From 2004 to 2009, ADB \nsupport through the Second Health Sector Development Project12 focused on improving access \nto quality health services in rural areas and extending reforms initiated under the program, but \nprogress in the areas of hospital rationalization and career development was mixed under the \nproject.13  In  the  hospital  sector,  the  ongoing  Third  Health  Sector  Development  Project14 \n                                                 \n7  Communication from consultant team of ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nsupports the autonomization of public hospitals and improved regulation of private hospitals. \nThe  strategy  of  the  Fourth  Health  Sector  Development  Project  will  differ  from  previous \napproaches in tackling the problem of hospital sector reform at a more macro level by (i) \nassisting the government in preparing its first hospital development policy, (ii) preparing a \nstrategic hospital reform plan for Ulaanbaatar, and (iii) developing a model hospital to advocate \nfor change. \n \n10.  The prospects for meaningful health sector reform are greater now than at any time in \nthe past because (i) public\u2013private partnerships to tap capital and management for the health \nsystem are now possible,15 (ii) public demand for reform is mounting, and (iii) political leaders \nare starting to recognize the urgency of improving the hospital system. The project will assist \nMongolia in preparing future reforms and ensuring decent socioeconomic returns on future \ninvestments. The project will improve governance in the sector by improving public investment \nplanning, providing decent and efficient hospital services, protecting the population against \ncounterfeit and substandard drugs, and facilitating the public's access to information on hospital \nperformance and drug safety. At the same time, hospital reforms give the government a unique \nopportunity to establish public\u2013private collaboration for the benefit of the population. The project \nwill deliver tangible benefits to women by ensuring their active participation in institutional \nprocesses to reform the hospital and drug safety subsectors. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  to  improve  the  health  status  of  the  Mongolian \npopulation,  including  the  poor.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  health  sector  efficiency, \ngovernance, and drug safety.16 \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The project will have three components with the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Component 1: Strengthened hospital services in Ulaanbaatar. As part of \nreforming the hospital sector, the project will assist the government in preparing a \nhospital development policy and strategic plan for Ulaanbaatar (including legal, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  reforms;  capacity  building  needs;  and  potential \nfinancing resources) and will develop a hospital capital planning system. The \nSonginohairkhan  district  hospital  of  Ulaanbaatar  will  be  turned  into  a \nmultifunctional general hospital that will provide quality services to the district \npopulation and serve as a demonstration hospital for other districts in the city. \nHospital governance will be improved through reforms to the hospital licensing \nsystem  and  by  ensuring  the  public  is  provided  with  information  on  hospital \nperformances. \n(ii)  Component 2: Strengthened human resource development. The project will \nstrengthen  the  postgraduate  specialist  structure  and  residency  training  to \naddress the fragmentation and poor quality of postgraduate programs. A hospital \nmanagement  module  will  be  developed  and  included  among  the  programs \noffered by a local training institution. \n                                                 \n15 The Parliament approved the public-private partnership policy and the law on concessions in January 2010. The \nState Property Agency in charge of the implementation of the policy selected priority activities in the health sector \n(outsourcing of hospital services and private management contracts of family group practices) to demonstrate the \nfeasibility of a public-private partnership approach in the sector. \n16  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "4 \n(iii)  Component  3:  Strengthened  drug  safety  regime.  This  component  will \nincrease access to safer drugs nationwide in a country that imports most of its \npharmaceuticals and has a poor pharmaceutical safety track record. The project \nwill  assist  the  government  in  establishing  a  drug  regulatory  authority  and \nstrengthening regulatory functions to improve coordination and quality. The drug \ncontrol laboratory17 will be upgraded to international standards (including the \nprovision of equipment, processes, capacity building, and information technology \nservices).  The  project  will  upgrade  the  standards  of  good  manufacturing \nprocesses and support local drug manufacturers to meet the standards. Drug \nsafety governance will be strengthened through regular annual overviews of drug \nsafety indicators and achievements under the MOH and by improving public \ninformation on drug safety. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n13.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $18.15  million,  including  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, and total taxes and duties of $0.4 million. The investment plan is summarized in \nTable 1.  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounta \nA.  Base Costb   \n  1.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $14 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project, including recurrent costs and taxes and duties.18 \n \n                                                 \n17 The drug control laboratory of the General Agency for Specialized Inspection (GASI). \n18 Taxes and duties are covered in accordance with the cost-sharing ceilings and will be within the reasonable \nthreshold identified during the country partnership strategy preparation process. The amount of taxes and duties to \nbe financed does not represent an excessive share of the project investment plan. The financing of taxes and \nduties is material and relevant to the success of the project. The taxes and duties to be financed apply only with \nrespect to ADB-financed expenditures. \n  Equipment and materials to be financed out of the proceeds of the grant include transportation and insurance. \n  A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grants framework is determined by its \nrisk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Mongolia had a moderate risk of debt \ndistress and was therefore eligible to receive 50% of its overall Asian Development Fund allocation as grants.  \n ", "5 \n15.  The total project cost of $18.15 million will be financed by an Asian Development Fund \ngrant  of  $14  million.  The  World  Health  Organization  will  cofinance  $450,000  (parallel \ncofinancing); and the Government of Mongolia will fund the remaining $3.70 million, consisting \nof $2.25 million for civil works, $0.05 million for office space (in-kind), recurrent costs of $0.62 \nmillion, and $0.78 million for contingencies. Physical and price contingencies amounting to \n$2.70 million have been made for the project.  \n \n16.  ADB provided grant financing of $600,000 equivalent for project preparation from the \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV).19 \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount \nSource  ($ million)    Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Fund Grant  14.00    77.13 \nWorld Health Organization  0.45    2.48 \nGovernment  3.70    20.39 \n  Total    18.15    100.00 \na The World Health Organization (WHO) contribution (parallel cofinancing) consists of technical assistance \n($180,000 provided in-kind); training and workshops ($190,000); and medical equipment for maternal and \nchild health and laboratory equipment ($80,000). WHO will provide technical assistance to: (i) component 1 \u2013 \n5 person-months for the establishment of the demonstration hospital; (ii) component 2 \u2013 1 person-month for \nstrengthening of postgraduate specialist structure and residency programs; and (iii) component 3 \u2013 2 person-\nmonths for the implementation of good manufacturing processes, 1 person-month for the use of WHO \nstandard methodology to measure the circulation of unsafe drugs, and 1 person-month to strengthen drug \nregulatory functions. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail \nin section III of the project administration manual (PAM).20 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period and grant closing  July 2011\u2013June 2016 \ndate  Grant closing date: 31 December 2016  \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2016 \nManagement     \n(i) Oversight body  The role of the project steering committee of the Third Health \nSector Development Project will be expanded and extended to \ncover the Fourth Health Sector Development Project.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n18.  The economic analysis evaluated the economic viability of the project as a whole. The \nanalysis  covers  the  macroeconomic  context  to  review  the  potential  for  the  government  to \ncontinue to finance the project activities in the longer term following project completion. For the \nproject, the analysis covers the quantifiable economic costs and benefits for the improved \nhospital component and provides qualitative analysis of the improved drug safety component. \n ", "7 \nThe economic impact of unsafe medicine is difficult to quantify because there are a number of \nunknown  variables  involved.  Using  conservative  estimates  of  project  implementation,  the \nbaseline  results  show  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  11.75%,  reflecting \nsubstantial unquantifiable economic benefits for the drug safety component and the relatively \nsmall population catchment for the benefits attached to the hospital improvement component.21 \nThe EIRR was tested through sensitivity analysis using a 20% decrease in economic benefits as \nthe worst-case scenario for each of the economic benefits relating to hospital efficiency savings, \nsavings  to  patients  for  out-of-pocket  costs,  and  reduction  in  projected  productivity \nimprovements.  Under  these  conservative  assumptions,  the  EIRRs  are  9.73%  for  reduced \nhospital  efficiency  savings,  10.97%  for  reductions  in  patient  savings,  and  10.93%  where \nunderachieved productivity gains are projected. The project is considered economically viable.  \n \n19.  The project has no revenue-earning components, hence financial cost benefits were not \nanalyzed as part of the financial analysis. The MOH, the Ulaanbaatar City Health Department, \nand the General Agency for Specialized Inspection (GASI) will contribute counterpart funding \nand shoulder the project\u2019s operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. A fiscal analysis indicated \nthat the MOH\u2019s annual average contribution to the project is 0.5% of the health sector annual \nbudget. The annual O&M cost, to be borne by GASI, will not exceed 1.4% of its current revenue \nand  additional  O&M  costs  required  by  the  Ulaanbaatar  City  Health  Department  for  the \ndemonstration hospital will not be more than 0.7% of its current expenditure. The counterpart \nfunding and O&M costs are considered both financially sustainable and affordable. A financial \nmanagement assessment concluded that the MOH is experienced in managing ADB projects \nand is prepared for project implementation. The financial management analysis identified issues \nthat will be addressed through the maintenance of project accounts by a project implementation \nunit (PIU) dedicated to the project and through external audits for the project duration.   \n  \nB.  Governance \n20.  The MOH is a long-term partner of ADB, actively involved in implementing health sector \ndevelopment projects since 1991. A PIU was established as part of the ongoing Third Health \nSector  Development  Project  and  this  arrangement  will  be  expanded  to  incorporate  the \nimplementation of the Fourth Health Sector Development Project. \n \n21.  A procurement capability assessment conducted for the  executing agency and  PIU \nconfirmed their general ability to conduct procurement in compliance with ADB policy and \nprocedural requirements and the relevant national laws and regulations on public procurement. \nThe implementing agencies have no recent procurement experience using ADB policies and \nprocedural requirements. Therefore, all procurement under the project will be carried out by the \nexecuting agency and coordinated by the PIU. \n \n22.  Financial  management  assessments  have  been  conducted  for  the  MOH,  the \nUlaanbaatar City Mayor\u2019s Office, and GASI. The assessment for the MOH and its PIU updated \nthe  assessment  carried  out  as  part  of  the  project  planning  for  the  Third  Health  Sector \nDevelopment Project. All three agencies have adequate accounting professionals equipped with \ncomputerized  financial  accounting  and  reporting  systems  and  procedures  on  the  flow  of \naccounting, financial, and project physical progress related to their current project activities. All \nthe agencies have clearly defined responsibilities with accountability allocated to different units \nat different levels of authority within their institutions.  \n \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2003. Economic Analysis of Projects. Operations Manual. OM G1/OP. Manila (B.[vi][b]) states that a low \nEIRR is acceptable when there are substantial unquantifiable benefits. \n ", "8 \n23.  Annual audits for the project will be arranged by the Ministry of Finance. The financial \nmanagement assessment concluded that, in general, the current financial management system \nin the executing and implementing agencies can meet the requirements of the government in \nterms  of  staffing,  accounting,  and  internal  control.  The PIU  will  recruit  additional  technical \nsupport for hospital planning and drug safety to strengthen its capacity to implement the project \nin compliance with the policy, operation, and procedural requirements of ADB.  \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Mongolia  and  the  MOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  over  250,000  mostly  poor  residents  of  the \nSonginohairkhan district of Ulaanbaatar by improving district hospital services. The project will \nalso benefit the entire population of Mongolia by improving access to safer drugs, and, in the \nlong run, will improve allocative efficiency in the health sector by optimizing the use of hospital \nservices and improving the return on future investment in the hospital sector. Improving both the \ncountry\u2019s health services and the health status of the population will lead to a reduction in \nhousehold expenditures and time spent seeking care. Mongolia\u2019s extensive social safety net \nsystem accounted for approximately 12% of gross domestic product per year until 2008 (it is \ncurrently being reformed), of which 40% was devoted to social assistance to the poor and \ndisadvantaged. Poverty and health are strongly related, and better health services are not only \na  social  goal  but  also  a  prerequisite  to  economic  development.  Improved  health  care  will \ntherefore  expand  the  economic  opportunities  of  the  whole  population,  including  the  poor. \nReliable health services will reduce lifecycle risks to the individual, including illness, injury, \ndisability,  and  early  death,  thereby  also  reducing  impoverishment.  The  poor  will  benefit \nparticularly from the project\u2019s drug safety activities as they are currently more likely to purchase \nand consume substandard pharmaceuticals.  \n \n26.  The project is classified as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d In Mongolia, the health \nstatus of the population is highly differentiated by gender. The male mortality rate in Mongolia is \nhigh, and the male life expectancy is low compared with females, due primarily to unhealthy \nlifestyle habits such as smoking and heavy drinking. Women comprise the majority of users and \nproviders of the health care system in Mongolia, and one out of five households in urban areas \nin Mongolia is headed by a woman.22 Women provide the majority of care for ill family members. \nThe vast majority of the country\u2019s total medical staff is composed of women. A gender action \nplan has been developed for the project to ensure that gender is mainstreamed. Women at all \nlevels will participate in institutional processes to reform the hospital and drug safety subsectors. \nThe MOH has ensured that the gender action plan agreed upon under the project will be \nimplemented in a timely manner. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n27.  The environmental categorization of the project is B. An environmental assessment has \nbeen carried out in accordance with the Mongolia regulatory framework and ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). A consolidated initial environmental examination (IEE) report was \nprepared, which assesses and addresses the environmental implications of the rehabilitation \nand expansion of the Songinohairkhan District Hospital and the New Central Laboratory. The \nteam and project counterparts agreed to specify the whole laboratory building as an associated \n                                                 \n22 National Statistics Office. 2008. 2007/2008 Household Socio-Economic Survey. Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "9 \nfacility.23 This allowed conducting necessary due diligence for the building, resulting in the \nconduct of the necessary domestic environmental assessment, ensuring compliance with the \nMongolian law. The consolidated IEE summarizes the findings of the New Central Laboratory \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  and  the  Songinohairkhan  District  Hospital  Initial \nEnvironmental Examination (IEE), and a due diligence review of project associated facilities. \nPotential adverse impacts during the construction and operation phase include limited standard \nconstruction impacts; and occupational and community health and safety issues, especially the \nunsafe collection, storage, treatment, and disposal of medical and chemical hazardous waste. \nThe possible adverse environmental impacts will be prevented or minimized to acceptable \nlevels, through the implementation of the environmental management plan (EMP) that includes \nadequate  mitigation  and  monitoring  arrangements.  The  environmental  assessment  process \nachieved significant value added by (i) catalyzing, through policy dialog with MNET and GASI, \nthe development of an EIA for the project\u2019s associated new central laboratory building; (ii) \ndeveloping comprehensive management systems for the collection, storage, and treatment of \nmedical and hazardous chemical waste; and (iii) developing a substantial consolidated IEE \nreport which defines environmental mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, institutional \nresponsibilities, and training and capacity building requirements. \n \n28.  No  involuntary  resettlement  effects  are  foreseen  and  the  project  is  classified  as  a \ncategory C project. The upgrading of the facilities of the multifunctional hospital will be on \nexisting  government  land  and  will  not  affect  local  residents  or  residential  buildings.  A \nresettlement plan and framework are therefore not required. Should there be any change in \nscope or other changes with unanticipated resettlement impacts during project implementation, \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The project will not have any negative impact on indigenous \npeoples and is therefore classified as a category C project. No further actions are therefore \nrequired. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nResistance  to  change  from  key  staff  groups  Key  staff,  agencies,  and  sectors  will  obtain \n(e.g., hospital specialists), agencies (e.g., the  consensus  for  the  project\u2019s  implementation. \nState Specialized Inspection Agency), sectors  Key mitigation measures will consist of a strong \n(e.g., private hospitals), and the community  communication  strategy  with  information \ncampaigns,  awareness  raising,  and  training \nactivities,  providing  incentives  to  counter \nresistance (e.g., capacity building, promotion), \nand  involving  communities  in  needs \nassessment and planning. \nLack of government and community support for  The  project  will  mitigate  this  risk  through \nhospital reform  continuing policy dialogue with the government \nand  donor  community  in  the  context  of  the \nHealth  Sector  Strategic  Master  Plan.
