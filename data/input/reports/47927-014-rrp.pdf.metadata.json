The  fund,  a  Cayman  Islands  limited  partnership,  is  a  close-ended  private \nequity  fund  (PEF)  with  a  target  capitalization  of  $300  million  that  will  invest  in  health  care \ncompanies  in  Asia.  The  general  partner  will  be  OrbiMed  Asia  GP  II,  LP,  a  Cayman  Islands \nexempted  limited  partnership.  It  will  have  an  advisory  services  agreement  with  OrbiMed \nAdvisers LLC (OrbiMed), a global health care asset manager. The shareholders of OrbiMed are \nsubstantially the same as the beneficial owners of the general partner.1 \n \n3. \nInvestment  identification.  The  fund\u2019s  concept  was  driven  by  a  2011  cross-division \nregional  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  spearheaded  by  the  Private \nSector Infrastructure Finance 1 division of the Private Sector Operations Department, alongside \nthe Private Sector Investment Funds and Special Initiatives division.2 The goal of the TA was to \nexamine  the  feasibility  of  establishing  a  PEF  that  would  target  opportunities  that  could \ncommercialize  affordable  and  accessible  drug  therapies  for  Asia\u2019s  poor,  and  thereby  increase \nthe  current  low  level  of  health  sector  interventions  by  the  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment.3 The  TA  project,  led  by  global  consulting  firm  McKinsey  &  Co.,  concluded  that  a \nsuccessful  health-focused  private  equity  fund  would  experience  stronger  commercial  success \nwith a diversified investment portfolio of both therapeutic and nontherapeutic assets.  \n \nADB invited 11 fund managers to express their interest in assisting in the implementation \n4. \nof the TA and the production of a formal report that could be used to establish an Asia-focused \nhealth  care  PEF  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  development  goals.  At  the  conclusion  of  this  process, \nOrbiMed was judged to be the most capable in establishing and managing such a PEF based \non its platform and its previous success with its first fund, OrbiMed Asia Partners I, LP.4 \n \nB. \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\n \n\nProviding  affordable  and  high-quality  health  care  is  an  increasing  challenge  for  ADB\u2019s \n5. \ndeveloping  member  countries,  particularly  because  of  the  region\u2019s  unique  patient  and  health \ncare  dynamics,  including  lower  affordability,  high  prevalence of  certain diseases, geographical \ndispersion, and urban and rural inequalities.5  \n \n6. \nIn  designing  a  PEF  that  will  target  commercial  health  care  opportunities,  the  fund  will \nleverage  both  (i)  the  expertise  and  track  record  of  OrbiMed\u2019s  global  health  care  investing \nplatform, and (ii) the TA outputs. The TA outputs include 29 key health care themes\u201419 in India \nand  10  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)\u2014identified  by  the  market  analysis.

(This  information  was \ndeemed  confidential  according \nto  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy.) \n \nThe Cayman Islands is on the list of jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the \n8. \ninternationally  agreed  tax  standard. 6 The  Global  Forum  on  Transparency  and  Exchange  of \nInformation for Tax Purposes (Global Forum) has determined, following its phase 1 peer review \nof  the  Cayman  Islands,  that  the  country  has  in  place  all  the  elements  assessed  to  date  in \nrelation to the internationally agreed tax standard.7 \n \n9. \nbeing used for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing.  \n \n\nFollowing a review of the fund, ADB does not believe that it has been established or is \n\n \n\n2. \n\nManagement \n\n10. \nThe  general  partner  is  affiliated  with  the  Delaware  limited  liability  company,  OrbiMed, \nwhich is the world\u2019s leading health care investing platform with more than $7 billion in net assets \nunder  management  as  of  1  April  2013.  OrbiMed  maintains  one  of  the  strongest  management \nteams  of  all  health-care-focused  PEFs  in  the  market  with  60  investment  professionals\u201420  of \nwhom  hold  PhDs  or  MDs,  and  10  of  whom  are  former  chief  executive  officers  or  founders  of \nhealth care businesses. OrbiMed professionals also serve on the boards of more than 50 health \ncare  companies.  OrbiMed  is  one  of  the  first  health  care  investment  firms  to  establish  and \nmanage a pan-Asia health care PEF\u2014OrbiMed Asia Partners I, a $182 million fund launched in \n2008\u2014and  to  maintain  a  significant  team  focused  on  health  care  investments  across  multiple \nAsian markets (footnote 1).  \n \n \n11. \nThe  general  partner  will  staff  a  dedicated  Asia  team  comprising  at  least  11  investment \nprofessionals  (substantially  the  same  team  that  managed  OrbiMed  Asia  Partners  I)  based  in \nOrbiMed\u2019s Shanghai and Mumbai offices (This information was deemed confidential according \nto  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy).  OrbiMed\u2019s \ninvestment  professionals  have  extensive  local  networks  in  the  medical,  scientific,  health  care, \nand private equity industries, as well as with regulatory bodies, in Asia. The Asia team will also \nleverage the resources and expertise of the OrbiMed platform, including the public equity team, \nthe global private equity team, the royalty team, and other professionals across finance,  legal, \ncompliance, trading, and information technology. \n \n(This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of \n12. \nADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy.)  After  reviewing  OrbiMed\u2019s  policies  to  combat  money-\nlaundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  ADB  is  satisfied  that  sufficient  integrity  checks  and \n                                                \n6  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD).  2012.

(This  information  was  deemed  confidential \naccording to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.) \n \n\n3 \n\n3. \n\nGovernance Structure \n\n13. \nThe general partner will follow a three-stage investment process based on an approach \ndeveloped and refined through its 20 years of health care investing: (i) investment screening of \neach  potential  portfolio  company\u2019s  operations,  products,  market  opportunity,  and  valuation \nagainst  the  fund\u2019s  mandate  and  strategy;  (ii)  deal  structuring  and  due  diligence;  and  (iii) \npreparation of investment proposals for presentation to the fund\u2019s investment committee.  \n \nOnce an investment has been made, the team assists portfolio companies with strategic \n14. \nand  operational  objectives.  One  of  the  team\u2019s  competitive  advantages  (relative  to  other  Asia-\nonly  generalist  firms)  is  the  ability  to  tap  into  OrbiMed\u2019s  global  relationships  with  private  and \npublicly  traded  health  care  companies.  The  general  partner  leverages  these  relationships  to \ndrive  many  facets  of  growth  for  portfolio  companies,  including  business  development,  product \nlicensing  opportunities,  and  mergers  and  acquisition  activity.  The  team  members  draw  upon \ntheir decades of collective operating and management experience as entrepreneurs and board \nmembers to help portfolio companies achieve strong growth. \n \n15. \nIn addition to the investment committee, the fund also has an advisory committee of up \nto seven members representing the  fund\u2019s  investors.  ADB  will  be  represented  on the  advisory \ncommittee.8 \n \nD. \n\nFinancial Performance \n\n16. \nOrbiMed,  through  funds  under  its  management,  has  made  private  investments  in  the \nhealth  care  sector  since  1993  and  has  developed  a  track  record  of  effectively  exiting \ninvestments  at  attractive  returns.  The  funds  managed  by  OrbiMed  have  invested  about  $1.6 \nbillion in more than 155 private investments across a wide range of health care subsectors and \ncompany  stages.  (This  information  was  deemed  confidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv) \nand 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.) \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n17. \nADB  will  provide  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  $60,000,000  in  the  fund,  not  to  exceed \n25%  of  the  fund\u2019s  total  capital  commitments  and  not  resulting  in  ADB  being  the  single  largest \ninvestor in the fund. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions  \n\n(This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of \n\n18. \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.) \n \n\n                                                \n8  The role of the advisory committee is to represent the interests of the fund\u2019s investors. It will not participate in the \nfund\u2019s  investment  process  or  make  investment  decisions.  A  more  detailed  description  is  in  Ownership, \nManagement, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f4  \n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nExit Strategy  \n\nThe  fund  has  a  10-year  term  from  final  closing,  with  two  options  to  extend  for  a \n19. \nmaximum of 1 year each.9 OrbiMed anticipates that the exit strategies for the fund\u2019s investments \nwill  include  public  offerings  on  both  Asian  and  North  American  exchanges,  and  trade sales of \nportfolio  companies  to  strategic  buyers. 10 Sales  to  strategic  buyers,  including  larger  private \nequity firms, will likely be the most common exit strategy for portfolio companies. As many large \ndeveloped-country  health  care  companies  are  seeking  to  expand  their  activities  in  Asia,  the \nmergers  and  acquisition  markets  in  the  PRC  and  India  are  expected  to  be  active  and  grow \nrobustly. \n \n\n2. \n\nReporting Arrangements \n\n20. \nThe general partner will provide ADB with (i) quarterly unaudited reports; and (ii) audited \nannual reports, including financial statements, a fund overview, and an overview of the portfolio \nwith brief information on each portfolio company\u2019s performance and valuation. ADB will review \nthis information and will follow up with the general partner when more information or clarification \nis  needed.  If  the  information  received  from  the  general  partner  raises  issues  that  could  impair \nthe value of ADB\u2019s investment in the fund, ADB will decide whether to put the fund on a watch \nlist for more frequent review and closer attention. \n \n21. \nThe general partner will be required to submit its environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS) to ADB and to report  annually on environmental and social safeguards issues \nand development effectiveness indicators. ADB will monitor the receipt and quality of the ESMS \nreports  and  offer  guidance  if  the  general  partner  requires  clarification  on  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements. \nD. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n22. \nRefinement  of  investment  approach.  Through  the  regional  project  preparatory  TA \n(para.  3),  ADB  played  a  key  role  in  (i)  refining  OrbiMed\u2019s  investment  strategy  for  the  health \nsector  in  Asia,  and  (ii)  helping  the  general  partner  capture  the  link  between  successful  health \ncare  investing  and  solutions  for  the  underserved.  The  TA  helped  the  general  partner  identify \nmore  than  50  potential  investees  with  potential  for  high  development  impact  within  its  three \ntargeted  categories  of  operations:  (i)  for  products\u2014a  manufacturer  of  affordable,  portable \ndiagnostics  equipment  for  easy  deployment  in  rural  areas  focused  on  HIV,  hepatitis, \ntuberculosis, and dengue; (ii) for services\u2014a network of primary health care clinics in tier 2 and \ntier  3  cities  in  northern  India;11 and  (iii)  for  cost-advantageous  production\u2014a  branded  generic \nproducts  company  with  an  innovative  distribution  model  for  rural  areas.  The  success  of  this \nstrategy\u2014and ADB\u2019s presence in the fund\u2014will help signal that commercial investor returns in \nthis sector can be made with impact-oriented investments. \n \n\n                                                \n9 Any further extensions will be subject to unanimous approval of the advisory committee (including ADB\u2019s consent). \n10 The general partner will have the flexibility of listing on multiple exchanges, including the Hang Seng in Hong Kong, \nChina  and  the  Nasdaq  in  New  York.  While  a  recent  reduction  in  initial  public  offering  activities  in  the  PRC  was \nnoted during due diligence, this is seen as a temporary, cyclical slowdown that will not limit the fund\u2019s ability to exit \nfrom its portfolio during its divestment phase. \n\n11 Generally, in India, tier 1 cities refer to those having a population of 10 million or more; tier 2 for those cities having \na population between 1 million to less than 10 million, and tier 3 for those cities with a population size of less than 1 \nmillion. \n\n\f5 \n\n \n \n \n \nCapital  mobilization. Based on its experience with its first fund and the outputs of the \n23. \nTA, the general partner\u2019s refined investment strategy requires a larger fund size (at least $300 \nmillion) that it can deploy, at scale, to make investments that will establish benchmarks for both \nthe private equity industry and the Asian health care sector. To achieve this $300 million target, \nthe  general  partner  is  seeking  ADB\u2019s  participation  as  an  anchor  investor  based  on  ADB\u2019s \npresence and reputation in Asia. ADB\u2019s commitment of up to $60 million is therefore expected to \nsend a strong signal to other investors, validating the social and development impact against a \nbackdrop  of  strong  financial  returns.  It  is  a  prime  example  of  ADB\u2019s  \u2015Finance++\u2016  concept  of \nleveraging  the  institution\u2019s  reputation  and  capital  to  mobilize  third-party  investment  activity  in \ndeveloping member countries. ADB\u2019s investment is expected to mobilize at least $180 million in \nadditional commitments from investors. \n \n24. \nHealth  care  is  a  specialized  sector  within  the  private  equity  asset  class,  with  limited \ndistribution  across  mainstream  institutional  investors.  This  is  especially  true  for  Asian  health \ncare private equity, which operates in a sector with a deficit in overall spending. By investing in \nthe  fund,  ADB  will  support  the  concept  of  health  care  investing  through  pooled  investment \nvehicles, which are then envisaged to help unlock capital from fresh sources available for health \ncare  opportunities  that  can  reach  the  underserved\u2014and  not  just  export-oriented,  lower-cost, \nand  generic  therapies.  Furthermore,  while  several  funds  target  health  care  opportunities  in \nNorth  America  and  Europe,  many  institutional  investors  who  are  not  familiar  with  investing  in \nemerging markets have viewed an Asia-specific health care fund as being too specialized of an \ninvestment strategy, which presents a significant financing market gap. \n \nRaising  standards.  ADB\u2019s  presence  as  an  anchor  investor  in  the  fund  obligates  the \n25. \ngeneral  partner  to  ensure  that  its  investee  companies  comply  with  environment  and  social \nsafeguard  standards,  and  to  report  on  development  indicators.  ADB\u2019s  role,  along  with  other \nmembers of the fund\u2019s advisory committee, will be to assist in providing oversight on important \ngovernance  matters  that  are  essential  for  companies  to  demonstrate  as  they  seek  additional \nsources of growth capital from institutional and/or individual investors. \n\n \nRisks \n\nE. \n\n26. \nDeal  pipeline.  While  the  demand  for  private  financing  in  Asia\u2019s  health  care  sector  is \nvast, these markets  are also competitive. There  is  some risk that  the fund\u2019s  committed  capital \nwill not be fully invested within the investment period or that the fund\u2019s investment objectives will \nnot be fully realized. Partially mitigating this risk is (i) a pipeline totaling more than $840 million \nidentified  for  further  due  diligence  by  the  general  partner,  with  several  potential  deals  in \nadvanced  stages  of  discussion;  and  (ii)  OrbiMed\u2019s  extensive  track  record,  experience,  and \nplatform,  which  includes  a  significant  team  across  key  Asian  markets  for  sourcing  deals. \nFurther,  the  general  partner  has  a  wide  network  of  local  industry  relationships  that  provides  it \nwith  significant  access  to  proprietary  deals.  (This  information  was  deemed  confidential \naccording to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.) \n \nConcentration. While the general partner intends to invest in a diversified portfolio, the \n27. \nfund may be exposed to certain geographic and sector concentration risks due to its investment \nstrategy.  This  risk  is  partially  mitigated  by  the  fund\u2019s  diversification  mandate:  (i)  no  single \ninvestment  may  exceed  20%  of  the  fund\u2019s  aggregate  commitments,  (ii)  no  single  health  care \nsubsector  may  exceed  65%  of  the  fund\u2019s  aggregate  commitments  with  a  minimum  of  three \nhealth  subsectors  to  be  invested,  and  (iii)  no  single  country  may  exceed  70%  of  the  fund\u2019s \naggregate commitments. \n\n \n\n\f6  \n \n\n \n\n \n28. \nPotential  conflict  of  interest.  OrbiMed conducts a wide range of investment activities \nacross  the  globe  and  through  various  local  teams.  Situations  may  arise  where  OrbiMed  may \nhave an interest that conflicts with its duties or that of the fund. (This information was deemed \nconfidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \nPolicy.)  Another  conflict  of  interest  could  arise  from  OrbiMed  fundraising for  a successor  fund \nduring the investment period of the fund. (This information was deemed confidential according \nto  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications  Policy.)  Where  other \nspecified  potential  conflicts  of  interest  arise,  the  general  partner  will  be  required  to  refer  the \nmatter to its advisory committee, which will include a representative from ADB, for resolution. In \naddition,  any  member  of  the  advisory  committee,  investment  committee,  and  OrbiMed  may \npresent  to  the  advisory  committee  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  with  respect  to  any  proposed \nportfolio  investment  by  the  fund.  (This  information  was  deemed  confidential  according  to \nexception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy.) \n \n29. \nDivestment and exit risks. The fund will pursue the following exit strategies in order of \npriority:  trade  sale,  IPO,  put  option  (if  there  is  no  IPO  in  6  months),  and  drag-along  rights.12 \nOrbiMed usually structures a liquidation preference for its investments. While divestments might \nbe  difficult  because  of  the  state  of  capital  markets  in  the  target  countries,  the  fund  is  not \nexpected  to  be  constrained  by  regulatory  restrictions  on  exits.  However,  given  varying \nregulatory  environments  in  the  target  markets,  the  fund  is  keeping  all  exit  options  open \ndepending on market conditions. Such flexibility is necessary to mitigate exit  risks in the target \ncountries.  \n30. \nRegulatory and legal risks. Potential risks to portfolio companies may arise because of \nregulatory changes in laws pertaining to the health care sector. To mitigate this risk, all OrbiMed \nfunds  consider  potential  legal  and  regulatory  risks  to  prospective  portfolio  companies.  To \naddress  such  potential  risks,  the  firm  performs  extensive  due  diligence,  such  as  (i)  reviewing \nhistorical  correspondence  between  regulators  and  prospective  portfolio  companies,  (ii) \nevaluating the risk of product rejection and/or withdrawal because of regulatory actions, and (iii) \nanalyzing  likely  future  reimbursement  rates  for  health  care  products  from  public  and  private \npayers.  In  this  fund,  OrbiMed  will  invest  the  vast  majority  of  its  capital  in  commercial  stage \ncompanies  (i.e.,  those  not  at  risk  from  clinical  trial  failures  or  regulatory  rejections  of  key \nproducts).  \n \n31. \nGeneral  risks.  The  fund  will  be  subject  to  the  typical  risks  associated  with  equity  and \nPEF  investments  not  already  mentioned,  including  (i)  political,  economic,  and  social  risks;  (ii) \nrisks  involving  the  performance  of  the  underlying  investment;  (iii)  liquidity  risks;  (iv)  capital \nraising risks; (v) accounting and disclosure risks; and (vi) repatriation and tax risks. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nA. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n1. \n\nImpact \n\n32. \nThe success of the fund is expected to catalyze additional health-focused investments in \nthe region through the private equity modality. The expected long-term impacts of the proposed \n\n                                                \n12 A put option is a contract giving a shareholder the right, but not the obligation, to sell its stake at a specified price \nwithin a specified time. Drag-along rights provide assurances to a minority shareholder that it may join any other \ninvestor (including the majority shareholder) in any sale transaction under the same price and terms.  \n\n\f7 \n\n \n \n \n \ninvestment  are  (i)  improved  access  and  affordability  of  health  care  goods  and  services  in \ndeveloping  member  countries,  and  (ii)  the  establishment  of  new  health-focused  funds  in  Asia \nand the Pacific which reflects development of the private equity industry. ADB\u2019s participation will \nprovide  institutional  support  to  the  fund,  while  also  catalyzing  future  private  equity  activity \n(potentially  resulting  in  similar  funds  being  raised  in  the  future).  The  private  equity  modality  is \nexpected to benefit health care companies in the PRC and India by (i) creating sustainable long-\nterm  value,  (ii)  improving  the  overall  quality  of  health  care  goods  and  services,  (iii)  raising \noverall  health  care  industry  standards,  and  (iv)  transferring  international  best  practices  to \nportfolio  health  care  companies.  These  equity  investments  in  health  care,  along  with  other \nneeded public sector reforms, are expected to reduce out-of-pocket health expenditures in the \nPRC and India, which are home to 46% of the world\u2019s extreme poor (by number). \n \n\n2. \n\nOutcome \n\n33. \nThe outcome is that the fund achieves positive financial returns with social benefits, and \nthus  the  viability  of  financing  Asian  emerging  market  health  care  through  private  equity.  (This \ninformation  was  deemed  confidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s \nPublic  Communications  Policy.)  The  fund  also  expects  to  improve  the  corporate  governance \nand  transparency  of  its  investee  companies,  wherever  needed,  and  contribute  to  overall  (net) \njob creation and tax contributions. \n \n\n3. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe output will be the establishment of the fund and investment of the fund\u2019s committed \n34. \ncapital. ADB\u2019s participation will send positive signals to the market, catalyzing investments from \nadditional investors\u2014particularly first-time investors in the sector or Asia\u2019s developing markets. \nThis  will  enable  the  fund  to  reach  the  critical  mass  needed  to  create  a  diversified  portfolio  of \nhealth care investments. (This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. \n97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy).13 \n \nB. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n1. \n\nConsistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n\n35. \nThe fund will support Strategy 2020 in two areas: financial sector development and the \nhealth sector. ADB\u2019s assistance is an equity commitment into one of the largest pan-Asia, non-\ncaptive  private  equity  funds  focused  on  health  care  products  and  services.  It  is  aligned  with \nStrategy  2020\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  financial  infrastructure  and  products.  The  assistance \naddresses a sector that ADB recognizes as \u2015vital to development, productivity, social inclusion, \nand gender equity.\u201614 \n \n36. \nStrategy  2020  supports  inclusive  growth  and  opportunities  for  innovation  and  value-\nadded  technology  development.  The  strategy  also  recognizes  the  importance  of  cost-effective \nand  quality  health services. The  Operational  Plan for  Improving  Health Access and Outcomes \n\n                                                \n13  (This  information  was  deemed  confidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public \nCommunications Policy).  \n14 ADB.  2008.  Strategy  2020:  The  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2008\u20132020. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f8  \n \n\n \n\nUnder  Strategy  2020  supports  health  outcomes  through  more  cost-effective  services  and \nregional public goods, and emphasizes developing partnerships with the private sector.15 \n \nThe  fund  is  aligned  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2011\u2013201516 by \n37. \nfinancing catalytic  projects that (i)  drive change  in  private  sector  development,  and (ii)  provide \nan alternative source of capital to reduce the PRC\u2019s reliance on TA funds and external financing \nto  introduce  innovation  and  access  new  technology.  The  fund  will  also  contribute  to  the \ncomprehensive  health  approach  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2009\u2013201217 by \ncomplementing ADB\u2019s ongoing interventions in public health and sanitation with the delivery of \nimproved health care systems and services.   \n  \n\n2. \n\nConsistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n\n38. \nAccording to the health sector operational plan (footnote 16), ADB will (i) build on areas \nof  the  health  care  sector  where  it  has  distinct  and  demonstrable  comparative  advantages,  (ii) \nwork closely with other agencies showing technical expertise in health, and (iii) focus on\u2014and \nmeasure\u2014the health outcomes of its activities. Investment in the fund is consistent with these \nthree aspects, as ADB will (i) leverage its institutional strength to mobilize capital into the health \ncare  private  equity  asset  class,  (ii)  partner  with  the  sector\u2019s  leading  manager  in  health  care \ninvesting, and (iii) establish a framework to monitor the outcomes and impacts of the investment.   \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons from Previous Operations \n\n39. \nIn May 2006, ADB approved a $20 million equity investment in the Asia Healthcare Fund \nLP,  which  intended  to  invest  in  health  care  companies  in  India  and  other  emerging  Asian \nmarkets. The targeted $200 million fund was subsequently terminated in March 2008 as it was \nunable to reach financial closure, primarily because of the fund\u2019s challenges of launching with a \nfirst-time fund manager in an infant sector. \n \n40. \nThe  lesson  drawn  from  this  experience  is  the  importance  in  selecting  an  experienced \nand reputable fund manager with a proven track record in fundraising (and subsequently capital \ndeployment). Highly attuned to this lesson, ADB selected an established, top-tier fund manager \nto  execute  this  investment.  ADB  is  confident  that  OrbiMed\u2019s  platform  and  track  record \nestablishes  the  firm  as  the  best  in  its  class  and  more  than  capable  of  achieving  both \ndevelopmental and financial project outcomes. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \n\nimpacts \n\nthat  may  arise \n\nPotential  environmental \n\nfund\u2019s  operations \n41. \n(manufacturing,  marketing,  and  distribution  of  pharmaceuticals,  medical  devices,  and \ndiagnostics;  operations  of  hospital  groups  and  laboratory  chains;  and  other  services  such  as \ncontract  research  manufacturing)  include  the  generation  of  domestic  and  hazardous  solid \nwaste,  air  emissions,  and  wastewater  discharges  contaminated  with  infectious  and  hazardous \nmaterials  and  wastes.  Other  potential  issues  include  threats  to  biodiversity,  those  related  to \nbioethics, and occupational health and safety hazards. While varied, most of these impacts are \n\nfrom \n\nthe \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 2008.

Thus,  it  is  likely  that  the fund\u2019s \nportfolio companies will be classified category B, while this transaction is classified category FI \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  On  social  safeguards,  the \ninvestment  is  expected  to  be  classified  FI  treated  as  C  since  impacts  on  involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples are unlikely. \n \nIn  accordance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  fund  will  establish  and \n42. \nimplement an ESMS commensurate with the impacts and risks of its operations and that of its \nportfolio  companies.  The  fund\u2019s  ESMS  will  include  a  provision  to  ensure  that  investee \ncompanies  will  establish  and  implement  an  ESMS  that  matches  their  operations\u2019  impacts  and \nrisks. The fund and its investee companies will comply with the applicable laws and regulations \non environment and health and safety, (This information was deemed confidential according to \nexception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy).18 The fund\u2019s ESMS will \ninclude provisions requiring the fund and portfolio companies to comply with national labor laws \n(This information was deemed confidential according to exception no. 97(iv) and 97(v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic  Communications  Policy),  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy,19 (This \ninformation  was  deemed  confidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s \nPublic  Communications  Policy).  The  project  is  categorized  as  having  no  gender  elements. \nHowever, the fund may have opportunities to invest in companies providing maternal and child \ncare  services,  as  well  as  potentially  address  the  associated  high  out-of-pocket  expenditures, \nespecially in rural areas.20 \n \nDuring due diligence, the fund\u2019s key investment staff committed to establish, implement, \n43. \nand  have  in  place  an  ESMS  that  is  satisfactory  to  ADB  before  ADB\u2019s  first  investment  in  a \nportfolio  company.  A  member  of  the  general  partner  with  the  required  qualifications  and  skills \nwill be designated as the ESMS officer. \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n44. \nOrbiMed  and  the  general  partner  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  of  implementing  best \ninternational  practice  relating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of \nterrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions \nprohibiting corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB \nin the event of noncompliance.   \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe proposed equity investment is within the medium-term country, industry, group, and \n\n45. \nsingle-investment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n\n                                                \n18  (This  information  was  deemed  confidential  according  to  exception  no.  97(iv)  and  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public \n\nCommunications Policy). \n\n19 ADB. 2001.
