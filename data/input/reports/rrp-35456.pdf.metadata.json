I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (PNG) for\nNucleus Agro-Enterprises.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In 2000, the Government of PNG requested assistance from the Asian Development\n(ADB) for the preparation of an agro-industry development project to generate income-earning\nopportunities for the rural population. A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) was\napproved in November 2000.1 The consultants were fielded in January 2001, and the final\nreport was presented to ADB and the Government in May 2001.\n3. Experience has shown that nucleus enterprises (NEs) in rural areas can provide the\nmarket  outlets  and  access  to  technology  needed  to  support  smallholder  agricultural\ndevelopment.  It was determined that there are private sector enterprises eager to obtain\nfunding for this kind of development in PNG. The Government and the PPTA consultants\nidentified various nucleus enterprise development proposals for which feasibility studies would\nbe required to prepare them for financing. The Fact-Finding Mission concluded that support\nwould  be  required  to  assist  these  enterprises  and  their  potential  smallholders  to  develop\nproposals to the level where they could be evaluated for financing by potential financiers,\nincluding ADB.\n4. In view of these circumstances a TA loan was proposed to assist the Government and\nindividual private sector enterprises in undertaking the preparatory work required, covering both\nthe proposals identified during the PPTA and those later identified. During a Post Fact-Finding\nMission2  undertaken  in  early  September  2001,  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation\narrangements for such a TA Loan were agreed to in consultation with the Government, private\nsector representatives, and other major funders of the rural sector. The TA Loan framework is\nattached as Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Poverty in the Rural Sector\n5. PNG  has  a  total  population  of  5.2  million,  which  is  the  largest  among  the  island\ndeveloping countries in the Pacific. It has a very heterogeneous population structure. There are\nseveral thousand separate communities and over 650 language groups with very different\ncultures.  About 85 percent of this population is estimated to live in isolated rural areas, with\nmost people cut off from the capital, Port Moresby, by either rugged mountains or the sea.\nEconomic and social disparities are severe, with PNG ranking last on both the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme human development  and human poverty indexes for the Pacific\nnations. This status largely reflects a relatively low rate of economic growth, the underfunding of\nessential services, and the difficulty of providing these services across remote and scattered\nregions.\n                  \n1 TA 3545-PNG:  Agro-Industry Development for $500,000, approved on 14 November 2000.\n2 The  Mission  comprised  D.  Ponzi,  Senior  Economist  (Environment)/Mission  Leader  and  E.  Breckner,  Staff\nConsultant. Mr. R. Siy, Manager, Office of Pacific Operations, also assisted and guided the Mission from 31 August\nto 6 September.", "2\n6. The country\u2019s economy is dualistic with an export-oriented and capital intensive minerals\nsector operating in parallel with a traditional subsistence economy.  Despite significant wealth\nhaving been generated over the last 20 years, the minerals sector has provided relatively few\nemployment  opportunities  either  directly  or  indirectly.    Subsistence  agriculture  remains  the\ndominant  way  of  life,  with  more  than  85  percent  of  the  population  relying  on  household\nproduction to meet their daily nutritional requirements.  For many households, participation in\nthe cash economy involves only the sale of surplus crops or the planting of small stands of tree\ncrops as a means of obtaining small amounts of cash for essential traded items, school fees,\nmedical expenses, and consumer goods.  For others, production on a diversified smallholder\nbasis  does  provide  a  regular  modest  cash  income  from  food  crop  production,  cash  crop\nproduction, fishing, and livestock raising.\n7. Of the 37 percent of the country's population classified as poor, 93 percent live in the\nrural areas, where over 41 percent of the population live below the poverty line.3   Many of the\npoor are subsistence cultivators who earn some  cash income. Poverty is highest among those\nengaged in small-scale tree crop production, domestic agriculture, and hunting/gathering.  Tree\ncrop producers constitute the largest group of the poor and account for 42 percent of the\npoverty-ranked population. The sharp decline in world prices for most tree crops in the past two\nyears has exacerbated poverty.\n8. The extent of poverty in rural areas is a result of low levels of investment in capital,\ntechnology, infrastructure, education, and health. Rural people have limited access to education\nand health services. In terms of literacy, there are large regional disparities, with only one third\nof adults in the highland regions being literate compared with about 80 percent in the National\nCapital District and New Guinea Islands. Only half of the primary-age children in the Highlands\ngo  to  school,  and  only  one  in  seven  girls  completes  primary  school.  Lack  of  appropriate\neducation and/or training is a constraint to the commercialization of agriculture.\nB.  The Agriculture Sector\n9. The main focus of commercial agricultural production in the country has traditionally\nbeen export-oriented tree crops.  These include coffee, cocoa, coconut, and, more recently, oil\npalm and rubber.  These crops are grown by both smallholders and commercial estates.  In the\npast, commercial estates accounted for a large part of the country\u2019s production, but in the past\nfew decades, except for oil palm, the trend has been for a decline in the number of estates.\nSmallholders currently account for 80 percent of coconut, 75 percent of coffee, 70 percent of\ncocoa, and 25 percent of oil palm production.\n10. Commercial production in nontraditional products, including poultry, cattle, and food\ncrops, has shown some increase. PNG is endowed with a variety of agroclimatic zones and\nfavorable soil resources, and a wide range of tropical and temperate crops can be grown.\nHowever, in almost all cases, expansion of the area in existing crops or the establishment of\nnew crops is constrained by a lack of markets, restricted access to credit, and land ownership\nuncertainties, exacerbated by severe infrastructure constraints.  One way of overcoming these\nconstraints  has  been  through  focusing  development  efforts  around  a  nucleus  commercial\nenterprise that can provide a market for smallholder crops, improved technology, and a degree\nof infrastructure support.  The best example of this  has been in oil palm production. Much of the\n                  \n3 Defined as K461 per adult equivalent per year in 1996 prices in the World Bank publication: Papua New Guinea:\nPoverty and Access to Public Services; World Bank; Washington, D.C.; October,1999", "3\noil palm development in the country has been through nucleus estate production supplemented\nby smallholders who sell their produce directly to the estate for processing.  The past three\ndecades have seen a major expansion in the area of oil palm both as an estate crop and as a\nsmallholder crop.\n11. Agriculture  policies  are  handled  by  a  range  of  bodies  including  the  Department  of\nAgriculture  and  Livestock  (DAL),  provincial  governments,  commodity  corporations,  and  the\nNational Agricultural Quarantine and Inspection Service. Commodity corporations such as the\nCopra Marketing Board,  the Cocoa Board, the Coffee Industry Corporation, and the Oil Palm\nIndustry Corporation, have powers under their legislative mandates to regulate the prices of\ninputs and outputs,  to control quality, and to impose compulsory levies  to fund their activities.\nThese powers are, however, under review. Extension services are the responsibility of each\ncommodity corporation as well as the provincial governments. Research is undertaken by the\nNational Agriculture Research Institute, which focuses mainly on food crops and livestock, and\nby the commodity corporations.\n12. Obtaining  commercial  financing  for  agricultural  development  in  PNG  is  fraught  with\ndifficulties.  Despite being relatively liquid, the commercial banks' loan portfolios are significantly\nunderweight in the agriculture sector.  Agriculture accounts for 24 percent of gross domestic\nproduct (GDP), but only 7 percent of business loans.  There is a reluctance among commercial\nlenders to target the agriculture sector due to difficulties in determining land ownership, low\ncommodity  prices,  long  gestation  periods  for  tree  crops,  and  the  logistical  difficulties  in\nsupervising loans spread over a wide geographic area.  As a result, borrowers are faced with\nhigh interest rates and onerous demands for collateral. These difficulties need to be overcome,\nand financing for the sector needs to be made available if the country is to return to a path of\nsustained economic growth.\nC.  Government Policies and Plans\n13. The  Government's  current  economic  policies  are  set  out  in  the  Medium-Term\nDevelopment  Strategy  (MTDS)  1997-2002:  A  Bridge  Into  the  21st  Century.  The  MTDS\nestablished a new direction for the National Government.  At the heart of the strategy is the goal\nof broad-based economic growth. Private sector development is to be encouraged by trade\nliberalization  and  other  measures  designed  to  improve  the  environment  for  private  sector\ninvestment.  The Government is thus moving away from an economic development strategy\nbased  upon  extensive  government  intervention  in  markets  and  commercial  activities,  to  a\nmarket-based economic development strategy. The reforms will benefit agriculture, including\nsemicommercial and commercial smallholders, plantations, and agroprocessing. These include\na phased trade liberalization program with average nominal tariff levels falling substantially over\nthe next five years, providing wide-ranging benefits to export-oriented agriculture.\n14. In September 2001,  the Government adopted the National Agriculture Development\nStrategy \u2013 Horizon 2002-2012. This new strategy has an overarching policy thrust: revitalize the\nagriculture  sector  through  facilitating  an  efficient  private  sector.4  The  policy  interventions\nproposed in this strategy include, among others, legislative reforms to consolidate agriculture\nsector legislation, organizational reforms of DAL, new provisions for agricultural credit, reform of\nthe technical extension system, and preparation of a National Agriculture Development Plan.\n                  \n4 The National Agriculture Development Strategy \u2013 Horizon 2002-2012: executive summary by the Secretary,\nDepartment of Agriculture and Livestock.", "4\n15. The Government has increasingly recognized the importance of agricultural production\nas a basis for the reduction of poverty in rural areas and for growth of the economy as a whole.\nMoreover, with few new high-return extractive ventures such as mining or forestry expected in\nthe near future, there has been a realization that the country will depend on the agriculture\nsector for a significant part of its future economic growth.  In this regard, the importance of\nremoving infrastructure and marketing constraints has been recognized, as has the value of the\nnucleus enterprise concept.\n16. The concept of using a private sector-managed NE as the basis for smallholder and\noutgrower development through the provision of a market as well as technical support has\nrecently  been  adopted  by  the  Government.  NEs  that  will  be  encouraged  are  those  agro-\nindustrial companies that are in a position to provide markets for smallholder products as well as\nthe technical and financial support and a good part of the infrastructure required to enable\nsmallholders to profitably access those markets.  In this sense, NEs to be promoted by the new\npolicy encompass, but are much broader than, the typical nucleus estates that are active in the\noil palm sector.  They could include rubber or copra factories or processing facilities; integrated\nlivestock  production  with  a  smallholder  outgrower  component;  aquaculture  ventures  with  a\nguaranteed marketing component; or the rehabilitation of abandoned cocoa, coffee, or coconut\nestates and associated processing facilities on a joint shareholder basis.\nD.  External Assistance to the Agriculture Sector\n17. PNG  has  received  external  assistance  from  a  host  of  agencies  for  agricultural\ndevelopment.  The  main  sources  of  this  assistance  have  been  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  the\nEuropean Union, and the Australian Agency for International Development. Appendix 2 presents\na list of external assistance to the agriculture sector.\n18. ADB has approved loans for agricultural development in PNG totalling $172 million since\n1976.  In  the  late  1970s  and  1980s,  the  focus  of  ADB  loans  was  on  the  development  of\nsmallholder tree crops. This included a rural development project in East Sepik in 1976 (cocoa\nand rubber) and smallholder development projects for rubber in the Cape Rodney area,5 oil\npalm in West New Britain,6 and cocoa and coconut development in East New Britain.7 The focus\nof ADB loans in the 1990s shifted towards institutional strengthening and improved extension\nservice delivery. The Agricultural Program Loan for the Agricultural Sector Program (ASP)\nrepresented the most ambitious attempt by ADB to assist in rationalizing the PNG agriculture\nsector.8 More recent ADB assistance includes the Agricultural Research and Extension Project\nin 19919 and the ongoing 1998 Smallholder Support Services Pilot Project.10\n                  \n5 Loan  656-PNG(SF), Cape Rodney Smallholder Development Project, for $15 million, approved on 24 November\n1983.\n6 Loans  785/784-PNG(SF), West New Britain Smallholder Development Project, for $29.9 million, approved on 14\nAugust 1986.\n7 Loans 852/853-PNG(SF), East New Britain Smallholder Development Project, for $10 million, approved on 3\nNovember 1987.\n8  Loans 998/997-PNG(SF), Agriculture Sector Program for $80 million, approved on 12 December 1989.\n9 Loans 1110-PNG(SF), Agricultural Research and Extension Program, for $22 million, approved on 29 October\n1991; TA 1375-PNG, Agricultural Research and Extension (Phase 1), for $56,500, approved on 19 September\n1990; TA 1587-PNG, Agricultural Research and Extension (Phase 2), for $436,000, approved on 29 October 1991.\n10 Loan 1652-PNG, Smallholder Support Services Pilot Project, for $7.6 million, approved on 10 December 1998.", "5\nE.  ADB Sector Strategy\n19. ADB\u2019s Country Operational Strategy (COS) for PNG was adopted in October 1998.  It is\nin line with the Government\u2019s Medium Term Development Strategy. The COS aims at poverty\nreduction  through  improved  governance,  private  sector  development,  and  improved  social\nservices. Agricultural development plays a key role and is identified as a strategic priority.\nTransport infrastructure, social infrastructure, and rural development are considered critical to\nensure sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The basic presumption of the\nCOS11  is that broad-based economic growth, led by the private sector, is the most effective\nmeans of poverty reduction in the long term.\n20. The COS considers that the Government does not have a comparative advantage over\nthe private sector in delivering support services for agriculture. The focus of the strategy is to\nstrengthen government capacities for both policy management and provision of an enabling\nenvironment for the private sector. A similar approach is proposed in the rural financial services\nsubsector,  where  ADB  supports  an  increased  role  of  the  private  sector,  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), and cooperatives. For sustainable agricultural development to occur, the\nprivate agribusiness sector must be encouraged and enabled to take a primary role in such\ndevelopment. In addition, the development of rural infrastructure will facilitate the delivery of\nsocial services such as education and health, which will directly contribute to poverty reduction\nthrough human development.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n21. Recent policy dialogue with the Government has focused, among other themes, on the\nmeans to build on the initial encouraging results of the ADB Smallholder Support Services Pilot\nProject and encourage private sector ventures to undertake agricultural development activities.\nIn discussions undertaken in the context of agro-industrial development , several private sector\ncompanies  have  expressed  an  interest  in  setting  up  or  expanding  NEs,  which  could  be\ncombined  with  infrastructure  improvement  to  have  major  spin-off  benefits  for  surrounding\nsmallholders.   A task force from the Government is currently identifying opportunities for NE\ndevelopment. In some cases there is an interest in diversifying into new markets or developing\nnew products or higher value processing.  Other NEs are likely to express interest if a source of\nfunding for NE projects is to be established. Putting in place a policy environment that will\nencourage this type of development has now become a high priority.  This will need to include:\n(i) actions to revive or create mechanisms to provide development credit to rural\nsmallholders; and\n (ii) assistance with agriculture sector policy and institutional reform to ensure that\ncommodity corporations credibly perform their mandated role of representing and\nprotecting  producers  without  interfering  with  market  mechanisms;  concrete\nactivities to promote such structural reforms are included in the current PNG\nCountry Strategy and Program Update for 2002-2004.\n                  \n11Also in accordance with ADB's Private Sector Development Strategy and ADB's Poverty Reduction Strategy.", "6\nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN\nA.  Rationale\n22. PNG is considered to have a comparative advantage in most of the tree crops and in\nmany high-value food crops. Agro-industry enterprises operating in PNG have demonstrated\nthat the private sector is in a position to increase rural household incomes by providing inputs,\nextension services, and assured markets for smallholder production. However, agribusiness\ninvestment faces the following constraints for expanded growth:\n(i) law and order issues and the overall policy environment which distorts price\nsignals and adds to the uncertainty and risk;\n(ii) institutional weakness, which results in poor service delivery;\n(iii)  lack of infrastructure and also poor maintenance, affecting the flow of inputs and\nproducts to the markets; and\n(iv)  lack  of  credit  and  equity  capital    for  such  ventures  (including  credit  for\nsmallholders).\n23.  Strong interest is being shown by the private sector, smallholders, and concerned\nGovernment  agencies  in  using  NE-smallholder  partnerships  to  achieve  mutually  beneficial\nresults.  While  several  potential  ventures  combining  a  private  sector  NE,  smallholder\ndevelopment, and associated infrastructure have been, and many more are being, identified,\nthese need to be taken up for detailed preparation. More importantly, a coordinated approach is\nrequired to establish a mechanism for screening, policy analysis, and awareness building.\nBased on careful up-front analyses of the enabling environment, detailed feasibility studies need\nto be undertaken, marketing studies need to be carried out, social benefits and impacts need to\nbe assessed, and environmental impact assessments must be done.  In addition, there is a\nneed, in some cases, to field test some of the technology or institutional arrangements being\nproposed. The conclusion was that, prior to considering direct project financing for NE-focused\ndevelopment, it is desirable to help develop agrobased NE project concepts and to assess their\nviability thoroughly.\n24. Under  the  proposed  TA  Loan,  based  on  a  central  unit  to  undertake  the  enabling\nenvironment-related work, assistance will be provided to help package subprojects consisting of\nprivate sector NE ventures along with associated  smallholder and outgrower schemes and\ninfrastructure  improvements.  Support  will  be  provided  to  assess  social  and  environmental\nimpact; assess the subprojects' economic and financial viability; and provide assistance with\nmarket strategies, business development, and technology improvement.\n25. It  is  envisaged  that  such  assistance  will  help  to  overcome  the  difficulties  currently\nexperienced in agriculture sector activities in PNG. The TA Loan will be used for obtaining\ndevelopment finance from multilateral, bilateral, and commercial sources including ADB for the\nproject proposals developed.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n26. The  objective  of  the  proposed  TA  Loan  is  to  identify  and  prepare  a  pipeline  of\nsubprojects based on NE and smallholder development that could be packaged into a series of\nprojects for financing by ADB and/or other financing agencies.  The TA will consist of three\nactivities:  (i) initial project identification and screening, (ii) subproject feasibility studies, and (iii)\npilot project activities.  The process of developing the proposals will include: (i) close interaction", "7\nwith other major  stakeholders, (ii) a promotional campaign to create awareness of the TA, (iii)\nbackground analysis of the enabling environment, and (iv) use of local expertise with knowledge\nin relevant areas.\n1.  Initial Project Identification and Screening\n27. Several potential private sector-based NE and smallholder development projects have\nbeen identified in PNG and the Department of National Planning and Monitoring (DNPM) is\ncurrently engaged in identifying further opportunities.  Initial activities will thus entail screening\nthe project proposals identified so far while at the same time publicizing the availability of\nfunding for feasibility studies and pilot projects under the TA Loan for other interested parties.\nThis will be undertaken by a small Technical Assistance Screening and Management Unit\n(TASMU).  The  unit  will  include,  among  others,  a  project  economist/financial  analyst,  an\nagronomist, an engineer, an environmental specialist, and a social specialist.  This team will\nalso be able to call on additional specialist consultant expertise as required such as institutional,\nmarketing,  and  enterprise  financing  specialists.  Appendix  3  presents  core  eligibility  and\nselection criteria for both subproject feasibility studies and pilot project activities.\n28. TASMU will undertake necessary background assessments relating to the investment\nenvironment for the priority agro-industry areas. Then, each proposal put forward to TASMU will\nbe screened to establish its prima facie viability.  For proposals that appear viable   after the\npreliminary rapid appraisals, terms of reference (TOR) and cost estimates will be prepared for\nstudies that will lead to a full technical, financial, social and economic assessment of each\nproposal.  These proposals will then be assessed by a screening committee made up of\nrepresentatives of ADB, the Government, and the private sector. Those proposals passing this\nscrutiny will then be approved for funding of subproject  feasibility studies.  Similarly, in the case\nof pilot project activities, for those proposals that have been positively assessed after the\npreliminary  rapid  appraisal,  TASMU  will  prepare  micro-investment  plans  and  related  cost\nestimates. These pilot project proposals will be recommended for immediate funding support\nand submitted to the screening committee for approval.\n2.  Subproject  Feasibility Studies\n29. It is expected that  40-50 feasibility study proposals will be presented to TASMU, and\nthat of these about  20 will be approved by the screening committee.  The studies approved\nmay be simple supplementary activities to complete the required range of studies for already\nwell developed proposals (i.e., environmental impact assessments, marketing studies, or social\nassessments)  or  they  may  be  full  feasibility  studies  looking  at  all  aspects  of  a  particular\nproposal.  Part of the work to be undertaken for these activities will be project packaging for\ncommercial  or  multilateral  financing,  making  sure  that  all  investments  as  well  as  the\ncontributions  of  all  proponents  are  properly  identified  and  costed,  and  that  financing\nopportunities are optimally allocated.\n30. The subproject studies will be undertaken by teams of consultants suitably selected by\nTASMU, and work will be carried out under the supervision of this  unit.\n31. On the basis of 20 subproject studies costing on average $150,000 each, $3.0 million\nhas been allocated for this component.   Funds will be provided to the NEs  on an initial grant\nbasis.  Subproject  feasibility  study  costs  exceeding  $100,000  will  be  repayable  to  the\nGovernment should the subproject be taken up for subsequent funding by ADB or any other\npotential funding source.", "8\n3.  Pilot Project Activities\n32. Funding will be available to finance small-scale pilot project activities to be undertaken\nby those NEs wishing to test a proposed technology or a set of institutional arrangements.\nAccess to this funding will be on the basis of a counterpart contribution by the NE.  The sum of\n$1.5 million has been allocated to this component.  The maximum single pilot project investment\nwill be $200,000.  The NE will be required to contribute at least 33 percent of each pilot\ninvestment.   Pilot activities will be selected on the basis that the investment undertaken and the\nsubsequent follow-up investments that will be facilitated will have important social and economic\nbenefits for the population in the area. All pilot activities will be financed on a grant basis.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n33. The total cost of the program is estimated at $7.4 million, of which $4.5 million (about 60\npercent) is foreign exchange and the balance local currency equivalent. Detailed cost estimates\nare provided in Appendix 4. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $5.9 million equivalent\nfrom its Special Funds resources to finance all of the foreign exchange and a portion of the local\ncurrency requirement of the TA. The proposed ADB loan will have a repayment period of 32\nyears including an 8-year grace period and will carry an interest charge of 1.0 per cent per\nannum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.  The Borrower will be the\nIndependent State of Papua New Guinea. The remaining local currency cost of about $1.5\nmillion equivalent will be financed by the Government of PNG ($1.0 million) and the NEs ($0.5\nmillion).  A summary financing plan is shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total Cost Percent\nExchange Currency\nADB 4.5 1.4 5.9 80.0\nGovernment 0.0 1.0 1.0 14.0\nNEs 0.0 0.5 0.5 6.0\n     Total 4.5 2.9 7.4 100.0\nV.  IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS\nA.  Executing Agency\n34. The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  Loan  will  be  DNPM  which  is  responsible  for\ndevelopment  and investment planning in different sectors and is considered the appropriate\nagency to undertake this program, which is expected to involve investment in activities from\naquaculture to roads. DNPM has been the counterpart agency of ADB during the past two and a\nhalf decades and is thus well experienced with ADB's procedures, guidelines, and project\npreparation requirements.", "9\nB.  Organization and Management\n35. In view of the need to attract private sector participants, the program management\nstructure will be made as independent as possible.  To this end, TASMU will be set up in an\nindependent office.12  The unit will be headed jointly by a consultant appointed under the TA and\na senior appointee nominated by DNPM.  Including those two, it will have a core staff of five\ndomestic  experts  and  one  international  expert.  This  expertise  will  be  supplemented  by\ninternationally  recruited  consultants  and  domestic  experts  seconded  from  educational  and\nresearch institutes, the private sector, and government line agencies as required. TASMU will\nbe responsible for screening initial proposals for support under the TA and for recommending\nthem to the screening committee for approval, preparing TOR for subproject feasibility studies,\ncontracting out and supervising these studies once they have been approved, and preparing\npilot project  proposals for funding.\n36. In  particular,  the  initial  project  identification  and  screening  process  will  include  the\nfollowing:\n(i)  preliminary rapid appraisals by  TASMU of all initial subproject proposals submitted to\nTASMU;\n(ii)  preparation by TASMU of either (a) consultants' TOR and related cost estimates for\ncarrying out full technical, financial, social, and economic assessments of those\nsubproject proposals whose prima facie viability has been established as a result of\nthe  preliminary  rapid  appraisals  and  that  are  deemed  by  TASMU  to  merit  a\nsubproject feasibility study; or (b) micro-investment plans and related cost estimates\nfor small-scale pilot projects that have been identified in the course of the preliminary\nrapid appraisals and that are recommended for immediate funding support; and\n(iii) review by the screening committee of all rapidly appraised subproject proposals\nreferred  to  it  by  TASMU,  and  approval  by  the  screening  committee  of  (a)\napproximately 20 in-depth feasibility studies for funding, and (b) eight or more small-\nscale pilot project activities for funding.\n37. TASMU  will  be  supervised  by  the  screening  committee,  which  will  include\nrepresentatives from DNPM (the chair), ADB, DAL, the Rural Industries Council, the Investment\nPromotion Authority and the National Agriculture Research Institute. The screening committee\nwill meet at least once every two months to review proposals screened and prepared by\nTASMU.  Once a proposal for either a feasibility study or a pilot project is approved by the\nscreening committee, it will be eligible for financing, under the supervision of TASMU.\n38. The  subproject  feasibility  study  proponents  and  the  pilot  activity  proponents  will\ncontribute to the implementation of the TA activities in various ways.  For the feasibility studies,\nthe proponents will provide access to any previous studies,  subproject cost estimates,  or\nbackground research that they may have undertaken on their own.  They will also provide\naccess to the proposed project site  for TASMU and the subproject feasibility study consultants;\norganize stakeholder meetings with the local population for visiting consultant teams; provide\nlogistical support in and around the subproject area; and, if necessary and feasible, provide\nlogistical support in and around Port Moresby for the feasibility study teams.\n                  \n12To be provided by the Rural Industries Council or the Investment Promotion Authority and to be agreed upon\nbefore loan effectiveness.", "10\n39. For the pilot project activities, proponents' contributions of  33 percent of the costs  will\nconsist of minor civil works,  planting materials, labor, and/or technical input in the form of\nspecialized expertise (for example in aquaculture, animal husbandry, or tree crop agronomy). It\nwill also include any taxes and duties on equipment and materials purchased with TA loan\nproceeds when taxes and duties are not paid by the Government. In addition, as with the\nfeasibility studies, the pilot project proponents will provide logistical support to TASMU during\nrapid  rural  appraisals,    organize  stakeholder  meetings  as  required,  and  provide  logistical\nsupport in and around the pilot project  area.\n40. With respect to smallholders, and NGOs' participation and consultation, TASMU, all\nthroughout  project  implementation,  will  (i)  identify  specific  mechanisms  for  smallholder\nparticipation in planning and implementation of both feasibility studies and pilot projects in the\nsubproject areas, and (ii) promote NGO involvement in facilitating the formation of smallholders'\nassociations, social mobilization, and awareness-raising activities in the subproject area aimed\nat effective smallholder participation in both feasibility  studies and pilot project activities.\n41. Supervision of the activities of TASMU will be through monthly reports submitted to the\nscreening committee and quarterly reports submitted to the Secretary, DNPM and ADB. Overall\nimplementation  arrangements  will  be  reviewed  by  DNPM  and  ADB  one  year  after  loan\neffectiveness.  TOR  for  TASMU  are  provided  in  Appendix  5.  A  flow  chart  of  program\nresponsibilities and activities is shown in Appendix 6.\nC.  Implementation Schedule\n42. The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  24-month  period.  Start-up  activities  will  be\nrecruitment and training of staff ,and initial identification and  selection of project proposals.\nSince some proposals have been identified, it is expected that subproject feasibility studies\ncould begin within the first three months, after TOR have been prepared and consultants\nrecruited.  The main operations will take place over an 18-month period with a final 3 months at\nthe end of the implementation period to finish off ongoing studies and prepare a final report and\nreview.  An  implementation  schedule  is  shown  in  Appendix  7.  It  is  estimated  that  the\nimplementation period will start in April 2002 and end in April 2004.\nD.  Procurement\n43. Goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.    These  will,  in  the  main,  consist  of  (i)  office  equipment  and\nsupplies, vehicle leasing, and other support requirements  for TASMU and the subproject study\nconsultants (a list of such requirements is in Appendix 8);  and (ii) equipment, materials,\nvehicles, and/or very minor civil works for the pilot project  component. Under the first category\n(consultant requirements), procurement of the various supply contracts will be done on a direct\npurchase basis. Under the second category (pilot projects), contract packages amounting up to\n$100,000 or less will be procured through direct purchase, while contract packages above\n$100,000 will be procured through international shopping. In addition, with respect to pilot\nprojects,    minor  civil  works  might  include  such  items  as  small  wharfs  and  pontoons  for\naquaculture, fencing and water supply for cattle development, and minor feeder road upgrading\nto improve access to smallholder supplies.  These activities will be undertaken by the NE\nproponents  themselves  and  will  be  of  such  a  small  nature  as  to  be  unlikely  to  interest\ninternational or even domestic contractors.  Any procurement for equipment and materials\nexceeding $100,000 will be carried out by international shopping.", "11\nE.  Consulting Services\n44. All consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.    Two  types  of  consultants  will  be  required  for  the  TA:    (i)  domestic  and\ninternational  consultants  to  staff  TASMU  and  (ii)  consultants  recruited  for  the  subproject\nfeasibility studies.  A total of 90 person-months of consulting services will be required to staff\nTASMU.  This will include 18 person-months of international and 72 person-months of domestic\nconsultancy.  International expertise will be required in project design and analysis, while the\ndomestic expertise required will include agricultural development, infrastructure engineering,\nsocial analysis and impact assessment, and environmental analysis and impact assessment.\n(TOR for individual experts are provided in Section B of Appendix 5).  This expertise will be\nprovided through a firm recruited on the basis of international bidding.  As the TA is being\nprovided  as  a  loan,  selection  of  the  consulting  services  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the\nGovernment.  In view of the complexity of the consulting package and the direct link to future\nlending from ADB, the Government has agreed that recruitment of consultants  for TASMU will\nbe  undertaken  in  close  cooperation  with  ADB.    In  this  regard,  ADB  will  assist  with  the\nshortlisting, ranking, and selection of the firm as well as with contract negotiations.\n45. A total of 200 person-months (100 international and 100 domestic) with a wide range of\nexpertise will be required to undertake the subproject studies, however, prior to the studies\nbeing identified it is not realistically possible to determine the exact expertise required.  This will\nmost likely include agricultural development, agroprocessing, livestock production, aquaculture,\nmarketing,  social  impact  assessment,  environmental  impact  assessment,  institutional\narrangements,  and  financial  analysis.    However  other  disciplines  may  also  be  required.\nMoreover, most of the studies will be rather small in nature, and any individual study is unlikely\nto exceed $500,000 in cost.\n46. In view of this situation and in order to reduce the time needed to recruit consultants for\nsubproject studies, TASMU will prepare a long list of international consulting firms with the\nexpertise required for participation in the TA Loan (feasibility studies).  Once TOR and cost\nestimates for the studies have been prepared, a short list of three firms will be asked to submit a\nshort proposal and curricula vitae for the various experts being sought.  These submissions will\nthen be ranked by TASMU, and the first-ranked firm selected for contract negotiations.  If these\nshould prove unsuccessful, negotiations will proceed with the second-ranked firm.\nF.  Disbursement\n47. Fees for consulting services will be paid by direct payment on the basis of certification by\nTASMU of services rendered.  To ensure timely release of the funds required for pilot activities\nand incidental expenditures such as office equipment and vehicle hire, the Government will,\nimmediately after the loan becomes effective, establish an imprest account in a reputable\ncommercial  bank.  The  initial  amount  for  deposit  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed\n$500,000 equivalent.  Further payments will be made from and to this account for all eligible\nexpenditures under the TA. Replenishment will be on the basis of documented liquidation of\nexpenditures from the account. This will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook.  ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedure will be used for liquidating advance\npayments from the imprest account not exceeding $50,000 equivalent.", "12\nG.  Reporting Requirements\n48. TASMU will be responsible for providing monthly summary reports on its operations to\nall the members of the screening committee.  It will also be responsible for submitting quarterly\nreports on TA operations to the Secretary, DNPM and ADB.  All subproject feasibility study\nreports and reports documenting the results of pilot project  activities will be submitted to ADB,\nDNPM, and any other concerned agency as soon as they have been completed.\n49. Prior to the completion of the first year of TA activities, a consolidated report on its\nresults will be submitted as the basis for a full review by ADB and the Government of the TA\nactivities and implementation arrangements.  A final TA completion report covering all aspects\nof the TA and summarizing its experiences, successes, and failures will be submitted to ADB by\nDNPM within three months of the completion of all field work.\nH.  Social and Environmental Aspects\n50. The subprojects to be examined during implementation of the TA Loan will entail a wide\nrange of activities in all parts of the country.  They will doubtless be associated with a number of\nsocial and environmental issues and concerns, both negative and positive.  By including a social\nand  gender  dimension  specialist  and  an  environmental  specialist  as  key  members  of  the\nTASMU team, an effort has been made to ensure that (i) social and environmental concerns will\nbe fully taken into account from the time of the formulation of detailed selection criteria to the\ncompletion of the feasibility studies,  (ii) opportunities will exist to maximize potential social and\nenvironmental benefits and minimize social and environmental conflicts and costs, and (iii) the\ninvestment proposals will be tested on the basis of social and environmental parameters as well\nas technical and financial parameters. Moreover, the TA Loan provides the opportunity to\nrecommend social and environmental mitigation measures for investments that might otherwise\nhave proceeded on their own without adequate social or environmental safeguards.  In this\nregard, an initial environmental examination or environmental impact assessment and a social\nimpact assessment will be required for each subproject. Model TOR for environmental and\nsocial impact studies for individual subprojects have been included in Supplementary Appendix\nG.\nVI.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Benefits\n51. The TA Loan will provide the Government and the private sector with the opportunity to\ntest a new modality in development financing that is meant to bring out the combined benefits of\nthe large private sector (NE), the small private sector (smallholders and outgrowers) and the\npublic sector (through infrastructure provision) working together to stimulate economic growth in\nthe previously neglected rural areas of the country.  The TA Loan will allow the preparation of\ninvestment packages that would not otherwise have been possible and the testing of such\npackages through full feasibility analysis.  Bringing outside advice and scrutiny will allow the\nfurtherance of new practices and concepts that may not have been considered by the status\nquo  entities  in  either  the  public  or  the  private  sector  and  also  will  ensure  a  range  of\nenvironmental and social safeguards that may not have been taken into account without an\nexogenous point of view or advice.", "13\nB.  Risks\n52. The main risks are the following: (i) there may not be sufficient interest on the part of the\nprivate sector (NEs) and the smallholders; (ii) the quality of work (feasibility studies and pilot\nproject activities) may be less than satisfactory; and (iii) the expected follow-up financing may\nnot be forthcoming. The issue of long-term sustainability of TASMU has also been raised.\n53. The purpose of the TA Loan is to ensure project quality at entry. Sustainability of the\nquality assurance mechanisms like TASMU and the screening committee beyond the TA Loan\nimplementation  period  is  not  essential.  The  process  to  be  adopted  should  lead  to  the\nidentification and selection of the most appropriate mechanism for coordination among major\nstakeholders,  promotion  of  the  concept/project  opportunities,  and  up-front  screening\nmechanisms.\n54. The private sector has already expressed interest in the concept. Detailed preparation is\nthe best way to screen and develop project proposals with their ownership. Agro-industry has\npotential in PNG. By organizing NE-smallholder partnerships, local law and order issues can be\npositively addressed. The TA Loan can only increase the interest of potential financiers. Regular\nreview and close monitoring of its implementation will be undertaken to deal with potential\ndifficulties to minimize the risks.\nVII.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n55. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances,  which have been incorporated into the Loan Agreement:\n(i) The Government will ensure that technical personnel in its employ such as the\nstaffs of research institutes and universities will make their services available to\nTASMU as required.\n(ii)  The Government, through DNPM and TASMU, will  ensure that (a) environmental\nconcerns are fully taken into account from the time of the formulation of selection\ncriteria to the completion of the subproject feasibility studies; (b) opportunities\nexist to maximize potential environmental benefits and minimize environmental\nconflicts and costs; and (c) any investment proposal resulting from a subproject\nfeasibility study is tested on the basis of environmental parameters as well as\ntechnical and financial parameters.\n(iii)  All environmental mitigation measures identified as the result of a subproject\nfeasibility study or pilot project investment plan will be incorporated into the\nproject  design  and  followed  during  project  construction,  operation,  and\nmaintenance in consultation with the Government's Office of Environment and\nConservation and in accordance with ADB's environmental guidelines.\n(iv)  Any land acquisition and resettlement issues that arise will be dealt with in\naccordance with ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and ADB's Handbook\non Resettlement.", "14\nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n56. The following conditions will need to be met before the loan can be declared effective:\n(i)  The Government must have appointed a PNG national with both public and private\nsector experience to act as joint head of TASMU.\n(ii) The Government must have entered into an agreement with a private sector or\nquasi-private sector entity acceptable to ADB under which that entity agrees to act as\nhost to TASMU.\nVIII.

General\n1. As outlined in the implementation arrangements, approval for funding of a series of\nfeasibility studies and PPs to be financed under the Technical Assistance (TA) Loan will be the\nresponsibility of a screening committee composed of representatives of the Asian Development\nBank, the public sector, and the private sector. Proposals presented to the committee will\nconsist of (i) subproject feasibility study (SFS) proposals,  and (ii)  pilot project (PP) proposals.\nPrior to presentation of proposals to the committee, the Technical Assistance Screening and\nManagement Unit (TASMU) will be responsible for the initial screening of all proposals, for\npackaging  SFS  and  PP  proposals    into  \"bankable\"  subprojects  and  preparing  Terms  of\nReference (TOR) for the feasibility studies, for assessing and costing PP proposals, and for\nmaking recommendations on approval to the committee.  Once funds are approved by the\ncommittee, TASMU will be responsible for (i) consultant recruitment, (ii) supervision of the SFS,\nand (iii) monitoring implementation of PP activities.\n2. TASMU will be staffed by a full-time team of six. Five of these will be consultants (one\ninternational  and  four  domestic)  with  the  following  expertise:  project  design  and  analysis,\nagriculture, engineering, social impact assessment and environmental impact assessment. The\nsixth member of TASMU will be a senior appointee nominated by the Department of National\nPlanning and Monitoring, who will function jointly as team leader for the unit in conjunction with\nthe project analyst/team leader. TASMU will also have the ability and funding to call upon\nspecialist international and domestic expertise to assist with specific subjects.\n3. Each SFS  or PP proposal submitted to TASMU will be examined by the team during a\nshort  field  visit,  during  which  a  preliminary  rapid  appraisal  and  a  preliminary  social  and\nenvironmental impact assessment will be carried out.  This will include an initial assessment of\nthe financial viability of the proposed project, the technology being proposed, quantifiable costs\nand benefits, marketing prospects, supporting infrastructure requirements, social benefits, and\npotential environmental concerns.  Institutional arrangements and requirements will also be\nexamined, as will the degree of involvement or sponsorship of the provincial and/or national\ngovernment.  TASMU team will also examine how to maximize the positive social impact of the\nproposal  and  will  provide  advice  or  assistance  as  to  how  to  formulate  or  reformulate  the\nproposal so that it meets a predetermined set of selection criteria: (i) prima facie economic and\nfinancial viability, (ii) positive social impact and poverty reduction potential, (iii) no significant\npotential environmental impacts, (iv) sustainability, (v) replicability (Appendix 3)1.\n4. For  SFS  proposals  that  meet  the  selection  criteria  and  appear  to  be  promising\ndevelopment initiatives, TOR and cost estimates  will be prepared and shortlists of consultants\nwill be requested from long-listed  consulting firms.  For PP proposals  that meet the selection\ncriteria, memoranda of agreement between TASMU and the NE on PP implementation, costs,\nand workplan will be prepared (see Appendix 3). Should a proposal not meet the selection\ncriteria and thus not be recommended for further financing, a full explanation will be provided for\nthe screening committee.\n                  \n1 Detailed selection criteria will be prepared by TASMU at the inception of the TA and approved by the screening\ncommittee.", "Appendix 5, page 2\n26\n5.
