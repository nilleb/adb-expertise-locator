Environmental impact and social assessments will\nbe  integral  components  of  the  subproject  preparatory  process\nsupported under the TA Loan.\n\nBoth  the  private  and  the  public  sectors  have  shown  a  strong\ninterest  in  the  concept  of  using  nucleus  enterprises  as  the\nfocus  for  wider  commercially  based  smallholder  and  agro-\nindustry  development,  with  a  view  to  improving  incomes  and\nstandards of living in rural areas throughout the country.\n\nIt  is  envisaged  that  nucleus  enterprises  will  provide  market\noutlets, \ntechnical  support,  planting  materials,  and  social\nservices that cannot be provided by either the public sector or\nthe smallholders themselves.\n\nUnder the proposed TA Loan, financing will be provided to help\nprepare  a  framework  for  nucleus  enterprise  development,\ndevelop  a  pipeline  of  suitable  subprojects,  and  undertake\npiloting of selected project activities.\n\nThe  TA  Loan  will  help  to  overcome  the  difficulties  currently\nexperienced \nfor  agriculture  sector\nactivities in Papua New Guinea.\n\nin  mobilizing \n\nfinance \n\nThe  proposed  TA  Loan  will  identify  and  prepare  a  pipeline  of\nsubprojects  based  on  the  nucleus  enterprise  and  smallholder\ndevelopment  concept  that  can  be  packaged  into  a  series  of\nsubproject  proposals    for  financing  by  the  Asian  Development\nBank  (ADB)  or  other  financing  agencies.    The  TA  Loan  will\nconsist  of  three  activities:    (i)  initial  project  identification  and\nscreening, (ii) subproject feasibility studies, and (iii) pilot project\nactivities.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  Loan  is  estimated  at  $7.4  million,  of\nwhich $4.5 million (about 60 percent) will be foreign exchange\nand the balance local currency equivalent.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing\nRights  4,616,000  ($5.9  million  equivalent)  from  its  Special\n\n\fPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 30 June 2004\n\nImplementation\nArrangements\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nDepartment of National Planning and Monitoring\n\nConsulting Services\n\nii\n\nFunds  resources to finance all of the foreign exchange and a\nportion  of  the  local  currency  requirement  of  the  TA  program.\nThe  TA  Loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  32  years,\nincluding  an  8-year  grace  period,  and  will  carry  an  interest\ncharge  of  1.0  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and\n1.5  percent  thereafter.    The  Borrower  will  be  the  Independent\nState of Papua New Guinea. The remaining local currency cost\nof  about  $1.5  million  equivalent  will  be  financed  by  the\nBorrower including private sector proponents.\n\nInitial  proposals  for  feasibility  studies  and  pilot  activities  under\nthe  TA  Loan  will  be  submitted  to  a  Technical  Assistance\nScreening  and  Management  Unit  (TASMU).  TASMU  will\nexamine  proposals  and  undertake  rapid  appraisals,  submitting\nreports  and  recommendations  to  a  screening  committee.\nProposals passed by the screening committee will be provided\nfunding  for  full  feasibility  studies  or  for  the  implementation  of\npilot activities.  These will be undertaken under the supervision\nof  TASMU.    Results  will  be  made  available  to  ADB,  the\nGovernment,  and  the  private  sector  proponents  for  possible\ninvestment funding.\n\nAll  consulting  services  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.    Two  types  of\nconsultants  will  be  required  for  the  TA:    (i)  domestic  and\ninternational  consultants  to  staff  TASMU,  and  (ii)  consultants\nrecruited  for  the  subproject  studies.    A  total  of  90  person-\nmonths  (18  international  and  72  domestic)  of  consulting\nservices will be required to staff TASMU. This expertise will be\nprovided  through  a  firm  recruited  on  the  basis  of  international\nbidding.  A  total  of  200  person-months  (100  international  and\n100 domestic) with a wide range of expertise will be required to\nundertake  the  subproject  studies.  The  required  expertise  will\ninclude  agriculture  development,  agroprocessing, \nlivestock\nproduction,  aquaculture,  marketing,  social  impact  assessment,\nenvironmental  impact  assessment,  institutional  arrangements,\nand  financial  analysis.  TASMU  will  prepare  a  long  list  of\ninternational  consulting \nthe  TA\nprogram, and ultimate selection for individual feasibility studies\nwill  be  on  the  basis  of  competitive  bidding  among  firms\ndepending on the expertise required.\n\nfor  participation \n\nfirms \n\nin \n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\n30 March 2004\n\nProject Benefits and\nBeneficiaries\n\nThe  TA  Loan  will  provide  the  Government  and  the  private\nsector  with \nin\n\ntest  new  modalities \n\nthe  opportunity \n\nto \n\n\fiii\n\ndevelopment  financing  that  are  intended  to  bring  out  the\ncombined  benefits  of  solid    private  sector  entities  (nucleus\nenterprises),  small  private  sector  beneficiaries  (smallholders\nand  outgrowers),  and  the  public  sector  (through  infrastructure\nprovision)  working  together  to  stimulate  sustainable  economic\ngrowth  in  the  previously  neglected  rural  areas  of  the  country.\nThe TA Loan will allow the preparation of investment packages\nthat would not otherwise have been possible, and the testing of\nsuch  packages  through  full  feasibility  analysis  and  pilot\nactivities.    Significant  poverty  reduction  benefits  are  expected\nfrom the implementation of subprojects identified and prepared\nin this way.\n\n\f1.\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  loan  to  the  Independent  State  of  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  for\nNucleus Agro-Enterprises.\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn  2000,  the  Government  of  PNG  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian  Development\n2.\n(ADB) for the preparation of an agro-industry development project to generate income-earning\nopportunities  for  the  rural  population.  A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  was\napproved  in  November  2000.1  The  consultants  were  fielded  in  January  2001,  and  the  final\nreport was presented to ADB and the Government in May 2001.\n\nto \n\ntechnology  needed \n\nExperience  has  shown  that  nucleus  enterprises  (NEs)  in  rural  areas  can  provide  the\n3.\nmarket  outlets  and  access \nto  support  smallholder  agricultural\ndevelopment.    It  was  determined  that  there  are  private  sector  enterprises  eager  to  obtain\nfunding  for  this  kind  of  development  in  PNG.  The  Government  and  the  PPTA  consultants\nidentified various nucleus enterprise development proposals for which feasibility studies would\nbe  required  to  prepare  them  for  financing.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  concluded  that  support\nwould  be  required  to  assist  these  enterprises  and  their  potential  smallholders  to  develop\nproposals  to  the  level  where  they  could  be  evaluated  for  financing  by  potential  financiers,\nincluding ADB.\n\nIn view of these circumstances a TA loan was proposed to assist the Government and\n4.\nindividual private sector enterprises in undertaking the preparatory work required, covering both\nthe proposals identified during the PPTA and those later identified. During a Post Fact-Finding\nMission2  undertaken  in  early  September  2001,  the  scope,  design,  and  implementation\narrangements for such a TA Loan were agreed to in consultation with the Government, private\nsector representatives, and other major funders of the rural sector. The TA Loan framework is\nattached as Appendix 1.\n\nA. \n\nPoverty in the Rural Sector\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nPNG  has  a  total  population  of  5.2  million,  which  is  the  largest  among  the  island\n5.\ndeveloping countries in the Pacific. It has a very heterogeneous population structure. There are\nseveral  thousand  separate  communities  and  over  650  language  groups  with  very  different\ncultures.    About  85  percent  of  this  population  is  estimated  to  live  in  isolated  rural  areas,  with\nmost  people  cut  off  from  the  capital,  Port  Moresby,  by  either  rugged  mountains  or  the  sea.\nEconomic and social disparities are severe, with PNG ranking last on both the United Nations\nDevelopment  Programme  human  development    and  human  poverty  indexes  for  the  Pacific\nnations. This status largely reflects a relatively low rate of economic growth, the underfunding of\nessential  services,  and  the  difficulty  of  providing  these  services  across  remote  and  scattered\nregions.\n\n                  \n\n1 TA 3545-PNG:  Agro-Industry Development for $500,000, approved on 14 November 2000.\n2 The  Mission  comprised  D.  Ponzi,  Senior  Economist  (Environment)/Mission  Leader  and  E.  Breckner,  Staff\nConsultant. Mr. R. Siy, Manager, Office of Pacific Operations, also assisted and guided the Mission from 31 August\nto 6 September.\n\n\f2\n\n6.\nThe country\u2019s economy is dualistic with an export-oriented and capital intensive minerals\nsector  operating  in  parallel  with  a  traditional  subsistence  economy.    Despite  significant  wealth\nhaving been generated  over the last 20 years, the minerals sector has provided relatively few\nemployment  opportunities  either  directly  or  indirectly.    Subsistence  agriculture  remains  the\ndominant  way  of  life,  with  more  than  85  percent  of  the  population  relying  on  household\nproduction  to  meet  their  daily  nutritional  requirements.    For  many  households,  participation  in\nthe cash economy involves only the sale of surplus crops or the planting of small stands of tree\ncrops  as  a  means  of  obtaining  small  amounts  of  cash  for  essential  traded  items,  school  fees,\nmedical  expenses,  and  consumer  goods.    For  others,  production  on  a  diversified  smallholder\nbasis  does  provide  a  regular  modest  cash  income  from  food  crop  production,  cash  crop\nproduction, fishing, and livestock raising.\n\n7.\nOf  the  37  percent  of  the  country's  population  classified  as  poor,  93  percent  live  in  the\nrural areas, where over 41 percent of the population live below the poverty line.3   Many of the\npoor are subsistence cultivators who earn some  cash income. Poverty is highest among those\nengaged in small-scale tree crop production, domestic agriculture, and hunting/gathering.  Tree\ncrop  producers  constitute  the  largest  group  of  the  poor  and  account  for  42  percent  of  the\npoverty-ranked population. The sharp decline in world prices for most tree crops in the past two\nyears has exacerbated poverty.\n\n8.\nThe  extent  of  poverty  in  rural  areas  is  a  result  of  low  levels  of  investment  in  capital,\ntechnology, infrastructure, education, and health. Rural people have limited access to education\nand health services. In terms of literacy, there are large regional disparities, with only one third\nof adults in the highland regions being literate compared with about 80 percent in the National\nCapital District and New Guinea Islands. Only half of the primary-age children in the Highlands\ngo  to  school,  and  only  one  in  seven  girls  completes  primary  school.  Lack  of  appropriate\neducation and/or training is a constraint to the commercialization of agriculture.\n\nB. \n\nThe Agriculture Sector\n\n9.\nThe  main  focus  of  commercial  agricultural  production  in  the  country  has  traditionally\nbeen export-oriented tree crops.  These include coffee, cocoa, coconut, and, more recently, oil\npalm and rubber.  These crops are grown by both smallholders and commercial estates.  In the\npast, commercial estates accounted for a large part of the country\u2019s production, but in the past\nfew  decades,  except  for  oil  palm,  the  trend  has  been  for  a  decline  in  the  number  of  estates.\nSmallholders  currently  account  for  80  percent  of  coconut,  75  percent  of  coffee,  70  percent  of\ncocoa, and 25 percent of oil palm production.\n\n10.\nCommercial  production  in  nontraditional  products,  including  poultry,  cattle,  and  food\ncrops,  has  shown  some  increase.  PNG  is  endowed  with  a  variety  of  agroclimatic  zones  and\nfavorable  soil  resources,  and  a  wide  range  of  tropical  and  temperate  crops  can  be  grown.\nHowever,  in  almost  all  cases,  expansion  of  the  area  in  existing  crops  or  the  establishment  of\nnew crops is constrained by a lack of markets, restricted access to credit, and land ownership\nuncertainties, exacerbated by severe infrastructure constraints.  One way of overcoming these\nconstraints  has  been  through  focusing  development  efforts  around  a  nucleus  commercial\nenterprise that can provide a market for smallholder crops, improved technology, and a degree\nof infrastructure support.  The best example of this  has been in oil palm production. Much of the\n\n                  \n\n3 Defined as K461 per adult equivalent per year in 1996 prices in the World Bank publication: Papua New Guinea:\n\nPoverty and Access to Public Services; World Bank; Washington, D.C.; October,1999\n\n\f3\n\noil palm development in the country has been through nucleus estate production supplemented\nby  smallholders  who  sell  their  produce  directly  to  the  estate  for  processing.    The  past  three\ndecades have seen a major expansion in the area of oil palm both as an estate crop and as a\nsmallholder crop.\n\n11.\nAgriculture  policies  are  handled  by  a  range  of  bodies  including  the  Department  of\nAgriculture  and  Livestock  (DAL),  provincial  governments,  commodity  corporations,  and  the\nNational  Agricultural  Quarantine  and  Inspection  Service.  Commodity  corporations  such  as  the\nCopra Marketing Board,  the  Cocoa  Board, the Coffee Industry Corporation, and the Oil Palm\nIndustry  Corporation,  have  powers  under  their  legislative  mandates  to  regulate  the  prices  of\ninputs and outputs,  to control quality, and to impose compulsory levies  to fund their activities.\nThese  powers  are,  however,  under  review.  Extension  services  are  the  responsibility  of  each\ncommodity  corporation  as  well  as  the  provincial  governments.  Research  is  undertaken  by  the\nNational Agriculture Research Institute, which focuses mainly on food crops and livestock, and\nby the commodity corporations.\n\nObtaining  commercial  financing  for  agricultural  development  in  PNG  is  fraught  with\n12.\ndifficulties.  Despite being relatively liquid, the commercial banks' loan portfolios are significantly\nunderweight  in  the  agriculture  sector.    Agriculture  accounts  for  24  percent  of  gross  domestic\nproduct (GDP), but only 7 percent of business loans.  There is a reluctance among commercial\nlenders  to  target  the  agriculture  sector  due  to  difficulties  in  determining  land  ownership,  low\ncommodity  prices,  long  gestation  periods  for  tree  crops,  and  the  logistical  difficulties  in\nsupervising  loans  spread  over  a  wide  geographic  area.    As  a  result,  borrowers  are  faced  with\nhigh interest rates and onerous demands for collateral. These difficulties need to be overcome,\nand financing for the sector needs to be made available if the country is to return to a path of\nsustained economic growth.\n\nC. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n13.\nThe  Government's  current  economic  policies  are  set  out  in  the  Medium-Term\nDevelopment  Strategy  (MTDS)  1997-2002:  A  Bridge  Into  the  21st  Century.  The  MTDS\nestablished a new direction for the National Government.  At the heart of the strategy is the goal\nof  broad-based  economic  growth.  Private  sector  development  is  to  be  encouraged  by  trade\nliberalization  and  other  measures  designed  to  improve  the  environment  for  private  sector\ninvestment.    The  Government  is  thus  moving  away  from  an  economic  development  strategy\nbased  upon  extensive  government  intervention  in  markets  and  commercial  activities,  to  a\nmarket-based  economic  development  strategy.  The  reforms  will  benefit  agriculture,  including\nsemicommercial and commercial smallholders, plantations, and agroprocessing. These include\na phased trade liberalization program with average nominal tariff levels falling substantially over\nthe next five years, providing wide-ranging benefits to export-oriented agriculture.\n\n14.\nIn  September  2001,    the  Government  adopted  the  National  Agriculture  Development\nStrategy \u2013 Horizon 2002-2012. This new strategy has an overarching policy thrust: revitalize the\nagriculture  sector  through  facilitating  an  efficient  private  sector.4  The  policy  interventions\nproposed  in  this  strategy  include,  among  others,  legislative  reforms  to  consolidate  agriculture\nsector legislation, organizational reforms of DAL, new provisions for agricultural credit, reform of\nthe technical extension system, and preparation of a National Agriculture Development Plan.\n\n4 The  National  Agriculture  Development  Strategy  \u2013  Horizon  2002-2012:  executive  summary  by  the  Secretary,\n\n                  \n\nDepartment of Agriculture and Livestock.\n\n\f4\n\nThe  Government  has  increasingly  recognized  the  importance  of  agricultural  production\n15.\nas a basis for the reduction of poverty in rural areas and for growth of the economy as a whole.\nMoreover, with few new high-return extractive ventures such as mining or forestry expected in\nthe  near  future,  there  has  been  a  realization  that  the  country  will  depend  on  the  agriculture\nsector  for  a  significant  part  of  its  future  economic  growth.    In  this  regard,  the  importance  of\nremoving infrastructure and marketing constraints has been recognized, as has the value of the\nnucleus enterprise concept.\n\nThe  concept  of  using  a  private  sector-managed  NE  as  the  basis  for  smallholder  and\n16.\noutgrower  development  through  the  provision  of  a  market  as  well  as  technical  support  has\nrecently  been  adopted  by  the  Government.  NEs  that  will  be  encouraged  are  those  agro-\nindustrial companies that are in a position to provide markets for smallholder products as well as\nthe  technical  and  financial  support  and  a  good  part  of  the  infrastructure  required  to  enable\nsmallholders to profitably access those markets.  In this sense, NEs to be promoted by the new\npolicy encompass, but are much broader than, the typical nucleus estates that are active in the\noil palm sector.  They could include rubber or copra factories or processing facilities; integrated\nlivestock  production  with  a  smallholder  outgrower  component;  aquaculture  ventures  with  a\nguaranteed marketing component; or the rehabilitation of abandoned cocoa, coffee, or coconut\nestates and associated processing facilities on a joint shareholder basis.\n\nD. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Agriculture Sector\n\n17.\nPNG  has  received  external  assistance  from  a  host  of  agencies  for  agricultural\ndevelopment.  The  main  sources  of  this  assistance  have  been  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  the\nEuropean Union, and the Australian Agency for International Development. Appendix 2 presents\na list of external assistance to the agriculture sector.\n\n18.\nADB has approved loans for agricultural development in PNG totalling $172 million since\n1976.  In  the  late  1970s  and  1980s,  the  focus  of  ADB  loans  was  on  the  development  of\nsmallholder tree crops. This included a rural development project in East Sepik in 1976 (cocoa\nand  rubber)  and  smallholder  development  projects  for  rubber  in  the  Cape  Rodney  area,5  oil\npalm in West New Britain,6 and cocoa and coconut development in East New Britain.7 The focus\nof  ADB  loans  in  the  1990s  shifted  towards  institutional  strengthening  and  improved  extension\nservice  delivery.  The  Agricultural  Program  Loan  for  the  Agricultural  Sector  Program  (ASP)\nrepresented  the  most  ambitious  attempt  by  ADB  to  assist  in  rationalizing  the  PNG  agriculture\nsector.8 More recent ADB assistance includes the Agricultural Research and Extension Project\nin 19919 and the ongoing 1998 Smallholder Support Services Pilot Project.10\n\n1983.\n\nAugust 1986.\n\nNovember 1987.\n\n5 Loan  656-PNG(SF), Cape Rodney Smallholder Development Project, for $15 million, approved on 24 November\n\n                  \n\n6 Loans  785/784-PNG(SF), West New Britain Smallholder Development Project, for $29.9 million, approved on 14\n\n7 Loans  852/853-PNG(SF),  East New Britain Smallholder Development Project,  for  $10  million,  approved  on  3\n\n8  Loans 998/997-PNG(SF), Agriculture Sector Program for $80 million, approved on 12 December 1989.\n9 Loans  1110-PNG(SF),  Agricultural Research and Extension Program,  for  $22  million,  approved  on  29  October\n1991;  TA  1375-PNG,  Agricultural Research and Extension (Phase 1),  for  $56,500,  approved  on  19  September\n1990; TA 1587-PNG, Agricultural Research and Extension (Phase 2), for $436,000, approved on 29 October 1991.\n\n10 Loan 1652-PNG, Smallholder Support Services Pilot Project, for $7.6 million, approved on 10 December 1998.\n\n\fE. \n\nADB Sector Strategy\n\n5\n\n19.\nADB\u2019s Country Operational Strategy (COS) for PNG was adopted in October 1998.  It is\nin line  with the Government\u2019s Medium Term Development Strategy. The COS aims at poverty\nreduction  through  improved  governance,  private  sector  development,  and  improved  social\nservices.  Agricultural  development  plays  a  key  role  and  is  identified  as  a  strategic  priority.\nTransport  infrastructure,  social  infrastructure,  and  rural  development  are  considered  critical  to\nensure  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  basic  presumption  of  the\nCOS11    is  that  broad-based  economic  growth,  led  by  the  private  sector,  is  the  most  effective\nmeans of poverty reduction in the long term.\n\n20.\nThe COS considers that the Government does not have a comparative advantage over\nthe  private  sector  in  delivering  support  services  for  agriculture.  The  focus  of  the  strategy  is  to\nstrengthen  government  capacities  for  both  policy  management  and  provision  of  an  enabling\nenvironment for the private sector. A similar approach is proposed in the rural financial services\nsubsector,  where  ADB  supports  an  increased  role  of  the  private  sector,  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), and cooperatives. For sustainable agricultural development to occur, the\nprivate  agribusiness  sector  must  be  encouraged  and  enabled  to  take  a  primary  role  in  such\ndevelopment.  In  addition,  the  development  of  rural  infrastructure  will  facilitate  the  delivery  of\nsocial services such as education and health, which will directly contribute to poverty reduction\nthrough human development.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nRecent policy dialogue with the Government has focused, among other themes, on the\n21.\nmeans to build on the initial encouraging results of the ADB Smallholder Support Services Pilot\nProject and encourage private sector ventures to undertake agricultural development activities.\nIn discussions undertaken in the context of agro-industrial development , several private sector\ncompanies  have  expressed  an  interest  in  setting  up  or  expanding  NEs,  which  could  be\ncombined  with  infrastructure  improvement  to  have  major  spin-off  benefits  for  surrounding\nsmallholders.      A  task  force  from  the  Government  is  currently  identifying  opportunities  for  NE\ndevelopment. In some cases there is an interest in diversifying into new markets or developing\nnew products or higher value processing.  Other NEs are likely to express interest if a source of\nfunding  for  NE  projects  is  to  be  established.  Putting  in  place  a  policy  environment  that  will\nencourage this type of development has now become a high priority.  This will need to include:\n\n(i)\n\n (ii)\n\nactions  to  revive  or  create  mechanisms  to  provide  development  credit  to  rural\nsmallholders; and\n\nassistance  with  agriculture  sector  policy  and  institutional  reform  to  ensure  that\ncommodity corporations credibly perform their mandated role of representing and\nprotecting  producers  without  interfering  with  market  mechanisms;  concrete\nactivities  to  promote  such  structural  reforms  are  included  in  the  current  PNG\nCountry Strategy and Program Update for 2002-2004.\n\n11 Also in accordance with ADB's Private Sector Development Strategy and ADB's Poverty Reduction Strategy.\n\n                  \n\n\f6\n\nIV. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\nPNG  is  considered  to  have  a  comparative  advantage  in  most  of  the  tree  crops  and  in\n22.\nmany  high-value  food  crops.  Agro-industry  enterprises  operating  in  PNG  have  demonstrated\nthat the private sector is in a position to increase rural household incomes by providing inputs,\nextension  services,  and  assured  markets  for  smallholder  production.  However,  agribusiness\ninvestment faces the following constraints for expanded growth:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nlaw  and  order  issues  and  the  overall  policy  environment  which  distorts  price\nsignals and adds to the uncertainty and risk;\ninstitutional weakness, which results in poor service delivery;\nlack of infrastructure and also poor maintenance, affecting the flow of inputs and\nproducts to the markets; and\nlack  of  credit  and  equity  capital    for  such  ventures  (including  credit  for\nsmallholders).\n\n23.\n  Strong  interest  is  being  shown  by  the  private  sector,  smallholders,  and  concerned\nGovernment  agencies  in  using  NE-smallholder  partnerships  to  achieve  mutually  beneficial\nresults.  While  several  potential  ventures  combining  a  private  sector  NE,  smallholder\ndevelopment,  and  associated  infrastructure  have  been,  and  many  more  are  being,  identified,\nthese need to be taken up for detailed preparation. More importantly, a coordinated approach is\nrequired  to  establish  a  mechanism  for  screening,  policy  analysis,  and  awareness  building.\nBased on careful up-front analyses of the enabling environment, detailed feasibility studies need\nto be undertaken, marketing studies need to be carried out, social benefits and impacts need to\nbe  assessed,  and  environmental  impact  assessments  must  be  done.    In  addition,  there  is  a\nneed,  in  some  cases,  to  field  test  some  of  the  technology  or  institutional  arrangements  being\nproposed. The conclusion was that, prior to considering direct project financing for NE-focused\ndevelopment, it is desirable to help develop agrobased NE project concepts and to assess their\nviability thoroughly.\n\nUnder  the  proposed  TA  Loan,  based  on  a  central  unit  to  undertake  the  enabling\n24.\nenvironment-related work, assistance will be provided to help package subprojects consisting of\nprivate  sector  NE  ventures  along  with  associated    smallholder  and  outgrower  schemes  and\ninfrastructure  improvements.  Support  will  be  provided  to  assess  social  and  environmental\nimpact;  assess  the  subprojects'  economic  and  financial  viability;  and  provide  assistance  with\nmarket strategies, business development, and technology improvement.\n\n25.\nIt  is  envisaged  that  such  assistance  will  help  to  overcome  the  difficulties  currently\nexperienced  in  agriculture  sector  activities  in  PNG.  The  TA  Loan  will  be  used  for  obtaining\ndevelopment finance from multilateral, bilateral, and commercial sources including ADB for the\nproject proposals developed.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n26.\nThe  objective  of  the  proposed  TA  Loan  is  to  identify  and  prepare  a  pipeline  of\nsubprojects based on NE and smallholder development that could be packaged into a series of\nprojects  for  financing  by  ADB  and/or  other  financing  agencies.    The  TA  will  consist  of  three\nactivities:  (i) initial project identification and screening, (ii) subproject feasibility studies, and (iii)\npilot project activities.  The process of developing the proposals will include: (i) close interaction\n\n\f7\n\nwith other major  stakeholders, (ii) a promotional campaign to create awareness of the TA, (iii)\nbackground analysis of the enabling environment, and (iv) use of local expertise with knowledge\nin relevant areas.\n\n1. \n\nInitial Project Identification and Screening\n\n27.\nSeveral  potential  private  sector-based  NE  and  smallholder  development  projects  have\nbeen  identified  in  PNG  and  the  Department  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring  (DNPM)  is\ncurrently engaged in identifying further opportunities.  Initial activities will thus entail screening\nthe  project  proposals  identified  so  far  while  at  the  same  time  publicizing  the  availability  of\nfunding for feasibility studies and pilot projects under the TA Loan for other interested parties.\nThis  will  be  undertaken  by  a  small  Technical  Assistance  Screening  and  Management  Unit\n(TASMU).  The  unit  will  include,  among  others,  a  project  economist/financial  analyst,  an\nagronomist,  an  engineer,  an  environmental  specialist,  and  a  social  specialist.    This  team  will\nalso be able to call on additional specialist consultant expertise as required such as institutional,\nmarketing,  and  enterprise  financing  specialists.  Appendix  3  presents  core  eligibility  and\nselection criteria for both subproject feasibility studies and pilot project activities.\n\n28.\nTASMU  will  undertake  necessary  background  assessments  relating  to  the  investment\nenvironment for the priority agro-industry areas. Then, each proposal put forward to TASMU will\nbe  screened  to  establish  its prima facie  viability.    For  proposals  that  appear  viable      after  the\npreliminary rapid appraisals, terms of reference (TOR) and cost estimates will be prepared for\nstudies  that  will  lead  to  a  full  technical,  financial,  social  and  economic  assessment  of  each\nproposal.    These  proposals  will  then  be  assessed  by  a  screening  committee  made  up  of\nrepresentatives of ADB, the Government, and the private sector. Those proposals passing this\nscrutiny will then be approved for funding of subproject  feasibility studies.  Similarly, in the case\nof  pilot  project  activities,  for  those  proposals  that  have  been  positively  assessed  after  the\npreliminary  rapid  appraisal,  TASMU  will  prepare  micro-investment  plans  and  related  cost\nestimates.  These  pilot  project  proposals  will  be  recommended  for  immediate  funding  support\nand submitted to the screening committee for approval.\n\n2. \n\nSubproject  Feasibility Studies\n\n29.\nIt  is  expected  that    40-50  feasibility  study  proposals  will  be  presented  to  TASMU,  and\nthat  of  these  about    20  will  be  approved  by  the  screening  committee.    The  studies  approved\nmay  be  simple  supplementary  activities  to  complete  the  required  range  of  studies  for  already\nwell developed proposals (i.e., environmental impact assessments, marketing studies, or social\nassessments)  or  they  may  be  full  feasibility  studies  looking  at  all  aspects  of  a  particular\nproposal.    Part  of  the  work  to  be  undertaken  for  these  activities  will  be  project  packaging  for\ncommercial  or  multilateral  financing,  making  sure  that  all  investments  as  well  as  the\ncontributions  of  all  proponents  are  properly  identified  and  costed,  and  that  financing\nopportunities are optimally allocated.\n\nThe subproject studies will be undertaken by teams of consultants suitably selected by\n\n30.\nTASMU, and work will be carried out under the supervision of this  unit.\n\n31.\nOn  the  basis  of  20  subproject  studies  costing  on  average  $150,000  each,  $3.0  million\nhas been allocated for this component.   Funds will be provided to the NEs  on an initial grant\nbasis.  Subproject  feasibility  study  costs  exceeding  $100,000  will  be  repayable  to  the\nGovernment  should  the  subproject  be  taken  up  for  subsequent  funding  by  ADB  or  any  other\npotential funding source.\n\n\f8\n\n3. \n\nPilot Project Activities\n\n32.\nFunding will be available to finance small-scale pilot project activities to be undertaken\nby  those  NEs  wishing  to  test  a  proposed  technology  or  a  set  of  institutional  arrangements.\nAccess to this funding will be on the basis of a counterpart contribution by the NE.  The sum of\n$1.5 million has been allocated to this component.  The maximum single pilot project investment\nwill  be  $200,000.    The  NE  will  be  required  to  contribute  at  least  33  percent  of  each  pilot\ninvestment.   Pilot activities will be selected on the basis that the investment undertaken and the\nsubsequent follow-up investments that will be facilitated will have important social and economic\nbenefits for the population in the area. All pilot activities will be financed on a grant basis.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n33.\nThe total cost of the program is estimated at $7.4 million, of which $4.5 million (about 60\npercent) is foreign exchange and the balance local currency equivalent. Detailed cost estimates\nare  provided  in  Appendix  4.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $5.9  million  equivalent\nfrom its Special Funds resources to finance all of the foreign exchange and a portion of the local\ncurrency  requirement  of  the  TA.  The  proposed  ADB  loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  32\nyears  including  an  8-year  grace  period  and  will  carry  an  interest  charge  of  1.0  per  cent  per\nannum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.  The Borrower will be the\nIndependent  State  of  Papua  New  Guinea.  The  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  about  $1.5\nmillion equivalent will be financed by the Government of PNG ($1.0 million) and the NEs ($0.5\nmillion).  A summary financing plan is shown in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Financing Plan\n\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal Cost\n\nPercent\n\nADB\nGovernment\nNEs\n     Total\n\n4.5\n0.0\n0.0\n4.5\n\n1.4\n1.0\n0.5\n2.9\n\n5.9\n1.0\n0.5\n7.4\n\n80.0\n14.0\n6.0\n100.0\n\nV. \n\nIMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS\n\nA. \n\nExecuting Agency\n\n34.\nThe  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  Loan  will  be  DNPM  which  is  responsible  for\ndevelopment    and  investment  planning  in  different  sectors  and  is  considered  the  appropriate\nagency  to  undertake  this  program,  which  is  expected  to  involve  investment  in  activities  from\naquaculture to roads. DNPM has been the counterpart agency of ADB during the past two and a\nhalf  decades  and  is  thus  well  experienced  with  ADB's  procedures,  guidelines,  and  project\npreparation requirements.\n\n\fB. \n\nOrganization and Management\n\n9\n\n35.\nIn  view  of  the  need  to  attract  private  sector  participants,  the  program  management\nstructure  will  be  made  as  independent  as  possible.    To  this  end,  TASMU  will  be  set  up  in  an\nindependent office.12  The unit will be headed jointly by a consultant appointed under the TA and\na  senior  appointee  nominated  by  DNPM.    Including  those  two,  it  will  have  a  core  staff  of  five\ndomestic  experts  and  one  international  expert.  This  expertise  will  be  supplemented  by\ninternationally  recruited  consultants  and  domestic  experts  seconded  from  educational  and\nresearch  institutes,  the  private  sector,  and  government  line  agencies  as  required.  TASMU  will\nbe  responsible  for  screening  initial  proposals  for  support  under  the  TA  and  for  recommending\nthem to the screening committee for approval, preparing TOR for subproject feasibility studies,\ncontracting  out  and  supervising  these  studies  once  they  have  been  approved,  and  preparing\npilot project  proposals for funding.\n\nIn  particular,  the  initial  project  identification  and  screening  process  will  include  the\n\n36.\nfollowing:\n\nTASMU;\n\n(i)  preliminary rapid appraisals by  TASMU of all initial subproject proposals submitted to\n\n(ii)  preparation by TASMU of either (a) consultants' TOR and related cost estimates for\ncarrying  out  full  technical,  financial,  social,  and  economic  assessments  of  those\nsubproject proposals whose prima facie viability has been established as a result of\nthe  preliminary  rapid  appraisals  and  that  are  deemed  by  TASMU  to  merit  a\nsubproject feasibility study; or (b) micro-investment plans and related cost estimates\nfor small-scale pilot projects that have been identified in the course of the preliminary\nrapid appraisals and that are recommended for immediate funding support; and\n\n(iii)  review  by  the  screening  committee  of  all  rapidly  appraised  subproject  proposals\nreferred  to  it  by  TASMU,  and  approval  by  the  screening  committee  of  (a)\napproximately 20 in-depth feasibility studies for funding, and (b) eight or more small-\nscale pilot project activities for funding.\n\nTASMU  will  be  supervised  by \n\n37.\ninclude\nrepresentatives from DNPM (the chair), ADB, DAL, the Rural Industries Council, the Investment\nPromotion  Authority  and  the  National  Agriculture  Research  Institute.  The  screening  committee\nwill  meet  at  least  once  every  two  months  to  review  proposals  screened  and  prepared  by\nTASMU.    Once  a  proposal  for  either  a  feasibility  study  or  a  pilot  project  is  approved  by  the\nscreening committee, it will be eligible for financing, under the supervision of TASMU.\n\nthe  screening  committee,  which  will \n\nThe  subproject  feasibility  study  proponents  and  the  pilot  activity  proponents  will\n38.\ncontribute to the implementation of the TA activities in various ways.  For the feasibility studies,\nthe  proponents  will  provide  access  to  any  previous  studies,    subproject  cost  estimates,    or\nbackground  research  that  they  may  have  undertaken  on  their  own.    They  will  also  provide\naccess to the proposed project site  for TASMU and the subproject feasibility study consultants;\norganize  stakeholder  meetings  with  the  local  population  for  visiting  consultant  teams;  provide\nlogistical  support  in  and  around  the  subproject  area;  and,  if  necessary  and  feasible,  provide\nlogistical support in and around Port Moresby for the feasibility study teams.\n\n12 To  be  provided  by  the  Rural  Industries  Council  or  the  Investment  Promotion  Authority  and  to  be  agreed  upon\n\n                  \n\nbefore loan effectiveness.\n\n\f10\n\n39.\nFor the pilot project activities, proponents' contributions of  33 percent of the costs  will\nconsist  of  minor  civil  works,    planting  materials,  labor,  and/or  technical  input  in  the  form  of\nspecialized expertise (for example in aquaculture, animal husbandry, or tree crop agronomy). It\nwill  also  include  any  taxes  and  duties  on  equipment  and  materials  purchased  with  TA  loan\nproceeds  when  taxes  and  duties  are  not  paid  by  the  Government.  In  addition,  as  with  the\nfeasibility  studies,  the  pilot  project  proponents  will  provide  logistical  support  to  TASMU  during\nrapid  rural  appraisals,    organize  stakeholder  meetings  as  required,  and  provide  logistical\nsupport in and around the pilot project  area.\n\n40. With  respect  to  smallholders,  and  NGOs'  participation  and  consultation,  TASMU,  all\nthroughout  project  implementation,  will  (i)  identify  specific  mechanisms  for  smallholder\nparticipation in planning and implementation of both feasibility studies and pilot projects in the\nsubproject areas, and (ii) promote NGO involvement in facilitating the formation of smallholders'\nassociations, social mobilization, and awareness-raising activities in the subproject area aimed\nat effective smallholder participation in both feasibility  studies and pilot project activities.\n\n41.\nSupervision of the activities of TASMU will be through monthly reports submitted to the\nscreening committee and quarterly reports submitted to the Secretary, DNPM and ADB. Overall\nimplementation  arrangements  will  be  reviewed  by  DNPM  and  ADB  one  year  after  loan\neffectiveness.  TOR  for  TASMU  are  provided  in  Appendix  5.  A  flow  chart  of  program\nresponsibilities and activities is shown in Appendix 6.\n\nC. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n42.\nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  24-month  period.  Start-up  activities  will  be\nrecruitment  and  training  of  staff  ,and  initial  identification  and    selection  of  project  proposals.\nSince  some  proposals  have  been  identified,  it  is  expected  that  subproject  feasibility  studies\ncould  begin  within  the  first  three  months,  after  TOR  have  been  prepared  and  consultants\nrecruited.  The main operations will take place over an 18-month period with a final 3 months at\nthe end of the implementation period to finish off ongoing studies and prepare a final report and\nreview.  An  implementation  schedule  is  shown  in  Appendix  7.  It  is  estimated  that  the\nimplementation period will start in April 2002 and end in April 2004.\n\nD. \n\nProcurement\n\nGoods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\n43.\nGuidelines for Procurement.    These  will,  in  the  main,  consist  of  (i)  office  equipment  and\nsupplies, vehicle leasing, and other support requirements  for TASMU and the subproject study\nconsultants  (a  list  of  such  requirements  is  in  Appendix  8);    and  (ii)  equipment,  materials,\nvehicles, and/or very minor civil works for the pilot project  component. Under the first category\n(consultant requirements), procurement of the various supply contracts will be done on a direct\npurchase basis. Under the second category (pilot projects), contract packages amounting up to\n$100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  through  direct  purchase,  while  contract  packages  above\n$100,000  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping.  In  addition,  with  respect  to  pilot\nprojects,    minor  civil  works  might  include  such  items  as  small  wharfs  and  pontoons  for\naquaculture, fencing and water supply for cattle development, and minor feeder road upgrading\nto  improve  access  to  smallholder  supplies.    These  activities  will  be  undertaken  by  the  NE\nproponents  themselves  and  will  be  of  such  a  small  nature  as  to  be  unlikely  to  interest\ninternational  or  even  domestic  contractors.    Any  procurement  for  equipment  and  materials\nexceeding $100,000 will be carried out by international shopping.\n\n\f11\n\nE. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n44.\nAll consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.    Two  types  of  consultants  will  be  required  for  the  TA:    (i)  domestic  and\ninternational  consultants  to  staff  TASMU  and  (ii)  consultants  recruited  for  the  subproject\nfeasibility  studies.    A  total  of  90  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  required  to  staff\nTASMU.  This will include 18 person-months of international and 72 person-months of domestic\nconsultancy.    International  expertise  will  be  required  in  project  design  and  analysis,  while  the\ndomestic  expertise  required  will  include  agricultural  development,  infrastructure  engineering,\nsocial  analysis  and  impact  assessment,  and  environmental  analysis  and  impact  assessment.\n(TOR  for  individual  experts  are  provided  in  Section  B  of  Appendix  5).    This  expertise  will  be\nprovided  through  a  firm  recruited  on  the  basis  of  international  bidding.    As  the  TA  is  being\nprovided  as  a  loan,  selection  of  the  consulting  services  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the\nGovernment.   In view  of the complexity of the consulting package and the direct link to future\nlending from ADB, the Government has agreed that recruitment of consultants  for TASMU will\nbe  undertaken  in  close  cooperation  with  ADB.    In  this  regard,  ADB  will  assist  with  the\nshortlisting, ranking, and selection of the firm as well as with contract negotiations.\n\n45.\nA total of 200 person-months (100 international and 100 domestic) with a wide range of\nexpertise  will  be  required  to  undertake  the  subproject  studies,  however,  prior  to  the  studies\nbeing identified it is not realistically possible to determine the exact expertise required.  This will\nmost likely include agricultural development, agroprocessing, livestock production, aquaculture,\nmarketing,  social \ninstitutional\narrangements,  and  financial  analysis.    However  other  disciplines  may  also  be  required.\nMoreover, most of the studies will be rather small in nature, and any individual study is unlikely\nto exceed $500,000 in cost.\n\nimpact  assessment,  environmental \n\nimpact  assessment, \n\nIn view of this situation and in order to reduce the time needed to recruit consultants for\n46.\nsubproject  studies,  TASMU  will  prepare  a  long  list  of  international  consulting  firms  with  the\nexpertise  required  for  participation  in  the  TA  Loan  (feasibility  studies).    Once  TOR  and  cost\nestimates for the studies have been prepared, a short list of three firms will be asked to submit a\nshort proposal and curricula vitae for the various experts being sought.  These submissions will\nthen be ranked by TASMU, and the first-ranked firm selected for contract negotiations.  If these\nshould prove unsuccessful, negotiations will proceed with the second-ranked firm.\n\nF. \n\nDisbursement\n\n47.\nFees for consulting services will be paid by direct payment on the basis of certification by\nTASMU of services rendered.  To ensure timely release of the funds required for pilot activities\nand  incidental  expenditures  such  as  office  equipment  and  vehicle  hire,  the  Government  will,\nimmediately  after  the  loan  becomes  effective,  establish  an  imprest  account  in  a  reputable\ncommercial  bank.  The  initial  amount  for  deposit  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed\n$500,000  equivalent.    Further  payments  will  be  made  from  and  to  this  account  for  all  eligible\nexpenditures  under  the  TA.  Replenishment  will  be  on  the  basis  of  documented  liquidation  of\nexpenditures from the account. This will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook.    ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidating  advance\npayments from the imprest account not exceeding $50,000 equivalent.\n\n\fG. \n\nReporting Requirements\n\n12\n\n48.\nTASMU  will  be  responsible  for  providing  monthly  summary  reports  on  its  operations  to\nall the members of the screening committee.  It will also be responsible for submitting quarterly\nreports  on  TA  operations  to  the  Secretary,  DNPM  and  ADB.    All  subproject  feasibility  study\nreports and reports documenting the results of pilot project  activities will be submitted to ADB,\nDNPM, and any other concerned agency as soon as they have been completed.\n\nPrior  to  the  completion  of  the  first  year  of  TA  activities,  a  consolidated  report  on  its\n49.\nresults  will  be  submitted  as  the  basis  for  a  full  review  by  ADB  and  the  Government  of  the  TA\nactivities and implementation arrangements.  A final TA completion report covering all aspects\nof the TA and summarizing its experiences, successes, and failures will be submitted to ADB by\nDNPM within three months of the completion of all field work.\n\nH. \n\nSocial and Environmental Aspects\n\nThe subprojects to be examined during implementation of the TA Loan will entail a wide\n50.\nrange of activities in all parts of the country.  They will doubtless be associated with a number of\nsocial and environmental issues and concerns, both negative and positive.  By including a social\nand  gender  dimension  specialist  and  an  environmental  specialist  as  key  members  of  the\nTASMU team, an effort has been made to ensure that (i) social and environmental concerns will\nbe  fully  taken  into  account  from  the  time  of  the  formulation  of  detailed  selection  criteria  to  the\ncompletion of the feasibility studies,  (ii) opportunities will exist to maximize potential social and\nenvironmental benefits and minimize social and environmental conflicts and costs, and (iii) the\ninvestment proposals will be tested on the basis of social and environmental parameters as well\nas  technical  and  financial  parameters.  Moreover,  the  TA  Loan  provides  the  opportunity  to\nrecommend social and environmental mitigation measures for investments that might otherwise\nhave  proceeded  on  their  own  without  adequate  social  or  environmental  safeguards.    In  this\nregard, an initial environmental examination or environmental impact assessment and a social\nimpact  assessment  will  be  required  for  each  subproject.  Model  TOR  for  environmental  and\nsocial impact studies for individual subprojects have been included in Supplementary Appendix\nG.\n\nVI. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nBenefits\n\n51.\nThe TA Loan will provide the Government and the private sector with the opportunity to\ntest a new modality in development financing that is meant to bring out the combined benefits of\nthe  large  private  sector  (NE),  the  small  private  sector  (smallholders  and  outgrowers)  and  the\npublic sector (through infrastructure provision) working together to stimulate economic growth in\nthe previously neglected rural areas of the country.  The TA Loan will allow the preparation of\ninvestment  packages  that  would  not  otherwise  have  been  possible  and  the  testing  of  such\npackages  through  full  feasibility  analysis.    Bringing  outside  advice  and  scrutiny  will  allow  the\nfurtherance  of  new  practices  and  concepts  that  may  not  have  been  considered  by  the  status\nquo  entities  in  either  the  public  or  the  private  sector  and  also  will  ensure  a  range  of\nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  that  may  not  have  been  taken  into  account  without  an\nexogenous point of view or advice.\n\n\fB. \n\nRisks\n\n13\n\n52.\nThe main risks are the following: (i) there may not be sufficient interest on the part of the\nprivate  sector  (NEs)  and  the  smallholders;  (ii)  the  quality  of  work  (feasibility  studies  and  pilot\nproject  activities)  may  be  less  than  satisfactory;  and  (iii)  the  expected  follow-up  financing  may\nnot be forthcoming. The issue of long-term sustainability of TASMU has also been raised.\n\n53.\nThe  purpose  of  the  TA  Loan  is  to  ensure  project  quality  at  entry.  Sustainability  of  the\nquality assurance mechanisms like TASMU and the screening committee beyond the TA Loan\nimplementation  period  is  not  essential.  The  process  to  be  adopted  should  lead  to  the\nidentification  and  selection  of  the  most  appropriate  mechanism  for  coordination  among  major\nstakeholders,  promotion  of \nthe  concept/project  opportunities,  and  up-front  screening\nmechanisms.\n\n54.\nThe private sector has already expressed interest in the concept. Detailed preparation is\nthe  best  way  to  screen  and  develop  project  proposals  with  their  ownership.  Agro-industry  has\npotential in PNG. By organizing NE-smallholder partnerships, local law and order issues can be\npositively addressed. The TA Loan can only increase the interest of potential financiers. Regular\nreview  and  close  monitoring  of  its  implementation  will  be  undertaken  to  deal  with  potential\ndifficulties to minimize the risks.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\n\n55.\nassurances,  which have been incorporated into the Loan Agreement:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  technical  personnel  in  its  employ  such  as  the\nstaffs of research institutes and universities will make their services available to\nTASMU as required.\n\nThe Government, through DNPM and TASMU, will  ensure that (a) environmental\nconcerns are fully taken into account from the time of the formulation of selection\ncriteria  to  the  completion  of  the  subproject  feasibility  studies;  (b)  opportunities\nexist  to  maximize  potential  environmental  benefits  and  minimize  environmental\nconflicts and costs; and (c) any investment proposal resulting from a subproject\nfeasibility  study  is  tested  on  the  basis  of  environmental  parameters  as  well  as\ntechnical and financial parameters.\n\nAll  environmental  mitigation  measures  identified  as  the  result  of  a  subproject\nfeasibility  study  or  pilot  project  investment  plan  will  be  incorporated  into  the\nproject  design  and \nfollowed  during  project  construction,  operation,  and\nmaintenance  in  consultation  with  the  Government's  Office  of  Environment  and\nConservation and in accordance with ADB's environmental guidelines.\n\n(iv) \n\nAny  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues  that  arise  will  be  dealt  with  in\naccordance with ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and ADB's Handbook\non Resettlement.\n\n\fB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n14\n\n56.\n\nThe following conditions will need to be met before the loan can be declared effective:\n\n(i)  The Government must have appointed a PNG national with both public and private\n\nsector experience to act as joint head of TASMU.\n\n(ii) The  Government  must  have  entered  into  an  agreement  with  a  private  sector  or\nquasi-private sector entity acceptable to ADB under which that entity agrees to act as\nhost to TASMU.\n\nVIII.

Should  such  a  NE  not  exist  at\nthe  time  of  recommending  the  particular  subproject  proposal  to  the  screening\ncommittee,  TASMU  must  have  identified  the  party  or  parties  proposing  to  form\nthe NE, such party or parties to have all the financial, technical, and managerial\ncapacities that TASMU deems necessary to establish and operate the NE.\n\nThe estimated total  amount of the planned investment that is the subject of the\nSFS,  including  investments  relating  thereto  (NE,  smallholder  and  public  sector\ninfrastructure), must be at least  $1 million equivalent.\n\na \n\ncommercial \n\nThe  proposal  to  conduct  a  SFS  should  refer  to  a  NE  system  wherein  a  NE  will\nprovide marketing outlets and other technical and financial support to smallholder\nagricultural  production.    This  may  include  different  typologies:  (i)  a  NE  system\ncomprising \nrelated\nsmallholders/outgrowers, (ii) a NE system comprising a NE owned and operated\nby an NGO or other similar nonprofit charitable organization, or (iii) a NE system\ncomprising  a  NE  owned  and  operated  by  a  group  of  smallholders.    Investment\nproposals  relating  to  stand-alone  NEs  (e.g.,  a  processing  plant  or  a  plantation\nwithout  outgrowers)    may  also  be  considered  when  there  are  strong  and\nidentifiable  potential  benefits  in  terms  of  employment  and  poverty  reduction  for\nthe surrounding population.\n\nplantation) \n\nestate \n\n(e.g., \n\nand \n\n(iv)\n\nTASMU must have reasonable cause to believe that as a result of the preliminary\nrapid  appraisal  undertaken  by  TASMU  under  Part  A  of  the  TA  the  investment\nproposal  is  prima facie  economically  and  financially  viable  and  that  any  NE,\nassociated smallholder enterprise, and/or supporting infrastructure financed as a\nresult of the SFS can be operated and maintained in a sustainable manner.\n\n\f22\n\nAppendix 3, page 2\n\nWhenever  requesting  approval  of  the  screening  committee  to  have  a  SFS  carried  out,\n\n3.\nTASMU shall ensure that the SFS provides for the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)\n\n(i) \n\n(iii) \n\na  business  plan,  comprising  a \nincluding  operation  and\nmaintenance  estimates,  potential/expected  sources  of  capital  and  recurrent\nfunds,  and  all  other  cost  and  revenue  estimates  required  for  a  commercially\nviable private sector investment;\n\nfinancing  plan \n\na  study  or  studies  on  identifiable  social  and  economic  benefits  for  the\nsmallholders/outgrowers and the surrounding population;\n\na  study  or  studies  on  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  subproject  if\nthese  have  not  already  been  previously  and  satisfactorily  addressed  in\naccordance with the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) environmental guidelines;\nand\n\nstudy  or  studies  on  land  use,  land  tenure  and  possible  resettlement  issues  if\nthese  have  not  already  been  satisfactorily  addressed  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nenvironmental guidelines.\n\nWhenever  the  screening  committee  gives  its  approval  for  a  SFS  to  be  carried  out,\n4.\nTASMU, before engaging consultants to commence work it, must enter into a memorandum of\nunderstanding (MOU) with the proponent/s.

Proposals  presented  to  the  committee  will\nconsist of (i) subproject feasibility study (SFS) proposals,  and (ii)  pilot project (PP) proposals.\nPrior  to  presentation  of  proposals  to  the  committee,  the  Technical  Assistance  Screening  and\nManagement  Unit  (TASMU)  will  be  responsible  for  the  initial  screening  of  all  proposals,  for\npackaging  SFS  and  PP  proposals    into  \"bankable\"  subprojects  and  preparing  Terms  of\nReference  (TOR)  for  the  feasibility  studies,  for  assessing  and  costing  PP  proposals,  and  for\nmaking  recommendations  on  approval  to  the  committee.    Once  funds  are  approved  by  the\ncommittee, TASMU will be responsible for (i) consultant recruitment, (ii) supervision of the SFS,\nand (iii) monitoring implementation of PP activities.\n\n2.\nTASMU will be staffed by a full-time team of six. Five of these will be consultants (one\ninternational  and  four  domestic)  with  the  following  expertise:  project  design  and  analysis,\nagriculture, engineering, social impact assessment and environmental impact assessment. The\nsixth  member  of  TASMU  will  be  a  senior  appointee  nominated  by  the  Department  of  National\nPlanning and Monitoring, who will function jointly as team leader for the unit in conjunction with\nthe  project  analyst/team  leader.  TASMU  will  also  have  the  ability  and  funding  to  call  upon\nspecialist international and domestic expertise to assist with specific subjects.\n\n3.\nEach SFS  or PP proposal submitted to TASMU will be examined by the team during a\nshort  field  visit,  during  which  a  preliminary  rapid  appraisal  and  a  preliminary  social  and\nenvironmental impact assessment will be carried out.  This will include an initial assessment of\nthe financial viability of the proposed project, the technology being proposed, quantifiable costs\nand  benefits,  marketing  prospects,  supporting  infrastructure  requirements,  social  benefits,  and\npotential  environmental  concerns.    Institutional  arrangements  and  requirements  will  also  be\nexamined,  as  will  the  degree  of  involvement  or  sponsorship  of  the  provincial  and/or  national\ngovernment.  TASMU team will also examine how to maximize the positive social impact of the\nproposal  and  will  provide  advice  or  assistance  as  to  how  to  formulate  or  reformulate  the\nproposal so that it meets a predetermined set of selection criteria: (i) prima facie economic and\nfinancial  viability,  (ii)  positive  social  impact  and  poverty  reduction  potential,  (iii)  no  significant\npotential environmental impacts, (iv) sustainability, (v) replicability (Appendix 3)1.\n\n4.\nFor  SFS  proposals  that  meet  the  selection  criteria  and  appear  to  be  promising\ndevelopment initiatives, TOR and cost estimates  will be prepared and shortlists of consultants\nwill be requested from long-listed  consulting firms.  For PP proposals  that meet the selection\ncriteria, memoranda of agreement between TASMU and the NE on PP implementation, costs,\nand  workplan  will  be  prepared  (see  Appendix  3).  Should  a  proposal  not  meet  the  selection\ncriteria and thus not be recommended for further financing, a full explanation will be provided for\nthe screening committee.\n\n1 Detailed selection criteria will be prepared by TASMU at the inception of the TA and approved by the screening\n\n                  \n\ncommittee.\n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 5, page 2\n\nFull documentation on nonqualifying proposals, qualifying SFS proposals,  and qualifying\n\n5.\nPP proposals will be presented to the screening committee once every two months.\n\n6.\nOnce  appraised  proposals  have  been  approved  by  the  screening  committee,  TASMU\nwill  select  consultants,  supervise  the  implementation  of  the  feasibility  studies  or  the  pilot\ninvestments, and report periodically on the success of implementation to ADB, the Government,\nand the screening committee.\n\nB. \n\nSpecific\n\n1. \n\n Project Analyst/Team Leader  (international, 18 person-months)\n\nThe project analyst/team leader will be a senior development specialist with at least 15\n7.\nyears  of  experience  in  the  development,  preparation,  and  analysis  of  projects  for  multilateral\nfinancing.
