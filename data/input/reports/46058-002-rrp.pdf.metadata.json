It is the first-of-its-kind CSP demonstration plant \nin  the  PRC.  Upon  completion,  the  project  will  generate  197  gigawatt-hours  of  clean  electricity \nannually, thereby avoiding 154,446 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  power  sector  in  the  PRC  has  grown  rapidly  in  tandem  with  economic  growth. \nInstalled power capacity has expanded by about 70% in the past 5 years (2008\u20132012) alone.3 \nSince the power sector relies heavily on coal-fired power generation, which supplied more than \n75%  of  the  electricity  in  the  PRC  in  2012,  the  rapid  expansion  in  capacity  has  also  caused  a \nlarge  increase  in  CO2  emission\u2014the  key  greenhouse  gas  responsible  for  climate  change. 4 \nPromoting  a  more  diversified  energy  mix  with  a  higher  share  of  renewable  energy  is  a  core \npriority to decarbonize the country\u2019s power sector. In 2005, the PRC\u2019s Renewable Energy Law \nwas enacted to stimulate large-scale renewable energy development. It was accompanied by a \nset of incentives and policy measures to promote non-hydro renewable technologies. In 2007, \nthe  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  issued  the  Medium  and  Long-Term \nDevelopment Plan for Renewable Energy in the PRC to increase the share of renewable energy \nin the total primary energy consumption to 15% by 2020. In 2009, the PRC also announced its \ntarget to reduce its carbon intensity (the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross \ndomestic  product)  by  40%\u201345%  by  2020  compared  with  2005  levels.  The  Twelfth  Five-Year \nPlan,  2011\u20132015  set  an  intermediate  target  to  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energy  to \n11.4%5 and to reduce carbon intensity by 17%6 by 2015 compared with 2010 levels.  \n \nDuring the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period (2006\u20132010), the PRC achieved rapid growth \n4. \nin wind power and solar photovoltaic capacity. During this period, the installed capacity of wind \npower  increased  from  1.3  gigawatts  (GW)  to  41.8  GW,  and  solar  photovoltaic  capacity \nincreased from 70 MW to 900 MW. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan set a target of 21 GW of solar \nphotovoltaic capacity; by 2012, the total solar photovoltaic capacity surged to 3.2 GW. The rapid \ngrowth of wind power and solar photovoltaic capacity poses new challenges for grid integration \nof  the  intermittent  power  supplied  by  these  plants.  Since  the  electricity  output  of  these  plants \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2012.  Technical \nAssistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the Qinghai Delingha Concentrated Solar Thermal Plant \nProject. Manila. \n\n3  National  Energy  Administration.  2013.  Report  on  China\u2019s  Energy  Development  for  2013.  Beijing:  Economic \n\nScience Press.  \n\n4  According  to  International  Energy  Agency  (2012),  CO2  emission  from  the  power  sector  in  the  PRC  accounts  for \n\naround 50% of total CO2 emission in the PRC.  \n\n5  Share of renewable energy in the total primary consumption has steadily expanded from 6.95% (or 197 million tons \n\nof standard coal equivalent) in 2007 to 10.3% (or 378 million tons of standard coal equivalent) in 2012.  \n\n6  Carbon  intensity  (kilogram  of  CO2/CNY)  decreased  from  0.28  in  2005  to  0.24  in  2010,  which  is  about  a  14.2% \n\nreduction as compared with 2005 levels.  \n\n\f2 \n\ncannot  be  predicted  accurately,  the  grid  company  finds  it  extremely  difficult  to  schedule  their \noutput dispatch economically, and this is causing grid curtailment.7 \n \n5. \nCSP  is  a  state-of-the-art  renewable  energy  technology  that  converts  direct  normal \nirradiation (DNI) into usable heat, generating medium- to high-temperature saturated steam that \nruns the steam turbine for power generation. Because of this thermal cycle, CSP plants can be \ncombined easily with low-cost thermal energy storage, allowing it to generate electricity even at \nnight. Thus, CSP plants produce reliable, predictable, and dispatchable electricity at any time of \nthe day to allow the grid company to schedule their dispatch economically. This unique feature \nenables  it  to  overcome  grid  integration  issues  posed  by  unpredictable  wind  and  solar \nphotovoltaic  plants.  In  2012,  more  than  2.4  GW  capacity  of  utility-scale  CSP  plants  were  in \noperation and additional 2.36 GW capacity plants are under construction, mainly in Spain and \nthe United States.8  \n \n6. \nThe CSP plants typically require  DNI of at least 1,800 kilowatt-hours per square meter \n(kWh/m2) per year. Based on this requirement, more than 700,000 square kilometers is suitable \nfor CSP installation in the PRC, which can potentially generate more than 51,000 terawatt-hours \nof  electricity  per  year  compared  to  its  total  electricity  generation  of  4,980  terawatt-hours  in \n2012.9 But CSP development has been rather slow in the PRC because of many factors, such \nas  the  (i) limited  in-country  manufacturing  capacity,  (ii)  higher  capital  cost  of  CSP  plants, \n(iii) negligible  hands-on  experience  with  the  technology,  (iv)  location  of  suitable  sites  far  from \npopulation  centers,  and  (v)  extreme  cold  weather.  Thus,  CSP  development  has  been \nlanguishing  in  the  PRC,  undermining  the  substantial  potential  benefits  this  technology  can \nprovide to decarbonize the PRC\u2019s power mix. The lack of a CSP-specific development policy, in \nparticular  the  absence  of  a  feed-in  tariff  for  CSP  technologies,  has  inhibited  or  slowed \ninvestment thereby causing further delays in CSP demonstration and deployment.10 \n \n7. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  promoting  CSP  in  the  PRC  since  2009 \nthrough  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA).11 The  successful  implementation  of \nthe TA lowered the barriers for demonstrating CSP in the PRC. In 2011, the Government of the \nPRC decided to construct four utility-scale CSP demonstration projects. The proposed project is \none  of  these  four.12 These  demonstration  projects  will  provide  valuable  hands-on  experience \nand  mitigate  some  of  the  perceived  and  real  technology  risks  associated  with  first-of-its-kind \n\n                                                 \n7  Grid  curtailment  refers  to  the  non-absorption  of  electricity  generated  from  power  plants  by  the  power  grid.  Solar \nphotovoltaic and  wind power generation above a threshold such as 20% requires increased grid flexibility to fully \nutilize the variable and uncertain output from these plants. In addition, the PRC\u2019s interregional grid interconnection \nis relatively underdeveloped, which constrains wind power utilization in concentrated areas such as Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region, causing the curtailment of wind power as high as 45% compared to less than 10% in Europe. \n8  Utility-scale  refers  to  grid-connected  CSP  plants  with  an  installed  capacity  of  10  MW  or  higher.  Spain  and  the \n\nUnited States offer some of the best sites for CSP installation.  \n\n9  ADB. 2011. Concentrating Solar Thermal Power Development. Consultant\u2019s final report. Manila (TA 7402-PRC). \n10 A solar feed-in tariff of CNY1.0 per kilowatt-hour was introduced in 2011, which targeted solar photovoltaic plants. \nThis  feed-in  tariff  does  not  reflect  the  unique  benefits  of  CSP  (para.  5)  and  does  not  provide  incentives  to \naccelerate investment in CSP. The government is contemplating issuing a feed-in tariff for CSP within 2014.  \n\n11 ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Concentrating  Solar  Thermal  Power \nDevelopment. Manila (TA 7402-PRC). The TA has (i) developed a road map for CSP plant development in Gansu \nand  Qinghai  provinces,  (ii)  prepared  a  pre-feasibility  study  for  a  CSP  project  in  Gansu  province,  and \n(iii) implemented a 1 MW CSP pilot project in Beijing. \n\n12 The other three projects are (i) a 50 MW parabolic trough CSP in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, (ii) a 50 \nMW  parabolic  trough  CSP  in  Gansu  Province,  and  (iii)  a  92.5  MW  integrated  solar  combined  cycle  (parabolic \ntrough  CSP  coupled  with  natural  gas  combined  cycle)  in  the  Ningxia  Hui  Autonomous  Region.  The  Gansu  CSP \nproject is included in the ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2013\u20132015. \nManila. \n\n\fprojects.  These  projects  are  expected  to  contribute  to  the  knowledge  and  insight  of  the \ngovernment to formulate appropriate policy incentives for the large-scale deployment of CSP in \nthe  PRC.  ADB  financing  for  the  project  will  provide  the  much-needed  package  assistance  of \nlow-cost financing, policy advice, and capacity development, which will ensure the sustainability \nof  the  project  in  the  short  term  and  lead  to  the  wider  uptake  of  CSP  plants  in  the  PRC  in  the \nmedium term.13 \n \n8. \nQinghai, which is located in the northeastern part of the Qinghai\u2013Xizang Plateau in the \nwestern part of the PRC, is particularly suited for CSP plants because of its rich solar resources \nof  2,100  kWh/m2  of  annual  DNI.  It  is  ranked  first  in  solar  power  capacity  concentration \nthroughout the PRC. Qinghai has more than 2 GW of solar photovoltaic installed capacity, which \nis  more  than  60%  of  the  national  capacity.  The  province  targets  installed  capacity  of  4  GW \n(including 300 MW of CSP) by 2015 and 10 GW (including 2 GW of CSP) by 2020, which are \nabout 20% of the national targets.  \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2013\u20132015  and  is \nconsistent  with  (i)  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  2009;  (ii)  the  Medium  and  Long-Term  Development \nPlan for Renewable Energy of the PRC, 2007; and (iii) the Twelfth Five-Year Plan of the PRC.14 \nThe project will contribute to ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative target of adding 3,000 MW solar \npower capacity by 2013. By demonstrating a potent renewable energy technology in one of the \nmain  CSP  relevant  provinces,  the  project  will  lower  the  barriers  to  the  acceptance  of  the \ntechnology  and  lead  to  its  deployment,  thus  contributing  directly  to  low-carbon  energy \ndevelopment\u2014a  core  priority  in  the  country  partnership  strategy.  The  package  assistance \ncombined with direct value-added cofinancing is reflective of ADB\u2019s innovative support for this \ndemonstration project (paras. 7 and 14). \n   \nB. \n \nThe impact will be the expanded share of CSP in the renewable energy mix in the PRC. \n10. \nThe outcome will be the demonstrated feasibility and reliability of the utility-scale CSP plant with \na thermal storage system in Qinghai Province.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe  project  site  is  one  of  the  typical  locations  within  Qinghai  Province  that  has  2,187 \nkWh/m2 of annual DNI. The project will utilize parabolic trough CSP,15 which is one of the four \nmajor  CSP  technologies  with  a  7-hour  thermal  storage  system. 16 The  project  will  have  two \noutputs: (i) the construction of a first-of-its-kind utility-scale CSP plant in Qinghai Province; and \n(ii)  capacity  development  and  training  in  CSP  design,  construction,  and  operation  and \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n13 A  policy  recommendation  on  feed-in  tariff  and  regulatory  assistance  to  further  support  CSP  demonstration  and \n\ndeployment will be submitted to the government in December 2013.   \n\n14 ADB.  2013.

Manila. \n\n15 Parabolic trough CSP is the most mature and commercially proven technology used in 95% of all utility-scale CSP \nplants in the world. The parabolic trough CSP is composed of (i) a solar field system, which concentrates DNI to \ngenerate around 400\u00b0C of thermal energy; (ii) a heat transfer system; (iii) a thermal energy storage system, which \nstores  excess  heat  from  the  solar  field  system  to  supply  heat  for  power  production  during  nights  or  cloudy  days; \nand  (iv)  a  power  block,  which  generates  electricity  using  saturated  steam  produced  by  thermal  energy  from  the \nsolar field and thermal storage system to drive a steam turbine generator.  \n\n16 Thermal  storage  for  parabolic  trough  CSP  plants  in  operation  or  under  construction  that  have  a  similar  system \n\nconfiguration has a maximum of 7.5 hours of thermal storage system. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nmanagement. 17  Upon  completion,  the  project  will  generate  197  gigawatt-hours  of  clean \nelectricity  fed  into  the  existing  110  kilovolt  substation  in  Delingha  city,  which  results  in  annual \nreduction of 154,446 tons of CO2.  \n \nD. \n \n12. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $322.26 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n \nBase Costa \n1.

In  2012,  it  received  investment-grade  credit  ratings \nfrom Moody\u2019s Investors Service (Aa3), Standard & Poor\u2019s (AA\u2013), and Fitch (A+). \n\n19 CGN is a state-owned enterprise established in 1994 under the supervision of the State-Owned Assets Supervision \nand Administration of the State Council in the PRC. Since its establishment, CGN has been developed into a large \ngroup consisting of wholly owned or controlled 32 affiliated companies in the PRC. \n\n20 CGN-DSE was established and legally incorporated in April 2012 and is fully owned by CGN-SEDC.  \n21 CGN-SEDC, fully owned by CGN, was established in 2009. Its core business is solar PHOTOVOLTAIC and CSP \ndevelopment. CGN-SEDC\u2019s current total installed capacity is 287 MW, which it targets to expand to 2 GW by 2015 \nand 5 GW by 2020. Its extensive previous experience in renewable energy will benefit CGN-DSE.  \n\n22 This onlending arrangement is essential in the PRC\u2019s internal system. China Exim Bank involvement helps meet \nthe stringent requirements of the Ministry of Finance for onlending an ADB sovereign-guaranteed loan to a large \nstate-owned enterprise such as CGN. A similar arrangement was successfully implemented in the PRC\u2019s first such \nproject\u2014ADB. 2009.

A  comprehensive  solar  resource  assessment  was  done \nbased on internationally recognized methodologies and practices for the project site in Delingha. \nThe  assessment  used  satellite-derived  solar  irradiation  and  meteorological  data  acquired \nbetween 2000 and 2012, and ground monitoring data acquired between 2011 and 2012.24 The \nassessment comprised (i) the ground data quality assessment to filter outlier data derived from \nmeasurement error, (ii) the statistical comparison and correction of the satellite database using \nfiltered  ground  measurement  data,  and  (iii)  the  measurement  of  DNI  which  represents  solar \nresource at the project site to simulate electricity yield. The estimated monthly and yearly DNI \nwere  also  assessed  considering  statistical  uncertainty  within  5%.  This  provided  an  estimated \nDNI of 2,187 kWh/m2 per year, which confirmed the robustness of the estimated DNI included in \nthe project feasibility.  \n \n19. \n System configuration design, costs, and electricity yield. Different parabolic trough \nCSP  system  configurations  were  assessed  to  select  the  optimal  design,  which  can  also  meet \nfinancial  viability  and  plant  performance  criteria.  The  key  features  of  the  proposed  system  are \n(i) a 7-hour thermal energy storage system with 995 megawatt-hour thermal capacity,25 and (ii) \n621,300  square  meters  of  solar  field  area  to  generate  sufficient  thermal  energy  to  charge \nthermal energy storage while generating electricity at full capacity. The project is also designed \nwith an anti-freezing feature for the extremely cold temperatures experienced during the winter \n(para. 20) and a dry cooling system to minimize water consumption. The estimated costs were \nassessed to be adequate according to costs at a similar CSP plant in Europe.  \n\n                                                 \n24 Ground monitoring data at the project site covered data for 18 months from June 2011 to November 2012. \n25 The project with a 7-hour thermal energy storage system will (i) attain 44.9% of capacity factor and 3,940 annual \noperating hours, (ii) increase the net electricity yield by 45.9%, and (iii) require the solar collector loop to increase \nby 35.7%.  \n\n\f \n20. \nFreezing protection. Synthetic oil will be used as the heat transfer fluid (HTF); it will be \nheated  to  around  400\u00b0C  by  direct  solar  irradiation  and  will  generate  saturated  steam  for \nelectricity  generation.  The  project  site  is  located  in  a  cold  climate  where  mid-winter  minimum \ntemperatures could fall overnight to \u201327\u00b0C, compared to the planned safe temperature of 50\u00b0C \nfor the HTF. Cold spots due to HTF freezing can cause serious damage to the piping system. \nTo  avoid  this,  the  plant  will  be  equipped  with  (i)  a  freezing  protection  circulation  pump,  which \nforces  HTF  circulation  in  pipes  all  the  time;  (ii)  mineral  wool  insulated  pipes,  valves,  and \ninstruments in the HTF system; and (iii) a natural gas auxiliary heater to prevent the HTF from \nfalling below 50\u00b0C.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe financial internal rate of return is calculated for the project at a tariff of CNY1.15 per \nkilowatt-hour.26 This results in a 4.82% financial internal rate of return, which is higher than the \n1.97% of the weighted average cost of capital. The sensitivity analysis shows that the financial \ninternal  rate  of  return  would  decrease  to  (i)  4.05%  if  the  project  experiences  a  capital  cost \noverrun of 10%, (ii) 4.57% with a 10% operating cost overrun, (iii) 3.54% if the project benefit is \nreduced by 10%, and (iv) 3.38% if the project experiences a commissioning delay of 1 year. The \nproject is considered both financially viable and sustainable. \n\n \n22. \nThe  economic  benefits  include  avoided  coal  usage  for  power  generation,  incremental \nelectricity sales, the improvement of grid reliability, and the associated emission reduction. The \ncalculations include all project-related costs and economic benefits. The economic internal rate \nof return for the project is 13.3%, which is more than 12.0% of the economic cost of capital. The \nsensitivity analysis shows that the economic internal rate of return could fall to (i) 12.7% if all the \neconomic benefits were reduced by 10%, (ii) 12.0% if the project experienced a cost overrun of \n10%, and (iii) 13.2% if the operation and maintenance costs rose by 10%. Thus, the project is \nconsidered economically viable.   \n\n \nGovernance \n\nC. \n \nA  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  for  CGN  and  CGN-DSE.  The \n23. \nfinancial management and accounting procedures used by CGN and CGN-DSE are aligned with \nthe regulations and policies issued by the Ministry of Finance, and are considered effective and \nadequate for the project. CGN has developed and maintained the group company-wide financial \nmanagement  monitoring  and  supervising  structure  in  budgeting,  asset  management,  funding \nmanagement, internal and external auditing, and reporting, with internal financial management \nrules  and  a  centrally  managed  online  financial  management  system.  CGN-DSE  also  follows \nthese  internal  financial  management  rules  and  has  incorporated  them  into  the  online  financial \nmanagement  system.  The  assessment  indicates  that  accrual-based  accounting  and  the  PRC \nbusiness  accounting  standards  are  followed;  the  separation  of  functions  for  authorization, \ntransaction,  recording,  and  asset  management  are  well  established;  and  a  robust  financial \nmanagement and internal auditing system are in place.  \n \n24. \nProcurement  capacity  assessment  was  also  conducted.  CGN  and  CGN-DSE  have \nexperienced  and  trained  personnel  in  procurement  and  contract  management  supported  by \n\n                                                 \n26 A tariff of CNY1.15 per kilowatt-hour is assumed in the project feasibility study report approved in February 2013. \nBased on ADB\u2019s previous experience in many similar projects, the approved tariff in the feasibility report is the best \nestimate for such purpose.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nwell-established  internal  procedures  and  management  systems,  which  is  consistent  with  ADB \nrequirements.  The  accountability  mechanism  is  also  deemed  effective  with  the  following \nactivities  performed  by  different  groups:  procurement  and  contract  awards,  disbursement,  and \ninternal  audit.  Both  CGN  and  CGN-DSE  lack  experience  in  procurement  with  international \nfinancing  institutions.  To  overcome  this  capacity  gap,  procurement  training  seminars  were \nprovided through the project preparatory TA (footnote 2), and a tendering agent with extensive \nexperience in ADB-financed infrastructure projects has been engaged to provide assistance to \nconduct procurement in line with ADB guidelines.  \n \n25. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  and  discussed \nwith the government, CGN, CGN-SEDC, China Exim Bank, and CGN-DSE. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual \n(footnote 23). \n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n\nThe  project  will  have  a  positive  social  impact  by  avoiding  air  pollution  associated  with \n26. \ncoal  use  for  power  generation.  While  direct  benefits  to  low-income  households  are  not \nanticipated,  the  project  has  a  positive  side-benefit  of  employment  opportunities  for  the  local \npopulation in Delingha by generating 4,010 person-months (334 jobs) per year of unskilled labor \nduring  construction  and  360  person-months  (30  jobs)  per  year  during  operation  and \nmaintenance. Priority will be given to the affected local population (para. 29) and adjacent local \ncommunity.  \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n27. \nEnvironment (category B).  The potential adverse environmental impacts of the project \ninclude (i) soil erosion, noise, fugitive dust, solid waste, and safety risks during construction; and \n(ii)  noise,  solid  waste  and  wastewater,  and  the  leakage  of  synthetic  oil  HTF  during  operation. \nThe initial environmental examination (IEE) concludes that the potential adverse environmental \nimpacts can be adequately mitigated by measures outlined in the IEE, and the project will result \nin  environmental  and  socioeconomic  benefits  that  significantly  outweigh  potential  negative \nimpacts.27 The project is also designed to reduce water consumption by 73.5% compared with a \nwet cooling system to minimize impact on available water. 28 \n \n28. \nCGN and CGN-DSE shall ensure the project is designed, constructed, and operated in \naccordance with the PRC\u2019s relevant national environmental laws, regulations, procedures, and \nguidelines;  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009);  and \nthe  project  environmental \nmanagement  plan  attached  to  the  IEE.  Environmental  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to \nADB  twice  a  year  during  construction  and  annually  during  operation.  The  environmental \nmanagement plan will be updated during the engineering design and incorporated in the bidding \ndocuments and civil works contracts.  \n \n29. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Land  acquisition \nunder  the  project  will  affect  people  of  the  Mongolian  ethnic  group,  and  a  land  acquisition  and \n\n                                                 \n27  Initial  environmental  examination  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  It  has  been \n\ndisclosed in May 2013.  \n\n28 0.38 million cubic meters per year of water consumption is estimated for the project with dry cooling, compared to \n\n1.45 million cubic meters per year with wet cooling. \n\n\fethnic  minority  development  plan  has  been  prepared.29 The  project  will  permanently  acquire \n246 hectares of jointly contracted grassland with a 50-year land usage right since 1985, which \nbelongs  to  153  people  from  31  Mongolian  ethnicity  households.30 The  land  to  be  acquired  is \nsemiarid unused land, which is 0.7% of the total grazing area owned by the affected households \nand  will  not  cause  loss  of  income  and  fixed  assets,  and  physical  displacement.  All  affected \nhouseholds are entitled to cash compensation for loss of land, and in-kind assistance such as \nemployment  opportunities  during  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  project,  portable  solar \nphotovoltaic  sets  and  high  insulation  yurts  (nomad  tents),  and  livelihood  skills  development \ntraining.  CGN  and  CGN-DSE  shall  ensure  that  (i)  the  land  acquisition  and  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment  plan  is  implemented,  and  the  compensation  and  in-kind  assistance  for  affected \npeople are carried out promptly and efficiently in accordance with the government\u2019s applicable \nlaws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; and (ii) the implementation of the land acquisition \nand ethnic minority development plan is monitored, evaluated, and reported to ADB.  \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n\nOverall,  the  associated  risks  have  been  adequately  mitigated  through  measures \n30. \nincluded  in  the  project  design  and  implementation  arrangements.  Major  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.31  \n \n\nRisks \nPoor performance of key \nequipment or contractors \ncausing plant to operate at less \nthan design performance. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures\nCGN-DSE will employ international experts as owner\u2019s engineers for engineering \ndesign and construction supervision.  \n\nAs all major equipment and materials for the project will be funded by ADB, \ntechnical specifications for each package will be rigorously reviewed in coordination \nwith the owner\u2019s engineer.  \n\nPerformance-based O&M contract will be introduced to ensure the designed project \nperformance within the estimated O&M costs. \n\nLess electricity generation than \nplanned due to the uncertainty \nof direct solar irradiation.  \n\nThe estimated direct normal irradiation at the project site is within 5% of the \nstatistical uncertainty level.
