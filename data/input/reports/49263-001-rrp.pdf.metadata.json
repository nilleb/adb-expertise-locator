The  260-megawatt  (MW)  wind  power  project  aligns  with \nThailand\u2019s energy development plan for 2015\u20132036 and its goal to generate 30% of its primary \nenergy  needs  from  renewable  sources  by  2036.3 This  would  avoid  140  million  tons  of  carbon \nemissions  annually.4 Despite  strong  government  commitment  to  and  incentives  for  renewable \nenergy development since 2010, only 225 MW of wind power capacity had been installed in the \ncountry as of July 2015. Major private sector investments are needed if the current plan\u2019s target \nto increase this installed capacity to 3,002 MW by 2036 is to be met. The project is part of the \nlong-term  growth  strategy  of  the  sponsor,  Energy  Absolute,  which  aims  to  expand  its \ninvestments in renewable energy generation and become one of the leading alternative energy \ncompanies in Southeast Asia. \n \nThe  project  is  eligible  for  cofinancing  from  the  CTF.5 The  CTF  provides  concessional \n3. \nfinancing to support the rapid deployment of  low-carbon technologies that have good potential \nto  reduce  and  avoid  greenhouse  gas  emissions  over  the  long  term.  It  is  administered  by \nmultilateral development banks, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and is one of the \nlargest  of  the  funds  now  helping  developing  countries  finance  projects  to  mitigate  climate \nchange. In May 2012, the CTF approved the allocation of $100 million for a renewable energy \nprogram in Thailand.6 These funds were to be administered and put to use by ADB within about \n3  years.7 The  project  will  be  the  fifth  private  sector  project  in  Thailand  under  the  program  and \ncomplete  ADB\u2019s  allocation  of  the  $100  million  in  renewable  energy  financing.  CTF  support  is \nplaying  a  pivotal  role  in  building  critical  mass  for  the  first  generation  of  solar  and  wind  power \nprojects in Thailand and will help catalyze self-sustaining long-term private sector investment in \nthe subsector. \n \n4. \nThailand  generates  70%  of  its  electricity  using  natural  gas  and  18%  from  coal  and \nlignite. Its domestic natural gas resources have long been a reliable source of low-cost energy, \nbut growing demand and dwindling reserves in the Gulf of Thailand mean that it must find new \nfuels to meet its growing electric power needs. Fortunately, the country has abundant biomass, \nbiogas,  mini  hydro,  solar,  and  wind  resources  available  for  renewable  energy  development. \n                                                \n1  Administered by Asian Development Bank. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3   Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. 2015.

The program allows private developers to build, own, and operate  renewable energy \npower  projects  and  enter  into  power  purchase  agreements  (PPAs)  with  the  Electricity \nGenerating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), which is the state-owned power utility and obligated to \nbuy the electricity that they generate.8 Renewable energy SPPs are also eligible for an incentive \nin  the  form  of  a  feed-in  tariff  on  top  of  the  wholesale  electricity  price.  Continued  government \nsupport through  the  SPP  program  and  this  incentive  are  essential  if the  project  is to be  viable \nand remain sustainable. \n \n6. \nProject  design.  The  project  entails  the  construction  and  operation  of  wind  power \nfacilities  with  a  total  installed  power  generation  capacity  of  260  MW  in  Chaiyaphum  Province, \nabout 300 kilometers northeast of Bangkok.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nSponsor.  Energy  Absolute  was  established  in  2006  and  focuses  on  solar  and  wind \n7. \npower generation and biodiesel production and distribution. As of June 2015, the company had \nfour solar power projects in operation with a capacity of 188 MW and one 90 MW project under \nconstruction. Its total solar capacity is expected to be 278 MW once construction of that project \nis completed. The company is also constructing a 126 MW wind farm in southern Thailand with \ncommercial operations expected in the second quarter of 2016. Energy Absolute is listed on the \nStock  Exchange  of  Thailand  in  the  market  for  alternative  investments.  Its  current  market \ncapitalization  is  about  $2.26  billion.9 The  European  online  magazine  named  Energy  Absolute \nthe renewable energy company of the year in Asia in 2014.10 \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nADB\u2019s review of the borrowers does not give ADB cause to believe that any such entity \n8. \nhas  been  established,  or  is  being  used  for  cross-border  tax  evasion,  money  laundering,  or \nterrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the project. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n9. \nImpact.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  broader  production  and  consumption  of \nrenewable  energy  and  investment  in  renewable  energy  from  private  sector  increased.  The \nproject  will  help  diversify  the  country\u2019s  energy  mix  by  adding  renewable  energy  capacity  and \nhelp  meet  the  government\u2019s  long-term  clean  energy  targets  (para.  2).11 Thailand  is  promoting \nthe  development  of  alternative  sources  of  energy,  including  the  use  of  wind  for  power \ngeneration,  as  it  transitions  to  a  low-carbon  economy  and  seeks  to  achieve  sustainable  long-\nterm  economic growth.

The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.12 The review reaffirmed ADB\u2019s support under Strategy \n2020  for  development  that  is  environmentally  sustainable;  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in \nmeeting growing energy demand in the region; and capitalizing on ADB\u2019s operating strengths in \ninfrastructure  development,  finance,  and  other  areas.13 The  midterm  review  also  supports  the \nexpansion of environmentally friendly technologies for clean and efficient energy generation and \nuse, as well as a larger role for private sector financing of infrastructure. \n \n13. \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Thailand  for  2013\u20132016.14 The  country \nstrategy  supports  three  core  strategic  pillars:  knowledge  and  innovation,  private  sector \ndevelopment, and regional cooperation and integration. These are to be operationalized in four \nprogram areas: (i) infrastructure; (ii) finance sector development; (iii) the environment, including \nclimate  change;  and  (iv)  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  The  government\u2019s  energy \ndevelopment  plan  for  2015\u20132036  notes  that  private  investment  in  the  use  of  Thailand\u2019s  wind \npower potential can reduce the future need for energy imports (footnote 3).  \n \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  which  emphasizes  investments  in \n14. \nenergy  efficiency,  renewable  energy  projects,  and  wider  access  to  energy.15 It  will  move  ADB \ntoward its target of investing  $2 billion a year in clean energy to accelerate low-carbon growth \nand reduce regional greenhouse gas emissions and closer to the target of ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations Department to make one in four of its projects approved each year a  clean energy \nproject. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n\n15. \n \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nArrangements \nThe project is being developed under the government\u2019s small power producer program, \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2014.

Wind power projects in Thailand receive a \nfeed-in tariff incentive of B3.5 per kilowatt-hour in addition to the wholesale rate for 10 \nyears from the start of commercial operations.  \nThe project will be developed and managed by Energy Absolute. Energy Absolute is the \nlargest renewable energy company in Thailand and is listed on the Stock Exchange of \nThailand. The company currently has 188 MW of solar power plant capacity in operation \nand 90 MW under construction. It is also building a 126 MW wind power plant, with \ncommercial operations expected in the second quarter of 2016.  \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n  \nEGAT has committed to buying all the electricity generated by the project\u2019s 260 MW of \ninstalled capacity under standard renewable energy PPAs it has signed with the five \nborrowers. The PPAs have a 5-year term with automatic 5-year extensions. The \nborrowers will receive monthly revenue by selling electricity at a rate comprising the \naverage countrywide wholesale tariff and a feed-in tariff incentive of B3.5 per kilowatt-\nhour. The incentive will end 10 years from the start of commercial operations, after which \nthe companies will receive the wholesale market rate. With their automatic extensions, \nthe terms of the PPAs will at least match the project\u2019s economic life and exceed the full \nterm of the debt.  \nWind power has high up-front capital costs and minimal operating costs. The long-term \naverage cost structure is highly predictable. Wind energy is free, and spending on \nmaintenance and replacement of parts is limited. Debt financing is the only material \nongoing expense and the dominant factor in determining the economics and viability of \nwind power projects.  \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nPower offtake is supported by EGAT, Thailand\u2019s state-owned utility. \nThe borrowers will submit semiannual environmental and social monitoring reports to \nADB during construction and each year thereafter. The performance indicators are \nincluded in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1 of the report and \nrecommendation of the President). \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EGAT  =  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand,  MW  =  megawatt,  PPA  = \npower purchase agreement, Q = quarter. \na Balance of plant operation and maintenance works include the operation and maintenance of the power transformer, \nswitchgear,  cable,  electrical  equipment,  monitoring  system,  fire  alarm,  security  system,  lightning,  grounding,  and \nelectrical system \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n16. \n\nADB support for the project is justified by the following: \n\n\f5 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  longer  repayment  period  allowed  by  the  ADB  and  CTF  loans  and  the \nconcessional  nature  of  the  CTF  loan  are  necessary  for  the  borrowers  to  have \nmanageable  debt  service levels  over  the  project  life. The  project\u2019s  sustainability \ndepends on the borrowers\u2019 ability to amortize the high up-front capital costs over \na  long  period  to reduce annual  debt  service and  mitigate the  effects  of  volatility \nfrom  intermittent  revenues.  This  is  especially  important  in  countries  where  few \nwind farms  are  operating  and  actual  performance data  is  lacking. The financing \nof wind power plants is still at a nascent stage in Thailand. ADB will help mitigate \nthe  risks  of  wind  power  development  in  this  project  by  providing  the  long  loan \ntenor  and  the  concessional  CTF  loan  and  helping  to  mobilize  the  local \ncommercial bank financing.  \nUnder  the  ADB  Thailand  Private  Sector  Renewable  Energy  Program,  ADB  is \ntasked  with  identifying  eligible clean energy  projects  and  administering the CTF \nprogram  to  support  CTF  and  the  government  of  Thailand\u2019s  renewable  energy \ntargets  (para.  3).  ADB\u2019s  CTF  program  helps  bridge  the  gap  in  the  financing \nneeded for renewable energy projects in developing countries. ADB assistance in \nadministering  the  CTF  program  is  helping  to  build  critical  mass  for  a  first \ngeneration of renewable energy projects in Thailand. \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n17. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment,  category  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The project sites are in an agricultural area with marginal land mainly used to grow such \ncash crops as cassava and corn. The sites are not along a major fly route for migratory birds, \nand  no  bat  populations are  known  to  exist  nearby.  Environmental  impacts  during  construction \nwill  generally  be  site-specific  and  reversible  through  mitigation  measures  that  can  be  readily \ndesigned  and  implemented.  Potential  noise  and  shadow  flicker  impacts  during  operations  are \nexpected to be within acceptable limits. Due diligence in September 2015 identified the project\u2019s \npotential environmental and social impacts, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, \nand  compensate  for  the  adverse  impacts  will  be  incorporated  in  the  safeguard  reports  and \nplans.  The  commitment  and  institutional  capacity  of  Energy  Absolute  and  the  borrowers  to \nmanage these impacts are both deemed adequate. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n18. \nThe  project  has  been  assigned  a  no-gender-elements  category  under  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nGender  and  Development  (1998).  During  construction,  about  250  workers  will  be  engaged, \nmainly as skilled and unskilled laborers. The project will include a grievance redress mechanism \nto receive complaints and facilitate their resolution in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). \n \nThe borrowers will comply with national labor laws. Pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \n19. \nStrategy (2001), they will also take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core \n\n\f6           \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nlabor  standards.16 The  borrowers  will  report  regularly  to  ADB  on  (i)  their  compliance  and  the \ncompliance  of  the  contractors  with  such  laws,  and  (ii)  the  measures  they  take  to  mitigate \nsafeguard  impacts,  which  will  be  included  in  periodic  safeguards  monitoring  reports  to  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB.  Information  disclosure  and  consultations  with  affected  people  are  being \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements.17 \n \nB. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nEnergy  Absolute,  Banchuan  Development,  Benjarat  Development,  Nayangklak \n20. \nDevelopment,  Nayangklak  Wind  Power,  and  Pongnok  Development  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s \npolicy  of  implementing  best  international  practice  relating  to  combating  corruption,  money \nlaundering,  and the financing  of terrorism.
