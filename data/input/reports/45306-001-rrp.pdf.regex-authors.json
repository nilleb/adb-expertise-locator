I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Takhiatash Power Plant Efficiency Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project, to be implemented in the Takhiatash thermal power plant (TPP), involves \nbuilding two combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) units, decommissioning old and inefficient \npower  generation  units,  improving  energy  efficiency,  and  increasing  power  supply  to  the \nKarakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  regions.  It  includes  a  capacity  development  component  to \nimprove corporate performance and a social development component to foster gender equality.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Uzbekistan is one of the fastest-growing economies in Central Asia, aspiring to become \nan upper-middle-income country by 2020. The economy has sustained a high growth rate \naveraging  over  8%  (2007\u20132013).  Generally,  stable  macroeconomic  conditions  and  robust \ngrowth are set to continue as Uzbekistan aims to develop a highly developed and diversified \nindustrial and export base. In particular, the Karakalpakstan and Khorezm regions, inhabited by \n3 million people and located in the western part of Uzbekistan, will continue to attract important \ninvestment projects. Reliable power supply is critical to support industrial development in these \nregions. Indeed, these regions expect power demand to grow at 3%, double the expected \nmedium-term national average rate of 1.5%.  \n \n4.  The Takhiatash TPP is the main source of power supply in the Karakalpakstan and \nKhorezm  regions.  In  2012,  power  consumption  in  these  regions  was  2,293 gigawatt-hours \n(GWh)  with  maximum  load  of  466 megawatts  (MW).  By  2020,  the  power  consumption  is \nexpected to exceed 3,620 GWh, with maximum load of 620 MW. With 730 MW of installed \ncapacity, the Takhiatash TPP now comprises five gas-fired steam turbine generation units. \nThree  units  totaling  310  MW  have  passed  their  designed  economic  life,  and  have  been \noperating with derated capacity (130 MW), low thermal efficiency (23.7%), and limited plant \navailability (25%).3 The other two units, totaling 420 MW, are 26 years old or less.4 However, \ntheir capacity is derated by 15%, the efficiency is low at 31%, and they are overutilized to meet \ndemand, which prevents regular maintenance.  \n \n5.  To ensure reliable power supply, the government and Uzbekenergo, the state-owned \npower utility, identified the project as a priority, and decided to (i) construct two CCGT units \n(230\u2013280 MW each); (ii) decommission three existing power units (Nos. 1\u20133); and (iii) maintain \ntwo  power  units  (Nos. 7\u20138)  for  backup  operation.  This  approach\u2014construction  of  energy-\nefficient  units  while  decommissioning  old  and  inefficient  ones\u2014will  be  the  first  integrated \nmodernization model and will pave the way to restructuring a power sector that faces acute \nissues with aging assets.  \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA): ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Takhiatash Power Plant Efficiency Improvement Project. Manila. \n(TA 8142-UZB, for $1.2 million, approved on 16 August 2012). \n3  Of the three units, two of 100 MW each (No. 1 and No. 2) were built in 1969; No. 3, of 110 MW, was built in 1974.  \n4  No. 7, commissioned in 1987, and No. 8, commissioned in 1990, have installed capacity of 210 MW each.  ", "2 \n6.  Indeed, Uzbekistan\u2019s power generation plants are generally old and inefficient, requiring \nurgent  modernization.  The  aging  power  plants  are  a  result  of  underinvestment  in  power \ninfrastructure after the collapse of the Soviet Union. More than 75% of the power plant units are \nover 30 years old, reaching or exceeding their economic life.5 The thermal efficiency averages \n31%, while that of energy-efficient CCGTs exceeds 50%. Although the country is endowed with \nabundant proven natural gas reserves and potential gas reserves are being explored, natural \ngas is not infinite. The reserve to production ratio for the country\u2019s natural gas is estimated at \nabout 25\u201330 years. Replacing existing power generation assets with energy-efficient equipment \nis a key strategy for saving energy, securing reliable power supply, and reducing greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emission.  \n \n7.  To  date,  Uzbekistan\u2019s  power  sector  has  shown  steady  progress  in  meeting  new \nchallenges. In an attempt to improve energy efficiency, one CCGT was commissioned in Navoi \nTPP and four more CCGT units are under preparation with confirmed funding.6 On the sector \nreform,  the  electricity  tariffs  have  been  steadily  raised  since  2004  to  ensure  financial \nsustainability. Financial transparency has improved since Uzbekenergo, with the assistance of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  adopted  external  audits  based  on  the  International \nStandards  of  Auditing  (ISA)  starting  from  fiscal  year  (FY)  2011.7 Further,  to  reduce  high \nelectricity losses and to spur demand-side energy efficiency improvement, Uzbekenergo has \nsecured  funding  to  introduce  an  advanced  electricity  metering  program  in  nine  of  the  14 \nregions.8 \n \n8.  Nonetheless,  further  efforts  to  improve  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  corporate  performance  are \nnecessary. The utility needs to develop a strategy and build the capacity to become more \ncommercially  bankable in  the  medium term.  It  needs  to  introduce  a modern management \nsystem with performance accountability. Uzbekistan and Uzbekenergo will benefit from learning \nand adopting best international practices for tariff determination to improve efficiency and to \nensure  full  cost  recovery.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  information  technology  infrastructure  needs \nimprovements in management information system.  \n \n9.  The  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  for \nUzbekistan, which includes a focus on energy efficiency and reliable power supply.9 The project \nis included in the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for Uzbekistan.10 ADB has three \nongoing projects in the energy sector, addressing the need for energy efficiency, reliable power \nsupply, and development of renewable energy (footnotes 7 and 8).11  \n  \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2010.

Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project\u2019s impact will be more reliable power supply. The outcome will be increased \nenergy-efficient power supply for the Karakalpakstan and Khorezm regions. The project will \ngenerate  more  electricity  with  less  gas,  lower  GHG  emission,  and  less  water,  thereby \ncontributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Outputs \n11.  Efficient and clean energy. The project will construct two CCGT units (230\u2013280 MW \neach) with at least 52% thermal efficiency at the existing Takhiatash TPP. Three existing units \n(Nos. 1\u20133)  will  be  decommissioned  and  two  (Nos. 7\u20138)  will  be  kept  for  backup  power \ngeneration, while underutilized structures (blocks 1 and 2) will be demolished and the land will \nbe  remediated.  A  single  turnkey  contractor  will  undertake  these  physical  components.  An \nimplementation consultant will prepare the bidding documents.  \n \n12.  Capacity development. The project will develop Uzbekenergo\u2019s capacity for becoming \na commercially bankable utility. Tariff methodology study and training will develop the skills \nrequired to improve the tariff determination model and ensure cost-recovering tariff setting. \nCorporate performance management capacity will be measured and managed by developing \nkey performance indicators. A risk-profile assessment study will help Uzbekenergo gain better \naccess to financing. The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) consultant prepared the \nterms of reference and the capacity development road map.  \n \n13.  Social development. The project will build a community social service center adjacent \nto the Takhiatash TPP. The center, open to TPP employees and residents of Takhiatash City, \nwill create jobs and include facilities such as laundry services, health checkups, and a gym. It \nwill thus help improve the community\u2019s welfare and foster gender equality. The need for these \nfacilities was established in a social survey undertaken by the project preparatory TA consultant. \nThe Takhiatash TPP will be responsible for the sustainable operation of the facilities. \n \nD.

The government  has requested  a  loan  of $300  million from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  straight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years, \nand the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. The government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility \nbased on these terms and conditions and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \ndecision and not made in reliance on a communication from ADB. The loan proceeds will be \nrelent from the borrower to Uzbekenergo pursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement at the same \ninterest rate as that applicable to the loan. Uzbekenergo will assume the foreign exchange risk.  \n \n16.  Uzbekistan will arrange counterpart financing as follows: (i) coverage of taxes and duties \namounting to $94 million; (ii) Uzbekenergo\u2019s internal resources to cover the remaining balance \nof the  project  cost  ($36  million)  including  ancillary  infrastructure,  community  social  service \ncenter, recurrent cost, land acquisition, and interest during construction; and (iii) a loan from the \nUzbekistan Fund for Reconstruction and Development to Uzbekenergo in the amount of $270 \nmillion to cover a part of the power plant turnkey contract and related contingencies.12  \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Amount   Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank   300.0  42.9% \nUzbekistan Fund for Reconstruction and Development  270.0  38.6% \nUzbekenergo  36.0  5.1% \nGovernment   94.0  13.4% \n Total  700.0  100.0% \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.            \n                                                \n12  Uzbekistan Fund for Reconstruction and Development, established in 2006, is a 100% state-owned fund with $15 \nbillion of charter capital to finance important investment projects in Uzbekistan\u2019s priority industrial sectors (e.g. oil \nand gas, chemicals, energy, and metals and mining) which contribute to the country\u2019s socio-economic development. \nIt has partnered with foreign investors, international financial institutions, and export credit agencies.  \n ", "5 \nE.

The procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \n                                                \n13  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \namended from time to time)  and  follow  international  competitive  bidding  procedures  using \nADB\u2019s two-stage bidding method without prequalification. ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents \nfor Plant: Design, Supply, Install will be used.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n19.  The proposed CCGT units use well-established and natural-gas-based technology, and \nwill have thermal efficiency of at least 52% with a designed capacity of 230\u2013280 MW each. The \nCCGT units will be a multi-shafted configuration with one gas turbine, one heat-recovery steam \ngenerator, and one steam turbine. With the two CCGT units constructed on the same site, the \nplant design can be optimized to save cost by sharing systems such as water intake, gas supply \nfacility, water treatment plant, wastewater treatment facility, switchyard, and substation. The \ncooling system will need to withstand extreme weather conditions both in summer and winter, \nand the two-stage bidding procedure will allow the bidders to propose the optimal solutions \nincluding air, wet, or hybrid cooling system. The CCGT units will provide base and peak power \ngeneration to ensure safe, more flexible, and efficient operation. The whole system will be \ndesigned, supplied, and installed by a single system integrator. Construction of the units will \ntake about 30 months, and the units will be operated and maintained by the Takhiatash TPP.  \n \n20.  The power plant infrastructure\u2014e.g., power evacuation, gas supply, and water supply \nsystems\u2014has been constructed for the existing capacity of 730 MW. Natural gas is supplied \nfrom the Gazli Group gas field in Bukhara region, and the dedicated gas distribution station is \nlocated about 2 kilometers away from the Takhiatash TPP. Gas reserves and supply capacity of \n1,014.5 million cubic meters per year is assured for the lifetime of the CCGT units through \nrenewal of the annual gas supply contract with Uzbekneftegaz, another wholly state-owned \nenterprise. Water is supplied from the Amu Darya River through the canal. Two other canals \nwith pump stations act as backup canals. The two backup canals will be running only when the \nwater level is low in the intake canal. Power is evacuated through the 110-kilovolt and 220-\nkilovolt substations and can be evacuated through the existing switchgears and transmission \nlines  with  minor  upgrades  on  the  switchyard.  The  transmission  capacity  is  540 MW  and \nsufficient for the project. However, Uzbekenergo has a plan to expand the transmission capacity \nto improve stability and reliability of the grid in the future. \n \n21.  After commissioning the first CCGT unit, the power generation units Nos. 1\u20132 will be \ndecommissioned. Power unit No. 3 will be decommissioned after the second CCGT unit is \ncommissioned. The outdated units Nos. 1\u20133 have exceeded their designed economic life and \nare currently running at an efficiency of about 24%. The project will also demolish the remaining \nstructures for the already dismantled units 1 and 2. The other two units (Nos. 7 and 8) have \nbeen  overutilized  to  meet  increasing  power  demand  in  the  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm \nregions,  which  left  no  time  for  sufficient  maintenance.  After  the  two  CCGT  units  are \ncommissioned, units Nos. 7\u20138 will be maintained as backup during maintenance and overhaul \nof the CCGT units.  \n \n22.  Although the Takhiatash TPP is well endowed with engineers experienced in steam \nturbine operation and maintenance, operating a CCGT requires different technical know-how. \nTraining  the  plant  engineers  in  CCGT  operation  and  maintenance  will  be  part  of  the \nengineering, procurement, and construction contract. \n \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  The project is financially and economically viable. The financial internal rate of return is \n6.6%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  at  0.8%.  The \nincremental benefits include the sale of additional power generated by the two CCGT units, and \ngas savings as a result of higher energy efficiency of the CCGT technology.  \n \n24.  The economic benefits comprise incremental benefits as a result of more electricity \nconsumption and nonincremental benefits from fuel savings. The sensitivity analysis suggests \nsufficient robustness of the project under all tested assumptions. The economic internal rate of \nreturn is 32.6%, which is greater than the economic opportunity cost of capital.  \n \n25.  Uzbekenergo has operated profitably since 2008. The gross profit margin has been \nabove 10% throughout the period, but has decreased from 35.1% in 2008 to 11.3% in 2012, \nlargely due to higher-cost maintenance of aging facilities. Despite slow growth in the volume of \nelectricity sales (at an annual average of 1.5% since 2008), low fuel costs and semiannual tariff \nadjustments to reflect inflation have contributed to the profitability of Uzbekenergo. \n \n26.  Financial projections for 2013\u20132020 indicate that the financial base remains stable if \ntariff adjustment remains synchronized with inflation and gas prices. Improvement of tariff policy \nand  determination  practice  under  the  capacity  development  component  of  this  project  will \nensure the sustainability of Uzbekenergo\u2019s profitability, and boost its ability to attract financing. \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  The pre-mitigation risk level of Uzbekenergo is considered substantial given that its \ncurrent  financial  management  capacity  requires  further  strengthening,  especially  in  the \nrecruitment and retention of qualified financial and accounting professionals, automation of the \naccounts  consolidation  and  management  reporting  process,  and  ability  to  become  fully \ncompliant with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Uzbekenergo needs to \nstrengthen its financial management capacity.  \n \n28.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s accounting policies, procedures, and financial reporting have followed \nUzbekistan\u2019s national accounting and auditing standards. However, to step up its financial \nmanagement, Uzbekenergo undertook an external audit of its financial statements in FY2011 \nbased on the ISA issued by the International Assurance Auditing Standards Board. The results \nindicated  the  need  for  further  improvements,  such  as  in  the  classification  methods  and \nimpairment provisions on account receivables, the scope of account consolidation, and the \naccounting  system.  Uzbekenergo  started  to  adopt  the  IFRS  in  FY2012.  The  capacity \ndevelopment plan under other ADB-financed projects will strengthen Uzbekenergo\u2019s information \nsystems  with  the  objective  of  improving  its  financial  management  capability  (footnote  7).\n \nUzbekenergo\u2019s financial management risk after mitigation is moderate. \n \n29.  Uzbekenergo\u2019s procurement capacity was assessed as average risk. As an institution, it \nhas experience with multilateral and bilateral financiers, including ADB. However, the capacity \nof  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  is  weak.  An  international  project  preparatory  TA \nconsultant has provided procurement training for Uzbekenergo\u2019s key PMU staff. Consultants will \nbe  recruited  to  take  part  in  the  bidding  process  and  handle  project  management  and \nsupervision. An early-warning system will be established to ensure timely procurement and \nproject implementation.  \n \n ", "8 \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Uzbekenergo.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 13). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The increased efficiency and reliability resulting from the project will have a positive \nimpact on economic growth and poverty reduction. Electricity is essential not only for rich and \nmiddle-income consumers but also for the poor to meet their basic needs. The project area of \nKarakalpakstan is a socially and environmentally vulnerable area. The Karakalpakstan and \nKhorezm regions, with 3 million people in urban and rural areas, are the direct beneficiaries of \nthe project. Small local businesses, as well as service providers such as schools and health \ncenters,  will  also  benefit  from  more  reliable  power  supply.  Reliable  power  supply  is  also \nessential  for  large-scale  industrial  development  projects,  which  would  bring  much-needed \nincome opportunities to the regions.  \n \n32.  The project features effective gender mainstreaming. More reliable power supply to \nhouseholds will benefit women, who are mostly the managers of household activities. Reliable \nlighting for homes, businesses, streets, and marketplaces is also critical for facilitating women\u2019s \nand girls\u2019 involvement in educational, entrepreneurial, and community activities. The project will \nconstruct a community social service center, which will be equipped with facilities to cater for the \nlaundry, dry-cleaning, and carpet-cleaning needs of the local community, especially women, as \nwell as Takhiatash TPP staff\u2014in all, about 50,000 people. The center will generate employment \nfor at least 20 women (50% of jobs created). This will provide significant gender benefits and \nreduce women\u2019s time poverty, given that more than 90% of households have no washing \nmachines and women so far had to do laundry by hand. To promote gender equality, the key \nperformance indicators to be developed under the capacity development component will include \ngender indicators.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  Environment.  The  project  is  categorized  A  for  environment,  and  will  involve \nimprovement of existing facilities. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \n(SPS),  an  environmental  impact  assessment  for  construction  of  the  CCGT  units  and \ndecommissioning of existing  units was prepared, and was disclosed on 20 May 2013. An \nenvironmental compliance audit was also carried out. The environmental impact assessment \ncovers the findings from the environmental compliance audit. The environmental management \nplan was prepared to mitigate impacts from the construction of the CCGT units. Corrective \naction  is  planned to  improve  the  environmental  performance  of the  existing facilities. Two \nconsultations with potentially affected people were carried out in May 2013 and July 2013, and a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  was  established  within  the  Takhiatash  TPP  to  resolve  any \ncomplaints. \n \n34.  Building the CCGT units will generate temporary and reversible impacts such as dust, \nnoise, and vibrations. Operating the CCGT units will have positive impacts because ambient air \nquality will improve due to fewer emissions, and water use and noise levels will be lower than in \nthe current units. The Takhiatash TPP will strengthen its health and safety unit by adding staff \nwho will be responsible for implementing the environmental management plan, including the \ncorrective  action  plan  to  improve  the  environmental  performance  of  the  existing  facilities. \nUzbekenergo  is  committed  to  implementing  mitigation  measures  incorporated  in  the \nenvironmental management plan, which are considered adequate.  \n ", "9 \n \n35.  Social safeguards. The project is categorized B for involuntary resettlement. Building \nthe CCGT units will require additional land next to the existing facilities. The land acquisition and \nresettlement  plan  (LARP)  was  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS  (2009)  and  was \ndisclosed on 1 August 2013. The LARP was also prepared in accordance with the government\u2019s \nresolution on land acquisitions. Aside from individual consultations with affected people while \nsurveying the inventory of losses, the official consultation with affected people was carried out \non 10\u201313 May 2013. More consultations are planned if the LARP needs to be updated during \ndetailed design, as well as during the implementation of the LARP.  \n \n36.  Permanent land acquisition will involve 2.29 hectares and temporary acquisition will \ninvolve 4.55 hectares. This will affect 10 households, two private firms, and two farms, with 144 \naffected people. Buildings affected by land acquisition cover an area of 3,950 square meters, of \nwhich  1,980  square  meters  belong  to  two  private  businesses.  Based  on  the  government \nresolution and ADB\u2019s SPS (2009), it is estimated that compensation costs for land acquisition \nwill be around $1.4 million. The social compliance audit revealed no past or present complaints \nabout land being used for the existing facilities.  \n \n37.  The project is categorized C for indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s SPS \n(2009). All the ethnic groups living in the project areas have equal access to all social and other \nservices, including health, education, and water and sanitation. None of the groups are socially \nexcluded either in terms of legislation or in terms of the actual social living conditions. Further, \nnone of the ethnic groups maintain cultural or social identities and characteristics separate from \nthe  mainstream  Uzbekistan  society,  that  would  classify  them  as  ethnic  minorities  and/or \nindigenous peoples.  \n \n38.  Safeguard capacity. Uzbekenergo has experience in implementing ADB\u2019s requirements \nfor environmental and social safeguards. It has a capacity development program under an \nexisting  ADB-financed  project,  which  aims  to  enhance  its  institutional  safeguard  capacity \n(footnote 7). Moreover, to step up its compliance with the safeguard requirements, Uzbekenergo \nwill employ a safeguards expert through the project implementation consulting firm.   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.14 The overall risk is low with the mitigation \nmeasures. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLimited operational  (i)  Training in operation and maintenance will be included in the turnkey contract.  \nexperience with CCGTs  \nDelayed procurement  (i)  An international consulting firm will be recruited during project implementation.  \nand implementation of  (ii)  The PMU will recruit experienced procurement specialists. \nturnkey contract  (iii) Procurement training is provided through PPTA to the PMU staff.   \n(iv) The institutions responsible for contract registration assessment will be involved in \nthe procurement and consultant recruitment process to avoid delays in the contract \nregistration required for contract effectiveness.  \n(v)  ADB will continue dialogue with the government to improve the contract registration \nand review process.  \n \n                                                \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nTariff level becomes  (i)  The government has increased the tariff regularly at a rate above the inflation rate, \nsuboptimal   and confirmed that the same policy will be maintained.  \nLimited financial  (i)  No imprest account will be established.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n40.  The government and Uzbekenergo have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. The government \nand Uzbekenergo have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set \nforth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n41.  As a condition for loan effectiveness, a subsidiary loan agreement for the relending of \nthe ADB loan to Uzbekenergo, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, shall have been \nsigned and become effective in accordance with the terms. In addition, no disbursement for the \nturnkey  contract  will  be  made  until  a  loan  agreement  between  the  Uzbekistan  Fund  for \nReconstruction and Development and an eligible commercial bank, and a related subsidiary \nloan agreement between such bank and Uzbekenergo, both for the purposes of the project and \nin  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  have  been  signed  and  become  effective  in \naccordance with their terms. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Takhiatash  Power  Plant  Efficiency \nImprovement Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \n     President \n \n24 June 2014 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  By 2023:    Assumptions \nMore reliable power  Total domestic power  Uzbekenergo\u2019s annual  Stable economic growth. \nsupply in  generated increased from  performance report  Power demand grows by at \nUzbekistan  52 TWh (2010) to 65 TWh     least 1.5% per annum. \n     \nTotal installed power  Uzbekenergo\u2019s annual  Government continues to \ngeneration capacity  performance report  support power sector \nincreased from 12,400 MW    development and reform plans  \n(2010) to 14,400 MW      \n    Electricity tariffs regularly \nTotal GHG emission  Key world energy  adjusted to cover costs \nintensity reduced from  statistics from the   \n4.53 kg CO e/dollar GDP  International Energy  Risk \n2\n(2009) to 3 kg CO e/dollar  Agency  Limited investments in energy-\n2\nGDP   efficient technologies \nOutcome  By 2020:    Assumptions \nIncreased energy-  Power generated from  Takhiatash TPP  Sufficient power evacuation \nefficient power  Takhiatash TPP increased  statistics  capacity is available. \nsupply in the  from 3,276 GWh (2011) to     \nKarakalpakstan  3,896 GWh     Gas remains available for \nand Khorezm      power generation. \nregions  Thermal efficiency of the  Takhiatash TPP   \nnew plant increased from  statistics  Sufficient water remains \n23.7% (2011) to 52%     available for power generation. \n     \nTakhiatash TPP GHG  Takhiatash TPP  National investment plan for \nemission reduced from  statistics  the energy sector executed \n2.1 mtCO e (2011) to    without delay \n2\n1.7 mtCO e      \n2\n    Power sector investment \nTakhiatash TPP gas  Takhiatash TPP  environment improves \nconsumption decreased  statistics  (regulatory and legislative \nfrom 1,117 million m3    framework and transparency) \n(2011) to 799 million m3      \n     \nTakhiatash TPP water  Takhiatash TPP \nconsumption decreased  statistics \nfrom 453 million m3 (2011)   \nto 51 million m3  \nOutputs      Risks \n1.
