This  is  a  combined  loan  from  the  Asian  Development \nBank;  the Leading Asia\u2019s Private Infrastructure Fund1 (LEAP); and the Canadian Climate Fund \nfor the Private Sector in Asia II (CFPS II) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility.2 \nIf  the  Board  approves the proposed  loan, I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the \nBoard, approve the administration of the LEAP and CFPS II loans. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Identification \n\n \n2. \nIndonesia  is  the  largest  economy  in  Southeast  Asia,  with  a  gross  domestic  product \nestimated at $932.3 billion (current US$) in 2016.3 The economy experienced consistent growth \nafter the Asian financial crisis, averaging 5.0% per year during 2011\u20132016 (down from 6.4% in \n2010). Improved access to affordable and sustainable forms of energy is critical to enhance the \ncompetitiveness of Indonesia\u2019s power infrastructure, which has been struggling to keep up with \nthe  country\u2019s  strong  economic  performance.  The  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources \n(MEMR) projects that power demand will increase significantly under current economic forecasts, \nresulting in a shortage of up to 35 gigawatts (GW) before 2020. If not addressed adequately, this \ncould undermine the country\u2019s sustainable growth potential. \n \nIndonesia has an abundance of renewable energy sources. It is estimated that Indonesia \n3. \nhas  29.5  GW  of  potential  geothermal  energy  resources  (the  largest  in  the  world),  75.0 GW  of \npotential  hydropower,  532.6  GW  of  potential  solar  power,  32.6  GW  of  potential  biomass  and \nbiogas, and 113.5 GW of potential wind power.4 However, as of 2016, only 9.4 megawatts (MW) \nof wind power (less than 0.1% of the country\u2019s total potential) had been developed.5 \n \n4. \nTo cope with the predicted electricity shortages over the medium term, the Government \nof  Indonesia  introduced  various  fast-track  programs  to  accelerate  the  development  of  power \ngeneration. In its national power development plans for 2015\u20132024, the government introduced \na  third  fast-track  program  targeting  the  addition  of  35  GW  of  power  by  2019.  In  early  2017, \npursuant to the National Electricity Business Plan (Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik \nRUPTL), 2017\u20132026, the government adjusted the target completion dates and capacities under \n\n                                                \n1  The Japan International Cooperation Agency is the financing partner. \n2  The Government of Canada is the financing partner. https://www.adb.org/documents/canadian-climate-fund-private-\n\nsector-asia-2 \n\n3   World Bank (2017) World Development Indicators, World Bank, Washington D.C \n4  Government  of  Indonesia,  MEMR.  2016.

The \ngovernment has set ambitious targets to increase the share of energy supplied from renewable \nenergy from 12% in 2013 to 23% in 2025.7 By 2025, the MEMR plans to increase the capacity of \npower generation connected to the grid through new and renewable energy to 45.0 GW, 1.8 GW \nof which will come from wind energy.  \n \nSimultaneously, the government aims to bring down the cost of electricity generation. New \n5. \nregulations were issued in January 2017 to set renewable energy tariffs compared to the price of \nthe local and national grid price, to regulate the procurement process (regulation no 12 and 50) \nand more generally for the power sector to re-allocate some risks under the PPA (regulation No \n10,  but  subsequently  amended  for  the  better  by  regulation  No.  49).  PPA\u2019s  for  wind  and  solar \nprojects signed after 2017 will be subject to a tariff cap. In regions where the cost of the regional \ngrid is higher than the national average cost; the tariff will be capped at 85% of that respective \ngrid.  For areas where the cost of the regional grid is lower than the national grid, the tariff will be \nagreed upon with PLN by negotiation, although it is understood that the national average is set \nas a cap. Against this backdrop, the Equis Group has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto catalyze funding for one of the first utility-scale commercial wind projects in Indonesia. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n \n6. \nThe  project  involves  the  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  a  portfolio  of \nrenewable energy projects by the Equis Group in East Indonesia. The portfolio consists of (i) a 72 \nMW wind power plant in Jeneponto (South Sulawesi); (ii) several renewable energy projects in \nEastern Indonesia. The scope of phase 1 is limited to the 72 MW wind power plant. The wind \nproject will comprise (i) 20 turbines, each 135 meters high with rotor blades 63.5 meters long; (ii) \n14  kilometers  (km)  of  roads;  (iii)  a  pooling  substation;  (iv)  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nfacilities; (v) a 33-kilovolt underground collector system connecting the turbines; and (vi) a 3.5 km, \n150-kilovolt  overhead  transmission  line  to  the  Perusahaan  Listrik  Negara  (PLN)  Jeneponto \nsubstation. Equis will develop and implement the project under a 30-year build, own, operate, and \ntransfer power purchase agreement (PPA) with PLN, the state-owned electric utility company. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\n3. \n\nBorrower and Sponsors \n\n \nThe borrower will be EBJ, an Indonesian special purpose vehicle 95% owned by Redaya Energi \nPrivate Limited, a subsidiary of the Equis Group. Headquartered in Singapore,  Equis is one of \nAsia\u2019s  largest  independent  infrastructure  private  equity  fund  managers  with  a  strong  focus  on \ndeveloping  renewable  energy.  Since  its  inception  in  2010,  the  group  has  developed  and  is \noperating 4.7 GW of renewable energy generation assets (solar, wind, and hydropower) across \nAsia, and is the largest renewable energy independent power producer in Asia and the Pacific.  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\n                                                \n6  Government of Indonesia, MEMR. 2017.

The \nresults of integrity and tax due diligence are set out in the integrity disclosure document.  \n \nB. \n \nImpacts.  The  government  aims  to  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energy  in  the  total \n8. \nprimary energy supply to 23% by 2025.10 PLN\u2019s power generation capacity is intended to increase \nto 45GW, of which wind energy will contribute 1.8GW. Furthermore, using sustainable electricity \nas a key driver of increased economic activity will enhance the quality of life in Indonesia. \n \n9. \nOutcome. The outcome will be 234 gigawatt-hours of wind power contributed annually to \nsatisfy  the  increasing  electricity  demand.  Providing  this  wind  energy  will  avoid  carbon  dioxide \nemissions equivalent to 159,000 tons per year. \n \n10. \nOutputs. The outputs will be (i) 72 MW in wind power capacity installed and operated by \nthe private sector, (ii) local employment generated by the construction and operation of the wind \npower plant, and (iii) local and national economic growth stimulated. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  project  supports  private \nsector infrastructure and environment, two of the five core pillars of ADB\u2019s long-term strategy as \nreaffirmed by the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.11 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Indonesia, 2016\u20132019 in supporting the expansion of infrastructure and \nenvironment-friendly  technologies for  clean  energy  generation.12 The  project  contributes to the \nobjectives of Indonesia\u2019s National Energy Policy (2014) and to the 2015 commitment to the Paris \nAgreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change13. The project \nis mentioned in the RUPTL, 2017\u20132026 PLN project pipeline for South Sulawesi. \n \nConsistency with the sector strategy and ADB operations. The project is consistent \n12. \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy, 14 which  states  that  support  for  renewable  energy  projects  will  be \nprioritized  and  broadened.  The  project  fully  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy  for \nIndonesia, which has the following main pillars: (i) undertake sector policy reform to make access \nto energy more sustainable and inclusive;  (ii) strengthen the reach, reliability, and efficiency of \nthe  nation\u2019s  electricity  grid;  and  (iii)  enable  the  greater  use  of  clean  energy.  Furthermore,  the \nproject complements recent ADB assistance programs to the MEMR and PLN for policy-based \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2003.

The project also further broadens the exposure of \nADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  to  the Indonesian  energy  sector,  which  so  far  is \nconcentrated in geothermal generation and gas-related infrastructure projects. \n \n13. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  The  project  will  benefit  from  the  Private  Sector \nOperations  Department\u2019s  (PSOD)  exposure  to  the  Indonesian  power  sector  and  experience \ngained from structuring and implementing those energy projects in Indonesia. PSOD\u2019s experience \nindicate that successful project implementation depends on the sponsors\u2019 strength, experience, \nand  ability  to  understand  the  regulatory  environment,  as  well  as  the  terms  and  conditions \ngoverning the financing of such projects. Other important key lessons from the earlier transactions \nin the renewable sector are the need to focus on: i)  risks associated with land acquisition and \nacquisition of rights of way, ii) adequate power evacuation infrastructure; and iii) receivables and \npayment delay status with off-taker. ADB is confident that Equis can successfully implement the \nproject, given its track record. \n \nD. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE. \n \n14. \n \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.17 \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nImplementation period \n\nConstruction arrangements \nType of arrangement \n\nContractor \n\nArrangements \nEquis will develop the project under Indonesia\u2019s Electricity Law (2009).

To date, only 9.4 MW of wind \npower is being operated by PLN and only one other wind project is currently under construction. \nCommercial electricity production based on renewable energy has been struggling in Indonesia \nfor  decades,  largely  due  to  the  absence  of  a  transparent  regulatory  framework,  clear  support \nmechanisms, and financial incentives. The successful financing and completion of this project will \nhave a positive demonstration effect for the country\u2019s nascent renewable energy sector. \n \n16. \nThe project\u2019s sustainability depends on its ability to amortize its high up-front capital costs \nover  a  longer  period  to  reduce  annual  debt  service  and  mitigate  volatility  from  intermittent \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nrevenues, which is especially important in countries with few operational wind farms and a lack of \nactual performance data.  \n\n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n17. \nThe  project  supports  the  government\u2019s  objective  of  accelerating  and  expanding  private \nsector investment in clean energy infrastructure in Indonesia. In administering the CFPS II loan \nand identifying eligible clean energy projects, ADB is playing a pivotal role in building a critical \nmass of first-generation renewable energy projects in Indonesia. \n \nC. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n18. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  the  environment  and  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous \npeoples. To meet the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements for an environment category B \nproject, EBJ has prepared environmental and social impact assessments for both the wind power \nplant and the power transmission line, and submitted these to ADB for review prior to disclosure.18 \nMost  of  the  project  components  will  be  situated  on  rice  paddies  that  are  largely  rain-fed  and \nproduce only one crop each year. The project site is not a habitat of terrestrial or avian faunal \nspecies,  nor  is  it  situated  along  the  global  route  of  migratory  birds.  An  important  bird  area, \nKaraeng-Lompobattang, is 20 km northeast of the project site. The transmission line route was \ndesigned to avoid sensitive areas and minimize disruption and inconvenience to the community. \nEBJ  has  identified  the  project\u2019s  potential  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  incorporated \nmeasures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for any adverse impacts in the safeguard \nreports and plans. EBJ\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to manage the project\u2019s social and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate by ADB. The project\u2019s environmental impact and \nmitigation measures are discussed in detail in the safeguards and social dimensions summary.19 \n \n19. \nThe  project  comprises  44  hectares  (ha)  and  cuts  across  eight  villages  in  Jeneponto \nRegency. It is not situated in or overlapping any traditionally owned land or lands with customary \nrights.  To  expedite  the  project,  EBJ  procured  project  land  using  a  willing  buyer\u2013willing  seller \nprocess  without  availing  of  the  provisions  of  National  Land  Agency  Law  No.  2/2012  on  land \nprocurement for development in the public interest. Land acquisition did not result in involuntary \nresettlement because of physical or economic displacement. \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\n                                                \n18 EBJ has also completed the government-required environmental impact assessment for the wind power project, and \nobtained an environmental permit on 6 March 2017.  Based on the Regulation of the Minister of Environment No. \n5/2012, the construction of an electricity line project with a capacity of 150 kilovolts does not require an environmental \nimpact assessment since the planned activities will not significantly impact the environment. Instead, EBJ prepared \nan environmental management and monitoring effort report as a prerequisite to obtaining an environmental permit, \nas mandated in the Indonesian Government Regulation No. 27/2012 regarding environmental permits. \n19 Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nEBJ will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n20. \n(2001), will take measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards.20 EBJ \nwill report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with such laws, and (ii) the \nmeasures taken.
