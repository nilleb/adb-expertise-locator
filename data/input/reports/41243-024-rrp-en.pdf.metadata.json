THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for the additional financing of the Fourth Health Sector Development Project.  \n \n  The additional financing will address cost overruns to complete the Songinohairkhan \ndistrict hospital (SDH)\u2014a new demonstration general hospital in Songinohairkhan, a poor and \nunderserved district in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Fourth Health Sector Development \nProject on 29 November 2010, to be financed by a $14.00 million Asian Development Fund grant, \n$0.45 million in parallel cofinancing from the World Health Organization, and a $3.70 million \ncontribution from the Government of Mongolia.1 The project consists of three components to \nstrengthen (i) hospital services in Ulaanbaatar, (ii) human resources development, and (iii) drug \nsafety. The grant closing date is 31 December 2020. \n \n  In March 2012, the government requested additional financing to establish the new SDH \ninstead of renovating the existing district hospital under component 1 of the grant. ADB approved \nthe additional financing on 5 November 2012, comprising a concessional loan of $25.00 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) and a government contribution of $2.00 million.2 \nThe loan closing date is 31 December 2020. The loan consists of the same components as the \ngrant. \n \n  In November 2018, the government requested a second additional financing of $16.00 \nmillion to complete the SDH under component 1. The project faces cost overruns caused by (i) \nnew government regulations introduced during the implementation of the current project, such as \nnew  requirements  for  seismic  resistance  and  upgraded  national  standards  for  hospital \nconstruction;  (ii)  limited  restructuring  of  the  building  to  address  requests  made  by  nearby \nresidents; (iii) the construction of a separate building to house the hospital electrical substation \nand medical gas container, which were originally planned to be located in the basement of the \nhospital, to conform with the requirement of the government inspection authority; (iv) variations in \nthe bill of quantities because of omitted works and changes to the quantities of works included in \nthe contract; and (v) additional costs to reroute the hospital access road because of the decision \nof the government to retain the existing hospital.3 The decision to retain the existing hospital was \nmade in 2018 to address acute shortages of long-term services for chronic conditions, including \npalliative care and rehabilitation services. Rerouting of the hospital access road requires resettling \na small number of households to ensure access for patients, emergency services, and hospital \nsuppliers; and provide parking space for visitors. The proposed additional financing does not \ninvolve any scale-up of or modification to the current design of the SDH. \n \n  Current project performance. The current project is performing well as it meets all \ncriteria: (i) the delivery of the expected outputs is rated successful (component 1 is completed \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n3  Reasons and Estimations of Cost Overruns (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \nexcept for the construction of the SDH, component 2 is 98% completed, and component 3 was \ncompleted in 2015);4 (ii) the project is rated on track under the project performance system;5 \n(iii) the  review  of  safeguards  compliance  confirmed  that  the  project  has  no  fiduciary  and \nsafeguards policy compliance issues and that each safeguard covenant item is being complied \nwith;6 and (iv) the management of risks is rated successful as all risks included in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan have been managed successfully. As of May 2019, the \noverall progress in establishing the SDH is estimated at 66% and construction is planned to be \ncompleted in January 2020.7 Of the total $42.83 million, $30.75 million has been contracted and \n$24.09 million has been disbursed: $5.60 million from the ADB grant, $17.58 million from the \nconcessional OCR loan, $0.46 million from government contributions, and $0.45 million from the \nWorld Health Organization. The uncommitted $5.00 million from the ADB grant and $2.81 million \nfrom government are planned for procurement of medical equipment, information communication \ntechnology and furniture for the SDH upon completion of construction works. \n \n  Eligibility criteria for additional financing. The additional financing is considered to \nmeet the four eligibility criteria for additional financing.8 First, ADB reviewed the current project in \nDecember 2018 and confirmed its satisfactory performance and that no significant changes in \napproaches and methodologies were envisioned (footnote 4). Accordingly, the current project \nremains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. Second, the government \naccords high priority to the current project given its role in providing critical health services in an \nunderserved and densely populated district of Ulaanbaatar. The SDH represents a concrete step \ntoward the implementation of the amended Health Law, 2011 by providing a broader range of \nservices in district hospitals.9 It will also serve as a model to be replicated in other districts of \nUlaanbaatar.10 Third, the project outcome, outputs, and project scope of the overall project remain \nunchanged and consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives. Fourth, the overall project \nis  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2017\u20132020  for  Mongolia,  which \nemphasizes social development through the efficient delivery of health services.11 \n \n  Relevance of the additional financing. Additional financing is the most appropriate \nmodality to fund the cost overruns to complete the SDH in the most efficient way. Through this \napproach,  current  effective  implementation  arrangements\u2014such  as  the  project  steering \ncommittee, executing and implementing agencies, the project implementation unit (PIU), and the \ncivil works contractor and supervisor\u2014will be maintained to ensure a high degree of readiness \nfor the implementation of the additional financing. Completion of the SDH\u2014including the new \nregulatory and quality standards\u2014reinforces its demonstration effect, establishing a new standard \nfor modern hospitals in Mongolia in accordance with the State Policy on Health, 2017\u20132026.12 \nThe benefits of completing the current project clearly outweigh any consideration of scaling down \n                                                \n4  ADB (East Asia Department). 2018.

Scaling down the hospital would result in an incomplete model hospital \nwhose services do not meet the requirement of the amended Health Law (footnote 9). Canceling \nthe current project is not an option as it would result in an 80% completed hospital structure with \nno health services provided in an underserved district of Ulaanbaatar. \n \n  Strategic fit. The additional financing and the current project are in line with the State \nPolicy on Health, 2017\u20132026 objective to improve the accessibility and quality of hospital services; \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2017\u20132020  for  Mongolia  (footnote  11);  and  ADB\u2019s \nOperational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020.13 The overall project is also aligned with the ADB \nStrategy 2030 goal of addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities by locating the SDH \nin a high poverty area in Ulaanbaatar, strengthening governance and institutional capacity through \nhealth management improvement, accelerating progress in gender equality by improving health \nservices for women, and constructing a hospital with improved disaster resilience.14 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n  The impact and the outcome of the overall project remain unchanged. The overall project \nis aligned with the following impact: health status of the Mongolian population, including the poor, \nimproved (footnote 12). The overall project will have the following outcome: improved health \nsector efficiency, governance, and drug safety implemented nationwide.15 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n  The 12 outputs of the overall project remain unchanged, and the additional financing will \nhelp complete the construction of the SDH under output 3. The time frame of two indicators under \noutputs 3 and 4 has been adjusted to reflect the revised completion years of the SDH and the \npublic reporting system on hospital performance. All other outputs of the overall project have been \ncompleted. \n \n  The outputs of the overall project are grouped under three components: \n(i)  Component 1: Strengthened hospital services in Ulaanbaatar. The overall \nproject has assisted the government in preparing a hospital development policy \nand strategic plan for Ulaanbaatar (output 1), operationalized a hospital capital \nplanning  system  (output  2),  and  improved  the  hospital  governance  system \n(output 4). The additional financing will assist in completing the development of a \ndemonstration multifunction general hospital in Songinohairkhan (output 3). \n(ii)  Component  2:  Strengthened  human  resources  development.  The  overall \nproject  has  strengthened  the  postgraduate  specialist  structure  and  residency \ntraining (output 5) and integrated a hospital management module in a training \ninstitution (output 6). \n(iii)  Component  3:  Strengthened  drug  safety  regime.  The  overall  project  has \nestablished a drug regulatory authority (output 7),16 strengthened drug regulatory \nfunctions  (output  8),  upgraded  the  drug  control  laboratory  to  international \nstandards (output 9), upgraded the standards of good manufacturing processes \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2015.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n  The current project has ensured international accreditation of the central drug laboratory \n(the first international accredited laboratory in Mongolia) through the implementation of biosafety \nstandards level 2 and proper disposal of hazardous chemical waste and the installation of a \nventilation system separating clean and contaminated air, among others.18 \n \n  The construction of the SDH is in line with the latest national and selected international \nstandards; and integrates modern patient management concepts, high building functionality, and \nimproved  earthquake  resilience  and  fire  safety  standards.  Medical  technology  (imaging, \nlaboratory, and sterilization) will take local conditions into account following national guidelines. \nMaintenance services included in the supply contracts and strengthening of maintenance services \nwill enhance local capacity to maintain supplied equipment. An international hospital management \nfirm  will  provide  technical  assistance  to  the  SDH  after  construction  to  assist  in  hospital \nmanagement, service expansion and integration, human resources development, financing, \nequipment operations and maintenance, and communication and hospital information technology. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n  The project\u2019s 20-year economic viability was assessed by estimating the economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) for the establishment of the SDH and was undertaken in accordance with \n                                                \n18 Biosafety levels are a series of protections and safeguards against infectious agents designed to protect laboratory \npersonnel, as well as the surrounding environment and community. \n ", "7 \nADB guidelines.19 The economic analysis incorporates an update of the assessment carried out \nunder the current project. The project\u2019s economic benefits include efficiency savings through the \nintroduction of new services and improved treatment at the SDH, savings to consumers through \nreduced travel costs to access hospital services, time savings to consumers of health services \nand escorts through reduced travel time to seek health services, and new job opportunities. The \nproject will also generate substantial unquantifiable benefits related to improved productivity, \nimproved health literacy by educating patients and families, and the creation of job opportunities \nin hospital-related businesses. The EIRR for the current project was estimated as 11.95%. The \nupdated EIRR for the overall project is 7.7% and the economic net present value is $5.3 million. \nAn EIRR for health projects above 6.0% is considered acceptable when substantial unquantifiable \nbenefits are present (footnote 19). The overall project is considered economically viable. A \nsensitivity analysis of potential benefit reductions and a recurrent cost increase indicate that the \noverall project remains economically viable. \n \n  The financial analysis was undertaken following ADB guidelines.20 The analysis focused \non financial sustainability and evaluated the government\u2019s fiscal capacity to finance counterpart \nfunding and incremental recurrent costs after project completion, as the project has no revenue-\ngenerating component. The project is found to be financially sustainable at the project level as \nthe funds requirement for the counterpart contribution during the implementation period (2012\u2013\n2020) is less than 1% of the health sector annual budget. The recurrent costs of the overall project \nare estimated at $3.32 million per year or 1% of the forecast government health budget. Low \nbudget predictability within the sector poses a substantial risk and may result in shortages of funds \nfor  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  hospital.  To  ensure  future  project  sustainability,  the \ngovernment  has  agreed  to  provide  assurances  that  operation  and  maintenance  and  other \nrequired funding are available on a timely basis. The risks and mitigation measures are outlined \nin Table 4. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n  The MOH has been a partner of ADB since 1991. The additional financing includes limited \nprocurement activities consisting of direct contracting for the SDH construction and a civil works \npackage for the construction of the parking space and the second access road of the hospital site. \nThe PIU established for the current project, which is performing satisfactorily, will continue to \nhandle all project financial matters, procurement, and recruitment of consultants, supervised by \nthe MOH. The contractor for the construction of the SDH works under an International Federation \nof Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) contract with the MOH. Civil works supervision is carried out \neffectively by the design company and the Ulaanbaatar City Investment Department. In addition, \nthe MOH has recruited a civil works coordinator to monitor construction progress independently \nand coordinate stakeholders\u2019 activities at the construction site. The PIU staff prepares monthly \nconstruction works progress reports and provides ADB and the MOH regular updates. The \nupdated procurement and financial management capacity assessment concluded that the overall \nproject procurement management risk is low and the financial management risk is moderate. The \nexecuting  agency  has  adequate  capacity  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, and disbursement policies and guidelines. \n \n  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2017.

Poverty and Social \n \n  Additional financing will enable the completion of the SDH to improve the range and quality \nof hospital services provided to the population. The SDH will directly benefit about 320,000 mostly \npoor residents of Songinohairkhan, a poor and medically underserved district of Ulaanbaatar.21 \nThe overall project will also benefit the entire population of Mongolia by improving access to safer \ndrugs, and, in the long run, will improve allocative efficiency in the health sector by optimizing the \nuse of hospital services and improving the return on future investment in hospitals. Poverty and \nhealth are strongly related, and better health services are not only a social goal but also a \nprerequisite to economic development. Therefore, improved health care will expand the economic \nopportunities of the whole population, including the poor. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy was updated to reflect additional financing.22 \n \n  The current and overall project are classified effective gender mainstreaming. In Mongolia, \nthe health status of the population is highly differentiated by sex. The male mortality rate is high, \nand male life expectancy is low compared with females, primarily because of unhealthy lifestyle \nhabits such as smoking and heavy drinking. Women comprise the majority of users and providers \nof Mongolia\u2019s health care system, head 8.7% of all households in the country,23and provide most \n \ncare for sick family members. About 80% of the country\u2019s medical staff are women. Most gender \nactions have been completed, but implementation of the gender action plan will be continued.24 \nThe current project has ensured the participation of at least 50% of women in postgraduate and \nhospital management training, and capacity building and planning activities for drug regulatory \nactivities. The overall project will continue to ensure the participation of women in working groups \nand decision-making bodies, identify and address gender-specific needs for hospital services and \ndiagnostics, and increase the employment of women in the new SDH. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n  Environment (category B). The initial environmental examination (IEE)25 of the current \nproject was updated following ADB policies and requirements, including the Safeguard Policy \nStatement. The updated IEE addressed the environmental impact of the project modifications, \nincluding (i) constructing a 40-square-meter (m2) electrical substation and a 49 m2 medical gas \nbuilding within the hospital site to conform with the requirement of the government inspection \nauthority and (ii) rerouting the hospital access road. The principal environmental impacts to \ncomplete the SDH are (i) increased traffic congestion near the project sites, (ii) increased noise \nand dust levels, and (iii) occupational and community health and safety issues. These impacts \nare considered reversible and site specific and can easily be mitigated to acceptable levels \nthrough sound environmental management planning. The updated IEE concluded that the project \nis unlikely to have significant adverse environment, health, and safety impacts. \n \n                                                \n21 An analysis of the hospital bed capacity of the Songinohairkhan district in relation to its population points to an \nimportant bed shortage. This contrasts with some other districts of Ulaanbaatar that have a bed capacity surplus. \n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 National Statistics Office of Mongolia. 2018.

Ulaanbaatar. \n24 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n  Environmental management and monitoring plans have been prepared, with budgets and \nresponsibilities for implementation assigned. The climate risk for the additional financing is low. \nContractors will implement these environmental management measures during construction, and \nfacility operators and the MOH will implement them during operation. The effectiveness of these \nmeasures will be regularly evaluated in the framework of the environmental monitoring program, \nand corrective actions will be defined as required. The government is committed to managing the \nidentified environmental risks. The updated IEE has been disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The current project was classified category C for \ninvoluntary resettlement as the SDH is being constructed on existing government land and does \nnot require resettling households. The additional financing is classified category B because \nrerouting the hospital access road will have an impact on a limited number of households. Based \non the census and preliminary inventory of lost assets carried out in March 2019, 16 plots will be \naffected (2,013 m2 of licensed and 1,400 m2 of unlicensed land). Of the 21 households, eight have \nhouses or gers (traditional tents) and must relocate. Consultations have been carried out with the \naffected households during resettlement planning and will continue during resettlement plan \nupdating and implementation. A land acquisition and resettlement plan has been prepared \nfollowing the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement and Mongolian laws.26 The resettlement plan \nfollows the principle of replacement cost; describes the grievance redress mechanism established \nfor the project; and includes mitigation measures to address the impacts and risks on the affected \nhouseholds, especially the poor and vulnerable households. The government is committed to \nmanage resettlement issues and to update and implement the resettlement plan. Copies of the \nresettlement information booklets were distributed to the affected persons and the resettlement \nplan has been disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n  Indigenous peoples (category C). The social analysis and consultations confirmed that \nseparate ethnic minorities are not present in the project area of the additional financing project. \nAll people will benefit from access to quality hospital services. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks, and the \noverall risk after mitigation measures is moderate for the overall project. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.27 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nGovernment does not allocate sufficient  Project-generated  O&M  costs  will  be  estimated  before  the \nfunds for O&M costs generated by  annual budget preparation, and ADB and the PIU will monitor \noverall project investments and  their inclusion in the MOH budget.
