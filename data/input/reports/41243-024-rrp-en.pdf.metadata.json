The grant closing date is 31 December 2020. \n \n\n \n\nIn March 2012, the government requested additional financing to establish the new SDH \ninstead of renovating the existing district hospital under component 1 of the grant. ADB approved \nthe additional financing on 5 November 2012, comprising a concessional loan of $25.00 million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and a government  contribution  of  $2.00 million.2 \nThe loan closing date is 31 December 2020. The loan consists of the same components as the \ngrant. \n \n\n \n\nIn  November  2018,  the  government  requested  a  second  additional  financing  of  $16.00 \nmillion to complete the SDH under component 1. The project faces cost overruns caused by (i) \nnew government regulations introduced during the implementation of the current project, such as \nnew  requirements  for  seismic  resistance  and  upgraded  national  standards  for  hospital \nconstruction;  (ii)  limited  restructuring  of  the  building  to  address  requests  made  by  nearby \nresidents; (iii) the construction of a separate building to house the hospital electrical substation \nand medical gas container, which were originally planned to be located in the basement of the \nhospital, to conform with the requirement of the government inspection authority; (iv) variations in \nthe bill of quantities because of omitted works and changes to the quantities of works included in \nthe contract; and (v) additional costs to reroute the hospital access road because of the decision \nof the government to retain the existing hospital.3 The decision to retain the existing hospital was \nmade in 2018 to address acute shortages of long-term services for chronic conditions, including \npalliative care and rehabilitation services. Rerouting of the hospital access road requires resettling \na small number of households to ensure access for patients, emergency services, and hospital \nsuppliers;  and  provide  parking  space  for  visitors.  The  proposed  additional  financing  does  not \ninvolve any scale-up of or modification to the current design of the SDH. \n \n\n \n\nCurrent  project  performance.  The  current  project  is  performing  well  as  it  meets  all \ncriteria: (i) the delivery of  the expected outputs is rated successful (component 1 is completed \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan for Additional \n\nFinancing to Mongolia for the Fourth Health Sector Development Project. Manila. \n\n3  Reasons and Estimations of Cost Overruns (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fexcept for the construction of the SDH, component 2 is 98% completed, and component 3 was \ncompleted  in  2015);4  (ii)  the  project  is  rated  on  track  under  the  project  performance  system;5 \n(iii) the  review  of  safeguards  compliance  confirmed  that  the  project  has  no  fiduciary  and \nsafeguards policy compliance issues and that each safeguard covenant item is being complied \nwith;6  and  (iv)  the  management  of  risks  is  rated  successful  as  all  risks  included  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan have been managed successfully. As of May 2019, the \noverall progress in establishing the SDH is estimated at 66% and construction is planned to be \ncompleted in January 2020.7 Of the total $42.83 million, $30.75 million has been contracted and \n$24.09  million  has  been  disbursed:  $5.60  million  from  the  ADB  grant,  $17.58  million  from  the \nconcessional OCR loan, $0.46 million from government contributions, and $0.45 million from the \nWorld Health Organization. The uncommitted $5.00 million from the ADB grant and $2.81 million \nfrom government are planned for procurement of medical equipment, information communication \ntechnology and furniture for the SDH upon completion of construction works. \n \n\n \n\nEligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing.  The  additional  financing  is  considered  to \nmeet the four eligibility criteria for additional financing.8 First, ADB reviewed the current project in \nDecember  2018  and  confirmed  its  satisfactory  performance  and that  no significant  changes  in \napproaches  and  methodologies  were  envisioned  (footnote  4).  Accordingly,  the  current  project \nremains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound. Second, the government \naccords high priority to the current project given its role in providing critical health services in an \nunderserved and densely populated district of Ulaanbaatar. The SDH represents a concrete step \ntoward  the  implementation  of  the  amended  Health Law,  2011  by  providing  a broader range of \nservices  in  district  hospitals.9  It  will  also  serve  as  a model  to  be  replicated  in  other  districts  of \nUlaanbaatar.10 Third, the project outcome, outputs, and project scope of the overall project remain \nunchanged and consistent with the project\u2019s development objectives. Fourth, the overall project \nis  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2017\u20132020  for  Mongolia,  which \nemphasizes social development through the efficient delivery of health services.11 \n \n\n \n\nRelevance  of  the  additional  financing.  Additional  financing  is  the  most  appropriate \nmodality to fund the cost overruns to complete the SDH in the most efficient way. Through this \napproach,  current  effective  implementation  arrangements\u2014such  as  the  project  steering \ncommittee, executing and implementing agencies, the project implementation unit (PIU), and the \ncivil works contractor and supervisor\u2014will be maintained to ensure a high degree of readiness \nfor  the  implementation  of  the  additional  financing.  Completion  of  the  SDH\u2014including  the  new \nregulatory and quality standards\u2014reinforces its demonstration effect, establishing a new standard \nfor modern hospitals in Mongolia in accordance with the  State Policy on  Health, 2017\u20132026.12 \nThe benefits of completing the current project clearly outweigh any consideration of scaling down \n\n                                                \n4  ADB (East Asia Department). 2018.

Scaling down the hospital would result in an incomplete model hospital \nwhose services do not meet the requirement of the amended Health Law (footnote 9). Canceling \nthe current project is not an option as it would result in an 80% completed hospital structure with \nno health services provided in an underserved district of Ulaanbaatar. \n \n\n \n\nStrategic  fit. The  additional  financing  and the  current  project  are  in line  with the  State \nPolicy on Health, 2017\u20132026 objective to improve the accessibility and quality of hospital services; \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2017\u20132020  for  Mongolia  (footnote  11);  and  ADB\u2019s \nOperational  Plan  for  Health,  2015\u20132020.13  The  overall  project  is  also  aligned  with  the  ADB \nStrategy 2030 goal of addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities by locating the SDH \nin a high poverty area in Ulaanbaatar, strengthening governance and institutional capacity through \nhealth management improvement, accelerating progress in gender equality by improving health \nservices for women, and constructing a hospital with improved disaster resilience.14 \n \nB. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nThe impact and the outcome of the overall project remain unchanged. The overall project \nis aligned with the following impact: health status of the Mongolian population, including the poor, \nimproved  (footnote  12).  The  overall  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  improved  health \nsector efficiency, governance, and drug safety implemented nationwide.15 \n \nC. \n \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\nThe 12 outputs of the overall project remain unchanged, and the additional financing will \nhelp complete the construction of the SDH under output 3. The time frame of two indicators under \noutputs 3 and 4 has been adjusted to reflect the revised completion years of the SDH and the \npublic reporting system on hospital performance. All other outputs of the overall project have been \ncompleted. \n \n\n \n\nThe outputs of the overall project are grouped under three components: \n(i) \n\nComponent  1:  Strengthened  hospital  services  in  Ulaanbaatar.  The  overall \nproject  has  assisted the government  in preparing  a  hospital  development  policy \nand  strategic  plan  for  Ulaanbaatar  (output  1),  operationalized  a  hospital  capital \nplanning  system  (output  2),  and  improved  the  hospital  governance  system \n(output 4). The additional financing will assist in completing the development of a \ndemonstration multifunction general hospital in Songinohairkhan (output 3). \nComponent  2:  Strengthened  human  resources  development.  The  overall \nproject  has  strengthened  the  postgraduate  specialist  structure  and  residency \ntraining  (output  5)  and  integrated  a  hospital  management  module  in  a  training \ninstitution (output 6). \nComponent  3:  Strengthened  drug  safety  regime.

Medical  technology  (imaging, \nlaboratory, and sterilization) will take local conditions into account following national guidelines. \nMaintenance services included in the supply contracts and strengthening of maintenance services \nwill enhance local capacity to maintain supplied equipment. An international hospital management \nfirm  will  provide  technical  assistance  to  the  SDH  after  construction  to  assist  in  hospital \nmanagement,  service  expansion  and  integration,  human  resources  development,  financing, \nequipment operations and maintenance, and communication and hospital information technology. \n \nB. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\nThe project\u2019s 20-year economic viability was assessed by estimating the economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) for the establishment of the SDH and was undertaken in accordance with \n                                                \n18 Biosafety levels are a series of protections and safeguards against infectious agents designed to protect laboratory \n\npersonnel, as well as the surrounding environment and community. \n\n \n\n\fADB guidelines.19 The economic analysis incorporates an update of the assessment carried out \nunder the current project. The project\u2019s economic benefits include efficiency savings through the \nintroduction of new services and improved treatment at the SDH, savings to consumers through \nreduced travel costs to access hospital services, time savings to consumers of health services \nand escorts through reduced travel time to seek health services, and new job opportunities. The \nproject  will  also  generate  substantial  unquantifiable  benefits  related  to  improved  productivity, \nimproved health literacy by educating patients and families, and the creation of job opportunities \nin hospital-related businesses. The EIRR for the current project was estimated as 11.95%. The \nupdated EIRR for the overall project is 7.7% and the economic net present value is $5.3 million. \nAn EIRR for health projects above 6.0% is considered acceptable when substantial unquantifiable \nbenefits  are  present  (footnote  19).  The  overall  project  is  considered  economically  viable.  A \nsensitivity analysis of potential benefit reductions and a recurrent cost increase indicate that the \noverall project remains economically viable. \n \n\n \n\nThe financial analysis was undertaken following ADB guidelines.20 The analysis focused \non financial sustainability and evaluated the government\u2019s fiscal capacity to finance counterpart \nfunding and incremental recurrent costs after project completion, as the project has no revenue-\ngenerating component. The project is found to be financially sustainable at the project level as \nthe funds requirement for the counterpart contribution during the implementation period (2012\u2013\n2020) is less than 1% of the health sector annual budget. The recurrent costs of the overall project \nare  estimated  at  $3.32  million  per  year  or  1%  of  the  forecast  government  health  budget.  Low \nbudget predictability within the sector poses a substantial risk and may result in shortages of funds \nfor  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  hospital.  To  ensure  future  project  sustainability,  the \ngovernment  has  agreed  to  provide  assurances  that  operation  and  maintenance  and  other \nrequired funding are available on a timely basis. The risks and mitigation measures are outlined \nin Table 4. \n \nC. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\nThe MOH has been a partner of ADB since 1991. The additional financing includes limited \nprocurement activities consisting of direct contracting for the SDH construction and a civil works \npackage for the construction of the parking space and the second access road of the hospital site. \nThe  PIU  established  for  the  current  project,  which  is  performing  satisfactorily,  will  continue  to \nhandle all project financial matters, procurement, and recruitment of consultants, supervised by \nthe MOH. The contractor for the construction of the SDH works under an International Federation \nof  Consulting  Engineers  (FIDIC)  contract  with  the  MOH.  Civil  works  supervision  is  carried  out \neffectively by the design company and the Ulaanbaatar City Investment Department. In addition, \nthe MOH has recruited a civil works coordinator to monitor construction progress independently \nand coordinate stakeholders\u2019 activities at the construction site. The  PIU staff prepares monthly \nconstruction  works  progress  reports  and  provides  ADB  and  the  MOH  regular  updates.  The \nupdated procurement and financial management capacity assessment concluded that the overall \nproject procurement management risk is low and the financial management risk is moderate. The \nexecuting  agency  has  adequate  capacity  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, and disbursement policies and guidelines. \n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n\n                                                \n19 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \nD. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \n\nAdditional financing will enable the completion of the SDH to improve the range and quality \nof hospital services provided to the population. The SDH will directly benefit about 320,000 mostly \npoor residents of Songinohairkhan, a poor and medically underserved district of Ulaanbaatar.21 \nThe overall project will also benefit the entire population of Mongolia by improving access to safer \ndrugs, and, in the long run, will improve allocative efficiency in the health sector by optimizing the \nuse of hospital services and improving the return on future investment in hospitals. Poverty and \nhealth  are  strongly  related,  and  better  health  services  are  not  only  a  social  goal  but  also  a \nprerequisite to economic development. Therefore, improved health care will expand the economic \nopportunities of  the  whole  population,  including  the  poor. The  summary  poverty  reduction and \nsocial strategy was updated to reflect additional financing.22 \n \n\n \n\nThe current and overall project are classified effective gender mainstreaming. In Mongolia, \nthe health status of the population is highly differentiated by sex. The male mortality rate is high, \nand male life expectancy is low compared with females, primarily because of unhealthy lifestyle \nhabits such as smoking and heavy drinking. Women comprise the majority of users and providers \nof Mongolia\u2019s health care system, head 8.7% of all households in the country,23\n and provide most \ncare for sick family members. About 80% of the country\u2019s medical staff are women. Most gender \nactions have been completed, but implementation of the gender action plan will be continued.24 \nThe current project has ensured the participation of at least 50% of women in postgraduate and \nhospital management training, and capacity building and planning activities for drug regulatory \nactivities. The overall project will continue to ensure the participation of women in working groups \nand decision-making bodies, identify and address gender-specific needs for hospital services and \ndiagnostics, and increase the employment of women in the new SDH. \n \nE. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\ncategories are as follows. \n \n\n \n\nEnvironment (category B). The initial environmental examination (IEE)25 of the current \nproject  was  updated  following  ADB  policies  and  requirements,  including  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The  updated  IEE  addressed  the  environmental  impact  of the  project modifications, \nincluding (i) constructing a 40-square-meter (m2) electrical substation and a 49 m2 medical gas \nbuilding  within  the  hospital  site  to  conform  with  the  requirement  of  the  government  inspection \nauthority  and  (ii)  rerouting  the  hospital  access  road.  The  principal  environmental  impacts  to \ncomplete the SDH are (i) increased traffic congestion near the project sites, (ii) increased noise \nand dust levels, and (iii) occupational and community health and safety issues. These impacts \nare  considered  reversible  and  site  specific  and  can  easily  be  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels \nthrough sound environmental management planning. The updated IEE concluded that the project \nis unlikely to have significant adverse environment, health, and safety impacts. \n \n\n                                                \n21 An  analysis  of  the  hospital  bed  capacity  of  the  Songinohairkhan  district  in  relation  to  its  population  points  to  an \nimportant bed shortage. This contrasts with some other districts of Ulaanbaatar that have a bed capacity surplus. \n\n22 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 National Statistics Office of Mongolia. 2018.

The climate risk for the additional financing is low. \nContractors will implement these environmental management measures during construction, and \nfacility operators and the MOH will implement them during operation. The effectiveness of these \nmeasures will be regularly evaluated in the framework of the environmental monitoring program, \nand corrective actions will be defined as required. The government is committed to managing the \nidentified environmental risks. The updated IEE has been disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n\n \n\nInvoluntary resettlement (category B). The current project was classified category C for \ninvoluntary resettlement as the SDH is being constructed on existing government land and does \nnot  require  resettling  households.  The  additional  financing  is  classified  category  B  because \nrerouting the hospital access road will have an impact on a limited number of households. Based \non the census and preliminary inventory of lost assets carried out in March 2019, 16 plots will be \naffected (2,013 m2 of licensed and 1,400 m2 of unlicensed land). Of the 21 households, eight have \nhouses or gers (traditional tents) and must relocate. Consultations have been carried out with the \naffected  households  during  resettlement  planning  and  will  continue  during  resettlement  plan \nupdating  and  implementation.  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared \nfollowing  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  and  Mongolian  laws.26  The  resettlement  plan \nfollows the principle of replacement cost; describes the grievance redress mechanism established \nfor the project; and includes mitigation measures to address the impacts and risks on the affected \nhouseholds,  especially  the  poor  and  vulnerable  households.  The  government  is  committed  to \nmanage resettlement issues and to update and implement the resettlement plan. Copies of the \nresettlement information booklets were distributed to the affected persons and the resettlement \nplan has been disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n\n \n\nIndigenous peoples (category C). The social analysis and consultations confirmed that \nseparate ethnic minorities are not present in the project area of the additional financing project. \nAll people will benefit from access to quality hospital services. \n \nF. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \n\nThe overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks, and the \noverall risk after mitigation measures is moderate for the overall project. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.27 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \nProject-generated  O&M  costs  will  be  estimated  before  the \nannual  budget  preparation,  and  ADB  and  the  PIU  will  monitor \ntheir  inclusion  in  the  MOH  budget.  A  loan  covenant  to  ensure \nsufficient  O&M  funds  for  the  SDH  is  included  in  the  loan \nagreement of the current project. \n\nRisks \nGovernment does not allocate sufficient \nfunds for O&M costs generated by \noverall project investments and \nactivities for hospitals, and drug \nlaboratory and drug regulatory \nimprovement measures, because of \nlack of predictable financing. \nLack of willingness to conform to the \nhospital capital planning system results \nin lack of investment coordination \n\nThe  current  project  supported  the  regulatory  framework  for \ncapital  investment  planning,  which  needs  to  be  reinforced  to \nbecome more stringent. The regulatory tools need to be better \nenforced. This will require (i) capacity building for relevant MOH \n\n                                                \n26 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \n(e.g., regulations for medical \ntechnology). \nResistance from professions and \nteaching institutions to adopt new \nmedical curricula of longer duration and \nrequiring additional resources. \nInstitutions involved in drug regulation \nresist changes. \n\nMitigating Measures \nstaff  and  (ii)  advocacy  at  government  and  parliament,  which \nhave been conducted. \nPilot testing of the new curriculum is ongoing. The overall project \nwill  advocate  in  favor  of  adoption  of  new  curricula  once  pilot \ntested. \n\nThe  ongoing  project  had  to  downscale  the  establishment  of  a \ndrug regulatory agency (component 3, output 7) because of the \ngovernment  resistance  from  competing  institutions.  A  law  on \namending the medicine law, which includes the establishment of \nthe drug regulatory agency is pending in Parliament. The overall \nproject continues to promote adoption of the draft law. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  MOH  =  Ministry  of  Health,  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance,  PIU  =  project \nimplementation unit, SDH = Songinohairkhan district hospital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n\nThe government and the MOH have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n\n \n\nThe government and the MOH have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $16,000,000 \nto Mongolia for the additional financing of the Fourth Health Sector Development Project, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n17 June 2019 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nCurrent projecta \nImproved health status of the Mongolian population, including the poorb \n \nOverall projectc \nUnchanged \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n \n \na.
