In  November  2006,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  loan  of  $400  million  for \nsubprogram 1, a loan of $26.5 million equivalent for the PDF, a grant of \n$2.0  million  for  the  TA,  and  administration  by  ADB  of  a  $7.6  million \ngrant provided by the Government of the Netherlands for the PDF. The \ncurrent proposal comprises a loan of $280 million for subprogram 2 of \nthe IRSDP. \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Multisector \nThemes:  Sustainable  economic  growth,  private  sector  development, \ngovernance \nSubthemes:  Fostering  physical  infrastructure  development,  public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships,  promoting  economic  efficiency  and  enabling \nmarkets \n \nCategory C  \n\nin \n\nthe  Southeast  Asian \n\n \nCombined  public  and  private  sector  investments  in  the  infrastructure \nsectors in Indonesia exceeded 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in \nthe mid-1990s. The Asian financial crisis of 1997 led to a steep decline \nin  overall  development  spending,  and  particularly \ninfrastructure \ninvestments.  Private  sector  investment  almost  disappeared.  At  the \nsame time, the Government realized that the public sector had borne a \ndisproportionate  share  of  the  risks  in  infrastructure  projects,  and \nstopped  providing  any  risk-sharing  support.  As a  result,  Indonesia  has \nlost  its  place  as  one  of  the  top  performers  in  terms  of  infrastructure \nprovision \nregion.  Poor  people  suffer \ndisproportionately  from  lack  of  access  to  basic  infrastructure  services. \nAvailability  of  services  is  generally  lower  in  rural  areas,  particularly \noutside  Java  and  Bali,  contributing  to  significant  regional  disparities  in \ndevelopment. \n \nAt  the  outset  of  its  term,  the  Government  estimated  that  about \n$65  billion  would  be  needed  in  new  infrastructure  investments  during \n2005\u20132009,  with  $25  billion  (38%)  to  be  sourced  from  its  budget,  $14 \nbillion  (22%)  from  domestic  banks  and  insurance  and  pension  funds, \n$10  billion  (15%)  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  partners, \nand  $16  billion  (25%)  from  domestic  and  foreign  private  sector \ninvestors.  Given \nthe  Government \nrecognized  that  PSP  could  not  be  taken  for  granted,  and  that  major \nIRSDP, \nstructural  and \n\nreforms  were  needed.  The \n\ninvestment  climate, \n\ninstitutional \n\nthe  weak \n\n \nBorrower \n \nThe Proposal \n\n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram Rationale \n\n \n\n\fformulated  jointly  by  the  Government  and  its  principal  development \npartners,  supports  a  comprehensive  medium-term  reform  agenda  in \neight infrastructure sectors.        \n \nThe program loan support three key reform pillars: \n \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nstrategic cross-sector reforms; \nsector-specific  reforms  for  transportation,  power,  oil  and  gas, \nwater supply and sanitation, and telecommunications; and \nfacilitation  of  the  preparation  and  execution  of  well-structured \nPPP \ninfrastructure \ntransactions,  resulting \nprojects that can be replicated. \n\nin  sound  model \n\n(iii) \n\ninfrastructure  development \n\n \nThe IRSDP, of which subprogram 2 is an integral part, aims to improve \nIndonesia\u2019s  overall  investment  climate  by  removing  infrastructure \nbottlenecks  and  increasing  access  to  infrastructure  services,  and \nthereby  support  timely  realization  of  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term \nmacroeconomic goals, in particular average GDP growth of 6%\u20137% per \nannum  during  2005\u20132009.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  IRSDP  is \naccelerated \nthrough  major  PSP  and \nmobilization of additional public sector resources. \n \nThe  initial  impact  of  the  IRSDP  has  been  positive.  GDP  growth \naccelerated  from  5.0%  in  2004  to  6.3%  in  2007,  and  annual \ninfrastructure  investments  rose  from  2.9%  of  GDP  in  2005  to  3.3%  in \n2006. \n \nFor  subprogram  1,  in  November  2006  ADB  provided  a  loan  of \n$400  million.  This  was  followed  in  March  2007  by  cofinancing  of \n$100  million  from  the  Government  of  Japan.  Similar  cofinancing  is \nplanned  by  the  Government  of  Japan  for  the  $280  million  ADB  loan \nproposed  for  subprogram  2  in  2008.  The  World  Bank  has  been \nsupporting  the  reform  agenda  through  its  Infrastructure  Development \nPolicy  Loan  program.  The  first  loan  of  $200  million  was  approved  in \nDecember  2007,  and  the  same  amount  is  considered  for  the  second \nloan  in  2008.  The  loans  of  the  three  development  partners  for \nsubprogram 3 are expected to be in the same order of magnitude and \nwill  be  reconfirmed  during  further  implementation  of  the  IRSDP  in \n2009\u20132010.  \n \nThe $280 million for subprogram 2 will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft \nprogram loan agreement.  \n \n\nii \n\n  \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\n \nProgram Investment \nPlan \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiii \n\nSubprogram  1  was  completed  between  January  2005  and  September \n2006.  Subprogram  2  timing  is  from  October  2006  up  to  September \n2008,  and  the  period  for  subprogram  3  is  from  October  2008  to \nSeptember  2010.  All  three  program  loans  are  disbursed  in  single \ntranches upon declaration of their effectiveness. \n \nThe  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  under  the \noverall  coordination  of  the  National  Committee  on  the  Acceleration  of \nInfrastructure Provision (KKPPI) has been the Executing Agency for the \nIRSDP.  BAPPENAS  has  closely  collaborated  with  the  Coordinating \nMinistry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and the line ministries \nconcerned  with  executing  the  IRSDP  and  implementing  the  reform \nactions.  \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill  be  disbursed  to  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans.  \n \nThe IRSDP\u2019s expected benefits include \n(i) \n\nsustained  progress  in  meeting  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic \nobjectives  articulated  in  its  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  for \n2004\u20132009; \n\n(ii)  an improved investment climate resulting from sound policy, legal, \n\nand institutional frameworks in the infrastructure sectors; \n\n(iii)  greater  PSP  and  a  more  systematic  approach  to  implementing \n\nPPP transactions, focusing on good governance; \n\n(iv)  a transparent and prudent risk-sharing system; \n(v)  quality infrastructure projects prepared and executed transparently \nand expeditiously, resulting in (a) improved availability and quality \nof \nIndonesia\u2019s \ncompetitiveness in regard to its regional neighbors, and (c) a lower \nincidence of poverty; \n\ninfrastructure  services, \n\n(b)  a  boost \n\nto \n\n(vi)  sustained engagement by ADB in policy reforms over the medium \n\nterm to strengthen the investment climate; and \n\n(vii)  aid harmonization by the principal development partners (ADB, the \nWorld  Bank,  and  the  Government  of  Japan)  around  a  common \npolicy framework, and the positive externalities resulting from joint \nendorsement of the Government\u2019s reform agenda. \n\n \nGovernment  Commitment.  The  political  commitment  could  possibly \nwaver  because  of  internal  disagreements  over  policy  directions,  or \nbecause the entire Government may change after the elections in 2009. \nThe  majority  of  opinions  within  the  current  Government  confirm  the \nnotion  that  the  Government  remains  strongly  committed  to  the  reform \nprogram embodied in the IRSDP and the complementing Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Policy  Loan  program.  The  2009  elections  pose  only  a \nmoderate  risk  of  weakened  commitment  and  a  loss  of  the  reform \nmomentum, as even with a change of Government, the new leaders are \nexpected  to  continue  focusing  on  economic  growth  and  poverty \n\nPeriod and \nTranching \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n  \n\n \n\nreduction  to  ensure  a  sound  tenure  in  office  and  mitigate  social  and \nthe  new  Government  not  be \npolitical  unrest.  However,  should \ncommitted  to  maintaining  reform  momentum,  subprogram  3  could  be \ndelayed or cancelled.  \n \nGovernment  Coordination.  At  times,  the  progress  of  infrastructure \nreforms  has  been  impeded  by  poor  coordination  among  government \nministries  and  agencies,  and  competing  and  conflicting  interests  of \nvarious stakeholders. While full and effective coordination and reforms \nin certain sectors may take time to evolve and needs further consensus \nbuilding, the essential steps taken thus far will have a demonstrational \neffect in supporting infrastructure development in a coordinated manner \nin the coming years. \n  \nGovernment  Capacity.  While  the  Government  remains  committed  to \nreform objectives, the ability to translate that commitment into practical \nreform achievements is subject to available capacity within the different \nGovernment  ministries  and  agencies.  In  several  areas,  progress  has \nbeen slower than was anticipated by the Government when the IRSDP \nwas  agreed  upon.  This  has  typically  been  the  result  of  low  capacity, \ninclude \ncompounded  by  weak  coordination.  Mitigation  strategies \nrealistic  outputs  and  schedules  based  on  likely  reform  progress,  and \ncontinued provision of TA for capacity building. \n \nPoor  Governance  and  Corruption.  With  the  high  stakes  involved  in \nlarge  infrastructure  projects,  the  IRSDP  faces  significant  risks  in  the \nform  of  weak  governance,  collusion,  and  corruption,  or  lack  of  judicial \ncapacity  to  enforce  good-governance  measures.  Such  problems  have \nbeen  common  in  the  past  in  Indonesia.  However,  during  the  last  few \nyears the Government has considerably strengthened its anticorruption \nefforts.  Procurement  reforms  have  been  under  way  for  some  time, \nresulting  in  a  competitive  and  transparent  selection  of  bidders  by  the \npublic sector. The PSP legal framework, adopted as part of the IRSDP, \nsets out clear rules for the selection of private sector sponsors for PPP \nprojects.  KKPPI  is  tasked  with  ensuring  that  tendering  processes  are \nfair  and  transparent.  The  president  of  Indonesia  has  considerably \nenhanced  the  profile  and  activities  of  the  Anti-Corruption  Commission \nand other law enforcement agencies. These steps are already having a \nsignificant impact.    \n \nMacroeconomic Stability. Domestic macroeconomic volatility, adverse \nglobal events such as high oil and food prices, natural disasters, or the \nlack  of  sustained  momentum  on  policy  reforms  could  impede  PSP. \nHowever,  over  the  last  few  years,  the  Indonesian  economy  has  been \nquite  resilient  to  domestic  and  external  shocks,  and  the  Government\u2019s \nmacroeconomic  policies  have  been  sound.  The  country\u2019s  balance  of \npayments  remains  in  strong  surplus,  foreign  reserve  levels  have \nreached  $58  billion,  and  public  debt  as  a  share  of  GDP  was  35%  in \n2007 and was expected to decline to 30% in 2008. The banking sector \nappears  sound,  with  moderate  levels  of  nonperforming  loans  and  high \ncapital\u2013adequacy  ratios.  As  a  result  of  good  macroeconomic  stability, \nIndonesia\u2019s debt rating was upgraded to BB by Fitch in February 2008. \n\n\fv \n\nFurther deterioration in global economic conditions can make Indonesia \nvulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. \n \nSocial Tensions. Tariff reforms are sensitive in any environment, and \nIndonesia  is  no  exception.  As  the  country  is  gradually  moving  away \nfrom  administered  prices  and  tariffs  for  infrastructure  products  and \nservices,  social  tensions  are  inevitable.  The  Government  has  so  far \nbeen  successful  in  reducing  such  tensions  by  the  two-pronged \napproach of (i) comprehensively socializing any planned price and tariff \nincreases,  and  (ii)  using  the  savings  from  the  reduction  in  inefficient \nsubsidies for direct poverty reduction, employment generation, and rural \ninfrastructure development. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program \n(IRSDP) \u2013 Subprogram 2. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nIndonesia has seen increasingly strong economic expansion since recovering from the \nAsian financial crisis in 1997. In 2007, economic growth accelerated to a 10-year high of 6.3%, \ndespite a slowing global economy. Domestic demand coupled with private investment has been \na  key  driver  of  the  recent  economic  growth.  Poverty  levels  fell  from  over  16.5%  in  2007  to \n15.5% in March 2008. These developments are even more surprising against the backdrop that \nIndonesia  has  also  successfully  recovered  from  a  number  of  natural  disasters,  including  the \ntsunami of December 2004 in Aceh. Despite the associated disaster relief expenditures, fiscal \nspace  has  been  created  to  enable  a  resumption  of  the  pre-crisis  levels  of  infrastructure \ninvestments.  Indonesia\u2019s  key  macroeconomic  indicators  for  2005\u20132008  are  summarized  in \nTable 1. \n \n\nTable 1: Indonesia\u2019s Key Macroeconomic Indicators \n \n\nItem \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008a \n\nGDP growth (%) \nInflation rate (%, average for the year) \nMoney supply (M2) (% annual growth) \nCentral government debt (% of GDP) \nOverall fiscal balance/GDP \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP) \nMerchandise export (annual % change) \nMerchandise import (annual % change) \nGross official reserves ($ billion) \n\n  5.5 \n13.1 \n14.9 \n35.3 \n  (0.9) \n  2.9 \n19.0 \n6.3 \n42.6 \n       a = Projected, ( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, M2 = broad money. \n\n 5.7 \n   10.5 \n   16.4 \n   45.5 \n  (0.5) \n0.1 \n22.9 \n37.2 \n   34.7 \n\n6.3 \n6.4 \n    18.9 \n    31.5 \n(1.2) \n2.4 \n14.0 \n15.0 \n56.9 \n\n6.2 \n10.6 \n16.4 \n27.6 \n(1.3) \n1.9 \n13.8 \n19.0 \n57.1 \n\nSources: Ministry of Finance, Central Bureau of Statistics, International Monetary Fund, and Asian Development \nBank estimates. \n\n \n3. \nAs  is  the  case  with  its  Asian  neighbors,  Indonesia  has  been  confronting  significant \ninflationary  pressures  in  2008;  inflation  rose  sharply  from  the  beginning  of  the  year  to  12.1% \nyear-on-year  in  September  2008.  Despite  the  current  global  economic  slowdown,  Indonesia\u2019s \nmacroeconomic  fundamentals  held  up  reasonably  well  through  the  first  8  months  of  2008. \nIndonesia\u2019s balance of payments remained in strong surplus in 2007, with the current account \nrecording a surplus of 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007. Exports jumped by 31% \nduring the first 6 months of 2008 due to higher commodity prices and volume growth. However, \nreflecting strong domestic consumer and investment growth, imports more than doubled during \nthis  period,  resulting  in  a  small  deficit  in  the  current  account  in  the  second  quarter  of  2008. \nForeign  direct  investment  continued  to  remain  strong  in  2008,  and  reserves  peaked  at  $60.5 \nbillion at the end of July 2008 before moderating to $52 billion at the middle of October 2008 as \nthe  Government  attempted  to  stabilize  the  rupiah,  which  depreciated  from  an  average  of \nRp9,150  to  the  dollar  at  the  beginning  of  September  to  Rp10,600  to  the  dollar  at  the  end  of \nOctober, amid the volatility in the financial markets. Public debt continues to fall as a share of \nGDP;  it  was  below  35%  in  2007  and  is  likely  to  approach  30%  in  2008.  Total  external  debt  is \nalso falling, and is likely to be a little below 30% of GDP in 2008.   \n \n4. \nInternational oil prices generated significant pressure on the central government budget, \nbut the overall fiscal position has remained sound. Recent trends in revenue from sources other \nthan oil and gas have been especially favorable. However, energy subsidies are likely to make \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n  \n\nup  4.7%  of  GDP  and  consume  20%  of  the  2008  budget.  Driven  by  the  increase  in  subsidies, \nmeasures  have  been  proposed  to  cut  nonpriority  spending  in  line  ministries,  reduce  subsidies \nfor  electricity,  and  ration  kerosene  to  ensure  that  it  goes  only  to  the  poor.  In  May,  the \nGovernment  increased  fuel  prices  by  29%  across  the  board.  With  these  measures,  the \nGovernment\u2019s latest tentative projection for 2008 indicates a deficit of around 1.3%, lower than \nthe 1.9% deficit indicated at the start of the year. The Government is aware that, if the remaining \nsubsidies  are  not  removed  over  the  medium  term,  they  would  crowd  out  higher-priority \ninvestments in the social and infrastructure sectors that are needed to sustain Indonesia's long-\nterm  growth  and  development  objectives.  The  Government  recognizes  the  need  for  further \nsteps towards reducing fuel subsidies.  \n \n5. \nThe  Government  is  pursuing  a  pro-growth  agenda  while  pushing  forward  on  broad \nstructural and institutional reforms. Progress has been made on all fronts, although unevenly in \nsome areas. Despite recent improvements, there is a continued need to improve the investment \nclimate, public financial management, and service delivery mechanisms to the poor, which are \nsupported  by  ADB\u2019s  development  policy1  loan  (DPSP)  series.  The  IRSDP  has  allowed  the \nGovernment to work with development partners in a flexible manner to implement critical high-\nlevel policy dialogue and cross-cutting sector reforms that address constraints to infrastructure \ndevelopment while providing predictability of financial support.  \n \n6. \nThe  structure  of  Indonesia\u2019s  financial  sector  and  exports  implies  Indonesia  is  better \nequipped  than  some  of  its  neighbors  to  confront  the  global  economic  downturn.  The  banking \nsector has limited direct exposure to developments in US financial markets, relatively low levels \nof  nonperforming  loans  (3.4%  in  August  2008),  and  high  capital  adequacy  ratios  (17.1%  in \nAugust 2008). The country is also less exposed to external shocks than other countries in the \nregion. At 50% of GDP, its trade share is relatively small, while the structure and destination of \nIndonesia\u2019s  exports  offers  some  protection  to  its  external  sector  from  the  current  downturn. \nAlmost  two-thirds  of  Indonesia\u2019s  exports  are  commodities,  the  prices  of  which  have  been \nrelatively  strong  but  are  now  showing  signs  of weakness. Moreover,  Indonesia\u2019s exports  have \nbeen  increasingly  moving  towards  economies  in  Asia  and  away  from  the  US  (12.3%  of  total \nexports in 2007) and European Union (14.5% of total exports in 2007). GDP growth is expected \nto moderate to 6.2% in 2008 and 6.0% in 2009 as export growth slows with the global economic \ndownturn.  Growth  during  this  period  will  be  sustained  by  robust  domestic  demand,  especially \ninvestment and consumption demand. However, the possibility of a prolonged and more severe \nslump in the global economy holds considerable risks for Indonesia. On the other hand, further \nprogress  in  structural  reforms  and  removing  infrastructure  bottlenecks  could  improve  growth \nprojections. This makes the continuation of the IRSDP reform agenda to catalyze the required \ninfrastructure investments even more vital.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n7. \nFor  many  years  before  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis,  Indonesia  successfully  used \ninfrastructure development to support poverty reduction and economic development. However, \nthe  financial  shock  resulted  in  cancellation  or  suspension  of  many  planned  public  and  private \ninfrastructure  projects.  Governments  during  1998\u20132004  were  burdened  with  the  more  urgent \ntasks  of  financial  sector  restructuring  and  fiscal  consolidation.  As  a  result,  infrastructure \ninvestments, which accounted for more than 6% of GDP before 1998, fell to a low of 2% in 2000 \nand  fluctuated  around  3%  in  2001\u20132006,  reflecting  a  sharp  decline  in  public  and  private \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2005.

Current  infrastructure  service  coverage  in \nIndonesia is accordingly low by regional standards. While Indonesia outperformed the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Sri Lanka, and Thailand in terms of overall infrastructure quality in 1996, 10 \nyears later these countries overtook Indonesia, which ranked 89 of the 125 countries surveyed.2 \nAbout 50 million people lack access to treated water, over 70 million lack access to electricity, \nand  close  to  200  million  do  not  have  direct  access  to  telecommunications  or  connections  to a \nsewerage network. The poor suffer disproportionately from lack of access. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nFigure 1: Infrastructure Investment in Indonesia \n \n\n6.1\n\n7\n\n8\n\nP\nD\nG\n \nf\no\n \nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n \n \n \n \n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4.5\n\n \n\n3.7\n\n 2.8\n\n3.0\n\n2.1\n\n3.6\n\n3.2\n\n3.2\n\n3.3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n \n\nSOE\n\n2006\n\n1997\n\n2001\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2002\n\n2004\n\n2003\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\nPrivate\n\nNational Gov't\n\nSub-national Gov't\n\nGov\u2019t = government, SOE =state owned enterprise. \nSource: World Bank. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n8. \nThe  availability  of  infrastructure  services  in  rural  areas,  particularly  outside  Java  and \nBali,  is  well  below  the  national  average,  contributing  to  major  regional  disparities  in \ndevelopment. About 54% of rural villages are not connected to asphalt roads, and about one-\nthird  of  these  lack  year-round  access  even  by  four-wheel-drive  vehicles.  High  transportation \ncosts are a major cause of poverty in these communities. Only 15% of rural households have \naccess  to  drinking  water  from  piped  or  pumped  sources,  and  just  21%  have  septic  tanks  for \ndisposal of human waste. The low levels of access to safe drinking water and lack of adequate \nsanitation  facilities  contribute  to  high  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  such  as  diarrhea, \nintestinal  worms,  and  skin  diseases.  The  incidence  is  higher  among  children  and  the  elderly, \nand  diarrhea  is  the  second-largest  cause  of  death  and  stunted  growth  among  young  children. \nIndonesia\u2019s infant mortality rate is the highest among the Southeast Asian countries. \n \n9. \n  While  the  Asian  financial  crisis  impeded  development  and  growth  in  all  of  Southeast \nAsia,  it  has  not  been  the  sole  reason  for  the  poor  state  of  infrastructure  sectors  in  Indonesia. \nSupported  by  the  economic  boom  prior  to  the  crisis,  investment  decisions  prior  to  the  Asian \ncrisis  were  made  on  the  basis  of  political  connections  rather  than  being  a  clear  and  impartial \njudgment of the associated risks, benefits, and costs. As a result, the public sector absorbed a \ndisproportionate  share  of  the  risks.  In  addition,  no  concerted  effort  was  made  to  address  the \n\n                                                 \n2   World  Economic  Forum.  2006.

By  contrast,  Thailand  was \n\nranked 38, People\u2019s Republic of China was ranked 60, and Sri Lanka was ranked 76. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n  \n\nin \n\nthe \n\ntargets \n\nfollowing  ambitious  macroeconomic \n\nvarious  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  impediments  facing  the  infrastructure  sectors.  After  the \ncrisis,  Government  efforts  focused  on  risk  mitigation  by  renegotiating  and  canceling  major \ninfrastructure  contracts  signed  in  the  previous  years,  rather  than  on  removing  those \nimpediments.  \n \n  Following  Indonesia\u2019s  first  direct  presidential  elections  in  October  2004,  the  current \n10. \nGovernment  set \nits  medium-term \ndevelopment program (RPJM) to be achieved by the end of its term in 2009: (i) accelerate GDP \ngrowth from 4.5% in 2003 to 7.6% (for an annual average of 6.6%), (ii) increase the investment-\nGDP ratio from 20.5% in 2003 to 28.4%, (iii) reduce the unemployment rate from 9.7% in 2004 \nto  5.1%,  and  (iv)  halve  the  poverty  rate  from  16.6%  in  2004  to  8.2%.  From  the  outset,  the \nGovernment identified the acceleration of infrastructure development as essential for achieving \nthese  macroeconomic  targets,  and  gave  high  priority  to  increasing  access  to  infrastructure \nservices  and  improving  the  quality  of  these  services.  Since  it  was  obvious  that  the  estimated \ninvestment  requirements  would  far  exceed  the  available  public  sector  funding  (including \nmultilateral and bilateral aid), the Government called for major private sector participation (PSP) \nto bridge the gap. Public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs)\u2014contractual arrangements between the \npublic sector and a private sector company for the provision of an infrastructure service\u2014were \nchosen as the preferred approach for increasing PSP.  \n \n11. \n  In  early  2005,  the  Government  estimated  that  about  $145  billion  would  be  needed  for \ninfrastructure expansion during 2005\u20132009. In 2006, based on updated assessments and more \nrealistic  forecasts  of  potential  investment  flows,  the  estimate  was  revised  down  to  about  \n$65 billion, with $25 billion (38%) to come from the Government budget, $14 billion (22%) from \ndomestic  banks  and  insurance  and  pension  funds,  $10  billion  (15%)  from  multilateral  and \nbilateral development partners, and $16 billion (25%) from domestic and foreign private sector \ninvestors.  At  this  level,  infrastructure  investments  would  again  reach  about  5%\u20136%  of  GDP, \nconsidered to be the minimum required to restore pre-crisis levels of infrastructure provision and \nsupport the RPJM targets. \n \n12. \n  The Government has been aware of the urgent need to improve the investment climate \nthrough policy reforms that would (i) liberalize markets and allow competition from new entrants, \n(ii) strengthen regulatory arrangements, (iii) introduce tariff regimes based on full cost recovery \nor provide compensation to meet public service obligations (PSOs), and (iv) establish effective \nmechanisms  for  dispute  resolution.  At  the  Indonesia  Infrastructure  Summit  (IIS)  in  Jakarta  in \nJanuary  2005,  President  Susilo  Bambang  Yudhoyono  led  high-level  Government  officials  in \nexpressing  the  political  will  to  accelerate  infrastructure  development  and  proceed  with  the \nnecessary  reforms.  At  the  subsequent  Indonesia  Infrastructure  Conference  and  Exhibition  in \nNovember 2006, this commitment was reiterated, and a number of reforms were presented that \nestablished the policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for PPPs.  \n \nAt  the  Consultative  Group  on  Indonesia  meeting  in  January  2005,  the  Government \n13. \nasked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  medium-term  support  for  infrastructure \nreforms and thereby help implement the RPJM. This request led to an intensification of ADB\u2019s \npolicy  dialogue  with  the  Government  and  other  development  partners.  For  the  IIS,  the  three \nprincipal funding agencies\u2014ADB, the Japan International Cooperation Agency3 (JICA), and the \nWorld  Bank\u2014jointly  prepared  six  policy  briefs  on  issues  and  constraints  facing  the  main \ninfrastructure sectors, and on reforms needed to address these. Subsequently, in May 2005 the \ngovernments of Indonesia and Japan jointly adopted the strategic investment action plan, which \nincluded many infrastructure-related measures, to improve the investment climate. Building on \n                                                 \n3 Prior to October 2008, all discussions related to IRSDP  were in conjunction  with the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC). For purposes of consistency, JBIC is now referred to as JICA in this RRP in line with the new \nstructure. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nthese  efforts,  the  Government  took  a  range  of  critical  steps  to  set  the  pace  for  reforms.  In \nFebruary  2006,  it  released  the  infrastructure  policy  package  listing  50  actions  completed  in \n2005, and 153 actions to be implemented during 2006. This was followed by the formulation of \nthe  IRSDP  by  the  Government  and  the  three  funding  agencies,  using  the  infrastructure  policy \npackage as the starting point and expanding the reforms until 2010. In February 2007, a further \npolicy package was released by the Government in the form of presidential instruction 6/2007, \ncovering  reforms  planned  until  the  end  of  2007  in  six  areas  including  infrastructure.  Finally, \npresidential instruction 5/2008, released in May 2008, has detailed reform actions and physical \nprojects to be completed during 2008\u20132009 in eight areas including infrastructure.  \n \nAs  part  of  the  discussions  on  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program,4  the  Government \n14. \nasked ADB to work towards a credible medium-term commitment of resources to support one of \nthe proposed five main areas of engagement, namely, infrastructure and infrastructure services. \nThis has been further reinforced in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan5 for 2009\u20132011. The \nIRSDP structure as a 6-year program cluster was chosen to provide an overall umbrella for that \nkind of commitment.  \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nIssues \n\n15.  All  sectors  lag  behind  Indonesia\u2019s  neighbors  in  terms  of  service  coverage,  and  their \ninvestment requirements are much higher than the public sector can mobilize on its own. This \nunderlines  the  need  for  prioritization,  so  that  public  sector  resources  are  used  for  basic \ninfrastructure such as rural roads, rural electrification, and water supply and sanitation in rural \nand  low-income  urban  areas,  i.e.,  interventions  of  a  noncommercial  nature  that  have  a  strong \nimpact  on  poverty  reduction.  Financing  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  partners \nshould also be used for this purpose. The development partners also play an important role in \nassisting the Government to create an attractive environment for greater PSP, which is crucial \nfor meeting the massive investment requirements, and in attracting private sector investment for \ncommercially viable PPP projects. The IRSDP is helping Indonesia realize the potential for PSP \nand  leverage  public  sector  resources  to  reduce  service  coverage  gaps  by  removing  the \nimpediments and constraints described in Section 2 below and in Appendix 2.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Impediments \n\n16. \nInadequate  Cross-Sector  Framework  for  Private  Sector  Participation.  To  revive \nprivate  investments  in  infrastructure,  an  effective  legal  framework  is  critical.  The  presidential \ndecree issued in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis did not fulfill this purpose.6 Although \nit  defined  PSP  and  called  for  the  selection  of  private  sector  sponsors  through  open  and \ntransparent tendering, the decree adopted a simplistic approach and left many critical questions \nunanswered on PPP scope, implementation, performance norms, tariffs, and dispute resolution. \nIn  the  absence  of  an  overall  infrastructure  law,  a  replacement  of  this  decree  by  presidential \nregulation 67/2005 has been considered the best way to provide an adequate legal framework.  \n \nlegal  and \n17. \nregulatory framework in Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure sectors is complex. Each sector has its own \nlaw,  and  the  division  of  responsibilities  for  the  five  principal  functions\u2014policy  making,  sector \nplanning,  regulation,  contracting,  and  operating\u2014differs  greatly.  While  the  line  ministries  in \n\nComplex  Sector-Specific  Legal  and  Regulatory  Framework.  The \n\n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2006.

In  other  cases,  they  have  partly  or  fully \ndelegated  this  responsibility  to  recently  established  regulatory  bodies,  but  these  are  only \nnominally autonomous as they still report to the minister and are funded from the line ministry \nbudget.  In  some  cases,  the  regulatory  bodies  also  have  contracting  functions.  In  other  cases, \nthe  contracting  function  is  undertaken  by  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  which  have  a \npervasive  role  across  all  the  sectors  and  dominate  sea  and  air  transportation,  railways,  and \npower. Private enterprises have to compete with these well-established SOEs on a playing field \nthat is not even. The plethora of agencies involved and their complex interrelationships in sector \nfunctions  have  stymied  reforms  and  made  coordination  difficult.  Three  issues  need  to  be \naddressed: (i) the appropriate role of the Government and SOEs in the policy making, planning, \nregulatory,  contracting,  and  operating  functions,  (ii)  the  need  for  measures  to  make  the \nregulators independent, and (iii) the need for equal opportunities for private sector operators. \n \n\n3. \n\nResource Constraints Impeding Public and Private Investments \n\n18. \nLack of Focus on and Resources for Project Preparation. An important prerequisite \nfor PSP is adequacy and consistency of information needed for investment decisions. This has \nbeen  constrained  by  lack  of  resources  for  sector  planning,  and  line  ministries  and  contracting \nagencies not focusing on project preparation. Before the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia had a \nwell-established  system  for  preparing  annual  and  medium-term  sector  plans  that  identified \ntargets  for  infrastructure  provision  and  developed  investment  plans  for  achieving  the  targets. \nHowever, due to lack of resources for plan preparation\u2014and, more importantly, for actual public \ninvestment  in  infrastructure\u2014planning  capacity  in  some  sectors  has  been  eroded.  Sector \ndevelopment  plans  describing  long-term  physical  expansion,  and  sector  blueprints  outlining  a \nlong-term  vision  in  terms  of  restructuring  and  competition,  are  an  essential  element  in \ninvestment decisions. To prepare and regularly update such plans and blueprints, the planning \nfunctions and capacity of line ministries need to be strengthened in accordance with the gradual \nshift in the role of the Government from service provider to policy maker, planner, coordinator, \nand facilitator. Lack of capacity and resources and the absence of a systematic process have \nalso  led  to  lack  of  attention  to  project  preparation.  While  the  budget  system  does  allow  line \nministries  and  agencies  to  obtain  some  resources  for  preparing  feasibility  studies,  the \nwidespread  view  is  that,  for  PPP  projects,  this  work  should  be  done  by  the  private  sector \nsponsors.  Once  projects  are  identified  and  some  preparation  done,  the  critical  steps  of \nprocurement  and  transaction  execution  also  generally  suffer  from  resource  constraints.  Given \nthe high degree of autonomy of line ministries, strong central coordination is needed to ensure a \nconsistent approach to PSP across infrastructure sectors and efficient use of available funds. \n \n19. \n  Lack  of  a  Sound  Risk  Management  Framework.  In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s, \nunsolicited  project  proposals  from  politically  connected  private  sector  parties  created  large \npublic  sector  liabilities,  particularly  in  the  power  sector,  that  were  highlighted  by  the  1997 \nfinancial  crisis.  The  subsequent  administrations  therefore  became  reluctant  to  offer  support  to \nprivate  sector  investors.  More  recently,  the  Government  has  recognized  the  importance  of \nadequate  risk  mitigation  and  sharing  to  attract  major  PSP.  A  sound  investment  climate, \nsupported  by  reduced  investor  perception  of  corruption,  would  be  the  best  risk  mitigation \nmechanism.  This  would  entail  continuous  and  sustained  policy  reforms  that  lead  to  a  stable \nmacroeconomic  environment,  well-functioning  judicial  system,  independent  and  technically \nsound  regulation,  full  cost  recovery  in  infrastructure  services  (or  a  well-targeted  output-based \nsubsidy where the full cost recovery would make such services unaffordable), and open access \nin the infrastructure sectors. During the transition before these ideal conditions are achieved and \n                                                 \n7  The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources for oil, gas, and power; Ministry of Public Works for roads and water \nsupply and sanitation; Ministry of Transportation for ports, airports, and railways; and Ministry of Communications \nand Informatics for telecommunications. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\nconfidence fully restored, private investors will ask for Government support to help mitigate risks \nthat  are  not  under  their  control.  The  principal  lesson  is  that  the  previous  practice  of  blanket \nguarantees should not be repeated. The various risks in each sector and for each project type \nneed  to  be  identified,  and  then  allocated  to  the  participant  that  can  best  control  them.  No \nuniversal  solution  is  applicable  to  all  situations,  and  the  range  of  possible  solutions  is  wide, \ndepending on the specific circumstances of each case. The provision of adequate resources to \nSOEs to fulfill their PSOs is one way of mitigating the potential default risk of those entities. The \nother  important  lesson  is  that  risk  allocation  should  not  be  rigid.  Risks  should  gradually  be \ntransferred  from  the  public  sector  to  private  investors  as  conditions  improve,  until  market \ninstruments rather than government guarantees can be used for risk hedging. \n \n20. \nInadequate Cost Recovery. Given the multiplicity of agencies involved, and with SOEs \nplaying  a  key  role  in  many  sectors,  tariffs  for  infrastructure  services  are  usually  administered. \nMost notably for power, oil and gas, and air transport, national or local parliamentary approval or \npresidential regulations with parliamentary consensus are needed for tariff increases. Despite a \nseries of increases in electricity tariffs, domestic oil prices, and transportation tariffs since 2000, \nfull  cost  recovery  has  not  yet  been  achieved,  mainly  because  of  escalating  international  oil \nprices.  Adopting  the  full  cost  recovery  principle  is  essential  to  encouraging  greater  PSP  and \nenhancing efficiency in the allocation of resources. At the same time, the ability of the poor to \npay for infrastructure services needs to be considered. \n \n  Failure  to  Achieve  Equity  and  Efficiency  in  Public  Service  Obligations.  Full  cost \n21. \nrecovery can only be achieved gradually. Even in the long term, low-income customers may not \nbe able to pay the required tariffs for infrastructure services, and there are limitations on cross \nsubsidization by more affluent customer categories. The current situation differs from sector to \nsector,  with no  uniform  PSO  approach.  Loss-making  port  and  airport  facilities  are  either  cross \nsubsidized  in  SOE  portfolios  or  are  left  to  line  ministries  to  operate  and  finance  from  their \nbudget.  In  the  power  sector,  the  State  Electricity  Corporation  (PLN)  receives  a  huge  annual \nsubsidy  from  the  Government  budget,  as  the  current  electricity  tariffs are  below  PLN\u2019s  cost  of \nsupply  in  all  consumer  categories.  Low  tariffs  for  water  supply  result  in  the  poor  financial \ncondition  and  high  indebtedness  of  the  regional  water  supply  enterprises  (PDAMs)  that  are \nowned by local governments. The Government also provides annual subsidies for the so-called \npioneer  services  in  bus,  railway,  ship,  and  air  transport.  In  the  telecommunications  sector,  a \nportion  of  revenues  of  private  companies  is  retained  for  subsidized  rural  services.  To  achieve \ngreater PSP and higher efficiencies in PSO provision, a consistent cross-sector PSO framework \nis  needed.  While  the  public  sector  will  continue  to  have  an  important  role  in  delivering  many \nnoncommercial  services,  innovative  approaches  allowing  PSP  could  include  output-based  aid \nthat is explicit, targeted, and driven by the service provider\u2019s performance.  \n \n22. \n  Shallow  Domestic  Financing  Modalities.  Banking  plays  a  dominant  role  within  the \nfinancial  system.  Capital  markets  have  grown  in  importance,  but  long-term  debt  issuance  has \nuntil  recently  been  limited  to  government  bonds.  The  issuance  of  corporate  bonds  has  been \ngradually growing, but only a small portion originates from SOEs operating in the infrastructure \nsectors.  On  the  supply  side,  contractual  savings  institutions  such  as  pension  and  insurance \ncompanies  have  traditionally  invested  predominantly  in  government  bonds  or  bank  deposits. \nWhile the Government estimates that domestic financial institutions can meet about 20% of the \ninfrastructure  funding  requirements,  concerted  reforms  are  needed  to  help  mobilize  domestic \nresources of this magnitude. Domestic financing would help reduce the currency mismatch and \nthe extent of government guarantees for PPP projects. The Government needs to facilitate the \ndevelopment of local financial and capital markets by (i) enabling insurance firms and pension \nfunds to finance infrastructure, (ii) deepening the bond market, (iii) setting up sound credit-rating \nagencies, (iv) establishing dedicated infrastructure funds, and (v) allowing regional governments \nto borrow for infrastructure in local markets. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n  \n\n4. \n\nOther Constraints Impeding Infrastructure Development \n\n23. \n  Weak  Legal,  Regulatory,  and  Implementation  Framework  for  Land  Acquisition. \nLand  acquisition  problems  have  impeded  a  number  of  infrastructure  projects,  particularly  toll \nroads. Until 2005, land acquisition was governed by the old Basic Agrarian Law and presidential \nregulation 55/1993 on Land Acquisition for Public Infrastructure. While providing a legal basis, \nthese documents failed to balance the need to protect social safeguards with regard to the need \nfor  expeditious  provision  of  land  or  right-of-way  access  for  infrastructure  development.  As  the \ncost  of  land  is  generally  high,  an  effective  mechanism  to  finance  land  acquisition  in  a  timely \nmanner  and  prevent  speculation  is  essential.  In  many  countries,  land  acquisition  for  large \ninfrastructure PPP projects is done by the public sector as its contribution to project investment \ncosts.  \n \n  Lack  of  Clarity  Due  to  Regional  Autonomy.  Decentralization,  while  devolving \n24. \nconsiderable authority and autonomy to local governments, has complicated matters related to \ninfrastructure  development.  Until  recently,  responsibility  for  the  provision  of  infrastructure \nservices  and  the  role  of  local-government-owned  enterprises  (BUMDs)  has  not  been  clearly \narticulated.  Local  governments,  with  control  over  local  infrastructure,  have  not  been  provided \nwith adequate funds and most lack the necessary capacity.  \n \n25. \n  Safety,  Security,  and  Asset  Maintenance.  Access  and  connectivity  are  vital  in  the \nIndonesian  archipelago.  Adherence  to  safety  and  security  standards  for  various  modes  of \ntransportation  is  equally  critical.  The  Government  recently  began  adopting  safety  and  security \nnorms,  and  establishing \nthe  road  sector, \nmaintenance  gets  varying  levels  of  attention  across  the  country,  with  national  and  provincial \nroads  reasonably  well  preserved  but  district  and  urban  roads  in  poor  condition  due  to  gross \nunderspending  on  maintenance.  Safety  norms  for  road  use  and  vehicle  overloading  are  only \nslowly emerging, and enforcement is weak. Safety is also an issue for air and sea transportation \ndue  to  disparities  in  the  adoption  of  safety  norms  across  the  country  and  ineffective \nenforcement.  \n \n\ninstitutional  mechanisms. \n\nthe  necessary \n\nIn \n\n5. \n\nSummary of Constraints and Impediments \n\n  Poor  Governance  and  Resource  Constraints.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  1997  financial \n26. \ncrisis,  four  facets  of  governance  that  impede  infrastructure  development  have  emerged:  (i) \nabsence of sound PSP policies and framework, (ii) opaqueness in tendering, and corruption and \nrent-seeking  during  implementation  affecting  both  public  and  private  sectors,  (iii)  inequality  in \naccess  to  opportunities  by  the  public  and  private  sector,  and  (iv)  weak  cross-sector \ncoordination.  The  impact  of  poor  governance  has  been  aggravated  by  the  following  fiscal  and \nother resource-related impediments affecting public and private investments in infrastructure: (i) \ndeclining  institutional  capacity  for  sector  planning,  (ii)  lack  of  focus  on,  and  inadequate \nresources  allocated  to,  project  preparation,  (iii)  lack  of  risk  sharing,  (iv)  lack  of  cost  recovery, \nwhich threatens the financial viability of projects, (v) inability of the public sector to finance land \nacquisition, and (vi) lack of long-term financial intermediation. Appendix 3 shows links between \nthe various constraints and impediments addressed by the IRSDP.  \n \n\n6. \n\nLessons  \n\n \n\n27. \nIn terms of lending modalities, the Government has shown strong preference for policy-\nbased  budget  support.  ADB  has  responded  to  this  preference.  During  2005\u20132007,  program \nloans accounted for $2.0 billion, or over 70%, of ADB\u2019s total lending commitments of about $2.8 \nbillion.  At  this  magnitude,  it  has  been  imperative  that  lessons  borne  out  by  past  operations  of \nthis type be taken into account. The role of program lending as a vehicle for economic growth \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nand  poverty  reduction  was  examined  in  several  studies,8  leading  to  the  following  principal \nconclusions and recommendations: (i) policy frameworks were often complex and unrealistic, (ii) \na  high  degree  of  formal  compliance  with  conditions  did  not  necessarily  lead  to  high-quality \ncompliance  in  terms  of  reform  implementation  and  sustainability,  (iii)  political  economy  factors \nsuch  as  the  commitment  to  (and  timing  of)  reforms,  the  extent  of  the  underlying  problems, \nappreciation by the public of the seriousness of these problems, and length of the government \nterm, were critical, (iv) broader stakeholder participation was vital to obtain adequate buy-in and \nmitigate vested interests, (v) mere adoption of policies and passage of laws was not enough\u2014\ntheir  implementation  was  equally  important,  (vi)  policy  measures  should  focus  on  the  main \nobjectives  of  the  program,  and  each  action  should  be  specific  and  directly  related  to  the \nobjectives,  (vii)  to  provide  the  necessary  flexibility,  program  design  should  allow  not  only  the \nstandard multitranche operations, but also options with a single tranche, floating tranches, and a \nprogram cluster, (viii) reforms should be phased in and fully aligned with the country\u2019s broader \nmedium-term development agenda, and (ix) funding agencies should harmonize and coordinate \ntheir policy advice and operations. \n\n \n\n28. \nA  program  cluster  modality  with  three  single-tranche  subprograms  anchored  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s  medium-term  reform  agenda  (RPJM)  has  been  adopted  since  the  start  of  the \nIRSDP  series.  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  single-tranche  program  loans  in  Indonesia  has  been \neffective,  as  the  loan  disbursement  is  based  on  a  range  of  up-front  actions  taken  by  the \nGovernment  in  the  core  areas  of  infrastructure.  This  approach  provides  the  flexibility  to  an \nemerging middle-income country such as Indonesia to build consensus for reforms resulting in a \nnatural progression from actions to desired outcomes.   \n \n29.  With  one  exception,  the  above  lessons  and  recommendations  have  been  reflected  in \nthe IRSDP design and implementation. Because of the wide range of infrastructure sectors and \nthe need to cover several thematic areas in each of them, it has not been possible to design a \nsimple  policy  matrix  that  would  ensure  the  desired  outcome  of  increasing  infrastructure \ninvestments to 6%\u20137% of GDP. Incorporating the other lessons, the IRSDP supports the RPJM, \nits policy-based component is anchored on the Government\u2019s Infrastructure Policy Package to \nensure strong ownership, and it has been formulated and implemented in close cooperation with \nJICA and the World Bank. The general public experiences the infrastructure bottlenecks and the \npoor  quality  of  infrastructure  services  on  a  daily  basis.  Consequently,  the  majority  of  people \nsupport  the  reforms,  as  demonstrated  by  their  acceptance  of  the  steep  oil  price  increases  in \n2005  and  2008.  Nevertheless,  the  reform  agenda  is  broad  and  challenging  as  it  covers  all \ninfrastructure sectors, and some vested interests oppose parts of it.  \n \n  To  allow  the  necessary  flexibility  in  reform  implementation,  the  program  cluster  model \n30. \nconsisting  of  three  single-tranche  subprograms  has  been  adopted  for  the  IRSDP.  The \nsuccessful implementation of subprograms 1 and 2 has confirmed the advantages of this model. \nDespite  its  large  scope  and  complexity,  the  IRSDP  has  proven  to  be  manageable  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s ownership of it remains strong. This has been attributable to the fact that, unlike \nmultitranche programs that provide an incentive to implement agreed future reforms in several \nstages  within  a  predetermined  time  frame,  single-tranche  programs  provide  an  incentive  for \nagreed  completed  reforms.  This  structure  removes  the  rigidity  of  firm  deadlines  for  actions \noutside the Government\u2019s control, such as legislative approvals, and helps deflect criticisms that \nthe  reforms  are  a  result  of  external  pressure.  The  subprogram  2  and  3  loans  have  been \nsubmitted to ADB\u2019s Board for approval only after the agreed actions had been completed (rather \nthan  up  front  as  in  the  case  of  the  second  and  third  tranches  of  multitranche  programs).  The \nreform  agenda  and  its  timing  have  been  periodically  reviewed  in  light  of  the  actual \n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2001.

Given  the  importance  of  infrastructure \nreforms for the RPJM, in early 2006 the Government asked the Government of Japan and the \nWorld  Bank  to  cofinance  the  IRSDP.  The  former  responded  positively  and  JICA  actively \nparticipated  in  all  processing  missions  in  2006.  As  the  infrastructure-related  elements  of  the \nstrategic investment action plan (para. 13) were incorporated in the IRSDP, the Government of \nJapan  adopted  its  policy  matrix  and  approved  cofinancing  of  $100  million  in  March  2007,  4 \nmonths after ADB\u2019s approval of the $400 million loan for subprogram 1. For programming and \nother  reasons,  the  World  Bank  was  unable  to  process  its  contribution  in  2006,  but  its  staff \nparticipated as observers in the ADB\u2013JICA missions and made a number of useful suggestions \nthat  were  incorporated  into  the  IRSDP  policy  matrix.  Processing  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nInfrastructure  Development  Policy  Loan  (IDPL)  took  place  1  year  later  and  was  completed  by \nthe approval of the $200 million IDPL 1 in December 2007. The design and implementation of \nthe  IRSDP  reform  measures  have  greatly  benefited  from  the  close  cooperation  of  the  three \ninstitutions. \n \n  For  the  second-stage  operations  in  2008,  the  processing  of  the  subprogram  2  loans \n32. \nfrom  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Japan  has  been  synchronized  with  that  of  IDPL  2.  A  joint \nreview of the status of reforms was undertaken in April 2008. Board consideration by the World \nBank will take place in December 2008 and by the Government of Japan in March 2009. \n \n33. \nTechnical  assistance  (TA)  support  for  capacity  development,  risk  management,  and \npreparation of PPP projects has been provided in a similarly coordinated way. In 2004 the World \nBank  approved  a  $16.5  million  loan  for  the  Private  Provision  of  Infrastructure  Technical \nAssistance,  while  1  year  later  ADB  provided  a  $2  million  TA  grant  as  the  precursor  to  the \nIRSDP.9  To  avoid  any  duplication  of  work,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  support  has  been  directed  at  the \nCoordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  (CMEA),  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW),  and \nMinistry of Transportation (MOT), while ADB has supported the National Development Planning \nAgency  (BAPPENAS).  There  has  also  been  a  clear  delineation  of  areas  of  support  in  ADB\u2019s \nfollow-up  TA  under  the  third  component  of  the  IRSDP  (para.  39).  Appendix  4  contains  the \ndevelopment partner coordination matrix, outlining support in areas related to the IRSDP. \n \n\n8. \n\nRationale and Linkage with Other ADB Assistance \n\n34. \n  The IRSDP design and implementation have been closely coordinated with ongoing and \nplanned ADB programs and projects. It is consistent with ADB\u2019s CSP for 2006\u20132009, which is \nanchored on support for the RPJM. The CSP adopts a dual-track approach to ensure that cross-\ncutting  macroeconomic  and  governance  reforms  complement,  and  are  reinforced  by,  sector \nreforms. Appendix 5 presents this approach of providing support through (i) participation in the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  Development  Policy  Loan  (DPL)  series  to  strengthen  the  macroeconomic  and \nfiscal  framework  while  addressing  cross-cutting  issues  such  as  governance,  and  (ii)  sector-\nspecific  policy  interventions  in  the  areas  of  infrastructure,  financial  markets,  local  government \nfinance, and poverty reduction, and accelerated progress towards the Millennium Development \nGoals.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Support for Infrastructure Development. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n35. \n  ADB  has  adopted  a  holistic  approach  to  supporting  infrastructure  development  in \nIndonesia.  Complementing  the  IRSDP  in  improving  the  overall  investment  climate  are  ADB\u2019s \nDPSP  program,  while  the  deepening  of  capital  markets  is  covered  by  ADB\u2019s  capital  market \ndevelopment  program10.  Project  preparation  and  the  related  institutional  and  capacity \ndevelopment are supported by the project development facility (PDF) and associated TA (para. \n39).  Finally,  the  support  extends  to  infrastructure  finance  in  the  form  of  assistance  through \nsupport  to  Bank  Mandiri  for  long-term  infrastructure  funding,  and  to  nonbanking  financial \ninstitutions, through establishment and capitalization of the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing \nFacility (IIFF) (para. 53). \n \n36. \n  The CSP envisages stronger support for private sector development through a close link \nbetween  ADB\u2019s  public  and  private  sector  operations.  The  IRSDP  focuses  on  PSP  and  is  well \naligned with ADB\u2019s growing private sector operations in Indonesia.11 Conversely, lessons from \nthe  design  and  implementation  of  private  sector  projects  are  fed  into  reforms  covered  by  the \nIRSDP  that  enhance  project  sustainability  by  strengthening  the  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory \nframework,  particularly  in  the  power,  toll  road,  and  gas  sectors.  The  IIFF  is  an  example  of  a \ndirect outcome of these reforms. \n \n37. \n  The IRSDP, which focuses on facilitating medium- and large-scale PPP projects at the \nnational and local government levels, is balanced by ADB\u2019s support for small community-driven \ninfrastructure projects in rural areas.12 \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n38. \n  By  enhancing  infrastructure  provision  and  access,  the  IRSDP  aims  to  improve  the \ninvestment  climate  in  Indonesia  and  support  timely  realization  of  the  Government\u2019s  medium-\nterm macroeconomic goals articulated in the RPJM, in particular achieving average annual GDP \ngrowth of 6%\u20137% during 2005\u20132009 and sustaining such growth thereafter. This will enable the \nGovernment to reduce poverty and boost job creation. The expected outcome of the IRSDP is \naccelerated  infrastructure  development  through  major  PSP  and  mobilization  and  allocation  of \nadditional public sector resources. Appendix 6 presents the Government\u2019s letter of development \npolicy,  which  reiterates  its  commitment  to  infrastructure  reforms,  along  with  updated  policy \nmatrixes for the IRSDP and IDPL, which detail these parallel operations and show their current \nstatus. \n \nB. \n\nScope \n\n39. \nThe IRSDP cluster concept and the following IRSDP components were approved by the \nADB  Board  in  November  2006.

In August 2006, ADB approved a $75 million loan for the \nSouth  Sumatra\u2013West  Java  Gas  Pipeline  Project,  and  in  August  2007  approved  a  rupiah-denominated  loan \nequivalent to $50 million for the West Java Water Supply Development Project. \n\n12  ADB.  2005.

It  is \nhelping the Government prepare feasibility studies for national and local PPP projects, adopt an \nopen  and  transparent  tendering  process,  and  execute  project  transactions  up  to  the  stage  of \nfinancial  closure.  The  consulting  services  financed  under  the  PDF  through  the  combination  of \nthe  ADF  loan  and  Dutch  grant  also  assist  in  overall  PPP  project  promotion  and  the  related \ncapacity  building  at  the  central  and  local  government  level.  The  TA  focuses  on  effective \nimplementation  of  the new  risk-management  framework,  capacity  building  for  establishing  and \nmanaging  the  IIFF,  effective  communication  and  social  marketing  of  the  reform  agenda  to  a \nwide range of stakeholders, and start-up activities for the PDF.   \n \nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\n41. \nThe  IRSDP  has  a  number  of  important  features.  First,  its  overall  design  is  fully  in  line \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  development  growth  vision,  as  articulated  in  the  RPJM, \nand  the  Government\u2019s  infrastructure  reform  agenda,  as  formulated  in  the  infrastructure  policy \npackage. Second, designed as a program cluster consisting of three subprograms, the IRSDP \nprovides  the  necessary  flexibility  to  an  emerging  middle-income  country  like  Indonesia  that  is \ngoing  through  democratic  and  political  transition  for  it  to  build  consensus  for  reforms  among \nstakeholders with competing interests. It also ensures continuity of reforms resulting in a natural \nprogression from actions to desired outcomes. \n  \nThird,  the  IRSDP  helps  address  investment  climate  impediments,  a  major  area  of \n42. \nconcern  in  Indonesia.  The  IRSDP\u2019s  focus  on  accelerating  infrastructure  provision  will  in  turn \npromote  and  facilitate  other  investments  in  other  sectors.  Several  surveys  show  that  the \ninadequate  provision  and  poor  quality  of  infrastructure  services,  and  disparities  in  service \ncoverage, are major impediments to increasing domestic and foreign investments in Indonesia. \nFulfilling  PSOs  is  a  key  cross-cutting  area  that  has  an  indirect  impact  in  terms  of  attracting \ninvestments  in  the  future.  As  the  Indonesian  economy  grows  and  investments  increase,  the \nwidespread  disparities  in  development  across  the  country  must  be  addressed.  Reducing \npotential  discontent  among  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable  segments  of  the  population  is \nparticularly relevant in underserved areas with significant natural resource potential. Fourth, in a \nthematic  sense,  the  principal  focus  of  the  IRSDP  is  to  strengthen  governance  and  alleviate \nresource constraints in infrastructure provision. Box 1 highlights the focus on governance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Program Cluster, \nLoans,  Technical  Assistance  Grant,  and  Administration  of  Grant  from  the  Government  of  Netherlands  to  the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\n \nBox 1: Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program Focus on Governance in \nInfrastructure Provision \n\n \nThe  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  is  a  comprehensive  medium-term  reform \nprogram that addresses a range of issues aimed at widespread adoption of good governance. The \nProgram supports the formulation and/or adoption of the following:  \n \n\n\u2022  A legal and regulatory framework that provides for transparent and competitive tendering to \n\nselect private sector partners, even for unsolicited proposals. \n\n\u2022  A risk-sharing framework which focuses on project quality and transparency in deciding on \nthe  type  and amount  of  Government  support,  stipulates  that  such  support can  be  provided \nonly if indicated in the bidding documents, and ensures that the overall level of Government \nsupport is in line with sound fiscal management. \n\n\u2022  Gradual  dismantling  of  state-owned  enterprise  monopolies  and  creation  of  a  level  playing \n\nfield in as many infrastructure sectors as feasible.  \n\n\u2022  Sector-specific  measures  to  deal  with  corruption,  such  as  adoption  of  standard  bidding \n\ndocuments and e-procurement in the road sector.  \n\n\u2022  Preparation and transaction execution in a transparent and competitive manner for \nthe model public\u2013private partnership projects to demonstrate the merits of the new \nprivate sector participation and risk-management frameworks. \n\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n \n \n43. \n  Finally, there are close links between the IRSDP as formulated in 2005 and the IDPL as \ndesigned  2  years  later.  While  the  IRSDP  covers  a  broad  range  of  reforms,  the  World  Bank\u2019s \ndevelopment  policy  loan  model  allows  only  a  limited  number  of  triggers.  The  World  Bank  has \ntherefore  focused  on  a  small  subset  of  high-priority  reforms  in  the  areas  of  national  public \ninfrastructure,  subnational  government  infrastructure,  private  infrastructure  investment,  and \ncross-cutting  infrastructure  governance  issues.  The  separate  interventions  complement  each \nother, with the ADB and Japanese IRSDP loan series helping maintain momentum across the \nbreadth  of  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda,  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  IDPL  series  ensuring \nheightened attention to the most critical reforms. In identifying a more limited set of triggers, the \nWorld Bank supports reform elements that either reinforce the IRSDP policy matrix or expand it. \nThere  has  been  close  coordination  between  the  three  development  partners  to  ensure \nconsistent messages are given to the Government. \n \nD. \n\nPolicy Reforms \n\n1. \n\nReform Framework and Objectives \n\n  The IRSDP policy framework is founded on three reform pillars:  \n\n44. \n \n\n(i) \n\nStrategic cross-sector reforms will result in \n(a) \n\nan  improved  policy,  legal,  and institutional  framework  for  PSP  anchored \non good-governance principles; \nan  improved  coordination  mechanism  for  ministries  and  agencies \ninvolved in infrastructure development; \na well-structured risk management framework that promotes PSP;  \n\n(b) \n\n(c)  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n  \n\naccelerated  mobilization  of  domestic  long-term  financial  resources  for \ninfrastructure  development  and  establishment  of  innovative  funding \nmechanisms for PPP projects; and \na  streamlined \nframework,  clearly  delineating \nfunctional  responsibilities  of  the  national  and  local  governments  in \ninfrastructure provision. \n\nregional  autonomy \n\n(ii) \n\nSector-specific policy, legal, and institutional reforms covering eight infrastructure \nsectors14 will lead to   \n\nbetter sector planning and project preparation; \nimproved financial soundness and sustainability of infrastructure services \nthrough full cost recovery; \ngreater  competition  that  benefits  consumers  through  improved  service \ndelivery and lower tariffs; \nindependent  regulatory  structures  that  are  distinct  from  the  contracting \nand operating functions; \nequal  access  and  opportunities  for  all  participants  and  prevention  of \nabuse of natural monopoly rights; and \nfulfillment  of  the  PSO  in  infrastructure  provision  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction objectives.  \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(a) \n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(iii) \n\nFacilitation of the preparation and execution of well-structured PPP transactions \nwill result in sound model infrastructure projects that can be replicated. \n\n \n  Table  2  highlights  key  actual  and  expected  outputs  and  outcomes  of  the  IRSDP.

Under subprogram 1, the \nGovernment  issued  presidential  regulation  67/2005  on  Cooperation  between  the  Government \nand  Business  Entities  in  the  Provision  of  Infrastructure  to  establish  a  clear  and  predictable \nenvironment  within  which  private  investors  would  operate.  Presidential  regulation  67/2005 \ndefined two forms of PSP, namely, partnership and licensing agreements. PPP projects can be \nidentified and prepared either by the Government or the private sector, but the sponsors must \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n  \n\n \n\nbe selected through open and transparent tendering. Tariffs should be set at full cost-recovery \nlevel. If this exceeds the ability of consumers to pay, the Government must compensate for the \ndifference  with  a  PSO  subsidy.  Risks  should  be  allocated  to  the  party  that  is  best  able  to \nmanage and control them. \n \n47.  With these principles, presidential regulation 67/2005 has proved to be a cornerstone of \ninfrastructure  reforms.  However,  during  its  implementation  under  subprogram  2,  the  lack  of \nclarity in some provisions and gaps in others has become evident. Through the TA (footnote 9), \nADB  has  therefore  supported  the  revision  of  clauses  related  to  the  definition  of  contracting \nagency, form and scope of Government support, definition of financial closure, responsibility for \npublic  consultations,  role  of  local  governments,  and  number  of  re-bidding  rounds.  There  have \nalso been proposals to amend the procedure and rules for selecting private sector partners, in \nthe belief that it would expedite transaction execution. To avoid diluting the principles of project \nquality,  transparency,  and  competition,  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  held  intensive  policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government  such  that  the  revision  of  presidential  regulation  67/2005  will \nmaintain the fundamental principles. \n \nInstitutional  and  Coordination  Arrangements  for  Private  Sector  Participation. \n48. \nPresidential  regulation 42/2005  enhanced  the ability  of  the  interministerial  National  Committee \nfor  the  Acceleration  of  Infrastructure  Provision  (KKPPI)15  to  fulfill  its  role  in  (i)  formulating \ninfrastructure  strategies  and  policies,  (ii)  coordinating  and  supervising  their  implementation  by \nthe line ministries and local governments, (iii) formulating PSO policy for infrastructure services, \nand (iv) solving problems that impede infrastructure development, in particular PPP projects. To \nensure  effective  functioning  of  KKPPI,  its  secretariat,  headed  by  the  deputy  minister  for \ninfrastructure  and  regional  development  in  CMEA  (in  charge  of  administrative  matters  and \nstakeholder  consultations)  and  the  deputy  minister  for  infrastructure  affairs  in  BAPPENAS  (in \ncharge of technical matters), needed sustained capacity building and advisory support. \n \n49. \n  For  about  2  years  under  subprogram  2,  ADB  provided  the  required  support  to  the \nBAPPENAS  part  of  the  KKPPI  secretariat  through  TA  (footnote  9),  while  the  CMEA  part  has \nbeen  supported  by  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Private  Provision  of  Infrastructure  Technical  Assistance \nloan. Coordination of the two parts has been improved by (i) the creation of the positions of an \nexecutive secretary and administrative manager filled by nongovernment staff who reviewed the \nstructure  and  operations  of  the  KKPPI  secretariat,  (ii)  the  demarcation  of  responsibilities \nbetween BAPPENAS and CMEA, and (iii) the work program for KKPPI. Based on this review, a \nnumber of measures related to institutional arrangements, standard operating procedures, and \npriority agenda for KKPPI are being taken. These efforts have borne fruit, as evidenced by the \nmore proactive role played by KKPPI and its secretariat. For the future day-to-day coordination \nand  management  of  PPP  transactions  as  their  number  increases,  a  network  consisting  of  a \ncentral  PPP  unit  under  the  KKPPI  secretariat  and  PPP  nodes  in  the  line  ministries  has  been \npartly developed. There are already PPP nodes in some line ministries that are responsible for \nproject  preparation  and  transaction  execution.  The  network  will  be  completed  and  become \noperational under subprogram 3. \n \n50. \n  Risk  Management  Framework.  In  view  of  the  links  to  its  existing  budgeting,  fiscal \naccounting,  and  debt  management  systems,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  played  an \nimportant role in developing and implementing this framework as an instrument for  assessing, \npricing, monitoring, and managing contingent liabilities that arise from selective guarantees for \nPPP  projects  against  risks  related  to  policies  and  performance  of  the  Government  and  its \n                                                 \n15  KKPPI,  which  reports directly to the  president, is co-chaired by the coordinating minister of economic affairs and \nthe  chairperson  of  BAPPENAS,  the  latter  acting  as  the  executive  chair.  Its  members  include  the  ministers  of \nfinance, home affairs, energy and mineral resources, public works, transportation, communications and informatics, \nand state-owned enterprises, as well as the cabinet secretary.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nagencies.  Under  subprogram  1,  regulation  38/2006  on  risk  management  policy  was  issued  to \nensure that risks of individual PPP projects were appropriately allocated between the public and \nprivate sectors, and that the Government\u2019s overall exposure was well managed. The declared \nobjective  of  the  policy  was  to  support  infrastructure  development  while  maintaining  fiscal \nsustainability  of  the  government  budget.  Regulation  38/2006  described  the  types  of  risks  the \nGovernment might consider sharing (those related to political events, project performance, and \ndemand),  the  main  principles  for  providing  such  support  (legality,  project  quality  in  terms  of \ntechnical and financial feasibility, fiscal prudence in terms of total exposure and annual budget, \nand  transparency),  and  approval  procedures.  To  implement  regulation  38/2006,  a  permanent \nrisk management unit (RMU) was established in MOF.  \n \n51. \n  Under  subprogram  2,  the  RMU  has  become  fully  operational  in  terms  of  functions, \nbudget, staffing, and operational procedures, with support provided through the TA attached to \nthe  IRSDP  (para.  39).  The  RMU  has  reviewed  a  number  of  PPP  proposals  for  government \nsupport submitted by the line ministries and agencies, particularly in the road and transportation \nsectors. In doing so, it has upheld the principles stipulated in regulation 38/2006, including the \ntransparency  principle  requiring  that  any  request  for  government  support  must  be  submitted \nbefore tendering. In the 2008 budget, Rp745 billion has been allocated for such support for toll \nroads, and Rp300 billion for power projects. In addition, an initial allocation of Rp1.05 trillion has \nbeen provided for the newly established Government Investment Center, and a policy paper has \nbeen  prepared  by  MOF  on  a  guarantee  fund  to  provide  backing  for  government  support,  with \nthe view to establishing such fund under subprogram 3. \n \n52. \nInnovative Financing Models and Mechanisms. Under subprogram 1, MOF prepared \na  policy  paper  outlining  measures  needed  to  mobilize  resources  through  various  models  and \nmechanisms  in  order  to  provide  financing  for  PPP  projects.  The  paper  covered  the  entire \nspectrum  of  financing  needs,  from  project  preparation  to  implementation,  for  both  public  and \nprivate  investments  and  guarantees.  Given  the  weaknesses  in  project  preparation  that  have \nimpeded execution of PPP transactions, establishment of the PDF has been given priority under \nsubprogram 2. After a slow start, the PDF is now fully operational and the pipeline of national \nand regional projects seeking its funding for feasibility studies and transaction advisory services \nis growing.16 \n \n  Under  subprogram  2,  preparations  have  also  been  made  to  offer  financing  to  private \n53. \nand public sponsors of PPP projects. Based on Government regulation 66/2007 proposes that a \ngovernment  holding  company  be  established  under  MOF  and  provided  with  Rp1  trillion  in \nequity.  About  60%  of  this  is  expected  to  be  invested  by  the  holding  company  in  the  IIFF,  a \nnonbank financial institution modeled after the Infrastructure Development Financing Company \ncreated in India in 1996 with ADB assistance, which will provide long-term local currency debt \nand  equity  to  project  sponsors.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  Group  are  processing  equity \ninvestments  in  the  IIFF  and  loans  to  the  Government  to  fund  its  subordinate  debt.  JICA  and \nKreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (the  Credit  Institute  for  Reconstruction)  are  also  considering \nfinancing for the IIFF, which will become operational under subprogram 3. \n \n  Land  Acquisition.  Under  subprogram  1,  intensive  stakeholder  review  and  feedback, \n54. \nincluding  comments  from  international  investors,  resulted  in  the  adoption  of  presidential \nregulation  65/2006  to  amend  presidential  regulation  36/2005.17  Together,  the  two  regulations \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16 About 40% of the combined loan and grant resources of the PDF of $34.1 million have already been committed for \n\nvarious consulting contracts. \n\n17  Replacing presidential regulation 55/1993 on land acquisition for public infrastructure and providing for independent \nvaluation of property to reduce opportunity for speculation; expanding the definition of public interest to areas such \nas piped water, power transmission lines, and sanitary landfills; and clarifying the period of negotiations before any \nrecourse by expropriation can be sought. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n  \n\n \n\nto  accelerate \n\nthe  process  while  ensuring \n\nmoved  the  Government\u2019s  policies  on  land  acquisition  closer  to  internationally  accepted \nprinciples on involuntary resettlement, particularly with regard to provisions on the use of market \nprices and recognition of nonphysical losses. For projects serving public interest, expropriation \nafter  120  days\u2014excluding  the  time  required  for  identification,  valuation,  and  notification\u2014is \nallowed if no agreement is reached with the landowner.  \n \n55. \n  During  subprogram  2,  an  analysis  of  the  remaining  gaps  between  the  new  land \nacquisition  framework  and  international  best  practices,  such  as  the  Equator  Principles,18  has \nbeen carried out with assistance from the World Bank and ADB. The analysis has focused on \nlivelihood restoration, consultation, grievance redress, and rights of squatters, and some of its \nrecommendations have been taken into account by decree 3/2007 of the National Land Agency \n(BPN)  when  issuing  implementing  regulations  for  the  two  presidential  regulations.19  However, \nland acquisition continues to be a stumbling block for PPP projects, particularly toll roads (para. \n63). As agreed under the World Bank\u2019s IDPL, a land working group chaired by BPN is to review \nthe  current  policy  and  implementation  of  land  acquisition,  and  prepare  policy  and  operational \nrecommendations  and  an  action  plan \nfair \ncompensation. The objective is to formulate a long-term approach\u2014the so-called land banking \nthrough  zoning  and  purchase\u2014for  securing  land  well  in  advance  of  tendering  to  avoid \nspeculation. \n \n56. \nIntergovernmental  Coordination.  The  issues  related  to  intergovernmental  fiscal \nrelations, local government borrowing (including onlending and on-granting of foreign loans by \nthe  central  government  to  local  governments),  and  restructuring  of  local  government  debt \narrears,  have  been  addressed  by  strengthening  the  relevant  legal  framework.  As  shown  in \nAppendix  5,  these  efforts  have  been  supported  by  other  policy-based  operations.  The  World \nBank  has  done  so  through  its  development  policy  loan  series.  In  addition  to  cofinancing  the \ndevelopment  policy  loans,  ADB  has  provided  such  support  through  the  second  local \ngovernment  finance  and  governance  reform  program  cluster  series.20  Under  subprogram  2  of \nthe IRSDP, national and local government responsibilities in infrastructure provision, operation, \ncontracting, and regulating have been clarified through Government regulation 38/2007.21 These \ndecentralization  principles  have  also  been  reflected  in  the  new  laws  on  railways,  shipping, \naviation,  road  traffic  and  transportation,  energy,  and  electricity,  as  well  as  in  the  related \ngovernment regulations. \n \n57. \n  Public Service Obligation Policy. The PSO policy is an important thematic area that \ncuts  across  all  infrastructure  sectors.  PSO  activities  are  currently  being  delivered  under  two \nbroad categories: (i) those assigned to SOEs and regulated under the SOE law, and (ii) those \nknown  as  \u201cpioneering  services\u201d  in  the  transportation  sector  that  include  assignments  to  both \nSOEs and PSP in service delivery through tendered contracts. The expansion of activities that \nare  subsidized  by  the  Government  and  the  sharp  increase  in  the  amount  of  subsidies  has \nunderlined the need to clarify the PSO definition and standardize approaches to PSO planning \nand  implementation.  Under  subprogram  2  and  with  the  TA  support  (footnote  9),  the  current \n\n                                                 \n18  These  are  a  set  of  environmental  and  social  benchmarks  for  managing  environmental  and  social  issues  in \ndevelopment project finance. More than 60 banks have adopted the Equator Principles, which have become the de \nfacto standard for banks and investors on how to assess major development projects around the world. \n\n19  The  other  recommendations  will  be  considered  when  formulating  a  new  land  law  that  would  replace  the  Basic \n\nAgrarian Law of 1973, for which a TA project is being processed by ADB. \n\n20 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Loan \nand Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for the Second Local Government Finance and Governance \nReform Program Cluster. Manila. \n\n21  Government  regulation  38/2007  on  the  Division  of  Responsibilities  among  the  central,  provincial,  district,  and \nmunicipal governments comprises the implementing rules and regulations for Law 32/2004 on regional autonomy. \nIt  is  a  comprehensive  document  of  almost  900  pages  that  allocates  the  responsibilities  in  32  sectors,  such  as \ninfrastructure, education, health, and forestry, to the different levels of government. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\npractices  and  arrangements  have  been  reviewed,  and  policy  recommendations  developed  in \nclose collaboration with the concerned line ministries and agencies. The approach would be to \nundertake  the  following  steps  for  each  PSO  proposal:  (i)  identification  of  the  rationale  for \nsubsidization, (ii) determination of target beneficiaries, (iii) determination of PSO objectives and \noutcomes, (iv) estimation of the PSO cost, (v) selection of the most suitable delivery mechanism \nsuch  as  lifeline  rates  or  direct  cash  subsidy,  (vi)  development  of  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem, and (vii) description of contractual and payment arrangements. \n \n58. \n  The new PSO policy will be issued and implemented under subprogram 3. Mirroring the \ncross-sector  approach  to  PPP  projects  through  presidential  regulation  67/2005,  a  PSO \nregulation will be issued by BAPPENAS. The regulation will provide for the establishment of a \ncentral  PSO  unit  under  the  KKPPI  secretariat  to  assist  the  line  ministries  and  agencies  in \npreparing  the  standardized  PSO  proposals,  which  will  be  screened  and  prioritized  by  KKPPI \nbefore their submission to Parliament.  \n \n59. \n  Sector  Regulation.  This  is  another  important  cross-cutting  area  where  the  current \npractices  and  arrangements  differ  widely  from  sector  to  sector  (para.  17).  Nevertheless, \nprogress  has  been  made  towards  a  better  regulatory  framework.  Prior  to  and  during \nsubprogram  1,  the  Government  established  new,  though  not  yet  fully  independent,  regulatory \nbodies  for  toll  roads,  the  downstream  part  of  the  oil  and  gas  sector,  telecommunications,  and \nwater  supply  and  sanitation.  Under  subprogram  2,  these  bodies  have  become  operational  in \nterms  of  budget,  staffing,  functions,  and  standard  operating  procedures.  In  addition,  a  similar \ncollaborative  approach  supported  by  TA  (footnote  9)  as  used  to  develop  the  PSO  policy  has \nbeen adopted to review the current practices and arrangements in all infrastructure sectors, and \nto formulate short- and medium-term recommendations for strengthening sector regulation. The \nkey  recommendation  is  to  aim  at  having  in  each  sector  an  independent  regulator  with  the \nfollowing  economic  functions:  (i)  setting  (approving)  tariffs  and  other  service  charges,  (ii) \nestablishing  standards  for  the  terms  and  conditions  of  providing  services,  (iii)  making  and \nenforcing market rules for the sector, (iv) monitoring economic and management performance of \nthe regulated entities, (v) issuing, reviewing, and canceling licenses, (vi) reviewing concession \nagreements, and (vii) arbitrating disputes within the sector. \n \n60. \nThe  development  of  such  independent  regulators  will  require  time,  legislative  changes \nthat  may  not  be  possible  in  some  sectors,22  and,  most  importantly,  willingness  by  the \nGovernment to give up its control of tariffs. As such, it is unlikely to occur within the remaining \nIRSDP  time  frame.  However,  various  short-term  recommendations  to  move  towards  the \nintroduction  of  internationally  recognized  regulatory  practices  can  be  implemented  under \nsubprogram  3.  These  include  consolidating  the  existing  regulatory  functions  under  each  line \nministry,  building  the  line  ministries'  capacity  in  regulatory  procedures,  creating  a  more \ntransparent regulatory environment, encouraging stakeholder participation in regulatory matters, \nand  allowing  tariffs  to  reach  cost  recovery  levels.  During  this  transition  period,  regulation  by \ncontract will play an important role for PPP projects.   \n \n\n3. \n\nSector Policy, Legal, and Institutional Reforms \n\n  Roads. Road law 38/2004 and the subsequent Government regulation 15/2005 on Toll \n61. \nRoads  unbundled  the  sector  by  (i)  ending  the  monopoly  of  the  main  SOE,  Jasa  Marga,  in  toll \nroad  development,  (ii)  allowing  private  investors  to  bid  for  new  toll  road  concessions  in \ncompetition with Jasa Marga, (iii) separating the regulatory functions from Jasa Marga, and (iv) \nestablishing a new regulatory and contracting body, the Indonesian Toll Road Authority (BPJT). \n                                                 \n 22 After the annulment of law 20/2002 on Electricity by the Constitutional Court, and given the political sensitivity of \nelectricity  tariffs,  delegating  their  control  to  an  independent  regulator  will  be  difficult.  By  contrast,  the  new  law \n17/2008 on shipping does provide for the establishment of regional port authorities with a regulatory function.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n  \n\nDecree  374/2005  of  MPW  stipulated  that  the  toll  road  tariffs  should  be  set  on  the  basis  of  a \ntendering process. At the same time, tariffs for existing toll roads were increased by 15%\u201350% \nto ensure financial sustainability of toll road operation. Under subprogram 2, the legal framework \nhas  been  completed  by  eight  MPW  regulations  related  to  various  aspects  of  toll  road \npreparation,  development,  and  operation.  Under  subprogram  3,  road  law  38/2004  will  be \ncomplemented  by  the  new  Law  on  Road  Traffic  and  Transportation,  already  drafted  by  MOT \nand  submitted  to  Parliament,  which  provides  opportunities  for  PSP  in  transport  services, \ntransport infrastructure such as bus terminals and parking, and support services such as vehicle \ninspection. \n \n62. \nBPJT,  which  reports  to  the  minister  of  Public  Works,  has  become  fully  operational.  Its \nresponsibilities  include  developing  business  plans  and  feasibility  studies  for  toll  road  projects, \nfacilitating  land  acquisition,  recommending  toll  fees,  and  conduct  tendering  and  supervise  the \nimplementation  of  toll  road  concessions.  Several  options  for  enhancing  BPJT\u2019s  independence \nare under study, one of them being the conversion to a public service agency that would need \napproval by Parliament. \n \n  BPJT has been active in implementing the Government\u2019s toll road program. Selection of \n63. \nprivate  sector  sponsors  has  been  undertaken  for  several  batches  totaling  28  projects,  and \nconcession  agreements  have  been  signed  for  22  of  them.  However,  because  of  inadequate \nproject  preparation  and  uncertainties  about  land  acquisition  and  Government  support, \ncompetition has been generally weak and the project sponsors have had difficulties in achieving \nfinancial  closure.  Two  measures  have  been  taken  to  overcome  these  problems.  A  revolving \nfund  for  land  acquisition  has  been  established  by  MOF  and  MPW  through  the  creation  of  a \npublic service agency for this purpose, and initial capital of Rp1.44 trillion has been allocated to \nit  in  the  2008  budget.  Second,  the  land-capping  principle  has  been  introduced  for  the  28 \nprojects, with the toll road companies bearing the additional cost of land acquisition up to 10% \nof  the  value  stipulated  in  their  concession  agreements  and  the  Government  contributing  the \nrest.  The  total  amount  of  Government  support  of  Rp.4.9  trillion  for  these  projects  will  be \nallocated under the amendment to the 2008 budget, and in the 2009 and 2010 budgets. For any \nnew  toll  road  projects,  the  land  acquisition  process  will  have  to  be  completed  before  bids  are \ncalled for. \n \nTo  increase  transparency  and  reduce  opportunities  for  corruption,  MPW\u2019s  Directorate \n64. \nGeneral  of  Highways  (DGH)  has  adopted  standard  bidding  documents  and  developed  an  e-\nprocurement  system  for  all  road  contracts.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  system  has  been \nimplemented in the headquarters. It will be expanded nationally during the subprogram 3 period. \nIn  addition,  a  comprehensive  action  program  of  other  anticorruption  measures  in  the  areas  of \nprocurement, monitoring and evaluation, community participation, internal and external auditing, \nand human resource development, has been formulated and is being implemented. \n \nUnder  subprogram  2,  DGH  has  given  priority  in  its  budget  to  routine  maintenance, \n65. \nincreasing the allocation from Rp1.48 trillion in 2006 to Rp2.49 trillion in 2007 and Rp2.77 trillion \nin 2008. To put the financing of road maintenance on a self-sustaining basis, it will be necessary \nto  restructure  the  current  vehicle-related  taxes  into  a  system  of  road  user  charges  which \nensures  full  recovery  of  the  necessary  road  preservation  costs  and  reflects  actual road  usage \nand the contribution of various vehicle categories to these costs. In particular, charges for heavy \nvehicles should be related to their load capacity and road-damaging effects. Under subprogram \n2, the establishment of a suitable mechanism in the form of the road fund has been studied with \nTA  support  (footnote  9).  As  such  a  fund  can  operate  only  after  all  fuel  subsidies  have  been \nremoved, recommendations have been made for the interim period. Finally, to increase PSP in \nthis  area,  with  assistance  from  the World  Bank  and  AusAID,  DGH  is  developing a  program  of \nperformance-based contracting for road maintenance and vehicle load control. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\n \n\n66. \n  Ports and Airports. The legal framework is being revised to end the monopolies of the \nfour SOEs in the port sector and two SOEs in the airport sector, as well as their multiple roles of \nlandlord,  regulator,  contracting  authority  for  the  provision  of  port  and  airport  services,  and \noperator.  The  revision  started  under  subprogram  1  with  presidential  instruction  5/2005  on \nEmpowering  Domestic  Shipping  Industry,  which  encouraged  competition  among  operators \nwithin and between ports. Under subprogram 2, law 17/2008 on shipping, which aims to make \nport  operations  more  efficient  and  reduce  the  high  transportation  costs,  has  been  passed  by \nParliament.  It  reflects  decentralization,  removes  the  monopoly  within  a  transition  period  of  3 \nyears  after  which  SOEs  will  transfer  their  assets  to  the  Government  and  play  only  the  role  of \noperators, and allows PSP without having to form a joint venture with SOEs. The new law also \ncalls  for  the  establishment,  on  a  regional  basis  under  MOT,  of  port  authorities  to  act  as \nregulators and contracting agencies. Under subprogram 3, eight government regulations will be \nissued  to  guide  implementation  of  the  new  law.  Similar  liberalization  is expected  in  the  airport \nbusiness and airline industry with the new law on aviation. Apart from ending the SOE monopoly \nand establishing a new regulator, the draft law envisages the creation of a separate provider of \nair traffic control services. \n \nIn  both  sectors,  MOT  regulations  have  been  issued  during  subprogram  2  on  tariff \n67. \nformulation  and  application  for  port  and  airport  services,  distinguishing  between  ports  and \nairports  operated  by  the  SOEs  and  those  under  the  responsibility  of  MOT.  Similar  regulations \nhave been issued for economy-class airfares and shipping tariffs.  \n \n68. \nRailways. An important subprogram 2 milestone has been the passage by Parliament \nof  law  23/2007  on  railway,  which  has  removed  the  monopoly  of  the  SOE\u2014the  Indonesian \nRailway Corporation (KAI)\u2014and established the framework for PSP both in the development of \nbasic infrastructure and operation of rolling stock. MOT has drafted four government regulations \nfor the new law that elaborate on, among other things, the role of central and local governments \nand the selection of private sector partners. Another subprogram 2 output has been the railway \nrevitalization program for 2008\u20132010 that covers Java and North Sumatra, where about 4,000 \nkilometers  of  railways  are  still  in  operation.  In  addition,  the railway  transportation master  plan, \nfocusing  on  short-term  investments  and  operation  and  maintenance,  has  been  updated  with \nJICA\u2019s  assistance.  To  implement  the  revitalization  program,  the  Government  has  allocated \nRp19 trillion ($2.1 billion) to KAI for a planned joint venture with private companies to transport \ncement,  coal,  and  shipping  containers  in  Sumatra,  and  as  the  start-up  capital  for  a  new \nsubsidiary  which  will  double  the  capacity  of  the  commuter  rail  service  in  Jakarta  and  its \nenvirons.  \n \nPassenger  fares  for  economy-class  travel  are  set  periodically  by  MOT,  putting  more \n69. \nemphasis on ability to pay than cost recovery. Other passenger fares and all freight fares can be \nset  by  KAI  subject  to  MOT\u2019s  endorsement.  Under  subprogram  3,  an  MOT  regulation  on  the \nformula for tariff calculation aimed at full cost recovery, taking into account PSO subsidy, will be \nissued. Such transparent tariff and PSO arrangements are necessary to encourage PSP. JICA \nis assisting KAI in improving railway operation and maintenance so that it will be able to meet \nthe challenge of competition with private service providers. \n \nOil  and  Gas.  The  Government  has  given  high  priority  to,  and  showed  remarkable \n70. \npolitical courage in, reducing fuel subsidies that have imposed a heavy burden on the budget, \ndisproportionately benefited the middle class and the rich, and distorted the energy mix. In 2005 \nunder subprogram 1, the domestic prices of oil products except kerosene were first increased \nby an average of 49%. This was followed by bringing the prices for industrial users, accounting \nfor  37%  of  total  consumption,  to  international  levels  and,  after  intensive  socialization  efforts, \nraising prices of the remaining oil products by an additional 126%. To mitigate the social impact \nof  these  unprecedented  measures,  the  Government  announced  a  major  package  of  direct \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n  \n\nsubsidies  to  the  poor.  The  Government  also  made  clear  its  intention  to  complete  the  fuel \nsubsidy  removal  in  the  next  few  years  and  let  domestic  oil  prices  follow  international  prices \nthereafter. However, the sharp price increases led to a temporary slowdown in economic growth \nand an upsurge in inflation. For macroeconomic and political reasons, the Government decided \nto defer further price adjustments until after the next elections in 2009. The recent escalation of \ninternational  oil  prices  made  a  reconsideration  of  this  decision  unavoidable.  In  May  2008, \ndomestic  oil  prices  were  increased  by  an  average  of  29%.23  The  price  increases  have  been \ncomplemented by several measures to influence consumer behavior and stop diversion of the \nstill highly subsidized kerosene to other uses: (i) issuance of control cards to households limiting \ntheir monthly kerosene consumption, (ii) conversion from kerosene to liquefied petroleum gas, \nwith  free  distribution  of  gas  stoves  and  cylinders  to  households,24  and  (iii)  smart  cards  for \ngasoline limiting the quantity purchased per vehicle at the subsidized price.  \n \nGiven  the  country's  large  reserves,  natural  gas  can  play  a  much  more  important  role \n71. \ndomestically.  Presidential  regulation  5/2006  on  National  Energy  Policy  calls  for  a  minimum \nshare of 30% for natural gas in Indonesia\u2019s energy mix by 2025, compared to less than 20% for \noil.  To  move  towards  this  target,  an  oil  and  gas  sector  blueprint  has  been  prepared  and  a \nmaster  plan  for  the  natural  gas  pipeline  network  already  completed  under  subprogram  2.  In \nresponse  to  the  Constitutional  Court\u2019s  ruling  on  Oil  and  Gas  Law  22/2001,  the  Ministry  of \nEnergy  and  Mineral  Resources  (MEMR)  has  drafted  two  regulations,  which  set  the  domestic \nmarket  obligation  for  gas  producers  at  25%  and  outline  pricing  principles.  Another  impetus  to \nthe  domestic  use  of  gas  has  come  from  the  new  law  30/2007  on  Energy  and  the  related \nGovernment regulations on energy conservation, renewable energy, and supply and utilization \nof energy, all of which promote greater PSP. As investments in the country\u2019s large reserves of \ncoal-bed  methane  have  been  limited  due  to  lack  of  policy  and  legal  clarity,  guidelines  for  the \nexploration  and  production  of  this  resource  have  been  issued  through  MEMR  regulation \n33/2006. BPH Migas, established as a regulatory body for downstream oil and gas activities and \na  contracting  agency  for  transmission  and  distribution  of  natural  gas,  is  fully  operational  with \nabout 70 permanent and 30 contractual staff. Its main objectives are to ensure supply security \nof oil products and increase domestic utilization of natural gas.  \n \n72. \nPower. The annulment by the Constitutional Court of law 20/2002 on Electricity, which \nprovided  a  progressive  long-term  vision  in  terms  of  unbundling,  independent  regulation, \ncompetition,  and  PSP,  was  a  serious  setback  for  power  sector  reforms.  To  remove  the  legal \nuncertainty  caused  by  this  ruling  that  automatically  led  to  reenactment  of  the  previous  law \n15/1985 on Electricity, Government regulations 3/2005 and 26/2006 were issued as an interim \nsolution  until  a  new  law  was  in  place.  While  giving  the  principal  authority  for  power  supply  to \nPLN,  the  regulations  allow  purchase  of  electricity  by  PLN  from  independent  power  producers \n(IPPs). Under subprogram 2, a new electricity law has been drafted by MEMR and submitted to \nParliament, where it has been undergoing extensive deliberations and stakeholder consultations \nto  reach  a  consensus  on  how  to  reduce  PLN\u2019s  monopoly  and  increase  competition,  while \nretaining  control  of  the  sector  through  stronger  planning  and  regulation.  The  draft  law  allows \ncompetition  only  in  power  generation  but  it  provides  for  more  than  one  utility,  so  that \nregionalization of power supply is possible. In anticipation of this change, the Ministry of State-\nOwned  Enterprises  has  prepared  a  policy  paper  on  PLN\u2019s  restructuring  that  envisages  the \ncreation of regional subsidiaries and the conversion of PLN from an operator to an investment \nholding  company.  The  first  step  in  implementing  the  paper\u2019s  recommendation  has  been  taken \nby restructuring PLN\u2019s board of directors in March 2008 and tasking it with the establishment of \n\n                                                 \n23 From Rp4,500/liter (l) to Rp6,000/l for gasoline (by 33%), from Rp4,300/l to Rp5,500/l for automotive diesel oil (by \n28%), and from Rp2,000/l to Rp2,500/l for kerosene (by 25%). Despite these significant increases, the allocation \nfor  fuel  subsidies  in  the  revised  national  budget  amounts  to  Rp127  trillion  ($13.9  billion),  or  about  12%  of  total \nspending (based on an assumed average price of $95/barrel throughout 2008). \n\n24 As of 30 June 2008, free gas stoves had been distributed to 9.3 million low-income families and businesses. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nsubsidiaries in Java-Bali in 2009, Sumatra in 2009, and East Indonesia thereafter. The Java-Bali \nsubsidiary will be responsible only for power transmission and distribution, as there are already \ntwo generation subsidiaries in that region. \n \n73. \nPLN  has  an  installed  capacity  of  about  24,000  megawatts  (MW),  but  with  demand \ngrowing at almost 10% per year, its reserve margin has decreased to 20% from the safe level of \n30%.  This  decrease,  combined  with  derating  of  older  power  plants  and  problems  with  natural \ngas  supply,  has  recently  led  to  widespread  load  shedding.  PLN\u2019s  10-year  power  development \nplan, updated under subprogram 2, is anchored on a fast-track public sector program of 10,000 \nMW  of  coal-fired  plants  and  an  IPP  program  of  another  10,000  MW  using  coal,  geothermal \nenergy, and renewable energy resources. Both programs are under way, but it will take several \nyears to remove the capacity constraints and displace oil-based generation. Under subprogram \n3,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  PLN  will  formulate  and  start  to  implement  a  new  rural \nelectrification strategy to meet the Government\u2019s target of 90% access by 2020.   \n \n74. \nUnlike domestic oil prices, there has been no uniform increase in electricity tariffs since \n2003,  when  the  average  tariff  was  brought  to  the  pre-crisis  level  of  $0.068  per  kilowatt-hour \n(kWh),  with  only  the  first  30  kWh  of  the  monthly  consumption  of  small  consumers  subsidized \nthrough a lifeline rate of $0.018/kWh. Because of the escalating oil prices and significant share \nof oil-fired power plants in PLN\u2019s generation mix, the fuel cost alone now exceeds the average \ntariff,  and  all  consumer  categories  are  subsidized.  The  total  electricity  subsidy  in  2008  is \nestimated at Rp60 trillion ($6.5 billion). PLN is having ongoing discussions with large industries \nto seek increased payments in return for more reliable power supply. In April 2008, the so-called \ndisincentive  scheme,  with  unsubsidized  tariffs  for  consumption  above  a  certain  threshold,  has \nbeen introduced for large residential customers, but the Government is reluctant to go beyond \nthat and compound the effects of the domestic oil price increases with major across-the-board \nelectricity  tariff  adjustments.  Nevertheless,  the  Government  recognizes  that  restoring  PLN\u2019s \nfinancial  viability  in  the  medium  term  is  crucial  to  enhancing  its  creditworthiness  and  avoiding \nrequests by IPPs and their lenders for government guarantees against this off-take risk. In the \ninterim, the Government has been providing assurances for new IPP projects by referring to its \nPSO policy for SOEs and MOF\u2019s regulations on PLN subsidy.   \n \n75. \nTelecommunications. This infrastructure sector is more advanced in terms of reforms \nthan  the  others  and  is  naturally  progressing,  without  much  external  intervention,  towards  ever \ngreater PSP. As in other countries, this is attributable to the technological advances driving the \nsector,  as  well  as  to  the  fact  that  its  tariffs  are  less  affected  by  political  and  social \nconsiderations. The two major enterprises\u2014Telkom and Indosat\u2014are listed on the Jakarta and \nNew  York  stock  exchanges,  the  Indonesian  Telecommunications  Regulatory  Body  (BRTI) \nestablished  under  the  Ministry  of  Communications  and  Informatics  is  fully  operational,  and \nregulation 8/2006 on interconnection has allowed a move from revenue sharing to a cost-based \napproach for tariff setting.  \n \n76. \nUnder  subprogram  2,  the  scope  of  the  sector  blueprint  has  been  broadened  to  reflect \nthe convergence of information and communications technology (ICT). The blueprint, named the \nICT Infrastructure Convergence Road Map, aims at creating a more competitive market for the \nentire  spectrum  of  these  services  (voice,  data,  and  broadcasting),  and  will  be  implemented \nduring  2009\u20132014.  As  part  of  the  move  from  the  Telkom  and  Indosat  duopoly  to  more \ncompetition, a third provider of international connections\u2014Bakrie Telekom\u2014has been selected \nin  a  \u201cbeauty  contest\u201d25  of  four  domestic  candidates,  based  on  their  subscriber  base,  and \ninternational  and  domestic  links.  A  similar  contest  is  under  preparation  for  long-distance \n\n                                                 \n25  This  term  is  used  for  a  technical,  administrative,  and  financial  evaluation  of  operators  that  is  allowed  by  law \n\n36/1999 on telecommunications and the related Government regulation 52/2000. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n  \n\ndomestic  connections.  Ministerial  regulation  9/2006  has  provided  formulas  to  be  used  by \noperators to set their basic tariffs for fixed lines, and ministerial regulation 9/2008 does the same \nfor  cellular  phones,  with  BRTI  having  the  right  to  intervene  in  the  case  of  noncompetitive \nconduct. In April 2008, BRTI cut cellular interconnection tariffs by 20%\u201340%. Finally, a universal \nservice  obligation  policy  has  been  formulated  to  accelerate  the  expansion  of  services  in  rural \nareas.26  Government  regulation  28/2005  allows  the  retention  of  0.75%  of  revenues  of \ntelecommunication  companies  for  this  purpose.  Tendering  open  to  all  operators  in  Indonesia \nhas  been  conducted  for  performance-based  contracts  for  11  geographical  blocks,  with  the \nrequired monthly subsidy as the main bid parameter.  \n \n77.  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  The  IRSDP  has  supported  the  formulation  and \nimplementation  of  policies  on  community  and  institution-based  provision  of  water  supply  and \nsanitation  services  to  more  effectively  address  access  and  quality  issues  in  service  delivery. \nThe  Water  Resources  Law  7/2004  and  Government  regulation  16/2005  on  Water  Supply \nestablished  the  legal  framework  for  PSP  by  clarifying  its  forms,27  ending  PDAM  monopolies, \neliminating  the  need  for  local  parliament  approval  of  water  tariff  increases,  and  calling  for  the \nestablishment  of  the  National  Water  Supply  System  Development  Supporting  Agency \n(BPPSPAM)  under  MPW.  During  subprogram  2,  MPW  regulation  20/2006  on  policy  and \nstrategy  for  water  supply  development  has  been  issued  that  aims  at  increasing  the  current \nconnection  ratios  of  about  42%  in  urban  areas  and  9%  in  rural  areas  to  meet  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal target of halving by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access \nto safe drinking water. The two-pronged strategy relies on PDAMs and private concessionaires \nfor expanding water supply and sanitation in urban areas and a community-driven development \napproach  in  rural  villages.  The  latter  is  supported  by  the  Government\u2019s  Self-Help  Program  for \nCommunity Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri) that provides grants for small facilities in all villages \nin  Indonesia  during  2007\u20132012.28  The  legal  framework  has  been  completed  through  MPW \nregulations  on  water  supply  provision  (with  detailed  guidelines  for  PDAMs  and  private  sector \noperators)  and  solid-waste  management,  as  well  as  by  passing  law  18/2008  on  Municipal \nWaste Management that promotes the \"3Rs\" principle (reduce, reuse, and recycle).  \n \n78. \nBPPSPAM is an advisory body whose responsibilities include helping formulate sector \npolicy  and  strategy,  setting  operational  standards  for  water  supply,  setting  and  evaluating \nservice  standards  and  performance  of  PDAMs,  making  recommendations  on  involving \ncooperatives and the private sector in water supply, and settling disputes. Under subprogram 2, \nBPPSPAM has completed the mapping of managerial, technical, and financial performance for \n306 out of 335 PDAMs,29 and published the results in a book and on its website. Using criteria \nsuch as operating ratio, debt\u2013equity ratio, customer structure, number of employees per 1,000 \ncustomers,  water  losses,  and  operating  hours,  the  PDAMs  have  been  classified  into  three \ncategories: (i) healthy PDAMs (79, or 26%), (ii) less healthy PDAMs (114, or 37%), and (iii) sick \nPDAMs (113, or 37%). The mapping will be updated every year to exert pressure on PDAMs to \nimprove their performance through enhanced managerial autonomy, technical capacity building, \ncost recovery tariffs, improved revenue collection, better financial management and accounting, \nunaccounted-for water reduction, stronger customer orientation, and mergers of small nonviable \nPDAMs. \n \nAn important prerequisite for improving performance of PDAMs so that they can expand \n79. \nservice  coverage  is  debt  resolution.  MOF  regulation  107/2005  allowed  restructuring  of  PDAM \ndebt  totaling  Rp6.7  trillion,  but  progress  was  very  slow.  A  more  radical  restructuring  program \n\n                                                 \n26 In the telecommunications sector, PSO is generally referred to as universal service obligation. \n27  PSP  can  take  the  form  of  a  cooperation  agreement  with  the  PDAM  concerned  or  a  license  granted  by  the  local \n\ngovernment concerned. \n\n28 PNPM Mandiri is cofinanced by ADB, JICA, and World Bank. \n29 The remaining PDAMs do not have financial statements yet. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\nhas therefore been designed with the following main features: (i) debt principal must be repaid, \nbut the repayment can be rescheduled, (ii) interest and penalties can be fully written off for the \nless healthy and sick PDAMs, and partly written off and partly swapped into investment by the \nhealthy ones, (iii) to participate in the program, PDAMs must submit to MOF by December 2008 \na  request,  supported  by  an  audited  financial  report  with  no  qualifications,  an  audited \nperformance  report,  previous  year  budget,  5-year  business  plan,  and  a  joint  letter  from  the \nmayor and head of local parliament that the PDAM will honor its debt obligations, and (iv) the \nPDAM\u2019s  tariffs  must  be  higher  than  the  production  costs  plus  overheads.  This  program  has \nbeen formally launched by MOF regulation 120/2008 on PDAM Debt Restructuring. \n \n80.  With regard to tariffs, after the removal of the requirement for local parliament approval \nof any increases, regulation 23/2006 on drinking water tariff policy was issued by the Ministry of \nHome Affairs. It introduced the principle of cost recovery and reduced the number of customer \ncategories. Most PDAMs in the healthy category have benefited from tariff increases. Based on \nBPPSPAM\u2019s ranking, MPW has sent a letter to about 50 large PDAMs in the lower categories to \nadjust their tariffs to the cost-recovery level of Rp3,500 per cubic meter.  \n \n\n4. \n\nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Projects \n\n81. \nThe  best  test  of  the  new  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  is \nsuccessful  implementation  of  PPP  projects  that  would  signal  Indonesia\u2019s  readiness  for  private \ninvestment  and  its  ability  to  follow  international  practices  in  terms  of  transparency  and \ncompetition.  That  is  the  reason  why  the  policy  matrix  also  includes  actions  directly  related  to \nsuch projects.  \n \nAt the IIS in January 2005, the Government offered 91 projects totaling $22.5 billion to \n82. \nthe  private  sector,  but  the  response  was  mostly  weak,  and  in  those  cases  where  concession \nagreements were signed, the project sponsors have had difficulties in arranging financing. With \nthe  establishment  of  PSP  and  risk-management  frameworks  and  strengthening  of  KKPPI,  the \nexecution  of  PPP  projects  was  expected  to  accelerate.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  Government \nidentified 10 candidates for model PPP projects with combined investment requirements of $4.5 \nbillion  that  would  go  through  all  the  necessary  preparatory  steps  and  transparent  tendering \nprocesses stipulated in the new frameworks (Table 3).  \n \n\nTable 3: Model Public\u2013Private Partnership Projects  \n\n \nProject \nCentral Java Coal-Fired Power Plant  \nPasuruan Combined Cycle Plant \n\n \nKey Feature \n1,200 MW \n600 MW \n\nInvestment  \n($ million) \n\n \nCurrent Status \n\n1,200  FS ongoing \n\nMedan\u2013Kuala Namu Toll Road  \nSolo\u2013Kertosono Toll Road  \nMargagiri\u2013Ketapang Ferry Terminal \n\nTeluk Lamong Seaport \n\n22 km \n165 km \n0.9 million vehicles and \n1.2 million passengers p.a. \n1.9 million containers p.a. \n\nKabupaten Bandung Water Supply  \nKabupaten Dumai Water Supply \nKabupaten Tangerang Water Supply \n\n450 l/second \n500 l/second \n550 l/second \n\n275  Gas supply assessment \n\ncompleted \n\n142  FS revised and updated \n928  Tendering completed \n\n97  Recruitment of FS consultants \n\nunder way \n\n275  FS completed; project \n\ndeferred \n26  FS completed.  \n44  Project postponed \n37  Tendering completed; \n\nconcession agreement signed  \n\n30,000 km of fiber optic \ncable \n\nPalapa Ring Telecommunications \nProject \nFS = feasibility study, l = liter, km = kilometer, MW = megawatt, p.a. = per annum. \nSource: KKPPI (National Committee for the Acceleration of Infrastructure Provision) secretariat. \n \n83.  While significant progress has been made in implementing policy reforms, the progress \non the model projects during subprogram 2 has been uneven. As shown in Table 3, feasibility \n\n1,500  Tendering completed \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n  \n\nstudies  have  been  completed  or  are  ongoing  for  7  out  of  the  10  model  projects,  and  will  start \nsoon  for  another  one.  Tendering  has  been  completed  for  only  three  projects  and  the  slow \nprogress has been attributable to (i) the lack of familiarity of line ministries, their agencies, and \nlocal governments with the PPP modality and requirements of presidential regulation 67/2005, \n(ii)  a  tendency  to  underestimate  the  importance  of  project  preparation  through  bankable \nfeasibility studies and proper structuring, (iii) the preference of SOEs for the traditional business-\nto-business approach of direct negotiations, and (iv) original schedules that were too ambitious, \ngiven the complexity of PPP projects. The last factor has been aggravated by a rather long time \ntaken  to  recruit  consultants,  as  Government  procurement  committees  are  very  cautious  in \nfollowing the due process for evaluation of proposals and contract negotiations so as to avoid \nallegations of corruption.  \n \n84. \nThree model projects have been deferred or dropped. Based on the feasibility study for \nthe  Teluk  Lamong  seaport,  the  project  has  been  deferred  to  fully  utilize  the  existing  container \nfacilities in the nearby Tanjung Perak port. The study for the Kabupaten Bandung water supply \nhas  shown  that  the  project  is  not  financially  feasible  as  a PPP.  The  Kota  Dumai  water  supply \nproject  has  been  postponed  for  the  time  being  because  of  problems  with  raw  water  supply. \nHowever, these setbacks have been more than made up for by BAPPENAS\u2019s efforts to socialize \nthe  PSP  framework  and  PPP  modality  through  meetings  and  workshops,  both  nationally  and \nregionally.  These  efforts,  which  will  continue  with  PDF  support  under  subprogram  3,  have \nresulted in the current pipeline of 21 active projects\u20147 model and 14 others\u2014that are listed in \nAppendix 7.30  \n \n85. \nThe  Government  has  requested  that  the  IRSDP  and  IDPL  policy  matrixes  be \nharmonized  in  terms  of  project-related  triggers.  The  IDPL  was  designed  2  years  after  the \nIRSDP, when the various obstacles to, and delays in, the model PPP projects were becoming \nevident.  Learning  from  this  experience  and  further  assessing  the  complexity  of  the  enabling \nenvironment  for  PSP  both  in  Indonesia  and  other  countries,  the  Government  and  its \ndevelopment  partners  have  concluded  that  progress  on  greater  sustainable  PSP  will  require \nmore thorough project preparation and flexibility in project selection than previously anticipated. \nWhile  completion  of  prefeasibility  and  feasibility  studies  and  tendering  for  all  10  model  PPP \nprojects were originally envisaged under subprogram 2 of the IRSDP, the IDPL 2 triggers call for \nthe initiation of feasibility studies for 10 PPP projects, and of tendering for two of them, without \ndistinguishing between the model and other projects but in full compliance with the presidential \nregulation 67/2005 requirements. Under IDPL 4, financial closure is to be achieved in 2010 for \ntwo  PPP  projects.  These  more  realistic  targets  have  been  incorporated  in  the  policy  matrix \nattached to the Government\u2019s letter of development policy in Appendix 6. In terms of feasibility \nstudies, the target has been exceeded by completing such studies for 10 projects and starting \nthem for another two. A tendering process fully consistent with presidential regulation 67/2005 \nhas  started  for  4  toll  roads  and  for  the  Central  Java  coal-fired  power  plant,  which  is  the  most \nprominent among the model PPP projects, will commence early 2009.31  \n \nE. \n\nSummary of Implementation Progress  \n\n \n\n86. \nIn its original form in 2006, the IRSDP policy matrix consisted of 69 actions with a total \nof  215  specific  outputs  (subprogram  1  had  63  outputs,  subprogram  2  had  99  outputs  and \nsubprogram 3 had 53 outputs). The imbalance between subprogram 2 and subprogram 3 was \n                                                 \n30 In addition to the projects in Appendix 7 that follow presidential regulation 67/2005, there is a large number of PPP \ntransactions  dating  back  to  the  pre-IRSDP  period,  a  significant  portion  of  which  were  directly  negotiated. \nConstruction has begun on over $2 billion of these projects, including power plants, toll roads, and water treatment \nplants.  A  few  short  sections  of  toll  roads  and  small  bulk  water  treatment  plants  totaling  almost  $90  million  have \nalready begun operation. \n\n31 The feasibility study for this  project is approaching completion  by the International Finance Corporation,  which is \n\nalso providing advisory services for the transaction execution. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n27\n\nrecognized  in  paras.  31  and  69  of  the  previous  report  and  recommendation  of  the  president \n(footnote  13),  which  indicated  that  this  would  be  monitored  and  adjusted  as  necessary  during \nimplementation  of  subprogram  2  and  subprogram  3.  During  the  review  missions  in  May\u2013June \n2007  and  April  2008,32  and  the  appraisal  mission  in  September  2008,  the  policy  matrix  was \nrevised based on discussions with the various government ministries and agencies. In addition, \nthe  subprogram  2  period  was  extended  by  3  months  up  to  the  end  of  September  2008  to \nsynchronize the IRSDP with IDPL 2, and a similar extension was made for subprogram 3. The \nrevised policy matrix is given in Appendix 6 and summarized in Table 4.  \n \nThe  IRSDP  design  has  proved  to  be  quite  resilient,  and  appropriate  for  the  type  of \n87. \nreforms  pursued.  Without  affecting  the  overall  thrust  of  the  IRSDP,  11  outputs  were  dropped \nbecause  they  have  either  been  de-linked  from  the  IRSDP  or  are  covered  by  other  outputs \n(Appendix  8).  At  the  same  time,  10  new  outputs  were  added,  taking  into  account  changing \ncircumstances.33  The  project-related  outputs  were  aligned  with  the  IDPL  triggers  (para.  85),34 \nand  the  description  of  several  other  outputs  was  modified  to  better  reflect  their  actual  nature. \nConsidering  changing  priorities,  some  outputs  were  deferred  from  SP2  to  SP3,  and  others \nadvanced  from  SP3  to  SP2.  The  majority  of  the  deferred  outputs  are  likely  to  be  completed \nbefore  mid-2009,  such  as  the  drafting  of  the  laws  on  road  traffic  and  transportation  and \nelectricity,  which  were  completed  quite  some  time  ago,  but  intergovernmental  discussions  are \ntaking longer than expected. Regarding PPP projects, positive results are already beginning to \nshow, with three of the model projects already tendered to be followed by tendering for at least \n4 new toll roads and the 1,200 MW coal-fired plant in Central Java. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of the Revised Policy Matrix \n\n \n \n\nSector \n\n \n \nActions \n\nCross-Sector \nLand Transportation \nRailways \nSea Transportation \nAir Transportation \nRoads \nPower \nOil and Gas \nTelecommunications \nWater Supply and Sanitation \nProject Transactions \n\n8 \n6 \n6 \n6 \n7 \n7 \n8 \n5 \n5 \n8 \n4 \n70 \n\nOutputs \n\nSub-\nprogram 1 \n(Jan 05\u2013  \nSep 06) \n21 \n3 \n0 \n5 \n4 \n10 \n3 \n6 \n3 \n5 \n3 \n63 \n\nSub-\nprogram 2 \n(Oct 06\u2013  \nSep 08) \n13 \n6 \n5 \n5 \n5 \n8 \n6 \n5 \n3 \n11 \n7 \n74 \n\nSub-\nprogram 3 \n(Oct 08\u2013 \nSep 10) \n11 \n7 \n10 \n4 \n4 \n7 \n11 \n4 \n4 \n10 \n5 \n77 \n\n \nTotal \nOutputs \n\n45 \n16 \n15 \n14 \n13 \n25 \n20 \n15 \n10 \n26 \n15 \n214 \n\nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nTable  4  shows  that  (i)  with  74  completed  outputs,  the  reform  momentum  has  been \n 88. \nmaintained  during  subprogram  2,  (ii)  significant  progress  has  been  made  both  in  cross-sector \nand sector-specific reforms, and (iii) none of the sectors is lagging behind.

Thus, subject to \napproval of subprogram 2 by the Board in November 2008, subprogram 3 could be brought for \nthe  Board\u2019s  consideration  in  the  second  half  of  2010.  The  Government  continues  to  strongly \nsupport  the  program  cluster  approach,  as  it  provides  much  greater  flexibility  and  facilitates \nmedium-term  planning.  This  flexibility,  and  the  fact  that  the  processing  of  subprogram  2  and \nsubprogram  3  is  effectively  embedded  into  the  loan  review  process,  reduces  the  transaction \ncosts  both  for  the  Government  and  ADB  by  avoiding  rigid  policy  conditions  built  into \nmultitranche  programs.  These  conditions  have  frequently  led  to  delays  in  the  past  because  of \npolitical economy factors beyond the Government\u2019s control. \n  \n90. \nSubprogram  2  is  a  continuation  of  subprogram  1,  and  its  policy  content  in  terms  of \nactions and outputs is comparable. A loan of $280 million is proposed, compared with the CSP \nallocation of $200 million. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum; conversion options that may \nbe  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nconversion  guidelines;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  program \nloan agreement. The Government has given ADB (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  this  choice  was  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nThe loan size complements the strength of the policy package, its development impact, \n91. \nthe importance of the sectors covered, and the Government\u2019s overall financing needs. Table 5 \nshows  budget  allocations \ntotaling  about  \nRp17.4 trillion, or $1.9 billion. This does not include PSO subsidies, which consist of the annual \nPLN subsidy of Rp60 trillion ($6.5 billion) plus about Rp2 trillion ($0.2 billion) for sectors other \nthan power. A significant part of the PLN subsidy and all of the subsidies to the sectors other \nthan  power  are  directed  at  increasing  access  to  infrastructure  services  and  making  them \naffordable for the poor.  \n\nIRSDP-related  costs \n\nin  2008  and  2009 \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n29\n\nTable 5: Budget Allocation for Government Obligations \n(Rp billion) \n \n\n2009 \nItem \nGovernment Investment Centera \n1,000 \n0 \nIndonesia Infrastructure Fund \n0 \nQatar Investment Fund \n2,800 \nLand Acquisition Fund \n2,000 \nLand Capping \n1,000 \nPLN Guarantees \n1,000 \nSOE Restructuring Guarantees \n2,100 \nPDAM Debt Restructuring \n        Total \n9,900 \nPDAM = regional water supply enterprise, PLN = State Electricity Corporation, SOE =  \nstate-owned enterprise.        \na A supervisory, regulatory, and operational body created under the Directorate General  \nof Treasury to oversee government investment, mainly for infrastructure. \n\n2008\n1,050\n1,000\n1,500\n1,444\n745\n300\n1,500\n0\n7,539\n\n  Source: Ministry of Finance. \n\n \n92. \n  The  World  Bank  is  considering  the  same  loan  amount  for  its  IDPL  2  as  for  IDPL  1, \nnamely,  $200  million.35  The  Government  of  Japan  plans  to  cofinance  subprogram  2  with  \n$100 million, as it did for subprogram 1. In terms of its overall financing requirements in 2008, \nthe Government has sought about $2.8 billion in program loans from its three main development \npartners. This reflects a projected fiscal deficit of 1.8% of GDP in 2008 (compared with 1.2% in \n2007), which is close to the 1.7% deficit in the original budget, but lower than the 2.1% deficit in \nthe  revised  budget.  The  program  lending  support  will  assist  the  Government  in  meeting  the \nreform-related costs as well as its overall financing requirements. \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\nremains \n\nBAPPENAS \n\nthe  Executing  Agency \n\n93. \nthe \nimplementation of the IRSDP. KKPPI, chaired by the coordinating minister for economic affairs, \noversees  the  implementation  and  provides  guidance  and  direction  to  the  line  ministries  in \ncharge  of  the  various  infrastructure  sectors,  which  acts  as  the  Implementing  Agencies. \nImplementation  of  the  policy  actions  are  being  coordinated  with  other  agencies,  SOEs,  and \nBUMDs that are in charge of infrastructure provision.  \n \n\nfor  coordinating \n\nresponsible \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n94. \nThe implementation period for subprogram 2 is from 1 October 2006 to 30 September \n2008. All actions included in the policy matrix under subprogram 2 have been completed during \nthis time frame.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n95. \n  The  subprogram  2  loan  of  $280  million  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding  the  items  specified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  9)  and  imports \n\n                                                 \n35 The original 16 triggers for IDPL 2 have been reduced to nine, with the remaining seven deferred to 2009 under the \n\nnew IDPL 3. By contrast, subprogram 2 now has 74 outputs with some deferred to subprogram 3.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n  \n\nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement  procedures  for  program  loans,36  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed to the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, if the value of \nIndonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the \namount of the loan disbursed during the given year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  with  its  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will  be  required.  All  goods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB  member \ncountries will be procured with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with \nthe  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international  commodity  market  will  be \nprocured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption \n\nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy37  (1998  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \n96. \ndiscussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project.   In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. All relevant ADB \nguidelines\u2014including  the  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the  loan \nregulations\u2014were  specifically  brought  to  the  notice  of  the  Government.  The  Government  has \nconsiderably strengthened its anticorruption efforts in the past few years. Procurement reforms \nhave been under way for some time, resulting in competitive and relatively transparent selection \nof bidders by the public sector. The PSP regulatory framework, adopted as part of the IRSDP, \nsets  out  clear  guidelines  for  the  selection  of  private  sector  sponsors.  KKPPI  is  tasked  with \nensuring  that  the  tendering  processes  are  fair  and  transparent.  Furthermore,  the  president  of \nIndonesia  has  considerably  enhanced \nthe  Anti-Corruption \nCommission  and  other  law  enforcement  agencies  to  deal  effectively  with  corruption.  These \nsteps are already having an impact. \n \n\nthe  profile  and  visibility  of \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n97. \n  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  the  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment  will  open  or  nominate  a  deposit  account  at  Bank  Indonesia  (Indonesian  Central \nBank) to receive the loan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated on \nterms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\n98. \nAs  the  IRSDP  covers  eight  sectors,  close  to  20  line  ministries  and  agencies,  and  a \nnumber  of  SOEs  and  BUMDs,  technical  coordination  and  progress  monitoring  have  been \ncritical.  In  line  with  its  mandate,  KKPPI  has  coordinated,  leveraged,  and  monitored  reform \nprogress within the broader context of the infrastructure policy package, presidential instructions \n6/2007 and 5/2008 (para. 13). The line ministries, as implementing agencies, have reported on \n                                                 \n36 ADB. 1998.

With TA support (footnote 9), the BAPPENAS \npart  of  the  KKPPI  secretariat  strengthened  the  reporting  system  and  assisted  in  resolving \nproblems and facilitating implementation of pending or delayed actions. The KKPPI secretariat\u2019s \nmonitoring  outcomes  have  been  reported  to  the  principal  development  partners  and  other \nstakeholders.  \n  \n99. \n  BAPPENAS, ADB, and JICA jointly reviewed implementation of subprogram 2 in May\u2013\nJune  2007  and  April  2008.  Findings  from  the  reviews,  which  consisted  of  separate  meetings \nwith each concerned ministry and agency38 followed by a wrap-up meeting chaired by the two \nKKPPI secretaries have been utilized in ensuring continuity and sustained progress of reforms, \nand  making  the  necessary  mid-term  corrections.  Joint  semi-annual  reviews  of  the  overall \nProgram  performance  shall  be  undertaken  by  BAPPENAS  with  ADB  during  SP3.  BAPPENAS \nwill  continue  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the  ongoing  IRSDP,  including  consultations  with  central \nand regional authorities, infrastructure sector participants, civil society, and other stakeholders. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts \n\n100. \n \n\nThe key economic, social, and institutional benefits expected from the IRSDP are \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nsustained progress in meeting the Government\u2019s medium-term economic growth \nobjectives, as articulated in the RPJM for 2004\u20132009; \nimprovements  in  the  investment  climate,  to  be  demonstrated  by  sound  policy, \nlegal, and institutional frameworks in the infrastructure sectors; \ngreater potential for PSP, and a more systematic approach for implementing PPP \ntransactions; \npreparation and implementation of quality infrastructure projects in a transparent \nand  expedient  manner,  resulting  in  (a)  improved  availability  and  quality  of \ninfrastructure services; (b) a boost to Indonesia\u2019s competitiveness with regard to \nits regional neighbors; and (c) lower poverty incidence, through direct as well as \nindirect transmission channels; \nsustained engagement by ADB in the policy dialogue with the Government on the \ndirection  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic,  structural,  and \ninstitutional reform agenda in the broader area of investment climate; the IRSDP \nprovides  for  policy  continuity  and  consistency  in  areas  where  ADB  has  been \nactively involved; and \naid harmonization and parallel financing by the key development partners around \na common policy framework and dialogue, and the positive externalities resulting \nfrom such a joint endorsement of the Government\u2019s reform agenda. \n\n \nInstitutional. The IRSDP is strengthening the key institutions dealing with infrastructure \n101. \ndevelopment  in  Indonesia.  At  the  national  level,  KKPPI,  its  secretariat,  and  the  RMU  are \nevolving  into  strong  institutions  that  coordinate  central  support  for  PSP  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment. The PPP unit at the central level will provide further support for the development \nof  infrastructure  projects  covering  all  sectors.  Within  each  infrastructure  sector,  the  regulatory \nbodies will be strengthened over the medium term by enhancing their autonomy, clarifying their \nmandate,  and  providing  adequate  resources  for  their  operations.  The  capacity  to  prepare  and \nexecute  bankable  projects  is  being  systematically  built  up.  The  Government  is  developing \n\n                                                 \n38 For example, there were 20 such meetings in April 2008, during which progress was discussed in detail based on \n\nthe policy matrix, and measures were agreed to resolve problems and expedite implementation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\n  \n\nimpacts \n\ninclude  social  dislocation  and \n\ninstitutions such as the IIFF and Guarantee Fund to support infrastructure financing. In addition \nto this, the existing domestic financial institutions are being strengthened.  \n \n102.  Social. The IRSDP\u2019s main contribution is to improve the investment climate and thereby \ncontribute  directly  to  poverty  reduction  through  greater  access  to  markets,  and  economic  and \nemployment  opportunities.  The  policy  reforms  are  intended  to  lead  to  increased  infrastructure \ninvestments by the public and private sectors. On balance, the poverty and social impacts of the \nreforms  and  ensuing  investments  will  be  positive,  through  the  benefits  of  induced  economic \ngrowth  and  the  improved  provision  of  infrastructure  services.  The  May  2008  increases  in \ndomestic oil prices have freed up additional funds for more pro-poor spending. The Government \nis  reviewing  tariff  policies  in  all  sectors  and  adopting  tariff  regimes  that  are  in  line  with  cost-\nrecovery  principles.  At  the  same  time,  the  impact  of  tariff  increases  on  the  poor  is  mitigated \nthrough  appropriate  measures,  and  the  PSO  framework  is  being  strengthened  to  effectively \ndeliver  essential  infrastructure  services.  The  adoption  of  market-based  pricing  promotes  PSP, \nwhich  in  turn  leads  to  greater  tax  and  non-tax  revenues  and  additional  employment \nopportunities.  Potential  negative \ninadequate \ncompensation for land acquisition. The Government has established the Land Working Group to \ndeal  with  issues  of  land  zoning  and  purchase  of  land  in  anticipation  of  future  infrastructure \ndevelopments.  The  Government  is  also  considering  alternative  approaches  to  provide  speedy \ncompensation and enhance administrative accountability through transparent dispute resolution \nmechanisms. Overall, the IRSDP is leading to significant social benefits. Appendix 10 presents \na summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \n103.  Economic. The IRSDP reforms are expected to have short- and long-term net benefits. \nThese include a reduced fiscal burden from the gradual fuel subsidy removal and improved cost \nrecovery  in  all  infrastructure  sectors.  The  PSO  policy  framework  provides  the  basis  for  better \ntargeting  of  infrastructure  service  provision,  connectivity,  and  access  for  low-income  groups. \nThe PDAM debt restructuring program will reverse the decline in service quality and coverage of \nwater  supply  and  sanitation.  PLN  restructuring  and  tariff  revisions  will  lower  the  Government \nsubsidy while improving PLN\u2019s efficiency. Passage of the Law on Electricity will pave the way for \nmedium-  to  long-term  improvements  in  electricity  supply  and  efficiency  as  the  conditions  for \nprivate  sector  investment  improve  and  subsequent  investment  in  generation  increases,  in  turn \nimproving  the  overall  investment  climate.  The  introduction  of  independent  transport  and  utility \nregulators  in  the  longer  term  will  remove  government  interference  in  utility  operations  and \npricing, providing the basis for improved efficiencies. Economic benefits are expected to accrue \nfrom  improved  quality  of  existing  roads  through  better  road  maintenance  and  vehicle  load \ncontrol  and  expanded  road  networks,  by  improving  access  to  markets  and  other  forms  of \nconnectivity, and lowering vehicle operating costs. Major general economic benefits will accrue \nto  the  entire  Indonesian  population  through  the  expanded  scope  and  improved  quality  of \ninfrastructure services. \n  \nThe  rigorous  project  preparation,  screening,  bidding,  and  contracting  processes  will \n104. \nenhance  the  direct  and  indirect  economic  impacts  of  individual  project  transactions.  Line \nministries  and  other  agencies  are  paying  greater  attention  to  determining  the  expected \neconomic and financial rates of return and assessing the benefits of proposed projects prior to \ntheir  approval.  This  helps  select  investments  with  higher  economic  returns  while  being \nfinancially  attractive  to  private  service  providers,  or  viable  to  public  providers.  Through  its \nsecretariat, KKPPI reviews the financial and economic analyses for all proposed PPP projects. \nThe  IRSDP  provides  support  to  the  KKPPI  secretariat  in  this  regard,  and  ensures  that  sound \nassessments  are  carried  out  and  the  economic  benefits  are  highlighted.  Overall  progress  in \nstructural  reforms  and  in  removing  infrastructure  bottlenecks  will  improve  the  private  sector \nenabling  environment  and  medium-  to  long-term  growth  prospects,  while  significant  near-term \n\n \n\n\f \n\n33\n\ninvestments in infrastructure construction leveraged by the IRSDP boost capital formation and \ngenerate related employment and business for the construction industry.   \n \n105.  Resettlement,  Indigenous  People,  and  the  Environment.  Presidential  regulations \n36/2005 and 65/2006 recognize traditional communal land ownership (Hak Ulayat) and usufruct \nrights.  In  line  with  the  regulatory  provisions,  the  rights  of  indigenous  peoples  will be  upheld  in \nthe  case  of  any  land  acquisition  involving  them.  These  provisions  are  in  conformity  with \nrequirements  outlined  in  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  Most  of  the  reforms \nsupported by the IRSDP help improve environmental outcomes through better sanitation, higher \nelectricity prices to promote energy conservation, promotion of recycling, and sanitary landfills. \nBased on a desk review, the IRSDP measures are unlikely to have any adverse environmental \nimpacts.  Further,  while  the  IRSDP  facilitates  the  preparation  and  tendering  of  several  model \nPPP  projects,  it  does  not  provide  any  investment  support  to  such  projects.  Nonetheless,  the \nGovernment,  through  KKPPI,  will  ensure  that  all  social  and  environmental  safeguards  are \ncomplied  with  in  line  with  the  prevailing  laws  and  regulations.  Any  projects  to  receive  ADB \nfinancing must comply with all of ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguards requirements, as \ninvestment in this sector may lead to possible negative environmental impacts.  \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n106.  Government Commitment. The political commitment could possibly waver because of \ninternal  disagreements  over  policy  directions,  or  because  the  entire  Government  may  change \nafter the elections in 2009. The majority of opinions within the current Government confirm the \nnotion that the Government remains strongly committed to the reform program embodied in the \nIRSDP and the complementing IDPL program. The 2009 elections pose only a moderate risk of \nweakened  commitment  and  a  loss  of  the  reform  momentum,  as  even  with  a  change  of \nGovernment,  the  new  leaders  are  expected  to  continue  focusing  on  economic  growth  and \npoverty  reduction  to  ensure  a  sound  tenure  in  office  and  mitigate  social  and  political  unrest. \nHowever, should the new Government not be committed to maintaining the reform momentum, \nsubprogram 3 could be delayed or cancelled.  \n \n107.  Government  Coordination.  At  times,  the  progress  of  infrastructure  reforms  has  been \nimpeded by poor coordination among government ministries and agencies, and competing and \nconflicting interests of various stakeholders. While full and effective coordination and reforms in \ncertain  sectors  may  take  time  to  evolve  and  needs  further  consensus  building,  the  essential \nsteps taken thus far will have a demonstrational effect in supporting infrastructure development \nin a coordinated manner in the coming years.   \n \n108.  Government Capacity. While the Government remains committed to reform objectives, \nthe ability to translate that commitment into practical reform achievements is subject to available \ncapacity within the different government ministries and agencies. In several areas, progress has \nbeen slower than was anticipated by the Government when the IRSDP was agreed upon. This \nhas  typically  been  the  result  of  low  capacity,  compounded  by  weak  coordination.  Mitigation \nstrategies  include  realistic  outputs  and  schedules  based  on  likely  reform  progress,  and \ncontinued provision of TA for capacity building. \n \n109.  Poor Governance and Corruption. With the high stakes involved in large infrastructure \nprojects  in  several  sectors,  the  IRSDP  may  face  significant  impediments  in  the  form  of  weak \ngovernance,  collusion,  and  corruption,  or  lack  of  judicial  capacity  to  enforce  good-governance \nmeasures.  In  particular,  despite  the  commendable  rigid  stance  taken  by  MOF,  risks  of \nmisallocation of scarce public resources could still be encountered during the transition period, \nleading  to  government  support  for  directly  negotiated  projects  or  projects  that  do  not  meet  all \nrelevant  criteria  for  such  support.  However,  during  the  last  few  years  the  Government  has \nconsiderably strengthened its anticorruption efforts. Procurement reforms have been under way \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\n  \n\n \n\nfor  some  time,  resulting  in  a  competitive  and  transparent  selection  of  bidders  by  the  public \nsector. The PSP legal framework sets out clear rules for the selection of private sector sponsors \nfor  PPP  projects.  KKPPI  is  tasked  with  ensuring  that  tendering  processes  are  fair  and \ntransparent. The president of Indonesia has considerably enhanced the profile and activities of \nthe Anti-Corruption Commission and other law enforcement agencies. These steps are already \nhaving a significant impact.    \n\n110.    Economic Stability. Domestic macroeconomic volatility, adverse global events such as \nhigh oil and food prices, natural disasters, or the lack of sustained momentum on policy reforms \ncould impede PSP. However, over the last few years, the Indonesian economy has been quite \nresilient to domestic and external shocks, and the Government\u2019s macroeconomic policies have \nbeen sound. There is a risk of an adverse market reaction to growing expenditures on energy \nsubsidies. Indonesia has considerable gross financing needs and the cost of meeting these will \nalmost certainly go up if outlays on oil subsidies and budgetary financing needs continue to go \nup.  In  such  an  environment,  a  sharp  deterioration  in  global  economic  conditions  could  make \nIndonesia particularly vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment, possibly triggering rapid \ncapital outflows and raising the risks of broader financial sector disruption.  \n \n111.  Social Tensions. Tariff reforms are sensitive in any environment, and Indonesia is no \nexception.  As  the  country  is  gradually  moving  away  from  administered  prices  and  tariffs  for \ninfrastructure  products  and  services,  social  tensions  are  inevitable.  However,  the  Government \nhas  so  far  been  successful  in  reducing  such  tensions  by  the  two-pronged  approach  of  (i) \ncomprehensively  socializing  any  planned  price  and  tariff  increases,  and  (ii)  using  the  savings \nfrom the reduction in inefficient subsidies for  direct poverty reduction, employment generation, \nand rural infrastructure development. \n \n\n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n112. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nCounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the subprogram 2 loan will be \nused  to  finance  the  development  needs  as  outlined  under  the  subprogram  2 \nimplementation arrangements. \nThe  policies  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  subprogram  2  loan \nagreement, as described in the letter of development policy (including the policy \nmatrix), will continue to be in effect for the duration of the IRSDP and thereafter. \nThe  studies  and  technical  designs  prepared  for  the  PPP  projects  will  broadly \ncomply with all relevant ADB requirements, policies, and guidelines. \n\n(iv)  Recommendations  resulting  from  the  work  done  under  the  technical  assistance \n(footnote 9) will be implemented to the fullest extent possible, and within a timely \nmanner. \nAll necessary counterpart funds for program implementation will be provided fully \nand in a timely manner \n\n(v) \n\nVIII.

domestic freight and interurban passenger land \ntravel,  linking  communities  and  markets  throughout  the country,  their coverage  and  condition  are \ncrucial to supporting economic growth and social development. Yet the arterial roads along major \ntrade  and  commercial  corridors  are  becoming  congested,1  and  the  regional  roads  have  a  low \ndensity.2 The network comprises only about 650 kilometers (km) of high-grade toll roads, of which \nmore than 75% was constructed and is operated by the state-owned Jasa Marga. National roads \ntotaling  about  35,000  km  and  provincial  roads  totaling  about  37,000  km  are  in  relatively  good \ncondition, but district and urban roads with a combined length of about 267,000 km are mostly in \npoor condition, and almost 50% of them are unpaved, thus restricting all-season access.  \n \n2. \nWhile investments in road network upgrading and expansion were substantial in the 1980s \nand  1990s,  sector  expenditures  decreased  sharply  after  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis,  from  a \npeak of about 22% of the national budget in the mid-1990s to about 10% after 2000. As evidenced \nby their mostly reasonable condition, national arterial roads have been fairly well preserved, but the \nbacklog of investments in network improvement and extension is growing. The regional situation is \nreversed,  with  underspending  on  preservation  leading  to  greater  strains  than  underspending  on \nroad development.  \n \n3. \nThe current vehicle acquisition and ownership taxes, and fuel and other operational taxes, \nwould cover about 70% of the necessary road maintenance costs. However, proceeds from vehicle \nrevenues  vary  considerably  between  regions  and  are  treated  as  general  tax  revenues  of  local \ngovernments,  rather  than  being  allocated  to  road  preservation.  The  potential  for  financing  the \nmaintenance of road assets on a self-sustaining basis is thus not utilized. Moreover, taxes imposed \non road users have been dwarfed by subsidies received in the form of low domestic prices of motor \nfuels.  The  gradual  removal  of  fuel  subsidies  therefore  needs  to  continue,  with  a  portion  of  the \nsavings redirected to road development. While road preservation can be fully financed domestically \nthrough  restructured  road  user  charges,  additional  funds  from  the  private  sector  and  foreign \nborrowings  need  to  be  mobilized  for  road  development.  The  private  sector  can  be  engaged  in \nconstructing  and  operating  about  1,500  km  of  high-grade  toll  roads  to  provide  a  complete  trans-\nJava link and major parts of the trans-Sumatra link, while foreign borrowings should be used in an \nefficient manner for improving and extending the national arterial road network, rather than for road \npreservation. \n \nDevelopment  of  the  road  network,  particularly  toll  roads,  requires  extensive  acquisition  of \n4. \nland. Until recently, the legal framework for land acquisition was inadequate, no specific role in the \nland acquisition process was assigned to the Ministry of Public Works and its toll road contracting \nand regulatory agency, and no specific funding was allocated for this purpose.  \n \nB. \n \n5. \nAs  Indonesia  is  an  archipelago,  ports  and  airports  are  of  vital  importance  to  regional \ncooperation and integration. In particular, the maritime sector (comprising ports and shipping) is a \nkey mode of domestic and international trade and passenger travel. There are 725 public ports and \n1,478 private ports (for bulk cargo), of which 141 are classified as international ports. Twenty-five \npublic  ports  have  been  designated  by  the  Government  as  strategic  ports,  providing  the  main \n\nPorts and Airports \n\n                                                 \n1 About 50% of the arterial network in Java is already congested, increasing travel times and transport costs. Costs are \n\nfurther increased by illegal payments demanded from truck drivers at checkpoints and weigh stations. \n\n2 At 0.18 kilometers (km) per square km or 1.5 km per 1,000 people, Indonesia\u2019s overall road density is among the lowest \n\nin Southeast Asia.   \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ngateway for passengers and cargo, and handling most of the container traffic. In 2007, about 760 \nmillion tons (t) of cargo passed through the Indonesian ports. The number of passengers reached \n7.3  million  in  2006.  Cargo  traffic,  which  was  only  slightly  affected  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  is \nprojected to grow at 6% per annum in 2008 for international cargo and 4% per annum for domestic \ncargo. Sea passenger traffic declined after the crisis, and faces competition from the deregulated \nairline industry. A more moderate growth rate of 2% per annum is therefore projected. \n \n6. \nThere  are  deficiencies  in  basic  infrastructure  and  handling  equipment  in  ports.  Draft \nrestrictions  in  some  of  the  strategic  ports  inhibit  their  ability  to  receive  large  vessels  and  fully \nparticipate  in  regional  trade.  Inadequate  equipment  is  the  main  cause  of  generally  low  port \nproductivity in terms of average berth occupancy rate, turnaround time, and containerization rate. \nOverall,  operational  performance  and  service  provision  have  not  met  client  expectations  and \ninternational performance standards. In particular, performance in container terminal operations is \nconsidered  unsatisfactory  by  port  users.  Port  tariffs  are  low,  allowing  full  cost  recovery  only  in \nlarger ports. With the introduction of the International Ship and Port Security Code in July 2004, all \nIndonesian  international  ports  face  the  challenge  of  implementing  strict  security  measures,  as \nreceiving  ports  can  reject  docking  of  ships  with  cargo  from  ports  that  do  not  meet  the  code \nrequirements. \n \n7. \nAir  transport  plays  a  vital  role  for  passengers,  high-value  cargo,  and  mail  by  facilitating \nmobility, generating economic activity, and providing lifeline access to remote areas, thus helping \nintegrate  the  islands  across  the  country.  There  are  186  airports  in  Indonesia,  24  of  them \ninternational.  In  2007,  air  traffic  passengers\u2014departures  and  arrivals\u2014totaled  about  54.8  million. \nThree  airports\u2014Soekarno-Hatta  in  Jakarta,  Ngurah  Rai  in  Denpasar,  and  Juanda  in  Surabaya\u2014\naccounted for more than 80% of the passenger traffic. The aviation industry suffered from losses \nafter  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  but  has  bounced  back  and  is  now  carrying  about  three  times  as \nmuch traffic as in 1990. This is attributable to lower airfares as a result of opening air transport to \nprivate operators in 1999, and increasing geographic coverage of air transport services. Long-term \nprojections  indicate  annual  growth  of  5%  for  domestic  passenger  traffic  and  6%  for  international \npassenger traffic. \n \nWhile  private  airlines  have  reacted  quickly  to  the  market  liberalization,3  the  public  sector \n8. \nhas  been  much  slower  in  expanding  airport  capacity.  Air  traffic  security  also  needs  to  be \naddressed.  Domestic  airport  tariffs  are  kept  artificially  low  and  do  not  allow  cost  recovery  for \nservices  provided  to  passengers  and  air  carriers.  As  a  result,  only  major  airports  with  significant \ninternational traffic are able to break even in their operations. The initiative for proposing increases \nin  airport  tariffs  lies  with  the  airport  operator.  However,  the  operator  is  required  to  consult  with \nusers,  local  governments,  and  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  (MOT).  Experience  with  tariff \nincreases indicates that they are difficult to implement due to strong resistance, usually expressed \nduring the consultation process. As with ports, security of strategic airports needs to be enhanced \nto deal effectively with security concerns. \n \nUntil recently, the legal framework4 has specified that management of all general ports and \n9. \nall  airports  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Government,  which  can  delegate  it  to  a  state-owned \nenterprise (SOE). Private sector participation (PSP) has been allowed only through a cooperation \nagreement  with  such  SOE.  Based  on  this  framework,  the  Government  identified  groups  of  ports \nand airports that were considered commercial (i.e., generated operating profits or had the potential \nto  do  so),  and  allocated  their  management  and  development  to  six  SOEs:  (i)  111  ports  to  four \n\n                                                 \n3 There were 14 domestic airlines in 2007. \n4  Maritime  law  21/1992,  Government  regulation  69/2001,  and  the  implementing  ministerial  decrees  53,  54,  55,  and \n56/2002 for ports; and aviation law 15/1992, Government regulation 70/2001, and the implementing ministerial decrees \n44,  45,  and  48/2002  for  airports.  This  legal  framework  is  being  replaced  by  the  recently  enacted  law  17/2008  on \nShipping and the new Law on Aviation that has been submitted to Parliament for approval. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2       41 \n\nRailways \n\nIndonesian  port  corporations  (PELINDO  I  to  IV),  and  (ii)  23  airports  to  two  airport  corporations \n(Angkasa  Pura  I  and  II).  In  reality,  these  portfolios  have  contained  a  mix  of  profitable  and \nunprofitable  assets,  arranged  in  geographic  proximity,  and  with  positive  aggregate  results.  The \nSOEs have exercised monopoly rights over the ports and airports in their portfolios, managing all \naspects of operation, development, and PSP. They have also acted as a regulator in their domain, \nsetting  tariffs  for  the  use  of  port  and  airport  infrastructure  and  for  port  and  airport  services  in \nconsultation  with  MOT.  Depending  on  the  airport,  MOT  or  Angkasa  Pura  I  or  II  has  provided  air \ntraffic control services. This fragmented approach has presented coordination and safety problems. \n \nBoth ports  and airports have good  potential for PSP, but actual PSP has so far been low \n10. \ngiven the lack of a clear and predictable regulatory and investment environment, and the lack of a \nlevel playing field providing equal access and opportunities to all investors. In the port sector, three \nof the four PELINDOs formed joint ventures with private operators. However, these deal structures, \nwith the PELINDOs acting as both landlord5 and operator, have not brought about more PSP, as \npotential investors in new port terminals are concerned about getting fair treatment from a landlord \nwith a financial stake in an existing operator. PSP in the airport sector has been very limited, and \ngenerally  taken  the  form  of  subcontracts  for  selected  terminal  services.  Another  impediment  to \nPSP has been uncertainty caused by regional autonomy legislation, which has conferred authority \nover public works, including ports and airports, to local governments.6 This has created a potential \nfor conflict with the PELINDOs and Angkasa Puras. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe railway sector is very small in international terms and relative to Indonesia\u2019s area and \npopulation. It accounts for less than 10% of the country\u2019s total passenger traffic and only 0.6% of \nits total freight traffic. Railway operations are limited to predominantly passenger services in Java \nand  three  separate  networks  in  Sumatra  that  carry  mainly  cargo  such  as  coal  and  cement.  The \ntotal rail length is less than 6,000 km (mainly single-track route-km), of which about one-quarter is \nnot  in  operating  condition.  Most  railway  assets  are  old  and  deteriorating  (e.g.,  over  two-thirds  of \nserviceable  rolling  stock  is  more  than  20  years  old).  Despite  that,  the  average  utilization  of  labor \nand infrastructure is higher than in Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n \n12. \nUntil  recently,  the  Government  through  MOT  has  been  responsible  for  sector  policy  and \nplanning,  regulation,  and  provision  of  basic  infrastructure  such  as  rail  tracks  and  signaling,  while \nthe fully state-owned Indonesian Railway Corporation (KAI) has had the mandate to operate and \nmaintain the infrastructure and provide all rail transport services.7 PSP has been allowed through a \ncooperation  agreement  with  KAI,  but  none  has  materialized.  Since  2000,  KAI  has  experienced \ndeclining and then stagnating demand due to low competitiveness of rail in relation to road, air, and \nferry  services.  Although  reporting  small  profits,  its  real  profitability  has  been  obscured  by  poorly \nimplemented  funding  arrangements,  as  KAI  operates  within  a  complex  web  of  subsidies,  public \nservice obligation (PSO) arrangements, contracts with other SOEs, and caps on its economy-class \npassenger fares. \n \nD. \n \nAlthough  the  state-owned  monopoly,  the  State  Electricity  Corporation  (PLN),  connected \n13. \nabout 32 million new customers to its system between 1974 and 2004 (i.e., an average of almost 1 \n\nPower \n\n                                                 \n5 Landlord port model is where the port authority owns all the assets and then leases them out to the private operators.  \n6  Law  on  regional  autonomy  22/1999,  Government  regulation  25/2000,  and  the  revised  law  on  regional  autonomy \n32/2004.  Government  regulations  69/2001  and  70/2001,  issued  to  clarify  the  responsibilities  of  local  governments, \nPELINDOs, and Angkasa Puras, have not achieved the desired result. \n\n7  Based  on  law  13/1992  on  railways  and  the  related  implementing  regulations,  in  particular  the  Government  regulation \n69/1998  on  Train  Traffic  and  Transportation.  This  legal  framework  is  being  replaced  by  the  new  law  23/2007  on \nrailways and four new Government regulations drafted by MOT. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nmillion  per  year),  the  electrification  ratio  of  67%  is  still  low  by  regional  standards.8  More  than  70 \nmillion people lack access to electricity, and about two-thirds of them live outside of Java and Bali \nwhere  the  cost  of  power  supply  is  substantially  higher.  Because  of  the  uniform  tariff  structure \nprevailing  in  Indonesia,  PLN  is  losing  money  with  every  residential  customer  it  connects  outside \nthe Java-Bali grid. Given the potentially huge number of such consumers, there are limits to cross \nsubsidization  by  other  consumer  categories.  Rural  electrification  thus  runs  counter  to  PLN\u2019s \nobligation as an SOE to make a profit.9 The implication is that the Government\u2019s ambitious target of \nproviding electricity to 90% of the population by 2020 will be difficult to achieve with the business-\nas-usual approach.10 A new rural electrification strategy needs to be developed and implemented, \nbased  on  innovative  decentralized  models  for  design,  financing,  implementation,  and  operation. \nLocal  development  utilities,  either  in  the  form  of  a  cooperative  or  a  partnership  between  a  local \ngovernment-owned  enterprise  (BUMD)  and  a  private  service  provider,  are  a  promising  approach \nthat  can  be  best  pursued  through  a  combination  of  centralized  planning  and  coordination,  and \ndecentralized implementation. \n \n14. \nThe  Asian  financial  crisis  resulted  in  almost  no  investment  in  power  generation  between \n1998  and  2004.  As  a  result,  PLN\u2019s  current  installed  capacity  of  about  24,000  megawatts  (MW), \nincluding about 4,000 MW contracted from independent power producers (IPPs), is insufficient to \nmeet  peak  demand  outside  the  main  grid  of  Java-Bali  and  leaves  an  inadequate  reserve  margin \nwithin the grid so that any unplanned power plant outage leads to load shedding. Because of the \ngradual removal of fuel subsidies, operation of the many captive, mostly diesel, power plants11 has \nbecome  too  costly.  Power  demand  is  projected  to  grow  at  an  annual  rate  of  7%\u20139%  through  to \n2013. To meet the pent-up demand and displace high-cost oil-based generation that is the primary \ncause  of  PLN\u2019s  sharply  deteriorated  financial  position,  a  fast-track  10,000  MW  program  of  coal-\nfired  power  plants  is  under  implementation.  The  program,  which  is  mostly  financed  by  export \ncredits,  domestic  banks,  and  international  bonds  issued  by  PLN,  is  scheduled  for  completion  by \n2010. In addition, PLN has a program for another 10,000 MW in IPP projects, mostly coal-fired and \ngeothermal, that are being put up for tendering in a staged manner.  \n \nThe  Electricity  Law  20/2002  provided  a  progressive  long-term  vision  for  power  sector \n15. \nrestructuring  by  unbundling  PLN,  independent  regulation,  competition,  and  PSP.  However,  in \nDecember  2004,  the  Constitutional  Court  annulled  this  law  on  the  grounds  that  its  provisions  for \nunbundling  and  competition  violated  the  1945  Constitution.  The  annulment  was  based  on \ninterpreting the constitutional requirement for state control of important branches of production as \nan obligation for the Government and SOEs to act as owners and managers. The annulment has \nbeen  a  serious  setback  for  power  sector  reforms,  with  potentially  far-reaching  consequences  for \nsector efficiency and financial sustainability, as well as investor confidence. A new draft electricity \nlaw is undergoing deliberations in Parliament. Some members of Parliament, the Ministry of State-\nOwned  Enterprises,  and  key  stakeholders  (e.g.,  industry  and  trade  associations,  community \ngroups,  and  academics)  have  recommended  splitting  PLN  into  several  entities  and  revoking  its \nmonopoly  rights.  The  generally  held  view  is  that  the  new  law  should  allow  for  more  participation \nfrom regional governments (e.g., by creating municipal utilities), the private sector, and community \nassociations. \n \n\n                                                 \n8 Other estimates indicate only 57%, but that seems to be too low. \n9   Law 19/2003 on state-owned enterprises. \n10  The  average  annual  growth  rate  in  the  number  of  PLN  customers  of  11.1%  during  the  past  30  years  has  been \nimpressive. However, two different patterns of growth occurred: 15.3% per year before the 1997 Asian financial crisis \nand  6.4%  per  year  thereafter.  The  sharply  lower  postcrisis  growth  has  been  attributable  to  funding  constraints  and \nPLN\u2019s profit-making obligation. \n\n11  Approximately  10,000  companies  maintain  their  own  sources  of  power,  mostly  to  mitigate  the  risks  of  grid  supply \noutages. The combined installed capacity of these captive power plants is estimated at 13,000\u201315,000 MW, or almost \nhalf of PLN\u2019s total capacity.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2       43 \n\nThrough  a  series  of  electricity  tariff  increases,12  renegotiation  of  IPP  contracts,13  loan \n16. \nrestructuring,  government  subsidies,14  and  efficiency  improvements,  PLN  managed  to  overcome \nthe disastrous effects of the Asian financial crisis and gradually reduce its loss to Rp2.0 trillion in \n2004. However, the fuel subsidy removal in 2005 has had a major negative impact on the financial \nperformance of PLN, which uses diesel oil for almost 20% of its generation. As PLN was unable to \npass  the  sharp  oil  price  increases  on  to  its  customers,  government  subsidies  surged  to  Rp12.5 \ntrillion in 2005, Rp34.8 trillion in 2006, and Rp43.4 trillion in 2007. In the last 2 years, customers in \nall tariff categories were subsidized. In 2008 the subsidy is projected to reach Rp60.3 trillion as it is \nthe first time the average tariff does not even cover fuel costs.15  \n \n17. \n Electricity  tariffs,  which  are  set  by  a  presidential  decree,  are  highly  politicized.  For  IPPs, \nthis  raises  the  issue  of  the  credit  risk  of  PLN.  The  Government  has  responded  to  demands  for \nguarantees against this risk by referring to law 19/2003 on state-owned enterprises, according to \nwhich  the  Government  can  assign  a  special  task  to  an  SOE  to  manage  a  function  for  the  public \nbenefit. If the special task is not financially viable, the Government must provide compensation to \nthe  SOE.  In  PLN\u2019s  case,  the  special  task  is  the  provision  of  electricity  to  all  customer  groups  at \ntariffs  determined  by  the  Government  and  set  uniformly  across  Indonesia.  In  recognition  of  this \nPSO  assigned  to  PLN,  the  Government  has  been  compensating  it  for  the  losses  incurred  in \nimplementing it. The Ministry of Finance specifies the procedure for calculation and payment of the \nsubsidy on an annual basis in a ministerial regulation.  \n \nE. \n \n18. \nIndonesia  has  the  largest  proven  natural  gas  reserves  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region, \naccounting  for  about  8%  of  the  world\u2019s  total  proven  reserves,  and  is  the  world\u2019s  second-largest \nliquefied  natural  gas  exporter  from  the  fields  in  Aceh  and Kalimantan.  Despite  that,  the  domestic \nuse  of  natural  gas  has  been  limited  for  two  reasons:  (i)  the  abundance  of  cheap  oil  until  a  few \nyears  ago,  and  (ii)  the  lack  of  clarity  regarding  the  legal  and  regulatory  environment  and  poor \nincentives  in  terms  of  return  on  investment  hampered  expansion  in  current  production-sharing \ncontracts  and  new  gas  field  exploration.  Several  recent  developments  have  set  the  stage  for \nnatural  gas  to  play  a  much  more  important  role  domestically:  (i)  Indonesia  has  become  a  net  oil \nimporter,  (ii)  the  gradual  fuel  subsidy  reductions  have  made  natural  gas  competitive,  and  (iii)  the \nlegal and regulatory framework has been strengthened. As a result, private investors have started \nto develop new large gas fields, and PLN aims to substantially increase the share of natural gas in \nits  generation  mix.  Major  pipeline  projects  and/or  liquefied  natural  gas  terminals  need  to  be \nimplemented to bring natural gas to the Java market. \n \nThe  Oil  and  Gas  Law  22/2001,  together  with  the  related  implementing  regulations,16 \n19. \nprovided a basis for gas sector restructuring by (i) ending the monopoly of the State Oil and Gas \n\nOil and Gas \n\n                                                 \n12  The  average  electricity  tariff  was  increased  by  29%  in  April  2000,  17%  in  July/October  2001,  and  through  quarterly \nadjustments of 6% during 2002\u20132003. These increases brought the average tariff from about $0.025 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) after the Asian financial crisis to $0.068/kWh in late 2003, a major accomplishment and proof of the successful \nsocialization by the Government of this politically sensitive issue. Since then, there have been no further increases and \nthe average tariff has slightly decreased, to $0.062/kWh, due to changes in the consumption structure. \n\n13  The renegotiations were a complex and protracted exercise with a successful final outcome. Of the 30 IPP contracts \ntotaling 11,300 MW, 14 contracts were continued under renegotiated terms, 7 contracts were terminated, 5 contracts \nwere acquired by the Government and its SOEs, 3 contracts were taken to international arbitration, and 1 contract is \nstill pending. \n\n14  The subsidies were introduced to compensate PLN for its low tariff for small consumers and amounted to Rp4.7 trillion \n\nin 2002, Rp4.1 trillion in 2003, and Rp3.5 trillion in 2004. \n\n15 The average selling price of electricity in 2008 of Rp614/kWh recovers only 56% of PLN\u2019s average production cost of \n\nRp1,092/kWh, of which Rp658/kWh is for fuel. \n\n16  The government regulations on implementing agency (BP Migas), regulatory agency (BPH Migas), corporatization of \nPertamina, upstream businesses, downstream businesses, and appointment of the head of implementing agency, as \nwell as the presidential decree on the establishment of regulatory agency, issued during 2002\u20142004.  \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nCorporation (Pertamina), both in the upstream and downstream part of the sector, (ii) establishing \nseparate  contracting  authorities  for  these  parts  (BP  Migas  and  BPH  Migas),  (iii)  introducing  the \nunbundling principle (a company which conducts business in the upstream part is prohibited from \nrunning downstream business, and vice versa), and (iv) calling for open access to gas transmission \npipelines.  Though  similar  in  its  philosophy  to  the  annulled  Electricity  Law  20/2002  (para.  15),  the \nOil  and  Gas  Law  22/2001  was  upheld  by  the  Constitutional  Court  in  December  2005,  except  for \nprovisions related to domestic market obligations, and oil and gas pricing. The Constitutional Court \nruled  that  a  minimum  allocation  for  the  domestic  market  should  be  stipulated  for  oil  and  gas \nproducers,  and  that  gas  prices  should  be  set  administratively  rather  than  be  determined  by \ncompetition.  \n \n20. \nThe  current  regulatory  arrangements  are  complex  and  may  lead  to  conflicts  of  interest, \nbecause they are partly combined with contracting. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources \nis  responsible  for  policy  making,  regulation  of  upstream  activities  and,  together  with  BPH  Migas, \nregulation of downstream activities.17 BP Migas acts as the contracting authority for upstream work \nand BPH Migas for downstream. The State Gas Corporation is the dominant player in downstream \ngas activities, having a market share of about 86% in gas transmission and 93% in gas distribution. \nIn  2003,  the  State  Gas  Corporation  successfully  completed  the  first  public\u2013private  partnership \nproject in gas transmission.18 By contrast, more recent attempts by BPH Migas to have further gas \npipelines  implemented  by  the  private  sector  have  not  been  successful  yet,  mainly  because  of \ninadequate project preparation. \n \nF. \n \n21. \nThis  sector  can  play  an  important  role  in  reducing  regional  disparities,  but  despite \nencouraging  progress  in  wireless  telecommunications,  Indonesia  is  lagging  behind  many  of  its \nneighbors in terms of access, particularly in rural and remote areas. Until recently and except for a \nfew  years  when  the  impact  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis  was  strongly  felt  across  the  country,  the \nfixed  line  service  showed  double-digit  annual  growth  since  1970.  The  total  number  of  fixed  lines \nexceeds 9 million, but given Indonesia\u2019s large population, the coverage of only about 6% is among \nthe lowest in the region.19 A large disparity exists between urban and rural areas. The six largest \ncities\u2014Bandung, Denpasar, Jakarta, Medan, Semarang, and Surabaya\u2014with less than 10% of the \ncountry\u2019s  population  account  for  almost  50%  of  all  fixed  lines.  Their  teledensity20  is  about  40%, \ncompared to less than 1% in rural areas, where two-thirds of villages still have no public phone. As \nelsewhere  in  the  region,  the  increased  rollout  of  networks,  availability  of  prepaid  services,  and \nfalling prices of handsets, have resulted in explosive growth of mobile communications since 1995. \nBetween  2005  and  2007,  the  number  of  mobile  phone  users  almost  doubled  from  48  million  (a \nteledensity  of  21%)  to  90  million  (a  teledensity  of  39%),  placing  Indonesia  above  Viet  Nam  and \nIndia, but below the other neighboring countries.21 Internet access has grown less rapidly, mainly \ndue to regulatory and bandwidth constraints. There were an estimated 20 million internet users in \n2006. With the penetration rate of about 9%, Indonesia lags behind most countries in the region.22 \n \n\nTelecommunications \n\n                                                 \n17  The regulatory role within the ministry is exercised by its Directorate General of Oil and Gas (DG Migas). \n18  PGN  created  a  subsidiary  company  for  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  Grissik\u2013Duri\u2013Batam\u2013Singapore  gas \ntransmission  pipelines  with  a  combined  length  of  about  1,000  kilometers  and  divested  a  stake  in  this  company  to  a \nstrategic investor through a competitive bidding process. The project  was supported by an Asian Development Bank \nloan of $218 million, with cofinancing of $195 million provided by the Japan International Cooperation Agency.  \n\n19 In 2005, the fixed line coverage was about 4% in the Philippines, 5% in India, 11% in Thailand, 17% in Malaysia, 19% \n\nin Viet Nam, and 27% in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n\n20 Defined as  count of main telephone lines and other connectivity means\u2019 for a particular area. \n21  In 2005, the mobile teledensity was about 8% in India, 11% in Viet Nam, 30% in the People\u2019s Republic of China, 40% \n\nin the Philippines, 43% in Thailand, and 75% in Malaysia. \n\n22  In 2005, the internet penetration rate was about 5% in India and the Philippines, 8% in the People\u2019s Republic of China, \n\n11% in Thailand, 13% in Viet Nam, and 42% in Malaysia. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2       45 \n\n22. \nUntil 1999 the responsibility for the provision of telecommunications services was assigned \nto two SOEs. Telkom was designated as the so-called organizing body and granted exclusivity for \ndomestic  services  (both  local  and  long  distance),  while  Indosat  played  this  role  for  international \nservices. Law 36/1999 on telecommunications and the related implementing regulations provided \nthe basis for major sector reforms. These were outlined in the 1999 sector blueprint that envisaged \na  gradual  transition  to  full  competition  by  2010.  The  Government  removed  the  respective \nmonopolies  of  Telkom  and  Indosat,  partially  privatized  them,23  eliminated  their  cross-holdings  in \nother  operators,  and  established  the  Indonesian  Telecommunications  Regulatory  Body  (BRTI). \nWhile  competition  has been  strong  in  the  profitable  mobile  phone  market,24  until  recently  Telkom \ncontinued to monopolize the fixed-line business, using its dominant position as a provider of basic \ninfrastructure. Telkom is also dominant in internet services.25  \n \n23. \nBecause of its political sensitivity, implementation of increases in tariffs for phone calls has \nbeen partial. In early 2002, the Government announced a plan to increase fixed-line tariffs by an \naverage  of  45%  within  3  years.  The  first  phase  of  15%  was  implemented  in  2002,  but  the  2003 \nincrease was rejected by Parliament. In early 2004, the Government announced that it would allow \noperators  to  rebalance  their  tariffs,  with  the  weighted  average  of  tariffs  increasing  by  9%.  This \nresulted in local tariffs increasing by 28% and long-distance tariffs falling by 10%.  \n \n24. \nTo ensure that all villages have access to basic telecommunications by 2010, in 2003 the \nGovernment launched the first phase of its universal service obligation program. It was based on a \nturnkey  approach,  with  infrastructure  and  equipment  financed  from  the  national  budget  and \nremaining  under  state  ownership.  Physical  connections  were  installed  in  about  5,600  villages, \nmostly using expensive satellite technology. However, the outcome was below expectations, partly \ndue  to  maintenance  difficulties  and  partly  because  the  program  did  not  anticipate  the  rollout  of \nwireless  networks  to  many  of  the  target  villages,  which  made  the  use  of  satellite  phones \nunattractive to customers. The program has therefore been redesigned in terms of funding (a fixed \npercentage  of  annual  gross  revenues  of  telecommunications  operators  instead  of  the  national \nbudget) and implementation (output-based contracting of construction, operation, and maintenance \ninstead of the turnkey approach to construction only). \n \nG. \n \nAmong the various infrastructure sectors in Indonesia, water supply and sanitation is in the \n25. \nworst  technical  condition,  and  its financial condition  is  also  precarious.  Unlike  the  situation  in  the \npower  sector,  there  is  no  PSO  subsidy  from  the  central  government,  because  management  and \nservice delivery in water supply and sanitation are decentralized. It is estimated that in 2005, only \nabout  40  million  people,  or  18%  of  the  population,  were  connected  to  piped  water  supply  from \nregional water supply enterprises (PDAMs). Even in urban areas, only 33% of people receive piped \nwater. The remaining urban population depends on individual wells, small-scale providers, or water \nvendors,  often  at  high  cost.  In  rural  areas,  the  situation  is  much  worse.  Only  about  15%  of  rural \nhouseholds get drinking water from pipe or pump sources, with PDAMs accounting for about half of \nit.  The  majority  of  rural  households  still  rely  on  shallow  groundwater  extraction  or  rainwater \ncollection, or use surface water from nearby rivers or springs. The poor are affected most by this \nunsatisfactory  situation.  Countrywide,  less  than  20%  of  the  poor  have  access  to  safe  drinking \nwater, compared to more than 80% of the rich. The poor pay water vendors up to five times more \nthan the rich who use piped water.  \n \n                                                 \n23  The privatization started with the listing of Telcom and Indosat on the New York stock exchange in 1995, when about \n\nWater Supply and Sanitation \n\n5% of shares were offered to the public. \n\n24  Ten  companies  have  national  licenses,  with  three  of  them\u2014Telkomsel  (Telkom  subsidiary),  Indosat,  and \n\nExelcomindo\u2014having a combined market share of about 98%. \n\n25  There  are  150  licensed  internet  service  providers,  of  which  about  40  are  active.  Telkom  controls  over  60%  of  the \n\nmarket.  \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nlack  of  adequate  sewerage  systems,  combined  with \n\n26.  Wastewater disposal is almost entirely handled by local governments. Indonesia has one of \nthe  lowest  rates  of  urban  sewerage  coverage  in  Asia.  Only  seven  cities  have  some  form  of \nsewerage networks, and these reach just 10% of urban residents. Over 70% of urban households \nhave  on-site  sanitation,  mostly  in  the  form  of  septic  tanks  that  are  not  functioning  effectively.  In \nrural  areas,  less  than  30%  of  households  have  toilet  facilities,  and  only  about  20%  have  septic \ninadequate  solid-waste \ntanks.  The \nmanagement,  has  caused  widespread  contamination  of  surface  and  groundwater.  These \nconditions explain the high incidence of waterborne diseases. Indonesia has the highest incidence \nof typhoid in East Asia, and diarrhea is the second-largest cause of death among young children. \n \n27. \nThere  are  335  PDAMs  under  the  jurisdiction  and  ownership  of  local  governments.  Only \nabout  one-quarter  of  them  are  technically  and  financially  sound.  The  others  are  struggling,  with \ntheir  financial  situation  deteriorating  and  service  quality  falling.  About  60%  of  the  PDAMs  are \nheavily  indebted  and  178  PDAMs,  or  53%,  have  debt  arrears.  The  total  debt  to  the  Ministry  of \nFinance, including penalties, amounts to Rp6.7 trillion, with 32 PDAMs accounting for about 80% of \nit.  Tariffs  are  generally  well  below  cost-recovery  levels,  and  often  do  not  even  cover  costs  for \noperation  and  maintenance.  The  PDAMs  function  with  little  autonomy  from  local  governments, \nwhich  keep  tariffs  artificially  low  and  demand  dividends  that  reduce  funds  for  maintenance  and \ninvestments.  At  40%\u201350%,  unaccounted-for  water  is  clearly  excessive  and  loss-reduction \nprograms have been mostly unsuccessful. The large number of PDAMs is also a concern, because \nmany are too small to be sustainable. \n \n28. \nThe  sector  suffers  from  low  investment,  a  situation  prevailing  since  the  Asian  financial \ncrisis.  Particularly  in  sanitation,  investment  has  been  almost  negligible,  and  cost  recovery  is \nconsidered  irrelevant.  Annual  investments  of  about  $400  million  are  estimated  to  be  required  to \nmeet  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  for  water  supply  and  sanitation.26  The  bulk  of  financing \nhas  to  come  from  cash  generated  by  the  PDAMs  and  local  government  budgets.  This  calls  for \nmajor  improvements  in  the  self-financing  capacity  of  PDAMs,  and  in  the  borrowing  capacity  and \nfinancial management of local governments. Ensuring access of the latter to long-term finance is \nparticularly  important.  The  gap  between  the  investment  needs  and  public  sources  of  funds, \nincluding foreign borrowing, has to be closed by greater PSP.27 As it is beyond the technical and \nfinancial capability of PDAMs to increase access in rural areas, the community-driven development \nof small water supply and sanitation facilities has to be intensified. \n\n                                                 \n26  The  target  is  halving  by  2015  the  proportion  of  people  without  sustainable  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  and \nsignificantly  improving  by  2020  the  lives  of  at  least  100  million  slum  dwellers  through  improved  sanitation  and  other \nmeasures. \n\n27  Except for three water supply concessions (two in Jakarta and one in Batam), PSP in the sector has been low.

Although  it  has  been  steadily  falling  since  then,  poverty  remains  persistent  in \nIndonesia.  Recent  surveys  suggest  that  about  half  of  the  population  still  live  below  the  $2/day  international  poverty  line. \nContinued economic growth has lifted living standards; however, the benefits of economic growth are not equally distributed \namong the population. Rural poverty is significantly higher that urban poverty, with about 60% of the country\u2019s poor living in \nrural areas. Causes of both urban and rural poverty include absence of economic opportunities, lack of access to key social \nservices, and poor infrastructure.  \n \nTo  accelerate  infrastructure  development  and  thereby  support  higher  economic  growth  and  faster  poverty  reduction,  the \nGovernment  has  launched  a  series  of  policy  reforms  that  liberalize  markets  and  allow  competition  from  new  entrants, \nstrengthen  regulatory  arrangements,  introduce  tariff  regimes  based  on  full  cost  recovery  or  provide  compensation  to  meet \npublic service obligations, and establish effective mechanisms for dispute resolution. The Government\u2019s National Strategy for \nPoverty Reduction (SNPK) has identified rural infrastructure investments as a key to reducing poverty and regional disparities. \nInfrastructure  investments  will  contribute  to  achieve  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  as  improved  infrastructure \nwill enhance poor people\u2019s access to social services and markets and generate income and employment opportunities. In line \nwith  the  SNPK,  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  2004\u20132009  (RPJM)  underlines  the  need  for  increased \ninvestments in infrastructure in general and in rural infrastructure in particular as an important vehicle of reducing poverty. In \nApril 2007, the Government launched the National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri), which builds upon \nIndonesia\u2019s  accumulated  experience  with  community-driven  infrastructure  development  and  focuses  on  improving  service \ndelivery in rural areas by providing block grants for rural roads, water and sanitation facilities, and developing education and \nhealth services.   \n \nThe  IRSDP  supports  achievement  of  the  RPJM\u2019s  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  targets.  It  is  also  included  in  the \nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  overall  strategy  which  sees  infrastructure  investments  as  a  key  area  of  engagement  to  address \npoverty and regional disparities, and achieve the MDGs.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nKey Issues  \n \nAccording to recent estimates, about half of Indonesia's 235 million people are considered to be poor and survive on less than \n$2 a day; about 18% live on $1 or less. In addition, a significant portion of Indonesia's population has an income that is just \nabove  the  poverty  line.  A  large  proportion  of  vulnerable  people  are  thus  at  risk  of  falling  into  poverty  due  to  rising  inflation \ncaused by increases in food and oil prices, and the impacts of natural disasters. Poverty-related challenges in Indonesia are \nnot only the large number of poor but also the striking disparities between regions, provinces, districts, and cities.   \n \nThe  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1997  led  to  a  steep  decline  in  infrastructure  investments.  Private  sector  investment  almost \ndisappeared. At the same time, the Government realized that the public sector had borne a disproportionate share of the risks \nin  the  infrastructure  sectors,  and  stopped  providing  any  risk-sharing  support.  With  infrastructure  investments  currently  at \naround  3%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  about  50  million  people  do  not  have  access  to  treated  water,  90  million  are \nwithout electricity, and about 200 million are without connections to a sewerage network. The poor suffer disproportionately \nfrom  lack  of  access  to  basic  infrastructure  services.  Availability  of  services  is  generally  lower  in  rural  areas,  contributing  to \nsignificant regional disparities in development. \n \nTo address issues of poverty caused by lack of adequate infrastructure facilities and poor access to infrastructure services, \nthe  IRSDP  aims  to  increase  both  public  and  private  infrastructure  investments.  These,  in  turn,  will  improve  the  climate  for \ninvestments  in  productive  sectors,  which  will  generate  better  economic  and  employment  opportunities.  By  enhancing \ninfrastructure  provision  and  access,  the  IRSDP  contributes  to  achieving  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  macroeconomic \ngoals, in particular realizing average annual GDP growth of 6%\u20137% during 2005\u20132009 and sustaining such growth thereafter, \nwhich will result in reducing poverty.  \n\n \n\n\f78  Appendix 10 \n\n  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nIndonesia\u2019s infrastructure is  deteriorating;  electrification rates are the lowest in  the region,  with more  than 70 million people \nstill lacking access to electricity. Indonesia has the lowest road density in the region, of 0.18 km per square kilometer (km) or \n1.5 km per 1,000 people. Only about 40 million people or 18% of the population are connected to a piped water supply; even \nin urban areas only 33% have access to piped water. Urban sewerage coverage is one of the lowest in Asia. Access through \nfixed telecommunication lines is among the lowest in the region, with only about 4 lines per 100 people, compared to 18\u201320 \nlines elsewhere. \n \nRoad conditions in rural areas are particularly poor; more than 15% of all Indonesian villages are inaccessible even by four-\nwheel-drive  vehicle  at  certain  times  of  the  year.  A  lack  of  access  to  infrastructure  results  in  location  poverty,  where  people \nliving in isolated areas with difficult geography and poor market links lack both economic opportunities and adequate levels of \nservice delivery. Investments in transportation infrastructure, agricultural infrastructure (irrigation), and educational and health \nfacilities can significantly improve living conditions in remote areas, create the basis for economic growth, and make a major \ndifference in the welfare of the local population. Poor quality roads or even no roads mean that government services seldom \nenter  the  region.  Once  isolated  regions  can  be  reached,  services  will  follow.  The  positive  effect  of  infrastructure  on  rural \nwelfare has been empirically demonstrated. Surveys revealed that the presence of good roads is strongly correlated with the \nlevel of mean income of communities.  \n \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\n1. Summary of the consultation and participation process during the Program preparation: \nThe  IRSDP  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  broad  reform  agenda  and  is  anchored  in  the  Government\u2019s  comprehensive \nInfrastructure  Policy  Package.  It  was  designed  through  a  participatory  process  involving  major  government  and \nnongovernment  stakeholders  at  the  national  level,  and  development  partners.  Participation  took  place  through  regular \nconsultations.  During  its  implementation,  broad  stakeholder  participation  has  been  maintained.  The  IRSDP  leads  to  (i)  an \nimproved  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  framework  anchored  on  good-governance  principles,  (ii)  an  improved  coordination \nmechanism  for  ministries  and  agencies  involved  in  infrastructure  development,  (iii)  a  well-structured  risk  management \nframework that promotes private sector  participation, (iv)  accelerated mobilization of domestic long-term financial resources \nfor  infrastructure  development,  and  establishment  of  innovative  funding  mechanisms  for  public\u2013private  partnership  projects, \nand  (v)  a  streamlined  regional  autonomy  framework,  clearly  delineating  functional  responsibilities  of  the  national  and  local \ngovernments  in  infrastructure  provision.  Further,  the  IRSDP  promotes  reforms  for  transportation,  power,  oil  and  gas,  water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  and  telecommunications  leading  to  (i)  better  sector  planning  and  project  preparation,  (ii)  improved \nfinancial  soundness  and  sustainability  of  infrastructure  services  through  full  cost  recovery,  (iii)  greater  competition  that \nbenefits consumers through improved service delivery and lower tariffs, (iv) independent regulatory structures that are distinct \nfrom the contracting and operating functions, (v) equal access for all participants in infrastructure provision, and prevention of \nabuse  of  natural  monopoly  rights,  and  (vi)  fulfillment  of  public  service  obligations  in  infrastructure  provision,  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction objectives.  \n \n2.
