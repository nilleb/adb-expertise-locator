The loan is funded through \na local currency bond issued by ADB for this financing. \n \nPALYJA  is  a  subsidiary  company  of  SUEZ  Environment,  part  of \nthe  SUEZ  Group  (SUEZ)  of  France,  and  is  one  of  the  largest \nwater service providers in Indonesia. Following an equity sale by \nSUEZ Environment in July 2006, PALYJA is 51% owned by SUEZ \nIndonesian  group  PT  Astratel \nEnvironment,  30%  by \nNusantara,  and  19%  by  Citigroup  Financial  Products \nIncorporated. \n \nIn  June  1997,  PALYJA  entered  into  a  25-year  concession \nagreement  with  Perusahaan  Daerah  Air  Minum  Jakarta  Raya \n(PAM  Jaya),  under  which  PALYJA  took  responsibility  for  the \nproduction  and  distribution  of  clean  water  in  West  Jakarta.  The \nagreement  became  effective  on  1  February  1998.  Under  the \nagreement,  PALYJA  is  responsible  for  the  design,  construction, \nrefurbishment,  and  operation  of \nthe  water  supply  system; \ntechnical  and  quality  control;  human  resources  and  training; \nfinancing  of  new  works;  and  billing  and  collection.  PALYJA \noperates (i) three water treatment plants: Pejompongan I and II , \nCilandak South, and Taman Kota North; and (ii) more than 5,000 \n\nthe \n\n\fiv \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nDevelopment Impact \n\n \nProject Risks \n\n \nJustification  \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  existing  distribution  network; \n\nkilometers  (km)  of  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  water  supply \nnetworks. \n \nSince 1998, PALYJA has invested more than Rp1 trillion ($109.8 \nmillion) in the water systems of West Jakarta, mainly to (i) improve \nthe quality of delivery services, (ii) rehabilitate existing distribution \nnetworks,  and  (iii)  expand  distribution  networks  to  increase  the \nservice coverage area. \n \nThe  loan  will  fund  a  portion  of  PALYJA\u2019s  capital  expenditure \nprogram  for  the  third  5-year  period  of  the  concession  between \n2008  and  2012.  The  program  will  focus  on  improving  service  to \nto  new \nexisting  customers  and  extending  service  delivery \ncustomers  by  (i)  completing  the  production  facility  upgrade \nin  1998;  (ii)  reinforcing,  rehabilitating,  and \nprogram  begun \nextending \nreducing \nunaccounted for water; and (iv) rehabilitating existing connections \nand implementing new connections. \n \nFirst,  the  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  meet  the \ntarget  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  through \nprovision  of  much-needed  water  supply \ninfrastructure.  The \nconsistent provision of clean water in West Jakarta will contribute \nto  Indonesia\u2019s  overall  efforts  to  reach  the  MDGs  by  (i)  reducing \nthe  proportion  of  people  without  access  to  safe  drinking  water \n(MDG  7),  and  (ii)  improving  the  quality  of  human  resource \ndevelopment and the environment by promoting healthy lifestyles \nand reducing mortality. Second, through assistance to PALYJA in \ndeveloping  its  capital  expenditure  program,  the  Project  will  help \nthe  people  of  West  Jakarta  gain  access  to  more  consistent  and \naffordable  water  supply,  especially  for  low-income  households. \nThird,  the  Project  complements  ADB  public  sector  efforts  to \nimprove the legal framework in the water sector as well as policy \ndialogue  with \nthe  Government  on  overall  water  sector \nmanagement  and  improvement.  For  instance,  the  proposed \nIntegrated Citarum Water Resource Management Project will help \nimprove  the  upstream  raw  water  supply  system.  Fourth,  ADB \ninvolvement  in  PALYJA,  through  its  public-private  partnership \nmodel,  will  allow  it  to  observe  and  raise  issues  with  the \nGovernment  on  key  policy  and  regulatory  challenges.  Finally,  by \nusing  locally  raised  funds,  the  Project  will  have a  positive  impact \non the development of local capital markets.  \n \nThe  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  (i)  exposure  to \npossible  raw  water  supply  interruptions  due  to  inadequate \nmaintenance  of  the  West  Tarum  Canal,  (ii)  timely  adjustment  of \nthe  water  tariff  and  water  charge,  and  (iii)  management  of \nunaccounted  for  water.  These  risks  have  been  or  will  be \nsystematically addressed and mitigated. \n \nThe  Project  merits  ADB  support  because  it  will  help  the \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nin  a  position \n\nreduction  and \n\ninfrastructure \nGovernment  achieve  poverty \ndevelopment  objectives.  PALYJA  will  be \nto \ncomfortably fund its proposed capital expenditure program, a key \ncomponent to expand water supply coverage in West Jakarta. The \ndelivery  of  services  to  a  broader  customer  base  will  lead  to \nincreased revenue, and reinforce PALYJA\u2019s financial sustainability \nand  continuous  operations  through  the  life  of  the  concession. \nConsidering  a  broader  scope,  development  effectiveness  is \nreflected  in  the  establishment  of  a  well-maintained  and  efficient \nwater supply system in West Jakarta. \n\n \n\n\f10  00'No\n\nSouth China Sea\n\n110  00'Eo\n\nBRUNEI\nDARUSSALAM\n\nMALAYSIA\n\n0o\n\nSUMATRA\n\n10  00'So\n\nKALIMANTAN\n\nSULAWESI\n\n--A\nBANGK\nBELITUNG\n\nI  N  D  O  N  E  S  I  A\n\nJAKARTA\n\nJ a v a     S e a\n\nJ A V A\n\nSUMBAWA\n\nFLORES\n\n130  00'Eo\n\n10  00'No\n\nP A C I F I C     O C E A N\n\nHALMAHERA\n\n0o\n\nSERAM\n\nPAPUA\n\nBALI\n\nSUMBA\n\nTIMOR\n\nTIMOR-LESTE\n\n10  00'So\n\nI N D I A N     O C E A N\n\n110  00'Eo\n\n130  00'Eo\n\nI N DO N E S I A\n\nJ a v a    S e a\n\nWEST JAKARTA WATER SUPPLY\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n\nMuara Karang WTP\n100 L/sec\n\nTaman Kota WTP\n200 L/sec\n\nPejompongan\n1&2 WTP\n\nBanjir Canal\n\nDC R4\n1.2 m3/sec\n\nPulogadung WTP\n\nclosed conduit\n\n4.4 m3/sec\n\nDC R5\n1.6 m3/sec\n\nCilandak WTP\n400 L/sec\n\nCondet WTP\n50 L/sec\n\nSerpong WTP\n3 m3/sec\n\n5.5 m3/sec\n\nBuaran WTP\n\nWest Tarum Canal\n\nCikarang Weir\n\nCisadane River\n\nCiliwung River\n\nSunter River\n\nCikarang River\n\nCibeet River\n\nCitarum River\n\nCipinang River\n\nBekasi River\n\nCibeet Weir\n\nWest Jakarta Concession Area\n\nNational Capital\n\nWater Treatment Plant\n\nWeir\n\nRiver\n\nProvincial Boundary\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\n0\n7\n-\n1\n9\n6\n0\nR\nM\n\n \n\nN\n\n1\nJatiluhur Dam\nKM-10\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nIndonesian  rupiah-denominated  loan,  without  government  guarantee,  of  up  to  Rp455  billion  to \nPT  PAM  Lyonnaise  Jaya  (PALYJA)  for  the  West  Jakarta  Water  Supply  Development  Project. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\n \n2. \nIndonesia, with its abundant rainfall, has about 6% of the world's fresh water resources. \nHowever  the  development  of  Jakarta's  water  supply  network,  originally  built  during  the  Dutch \noccupation,  has  not  kept  pace  with  the  city's  rapid  growth.  As  a  result,  by  1991  only  45%1 of \nJakarta's  residents  had  access  to  piped  water.  Numerous  incidents  were  reported  of  people \nfinding  worms,  sand,  or  even  needles  in  Jakarta's  piped  water;  water  quality  was  barely \nacceptable.  \n \nCurrently,  60%  of  Jakarta\u2019s  residents  have  access  to  clean  water.  But  to  reach  the \n3. \nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) target of reducing the proportion of people without access \nto safe drinking water and basic sanitation by half by 2015 (MDG 7, Target 10), approximately \nRp66.4 trillion ($7.3 billion) will be needed for water services,2 of which only 25% is expected to \nbe  provided  by  the  Government.  The  remaining  investment  is  targeted  to  be  provided  by  the \nprivate sector.  \n \n4. \nPerusahaan  Daerah  Air  Minum  Jakarta  Raya  (PAM  Jaya),  a  state-owned  enterprise  to \nprovide water supply in Jakarta and established in 1977, was responsible for water supply and \nsewerage services in Jakarta until late 1997. Unit production costs and the tariff structure were \nboth  high  compared  with  other  Asian  countries,  but  at  the  same  time  PAM  Jaya  could  not \nsustain an efficient management or investment program to meet the needs of residents. In 1997, \nthe right to operate the city\u2019s water supply system was offered to private enterprises under two \nseparate  concessions,  one  in  West  Jakarta  and  one  in  East  Jakarta.  In  early  1998  after \nnegotiating cooperation agreements with PAM Jaya, PT Thames Pam Jaya was appointed the \noperator for the East Jakarta concession and PALYJA for the West.  \n \n5. \nHowever, within 3 months of signing the cooperation agreement, Indonesia was affected \nby the Asian financial crisis. Economic and political turmoil resulted in PAM Jaya being unable \nto  implement  the  negotiated  tariff  increases.  Thus  PALYJA\u2019s  planned  capital  expenditure \nprogram  was  never  fully  implemented.  In  2001,  a  renegotiated  cooperation  agreement  was \nsigned to resolve the issue of tariff adjustment and to create mitigation measures for any future \ntariff freezes. Through this process, two issues became clear to PALYJA: (i) availability of long-\nterm  local  currency  financing  is  crucial  in  meeting  PALYJA\u2019s  investment  obligations  under  the \ncooperation agreement and mitigating foreign exchange risks; and (ii) government support and \nenforcement of water tariffs are essential to ensure the financial sustainability of the concession, \nand the economic sustainability of the water sector.   \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  1994.

Manila. \n\n2  ADB, 2003. Indonesia Country Report, Kyoto Water Forum. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nPALYJA first approached ADB in December 2006. In March 2007, PALYJA confirmed its \n6. \nkeen  interest  in  obtaining  a  long-term  local  currency  loan  facility  from  ADB  to  help  meet  its \ncapital expenditure requirements for the next planning cycle (2008\u20132012). \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Water Sector \n\n7. \nWater resource management is poor and water demand is only about 1.7% of potential \ntotal  demand.3 Water  quality  varies  depending  on  the  season,  year,  and  factory  discharges. \nDespite  efforts  for  environmental  cleanup,  overall  water  quality  is  worsening.  Flooding  is \ncommon,  largely  due  to  human  deforestation  and  poor  agricultural  practices.  In  addition,  the \nurban population has grown at more than 4% annually over the past 10 years4 compared with \nthe  national  average  population  growth  rate  of  1.7%  per  annum  over  the  same  period.  The \ncountry\u2019s urban population is projected to grow from the current 45% of the total population to \n60%  in  2015,  and  will  double  by  2025.  Most  public  utilities  are  not  equipped  to  handle  such \ndrastic growth in urbanization, in particular the water utilities.  \n \nAt present, only about 40 million people, or 18% of the total population, are connected to \n8. \npiped  water  supply. 5 Even  in  urban  areas  only  39%  of  residents  receive  piped  water.  The \nremaining urban population depends on individual wells, small-scale providers, or water vendors; \noften  at  high  cost.  In  rural  areas,  the  situation  is  much  worse.  Only  about  15%  of  rural \nhouseholds get drinking water from pipe or pump sources, with Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum \n(PDAMs), the public water utilities, accounting for about half of the supply. The majority of rural \nhouseholds  still  rely  on  shallow  groundwater  extraction  or  rainwater  collection,  or  use  surface \nwater from nearby rivers or springs. The poor are affected most by these situations.  \n \n9. \nIt  is  estimated  that  a  total  investment  of  Rp66.4  trillion  ($7.3  billion)  will  be  needed  for \nwater services to achieve the MDG for water supply and sanitation by 20156.  This will require \nan  annual  spending  on  water  services  of  about  Rp5.1  trillion  ($573  million)  (para.  3).  As \ncompared with average government spending of Rp11 trillion each year on infrastructure, which \nincludes  roads,  bridges,  irrigation,  water,  housing,  and  others;  public  expenditure  alone  will \nobviously not be sufficient to address the water sector needs. \n \nBefore  1999,  the  central  Government  financed  all  public  utility  investments  through \n10. \ngrants, subsidies, or loans to the regional governments. Upon issuance of Law No. 22 of 1999 \non  Regional  Governance,  authority  for  all  aspects  of  local  infrastructure  and  service  delivery, \nincluding  planning,  providing,  financing,  and  managing  water  supply  and  sanitation,  was \ndevolved from the central Government to district and city governments (kabupaten and kota). \n \n11. \nAfter  decentralization, the  bulk  of  financing  responsibilities  for  water  supply  rested  with \nthe  PDAMs.  However,  many  PDAMs  throughout  Indonesia  are  unable  to  provide  minimum \nservices to consumers and are financially unsustainable due to inadequate tariffs. Further, the \nlack of financial sustainability has resulted in heavy debt obligations incurred by the PDAMs to \nthe  central  Government  amounting  to  $500  million,  on  top  of  other  forms  of  external  and \ncommercial debt. A detailed summary of the water sector is attached as Appendix 2.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3   Under the scenario that water management is better coordinated and supply of water is better channeled. \n4   United Nations. 2004.

Government regulation 22 of 1982 (GR 22/82) is the implementing regulation of \nLaw  11/74,  expanding  on  the  management  and  planning  functions  of  the  Government  and \nestablishing the authority of the Ministry of  Public Works to coordinate overall management of \nwater  and  water  resources.  Regulation  GR  22/82  allows  the  ministry  to  delegate  its  authority \nand functions relating to water and water resources to the regional governments. The ability of \nregional governments to set up PDAMs is set out in Law 5/74 and recently again in Law 22/99, \na major directive to support the trend to decentralization to the 36 provinces.  \n \nA  national  water  resources  policy  action  plan  was  developed  in  1994  for  PJP  II7 to  set \n13. \nthe  medium-term  strategy  and  action  items  for  the  water  sector,  including  (i)  improvement  of \nwater resources development and productivity through increase in efficiency and effectiveness \nof water resources infrastructure; and (ii) increase in the supply of water and the productivity of \nwater  supply  infrastructure  to  meet  the  requirements  of  urban  and  rural  populations. \nSubsequently, the Water Resources Law 7/2004 and Government Regulation 16/2005 on Water \nSupply  enhanced  the  legal  framework  for  water  supply  by  (i)  clarifying  the  terms  for  private \nsector participation and hence ending public monopolies in the water sector, (ii) eliminating the \nneed for local parliament approval of water tariff increases, and (iii) calling for the establishment \nof the National Water Regulatory Agency NWRA.   \n \n\nb. \n\nSector Challenges \n\n14. \nThe key issues affecting Indonesia\u2019s water sector are (i) low service coverage with piped \nwater  supply,  (ii)  financially  unsustainable  water  supply  services,  and  (iii)  lack  of  sanitation \nservices. \n\n \n\n \n\n15. \nLow Service Coverage with Piped Water Supply. Lack of access to water has a major \nimpact on economic development, health, and well-being of the population. Many of the PDAMs \nthroughout  Indonesia  are  barely  able  to  provide  minimum  services  to  consumers  and  have \nconnected only about 39% of the urban population to piped water supply. As a result, more than \n70%  of  the  population  obtains  water  from  potentially  contaminated  sources.  Unsafe  drinking \nwater leads to diarrhea, which is the second leading cause of death of children under 5 years in \nthe country and accounts for about 20% of child deaths each year. \n\nin \n\nthe  reduction  or  abandonment  of  maintenance  and \n\n16. \nUnsustainable  Financing  of  Water  Supply  Services.  The  widespread  lack  of  cost \nrecovery  tariffs,  compounded  by  the  limited  size  of  PDAMs  and  low  revenue  collection,  have \nresulted \ninvestment  activities, \ndeteriorating assets, as well as low service coverage and quality. Of the 318 PDAMs, 82% are \nexperiencing  losses  and  44%  are  operationally  unsustainable.  Of  these,  119  PDAMs  have \nforeign debts, while 146 PDAMs have domestic debt.8  \n \n17. \nLack  of  Sanitation  Services.  Poor  sanitation  services  impact  negatively  on  public \nhealth  and  the  well-being  of  the  population.  The  high  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  is  a \n                                                 \n7   The  Government  of  Indonesia  follows  5-year  development  plans  known  as  Repelita  and  25-year  long-term \n\ndevelopment plans known as PJP.

Formal  sewerage  systems  in  Indonesia  have  been  constructed  in \nselected areas of a few large cities, but most are underutilized and underfunded, and therefore \nunable  to  realize  the  planned  benefits  of  these systems.  Overall,  sewerage  coverage  is  about \n3%  of  the  urban  population.  The  vast  majority  of  citizens  still  rely  on  on-site  sanitation  (e.g., \nseptic tanks and pit latrines), while many low-income families rely on grossly polluted drains and \nurban waterways. \n \nB. \n\nADB Operations \n\n1. \n\nCountry Strategy \n\nIn developing its Medium-Term Development Plan (2005\u20132009) 9, the Government was \n18. \nguided  by  the  objectives  of  increasing  sustainable  economic  growth,  creating  jobs,  and \naccelerating achievement of the MDGs. Under the plan, the Government\u2019s five priority areas are \n(i)  job  creation  and  poverty  reduction;  (ii)  macroeconomic  stability,  fiscal  sustainability,  and \nfinancial sector reforms; (iii) acceleration of investments, exports, and tourism through reforms \nto provide a healthy business climate and flexible markets; (iv) improved access to and quality \nof  education  and  health;  and  (v)  infrastructure  development  by  improving  the  efficiency  of \nexisting  services  and  increasing  private  sector  participation.  To  support  the  Government  in \nachieving these goals, ADB\u2019s country strategy (2006\u20132009) reflects these priorities. Accordingly \nADB  plans  to  focus  on  (i)  infrastructure  development,  (ii)  financial  sector  deepening,  (iii) \ndecentralization, (iv) MDG acceleration, and (v) environment and natural resource management. \nThis Project is in line with focus areas (i), (iv), and (v) of the strategy. \n \n\n2. \n\nWater Sector Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s water sector strategy aims to promote (i) national focus on water sector reforms, \n19. \n(ii) development of integrated management of water resources, (iii) improvement and expansion \nof water delivery services, (iv) conservation of water and improvement of system efficiencies, (v) \nregional  cooperation  on  water  resource  sharing,  (vi)  facilitation  of  water  sector  information \nexchange,  and  (vii)  governance  enhancements.  The  Project  is  in  line  with  (iii)  and  (iv)  of  this \nstrategy. \n \n20.  Water  resource  management  is  a  key  element  of  ADB  operations  for  environment  and \nnatural  resource  management  in  Indonesia.  Through  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector \nDevelopment  Program10,  key  regulatory  framework  was  defined  for  tariff  and  PDAM  reforms.  \nBased  on  this  platform,  support  will  be  provided  for  integrated  water  resources  management, \nincluding investments in infrastructure and management of multipurpose facilities, in the context \nof  river  basins.  Two  projects  are  under  preparation.  First,  the  Integrated  Citarum  Water \nResources  Management  Project  is  being  developed  as  a  multitranche  financing  facility  for \napproval in 2007. The Citarum project will help implement a strategic road map for development \nand  sustainable  management  of  the  Citarum  River  basin,  and  thus  improve  water  quality  and \nsupply  to  the  cities  of  Jakarta  and  Bandung  and  to  farmers  in  West  Java.  Second,  the  Flood \nManagement  in  Selected  River  Basins  Project,  being  developed  as  a  multitranche  financing \nfacility  for  approval  in  2008,  will  focus  on  selected  river  basins  and  improved  capacities  in \nCentral  and  West  Java.  The  Citarum  project  will  enhance  overall  effectiveness  of  water \nresource  and  water  supply  management  in  Jakarta,  which  critically  supports  this  Project. \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nParticular importance is placed on developing public and private sector dialogue and ensuring \ncomplementarity  of  the  Project  with  public  sector  operations  and  overall  water  sector \ndevelopment  strategy.  Information  on  the  Project  is  shared  with  the  South  East  Regional \nDepartment,  and  close  coordination  will  continue  throughout  development  of  the  Project  and \ndevelopment of various public sector initiatives. \n \nADB\u2019s  Water  Financing  Program  2006\u2013201011 also  prioritizes  Indonesia  as  one  of  its \n21. \nfocal  countries  for  expansion  of  water  services.  The  program  seeks  to  expand  investments  in \nthree  key  areas:  rural  water  services  (water  supply  and  sanitation,  irrigation,  and  drainage), \nurban water services (water supply and sanitation, wastewater management, and environmental \nimprovement), and basin water management (integrated water resource management, including \ninvestments  in  infrastructure,  flood  management,  and  water  quality  conservation;  and \nconservation and improvement of watersheds, wetlands, and ecosystems). The Project is in line \nwith  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  Water  Financing  Program,  particularly  with  regard  to \ninvestment in the urban water service sector. \n \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Operations \n\n22. \nADB\u2019s private sector operations in Indonesia aim to support the Government\u2019s Medium-\nTerm  Development  Plan  for  economic  growth  and  MDG  acceleration.  ADB  is  committed  to \nutilizing its investment and cofinancing products, including equity, debt, and guarantees to assist \nIndonesia in mobilizing private sector investment in infrastructure and the financial sector.  \n \n23. \nPrivate sector operations began in Indonesia in 1985. During 1985\u20131998, ADB approved \n$197.5 million in financial assistance for 16 projects in the general industry and financial sectors. \nSome of these projects, particularly in manufacturing, performed less than satisfactorily primarily \nbecause  of  sector  and  partner  selection  issues.  After  the  financial  crisis,  ADB  did  not  provide \nnew  financial  assistance  to  Indonesia  until  2005,  when  it  approved  a  liquefied  natural  gas \nproject. In 2006, the ADB Board of  Directors approved financial assistance to PT Perusahaan \nGas Negara (Persero) Tbk, a state-owned gas utility. In 2007, the Board approved a loan to PT \nSemen  Andalas  Indonesia  for  the  Reconstruction  of  the  Cement  Production  Facility  in  Aceh. \nADB\u2019s private sector projects in Indonesia are listed in Appendix 3. \n \n24. \nthe \ndevelopment  of  local  financial  markets.  The  ADB  paper  Introducing  the  Local  Currency  Loan \nProduct12 proposes  that  ADB  introduce  a  local  currency  loan  product  that  would  help  reduce \ncurrency mismatches, promote capital market development, and catalyze local financing.  \n   \n25. \nADB\u2019s loan to PALYJA is proposed to be funded through the issue by the proceeds of a \nlocal currency bond, which would be the first local currency bond issued by ADB in Indonesia. If \napproved,  the  Project  would  be  the  first  ADB  local  currency  loan  for  a  private  sector \ninfrastructure project in Indonesia. \n \n\nframework  recommends \n\nthat  ADB  contribute \n\nlong-term  strategic \n\nADB\u2019s \n\nto \n\nIII. \n\nTHE BORROWER \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\n26. \nPALYJA is a subsidiary company of SUEZ Environment, part of the SUEZ Group (SUEZ) \nof France, and is one of the largest water service providers in Indonesia. In June 1997, PALYJA \n\n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2006. Water Financing Program 2006\u20132010. Manila \n12  ADB. 2005. Introducing the Local Currency Loan Product. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nentered  into  a  25-year  concession  agreement  (the  cooperation  agreement)  with  PAM  Jaya \nunder  which  PALYJA  took  responsibility  for  the  production  and  distribution  of  clean  water  in \nWest  Jakarta.  The  agreement  became  effective  on  1  February  1998.  The  scope  of  services \nincludes  the  design,  construction,  refurbishment,  and  operation  of  the  water  supply  system; \ntechnical and quality control; human resources and training; financing of new works; and billing \nand collection. \n \n27. \nSince  the  start  of  the  concession  period  in  1998,  PALYJA  has  invested  more  than  \nRp1  trillion  ($109.8  million)  in  the  water  systems  of  West  Jakarta,  mainly  to  (i)  improve  the \nquality  of  delivery  services,  (ii)  rehabilitate  existing  distribution  networks,  and  (iii)  expand \ndistribution networks to increase the service coverage area. Significant achievements include (i) \nservice coverage ratio increased from 32% of the population in 1998 to about 55% in 2006; (ii) \nmore  than  1,500  kilometers  (km)  of  the  water  supply  network  rehabilitated  and  extended;  (iii) \ntotal  connections  increased  from  210,000  in  1998  to  350,000  in  2006;  (iv)  population  served \nincreased  by  1.25  million,  including  low-income  customers  increased  by  124%  and  middle-\nincome customers by 40%; (v) physical and commercial water losses reduced by 15%; and (vi) \nwater  quality  compliance  dramatically  improved.  A  detailed  description  of  PALYJA  is  attached \nas Appendix 4. \n \nB. \n\nHistory of the Concession \n\n28. \nUnder the cooperation agreement, PALYJA is responsible for procurement of bulk water, \noperation  of  the  water  supply  system,  and  billing  and  collection  of  water  fees.  To  ensure  the \naffordability of water to customers of all social economic classes, the agreement delinked water \ntariffs  charged  to  customers  (water  revenue)  and  the  revenues  received  by  PALYJA  (water \ncharge).  The  water  revenue  would  vary  depending  on  the  customer  category,  while  PALYJA \nwould receive a flat water charge for every cubic meter of water billed. \n \n29.  Within 3 months of signing the original agreement, Indonesia experienced the economic \nturmoil of the Asian financial crisis. As a result of political pressures arising from the crisis none \nof  the  increases  in  retail  water  tariffs  envisioned  in  the  agreement  were  implemented  prior  to \n2000.  Also,  following  the  overthrow  of  the  Suharto  regime  in  1998,  the  legitimacy  of  the  two \nconcessions were challenged. The Indonesian Government under President Habibie temporarily \nreclaimed the concessions under public authority. Control of the West Jakarta concession was \nreturned to PALYJA, but with renegotiated terms and conditions.  \n \nIn  2001,  PAM  Jaya  and  PALYJA  finalized  the  terms  of  the  renegotiated  cooperation \n30. \nagreement,  which  sought  to  address  the  issue  of  the  tariff  freeze  imposed  prior  to  2000  and \nestablished  a  regulatory  body  for  mediation  and  monitoring.  Pursuant  to  the  renegotiated \nagreement, significant increases in water tariffs were implemented in 2001, 2003, and 2004 to \nbring  water  tariffs  back  in  line  with  local  inflation  indices.  In  2004,  an  amendment  to  the \nagreement  introduced  an  automatic  tariff  adjustment  mechanism  that  has  been  operating \nsatisfactorily since early 2005. \n \nC. \n\nMajor Shareholders \n\n31. \nFollowing a sale of equity by SUEZ Environment in July 2006, PALYJA is 51% owned by \nSUEZ Environment, 30% by the Indonesian group PT Astratel Nusantara, and 19% by Citigroup \nFinancial Products Incorporated. \n \n32. \nSUEZ  is  a  France-based  group  listed  on  the  Brussels,  Luxembourg,  Paris,  New  York, \nand  Zurich  stock  exchanges.  SUEZ  is  a  provider  of  electricity,  natural  gas,  energy  services, \nwater, and waste management. It has two main lines of business: energy and environment. The \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nenergy business includes the production, sale, and trading of electricity; sale, trading, transport, \nand storage of natural gas; energy services, including on-site management on energy networks, \nand utilities and facilities management; as well as operation, maintenance, and development of \npower and natural gas distribution networks.  \n \n33. \nSUEZ  Environment  is  responsible  for  supplying  services,  plant,  and  equipment  for  (i) \ndrinking  water  production  and  distribution,  (ii)  wastewater  collection  and  treatment,  and  (iii) \nwaste  processing  and  recycling  to  industrial  and  individual  customers.  SUEZ  Environment  is \nranked  second  in  environmental  services  in  Europe  for  water  and  sanitation.  To  date,  SUEZ \nEnvironment  serves  more  than  400,000  industrial  customers  and  91  million  individuals  with \ndrinking  water,  49  million  individuals  with  sanitation  services,  and  64  million  individuals  with \nwaste services. \n \n34. \nPT  Astratel  Nusantara  (Astratel)  is  a  subsidiary  company  under  PT  Astra  International \n(Astra),  an  Indonesian  conglomerate  founded  in  1957  and  now  one  of  the  largest  business \ngroups  in  Indonesia.  Astra  currently  has  six  core  businesses:  automotive,  financial  services, \nheavy  equipment,  agribusiness,  information  technology,  and  infrastructure.  Astratel  has  been \noperating  for  12  years  and  been  involved  in  the  development  of  numerous  infrastructure \nprojects, with a particular focus on telecommunications. Astratel now intends to actively pursue \npotential  new  infrastructure  projects  including  water  supply,  toll  roads,  ports/logistics,  marine \nfacilities, and airports. Overall, Astra has adapted corporate governance standards according to \ninternational  best  practice,  and  internal  policies  are  in  place  to  ensure  good  corporate \ngovernance throughout the group and its subsidiaries. It was named the best listed company in \nthe  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  with  regard  to  corporate  governance,  transparency,  and \naccountability. In April 2007, Astra placed at the top of the Finance Asia13 poll for Indonesia in \nthe  following  three  categories:  (i)  best  managed  company  in  Indonesia;  (ii)  most  committed  to \ncorporate governance; and (iii) best investor relations. \n \nD. \n\nOrganization Structure \n\n35. \nAs  of  March  2007,  PALYJA  has  1,400  employees,  of  which  902  are  employees \nseconded  from  PAM  Jaya  at  the  outset  of  the  concession  period.  PALYJA  is  currently  in  the \nprocess  of  integrating  seconded  employees  to  become  permanent  employees,  with  the \nobjective  of  enhancing  employee  equality  and  providing  more  flexibility  with  regard  to  labor \nmanagement. The organization chart is presented in Figure 1: \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13  Finance Asia. 2007.

The West Tarum Canal system is operated by Perum Jasa Tirta I, a \nstate-owned company.  \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nThe Project will fund part of PALYJA\u2019s capital expenditure program for the third 5-year \n\n38. \nconcession period: 2008\u20132012.  \n \nA. \n\nCapital Expenditure Program \n\n(i) \n\nPlanned capital expenditure during 2008 to 2012 will focus on improving service \nto  existing  customers  and  extending  service  delivery  to  new  customers  by  (i) \ncompleting  the  production  facility  upgrade  program  initiated  in  1998;  (ii) \nreinforcing,  rehabilitating,  and  extending  the  existing  distribution  network;  (iii) \nrehabilitating  existing \nreducing  unaccounted \nconnections and implementing new connections.  \n\nlosses;  and \n\nfor  water \n\n(iv) \n\n \nB. \n\nEnvironment, Health, and Safety \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Safeguards \n\n39. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  FI.  Due  diligence  was  conducted  on \nthe  environmental,  safety,  and  health  aspects  of  PALYJA\u2019s  current  operations  to  ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. The environmental and social safeguard assessment \nfor  PALYJA  is  attached  as  Appendix  7.  In  addition,  PALYJA  will  ensure  that  environmental \nmonitoring for all future operations is undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002).  Hence,  PALYJA  will  set  up  or  improve  environment  management  systems,  including \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures satisfactory to ADB. PALYJA will also ensure \nit  complies  with  Indonesian  environment  laws  and  regulations.  PALYJA  will  confirm  to  ADB \nperiodically  its  compliance  with  ADB  and  Indonesian  environment  requirements  and  make \nreports on these matters available to ADB.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLand Acquisition, Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples \n\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \n40. \nindigenous  peoples.  Due  diligence  was  conducted  on  the  social  aspects  of  PALYJA\u2019s  current \noperations,  covering  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  With  respect  to \nPALYJA\u2019s planned capital expenditure program, land acquisition and resettlement activities are \nminimal. PALYJA has indicated its intention to avoid, if at all possible, land acquisition or other \nactivities that would lead to involuntary resettlement. PALYJA will be required to ensure that any \nland acquisition and resettlement activities are undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995).  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  is  attached  as \nAppendix 8. \n \nC. \n\nProjected Financial Performance \n\nDetailed  financial  projections  for  PALYJA  are  provided  in  Appendix  9  and  the  financial \n41. \nanalysis  of  the  Project  in  Appendix  10.  The  main  assumptions  for  the  base  case  financial \nprojections  include  (i)  customer  growth  of  2%  per  annum;  (ii)  domestic  inflation  of  7%  per \nannum; (iii) adjustment to the water charge based on the negotiated formula in the renegotiated \ncooperation  agreement  to  reflect  changes  in  capital  expenditures  and  operating  expenditures; \nand  (iv)  inclusion  of  labor-related  costs  (golden  handshake,  or  else  known  as  the  retirement \nprogram, harmonization of benefits and salary) as per the cooperation agreement. The financial \nprojections demonstrate PALYJA\u2019s ability to generate adequate cash flow to cover debt service \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nover the repayment period. The minimum projected debt service coverage ratio in the base case \nis 2.58 times, excluding the years where PALYJA has to fulfill its obligations in bond payments. \nSensitivity analysis for debt servicing capacity shows that PALYJA will have adequate financial \nresources,  even  in  a  variety  of  downside  scenarios  (Appendix  9).  Based  on  the  financial \nanalysis, the Project\u2019s financial internal rate of return is estimated at 12.8%, which is well above \nthe estimated weighted average cost of capital of 4.19%.  \n \nD. \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n42. \nThe  Project  has  a  strong  economic  rationale  as  it  provides  basic  living  conditions  and \nassists  in  mitigating  health  hazards.  The  proposed  actions  under  the  Project  represent \ntechnically  feasible  options  at  the  least  cost.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  58.5% \n(Appendix  11).  The  sensitivity  analysis  on  the  various  risk  parameters  indicates  that  the \nProject\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  well  above  30%  under  possible  adverse \ncircumstances.  The  health  benefits  of  the  Project  and  its  contribution  to  conservation  of  the \ngroundwater  table  and  prevention  of  further  subsidence  of  Jakarta  are  additional  benefits  that \nwere  not  quantified  in  the  economic  analysis.  These  would  strengthen  economic  returns  from \nthe Project. \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nDescription \n\n1. \n\nLoan Nature and Amount   \n\n43. \nThe  proposal  involves  ADB  providing  PALYJA  with  an  Indonesian  rupiah-denominated \nloan of up to Rp455,000,000,000 with a maturity of up to 10 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears. The loan will be used to fund a portion of PALYJA\u2019s capital expenditure program for the \nthird  5-year  period  of  the  concession  between  2008  and  2012.  To  this  end,  the  disbursement \nwill be staggered over 3\u20134 years to best meet the needs of PALYJA. Detailed disbursement will \nbe discussed in detail in the loan agreement. PALYJA\u2019s remaining capital expenditure funding \nrequirement over the period will be met from internally generated cash flow. ADB will charge an \ninterest rate to be determined according to procedures applicable to ADB local currency loans \nfor private sector operations, as well as a commitment fee and a front-end fee to be approved \nby ADB\u2019s Credit Enhancement and Pricing Committee. \n \nB. \n\nJustification  \n\nADB assistance is justified for the following reasons: \n\nPALYJA\u2019s  capital  expenditure  program  will  enhance  and  expand  water  supply \ninfrastructure in West Jakarta, with a particular focus on increasing the number of \nlow-income  customers  by  expanding  distribution  networks  in  low-income  areas, \nand  will  help  meet  the  MDG  target  for  water  supply.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  local \ncurrency assistance is expected to lead to improved affordability of water tariffs in \nJakarta. \n\nThe Project is in line with the Government\u2019s objectives of increasing sustainable \neconomic growth, creating jobs, and accelerating achievement of the MDGs.  \n\nThe  Project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  2006\u20132009  country  strategy  and  program  for \nIndonesia,  which  outlines  five  key  areas  of  engagement  for  ADB  operations  in \n\n44. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nIndonesia,  of  which  four  are  relevant  in  the  context  of  the  Project:  (a)  physical \ninfrastructure development, (b) financial sector deepening, (c) MDG acceleration, \nand  (d)  environment  and  natural  resource  management.  Further,  the  strategic \nfocus  for  ADB  in  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management  is  on \nimproving local delivery of services. \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  Project  and  ongoing  ADB  public  sector  projects  are  complementary.  The \nimprovement  of  upstream  water  supply  by  ADB  public  sector  operations  will \ngreatly enhance the consistency of raw water supply for PALYJA, which intends \nto implement efficient water supply in Jakarta with ADB private sector assistance.  \n\n(v)  Water supply, sanitation, and waste management remain an ADB priority, both in \nthe short and medium terms. It is included as a first priority (group I) in both the \ncurrent country strategy and ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II.14  \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Financing  Program  2006\u20132010,  which \nfocuses  on  the  expansion  of  investments  in  water  infrastructure  and  good \ngovernance in water resource management. \n\nADB  assistance  is  demonstrational.  It  is  expected  to  have  a  positive  impact  on \nPALYJA\u2019s  future  access  to  commercial  funding  in  local  and  international  capital \nmarkets. Funding of the local currency loan by ADB from the market should have \na positive impact on the development of local capital markets as well. \n\n \nC. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n45. \nRaw  Water  Supply.  As  the  majority  of  PALYJA\u2019s  water  supply  originates  from  the \nJatiluhur  reservoir  via  the  West  Tarum  Canal,  PALYJA  is  exposed  to  possible  water  supply \ninterruptions due to (i) inadequate maintenance and repair of the canal and associated pumping \nstations,  and  (ii)  lack  of  management  capacity  at  Perum  Jasa  Tirta  II.  Backup  water  supply \nsources  are  of  lower  quality,  resulting  in  higher  processing  costs.  However,  overall  raw  water \navailability is adequate and the risk of short-term supply interruptions from the primary source is \nexpected  to  be  mitigated  through  the  ADB  public  sector  assistance  for  improving  integrated \nwater  resource  management  in  the  Citarum  Basin  and  assistance  with  capacity  building  for \nPerum Jasa Tirta II. \n \nTariff  Policy  and  Adjustment  Risk.  The  history  of  policy  implementation  and \n46. \nenforcement for PALYJA\u2019s water supply concession is marred. PALYJA depends heavily on the \nGovernment\u2019s  regulatory  framework  and  commitment  to  policy  implementation.  In  the  1990s, \npreviously agreed tariff adjustments had not been implemented due to political considerations, \nparticularly in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, and as a result PALYJA has not always \nreceived  the  full  amount  it  was  entitled  under  the  1998  cooperation  agreement.  The \nGovernment\u2019s inability to implement tariff increases affected the ability of PALYJA to collect the \nnecessary  water  charges  to  fund  its  capital  expenditure  program.  Issues  such  as  this  will  still \nhave  crucial  implications  for  PALYJA\u2019s  operating  and  financial  standing.  The  tariff  risk  is \nmitigated  through  (i)  establishment  of  the  automatic  tariff  adjustment  mechanism,  which \nresolves the main concern for the lack of sufficient water revenue to cover the water charge; (ii) \nPAM  Jaya  using  surplus  revenues  to  repay  amounts  owed  to  PALYJA  as  a  result  of  earlier \nfailures to make tariff adjustments; (iii) ADB involvement in PALYJA as through its public-private \n\n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2006.

Water  Loss  Risk.  While  the  water  loss  ratio  has  decreased  from  62%  to  47%  since \nPALYJA  took  over  operation  of  the  West  Jakarta  water  supply  system,  water  loss  remains  a \nsignificant problem for PALYJA. The main causes of water loss are (i) an aging pipeline network \nwith water loss through leakages, and (ii) high susceptibility to illegal connections in PALYJA\u2019s \ndistribution  network.  PALYJA\u2019s  ability  to  rehabilitate  the  pipeline  network  and  to  control  illegal \nconnections  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  its  financial  performance.  PALYJA\u2019s  proposed  5-year \ncapital expenditure program is designed to address these issues. ADB support for the program \nwill help mitigate the risk of water loss. \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n48. \nFirst,  the  Project  supports  the  Government\u2019s  effort  to  meet  the  MDG  target  for  water \nsupply  by  providing  much-needed  water  supply  infrastructure.  Second,  through  assistance  to \nPALYJA in developing its capital expenditure program, the Project will help the people of West \nJakarta gain access to more consistent and affordable water supply, especially for low-income \nhouseholds.  Third,  the  Project  complements  ADB  public  sector  efforts  to  improve  the  legal \nframework in the water sector as well as policy dialogue with the Government on overall water \nsector  management  and  improvement.  For  instance,  the  proposed  Integrated  Citarum  Water \nResource Management Project will help improve the upstream raw water supply system. Fourth, \nthe joint effort within ADB will also enhance the ability for PALYJA to gain access to additional \nprivate sector funds by way of demonstrating the positive influence ADB is expected to have on \nmanaging  the  Government\u2019s  responsibilities  with  regard  to  public-private  partnerships.  Finally, \nby  using  funds  raised  in  the  local  market,  the  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \ndevelopment of local capital markets. \n \nE. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n49. \nThe  development  effectiveness  of  the  Project  is  assessed  in  terms  of  private  sector \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability.  At  the  company  level,  PALYJA \nwill  be  in  a  position  to  comfortably  fund  its  proposed  capital  expenditure  program,  a  key \ncomponent to expanding water supply coverage in West Jakarta. The delivery of services to a \nbroader  customer  base  will  lead  to  increased  revenue  and  reinforce  PALYJA\u2019s  financial \nsustainability and continuous operations through the life of the concession. On a broader level, \nthe  development  effectiveness  is  reflected  in  the  establishment  of  a  well-maintained  and \nefficient water supply system in West Jakarta. The impact of this can be observed during the life \nof the concession by assessing the quality of the distribution system. Further, the longer tenor \noffered  by  the  ADB  local  currency  loan,  which  is  not  available  in  the  local  market,  will  lead  to \nless cost pass-through to the consumers as a result of smaller tariff increases, which will in turn \nlead  to  more  accessibility  and  affordability  of  water.  The  impact  can  be  measured  through \nassessment of the growth rate in the number of customers and the comparative rate of increase \nof water tariffs. \n \nF. \n\nAnticorruption Measures   \n\n50. \nPALYJA  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and \npolicy  relating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  PALYJA  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nlaundering,  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in \nsuch  activities.  The  loan  documentation  between  ADB  and  PALYJA  will  allow  ADB  to \ninvestigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings \n \n\nVI. \n\nEXPOSURE LIMITS \n\n51. \nThis  investment  will  represent  1.53%  of  the  total  portfolio  of  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \nOperations Department, will increase ADB investment in the water supply and sanitation sector \nfrom 1.21% to 2.72%, and will increase ADB investment in Indonesia from 3.92% to 5.39%. The \nproposed assistance is within approved country and sector exposure limits. \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n52. \nConsistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nPALYJA. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will enter into \na  suitable  loan  agreement  and  other  required  documents,  following  the  approval  of  the \nproposed loan by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. These agreements will be on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n53. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan,  without  government  guarantee,  of  up  to  Rp455,000,000,000  to  PT  PAM \nLyonnaise Jaya (PALYJA) for the West Jakarta Water Supply Development Project from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  based  on  procedures \napplicable  to  ADB  local  currency  loans  for  private  sector  operations,  and  on  such  other  terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report and as may \nbe reported to the Board. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nC.

The estimated water resources by island group are given in Table A2.1, \nwhich  indicate  that  water  demand  is  only  about  1.7%  of  potential.  Most  of  the  demand  is \nconcentrated in Java or around urban areas in other islands where the demand/supply ratio is \nfar more critical, especially during the dry season. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Water Resources by Island \n\nSurfa ce     \nW a te r     \n\nPote ntia l \n\nGround   \nW a te r    \nPote ntia l \n\nLow      \nFlow      \nAva ila ble  \n\nDe m a nd/Supply Ra tio \n(1990) (m 3/s) \n\nAre a  \n('000 km 2)\n139\n81\n470\n535\n187\n78\n414\n1,904\n\n(m 3/s)\n\n(m 3/s)\n\n(m 3/s)\n\nDMI\n\nTota l\n\nIsla nd\nJava / Bali\nNusa Tenggara\nSumatra\nKalimantan\nSulawesi\nMaluku\nIrian Jaya\nTota l\nkm2 = square kilometer; m3/s = cubic meters per second; DMI = domestic, municipal, industrial water, n.a. = not \navailable. \nSource: Directorate of Planning and Programming, Ministry of Public Works. 1990. \n\nIrriga tion\n950\n70\n271\n19\n120\n5\n2\n1,437\n\n786\n90\n4,704\n6,956\n561\n391\n4,140\n17,628\n\n6,199\n1,777\n23,660\n32,279\n2,488\n3,373\n28,061\n97,837\n\n1,074\n73\n297\n26\n126\n6\n1\n1,603\n\n         \n         \n       \n       \n         \n         \n       \n       \n\n95\n21\nn.a.\nn.a.\n44\n9\nn.a.\n169\n\n124\n3\n26\n7\n6\n1\n1\n168\n\n      \n    \n\n      \n      \n\n      \n\n     \n\n    \n\n    \n\nStora ge  \nAva ila ble  \n(m 3/s)\n245\n\u2014\n150\n150\n\u2014\n\u2014\n\u2014\n545\n\n \n\n2. \nWater quality varies depending on the season (wet versus dry), year, factory discharges, \nand  other  factors.  In  many  urban  development  areas  the  rivers  are  badly  polluted.  The \nGovernment, aware of the problem and of the need to clean up the environment, started a clean \nriver program (Prokasih) in 1989. \n \nThe objective of Prokasih is to reduce the pollution load from industrial activities through \n3. \na  two-step  process.  In  the  first  5-year  program,  the  Government  conducted  an  inventory  of \nindustries;  identified  potential  polluters;  evaluated  pollution  control  measures;  and  advised \nindustries on wastewater treatment, effluent standards, and pollution control regulations. During \nthe second 5 years, the offending industries entered into a commitment with local government to \nreduce  pollution  load,  treat  their  discharges  using  the  polluter  pays  principle,  and  pay  fines \nimposed  by  the  regional  government.  According  to  the  follow-on  Regulation  20/1990,  each \nindustry  must  monitor  its  discharges  monthly  and  report  these  together  with  wastewater  plant \ntreatment  performance  to  the  provincial  government.  In  reality,  few  industries  comply  with  this \nregulation; most discharges do not conform to the prescribed standards; few sanctions or fines \nare imposed; and water quality continues to deteriorate. \n \nFlooding occurs regularly throughout Indonesia and affects the water quality, particularly \n4. \nin  the  wet  season.  The  incidence  and  extent  of  flooding  vary  according  to  rainfall  profile  and \nintensity, precedent soil saturation, ground permeability, and other factors. Human deforestation, \npoor  agricultural  practices,  and  extensive  paving  are  increasing  runoff  from  catchment  areas. \nThe  impact  of  floods  is  worsened  by  the  filling  in  of  wetlands,  clogging  up  of  facilities,  and \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nincreased channel roughness due to slum housing and plantations along the banks. In addition \nto flooding, these conditions can create devastating landslides, mud flows, and seiches.15  \n \nC. \n\nWater Supply \n\nOnly  39%  of  the  urban  population  and  15%  of  the  rural  population  have  access  to \n5. \nadequate water supply. Water is supplied and distributed by different providers, depending on \nthe area covered. The providers are (i) 318 PDAMs, generally supplying piped water; (ii) formal \nprivate sector; and (iii) small-scale private water providers, which make up the informal private \nsector.

Formulation of Irrigation Development Program  \n \nin Republic of Indonesia, draft final report. \n \n \n6. \nBefore  1999,  the  central  Government  financed  all  public  utility  investments  through \ngrants,  subsidies,  or  loans  to  the  regional  governments.  Upon  the  issuance  of  Law  No.  22  of \n1999  on  Regional  Governance,  the  central  Government  devolved  authority  for  all  aspects  of \nlocal infrastructure and service delivery, including planning, providing, financing, and managing \nwater supply and sanitation, to district and city governments (kabupaten and kota). \n \n\n75,569\n22,767\n6,013\n16,162\n6,485\n281\n127,277\n\n      \n      \n        \n      \n        \n           \n    \n\n       \n\n                                                 \n15  Seiches are river surges that usually result from large landslips causing a temporary dam in the river, or from the \n\ncollapse of temporary logging dams. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n17 \n\nAfter  decentralization, the  bulk  of  financing  responsibilities  for  water  supply  rested  with \n7. \nthe  PDAMs.  However,  many  of  the  PDAMs  throughout  Indonesia  are  unable  to  provide \nminimum  services  to  consumers  and  are  financially  unsustainable  due  to  inadequate  tariffs. \nFurther, the lack of financial sustainability has resulted in heavy debt obligations incurred by the \nPDAMs to the central Government amounting to $500 million, on top of other forms of external \nand commercial debt. \n \n8. \nTo  address  the  difficulties  faced  by  PDAMs,  the  Indonesian  House  of  Representatives \napproved  the  new  draft  law  on  water  resources.16 The  law  explicitly  stipulates  private  sector \nparticipation  in  water  supply  services,  thereby  breaking  the  monopoly  of  the  PDAMs. \nSpecifically,  the  law  provides  clarity  on  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  regional  governments, \nPDAMs, and private partners, as well as establishes the legal framework for use of water and \nresource protection. Water resource and river basin management was delegated to Perum Jasa \nTirta  I  and  Perum  Jasa  Tirta  II,  wastewater  disposal  and  solid  waste  management  to  regional \ngovernments, and water supply provision to the PDAMs. If the PDAMs are unable to undertake \nthe  task  themselves,  the  law  stipulates  that  they  should  delegate  the  task  to  other  business \nentities and the private sector. \n \n9. \nThe water resources law also requires the establishment of a national regulator for water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  which  is  to  function  independently.  Establishment  of  the  regulator  is \nintended  to  maintain  the  balance  of  interests  among  the  governments,  operators,  and \nconsumers. The regulator is anticipated to be instrumental in creating an enabling environment \nfor private sector participation, and to help set standards on operating and financial performance \nfor the PDAMs. In summary, measures to improve PDAM efficiency and financial and operating \nperformance  include  (i)  imposing  cost-recovery  tariffs,  (ii)  improving  revenue  collection,  (iii) \nenhancing  financial  management  and  accounting,  (iv)  reducing  nonrevenue  water,  (v) \nexpanding coverage with service connections, and (vi) improving customer orientation. \n \nD. \n\nWastewater Management and Sanitation \n\n10. \nThe primary goal of sanitation, public health, and wastewater management is to provide \nthe  rural  and  urban  populations  with  facilities  for  the  safe,  efficient,  and  sustainable  collection \nand  disposal  of  wastewater,  thereby  producing  a  clean  and  healthy  living  environment  in \nhouseholds and neighborhoods.  \n \n11.  Wastewater  management  comprises  two  distinct  services.  The  first  involves  removing \nwastewater from the point of generation to provide households with  a clean and healthy living \nenvironment.  The  second  comprises  collecting  sewage  from  the  point  of  generation  and \nconveying it away from the living environment for treatment and disposal in a way that does not \npollute  the  environment.  In  urban  areas,  these  functions  are  performed  by  urban  public \nwastewater  services:  sewerage  and  sewage  treatment  plants.  In  rural  areas,  the  function  is \nperformed by toilets connected to septic tanks, where sewage can be denatured and rendered \nfor agricultural use or disposal. \n \nUrban sewerage coverage in Indonesia is low, with only seven cities having some kind \n12. \nof partial network. Most people rely on on-site sanitation facilities such as septic tanks. However, \nsewage collection and disposal is generally inadequate, and most sewage still ends up in rivers \nor  canals.  Widespread  contamination  of  surface  water  and  groundwater  has  resulted  in \nrecurrent  epidemics  and  a  high  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  as  well  as  environmental \nimpact.  \n\n                                                 \n16  Water Resources Law 7/2004, approved February 2004. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nRural households mainly rely on self-provision through shallow groundwater abstraction, \n13. \nrainwater collection, or use of surface water from nearby rivers and springs. Only about 27% of \nrural  households  claim  to  regularly  use  toilet  facilities.  Community-managed  systems  serve \nabout  30%  of  the  rural  population,  mostly  through  their  own  efforts  or  with  the  support  of \nto  wastewater \nnational  and/or  donor-funded \nmanagement and available facilities leads to increasing risks of diarrhea, intestinal worms, skin \ndisease, and other water-related diseases such as malaria and dengue. \n \n\nlack  of  sufficient  access \n\ninitiatives.  The \n\n1. \n\nKey Challenges \n\n14. \nThe  key  issues  affecting  Indonesia\u2019s  water  sector  are  (i)  low  service  coverage  with \npiped water supply, (ii) financially unsustainable water supply services, and (iii) lack of sanitation \nservices.  \n \n\na. \n\nLow Service Coverage with Piped Water Supply \n\nLack of access to water has a major impact on economic development, health, and well-\n15. \nbeing  of  the  population.  Many  of  the  PDAMs  throughout  Indonesia  are  barely  able  to  provide \nminimum services to consumers and have connected only about 39% of the urban population to \npiped  water  supply.  As  a  result,  over  70%  of  the  population  obtains  water  from  potentially \ncontaminated  sources.  Unsafe  drinking  water  leads  to  diarrhea,  which  is  the  second  leading \ncause of death of children under 5 years of age in the country and accounts for about 20% of \nchild deaths each year. \n \n\nb. \n\nUnsustainable Financing of Water Supply Services  \n\n16. \nThe  widespread  lack  of  cost  recovery  tariffs,  compounded  by  the  limited  size  of  the \nPDAMs  and  low  revenue  collection,  has  resulted  in  reduced  or  abandonment  of  maintenance \nand investment activities, deteriorating assets, as well as low service coverage and quality. Of \nthe 318 PDAMs, 82% are experiencing losses and 44% are operating unsustainably. Of these, \n119 have foreign debt and 146 have domestic debt.17   \n \n\nc. \n\nLack of Sanitation Services \n\n17. \nPoor  sanitation  services  impact  negatively  on  public  health  and  the  well-being  of  the \npopulation. The high incidence of waterborne diseases is a potent indicator of the problems in \nthe  sector.  Every  year,  at  least  300  of  1,000  Indonesians  suffer  from  waterborne  disease, \nincluding  cholera,  dysentery,  and  typhoid  fever,  according  to  the  Ministry  of  Health.  Formal \nsewerage systems in Indonesia have been constructed in selected areas of a few large cities, \nbut  most  are  underutilized  and  underfunded,  and  therefore  unable  to  realize  the  planned \nbenefits of these systems. Overall, about 3% for the urban population is connected to sewerage. \nThe  vast  majority  of  citizens  still  rely  on  on-site  sanitation  (e.g.,  septic tanks,  and  pit  latrines), \nwhile many low-income families rely on grossly polluted drains and urban waterways.  \n \nE. \n\nHistory of Water Supply in Jakarta \n\n18. \nThe water supply system in Jakarta originally started in 1920 under the Dutch through a \ncombination of deep wells and springs. As the city grew, demand for water also increased and \nled  to  the  construction  of  new  water  treatment/supply  facilities  with  state,  bilateral,  and \nmultilateral  assistance.  The  first  large  water  treatment  plant  in  Jakarta,  Pejompongan  I  \n(2  cubic  meters/second  [m3/sec]),  was  built  in  1953  and  the  Pejompongan  II  water  treatment \nplant (3 m3/sec) in 1964. In the 1980s, during great urban and industrial development in Jakarta, \n                                                 \n17  PDAM Performance Assessment Guidelines, Home Ministerial Decree No.47/1999.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n19 \n\ntwo water treatment plants, Pulogadung (4 m3/sec) and Buaran (5 m3/sec) were built. In addition, \nseven smaller water treatment plants (<0.2 m3/sec) began operating before 1997.   \n \n19. \nJakarta\u2019s raw water supply mostly comes from surface water, of which 80% is from the \nCitarum River, located east of Jakarta. The water is managed through several dams, including \nthe  Saguling,  Cirata,  and  Jatiluhur  dams.  These  dams  are  also  used  for  electric  power \ngeneration,  river  flow  management,  irrigation,  tourism,  and  industrial  purposes.  The  water  is \nchanneled  for  distribution  through  the  West  Tarum  Canal.  Another  15%  comes  from  the \nCisadane River, west of Jakarta; the remaining 5% comes from smaller rivers flowing from West \nJava Province to the Jakarta area, such as the Ciliwung, Krukut, and Pesanggarahan rivers.   \n \n20. \nIn 1968, PDAM Jakarta was separated from the Ministry of Public Works, and in 1977, \nthe Jakarta Water Supply Enterprise, Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya (PAM Jaya) \nwas  established  to  replace  PDAM  Jakarta  as  the  provider  of  water  supply  and  sewerage \nservices for Jakarta.18 \n \nDue  to  the  lack  of  discipline  and  monitoring,  extension  of  services  for  production \n21. \ncapacity and distribution to end users were not ideal. By 1997, water supply infrastructure was \ncharacterized  by  old  and  rusted  pipes,  bad  connections,  damaged  valves,  and  groundwater \nintrusion resulting in decreased water pressure in customers\u2019 taps. Unaccounted for water was \naround 57% due to illegal connections, physical losses, and meter tampering.  \n \n22. \nIn  1994,  the  Jakarta  city  government  developed  a  master  plan  to  improve  access  to \ndrinking  water  for  the  population  of  Jakarta.  By  2019,  83%  of  Jakarta  was  expected  to  have \naccess to drinking water. To achieve this goal, the key activities included (i) establish new water \ntreatment plants, (ii) expand and build new pipeline systems, (iii) rehabilitate damaged pipelines, \n(iv)  increase  the  number  of  connections,  (v)  increase  water  pressure  and  (iv)  decrease \nunaccounted for water. \n \n23. \nTo  accelerate  the  improvement  of  water  delivery  service  and  to  accommodate  the \nredirection  of  government  policy  in  infrastructure  development  from  public  financing  to  private \nfinancing, private sector participation was encouraged. As a result, PAM Jaya entered into 25-\nyear  concession  agreements  with  two  private  operators,  effective  from  February  1998,  with \nSuez  Lyonnaise  des  Eaux  (PT  Pam  Lyonnaise  Jaya)  and  Thames  Water  International  (PT \nThames Pam Jaya), to serve the western and eastern parts of Jakarta respectively.  \n\n                                                 \n18  Regional Government Regulation No. 3/1977. \n\n \n\n\fASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK PRIVATE SECTOR OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA \n($\u2018000) \n\n \n\nCompany \n\nInvestment \nNo. \n \n\nADB \nLoan \n \n \nUnder Administration \n15.000 \n7039/979 \n15.000 \n7054/1023  PT Bakrie Finance Corp. \n15.000 \n7068/1083  PT Seamless Pipe Indonesia Jaya \n7224/2214  HSBC Bank USA, National Associationb  350.000 \n7239 \n7243/2251  PT Perusahan Gas Negara (Persero) \n\nPT BBL Danatama Finance \n\nDeutsche Bank AG \n\n\u2013 \n75.000 \n\nEquity \nInvestmenta \n \n \n\u2013 \n1.250 \n5.000 \n\u2013 \n0.200 \n\u2013 \n\n \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n9.800 \n\u2013 \n\n7252/2325  PT Semen Andalas Indonesia \n\nTBK \n\n \n\n \n\nPT Kratama Belindo Int\u2019l \nPT Gunung Garuda \nPT Bank UPPINDO \nPT Mediasarana Multi Finance \nPT Asian Development Securities Co. \nPT Indonesia Development Fund Ltd. \n\nDivested, Written Down, and Fully Repaid \n7005 \n7026/905 \n7029 \n7038/978 \n7044 \n7045 \n7088/1227  PT Wiraswata Gemilang  \n \nCanceled \n7004 \n\n \n\nBank Pembangunan Indonesia \n(BAPINDO) \nBAPINDO II \n\n45.000 \n \n \n\n\u2013 \n15.000 \n\u2013 \n5.000 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n17.000 \n \n \n\n\u2013 \n\n7030 \n7073/1119  PT Ispat Steel \n7100/1284  PT Sunnymas Prima Agung \n7129/1496  PT Banjarmasin Agrojaya Mandiri \n7148 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CFS = complementary financing scheme. \na   Equity investment includes direct equity investment, line of equity, and underwriting.  \nb    Tangguh liquefied natural gas project.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n\n\u2013 \n30.000 \n9.000 \n32.500 \n\u2013 \n\nSecondary Mortgage Facility \n\n68.000 \n \n \n0.400 \n\u2013 \n1.675 \n0.339 \n1.186 \n6.000 \n1.500 \n \n \n1.000 \n\n5.000 \n7.500 \n2.000 \n8.125 \n3.000 \n\n2\n0\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n3\n \n\ni\n\n \n\nGuarantee\n\nCFS \n\nCombined \nTotal \n\nDate of \nApproval \n\n \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n125.000 \n\n45.000 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\n \n15.000 \n16.250 \n20.000 \n350.000 \n10.000 \n200.000 \n\n158.000 \n \n \n0.400 \n15.000 \n1.675 \n5.339 \n1.186 \n6.000 \n18.500 \n \n \n1.000 \n\n5.000 \n37.500 \n11.000 \n40.625 \n3.000 \n\n26-Oct-89\n09-Aug-90\n28-May-91\n14-Dec-05\n26-Jul-06\n10-Aug-06\n\n16-Mar-07\n\n25-Jun-85\n27-Sep-88\n17-Nov-88\n26-Oct-89\n19-Dec-89\n19-Dec-89\n22-Apr-93\n\n25-Jun-85\n\n29-Nov-88\n19-Nov-91\n07-Dec-93\n28-Nov-96\n25-Jun-98\n\n\u2013 \n \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n \n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n21     \n\nPT PAM LYONNAISE JAYA: DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY OF CONCESSION \n\n \n\n1. \nPT  PAM  Lyonnaise  Jaya  (PALYJA)  is  a  subsidiary  company  of  SUEZ  Environment  of \nFrance  and  is  one  of  the  largest  water  service  providers  in  Indonesia.

Annual Report. Jakarta. \n \nC. \n\nOrganization Structure \n\n13. \nAs  of  March  2007,  PALYJA  has  1,400  employees,  of  which  902  are  employees \nseconded  from  Perusahaan  Daerah  Air  Minum  Jakarta  Raya  (PAM  Jaya)  at  the  outset  of  the \nconcession  period.  PALYJA  is  currently  in  the  process  of  integrating  seconded  employees  to \nbecome  permanent  employees  of PALYJA,  with  the  objective  of  enhancing  employee  equality \nand  providing  more  flexibility  with  regard  to  labor  management.  The  organization  chart  is \npresented in Figure A4.2. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nFigure A4.2: PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya Organization Chart \n\nSource: PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya. \n\n \n \n\nD. \n\nOperations \n\n14. \nPALYJA  operates  four  water  treatment  plants  including  Pejompongan  I  and  II  \n; Cilandak South; and Taman Kota North, and more than 5,000 km of primary, secondary, and \ntertiary water supply networks.  \n \n\n1. \n\nTreated Water Production \n\n15. \nSixty percent of PALYJA\u2019s water supplies are treated in the Pejompongan plants using \nwater  sourced  from  the  West  Tarum  Canal  system,  which  originates  from  Jatiluhur  reservoir,  \n70 km southeast of Jakarta. The West Tarum Canal system is operated by Perum Jasa Tirta II, \na  state-owned  company.  Thirty-four  percent  of  PALYJA\u2019s  water  supply  is  purchased,  as  bulk \ntreated  water,  from  Perusahaan  Daerah  Air  Minum  (PDAM)  Tangerang.  The  remaining  6%  of \nthe  company\u2019s  water  supply  is  from  other  surface  water,  which  is  treated  in  PALYJA\u2019s  water \ntreatment plants prior to distribution.  \n \n16. \nPALYJA\u2019s  abstraction  point  from  West  Tarum  Canal  is  located  at  Cawang  at  the \ndownstream  end.  During  the  dry  seasons  an  estimated  60%  of  the  raw  water  supplied  by  the \ncanal is from Jatiluhur; during the rest of the year it is between 20%-30%. The balance is mainly \nfrom  Bekasi  River.  Due  to  intensive  development  in  the  Bekasi  River  catchment,  the  water  is \nhighly  turbid,  especially  in  the  rainy  season  and  also  polluted  by  industrial  and  municipal \nwastewater.  The  volume  varies  substantially  during  heavy  rainfalls  in  the  catchment.  These \nsudden variations can affect water treatment plant operation and the treatment process. \n  \n17. \nEach of PALYJA\u2019s plants is equipped with treated water reservoirs and pumping facilities. \nThe two main water treatment plants at Pejompongan utilize electricity supplied by PLN as the \nsource of power to distribute treated water to PALYJA\u2019s distribution network. Each of the plants \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n27     \n\nhas two sources of electricity from PLN and during the 9 years of operation interruption of the \npower supply has been minimal, but has increased lately. \n \n\n2. \n\nDistribution Network \n\n18. \nPALYJA\u2019s  concession  area  extends  over  340  square  kilometers.  While  the  water \ndistribution  network  covers  the  city  center,  the  periphery  of  the  concession  area  has  limited \ncoverage.  The  distribution  network  consists  of  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  pipes  to \ntransport  and  distribute  treated  water  from  PALYJA\u2019s  production  and  pumping  facilities  to \nindividual  customers.  PALYJA  also  operates  a  limited  length  of  transmission  lines,  which \ntransport  bulk  treated  water,  supplied  by  PDAM  Tangerang,  from  the  Jakarta  city  boundary  to \nthe pumping facilities.  \n \n19. \nTo  date,  the  total  recorded  length  of  the  network  is  5,105  km,  of  which  7%  comprises \nprimary  mains  (>300  mm  in  diameter),  20%  secondary  pipelines  (150\u2013250  mm),  and  the \nremainder tertiary pipes (<150 mm). Since 1998, 1,500 km of new pipes have been laid as part \nof the extension program and about 646 km of pipes replaced. \n \n20. \nSince 1998, PALYJA has reduced water losses (commercial and physical losses) from \n62% to about 49%, as a result of a continuous rehabilitation program including (i) leak detection \nand  repair,  (ii)  network  rehabilitation  followed  by  decommissioning  of  old  pipes,  (iii)  pressure \ncontrol  to  reduce  leakage,  (iv)  customer  meter  replacement,  and  (v)  detection  of  illegal \nconnections and unregistered customers. \n \n\n3. \n\nCustomers \n\n21. \nSince 1998, PALYJA has increased the number of water connections to end users, from \n201,668  at  the  beginning  of  the  concession  to  351,230  at  the  end  of  2006.  This  represents  a \n74% increase as a result of network densification, expansion, and rehabilitation.  \n \n22. \nIn  developing  future  customers,  PALYJA  is  sensitive  to  providing  services  for  low-\nincome  customers,  ensuring  that  low-income  areas  are  given  priority  for  establishing  new \ndistribution  networks  and  connections.  Further,  the  water  tariffs  approved  by  the  governor  of \nJakarta are set such that social and low-income customers pay less for water than high-income \nindividuals and business entities. As a result, the number of low-income customers increased by \n456%  as  compared  with  the  50%  increase  of  middle  and  upper-income  customers  since  the \nbeginning of the concession. \n \n23. \nTo better serve customers and help ensure customer satisfaction, PALYJA has set up a \n24-hour call center to handle emergencies such as leaks, broken pipes, and other such events. \nBill  payment  is  facilitated  through  collaboration  with  a  number  of  entities,  and  customers  may \npay their bill in a number of ways, including Citibank 1 Bill, Bank BCA ATM, by direct debit, or at \nany  Jakarta  post  office.  Alternatively,  customers  can  pay  at  any  of  PALYJA\u2019s  own  payment \ncenters. To make customer management more efficient, PALYJA maintains an online customer \ninformation  system,  centralizing  customer  profiles  and  information  records  on  billing,  payment \ncollection,  and  the  reconciliation  process.  On  average,  approximately  80%  of  customers  pay \ntheir bill within 1 month of receipt; historically the overall collection rate is 97%\u201398%. \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nE. \n\nHistory of the Concession \n\n1. \n\nBackground \n\nSince  the  official  start  of  the  privatization  campaign  in  1995  at  the  orders  of  then \n24. \nPresident  Suharto,  Jakarta  developed  one  of  the  world\u2019s  largest  public-private  partnerships  in \nthe  water  sector.  The  city  of  Jakarta  was  divided  into  two  parts,  east  and  west,  with  the \nboundaries  determined  by  the  natural  flow  of  Ciliwung  River.  A  number  of  stakeholders  were \ninvolved in the privatization, including the Jakarta city government; PAM Jaya, the state-owned \nwater  utility;19 and  the  two  newly  established  private  companies,  PT  Thames  PAM  Jaya20 and \nPALYJA. \n \nOn  1  February  1998,  PALYJA  formally  entered  into  a  25-year  cooperation  agreement \n25. \nwith  the  Government.  The  concession  allows  PALYJA  to  take  over  responsibility  of  operation, \nmaintenance,  and  development  of  the  water  supply  system  from  PAM  Jaya,  including \nrehabilitation  and  expansion  of  the  water  supply  network,  meter  reading,  bill  collection,  and \ncustomer service. All existing assets, except the PAM Jaya  headquarters office, are managed \nby the private partner, and at the end of concession all assets including new assets built by the \nprivate partner will be returned to PAM Jaya. \n \n26.  Within 3 months of signing the original cooperation agreement, Indonesia was involved \nin  the  economic  turmoil  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis.  Following  the  overthrow  of  the  Suharto \nregime in 1998, challenges were made to the legitimacy of the two concessions. The Indonesian \nGovernment  under  President  Habibie  temporarily  reclaimed  the  concessions  under  public \nauthority.  Control  of  the  West  Jakarta  concession  was  returned  to  PALYJA,  but  not  without \nrenegotiation of the terms and conditions of the original cooperation agreement. In 2001, PAM \nJaya and PALYJA finalized the terms of a renegotiated cooperation agreement.  \n \n \n\nDelinking Tariffs and Revenues \n\n2. \n\n27. \nOne of the innovations of the concession is the delinking of (i) the revenues received by \nPALYJA under the cooperation agreement (the water charge), and (ii) revenues collected from \nconsumers  by  PALYJA  (the  water  revenues).  This  system  offers  two  main  advantages:  (i)  it \nhelps  balance  revenues  between  the  two  concessionaires  in  Jakarta,  given  the  differences  in \nsocial  and  economic  characteristics  of  the  two  concessions,  which  affect  both  costs  and \nrevenues; and (ii) it allows the Government greater flexibility in the timing of tariff increases. \n \n28. \nThe water charge received by PALYJA comprises a flat rate of revenue for each unit of \nwater delivered, which is set according to PALYJA\u2019s financial projections, including projections \nof  operating  and  capital  expenditures  and  financing  costs,  to  provide  a  fixed  rate  of  return  on \nequity  (in  rupiah)  of  22%  over  the  life  of  the  concession.  The  water  charge  is  adjusted  every \nsemester  to  account  for  fluctuations  in  the  exchange  and  interest  rates,  and  is  reviewed  at  5-\nyear intervals in the rate rebasing exercise. Rate rebasing establishes a revised operating and \nfinancial  plan,  which  is  used  as  the  basis  for  establishing  appropriate  charges  for  the \nsubsequent 5 years. \n \n\n                                                 \n19  PAM Jaya had the historical responsibility of water supply in the city of Jakarta. Appendix 2 provides more details \n\non the background of PAM Jaya operations prior to the concessions. \n\n20  PT  Thames  PAM  Jaya  is  a  joint  venture  between  RWE  Thames  (Thames),  a  British  multinational  owned  by \n\nGerman Rheinisch- Westf\u00e4lisches Elektrizit\u00e4tswerk, and PT Kekarpola Airindo (PKA), a local company \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n29     \n\nCustomers,  on  the  other  hand,  pay  differentiated  tariffs  according  to  a  preestablished \n29. \nschedule. The Jakarta city government is responsible for assessing and setting the water tariff \nschedule; and a decree of the governor of Jakarta is required to change the water tariff.  \n \n \n\nRevenue Sharing \n\n3. \n\n30. \nThe water revenues collected by PALYJA are transferred into an escrow account, from \nwhich funds are transferred to PALYJA to meet the water charge and to PAM Jaya. According \nto  priorities  established  in  the  cooperation  agreement,  funds  will  be  made  available  in  the \nfollowing  order:  (i)  capital  and  operating  expenditures  for  PALYJA  and  relevant  financing \ncharges;  (ii)  payment  to  PAM  Jaya  and  the  Jakarta  city  government,  debt  repayment  to  the \nMinistry of Finance, and the regulatory body\u2019s requirements; and (iii) payments for the revenue \nshortfall and other monies. The mechanisms are illustrated in Figure A4.4. \n \n\nFigure A4.4: Revenue Sharing under Concession \n\n \n\n \n\nDKI  =  Daerah  Khusus  Ibukota,  PALYJA  =  PT  PAM  Lyonnaise  Jaya,  PAM  Jaya  =  Perusahaan \nDaerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya. \nSource: PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya. \n\n \n\nRevenue Shortfall and Corrections \n\n31. \nThe original intention was that water tariffs would always be set such that water revenue \nexceeds the water charge by a margin sufficient to cover (i) administrative costs of PAM Jaya \nand the regulatory body, (ii) repayments due on PAM Jaya\u2019s previously incurred loans from the \nMinistry of Finance, and (iii) PALYJA\u2019s operating and capital investment costs.  \n \n32. \nHowever,  the  combination  of  the  tariff  freeze  imposed  through  2000  and  the  high \nincrease of the water charge as a result of the rupiah devaluation and soaring inflation resulted \nin a shortfall of water revenue relative to the water charge. The revenue shortfall was treated as \n\n \n\n \n \n \n4. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nan account payable to PALYJA from PAM Jaya, to be paid when water tariffs could once again \nbe raised so that the water revenue exceeded the water charge. \n \n33.  Water  tariffs  were  first  increased  by  35%  in  April  2001  at  the  conclusion  of  the \nrenegotiated  cooperation  agreement  negotiations.  For  a  short  period,  water  revenues  were \nsufficient  to  cover  the  water  charge.  As  part  of  the  renegotiated  cooperation  agreement,  the \nJakarta  government  committed  to  increase  tariffs  in  both  January  2002  and  January  2003. \nNeither  of  these  tariff  increases  was  implemented,  and  as  a  result, water  revenue  once  again \ndropped  below  the  water  charge,  adding  to  the  accrued  liabilities  of  PAM  Jaya  to  PALYJA. \nTariffs were eventually raised in April 2003 (by 40%) and in January 2004 (by 30%). In 2005, a \nproposal \ntariff  adjustment  mechanism\u2014was \nimplemented by the Jakarta government with the objective of keeping water revenue above the \nwater  charge  on  a  consistent  basis.  Since  the  second  quarter  of  2003,  water  revenue  has \nconsistently  exceeded  the  water  charge  and  PAM  Jaya  has  applied  some  of  the  excess \nrevenues to repaying amounts owed to PALYJA.  \n\nincreases\u2014automatic \n\nfor  automatic \n\ntariff \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n31 \n\nENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DUE DILIGENCE REPORT21 \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nThe Jakarta water supply enterprise, Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya (PAM \n1. \nJaya),  a  state-owned  enterprise  established  in  1977,  was  responsible  for  water  supply  and \nsewerage services in Jakarta until late 1997. In 1997, the right to operate the city\u2019s water supply \nsystem was offered to private enterprises under two separate concessions: PT PAM Lyonnaise \nJaya  (PALYJA)  in  West  Jakarta  and  PT  James  Pam  Jaya  in  East  Jakarta.  They  began \noperations  in  early  1998.  PALYJA  shareholders  comprise  SUEZ  Environment  (51%),  PT \nAstratel  Nusantara 22  (Astratel,  30%),  and  Citigroup  Financial  Products,  Inc.  (19%).  SUEZ \nEnvironment  is  a  branch  of  the  global  SUEZ  SA  (SUEZ)23 that  supplies  services,  plant,  and \nequipment drinking water production and distribution, wastewater collection and treatment, and \nwaste processing and recycling. \n \n2. \nPALYJA  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  for  the  development \nof the water supply network in Western Jakarta in support of the Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG)  target  of  reducing  the  proportion  of  people  without  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and \nbasic sanitation by half by 2015 (MDG 7, Target 10), The proposed ADB loan will be used by \nPALYJA  to  partially  fund  its  capital  expenditure  program  during  the  third  5-year  period  of  the \nconcession  (2008\u20132012)  for  the  expansion  of  the  company\u2019s  water  production  and  supply \nnetwork  in  its  West  Jakarta  concession  area.  While  PALYJA\u2019s  corporate  vision  is  to  \u201cbe  the \npreferred  water  services  provider  in  Indonesia  by  satisfying  customers  and  adding  value  to \nstakeholders,\u201d  its  mission  statement  includes  a  commitment  to  be  \u201csocially  responsible,  to \nprotect the environment and to implement good governance.\u201d24 \n \nB. \n \nPALYJA  is  a  subsidiary  of  SUEZ  and  is  one  of  the  largest  water  service  providers  in \n3. \nIndonesia.  PALYJA  entered  into  a  25-year  cooperation  agreement  with  the  Government \ncommencing 1 February 1998. The scope of services under the agreement includes the design, \nconstruction,  refurbishment,  and  operation  of  water  supply  systems,  technical  and  quality \ncontrol, human resources and training, financing of new works, and billing and collection. \n \n4. \nPALYJA  has  almost  1,400  employees,  of  which  about  900  are  employees  seconded \nfrom  PAM  Jaya  at  the  outset  of  the  concession.  PALYJA  is  currently  integrating  seconded \nemployees  to  become  permanent  employees  of  PALYJA,  with  the  objective  of  enhancing \nemployee equality and providing more flexibility in labor management. \n \n5. \ninclude \n \n                                                 \n21  \n\nPALYJA\u2019s  major  improvements  and  achievements  achieved  after  9  years  of  operation \n\nThis  report  is  based  on  a  mission  (S.

PALYJA\u2019s  Company  Regulations  2006\u20132008  are  based  on \nPancasila  and  the  Indonesian  Constitution  (UUD  1945),  and  prevailing  human  resource \nregulations in Indonesia. The regulations contain work requirements, procedures, and rights, as \nwell  as  obligations  of  the  company  and  employees.  PALYJA  subscribes  to  all  International \nLabor  Organization  conventions  related  to  workplace  conditions  that  have  been  ratified  in \nIndonesia, particularly as its shareholders are SUEZ, a major global employer, and Astratel, one \nof  Indonesia\u2019s  largest  conglomerates.  All  employees  have  positions  that  are  fully  pensionable \nwith adequate benefits.  \n \n7. \nWorkplace  Conditions.  Health  and  safety  are  covered  by  Articles  44\u201353  of  the \nCompany Regulations 2006\u20132008.25 Occupational accidents are covered under PT Jamsostek26 \nregulations.  A  comprehensive  employee  safety  handbook  is  issued  to  all  employees  and \ncontractors,  and  a  signed  statement  of  understanding  kept  on  file.  An  exceptional  feature  of \nPALYJA\u2019s commitment is that it has a well-structured health and safety strategy and action plan \nwith  clear  objectives,  processes,  and  targets.  PALYJA  aims  to  achieve  Gold  (Occupational \nHealth  and  Safety  Management  System)  and  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  Assessment \nSpecification  18001  by  2009.  Grievances  are  handled  through  an  employee  protection  panel, \nwhich  consists  of  representatives  of  PALYJA,  PAM  Jaya,  and  the  PALYJA  labor  union. \nCurrently,  PALYJA  does  not  have  a  union,  although  PAM  Jaya  has  three  unions.  Within  the \norganization,  the  Health  Safety  Department  reports  to  the  director,  corporate  affairs.  Accident \nrates have been very low, with only one work-related accident reported in 2007, and no fatalities \nreported since PALYJA assumed its responsibilities. As corporate offices and plants are located \nin  the  city,  the  sites  have  basic  first-aid  facilities,  with  immediate  access  to  local  hospitals. \nHazardous wastes, essentially chlorine, are stored and secured in regulated locations to ensure \nsafety for workers on-site.

Water  Supply-Related  Social  Issues.  In  the  area  served  by  PALYJA,  affordability  for \nlow-income consumers is assured because of the significant cross-subsidy from non-domestic \nconsumers,  who  pay  about  Rp12,500/cubic  meter  (m3)  compared  with  Rp1,050/m3  for  low-\nincome  clients.  While  significant  groundwater  is  extracted  through  borewells,  for  which  the \napproximate  cost  is  Rp3,500/m3,  consumers  are  gradually  appreciating  the  convenience  of \nassured -clean water supply compared with the bacteria-laden and mineral-heavy groundwater.  \n \n11. \nFollowing  the  lead  of  its  two  major  shareholders,  SUEZ  and  Astratel,  PALYJA  has  a \nstructured  approach  to  community  relations:  community  development  programs,  low-income \nconsumers  (water  for  all),  orphanages  (tuition),  disaster  (Jogjakarta  earthquake),  26  water \ntankers free for those who have no access (slums, breakdowns/interruptions), and slum water \nreservoirs.  PALYJA  finances  about  $2.5  million  ($5  million  is  the  total  if  TPJ  included)  of  low-\nincome water access schemes under the World Bank\u2019s Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid \nfor some 7,000 families. Responding to the recent tsunami in Aceh, PALYJA set up six mobile \nwater purification units, placed four staff in the area for more than 3 months to be responsible \nfor  continuous  delivery  of  potable  water  using  two  50,000-liter  water  supply  vehicles, \ncoordinated the logistics of 18 potable water supply vehicles in the area that were subsequently \nturned over to a nongovernment organization, assigned two people to maintain the water supply \nline  until  connections  were  reestablished,  and  provided  training  to  PDAM  Aceh\u2019s  municipal \nwater company. In addition the Group28 and Fondation Suez made substantial cash donations.29  \n \n\n                                                 \n28  \n\nenvironment and water supply situations worldwide. \n\nSUEZ  maintains  a  volunteer  humanitarian  aid  group,  Aquassistance,  which  responds  to  emergency \n\n29  Created in 1992, the Suez Foundation lends support to children in adversity. It assists projects that contribute to \nthe respect, protection, and full development of children throughout the world. Its three priority areas of concern are \nchildren  facing  prolonged  hospitalization,  children  infected  with  AIDS,  and  children  who  are  victims  of  profound \nupheaval or whose lives are extremely precarious.  \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nEnvironmental Issues \n\nD. \n \n\n1. \n\nCorporate Environment Policy   \n\n \nPALYJA\u2019s corporate environment charter was approved on 10 October 2006. Following \n12. \nthe president\u2019s remarks,30 the charter\u2019s preamble sets out four areas through which it intends to \nfulfill PALYJA commitment to environmental management:  \n \n\ntaking account of environmental and sustainable development \nrespect for environmental protection and public health laws \norganization and responsibilities \nmobilizing each employee \n\nenvironmental analysis \nrisk prevention \ncrisis management \nwillingness to listen \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCommitment \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \nUnderstanding \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \nKnow-how \n(a) \n(b) \nSharing \n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \n\nresearch and development \nreducing adverse impacts and improving the environment \n\ncommunication \npartnership \nawareness raising, education, and training \nsponsorship \n\n \n13. \nThe  areas  cover  those  identified  by  ADB  as  essential  elements  of  an  environmental \nmanagement  system  (EMS):  policy  statement,  work  processes  and  procedures,  organization, \nbudgeting,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  The  EMS  is  also  consistent  with  the  requirements  of \nIndonesia\u2019s Law 23 on Environmental Management (1997).  \n \nThe  EMS  reflects  the  corporate  philosophies  of  the  two  principal  shareholders,  SUEZ \n14. \nand Astratel. SUEZ, a member of the United Nations Global Compact and its 10 principles since \n2000,  has  explicit  commitment  to  and  defined  strategic  directions  in  five  priority  areas  in \nsupporting  sustainable  development  objectives: \nthe  values  of  sustainable \ndevelopment in practices and culture, integrating sustainable development in commercial offers \nfor  the  benefit  of  customers  and  users,  protecting  the  environment, 31  promoting  the  social \n\nreflecting \n\n                                                 \n30  \u201cPALYJA is committed to the protection of the environment and  will employ environmental management systems \nand  procedures  specifically  designed  to  its  business  process  to  prevent  activities  and/or  conditions  that  pose  a \nthreat to (human health, safety) the environment,  which includes  waste minimization, prevention of pollution, and \nreasonable  efforts  to  comply  with  all  relevant  environmental  legislation  and  regulations.  PALYJA  will  work \ncontinuously to improve the effectiveness of its environmental management; offering customers the most efficient \ntechniques  and  the  best  know-how;  providing  appropriate  environmental  training  and  educating  employees  to  be \nenvironmentally  responsible  on  the  job  and  at  home;  and  monitoring  environmental  performance  regularly.  All \nprocesses of production and all damage to the environment depend on how individual people work. No matter how \nadvanced the environmental technology is, its result depends on the measure of environmental awareness enjoyed \nby those who operate it.\u201d \n\n31  The  subpriorities  are:  \u201cmaintain  compliance  at  our  sites  and  manage  regulatory  changes;  measure  and  control \nenvironmental risks within the Suez Risk Management Policy; minimize the environmental impact of our activities \nover  time;  expand  environmental  management  systems.\u201d  SUEZ,  Sustainable  Development:  Cornerstone  of  Our \nStrategy - 10 Years of Social Responsibility Initiatives, 2006. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\nto \n\nits  stakeholders: \n\nfully  recognizes  accountability \n\ncommitment of SUEZ, acting as a corporate citizen, and ensuring local roots for SUEZ business. \nfinancial, 32  social, 33 \nThe  company \ncommercial, 34  and  government. 35  Among  other  notable  initiatives  that  SUEZ  seeks  to \ndisseminate  across  its operations  is  gender  parity,  with  a  working  group  whose  mandate  is  to \nreduce gender disparities and support the work of a parity observatory. SUEZ has about 2,000 \nsites certified ISO 14001, ISO 9001 V2000 or EMAS. The Group set up the International Social \nObservatory  in  1998  as  a  forum  to  observe,  analyze,  and  integrate  human  and  social \ndimensions into business decisions.   \n \n15. \nDemonstrating  a  strong  and  consistent  commitment  to  environmental  sensitivity,  Astra \nhas  evolved  from  utilizing  environment,  health,  and  safety  committees  in  the  1970s  to  end-of-\npipe  approaches  in  the  1980s,  to  self-monitoring  and  the  four  Cs  (commitment,  compliance, \ncompetence,  and  cleaner  production)  in  the  1990s,  to  its  current  philosophy  of  Astra  green \ncompany with four pillars: green strategy, green process, green product, and green employees. \nAstra\u2019s  corporate  philosophy  of  the  green  company  is  one  in  which  management  consciously \nemphasizes  protection  and  development  of  stakeholders\u2019  environment,  health,  and  safety  into \nevery  business  decision,  which  represents  a  continuing  effort  to  contribute  positively  to  the \ncommunity and sustainable development. The green company concept has been introduced in \nall  Astra-affiliated  companies  (e.g.,  automotive,  heavy  equipment,  mining,  plantations).  Astra \nhas  also  adopted  the  triple  bottom  line36 for  sustainable  business.  Examples  of  good  practice \nhave been (i) in the automotive industry: sand reuse for shell molding, recycling of wastewater \nand  materials  (cotton  gloves,  metal  wastes,  etc.),  and  utilization  of  ash  for  brick  manufacture; \nand (ii) in plantations: reduction of pesticides by using biopredators; and training in principles of \nrefine,  reduce,  reuse,  recycle,  recover,  and  retrieve-to-energy.  Currently,  Astra  has  351 \nenvironment officers, 90 safety officers, and 112 health officers.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Management37  \n\n \nEnvironmental  management  at  PALYJA  follows  the  well-established  practices  of  the \n16. \nmajor  shareholders.  PALYJA  has  set  in  place  all  elements  of  an  acceptable  EMS,  which  is \nessentially carried out through environmental risk auditing, introduced by SUEZ in January 2006 \nas a precursor to its environmental charter.  \n \n17. \nthe  Operations \nDepartment, while health and safety issues are handled by Corporate Affairs. The dissemination \nof summary environmental reports is the responsibility of the Contract and Planning Department, \nwhich  also  administers  the  water  for  all  program.  Social  and  institutional  issues  related  to \ncustomer care and satisfaction, and legal compliance are handled by the Institutional Relations \n\nEnvironmental  aspects  of  PALYJA  operations  are  handled  by \n\n                                                 \n32  Shareholders, investors, and financial institutions.  \n33  Trade unions, employees, and residents. \n34  Consumers, local communities, industrial consumers, and suppliers. \n35  International institutions, governments, academic world, media, associations, and nongovernment organizations. \n36  The triple bottom line (3BL) measures the success of a corporation from financial, social/ethical, and environmental \nperformance  perspectives.  Essentially  coined  by  John  Elkington  in  Elkington,  John.  1997.  Cannibals  with  Forks: \nThe  Triple  Bottom  Line  of  21st  Century  Business.  Oxford.  Capstone  Publisher  Limited.  3BL  has  been  widely \nadopted globally by firms, government agencies, and nongovernment organizations. However, the concept has its \ndetractors,  as  in  Norman,  W.  and  C.  MacDonald.  2003.  Getting  to  the  Bottom  of  Triple  Bottom  Line.

All  departments  are  directly  accountable  to  the  PALYJA \npresident. PALYJA has three environment specialists and four health and safety officers.  \n \n18. \nPALYJA  fully  complies  with  Indonesian  regulations  for  clean  water  standards  (Decree \nNo.  426/MENKES/PER/IX/90)  and  drinking  water  standards  for  microbiological  parameters  for \nthe  production  of  water  (Decree  No.  416/MENKES/PER/IX/90).  Although  discussions  continue \non  PALYJA\u2019s  ability  to  comply  with  the  Regional  Environmental  Management  Agency  DKI \nJakarta  (BPLHD  Daerah  Khusus  Ibukota  Jakarta)  environment  policy  for  sludge  discharge  or \nwaste storage, the company will comply with the new regulations on drinking water standards to \nbe enforced in Indonesia in 2008. \n \n\n3. \n\nEnvironmental Reporting    \n\n \n19. \nEnvironmental  monitoring  activities  in  PALYJA  are  located  primarily  in  the  Production \nand Distribution Division of the Operations Department. The quality assurance and environment \nmanager,  who  oversees  the  work  of  three  engineers,  is  responsible  for  preparing  detailed \nreports, which are then submitted to the environment officer for dissemination. Together with 6-\nmonthly reports, an annual environment and operations performance report is submitted to both \nSUEZ and the Indonesian Ministry of Environment as part of the structured reporting system at \nPALYJA. \n \n20. \n \n\nEnvironmental highlights of 2006 included the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\nto  aluminum  chlorohydrate  (ACH) \n\nReplacement  of  coagulant  used  in  the  water  treatment  process  from  aluminum \nsulfate  (AL2SO4) \nto  minimize  sludge \nconcentration. The trials indicate that (a) a reduced coagulant dosage with ACH \nup to + 90%; and (b) the pH value of treated water was more stable; the sludge \nvolume reduced (based on Jar Test). Pejompongan II has used ACH for full plant \nscale  since  January  2006,  with  the  amount  of  lime  reduced  from  2,000\u20133,000 \nkilograms (kg)/day to about 400 kg/day. \nIn April, the Production Engineering Section and Environment Section conducted \na benchmark for Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM)38 Tirta Cisadane Water \nTreatment  Plant  in  Serpong,  Tangerang  to  learn  about  the  reuse  technique  for \nfilter backwash wastewater. \nIn May, monitoring of TCLP, 39 LC50,40 and LD5041 was conducted to ensure that \nthe  water  discharge  from  water  treatment  plants  was  not  categorized  as \nhazardous waste.  \nIn  August  and  September,  the  Quality  Assurance  Group  evaluated  raw  water \nsources for the Cilandak and Taman Kota water treatment plants. \nAn investigation was conducted on inappropriate disposal of flammable waste. \nIn  August,  trials  of  hazardous  waste  transportation  were  conducted  to  prepare \nprocedures for PALYJA. \n\n                                                 \n38  Municipality. \n39  Toxicity  characteristic  leaching  procedure  (TCLP)  is  designed  to  determine  the  mobility  of  both  organic  and \n\ninorganic analyses present in liquid, solid, and multiphasic wastes using USEPA SW-846 Method 113. \n\n40  Lethal concentration fifty (LC50) is an analysis to identify effluents and receiving waters containing toxic materials \n\n41  Lethal  dose  fifty  (LD50)  is  defined  as  the  medium  lethal  dose  of  material  that  is  given  to  test  organisms  and \n\nin acutely toxic concentrations.  \n\nestimated to be lethal to 50% of organisms. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n37 \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nIn  October  and  November,  respectively,  the  Environmental  Charter  and  the \nPALYJA  Minimum  Environmental  and  Community  Requirements  for  Pipelaying \nWorks or Network or Distribution Projects42 were issued. \nIn  May  2006,  the  Review  of  Technical  Operations  and  Environmental  Due \nDiligence for PALYJA was completed by Sinclair Knight Merz was prepared and \nsubmitted to PALYJA. \n\n4. \n\nInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) Certification   \n\n \n21. \nPALYJA is working toward ISO 18000 OSHAS certification at the plants. It has already \nobtained  ISO  17025  for  the  laboratory  management  system  and  ISO  9001  at  Cilandak;  it \nexpects to have ISO 9001 at Pejompongan I and II by the end of the year 2007 at the earlest.  \nE. \n \n\nWater Treatment Plants \n\n1. \n\nWater Treatment Plants \n\n \nPALYJA  operates  (i)  four  water  production/treatment  plants,  including  Pejompongan  I \n22. \nand II (5.6 m3/s); Cilandak South (0.4 m3/s); and Taman Kota (0.2 m3/s);and (ii) more than 5,000 \nkm of primary, secondary, and tertiary water supply networks. \n \nSixty  percent  of  PALYJA\u2019s  water  supply  is  treated  at  the  Pejompongan  plants  using \n23. \nwater sourced from the West Tarum Canal system, which originates from Jatiluhur reservoir, 70 \nkm southeast of Jakarta. The West Tarum Canal system is operated by Perum Jasa Tirta II, a \nstate-owned  company.  Thirty-four  percent  of  PALYJA\u2019s  water  supply  is  purchased  as  bulk \ntreated  water,  from  Perusahaan  Daerah  Air  Minum  (PDAM)  Tangerang;  the  remaining  6%  is \nfrom  other  water  surface,  which  is  treated  in  the  company\u2019s  water  treatment  plants  for \ndistribution. \n \n\n2. \n\nAssessment of Facilities   \n\n \n24. \nPejompongan I and II, built in 1957 and 1970, respectively, are in good condition, with a \nremaining  life  of  20\u201330  years.  A  2006  study43 pointed  out  that  given  that  reinforced  concrete \nprocess tanks and storage reservoirs are subject to deterioration after many years, studies need \nto be initiated to fully determine their condition. The capacity constraint on Pejompongan I and II \nis the condition of the treated water pipeline. Quality deterioration and quantity reduction of raw \nwater are seen as the biggest risks for PALYJA; hence, continued pressure needs to be put on \nthe  Government,  particularly  the  Jakarta  local  government  and  surrounding  cities,,  to  regulate \nthe  discharge  of  pollutants  into  the  canal  system,  with  the  imposition  of  stiff  penalties  and  an \neffective  enforcement  mechanism.  The  treatment  of  sludge  is  unique  in  PALYJA\u2019s  operations. \nFollowing  earlier  practice,  PALYJA  is  currently  discharging  sludge  from  the  water  treatment \nplants  back  into  the  watercourses,  which  it  recognizes  is  not  consistent  with  global  good \npractice, but it is constrained by the lack of formal national and local government regulations for \ndischarge water from water treatment plants; the current regulations refer only to standards for \nliquid  waste  from  other  industrial  groups. 44  However,  the  sludge  consists  primarily  of  inert \nmaterials and as currently treated, is of no significant threat to the water quality and quantity in \nthe  watercourses.  PALYJA  is  continuing  discussions  with  the  Jakarta  government  to  establish \n                                                 \n42  Necessary  steps  and  guidelines  to  ensure  safety  and  environment-friendly  measures  that  will  minimize \n\nenvironmental problems during construction. \n\n43  Sinclair Knight Merz, Review of Technical Operating and Environmental Due Diligence for PALYJA, May 2006.  \n44  DKI  Jakarta  Governor\u2019s  Decision  No.  582  of  1995  regarding  the  Utilization  and  Standard  Quality  of  Rivers  and \n\nStandard Requirement of Liquid Waste in DKI Jakarta, Appendix V.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nnorms for acceptable sludge discharge, and develop regulations for discharge at the treatment \nplants. PALYJA has adopted the following strategy agreed with the local government. It will \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\ncontinue to implement cleaner production activities that include reducing sludge \nwith  the  use  of  nonhazardous  chemicals, 45  as  conducted  since  2005  in \nPejompongan 2, and which will be implemented in Pejompongan I in 2007;  \nparticipate  regularly  in  the  River  Conservation  Program  coordinated  by  BPLHD \nDKI Jakarta;  \nconduct historical analyses on its water discharge quality, and participate closely \nin  discussions  carried  out  by  BPLHD  DKI  on  proposed  amendments  to  Daerah \nKhusus Ibukota (DKI) Jakarta governor\u2019s Decision No. 582 of 1995; \nadopt  water  discharge  management  in  the  Cilandak  water  treatment  plant  as  a \npilot project using centrifugation equipment; and \nconduct  a  study  on  sludge  utilization  for  recycling  backwash  filters  for  all  water \ntreatment  plants  as  part  of  efforts  to  reduce  the  discharge  volume,  and  to  work \ntoward a comprehensive solution to the sludge problem.    \n\n \n25. \nThe  Mission  visited  Pejompongan  I,  which  it  found  to  be  very  well  managed,  with \nattention to all environmental aspects. The plant was well maintained, with clear management \nprocedures for water treatment, storage, and distribution areas. The concrete storage tanks did \nnot display any visible weakness, although the Mission pointed out that after so many years, a \ndetailed structural study might be in order. Nonetheless, the tanks are cleaned thoroughly every \nyear,  and  were  renovated  in  2002.  Hazardous  materials  (chlorine,  caustic  soda)  are  stored  at \nsecure places, requiring permission and proper apparel for entry; breathing apparatus was sited \nat accessible locations throughout the plant. Testing was done frequently at scheduled monthly \nintervals. Although the water was fully potable at the site, leaks in the distribution pipes could be \nresponsible  for  water  contamination;  hence,  an  active  leak  detection  and  repair  system  is \nmaintained by PALYJA, although pipe laying and rehabilitation is outsourced. The water filters \nare self cleaning every 72 hours. SCADA46 is used to detect variations in pressure across zones, \nthereby identifying potential leaks. Noise was within acceptable levels (World Bank standards) \nat  the  pumps.  The  use  of  higher  amount  of  chlorine  at  1  mg/liter  is  justified  due  to  the  long \ndistances covered by the distribution pipes. The Mission noted the presence of waste materials \n(transformers,  sheeting,  construction  materials),  but  was  assured  that  storage  was  temporary, \npending  collection  by  a  private  contractor  to  an  approved  site.  However,  the  Mission  drew \nattention to the importance of proper disposal of transformer oil, which was mentioned as being \nfree of polychlorinated biphenyl.  \n \nF. \n\nConstruction Practices \n \n26. \nRecognizing  the  importance  of  working  with  communities  in  project  development  and \nimplementation, PALYJA has confirmed its responsibilities to the Ministry of Public Works in the \n47 \nEnvironmental  Assessment,  Management  and  Monitoring  Statutory  Obligations.\nEnvironmental  and  social  requirements/responsibilities  that  the  contractors  must  comply  with \nduring construction, particularly pipe-laying works and/or network or distribution projects, are set \nout in Minimum Environmental and Community Requirements.48 \n                                                 \n45  The pH stable aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH), which is finding much greater use in potable water treatment plants \nis  being  used  to  replace  aluminum  sulfate.  ACH  is  expensive,  but  can  be  used  in  lower  does  than  alum,  and  is \nmore effective in reducing sludge concentration.  \n\n46  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, a system that collects and centralizes data from various sensors.  \n47 PALYJA. 2006.

The  first  site  was  on  a  major  thoroughfare, \ninvolving  repair  of  a  major  leak. 49 The  area  was  well  marked,  traffic  regulated,  and  works \n\n                                                 \n49  Helium is being used as a tracer in the water supply to identify the location of invisible leaks, which do not reach \nthe surface and are particularly difficult to find in the Jakarta network owing to many kinds of pipe materials, low \npressure, traffic conditions, etc.). In 2006, 828 leaks were detected along 1,103 km. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nConclusion \n\nscheduled to be completed in as little time as possible (3 days). Local residents and businesses \nhad been informed prior to commencement of repairs.  \n \n30. \nThe  second  site  involved  pipe  laying  in  a  densely  populated  low-income  area,  Kema \nPrasath.  The  alternative  to  piped  water  had  either  been  borewells  (lower  groundwater  levels \nresulted in the water becoming salty) or tankers that charged high rates for a full load. The water \nprovided  in  those  circumstances  was  not  free  of  contamination.  The  residents  (women)  with \nwhom  the  Mission  spoke  were  enthusiastic  about  the  availability  of  clean  water,  and  fully \nagreeable  to  the  charges  that  PALYJA  would  impose  for  connections  and  usage.  The \ncontractors  were  obliged  to  complete  works  quickly  to  avoid  prolonged  inconvenience;  in  the \narea visited, the time taken for trench cut, excavation, sand fill, pipe laying, and earth cover was \nabout 4 hours for every 100 m. The workers at the site were properly equipped, particularly with \nmasks and earplugs for those operating jackhammers.  \n \nG. \n \nReview  and  evaluation  of  the  available  documents/information  and  the  conduct  of  the \n31. \nsite visit demonstrate that PALYJA\u2019s current operations have fully taken into consideration the \nenvironment, health, and safety aspects required by ADB within an EMS framework relevant to \nthe water supply sector. Materials and documents, such as Employee Safety Handbook, Health \nand  Safety  at  Work  (SUEZ),  Minimum  Environmental  and  Community  Requirements  for \nPALYJA,  and  Project  and  Environmental  Management  and  Monitoring  Plans  serve  as \nguidelines and procedures that promote staff and contractor awareness of good environmental, \nhealth, and safety management practices. Adequate staff and financial resources are in place, \nwith  commitment  by  PALYJA  to  increase  the  effectiveness  of  its  environment  management, \nmonitoring,  and  reporting  systems.  The  ADB  mission  is  satisfied  that  the  framework  of  an \neffective  EMS  exists  and  is  capable  of  producing  the  ADB-required  annual  environmental  and \nsocial performance report to acceptable standards under the guidance of the quality assurance \nand environment manager. However, ADB has recommended to PALYJA that it formalize and \ninstitutionalize the EMS according to the structure suggested in this appendix.  \n\n \n\n\fFigure A5.1: PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya: Environmental Responsibilities \n\n \n\n \n\nPresident Director \n \nVice President/ \nDirector \n\nInternal \nAuditor \nProcesses \n\nPublic \nRelations \nManager \n\nCustomer \nService \nManager \n\nCorporate \nAffairs  \nDirector \n\nContract and  \nPlanning \nManager \n\nOperations \nDirector \n\n \n\nTechnical \nServices \nDirector \n\nFinance \nDirector \n \n\nInstitutional \nRelations and \nIllegal Connections\n\nManagement \nInformation \nSystem \nManager \n\nPeople \nDevelopment \n Manager \n\nBusiness \nImprovement \nManager \n\nProduction and \nDistribution  \nManager \n\nInstitutional \nRelations  \nManager \n\nWater for All \nManager \n\nQuality Assurance \nand Environment \nManager \n\nHuman \nResources  \nManager \n\nHealth and \nSafety \nManager \n\n4\n1\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n5\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nH. \n\nFramework for the Establishment of an Environmental Management System for PT \nPAM Lyonnaise Jaya \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n1. \nAs the concessionaire for water distribution in Western Jakarta, PALYJA is committed to \nensure  that  its  operations  will  not  create  adverse  environmental  and  social  impacts.  In  this \nregard,  PALYJA  will  establish  and  effectively  operate  an  appropriate  EMS.  PALYJA  has \ncommitted  to  developing  a  structured  and  detailed  EMS  based  on  the  following  framework, \nwhich comprises the following elements: an overall policy objective for PALYJA, environmental \nassessment  processes  and  procedures  consistent  with  good  practices  in  the  water  supply \nsector,  formal  organizational  capacity,  training  opportunities,  and  monitoring  and  reporting \nmechanisms.    \n \n2. \nThe  framework  is  based  on  an  understanding  of  (i)  the  extent  PALYJA  can  manage \nenvironmental  and  social  aspects  of  its  business;  and  (ii)  environmental  and  social  impacts  of \nwater distribution.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Policy Framework \n\n \nPALYJA  will  formulate  an  explicit  corporate  policy  for  the  environmental  and  social \n3. \nmanagement of its business. The EMS is a tool to ensure that the corporate environmental and \nsocial policy will be efficiently and effectively implemented by all its business units. This section \nproposes  a  policy  statement  and  guiding  principles  for  implementing  the  policy  as  part  of  the \nnormal conduct of the business.  \n \n\na. \n\nPolicy Statement \n\nThe environment policy adopted by PALYJA should \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nbe relevant to activities; \ncomply with relevant environmental legislation and standards; \ncommit to the prevention of pollution; \ncommit to continual improvement; \ncommit to setting environmental objectives and targets; \nbe known to employees and public; and \nadopt,  wherever  and  whenever  possible,  clean \nconstruction, and operation of water treatment and distribution facilities \n\ntechnologies \n\nin  design, \n\nGuiding Principles for Policy Implementation \n\nThe  following  guiding  principles  are  suggested  for  implementation  of  PALYJA\u2019s \n\n \n\nb. \n\n \n \n \n6. \nenvironmental and social policy: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPALYJA  will  avoid  any  construction  on  intensively  inhabited  land  or  on \necologically  or  socially  sensitive  areas.  Examples  of  such  sensitive  areas  are \ncultural sites and swamp forests. \nPALYJA will ensure that the land, if any, provided by the local government have \nno  pending  issues  with  the  former  occupants  related  to  compensation  and \nresettlement assistance. \n\n \n4. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n43 \n\nPALYJA  will  review  the  project  environmental  impact  assessment  and  the \nrecommended  environmental  management  system  (EMS)  to  identify  gaps  or \ninadequacies  that  could  undermine  environmental  and  social  integrity  of  the \nproject.  If  such  inadequacies  are  found,  PALYJA  will  initiate  dialogue  with \nrelevant agencies on measures to improve the environmental impact assessment \nand EMS. \nPALYJA  will  review  the  detailed  designs  and  specifications  prepared  by  the \nengaged design institutes or firms to ensure that they are environmentally sound \nand fully comply with the EMS. \nPALYJA will include in the construction contracts appropriate environmental and \nsocial management clauses related to the EMS, and ensure that the contractors \nfully  comply  with  the  environmental  and  social  management  clauses  and \napplicable rules and regulations of the national and local governments.  \nPALYJA  will  fully  comply  with  the  monitoring  and  reporting  requirements  during \nconstruction as prescribed in the EMS and in compliance with applicable national \nand local laws and regulations. \nPALYJA  will  fully  comply  with  monitoring  and  reporting  requirements  during  the \noperation  of  project  facilities  as  prescribed  in  the  EMS  in  compliance  with \napplicable national and local laws and regulations. \n\n(viii)  PALYJA will report on its environmental and social management activities as set \n\nout in the EMS and as part of its annual reports. \nPALYJA  will  implement  an  appropriate  public  information  program  related  to  its \nenvironmental and social management activities. \nPALYJA  will  continue  to  be  an  active  partner  of  the  communities  in  which  it \noperates. \n\nEMS Design Framework \n\na. \n\nEMS Elements and Activities \n\n \n7. \nThe  EMS  elements  will  be  in  line  with  the  four  main  tasks  of  management:  Plan,  Do, \nCheck,  Act.  These  elements  involve  different  activities  during  construction  and  operation  of  a \nproject.  \n \n\nb. \n\nWork Processes and Procedures \n\nIn setting up the EMS, PALYJA should establish clear work processes and procedures \n\n \n8. \nor guidelines for all tasks, including   \n \n\nreview  of  environmental  impact  assessment,  EMS,  and  detailed  designs \nprepared  by  the  engaged  design  institutes  or  firms  and  approved  by  the  local \ngovernments as necessary; \nchanges or modifications of the EMS and detailed designs; \nreview  of  the  environmental  and  social  management  plan  of  the  contractors\u2019 \nproposals; \npreparation and incorporation of environmental and social management clauses \nin the construction contracts; \naudit  of  environmental  and  social  management  compliance  during \nconstruction  and  operation  of \nnoncompliance and partial compliance; and \nreporting of corporate environmental and social performance. \n\nthe \ntreatment  plants,  and  rectification  of \n\nthe \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n3. \n \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nc. \n\nOrganization \n\nPALYJA  should  have  one  designated  manager \n\n \n9. \nfor  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  to  operate  the  EMS,  supported  by  professional  assistants  as  required.  The \nmanager should report directly to the president director. Environmental and social management \nactivities should be carried out as part of routine plant operations. The results of environmental \nand social management should be reviewed, evaluated, and reported separately from those of \nthe  normal  treatment  plant  operations.  Regular  training  opportunities  should  be  developed  for \nPALYJA  technical,  environment,  and  social  management  staff  to  inform  them  of  required \nenvironment  and  social  management-related  procedures,  recent  developments,  and  good \npractices in the industry to mitigate the environmental impact of PALYJA operations.  \n \n\nd. \n\nBudgeting \n\n \n10. \nExpenses incurred in environmental and social management at the plant level should be \nincluded in the budget for operation of the treatment plants. Expenses incurred in environmental \nand  social  management  at  the  corporate  level,  including  training,  will  be  part  of  the  corporate \noverhead expenses.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n45 \n\nLAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\n \nA. \n\nObjectives \n\n1. \nThe resettlement framework defines the policies, procedures, roles, and responsibilities \nof  PT  PAM  Lyonnaise  Jaya  (PALYJA)  for  screening  and  managing  involuntary  resettlement. \nPALYJA  prepared  the  framework  as  part  of  its  commitment  to  complying  with  the  safeguard \npolicies of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), in particular the Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995). \n \nB. \n\nScope of Involuntary Resettlement in PALYJA Operations \n\n2. \nPALYJA  is  a  subsidiary  of  SUEZ  Environment  (SUEZ)  of  France  and  is  one  of  the \nlargest  water  service  providers  in  Indonesia.  PALYJA  entered  into  a  25-year  cooperation \nagreement with the Government commencing on 1 February 1998. The scope of services under \nthe  agreement  includes  the  design,  construction,  refurbishment,  and  operation  of  the  water \nsupply  system,  technical  and  quality  control,  human  resources  and  training,  financing  of  new \nworks,  and  billing  and  collection.  Most  of  the  activities  involve  upgrading  or  operating  long-\nestablished facilities. These activities will not have involuntary resettlement impacts. \n \n\n1. \n\nTemporary Disturbance and Mitigation Measures  \n\n \n3. \nTemporary  disturbances  are  caused  by  the  construction  of  distribution  pipelines,  for \nwhich  PALYJA  has  established  separate  procedures,  including  (i)  minimizing  community \ndisruption,  (ii)  assessing  relevant  utility  impact,  (iii)  cleaning  after  construction,  (iv)  controlling \ndrainage and sediment on-site, (v) maintaining traffic, and (vi) controlling noise. \n \n4. \nFor  consultation,  disclosure,  and  grievances,  PALYJA  manages  its  territory  through \nthree service units. Each unit (south, west, and central) has a dedicated public relations team to \nundertake  community  meetings/socialization  of  PALYJA  projects.  About  2  weeks  before  the \nproject  starts,  the  team  and  the  contractor  contact  the  head  of  RT&RW,  the  lowest \nadministrative unit in the city, to conduct meetings regarding new projects, network rehabilitation, \nor tariff adjustment. \n \n5. \nDuring the meeting, PALYJA presents information about the project such as time frame, \nobjective,  location,  and  responsibility  for  project  implementation,  including  the  names  of  the \ncontractor and related units in PALYJA. For complaints when the work is being undertaken, the \ncommunity  may  contact  either  the  contractor  or  related  units  in  PALYJA.  As  most  of  the \npopulation  within  the  community  will  benefit  from  the  new  water  pipelines  by  becoming \ncustomers, they may contact the PALYJA call center after they have connected to the pipelines. \nThe  call  center  provides  24-hour  service,  records  all  complaints,  and  then  dispatches  them  to \nrelated  units  through  an  online  system.  After  the  complaint  is  resolved,  the  related  unit  will \nprovide feedback to the call center. \n \n\n2. \n\nDesign and Right-of-Way Agreements \n\n \n6. \nIn  the  rare  instances  where  the  pipeline  has  to  go  through  private  or  commercial  land, \nthe  PALYJA  process  includes  the  following:  (i)  Prepare  a  draft  design  of  the  pipeline  to  be \ndiscussed  with  the  landowner.  (ii)  When  the  landowner  permits  PALYJA  to  pass  through  the \nland, PALYJA prepares cost estimates for the compensation fee based on the agreement with \nthe  landowner.  The  landowner  can  negotiate  the  fee  structure  until  both  parties  are  satisfied \nwith the result. Commercial land usually has its own regulation for land rental, and PALYJA will \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nfollow  that  regulation  as  long  as  it  is  reasonable  and  does  not  conflict  with  PALYJA\u2019s  own \nregulation. Upon reaching an agreement, PALYJA will prepare a contract for the duration of the \nconcession. (iii) If the landowner will not permit PALYJA to pass through the land, PALYJA will \nseek alternative routes based on considerations for general site condition and hydraulic aspects. \n \n7. \nPALYJA  will  not,  to  the  best  of  its  ability,  be  involved  directly  in  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement  in  its  future  operations.  However,  this  resettlement  framework  will  set  out  the \nprocedures,  roles,  and  responsibilities  for  ensuring  that  PALYJA  fully  complies  with  ADB\u2019s \ninvoluntary  resettlement  safeguard  requirements  in  the  unlikely  event  that  involuntary \nresettlement or land acquisition takes place. \n \n \n\nDefinitions \n\n3. \n\nFor the purpose of this framework, the following definitions will apply: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement  refers  to  social  and  economic  impacts  that  are \npermanent or temporary and are caused by (a) acquisition of land and other fixed \nassets,  (b)  change  in  the  use  of  land,  or  (c)  restrictions  imposed  on  land  as  a \nresult of a PALYJA-funded investment.  \n\nAffected  person  includes  any  people,  households,  firms,  or  private  institutions \nwho,  on  account  of  changes  that  result  from  the  project  will  have  their  (a) \nstandard of living adversely affected; (b) right, title, or interest in any house, land \n(including residential, commercial, agricultural, forest, and/or grazing land), water \nresources, or any other moveable or fixed assets acquired, possessed, restricted, \nor  otherwise  adversely  affected,  in  full  or  in  part,  permanently  or  temporarily; \nand/or (c) business, occupation, place of work or residence, or habitat adversely \naffected, with or without displacement.  \n\n4. \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n9. \naccordance with the following: \n \n\nPALYJA  will  ensure  that  any  involuntary  resettlement  activities  are  conducted  in \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995); and \napplicable national and provincial laws and regulations governing land acquisition, \ncompensation and resettlement, and consultation and disclosure of resettlement \ninformation. \n\nThe objectives for managing involuntary resettlement impacts are to \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\navoid involuntary resettlement wherever feasible,  \nminimize resettlement where population displacement is unavoidable, and \nensure  that  affected  persons  receive  assistance  so  that  they  will  be  at  least  as \nwell off as they would have been in the absence of the project.  \n\nResettlement  plans  will  pay  particular  attention  to  addressing  the  needs  of  the  poorest \n\n \n11. \naffected people and vulnerable groups that may be at high risk of impoverishment. \n \n12. \nPresidential  decree  (Keppres)  No.  55/19932  on  Land  Acquisition  specifies  grievance \nprocedures  for  landowners;  defines  \"public  interest\"  for  development  purposes;  separates \n\n8. \n \n\n \n\n \n10. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n47 \n\nprivate  projects  that  should  use  regular  land  purchase  arrangements;  places  increased \nemphasis  on  community  consultation  and  reaching  agreement  with  people  affected  regarding \nthe  form  and  amount  of  compensation;  and  presents  options  for  compensation  including \nsubstitute land, resettlement, and cash. The Regulation of the State Minister of Agrarian Affairs \nand  National  Land  Agency  No.  1  of  1994  specifies  that  each  provincial  governor  should \nestablish  a  land  acquisition  committee  (Panitia  Pengadaan  Tanah)  in  each  kabupaten \n(regency/district)  and  kota  (municipality)  to  be  chaired  by  the  bupati  or  walikota,  and \ncompensate  people  using  land  without  any  title  (Art.  20).  The  land  acquisition  committee \nincludes  representatives  of  the  level  II  land  office,  tax  office,  public  works  agency,  agriculture \nagency,  heads  of  the  subdistrict  and  villages  where  land  acquisition  will  take  place,  and  two \nadditional  members.  Compensation  is  provided  at  the  same  replacement  rates  to  all  people \naffected including holders of hak adapt or ulayat (customary rights), and to long-term squatters \non government land. Table A6.1 provides a comparison of ADB and Indonesian regulations.   \n \n\n5. \n\nScreening for Involuntary Resettlement Impacts \n\n \n\n \n\na. \n\nb. \n\nActivities with No Involuntary Resettlement Impact \n\nActivities with Historical Involuntary Resettlement Impacts \n\nFor any planned investment activities, PALYJA\u2019s senior officer (para. 19) responsible for \n13. \nsocial and resettlement performance will determine and seek consent from ADB on whether any \nactivities  to  be  undertaken  (i)  have  historically  involved  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement; or (ii) may involve future involuntary resettlement.  \n \n \n \n14.  Where  no  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  indicated,  no  action  with  regard  to  this \nresettlement framework will be required. \n \n \n \nIn case of land acquisition or involuntary resettlement50 prior to PALYJA\u2019s involvement, \n15. \nPALYJA\u2019s  senior  officer  responsible  for  social  and  resettlement  performance  will  ensure  a \nresettlement due diligence report is prepared. The report should provide (i) a brief history of site \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  parties  responsible  for  implementation;  (ii)  details  of \naffected land, population, and assets; (iii) assessment of outcomes with respect to restoration of \nstandards  of  living  and  livelihood;  and  (iv)  information  on  any  outstanding  resettlement \ngrievances or related areas of reputation risk. It should state if a resettlement plan is required to \ndefine actions to achieve compliance with ADB\u2019s resettlement requirements. \n \n \n \n16. \nofficer responsible for social and resettlement performance will \n \n\nIn  the  event  that  any  activities  may  involve  involuntary  resettlement,  PALYJA\u2019s  senior \n\nActivities with Planned Involuntary Resettlement \n\nc. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nassess  the  magnitude  of  resettlement,  and  in  consultation  with  ADB,  determine \nwhether a short or full resettlement plan is required; \nreview relevant ADB policies and guidelines; \nensure that resettlement information is disclosed to those affected in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements;  \nsubmit the draft resettlement plan to ADB for review and approval; \n\n                                                 \n50  Historical  impacts  for  which  resettlement  due  diligence  will  be  required  will  be  limited  to  projects  for  which  land \n\nacquisition or relocation of people (whichever occurred most recently) occurred less than 3 years ago. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(v) \n(vi)  \n(vii) \n\noversee any revisions required by ADB to finalize the resettlement plan; \nverify local disclosure of the final resettlement plan; \n submit  the  final  resettlement  plan  for  website  disclosure  and  ADB  Board \napproval; \nconfirm ADB Board approval before proceeding with the investment \n\n(viii) \n(ix)  monitor implementation of the resettlement plan; and \n(x) \n\nprepare  and  circulate  monitoring  reports  as  required  under  the  approved \nresettlement plan. \n\n \n\nd. \n\nResettlement Plans \n\n \n17.  Where necessary, PALYJA will prepare a short or full resettlement plan, depending on \nthe  magnitude  and  complexity  of  resettlement.  A  full  resettlement  plan  will  be  required  when \ninvoluntary  resettlement  is  \u201csignificant,\u201d  i.e.,  when  200  or  more  people  will  experience  major \nimpacts.  This  is  defined  as  (i)  being  physically  displaced  from  housing,  or  (ii)  losing  10%  or \nmore  of  productive  assets  (income  generating).  The  terms  of  reference  for  drafting  the \nresettlement plan are presented in paras. 22\u201341. \n \n18. \nTable A6.2. \n \n\nAn entitlement matrix summarizing the compensation and entitlement policy is shown in \n\n4. \n\nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievance Redress \n\n19. \nEach  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in  close  consultation  with \nthose affected, and involve surveys and community meetings. Plans in the Bahasa language will \nbe  made  available to  the  public  through  postings  in  public  places  for  reasonable  periods  of  at \nleast  4  months  prior  to  actual  land  acquisition.  ADB  will  review  and  approve  the  resettlement \nplans as they are prepared, and once finalized will disclose them on its website. Complaints and \ngrievance procedures acceptable to ADB will be established in each resettlement plan.  \n \n\n5. \n\nReporting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\nPALYJA  will  nominate  an  experienced  senior  officer  to  be  responsible  for  social  and \n20. \nresettlement  performance.

PT  PAM  Lyonnaise  Jaya  (PALYJA)  has  a  25-year \nconcession  to  produce  and  supply  clean  water  in  West  Jakarta  until  2022.  The  economic \nanalysis  examines  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project,  following  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  guidelines:  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  and  Handbook  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. The analysis draws on information obtained from \ngovernment agencies, the project developer, the water supply master plan, and other available \nsecondary data.  \n \nB. \n\nProject Rationale and Description \n\n2. \nIn  Indonesia  only  about  40  million  people,  or  18%  of  the  population,  are  connected  to \npiped  water  supply.  In  urban  areas,  only  39%  of  the  population  receives  piped  water.  The \nremaining urban population depends on individual wells, small-scale providers, or water vendors, \noften at high cost.51 Due to lack of enforcement of regulation on water discharges, groundwater \nquality  has  deteriorated  over  time.  Piped  water  supply  provided  by  utilities  is  clean  and \nsustainable, as water quality is maintained through treatment prior to distribution and constant \nmonitoring. The operations and quality control in such utilities are easier to regulate than that of \nsupply from ground wells and water vendors in the informal sector.  \n \n3. \nalternatives:  \n \n\nAccess  to  water  supply  in  Jakarta  (8.5  million  inhabitants)  is  ensured  through  three \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n55% piped water\u20144.7 million people \n30% shallow and deep wells\u20142.5 million people  \n15% water vendors\u20141.3 million people  \n\n \n\n4. \nHowever,  overexploitation  of  the  aquifer  through  groundwater  extraction  is  resulting  in \nsubsidence.  In  addition  to  increasing  salt  water  intrusion,  chemical  and  microbiological \npollutants  make  the  groundwater  unfit  for  human  use  and  consumption.  Research  undertaken \nby  the  Ministry  of  Environment  indicates  that  65%  of  groundwater  in  Jakarta  is  unsuitable  for \nhuman  use  because  of  negative  health  impacts  (for  example,  contaminated  and  untreated \ngroundwater  leads  to  several  waterborne  diseases  such  as  diarrhea,  typhus,  cholera,  and \nhepatitis  A;  and  contamination  from  chemical  substances,  such  as  insecticide,  can  lead  to \ncarcinogenic  ailments.  As  a  result,  clean  water  has  to  be  bought  from  informal  water  street \nvendors at prices that are several times the cost of piped water supply.52 \n \n5. \nThe  land  subsidence  is also  making  the  area  prone  to  floods.  Unfortunately,  the  flood-\nprone area is inhabited by low-income households. The Jakarta Mining Department will control \nfurther exploitation of groundwater in order to abate aggravated land subsidence. Groundwater \nis not therefore, an economically viable water supply option. The other alternative of purchasing \nwater  from  vendors  is  a  very  expensive.  Therefore,  extension  and  improvement  of  the  piped \nwater distribution network is the least cost option for Jakarta. \n \n                                                 \n51  In rural areas, only about 15% of households receive drinking water from pipe or pump sources. \n52  A 20 liter can of  water costs Rp500,  which is equivalent to Rp25,000/cubic meter. Piped  water tariffs range from \n\nRp1,050/cubic meter (low-income households) to Rp9,693/cubic meter (small commercial establishments). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n \n\n   \n\nIn  1997  when  PALYJA  obtained  the  concession  for  West  Jakarta,  water  supply \n6. \ninfrastructure  was  characterized  by  old  and  rusted  pipes,  bad  connections,  damaged  valves, \nand decreased water pressure. The service coverage ratio was 32% and unaccounted for water \nwas around 57%, due to illegal connections, physical losses, and meter tampering. In 2006, the \nservice ratio increased to 55%. Water losses were reduced by 15% to 42% in 2003. However, \ndue  to  lack  of  adequate  investments,  losses  increased  to  47.6%  (23.8%  physical  losses,  and \n23.8%  commercial  losses)  in  2006.  Additional  investments  are  required  to  reduce  losses  and \nincrease the coverage ratio. The Project will invest in PALYJA\u2019s concession area to upgrade the \nproduction facilities; reinforce, rehabilitate, and extend the existing distribution network; reduce \nwater losses; and rehabilitate existing connections and implement new ones. The investments \nundertaken during 2008\u20132012 will add 66,000 new customers and reduce water losses to 31% \n(19% physical losses and 12% commercial losses). \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n1. \n\nDemand for Water \n\n7. \nOn average, a customer demands 30 cubic meters of water per month when connected \nto  the  water  network.  With  limited  water  available  from  the  network,  demand  is  restricted  to  a \nfraction  (estimated  to  be  about  10%\u201320%)  of  this,  due  to  the  very  high  cost  of  alternative \nsources, especially for low-income households. PALYJA projects that with the envisaged project \ninvestments,  the  number  of  customers  will  reach  452,230  by  2012,  an  increase  of  66,000 \ncompared  to  2007  figures.  In  developing  future  customers,  PALYJA  is  sensitive  to  providing \nservices  for  low-income  customers,  ensuring  that  low-income  areas  are  given  priority  for \nestablishing  new  distribution  networks  and  connections.  Further,  the  water  tariffs  approved  by \nthe governor of Jakarta are set such that social and low-income customers pay less for water \nthan  high-income  individuals  and  business  entities.  As  a  result,  the  number  of  low-income \ncustomers increased by 480% as compared with the 50% increase of middle- and upper-income \ncustomers  since  the  beginning  of  the  concession.  The  Jakarta  government  adjusts  tariffs  and \ncross-subsidizes various consumer categories to ensure that the average tariff is greater than or \nequal to the water charge paid to PALYJA. \n \n\n2. \n\nSupply of Water \n\n8. \nJakarta\u2019s raw water supply mostly comes from surface water, of which 80% comes from \nthe  Citarum  River,  located  east  of  Jakarta.  The  water  is  managed  through  several  dams, \nincluding the Saguling, Cirata, and Jatiluhur dams. These dams are also used for electric power \ngeneration,  river  flow  management,  irrigation,  tourism,  and  industrial  purposes.  The  water  is \nchanneled  for  distribution  through  the  West  Tarum  Canal.  Another  15%  comes  from  the \nCisadane River, located west of Jakarta, and the remaining 5% from smaller rivers flowing from \nWest  Java  Province  to  the  Jakarta  area,  such  as  the  Ciliwung,  Krukut,  and  Pesanggarahan \nrivers. An increase in the water supply for urban use through the Project is not likely to impact \nother  water  uses  if  proper  measures  are  employed  to  reduce  wastage  and  improve  the \nefficiency  of  the  West  Tarum  Canal.  This  is  being  addressed  by  the  proposed  Integrated \nCitarum Water Resource Management Project from ADB public sector operations. \n \n\n3. \n\nEconomic Benefits and Cost Valuation \n\nIn  the  without-project  scenario,  80%\u201390%  of  the  demand  is  not  met  due  to  supply \n9. \nconstraints  and  the  very  high  price  of  alternatives.  In  the  with-project  scenario,  the  main \nquantifiable  benefits  are  the  increased  supply  of  water  and  reduced  physical  losses  of  water. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n61 \n\nWithout  the  project,  demand  is  constrained  by  the  high  price  of  alternatives.  Most  of  the \nadditional  (new)  water  supply  is  therefore  incremental  and  the  benefits  are  valued  at  the \ncustomers\u2019  willingness  to  pay,  which  is  measured  by  the  water  charge.  The  only  viable \nalternative is vendor supplied water, which is expensive and thus demand is suppressed to only \n10%. Therefore, only 10% of the additional volume of water sold is treated as nonincremental \nand valued at its opportunity cost. Commercial losses are valued at the water charge. \n \n10. \nThe  economic  analysis  uses  economic  prices,  with  financial  prices  adjusted  to  net  out \ntransfer  payments  including  taxes,  duties,  or  subsidies,  and  corrected  for  any  other  market \ndistortions. The following assumptions are used: \n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nThe project analysis is done in constant 2007 prices.  \nThe economic life of the Project is assumed to be until the end of the concession in \n2022. The project investments will be implemented over 5 years from 2008 to 2012. \nNo  residual  values  are  assumed  in  2022,  making  the  analysis  a  conservative \nestimation of net benefits. \nThe capital and operation and maintenance costs were apportioned into traded and \nnontraded components.  \nUsing the domestic price numeraire, financial prices as reduced by duties and taxes \nwere converted to economic prices by a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1 for the \ntraded cost component and 1.0 for the nontraded cost component.  \nA conversion factor of 0.95 is used for the cost of unskilled labor to reflect the real \nmarket  value  of  labor,  based  on  the  relationship  between  the  minimum  wage  and \nreported actual rates received by unskilled workers in Jakarta.  \nElectricity  prices  are  not  adjusted  as  electricity  is  supplied  to  the  Project  at \ncommercial rates, which reflect the cost of generation, transmission, and distribution.  \n(vii)  Operation  and  maintenance  costs  are  split  into  fixed  (equipment  and  parts  and \nskilled  labor)  and  variable  (chemicals,  electricity,  bulk/raw  water)  costs.  Table  A8.1 \nsummarizes the economic costs for the Project. \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\n \n11. \nTable  A8.2  provides  details  on  the  increase  in  water  supply  due  to  the  project \ninvestments,  and  the  physical  and  commercial  losses  during  water  supply.  In  the  economic \nanalysis, the commercial losses of water are included in the calculation of the economic rate of \nreturn (EIRR). The EIRR for the base case is 58.5%.  \n \n12. \nThe Project will also result in the following indirect benefits: (i) reduction in the extraction \nof groundwater thereby contributing to the control of further land subsidence; and (ii) reduction \nin the incidence of waterborne diseases, especially among the poor, made possible through the \nsupply of clean water. These benefits have not been valued, but their inclusion will increase the \nProject\u2019s EIRR.  \n \n\n4. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n13. \nAn analysis was undertaken to test the sensitivity of the estimated EIRR of the Project to \nadverse  changes  in  key  variables  and  to  confirm  its  economic  viability  under  unfavorable \nconditions.  For  purposes  of  the  analysis,  three  major  risks  are  considered:  (i)  an  increase  of \n10% in the capital and O&M costs, (ii) a 10% decrease in revenue, and (iii) underachievement \nof  physical  loss  reduction  by  50%  of  that  originally  planned.  A  scenario  was  also  run  with  a \ncombination of all the three risk factors.

The Project is justifiable in economic terms. \n \nD. \n\nDistribution of Project Benefits \n\n15. \nAn  assessment  by  an  independent  regulatory  body  established  in  2001  to  monitor \nimplementation  of  the  concession  agreement  shows  that  in  Jakarta\u2019s  low-income  areas  poor \npeople  are  currently  spending  a  significant  share  of  their  household  budget  to  buy  water  from \ninformal  vendors,  this  price  is  far  greater  that  what  they  would  pay  once  connected  to  the \nnetwork. The Project will directly benefit more than 66,000 households, with a high proportion in \nthe lower income categories. The Project will have a marginal impact on employment generation, \nwhich is limited to workers (skilled and unskilled) employed for the expansion of the distribution \nnetwork.  \n \nProject benefits will accrue to the project developers and all categories of consumers in \n16. \nterms  of  lower  priced  water  supply  that  is  more  reliable  and  cleaner  than  the  alternatives. \nFurther  given  the  tariff  structure  adopted  by  the  Jakarta  government,  the  poor  consumers  are \ncross-subsidized by the higher income category consumers. However, the higher prices paid for \npiped water by the higher income category is lower than those paid for alternative sources. The \nvendors of water will be adversely affected by the Project as they will lose part of their business. \nAs only a few vendors are reaping supernormal rents in the without-project scenario, the gains \nby a multitude of consumers not only in terms of access to less expensive water supply but also \nlower health expenditure and overall well-being exceed the loss for the vendors.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 10 June 2007) \n \n", "Currency Unit\nRp1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "rupiah (Rp) \n$0.00011 \nRp9,103 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "ADB \nEBITDA \nEIRR \nEMS \nMDG \nNGO \nPALYJA \nPAM Jaya \nPDAM \nSUEZ \nTA \n", "earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management system \n", "\u2013  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  Millenium Development Goal \n\u2013 \nnongovernment organization \n\u2013  PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya \n\u2013  Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya \n\u2013  Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (public water utility) \n\u2013  SUEZ Group of France \ntechnical assistance \n\u2013 \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "km \nm \nm3 \nm3/s \n", "kilometer \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013  meter \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "cubic meter \ncubic meters per second \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) ends on 31 December.
