The loan is funded through \na local currency bond issued by ADB for this financing. \n   \nBorrower Description  PALYJA is a subsidiary company of SUEZ Environment, part of \nthe SUEZ Group (SUEZ) of France, and is one of the largest \nwater service providers in Indonesia. Following an equity sale by \nSUEZ Environment in July 2006, PALYJA is 51% owned by SUEZ \nEnvironment,  30%  by  the  Indonesian  group  PT  Astratel \nNusantara,  and  19%  by  Citigroup  Financial  Products \nIncorporated. \n \nIn  June  1997,  PALYJA  entered  into  a  25-year  concession \nagreement  with  Perusahaan  Daerah  Air  Minum  Jakarta  Raya \n(PAM  Jaya),  under  which  PALYJA  took  responsibility  for  the \nproduction and distribution of clean water in West Jakarta. The \nagreement  became  effective  on  1  February  1998.  Under  the \nagreement, PALYJA is responsible for the design, construction, \nrefurbishment,  and  operation  of  the  water  supply  system; \ntechnical  and  quality  control;  human  resources  and  training; \nfinancing  of  new  works;  and  billing  and  collection.  PALYJA \noperates (i) three water treatment plants: Pejompongan I and II , \nCilandak South, and Taman Kota North; and (ii) more than 5,000 ", "iv \nkilometers (km) of primary, secondary, and tertiary water supply \nnetworks. \n \nSince 1998, PALYJA has invested more than Rp1 trillion ($109.8 \nmillion) in the water systems of West Jakarta, mainly to (i) improve \nthe quality of delivery services, (ii) rehabilitate existing distribution \nnetworks, and (iii) expand distribution networks to increase the \nservice coverage area. \n   \nProject Description  The  loan  will  fund  a  portion  of  PALYJA\u2019s  capital  expenditure \nprogram for the third 5-year period of the concession between \n2008 and 2012. The program will focus on improving service to \nexisting  customers  and  extending  service  delivery  to  new \ncustomers  by  (i)  completing  the  production  facility  upgrade \nprogram  begun  in  1998;  (ii)  reinforcing,  rehabilitating,  and \nextending  the  existing  distribution  network;  (iii)  reducing \nunaccounted for water; and (iv) rehabilitating existing connections \nand implementing new connections. \n   \nDevelopment Impact  First, the Project supports the Government\u2019s efforts to meet the \ntarget  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  through \nprovision  of  much-needed  water  supply  infrastructure.  The \nconsistent provision of clean water in West Jakarta will contribute \nto Indonesia\u2019s overall efforts to reach the MDGs by (i) reducing \nthe proportion of people without access to safe drinking water \n(MDG  7),  and  (ii)  improving  the  quality  of  human  resource \ndevelopment and the environment by promoting healthy lifestyles \nand reducing mortality. Second, through assistance to PALYJA in \ndeveloping its capital expenditure program, the Project will help \nthe people of West Jakarta gain access to more consistent and \naffordable water  supply,  especially  for  low-income  households. \nThird,  the  Project  complements  ADB  public  sector  efforts  to \nimprove the legal framework in the water sector as well as policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government  on  overall  water  sector \nmanagement  and  improvement.  For  instance,  the  proposed \nIntegrated Citarum Water Resource Management Project will help \nimprove  the  upstream  raw  water  supply  system.  Fourth,  ADB \ninvolvement  in  PALYJA,  through  its  public-private  partnership \nmodel,  will  allow  it  to  observe  and  raise  issues  with  the \nGovernment on key policy and regulatory challenges. Finally, by \nusing locally raised funds, the Project will have a positive impact \non the development of local capital markets.  \n   \nProject Risks  The main risks associated with the Project are (i) exposure to \npossible  raw  water  supply  interruptions  due  to  inadequate \nmaintenance of the West Tarum Canal, (ii) timely adjustment of \nthe  water  tariff  and  water  charge,  and  (iii)  management  of \nunaccounted  for  water.  These  risks  have  been  or  will  be \nsystematically addressed and mitigated. \n   \nJustification   The  Project  merits  ADB  support  because  it  will  help  the \n ", "  v\nGovernment  achieve  poverty  reduction  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment  objectives.  PALYJA  will  be  in  a  position  to \ncomfortably fund its proposed capital expenditure program, a key \ncomponent to expand water supply coverage in West Jakarta. The \ndelivery  of  services  to  a  broader  customer  base  will  lead  to \nincreased revenue, and reinforce PALYJA\u2019s financial sustainability \nand  continuous  operations  through  the  life  of  the  concession. \nConsidering  a  broader  scope,  development  effectiveness  is \nreflected in the establishment of a well-maintained and efficient \nwater supply system in West Jakarta. \n ", "10 o 00'N 110 o 00'E 130 o 00'E10 o 00'N\nI N DO N E S I A South China Sea\nJ a v a    S e a BRUNEI PACIFIC    OCEAN\nDARUSSALAM\nWEST JAKARTA WATER SUPPLY\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT 0o MALAYSIA HALMAHERA 0o\nSUMATRA KALIMANTAN SULAWESI\nBANGKA-- I N D O N E S I A\nBELITUNG PAPUA\nSERAM\nJAKARTA\nJ a v a     S e a\nMuara Kar1a0n0g  LW/sTePc 10 o 00'S J A V A BALSIUMBAWA FLORES TIMOR-LESTE 10 o 00'S\nSUMBA TIMOR\nI N D I A N     O C E A N\nTaman Kota WTP 110 o 00'E 130 o 00'E\n200 L/sec\nPulogadung WTP\nPejo1m&p2o nWgTaPn Banjir Canal\nDC R4\n1.2 m3/sec\nclosed conduit\n4.4 m3/sec\nDC R5 5.5 mB3u/saercan WTP West Tarum Canal\n1.6 m3/sec Condet WTP\nCilandak WTP 50 L/sec\nSerpong WTP 400 L/sec\n3 m3/sec\nCikarang Weir\nCibeet Weir\nCipinang River Bekasi River\nCisadane River Ciliwung River Sunter River Cikarang River Cibeet River Citarum River\nWest Jakarta Concession Area\nNational Capital\nWater Treatment Plant\n1\nWeir\nJatiluhur Dam\nRiver N KM-10\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\n0\n7 Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n-1\n9\n6\n0\n R\nM", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nIndonesian rupiah-denominated loan, without government guarantee, of up to Rp455 billion to \nPT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (PALYJA) for the West Jakarta Water Supply Development Project. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Background \n \n2.  Indonesia, with its abundant rainfall, has about 6% of the world's fresh water resources. \nHowever the development of Jakarta's water supply network, originally built during the Dutch \noccupation, has not kept pace with the city's rapid growth. As a result, by 1991 only 45%1 of \nJakarta's residents had access to piped water. Numerous incidents were reported of people \nfinding  worms,  sand,  or  even  needles  in  Jakarta's  piped  water;  water  quality  was  barely \nacceptable.  \n \n3.  Currently, 60% of Jakarta\u2019s residents have access to clean water. But to reach the \nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) target of reducing the proportion of people without access \nto safe drinking water and basic sanitation by half by 2015 (MDG 7, Target 10), approximately \nRp66.4 trillion ($7.3 billion) will be needed for water services,2 of which only 25% is expected to \nbe provided by the Government. The remaining investment is targeted to be provided by the \nprivate sector.  \n \n4.  Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya (PAM Jaya), a state-owned enterprise to \nprovide water supply in Jakarta and established in 1977, was responsible for water supply and \nsewerage services in Jakarta until late 1997. Unit production costs and the tariff structure were \nboth high compared with other Asian countries, but at the same time PAM Jaya could not \nsustain an efficient management or investment program to meet the needs of residents. In 1997, \nthe right to operate the city\u2019s water supply system was offered to private enterprises under two \nseparate  concessions,  one  in  West  Jakarta  and  one  in  East  Jakarta.  In  early  1998  after \nnegotiating cooperation agreements with PAM Jaya, PT Thames Pam Jaya was appointed the \noperator for the East Jakarta concession and PALYJA for the West.  \n \n5.  However, within 3 months of signing the cooperation agreement, Indonesia was affected \nby the Asian financial crisis. Economic and political turmoil resulted in PAM Jaya being unable \nto  implement  the  negotiated  tariff  increases.  Thus  PALYJA\u2019s  planned  capital  expenditure \nprogram was never fully implemented. In 2001, a renegotiated cooperation agreement was \nsigned to resolve the issue of tariff adjustment and to create mitigation measures for any future \ntariff freezes. Through this process, two issues became clear to PALYJA: (i) availability of long-\nterm local currency financing is crucial in meeting PALYJA\u2019s investment obligations under the \ncooperation agreement and mitigating foreign exchange risks; and (ii) government support and \nenforcement of water tariffs are essential to ensure the financial sustainability of the concession, \nand the economic sustainability of the water sector.   \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1994.

In March 2007, PALYJA confirmed its \nkeen interest in obtaining a long-term local currency loan facility from ADB to help meet its \ncapital expenditure requirements for the next planning cycle (2008\u20132012). \n \n2.  The Water Sector \n7.  Water resource management is poor and water demand is only about 1.7% of potential \ntotal demand.3 Water quality varies depending on the season, year, and factory discharges. \nDespite  efforts  for  environmental  cleanup,  overall  water  quality  is  worsening.  Flooding  is \ncommon, largely due to human deforestation and poor agricultural practices. In addition, the \nurban population has grown at more than 4% annually over the past 10 years4 compared with \nthe national average population growth rate of 1.7% per annum over the same period. The \ncountry\u2019s urban population is projected to grow from the current 45% of the total population to \n60% in 2015, and will double by 2025. Most public utilities are not equipped to handle such \ndrastic growth in urbanization, in particular the water utilities.  \n \n8.  At present, only about 40 million people, or 18% of the total population, are connected to \npiped water supply.5 Even in urban areas only 39% of residents receive piped water. The \nremaining urban population depends on individual wells, small-scale providers, or water vendors; \noften  at  high  cost.  In  rural  areas,  the  situation  is  much  worse.  Only  about  15%  of  rural \nhouseholds get drinking water from pipe or pump sources, with Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum \n(PDAMs), the public water utilities, accounting for about half of the supply. The majority of rural \nhouseholds still rely on shallow groundwater extraction or rainwater collection, or use surface \nwater from nearby rivers or springs. The poor are affected most by these situations.  \n \n9.  It is estimated that a total investment of Rp66.4 trillion ($7.3 billion) will be needed for \nwater services to achieve the MDG for water supply and sanitation by 20156.  This will require \nan  annual  spending  on  water  services  of  about  Rp5.1  trillion  ($573  million)  (para.  3).  As \ncompared with average government spending of Rp11 trillion each year on infrastructure, which \nincludes roads, bridges, irrigation, water, housing, and others; public expenditure alone will \nobviously not be sufficient to address the water sector needs. \n \n10.  Before  1999,  the  central  Government  financed  all  public  utility  investments  through \ngrants, subsidies, or loans to the regional governments. Upon issuance of Law No. 22 of 1999 \non Regional Governance, authority for all aspects of local infrastructure and service delivery, \nincluding  planning,  providing,  financing,  and  managing  water  supply  and  sanitation,  was \ndevolved from the central Government to district and city governments (kabupaten and kota). \n \n11.  After decentralization, the bulk of financing responsibilities for water supply rested with \nthe PDAMs. However, many PDAMs throughout Indonesia are unable to provide minimum \nservices to consumers and are financially unsustainable due to inadequate tariffs. Further, the \nlack of financial sustainability has resulted in heavy debt obligations incurred by the PDAMs to \nthe central Government amounting to $500 million, on top of other forms of external and \ncommercial debt. A detailed summary of the water sector is attached as Appendix 2.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Under the scenario that water management is better coordinated and supply of water is better channeled. \n4  United Nations. 2004.

Sector Policies and Regulations \n12.  The basis for the legal structure relating to water in Indonesia is found in Article 33 of the \n1945 Constitution, which refers to land, water, and natural resources as \u201ccontrolled by the State \nand utilized for the benefit of the people.\u201d Subsequently, Law 11 of 1974 (Law 11/74) gives the \nGovernment the authority to manage, develop, regulate, and supervise the use of water and \nwater sources. Government regulation 22 of 1982 (GR 22/82) is the implementing regulation of \nLaw 11/74, expanding on the management and planning functions of the Government and \nestablishing the authority of the Ministry of Public Works to coordinate overall management of \nwater and water resources. Regulation GR 22/82 allows the ministry to delegate its authority \nand functions relating to water and water resources to the regional governments. The ability of \nregional governments to set up PDAMs is set out in Law 5/74 and recently again in Law 22/99, \na major directive to support the trend to decentralization to the 36 provinces.  \n \n13.  A national water resources policy action plan was developed in 1994 for PJP II7 to set \nthe medium-term strategy and action items for the water sector, including (i) improvement of \nwater resources development and productivity through increase in efficiency and effectiveness \nof water resources infrastructure; and (ii) increase in the supply of water and the productivity of \nwater  supply  infrastructure  to  meet  the  requirements  of  urban  and  rural  populations. \nSubsequently, the Water Resources Law 7/2004 and Government Regulation 16/2005 on Water \nSupply enhanced the legal framework for water supply by (i) clarifying the terms for private \nsector participation and hence ending public monopolies in the water sector, (ii) eliminating the \nneed for local parliament approval of water tariff increases, and (iii) calling for the establishment \nof the National Water Regulatory Agency NWRA.   \n \nb.  Sector Challenges \n14.  The key issues affecting Indonesia\u2019s water sector are (i) low service coverage with piped \nwater supply, (ii) financially unsustainable water supply services, and (iii) lack of sanitation \nservices. \n \n15.  Low Service Coverage with Piped Water Supply. Lack of access to water has a major \nimpact on economic development, health, and well-being of the population. Many of the PDAMs \nthroughout Indonesia are barely able to provide minimum services to consumers and have \nconnected only about 39% of the urban population to piped water supply. As a result, more than \n70% of the population obtains water from potentially contaminated sources. Unsafe drinking \nwater leads to diarrhea, which is the second leading cause of death of children under 5 years in \nthe country and accounts for about 20% of child deaths each year. \n \n16.  Unsustainable Financing of Water Supply Services. The widespread lack of cost \nrecovery tariffs, compounded by the limited size of PDAMs and low revenue collection, have \nresulted  in  the  reduction  or  abandonment  of  maintenance  and  investment  activities, \ndeteriorating assets, as well as low service coverage and quality. Of the 318 PDAMs, 82% are \nexperiencing losses and 44% are operationally unsustainable. Of these, 119 PDAMs have \nforeign debts, while 146 PDAMs have domestic debt.8  \n \n17.  Lack  of  Sanitation  Services. Poor sanitation services impact negatively on public \nhealth and the well-being of the population. The high incidence of waterborne diseases is a \n                                                 \n7  The Government of Indonesia follows 5-year development plans known as Repelita and 25-year long-term \ndevelopment plans known as PJP.

Every year, at least 300 of 1,000 Indonesians \nsuffer from waterborne disease, including cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever, according to \nthe  Ministry  of  Health.  Formal  sewerage  systems  in  Indonesia  have  been  constructed  in \nselected areas of a few large cities, but most are underutilized and underfunded, and therefore \nunable to realize the planned benefits of these systems. Overall, sewerage coverage is about \n3% of the urban population. The vast majority of citizens still rely on on-site sanitation (e.g., \nseptic tanks and pit latrines), while many low-income families rely on grossly polluted drains and \nurban waterways. \n \nB.  ADB Operations \n1.  Country Strategy \n18.  In developing its Medium-Term Development Plan (2005\u20132009) 9, the Government was \nguided  by  the  objectives  of  increasing  sustainable  economic  growth,  creating  jobs,  and \naccelerating achievement of the MDGs. Under the plan, the Government\u2019s five priority areas are \n(i) job creation and poverty reduction; (ii) macroeconomic stability, fiscal sustainability, and \nfinancial sector reforms; (iii) acceleration of investments, exports, and tourism through reforms \nto provide a healthy business climate and flexible markets; (iv) improved access to and quality \nof education and health; and (v) infrastructure development by improving the efficiency of \nexisting services and increasing private sector participation. To support the Government in \nachieving these goals, ADB\u2019s country strategy (2006\u20132009) reflects these priorities. Accordingly \nADB  plans  to  focus  on  (i)  infrastructure  development,  (ii)  financial  sector  deepening,  (iii) \ndecentralization, (iv) MDG acceleration, and (v) environment and natural resource management. \nThis Project is in line with focus areas (i), (iv), and (v) of the strategy. \n \n2.  Water Sector Strategy \n19.  ADB\u2019s water sector strategy aims to promote (i) national focus on water sector reforms, \n(ii) development of integrated management of water resources, (iii) improvement and expansion \nof water delivery services, (iv) conservation of water and improvement of system efficiencies, (v) \nregional cooperation on water resource sharing, (vi) facilitation of water sector information \nexchange, and (vii) governance enhancements. The Project is in line with (iii) and (iv) of this \nstrategy. \n \n20.  Water resource management is a key element of ADB operations for environment and \nnatural  resource  management  in  Indonesia.  Through  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector \nDevelopment Program10, key regulatory framework was defined for tariff and PDAM reforms.  \nBased on this platform, support will be provided for integrated water resources management, \nincluding investments in infrastructure and management of multipurpose facilities, in the context \nof  river  basins.  Two  projects  are  under  preparation.  First,  the  Integrated  Citarum  Water \nResources Management Project is being developed as a multitranche financing facility for \napproval in 2007. The Citarum project will help implement a strategic road map for development \nand sustainable management of the Citarum River basin, and thus improve water quality and \nsupply to the cities of Jakarta and Bandung and to farmers in West Java. Second, the Flood \nManagement in Selected River Basins Project, being developed as a multitranche financing \nfacility for approval in 2008, will focus on selected river basins and improved capacities in \nCentral  and  West  Java.  The  Citarum  project  will  enhance  overall  effectiveness  of  water \nresource  and  water  supply  management  in  Jakarta,  which  critically  supports  this  Project. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program for Indonesia, 2006\u20132009. Manila. \n10 ADB. 2006. Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program. Manila. \n ", "  5\nParticular importance is placed on developing public and private sector dialogue and ensuring \ncomplementarity  of  the  Project  with  public  sector  operations  and  overall  water  sector \ndevelopment  strategy.  Information  on  the  Project  is  shared  with  the  South  East  Regional \nDepartment, and close coordination will continue throughout development of the Project and \ndevelopment of various public sector initiatives. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Water Financing Program 2006\u2013201011 also prioritizes Indonesia as one of its \nfocal countries for expansion of water services. The program seeks to expand investments in \nthree key areas: rural water services (water supply and sanitation, irrigation, and drainage), \nurban water services (water supply and sanitation, wastewater management, and environmental \nimprovement), and basin water management (integrated water resource management, including \ninvestments  in  infrastructure,  flood  management,  and  water  quality  conservation;  and \nconservation and improvement of watersheds, wetlands, and ecosystems). The Project is in line \nwith  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the  Water  Financing  Program,  particularly  with  regard  to \ninvestment in the urban water service sector. \n \n3.  Private Sector Operations \n22.  ADB\u2019s private sector operations in Indonesia aim to support the Government\u2019s Medium-\nTerm Development Plan for economic growth and MDG acceleration. ADB is committed to \nutilizing its investment and cofinancing products, including equity, debt, and guarantees to assist \nIndonesia in mobilizing private sector investment in infrastructure and the financial sector.  \n \n23.  Private sector operations began in Indonesia in 1985. During 1985\u20131998, ADB approved \n$197.5 million in financial assistance for 16 projects in the general industry and financial sectors. \nSome of these projects, particularly in manufacturing, performed less than satisfactorily primarily \nbecause of sector and partner selection issues. After the financial crisis, ADB did not provide \nnew financial assistance to Indonesia until 2005, when it approved a liquefied natural gas \nproject. In 2006, the ADB Board of Directors approved financial assistance to PT Perusahaan \nGas Negara (Persero) Tbk, a state-owned gas utility. In 2007, the Board approved a loan to PT \nSemen Andalas Indonesia for the Reconstruction of the Cement Production Facility in Aceh. \nADB\u2019s private sector projects in Indonesia are listed in Appendix 3. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  recommends  that  ADB  contribute  to  the \ndevelopment of local financial markets. The ADB paper Introducing the Local Currency Loan \nProduct12 proposes that ADB introduce a local currency loan product that would help reduce \ncurrency mismatches, promote capital market development, and catalyze local financing.  \n   \n25.  ADB\u2019s loan to PALYJA is proposed to be funded through the issue by the proceeds of a \nlocal currency bond, which would be the first local currency bond issued by ADB in Indonesia. If \napproved,  the  Project  would  be  the  first  ADB  local  currency  loan  for  a  private  sector \ninfrastructure project in Indonesia. \n \nIII.  THE BORROWER \nA.  Background \n26.  PALYJA is a subsidiary company of SUEZ Environment, part of the SUEZ Group (SUEZ) \nof France, and is one of the largest water service providers in Indonesia. In June 1997, PALYJA \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2006. Water Financing Program 2006\u20132010. Manila \n12  ADB. 2005. Introducing the Local Currency Loan Product. Manila. \n ", "6   \nentered into a 25-year concession agreement (the cooperation agreement) with PAM Jaya \nunder which PALYJA took responsibility for the production and distribution of clean water in \nWest Jakarta. The agreement became effective on 1 February 1998. The scope of services \nincludes the design, construction, refurbishment, and operation of the water supply system; \ntechnical and quality control; human resources and training; financing of new works; and billing \nand collection. \n \n27.  Since the start of the concession period in 1998, PALYJA has invested more than  \nRp1 trillion ($109.8 million) in the water systems of West Jakarta, mainly to (i) improve the \nquality  of  delivery  services,  (ii)  rehabilitate  existing  distribution  networks,  and  (iii)  expand \ndistribution networks to increase the service coverage area. Significant achievements include (i) \nservice coverage ratio increased from 32% of the population in 1998 to about 55% in 2006; (ii) \nmore than 1,500 kilometers (km) of the water supply network rehabilitated and extended; (iii) \ntotal connections increased from 210,000 in 1998 to 350,000 in 2006; (iv) population served \nincreased by 1.25 million, including low-income customers increased by 124% and middle-\nincome customers by 40%; (v) physical and commercial water losses reduced by 15%; and (vi) \nwater quality compliance dramatically improved. A detailed description of PALYJA is attached \nas Appendix 4. \n \nB.  History of the Concession \n28.  Under the cooperation agreement, PALYJA is responsible for procurement of bulk water, \noperation of the water supply system, and billing and collection of water fees. To ensure the \naffordability of water to customers of all social economic classes, the agreement delinked water \ntariffs charged to customers (water revenue) and the revenues received by PALYJA (water \ncharge). The water revenue would vary depending on the customer category, while PALYJA \nwould receive a flat water charge for every cubic meter of water billed. \n \n29.  Within 3 months of signing the original agreement, Indonesia experienced the economic \nturmoil of the Asian financial crisis. As a result of political pressures arising from the crisis none \nof the increases in retail water tariffs envisioned in the agreement were implemented prior to \n2000. Also, following the overthrow of the Suharto regime in 1998, the legitimacy of the two \nconcessions were challenged. The Indonesian Government under President Habibie temporarily \nreclaimed the concessions under public authority. Control of the West Jakarta concession was \nreturned to PALYJA, but with renegotiated terms and conditions.  \n \n30.  In 2001, PAM Jaya and PALYJA finalized the terms of the renegotiated cooperation \nagreement, which sought to address the issue of the tariff freeze imposed prior to 2000 and \nestablished  a  regulatory  body  for  mediation  and  monitoring.  Pursuant  to  the  renegotiated \nagreement, significant increases in water tariffs were implemented in 2001, 2003, and 2004 to \nbring  water  tariffs  back  in  line  with  local  inflation  indices.  In  2004,  an  amendment  to  the \nagreement  introduced  an  automatic  tariff  adjustment  mechanism  that  has  been  operating \nsatisfactorily since early 2005. \n \nC.  Major Shareholders \n31.  Following a sale of equity by SUEZ Environment in July 2006, PALYJA is 51% owned by \nSUEZ Environment, 30% by the Indonesian group PT Astratel Nusantara, and 19% by Citigroup \nFinancial Products Incorporated. \n \n32.  SUEZ is a France-based group listed on the Brussels, Luxembourg, Paris, New York, \nand Zurich stock exchanges. SUEZ is a provider of electricity, natural gas, energy services, \nwater, and waste management. It has two main lines of business: energy and environment. The \n ", "  7\nenergy business includes the production, sale, and trading of electricity; sale, trading, transport, \nand storage of natural gas; energy services, including on-site management on energy networks, \nand utilities and facilities management; as well as operation, maintenance, and development of \npower and natural gas distribution networks.  \n \n33.  SUEZ Environment is responsible for supplying services, plant, and equipment for (i) \ndrinking water production and distribution, (ii) wastewater collection and treatment, and (iii) \nwaste processing and recycling to industrial and individual customers. SUEZ Environment is \nranked second in environmental services in Europe for water and sanitation. To date, SUEZ \nEnvironment serves more than 400,000 industrial customers and 91 million individuals with \ndrinking water, 49 million individuals with sanitation services, and 64 million individuals with \nwaste services. \n \n34.  PT Astratel Nusantara (Astratel) is a subsidiary company under PT Astra International \n(Astra), an Indonesian conglomerate founded in 1957 and now one of the largest business \ngroups in Indonesia. Astra currently has six core businesses: automotive, financial services, \nheavy equipment, agribusiness, information technology, and infrastructure. Astratel has been \noperating  for  12  years  and  been  involved  in  the  development  of  numerous  infrastructure \nprojects, with a particular focus on telecommunications. Astratel now intends to actively pursue \npotential new infrastructure projects including water supply, toll roads, ports/logistics, marine \nfacilities, and airports. Overall, Astra has adapted corporate governance standards according to \ninternational  best  practice,  and  internal  policies  are  in  place  to  ensure  good  corporate \ngovernance throughout the group and its subsidiaries. It was named the best listed company in \nthe  Jakarta  Stock  Exchange  with  regard  to  corporate  governance,  transparency,  and \naccountability. In April 2007, Astra placed at the top of the Finance Asia13 poll for Indonesia in \nthe following three categories: (i) best managed company in Indonesia; (ii) most committed to \ncorporate governance; and (iii) best investor relations. \n \nD.  Organization Structure \n35.  As  of  March  2007,  PALYJA  has  1,400  employees,  of  which  902  are  employees \nseconded from PAM Jaya at the outset of the concession period. PALYJA is currently in the \nprocess  of  integrating  seconded  employees  to  become  permanent  employees,  with  the \nobjective of enhancing employee equality and providing more flexibility with regard to labor \nmanagement. The organization chart is presented in Figure 1: \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13  Finance Asia. 2007.

Operations \n36.  PALYJA operates (i) four water treatment plants: Pejompongan I and II; Cilandak South; \nand Taman Kota North; and (ii) more than 5,000 km of primary, secondary, and tertiary water \nsupply networks. \n \n37.  Sixty percent of PALYJA\u2019s water supplies are treated in the Pejompongan plants using \nwater sourced from the West Tarum Canal system, which originates from Jatiluhur reservoir,  \n70 km southeast of Jakarta. The West Tarum Canal system is operated by Perum Jasa Tirta I, a \nstate-owned company.  \n ", "  9\n \nIV.  THE PROJECT \n38.  The Project will fund part of PALYJA\u2019s capital expenditure program for the third 5-year \nconcession period: 2008\u20132012.  \n \nA.  Capital Expenditure Program \n(i)  Planned capital expenditure during 2008 to 2012 will focus on improving service \nto existing customers and extending service delivery to new customers by (i) \ncompleting  the  production  facility  upgrade  program  initiated  in  1998;  (ii) \nreinforcing, rehabilitating, and extending the existing distribution network; (iii) \nreducing  unaccounted  for  water  losses;  and  (iv)  rehabilitating  existing \nconnections and implementing new connections.  \n \nB.  Environment, Health, and Safety \n1.  Environmental Safeguards \n39.  The Project is classified as environment category FI. Due diligence was conducted on \nthe  environmental,  safety,  and  health  aspects  of  PALYJA\u2019s  current  operations  to  ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. The environmental and social safeguard assessment \nfor PALYJA is attached as Appendix 7. In addition, PALYJA will ensure that environmental \nmonitoring for all future operations is undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002). Hence, PALYJA will set up or improve environment management systems, including \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures satisfactory to ADB. PALYJA will also ensure \nit complies with Indonesian environment laws and regulations. PALYJA will confirm to ADB \nperiodically  its  compliance  with  ADB  and  Indonesian  environment  requirements  and  make \nreports on these matters available to ADB.  \n \n2.  Land Acquisition, Resettlement, and Indigenous Peoples \n40.  The Project is classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for \nindigenous peoples. Due diligence was conducted on the social aspects of PALYJA\u2019s current \noperations,  covering  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  With  respect  to \nPALYJA\u2019s planned capital expenditure program, land acquisition and resettlement activities are \nminimal. PALYJA has indicated its intention to avoid, if at all possible, land acquisition or other \nactivities that would lead to involuntary resettlement. PALYJA will be required to ensure that any \nland acquisition and resettlement activities are undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995).  A  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  is  attached  as \nAppendix 8. \n \nC.  Projected Financial Performance \n41.  Detailed financial projections for PALYJA are provided in Appendix 9 and the financial \nanalysis of the Project in Appendix 10. The main assumptions for the base case financial \nprojections include (i) customer growth of 2% per annum; (ii) domestic inflation of 7% per \nannum; (iii) adjustment to the water charge based on the negotiated formula in the renegotiated \ncooperation agreement to reflect changes in capital expenditures and operating expenditures; \nand (iv) inclusion of labor-related costs (golden handshake, or else known as the retirement \nprogram, harmonization of benefits and salary) as per the cooperation agreement. The financial \nprojections demonstrate PALYJA\u2019s ability to generate adequate cash flow to cover debt service \n ", "10  \nover the repayment period. The minimum projected debt service coverage ratio in the base case \nis 2.58 times, excluding the years where PALYJA has to fulfill its obligations in bond payments. \nSensitivity analysis for debt servicing capacity shows that PALYJA will have adequate financial \nresources,  even  in  a  variety  of  downside  scenarios  (Appendix  9).  Based  on  the  financial \nanalysis, the Project\u2019s financial internal rate of return is estimated at 12.8%, which is well above \nthe estimated weighted average cost of capital of 4.19%.  \n \nD.  Economic Evaluation \n42.  The Project has a strong economic rationale as it provides basic living conditions and \nassists  in  mitigating  health  hazards.  The  proposed  actions  under  the  Project  represent \ntechnically feasible options at the least cost. The economic internal rate of return is 58.5% \n(Appendix  11).  The  sensitivity  analysis  on  the  various  risk  parameters  indicates  that  the \nProject\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  well  above  30%  under  possible  adverse \ncircumstances. The health benefits of the Project and its contribution to conservation of the \ngroundwater table and prevention of further subsidence of Jakarta are additional benefits that \nwere not quantified in the economic analysis. These would strengthen economic returns from \nthe Project. \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Description \n1.  Loan Nature and Amount   \n43.  The proposal involves ADB providing PALYJA with an Indonesian rupiah-denominated \nloan of up to Rp455,000,000,000 with a maturity of up to 10 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears. The loan will be used to fund a portion of PALYJA\u2019s capital expenditure program for the \nthird 5-year period of the concession between 2008 and 2012. To this end, the disbursement \nwill be staggered over 3\u20134 years to best meet the needs of PALYJA. Detailed disbursement will \nbe discussed in detail in the loan agreement. PALYJA\u2019s remaining capital expenditure funding \nrequirement over the period will be met from internally generated cash flow. ADB will charge an \ninterest rate to be determined according to procedures applicable to ADB local currency loans \nfor private sector operations, as well as a commitment fee and a front-end fee to be approved \nby ADB\u2019s Credit Enhancement and Pricing Committee. \n \nB.  Justification  \n44.  ADB assistance is justified for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  PALYJA\u2019s capital expenditure program will enhance and expand water supply \ninfrastructure in West Jakarta, with a particular focus on increasing the number of \nlow-income customers by expanding distribution networks in low-income areas, \nand  will  help  meet  the  MDG  target  for  water  supply.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  local \ncurrency assistance is expected to lead to improved affordability of water tariffs in \nJakarta. \n \n(ii)  The Project is in line with the Government\u2019s objectives of increasing sustainable \neconomic growth, creating jobs, and accelerating achievement of the MDGs.  \n \n(iii)  The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s 2006\u20132009 country strategy and program for \nIndonesia, which outlines five key areas of engagement for ADB operations in \n ", " 11\nIndonesia, of which four are relevant in the context of the Project: (a) physical \ninfrastructure development, (b) financial sector deepening, (c) MDG acceleration, \nand (d) environment and natural resource management. Further, the strategic \nfocus  for  ADB  in  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management  is  on \nimproving local delivery of services. \n \n(iv)  The Project and ongoing ADB public sector projects are complementary. The \nimprovement of upstream water supply by ADB public sector operations will \ngreatly enhance the consistency of raw water supply for PALYJA, which intends \nto implement efficient water supply in Jakarta with ADB private sector assistance.  \n \n(v)  Water supply, sanitation, and waste management remain an ADB priority, both in \nthe short and medium terms. It is included as a first priority (group I) in both the \ncurrent country strategy and ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II.14  \n \n(vi)  The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s Water Financing Program 2006\u20132010, which \nfocuses  on  the  expansion  of  investments  in  water  infrastructure  and  good \ngovernance in water resource management. \n \n(vii)  ADB assistance is demonstrational. It is expected to have a positive impact on \nPALYJA\u2019s future access to commercial funding in local and international capital \nmarkets. Funding of the local currency loan by ADB from the market should have \na positive impact on the development of local capital markets as well. \n \nC.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n45.  Raw  Water  Supply. As the majority of PALYJA\u2019s water supply originates from the \nJatiluhur reservoir via the West Tarum Canal, PALYJA is exposed to possible water supply \ninterruptions due to (i) inadequate maintenance and repair of the canal and associated pumping \nstations, and (ii) lack of management capacity at Perum Jasa Tirta II. Backup water supply \nsources are of lower quality, resulting in higher processing costs. However, overall raw water \navailability is adequate and the risk of short-term supply interruptions from the primary source is \nexpected to be mitigated through the ADB public sector assistance for improving integrated \nwater resource management in the Citarum Basin and assistance with capacity building for \nPerum Jasa Tirta II. \n \n46.  Tariff  Policy  and  Adjustment  Risk.  The  history  of  policy  implementation  and \nenforcement for PALYJA\u2019s water supply concession is marred. PALYJA depends heavily on the \nGovernment\u2019s regulatory framework and commitment to policy implementation. In the 1990s, \npreviously agreed tariff adjustments had not been implemented due to political considerations, \nparticularly in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, and as a result PALYJA has not always \nreceived  the  full  amount  it  was  entitled  under  the  1998  cooperation  agreement.  The \nGovernment\u2019s inability to implement tariff increases affected the ability of PALYJA to collect the \nnecessary water charges to fund its capital expenditure program. Issues such as this will still \nhave  crucial  implications  for  PALYJA\u2019s  operating  and  financial  standing.  The  tariff  risk  is \nmitigated  through  (i)  establishment  of  the  automatic  tariff  adjustment  mechanism,  which \nresolves the main concern for the lack of sufficient water revenue to cover the water charge; (ii) \nPAM Jaya using surplus revenues to repay amounts owed to PALYJA as a result of earlier \nfailures to make tariff adjustments; (iii) ADB involvement in PALYJA as through its public-private \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2006. Medium-Term Strategy II, 2006\u20132008. Manila. \n ", "12  \npartnership model, it will be able to observe and raise issues with the Government on key policy \nand regulatory challenges. \n \n47.  Water Loss Risk. While the water loss ratio has decreased from 62% to 47% since \nPALYJA took over operation of the West Jakarta water supply system, water loss remains a \nsignificant problem for PALYJA. The main causes of water loss are (i) an aging pipeline network \nwith water loss through leakages, and (ii) high susceptibility to illegal connections in PALYJA\u2019s \ndistribution network. PALYJA\u2019s ability to rehabilitate the pipeline network and to control illegal \nconnections will have a direct impact on its financial performance. PALYJA\u2019s proposed 5-year \ncapital expenditure program is designed to address these issues. ADB support for the program \nwill help mitigate the risk of water loss. \n \nD.  Development Impact \n48.  First, the Project supports the Government\u2019s effort to meet the MDG target for water \nsupply by providing much-needed water supply infrastructure. Second, through assistance to \nPALYJA in developing its capital expenditure program, the Project will help the people of West \nJakarta gain access to more consistent and affordable water supply, especially for low-income \nhouseholds. Third, the Project complements ADB public sector efforts to improve the legal \nframework in the water sector as well as policy dialogue with the Government on overall water \nsector management and improvement. For instance, the proposed Integrated Citarum Water \nResource Management Project will help improve the upstream raw water supply system. Fourth, \nthe joint effort within ADB will also enhance the ability for PALYJA to gain access to additional \nprivate sector funds by way of demonstrating the positive influence ADB is expected to have on \nmanaging the Government\u2019s responsibilities with regard to public-private partnerships. Finally, \nby  using  funds  raised  in  the  local  market,  the  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \ndevelopment of local capital markets. \n \nE.  Development Effectiveness \n49.  The development effectiveness of the Project is assessed in terms of private sector \ndevelopment, business success, and economic sustainability. At the company level, PALYJA \nwill  be  in  a  position  to  comfortably  fund  its  proposed  capital  expenditure  program,  a  key \ncomponent to expanding water supply coverage in West Jakarta. The delivery of services to a \nbroader  customer  base  will  lead  to  increased  revenue  and  reinforce  PALYJA\u2019s  financial \nsustainability and continuous operations through the life of the concession. On a broader level, \nthe  development  effectiveness  is  reflected  in  the  establishment  of  a  well-maintained  and \nefficient water supply system in West Jakarta. The impact of this can be observed during the life \nof the concession by assessing the quality of the distribution system. Further, the longer tenor \noffered by the ADB local currency loan, which is not available in the local market, will lead to \nless cost pass-through to the consumers as a result of smaller tariff increases, which will in turn \nlead to more accessibility and affordability of water. The impact can be measured through \nassessment of the growth rate in the number of customers and the comparative rate of increase \nof water tariffs. \n \nF.  Anticorruption Measures   \n50.  PALYJA was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \npolicy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  PALYJA  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money \n ", " 13\nlaundering, or the financing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in \nsuch  activities.  The  loan  documentation  between  ADB  and  PALYJA  will  allow  ADB  to \ninvestigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings \n \nVI.  EXPOSURE LIMITS \n51.  This  investment  will  represent  1.53%  of  the  total  portfolio  of  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \nOperations Department, will increase ADB investment in the water supply and sanitation sector \nfrom 1.21% to 2.72%, and will increase ADB investment in Indonesia from 3.92% to 5.39%. The \nproposed assistance is within approved country and sector exposure limits. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n52.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nPALYJA. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will enter into \na  suitable  loan  agreement  and  other  required  documents,  following  the  approval  of  the \nproposed loan by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. These agreements will be on terms and conditions \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n53.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan, without government guarantee, of up to Rp455,000,000,000 to PT PAM \nLyonnaise Jaya (PALYJA) for the West Jakarta Water Supply Development Project from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  based  on  procedures \napplicable to ADB local currency loans for private sector operations, and on such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report and as may \nbe reported to the Board. \n \n \nC.

Water Resources and Watershed Management \n1.  Indonesia has some 500 rivers of substantial size that reach the sea and are grouped \ninto river basin areas. The estimated water resources by island group are given in Table A2.1, \nwhich indicate that water demand is only about 1.7% of potential. Most of the demand is \nconcentrated in Java or around urban areas in other islands where the demand/supply ratio is \nfar more critical, especially during the dry season. \n \nTable A2.1: Water Resources by Island \nSurface     Ground    Low     \nDemand/Supply Ratio \nWater      Water     Flow     \n(1990) (m3/s)  Storage \nPotential  Potential Available \nArea  Available \nIsland ('000 km2) (m3/s) (m3/s) (m3/s) Irrigation DMI Total (m3/s)\nJava / Bali 139         6 ,199 95 786 950 124    1 ,074 245\nNusa Tenggara 81         1 ,777 21 90 70 3 73 \u2014\nSumatra 470       2 3,660 n.a.       4,704 271 26 297 150\nKalimantan 535        32,279 n.a.       6,956 19 7 26 150\nSulawesi 187         2 ,488 44 561 120 6 126 \u2014\nMaluku 78         3 ,373 9 391 5 1 6 \u2014\nIrian Jaya 414        28,061 n.a.       4,140 2 1 1 \u2014\nTotal      1,904       9 7,837 169     17,628       1,437 168    1 ,603 545\nkm2 = square kilometer; m3/s = cubic meters per second; DMI = domestic, municipal, industrial water, n.a. = not \navailable. \nSource: Directorate of Planning and Programming, Ministry of Public Works. 1990. \n \n2.  Water quality varies depending on the season (wet versus dry), year, factory discharges, \nand  other  factors.  In  many  urban  development  areas  the  rivers  are  badly  polluted.  The \nGovernment, aware of the problem and of the need to clean up the environment, started a clean \nriver program (Prokasih) in 1989. \n \n3.  The objective of Prokasih is to reduce the pollution load from industrial activities through \na two-step process. In the first 5-year program, the Government conducted an inventory of \nindustries;  identified  potential  polluters;  evaluated  pollution  control  measures;  and  advised \nindustries on wastewater treatment, effluent standards, and pollution control regulations. During \nthe second 5 years, the offending industries entered into a commitment with local government to \nreduce pollution load, treat their discharges using the polluter pays principle, and pay fines \nimposed by the regional government. According to the follow-on Regulation 20/1990, each \nindustry must monitor its discharges monthly and report these together with wastewater plant \ntreatment performance to the provincial government. In reality, few industries comply with this \nregulation; most discharges do not conform to the prescribed standards; few sanctions or fines \nare imposed; and water quality continues to deteriorate. \n \n4.  Flooding occurs regularly throughout Indonesia and affects the water quality, particularly \nin the wet season. The incidence and extent of flooding vary according to rainfall profile and \nintensity, precedent soil saturation, ground permeability, and other factors. Human deforestation, \npoor agricultural practices, and extensive paving are increasing runoff from catchment areas. \nThe impact of floods is worsened by the filling in of wetlands, clogging up of facilities, and \n ", "16  Appendix 2 \nincreased channel roughness due to slum housing and plantations along the banks. In addition \nto flooding, these conditions can create devastating landslides, mud flows, and seiches.15  \n \nC.  Water Supply \n5.  Only 39% of the urban population and 15% of the rural population have access to \nadequate water supply. Water is supplied and distributed by different providers, depending on \nthe area covered. The providers are (i) 318 PDAMs, generally supplying piped water; (ii) formal \nprivate sector; and (iii) small-scale private water providers, which make up the informal private \nsector. Tables A2.2 and A2.3 provide a summary of current and projected water supply by \nregion and sector. \n \nTable A2.2: Annual Water Supply (million cubic meters) in 2000 \n \nRiver \nRegion  DMI  Maintenance  Irrigation  Fishpond  Livestock  Total \nJava and Bali  6,141  7,203  36,607  805  212  50,968 \nSumatra  1,465  1,767  14,662  1,257  98  19,249 \nKalimantan  346  484  3,265  44  18  4,157 \nSulawesi  441  506  8,266  753  75  10,041 \nMaluku and \nNusaTenggara  254  266  6,168  354  24  7,066 \nIrian Jaya  60  77  675  0  0  812 \nIndonesia  8,707  10,303  69,643  3,213  427  92,293 \nSource: Japan International Cooperation Agency. 1993.

Before  1999,  the  central  Government  financed  all  public  utility  investments  through \ngrants, subsidies, or loans to the regional governments. Upon the issuance of Law No. 22 of \n1999 on Regional Governance, the central Government devolved authority for all aspects of \nlocal infrastructure and service delivery, including planning, providing, financing, and managing \nwater supply and sanitation, to district and city governments (kabupaten and kota). \n \n                                                 \n15  Seiches are river surges that usually result from large landslips causing a temporary dam in the river, or from the \ncollapse of temporary logging dams. \n ", "Appendix 2  17 \n7.  After decentralization, the bulk of financing responsibilities for water supply rested with \nthe  PDAMs.  However,  many  of  the  PDAMs  throughout  Indonesia  are  unable  to  provide \nminimum services to consumers and are financially unsustainable due to inadequate tariffs. \nFurther, the lack of financial sustainability has resulted in heavy debt obligations incurred by the \nPDAMs to the central Government amounting to $500 million, on top of other forms of external \nand commercial debt. \n \n8.  To address the difficulties faced by PDAMs, the Indonesian House of Representatives \napproved the new draft law on water resources.16 The law explicitly stipulates private sector \nparticipation  in  water  supply  services,  thereby  breaking  the  monopoly  of  the  PDAMs. \nSpecifically, the law provides clarity on the roles and responsibilities of regional governments, \nPDAMs, and private partners, as well as establishes the legal framework for use of water and \nresource protection. Water resource and river basin management was delegated to Perum Jasa \nTirta I and Perum Jasa Tirta II, wastewater disposal and solid waste management to regional \ngovernments, and water supply provision to the PDAMs. If the PDAMs are unable to undertake \nthe task themselves, the law stipulates that they should delegate the task to other business \nentities and the private sector. \n \n9.  The water resources law also requires the establishment of a national regulator for water \nsupply and sanitation, which is to function independently. Establishment of the regulator is \nintended  to  maintain  the  balance  of  interests  among  the  governments,  operators,  and \nconsumers. The regulator is anticipated to be instrumental in creating an enabling environment \nfor private sector participation, and to help set standards on operating and financial performance \nfor the PDAMs. In summary, measures to improve PDAM efficiency and financial and operating \nperformance include (i) imposing cost-recovery tariffs, (ii) improving revenue collection, (iii) \nenhancing  financial  management  and  accounting,  (iv)  reducing  nonrevenue  water,  (v) \nexpanding coverage with service connections, and (vi) improving customer orientation. \n \nD.  Wastewater Management and Sanitation \n10.  The primary goal of sanitation, public health, and wastewater management is to provide \nthe rural and urban populations with facilities for the safe, efficient, and sustainable collection \nand  disposal  of  wastewater,  thereby  producing  a  clean  and  healthy  living  environment  in \nhouseholds and neighborhoods.  \n \n11.  Wastewater management comprises two distinct services. The first involves removing \nwastewater from the point of generation to provide households with a clean and healthy living \nenvironment.  The  second  comprises  collecting  sewage  from  the  point  of  generation  and \nconveying it away from the living environment for treatment and disposal in a way that does not \npollute  the  environment.  In  urban  areas,  these  functions  are  performed  by  urban  public \nwastewater services: sewerage and sewage treatment plants. In rural areas, the function is \nperformed by toilets connected to septic tanks, where sewage can be denatured and rendered \nfor agricultural use or disposal. \n \n12.  Urban sewerage coverage in Indonesia is low, with only seven cities having some kind \nof partial network. Most people rely on on-site sanitation facilities such as septic tanks. However, \nsewage collection and disposal is generally inadequate, and most sewage still ends up in rivers \nor  canals.  Widespread  contamination  of  surface  water  and  groundwater  has  resulted  in \nrecurrent epidemics and a high incidence of waterborne diseases as well as environmental \nimpact.  \n                                                 \n16  Water Resources Law 7/2004, approved February 2004. \n ", "18  Appendix 2 \n13.  Rural households mainly rely on self-provision through shallow groundwater abstraction, \nrainwater collection, or use of surface water from nearby rivers and springs. Only about 27% of \nrural households claim to regularly use toilet facilities. Community-managed systems serve \nabout 30% of the rural population, mostly through their own efforts or with the support of \nnational  and/or  donor-funded  initiatives.  The  lack  of  sufficient  access  to  wastewater \nmanagement and available facilities leads to increasing risks of diarrhea, intestinal worms, skin \ndisease, and other water-related diseases such as malaria and dengue. \n \n1.  Key Challenges \n14.  The key issues affecting Indonesia\u2019s water sector are (i) low service coverage with \npiped water supply, (ii) financially unsustainable water supply services, and (iii) lack of sanitation \nservices.  \n \na.  Low Service Coverage with Piped Water Supply \n15.  Lack of access to water has a major impact on economic development, health, and well-\nbeing of the population. Many of the PDAMs throughout Indonesia are barely able to provide \nminimum services to consumers and have connected only about 39% of the urban population to \npiped water supply. As a result, over 70% of the population obtains water from potentially \ncontaminated sources. Unsafe drinking water leads to diarrhea, which is the second leading \ncause of death of children under 5 years of age in the country and accounts for about 20% of \nchild deaths each year. \n \nb.  Unsustainable Financing of Water Supply Services  \n16.  The widespread lack of cost recovery tariffs, compounded by the limited size of the \nPDAMs and low revenue collection, has resulted in reduced or abandonment of maintenance \nand investment activities, deteriorating assets, as well as low service coverage and quality. Of \nthe 318 PDAMs, 82% are experiencing losses and 44% are operating unsustainably. Of these, \n119 have foreign debt and 146 have domestic debt.17   \n \nc.  Lack of Sanitation Services \n17.  Poor sanitation services impact negatively on public health and the well-being of the \npopulation. The high incidence of waterborne diseases is a potent indicator of the problems in \nthe sector. Every year, at least 300 of 1,000 Indonesians suffer from waterborne disease, \nincluding cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever, according to the Ministry of Health. Formal \nsewerage systems in Indonesia have been constructed in selected areas of a few large cities, \nbut  most  are  underutilized  and  underfunded,  and  therefore  unable  to  realize  the  planned \nbenefits of these systems. Overall, about 3% for the urban population is connected to sewerage. \nThe vast majority of citizens still rely on on-site sanitation (e.g., septic tanks, and pit latrines), \nwhile many low-income families rely on grossly polluted drains and urban waterways.  \n \nE.  History of Water Supply in Jakarta \n18.  The water supply system in Jakarta originally started in 1920 under the Dutch through a \ncombination of deep wells and springs. As the city grew, demand for water also increased and \nled  to  the  construction  of  new  water  treatment/supply  facilities  with  state,  bilateral,  and \nmultilateral  assistance.  The  first  large  water  treatment  plant  in  Jakarta,  Pejompongan  I  \n(2 cubic meters/second [m3/sec]), was built in 1953 and the Pejompongan II water treatment \nplant (3 m3/sec) in 1964. In the 1980s, during great urban and industrial development in Jakarta, \n                                                 \n17  PDAM Performance Assessment Guidelines, Home Ministerial Decree No.47/1999.  \n ", "Appendix 2  19 \ntwo water treatment plants, Pulogadung (4 m3/sec) and Buaran (5 m3/sec) were built. In addition, \nseven smaller water treatment plants (<0.2 m3/sec) began operating before 1997.   \n \n19.  Jakarta\u2019s raw water supply mostly comes from surface water, of which 80% is from the \nCitarum River, located east of Jakarta. The water is managed through several dams, including \nthe  Saguling,  Cirata,  and  Jatiluhur  dams.  These  dams  are  also  used  for  electric  power \ngeneration, river flow management, irrigation, tourism, and industrial purposes. The water is \nchanneled  for  distribution  through  the  West  Tarum  Canal.  Another  15%  comes  from  the \nCisadane River, west of Jakarta; the remaining 5% comes from smaller rivers flowing from West \nJava Province to the Jakarta area, such as the Ciliwung, Krukut, and Pesanggarahan rivers.   \n \n20.  In 1968, PDAM Jakarta was separated from the Ministry of Public Works, and in 1977, \nthe Jakarta Water Supply Enterprise, Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya (PAM Jaya) \nwas  established  to  replace  PDAM  Jakarta  as  the  provider  of  water  supply  and  sewerage \nservices for Jakarta.18 \n \n21.  Due  to  the  lack  of  discipline  and  monitoring,  extension  of  services  for  production \ncapacity and distribution to end users were not ideal. By 1997, water supply infrastructure was \ncharacterized by old and rusted pipes, bad connections, damaged valves, and groundwater \nintrusion resulting in decreased water pressure in customers\u2019 taps. Unaccounted for water was \naround 57% due to illegal connections, physical losses, and meter tampering.  \n \n22.  In 1994, the Jakarta city government developed a master plan to improve access to \ndrinking water for the population of Jakarta. By 2019, 83% of Jakarta was expected to have \naccess to drinking water. To achieve this goal, the key activities included (i) establish new water \ntreatment plants, (ii) expand and build new pipeline systems, (iii) rehabilitate damaged pipelines, \n(iv)  increase  the  number  of  connections,  (v)  increase  water  pressure  and  (iv)  decrease \nunaccounted for water. \n \n23.  To  accelerate  the  improvement  of  water  delivery  service  and  to  accommodate  the \nredirection of government policy in infrastructure development from public financing to private \nfinancing, private sector participation was encouraged. As a result, PAM Jaya entered into 25-\nyear concession agreements with two private operators, effective from February 1998, with \nSuez Lyonnaise des Eaux (PT Pam Lyonnaise Jaya) and Thames Water International (PT \nThames Pam Jaya), to serve the western and eastern parts of Jakarta respectively.  \n                                                 \n18  Regional Government Regulation No. 3/1977. \n ", " \nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK PRIVATE SECTOR OPERATIONS IN INDONESIA  2\n0\n($\u2018000)   \n \nA\nInvestment  ADB  Equity  Combined  Date of  p\nCompany  Guarantee CFS  p\nNo.  Loan  Investmenta  Total  Approval  e\nn\nd\n            ix\nUnder Administration             3 \n7039/979  PT BBL Danatama Finance  15.000  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  15.000  26-Oct-89\n7054/1023  PT Bakrie Finance Corp.  15.000  1.250  \u2013  \u2013  16.250  09-Aug-90\n \n7068/1083  PT Seamless Pipe Indonesia Jaya  15.000  5.000  \u2013  \u2013  20.000  28-May-91\n7224/2214  HSBC Bank USA, National Associationb  350.000  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  350.000  14-Dec-05\n7239  Deutsche Bank AG  \u2013  0.200  9.800  \u2013  10.000  26-Jul-06\n7243/2251  PT Perusahan Gas Negara (Persero)  75.000  \u2013  \u2013  125.000  200.000  10-Aug-06\nTBK \n7252/2325  PT Semen Andalas Indonesia  45.000  68.000  \u2013  45.000  158.000  16-Mar-07\n             \nDivested, Written Down, and Fully Repaid           \n7005  PT Kratama Belindo Int\u2019l  \u2013  0.400  \u2013  \u2013  0.400  25-Jun-85\n7026/905  PT Gunung Garuda  15.000  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  15.000  27-Sep-88\n7029  PT Bank UPPINDO  \u2013  1.675  \u2013  \u2013  1.675  17-Nov-88\n7038/978  PT Mediasarana Multi Finance  5.000  0.339  \u2013  \u2013  5.339  26-Oct-89\n7044  PT Asian Development Securities Co.  \u2013  1.186  \u2013  \u2013  1.186  19-Dec-89\n7045  PT Indonesia Development Fund Ltd.  \u2013  6.000  \u2013  \u2013  6.000  19-Dec-89\n7088/1227  PT Wiraswata Gemilang   17.000  1.500  \u2013  \u2013  18.500  22-Apr-93\n             \nCanceled           \n7004  Bank Pembangunan Indonesia  \u2013  1.000  \u2013  \u2013  1.000  25-Jun-85\n(BAPINDO) \n7030  BAPINDO II  \u2013  5.000  \u2013  \u2013  5.000  29-Nov-88\n7073/1119  PT Ispat Steel  30.000  7.500  \u2013  \u2013  37.500  19-Nov-91\n7100/1284  PT Sunnymas Prima Agung  9.000  2.000  \u2013  \u2013  11.000  07-Dec-93\n7129/1496  PT Banjarmasin Agrojaya Mandiri  32.500  8.125  \u2013  \u2013  40.625  28-Nov-96\n7148  Secondary Mortgage Facility  \u2013  3.000  \u2013  \u2013  3.000  25-Jun-98\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CFS = complementary financing scheme. \na  Equity investment includes direct equity investment, line of equity, and underwriting.  \nb   Tangguh liquefied natural gas project.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n ", "Appendix 4  21     \nPT PAM LYONNAISE JAYA: DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY OF CONCESSION \n \n1.

Its main focus includes a toll road, water \nsupply, and power generation. Detailed project involvement include the following: \n \n(i)  Toll road. Astratel bought a 54% stake in toll-road operator PT Marga Mandala \nSakti (MMS) in August 2005; its effective ownership is 34%. MMS is the toll road \noperator of 72.45 km from Tangerang to Merak with a 30-year concession right. \nMMS has been in operation since 1992 and has 450 employees.

As  of  March  2007,  PALYJA  has  1,400  employees,  of  which  902  are  employees \nseconded from Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya (PAM Jaya) at the outset of the \nconcession period. PALYJA is currently in the process of integrating seconded employees to \nbecome permanent employees of PALYJA, with the objective of enhancing employee equality \nand  providing  more  flexibility  with  regard  to  labor  management.  The  organization  chart  is \npresented in Figure A4.2. \n \n \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \n \n \nFigure A4.2: PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya Organization Chart \n \n \n \nSource: PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya. \n \nD.  Operations \n14.  PALYJA  operates  four  water  treatment  plants  including  Pejompongan  I  and  II  \n; Cilandak South; and Taman Kota North, and more than 5,000 km of primary, secondary, and \ntertiary water supply networks.  \n \n1.  Treated Water Production \n15.  Sixty percent of PALYJA\u2019s water supplies are treated in the Pejompongan plants using \nwater sourced from the West Tarum Canal system, which originates from Jatiluhur reservoir,  \n70 km southeast of Jakarta. The West Tarum Canal system is operated by Perum Jasa Tirta II, \na state-owned company. Thirty-four percent of PALYJA\u2019s water supply is purchased, as bulk \ntreated water, from Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM) Tangerang. The remaining 6% of \nthe company\u2019s water supply is from other surface water, which is treated in PALYJA\u2019s water \ntreatment plants prior to distribution.  \n \n16.  PALYJA\u2019s  abstraction  point  from  West  Tarum  Canal  is  located  at  Cawang  at  the \ndownstream end. During the dry seasons an estimated 60% of the raw water supplied by the \ncanal is from Jatiluhur; during the rest of the year it is between 20%-30%. The balance is mainly \nfrom Bekasi River. Due to intensive development in the Bekasi River catchment, the water is \nhighly  turbid,  especially  in  the  rainy  season  and  also  polluted  by  industrial  and  municipal \nwastewater. The volume varies substantially during heavy rainfalls in the catchment. These \nsudden variations can affect water treatment plant operation and the treatment process. \n  \n17.  Each of PALYJA\u2019s plants is equipped with treated water reservoirs and pumping facilities. \nThe two main water treatment plants at Pejompongan utilize electricity supplied by PLN as the \nsource of power to distribute treated water to PALYJA\u2019s distribution network. Each of the plants \n ", "Appendix 4  27     \nhas two sources of electricity from PLN and during the 9 years of operation interruption of the \npower supply has been minimal, but has increased lately. \n \n2.  Distribution Network \n18.  PALYJA\u2019s  concession  area  extends  over  340  square  kilometers.  While  the  water \ndistribution network covers the city center, the periphery of the concession area has limited \ncoverage.  The  distribution  network  consists  of  primary,  secondary,  and  tertiary  pipes  to \ntransport  and  distribute  treated  water  from  PALYJA\u2019s  production  and  pumping  facilities  to \nindividual  customers.  PALYJA  also  operates  a  limited  length  of  transmission  lines,  which \ntransport bulk treated water, supplied by PDAM Tangerang, from the Jakarta city boundary to \nthe pumping facilities.  \n \n19.  To date, the total recorded length of the network is 5,105 km, of which 7% comprises \nprimary  mains  (>300  mm  in  diameter),  20%  secondary  pipelines  (150\u2013250  mm),  and  the \nremainder tertiary pipes (<150 mm). Since 1998, 1,500 km of new pipes have been laid as part \nof the extension program and about 646 km of pipes replaced. \n \n20.  Since 1998, PALYJA has reduced water losses (commercial and physical losses) from \n62% to about 49%, as a result of a continuous rehabilitation program including (i) leak detection \nand repair, (ii) network rehabilitation followed by decommissioning of old pipes, (iii) pressure \ncontrol  to  reduce  leakage,  (iv)  customer  meter  replacement,  and  (v)  detection  of  illegal \nconnections and unregistered customers. \n \n3.  Customers \n21.  Since 1998, PALYJA has increased the number of water connections to end users, from \n201,668 at the beginning of the concession to 351,230 at the end of 2006. This represents a \n74% increase as a result of network densification, expansion, and rehabilitation.  \n \n22.  In  developing  future  customers,  PALYJA  is  sensitive  to  providing  services  for  low-\nincome  customers,  ensuring  that  low-income  areas  are  given  priority  for  establishing  new \ndistribution networks and connections. Further, the water tariffs approved by the governor of \nJakarta are set such that social and low-income customers pay less for water than high-income \nindividuals and business entities. As a result, the number of low-income customers increased by \n456% as compared with the 50% increase of middle and upper-income customers since the \nbeginning of the concession. \n \n23.  To better serve customers and help ensure customer satisfaction, PALYJA has set up a \n24-hour call center to handle emergencies such as leaks, broken pipes, and other such events. \nBill payment is facilitated through collaboration with a number of entities, and customers may \npay their bill in a number of ways, including Citibank 1 Bill, Bank BCA ATM, by direct debit, or at \nany Jakarta post office. Alternatively, customers can pay at any of PALYJA\u2019s own payment \ncenters. To make customer management more efficient, PALYJA maintains an online customer \ninformation system, centralizing customer profiles and information records on billing, payment \ncollection, and the reconciliation process. On average, approximately 80% of customers pay \ntheir bill within 1 month of receipt; historically the overall collection rate is 97%\u201398%. \n \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nE.  History of the Concession \n1.  Background \n24.  Since  the  official  start  of  the  privatization  campaign  in  1995  at  the  orders  of  then \nPresident Suharto, Jakarta developed one of the world\u2019s largest public-private partnerships in \nthe water sector. The city of Jakarta was divided into two parts, east and west, with the \nboundaries determined by the natural flow of Ciliwung River. A number of stakeholders were \ninvolved in the privatization, including the Jakarta city government; PAM Jaya, the state-owned \nwater utility;19 and the two newly established private companies, PT Thames PAM Jaya20 and \nPALYJA. \n \n25.  On 1 February 1998, PALYJA formally entered into a 25-year cooperation agreement \nwith the Government. The concession allows PALYJA to take over responsibility of operation, \nmaintenance,  and  development  of  the  water  supply  system  from  PAM  Jaya,  including \nrehabilitation and expansion of the water supply network, meter reading, bill collection, and \ncustomer service. All existing assets, except the PAM Jaya headquarters office, are managed \nby the private partner, and at the end of concession all assets including new assets built by the \nprivate partner will be returned to PAM Jaya. \n \n26.  Within 3 months of signing the original cooperation agreement, Indonesia was involved \nin the economic turmoil of the Asian financial crisis. Following the overthrow of the Suharto \nregime in 1998, challenges were made to the legitimacy of the two concessions. The Indonesian \nGovernment  under  President  Habibie  temporarily  reclaimed  the  concessions  under  public \nauthority. Control of the West Jakarta concession was returned to PALYJA, but not without \nrenegotiation of the terms and conditions of the original cooperation agreement. In 2001, PAM \nJaya and PALYJA finalized the terms of a renegotiated cooperation agreement.  \n \n  2.  Delinking Tariffs and Revenues \n27.  One of the innovations of the concession is the delinking of (i) the revenues received by \nPALYJA under the cooperation agreement (the water charge), and (ii) revenues collected from \nconsumers by PALYJA (the water revenues). This system offers two main advantages: (i) it \nhelps balance revenues between the two concessionaires in Jakarta, given the differences in \nsocial  and  economic  characteristics  of  the  two  concessions,  which  affect  both  costs  and \nrevenues; and (ii) it allows the Government greater flexibility in the timing of tariff increases. \n \n28.  The water charge received by PALYJA comprises a flat rate of revenue for each unit of \nwater delivered, which is set according to PALYJA\u2019s financial projections, including projections \nof operating and capital expenditures and financing costs, to provide a fixed rate of return on \nequity (in rupiah) of 22% over the life of the concession. The water charge is adjusted every \nsemester to account for fluctuations in the exchange and interest rates, and is reviewed at 5-\nyear intervals in the rate rebasing exercise. Rate rebasing establishes a revised operating and \nfinancial  plan,  which  is  used  as  the  basis  for  establishing  appropriate  charges  for  the \nsubsequent 5 years. \n \n                                                 \n19  PAM Jaya had the historical responsibility of water supply in the city of Jakarta. Appendix 2 provides more details \non the background of PAM Jaya operations prior to the concessions. \n20  PT Thames PAM Jaya is a joint venture between RWE Thames (Thames), a British multinational owned by \nGerman Rheinisch- Westf\u00e4lisches Elektrizit\u00e4tswerk, and PT Kekarpola Airindo (PKA), a local company \n ", "Appendix 4  29     \n29.  Customers, on the other hand, pay differentiated tariffs according to a preestablished \nschedule. The Jakarta city government is responsible for assessing and setting the water tariff \nschedule; and a decree of the governor of Jakarta is required to change the water tariff.  \n \n  3.  Revenue Sharing \n30.  The water revenues collected by PALYJA are transferred into an escrow account, from \nwhich funds are transferred to PALYJA to meet the water charge and to PAM Jaya. According \nto priorities established in the cooperation agreement, funds will be made available in the \nfollowing  order:  (i)  capital  and  operating  expenditures  for  PALYJA  and  relevant  financing \ncharges; (ii) payment to PAM Jaya and the Jakarta city government, debt repayment to the \nMinistry of Finance, and the regulatory body\u2019s requirements; and (iii) payments for the revenue \nshortfall and other monies. The mechanisms are illustrated in Figure A4.4. \n \n \nFigure A4.4: Revenue Sharing under Concession \n \n \nDKI = Daerah Khusus Ibukota, PALYJA = PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya, PAM Jaya = Perusahaan \nDaerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya. \nSource: PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya. \n \n \n \n  4.  Revenue Shortfall and Corrections \n31.  The original intention was that water tariffs would always be set such that water revenue \nexceeds the water charge by a margin sufficient to cover (i) administrative costs of PAM Jaya \nand the regulatory body, (ii) repayments due on PAM Jaya\u2019s previously incurred loans from the \nMinistry of Finance, and (iii) PALYJA\u2019s operating and capital investment costs.  \n \n32.  However,  the  combination  of  the  tariff  freeze  imposed  through  2000  and  the  high \nincrease of the water charge as a result of the rupiah devaluation and soaring inflation resulted \nin a shortfall of water revenue relative to the water charge. The revenue shortfall was treated as \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nan account payable to PALYJA from PAM Jaya, to be paid when water tariffs could once again \nbe raised so that the water revenue exceeded the water charge. \n \n33.  Water  tariffs  were  first  increased  by  35%  in  April  2001  at  the  conclusion  of  the \nrenegotiated cooperation agreement negotiations. For a short period, water revenues were \nsufficient to cover the water charge. As part of the renegotiated cooperation agreement, the \nJakarta government committed to increase tariffs in both January 2002 and January 2003. \nNeither of these tariff increases was implemented, and as a result, water revenue once again \ndropped below the water charge, adding to the accrued liabilities of PAM Jaya to PALYJA. \nTariffs were eventually raised in April 2003 (by 40%) and in January 2004 (by 30%). In 2005, a \nproposal  for  automatic  tariff  increases\u2014automatic  tariff  adjustment  mechanism\u2014was \nimplemented by the Jakarta government with the objective of keeping water revenue above the \nwater charge on a consistent basis. Since the second quarter of 2003, water revenue has \nconsistently  exceeded  the  water  charge  and  PAM  Jaya  has  applied  some  of  the  excess \nrevenues to repaying amounts owed to PALYJA.  \n ", "Appendix 5  31 \nENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL DUE DILIGENCE REPORT21 \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Jakarta water supply enterprise, Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Jakarta Raya (PAM \nJaya), a state-owned enterprise established in 1977, was responsible for water supply and \nsewerage services in Jakarta until late 1997. In 1997, the right to operate the city\u2019s water supply \nsystem was offered to private enterprises under two separate concessions: PT PAM Lyonnaise \nJaya  (PALYJA)  in  West  Jakarta  and  PT  James  Pam  Jaya  in  East  Jakarta.  They  began \noperations  in  early  1998.  PALYJA  shareholders  comprise  SUEZ  Environment  (51%),  PT \nAstratel  Nusantara22 (Astratel,  30%),  and  Citigroup  Financial  Products,  Inc.  (19%).  SUEZ \nEnvironment is a branch of the global SUEZ SA (SUEZ)23 that supplies services, plant, and \nequipment drinking water production and distribution, wastewater collection and treatment, and \nwaste processing and recycling. \n \n2.  PALYJA has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing for the development \nof the water supply network in Western Jakarta in support of the Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) target of reducing the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and \nbasic sanitation by half by 2015 (MDG 7, Target 10), The proposed ADB loan will be used by \nPALYJA to partially fund its capital expenditure program during the third 5-year period of the \nconcession (2008\u20132012)  for  the  expansion  of  the  company\u2019s  water  production and  supply \nnetwork in its West Jakarta concession area. While PALYJA\u2019s corporate vision is to \u201cbe the \npreferred water services provider in Indonesia by satisfying customers and adding value to \nstakeholders,\u201d  its  mission  statement  includes  a  commitment  to  be  \u201csocially  responsible,  to \nprotect the environment and to implement good governance.\u201d24 \n \nB.  Organization Structure \n \n3.  PALYJA is a subsidiary of SUEZ and is one of the largest water service providers in \nIndonesia.  PALYJA  entered  into  a  25-year  cooperation  agreement  with  the  Government \ncommencing 1 February 1998. The scope of services under the agreement includes the design, \nconstruction,  refurbishment,  and  operation  of  water  supply  systems,  technical  and  quality \ncontrol, human resources and training, financing of new works, and billing and collection. \n \n4.  PALYJA has almost 1,400 employees, of which about 900 are employees seconded \nfrom PAM Jaya at the outset of the concession. PALYJA is currently integrating seconded \nemployees  to  become  permanent  employees  of  PALYJA,  with  the  objective  of  enhancing \nemployee equality and providing more flexibility in labor management. \n \n5.

Beiling; and N. \nSoewarno) that visited PALYJA offices, facilities, and construction sites during 1\u20133 May 2007.   \n22   Astratel is a subsidiary company of PT Astra International Tbk (Astra), an Indonesian conglomerate that \nemploys  nearly  120,000  employees  in  a  widely  diversified  portfolio  (automotive,  financial  services,  heavy \nequipment, agribusiness, information technology, and infrastructure), with a market capitalization of over $4.0 \nbillion.  \n23   SUEZ is an international industrial and services group based in France for the energy and environment \nsectors, with more than 150,000 staff working across four continents serving some 200 million people in 3,000 \nmunicipalities, and with annual revenues of over $50 billion.  \n24  PALYJA, Vision, Mission and Values. \n ", "32  Appendix 5 \n(i)  population served in West Jakarta increased by 1.25 million, of which 20% are \nmembers of low-income communities; \n(ii)  service coverage ratio increased from 32% in 1998 to more than 55% in 2006; \n(iii)  low-income  customers  increased  by  370%,  and  middle-  and  upper-income \ncustomers by more than 50%; \n(iv)  water loss or unaccounted for water reduced by 12%, i.e., from 60% to 48%; \n(v)  improvement of the state of the network and reduction in water shortage is \nnoticeable; and \n(vi)  99% of treated water fully complies with clean water standards, i.e., water quality \ncompliance both at the production and distribution facilities. \n \nC.  Social and Institutional Issues \n \n6.  Employment Conditions. PALYJA\u2019s Company Regulations 2006\u20132008 are based on \nPancasila  and  the  Indonesian  Constitution  (UUD  1945),  and  prevailing  human  resource \nregulations in Indonesia. The regulations contain work requirements, procedures, and rights, as \nwell as obligations of the company and employees. PALYJA subscribes to all International \nLabor  Organization  conventions  related  to  workplace  conditions  that  have  been  ratified  in \nIndonesia, particularly as its shareholders are SUEZ, a major global employer, and Astratel, one \nof Indonesia\u2019s largest conglomerates. All employees have positions that are fully pensionable \nwith adequate benefits.  \n \n7.  Workplace  Conditions.  Health  and  safety  are  covered  by  Articles  44\u201353  of  the \nCompany Regulations 2006\u20132008.25 Occupational accidents are covered under PT Jamsostek26 \nregulations.  A  comprehensive  employee  safety  handbook  is  issued  to  all  employees  and \ncontractors, and a signed statement of understanding kept on file. An exceptional feature of \nPALYJA\u2019s commitment is that it has a well-structured health and safety strategy and action plan \nwith clear objectives, processes, and targets. PALYJA aims to achieve Gold (Occupational \nHealth and Safety Management System) and Occupational Health and Safety Assessment \nSpecification 18001 by 2009. Grievances are handled through an employee protection panel, \nwhich  consists  of  representatives  of  PALYJA,  PAM  Jaya,  and  the  PALYJA  labor  union. \nCurrently, PALYJA does not have a union, although PAM Jaya has three unions. Within the \norganization, the Health Safety Department reports to the director, corporate affairs. Accident \nrates have been very low, with only one work-related accident reported in 2007, and no fatalities \nreported since PALYJA assumed its responsibilities. As corporate offices and plants are located \nin the city, the sites have basic first-aid facilities, with immediate access to local hospitals. \nHazardous wastes, essentially chlorine, are stored and secured in regulated locations to ensure \nsafety for workers on-site. Regular fire drills and training in first aid are held at corporate offices \nand plants.  \n \n8.  Community  Consultation,  Disclosure,  and  Grievance  Procedures. 27 PALYJA \nmanages its territory with three service units. Each unit (south, west, central) has a dedicated \npublic relations team to conduct community meetings on PALYJA projects. About 2 weeks \nbefore the project starts, the public relations team, together with the contractor, will contact the \n                                                 \n25  These also draw on the 2002 Health and Safety Charter of SUEZ \n26   The Indonesian social welfare organization that seeks compliance with human rights identified in articles 24\u2013\n34  of  the  Constitution,  articles  22\u201325  of  the  United  Nations  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  and \nInternational Labour Organization Convention 102 (1952). The regulations are based on Law 33 of 1947 on \nEmployment Accidents, Law 2 of 1951 on Work Accidents, and Law 14 of 1969 on Main Provisions for Labor. \nJAMSOSTEK covers employment accident, death benefits, old-age benefits, and health care benefits.  \n27   PALYJA. 2006.

For complaints during civil \nworks, the community may contact either the contractor or related units in PALYJA; once they \nbecome PALYJA customers, they can contact the PALYJA call center, a 24-hour service. \n \n9.  Customer Satisfaction. A comparison of customer satisfaction survey results between \n2005  and  2006  show  an  increase  in  positive  responses  from  customers  covering  all \nareas/categories (domestic, commercial, and institutional) (Table A5.1) \n \nTable A5.1: Summary of Customer Opinion \nResults \nCustomer Satisfaction \n2005  2006 \nOverall   55%  64% \nOn billing process  72%  79% \nOn meter reading accuracy  66%  78% \nOn customer service  46%  59% \nOn water quality (pressure, supply continuity, potability, cleanliness, \nabsence of unpleasant odor, color/clearness, and chlorine-like odor)  64%  67% \nSource: PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya. \n \n10.  Water Supply-Related Social Issues. In the area served by PALYJA, affordability for \nlow-income consumers is assured because of the significant cross-subsidy from non-domestic \nconsumers, who pay about Rp12,500/cubic meter (m3) compared with Rp1,050/m3 for low-\nincome clients. While significant groundwater is extracted through borewells, for which the \napproximate cost is Rp3,500/m3, consumers are gradually appreciating the convenience of \nassured -clean water supply compared with the bacteria-laden and mineral-heavy groundwater.  \n \n11.  Following the lead of its two major shareholders, SUEZ and Astratel, PALYJA has a \nstructured approach to community relations: community development programs, low-income \nconsumers  (water  for  all),  orphanages  (tuition),  disaster  (Jogjakarta  earthquake),  26  water \ntankers free for those who have no access (slums, breakdowns/interruptions), and slum water \nreservoirs. PALYJA finances about $2.5 million ($5 million is the total if TPJ included) of low-\nincome water access schemes under the World Bank\u2019s Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid \nfor some 7,000 families. Responding to the recent tsunami in Aceh, PALYJA set up six mobile \nwater purification units, placed four staff in the area for more than 3 months to be responsible \nfor  continuous  delivery  of  potable  water  using  two  50,000-liter  water  supply  vehicles, \ncoordinated the logistics of 18 potable water supply vehicles in the area that were subsequently \nturned over to a nongovernment organization, assigned two people to maintain the water supply \nline until connections were reestablished, and provided training to PDAM Aceh\u2019s municipal \nwater company. In addition the Group28 and Fondation Suez made substantial cash donations.29  \n \n                                                 \n28   SUEZ  maintains  a  volunteer  humanitarian  aid  group,  Aquassistance,  which  responds  to  emergency \nenvironment and water supply situations worldwide. \n29  Created in 1992, the Suez Foundation lends support to children in adversity. It assists projects that contribute to \nthe respect, protection, and full development of children throughout the world. Its three priority areas of concern are \nchildren facing prolonged hospitalization, children infected with AIDS, and children who are victims of profound \nupheaval or whose lives are extremely precarious.  \n ", "34  Appendix 5 \nD.  Environmental Issues \n \n1.  Corporate Environment Policy   \n \n12.  PALYJA\u2019s corporate environment charter was approved on 10 October 2006. Following \nthe president\u2019s remarks,30 the charter\u2019s preamble sets out four areas through which it intends to \nfulfill PALYJA commitment to environmental management:  \n \n(i)  Commitment \n(a)  taking account of environmental and sustainable development \n(b)  respect for environmental protection and public health laws \n(c)  organization and responsibilities \n(d)  mobilizing each employee \n(ii)  Understanding \n(a)  environmental analysis \n(b)  risk prevention \n(c)  crisis management \n(d)  willingness to listen \n(iii)  Know-how \n(a)  research and development \n(b)  reducing adverse impacts and improving the environment \n(iv)  Sharing \n(a)  communication \n(b)  partnership \n(c)  awareness raising, education, and training \n(d)  sponsorship \n \n13.  The areas cover those identified by ADB as essential elements of an environmental \nmanagement system (EMS): policy statement, work processes and procedures, organization, \nbudgeting, monitoring, and reporting. The EMS is also consistent with the requirements of \nIndonesia\u2019s Law 23 on Environmental Management (1997).  \n \n14.  The EMS reflects the corporate philosophies of the two principal shareholders, SUEZ \nand Astratel. SUEZ, a member of the United Nations Global Compact and its 10 principles since \n2000,  has  explicit  commitment  to  and  defined  strategic  directions  in  five  priority  areas  in \nsupporting  sustainable  development  objectives:  reflecting  the  values  of  sustainable \ndevelopment in practices and culture, integrating sustainable development in commercial offers \nfor the benefit of customers and users, protecting the environment,31 promoting the social \n                                                 \n30  \u201cPALYJA is committed to the protection of the environment and will employ environmental management systems \nand procedures specifically designed to its business process to prevent activities and/or conditions that pose a \nthreat to (human health, safety) the environment, which includes waste minimization, prevention of pollution, and \nreasonable  efforts  to  comply  with  all  relevant  environmental  legislation  and  regulations.  PALYJA  will  work \ncontinuously to improve the effectiveness of its environmental management; offering customers the most efficient \ntechniques and the best know-how; providing appropriate environmental training and educating employees to be \nenvironmentally responsible on the job and at home; and monitoring environmental performance regularly. All \nprocesses of production and all damage to the environment depend on how individual people work. No matter how \nadvanced the environmental technology is, its result depends on the measure of environmental awareness enjoyed \nby those who operate it.\u201d \n31  The subpriorities are: \u201cmaintain compliance at our sites and manage regulatory changes; measure and control \nenvironmental risks within the Suez Risk Management Policy; minimize the environmental impact of our activities \nover time; expand environmental management systems.\u201d SUEZ, Sustainable Development: Cornerstone of Our \nStrategy - 10 Years of Social Responsibility Initiatives, 2006. \n ", "Appendix 5  35 \ncommitment of SUEZ, acting as a corporate citizen, and ensuring local roots for SUEZ business. \nThe  company  fully  recognizes  accountability  to  its  stakeholders:  financial, 32  social, 33 \ncommercial, 34  and  government. 35  Among  other  notable  initiatives  that  SUEZ  seeks  to \ndisseminate across its operations is gender parity, with a working group whose mandate is to \nreduce gender disparities and support the work of a parity observatory. SUEZ has about 2,000 \nsites certified ISO 14001, ISO 9001 V2000 or EMAS. The Group set up the International Social \nObservatory  in  1998  as  a  forum  to  observe,  analyze,  and  integrate  human  and  social \ndimensions into business decisions.   \n \n15.  Demonstrating a strong and consistent commitment to environmental sensitivity, Astra \nhas evolved from utilizing environment, health, and safety committees in the 1970s to end-of-\npipe approaches in the 1980s, to self-monitoring and the four Cs (commitment, compliance, \ncompetence, and cleaner production) in the 1990s, to its current philosophy of Astra green \ncompany with four pillars: green strategy, green process, green product, and green employees. \nAstra\u2019s corporate philosophy of the green company is one in which management consciously \nemphasizes protection and development of stakeholders\u2019 environment, health, and safety into \nevery business decision, which represents a continuing effort to contribute positively to the \ncommunity and sustainable development. The green company concept has been introduced in \nall Astra-affiliated companies (e.g., automotive, heavy equipment, mining, plantations). Astra \nhas also adopted the triple bottom line36 for sustainable business. Examples of good practice \nhave been (i) in the automotive industry: sand reuse for shell molding, recycling of wastewater \nand materials (cotton gloves, metal wastes, etc.), and utilization of ash for brick manufacture; \nand (ii) in plantations: reduction of pesticides by using biopredators; and training in principles of \nrefine,  reduce,  reuse,  recycle,  recover,  and  retrieve-to-energy.  Currently,  Astra  has  351 \nenvironment officers, 90 safety officers, and 112 health officers.  \n \n2.  Environmental Management37  \n \n16.  Environmental management at PALYJA follows the well-established practices of the \nmajor shareholders. PALYJA has set in place all elements of an acceptable EMS, which is \nessentially carried out through environmental risk auditing, introduced by SUEZ in January 2006 \nas a precursor to its environmental charter.  \n \n17.  Environmental  aspects  of  PALYJA  operations  are  handled  by  the  Operations \nDepartment, while health and safety issues are handled by Corporate Affairs. The dissemination \nof summary environmental reports is the responsibility of the Contract and Planning Department, \nwhich also administers the water for all program. Social and institutional issues related to \ncustomer care and satisfaction, and legal compliance are handled by the Institutional Relations \n                                                 \n32  Shareholders, investors, and financial institutions.  \n33  Trade unions, employees, and residents. \n34  Consumers, local communities, industrial consumers, and suppliers. \n35  International institutions, governments, academic world, media, associations, and nongovernment organizations. \n36  The triple bottom line (3BL) measures the success of a corporation from financial, social/ethical, and environmental \nperformance perspectives. Essentially coined by John Elkington in Elkington, John. 1997. Cannibals with Forks: \nThe Triple Bottom Line of 21st Century Business. Oxford. Capstone Publisher Limited. 3BL has been widely \nadopted globally by firms, government agencies, and nongovernment organizations. However, the concept has its \ndetractors, as in Norman, W. and C.

All departments are directly accountable to the PALYJA \npresident. PALYJA has three environment specialists and four health and safety officers.  \n \n18.  PALYJA fully complies with Indonesian regulations for clean water standards (Decree \nNo. 426/MENKES/PER/IX/90) and drinking water standards for microbiological parameters for \nthe production of water (Decree No. 416/MENKES/PER/IX/90). Although discussions continue \non  PALYJA\u2019s  ability  to  comply  with  the  Regional  Environmental  Management  Agency  DKI \nJakarta (BPLHD Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta) environment policy for sludge discharge or \nwaste storage, the company will comply with the new regulations on drinking water standards to \nbe enforced in Indonesia in 2008. \n \n3.  Environmental Reporting    \n \n19.  Environmental monitoring activities in PALYJA are located primarily in the Production \nand Distribution Division of the Operations Department. The quality assurance and environment \nmanager, who oversees the work of three engineers, is responsible for preparing detailed \nreports, which are then submitted to the environment officer for dissemination. Together with 6-\nmonthly reports, an annual environment and operations performance report is submitted to both \nSUEZ and the Indonesian Ministry of Environment as part of the structured reporting system at \nPALYJA. \n \n20.  Environmental highlights of 2006 included the following: \n \n(i)  Replacement of coagulant used in the water treatment process from aluminum \nsulfate  (AL SO )  to  aluminum  chlorohydrate  (ACH)  to  minimize  sludge \n2 4\nconcentration. The trials indicate that (a) a reduced coagulant dosage with ACH \nup to + 90%; and (b) the pH value of treated water was more stable; the sludge \nvolume reduced (based on Jar Test). Pejompongan II has used ACH for full plant \nscale since January 2006, with the amount of lime reduced from 2,000\u20133,000 \nkilograms (kg)/day to about 400 kg/day. \n(ii)  In April, the Production Engineering Section and Environment Section conducted \na benchmark for Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM)38 Tirta Cisadane Water \nTreatment Plant in Serpong, Tangerang to learn about the reuse technique for \nfilter backwash wastewater. \n(iii)  In May, monitoring of TCLP, 39 LC50,40 and LD5041 was conducted to ensure that \nthe  water  discharge  from  water  treatment  plants  was  not  categorized  as \nhazardous waste.  \n(iv)  In August and September, the Quality Assurance Group evaluated raw water \nsources for the Cilandak and Taman Kota water treatment plants. \n(v)  An investigation was conducted on inappropriate disposal of flammable waste. \n(vi)  In August, trials of hazardous waste transportation were conducted to prepare \nprocedures for PALYJA. \n                                                 \n38  Municipality. \n39  Toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) is designed to determine the mobility of both organic and \ninorganic analyses present in liquid, solid, and multiphasic wastes using USEPA SW-846 Method 113. \n40  Lethal concentration fifty (LC50) is an analysis to identify effluents and receiving waters containing toxic materials \nin acutely toxic concentrations.  \n41  Lethal dose fifty (LD50) is defined as the medium lethal dose of material that is given to test organisms and \nestimated to be lethal to 50% of organisms. \n ", "Appendix 5  37 \n(vii)  In  October  and  November,  respectively,  the  Environmental  Charter  and  the \nPALYJA Minimum Environmental and Community Requirements for Pipelaying \nWorks or Network or Distribution Projects42 were issued. \n(viii)  In  May  2006,  the  Review  of  Technical  Operations  and  Environmental  Due \nDiligence for PALYJA was completed by Sinclair Knight Merz was prepared and \nsubmitted to PALYJA. \n \n4.  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Certification   \n \n21.  PALYJA is working toward ISO 18000 OSHAS certification at the plants. It has already \nobtained ISO 17025 for the laboratory management system and ISO 9001 at Cilandak; it \nexpects to have ISO 9001 at Pejompongan I and II by the end of the year 2007 at the earlest.  \nE.  Water Treatment Plants \n \n1.  Water Treatment Plants \n \n22.  PALYJA operates (i) four water production/treatment plants, including Pejompongan I \nand II (5.6 m3/s); Cilandak South (0.4 m3/s); and Taman Kota (0.2 m3/s);and (ii) more than 5,000 \nkm of primary, secondary, and tertiary water supply networks. \n \n23.  Sixty percent of PALYJA\u2019s water supply is treated at the Pejompongan plants using \nwater sourced from the West Tarum Canal system, which originates from Jatiluhur reservoir, 70 \nkm southeast of Jakarta. The West Tarum Canal system is operated by Perum Jasa Tirta II, a \nstate-owned company. Thirty-four percent of PALYJA\u2019s water supply is purchased as bulk \ntreated water, from Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum (PDAM) Tangerang; the remaining 6% is \nfrom  other  water  surface,  which  is  treated  in  the  company\u2019s  water  treatment  plants  for \ndistribution. \n \n2.  Assessment of Facilities   \n \n24.  Pejompongan I and II, built in 1957 and 1970, respectively, are in good condition, with a \nremaining life of 20\u201330 years. A 2006 study43 pointed out that given that reinforced concrete \nprocess tanks and storage reservoirs are subject to deterioration after many years, studies need \nto be initiated to fully determine their condition. The capacity constraint on Pejompongan I and II \nis the condition of the treated water pipeline. Quality deterioration and quantity reduction of raw \nwater are seen as the biggest risks for PALYJA; hence, continued pressure needs to be put on \nthe Government, particularly the Jakarta local government and surrounding cities,, to regulate \nthe discharge of pollutants into the canal system, with the imposition of stiff penalties and an \neffective enforcement mechanism. The treatment of sludge is unique in PALYJA\u2019s operations. \nFollowing earlier practice, PALYJA is currently discharging sludge from the water treatment \nplants  back  into  the  watercourses,  which  it  recognizes  is  not  consistent  with  global  good \npractice, but it is constrained by the lack of formal national and local government regulations for \ndischarge water from water treatment plants; the current regulations refer only to standards for \nliquid  waste  from  other  industrial groups.44 However,  the  sludge  consists  primarily  of  inert \nmaterials and as currently treated, is of no significant threat to the water quality and quantity in \nthe watercourses. PALYJA is continuing discussions with the Jakarta government to establish \n                                                 \n42  Necessary  steps  and  guidelines  to  ensure  safety  and  environment-friendly  measures  that  will  minimize \nenvironmental problems during construction. \n43  Sinclair Knight Merz, Review of Technical Operating and Environmental Due Diligence for PALYJA, May 2006.  \n44  DKI Jakarta Governor\u2019s Decision No. 582 of 1995 regarding the Utilization and Standard Quality of Rivers and \nStandard Requirement of Liquid Waste in DKI Jakarta, Appendix V.  \n ", "38  Appendix 5 \nnorms for acceptable sludge discharge, and develop regulations for discharge at the treatment \nplants. PALYJA has adopted the following strategy agreed with the local government. It will \n \n(i)  continue to implement cleaner production activities that include reducing sludge \nwith  the  use  of  nonhazardous  chemicals, 45  as  conducted  since  2005  in \nPejompongan 2, and which will be implemented in Pejompongan I in 2007;  \n(ii)  participate regularly in the River Conservation Program coordinated by BPLHD \nDKI Jakarta;  \n(iii)  conduct historical analyses on its water discharge quality, and participate closely \nin discussions carried out by BPLHD DKI on proposed amendments to Daerah \nKhusus Ibukota (DKI) Jakarta governor\u2019s Decision No. 582 of 1995; \n(iv)  adopt water discharge management in the Cilandak water treatment plant as a \npilot project using centrifugation equipment; and \n(v)  conduct a study on sludge utilization for recycling backwash filters for all water \ntreatment plants as part of efforts to reduce the discharge volume, and to work \ntoward a comprehensive solution to the sludge problem.    \n \n25.  The  Mission  visited  Pejompongan  I,  which  it  found  to  be  very  well  managed,  with \nattention to all environmental aspects. The plant was well maintained, with clear management \nprocedures for water treatment, storage, and distribution areas. The concrete storage tanks did \nnot display any visible weakness, although the Mission pointed out that after so many years, a \ndetailed structural study might be in order. Nonetheless, the tanks are cleaned thoroughly every \nyear, and were renovated in 2002. Hazardous materials (chlorine, caustic soda) are stored at \nsecure places, requiring permission and proper apparel for entry; breathing apparatus was sited \nat accessible locations throughout the plant. Testing was done frequently at scheduled monthly \nintervals. Although the water was fully potable at the site, leaks in the distribution pipes could be \nresponsible  for  water contamination;  hence, an  active  leak  detection  and  repair  system is \nmaintained by PALYJA, although pipe laying and rehabilitation is outsourced. The water filters \nare self cleaning every 72 hours. SCADA46 is used to detect variations in pressure across zones, \nthereby identifying potential leaks. Noise was within acceptable levels (World Bank standards) \nat the pumps. The use of higher amount of chlorine at 1 mg/liter is justified due to the long \ndistances covered by the distribution pipes. The Mission noted the presence of waste materials \n(transformers, sheeting, construction materials), but was assured that storage was temporary, \npending collection by a private contractor to an approved site. However, the Mission drew \nattention to the importance of proper disposal of transformer oil, which was mentioned as being \nfree of polychlorinated biphenyl.  \n \nF.  Construction Practices \n \n26.  Recognizing the importance of working with communities in project development and \nimplementation, PALYJA has confirmed its responsibilities to the Ministry of Public Works in the \nEnvironmental  Assessment,  Management  and  Monitoring  Statutory  Obligations. 47 \nEnvironmental and social requirements/responsibilities that the contractors must comply with \nduring construction, particularly pipe-laying works and/or network or distribution projects, are set \nout in Minimum Environmental and Community Requirements.48 \n                                                 \n45  The pH stable aluminum chlorohydrate (ACH), which is finding much greater use in potable water treatment plants \nis being used to replace aluminum sulfate. ACH is expensive, but can be used in lower does than alum, and is \nmore effective in reducing sludge concentration.  \n46  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, a system that collects and centralizes data from various sensors.  \n47 PALYJA. 2006.

In 2006, 828 leaks were detected along 1,103 km. \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \nscheduled to be completed in as little time as possible (3 days). Local residents and businesses \nhad been informed prior to commencement of repairs.  \n \n30.  The second site involved pipe laying in a densely populated low-income area, Kema \nPrasath. The alternative to piped water had either been borewells (lower groundwater levels \nresulted in the water becoming salty) or tankers that charged high rates for a full load. The water \nprovided in those circumstances was not free of contamination. The residents (women) with \nwhom the  Mission spoke were enthusiastic about the availability of clean water, and fully \nagreeable  to  the  charges  that  PALYJA  would  impose  for  connections  and  usage.  The \ncontractors were obliged to complete works quickly to avoid prolonged inconvenience; in the \narea visited, the time taken for trench cut, excavation, sand fill, pipe laying, and earth cover was \nabout 4 hours for every 100 m. The workers at the site were properly equipped, particularly with \nmasks and earplugs for those operating jackhammers.  \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n31.  Review and evaluation of the available documents/information and the conduct of the \nsite visit demonstrate that PALYJA\u2019s current operations have fully taken into consideration the \nenvironment, health, and safety aspects required by ADB within an EMS framework relevant to \nthe water supply sector. Materials and documents, such as Employee Safety Handbook, Health \nand  Safety  at  Work  (SUEZ),  Minimum  Environmental  and  Community  Requirements  for \nPALYJA,  and  Project  and  Environmental  Management  and  Monitoring  Plans  serve  as \nguidelines and procedures that promote staff and contractor awareness of good environmental, \nhealth, and safety management practices. Adequate staff and financial resources are in place, \nwith commitment by PALYJA to increase the effectiveness of its environment management, \nmonitoring, and reporting systems. The ADB mission is satisfied that the framework of an \neffective EMS exists and is capable of producing the ADB-required annual environmental and \nsocial performance report to acceptable standards under the guidance of the quality assurance \nand environment manager. However, ADB has recommended to PALYJA that it formalize and \ninstitutionalize the EMS according to the structure suggested in this appendix.  \n ", " \nFigure A5.1: PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya: Environmental Responsibilities  4\n1\n   \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nPresident Director  ix\n 5\n   \nVice President/ \nDirector \nInternal  Public \nAuditor  Relations \nProcesses  Manager \nCustomer \nCorporate  Contract and   Operations  Technical  Finance  Institutional  Management \nService \nAffairs   Planning  Director  Services  Director  Relations and  Information \nManager \nDirector  Manager    Director    Illegal Connections System \nManager \nPeople  Business  Production and  Institutional \nDevelopment  Improvement  Distribution   Relations  \n Manager  Manager  Manager  Manager \nHuman  Quality Assurance \nWater for All \nResources   and Environment \nManager \n \nManager  Manager \nHealth and \nSafety \nManager \n \n \n ", "42  Appendix 5 \nH.  Framework for the Establishment of an Environmental Management System for PT \nPAM Lyonnaise Jaya \n1.  Introduction \n \n1.  As the concessionaire for water distribution in Western Jakarta, PALYJA is committed to \nensure that its operations will not create adverse environmental and social impacts. In this \nregard,  PALYJA  will  establish  and  effectively  operate  an  appropriate  EMS.  PALYJA  has \ncommitted to developing a structured and detailed EMS based on the following framework, \nwhich comprises the following elements: an overall policy objective for PALYJA, environmental \nassessment processes and procedures consistent with good practices in the water supply \nsector,  formal  organizational  capacity,  training  opportunities,  and  monitoring  and  reporting \nmechanisms.    \n \n2.  The framework is based on an understanding of (i) the extent PALYJA can manage \nenvironmental and social aspects of its business; and (ii) environmental and social impacts of \nwater distribution.  \n \n2.  Environmental Policy Framework \n \n3.  PALYJA will formulate an explicit corporate policy for the environmental and social \nmanagement of its business. The EMS is a tool to ensure that the corporate environmental and \nsocial policy will be efficiently and effectively implemented by all its business units. This section \nproposes a policy statement and guiding principles for implementing the policy as part of the \nnormal conduct of the business.  \n \na.  Policy Statement \n \n4.  The environment policy adopted by PALYJA should \n \n(i)  be relevant to activities; \n(ii)  comply with relevant environmental legislation and standards; \n(iii)  commit to the prevention of pollution; \n(iv)  commit to continual improvement; \n(v)  commit to setting environmental objectives and targets; \n(vi)  be known to employees and public; and \n(vii)  adopt,  wherever  and  whenever  possible,  clean  technologies  in  design, \nconstruction, and operation of water treatment and distribution facilities \n \n    b.  Guiding Principles for Policy Implementation \n \n6.  The  following  guiding  principles  are  suggested  for  implementation  of  PALYJA\u2019s \nenvironmental and social policy: \n \n(i)  PALYJA  will  avoid  any  construction  on  intensively  inhabited  land  or  on \necologically or socially sensitive areas. Examples of such sensitive areas are \ncultural sites and swamp forests. \n(ii)  PALYJA will ensure that the land, if any, provided by the local government have \nno  pending  issues  with  the  former  occupants  related  to  compensation  and \nresettlement assistance. \n ", "Appendix 5  43 \n(iii)  PALYJA  will  review  the  project  environmental  impact  assessment  and  the \nrecommended  environmental  management  system  (EMS)  to  identify  gaps  or \ninadequacies  that  could  undermine  environmental  and  social  integrity  of  the \nproject.  If  such  inadequacies  are  found,  PALYJA  will  initiate  dialogue  with \nrelevant agencies on measures to improve the environmental impact assessment \nand EMS. \n(iv)  PALYJA  will  review  the  detailed  designs  and  specifications  prepared  by  the \nengaged design institutes or firms to ensure that they are environmentally sound \nand fully comply with the EMS. \n(v)  PALYJA will include in the construction contracts appropriate environmental and \nsocial management clauses related to the EMS, and ensure that the contractors \nfully  comply  with  the  environmental  and  social  management  clauses  and \napplicable rules and regulations of the national and local governments.  \n(vi)  PALYJA will fully comply with the monitoring and reporting requirements during \nconstruction as prescribed in the EMS and in compliance with applicable national \nand local laws and regulations. \n(vii)  PALYJA will fully comply with monitoring and reporting requirements during the \noperation  of  project  facilities  as  prescribed  in  the  EMS  in  compliance  with \napplicable national and local laws and regulations. \n(viii)  PALYJA will report on its environmental and social management activities as set \nout in the EMS and as part of its annual reports. \n(ix)  PALYJA will implement an appropriate public information program related to its \nenvironmental and social management activities. \n(x)  PALYJA will continue to be an active partner of the communities in which it \noperates. \n \n3.  EMS Design Framework \n \na.  EMS Elements and Activities \n \n7.  The EMS elements will be in line with the four main tasks of management: Plan, Do, \nCheck, Act. These elements involve different activities during construction and operation of a \nproject.  \n \nb.  Work Processes and Procedures \n \n8.  In setting up the EMS, PALYJA should establish clear work processes and procedures \nor guidelines for all tasks, including   \n   \n(i)  review  of  environmental  impact  assessment,  EMS,  and  detailed  designs \nprepared by the engaged design institutes or firms and approved by the local \ngovernments as necessary; \n(ii)  changes or modifications of the EMS and detailed designs; \n(iii)  review of the environmental and social management plan of the contractors\u2019 \nproposals; \n(iv)  preparation and incorporation of environmental and social management clauses \nin the construction contracts; \n(v)  audit  of  environmental  and  social  management  compliance  during  the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  treatment  plants,  and  rectification  of \nnoncompliance and partial compliance; and \n(vi)  reporting of corporate environmental and social performance. \n ", "44  Appendix 5 \nc.  Organization \n \n9.  PALYJA  should  have  one  designated  manager  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  to  operate  the  EMS,  supported  by  professional  assistants  as  required.  The \nmanager should report directly to the president director. Environmental and social management \nactivities should be carried out as part of routine plant operations. The results of environmental \nand social management should be reviewed, evaluated, and reported separately from those of \nthe normal treatment plant operations. Regular training opportunities should be developed for \nPALYJA  technical,  environment,  and  social  management  staff  to  inform  them  of  required \nenvironment  and  social  management-related  procedures,  recent  developments,  and  good \npractices in the industry to mitigate the environmental impact of PALYJA operations.  \n \nd.  Budgeting \n \n10.  Expenses incurred in environmental and social management at the plant level should be \nincluded in the budget for operation of the treatment plants. Expenses incurred in environmental \nand social management at the corporate level, including training, will be part of the corporate \noverhead expenses.  \n ", "Appendix 6  45 \nLAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Objectives \n1.  The resettlement framework defines the policies, procedures, roles, and responsibilities \nof PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (PALYJA) for screening and managing involuntary resettlement. \nPALYJA prepared the framework as part of its commitment to complying with the safeguard \npolicies of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), in particular the Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995). \n \nB.  Scope of Involuntary Resettlement in PALYJA Operations \n2.  PALYJA is a subsidiary of SUEZ Environment (SUEZ) of France and is one of the \nlargest  water  service  providers  in  Indonesia.  PALYJA  entered  into  a  25-year  cooperation \nagreement with the Government commencing on 1 February 1998. The scope of services under \nthe agreement includes the design, construction, refurbishment, and operation of the water \nsupply system, technical and quality control, human resources and training, financing of new \nworks, and billing and collection. Most of the activities involve upgrading or operating long-\nestablished facilities. These activities will not have involuntary resettlement impacts. \n \n1.  Temporary Disturbance and Mitigation Measures  \n \n3.  Temporary disturbances are caused by the construction of distribution pipelines, for \nwhich  PALYJA  has  established  separate  procedures,  including  (i)  minimizing  community \ndisruption, (ii) assessing relevant utility impact, (iii) cleaning after construction, (iv) controlling \ndrainage and sediment on-site, (v) maintaining traffic, and (vi) controlling noise. \n \n4.  For  consultation,  disclosure,  and  grievances,  PALYJA  manages  its  territory  through \nthree service units. Each unit (south, west, and central) has a dedicated public relations team to \nundertake community meetings/socialization of PALYJA projects. About 2 weeks before the \nproject  starts,  the  team  and  the  contractor  contact  the  head  of  RT&RW,  the  lowest \nadministrative unit in the city, to conduct meetings regarding new projects, network rehabilitation, \nor tariff adjustment. \n \n5.  During the meeting, PALYJA presents information about the project such as time frame, \nobjective, location, and responsibility for project implementation, including the names of the \ncontractor and related units in PALYJA. For complaints when the work is being undertaken, the \ncommunity  may  contact  either  the  contractor  or  related  units  in  PALYJA.  As  most  of  the \npopulation  within  the  community  will  benefit  from  the  new  water  pipelines  by  becoming \ncustomers, they may contact the PALYJA call center after they have connected to the pipelines. \nThe call center provides 24-hour service, records all complaints, and then dispatches them to \nrelated units through an online system. After the complaint is resolved, the related unit will \nprovide feedback to the call center. \n \n2.  Design and Right-of-Way Agreements \n \n6.  In the rare instances where the pipeline has to go through private or commercial land, \nthe PALYJA process includes the following: (i) Prepare a draft design of the pipeline to be \ndiscussed with the landowner. (ii) When the landowner permits PALYJA to pass through the \nland, PALYJA prepares cost estimates for the compensation fee based on the agreement with \nthe landowner. The landowner can negotiate the fee structure until both parties are satisfied \nwith the result. Commercial land usually has its own regulation for land rental, and PALYJA will \n ", "46  Appendix 6 \nfollow that regulation as long as it is reasonable and does not conflict with PALYJA\u2019s own \nregulation. Upon reaching an agreement, PALYJA will prepare a contract for the duration of the \nconcession. (iii) If the landowner will not permit PALYJA to pass through the land, PALYJA will \nseek alternative routes based on considerations for general site condition and hydraulic aspects. \n \n7.  PALYJA will not, to the best of its ability, be involved directly in land acquisition or \nresettlement in its future operations. However, this resettlement framework will set out the \nprocedures, roles, and responsibilities for ensuring that PALYJA fully complies with ADB\u2019s \ninvoluntary  resettlement  safeguard  requirements  in  the  unlikely  event  that  involuntary \nresettlement or land acquisition takes place. \n \n  3.  Definitions \n8.  For the purpose of this framework, the following definitions will apply: \n \n(i)  Involuntary  resettlement  refers  to  social  and  economic  impacts  that  are \npermanent or temporary and are caused by (a) acquisition of land and other fixed \nassets, (b) change in the use of land, or (c) restrictions imposed on land as a \nresult of a PALYJA-funded investment.  \n \n(ii)  Affected person includes any people, households, firms, or private institutions \nwho,  on  account  of  changes  that  result  from  the  project  will  have  their  (a) \nstandard of living adversely affected; (b) right, title, or interest in any house, land \n(including residential, commercial, agricultural, forest, and/or grazing land), water \nresources, or any other moveable or fixed assets acquired, possessed, restricted, \nor otherwise adversely affected, in full or in part, permanently or temporarily; \nand/or (c) business, occupation, place of work or residence, or habitat adversely \naffected, with or without displacement.  \n \n4.  Policy Framework \n9.  PALYJA  will  ensure  that  any  involuntary  resettlement  activities  are  conducted  in \naccordance with the following: \n \n(i)  ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995); and \n(ii)  applicable national and provincial laws and regulations governing land acquisition, \ncompensation and resettlement, and consultation and disclosure of resettlement \ninformation. \n \n10.  The objectives for managing involuntary resettlement impacts are to \n \n(i)  avoid involuntary resettlement wherever feasible,  \n(ii)  minimize resettlement where population displacement is unavoidable, and \n(iii)  ensure that affected persons receive assistance so that they will be at least as \nwell off as they would have been in the absence of the project.  \n \n11.  Resettlement plans will pay particular attention to addressing the needs of the poorest \naffected people and vulnerable groups that may be at high risk of impoverishment. \n \n12.  Presidential decree (Keppres) No. 55/19932 on Land Acquisition specifies grievance \nprocedures  for  landowners;  defines  \"public  interest\"  for  development  purposes;  separates \n ", "Appendix 6  47 \nprivate  projects  that  should  use  regular  land  purchase  arrangements;  places  increased \nemphasis on community consultation and reaching agreement with people affected regarding \nthe  form  and  amount  of  compensation;  and  presents  options  for  compensation  including \nsubstitute land, resettlement, and cash. The Regulation of the State Minister of Agrarian Affairs \nand  National  Land  Agency  No.  1  of  1994  specifies  that  each  provincial  governor  should \nestablish  a  land  acquisition  committee  (Panitia  Pengadaan  Tanah)  in  each  kabupaten \n(regency/district)  and  kota  (municipality)  to  be  chaired  by  the  bupati  or  walikota,  and \ncompensate  people  using  land  without  any  title  (Art.  20).  The  land  acquisition  committee \nincludes representatives of the level II land office, tax office, public works agency, agriculture \nagency, heads of the subdistrict and villages where land acquisition will take place, and two \nadditional members. Compensation is provided at the same replacement rates to all people \naffected including holders of hak adapt or ulayat (customary rights), and to long-term squatters \non government land. Table A6.1 provides a comparison of ADB and Indonesian regulations.   \n \n5.  Screening for Involuntary Resettlement Impacts \n13.  For any planned investment activities, PALYJA\u2019s senior officer (para. 19) responsible for \nsocial and resettlement performance will determine and seek consent from ADB on whether any \nactivities  to  be  undertaken  (i)  have  historically  involved  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement; or (ii) may involve future involuntary resettlement.  \n \n    a.  Activities with No Involuntary Resettlement Impact \n \n14.  Where no involuntary resettlement impacts are indicated, no action with regard to this \nresettlement framework will be required. \n \n    b.  Activities with Historical Involuntary Resettlement Impacts \n \n15.  In case of land acquisition or involuntary resettlement50 prior to PALYJA\u2019s involvement, \nPALYJA\u2019s  senior  officer  responsible  for social  and  resettlement  performance  will  ensure  a \nresettlement due diligence report is prepared. The report should provide (i) a brief history of site \nland acquisition and resettlement, and parties responsible for implementation; (ii) details of \naffected land, population, and assets; (iii) assessment of outcomes with respect to restoration of \nstandards  of  living  and  livelihood;  and  (iv)  information  on  any  outstanding  resettlement \ngrievances or related areas of reputation risk. It should state if a resettlement plan is required to \ndefine actions to achieve compliance with ADB\u2019s resettlement requirements. \n \n    c.  Activities with Planned Involuntary Resettlement \n \n16.  In the event that any activities may involve involuntary resettlement, PALYJA\u2019s senior \nofficer responsible for social and resettlement performance will \n \n(i)  assess the magnitude of resettlement, and in consultation with ADB, determine \nwhether a short or full resettlement plan is required; \n(ii)  review relevant ADB policies and guidelines; \n(iii)  ensure that resettlement information is disclosed to those affected in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements;  \n(iv)  submit the draft resettlement plan to ADB for review and approval; \n                                                 \n50  Historical impacts for which resettlement due diligence will be required will be limited to projects for which land \nacquisition or relocation of people (whichever occurred most recently) occurred less than 3 years ago. \n ", "48  Appendix 6 \n(v)  oversee any revisions required by ADB to finalize the resettlement plan; \n(vi)   verify local disclosure of the final resettlement plan; \n(vii)   submit  the  final  resettlement  plan  for  website  disclosure  and  ADB  Board \napproval; \n(viii)  confirm ADB Board approval before proceeding with the investment \n(ix)  monitor implementation of the resettlement plan; and \n(x)  prepare  and  circulate  monitoring  reports  as  required  under  the  approved \nresettlement plan. \n \nd.  Resettlement Plans \n \n17.  Where necessary, PALYJA will prepare a short or full resettlement plan, depending on \nthe magnitude and complexity of resettlement. A full resettlement plan will be required when \ninvoluntary resettlement is \u201csignificant,\u201d i.e., when 200 or more people will experience major \nimpacts. This is defined as (i) being physically displaced from housing, or (ii) losing 10% or \nmore  of  productive  assets  (income  generating).  The  terms  of  reference  for  drafting  the \nresettlement plan are presented in paras. 22\u201341. \n \n18.  An entitlement matrix summarizing the compensation and entitlement policy is shown in \nTable A6.2. \n \n4.  Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievance Redress \n19.  Each resettlement plan will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with \nthose affected, and involve surveys and community meetings. Plans in the Bahasa language will \nbe made available to the public through postings in public places for reasonable periods of at \nleast 4 months prior to actual land acquisition. ADB will review and approve the resettlement \nplans as they are prepared, and once finalized will disclose them on its website. Complaints and \ngrievance procedures acceptable to ADB will be established in each resettlement plan.  \n \n5.  Reporting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n20.  PALYJA will nominate an experienced senior officer to be responsible for social and \nresettlement performance. The senior officer will be placed in the Operations Department and \nreport  directly  to  the  president.  The  officer  will  be  responsible  for  social  and  resettlement \nperformance,  specifically  in  (i)  screening  projects  for  involuntary  resettlement  impacts;  (ii) \nfamiliarize with ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement procedures and requirements; (iii) monitoring \nresettlement; and, (iv) reporting.  \n \n21.  PALYJA  will  submit  an  annual  report  of  performance  monitoring  against  safeguard \npolicies, and upon and after project completion.  \n ", " \nTable A6.1: Comparison of ADB and Indonesian Regulations \nNo  Category  ADB Policy  Perpres 36/2005  Keppres 55/1993 \n1.

Introduction \n1.  The Project is to improve water supply services to existing customers and extend water \nsupply to new customers in West Jakarta. PT PAM Lyonnaise Jaya (PALYJA) has a 25-year \nconcession to produce and supply clean water in West Jakarta until 2022. The economic \nanalysis examines the economic viability of the Project, following Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) guidelines: Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and Handbook for the \nEconomic Analysis of Water Supply Projects. The analysis draws on information obtained from \ngovernment agencies, the project developer, the water supply master plan, and other available \nsecondary data.  \n \nB.  Project Rationale and Description \n2.  In Indonesia only about 40 million people, or 18% of the population, are connected to \npiped water supply. In urban areas, only 39% of the population receives piped water. The \nremaining urban population depends on individual wells, small-scale providers, or water vendors, \noften at high cost.51 Due to lack of enforcement of regulation on water discharges, groundwater \nquality  has  deteriorated  over  time.  Piped  water  supply  provided  by  utilities  is  clean  and \nsustainable, as water quality is maintained through treatment prior to distribution and constant \nmonitoring. The operations and quality control in such utilities are easier to regulate than that of \nsupply from ground wells and water vendors in the informal sector.  \n \n3.  Access to water supply in Jakarta (8.5 million inhabitants) is ensured through three \nalternatives:  \n \n(i)  55% piped water\u20144.7 million people \n(ii)  30% shallow and deep wells\u20142.5 million people  \n(iii)  15% water vendors\u20141.3 million people  \n \n4.  However, overexploitation of the aquifer through groundwater extraction is resulting in \nsubsidence.  In  addition  to  increasing  salt  water  intrusion,  chemical  and  microbiological \npollutants make the groundwater unfit for human use and consumption. Research undertaken \nby the Ministry of Environment indicates that 65% of groundwater in Jakarta is unsuitable for \nhuman use because of negative health impacts (for example, contaminated and untreated \ngroundwater leads to several waterborne diseases such as diarrhea, typhus, cholera, and \nhepatitis A; and contamination from chemical substances, such as insecticide, can lead to \ncarcinogenic ailments. As a result, clean water has to be bought from informal water street \nvendors at prices that are several times the cost of piped water supply.52 \n \n5.  The land subsidence is also making the area prone to floods. Unfortunately, the flood-\nprone area is inhabited by low-income households. The Jakarta Mining Department will control \nfurther exploitation of groundwater in order to abate aggravated land subsidence. Groundwater \nis not therefore, an economically viable water supply option. The other alternative of purchasing \nwater from vendors is a very expensive. Therefore, extension and improvement of the piped \nwater distribution network is the least cost option for Jakarta. \n \n                                                 \n51  In rural areas, only about 15% of households receive drinking water from pipe or pump sources. \n52  A 20 liter can of water costs Rp500, which is equivalent to Rp25,000/cubic meter. Piped water tariffs range from \nRp1,050/cubic meter (low-income households) to Rp9,693/cubic meter (small commercial establishments). \n ", "60  Appendix 8       \n6.  In  1997  when  PALYJA  obtained  the  concession  for  West  Jakarta,  water  supply \ninfrastructure was characterized by old and rusted pipes, bad connections, damaged valves, \nand decreased water pressure. The service coverage ratio was 32% and unaccounted for water \nwas around 57%, due to illegal connections, physical losses, and meter tampering. In 2006, the \nservice ratio increased to 55%. Water losses were reduced by 15% to 42% in 2003. However, \ndue to lack of adequate investments, losses increased to 47.6% (23.8% physical losses, and \n23.8% commercial losses) in 2006. Additional investments are required to reduce losses and \nincrease the coverage ratio. The Project will invest in PALYJA\u2019s concession area to upgrade the \nproduction facilities; reinforce, rehabilitate, and extend the existing distribution network; reduce \nwater losses; and rehabilitate existing connections and implement new ones. The investments \nundertaken during 2008\u20132012 will add 66,000 new customers and reduce water losses to 31% \n(19% physical losses and 12% commercial losses). \n \nC.  Economic Analysis \n1.  Demand for Water \n7.  On average, a customer demands 30 cubic meters of water per month when connected \nto the water network. With limited water available from the network, demand is restricted to a \nfraction (estimated to be about 10%\u201320%) of this, due to the very high cost of alternative \nsources, especially for low-income households. PALYJA projects that with the envisaged project \ninvestments, the number of customers will reach 452,230 by 2012, an increase of 66,000 \ncompared to 2007 figures. In developing future customers, PALYJA is sensitive to providing \nservices  for  low-income  customers,  ensuring  that  low-income  areas  are  given  priority  for \nestablishing new distribution networks and connections. Further, the water tariffs approved by \nthe governor of Jakarta are set such that social and low-income customers pay less for water \nthan high-income individuals and business entities. As a result, the number of low-income \ncustomers increased by 480% as compared with the 50% increase of middle- and upper-income \ncustomers since the beginning of the concession. The Jakarta government adjusts tariffs and \ncross-subsidizes various consumer categories to ensure that the average tariff is greater than or \nequal to the water charge paid to PALYJA. \n \n2.  Supply of Water \n8.  Jakarta\u2019s raw water supply mostly comes from surface water, of which 80% comes from \nthe  Citarum  River,  located  east  of  Jakarta.  The  water  is  managed  through  several  dams, \nincluding the Saguling, Cirata, and Jatiluhur dams. These dams are also used for electric power \ngeneration, river flow management, irrigation, tourism, and industrial purposes. The water is \nchanneled  for  distribution  through  the  West  Tarum  Canal.  Another  15%  comes  from  the \nCisadane River, located west of Jakarta, and the remaining 5% from smaller rivers flowing from \nWest Java Province to the Jakarta area, such as the Ciliwung, Krukut, and Pesanggarahan \nrivers. An increase in the water supply for urban use through the Project is not likely to impact \nother  water  uses  if  proper  measures  are  employed  to  reduce  wastage  and  improve  the \nefficiency  of  the  West  Tarum  Canal.  This  is  being  addressed  by  the  proposed  Integrated \nCitarum Water Resource Management Project from ADB public sector operations. \n \n3.  Economic Benefits and Cost Valuation \n9.  In the without-project scenario, 80%\u201390% of the demand is not met due to supply \nconstraints  and  the  very  high  price  of  alternatives.  In  the  with-project  scenario,  the  main \nquantifiable benefits are the increased supply of water and reduced physical losses of water. \n ", "Appendix 8  61 \nWithout  the  project,  demand  is  constrained  by  the  high  price  of  alternatives.  Most  of  the \nadditional  (new)  water  supply  is  therefore  incremental  and  the  benefits  are  valued  at  the \ncustomers\u2019  willingness  to  pay,  which  is  measured  by  the  water  charge.  The  only  viable \nalternative is vendor supplied water, which is expensive and thus demand is suppressed to only \n10%. Therefore, only 10% of the additional volume of water sold is treated as nonincremental \nand valued at its opportunity cost. Commercial losses are valued at the water charge. \n \n10.  The economic analysis uses economic prices, with financial prices adjusted to net out \ntransfer payments including taxes, duties, or subsidies, and corrected for any other market \ndistortions. The following assumptions are used: \n \n(i)  The project analysis is done in constant 2007 prices.  \n(ii)  The economic life of the Project is assumed to be until the end of the concession in \n2022. The project investments will be implemented over 5 years from 2008 to 2012. \nNo  residual  values  are  assumed  in  2022,  making  the  analysis  a  conservative \nestimation of net benefits. \n(iii)  The capital and operation and maintenance costs were apportioned into traded and \nnontraded components.  \n(iv)  Using the domestic price numeraire, financial prices as reduced by duties and taxes \nwere converted to economic prices by a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.1 for the \ntraded cost component and 1.0 for the nontraded cost component.  \n(v)  A conversion factor of 0.95 is used for the cost of unskilled labor to reflect the real \nmarket value of labor, based on the relationship between the minimum wage and \nreported actual rates received by unskilled workers in Jakarta.  \n(vi)  Electricity  prices  are  not  adjusted  as  electricity  is  supplied  to  the  Project  at \ncommercial rates, which reflect the cost of generation, transmission, and distribution.  \n(vii)  Operation and maintenance costs are split into fixed (equipment and parts and \nskilled labor) and variable (chemicals, electricity, bulk/raw water) costs. Table A8.1 \nsummarizes the economic costs for the Project. \n \n11.  Table  A8.2  provides  details  on  the  increase  in  water  supply  due  to  the  project \ninvestments, and the physical and commercial losses during water supply. In the economic \nanalysis, the commercial losses of water are included in the calculation of the economic rate of \nreturn (EIRR). The EIRR for the base case is 58.5%.  \n \n12.  The Project will also result in the following indirect benefits: (i) reduction in the extraction \nof groundwater thereby contributing to the control of further land subsidence; and (ii) reduction \nin the incidence of waterborne diseases, especially among the poor, made possible through the \nsupply of clean water. These benefits have not been valued, but their inclusion will increase the \nProject\u2019s EIRR.  \n \n4.  Sensitivity Analysis \n13.  An analysis was undertaken to test the sensitivity of the estimated EIRR of the Project to \nadverse  changes  in  key  variables  and  to  confirm  its  economic  viability  under  unfavorable \nconditions. For purposes of the analysis, three major risks are considered: (i) an increase of \n10% in the capital and O&M costs, (ii) a 10% decrease in revenue, and (iii) underachievement \nof physical loss reduction by 50% of that originally planned. A scenario was also run with a \ncombination of all the three risk factors. Table A8.3 shows the EIRR under different scenarios; \nin all cases the EIRR is above 30%. \n \n ", "62       \nTable A8.1: Project Costs   6\n2\n(Rp million)   \n    O&M costs   \nEquipment  A\np\nand  Direct  Indirect  RW and  Customer  Total  p\ne\nYear  Investment  Spares  Labor  Labor  Electricity  Chemical  BW  Service  Other  Total O&M  Cost  nd\nix\n                         8\n \n2008  173,196    6,740  5,197  2,661  2,730  14,696  2,265  9,366  43,655  238,536 \n2009  173,709    11,520  8,884  4,808  5,009  25,855  4,105  16,695  76,876  275,644 \n2010  173,414    13,078  10,085  5,566  5,793  29,982  4,919  19,522  88,946  288,596 \n2011  184,828    14,786  11,402  6,361  6,641  34,071  5,740  22,336  101,336  314,781 \n2012  172,737    16,181  12,478  7,013  7,334  37,452  6,479  24,657  111,594  312,764 \n2013    27,085  17,452  13,457  7,613  7,972  40,564  7,185  25,573  146,902  161,592 \n2014    27,264  18,729  14,443  8,233  8,637  43,730  7,908  27,781  156,725  172,397 \n2015    27,329  20,016  15,435  8,876  9,332  46,957  8,645  30,053  166,643  183,308 \n2016    26,674  20,828  16,062  9,257  9,726  49,024  9,171  31,570  172,311  189,542 \n2017    25,910  21,570  16,634  9,595  10,070  50,923  9,669  32,912  177,283  195,012 \n2018    24,938  22,134  17,068  9,832  10,295  52,384  10,100  30,211  176,963  194,660 \n2019    23,953  22,665  17,478  10,051  10,502  53,772  10,526  31,156  180,103  198,113 \n2020    21,797  23,145  17,848  10,244  10,676  55,043  10,938  32,040  181,730  199,902 \n2021    20,725  23,461  18,092  10,338  10,736  55,899  11,281  32,685  183,217  201,538 \n2022    19,675  23,745  18,310  10,415  10,775  56,680  11,603  33,120  184,323  202,755 \nRW and BW = raw water and bulk water, O&M = operations and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", " \nTable A8.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \nTotal New  Physical  Commercial  Total  Total Water  Water  Vendor  Total \nYear  Demand  Losses  losses  Losses  Consumed  Charge  Price  Benefits  Net Benefits \n  million m3  million m3  million m3  million m3  million m3  Rp/m3  Rp/ m3  Rp million  Rp million \n2008  10.7  4.6  4.6  9.1  15.2  6,882  25,000  124,217  (88,132) \n2009  19.9  8.1  7.9  15.9  27.8  6,882  25,000  227,144  (15,668) \n2010  23.7  9.1  8.7  17.9  32.4  6,882  25,000  266,101  12,555 \n2011  27.6  10.2  9.8  20.0  37.4  6,882  25,000  307,264  30,935 \n2012  31.0  11.0  10.5  21.6  41.6  6,882  25,000  342,304  68,578 \n2013  34.3  11.7  11.2  22.9  45.5  6,882  25,000  375,462  242,218 \n2014  37.9  12.4  11.8  24.2  49.6  6,882  25,000  410,235  267,758 \n2015  41.6  13.1  12.4  25.5  54.0  6,882  25,000  446,783  294,944 \n2016  44.2  13.3  12.6  25.9  56.8  6,882  25,000  470,684  313,322 \n2017  46.5  13.8  12.3  26.2  58.8  6,882  25,000  489,210  327,307 \n2018  48.4  14.1  11.9  26.1  60.3  6,882  25,000  502,611  341,001 \n2019  50.2  14.5  11.4  25.9  61.6  6,882  25,000  515,234  350,757 \n2020  52.0  14.7  10.9  25.6  62.8  6,882  25,000  526,505  360,542 \n2021  53.2  14.9  10.2  25.0  63.4  6,882  25,000  532,767  365,446 \n2022  54.4  15.0  9.5  24.4  63.9  6,882  25,000  538,153  369,821 \n                EIRR  58.5% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, m3 = cubic meter, Rp = rupee. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 8\n \n6\n3\n \n ", "64       \nTable A8.3: Sensitivity Analysis of Economic Internal Rate of Return \nSensitivity Parameter  Percentage Change  EIRR (%) \nBase Case    58.5 \n(i)  Increase in capital and O&M costs  +10  44.9 \n(ii)  Decrease in revenue  -10  46.7 \n(iii)  Underachievement of physical loss reduction  -50  53.1 \n(iv)  Combination of (i)\u2013(iii)    32.7 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n14.  The economic analysis and sensitivity analysis confirm that the Project is sustainable \nwith a base case EIRR of 58.5%. The Project is justifiable in economic terms. \n \nD.  Distribution of Project Benefits \n15.  An  assessment  by  an  independent  regulatory  body  established  in  2001  to  monitor \nimplementation of the concession agreement shows that in Jakarta\u2019s low-income areas poor \npeople are currently spending a significant share of their household budget to buy water from \ninformal vendors, this price is far greater that what they would pay once connected to the \nnetwork. The Project will directly benefit more than 66,000 households, with a high proportion in \nthe lower income categories. The Project will have a marginal impact on employment generation, \nwhich is limited to workers (skilled and unskilled) employed for the expansion of the distribution \nnetwork.  \n \n16.  Project benefits will accrue to the project developers and all categories of consumers in \nterms of lower priced water supply that is more reliable and cleaner than the alternatives. \nFurther given the tariff structure adopted by the Jakarta government, the poor consumers are \ncross-subsidized by the higher income category consumers. However, the higher prices paid for \npiped water by the higher income category is lower than those paid for alternative sources. The \nvendors of water will be adversely affected by the Project as they will lose part of their business. \nAs only a few vendors are reaping supernormal rents in the without-project scenario, the gains \nby a multitude of consumers not only in terms of access to less expensive water supply but also \nlower health expenditure and overall well-being exceed the loss for the vendors.   \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070925113207+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20070924114018+08'00'", "Title": "West Jakarta Water Supply Development Project", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "PL4", "Keywords": "rrp:indonesia 41913, asian development bank,west jakarta water supply, water development project, water resource management", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0.5 (Windows)"}}
