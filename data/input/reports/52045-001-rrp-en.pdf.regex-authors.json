THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Tashkent Province Sewerage Improvement Project. The report \nalso describes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the \nSpanish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance and the Republic of Korea e-Asia and \nKnowledge Partnership Fund for Institutional Capacity Support for Modern Utility Management, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the TA. \n2.  The project takes an integrated approach to improving the access to and reliability of water \nsupply and sanitation (WSS) services in Tashkent Province; and will strengthen climate resilience, \ngender equality, and environmental sustainability for a green and inclusive recovery after the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic.  It  will  achieve  this  by  (i)  enhancing  sewerage \ncoverage in cities; (ii) improving decentralized sanitation in rural areas; (iii) installing production \nand consumption water meters; (iv) supporting comprehensive capacity building of the Tashkent \nSuvtaminot (TST), the provincial WSS utility; (v) preventing the spread of COVID-19 through \ngender-friendly awareness campaigns for water, sanitation, hygiene, and health (WASH+H) \nmeasures; and (vi) engaging civil society for broad citizen participation. \nII.  THE PROJECT  \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Macroeconomic situation and COVID-19 recovery. Uzbekistan is a lower middle-\nincome country and one of Central Asia\u2019s fastest-growing economies, achieving a consistent \nannual growth rate of 4%\u20136%, with real gross domestic product (GDP) increasing from 4.4% in \n2017 to 5.4% in 2018 and expanding to 5.8% in 2019.1 The Government of Uzbekistan is \nundertaking  structural  reforms focused  on  economic  diversification,  attracting  foreign  direct \ninvestment, and balancing urban and rural development. While GDP growth in 2020 decreased \nsharply to 1.6% because of COVID-19 impacts, it is projected to increase by 5.0% in 2021 and \n5.3% in 2022.2 About 448,000 or 1.3% of the population are estimated to have fallen into poverty \nbecause of the COVID-19 crisis, despite the government\u2019s substantial measures to boost health \nspending and support households and firms.3 The COVID-19 impacts to public health are \nexacerbated by limited WSS services and poor sanitation. \n4.  Investment in WSS services is an essential part of the government\u2019s development and \nCOVID-19 recovery strategy.4 Less than 20% of the population has access to adequate WSS \nservices, and the country has an estimated WSS infrastructure deficit of $2.9 billion.5 Despite \nrecent investments by international financial institutions, large gaps remain to be able to upgrade \nthe country\u2019s legacy WSS infrastructure. This has resulted in environmental and public health \nrisks undermining livability and constraining the country\u2019s economic potential. \n \n \n1  World Bank.

Tashkent Province is the country\u2019 economic engine, generating almost 25% \nof the country\u2019s GDP. It is the largest urban agglomeration, with 3.1 million people spread across \n7 cities, 14 districts, 97 semi-urbanized settlements, and 885 rural settlements. \n6.  Key issues. Despite its strong economic potential, Tashkent Province is hindered by \npervasive limitations in sanitation coverage and services, aggravated by an increasing urban \npopulation. Only 17% of the province\u2019s population is connected to sewerage systems, while the \nremaining 83% rely on pit latrines and earth ditches\u2014practices that threaten public health and \nenvironmental quality.6 The sewerage system in the urban areas has not expanded since 1991, \nresulting in a service coverage of only 35%. The wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and \nnetworks are no longer functional. Rural settlements have no wastewater services. As a result, \nmassive quantities of untreated wastewater (up to 80% of the total volume) are discharged to the \nenvironment. Water quality in the province is deteriorating, and pollution levels exceed national \nstandards. This is compounded by the decline in river flows caused by climate change. In addition, \nthe expected rise in temperature will increase stress on materials and biological treatments. Key \nissues include limited operation and maintenance (O&M) capacity, an unattractive environment \nfor private sector participation, and low metering and tariff levels.7 Water supply losses, estimated \nat 38%, are difficult to verify because of limited water metering. The wastewater tariff is below \ncost recovery levels, hindering O&M and service delivery.8 \n7.  Institutional performance and reforms. Since its reorganization in 2016, TST and its \n2,770 staff\u2014serving about 340,600 water supply and 170,000 sewerage connections\u2014have \nimplemented a series of reforms addressing critical needs. Two ongoing water supply projects \nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have helped support these reforms in the \nprovince.9  These  include  consolidated  smaller  water  supply  systems,  strengthened  public \naccountability, modernized management systems, expanded coverage, increased tariffs, and \nimproved staffing. However, TST\u2019s operational performance still lags in corporate management, \ncustomer  service  standards,  industrial  sewer  inspection,  nonrevenue  water  management, \noutsourcing contracts, and wastewater management. Smart water management solutions, such \nas information and communication technology, geographic information systems, smart water \nmetering, supervisory control and data acquisition systems, and geographic information system-\nbased data for asset management and O&M, will improve its operational capacity. A clear \ninstitutional road map is needed to guide TST\u2019s medium- to long-term corporate development for \noptimal and sustainable service delivery to customers.  \n8.  In November 2019, the government formed a national water agency\u2014Uzsuvtaminot Joint \nStock Company (UJSC)\u2014to strengthen WSS. The suvokovas (provincial utilities), including TST, \nunder the Ministry of Housing and Communal Services, have been transferred to UJSC.10 This \nreform is expected to enable private sector participation and improve efficiencies. UJSC is the \nparent company for all suvokovas, responsible for tariff collection, sector planning, and the \n \n6  TST and Ministry of Health data show increasing trends of viral hepatitis and intestinal diseases in the project areas. \n7  About 50% of customers are charged based on metered readings, and the rest are charged at a flat rate. \n8  Water and wastewater tariffs are combined in monthly billings following the Cabinet of Ministers No. 309 dated \n13 April 2019 on measures for the enhancement of regulated prices (rates) for water supply and sewerage services. \nTariffs for non-metered connections are based on household size and liters per capita. \n9  ADB. 2016.

This is \nexpected to improve the performance of ADB-funded projects because of its strong coordination \nwith suvokovas. The ADB project coordination unit (PCU), which implements ongoing ADB- \nfinanced projects, has been transferred to UJSC management.12 \n9.  ADB\u2019s phased investment approach in Tashkent Province. ADB is implementing two \nWSS improvement projects in the province (footnote 9). The first, approved in 2016, aims to \nincrease access to piped drinking water from 20% of the rural population in two districts to 100% \nby 2023. The second, approved in 2019, aims to (i) expand water supply for rural populations \nfrom less than 20% to 100% in two more districts, and (ii) address rural sanitation needs by \nproviding septic tanks in selected rural settlements. The project will complement these ongoing \nprojects to fill essential sanitation infrastructure and service gaps and  to strengthen TST\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity in WSS services.13  \n10.  Strategic alignment. The project is aligned with Uzbekistan\u2019s national development \nstrategy, 2017\u20132021 for inclusive and sustainable growth and access to basic urban services.14 It \nalso supports government decrees on WSS and ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020.15 \nThe project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023, which \naims to bridge the gap between rural and urban development.16 It is also aligned with ADB's \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities.17 \n11.  Development partner coordination. ADB is the lead WSS development partner in \nUzbekistan. The World Bank and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation are \ninvolved in WSS projects in Tashkent Province. The Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, the \nAsian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank are also involved in \nWSS. Close coordination in sector investments and policy dialogue is regularly practiced. \n12.  Lessons. Key lessons from ongoing and past ADB-financed WSS projects in the country \ninclude the need for (i) engaging the private sector in O&M with transfer of skills, (ii) providing \ninstitutional capacity support for sustainability, (iii) installing sewer connections, (iv) achieving high \nprocurement readiness using project readiness financing (PRF), and (v) encouraging long-term \npolicy dialogue and partnership for strategic investments to achieve sustainable outcomes.18 \nB.

Implementation Arrangements \n22.  UJSC will be the executing agency for the project. It is a  national water company \nresponsible for WSS services nationwide and implements projects funded by development \npartners  through  its  PCU.  The  PCU,  which  is  experienced  in  implementing  projects,31  is \nresponsible  for  procurement,  contract  management,  financial  management,  safeguard \ncompliance, and reporting, among other administrative tasks. The TST will be the implementing \nagency for the project, operating under UJSC. It will be (i) the employer in all contracts, (ii) the \nowner of all project facilities, (iii) the holder of the advance account, and (iv) the responsible \nagency for preparing project and entity financial statements.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n23.  The attached TA will support TST in implementing institutional reforms and capacity-\nbuilding programs following its institutional development road map.32 The TA is estimated to cost \n$800,000, of which (i) $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis by Spanish Cooperation Fund \nfor Technical Assistance; and (ii) $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis by Republic of Korea \ne-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, both to be administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and office accommodation. ADB will \nbe responsible for facilitating implementation and supervision of the TA.  \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  Technical due diligence found the project design robust based on a comprehensive review \nof the feasibility study, cost estimates, and site investigations. The project was appraised based \non (i) rationale and relevance, benefits, and ease of implementation and operations; (ii) technical \nalternatives, including WWTP technology and decentralized services;33 (iii) least-cost options, \nincluding capital and operating costs, and achievable cost savings through energy efficiency, \nrenewable energy, and climate-resilient measures; (iv) maximizing beneficiary area coverage, \nincluding unserved rural areas; (v) minimizing adverse environmental and social impacts; and \n(vi) optimizing implementation timelines through high project readiness such as early mobilization \nof detailed design consultants using PRF. A design\u2013build contract modality will support TST with \na 2-year operation and training period for its capacity building, in addition to institutional support \n \n32 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Conventional secondary activated sludge with two-stage clarifiers and chlorination is recommended, but the final \ntechnology will be recommended by the design\u2013build contractor to meet national standards. \n \n ", "8 \nunder Output 2.  \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n25.  Economic analysis. The quantified economic benefits of the project are mainly derived \nfrom two sources: (i) the public health benefits ensuing from being able to access cleaner, safer \nwater  in  the  project  area;  and  (ii)  the  global  warming  damages  avoided  through  reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions from the project\u2019s climate-resilient and energy-efficient features. The \nresulting base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 11.43% for the centralized urban \nwastewater systems and 12.78% for the decentralized rural wastewater disposal systems. The \noverall project EIRR is 11.93%. These results confirm that the project is economically viable, \nexceeding ADB\u2019s minimum discount rate of 9%. Sensitivity analysis determined that the project \nEIRRs will remain robust under the following scenarios: (i) a 10% increase in investment costs \narising from delayed implementation or higher-than-expected inflation; (ii) a 10% increase in O&M \ncosts resulting from higher-than-budgeted personnel salaries and other costs; (iii) a 10% decline \nin benefits resulting from lower-than-projected public health and greenhouse gas reduction \nbenefits; (iv) a combination of (i), (ii), and (iii); and (v) a delay in project benefits by a year. \n26.  Financial analysis. The financial internal rate of return is 1.58%, which exceeds the \nestimated weighted average cost of capital of 1.44%. Sensitivity analysis shows that financial \nviability will be at risk if a 10% increase in capital costs and a 10% decrease in benefits are \ncombined simultaneously with a 1-year delay in increasing wastewater tariffs. To generate a \npositive financial internal rate of return, tariffs would need to be increased by about 27.5% in real \nterms, starting from 2023. Nominally, this means increasing the tariff for residential users from the \ncurrent SUM700 per m3 to SUM1,850 per m3 by 2026. ADB has discussed the proposed increase \nwith the Ministry of Finance and TST, and both have agreed that the rate is reasonable. The \ncombined  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  would  be  affordable  to  the  targeted  household \nbeneficiaries, who have expressed a willingness to pay SUM1,975 per m3 (metered households)34 \nand  SUM3,442  per  m3  (non-metered  households)  for  improved  sanitation  services.  The \ngovernment will support TST\u2019s debt servicing, including the foreign exchange risk and tariff \nreforms. TST will be responsible for the O&M of the assets created by the project. Operating loan \ncovenants have been formulated and agreed to ensure that TST\u2019s financial performance is \nstrengthened, enabling it to use the ADB loan proceeds effectively and efficiently, and to meet \nthe project\u2019s O&M requirements. The financial analysis indicates that TST\u2019s projected operating \nratios, liquidity indicators, and debt servicing coverage ratios will meet the agreed loan covenants. \nC.  Sustainability \n27.  The project supports sustainability through an integrated and inclusive approach, with \nrobust technical design and institutional development. Physical investments are based on realistic \nand long-term demand projections, least-cost options, and modern design principles to ensure \ncost-effective,  climate-resilient  investments  with  positive  environmental  and  public  health \nbenefits. The operational sustainability of new assets is supported by stronger O&M plans; \nadequate budget allocations; enhanced training, particularly for TST\u2019s operators; strengthening \nof an existing training center; and pilot-testing of private sector engagement for the O&M of the \nWWTPs using a performance-based contract after the completion of a design\u2013build contract, with \ntransfer of skills to TST. This gradual public-private partnership initiative approach will help build \nexpertise and confidence in the engagement of the private sector. The financial sustainability of \nthe investments is supported by improved revenues and reduced operations costs. Recent sector \nreforms, including the creation of the UJSC as the asset owner, will strengthen the utility\u2019s \n \n34 Based on average water consumption of 32 liters per capita per day (according to survey results). \n \n ", "9 \nperformance for sustainable operations (para. 8). The project will establish a strong environmental \nmonitoring program to ensure that wastewater discharged to rivers and groundwater complies \nwith ecological standards. \nD.  Governance \n28.  TST, now a subsidiary of UJSC for WSS, was established and registered as a limited \nliability company in 2015 and became a state-owned enterprise in 2016. It is responsible for all \nWSS services in Tashkent Province. \n29.  Financial management. The financial management risk rating of TST is substantial but \nis expected to be moderate after its staff gain experience and receive training under the two \nongoing ADB-financed water supply projects (footnote 9). The main reasons are that (i) TST is in \nthe early stage of implementing its first two ADB-financed projects and has limited experience as \nan  implementing  agency;  and  (ii)  adjustments  are  necessary  to  its  accounting,  budgeting, \nauditing, and reporting systems. TST also lacks experience in managing ADB disbursements and \nthe adequate capacity to manage an advance account or statement of expenditure procedures \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). TST will \nbe required to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards to report its statutory \nfinancial statements. UJSC,35 with its experience in implementing similar projects through its PCU, \nwill supervise and guide TST. The proposed project will also provide financial management \nsupport to TST.36 \n30.  Procurement. The overall risk assessment is medium. In the past, procurement activities \nwere often delayed due to procurement capacity issues. The situation has been improved by \nhaving PCU capacity strengthened through on the job trainings from four ADB-financed projects \nand refresher trainings on ADB procurement policy and procedures, and the use of International \nFederation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) books in 2020. The PCU has 18 highly trained and \nexperienced  staff  with  extensive  experience  in  procuring  and  implementing  projects  with \ninternational financial institutions and donor organizations. TST, formerly the provincial suvokova \n(utility) responsible for WSS services in Tashkent Province, will be the implementing agency for \nthe project. After experiencing two ADB-financed projects (footnote 9), TST is familiar with ADB \nguidelines and procedures, and its capacity for project implementation has significantly improved. \nTST\u2019s document preparation and review process is adequate to follow ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time). Advance procurement progress is reflected under key \nactivities with milestone items 1.1 and 1.3.   \n31.  Anticorruption. The fight against corruption has become a priority area of state policy. \nThe Anticorruption Agency of Uzbekistan was established to implement anticorruption standards \nand mechanisms in all spheres of state and public activities. Integrity due diligence was conducted \n \n35 It is expected that the current substantial risk rating of UJSC due to its recent establishment in November 2019 will \nbe changed to moderate after (i) mobilizing financial consultants to supplement PCU capacity, and (ii) refresher \ntraining on ADB loan administration and financial management procedures. \n36 ADB. 2015.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with the government, UJSC, and TST. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 28). \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n32.  Poverty. The project will have a direct impact on the health, economic prospects, and \nliving conditions of the population in the project area. By 2028, the project will benefit about \n1 million residents in six cities, one urban center, and the rural areas of three districts, where 25% \nof all households are poor. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the social and poverty \nissues in the project area, which experiences high unemployment (18%) and gender inequality\u2014\nresulting in high rates of violence against women.38 Poor quality drinking water has increased the \ndisease burden, with negative economic consequences that disproportionately affect women, the \npoor, and vulnerable groups. Households without proper toilet facilities are more exposed to the \nrisk of waterborne diseases. This significantly affects productivity and family health expenditures. \nOnly about 26% of households in the project area are connected to sewers;39 the remaining 74% \nrely on pit latrines and earth ditches. Health benefits can be derived from (i) increased access to \ncentralized wastewater systems in urban areas, (ii) reduced open defecation in rural areas, and \n(iii) improved septage management. \n33.  Social.  A  community,  gender-friendly,  awareness-raising  campaign  on  WASH+H, \nincluding COVID-19 prevention practices, will deliver education in rural areas to address local \nsanitation practices that threaten public health and hygiene, including women and girls\u2019 well-being \nand reproductive health, and to strengthen community decision-making and monitoring. Activities \ninclude (i) training of trainers of a youth foundation and teachers, (ii) conducting behavior change \ncampaigns, (iii) community-awareness campaigns through media and engagement activities \nsupported  by  a  local  nongovernment  organization,  and  (iv)  supporting  community  hygiene \nmonitoring groups. The campaign will build the capacity of community leaders to become hygiene \npromoters and monitor wastewater disposal systems in rural areas.  \n34.  Gender. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The findings of the \ngender analysis revealed that women are primarily responsible for domestic chores, and the lack \nof reliable sanitation facilities increases this burden. About 45% of women are responsible for \nwater delivery, and 94% for removing solid and liquid domestic waste. About 14% of households \nheaded by women and 150 social institutions in the rural areas of Chinaz, Yangiyul, and Zangiota \ndistricts  lack  access  to  basic  levels  of  clean  water,  sanitation,  and  hygiene,  with  serious \nconsequences for reproductive health. The project will reduce the drudgery and time poverty of \nwomen and girls, enhance public hygiene awareness, including menstrual hygiene management \npractices, and free up their time for educational and employment opportunities that will contribute \nto COVID-19 impact recovery. The project\u2019s specific gender design features include (i) access to \nimproved sanitation facilities made available in kindergartens, schools, and polyclinics in rural \nareas; (ii) facilitation of women\u2019s participation in project-associated activities; (iii) employment \nopportunities for women;40 (iv) training in gender-inclusive participatory hygiene and sanitation in \nrural areas; (v) an awareness campaign on WASH+H, with a focus on COVID-19 prevention \n(targeting 50% female participants); (vi) equal opportunity and access to training for female staff; \n \n37 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n38 According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 1,501 victims of harassment and domestic violence in the Tashkent \nregion were provided with protection orders (11% of total issued protection orders) in 2020. \n39 About 185 social establishments (e.g., kindergartens, schools, and health centers) lack adequate sanitation facilities. \n40 At least 30% of staff in a new septage management unit in TST will be women. \n \n ", "11 \n(vii)  enhancement  of  gender-sensitive  human  resource  policies  in  TST;  and  (viii)  gender-\nresponsive key performance indicators reporting on wastewater operations. The gender action \nplan for the project has clear targets, responsibilities, and resource allocations.41 \nF.  Safeguards \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.42 \n36.  Environment (category B). The project impacts are expected to be limited in magnitude \nand of short duration, mostly related to the rehabilitation of WWTPs and collection networks. \nThese impacts include generation of dust, noise, and hazardous solid waste,43 labor and public \nsafety,  temporary  access  blockages,  traffic  disturbances,  and  construction  material \ntransportation.  UJSC  prepared  an  initial  environmental  examination  report,  including  an \nenvironmental management plan, which was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in June 2021. UJSC \ntranslated the summary of the initial environmental examination report into Uzbek and posted it \non UJSC\u2019s website, with the full report in Russian, in July 2021. Twelve public consultation \nmeetings were conducted in the project area. During operations, the anticipated negative impacts \ncaused by the increase in sewage volume will be mitigated by WWTP operations in accordance \nwith performance standards. The environmental management plan includes the preparation and \nimplementation of a COVID-19 health and safety management plan and emergency response \nplan by contractors, to address the COVID-19 risk on workers and local communities. The project \nwill have significant positive environmental impacts, including improved water quality in the \nreceiving watercourses of the WWTPs. The project will install 23,500 individual septic tanks in 70 \nrural settlements.44 This will eliminate the infiltration of raw sewage to soil and groundwater, \npreventing pollution consequences to the rural water supply. To ensure adequate maintenance \nof the septic tanks installed, the project will provide user\u2019s manuals including information on the \nneed for regular desludging of septic tanks, disposal of the septage, service fees, and disposal \nitems unsuitable for septic tank systems.   \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project is expected to have only temporary \nimpacts as there are no permanent land acquisition needs. Temporarily, it will likely require \n2.26 hectares (ha) of land, including 1.64 ha of arable and crop cultivation land, and 0.62 ha of \norchard and garden land to facilitate the construction of the wastewater collection lines in Chinaz \nand Yangiyul districts. Other project components do not have involuntary resettlement impacts. \nThe  social  impact  assessment  identifies  four  affected  households  (14  persons)  that  will \nexperience temporary impacts. No household will experience a severe impact from loss of \nproductive assets and no household has been identified as vulnerable. A draft land acquisition \nand resettlement plan (LARP) has been prepared based on the feasibility study and preliminary \nroute  alignment  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  relevant  national \nlegislation. The LARP was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 15 April 2021. Project information \ndisclosure and consultations with project stakeholders and affected persons were undertaken \nduring LARP preparation and will continue throughout project implementation. When the LARP is \nupdated following the detailed design, ADB\u2019s approval will be obtained before its implementation. \nThe grievance redress mechanism will assist affected persons in resolving grievances and \ncomplaints. UJSC will submit semiannual safeguard monitoring reports to ADB for review and \n \n41 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n43 Including asbestos-containing materials, scrap metals, and oils from old transformers. \n44 ADB-funded Second Tashkent Province Water Supply Development Project will install about 4,000 septic tanks in \n11 rural settlements in Chinaz district. \n \n ", "12 \ndisclosure. The capacity of UJSC for involuntary resettlement is inadequate because of its recent \nestablishment. However, the country has enabling laws for fair compensation, and its PCU has \nacquired experience in implementing ADB-financed projects involving involuntary resettlement \nand will be supported by safeguard consultants to be engaged for the project.45 \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The country has no indigenous people communities \nas defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n39.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.46 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nPotential  project  implementation  delays  A performance-linked salary and reward program in TST (Output 2) \ncaused by TST\u2019s limited institutional capacity.    will incentivize performance and reduce staff turnover. \nOngoing capacity-building activities, including twinning programs, \nfor TST as well as the PCU, will carry over from existing ADB-\nfunded water supply projects. Procurement activities will be further \nsupported by project consultants. \nProlonged government approval procedures  Review supported by consultants will expedite implementation. \nby oversight agencies delay implementation.  High project readiness will mitigate delays.  \nTariff increases are lower than expected.  The government supports TST\u2019s debt servicing and implements \nannual tariff increases.

The government, UJSC, and TST have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. The government, UJSC, \nand TST have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement and project agreement. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$161,000,000 to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Tashkent Province Sewerage Improvement \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented \nto the Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n29 October 2021\n \n45 The cost to implement the LARP is estimated at $34,492, including 15% contingency. \n46 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", " \nAppendix 1  13 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nEnvironment, health, and living conditions in Tashkent Province improved (project defined) \n  Data Sources  Risks and \nResults Chain  Performance Indicators  and Reporting  Critical \nMechanisms  Assumptions \nOutcome  By the end of 2028:  a.\u2013f.
