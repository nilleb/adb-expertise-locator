The  final  cost  of  the  Project  is \nestimated at $2.0 billion  - $2.5 billion. The design and construction of the Project will take about \n4 years, after all necessary decisions are taken by the cooperating countries. The heads of state \nof Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan met in Islamabad on 29\u201330 May 2002 to announce \nthe formation of a coalition for implementing the Project. The possibility of constructing a spur \npipeline  taking  off  from  the  Pakistan  part  of  the  main  project  pipeline  to  the  Pakistani  port  of \nGawadar  for  export  of  liquefied  natural  gas  was  also  discussed.  A  steering  committee  of  the \nministers  of  oil  and  gas  from  the  three  countries  (Steering  Committee)  was  established  for \nnecessary follow-up and supervision of the Project. During its first meeting on 9\u201310 July 2002 at \nAshgabat,  the  Steering  Committee  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  play  the \nrole  of  a  development  partner  and  to  grant  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  feasibility \nstudies  of  the  Project.1  Fact-finding  was  completed  and  the  draft  terms  of  reference  approved \nduring the second meeting held in Kabul on 16 September 2002.  \n \n2. \nThe  TAP  Project  has  significant  potential  for  enhancing  stability  and  improving  living \nstandards  in  South  and  Central  Asia.  It  will  be  a  pioneering  effort  in  linking  the  energy-deficit \neconomies  of  South  Asia  to  the  hydrocarbon-rich  Central  Asian  countries.  It  will  (i)  provide \ncheaper and cleaner energy to consumers, (ii) generate income that can be used for developing \nthe social sectors, and (iii) bring about regional security through joint project ownership. It has \nvery  long-term  and  widespread  positive  implications  for  the  countries  involved,  and  for  the \nregion as a whole. However, the realization of the Project faces significant political and technical \nchallenges, considering the volatility of the relationships between the concerned countries and \nthe initial stage of the political process in Afghanistan through which a major  part of the pipeline \npasses. \n \n3. \nThe TA reflects the essence of ADB's approach to regional cooperation. In facilitating the \nProject, ADB will act as an honest broker and an active development partner helping to mobilize \nthe necessary technical and financial resources for the Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nISSUES \n\nThe  concept  of  a  trans -Afghan  pipeline  to  transport  hydrocarbons  (both  petroleum  and \n4. \nnatural gas) from Central Asia to South Asia has been mooted several times in the past decade. \nThe  last  attempt  at  developing  a  gas  transmission  pipeline  was  made  in  1997  by  an \ninternational  oil  and  gas  company.  Due  to  political  uncertainty,  however,  the  Project  was \nabandoned  after  limited  technical  feasibility  studies.  This  time,  to  strengthen  the  business \nenvironment  of  the  Project  and  reduce  risks,  the  Steering  Committee  has  decided  that  (i)  the \npipeline should be constructed and operated by a consortium,  inter alia comprising international \noil  companies  and  relevant  national  companies;  and  (ii)  that  the  pipeline  consortium  will  only \ntransport the gas and not own it. Suitable gas sale and purchase agreements are therefore to \nbe  developed  between  Turkmenistan  and  buyers  of  the  gas  in  Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  and \npossibly  India,  as  well  as  a  gas  transportation  agreement  between  Turkmenistan  and  the \npipeline consortium. Based on the projected annual gas throughput in the pipeline, a prima facie \nreview of the financial viability of the TAP Project indicates that the price of the gas delivered in \n\n                                                 \n\n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 2002. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n2\n \nPakistan and India would be very competitive compared with the prices of substitute fuels being \nused at present. Since the additional natural gas supply from the Project is expected to reduce \nthe  use  of  fuel  oil  and  coal  \u2014  the  main  substitute  fuels  \u2014  the  TAP  Project  will  also  generate \nconsiderable environmental benefits. During the initial years of pipeline operation, Afghanistan \nis  expected  to  benefit  mainly  from  its  participation  in  the  pipeline  consortium  by  receiving  a \nshare of the transit fees from the consortium. However, it  is expected that a portion of the gas \nsupplied by the pipeline will be used in Afghanistan and that any surplus of the capacity of the \npipeline  could  also  be  used  to  transport  gas  produced  in  Afghanistan  to  gas  consumers  both \nwithin Afghanistan as well as outside it. This should stimulate investment in exploration and use \nof  natural  gas  in  Afghanistan.  Similarly,  Pakistan  can  also  use  any  surplus  capacity  in  the \npipeline either for domestic transportation or for export. \n \nFive issues are important to the TAP Project: (i) confirmation of a market for the gas in \n5. \nPakistan  and  India  and  commitment  of  potential  buyers  to  enter  into  gas  sale  and  purchase \nagreements; (ii) certification that the natural gas reserves at Dauletabad field can produce the \nenvisaged quantities of gas over a period of 25\u201330 years; (iii) security concerns of Pakistan and \nIndia  with  regard  to  possible  disruption  of  gas  supplies  through  the  pipeline;  (iv)  techno-\neconomic  feasibility  of  the  pipeline  and  preparation  of  its  basic  design, considering the terrain \nconditions  and  logistical  constraints;  and  (v)  required  mobilization  of  international  oil  and  gas \ncompanies  to  take  the  lead  role  in  the  pipeline  consortium  for  timely  and  cost-efficient \nconstruction  of  the  pipeline,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  same  in  accordance  with \ninternational standards. At the request of the Steering Committee, ADB is proceeding to develop \nsolutions  to  issues  (i)  and  (iii)  through  (v).  The  Government  of  Turkmenistan  is  financing  an \nevaluation  and  certification  of  the  recoverable  gas  reserves  at  the  Dauletabad  field  and  a \ntechnical audit of its gas production and processing facilities. The creation of a contractual basis \nfor  the  Project's  development  and  ADB's  provision  of  technical  assistance  for  preparing \ndocuments are seen as a major source of strength for the Project. \n \n6. \nundertaken. The studies have been divided into six parts. \n \n\nTo  address  the  five  key  issues  raised  in  para.  5,  a  number  of  feasibility  studies  will  be \n\n(i) \n\nMarket analysis. ADB staff and staff consultant experts are analyzing the demand \nfor  natural  gas  in  north  India  and  Pakistan.  This  study  will  establish  the  base \ndemand  for  Turkmen  gas,  which  is  necessary  for  the  techno-economic feasibility \nstudy  being  conducted  under  this  TA. The study is expected to be completed by \n10 December 2002. \n\nRisk analysis and mitigation. Mitigating the concerns of Pakistan and India about \ndisruptions  of  gas  supplies  is  important  for  securing  their  participation  in  the \nProject. ADB staff, in consultation with international experts, are preparing a paper \nidentifying  the  possible  risks  associated  with  the  Project  and  possible  mitigative \nmeasures.  ADB  has  retained  a  firm  of  external  international  counsel  to  provide \nadvice as to (a) the legal, security,  and geopolitical background of the Project; (b) \nthe contractual framework necessitated by (a) to ensure the viability of the Project, \nand (c) the provisions that should be incorporated into the inter-country Framework \nAgreement [see (v)] as a result of (a) and (b).  \n\nCertification  of  the  production  capacity  and  facilities  at  Dauletabad  to \nsustain gas supplies over the next 25 years. This study is being organized by \nthe Government of Turkmenistan and will be completed by March/April 2003. \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\nTechno-economic  study  of  the  TAP  Pipeline.  This  study  is  being  conducted \nunder  the  TA  and  will  cover  pipeline  routing,  preliminary  design,  cost  estimates, \nrapid  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  calculations  of  volume-price \nsensitivity.  \n\nConsortium  formation.  ADB  staff  are  working  with  the  Steering  Committee  to \nfinalize  the  intercountry  framework  agreement  that  will  form  the  basis  for \norganizing  to  implement  the  TAP  Project.  A  draft  version  of  this  agreement  was   \ntabled during the third meeting of the Steering Committee held in Ashgabat on 17\u2013\n18 October 2002, and was extensively discussed. Based on this draft and inputs \nindependently to be provided by ADB staff working with an international law firm, \nADB  will  prepare  prequalification  documents  to  assist  the  Steering  Committee in \nmaking a shortlist of international gas companies that could become lead members \nof  the  consortium  for  the  TAP  Project.  ADB  will  assist  the  Steering  Committee, \npossibly through an advisory TA, on the final selection of consortium partners and \ncontractors  from  the  shortlisted  firms  and  drafting  multiple  agreements  that  are \nneeded to finalize the TAP Project. \n\nSocial impact studies.  While the initial social assessment of the Project will be \ndone  as  part  of  the  EIA  performed  under  item  (iv)  \u2014  studies  on  social  impact, \npoverty  analysis,  and  possible  mitigative  measures  will  be  carried  out  after  the \nproject  concepts  and  routing  are  finalized.  The  activities  could  be  done  under  a \nfollow-up TA that will include a final EIA and also a social impact study.   \n\nIII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nPurpose and Output \n\nThe TA will fund the preparation of a technical and economic feasibility study for the TAP \n7. \nProject. This feasibility study [para. 6 (iv) above], along with the other listed studies, will be used \nby the governments of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and, possibly, India as a basis for \n(i)  the  intergovernmental  framework  agreement  required  to  implement  project  construction, \noperation, and gas sales; (ii) the gas sales and purchase contracts between Turkmenistan and \nthe  purchasers  of  gas  from  the  Dauletabad  field;  and  (iii)  the  transportation  contract  between \nTurkmenistan and the gas pipeline consortium. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nThe  output  of  the  TA  will  include  route  surveys, basic design of the TAP Project, cost \n8. \nestimates, implementation schedule, environment and social impact assessment, and financial \nand economic analyses. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 2. \n \nB. \n\n \nCost and Financing \n\n9. \nThe total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,370,000 equivalent, of which $1,250,000 will \nbe  in  foreign  exchange  and  $120,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  Government  of \nTurkmenistan will be funding the assessment of reserves of the Dauletabad Natural Gas Field, \nexpected  to  cost  about  $300,000  equivalent.  In  addition,  the  governments  of  Turkmenistan, \nAfghanistan,  and  Pakistan  will  provide  $70,000  equivalent  in  kind,  to  cover  costs  of  office \naccommodation, \ntransport,  salaries  of  counterpart  staff,  adm inistrative  support,  and \ncontingencies. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program to cover \nforeign exchange costs of $950,000 and local currency costs of $50,000 equivalent for a total of \n$1,000,000.  Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n4\n \nC. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n10. \nADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA  and  the  Steering  Committee  will  be  its \nImplementing Agency. The Steering Committee is adequately staffed with the required persons \nand  has  the  necessary  resources  to  coordinate  with  the  international  consultant  in  the \nconsultant\u2019s techno-economic study of the TAP pipeline. In addition, each of the three countries \nhas  appointed  specialist  coordinators  to  ensure  detailed  sector  support  to  ADB  and  the \ninternational consultant. Finally, the heads of state of the three countries have arranged to meet \nevery  quarter  to  resolve  key  issues  concerning  the  Project.  To  ensure  the  commitment  of  the \nthree countries to the TA, it was agreed that the international consultant will be fielded only after \nthe framework agreement has been signed. \n \nThe TA will require about 22 person-months of input of an international consultant. The \n11. \ninternational  consultant  will  have  expertise  in  pipeline  system  design,  route  survey  and \nevaluation,  costing,  and  financial  and  economic  analyses.  The  international  consultant  will  be \npermitted to hire domestic consultants, interpreters, and guides to assist in the route survey and \nselection. The international consultant may also contract out satellite imagery services required \nfor route survey. ADB will engage the international consultant in accordance with its Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  selecting  and  engaging  consultants \nincluding those required by  the quality and cost based selection system. Since the scope and \nother arrangements are being specified in detail, summary technical proposals will be invited.  \n \n \n12. \nThe  TA  is  expected  to  begin  in  January  2003  and  be  completed  by  August  2003.  The \ninternational  consultant  will  submit  inception,  draft  final,  and  final  reports  1,  4,  and  5  months, \nrespectively,  after  appointment.  At  the  first  tripartite  meeting,  the  steering  committee,  the \ninternational  consultant,  and  ADB  will  review  the  inception  report establish the direction of the \nstudy. The final tripartite meeting will be held after submission of the draft final report to confirm \nthe results of the TA and to establish follow-up actions by the governments and ADB. After this \nmeeting,  the  international  consultant,  at  ADB's  request,  will  present  the  results  of  the  study  to \nthe concerned governments, ADB staff and other stakeholders.  \n \n13. \nADB  will  procure  an  all-terrain  vehicle  for  the  use  of  the  consultant  and  ADB  staff  in \nsupervising the work in Afghanistan. The vehicle and other small items required for completing \nthe TA will be procured in accordance with ADB's  Guidelines for Procurement. After completion \nof  the  TA,  the  vehicle  will  be  given  to  the  Government  of  Afghanistan  under  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n\n14. \nThe  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision  of  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  on  a  grant  basis \nfor  the  Feasibility  Studies  of  the  Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan  Natural  Gas  Pipeline \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n\n \n\n\fTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK

appropriately estimate the \nthe \n\n \n1. \ncosts,  reliability,  routing,  construction  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nTurkmenistan \u2013 Afghanistan \u2013 Pakistan (TAP) Pipeline. \n \nA. \n\nRoute Selection \n\n2. \nThe international consultant will conduct a detailed survey for establishing a route for the \npipeline  using  two  alternative  routes.1 The following factors will be considered in selecting the \nroute: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nphysical geography, including river crossings, mountains, etc., which may require \nan alternate route \nlocal issues related to culture, archaeology, etc. \nregulatory applications and approval requirements \nland acquisition and resettlement of affected persons \ncompensation for surface access \nlaws/regulations concerning cross-border movements  \nsecurity issues  \nenvironment protection \n\n \nUsing  the  survey  results,  the  consultant  will  submit  a  map  (scale  not  less  than \n3. \n1:200,000)  of  the  selected  route  with  any  proposed  alternatives  and  their  rationale.  The \ninternational  consultant  will  locate  on  the  map  all  geographic  details,  major  earthquake/fault \nzones  along  the  proposed  pipeline  route,  elevations  and  other  features  deemed  important  to \nconstruction, as well as for O&M of the TAP pipeline.
