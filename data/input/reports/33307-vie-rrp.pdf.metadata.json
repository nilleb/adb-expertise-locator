This  technical  assistance  project  has  no  adverse \nenvironmental  impact.  The  ensuing  investment  project  will  be \ncategorized at a later stage. \n \nThe  Greater  Mekong  Subregion:  Kunming-Haiphong  Transport \nCorridor\u2500Noi  Bai-Lao  Cai  Highway  Technical  Assistance  Project \n(the Project) is to assist the Government in preparing the ensuing \nNoi  Bai-Lao  Cai  Highway  Project.  The  scope  of  the  Project  will \ninclude: (i) detailed engineering design, (ii) updated economic and \nfinancial  studies,  (iii)  social  and  environmental  studies,  and \n(iv) procurement  assistance \nfor  civil  works  and  construction \nsupervision consulting services for the ensuing highway project. \n \nViet  Nam\u2019s  economy  has  grown  over  the  past  decade  by  an \naverage  7\u20138%  per  annum.  Based  on \nthe  Government\u2019s \nforthcoming  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  for  2006 \nto  2010,  this  rate  of  growth  is  projected  to  continue.  Among  the \nmost  important  consequences  of  this  soundly  based  and  steady \ngrowth  is  a  dramatic  reduction  in  the  country\u2019s  poverty  rate,  from \n53% in 1993 to 25% in 2005. The SEDP estimates that the rate will \nfall  to  15\u201316%  by  2010.  However,  Viet  Nam  will  need  to  invest \nabout  35%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  to  achieve  this,  and \nbasic  economic \nlarge  share. \nInfrastructure bottlenecks are becoming apparent, especially in the \ntransport  and  energy  sectors.  These  will  need  to  be  addressed \nquickly  if  growth  and  consequent  poverty  reduction  targets  are  to \nbe  met.  The  proposed  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in \npreparing  one  of  its  highest  priority  infrastructure  investments\u2014a \nmodern  standard  road  link  from  Hanoi  to  connect  at  Lao  Cai  with \nthe  road  network  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  This \nlink will serve two purposes. At the national level, it will connect the \nnorthwest  region  of  the  country,  now  very  poor  and  isolated,  with \nthe  economic  centers  that  have  developed  around  Hanoi  and  its \nport,  Haiphong.  At  the  regional  level,  it  will  link  the  rapidly-\nexpanding  economy  of  PRC\u2019s  Yunnan  province  with  Hanoi  and \nHaiphong,  facilitating  rapid  expansion  of  cross-border  trade  and \ncommerce. \n \n\ninfrastructure  will \n\nreceive  a \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n\nto \n\nthe \nThe  proposed  highway  will  contribute  significantly \ndevelopment  of  the  poor  northwest  region  of  the  country,  by \nimproving national and regional transport linkages. It will also help \nreduce  poverty  levels  in  this  region.  The  Project  will  facilitate \nachieving  these  objectives  by  providing  the  resources  required  to \nensure  that  the  highway  is:  (i)  designed  to  the  highest  technical \nstandards, (ii) cost-effective, and (iii) takes into account the unique \nenvironmental  and  social  characteristics  of  the  region  it  will  pass \nthrough and impact significantly.  \n \nThe project cost is estimated at $8 million. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of \n$6 million  equivalent  (75%)  and  the  Government  will  finance \n$2 million equivalent (25%). \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $6  million  equivalent, \ndenominated \nits  Asian \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF).  The  loan  will  have  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan Agreement. \n \nThe Borrower will transfer the loan proceeds from the Government \nto the Implementing Agency through budgetary allocation. \n \n2 years \n \n31 March 2008 \n\nin  Special  Drawing  Rights, \n\nfrom \n\nImplementing  Agency  will  be \n\n \nThe Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Transport (MOT), and \nthe \nthe  Vietnam  Expressway \nCorporation (VEC). \n \nMOT will have overall responsibility for project implementation, and \nformal correspondence with line ministries, the governments of the \nprovinces through which the highway will pass, and ADB. VEC will \nbe responsible for day-to-day project implementation under MOT\u2019s \nsupervision. VEC will set up a project implementation unit headed \nby an experienced project director and suitable staff.  \n \nEquipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines \nfor Procurement (2004). \n \n\n\fConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii\n\nthe  Use  of  Consultants \n\nAn  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  using  quality  and \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \ncost-based  selection  procedures, \nGuidelines  on \n(2005)  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  About  90  person-months  of  international  consultants \nand  240  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  will  be  required. \nThe consultants will have expertise in project management, design \nof  high  standard  highways,  road  safety,  transport  economics, \nfinancial analysis, environmental impact assessment, resettlement \nplanning,  social  development  (including  indigenous  peoples),  and \nprocurement  assistance.  The  duration  of  the  consulting  services \nwill be about 15 months. \n \nThe proposed highway, to be constructed based on the outputs of \nthe  Project,  will  support  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poverty  reduction  program \nthrough  enhanced  economic  growth  and  by  providing  access  for \ncurrently  isolated  communities  to economic  and  social  services.  It \nwill  also  contribute  to  the  efficient  development  of  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion  by  strengthening  connectivity  with  neighboring \ncountries and increasing competitiveness.

This  is  being  addressed  through \nadvance  procurement  action  for  the  Project\u2019s  consulting  services, \nand  by  providing  MOT  and  VEC  with  specialist  support  for  the \nconsultant selection process. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS):  Kunming-\nHaiphong Transport Corridor\u2500Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway Technical Assistance (TA) Project (the \nProject). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nThe proposed Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway is an integral section of the GMS  North-South \nEconomic Corridor, connecting Kunming in Yunnan province of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC)  with  Hanoi  and  Haiphong  port  in  Viet  Nam.  In  Yunnan,  the  400-kilometer  (km) \nexpressway from Kunming to the border with Viet Nam will be completed in 2008. However, in \nViet  Nam,  most  of  the  existing  Hanoi-Lao  Cai  highway  is  narrow,  contains  a  large  number  of \nbridges with limited capacity, and there is substantial ribbon development on most of its length. \nThese factors severely limit its capacity and reduce the possibility of improving it to cater for the \nprojected  growth  in  traffic  demand  in  the  corridor.  The  section  of  the  highway  from  Noi  Bai  to \nHanoi and Haiphong has been improved under assistance from other external donor agencies. \nSo, only the Noi Bai-Lao Cai section needs to be upgraded to complete the Kunming-Haiphong \nTransport  Corridor.  The  project  feasibility  study  confirmed  the  necessity  and  viability  of  a \nmodern highway linking the existing highway network around Hanoi, at Noi Boi, with the border \ncrossing at Lao Cai, covering about 260 km.1 The Project will build on the work undertaken in \nthat  study  and  will  prepare  a  subsequent  project,  suitable  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nfunding,  to  construct  the  highway.  A  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  Project  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \n3. \nThe total project cost for the highway is estimated at about $620 million. Such a large-\nscale  infrastructure  project\u2014involving  substantial  investment  and  social  and  environmental \nimpacts\u2014requires  detailed  design  study,  detailed  economic  and  financial  analyses,  and \nsafeguard  arrangements.  The  proposed  Project  will  provide  the  resources  to  undertake  these \nstudies and prepare the subsequent investment project. \n  \nThe  Vietnam  Expressway  Corporation  (VEC)  will  play  a  critical  role  in  preparing  and \n4. \nimplementing  the  Project,  and  will  participate  in  the  subsequent  investment  project.  VEC  was \nestablished in October 2004 as a state-owned enterprise under the Ministry of Transport (MOT). \nVEC  manages  expressway-related  businesses,  including:  (i)  technical  consultancy  on  the \ndevelopment  of  national  expressway  networks,  and  feasibility  study  and  design  of  each \nexpressway  project;  (ii)  investment  and  project  management  for  expressway  construction; \n(iii) operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  expressways;  and  (iv)  commercial  services  for \nexpressway  users.  To  date,  it  has  little  experience  in  project  management,  financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  safeguard  issues.  Institutional  capacity  building  through  the \nProject will enable VEC to manage this and similar projects in the future. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 A  preliminary  economic  and  financial  study  for  the  highway  project  was  carried  out  under  the  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB). 2002. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Kunming-Haiphong \nTransport  Corridor  Project.  Manila  (TA  4050-VIE).  It  appeared  that  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nProject  is  22.0%  and  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is  8.7%,  assuming  that  the  toll  rate  for  the \nhighway is double the current toll rate. Details are shown in Appendix 3.  \n\n\f2 \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n5. \nThe  proposed  highway  will  cross  Hanoi,  Pho  Tho,  Vinh  Phuc,  Yen  Bai,  and  Lao  Cai \nprovinces. Together, these provinces have a population of about 13.3 million\u2014about 17% of the \ntotal  population  of  Viet  Nam\u2014and  were  responsible  for  about  18%  of  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  in  2003.  Per  capita  GDP  is  $1,011  in  Hanoi,  but  only  $361  in  Pho  Tho,  $254  in \nVinh Phuc, $210 in Yen Bai, and $198 in Lao Cai provinces. \n \nThe  proposed  highway  will  reduce  the  travel  time  between  Hanoi  and  Lao  Cai  from  at \n6. \nleast  10  hours  at  present,  to  about  3  hours.  This  decrease  in  travel  time  will  encourage \neconomic  activities  in  the  affected  provinces,  provide  employment  opportunities  for  the  local \npopulation, and improve access to social services. Many ethnic minority groups live in Yen Bai \nand  Lao  Cai  provinces.  Most  live  below  the  poverty  line,  mainly  due  to  poor  accessibility  to \neconomic opportunities, and education and health services. This is largely caused by poor road \ninfrastructure, particularly on the right bank of the Red River, since the existing highway travels \nalong  the  left  bank  and  there  is  very  little  cross-river  traffic.  The  proposed  highway  will  be \nlocated  on  the  right  bank  because  the  terrain  is  easier  and  it  will  provide  an  immediate  and \nsignificant benefit to communities in this area that have never had good road access.      \n \n7. \nIn  the  context  of  the  GMS  and  regional  integration,  economic  cooperation  between \nViet Nam  and  the  PRC  has  developed  since  the  late  1990s.  The  trade  volume  between  the \ncountries has increased more than three times, from $1.3 billion in 1999 to $4.6 billion in 2003.2 \nImports  from  the  PRC  grew  by  47.9%  (2002\u20132003)  while  exports  to  the  PRC  grew  by  30.5%. \nYunnan province is a major producer of tobacco, minerals, steel, and fertilizer. Viet Nam, on the \nother hand, excels in producing vegetables, fruits, seafood, crude oil, rubber, minerals, and light \nindustrial  goods  (such  as  textiles  and  footwear).  So,  Yunnan  province  and  Viet  Nam  have  a \ncomplementary  economic  relationship  through  their  border  trade.  The  total  trade  value \nregistered at the Hekou-Lao Cai border crossing points expanded by 36% in 2003 and 51% in \n2004  to  $336  million,3 which  accounts  for  80%  of  Yunnan-Viet  Nam  trade  and  10%  of  PRC-\nViet Nam  trade  in  2004.  Almost  1  million  tons  of  cargo  is  transported  annually  across  the \nHekou-Lao  Cai  border  crossing  points.  Arrangements  for  initial  implementation  of  the  GMS \nCross-Border  Transport  Agreement  at  the  Hekou-Lao  Cai  border  crossing  points  have  been \nfinalized; this is expected to be signed by the two governments in early 2006 and commence by \n30 June 2006. In addition, agreement has been reached by the two governments to consider, at \nthe  earliest  possible  time,  expanding  the  scope  of  the  existing  bilateral  road  transport \nagreement  to  include  the  entire  Kunming-Hanoi-Haiphong  transport  corridor  as  an  interim \nmeasure  until  the  relevant  annexes  and  protocols  of  the  GMS  Cross-Border  Transport \nAgreement  are  ratified.  This  will  facilitate  the  exchange  of  commercial  traffic  rights  along  the \ncorridor, which would reduce the incidence of costly and time-consuming transshipment at the \nHekou-Lao Cai border crossing points. \n \n8. \nThe passage of containerized freight is particularly important for the trading relationship. \nForwarders of overseas container cargos in Kunming do not currently use the Kunming-Hekou-\nLao  Cai-Hanoi-Haiphong  route,  partly  because  of  the  poor  condition  of  the  Lao  Cai-Hanoi \nsection in Viet Nam, inefficient custom control procedures at the Hekou-Lao Cai border, and the \ncost of transshipping containers at the border crossing. Instead, they send container cargos by \nrail or road to ports in Guangzhou province (PRC), which takes up to 6 days. The proposed Noi \n\n                                                 \n2 National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2004. China Statistical Yearbook 2004. Beijing. \n3 ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n\fBai-Lao Cai Highway will allow forwarders in Kunming to reach Haiphong port, a large container \nfacility,  in  1  day.  Once  the  proposed  Noi  Bai-Lao  Cai  Highway  has  been  completed,  and  the \nADB-supported  border  crossing  operation  is  streamlined,4 a  substantial  number  of  containers \noriginating  in  Kunming  could  be  diverted  to  the  Kunming-Haiphong  route.  Viet  Nam  would \nbenefit from this, through transit and port fees, among others.  \n \n9. \nThe  Government  is  planning  to  expand  the  expressway  and  modern  highway  network \nthroughout Viet Nam, in line with the outline of the expressway master plan (EMP).5  Appendix 2 \ncontains  analysis  of  the  road  subsector,  focusing  on  expressways.  VEC  is  responsible  for  the \ndevelopment of the expressway network, partly funded by revenues from expressway tolls.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Strategy \n\n10. \nViet  Nam\u2019s  economy  has  grown  at  7\u20138%  per  annum  over  the  past  decade,  and  the \nGovernment  estimates  that  it  will  continue,  as  reflected  in  the  forthcoming  Five-Year  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010.6 While this growth has had a dramatic impact \non the country\u2019s poverty rate, which declined from about 59% in 1993 to an estimated 25% in \n2005, it has severely strained the capacity of basic economic infrastructure, particularly power \nand  transportation  systems.  The  feasibility  study  of  the  Noi  Bai-Lao  Cai  Highway  Project  has \nfound that traffic is growing at about twice the rate of GDP and that this high growth rate is likely \nto  continue  beyond  2020,  reflecting  Viet  Nam\u2019s  very  low  level  of  vehicle  ownership. 7 Major \noutputs of the feasibility study are in Appendix 3. \n \n \n \n11. \nThe Government is acutely aware  of the impact of inadequate infrastructure on growth \nand poverty reduction. It is beginning to see the adverse impact of infrastructure bottlenecks on \nforeign investment and its desire to spread development more equitably with areas far from the \nmajor urban centers (Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, etc.). The Government is taking a dual \napproach  to  the  road  sector:  (i)  developing  a  network  of  high-capacity  expressways  and \nhighways  linking  the  main  urban  areas  with  (a)  each  other,  (b)  less-developed  regions  of  the \ncountry  and,  (c)  neighboring  countries;  and  (ii)  developing  the  institutions  required  to  plan, \ndesign,  implement,  and  manage  this  network.  MOT  is  responsible  for  implementing  this \nprogram. To date, it has developed a preliminary outline for the network and established VEC to \noversee its further development and implementation. \n \nThe  existing  national  road  system  was  mainly  constructed  with  two  lanes  and  a  small \n12. \npart with four lanes. Traffic management is rudimentary and the rate of traffic accidents is very \nhigh.  Government  studies  have  indicated  that  the  main  national  highway  network  should  be \nwidened and new highways built to connect important economic zones, large urban centers and \nindustrial  zones,  and  international  borders.  Reflecting  this  need,  the  Government  has  directed \nMOT  to  prepare  the  EMP  (para.  9).  Its  basic  outline  (all  that  exists  at  present)  provides  for \n2 north-south expressways, 6 east-west expressways, and 14 outer urban circular expressways. \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1999.

The  bulk  of  the  loan  remains \nundisbursed during this period, which causes the Government to incur substantial commitment \nand  other  financing  costs,  especially  for  ordinary  capital  resources  loans.  Delays  in  recruiting \nconsultants  or  preparing  detailed  designs  have  led  directly  to  delays  in  award  of  civil  works, \nexacerbating the situation. This is addressed in the design of the Project by: (i) using advance \naction for the selection of consultants, and (ii) incorporating all safeguard-related planning and \nprocurement-related  activities  (for  the  subsequent  investment  project)  in  the  scope  of  the \nProject. By the time the investment project loan has been processed and become effective (or \nthe Government has found other means to finance the highway\u2019s construction), land acquisition \nand resettlement should be ready for physical action, and all civil works and consulting services \ncontracts will be ready for award. \n \n \n \n14. \nIn ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008) approved in August 2005, \nkey development challenges for the next 5 years include the following: (i) sustain high economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction; (ii) create jobs for new labor market entrants; (iii) reduce inequity \nthrough  targeted  poverty  reduction;  (iv)  support  social  development  by  improving  health  and \neducation  services,  gender  equality,  and  social  inclusion;  (v)  protect  the  environment;  and \n(vi) improve  governance  to  ensure  these  challenges  are  sufficiently  and  efficiently  addressed. \nViet  Nam  has  contributed  significantly  to  enhancing  connectivity,  increasing  competitiveness, \nand  promoting  a  greater  sense  of  community  in  the  GMS.  The  subsequent  highway  project  is \nfully supportive of this strategy, at both national and regional levels. The Project is also in the \nlending pipeline of the Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008)8 as it \nforms a high-priority section of the Kunming-Hanoi-Haiphong transport route of the GMS North-\nSouth Economic Corridor.    \n \n \n \n15. \nSince lifting the embargo on external financing in 1993, there have been many projects \nsupporting  the  road  subsector  in  Viet  Nam  (Appendix  4).  Initially,  these  projects  focused  on \nrehabilitating National Highway 1, which runs along the east coast of Viet Nam and acts as the \ncentral spine for the road network.9 Subsequently, integral parts of the GMS economic corridors \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n4. \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB.  2005.

Manila (Loan 1653-VIE).  \n\n\fin  Viet  Nam  were  improved  under  ADB-funded  projects.10 As  the  work  on  improving  national \nhighways  is  drawing  to  a  close,  projects  are  increasingly  focusing  on  other  parts  of  the  road \nnetwork.  ADB\u2019s  Provincial  Roads  Improvement  Project  is  upgrading  provincial  roads  in \n17 provinces  in  the  northern  uplands  and  Red  River  Delta  regions.11 The  upgrading  of  rural \nroads  in  18  provinces  was  addressed  under  ADB\u2019s  Rural  Infrastructure  Sector  Project,12 and \nrural roads are being improved in 40 provinces across the country with funding from the World \nBank  and  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  under  the \nRural Transport II project.13 ADB is currently processing the Central Region Transport Networks \nImprovement  Sector  Project,  which  will  address  the  removal  of  transport  constraints  on \neconomic and social development in the rural areas of 19 provinces in central Viet Nam.14 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n16. \nConstruction of the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway will be based on the outputs of the Project. \nThe  current  travel  time  between  Kunming  and  Haiphong  is  more  than  2  days.  Transport \nbetween  Kunming  and  Haiphong  will  be  1  day  upon  completion  of  the  highway.  Due  to  the \nsubstantial reduction in travel time and much improved transport conditions, industries clustered \naround  Hanoi  and  Haiphong  will  be  able  to  expand  to  the  very  poor  northwest  of  the  country, \nbringing employment, better access to social services, and other benefits. In addition, some of \nthe freight transport in Yunnan province which is currently moving to ports in the PRC could be \ndiverted  to  Haiphong  port.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  ability  to  export  agricultural  and  maritime  products  to \nYunnan province, already a rapidly growing trade, will also be substantially enhanced.   \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n17. \nThe  feasibility  study  for  the  subsequent  highway  project  (footnote  1)  confirmed  its \neconomic and financial viability. The Project will provide the Government with preparatory work \nfor the highway project. The scope of the Project will include: (i) detailed engineering design; (ii) \nupdated economic and financial studies based on the detailed engineering designs and costs; \n(iii)  social  and  environmental  studies,  including  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA),  and \nresettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  plans;  and  (iv) procurement  assistance  for  civil \nworks  and  construction  supervision  consulting  services  required  for  the  subsequent  highway \nproject, so that related contracts will be ready for award when project loans become effective. \nProcurement  will  be  undertaken  in line  with  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998),  Guidelines  on \nthe Use of Consultants (2005), and Guidelines for Procurement (2004).

Closer to Hanoi, between Noi Bai and Yen Bai (about 120 km), the terrain is flat \nto rolling, traffic volume is high and growing quickly, population density is relatively high, and the \nproportion  of  ethnic  minorities  is  low.  From  Yen  Bai  to  Lao  Cai  (about  140  km),  the  terrain \nchanges  from  rolling  to  mountainous,  existing  and  projected  traffic  is  relatively  low,  population \ndensity  is  very  low  (particularly  on  the  right  bank  of  the  Red  River  where  the  highway  will  be \nlocated), and the proportion of ethnic minorities is very high. The configuration of the proposed \nhighway, to be reflected in its detailed technical designs and subsequent operation, will reflect \nthese differences. Briefly, the Noi Bai-Yen Bai section will be designed as a high standard dual \ncarriageway facility, with grade-separated interchanges\u2014in essence, an expressway. It will be \ntolled as a closed system, with tolls being used for O&M and debt service for the entire facility. It \nwill be constructed with four traffic lanes initially, with provision for two additional lanes at a later \ndate (when justified by the growth in traffic). The Yen Bai-Lao Cai section, on the other hand, \nwill  be  constructed  initially  to  a  much  simpler  configuration,  essentially  as  a  two-lane  single \ncarriageway  rural  highway,  with  at-grade  intersections  and  an  open  barrier  tolling  system  that \nwill allow local traffic to use the road without payment; only traffic passing through the Yen Bai-\nLao Cai section will pay. However, the design of this section will include provision for a second \ncarriageway  and  grade  separation,  if  traffic  volumes  increase  to  require  additional  capacity. \nBased  on  the  feasibility  study  (Appendix  3),  it  is  unlikely  that  this  would  occur  for  at  least  10 \nyears  after  the  opening  of  the  initial  two-lane  facility.  To  ensure  maximum  utilization  of  both \nsections  of  the  highway  and  maximum  distribution  of  its  benefits,  the  Project  will  include  the \ndevelopment  of  linkages  to  the  existing  road  network\u2014in  particular  to  the  existing  highway \nbetween  Noi  Bai  and  Lao  Cai  located  on  the  opposite  bank  of  the  Red  River.  Bridges  will  be \nbuilt over the Red River to connect to the existing highways.  \n \n19. \nThe highway will require a six-lane structure for the Noi Bai-Yen Bai section and a four-\nlane  structure  for  the  Yen  Bai-Lao  Cai  section,  in  about  10\u201320  years.  Right-of-way  for  the \nhighway  will  be  acquired  based  on  these  lane  configurations.  The  detailed  design  work  to  be \nundertaken under the Project will determine the positions of these additional lanes and related \nstructures  to:  (i)  ensure  that  the  highway\u2019s  subsequent  expansion  can  be  undertaken  with  as \nlittle impact as possible on the highway in service and the traffic using it, and (ii) define the land \nacquisition boundaries for the ultimate configuration. \n \n20. \nIn  April  2004,  the  governments  of  the  six  GMS  countries  reached  agreement  on  the \nRoad  and  Bridge  Design  and  Construction  Standards  and  Specifications  (GMS  Highway \nStandards), Annex 11 of the GMS Cross-Border Transport Agreement. In principle, the highway \nwill  be  designed  to  GMS  Highway  Standards.  Detailed  design  and  technical specifications  will \nbe  formulated  through  the  detailed design  study  and  technical coordination  meetings  between \nViet Nam and the PRC. Access-controlled highways that provide appropriate modality of long-\ndistance traffic and restrict accessibility of local people along highways are necessary for safe \nroad transport if vehicle ownership rises at twice the rate of per capita GDP in Viet Nam (para. \n10).  A  road  safety  audit  will  be  carried  out  to  identify  accident-prone  areas  and  propose \nadequate  road  safety  improvement  measurements  for  access  roads  to  existing  roads.  The \npercentage of motorcycles in traffic volume is very high for the following sections of the existing \nroad: Hanoi-Viet (25%), Viet Tri-Yen Bai (33%), and Yen Bai-Lao Cai (44%) (footnote 7). Due to \ntraffic safety and efficiency, a modal mix between motorcycles and non-motorcycle traffic should \n\n\fbe avoided on the highway. The detailed design study will determine the most appropriate lane \nconfiguration and traffic regulations for motorcycle traffic. \n \n21. \nThe  highway\u2019s  construction  will  involve  large  excavation,  acquisition  of  residential  and \nagricultural  lands,  and  some  resettlement  of  project-affected  people,  although  the  final \nalignment  will  be  developed  to  ensure  that  resettlement  is  kept  to  a  minimum,  as  required  by \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  In  addition,  the  highway  will  pass  through \nareas  that  have  a  high  proportion  of  ethnic  minorities.  Since  the  social  and  environmental \nimpacts  of  the  highway\u2019s  construction  are  likely  to  be  significant,  the  following  reports  will  be \nprepared as part of the Project\u2019s scope, in accordance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies: (i) an EIA, \n(ii)  a  full  resettlement  plan  (RP),  and  (iii)  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP).  The \nhighway  project  may  increase  the  exposure  of  local  population  to  HIV/AIDS 15  during  the \nconstruction  and  post-construction  periods.  The  social  assessment  will  include  information  on \nthe  present  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  situation,  as  well  as  the  potential  increase  in \nHIV/AIDS cases and human trafficking in the project area, including the border area. The EMDP \nand gender strategy will also include prevention and mitigation measures. Details on the social \nassessment  and  gender  strategy  included  in  the  Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social \nStrategy are in Appendix 5. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n22. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $8.0 million equivalent, including the cost of \nconsulting  services,  equipment,  incremental  administration,  interest  during  implementation, \ntaxes, and contingencies.

The Borrower for the Project will be the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. The \nMinistry  of  Finance  will  be  responsible  for  repayment  of  the  loan  and  will  provide  counterpart \nfunds  to  MOT  through  budgetary  allocations.  MOT  will  provide  the  loan  and  the  counterpart \nfunds to VEC through budgetary allocations. \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n\n25. \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project  will  be  MOT  and  the  Implementing  Agency \n(IA)  will  be  VEC.  MOT  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  project  implementation  and  formal \ncorrespondence  with  the  line  ministries,  provincial  governments,  and  ADB.  VEC  will  have \nresponsibility for day-to-day project implementation under MOT\u2019s supervision. VEC will set up a \nproject implementation unit (PIU) headed by an experienced project director and suitable staff. \nThe project management structure is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe overall implementation schedule for the Project is in Appendix 8. This illustrates the \n26. \nlinkages  between  the  Project  and  the  subsequent  highway  project.  Consultant  recruitment  will \nstart  in  January  2006.  Implementation  of  the  Project  will  commence  by  July  2006  and  be \ncompleted before September 2007. Construction of the highway should commence in late 2007 \nand  be  completed  by  the  end  of  2010,  subject  to:  (i)  the  outcome  of  the  Project,  (ii)  ADB\u2019s \napproval of a subsequent highway project, and (iii) completion of procurement, land acquisition \nand resettlement, and other pre-construction activities.   \n \n\n                                                 \n16 The allocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement will be presented in the equivalent of SDR 4,209,000, with \nreference only to total expenditure, in accordance with the policy on Cost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditures for \nAsian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach. \n\n\f3. \n\nProcurement \n\n27. \nThe  Project  will  not  require  civil  works  procurement.  Procurement  of  equipment  will  be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  (2004).  Since  the  items \nrequired  will  be  small  and  few  in  number\u2014mainly  vehicles,  computers,  design  software  and \nequipment,  testing  and  survey  equipment,  and  similar  items\u2014procurement  will  follow  local \ncompetitive bidding or direct purchase procedures. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n28. \nThe  consulting  services  will  be  implemented  by  an  international  consulting  firm  in \nassociation  with  domestic  consultants.  The  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  project \nmanagement,  design  of  high  standard  highways,  road  safety,  road  traffic  information  system, \ntransport  economics,  financial  analysis,  EIA,  resettlement  planning,  social  development \n(including indigenous peoples), and procurement assistance. Outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix  9.  The  consulting  services  will  include  amounts  for  surveys  of  all  types,  aerial \ntimely  project \nphotography,  equipment,  and  other \nimplementation. The duration of the consulting services will be about 15 months, although much \nof the last portion of this period will be for procurement assistance and will require relatively few \ninputs.  The  bulk  of  consulting  services  inputs  and  related  expenditure  will  be  during  the  initial \n9 months of the project period. \n \n29. \nVEC will recruit an international consulting firm for the consulting services using quality \nand  cost-based  selection  procedures,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2005),  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants. Full technical proposals will be used. The contract package is described \nin Appendix 10.   \n \n\nfor  effective  and \n\ninputs  essential \n\n5. \n\n Anticorruption  \n\n30. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government of Viet \nNam, MOT, and VEC. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the Loan Regulations \nand bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords  and  accounts  of  the  EA,  the  IA,  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n31. \nLoan  disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2001), and detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The loan proceeds will \nbe  disbursed  directly  to  the  consultants,  based  on  an  approved  contract  under  the  direct \npayment  procedure.  Payments  for  equipment  and  the  incremental  administration  cost  will  be \nmade  from  an  imprest  account  held  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  the  Government  and \nADB,  under  ADB\u2019s  imprest  account  procedure  as  shown  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  (2001).  The  initial  deposit  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  based  on  estimated \nexpenditures  for  the  first  6 months  of  the  project  implementation  or  $300,000,  whichever  is \nlower. The statement of expenditure procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nand  liquidate  advances  to  the  imprest  account  to  facilitate  project  implementation.  The  ceiling \nfor each payment under the statement of expenditure procedure is $50,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n32.  MOT will ensure that VEC maintains separate financial records and accounts adequate \nto  identify  financing  resources  received  and  project  expenditures,  including  goods, works,  and \nservices  financed  out  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  local  funds.  The  loan  accounts  and  related \nfinancial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an \nauditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  MOT  will  submit  annual  audited  reports  and  related  financial \nstatements to ADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n33. \nVEC  will  have  responsibility  for  day-to-day  project  implementation  and  managing  the \nconsulting  services,  including  timely  submission  of  reports  through  the  consultant\u2019s  project \nmanager.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB  will  conduct  at  least  three  defined  review  missions,  and  numerous  special  review \n34. \nmissions.  First,  an  inception  review  will  be  carried  out  to  address  issues  that  MOT,  VEC,  and \nthe consultant are encountering and are about to encounter, immediately after the consultant\u2019s \ninception  report  is  submitted.  Second,  a  midterm  review,  which  will  also  be  the  Fact-Finding \nMission  for  the  subsequent  highway  project,  will  be  undertaken  to  assess  overall  progress  in \nproject implementation and achievements, when reports of the detailed design study, economic \nand  financial  studies,  and  social  and  environmental  studies  are  completed.  Third,  a  project \ncompletion review mission will be fielded about 1 year after project completion. There will also \nbe special reviews as required to address issues that arise during project implementation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\nA. \n \n35. \nThe  proposed  highway,  to  be  constructed  based  on  the  outputs  of  the  Project,  will \nsupport  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poverty  reduction  program  through  enhanced  economic  growth  and  by \nproviding access for currently isolated communities to economic and social services. It will also \ncontribute  to  the  efficient  development  of  the  GMS,  by  strengthening  connectivity  with \nneighboring  countries  and  increasing  competitiveness.  The  highway  will  greatly  facilitate \ntransport  between  Kunming  and  Haiphong,  and  create  a  new  freight  transport  link  between \nYunnan province, Hanoi, and Haiphong port.   \n \n36. \nThe  Project  will  produce  direct  benefits  such  as:  (i)  preparing  the  subsequent  highway \nproject  to  high  technical  and  safeguards  standards;  (ii) implementing  the  subsequent  project \nwithout  unnecessary  delay;  and  (iii)  substantially  improving  VEC\u2019s  capability  for  project \nmanagement, detailed design of highways, procurement, and safeguard arrangements.  \n \n37. \nResettlement for the subsequent highway project could have an adverse impact on the \naffected  people,  specifically  on  ethnic  minority  groups,  who  are  vulnerable  to  change.  The \nproject  activities  could  bring  significant  social  and  economic  change,  which  could  be  both \npositive and negative. Once the highway is completed, HIV/AIDS and trafficking of women and \n\n\fProject Risks \n\nchildren  could  become  more  prevalent.  Appropriate  prevention  and  mitigation  planning  will  be \nincorporated in the Project to address issues related to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \nB. \n \n38. \nThe  main  risk  for  the  Project  is  delayed  implementation  because  of  slow  finalization  of \nthe  single  consulting  services  contract,  which  will  implement  the  Project.  This  is  being \naddressed  through  advance  procurement  action  for  the  Project\u2019s  consulting  services,  and  by \nproviding  MOT  and  VEC  with  specialist  support  for  the  consultant  selection  process  through \nanother TA project (footnote 5). \n \n39. \nDuring the construction phase, HIV/AIDS risks could increase in the areas around labor \ncamps  and  the  core  project  area.  Short  and  long-term  planning  to  prevent  and  mitigate \nHIV/AIDS  during  the  construction  and  post-construction  periods  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nProject. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n40. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nMOT  will  cause  VEC  to  prepare  an  EIA  and  a  Summary  EIA  (SEIA)  for  the \nsubsequent  highway  project,  which  will  include  an  environmental  management \nplan  with  adequate  public  consultation,  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  submit  them  to  ADB  for  approval.  MOT \nwill  ensure  that  the  contract  documents  for  the  subsequent  highway  project \ninclude  specific  measures  as  indicated  in  the  SEIA  and  EIA  and  in  accordance \nwith  ADB's  Environment  Policy  to  mitigate  negative  environmental  impacts \ncaused  by  the  construction  and  to  give  due  consideration  to  prevention  of \ndamage  to  the  natural  environment  in  the  design,  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance of the highway facilities. \n\nMOT  will  cause  VEC  to  prepare  an  RP  for  the  subsequent  highway  project  in \naccordance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(1995), and submit the RP to ADB for approval.  \n\nMOT  will  cause  VEC  to  prepare  and  implement  an  EMDP  for  the  subsequent \nhighway  project  if  impacts  on  the  ethnic  minorities  living  in  the  project  area  are \nsignificant.  The  determination  whether  the  EMDP  is  needed  and  its  preparation \nwill be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n\nDuring  project  implementation,  MOT  will  ensure  that  VEC  has  in  place  sound \nfinancial  management,  financial  reporting,  internal  controls  and  internal  auditing \nsystems acceptable to ADB. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n41. \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe following are conditions for loan effectiveness:  \n \n(i) \n\nthe  Government  approves  its  internal  feasibility  study  of  the  Noi  Bai-Lao  Cai \nHighway Project in accordance with Government regulations; and  \n\nVEC  has  completed  the  establishment  of  the  PIU  headed  by  an  experienced \ndirector and suitably staffed.  \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n42. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  4,209,000  to  the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater Mekong Subregion: Kunming-Haiphong Transport \nCorridor\u2500Noi  Bai-Lao  Cai  Highway  Technical  Assistance  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n\nJoseph B.

The  industry  and  construction  sector \naccounts for 40.0% of GDP and is the most rapidly developed sector, growing by 17.3% in 2003. \nIn  the  Northern  Economic  Triangle  Area\u2014including  Hanoi,  Hai  Duong,  Haiphong,  and  Quang \nNinh provinces\u2014heavy industries (e.g., steel and shipbuilding) and light industries (e.g., textiles, \nfootwear, machinery, and wooden products) are developed. The main driving forces behind the \nrapid growth are domestic private companies and foreign-invested companies in export-oriented \nbusinesses.  The  service  sector,  accounting  for  about  38.2%  of  GDP,  grew  by  12.3%  in  2003. \nThis  growth  was  mainly  driven  by  wholesale,  retail,  transport,  and  postal  services,  which \naccompany  improved  living  standards,  especially  in  large  cities.  The  tourism  industry  is  also \nbeing developed by easing visa requirements for foreign tourists. The agriculture, forestry, and \nfisheries  sectors,  accounting  for  about  21.8%  of  GDP,  grew  by  7.1%  in  2003,  largely  due  to \nhigher  export  prices.  Overall,  this  sector  has  an  international  comparative  advantage  in \nViet Nam.  To  continue  stable  and  strong  economic  growth,  a  high-standard  road  network \nconnecting cities and linking with neighboring countries and ports must be developed.  \n \nTable A2.1 shows the estimated number of vehicles registered in the project area, based \n2. \non data from the Viet Nam Registration and National Transport Safety Committee. Ownership of \nvehicles (including trucks) in the project area has sharply increased at a much higher rate than \nGDP growth. Elasticity of the growth rate of car ownership in the project area with respect to per \ncapita GDP is 3\u20137, except in the case of coach/bus in 2002. \n \n\nTable A2.1: Estimated Number of Vehicle Registered in the Project Area \n\n \n\nType of \nVehicle \n\nCar \n\nCoach/bus \n\nTruck \n\nItem \n\n1999 \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\nNumber of vehicles \nGrowth rate \nNumber of vehicles \nGrowth rate \nNumber of vehicles \nGrowth rate \n\n16,069\n\n  4,582\n\n15,327\n\n20,151\n25%\n  5,469\n19%\n18,245\n19%\n\n28,674\n42%\n  9,219\n69%\n34,661\n90%\n\n36,305\n27%\n  7,068\n(23%)\n42,333\n22%\n\n48,424 \n33% \n13,307 \n88% \n54,396 \n28% \n\n60,358\n25%\n15,345\n15%\n62,159\n14%\n\n  Sources: Viet Nam Registration and survey by Asian Development Bank.  \n \n3. \nTable  A2.2  shows  the  growth  rate  of  annual  average  daily  traffic  (AADT)  in  passenger \ncar  units  for  National  Highway  2.

The  major  causes  of  traffic  accidents  on  the  improved  roads  are \nspeeding  and  recklessness  of  drivers  and  motorcyclists,  as  well  as  local  people\u2019s  unchanged \nroad use. Also, the mixture of different vehicle types in road traffic is cause of the lack of road \nsafety and inefficient road traffic management. The Government established an interministerial \nNational Traffic Safety Program to address road safety initiatives and allocate roles and budget \nto  each  ministry  concerned.  It  is  also  promoting  traffic  enforcement,  a  road  traffic  safety \ncampaign,  and  regulation  on  the  sale  and  use  of  motorcycles  to  reduce  traffic  accidents,  but \nthere  have  been  no  tangible  effects  to  date. 1  Full  access-controlled  highways  (essentially \nexpressways) that provide high modality of long-distance traffic and restrict accessibility of local \npeople to the highways are necessary for safe road transport if vehicle ownership rises at twice \nthe expected rate of economic growth and income increase in Viet Nam. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe  existing  national  road  system  was  mainly  constructed  with  two  lanes,  and  a  small \npart  with  four  lanes.  According  to  the  government  traffic  estimate,  which  the  transport \ndevelopment  strategy  until  2020  was  based  on,  traffic  jams  are  inevitable  on  main  national \nroads. To support sustainable economic development, these roads should be widened or new \nroadways constructed to connect with important economic zones, large urban centers, industrial \nzones, and international borders. The Government assigned the Ministry of Transport (MOT) to \nprepare  a  master  plan  for  development  of  the  expressway  network.  The  basic  outline  of  the \nexpressway  master  plan  (EMP)  proposes  2  north-south  expressway  axes,  6  east-west \nexpressway axes, and 14 centripetal expressway axes. To complete development of EMP, MOT \nneeds to improve its knowledge of planning expressway networks and construction, institutional \ndevelopment,  financial  mobilization  and  debt  management,  and  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M) from other countries.  \n \nIn  the  draft  EMP,  a  1,346-km  expressway  will  be  constructed  during  the  first  stage \n6. \n(2005\u20132015) and a 1,357-km expressway during the second stage (2016\u20132025). The Noi Bai-\nLao  Cai  Highway\u2014part  of  this  network\u2014is  planned  in  the  first  stage.  The  capital  investment \nrequirement \nis  D205,767  billion \n($13 billion): D111,012 billion ($7 billion) for the first stage and D94,755 billion ($6 billion) for the \nsecond stage. The estimated construction cost per year is about $600 million\u2013$700 million.     \n \n7. \nADB  will  provide  MOT  with  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  on  the  Expressway \nNetwork Development Plan Project.2 The TA comprises development of a business plan for the \nVietnam  Expressway  Corporation  (VEC),  the  EMP,  and  public-private  partnership.  The  EMP \ncomponent  will  include  developing  proposals  for:  (i)  policy  and  criteria  for  expressway \nconstruction;  (ii)  route  (origin-destination);  (iii)  priority  (2006\u20132015,  2016\u20132025,  and  2025 \nonwards);  (iv)  technical  specifications;  (v) road  services  and  administrative  facilities;  (vi)  cost \nestimates at pre-feasibility level (construction, land acquisition and resettlement, and O&M); (vii) \n\nthe  planned  expressway  network \n\nfor  construction  of \n\n                                                 \n1   Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation.  2003.

VEC \n\nVietnam Expressway Corporation \n\n(i) \n\ninvestment,  construction  project  management,  maintenance,  and  toll  collection  of  the \nnational expressways; \n\n(ii)  developing  and  trading  in  such  services  as  rest  houses,  restaurants,  gas  stations, \n\n(iii) \n\nadvertisements, and construction materials along expressways; \ntechnical  consultancy  on  transportation  and  communication,  such  as  study  of  the  \ndevelopment  of  national  expressway  networks,  and  feasibility  study  and  design  of \neach expressway project; and  \n\n(iv)  study and development of service forms in areas adjacent to expressways.   \n\n \n9. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  provided  VEC  with  equity  amounting  to  D1,000  billion  ($63 \nmillion)  in  the  form  of:  (i)  transfer  of  D50  billion  ($3  million)  from  the  state  budget  to  VEC\u2019s \naccount, and (ii) selling toll fee collection right at Gie Bridge and Phu Dong toll plazas during the \n10-year period after 1 January 2005, amounting to D950 billion ($60 million). With 60 employees \n(as  of  May  2005),  VEC  has  established  financing  and  accounting,  planning  and  business, \nproject  technical,  and  administration  divisions.  VEC\u2019s  first  expressway  project  (Cau  Gie-Nin \nBinh) has a total project cost of D5,422 billion ($341 million). VEC financed this project by using \nall  its  equity  ($63  million)  and  issuing  a  government-guaranteed  bond  amounting  to \nD4,422 billion  ($278  million). 3 Since  all  VEC\u2019s  equity  will  be  spent  on  the  first  expressway \nproject,  it  has  to  request  additional  equity  from  the  Government  for  subsequent  expressway \nprojects  to  secure  its  financial  sustainability.  To  generate  funds  for  investment  in  expressway \nprojects,  VEC  issues  a  government-guaranteed  bond  and  wishes  to  receive  loans  from  donor \norganizations.  However,  VEC  has  yet  to  secure  the  budget  for  expressway  construction  and \ncomplete its business model, which ensures financially sustainable expressway projects. \n \nThe  business  model  development  component  under  the  TA  on  Expressway  Network \n10. \nDevelopment  Plan  Project,  will  review  the:  (i)  government  policies,  laws,  regulations,  decrees, \ncirculars,  and  charters  relevant  to  VEC;  (ii)  current  organizational  structure  of  VEC,  with  due \nconsideration  given  to  role  and  responsibilities  of  each  department  and  division  of  VEC, \nsegregation of duty, staffing, etc.; and (iii) VEC\u2019s future organizational development plan. With \nthe  objectives  of  promoting  institutional  efficiency  and  good  governance  in  VEC\u2014especially \nregarding financial management, accounting system, and auditing\u2014the study will recommend: \n(i) necessary  reforms  of  the  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks;  and  (ii)  appropriate  institutional \nsetup, including mission, objectives, functions of departments and divisions, regional branches, \nand performance specifications and targets. \n \nE. \n \n11. \nThe  current  toll  level  for  national  highways  is  shown  in  Table  A2.3,  based  on  the \nprinciple that toll revenue is used for road maintenance works only. Subject to approval by the \nMinistry of Finance, the toll level for expressways will be set at not more than double the current \ntoll level for general highways, based on a new concept that the toll revenue from expressways \n                                                 \n3   VEC has issued a bond in the amount of $230 million to date, but has not yet received loans from external donor \n\nToll Setting  \n\norganizations. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nwill be used for maintenance works, recovery of the capital cost (including interest repayment), \nand expansion of the expressway network. However, it is still unclear whether this toll level can \ncover  those  expenses.  Therefore,  the  toll  level  for  expressways  should  be  reexamined  in  the \nlight of financial requirements and toll sensitivity of potential expressway users. \n \n\nTable A2.3: Current Toll Level for National Highways \n(D per km) \n \n\nToll \n10,000 \n10,000 \n10,000 \n15,000 \n15,000 \n22,000 \n40,000 \n80,000 \n\nUnit Toll Rate \n   333 \n   333 \n   333 \n   500 \n   500 \n   733 \n1,333 \n2,667 \n\nVehicle \nMotorbike/Lambretta \nTourist Car/Jeep \nSmall Coach (<25 seats) \nBig Coach (>=25 seats) \nLight Truck (<2.5 tons) \nMedium Truck (>=2.5 tons, 2 axles)  \nHeavy Truck (>3 axles) \nContainer \nD = dong, km = kilometer. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \nA survey on the toll sensitivity of road users was carried out under TA 4050-VIE.4 Table \n12. \nA2.4  shows  percentage  of  use  of  the  Noi  Bai-Lao  Cai  Highway,  which  will  be  of  expressway \nstandard,  under  the  different  toll  rates.  For  the  Noi  Bai-Yen  Bai  section  where  travel  time \nreduction is low, elasticity of the percentage of highway use with respect to toll level is high.

Manila. \n\n \nThe  traffic  demand  forecast  for  the  Noi  Bai-Lao  Cai  Highway  consists  of:  (i)  natural \n2. \ngrowth traffic, (ii) traffic generated by construction of the highway, and (iii) traffic diverted to the \nKunming-Hanoi-Haiphong  route  from  other  routes  because  of  the  highway\u2019s  construction.  The \nnatural growth traffic increases from baseline traffic in 2005 in accordance with the traffic growth \nrate in Table A2.5. The generated traffic is assumed as 15% of the natural growth traffic, based \non the existing study. The major shippers in Kunming, Yunnan province currently use Shenzhen \nand  Guangzhou  ports  in  Guangdong  province,  and  Fancheng,  Qinzhou,  and  Beihai  ports  in \nGuangxi province, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The annual container output to and from \nKunming in 2005 is 213,000 20-foot units. As a result of an interview with the major shippers, \n10%  of  the  container  cargos  would  be  diverted  to  the  Kunming-Hanoi-Haiphong  route  due  to \nreduction in the travel distance. Table A3.2 shows the forecast daily traffic volume for the three \nsections of the highway under the assumption that the toll level will be double the current level. \n \nTable A3.2: Traffic Demand Forecast for the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway \n(passenger car unit per day) \n \n2015 \n28,822 \n20,420 \n  3,117 \n\nSection \nNoi Bai-Viet Tri \nViet Tri-Yen Bai \nYen Bai-Lao Cai \nSource:  ADB.  2005.

Manila. \n\n \n3. \nThe length of the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway is 256 km. Based on the above traffic volume \nforecast, lane configuration for the Noi Bai-Viet Tri and Viet Tri-Yen Bai section is initially four \nlanes but expandable to six lanes as traffic increases; and initially two lanes but expandable to \nfour  lanes  for  the  Yen  Bai-Lao  Cai  section.  The  total  project  cost  for  the  initial  highway \nconstruction  is  estimated  at  about  $620  million,  including  construction  cost,  consulting  service \ncost, land acquisition and resettlement cost, and physical and price contingencies.  \n \n4. \nEconomic and financial analysis was undertaken by comparing the with highway project \nand  without  highway  project  scenarios.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the \nhighway project is about 22.0%. The net present value of the highway project, using the social \ndiscount  rate  of  12%,  yields  $349  million.  Table  A3.3  summarizes  the  result  of  the  economic \nsensitivity  analysis.  Delay  in  project  implementation  has  the  most  impact  on  the  economic \nviability. However, even if there is a concurrent 10% increase of project cost, 10% decrease of \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\ntraffic demand, and 1 year delay in project implementation, the EIRR for the highway project is \nhigher  than  12%.  Table  A3.4  summarizes  the  results  of  the  financial  sensitivity  analysis. \nAssuming that 72% of the project cost is funded by ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and other \nloans, and the remaining 28% is funded by the Government of Viet Nam, the weighted average \ncost of capital (WACC) for the highway project is 6.0%. Similar to the economic viability, even if \nthere  is  a  10%  increase  in  project  cost,  10%  decrease  in  traffic  demand,  and  1  year  delay  in \nproject implementation, at the same time, the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is still higher \nthan the WACC. The highway project generates enough profit to recover the entire loan within \n14  years.  It  is  concluded  that  the  economic  and  financial  viability  of  the  highway  project  is \nrobust. \n \n\nTable A3.3: Economic Sensitivity Analysis \n(%) \n\nItem \n1.

Manila. \n\n \n5. \nAs  shown  in  Table  A2.4  of  Appendix  2,  the  traffic  demand  is  affected  by  the  toll  level. \nFigure  A3.1  indicates  the  impact  of  the  toll  level  on  EIRR  and  FIRR.  The  current  toll  level  for \npassenger cars is D1,000 per 30 km. EIRR rapidly declines as the toll increases, and falls below \n12%  when  the  toll  level  is  over  four  times  the  current  level.  The  current  toll  level  yields  FIRR \nlower  than  WACC,  therefore  the  highway  project  is  not  financially  viable.  From  the  financial \nperspective, the toll level of D2,000\u2013D4,000 per 30 km is appropriate and the optimal toll level is \nD3,000  per  30  km.  Taking  both  economic  and  financial  perspectives  into  account,  a  range  of \nD2,000\u2013D2,500 per 30 km is the best toll level to operate the Noi Bai-Lao Cai Highway.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n21 \n\nFigure A3: Impact of the Toll Level on EIRR and FIRR\n\nEIRR\n\nProject FIRR\n\nOwner FIRR\n\nWACC\n\nC\nC\nA\nW\nd\nn\na\n \n,\n\n \n\nR\nR\nF\n\nI\n\n \n,\n\nR\nR\nE\n\nI\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n1,000\n\n2,000\n\n3,000\n\n4,000\n\n5,000\n\nToll Level (D per 30 km)\n\nD  =  dong,  EIRR  =  economic  internal  rate  of  return,  FIRR  =  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  km  = \nkilometer, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource:  ADB.  2005.

The proportion of the population below \nthe poverty line has declined from around 59% in 1993 to 25% in 2005. The proposed target for the Five-Year Socio-\nEconomic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010  is  to  reduce  poor  households  to  15%\u201316%  by  2010.  While  significant  in \nterms of magnitude, progress in poverty reduction remains fragile, with a significant number of \u201cnear poor\u201d clustered \njust above the poverty line. To support the Government in pursuing balanced economic growth and poverty reduction, \nthe Country Strategy and Program Update 2006\u20132008 for Viet Nam and the Poverty Partnership Agreement between \nViet  Nam  and  ADB  emphasize  regional  cooperation  through  cross-border  trade  and  access  to  markets  within  the \nregion. Viet Nam and Yunnan province in the PRC are  experiencing rapid economic growth, centered on exports to \nworld  markets,  and  through  increasingly  bilateral  trade  in  agriculture,  aquatic,  mining,  and  industrial  products. \nSustained development requires modernization and improvement of physical infrastructure and associated services\u2014\ninfrastructure  that  accommodates  bilateral  trade  and  international  transit  traffic.  The  Kunming-Haiphong  Corridor  is \nrecognized  by  Viet Nam  and  the  PRC  as  a  strategic  asset  that  enables  accelerated  economic  growth  based  on \nbilateral  trade  and  transit  traffic. The  corridor  is  perceived  as  a  cornerstone  in  developing  the  economies  in  Yunnan \nprovince and northern Viet Nam. The Greater Mekong Subregion: Kunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor\u2013Noi Bai-Lao \nCai  Highway  Technical  Assistance  Project  (the  Project)  will  help  to  develop  the  subregional  transport  system  and \nimprove  inter-sectoral  linkages  through  the  development  of  an  economic  corridor.  Remoteness  and  disconnection \nhave  been  identified  as  factors  for  poor  people\u2019s  inability  to  benefit  from  economic  growth.  Improved  transport \ninfrastructure  is  critical  for  sustained  rapid  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  and  will  also  contribute  to \nregionally  balanced  and  equitable  economic  growth  by  stimulating  agriculture  production,  increasing  access  to \nemployment opportunities, and facilitating better access to social services.  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nFollowing ADB\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004), projects classified as general intervention \nno longer require project level poverty assessments. However, social assessments will be prepared for resettlement, \nethnic minority groups, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking, as they represent significant risks for implementation of the \nProject.  \n \nIn addition to social and economic data related to resettlement plan and an EMDP (Appendix 9), social assessment \ndata will include: (i) the potential impact of the Kunming-Haiphong highway on social change for various ethnic groups \nin the project area, (ii) employment opportunities, (iii) movement of goods, (iv) reduction of transport costs associated \nwith  transportation  on  the  provincial  road  networks,  (v)  change  in  family  farm  production  and  its  potential  impact  on \nwomen,  and  (vi)  access  to  social  service  delivery.  Social  analysis  will  include  the  potential  negative  impact  of \nresettlement on various ethnic groups, risks of HIV/AIDS spreading, and human trafficking. Trafficking of women and \nchildren  has  become  a  serious  problem  since  the  1990s.  In  the  provinces  located  in  Red  River  Delta,  trafficking  of \nwomen  has  increased  due  to  a  number  of  road  links  and  commune  border  with  the  PRC.  Assessment  of  HIV/AIDS \nand human trafficking will include: (i) the present situation of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in the project areas; (ii) \ntype  and  level  of  vulnerability  of  the  population  along  the  proposed  highway  to  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking \n(disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, age, type of occupation, mobility, etc.); and (iii) recommendation for activities to \nprevent and mitigate the impacts. The social assessment will also: (i) review existing anti-HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking \nprograms of the Government, donors, and nongovernment  organizations  and recommendation for relevant linkages; \nand  (ii)  assess  the  capacity  building  training  needs  of  relevant  agencies  for  anti-HIV/AIDS  and  anti-trafficking  (law \nenforcement authority in the boarder areas). The social assessment will also focus on the environmental issues and \npossible negative impacts on the livelihood of the poor and ethnic minority groups, whose lives largely depend on the \nforest and its products.   \n \nThe core analysis will be prepared from both primary and secondary data. Primary data will be collected from selected \nproject  areas  through  sample  survey  and  participatory  appraisal.  Secondary  data  will  include  existing  data  such  as \ncensus, national socioeconomic surveys, and available HIV/AIDS and human trafficking related data. \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n   No \n\n   No  \n\n   Yes \n\n   Yes               \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nDuring  the  early  stage  of  feasibility  study  of  the  Kunming-Haiphong  Transport  Corridor  Project  (TA  4050-VIE), \nconsultations were held with ethnic minority groups and various government agencies. During the fact-finding for the \nTA project, discussion was held with the executing agency and stakeholders from other relevant agencies. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA  participatory  stakeholder  analysis  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  economic  (distributional  assessment),  social, \nresettlement, EMDP, and gender analysis. The stakeholder analysis under the economic and social assessments will \nbe both quantitative and qualitative. For land acquisition  and resettlement issues, individual and group consultations \nwill  be  undertaken  with  affected  people  at  the  village,  hamlet,  and  commune  level.  Separate  consultation  will  be \nundertaken  with  affected  minority  groups  with  regard  to  resettlement  issues.  The  stakeholder  analysis  will  include \nassessment of human trafficking and HIV/AIDS. The participatory strategy will include a grassroots level mechanism \nfor  public  information  disclosure  of  compensation  and  resettlement  issues,  and  grievance  procedures  for  affected \npersons from various ethnic groups. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe socioeconomic data will be disaggregated by gender and various ethnic groups. Data on resettlement and ethnic \nminority  groups  and  data  on  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  will  be  disaggregated  by  gender.  A  project  specific \ngender  strategy  will  be  prepared  and  gender  related  strategies  will  be  incorporated  in  the  resettlement  plan  and \nEMDP.  Socioeconomic  assessment  will  examine  the  extent  to  which  the  expressway  would  have  an  impact  on \nwomen\u2019s social and economic condition in the project area. Data on social assessment will include information on: (i) \nthe  extent  to  which  land  acquisition  and  relocation  will  impact  on  women\u2019s  social  condition  and  economic  activities, \nand (ii) available social services and women\u2019s access to social services (by various ethnic groups). The capacity of the \nExecuting Agency and leaders of the commune and Women\u2019s Union will be assessed in terms of implementation of a \ngender strategy and programs related to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking.  \n \nThe gender strategy will include specific activities to ensure project benefits for women. It will ensure that: (i) women \ndo  not  become  more  vulnerable  because  of  relocation;  (ii)  women  are  involved  in  the  consultation  process  for \npreparation  of  loss  of  inventory,  and  the  grievance  process  on  resettlement  and  compensation  issues;  (iii)  women \nretain access to land or land title during resettlement; (iv) potential social problems in the projects are addressed; and \n(v)  women  fully  participate  in  programs  related  to  HIV/AIDS  prevention  and  human  trafficking.  A  relevant  capacity \nbuilding  training  program  will  be  developed  for  men  and  women  officials  of  the  Executing  Agency;  leaders  of  the \ncommunes;  and  provincial,  district,  and  commune  level  Women\u2019s  Unions,  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan and EMDP, and monitoring of project activities. The gender strategy will include activities to increase \nwomen\u2019s participation in community level monitoring of implementation resettlement activities, EMDP, HIV/AIDS and \nhuman  trafficking  related  program  activities.  Community  level  monitoring  and  consultation  for  land  acquisition, \ncompensation  price,  and  relocation  and  implementation  of  the  EMDP  will  include  mechanisms  for  community \ninvolvement  and  participation,  as  outlined  in  the  government  decrees  on  regulation  for  participatory  investment \nsupervision, and grassroots democracy. Gender disaggregated monitoring indicators by various ethnic groups will be \ndeveloped to assess the impact of resettlement and the expressway. Monitoring indicators will also include monitoring \nof HIV/AIDS and trafficking activities in the project area. \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \n \n \n\n    Yes \n\n  No \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n25 \n\n \n\nE.

Affordability will increase \nthrough improved economic opportunities.  \n\nThe highway project will not have direct impact on labor \nretrenchment. It will create wage employment \nopportunities during construction. The construction \ncontract award will include provision of fair wages, equal \nwages for men and women for equal work, and basic \nfacilities in the construction camp. \nThe presence of various ethnic minority groups in the \nmountainous area is one of the main characteristics of the \nproject area. Ethnic minority groups are mainly \nconcentrated in Yen Bai and Lao Cai provinces where \nthey account for 50.4% and 66.9% respectively of the \npopulation. Ethnic minority groups are present, especially \nin the uplands, but also on the plain, on the right and left \nbank of the Red River and along National Highway 70. \nEthnic minority groups are vulnerable to change. Project \nactivities could bring significant social and economic \nchange, which could be positive and negative. The \nresettlement of the highway project could have an \nadverse impact on ethnic minority groups. The EMDP will \nbe prepared to mitigate the adverse impact and ensure \nthat they can cope with changes and improve their \nlivelihood in the new settlement area. \nThe highway might increase cross-border trafficking of \ngirls/women. The highway could become a new pathway \nfor the diseases. Mobile groups (such as drivers and \nguides of tour buses, truck drivers, and workers) are \nparticularly vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases \nand HIV/AIDS, and are also a conduit for these diseases. \nDuring the construction phase, HIV/AIDS risks can \nincrease around the construction camps and in the core \nproject areas. Specific activities will be incorporated in the \nEMDP and gender strategy, as well as a mass and \ntargeted awareness campaign on human trafficking and \nHIV/AIDS, to address trafficking and HIV/AIDS issues. A \ncommunity mobilization strategy for awareness campaign \nwill be incorporated in the campaign. A capacity building \ntraining program will be designed for the relevant \nstakeholders to implement HIV/AIDS and trafficking \nrelated activities.
