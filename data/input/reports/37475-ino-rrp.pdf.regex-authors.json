The  Project  will  cover  primary,  junior,  and  senior \nsecondary private and public madrasahs in 27 poor districts of \nCentral  Java,  East  Java,  and  South  Sulawesi  provinces.  The \nProject will benefit 120,000 students in 500 madrasahs. \nThe Project will support a mixture of demand- and supply-side \ninterventions to enable project madrasahs to (i) improve teacher \nprofessionalism;  (ii)  upgrade  teaching\u2013learning  resources  and \nfacilities; (ii) increase their internal efficiency; and (iii) strengthen \ntheir governance, management, and sustainability. The Project \nwill help madrasahs meet national education standards according \nto the needs identified in madrasah development plans, through a \nrange of interventions, including teacher qualification upgrading \nand professional certification, provision of substitute teachers, and \nteaching skills development; upgrading or expansion of facilities \n(classrooms,  libraries,  and  laboratories);  and  provision  of \nteaching\u2013learning materials. These interventions will be selected \nby individual madrasahs according to their development needs.  \nThe  Project  will  enhance  the  internal  efficiency  of  project \nmadrasahs  by  increasing  enrollment,  decreasing  dropout  and \nrepetition  rates,  and  increasing  completion  rates  at  all  levels \nthrough remedial and scholarship programs, particularly for poor \nand  female  students.  Governance,  management,  and  financial \nsustainability  of  project  madrasahs  will  be  improved  through \ntraining and performance-based madrasah development planning \nand  management,  and  advocacy  programs  to  enhance  the \nperception  of  madrasah  education  quality  and  encourage \nstakeholder participation to ensure better resource mobilization \nand transparency. \n   \nRationale  Under the new national education law (20/2003), madrasahs were \nformally integrated into the national education system as equal \npartners with general (secular) schools. To further this integration, \nParliament recently issued a directive to the Ministry of National \nEducation (MONE) (covering general education) and the Ministry ", "ii   \nof  Religious  Affairs  (MORA)  (covering  Islamic  education)  to \nformulate a common policy and strategic framework for national \neducation development by the end of 2006.  \n \nEnsuring a better madrasah education system and its continued \nsustainability  is  pivotal  to  achieving  the  Government\u2019s  key \neducation goal of universal 9-year basic education, as well as the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDG) for education and gender \nequity. Demand for madrasah education is growing: it constitutes \n13% of total primary and secondary enrolments, in predominantly \nprivate, community-based institutions. Madrasahs are particularly \nattractive to the poorest rural students, who are also the hardest \nto reach, and so can help meet MDG targets. Madrasahs also \nattract more girls than general schools and so will be key in the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to reach gender equity in senior secondary \neducation and beyond.  \nThe  quality  of  madrasah  education  is  low.  Many  madrasahs, \nespecially private ones, will be unable to meet the new national \neducation  standards  for  learning  outcomes  and  the  teaching\u2013\nlearning  environment  (e.g.,  qualified  teachers,  good  facilities, \navailable textbooks) without additional investment. The Project will \nmeet  the  transitional cost  of  attaining  these new  standards  in \nselected  poor  madrasahs  through  a  mixture  of  supply-  and \ndemand-side support. This will help secure continued demand for \neducation in these madrasahs. At the same time, the Project will \nsupport policy dialogue that ensures the effective use of projected \nincreased Government funding for madrasahs, and the long-term \nfinancial sustainability of a better madrasah system.  \nThe Project will support teacher upgrading, instructional materials, \nrehabilitation  or  expansion  of  facilities,  student  scholarships, \nschool  governance,  and  management  development,  to  be \nfinanced  through  school-managed  block  grants.  These \ninterventions are recognized as key determinants of quality and \nstandards  improvement,  as  set  out  in  the  national  education \nstandards. \n \nThe  Project  will  promote  and  enable  more  results-oriented \nplanning  and  management  systems  at  all  levels,  through  a \ncombination of organizational and network development at school, \ncommunity,  district,  provincial,  and  central  levels.  This  will \nfacilitate coordinated planning and management in what remains \na comparatively centralized system. At the same time, the Project, \nthrough  policy  dialogue  and  assurances,  will  help  harmonize \nstrategy, programming, and financing between the two ministries. \nIn this way, the Project will pursue the Government\u2019s goal of a \nnational  education  system  of  equal  partners,  with  madrasah \nstudents, even those in poor private madrasahs, having the same \nopportunities as students in general schools.  \n   \n \n ", "  iii\n \nImpact and Outcome  In partnership with the Government and other funding agencies, \nthe Project is expected to help increase the levels of educational \nattainment and productivity of new workers and the rates of formal \nemployment and household incomes. The project objective is to \nimprove madrasah education, resulting in better student learning \noutcomes in core subject areas, raised madrasah accreditation \nlevels, and enhanced perceptions of madrasah education quality \nby parents and the community. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $71.4  million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $0.1 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  to  be  $71.4  million \nequivalent.  It  is  proposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  provide  a  loan  of  $50  million  from  its  Special  Fund \nresources, with a maturity term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization   1 April 2007 to 30 September 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2012 \nCompletion \n   \nImplementation  The Executing Agency for the Project will be MORA, with the \nArrangements   Directorate  General  of  Islamic  Education  responsible  for  the \noverall management of project implementation. A project steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  will  be  established  to  guide  the  CPMU  on \ngeneral policy directions, inter-sectoral coordination and strategic \ndirections. The PSC will comprise representatives of the Ministry \nof  Finance,  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n(Bappenas), MONE and MORA. The secretary general of MORA \nwill chair the PSC. The director of the Directorate of Madrasah \nEducation will be the PSC secretary. The PSC will be supported \nby  a  project  technical  committee  (PTC)  that  will  consist  of \nrepresentatives from MOF, MONE, and MORA. The PTC will be \nchaired by the Director of Religious Affairs in Bappenas. A central \nproject management unit and three provincial coordinating units \nwill be established, assisted by project consultants, advisers, and \nfacilitators to provide technical and implementation support. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Religious Affairs \n   \nProcurement   All ADB-financed procurement for goods, services, and works for \nthe  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time). Supply \ncontracts  for  goods  and  services  estimated  at  more  than \n$100,000 up to $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of national \ncompetitive  bidding,  while  contract  packages  of  $100,000  and \nbelow  will  follow  shopping  procedures.  Madrasah  civil  works \n ", "iv   \ncontracts for rehabilitation of classrooms, libraries, and computer \nand science laboratories, which are expected to cost less than the \nequivalent of $30,000, will be awarded on the basis of community \nparticipation. For remote madrasahs with only one supplier, direct \ncontracting  is  allowed.  For  economy  and  efficiency,  several \nmadrasahs  could  pool  their  procurement  for  more  competitive \nbidding. \n   \nConsulting Services  All consultants to be financed from the proceeds of the loan will \nbe selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). Project \nimplementation  consultants  (60  international  and  183  national \nperson-months)  will  be  hired  through  a  firm  of  international \nconsultants in association with national consultants, using quality- \nand cost-based selection. The main areas of expertise will be \nteacher  professional  development,  madrasah  leadership \ndevelopment,  madrasah-based  management,  teaching\u2013learning \nassessment and quality assurance, performance management, \nand  project  management.  Consultants  for  monitoring  and \nevaluation  studies  and  training  programs  will  be  hired  using \nconsultants\u2019  qualifications  selection  or  single  source  selection \nmethods. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 10. \n   \nProject Benefits  The  Project  will  raise  education  standards  in  around  500 \nand Beneficiaries  madrasahs,  giving  almost  120,000  poor  students,  including \naround 60,000 girls, the immediate benefit of better education. If \nthe improved standards are sustained over 10\u201315 years, roughly \n300,000  poor  students  are  estimated  to  benefit  directly  from \nbetter education, and about 120,000 students will benefit directly \nfrom improved academic credentials, leading to better access to \npost-secondary  education  and  formal  paid  employment.  The \nProject  will  directly  and  indirectly  benefit  about  150,000 \nhouseholds, mainly in the lowest poverty quintile, through fee cost \nsavings of about Rp600 billion over 10\u201315 years, resulting from \nmore  resources  flowing  to  private  madrasahs  as  a  result  of \nadvocacy and school capacity building.  \nThe direct household benefits include the opportunity to redirect \nsavings to food, shelter, and health care, as well as to save for \nsenior  and  post-secondary  education  costs,  which  are  largely \nself-financed. Other indirect benefits to these households include \n(i) improved family health and nutrition, and school attendance; \n(ii) future reduced fertility rates; (iii) greater likelihood of educated \nmothers sending their daughters to school; (iv) reduced risk of \nvulnerability  to  HIV/AIDS  and  child  labor;  and  (v)  greater \nopportunities for jobs and other income-generating activities.  \nOther direct beneficiaries will include  (i) about 2,200 teachers \nreceiving  professional  upgrading  to  degree  level  and/or \nprofessional certification; (ii) about 5,300 teachers and principals \nreceiving  short-term  pedagogical  training;  (iii)  about  2,500 \nmadrasah  school  committee  members  receiving  governance ", "  v\nawareness raising; (iv) about 500 central, provincial, and district \nMORA  technical  staff  members  receiving  various  forms  of \ntraining; and (v) about 10,000 local tradesmen and shopkeepers, \nwho will directly benefit from income generation related to the \nblock-grant  system.  In  the  long  term,  the  upgraded  and  fully \nqualified teachers will be eligible for large salary increases. The \ntrained  principals  and  teachers  will  have  enhanced  promotion \nprospects, with potential salary gains.  \nMedium-  and  long-term  benefits  include  increased  internal \nefficiency and progression rates, which will result in cost savings \nfor parents. Long-term benefits also include increased access for \nmadrasah graduates to formal paid employment and consequent \ngrowth in incomes for the predominantly poor households that \nsend their children to low-cost private madrasahs.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  A short-to-medium-term risk is insufficient capacity, especially in \nprivate madrasahs, to manage resources, including project block \ngrants,  to  improve  education.  Insufficient  transparency  and \naccountability in madrasah financial management and accounting \nprocesses  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  supporting  Government \ncommitment to governance reforms through technical support for \nstrengthened  financial  management  and  reporting  in  project \nmadrasahs,  along  with  public  disclosure;  (ii)  a  focus  on \nstrengthening community governance and accountability through \ncommunity  involvement;  and  (iii)  external  technical  assistance \n(TA) for strengthening performance monitoring and evaluation. \nThe  financial  management  capacity  assessment  indicates  that \nMORA\u2019s  financial  management  systems  and  procedures  meet \nADB requirements. \nA related risk is that project financing and anticipated increased \ngovernment resources will lead to a drop in voluntary parental \ncontributions.  The  Project  aims  to  mitigate  these  risks  by \nproviding  principal  training,  and  introducing  school-based \nmanagement,  results-based  programming,  and  a  system  of \nquality  improvement,  alongside  transparent  accounting  of  all \navailable resources.  \nProject schools may find it difficult to retain the teaching staff \nupgraded  over  the  Project  given  their  low  salaries.  The \nGovernment is planning to introduce substantial incentives and \nsubsidies  for  teachers  from  2007,  including  those  in  private \nmadrasahs. The risk that physical facilities upgraded under the \nProject  will  not  be  maintained  is  reduced  through  training  in \npreventive maintenance, compulsory for all madrasahs receiving \nfunds to improve their facilities. \nAnother  medium-term  risk  is  that  proposed  community \ninvolvement in madrasah development planning may undermine \nthe cooperation of the benevolent foundation (yayasan) head, the \nlocal  religious  leader  (kiai)  and/or  the  principal.  Advocacy \nprograms will be carried out to convince the yayasan head, kiai \n ", "vi   \nand principals of the benefits of community involvement. \nA key assumption is sustained economic growth and protection of \nthe  projected  increases  in  public  expenditure  on  education, \nincluding for public and private madrasahs. A related assumption \nis that MORA and the madrasah system will plan and mobilize the \nanticipated additional resources for madrasahs and spend the \nfunds effectively. The Project incorporates specific policy dialogue \nmeasures  and  assurances  to  offset  these  potential  risks, \nalongside a wide-ranging information campaign outlining these \nnew sources of funds and performance-related eligibility criteria. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  ADB will provide a TA grant in the amount of $995,000 from the \nADB-funded  TA  program.  The  TA  will  support  independent \nmonitoring and evaluation of the project\u2019s programs, activities, \noutputs, outcomes and benefits, and will contribute to the Project \nby  raising  public  confidence  in  the  quality  and  efficiency  of \nmadrasah education by issuing reliable performance monitoring \nreports (details of the TA are in Appendix 11). The Government \nwill contribute $305,000 to the cost of the TA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "(cid:49)(cid:49)(cid:48)(cid:32)(cid:111)(cid:32)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:39)(cid:69)

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.   Performance Indicators and Analysis   \n \n2.  Recent analysis highlights that accelerated education reform is central to implementing \nthe broader development policies of the Government. Economic growth has been 4\u20136% over \nthe past 5 years and is projected to reach 6\u20137% in 2006\u20132008. As part of public financial \nmanagement reform, linked to reductions in oil subsidies, the Government is committed to \nallocating a greater share of public expenditure to pro-poor education policy and program \nreforms. The Government recognizes that improving rural access to primary and secondary \neducation  is  key  to  enabling  rural  economic  growth  and  increasing  jobs  for  the  poor.  In \nparticular,  the  shortage  of  high-quality  secondary  and  post-secondary  school  graduates  is \nrecognized  as  a  key  factor  in  the  slow  development  of  rural  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises.1,2 About 2 million\u20133 million school leavers are projected to join the labor force \nannually over the next 5 years and the number of unemployed 15\u201324-year-olds is expected to \nrise  faster  in  rural  areas.  Expanding  rural  secondary  education  opportunities  is  central  to \naddressing these concerns.  \n \n3.  Policy harmonization across sector agencies and providers in a large education system \nis critical. About 47 million students are enrolled in the 12-year national education system, of \nwhich  the  first  9  years  (basic  education)  are  compulsory.  The  education  system  is  the \nresponsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  National  Education  (MONE),  which  develops  the  overall \neducation policy and strategic framework. MONE also manages and regulates the general \nschool system, which was decentralized to the districts in 2001. The smaller Islamic education \nsector, which includes madrasahs, is managed and regulated by the Ministry of Religious Affairs \n(MORA)  within  the  national  policy  framework,  although  it  develops  specific  policies  and \nstrategies for madrasahs. MORA and the madrasah sector have not been decentralized.  \n \n4.  In both sectors a strong public\u2013private partnership aims to achieve the Government\u2019s \npriorities of universal basic education, higher quality and relevance, and expanded participation \nin junior and senior secondary education. While the country has expanded access to primary \neducation, poor education quality combined with low participation rates in secondary education \nremains an important concern for the Government as it strives to remain competitive with its \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) neighbors.  \n \n5.  Net enrolment rates have stagnated over the past 5 years at around 93% for primary \nand 65% for junior secondary education. About 686,000 primary school students drop out \nannually, including 81,000 from madrasahs. The transition rate from primary to junior secondary \n                                                 \n1  World Bank.

", "2   \nschools stands at 88%, with about 500,000 students who have completed primary education  \nnot continuing on to  secondary school every year. It is estimated that 1.75 million children aged \n13\u201315 are not in junior secondary schooling. Increasing parental contributions have been the \nmajor constraint on access. Disparities among income groups exist in junior secondary schools \nbut are more pronounced in senior secondary schools, where only 42% of the relevant age \ngroup is enrolled. \n \n6.  Securing  an  efficient  and  effective  madrasah  system  is  an  important  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy for achieving its key education policy of universal 9-year basic education \nand the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for basic education and gender equity. The \nnew  education  law  emphasizes  the  importance  of  diversifying  partnerships  in  the  drive  to \nachieve universal basic education through the private sector. MONE and MORA are major \nproviders. This strong and growing public\u2013private partnership, including a proven willingness of \nparents to contribute, represents a strong foundation for reforms.3 As the madrasah sector \nattracts a substantial proportion of students from the poorest families\u2014the group that has \nproved hardest to draw into basic education\u2014it can complement Government efforts to capture \nand retain these hard-to-reach children. The biggest challenge, and opportunity, lies in junior \nsecondary education, where it has been most difficult to increase enrolments, and where the \nmadrasah presence is strongest. The madrasahs also provide the opportunity to enroll more \ngirls. Some girls in madrasahs would not be in school at all if madrasahs were not available, \nespecially after primary school.  \n \n7.  In  2004/05,  there  were  6  million  madrasah  students,  or  13%  of  the  total  student \npopulation. At the junior secondary level, madrasahs accommodate over 20% of all students. \nMore than 90% of madrasahs are private, established by benevolent foundations (yayasan) or \nlocal religious leaders (kiai) in rural areas lacking schools or other education opportunities, and \nthey generally have strong community support. Most students are rural poor: 84% of their \nparents have incomes below the regional poverty level. Girls constitute just over half of all \nmadrasah  students,  and  a  higher  proportion  at  higher  levels,  and  are  never  segregated. \nMadrasah  students  follow  the  national  curriculum,  sit  the  national  examinations,  and  can \ntransfer to general schools. Madrasah ibtidaiyah (MI) are equivalent to general primary schools \n(grades 1\u20136), madrasah tsanawiyah (MT) to general junior secondary schools (grades 7\u20139), and \nmadrasah aliyah (MA) to general senior secondary schools (grades 10\u201312).  \n \n8.  The Government and external funding agencies give substantial support to general \neducation, but investment in madrasahs, especially private ones, has remained low. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  two  previous  madrasah  projects  supported  mainly  public \nmadrasahs, which have improved, but private madrasahs continue to rank poorly on all key \nquality indicators. In the 2006 final examinations, madrasah students trailed behind general-\nschool students in almost all subjects in almost all provinces, with the biggest disparities at the \ntop of the score range. Enabling improved education governance and accountability is another \nkey issue, particularly in relation to decentralization, where roles and responsibilities require \nfurther  refinement.  School  and  madrasah  committees,  granted  more  powers  under \ndecentralization, have been slow to exercise greater authority. A summary sector analysis is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n3 Ministry of National Education (MONE). 2006. Education Strategic Plan 2005\u20132009. Jakarta. ", "      3 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities   \n \n9.  Building on High-Level Commitment to Reform. Current high-level ownership and \nleadership of accelerated education reform constitutes a major opportunity to support education \ndevelopment. Comprehensive sector performance assessments and significant organizational \nchanges are under way. These processes have been in direct response to direction from the \nPresident. A key feature of the ongoing policy reforms is a greater focus on institutional reform, \nmore  pro-poor  education  financing  policies,  and  more  results-oriented  performance \nmanagement and monitoring systems.  \n \n10.  The growing evidence of commitment to policy reform has given Parliament greater \nconfidence  in  allocating  more  public  resources  to  education.  Of  Government  spending  on \neducation, about  65%  is  channelled  through  regional  budgets  and  the  remainder  centrally \nmanaged.  Total  Government  spending  (including  external  funding  support)  constitutes  an \nestimated 15.0% of Government current expenditure and about 2.6% of gross domestic product \n(GDP).4 Centrally managed education expenditure will rise from Rp46.9 trillion in 2006 (9.9% of \nthe  national  budget)  to  Rp51.3  trillion  in  2007  (10.3%).  Further  substantial  increases  are \nplanned from 2007 onward, to be based on a joint national strategic plan being developed by \nMONE and MORA. The share of the MORA education budget in the central education budget is \nexpected to be maintained at 21% up to 2011, while the private sector share of the MORA \neducation budget is projected to increase from 19% in 2006 to 24% in 2011. This figure will \nincrease further as it excludes new programs planned for 2007 that will disproportionately \nbenefit the private sector.  \n \n11.  Along  with  these  budget  increases,  increased  levels  of  external  assistance  are \nanticipated to be required over the medium term to cover the transitional costs of the madrasah \neducation reform program, phased and scaled in line with projected increases in Government \nfunding. \n \n12.  Securing the Comparative Advantage of the Madrasah System. Parents\u2019 demand for \nmadrasah education is growing and sustained. Lower fees, fee waivers, and a secure, religious \nenvironment are attractive to many families, especially among the poor, and for girls. The high \nproportion of private madrasahs also encourages strong community participation in managing \nand  financing  education,  including  many  voluntary  and  low-paid  teachers.  Current \ndevelopments provide a unique opportunity to secure these advantages and to establish a well-\nfinanced and high-quality madrasah system. The national Government\u2019s program to subsidize \nschool operating budgets, introduced in 2005, increases private madrasah funding, and the new \nteachers' law provides an opportunity to upgrade teachers\u2019 qualifications. Recent changes to \nstrengthen  MORA\u2019s  senior  management,  the  development  of  a  new  government  financing \npolicy, and the initiation of a MORA strategic framework for 2006\u20132015 further strengthen this \nopportunity. \n \n13.  There is a strong correlation between teacher academic qualifications, overall school \neffectiveness,  and  improved  learning  outcomes.  Improvement  of  madrasah  education  is \nconstrained by a lack of qualified teachers in core subject areas. Almost all MI teachers (83%) \nlack an undergraduate degree, and only 2% have a degree in core teaching subject areas. In \nMT, about 55% of teachers have a degree but almost all are teaching subjects for which they \nwere not trained. An immediate teacher upgrading and subject retraining program is critical for \n                                                 \n4  MONE. 2006. Education Strategic Plan 2005\u20132009. Financing Plan. Jakarta. \n    World Bank. 2005. World Bank Projections, CGI Meeting. Jakarta. \n ", "4   \nsecuring the reputation of madrasahs to meet national student performance standards. Women \nalmost equal men in MIs but are in the minority in MTs and MAs and are poorly represented in \nmanagerial positions. Only 13% of madrasah principals are women. \n \n14.  Access to instructional materials and a well-maintained physical environment are also \nkey determinants of quality improvement. Government policy calls for textbooks to be provided \nfor every child, but private MTs and MAs have less than 10% of the books required. Education \nfacilities  are  an  associated  constraint,  with  a  significant  proportion  of  madrasahs  in  poor \ncondition and with limited access to science and computer laboratories. Selective rehabilitation \nof madrasah facilities is a priority to maintain their attraction to parents. \n \n15.  The madrasah education sector assessment found that a perceived lack of quality and \nrelevance of MA schooling was a significant constraint on the transition rate from MT to MA, and \npossibly from MI into MT. Yearly, 20\u201325% of all MI graduates and over 30% of MT graduates \nfail to continue to the next educational level. Within cycles, the dropout rate has declined \nsignificantly since 2000, partly because of the introduction of a small scholarship program and \nbenevolent yayasan, which often support poor children. Repetition rates are high at the early \nprimary level (3\u20136%). \n \n16.  International research has found that results-oriented governance and management, \nincluding  school  leadership  that  focuses  on  excellence,  is  key  to  improving  educational \noutcomes. Parental perceptions that schools are well managed is a critical factor in how parents \njudge  school  effectiveness.  District  supervisory  support  systems  are  underdeveloped,  and \ndistrict management of madrasahs is hindered by too few district staff, low capacity, and lack of \nresources. The new school accreditation systems and proposed staff development programs \nprovide an opportunity to address these issues. The capacity and commitment to implementing \nmadrasah-based management is variable. Communities are represented through madrasah \ncommittees that are mandated to take part in planning, budgeting, and financial accountability, \nbut  not  all  private  madrasahs  have  these  committees.  Madrasah  principals  need  skills \nupgrading to be effective school leaders and managers (73% of MI and 37% of MT principals \nare unqualified). The madrasah sector is poorly represented on district education councils, \nresulting in variable levels of support from local government.  \n \nC.  Government Strategy and Policy \n \n17.  A goal of the Medium-Term Development Plan 2005\u20132009 is to increase access to \nquality education. The plan targets increased enrolment rates in basic and senior secondary \neducation and improved education quality. These goals are reflected in the Education Strategic \nPlan 2005\u20132009 developed by MONE, which sets out the major policy and strategic priorities for \nthe next 5 years, including (i) achieving universal access to 9 years of basic education by 2009; \n(ii) expanding net enrolment rates in post-basic education; (iii) raising education standards and \nrelevance at all levels, including efficient teacher preparation and deployment; (iv) strengthening \nresults-oriented education governance and management systems; (v) improving the results \norientation  of  sector  planning  and  monitoring  systems;  (vi)  harmonizing  public\u2013private \npartnerships; (vii) ensuring that graduates are regionally competitive; (viii) stimulating a more \ndemand-side response to program implementation; and (ix) strengthening quality assurance \nand monitoring systems, particularly school-community and local government accountability \nmechanisms.  As  madrasahs  are  part  of  the  national  education  system,  these  overarching \npriorities apply equally to MORA. Recently, Parliament called for the development of a national \nstrategic plan to be prepared jointly by MORA and MONE, to reflect these priorities in one \nnational education framework.  ", "      5 \nD.  Asian Development Bank Sector Strategy \n \n18.  The Project supports the country strategy and program (CSP) 2006\u20132009 by helping \nimprove people\u2019s welfare through accelerated attainment of the MDGs. The CSP identifies \nspecific education sector outcomes: (i) improved expansion and equity; (ii) better education \nquality, relevance, and competitiveness; and (iii) enhanced governance, accountability, and \npublic image. The Project will contribute to all three outcomes through improved learning for \npoor students, increased relevance and competitiveness of madrasah graduates, strengthened \nschool\u2013community governance and school-based management, and increased opportunities for \npoor and/or rural students in selected districts. \n \n19.  A strategic priority for ADB is to help MONE and MORA harmonize their approaches to \nimprove quality and quality assurance across primary and secondary education to ensure that \nmore students continue to and complete junior and senior secondary education. ADB's sector \nstrategy will be implemented through a mix of modalities, designed in line with specific policy \nand  strategic  priorities:  policy-led  program  loans  to  enable  sector-wide  reforms,  and  more \ntraditional projects to support specific investments.  \n \nE.  Other External Support and Donor Coordination \n \n20.  ADB has been a leading supporter of Indonesian education. It has provided $2,127 \nmillion in loans and $16 million in TA. Over the past decade, strategic priorities have been to \nenable  more  equitable  access  to  high-quality  basic  education  and  enable  public\u2013private \npartnerships  in  secondary  and  higher  education,  especially  focused  on  technological  and \nworkforce skills development. A cross-cutting priority has been to enable more decentralized \neducation management. ADB has led in supporting private sector development, especially in \nmainstreaming private schools and madrasahs.5 Several ADB projects have helped make senior \nsecondary and higher education more responsive to labor market requirements.6 With the World \nBank,  ADB  has  contributed  significantly  to  policy  and  strategy  development,  including  the \ncurrent Education Strategic Plan 2005\u20132009, through a comprehensive program of education \nsector work and advisory TA.   \n \n21.  Indonesia\u2019s  political  and  strategic  importance  has  attracted  large  amounts  of  grant \nfunding for basic education in recent years. Most support is focused on improving education \nthrough better management and accountability at the district level, and madrasahs have been \nincorporated into these projects. The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) \nhas two projects targeting Islamic education: the Basic Education Project which will help build \n600 new junior secondary madrasahs, and the smaller Learning Assistance Program for Islamic \nSchools which helps improve the quality of madrasah education (see Appendix 3 for further \ndetails).  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1995.

Donor coordination in the education sector occurs through the Education Sector Working \nGroup. However, the impact of policy dialogue between the Government, ADB, and other \ndonors has been limited by the uncertain political and policy environment and the absence of a \nGovernment-led set of sector strategy priorities and a performance monitoring framework. The \nultimate aim is to establish a Government-led policy group that will provide a stronger forum for \nGovernment\u2013donor coordination, with the long-term aim of moving to a sector-wide approach. \nMany of the features of this approach are being put in place gradually, enabled by the Education \nStrategic Plan. Parliamentary pressure to harmonize MONE and MORA education strategies \nwill further enable gradual movement to a more sector-wide approach. The Project, alongside \nincreased support from the Government and other donors, will encourage MORA to adopt a \nmore results-oriented planning and implementation process.  \n \nF.  Lessons \n \n23.  A number of key lessons learned from previous quality improvement projects have been \nincorporated into the Project (Appendix 4). The first is the need to focus assistance carefully on \na targeted set of schools rather than spreading resources thinly across a large number of \nschools. Second, such projects will be more sustainable if activities and financing are built into \nschool and district routine operations. Third, a design focus on school and student performance \nstandards is more likely to strengthen school\u2500community and district accountability. Fourth, \nsupport for private schools should target only those with good potential for sustainability. Finally, \nsupport for quality improvement is more effective when linked to capacity-building support for \nmore  results-oriented  school  governance  and  management.  The  project  design  takes  into \naccount  all  these  by  (i)  focusing  resources  on  just  500  medium-sized  madrasahs,  (ii) \nstrengthening governance systems, (iii) setting national education standards (benchmarks) as \nthe main project output, and (iv) channeling over 50% of the project funds directly to the \nmadrasahs,  to  be  managed  and  used  by  the  principal  and  madrasah  committee  to  meet \nidentified school needs.  \n \n24.  Experience shows that channeling funds directly to schools must be guided by clear \ntechnical directions on the funds\u2019 use, with strict reporting and public disclosure mechanisms. \nThe  project  design  includes  comprehensive  financial  reporting  procedures,  community \nparticipation through madrasah committees, and oversight of school financing under madrasah-\nbased  management  procedures.  To  improve  accountability,  madrasahs  will  be  required  to \nimplement a financial information system for quarterly reporting on funds used and activities. \nThe funds will be tied to performance agreements and released only if performance is good. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome   \n \n25.  In partnership with the Government and other donors, over the long term the Project is \nexpected to help raise levels of educational attainment among new entrants in the labor force \nand increase rates of formal employment and household incomes. The medium-term outcome \nof the Project will be improved quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of primary, junior secondary, \nand senior secondary madrasah education. Key success indicators will include (i) improved \nstudent performance at all levels, including a reduced gap in quality between the madrasah and \ngeneral-education systems; (ii) reduced district disparities in madrasah student performance, \nwith significant improvements in project madrasahs; (iii) improved progression and retention \nrates within the madrasah system; and (iv) more positive community perceptions of madrasah \neducation quality. \n ", "      7 \n26.  The overall project design rationale is to combine a carefully selected set of supply-side \ninterventions  alongside  a  number  of  key  governance  and  institutional  reforms.  These \ninterventions and reforms were selected based on extensive evidence of key determinants of \nquality and internal efficiency improvements. A second dimension of the design rationale is to \nfocus these interventions on poor rural districts, with significant concentrations of medium-sized \nprivate madrasahs, taking account of the need to avoid duplication with other donor-supported \ninitiatives. The design is based on well-researched district and school selection criteria and \nsignificant stakeholder consultations.  \n \n27.  Provinces, districts, and madrasahs were selected in phases: provinces first, based on \nhigh  madrasah  enrolments  and  proximity;  then  districts,  based  on  poverty  incidence,  high \nmadrasah enrolments, absence of other foreign-assisted projects, and interest in the Project; \nfinally, individual madrasahs in the districts, according to school size, student poverty, teacher \nqualifications, and proximity. Based on these criteria, 27 poor districts were selected in three \nprovinces (Central Java, East Java, and South Sulawesi). Within the districts, 500 madrasahs \nwere selected (208 MI, 233 MTs, and 59 MA), of which 90% are private. All levels were included \nto support the vertical integration of district madrasah education. A profile of project district and \nmadrasahs is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nB.  Outputs  \n \n28.  The Project is designed to produce four outputs, which will help ensure that national \neducation  standards  are  met  in  the  critical  areas  of  (i)  teacher  professionalism,  including \nqualifications and performance; (ii) availability of teaching and learning resources and facilities; \n(iii)  internal  efficiency,  especially  in  student  progression  and  transition  rates;  and  (iv) \ngovernance, management, and accountability. The Project will coordinate extensively with the \nNational  Board  of  Education  Standards  and  the  National  Board  of  School-Madrasah \nAccreditation in standards setting and performance monitoring. A TA grant will be provided for \nexternal monitoring and evaluation. The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.  \n \n29.  The outputs will be achieved primarily through the financing mechanism of a 3\u20134-year \nblock grant for each madrasah, supported by providers contracted to deliver specific programs \nsuch  as  teacher  and  principal  qualification  upgrading  and  short-term  pedagogical  training. \nOutputs (ii) and (iii) will be provided through the madrasah block grants. Madrasahs will choose \nfrom a menu of options responding to their needs as identified in the madrasah development \nplan (MDP), up to a ceiling for schools at different levels. All madrasahs will be required to \nimplement a broad range of activities, including not only the upgrading of physical facilities but \nalso other quality improvement programs such as teacher qualification and upgrading, remedial \nprograms and transition scholarships, and management training. The content of each block \ngrant will vary in accordance with the MDP prepared by each madrasah at the beginning of the \nProject and so cannot be specified in advance. Block grants will be released in semi-annual \ntranches based on performance. \n \n  1.  Teacher Professionalism Improved According to National Standards \n \n30.  Professional Qualifications Upgrading and Professional Certification. The Project \nwill allow for formal qualification upgrading to degree level for about 800 teachers and 200 \nprincipals. The degree programs will focus on Bahasa Indonesia, English, mathematics, and the \nsciences. Substitute teachers will be provided to replace teachers undergoing the program. The \nProject will also offer about 1,200 degree-qualified teachers and principals the opportunity for \n ", "8   \nprofessional  certification.  At  the  national  level,  at  least  30%  of  the  participants  in  degree \nupgrading and 40% in professional certification will be women.  \n \n31.  Subject  Content  Upgrading  and  Classroom  Methodology  Training.  Short-term \ntraining activities driven by demand and needs will also be offered, focusing primarily on subject \ncontent in the sciences, mathematics, and English, and on training in classroom methodologies. \nAbout 5,300 teachers in project madrasahs will be able to apply to attend a programmed \nsequence of two 3-week content and methods training activities annually, beginning in year 2 of \nthe Project. To respond to the new curriculum, short training programs will be available for \nteachers in core content areas on identifying learning objectives and lesson planning. Specific \nprograms to support classroom competencies will also be provided based on requests from the \nnetwork of teacher learning groups in primary and junior secondary schools. In each district, \nfemale participation in the short-term training will be in accordance with the proportion of eligible \nfemale teachers for each subject at each level. Common learning resource centers will compete \nto provide the facilities and resources for any non-school-based activities. \n \n32.  Ongoing  Teacher  Support  and  Mentoring.  The  Project  will  help  develop  teacher \nlearning groups for primary and junior secondary schools which provide established fora for \nteachers to help each other solve day-to-day teaching and learning problems. Small block \ngrants will be provided annually to centrally located madrasahs to establish and support teacher \nlearning  groups.  The  Project  will  make  available  200  competitive  block  grants  annually  to \ndevelop madrasah-based teaching and learning innovations developed by individual teachers, \nteacher learning groups, or school clusters. The madrasah development centers (MDCs) will \nhelp in strategic planning to develop teacher learning groups, and to facilitate and evaluate \nthese activities.  \n \n33.  Competitions for Excellence. Local excellence programs such as performance-based \nteacher awards will be supported in each province, including for schools that meet their MDP \ntargets. The Project will provide prizes and MDC members will act as judges.  \n \n2.  Teaching\u2013Learning Resources and Facilities Upgraded to National \nStandards \n \n34.  Expanding  Textbooks  and  Learning-Support  Materials.  Using  block-grant  funds, \nmadrasahs will be able to select textbooks and learning materials in core subject areas from a \nlist approved by MORA and to purchase them. A set of instructional materials will be given to all \nteachers completing degree programs. \n \n35.  Upgrading of Facilities, Equipment, Software, and Furniture. The Project will support \nrehabilitation and construction of classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and a limited number of \nhealth  clinics  as  required,  including  provision  of  appropriate  equipment  and  furniture.  The \nAssistance Scheme for Facilities Improvement, a community-based scheme used successfully \nin previous school and madrasah projects to construct school facilities, will be adopted. Under \nthis scheme, facilities upgrading is managed by the principal and school committee, using local \nworkers and parental contributions in cash and kind. All new classrooms will be on unoccupied \nland already owned by the school. Supervisors, facilitators, and civil works specialists (from the \ncentral project management unit [CPMU]) will monitor the facilities upgrading in collaboration \nwith the madrasah committee. All construction must comply with earthquake construction safety \nstandards. New classrooms may not be built above existing rooms without an assurance from a \nqualified engineer that the existing rooms can bear the weight of a new upper level. \n ", "      9 \n  3.  Internal Efficiency Increased to National Standards \n \n36.  Remedial Programs. The Project will facilitate after-school student remedial programs \nin  MI  and  MT,  supported  by  annual  block  grants  paid  directly  to  madrasahs.  Performance \nreporting  will  include  remedial  class  sizes,  participant  selection  statistics,  subject  areas, \nparticipant absenteeism, participant satisfaction, and test results.  \n \n37.  Transition Programs. To increase transition rates, scholarships will be available for \npoor MI graduates unable to attend MT or general junior secondary schools, and for poor MT \ngraduates  unable  to  attend  MA  or  general  senior  secondary  schools.  This  program  will \ncomplement  the  national  school  operational  budget  program,  which  offsets  the  costs  of \nschooling  for  those  already  in  school,  and  the  national  cash  transfer  program  that  helps \ncompensate families for increased fuel costs. At least 50% of the scholars in each district will be \ngirls.  \n \n38.  Expand Physical Capacity. In areas where demand for madrasah education exceeds \ncapacity, and where there are adequate teachers, madrasahs (especially MTs) may request \nsupport to add new classrooms to expand enrolments. There must be sufficient unoccupied land \navailable on the school grounds. Requests may also be made to expand MIs to the MT level in \nline with Government policy to establish rural integrated schools.  \n \n  4.  Governance,  Management,  and  Sustainability  Strengthened  to  National \nStandards \n \n39.  Governance  Development.  Governance  at  the  madrasahs  will  be  reinforced  by \nestablishing and strengthening madrasah committees. The Project will advocate 30% female \nrepresentation on the committees, which will be responsible for working with madrasah staff to \ndevelop  MDPs.  Training  in  governance  will  be  provided  to  the  committees.  Decisions  on \nfinancial allocations from the block grant will be the responsibility of the madrasah with the \nyayasan head and madrasah committee. District governance will be strengthened by greater \ncollaboration between the MORA district office and the district education office in planning \neducation development. The education development plans of both agencies will be formally \nreviewed  by  the  district  education  council  so  that  it  knows  the  education  needs  of  all \nconstituents served by these parallel service delivery systems.  \n \n40.  Madrasah-Based Management and Accountability. Madrasah development planning \nand management, and accountability, are critical components of madrasah-based management \nand  the  key  to  successful  madrasah  improvement.  A  series  of  workshops  on  madrasah \ndevelopment planning and financial management will be provided to MORA central, provincial \nand district staff, supervisors, madrasah principals, madrasah committee members and yayasan \nheads. Introductory management courses of 3-5 days will be provided to managers first to lay \nthe  foundation  for  introducing  madrasah-based  management  (MBM)  and  madrasah \ndevelopment  planning  in  project  districts  and  provinces.  These  courses  will  introduce  the \nmanagement skills needed for successful implementation of MBM and madrasah development \nplanning.  Subsequent  10-day  workshops  in  madrasah  development  planning,  MBM  and \nfinancial management (including modules on financial planning, financial reporting, accounting \nand auditing) will include madrasah committee members. After the workshops, 4-year MDPs will \nbe prepared and priorities for quality improvement identified by each madrasah. Additional \ntraining in MBM will be available to principals and yayasan heads and/or kiai throughout the \nproject period, including training on the financial management system to be installed in each \nmadrasah. This will be linked to the implementation of the block-grant mechanism, with all \n ", "10   \ntraining provided by a contractor. Greater transparency will be promoted through oversight by \nmadrasah committees and yayasan, and budgets and expenditures will be made public. The \ncontinued professional development of principals will also be fostered through the principals\u2019 \nlearning groups. Further training will be provided throughout the project to MORA provincial and \ndistrict  office  staff  to  support  madrasah-based  management  in  performance  management \nsystems, madrasah-based development and advocacy, and data input and report production for \neducation management information systems.  \n \n41.  Design and Application of a Preventive Maintenance Program. As part of madrasah-\nbased management, the Project will design and conduct a compulsory 3-day training program in \npreventive maintenance for representatives from each project madrasah and district office. The \nattached TA will monitor the preventive maintenance activities.  \n \n42.  Improved  Sector  Management.  Short  courses  in  leadership  development  and \nmanagement  will  be  offered  to  staff  of  the  central,  provincial  and  district  MORA  offices, \nsupervisors, principals and yayasan heads, with a focus on results-based management. Gender \ntraining for managers will also be part of the program.  Six people will be selected from MORA \ncentral, provincial, or district offices to attend master\u2019s degree programs overseas. Two PhD \nprograms  will  be  supported.  All  programs  will  be  in  management  and  evaluation,  with  an \nemphasis  on  results-based  management,  performance-based  planning  and  budgeting, \naccountability,  and  transparency.  At  least  three  of  the  students  for  the  master\u2019s  and  PhD \nprograms will be women. \n \n43.  Teaching Learning Assessment and Quality Assurance System Development. A \nprovincial madrasah quality assurance working group will be established to support the MDC as \na partner in project implementation. This group is designed to (i) implement a quality assurance \nsystem and associated procedures in madrasahs, (ii) perform a training needs assessment for \nquality  assurance  for  madrasahs,  (iii)  organize  training  and  regular  meetings  to  provide \nconsultation service to madrasah principals, (iv) review accreditation proposals submitted by \nmadrasahs, (v) with MDC prepare a final recommendation for the madrasahs to be accredited, \nand (vi) select and train supervisors and selected principals to become members of the local \nassessor team for madrasah accreditation. A 10-day training program will be provided for \ncentral,  provincial,  and  district  staff  and  madrasah  principals  and  owners.  At  least  three \nmembers of each MDC will be certified as assessors, to participate in quality assurance teams \nto certify madrasahs. To strengthen the MORA\u2013MONE partnership, MORA will establish a \nliaison office for the National Board of Education Standards and the National Board of School-\nMadrasah Accreditation..  \n \n44.  Advocacy and Public Information Programs. Madrasah development forums (MDFs) \nwill be established in project provinces and districts, consisting of yayasan heads and/or kiai, \nprincipals, teachers, or other community members. The MDF will lobby for madrasah concerns \nand promote appreciation of their positive contributions. The Project will offer advocacy training, \nincluding information on government resources available to madrasahs, lobbying strategies, and \ntechniques for using the media; and will establish a national madrasah links website. The \nProject will support MDF meetings and development and delivery of media materials. \n \nC.  Special Features   \n \n45.  Quality Assurance and Benchmarking. The new National Education Standards and \nassociated accreditation criteria are the lynchpin of the project design, unlike previous projects \nthat targeted incremental quality improvements. This will make it easier to measure results and ", "      11 \nassess project success. The meeting of accreditation standards for schools and qualification \nstandards  for  teachers  will  result  in  tangible  and  measurable  benefits  for  the  project \nbeneficiaries, thus providing an additional incentive to support the Project. \n \n46.  Funds Channeled Directly to End Users. To empower madrasahs and communities, \nand encourage greater community involvement in the planning and budget process, project \nfunds will be channeled directly to madrasahs based on approved MDPs. This will increase the \ntransparency of fund flows and reduce the opportunity for possible fund misuse when different \nlevels of government bureaucracy are involved. An objective of the project design was that at \nleast 50% of funds should flow directly to recipients to reduce overhead costs and maximize \nproject impact at the beneficiary level.  \n \n47.  Community  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  Project\u2019s  monitoring  and  evaluation \nframework is unusual in education projects in that it institutionalizes community involvement. \nInterviews and discussions will be held with madrasah committee members, yayasan heads, \nparents,  and  students  on  their  perceptions  of  madrasahs,  quality  improvements  needed, \nperceived  problems,  and  proposals  for  solutions.  This  information  will  form  a  valuable \nsupplement to the quantitative data from the project monitoring information system (PMIS).  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n48.  The project investment cost is estimated at $71.4 million, including taxes and duties of \n$0.1 million (Table 1, detailed cost estimates by item of expenditure are in Appendix 5). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n \nComponent  Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n  1.  Project Management \n \n50.  The Executing Agency for the Project will be MORA which, with the support of the \nDirectorate  General  of  Islamic  Education  of  MORA,  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nmanagement of the Project. A project steering committee (PSC) will be established to guide the \nCPMU on general policy directions, intersectoral coordination, and strategic directions. PSC \nmembers will include representatives of MORA, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (Bappenas), and MONE. The MORA secretary general will chair \nthe PSC. The director general of Islamic education will be the project director, and the director \nof  the  Directorate  for  Madrasah  Education  will  be  the  PSC  secretary.  A  project  technical \ncommittee (PTC) will be established to guide the CPMU in overall project implementation. \nMembers of the PTC will include representatives of MORA, MOF, and MONE. The director of  \nReligious Affairs and Education, Bappenas, will chair the PTC.  \n \n51.  MORA will establish the CPMU, under the guidance of the project director. The CPMU \nwill be responsible for day-to-day project implementation, planning and budgeting, procurement, \ndisbursement, monitoring, supervising, and overseeing implementation at province, district, and \nmadrasah levels, and submitting the required reports to the Government and ADB. The CPMU \nwill have about 15 staff members, including MORA staff members and consultants working \ntogether on each project component, supported by finance and administrative staff. In each \nproject province, a project coordinating committee will be established to oversee provincial \nimplementation.  The  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  head  of  the  regional  development \nplanning office, with members from the provincial office of education and the MORA provincial \noffice, and representatives of the MDC and the Madrasah Development and Empowerment \nCouncil. Within MORA\u2019s provincial office, a project coordinating unit (PCU) will be established to \nmanage, monitor, evaluate and consolidate activities in the provinces and districts. The PCU \nhead will come from the MORA provincial education division, and will be assisted by finance \nand accounting, procurement and works, and monitoring and evaluation staff, supported by \nconsultants. Similarly, a district coordinating unit (DCU) will be established within MORA\u2019s \ndistrict office. DCUs will oversee implementation at the madrasah level, particularly the use of \nthe MDP block grants. The DCU head will be from the MORA district education section, assisted \nby  supervisors,  facilitators,  and  administrative  and  financial  management  staff.  MDC  and \nstakeholder participation in implementation will encourage transparency and accountability. The \nproject organization structure is in Appendix 6 and the fund flow for MDP block grants in \nAppendix 7. The detailed terms of reference for these units are in Supplementary Appendix D.  ", "      13 \n2.  Period of Implementation \n52.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2012. First-\nyear activities will focus on staffing of PCUs and DCUs, planning and coordination with MDCs, \nhuman  resource  development,  including  degree  programs,  and  madrasah  development \nplanning. In subsequent years, project funding and support will be allocated in accordance with \napproved MDPs and performance. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n53.  Procurement of goods and services financed under the loan shall be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time). Contracts for the \nrefurbishment of the CPMU office, including furniture and PMIS workstations, a website, and \nvehicles for the CPMU and PCUs, will be awarded by national competitive bidding for contracts \nestimated to cost the equivalent of more than $100,000 up to $500,000, and by shopping for \ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less.  The  procedures  to  be  followed  for  national \ncompetitive  bidding  shall  be  those  set  forth  in  Presidential  Decree  80/2003,  with  the \nclarifications and modifications described in Schedule 4 of the Loan Agreement. Madrasah \nworks for rehabilitation of classrooms, libraries, and computer and science laboratories, which \nare expected to cost less than the equivalent of $30,000, will be awarded on the basis of \ncommunity  participation.  Furniture,  equipment,  textbooks,  and  materials  for  madrasah \nclassrooms; libraries; and science and computer laboratories will be awarded on the basis of \nnational  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  more  than \n$100,000 up to $500,000 and by shopping for contracts estimated to cost $100,000 or less. \nSome  remote  madrasahs  may  have  access  to  only  one  supplier,  in  which  case  direct \ncontracting  will  be  allowed.  For  economy  and  efficiency,  pooled  procurement  may  be \nintroduced, where several madrasahs pool their procurement for more competitive bidding. \nOverseas fellowships will be procured through direct contracting. The procurement plan is in \nAppendix 9. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n54.  All  consultants  to  be  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  selected  in \naccordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to \ntime). Services of international and national consultants will be required to assist with project \nimplementation.  MORA,  through  the  CPMU,  will  be  responsible  for  selecting  and  hiring \nconsultants. Project implementation consultants will be hired through a firm of international \nconsultants in association with national consultants, using quality- and cost-based selection \n(QCBS). The consultant terms of reference are in Appendix 10. For monitoring and evaluation \nstudies and training programs, firms will be selected and engaged using the methods of either \nQCBS,  consultants\u2019  qualifications  selection  or  single  source  selection  depending  on  the \ncircumstances. Individual consultants will also be engaged to assist the CPMU and provinces.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n55.  To facilitate the disbursement of loan funds, the Government will establish an imprest \naccount at Bank Indonesia. The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and \nliquidated in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and \narrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. The imprest account will be managed \nby MOF. The ceiling and initial amount of the imprest account will be $5 million. The statement \n ", "14   \nof expenditure procedures may be used for liquidating or replenishing the imprest account. Such \nprocedures shall apply to contracts not exceeding $100,000. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n56.  Project madrasahs will be required to keep accounts and evidence of use of the block \ngrant for audit by the CPMU (through the PCU) and the Government Audit Agency. Each \nmadrasah will submit to the PCU annual and quarterly financial reports. The PCU will audit the \naccounts and records of a sample of madrasahs every quarter to ensure that the block grant is \nproperly used. In case of fund misuse or irregularity, the PCU will report it to the CPMU for \nfurther investigation and action. The CPMU will issue an order suspending activities at the \nmadrasahs until the case is resolved. If necessary, fund recovery will be determined by the \nCPMU investigative panel, in collaboration with ADB. \n \n57.  The CPMU will also organize a semiannual audit of the accounts and records of the use \nof the block-grant funds at a sample of project madrasahs in each district. In case of irregularity, \nthe procedures described above will be adopted. The CPMU, through MORA, will request the \nGovernment Audit Agency to carry out the investigative audit. The Government Audit Agency \nwill audit the accounts and records of project madrasahs annually, in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s standard practices, and will submit its findings to MORA and MOF to ensure that \nthe block grant funds are used properly and that cases of irregularity and fraudulent practice are \nhandled properly. \n \n58.  MORA will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify goods and services \nfinanced from the loan proceeds. It will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project, \nand ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually by certified external \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  auditor  will  prepare  a  report  on  the  use  of  loan  funds, \ncompliance with loan covenants, and use of the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of \nexpenditure  procedure  under  the  Project,  issue  a  certification  as  well  as  findings  of  any \nirregularities  or  discrepancies,  and  recommend  corrective  measures  so  that  the  financial \nstatements and the audited accounts will be certified by the auditor as \u201cmeeting generally \naccepted accounting practices\u201d.  \n \n59.  MORA will submit the audited financial statements and the auditor\u2019s report on the project \naccounts, including the imprest account and use of the statement of expenditure, to ADB in \nEnglish within 9 months after the end of the fiscal year. The CPMU will prepare and submit to \nADB and MORA quarterly reports on the status and progress of project implementation within \n20 days after each quarter. The reports will have a format acceptable to ADB and will indicate (i) \nprogress made against established targets, (ii) status of performance indicators, (iii) problems \nencountered and actions taken, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, and (v) proposed program \nof activities for the following quarter. Within 3 months after project physical completion, the \nGovernment will prepare and submit to ADB a project completion report. Further details are in \nSupplementary Appendix H. \n \n  7.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n60.  The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy7  and policy relating to the \ncombating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.8 Consistent with its commitment \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2001.  Anticorruption Policy. Manila.  \n8 ADB. 2003. Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism. Manila. ", "      15 \nto good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require the Government to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best-\npractice standards to prevent corruption or money laundering or the financing of terrorism, and \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The investment documentation \nbetween ADB and the Government will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential \nviolation of these undertakings. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of MORA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the Project. \n \n61.  The  Project  incorporates  several  other  measures,  in  addition  to  the  standard  ADB \nrequirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency. The Project and the TA grant \nincorporate into its design measures to (i) build capacity within MORA to understand and \ncomply with ADB and Government procedures as outlined in the Project Administration Manual; \nand (ii) widely publicize the existence of the integrity division within ADB\u2019s Office of the Auditor \nGeneral, as the initial point of contact for allegations of fraud, corruption, and abuse among \nADB-financed projects. A project website will be developed to disclose information about project \nmatters, including procurement. The Project will establish a financial management information \nsystem in project madrasahs, and will enforce strict reporting requirements as described above. \nFinally, to encourage more stakeholder vigilance as well as ensure greater accountability, a \ncomplaints and action task force will be set up at the CPMU to receive and resolve grievances \nor act upon stakeholders\u2019 reports of irregularities. \n \n8.  Project Performance Management and Review System \n \n62.  A comprehensive, gender-disaggregated PMIS will be designed and standardized for \ndifferent  levels  of  management,  including  the  Directorate  for  Madrasah  Education,  MDCs, \ndistricts, and madrasahs. A users\u2019 manual will be developed, and workshops conducted for \nprovincial, MDC, district, and madrasah staff. The workshops will help officials appreciate the \nvalue of the PMIS, and provide technical training. A domestic consultant will be contracted to \ndesign the PMIS, develop the manual, and conduct the training.  \n \n63.  Project performance will be monitored and evaluated through the Project\u2019s monitoring \nand evaluation system from two perspectives: internal (by project implementers) and external \n(by an independent firm not involved in project implementation). The internal monitoring and \nevaluation will monitor the progress of programs in accordance with the agreed indicators and \ntargets.  Quarterly  project  progress  reports  will  consider  the  observations  from  community \nmonitoring through the madrasah committees. The external monitoring and evaluation will be \ncarried out under the attached TA. \n \n  9.  Project Review \n \n64.  The Government and ADB will review the Project\u2019s progress jointly at least twice a year. \nThe Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review shortly after the CPMU\u2019s \nsubmission of the third annual report. The midterm review will focus on overall project strategy \nand achievements, which may require adjustments of targets and processes and reallocation of \nresources.  Specifically,  the  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  project  scope,  design, \nimplementation  arrangements,  institutional  development,  and  capacity  building;  (ii)  assess \nproject implementation against projections and performance indicators; (iii) review compliance \nwith  loan  covenants;  (iv)  identify  critical  issues,  problems,  and  constraints;  and  \n(v) recommend changes in project design or implementation. One month before the review, the \n ", "16   \nCPMU will submit to ADB a comprehensive report on each of these issues. Finally, a project \ncompletion report will be prepared to assess early impact and identify lessons learned.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n65.  A TA grant from ADB will be provided for independent monitoring and evaluation of \nproject programs, activities, outputs, outcomes, benefits, and impact (Appendix 11). The total \nTA amount will be $1.3 million equivalent. ADB will finance $995,000 on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will contribute the balance of $305,000. The TA \nwill support the Project by helping raise public confidence in the quality, efficiency, and cost-\neffectiveness of private madrasah education. \n \n66.  Objectives  and  Purpose.  The  objective  is  to  increase  the  results  orientation  and \nexternal focus for monitoring and evaluation systems, which are essential for monitoring MORA \npolicy targets and related project targets. The TA will ensure results-based sector performance \nmonitoring at the central, district, and madrasah levels. The outcome will be strengthening of \ninternal  and  external  accountability  and  associated  governance  systems  to  support  the \nGovernment's anticorruption policies. Key outcomes will be compliance with Government and \nproject institutional integrity policies related to (i) the quantity and quality of goods and services; \n(ii) accuracy in procurement, accounting, and other financial records; and (iii) transparency in \nselection and awarding of contracts. Key elements will be (i) baseline, midterm, and final project \nevaluations;  (ii)  program  compliance  monitoring;  (iii)  financial  compliance  monitoring;  (iv) \nprogress and performance monitoring; (v) quality compliance monitoring; (vi) impact evaluation; \nand (vii) institutional strengthening for sector performance assessment.  \n \n67.  Methodology and Activities. The independent monitoring and evaluation activities will \nfocus on (i) the efficiency and effectiveness of project implementation results; (ii) the quality of \nproject  outputs,  goods,  and  services  provided  based  on  professional  criteria  or  agreed \nstandards; (iii) the transparency of the process and actions taken by stakeholders based on the \nGovernment\u2019s regulations and ADB guidelines; (iv) the responsibilities and accountability of \nagencies and individuals for implementing project activities; and (v) the initial benefits and \nimpact of the Project against the expected project outcomes. Focus will be on the proposed \nfinancing schemes and strengthening of school performance (fiduciary controls on madrasah \nblock  grants),  scholarships  and  remedial  programs,  teacher  development  programs,  and \nconcurrent  capacity  development  in  governance  and  management  (madrasah-based \nmanagement, MDP, MDF and stakeholder forums at the district level and madrasah committees \nat the school level).  \n \n68.  Implementation  Arrangements.  The  Executing  Agency  will  be  MORA,  with  the \nDirectorate General of Islamic Education responsible for overall TA implementation. MORA will \nappoint a senior staff member as TA coordinator and three counterpart staff members to work \nwith the consultants. ADB will engage a qualified consulting firm or educational institution to \nimplement the TA. The firm will provide one international expert and four experienced local \nexperts for a total of 126 person-months. The TA will be undertaken, intermittently during the \nproject  period.  The  final  output  of  the  TA  will  be  a  comprehensive  report  of  findings  and \nrecommendations for MORA and ADB.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "      17 \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n69.  Social Benefits. The Project will raise education standards in around 500 madrasah \nschools, thereby giving 120,000 students, including around 60,000 girls, the immediate benefit \nof better education. If the improved standards are sustained over 10\u201315 years, roughly 300,000 \nstudents will benefit directly from better education, and about 140,000 students will benefit \ndirectly from improved academic credentials, leading to improved access to post-secondary \neducation and formal paid employment. Over the same period, the Project will benefit directly \nand indirectly about 150,000 households, mainly in the lowest poverty quintile. Through the \nincreased resources flowing to private madrasahs resulting from advocacy and school capacity \nbuilding, parental contributions will be reduced. Fee cost savings to these households are \nconservatively estimated at Rp600 billion over 10\u201315 years.9 The direct household benefits \ninclude the opportunity to redirect these savings to food, shelter, and health care costs, as well \nas the opportunity to save for subsequent senior and post-secondary education costs, which are \nlargely self-financed. Other indirect benefits include (i) improved family health and nutrition, and \nschool attendance; (ii) future reduced fertility rates; (iii) greater likelihood of educated mothers \nsending their daughters to school; (iv) reduced risk of vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and child labor; \nand (v) more jobs and income-generating activities.  \n \n70.  Other direct beneficiaries will include (i) about 2,200 teachers receiving professional \nupgrading  to  degree  level;  (ii)  about  5,300  teachers  and  principals  receiving  short-term \npedagogical training; (iii) about 2,500 madrasah committee members receiving governance \nawareness raising; (iv) about 500 central, provincial, and district MORA technical staff receiving \nvarious forms of training; and (v) about 10,000 local tradesmen and shopkeepers, who will \ndirectly benefit from income generation related to the block-grant system. In the longer term, the \nupgraded teachers will benefit from at least a doubling of their salaries. The trained principals \nand teachers will have enhanced promotion prospects, with potential salary gains. Other indirect \nbeneficiaries will include madrasah committee members, who will be empowered through their \nparticipation in school affairs, and local construction workers and their families involved in \nschool rehabilitation. Medium- and long-term benefits include increased internal efficiency and \nprogression rates, which will result in cost savings for parents. Long-term benefits also include \nincreased access for madrasah graduates to formal paid employment and consequent growth in \nincomes for the predominantly poor households that send their children to low-cost private \nmadrasahs. A summary poverty reduction and social analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \n71.  Environment and Social Safeguards. The Project will upgrade and rehabilitate school \nfacilities,  with  no  negative  environmental  or  resettlement  impact  as  no  land  acquisition  or \nresettlement  is  required.  Some  new  classrooms  will  be  added  to  existing  schools  but  on \nunoccupied land already owned by the madrasahs. Communities will be involved in decisions \nabout construction, which will help mitigate negative environmental impacts. There will be no \nencroachment on indigenous peoples\u2019 territory (impact category C). \n \n72.  Economic Benefits. The most significant long-term economic benefit will come from \nincreases  in  earnings  of  madrasah  graduates  with  better  education  attainment  and  higher \nproductivity, resulting from improved education. In economic terms, the benefit of education is \n                                                 \n9  Madrasah Education Sector Assessment, 2004, indicates that a rough average for parental contributions is \nRp100,000 per student per annum (assuming cost savings of Rp50,000 per student per annum from the school \noperational budget). \n ", "18   \nexperienced by beneficiaries as wage increments. Over 10\u201315 years, 140,000 more students \nare  estimated  to  directly  benefit  from  greater  access  to  higher  education  and  formal \nemployment. Conservative estimates indicate that the increased competitiveness of madrasah \ngraduates could result in a wage rise of at least Rp0.15 million\u2013Rp0.20 million per annum, \nresulting in a Rp6.00 million\u20137.00 million improvement in income over a working lifetime. Under \nplausible assumptions, the results of the reverse cost\u2013benefit analysis indicate that the required \nwage gap to make the project economically feasible at an internal rate of return of 12% is \nRp85,350 for a weighted average of graduates of the project madrasahs. The required wage \ngap is much smaller than the existing wage gap for general-education graduates,10 hence \nrendering the Project feasible. The summary economic and financial analysis is in Appendix 13.  \n \n73.  An immediate, positive financial and economic impact will be increased resources for \nprivate madrasahs in project districts and schools. A large proportion of these resources will be \nchannelled directly to the poorest students. In the short to medium term, increased advocacy \nand information about available Government funding will ensure that madrasahs become more \nadept at accessing resources. In the long term, as funding becomes better linked to school \naccreditation and performance levels, an important impact will be that resources for madrasahs \nbecome more predictable and sustainable. \n \n74.  Fiscal  Impact.  A  financial  plan has  been  prepared  that  projects  and  identifies  the \nfunding sources to ensure that adequate funds will be available to finance project expenditures. \nThe annual fiscal impact of the Project has been estimated on the assumption that GDP will \ncontinue to grow at 5%, and that the ratio of public and education expenditure to GDP will \nremain unchanged. Project-related expenditures will increase annually and reach $71.4 million \nby  the  Project\u2019s  end,  with  the  Government  share  at  $21.4  million.  Several  Government \ncommitments will terminate at the Project\u2019s end. The continuing additional incremental costs of \n$0.5 million annually after the Project ends will add $2.5 million to the total in 2012\u20132017. This is \nsustainable, given the size of the projected education budget. Some efficiency gains as well as \nstrengthened teacher competencies and management capacity will have long-term benefits. \nThe Government\u2019s annual commitment for the Project as a percentage of the MORA budget \nranges from 0.4% to 1.2%, and averages 1.1% over the project life. At the madrasah level, \nsustainability  will  be  enhanced  through  the  school  operational  budget  program,  improved \nquality, governance, management, and advocacy, resulting in increased demand for madrasah \neducation, better resource mobilization, and greater cost-efficiency. \n \nB.  Project Risks and Assumptions \n \n75.  Macro Level. A potential strategic risk is the longer-term sustainability of the policy \nreform process with continued, committed leadership and ownership. Reform programs have \noften been disrupted by changes at senior levels in MORA or MONE. This seems less likely \nover the next decade given the strong interest of parliamentarians to demonstrate education \nprogress to their electorates; an ongoing process of extensive consultation between MONE, \nMORA, and Parliament on the Education Strategic Plan 2005\u20132009 and MORA strategic plans; \nand sustained public consultations on rights and responsibilities associated with the reform \nprogram.  \n \n                                                 \n10  The wage gap appears to be caused by differential distribution of madrasah graduates into unfavorable jobs: as \nunpaid workers (vs. paid employees for general school graduates) and in agriculture (vs. trade for general school \ngraduates). ", "      19 \n76.  An uncertain fiscal climate and unforeseen developments (e.g., natural disasters and \nvolatile oil prices) may undermine the predictability of Government resources for madrasah \neducation, especially the significant transitional costs associated with the policy reforms. This \nalso appears less of a threat now than in the past because of (i) the Government's evident \npreparedness to direct increased resources to the social sectors and specific pro-poor targeted \nreforms, (ii) extensive policy dialogue with donors on macroeconomic stabilization and pro-poor \npublic expenditure management, and (iii) medium-term increases in external assistance that will \nhelp offset education reform transitional costs. \n \n77.  Project  Level.  Insufficient  transparency  and  accountability  in  Government  financial \nmanagement and accounting processes are a potential project risk, which will be mitigated by (i) \nsupport  for  Government  commitment  to  governance  reforms  through  technical  support  for \nstrengthened  financial  management  and  reporting  in  project  madrasahs,  along  with  public \ndisclosure; (ii) a focus on strengthening community governance and accountability through \ncommunity involvement; and (iii) external TA for strengthening performance monitoring and \nevaluation and public information systems. The financial management capacity assessment \n(Supplementary  Appendix  J)  indicates  that  MORA\u2019s  financial  management  systems  and \nprocedures meet ADB requirements. \n \n78.  Project madrasahs may find it difficult to retain better-qualified teaching staff given their \nlow salaries. Government plans to introduce substantial financial incentives for teachers fulfilling \nqualification standards, having full teaching loads, and living in remote areas will reduce this \nrisk. To prevent deterioration of facilities, training in preventive maintenance will be compulsory \nfor  all  madrasahs  receiving  funds  for  facilities  improvement.  The  long-term  financial \nsustainability of private madrasahs remains a risk, which the Project will address in several \nways. The upgraded and expanded madrasahs should attract more students and, hence, more \nfee revenue. Advocacy training will help ensure that madrasahs are better equipped to take \nadvantage of the increased Government support. Lastly, madrasah development planning will \nreinforce community involvement in madrasah operations, which usually brings with it greater \ncommunity support. The benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. There is a \npotential risk that yayasan and principals may be reluctant to accept community involvement in \nmadrasah decision making. Advocacy programs will help convince them of the benefits of \ncommunity  involvement,  particularly  community  contributions  to  MDP  implementation. \nPartnership agreements signed with the Project will specify these contributions. \n \n79.  A  key  assumption  is  sustained  economic  growth  and  protection  of  the  projected \nincreases in public expenditure on education, including for public and private madrasahs. A \nrelated  assumption  is  that  MORA  and  the  madrasah  system  will  plan  and  mobilize  the \nanticipated additional resources for madrasahs and spend the funds effectively. The Project \nincorporates specific policy dialogue measures and assurances to offset these potential risks, \nalongside  a  wide-ranging  information  campaign  outlining  these  new  sources  of  funds  and \nperformance-related eligibility criteria \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.   Specific Assurances \n \n80.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MORA have given the \nfollowing specific assurances, which will be incorporated into the legal documents. \n \n ", "20   \n(i)  The Government will provide counterpart funds for Project implementation on \ntime.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary \nappropriation requests and ensure prompt disbursement of appropriated funds \nduring each year of Project implementation. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure the smooth flow of funds from central level to the \nparticipating Project provinces, districts and madrasahs, in accordance with the \nflow of funds mechanism agreed between the Government and ADB.  \n \n(iii)  The Government and MORA will ensure that only madrasahs meeting the agreed \neligibility criteria for block grants set out in Appendix 7 of this document will \nreceive funding under the Project. \n \n(iv)  To  ensure  the  smooth  transfer  of  the  block  grants  to  each  of  the  selected \nmadrasahs, immediately upon approval of the block grants, each madrasah will \nestablish an account at a local bank.  \n \n(v)  Within 9 months of Effective Date, MORA will set up a liaison office for the \nNational  Board  of  Education  Standards  (NBES)  and  the  National  Board  of \nSchool-Madrasah  Accreditation  (NBSMA)  within  the  Secretary  General  or \nDirector  General's  Office  and  will  prepare  a  position  paper  on  the  strategic \nimplications of implementing NBES and NBSMA regulations for madrasahs 3 \nmonths later. \n \n(vi)  MORA will complete a draft 5\u2013year strategic plan for implementing government \neducation policies in madrasahs by the end of 2007, which will form the basis for \ndialogue on a harmonized MONE/MORA strategic plan as directed by Parliament \n \n(vii)  MORA will design and standardize a comprehensive PMIS for the different levels \nof management including the central Directorate of Madrasah Education, MDCs, \ndistricts, and madrasahs and develop a users\u2019 manual not later than 12 months \nof the Effective Date. \n \n(viii)  To ensure that women benefit equally from the Project, the Government and \nMORA will ensure that the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Gender and Development (1998) and the gender strategy contained in \nthe  Gender  Action  plan  that  has  been  prepared  and  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB.  \n \n(ix)  MORA will create a Project website to disclose information about various matters \non the Project, including procurement. With regard to procurement, the website \nwill include information on the list of participating bidders, name of the winning \nbidder,  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures  adopted,  amount  of  contract \nawarded, and the list of goods/services procured. \n \n(x)  Within 9 months of the Effective Date, MORA will establish in the CPMU a \nComplaints and Action Task Force to receive and resolve complaints/grievances \nor act upon reports from stakeholders on misuse of funds and other irregularities. \nThe task force will (a) review and address grievances of stakeholders of the \nProject, in relation to either the Project, any of the service providers, or any \nperson responsible for carrying out any aspect of the Project; and (b) set the ", "      21 \nthreshold criteria and procedures for handling such grievances, for proactively \nand constructively responding to them, and for providing the stakeholders with \nnotice of such mechanism.  \n \n(xi)  Although no significant environmental impacts were identified, the siting, design, \nconstruction and operation of school facility rehabilitation work undertaken under \nthe project will be implemented in line with the Government\u2019s environmental laws \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).  \n \n(xii)  The Government and MORA will ensure that it will not approve any block grant if \nthe  rehabilitation  or  construction  of  the  new  school  facilities  will  involve \ninvoluntary resettlement according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995). To be eligible for block grants the madrasah are required to confirm that \nno land acquisition or resettlement is required under the Project. Construction of \nnew classrooms will be added to existing madrasahs on unoccupied land already \nowned by the madrasahs. \n \n(xiii)  MORA will ensure that the construction of two-storey buildings will comply with \nconstruction safety standards. Madrasahs will not be allowed to construct a new \nclassroom above an existing classroom without first obtaining assurance from a \nqualified engineer that the existing classroom construction is strong and solid \nenough for the additional upper level classroom(s). \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n81.  Prior to Loan Effectiveness, the following will have been completed: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  have  established  a  project  steering  committee  in \naccordance with paragraph 50 of this document.  \n(ii)  The Government will have established the CPMU in accordance with paragraph \n51 of this document. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n82.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent

Education Sector Context and Performance Overview \n \n1.  Indonesia has shown a number of significant education sector achievements. Overall \nenrolments at all levels of education have increased. Net enrolment rates in primary and junior \nsecondary  education  are  an  estimated  93%  and  62%,  which  are  comparable  with  Asian \nneighbors (e.g., Philippines\u2014primary 94%, junior secondary 55%). In addition, the gap between \nmale and female enrolments has fallen substantially. Internal efficiency rates are encouraging \nwith repetition and dropout rates below 3%. Higher education enrolments have reached 2.8 \nmillion through a diverse mix of public and private providers. The 1997 crisis barely affected this \nrecord because of the rapid introduction of student scholarships and school grants programs to \nretain children in school.1  \n2.  Another achievement has been to diversify partnerships in education, through the private \nsector. The Ministry of National Education (MONE) and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) \nare major providers. This strong and growing public\u2013private partnership, including a proven \nwillingness of parents to contribute, represents a strong foundation for future reforms, especially \nat post-basic education levels.2 Another achievement has been the introduction of an extensive \nlegislative and regulatory program, especially related to pro-poor sector financing and minimum \nservice standards. MORA remains a largely centralized ministry, although selected functions are \ndelegated to provincial and district offices. \n3.  Despite these achievements, a number of issues need to be addressed if Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDG) and Education for All (EFA) goals of universal access to high-quality \nbasic education and gender equity are to be assured. Net primary, junior secondary, and senior \nsecondary enrolment rates are stagnating. Participation is being constrained by a number of \nfactors, including (i) cost barriers, especially formal and informal fees; (ii) distance to school, \nespecially for junior- and senior secondary education in remote and rural areas; (iii) extreme \nurban\u2013rural variations in per-student funding; and (iv) growing evidence that a perceived decline \nin quality is beginning to affect demand for education.  \n4.  Another key demand-side issue is that improved access to primary and junior secondary \neducation  is  not  a  sufficient  condition  to  maintain  or  stimulate  additional  demand.  Easier \nopportunities to progress to senior secondary education, higher education, and other post-\nsecondary education and training opportunities as an avenue to formal sector paid employment \nare  critical,  especially  among  the  poorest  families,  who  face  greater  real  and  perceived \nopportunity costs. There is also growing demand for second-chance education opportunities, \nthrough more relevant and labor market oriented non-formal and informal education and skills \ntraining. \n5.  Growing  public  awareness  of  Government's  new  National  Education  Standards  is \ncreating both opportunities and risks. Linked to the introduction of widely published examination \nresults,  it  is  an  opportunity  to  strengthen  community  governance  and  accountability \nmechanisms. The standards are also being used to lobby for and mobilize additional resources \nfrom the Government, evidenced by the substantial increase in central MONE funding since \n2005. \n                                                 \n1 World Bank. 2004. Education Sector Review. Washington, DC. Jakarta. \n2 MONE. 2006. Education Strategic Plan  2005\u20132009. Jakarta. \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n6.  Nevertheless, there are a number of potential risks. Unless access and quality indicators \nare improved quickly in line with Government policy and minimum service standards (MSS) \ntargets, public confidence and demand may decline. A second risk is that unless many supply-\nside issues are addressed, demand may decline. These supply-side factors include (i) reducing \nurban\u2013rural disparities in secondary school access, (ii) eliminating disparities in the distribution \nof qualified teachers and textbook availability, (iii) improving school building conditions, and (iv) \nbeginning to equalize per student spending and eliminating basic education school fees. \n7.  Another potential risk is that unless cost-efficiency issues are dealt with quickly, sector \nfinancing may not be sustainable. Improving the teaching and non-teaching staff utilization \nrates, reducing dropout and repetition rates, increasing primary-secondary transition rates and \noptimizing the use of school facilities are recognized as key challenges. Simultaneously, sector \nplanning  and  management  needs  to  become  more  results-oriented,  using  MSS-related \nperformance criteria, as the basis for sector performance monitoring and evaluation. Parliament \nand ministers of MONE and MORA recognize that any additional funding for the sector needs to \nbe justified by better results. \n8.  Another  potential  risk  is  that  the  organizational  and  management  arrangements  in \nMONE and MORA will continue to be insufficiently realigned with new assigned functions and \nresponsibilities,  under  decentralization  or  selective  deconcentration.  In  particular,  central \nstrategic  planning,  budget  management,  and  performance  monitoring  systems  remain \nunderdeveloped. Results-oriented information flow and management systems at various levels \nare  also  limited.  Unless  these  systems  are  improved,  justifying  any  further  reforms  and \nmobilizing additional funds will be problematic. \nB.  Madrasah Sector Assessment and Strategic Response: Project Rationale \n \n9.  The project rationale and design is in response to the broad policy, institutional, and \nfinancing features derived from this sector assessment. In addition, the project design responds \nto the unique opportunities, challenges, and potential risks facing the madrasah education \nsector.3,4 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has a comparative advantage given its extensive \nhistory  and  experience  of  being  the  lead  aid  agency  supporting  madrasah  education \ndevelopment over the past decade, providing an opportunity to consolidate and extend the \nimpact of previous support. \n \n10.  There is evidence of sustained and growing demand for madrasah education. Madrasah \nstudents now represent 13% of total enrollments in Indonesia. Enrollment is growing rapidly. \nAverage annual growth rates of madrasah enrollment 1998/99 to 2003/04 well outpaced that of \nthe general education system. The growth rate at primary level in madrasah ibtidaiyah (MI) was \n1.97%  in  2003/04  compared  with  a  general  primary-school  growth  rate  of  0.22%.  The \ncomparative growth rates for junior secondary level in madrasah tsanawiyah (MTs) and in \ngeneral junior secondary schools were 3.86% and -0.11%, respectively. The rates for senior \nsecondary level in madrasah aliyah (MA) and general senior secondary schools were 11.89% \nand 3.03%, respectively.5  \n \n11.  Sustaining the madrasah education system is critical if MDG and EFA goals are to be \nachieved and sustained. Madrasahs encourage poor and disadvantaged students to attend. \n                                                 \n3 MORA. 2004. Final Report, Madrasah Education Sector Assessment.

Jakarta. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nOften fees are modified or waived for poorer students, and fees tend to be lower than in public \nschools because of significant voluntary contributions. In 2004, 50.7% of students in madrasahs \nwere female, compared with 48.5% in general schools. Female students are not segregated in \nthe madrasahs. Female teachers are a slight minority in madrasahs. In MI, 48% of teachers are \nfemale with 41% in MTs and 40% in MA, but women are not as well represented in managerial \npositions. Only 13.1% of principals in madrasahs are female. \n \n12.  The madrasah system provides a key vehicle for ensuring the crowding in of private \ncontributions for education and ensuring active participation of community groups in school \ngovernance and management. Over 90% of madrasahs are private.  About 81% of students are \nin private madrasahs and 85% of the teachers. In some instances, madrasahs are owned by \nindividuals or families. Most private madrasahs are small, with fewer than 200 students. These \nsmaller private madrasahs are close to their communities and are often run by local religious \nleaders (kiai) or foundations (yayasan).  \n \n13.  Nevertheless, these comparative advantages of the madrasah schools are fragile. As \nparents become more aware of Government's minimum standards, especially characterized by \navailable instruction materials and qualified teachers, there is a risk that demand will decline. \nEqually, unless parents are increasingly guaranteed the quality and relevance of madrasah \neducation,  evidenced  by  comparative  student  examination  performance,  employability,  and \nadmission  into  further  education,  there  is  a  serious  risk  that  madrasah  schooling  may  be \nundermined. The private madrasah school system is particularly vulnerable to these risks. A key \nproject rationale is to address these demand- and supply-side issues through targeted support \nand an extensive advocacy program.  \n \n14.  A critical issue is to improve the student performance in madrasahs and, simultaneously, \nreduce performance differentials between madrasahs and general schools. For example, in \n2003,  junior  and  secondary  examination  failure  rates  in  madrasahs  were  11%  and  15%, \ncompared with 4% and 7% respectively in MONE-managed schools. This means madrasah \ngraduates are less competitive in gaining admission to senior secondary schooling, higher \neducation,  and  other  post-secondary  opportunities.  Equally,  there  is  evidence  that  senior \nsecondary madrasah graduates are less competitive in the labor market and perceived as less \nemployable.  \n \n15.  There are a number of consequences of this difference in quality between general \nschools and madrasahs. Firstly, the lower pass rates in junior secondary constitute a constraint \non access to senior secondary education, which is still merit-driven and competitive. Secondly, \nthe  recognized  underperformance  in  junior  secondary  madrasah  schooling  contributes  to \nvariable  demand  at  this  level.  Thirdly,  the  comparatively  poorer  performance  at  senior \nsecondary level limits madrasah graduates\u2019 admission to higher education and formal, paid \njobs.6  \n \n16.  Another key indicator of the quality of madrasahs is their official categorization. Only a \nsmall proportion of madrasahs have the highest ranking. Public madrasahs are all considered \nequivalent. In 2003/04, only 12.8% of private MI were considered equivalent with 7.2% of \n                                                 \n6  For example, wages of madrasah graduates are substantially lower than those of general-school graduates. In \n2004,  the  average  wage  for  20\u201324-year-old  MA  graduates  was  74%  of  that  for  general  secondary-school \ngraduates. Job advertisements in newspapers often specify general senior secondary school graduation as a basic \nqualification for the job. \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nprivate MT, and only 5.5% of private MA equivalent. A new accreditation system7 will be based \non National Education Standards in eight categories: content, process, personnel, facilities, \ngraduates (competence), management, finance, and evaluation. Private madrasahs, especially, \nwill have to be upgraded to meet these new criteria.  \n \n17.  A key determinant of quality improvement is the qualifications and experience of the \nteaching  force.  For  school  year  2004/05,  83%  of  all  MI  teachers  (in  public  and  private \nmadrasahs), 45% of MT teachers and 28% of MA teachers were not fully qualified. The situation \nis particularly acute in private madrasahs, given the voluntary nature of teacher employment, \nand is exacerbated by an acute shortage of fully qualified teachers in language, science, and \nmathematics.  \n \n18.  For many parents, availability of good facilities and textbooks is a key factor in deciding \nto send their children to school. Recent surveys showed that only 45% of private madrasah \nbuildings were in adequate condition and only 10% of children have the required textbooks. As \na result, only 70% of primary madrasah students progress to junior secondary madrasahs, often \nswitching to general schools or dropping out. It is widely reported that parental uncertainties \nover madrasahs\u2019 ability to offer the specialist subjects in the secondary curriculum is a growing \nissue. \n \n19.  Many of these features are a result of insufficient resources in madrasahs, especially \nprivate ones, which are heavily reliant on small fees and voluntary teachers. In the long term, \nfinancing prospects are encouraging with the projected increases in MORA central budgets, the \nexpansion  of  school  operational  budget  mechanisms  under  MORA  management,  and \ngovernment financing of teacher upgrading and retraining. A critical challenge to MORA will be \nto set these additional resources within an overall medium- and long-term policy and strategic \nframework, harmonized with MONE, as Parliament is demanding. \n \n20.  Nevertheless, the extent of proposed madrasah education reforms will require additional \ntransitional support, especially to address immediate quality-oriented supply-side interventions, \nespecially  teacher  and  management  development,  selective  facilities  rehabilitation,  and \ninstructional materials shortfalls. Expansion of the results-oriented MORA block grant system is \nparticularly crucial to enable more results-oriented school governance and management and \nassociated  capacity  building.  Assisting  with  these  transitional  costs,  alongside  other  aid \nagencies (e.g., Australian Agency for International Development [AusAID] and the United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  [USAID]),  while  supporting  longer-term  policy  and \ninstitutional reform, is central to the project rationale. \n \n21.  Avoiding the crowding out of parental and community contributions through project and \nGovernment  funding  is  critical.  Strengthening  school-based  planning  and  management  is \nanother  key  project  feature.  The  aim  will  be  to  assist  madrasah  governing  bodies  to  use \nadditional funding, alongside its own, to assure quality-oriented inputs and activities. At the \nsame  time,  it  is  recognized  that  strengthening  central,  provincial,  district,  and  school \nperformance monitoring systems is important for assessing school effectiveness and taking \naction. In this way, public confidence in the madrasah system will be sustained. \n                                                 \n7  A new system of accreditation of general schools and madrasah was introduced under Law 20/2003. Under the \nnew system, all general schools and madrasah are to be accredited using three categories: A \u2013 excellent, B \u2013 \ngood, and C \u2013 sufficient. \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nLESSONS LEARNED FROM INDONESIAN EDUCATION PROJECTS  \n \nTable A3.1: Application of Lessons Learned  \n \nLessons  Actions Incorporated in the Project \nPrevious projects have maximized the number of  The  project  design  calls  for  a  limited  number  of \nschools that receive benefits from the Project.

Rationale \n \n1.  One key feature of the Project is to encourage madrasahs to become more innovative \nand proactive in planning and managing their own educational programs based on their unique \nsituation  and  needs.  Under  a  madrasah-based  management  system,  each  madrasah  will \nprepare a 4-year madrasah development plan (MDP) covering all aspects of its operations with \nthe objective of improving the quality of education it offers to the students. The MDP will be \nresults-based, and will consist of activities and a budget that specifies sources of funding for \neach activity, tied to specific performance indicators. The Project will provide block grants that \nwill constitute one source of funding to be used for activities of the MDP that are eligible for \nfunding under the project rules. Other activities will be funded from alternative sources such as \nthe Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) budget, local budget, and community participation.  \n \nB.    Disbursement Procedures for Block Grants \n \n2.  To be eligible for a block grant, the project madrasahs will develop a 4-year MDP. In the \nfirst  year  of  the  Project,  training  and  technical  support  will  be  provided  for  the  principal, \nteachers,  staff,  yayasan,  and  members  of  the  madrasah  committee  in  the  process  and \ntechniques of preparing an MDP. Facilitators hired by the Project will help madrasahs prepare, \nimplement, and monitor MDPs. The madrasahs will submit the MDP to the district coordination \nunit (DCU) at district MORA office for review and evaluation. After the MDP is finalized and \nevaluated by the facilitators together with the DCU, the plan will be submitted to the provincial \ncoordinating unit (PCU) for further review, endorsement, consolidation, and submission to central \nproject management unit (CPMU) for review and approval. \n \n3.  A block grant will be earmarked for each madrasah to implement its MDP activities. The \nblock grant will be disbursed in semiannual tranches over the course of the Project, based on \nMDP project accomplishment and commitment. The block grant for the first year will be based \non the approved expenses planned for the first year of MDP activities. The subsequent releases \nfrom the Treasury, Ministry of Finance (KPPN, MOF) will be based on reports from madrasahs \non the progress achieved, funds utilization, and committed funds, submitted to CPMU through \nthe PCU and DCU.  \n \n4.  Upon approval of each MDP, MORA will prepare a decree (surat keputusan), for the \nDirectorate General of Islamic Education to sign and issue, to authorize financing of the MDP by \na block grant. The decree will contain the name of the madrasah, bank account information, and \nthe amount of funding. The decree will be sent to the recipient madrasah through the PCU and \nthe DCU for recording and monitoring. The project manager and the madrasah will sign a multi-\nyear contract based on the approved MDP. On the basis of this contract, the project manager \nwill prepare a payment order (surat perintah membayar), to be signed and issued by the director \ngeneral as project director, to KPPN (Jakarta). KPPN will send a disbursement order (surat \nperintah pencairan dana) to its local operational bank copied to the CPMU and Bank Indonesia, \nand  will  subsequently  order  the  local  operational  bank  to  transfer  the  block  grant  to  the \nmadrasah\u2019s bank account.  \n \nC.  Reporting and Replenishment  \n \n5.  Each project madrasah will submit to the PCU through the DCU quarterly financial and \nannual project reports, which will be consolidated into quarterly and annual reports. The PCU \nwill monitor progress toward achievement of targets and activities. Upon satisfactory review of \n ", "  Appendix 7  37 \nfinancial and other reports by the PCU and CPMU, the second tranche of the first year will be \nreleased from KPPN to the madrasah bank accounts in the same manner as for the first \ntranche. The same review and approval of reports will be needed to release the subsequent \ntranches of the block grant. \n \n6.  Within 3 months of each fund transfer from KPPN to the madrasah bank account, the \nCPMU will prepare the statement of expenditures (SOEs) summarizing the status and use of the \nblock grant provided to the madrasahs by district for the entire province. The SOEs will be \nprepared by category of expenditure based on the approved MDP programs and activities, with \nan SOE limit of $100,000. To replenish the imprest account, the CPMU will prepare withdrawal \napplications  based  on  district  SOEs,  attach  the  relevant  madrasah  bank  statements  and \npayment  order,  and  submit  them  to  MOF  for  endorsement  and  submission  to  ADB,  for \nreplenishment and liquidation of the imprest account. The records of transfer of funds from \nKPPN to madrasah bank accounts according to the approved block-grant budget tranche (MDP) \nwill serve as the basis for SOEs.  \n \nD.  Accounting and Auditing  \n \n7.  Each  recipient  madrasah  will  be  required  to  keep  separate  accounts,  records,  and \nevidence of payments and use of the block grant for reference and audit by the PCU, CPMU, \nand Government Audit Agency. Every quarter, the PCU will audit the accounts and records of a \nsample of madrasahs to ensure that the block grant is properly used in accordance with the \napproved plan and budget. If there are irregularities, corruption cases, and fraudulent practices \ninvolved in the use of the block-grant funds, the PCU will report them to the CPMU for further \ninvestigation  and  administrative  and  legal  actions  against  the  madrasahs  and  individuals \ninvolved.  The  CPMU  will  report  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  issue  an  order \nsuspending the activities at the particular madrasahs until the cases are satisfactorily resolved. \nWhen block-grant funds are used improperly, fund recovery will be determined by the CPMU \ninvestigative panel in consultation with ADB. \n \n8.  The CPMU will also organize a semiannual audit of the accounts and records of the use \nof the block grant funds at a sample of the project madrasahs in each district. The independent \nmonitoring and evaluation team may be requested to conduct the audit and submit reports of its \nfindings to the CPMU as parts of its responsibilities and terms of reference. If there are cases of \nirregularities, corruption, and fraudulent practices, the same procedures as described above will \nbe adopted.  \n \n9.  MORA will request the Government Audit Agency to audit the accounts and records of \nthe  recipient  madrasahs  on  the  use  of  the  block  grant  funds  in  accordance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s standard practices. The Government Audit Agency will submit its reports of the \nfindings to CPMU and the concerned government agencies to ensure that the block grant funds \nare properly used as approved and that irregularities, corruption cases, and fraudulent practices \nwill be properly handled to deter them. \n \n10.  MORA will also request the Government Audit Agency to audit the project accounts and \nstatement of expenditures and provide a management letter covering internal controls and \nprocedures associated with the maintenance of project accounts and preparation of audited \nproject accounts. Such audited project accounts should be submitted to ADB no later than 9 \nmonths after the close of the fiscal year to which they relate.

The  Madrasah  Education  Development  Project  will  have  an  attached  technical \nassistance (TA) designed to ensure effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the Project. \nThe TA will raise public confidence in the quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of madrasah \neducation, predominantly in private schools. Critical to raising public confidence will be reliable \nperformance monitoring reports, especially related to education standards improvement and \nspending effectiveness. The Ministry of Religious affairs (MORA), which governs the madrasah \neducation system, has taken a number of steps to begin to develop more transparent M&E \nsystems through (i) establishment of a discrete performance monitoring function within the \nDirectorate General of Islamic Education (DGIE); (ii) additional staff and system strengthening \nwithin the Inspectorate General, particularly related to internal audit; (iii) improved liaison with \nthe  Board  of  National  Standards  for  Education;  and  (iv)  participation  in  joint  internal \nperformance and financial audits on the school operation budgets.1 \n \n2.  Nevertheless, it will take some time to put sufficiently robust internal M&E systems in \nplace. The proposed TA will ensure that independent monitoring evaluation systems are in \nplace over the lifetime of the Project. Simultaneously, the active participation and involvement of \nkey MORA departments, especially the DGIE and the Inspectorate-General, in the design of the \nM&E activities will provide informal capacity building within MORA. It is expected that MORA will \nensure that the TA liaises with other anticipated donor support to strengthen MORA sector \nperformance, program monitoring, and internal audit systems, especially the technical support \nprovided through the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)-funded Basic \nEducation Project and the Learning Assistance for Islamic Schools Project.  \n \nA.  Impact and Output \n \n3.  The TA is intended to foster an increased results orientation and external focus for M&E \nsystems, to help ensure effective monitoring of the program targets. The TA will establish \nresults-based sector performance monitoring at the central level, with concurrent institutional \nstrengthening at provincial, district, and madrasah level.  \n \n4.  The  output  of  the  TA  will  be  strengthened  internal  and  external  accountability  and \nassociated governance systems to help prevent fraud, corruption, misuse of project funds, and \ndelays in project implementation. This will be evidenced by compliance with government and \nproject institutional integrity policies related to (i) the quantity and quality of goods and services \naccording to specifications, schedules, and budget; (ii) accuracy in procurement, accounting, \nand other financial records; and (iii) transparency in selection and awarding of contracts and \nrelated transactions.  \n \n5.  Key elements and processes of the proposed independent monitoring evaluation TA will \nbe (i) baseline, midterm, and final project evaluation; (ii) program compliance monitoring; (iii) \nfinancial  compliance  monitoring;  (iv)  progress  and  performance  monitoring;  (v)  quality \ncompliance monitoring; (vi) benefits and impact evaluation; and (vii) institutional strengthening \nfor sector performance assessment. The final output of the TA will be a comprehensive report of \nfindings  and  recommendations  to  MORA  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  Interim, \nquarterly, and annual reports will be prepared throughout the 5-year project period.  \n \n                                                 \n1  MORA capacity development assessments and road maps. \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \n  B.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nBasic Education for All is enshrined in Indonesian law and is a cornerstone of Indonesia\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and for \nmeeting Millennium Development Goal 2 (achieve universal primary education).a To achieve this goal, the Government\u2019s \n2005\u20132009 Medium-Term Strategy target is to increase the junior secondary net enrollment rate from 65% to 95%. This \nrequires a significant increase in the completion rate of elementary and junior secondary level schools and in the transition \nrate  from  elementary  school  to  junior  secondary  school.  Improved  levels  of  education  are  required  to  maintain  the \ncompetitiveness of the labor force. Lower levels of education are related to lower productivity and growth and higher rates of \npoverty.  \n \nMadrasahs are a major component of the education system, representing 13% of total student enrollment in Indonesia. \nMadrasahs are 91% privately owned and supported by community contributions. Many of the private madrasahs are in rural \ncommunities and encourage participation of poor students. As they are generally less endowed than public schools, the \nquality of education remains unsatisfactory, a feature that is demonstrated by the wage gap between workers public and \nmadrasah graduates by age cohort and gender. Madrasahs also have a major appeal for the parents of girls, especially at \nupper levels of education. Parents see them as providing a safer environment for their daughters and a values-oriented \neducation.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nTo maximize the impact of madrasah upgrading, the provinces were selected based on high madrasah enrollment rates \nwhile the incidence of poverty was the basis for selection of districts. The poverty levels of the districts selected ranged from \n11-33%, with the majority of the districts in the range of 20\u201328% (% poor people). All madrasahs selected had to meet the \ncriterion that at least 20% of students came from poor families. In 2003/04, about 66% of the pupils in madrasah ibtidaiyah \n(MIs) and madrasah tsanawiyah (MTs) were children of farmers, fishers, traders or laborers, and over 55% of parents of MI \nstudents had only primary education or less.  \n \nTable A12.1: Project Districts by Poverty Level \nProvinces  No. of Districts  Poverty Level \nCentral Java  10  21.3 \u2013 33.3 \nEast Java  12  19.1 \u2013 33.4 \nSouth Sulawesi    5  11.1 \u2013 23.3 \nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas), 2002 and 2003. \n \nGirls make up 51% of madrasah enrolments nationally. Surprisingly, girls increasingly dominate higher education levels, \nwhich is the opposite of what occurs in general schools. This indicates the important role madrasahs can play in ensuring \nthat girls complete their formal school education. In project madrasahs, the representation of girls is slightly below the \nnational average, but follows the same trend. 50% of project students are girls. \n \nTable A12.2: Proportion of Girls in Project Madrasahs \nLevel  No. of  No. of  % Girls  % Girls \nStudents  Girls  National \nPrimary   36,343  17,728  49  50 \nJunior secondary   47,445  24,088  51  51 \nSenior secondary   13,204  6,847  52  54 \nTotal  96,992  48,663  50  51 \nSource: Ministry of Religious Affairs, EMIS data. \n \nMadrasah graduates have difficulty competing with graduates of general schools from the same age cohort and gender at \nboth the junior and senior secondary levels, with the widest gap for senior secondary graduates. Senior high school \ngraduates from general schools and madrasahs find themselves as employees, unpaid family workers, or self-employed. \nHaving the work status as an employee is desirable although being an unpaid (household) worker is not. Proportionally more \nmale and female general senior secondary graduates obtain work as employees than those from madrasah aliyah (MA), who \nare more concentrated in low-wage sectors such as agriculture and services. As a result, male and female MA graduates \nearn less than general school graduates, with a wider gender gap.  \n \n ", "56  Appendix 12 \nTable A12.3: Labor Force Outcomes for General Senior School and Madrasah Graduates, Aged 20\u201324 \nMadrasah Graduates \nItem   General School Graduates  Madrasah Graduates  Compared with General \nSchool Graduates (%) \n  Male  Female  Total  Male  Female  Total  Male  Female  Total \nA.

Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \nThe Project targets private madrasahs. Many are in bad physical condition, are staffed by under-trained teachers, and lack \nteaching-learning materials. The Project aims to remedy this situation by building community support through community \nparticipation in development planning to identify improvement needs for the madrasahs. Block-grant funding for madrasah \nimprovement will be provided to meet these needs, with funds channeled directly to madrasahs to promote empowerment. \nThe madrasahs with their communities and foundations will administer these block grants themselves, reinforcing the existing \nstrong tradition of community support. Communities will also be involved in monitoring and evaluation of the Project. These \nimprovements are expected to lead to better-quality education, with more graduates obtaining better-paying jobs and/or \nmoving on to higher levels of education.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n1.   Strategy to maximize impacts on women \n \nThe Project is expected to raise the quality of madrasah education to prepare male and female students to be more \ncompetitive in higher levels of education and in the labor market, on a sustainable basis. \n \nMadrasahs attract more female students and employ more female teachers at all school levels than their general school \nequivalents. The overall student body is 50.7% female. Although female teachers are well represented, the proportion of \nfemale teachers declines by level from 48% in MIs to 40% in MAs. At the management level, only 13% of all principals are \nfemale. The strategy to maximize impacts on women focuses on (i) the students, teachers, and counselors; (ii) principals and \nMORA district and provincial officials; and (iii) school owners and the madrasah school committees.  \n \nTransition rates for girls and boys from MI to MT are 80% and 79%, and from MT to MA 48% and 47%. These rates need to \nbe increased to achieve universal basic education, and to provide better opportunities for senior secondary and higher \neducation.  \n \nMaintaining the current gender balance among teachers will require targeted interventions. The proposed project target of \n60% of teachers attaining degrees requires teacher upgrading. Only 44% of female teachers and 40% of male teachers in \nthe preliminary list of project madrasahs meet the new qualification standards. With only 22% of female teachers and 20% of \nmale teachers eligible for degree upgrading, it is important that eligible male and female teachers be able to take advantage \nof the upgrading opportunities. To ensure that training is affordable, scholarships will be provided with the requirement that \nthe gender balance will be proportionate to the number of male and female teachers eligible for training in the project districts \nand schools. Where appropriate, training will be brought closer to the teachers to promote women\u2019s participation.  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  57 \nGender equity in terms of enrollment has already been achieved but female graduates fare notably more poorly in the labor \nmarket. The impact of improving school quality on female students, gender awareness training for teachers and school \nmanagers must be maximized because they influence student academic choices, including subject matter and on selection \nof career direction. Gender awareness training for school principals and local education managers will affect their decisions \non personnel management and development, school management, and planning and investment. This, in turn, will lead to a \nfocus on preparing male and female students to be competitive in the labor market. Gender awareness training for the school \nowners will affect hiring of school managers, school development plans, and overall focus.  \n \n2.   Gender Action Plan \n    a.  Key Issues and Objectives \nThe key gender issues to maximize the impact of the Project on women are to \n(i)  encourage female students to chose academic subjects and provide better career counseling that lead to \nbetter labor force outcomes; \n(ii)  provide scholarships to female students for transition from MI to MT, and MT to MA; \n(iii)  provide gender awareness training for teachers; \n(iv)  maintain current gender balance between male and female teachers; \n(v)  ensure the proportion of scholarships provided is in accordance with the ratio of male and female teachers \navailable for training in the project districts and schools; \n(vi)  identify and implement nonfinancial measures that enable female teachers to participate in teacher \nupgrading (to be agreed at appraisal); \n(vii)  encourage school development planning to identify and consider gender impacts; \n(viii)  encourage female participation in the madrasah school committees; and \n(ix)  to achieve (vi) and (vii), gender awareness will be built up among school owners and school principals as \nwell as local MORA staff. \n    b.  Specific Actions \nOutput 1: Teacher professionalism and student performance \n(i)  Scholarships will be allocated to female teachers in proportion to the number of eligible female teachers in \nthe project districts and schools. At least 30% of S1 degree scholarships and 40% of scholarships for \nprofessional certification will be allocated to female teachers. \n(ii)  Short-term in-service teacher training will be provided to teachers in accordance with the proportion of \nfemale teachers in each subject and at each level (MI, MT, MA). \n(iii)  At least two master\u2019s degree and one PhD fellowship will be given to women. \nOutput 2: Internal efficiency. 50% of transition scholarships will be allocated to girls.  \nOutput 3: Governance, management, and sustainability \n(i)  Leadership and development.

The trainees will be the stakeholders responsible for producing, implementing, and supervising the \nmadrasah development and investment plans. The resulting plans funded under MEDP will include a \nstakeholder analysis to indicate how gender was considered in the preparation of the plan. \n(iii)  The project monitoring implementation system will be designed to report on the implementation of the \ngender action plan. \n(iv)  Advocate for at least 30% representation of women on madrasah committees. \nGender targets are included in the log frame and loan covenants. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Macroeconomic and Sectoral Analysis \n1.  The economy has recovered from the Asian monetary crisis of 1997, with annual gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth at about 5%. Before the crisis, economic growth was largely \ninvestment  driven,  with  gross  investments  to  GDP  averaged  at  about  30%,  which  was \nprincipally driven by private consumption, with services sector growth twice the manufacturing \nsector  (6.2%  vs.  3.6%).  Post  crisis  (1998\u20132005),  investment  and  net  exports  show  mixed \nperformance with annual gross investments to GDP declining to below 20%. This structural \nchange has implications for job creation and its effect on employment and income levels. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) poverty assessment1 indicates poverty incidence declining from \n11% to 24% in a relatively short period, but a large portion of the population subsist just above \nthe poverty line and remains highly vulnerable.  \n \n2.  Positively, the recent reduction in oil subsidies is designed to sustain macroeconomic \nstability  and  enable  redirection  of  a  greater  share  of  public  expenditure  to  education.  For \nexample,  in  March  2005,  Government  introduced  a  30%  rise  in  fuel  prices,  with  savings \nredirected  to  education  and  health.  A  major  impetus  for  the  recent  pro-poor  social  sector \ninitiatives is the recognition that poverty reduction has been slower than in some regional \nneighbors  (e.g.,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Viet  Nam).  The  projected  increased \nspending on basic education in rural areas is part of the overall pro-poor public expenditure \nstrategy and the rural economic diversification program.  \n3.  Another impetus is to raise Indonesia's ranking from the bottom third of the global \neconomic  competitiveness  index.2 A  quarter  of  Indonesian  firms  think  that  the  inadequate \nworkforce  skills  are  a  key  obstacle  to  their  profitability  and  competitiveness,  a  growing \nconsideration  under  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  free  trade \narrangements.3 This is a key factor also for stimulating rural agricultural and small and medium-\nsized enterprise (SME) development.4,5,6 Demographic pressures fuel demand for job creation \nand broader rural economic diversification. It is projected that around 2 million\u20133 million school \nleavers  will  join  the  labor  force  annually  over  the  next  5  years  and  that  the  number  of \nunemployed 15\u201324-year-olds is rising faster in rural areas, especially among females. \n4.  Developing the madrasah education system is critical for achieving these objectives. Of \nall students, 13% are enrolled in madrasahs, constituting a significant proportion of the future \nwork force. Surveys indicate that demand is growing and these schools attract the poorest \nstudents. The madrasah system is also characterized by strong community participation in \neducation governance, management, and financing, being a major feature of public\u2013private \npartnership in education. Research indicates that madrasahs have a comparative advantage in \nproviding pro-poor education.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Indonesia ranked 39th in reading and mathematics and 38th out of 41 \ncountries in science. \n \n ", "60  Appendix 13 \nB.  Economic Justification \n5.  Over the medium to long term, a key economic justification for the project focus on \nimproving and assuring madrasah education quality is that it will help raise the productivity and \nincome level of graduates when they enter the workforce. Senior secondary school madrasah \ngraduates will become more directly competitive in the formal paid employment sector. Through \nincreased admissions to higher education, they will also be more competitive in the higher-\nearning professional employment market. In macroeconomic terms, the increased number of \nwell-qualified  madrasah  graduates  will  contribute  to  Indonesia's  regional  and  international \ncompetitiveness, which will attract foreign and local investment. \n \n6.  Another project focus is to improve the reputation of madrasah education among parents \nand  employers  by  assuring  them  that  necessary  education  standards  will  be  met  and  by \nconducting key supply-side interventions. In this way, the subjective household discount rate for \neducation will move closer to the actual market discount rate, and the rational expectation of \nfuture wages will also rise because madrasah graduates will have equal access with general \nschool  graduates  to  formal  sector  jobs.  In  other  words,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  the \nincreased likelihood of parents continuing to contribute to the costs of madrasah education, \nthereby increasing the overall level of resources and sustainability of sector outcomes. \n \n7.  Ultimately, sustained demand for educational quality is related to higher productivity. \nParents value quality to the degree that they perceive a positive relationship between improved \nquality and improved incomes later in the labor force. Surveys have shown that parents want \nbetter-quality  education,  but  are  unable  to  afford  the  increased  cost  of  quality  education. \nEmployers also value quality in education, to the degree that it improves productivity. Studies \nhave shown that graduates with different types of education sort themselves into different types \nof jobs at different levels of productivity. Madrasah graduates have less access to mid-level \nincomes and jobs.7 A key project objective is to redress this disadvantage. \n \nC.  Cost Benefit, Cost-Effectiveness, and Cost-Efficiency Analysis \n8.  The  project  design,  especially  the  range  of  supply-side  interventions,  takes  careful \naccount of international research on which mix of inputs correlates strongly with education \nstandards and quality improvement. International research demonstrates that key interventions \nare  (i)  availability  of  well-qualified  and  motivated  teaching  staff;  (ii)  availability  of  effective \ninstructional materials; (iii) strong school leadership focusing on academic excellence; and (iv) \ntransparent, accountable, and results-oriented school governance and management systems. \nThe project design responds directly to these findings. \n \n9.  There is a strong project focus on teacher development. A number of options were \nexamined, including (i) the balance of academic upgrading and pedagogy training; and (ii) the \nuse of distance, part-time academic upgrading or full-time institution-based training. The two \nmost  important  were  full  S1  (bachelor  degree)  training  for  teachers  instead  of  short-term \ntraining.  Many  teachers  in  private  madrasahs  are  not  university  trained  and  are  teaching \nsubjects in which they have not been trained. Short-term training will not allow teachers to attain \nthe required content knowledge for effective teaching and has not proven effective in changing \nclassroom teaching.  \n                                                 \n7  Based on SUSENAS 2004, average wages of madrasah graduates are substantially lower than those of general \nschool graduates. Job advertisements in newspapers often specify a general senior secondary certificate as a \nbasic qualification. \n ", "    Appendix 13  61 \n10.  The use of community-managed block grants was judged to be more cost-effective than \ncentralized procurement. The rationale included (i) reduced central management overheads, \nmeaning a greater proportion of funds would go to schools directly; (ii) spreading the risk of lack \nof institutional integrity over fund management; and (iii) greater likelihood of the block grant \nsystem stimulating community ownership and governance for the outcomes of the grants and \ntheir management.  \n \n11.  The most significant private economic benefit will come from increases in future earnings \nof madrasah graduates with better educational attainment and raising the graduates\u2019 future \nproductivity,  under  plausible  assumptions,  the  results  of  the  reverse  cost\u2013benefit  analysis \nindicate that the required wage gap to make the project economically feasible at an internal rate \nof return of 12% is Rp85,350 for a weighted average of graduates of the project madrasahs. \nThe results of the reverse cost\u2013benefit analysis are in Table A13. The required wage gap is \nmuch smaller than the existing wage gap for general education graduates,8 hence rendering the \nProject feasible. This wage gap appears to be caused by differential distribution of madrasah \ngraduates into unfavorable jobs: as unpaid workers (vs. paid employees for general school \ngraduates) and in agriculture (vs. trade for general school graduates).  \n \nTable A13: Existing Wage Gaps for New Senior Secondary Graduates \n \nItem  Mean Employee Wages (rupiah per month) \nGeneral School  Madrasah \nDifference \n  Graduates  Graduates \n15\u201319 Years  525,067  294,313  230,754 \n20\u201324 Years  634,935  467,392  167,543 \n       Source: Susenas, 2004. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender Impact Assessment \n12.  The  project  focus  on  primary  and  secondary  schooling  is  also  consistent  with \ninternational research demonstrating that the social returns on education investment are high, \nparticularly basic primary and secondary education in low- and middle-income countries where \ndirect returns of 15\u201320% and 14\u201318% are reported.9  \n \n13.  The project design will have a positive impact on reducing poverty and improving social \ndevelopment. There is evidence that graduates of a 6-year primary cycle earn much more than \nstudents who have completed only 5 years and that there are small differences in earnings \nbetween school leavers with 3 or 4 or 5 years of primary school (McGinn, 1989). As noted \nabove, children from poorer and less-educated families are more apt to leave school before or \non  completing  basic  education.  Their  lower  levels  of  human  capital  can  be  expected  to \nperpetuate  their  families'  marginal  economic  status  intergenerationally.  Intergenerational \npoverty  cycles  arise  through  strong  relationships  between  parental  education,  household \npoverty, and children's educational achievements. Research has shown a significant correlation \nbetween initial education inequality and reduced income growth, pointing to the need to break \nthis cycle.10 \n \n                                                 \n8  The wage gap appears to be caused by differential distribution of madrasah graduates into unfavorable jobs: as \nunpaid workers (vs. paid employees for general school graduates) and in agriculture (vs. trade for general school \ngraduates). \n9  World Bank. 2002.

There is significant evidence that retaining children from poor families, especially girls, in \njunior  secondary  schools  correlates  strongly  with  reduced  risk  for  HIV/AIDS  vulnerability, \nespecially in remote and cross-border areas. The project focus on expanding primary and \nsecondary education opportunities in these areas is therefore a key design consideration.  \n \nE.  Education Financing Outlook \n15.  The Project will enable movement towards increased funding for education from the \nnational  budget.  While  the  Government  has  set  policies  and  programs  to  make  funding \nequitable and proportionally allocated to general schools and madrasahs to improve their quality \nand meet national education standards, there has been a disproportionate allocation so far \nbetween madrasahs and general schools. The project support will help meet the transitional \ncosts of the proposed madrasah education reforms. \n \n16.  The  project  focus  on  attaining  national  education  standards  and  accreditation  for \nmadrasahs, especially private ones, will help assure quality-oriented inputs and sustainability. \nThe Government will revise the BOS funding policy based on minimum fixed costs for schools to \nrun  the  teaching\u2013learning  process,  in  lieu  of  the  previous  per  capita  student  allocation. \nGovernment commitment to education is firm and has been continuously growing in recent \nyears, thus lending considerable empirical weight to projected fiscal requirements.  \n \n17.  The fiscal outlook and prospects of sustainability of sector financing are encouraging. \nThe  economic  outlook  is  favorable,  with  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  expected  to \ncontinue to grow by around 5% from 2006 onward.11 Public expenditure on education is low\u2014\nabout  1.7%  of  GDP  in  2006.  The  recent  increases  in  education  budget  allocations  are \nconsistent with government commitment to meet constitutional targets. Nevertheless, the project \nfocus on strengthening school governance and management is designed to ensure that parental \ncontributions to madrasahs are not crowded out and increased government and project funding \nis additional and not substitute financing. \n \n18.  A financial plan in the form of cost table showing fiscal impact of the Project has been \nprepared and provides funding sources necessary to ensure the availability of adequate funds \nto finance project expenditures. This applies to the entire implementation period to ensure that \nfunds are available to cover both capital and recurrent expenditures over the entire operating \nperiod of the loan. The Government\u2019s share in the Project is estimated at $21.4 million over 5 \nyears  and  will  consist  mainly  of  madrasah  block  grants  for  quality  improvement,  staff \ndevelopment, consultant services, and incremental recurrent cost due to the Project. Given \nGDP growth rates of 5% per annum and current public expenditure projections for education, \nthe Government contribution is feasible and sustainable. \n \n19.  It is estimated that project-related expenditures will increase annually and reach $71.4 \nmillion during the last year of the Project in accordance with the increasing number of teachers \nand  non-teaching  staff  required  for  incremental  madrasah  classes  and  operation  and \nmaintenance expenses. Given the size of the projected education sector budget, the continuing \nadditional incremental costs of $2.5 million annually after the project period would add $0.5 \nmillion to the total in 2009\u20132010, which is judged affordable and sustainable. \n                                                 \n11 World Bank. .
