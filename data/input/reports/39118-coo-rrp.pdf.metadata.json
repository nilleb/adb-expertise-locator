They  are  weather  systems  with  strong  winds  that  circulate \nanticlockwise  around  low-pressure  areas  in  the  northern  hemisphere  and  clockwise  in  the \nsouthern  hemisphere.  They  are  capable  of  causing  massive  destruction  in  three  ways:  by \nhigh  winds,  heavy  rainfall  causing  inland  flooding;  and  storm-surge  flooding.  Tropical \ncyclones form near the equator near the open sea where the surface temperature is at least \n26\u00b0  Celsius.  They  may  last  with  destructive  power  for  2  weeks  or  more.  The  warm  sea \nprovides the overlying atmosphere with a continuous supply of energy and moisture, first to \ngenerate a tropical cyclone and then to maintain its destructive violence as it moves forward. \nThe diameter of a tropical storm, called the eye, may have a diameter ranging from 20\u2013150 \nkilometers  (km)  The  source  of  energy  is  cut  off  when  the  storm  crosses  a  coastline  and \nmoves inland, thus reducing its destructive power.  \n\nThe Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale uses a 1\u20135 rating to measure the cyclone\u2019s intensity and \nis used to give an estimate of the potential property damage and flooding expected along the \ncoast  from  a  cyclone  landfall.  Wind  speed  is  the  determining  factor  in  the  scale,  as  storm-\nsurge values are highly dependent on the slope of the continental shelf in the landfall region. \n \n\nDescription of Hurricane \n\nCategory \n\nFive \n\nInvolving winds greater than 249 km per hour (km/hr) and storm surge generally \ngreater than 6 meters above normal, it is capable of causing complete roof failure \non  residential  and  industrial  buildings;  complete  building  failure  with  small  utility \nbuildings blown over or away; blowing away shrubs, trees, and signs; destruction \nof mobile homes; severe and extensive window and door damage; interruption of \nlow-lying escape routes with rising water; major damage to lower floor structures \nlocated  less  than  5  meters  above  sea  level  and  within  450  meters  of  the \nshoreline;  and  typically  requires  evacuation  of  residential  areas  on  low  ground \nwithin 8\u201316 km of the shoreline. \n\n\fFour \n\nThree  \n\nTwo \n\nOne  \n\nInvolving winds of 210\u2013249 km/hr and storm surge generally at 4\u20136 meters above \nnormal,  it  is  capable  of  causing  extensive  curtain-wall  failure;  complete  roof \nstructure failure on small residences; strewn shrubs, trees, and tearing of signs; \ncomplete destruction of mobile homes; extensive damage to doors and windows, \nand interruption of low-lying escape routes with rising water in 3\u20135 hours before \narrival of the hurricane center; and major damage to lower floors and structures \nnear  the  shore.  Terrain  lower  than  3  meters  above  sea  level  may  be  flooded \nrequiring massive evacuation of residential areas as far inland as 10 km. \n\nInvolving winds of 178\u2013209 km/hr and storm surge generally of 3\u20134 meters above \nnormal, it is capable of causing structural damage to small residences and utility \nbuildings  with  a  minor  amount  of  curtain-wall  failure,  blowing  down  trees, \ndestruction  of  mobile  homes  and  poorly  constructed  signs,  interruption  of  low-\nlying  escape  routes  by  rising  water  3\u20135  hours  before  arrival  of  the  hurricane \ncenter, destruction of smaller coastal structures due to flooding, damage to larger \nstructures due to battering of floating debris, and continuous inundation of terrain \nlower than 1.5 meters above mean sea level 13 km or more inland. Evacuation of \nlow-lying residences within several blocks of the shoreline may be required.  \n\nInvolving  winds  of  154\u2013176  km/hr  and  storm  surge  generally  2\u20133  meters  above \nnormal, it is capable of causing damage to roofing material, doors, and windows \nof buildings; considerable damage to shrubbery and trees with some trees blown \ndown; damage to mobile homes, poorly constructed signs, and piers; flooding of \ncoastal and low-lying escape routes for 2\u20134 hours before arrival of the hurricane, \nand small craft in unprotected anchorages break moorings.  \n\nInvolves winds of 119\u2013153 km/hr with storm surge generally 1.5\u20132 meters above \nnormal,  it  may  not  cause  any  real  damage  to  building  structures,  but  could \ndamage unanchored mobile homes, shrubbery, and trees, and poorly constructed \nsigns; flood coastal roads; and result in minor pier damage. \n\n \nNOTE \n \nThe fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 June. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of S.

An initial environmental examination was undertaken \n(summarized in Appendix 8). \n\nThe  Cyclone  Emergency  Assistance  Project  will  mitigate  social \nand economic impacts of the 2005 cyclone damage by providing \nconcessional  resources  for  the  Government  to  meet  the  costs  of \nthe  recovery  under  a  burden-shared  recovery  program  and  thus \nhelp  the  Government  manage  public  finances  prudently,  despite \nadditional and unforeseen recovery expenditures.  \n\nThe  2005  cyclones  caused  considerable  damage  to  essential \npublic infrastructure, businesses, and private homes. In the outer \nislands,  disruption  of  productive  activities  has  possible  long-term \neconomic  implications.  The  Government  has  taken  immediate \naction to implement an emergency assistance program to alleviate \nthe human suffering associated with the cyclone damage, and has \nprepared a comprehensive recovery assessment and program for \nmitigating  the  social  and  economic  impacts.  In  addition  to  the \nrecovery  costs  borne  by \nthe \ncomprehensive  damage  assessment  amounts  to  US$7.9  million, \nan  expenditure  that  would  place  a  considerable  burden  on  the \nGovernment  budget,  redirecting  funds  from  (i)  development \nprograms and productive assets to rebuilding activities, and (ii) the \nreserves built for debt repayment. The Government has requested \ninvolving \nthat  a  cooperative  burden-sharing  arrangement, \nhouseholds, businesses, the Government, the aid community, and \nthe  proposed  Project,  be  implemented  to  meet  the  unforeseen \nand additional recovery expenditures. \n\nthe  business  community, \n\nThe Project\u2019s main objective is to contribute to the sustainability of \neconomic growth by minimizing the damaging impact of the 2005 \ncyclones.  The  Project  supports  (i)  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to \nimplement  a  comprehensive  recovery  action  plan  to  mitigate  the \nsocioeconomic impact of the cyclones by financing additional and \nunforeseen  recovery  expenditures,  and  (ii)  prudent  financial \nmanagement  of  Government  fiscal  resources  and  continued \nadherence  to  the  performance  ratios  under  the  1998  Manila \nAgreement. Eligible items to be financed under the Project include \nexpenditures in all categories of the recovery program, such as (i) \ncleanup, (ii) reinstatement of public services, (iii) reinstatement of \nessential structures and buildings, and (iv) materials and supplies. \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nThese  categories  will  restore  the  functionality  of  public  utilities \n(such  as  water  and  power),  education,  health,  and  transport \nsector  services.  Eligible  expenditures  will  be  selected  based  on \nboth general criteria aimed at ensuring that project resources are \nutilized only to respond to the recovery needs; and specific criteria \nidentified under the functional areas. Eligible expenditures include \n\nroads: repair and cleanup of roads, bridges, and drainage; \n\nports: restore functionality or to a condition existing before \nthe cyclone damage; \n\npower  supply:  repair  of  power  poles,  transformers, \ncertain  high  voltage  power  lines,  distribution  lines,  and \ndistribution infrastructure; \n\n(iv) \n\nwater supply: restore facilities to precyclone condition;  \n\nwaste  management:  restore \ncondition; \n\nfacilities \n\nto  precyclone \n\nbuildings:  repair  hospitals,  health  centers,  staff  quarters, \nand administrative buildings of government agencies; and \n\ngeneral  cleanup:  remove  fallen  trees  and  related  debris \ncaused by the cyclones. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nCost Estimates \n\nThe total project cost, including physical and price contingencies, \ninterest  and  other  charges,  is  estimated  at  US$7.9  million \nequivalent,  comprising  US$1.8  million  equivalent  (23%)  in  local \ncurrency and US$6.1 million (77%) in foreign exchange. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  % \n\nSource \n\nAmount \n(US$ million) \n2.83 \n2.52 \n \n1.16 \n1.36 \n7.87 \n\nADB \nHouseholds \nGovernments of Australia \nand New Zealand \nGovernment \n             Total \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  36%  of  costs \nunder  all  eligible  cost  categories  of  the  recovery  program.  The \nremainder  of  the  costs  will  be  covered  by  households  (32%), \nGovernment  of  the  Cook  Islands  (15%),  and  the  governments  of \nAustralia and New Zealand (17%). \n\n36 \n32 \n \n15 \n17 \n100 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\nA  loan  of  SDR1,895,000  (US$2.83  million  equivalent)  will  be \nprovided from the Special Funds resources. The loan will have a \n40-year term including a grace period of 10 years, an interest rate \nof  1%  per  year,  and  repayment  of  principal  at  2%  a  year  for  the \nfirst 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter. \n\nPeriod of \nUtilization \n\nUntil November 2007 \n\n\fEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\nApril 2007 \n\nExecuting \nAgencies \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting \nServices \n\n \n\niii\n\nMinistry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM)  \n\nMFEM  will  establish  a  project  management  unit,  comprising  a \nproject  manager  and  an  accountant,  with  a  professional \naccountancy  designation.  The  unit  will  report  to  the  MFEM \nfinancial  secretary  and  operate  under  the  guidance  of  a  steering \ncommittee  involving  the  heads  of  the  implementing  agencies:  (i) \nMinistry  of  Works;  (ii)  Cook  Islands  Investment  Corporation, \nincluding  the  Ports  Authority  and  Te  Aponga  Uira  O  Tumu-Te-\nVarovaro  (Te  Aponga  Uira-Power  Authority),  Rarotonga;  (iii) \nOffice  of \nIsland  Administration;  and  (iv) \nrepresentatives  of  development  partner  organizations,  as \nappropriate. The disbursements will be made through an imprest \naccount for payments for eligible expenditures selected, based on \nagreed  criteria.  The  project  accounts  will  be  audited  annually  by \nexternal auditors. \n\nthe  Minister \n\nfor \n\nProcurement  of  goods,  services,  and  works  will  be  carried  out \nconsistent  with  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement  with  the  flexible \ninterpretation  permitted for  emergency  assistance loans provided \nin  accordance  with  ADB  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance \nPolicy (2004) to ensure maximum expediency in implementing the \nrecovery  program.  The  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  will  finance \nimports  of  goods  and  services,  local  purchases,  and  civil  works \nidentified  under  the  comprehensive  damage  assessment.  Under \nADB Guidelines for Procurement, these may be procured through \ndirect  purchase,  international  shopping,  or  local  competitive \nbidding,  as  appropriate.  ADB  has  approved  the  use  of  advance \nprocurement, retroactive financing, and local cost financing. Both \nlocal and prudent international shopping is recommended with the \nbid  period  reduced  from  30  to  7\u201315  days.  In  the  case  of  local \ncontractors,  a  registration  system  that  lists  approved  contractors \nbased on criteria such as experience, and financial and technical \ncapacity  may  be  used.  Unit  cost  tenders  are  recommended  for \nuse  of  local  contractors,  reflecting  procurement  procedures  used \nfor normal commercial practices by the private sector. Community \nparticipation will be encouraged in all recovery activities. \n\nProject management will require approximately 58 person-months \nof consulting services for a project manager; an accountant with a \nprofessional  accountancy  designation;  and  technical  support  for \nspecific  assessments,  detailed  design,  contract  supervision,  and \nquality  control.  The  project  manager  will  engage  consultants  as \nneeded for specific recovery activities. The Government will select \nthese services in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants.  \n\nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nThe  burden-shared  recovery  program  will  mitigate  the  otherwise \nextended  negative \nthe  2005  cyclone  damage, \nparticularly  on  the  poor,  and  enable  the  country  to  recover  from \n\nimpacts  of \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nTechnical \nAssistance \n\nthe  emergency  with  only  a  temporary  setback.  The  immediate \nbenefit  of  the  recovery  program  is  the  reinstatement  of  basic \nservices,  including  water  and  power  supply,  transport  sector \nfunctionality,  and  education  and  health  sector  services.  The \nProject  will  support  prudent \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  resources  enabling  maintenance  of  fiscal \nviability  and  debt  servicing  by  maximizing  the  concessional \nfunding for recovery expenditures.  \n\nfinancial  management  of \n\nThe  risks  related  to  efficient  and  prudent  management  of  quick-\ndisbursing recovery resources, including corruption and misuse of \nfunds  to  purposes  not  related  to  the  recovery  phase,  are \naddressed  by  (i)  established  and  agreed  detailed  selection \nimplementation  and  monitoring \ncriteria; \nmechanisms  involving  a  group  of  implementing  agencies  in  the \ndecision  making;  (iii)  engagement  of  adequate  human  resources \nfor  project  management,  including  for  safeguarding  financial \naccounting  and  control  of  expenditures  under  the  loan;  and  (iv) \nexternal audit of accounts. \n\ntransparent \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  24-month  implementation  period  is  sufficient,  given  action \nalready under way under the recovery program, using retroactive \nfunding  available  under  the  Project,  and  streamlined  project \nmanagement procedures.  \n\nADB  will  provide  a  technical  assistance  grant  of  $600,000  for \nStrengthening  Disaster  Management  and  Mitigation  aimed  at  (i) \nestablishing  a  rapid,  effective,  and  robust  response  capability \nthrough  efficiently  coordinated  networks  of  skilled  personnel  to \nadminister  the  current  and  future  recovery  response  operations; \nand  (ii)  preparing  an  integrated  and  environmentally  sustainable \ninfrastructure  master  plan  involving  infrastructure  designs  that \nincorporate  climate  change  adaptation  and  disaster  mitigation \nstrategies.  \n\n\f \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nloan  to  the  Cook  Islands  for  the  Cyclone  Emergency  Assistance  Project.  The  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Disaster Management and \nMitigation  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nNatural Disasters in the Cook Islands \n\n2. \nThe Cook Islands consists of 15 widely dispersed small islands, comprising two main \ngroups, the southern Cook Islands (Rarotonga, Mangaia, Atiu, Aitutaki, Mauke, Mitiaro, and \nManuae  and  Takukea)  and  the  northern  Cook  Islands  (Nassau,  Palmerston,  Penrhyn, \nManihiki, Rakahanga, Pukapuka, and Suwarrow). Rarotonga, with a land area of 67 square \nkilometers (km2), is the largest; the smallest is Suwarrow (0.4 km2). The total land area of the \ncountry  is  240  km2,  while  its  exclusive  economic  zone  covers  a  maritime  area  of  nearly  2 \nmillion  km2.  Most  of  the  islands  are  flat  atolls,  easily  prone  to  inundation  by  storm  surges. \nOnly Rarotonga is mountainous; its highest peak is 653 meters. \n \n3. \nThe  climate  is  maritime  tropical,  dominated  by  easterly  trade  winds  and  a  marked \nseasonality  in  the  rainfall  regime.  The  dry  season  is  from  May  to  October  and  the  wet \nseason  from  November  to  April.  The  wet  season  is  also  the  tropical  cyclone  season, \nassociated  with  an  easterly  shift  of  the  South  Pacific  Convergence  Zone  over  the  country. \nThe climate can vary significantly, especially in relation to the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation. \n \n4. \nTropical cyclone activity is more frequent during an El Ni\u00f1o event, when warmer than \nnormal  sea  surface  temperatures  (+26\u00b0Celsius  [C])  coincide  with  an  eastward  migration  of \nthe South Pacific Convergence Zone. This occurred in the vicinity of the Cook Islands and \nthe French Polynesia in February\u2013March 2005. During an El Ni\u00f1o event, the southern Cook \nIslands experiences a reduction in rainfall, to as little as 60% of normal, while in the northern \nCook Islands rainfall can increase to as much as 300% above normal.  \n\n \n5. \nDuring the 1997/98 El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation event, tropical cyclones Martin and \nPam caused extensive damage to property and infrastructure and brought human suffering, \nincluding loss of lives. The southern group of islands experienced a prolonged drought. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) supported the economic restoration of Manihiki, Pukapuka, \nand  Rakahanga  islands  after  a  disaster  caused  by  Cyclone  Martin  with  the  Cyclone \nEmergency  Rehabilitation  Project  in  1997.1  The  most  damaging  single  cyclone  event  in \nrecent history was Cyclone Sally in 1987, with damage estimated to reach 66% of the gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP);  it  devastated  the  airport,  beach  hotels,  tourist  resorts,  and \nbusinesses near the sea. \n  \nB. \n\n2005 Cyclone Impact  \n\n6. \nBetween 4 February and 8 March 2005, the Cook Islands experienced five damaging \ncyclones.  Their  wind  speeds  exceeded  200  kilometers  per  hour  (kph)  with  cyclone  Meena \npeaking at 280 kph; cyclone Nancy at 241 kph; cyclone Olaf at 259 kph, and cyclone Percy \nat 212 kph. Four of the five cyclones were given the maximum severity rating of category 5. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \n\nGovernment of the Cook Islands for the Cyclone Emergency Rehabilitation Project. Manila. \n\n\f 2 \n\nThe  first  three  cyclones  formed  close  to  Samoa  and  the  last  two  near  Tuvalu  with  sea \nsurface temperatures recorded at a high of 32\u00b0C. The cyclone tracking map and activity is \ndescribed in Appendix 2. \n \nC. \n\nCyclone Damage Assessment \n\n7. \nThe Government asked the Cook Islands Investment Corporation (CIIC), responsible \nfor  the  management  of  public  assets,  to  prepare  a  damage  assessment  report  on \ngovernment  properties  after  cyclones  Meena,  Nancy,  and  Olaf.  In  addition,  stakeholder \ntheir  responsibility. \nministries  prepared  separate  damage  reports  on  assets  under \nCoordinated  by  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  these  reports  provide  a  comprehensive \ndamage assessment.  \n \nComponent 1: Roads, Bridges, and Drainage. On Rarotonga, Aitutaki, Mauke, and \n8. \nMangaia, the cyclones caused considerable road damage. The storm surge deposited debris \non  coastal  roads  and  downed  trees.  The  Ministry  of  Works  engaged  in  an  immediate \ncleanup operation (commencing 6 February), removing debris (mainly coral rocks and sand) \nand trees and repairing roads. These operations continued as subsequent cyclones added \nto the damage. By 9 March, cleanup works and repairs to road pavements were substantially \ncomplete. \n \n9. \nComponent  2:  Ports.  Harbors  on  Rarotonga,  Aitutaki,  Atiu,  Mauke,  Mangaia,  and \nPukapuka  were  damaged.  In  the  main  port  of  Avatiu  on  Rarotonga,  wharf  facilities \nexperienced  general  damage  as  a  result  of  Cyclone  Meena,  and  then  incurred  extensive \nbreakwater  damage  as  a  result  of  cyclones  Nancy  and  Olaf.  Damage  to  the  harbor  on \nAitutaki  consisted  of  scour  behind  the  wharf  wall.  On  Mauke  and  Mangaia,  damaged \nslipways  require  urgent  temporary  repairs  to  make  them  useable.  On Pukapuka,  the wharf \nwall  incurred  scour  and  collapsed,  and  must  be  reconstructed.  At  Avatiu,  repairs  to  wharf \nfacilities are complete, but the harbor basin needs to be cleared of debris. At Aitutaki, repairs \nto the wharf wall are complete. On Mauke and Mangaia, some clearing has been undertaken \nto  permit  use  of  slipways  by  small  craft;  major  clearing  work  remains.  No  repairs  have  yet \nbeen carried out at Pukapuka. \n \n10. \nComponent 3: Power Supply. Power supplies were affected because underground \nhigh  voltage  cables  were  exposed  to  sea  scour,  and  sea  spray  and  water  damaged  six \nsubstations. Low voltage feeders were extensively damaged by falling trees. The majority of \nthe  low  voltage  feeders  have  been  temporarily  restored  but  the  lines  themselves  have \nsustained  damage  and  need  to  be  replaced.  The  underground  high  voltage  cables  remain \nisolated; no repairs have yet been undertaken. No repairs have been undertaken thus far to \nthe affected substations. \n \n11. \nComponent  4:  Water  Supplies.  Water  supplies  escaped  major  damage,  although \ntanks  and  roof  catchments  on  Pukapuka  and  Nassau  were  affected.  Communal  and \nindividual  water  tanks  were  either  damaged  or  contaminated  by  seawater.  Therefore,  the \ndelivery  of  fresh  drinking  water  became  a  priority  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  Cyclone \nPercy.  However,  inhabitants  were  able  to  construct  temporary  water  catchments,  sufficient \nfor  their  basic  needs.  On  Rarotonga,  access  to  water  treatment  facilities  was  blocked  and \ndamaged, and filter media requires replacement due to heavy siltation. \n \n12. \nComponent  5:  Waste  Management.  The  new  waste  management  landfill  in \nRarotonga  suffered  damage  to  its  control  center  and  rain  cover  along  with  other  minor \n\n\f \n\n3\n\ndamage.  The  new  facility  cannot  commence  operations  until  this  damage  is  repaired.  This \nfacility was financed by the ADB Waste Management Project.2 \n \n13. \nComponent  6:  Buildings  and  Materials.  CIIC  assessed  damage  to  Government \nbuildings.  Many  have  severe  damage  to  roofs  and  consequent  damage  to  internal  fixtures \nand  fittings.  Similar  damage  was  sustained  by  many  private  residences.  On  Pukapuka, \ndamage  to  buildings  was  particularly  severe  following  Cyclone  Percy  with  only  a  few \nescaping intact. Repairs commenced immediately on Rarotonga and are ongoing. On other \nislands, repairs have yet to commence. \n \n14. \nComponent  7:  General  Cleanup.  On  many  islands,  fallen  trees,  debris  from  the \nwater surge, and wind damage closed roads and passageways, filled drains, and prevented \naccess in general. Removal and deposit of all debris is a high priority.  \n \n15. \nAgriculture.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  assessed  damage  to  agriculture  on  all \nislands.  The  extent  of  loss  varies  depending  on  the  type  of  crop  and  location,  but \nsubsistence gardens were particularly affected. Availability of local produce in the markets in \nmid March was extremely limited with recovery expected to take up to 12 months. \n \n16. \nrepaired.  \n \nAirports.  Airports  suffered  only  minor  damage.  The  Mangaia  airstrip  sustained \n17. \nerosion  damage.  The  western  end  of  the  international  airport  was  protected  by  bunds  and \nthe presence of the main road and seawall. The road did however suffer some scour as did \nthe  buried  high  voltage  power  cable.  The  road  has  been  repaired  but  not  the  high  voltage \ncable. Further work is necessary at Mangaia as repairs to date are only temporary. \n \nD. \n\nTelecommunications.  Damage  to  telecommunications  was  slight  and  quickly \n\nMacroeconomic Impact \n\nIn  spite  of  the  common  labor  market  and  monetary  association  with  New  Zealand, \n18. \nthe  Cook  Island\u2019s  economy  is  vulnerable  because  of  its  smallness,  narrowly  based  island \neconomy,  and  political  culture  that  need  strong  administrative  oversight.  In  response  to \nmounting financial crises, in 1996 the Government adopted an economic reform program to \ncorrect  economic  imbalances  and  restore  debt  sustainability  with  the  support  of  ADB-\nfacilitated  debt  restructuring.3  The  Government  remains  committed  to  the  objectives  of  the \n1998  Manila  Agreement4  and  the  associated  reform  program  aimed  at  prudent  economic \nmanagement to generate growth and fiscal stability.  \n \n19. \nThe  country\u2019s  economy  achieved  its  sixth  consecutive  year  of  growth  in  2004. \nPreliminary data indicate that real GDP grew  by 3.4%. The primary contributors to GDP of \nNZ$238  million  (2003),  or  NZ$12,965  per  capita,  are  tourism  (54%),  including  the  related \nretail,  wholesale,  and  other  consumption  and  financial  services;  agriculture  and  fisheries \n(16%); transportation (15%), and public administration (12%).  \n \n20. \nThe  good  economic  conditions  helped  strengthen  the  fiscal  position  during  2004, \nleading to small increases in both the operating balance and net lending. Inflation was low at \n0.9%,  attributable  to  a  combination  of  an  overall  sound  fiscal  position;  appreciation  of  the \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \n\nGovernment of the Cook Islands for the Waste Management Project. Manila. \n\n3   ADB. 1996. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \n\nGovernment of the Cook Islands for the Economic Restructuring Program. Manila. \n\n4   In 1998, ADB served as an honest broker in the restructuring of Cook Island\u2019s debt to four countries: France, \n\nItaly, Nauru, and New Zealand. \n\n\f 4 \n\nNZ$  (the  currency  used  by  the  Cook  Islands);  and  low  inflation  in  New  Zealand,  the  main \nsource of imports. \n \n21. \nThe improved fiscal conditions were recognized in October 2004, when Standard and \nPoor\u2019s  Rating  Services  lifted  the  long-term  rating  on  the  Cook  Islands  to  BB\u2013  from  B+, \nreflecting the fourth upward revision of the rating since the initial B\u2013/C rating was assigned in \nJanuary  1998.  This  improvement  was  achieved  with  debt  restructuring,  debt  repayments, \nand accumulation of cash debt repayment reserves.  \n \nHowever, the Cook Islands was put on credit watch in early 2005 in light of economic \n22. \nthreat  of  the  cyclones. Weakening of  the  Government\u2019s  credit  quality relates  to  (i)  incurred \ncosts  to  the  economy;  (ii)  recovery  expenditures  in  excess  of  fiscal  capacity;  and  (iii) \nweakening fiscal revenues as a result of weaker economic activity after the 2005 cyclones, \nparticularly  in  the  dominant  tourism  sector.5  External  assistance,  particularly  through  the \nProject, is necessary for the Government to meet the recovery expenditures in a manner that \nfosters prudent financial management of public resources and adherence to the performance \nratios  agreed  in  the  1998  Manila  Agreement.  Concessional  funding  to  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  resource  management,  reinstatement  of  normal  social  and  economic \nactivities, and mitigation of the broader negative impacts on the economy will help to restore \nthe credit quality of the country.  \n \nE. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Response \n\n1. \n\nEmergency Response \n\n23.  With  tropical  cyclones  part  of  the  maritime  environment  of  the  Cook  Islands,  the \nNational Hurricane Safety Plan consolidates6 procedures and department responsibilities in \naddressing  cyclone  threats.  In  accordance  with  arrangements  under  the  purview  of  the \nInternational Meteorological Organization, the Cook Islands Meteorological Services (CIMS), \na  department  of  the  Police,  received  the  2005  cyclone  warnings  from  the  Fiji  Regional \nMeteorological  Service Center, in  Nadi,  Fiji  Islands.  In  addition,  CIMS obtained  information \nfrom  a  variety  of  sources  on  weather  patterns  and  warnings,  including  from  the  Honolulu \nTsunami  Center  and  Fiji  Regional  Meteorological  Service  Center.  CIMS  disseminated \nwarnings  to  the  chief  hurricane  safety  officer,  an  assignment  designated  to  the  police \ncommissioner under the Hurricane Safety Act of 1973 and to the population through special \nweather  bulletins  using  three  modes  of  communications:  public  radio,  telephone,  and  very \nhigh  frequency  radio  communications.  On  the  outer  islands,  local  police  implemented \ninstructions  received  and  reported  back  to  the  chief  hurricane  safety  officer,  who  in  turn \nbriefed the National Emergency Operation Center on the hourly feedback from the islands. \nRadio  Cook  Islands  broadcast  information  on  the  cyclone  threat  24  hours  a  day,  and  the \nGovernment mobilized the Rarotonga Hurricane Center to coordinate disaster preparedness \nactivities in the capital and with other islands. Several evacuation centers were established \nin  response  to  the  cyclones.7  Some  low-lying  areas  were  evacuated  and  shelters  set  up. \nWhile  the  Government  did  not  declare  a  state  of  emergency  for  the  first  three  cyclones,  a \nstate of emergency was declared for Pukapuka and Nassau islands during the fourth, given \nthe  serious  damage  and  loss  of  most  homes  and  food  crops.  Thanks  to  efficient \ndissemination of early warning information, no human casualties were incurred.  \n \n24. \nThe Government and its agencies managed early warning information dissemination \nand  evacuation,  provided  emergency  relief  to  the  affected  population  with  the  support  of \n                                                 \n5   Melbourne, 18 Feb 2005.

While \nfor  disaster \nthe  National  Hurricane  Safety  Plan  provides  guidance \nmanagement,  operational  procedures  and  agency  roles  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  a \ndisaster  are  not  clearly  set  out  or  followed,  and  disaster  management  is  susceptible  to \ninefficiencies. The recovery assessments and response management is spread over several \nagencies and ad hoc committees, including the 5-person Emergency Operations Committee, \nenlarged  National  Disaster  Management  Team  established  on  21  February  2005  and \nchaired  by  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  chief  of  staff,  Cyclone  Aid  Coordination  Committee \nestablished on 24 February 2004, and National Emergency Operation Center convened on \nan  ad  hoc  basis  to  respond  to  the  emergency  caused  by  the  cyclones.  Strengthening  of \ndisaster  and  recovery  management,  including  damage  assessment,  aid  management,  and \noperational  coordination  is  immediately  required  to  ensure  rapid,  effective,  and  robust \nresponse  by  an  efficient  network  of  skilled  personnel  and  procedures.  Strengthening  of \nfinancial controls is also needed for management of fast-disbursing recovery funds.  \n \n\n\f 6 \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment and Prevention \n\n26. \nThe Government recognizes the deficiencies of the immediate response mounted to \nsupport emergency and humanitarian action. Accordingly, the Government is keen to review \n(i) the prevailing regional, national, and subnational strategies for emergency response; (ii) \nconcepts  and  instruments  for  crises  prevention  and  application  in  economic  development \nand development cooperation; (iii) standards for service delivery and essential infrastructure \nto  address  weather-related  vulnerabilities  and  protection  of  key  infrastructure  and  climate \nchange  adaptation,  including  reinforcement  of  vulnerable  structures  and  adjustment  of \nbuilding and land-use zones; (iv) construction of breakwater protection for the town center, \nport, other key national assets, and low-lying areas; (v) hazard reduction technology; and (vi) \ninfrastructure management and governance conditions in keeping with the prudent financial \nmanagement  framework  provided  in  the  1998  Manila  Agreement.  To  develop  a  pragmatic \napproach,  the  Government  has  asked  ADB  to  provide  TA  to  strengthen  disaster \nmanagement and mitigation (paras. 70\u201371) to review 20-year infrastructure requirements, in \naccordance  with  international  practices,  and  prepare  an  integrated  plan  to  support  the \neconomic  and  social  development  of  the  Cook  Islands,  incorporating  climate  change \nadaptation concepts and improvements in infrastructure sector governance.  \n \nF. \n\nFinancing Recovery Needs  \n\n27. \nSince  Cyclone  Olaf,  Government  agencies  have  been  occupied  with  preparing \ndamage  assessments  with  the support  of  the  Government  interagency  teams  for  the  outer \nislands,  Red  Cross,  and  United  Nations  Disaster  Assessment  Group.  The  recovery \nassessment identified damage costs on a replacement basis. Restoration of public assets is \nestimated  using  selective  criteria  for  reinstating  functionality  of  the  service  to  a  safe  and \nproductive standard, thus removing facilities that add only limited value to service delivery. \nTotal damage is estimated at NZ$10.5 million (US$7.9 million). In spite of the current budget \nreserves,  the  Government  lacks  resources  to  finance  the  immediate  recovery  and \nreinstatement of basic services. \n \n\n1. \n\nFunding the Recovery Costs \n\n28. \nFunding  of  the  recovery  program  will  be  arranged  within  provisions  of  the  1998 \nManila  Agreement  (footnote  3).  The  Manila  Agreement,  supported  by  ADB,  enabled  the \nCook Islands to resolve a serious fiscal and economic crisis and resulted in a rescheduling \nof  debt  to  the  country\u2019s  official  bilateral  creditors.  The  associated  reform  program  led  to \nimproved country economic performance. The debt restructuring reduced the face value of \nthe Government\u2019s debt by more than 30% and provided concessions on interest rates. The \nGovernment\u2019s borrowing capacity has since improved with net debt reduced to 38% of GDP \n(June 2004), compared with 109% in June 1997.  \n \n29. \nBy June 2005, debt reserves are expected to amount to NZ$18.4 million against total \nborrowings  of  NZ$97.8  million.  These  financial  assets  are  deposited  with  local  commercial \nbanks. Standard & Poor\u2019s considers the country\u2019s investment rating would be at risk if these \nreserves are spent before they can be used for debt repayment. To ensure prudent financial \nmanagement and viability of its public finances, the Government is determined not to spend \nthese  reserves  to  finance  the  additional  and  unforeseen  expenditures  arising  from  the \nrecovery  related  to  the  2005  cyclones.  Moreover,  to  finance  these  expenditures,  the \nGovernment  has  requested  a  loan  under  the  ADB  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance \nPolicy.  Due  to  the  high  level  of  concessional  resources,  the  Project  will  increase  the  debt \nservice obligation of the Cook Islands by only 0.9% in the first 10 years and by 1.4% in the \nnext 20 years, and will increase the debt to GDP ratio to 41% from the current 38%. \n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n30. \nThe Government revised its forecast for 2004/05 fiscal revenues by a total of NZ$2.0 \nmillion, from NZ$70 million to NZ$68 million; NZ$1.0 million of which is due to the cyclone \nimpact.  In  response  to  the  damage  reports  and  the  related  unforeseen  demand  for  fiscal \nresources,  the  Government  has  approved  appropriations  exceeding  budget  revenues  by \nNZ$1.5  million,  referring  to  Section  70(3)(b)  of  the  Constitution,  which  authorizes \nexpenditure of funds in excess of budget resources without prior approval of the Parliament \nand equivalent to 1.5% of the total budget. These funds will be expended in addition to the \nNZ$480,000 budget allocation for the recovery program.8  \n \n\n2. \n\nPortfolio Management and Restructuring \n\nThe  TA  portfolio \n\n31. \nThe  ADB  program  for  the  Cook  Islands  includes  one  loan  of  $2.2  million  for  waste \nmanagement; the project is near completion.9 The project incurred cost overruns due to (i) \nunfavorable  movements  in  the  SDR  currencies  against  the  New  Zealand  dollar,  in  which \nproject costs were denominated; and (ii) technical reasons. Consequently, the loan proceeds \nhave been expended and are not available for reallocation. \n \ntwo  ongoing  TAs:  Strengthening  Economic  and \n32. \nDevelopment  Planning  and  Management,  and  Legal  and  Institutional  Strengthening  for \nImplementation  of  Cook  Islands  Environment  Act  of  2003.  The  former  will  be  canceled \nbecause  the  Government  is  making  its  own  resources  available  for  the  national  planning \nprocesses. The  latter  TA  is  providing  helpful  advice  on  implementation  of  the  Environment \nAct to the Ministry of National Environmental Services and the Crown Law Office (Office of \nthe Solicitor General).  \n \nG. \n\nResponse of the Development Partners \n\ninvolves \n\n33. \nThe  governments  of  Australia,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  France,  and  New \nZealand;  Pacific  Forum,  Red  Cross;  and  United  Nations  agencies,  particularly  through  the \nUnited  Nations  Disaster  Assessment  Group,  provided  assistance \nimmediate \nhumanitarian and emergency relief. The Aid Management Division of the Ministry of Finance \nand Economic Management (MFEM) manages disbursement of the relief and recovery aid. \nThe  donors,  particularly  the  governments  of  New  Zealand  and  Australia,  have  agreed  to  \nreallocate  funds  from  ongoing  aid  programs  to  cover  additional  restoration  requirements \nrelated  to  assets  receiving  support  from  these  regular  aid  programs.  These  funds  will \ncontribute to burden-shared financing of the recovery program. \n \nH. \n\nLesson Learned in Disaster Management \n\nfor \n\n1. \n\nDevelopment and Prevention \n\n34. \nIn  the  Pacific,  including  in  the  Cook  Islands,  population  centers  and  economic \nactivities are concentrated in the coastal zones and are vulnerable to the effects of climate \nchange,  particularly  an  increase  in  extreme  weather  events,  and  sea-level  rise.  The  five \nrecent successive cyclones may relate to a changing climate pattern and increased El Ni\u00f1o \neffect.  Concurrently,  development  and  social  change  have  placed  pressure  on  sensitive \necosystems of the Cook Islands. \n \n35. \nGiven  the  unique  climate  change  vulnerabilities  of  the  Cook  Islands,  closer \nmanagement of development will be essential, particularly to protect sensitive coastal areas \nand  foreshores  to  reduce  their  vulnerability  to  the  additional  stresses  arising  from  climate \n                                                 \n8   Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. 9 March 2005.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \n\nCook Islands for the Waste Management Project. Manila. \n\n\f 8 \n\nchange  and  sea-level  rise.  Mainstreaming  climate  change  adaptation  and  sea-level  rise \nissues  into  Government  policy  and  development  programs,  particularly  in  infrastructure \nstandards,  is  essential.  Adaptation  and  mitigation  strategies  need  to  be  based  on  an \nintegrated  and  comprehensive  approach  that  accounts  for  sustainability  concerns,  both \nenvironmental and cultural.  \n \n36. \nIn the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the \nCook Islands highlights the need for a national adaptation strategy that prioritizes measures \nto reduce risks associated with climate change. Climate change manifests through increased \nfrequency  of  extreme  weather  events  rather  than  long-term  trends  in  average  conditions. \nAdapting to the current climate extremes and variability prevents loss of scarce financial and \nother  resources  on  disaster  recovery  and  rehabilitation,  and  is  an  essential  step  to \nwithstanding  climate  changes.  Most  importantly,  climate  change  adaptation  should  be \nincorporated in the design of social as well as infrastructure projects. The Government asked \nfor TA to strengthen disaster management and mitigation (para. 26). The TA will provide a \nframework  for  planning  infrastructure  development  to  support  social  and  economic  welfare \nimprovement  in  the  country  through  policy  and  program  designs  that  incorporate  climate \nchange adaptation, including climate proofing and mitigation strategies.  \n \n\n2. \n\nDisaster and Emergency Management \n\n37.  While  the  country  has  experienced  several  major  cyclones  in  the  past,  the  recent \n2005 cyclones increased awareness of the need for a robust risk management strategy, and \nfor  disaster  and  emergency  management  capacity.  Experience  in  addressing  the  2005 \ncyclones  reveals  that  disaster  management  requires  strengthening  and  clear  lines  of \ncommunication and accountability need to be established. The current disaster management \nmodality is operating without strong guidance and relies on fiscal overspending.  \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n38. \nThe  Government  is  implementing  a  countrywide  recovery  action  plan  with  the \nobjective  of  reinstating  basic  social  services  and  economic  activities.  The  objectives  of  the \nProject are to support the Government by providing concessional financing for expenditures \ncrucial for recovery.  \n \n39. \nThe  Project  will  focus  on  priority  areas  identified  through  consultation  with  the \nGovernment,  private  sector,  civil  society,  and  development  partners  for  reinstatement  of \nbasic  services.  The  expenditures  under  all  categories  of  the  comprehensive  recovery \nassessment  are  eligible  for  funding  under  the  Project,  provided  that  these  relate  to  (i) \ncleanup;  (ii)  infrastructure  reinstatement  (ports,  power  supply,  water  supply  and  sanitation \nincluding  waste  management,  roads,  drainage,  and  bridges);  (iii)  basic  service  delivery \nstructures and facilities (schools, hospitals, government service facilities); and (iv) essential \nmaterials and supplies (learning materials, refurbishment inventory). \n \nB. \n\nMain Features  \n\n40. \nThe Project is designed to allow for maximum flexibility. It includes quick-disbursing \ncomponents  and  retroactive  financing  of  up  to  30%  of  the  loan  proceeds\u2014this  is  available \nfor eligible expenditures incurred prior to project approval. An imprest account will be set up \nfor the loan funds to facilitate payments to suppliers of goods and services, and thus enable \nthe  proceeds  to  benefit  the  victims  of  the  disaster  in  a  timely  manner.  The  Project  is  also \ndesigned to accommodate changes in the recovery costs, which were at best preliminary at \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nthe time of design, through its flexible design and allotted physical contingencies. At the time \nof design, all aid partners had not yet received requests from the  Government for support. \nWith  identification  of  eligible  expenditure  categories  in  the  comprehensive  damage \nassessment, the Project fosters effective partnerships by enabling the Government to apply \ngrant  aid  funding  to  finance  expenditure  items  and  enables  funding  of  the  remaining \nfinancing  gap  by  the  loan  proceeds.  This  design  enables  prudent  public  financial \nmanagement and allows for maximum use of concessional funds in financing the recovery. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nAssessment \n\n1. \n \n41. \nAll  affected  Government  agencies  prepared  damage  assessments,  including  the \nMinistry of Works (for roads, bridges, drainage, water supplies, and waste management on \nRarotonga),  Office  of  the  Minister  for  Island  Administration  (for  roads,  power,  harbors,  and \nbuildings  in  the  outer  islands),  CIIC  (for  government  buildings  and  some  private  buildings \nand  community  facilities  on  Rarotonga  and  the  outer  islands),  Te  Aponga  (the  power \nauthority covering Rarotonga), Cook Islands Telecommunications (all islands), and the Ports \nAuthority (for Rarotonga and Aitutaki). On the basis of these reports, an overall assessment \nof  damage  was  compiled  into  a  comprehensive  recovery  assessment.  Both  incurred \nexpenditures  and  planned  recovery  activities  within  the  scope  of  the  assessment  will  be \neligible for project funding in accordance with the agreed eligibility criteria (paras. 42\u201351). \n \n\n2. \n\nEligibility Criteria \n\n42.   Using the comprehensive damage assessment, the project steering committee (PSC) \n(para.  56)  will  identify  and  select  recovery  activities  for  funding  under  the  Project  in \naccordance with the following general and specific criteria. The recovery activity will \n \n\nrehabilitate or reinstate infrastructure and/or facilities damaged as a result of \nthe 2005 cyclones, as included in the comprehensive recovery assessment; \n\nincorporate  appropriate  cyclone-resistant  design  standards  with  adequate \nprovision for quality control;10 \n\nbe technically feasible, cost-effective, financially sustainable, and represent a \nleast-cost  alternative  with  appropriate  adjustment  for  incorporating  cyclone-\nresistant design; \n\ninclude beneficiary consultation in the selection process; \n\nbe completed within the project implementation period, and \ngive  priority  to  activities  that  restore  functionality  of  the  waste  management \nfacility funded by the Waste Management Project (footnote 2). \n\nRecovery Activities \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n \n3. \n \n\n43.   Component-specific criteria were developed for each of the seven components. \n \n44.   Component  1:  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Drainage.  The  waves  generated  by  the \ncyclones caused roads in coastal areas on Rarotonga and Aitutaki to be blocked by debris. \nThe debris consisted of rocks and sand washed from the foreshore onto the road, as well as \nfallen  trees  and  other  debris.  As  a  consequence,  all  roads  were  impassable  necessitating \n\n                                                 \n10  Cook Islands Buildings Standards Controls and Act 1991; Building Controls and Standards Regulations. 1991; \n\nand Building Code 1990. \n\n\f 10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthe  use  of  machines  and  labor  for  their  clearance.  Similarly,  drains  and  bridge  waterways \nwere blocked by debris. Scour of road surfaces necessitates repairs to the bituminous seal. \nEligible expenditures include the cost of repairs and cleanup of roads, bridges, and drainage. \n\n45.   Component  2:    Ports.  Harbors  were  damaged  in  Rarotonga,  Aitutaki,  Atiu,  and \nPukapuka.  All  damage  to  the  Aitutaki  port  will  be  repaired  using  the  reserves  of  the  Ports \nAuthority.  Infrastructure  affected  includes  harbor  basins  and  access  channels  (requiring \nclearing of rocks and other debris deposited by the waves), concrete ramps, hard standing \nareas,  storage  facilities,  electrical  equipment,  and  lighting.  Pukapuka  wharf  requires \ncomplete  reconstruction.  Eligible  expenditures  include  the  costs  of  repairs  to  ports  and \nharbors  necessary  to  restore  functionality  or  to  a  condition  existing  before  the  cyclone \ndamage. \n \n46.   Component  3:  Power  Supply.  Power  stations  did  not  sustain  serious  structural \ndamage, however, breakage of overhead power lines, damaged power poles, and damaged \ntransformers and other accessories were incurred both on Aitutaki and Rarotonga. Specific \ndamage  was  caused  on  Rarotonga  to  the  high  voltage  line  between  Pokioinu  and  Oasis \nservice  station,  as  well  as  water  damage  to  6  substations.  Eligible  expenditures  include \nrepairs  to  the  specific  damage  on  Rarotonga  noted  here,  along  with  repairs  of  general \ndamage to the distribution lines and distribution infrastructure on Aitutaki. \n\n47. \nComponent 4: Water Supply. Damage to water supply systems includes blockage \nof  access  roads,  contamination  of  filter  beds,  broken  pipes,  and  other  damaged  water \ndistribution infrastructure. Eligible expenditures include the cost of reinstating the facilities to \ntheir  precyclone  condition.  The  Project  does  not  include  provision  for  guttering  and  water \ntanks unless associated with the restoration of a public building. \n\n48. \nComponent  5:  Waste  Management.  Cyclone  damage  to  the  newly  constructed \nwaste  management  facilities  on  Rarotonga  and  Aitutaki  is  to  be  repaired.  Eligible \nexpenditures include those necessary to restore the facilities to their precyclone condition. \n\n49. \nComponent  6:  Buildings  and  Materials.  Government  buildings  in  Rarotonga, \nAitutaki,  Palmerston,  Pukapuka,  and  Nassau  were  damaged  by  the  cyclones.  In particular, \nroofs  have  been  affected  to  varying  degrees  from  limited  loss  of  tin  sheeting  to  complete \nloss. In many cases, loss may be due to inadequate original construction standard, lack of \nmaintenance, or age. In cases where complete renewal of a roof is considered appropriate, \nthe  new  roof  will  be  designed,  constructed,  and  certified  in  accordance  with  the  Building \nControls  and  Standards  of  the  Cook  Islands,11  particularly  as  they  relate  to  cyclone \nresistance.  Eligible  expenditures  will  include  repairs  to  hospitals,  health  centers,  staff \nquarters,  and  administrative  buildings  of  government  agencies;  but  will  exclude  schools \nbeing accommodated under other assistance programs. \n\n50. \nComponent  7:  General  Cleanup.  On  many  islands,  fallen  trees,  debris  from  the \nwater surge, and wind damage closed roads and passageways, filled drains, and prevented \naccess in general. Eligible expenditures include general cleanup of fallen trees, debris from \nwater surge, and other debris.  \n \nThe  recovery  activities  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  the  general  and  the \n51. \nspecific criteria given in paras. 42\u201350. Relevant Government agencies will submit proposed \nrecovery  activities  for  review  of  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  (para.  57)  and  for \nconsideration and approval of the PSC. The recovery activity application for project funding \n\n                                                 \n11  Cook Islands Buildings Standards Controls and Act 1991; Building Controls and Standards Regulations. 1991; \n\nand Building Code 1990. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nincludes (i) a description of the recovery activity and design, as warranted; (ii) an account of \nthe use of internal/budget reserves; (iii) a description of efforts made to obtain grant funding; \n(iv)  the  proposed  procurement  process;  (v)  disbursement  plan  and  time  frame;  (vi)  an \nenvironmental assessment and mitigation plan; (vii) a description of beneficiary consultation \nand  results;  (viii)  performance  monitoring  indicators  and  targets;  and  (ix)  a  date  for  the \nthe  recovery  activity \nsubmission  of  compliance/completion  certificate.  A \napplication is in Appendix 3. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nformat \n\nfor \n\n52. \nThe total estimated cost of the recovery program is NZ$10.5 million or US$7.9 million \nequivalent, including US$1.8 million equivalent in local currency costs and US$6.1 in foreign \nexchange  costs.  The  cost  estimates  are  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  interagency  damage \nassessment  appraised  by  the  ADB  Damage  Assessment  Mission.  They  incorporate \nappropriate  provisions  for  loan  administration  and  management  to  ensure  application  of \ngood  governance  for  project  administration,  including  safeguarding  the  quality,  timeliness, \nand economic efficiency for implementation of the recovery activities; financial controls, and \ninterest  during \nadherence \nimplementation  of  the  Project;  and  contingencies.

MFEM, as the Executing Agency, will be responsible for coordinating overall project \nimplementation. To ensure efficient implementation, MFEM may coordinate with one or more \nof  the  implementing  agencies  for  each  project  component.  The  implementing  agencies  will \nbe  (i)  the  Ministry  of  Works  for  components  1,  4,  5,  and  7;  (ii)  the  Ports  Authority  for \ncomponent 2; (iii) CIIC for component 6, as well as component 3 for activities in Aitutaki; (iv); \nTe  Aponga  Uira  O  Tumu-Te-Varovaro  (Te  Aponga  Uira-Power  Authority)  for  component  3 \nactivities  in  Rarotonga;  and  (v)  Office  of  the  Minister  for  Island  Administration  for \ncomponents 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. To ensure interagency coordination and integration of project \nimplementation, MFEM will be assisted by a PSC and PMU.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSteering Committee \n\n56. \nThe Government will form a PSC to be chaired by the financial secretary of  MFEM \nand  comprising  the  chief  executive  officer  of  CIIC,  president  of  Pukapuka  Rarotonga \nCommunity,  and  the  chief  executive  officers  of  the  project  implementing  agencies,  as \nneeded.  Representatives  of  the  New  Zealand High  Commission will  participate in the  PSC \nmeetings, as warranted. The PSC secretary will be the project manager. The PSC will meet \nas  frequently  as  required,  but  no  less  than  quarterly.  It  will  (i)  determine  the  use  of  funds \nunder  the  Project  within  the  categories  developed  by  the  comprehensive  recovery \nassessment and using the selection criteria; (ii) review quarterly reports, providing a view on \nproject  performance  in  a  separate  statement;  (iii)  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  reports  on \nproject  progress;  (iv)  resolve  emerging  issues  in  project  implementation,  procurement,  and \ncommunity  employment,  among  others;  and  (v)  supported  by  the  PMU,  prepare  and \ndisseminate information to the public on project activities, with a particular focus on timing of \nrestoration  activities,  benefits  including  social  and  economic  impact  of  the  restoration,  and \napplication of cyclone-resistant designs, where appropriate. The PSC will be maintained until \n30 April 2007. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Management \n\n57. \nThe  PMU  will  be  established  by  loan  effectiveness,  be  headed  by  a  competent \nproject  manager,  and  include  an  accountant  with  a  professional  accountancy  designation. \nThe  project  manager  will  administer  all  aspects  of  the  Project,  including  its  contracts,  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines, and will be accountable to MFEM and ADB for the quality \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nand timeliness of recovery activity implementation and contract management. The qualified \naccountant will review proposed expenditures for procurement of goods and services under \nthe Project in accordance with established eligibility criteria. The PMU will be funded under \nthe Project. Terms of reference for the PMU are in Appendix 5. \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n58. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  24  months,  commencing  in  May  2005.  Every \nquarter, the PMU will prepare a detailed implementation schedule for recovery activities. The \nPMU  project  manager  and  certified  accountant  will  be  selected  no  later  than  when  the \nProject is approved and effective. Retroactive financing of eligible expenditures will be made \nimmediately  after  project  approval.  The  recovery  activities  under  the  Project  will  be \ncompleted  by  April  2007.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  conduct  a  comprehensive \nmidterm review 1 year after loan approval. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe  Project  will  require  approximately  48  person-months  of  consulting  input.  In \n59. \naddition  to  the  project  manager  and  an  accountant  with  a  professional  accountancy \ndesignation,  a  consultant  with  technical  expertise  in  specific  assessment,  detailed  design, \ncontract supervision, and quality control will be engaged for up to 10 person-months. These \nconsultants  will  comprise  the  PMU,  which  will  be  located  at  MFEM.  All  consultants  will  be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Given  the \ntight  implementation  schedule  of  the  Project,  ADB  has  agreed  with  the  Government  that \ndirect engagement of consultants be undertaken, as provided for under these guidelines.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProcurement \n\n60. \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  carried  out  consistent  with  ADB \nGuidelines  for  Procurement,  with  the  flexible  interpretation  permitted  for  emergency \nassistance loans provided in accordance with the ADB Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy  (2004).  The  loan  proceeds  will  finance  imports  of  goods  and  services,  local \npurchases, and civil works identified under the comprehensive recovery assessment. Under \nADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  these  may  be  procured  through  direct  purchase, \ninternational  shopping,  or  local  competitive  bidding,  as  appropriate.  Use  of  advance \nprocurement, retroactive financing, and local cost financing are recommended as are use of \ncompetitive  processes  with  the  objective  of  economic  efficiency.  Both  local  and  prudent \ninternational  shopping  is  recommended  with  the  bid  period  reduced  from  30 to  7\u201315  days. \nLocal  competitive  bidding  may  be  applied  to  civil  works  contracts;  international  shopping \nmay  be  applied  for  civil  works  contracts  with  an  estimated  cost  below  US$1,000,000;  and \ndirect purchase will be limited to contract amounts of less than US$100,000. In the case of \nlocal contractors, a registration system that lists approved contractors based on criteria such \nas  experience,  and  financial  and  technical  capacity  may  be  used.  Unit  cost  tenders  are \nrecommended  for  use  of  local  contractors,  reflecting  procurement  procedures  for  normal \nprivate sector commercial practices. ADB procedures for providing reconstruction assistance \nafter disasters allow maximum flexibility, so that project activity can commence promptly.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAdvance Procurement Action \n\n61. \nGiven  the  urgency  of  the  recovery  activities,  ADB  approved  advance  action  for  the \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services,  and  recruitment  of  consultants  by  direct  selection, \nprovided  this  takes  place  on  or  after  4  February  2005,  the  stated  date  of  the  first  cyclone. \nThe Government has advised that approval of such advance action does not commit ADB to \nfinance any part of the recovery program. \n\n\f 14 \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement \n\n62. \nThe Project is designed to provide quick disbursing resources to finance the recovery \nprogram.  Disbursements  are  allowed  for  up  to  100%  of  the  eligible  project  costs.  Eligible \nexpenditures will be made through an imprest account, and its replenishment, in accordance \nwith ADB Disbursement Guidelines set out in the Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001). The \nproject manager, supported by the certified accountant, will be responsible for transactions, \nreplenishments, and use of the imprest account. \n \n \nThe  imprest  account  procedure  will  be  used  for  disbursing  funds  under  all  cost \n63. \ncategories  eligible  for  financing.  The  account  will  be  established  at  a  commercial  bank \nsituated on Rarotonga. ADB statement of expenditure procedure will be used for reimbursing \nexpenditures and liquidating the imprest account for payments with value equal to or below \nUS$50,000  each.  The  currency  of  the  imprest  account  will  be  the  US  dollar,  and  the \nmaximum  initial  advance  will  be  US$500,000.  The  project  manager,  supported  by  the \nconsultant accountant, will be responsible for administrative and accounting tasks under the \nProject; and will establish adequate internal control, accounting, and auditing procedures to \nensure efficient use of the imprest account and its operation.  \n \n\n8. \n\nRetroactive Financing \n\n64. \nFor  immediate  emergency  response,  up  to  30%  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be \nconsidered  for  retroactive  financing  for  eligible  categories  of  expenditures  under  the \ncomprehensive  recovery  assessment.  The  covered  expenditures  must  have  been  incurred \nor  paid  on  or  after  4  February  2005  in  order  to  finance  urgent  expenditures  necessary  to \nrestore essential public services.14 \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n65. \nEach  implementing  agency  will  carry  out  project  performance  monitoring  and \nevaluation  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Project  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nHandbook. Baseline indicators and targets for each recovery activity will be developed prior \nto  implementation  for  monitoring  purposes  as  well  as  for  checking  against  the  selection \ncriteria.  These  will  be  developed  in  the  recovery  activity  application  and  will  feed  into  the \nquarterly project report. \n \n\n10.  Midterm Review \n\n66. \nIn  addition  to  a  schedule  of  regular  reviews  to  monitor  project  progress,  a \ncomprehensive project review will be carried out 1 year after commencement. The focus of \nthe review is to determine the need for any deviations from the design or implementation of \nthe  Project.  The  review  will  also  assess  adequacy  of  funds,  cost  overruns,  need  for \nreallocations,  and  other  factors  including  assumptions  and  risks  that  might  constrain \nsatisfactory project implementation and achievement of development objectives. \n\n                                                 \n14  The first cyclone occurred on 4 February 2005. The Government focused its resources on relief and recovery \naction  and  addressed  the  damage  from  the  next  four  cyclones  by  organizing  equipment  for  the  cleanup \noperation and restoration of public utilities (water, power). These activities are considered of utmost importance \nas  the  Cook  Islands  economy  is  reliant  on  tourism;  longer-term  interruptions  would  have  caused  impacts  on \nthe  revenues,  fiscal  revenues,  investment,  and  employment,  throughout  the  economy.  Financing  of \nexpenditures incurred are necessary because of the exceptional circumstances in this case, which prevented \nan ADB mission from occurring immediately after the first cyclone. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\n11. \n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports \n\na. \n\nAccounts and Audits \n\ninternational  auditors  acceptable \n\n67. \nThe  PMU  will  establish  and  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  all  project \nexpenditures, including individual contracts and other recovery activities. These accounts will \nbe adequate to identify the goods and services financed by the loan proceeds, the financing \nsource,  expenditures  incurred,  and use  of  local  funds;  and will  provide detailed  records  on \nthe  costing  and  expenditures  of  the  recovery  activities.  The  accounts  will  be  set  up  in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  The  financial  statements  for  these  accounts \nwill  be  audited  annually  using  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  by  externally \nrecruited \nto  ADB.  The  Government  will  engage \ninternational consulting services for the audit in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants.  The  audited  financial  statements  together  with  the  auditor\u2019s  report  will  be \nforwarded to ADB within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal year.  \n \n68. \nAll project activities will be subject to independent performance audits to ensure their \ntransparency and to provide an objective and independent assessment. In addition, ADB will \nconduct  project  procurement  audits  during  implementation  as  part  of  its  regular  reviews. \nADB  also  reserves  the  right  to  conduct  a  \u201cspecial  audit\u201d  focusing  on  governance,  financial \naccountability  (e.g.,  certification  of  accounts),  and \ntransparency  soon  after  project \ncompletion. The audit costs will be funded under the Project.  \n \n\nb. \n\nReports \n\n69.  With  the  PMU  monitoring  overall  implementation  progress,  each  implementing \nagency  will  prepare  a  brief  recovery  activity  application  for  funding  under  the  Project.  The \nPMU will prepare a comprehensive quarterly report on project activities. Within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the recovery activities, the Government will provide ADB, through the \nPMU, with an overall project completion report providing a detailed evaluation of the project \ndesign,  costs,  contractor  and  consultant  performance,  social  and  economic  impact,  and \nother details requested by ADB. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n70. \nThe Government recognizes the need to improve its capacity to manage emergency \nresponse  and  develop  an  effective  planning  framework  for  mitigating  its  vulnerability  to \nclimate change. It also concludes that social infrastructure is ill-prepared for weather-related \nproblems, as highlighted under the Climate Change Adaptation Project for the Pacific.15 The \nGovernment  has  accepted  the  assertions  made  under  this  TA  that  the  country\u2019s  inherent \ngeographic  vulnerability  to  climate  change  can  be  ameliorated  by  initiating  integrated \ninfrastructure  and  social  development, \nresource  development. \nConsequently,  the  Government  intends  to  implement  the  recommendations  for  climate \nproofing the country, or to enhance the country\u2019s adaptive capacity and resilience to climate \nchange  and  climate  variability,  including  changes  in  extreme  events.  Overall,  the \nGovernment aims to strengthen disaster management and mitigation capacity to ensure that \nfuture social and infrastructure program designs incorporate climate change adaptation and \nmitigation  strategies,  and  are  thus  capable  of  delivering  the  envisaged  benefits  to  the \ncommunity.  \n \nADB will provide a TA grant of $600,000 for Strengthening Disaster Management and \n71. \nMitigation. The total cost of the TA will be US$755,350 equivalent, with $467,640 in foreign \n\nincluding  human \n\n                                                 \n15 ADB.2005. Technical Assistance for the Climate Change Adaptation Program for the Pacific. Manila.  \n\n\f 16 \n\nexchange  and  $287,710  equivalent  in  local  currency  (Appendix  7).  ADB  will  finance  the \nentire foreign exchange cost ($467,640) and $132,360 equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by the ADB TA funding program. The Government \nwill  contribute  $155,350  equivalent  by  providing  office  space  and  logistical  support,  office \nsupport  and  counterpart  staff,  workshop  and  training,  report  preparation,  and  local \ntransportation  to  remote  locations.  The  TA  will  support  (i)  strengthening  disaster  and \nemergency  management,  and  (ii)  preparation  of  20-year  integrated  and  environmentally \nsustainable  infrastructure  planning  that  incorporates  climate  change  adaptation  in  the \nrecommendations  for  the  design  of  social  and  infrastructure  development  planning  and \nprogramming.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  establish  a  rapid,  effective,  and  robust \nresponse  capability  through  efficiently  coordinated  networks  of  skilled  personnel  to \nadminister the current and future recovery response operations. Under the long-term master \nplan,  the  TA  will  help  the  Government  adopt  a  systematic  approach  to  mitigating  the \ncountry\u2019s  vulnerability  to  adverse  weather  conditions  through  design  of  institutions  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  infrastructure  with  capacity  to  impede  the  reoccurrence  of  a \ndisaster  with  harmful  effects  on  communities  and  key  infrastructure.  The  master  plan  is \nexpected  to  be updated  at  least  every  5  years  in  line  with good  practice.  ADB will  engage \nconsulting services for the TA in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Qualified individual consulting services will be selected for component 1 of the \nTA, and the quality and cost-based selection method will be used for selecting international \nconsultant services for component 2 based on simplified technical proposals.  \n \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n72. \nThe  burden-shared  recovery  program  will  mitigate  the  otherwise  extended  negative \nimpacts  of  the  2005  cyclone  damage,  particularly  on  the  poor,  and  enable  the  country  to \nrecover  from  the  emergency  with  only  a  temporary  setback.  The  immediate  benefit  of  the \nrecovery program is the reinstatement of basic services, including water and power supply, \ntransport  sector  functionality\u2014safe  road  and maritime  access,  education  and  health  sector \nservices  countrywide\u2013\u2013all  crucial  services  underpinning  the  minimum  socioeconomic \nstandards  in  the  outer  islands  and  economic  welfare  of  Rarotonga  communities.  In \nRarotonga,  restoration  of  roads,  bridges,  and  water  supplies  is  essential  to  the  economic \nwell-being of the country, particularly ensuring immediate restoration of the tourism sector\u2013\u2013\nthe main source of employment and income. In the outer islands, infrastructure is essential \nfor delivering services to poor and disadvantaged groups. Selected recovery activities will be \ntechnically  feasible,  cost-effective,  and  represent  a  least-cost  alternative  with  appropriate \nadjustment for cyclone-resistant design.  \n \n73.  While  an  economic  impact  assessment  has  not  been  conducted  at  this  stage,  the \nimmediate economic impacts are expected to be temporary and relate to the (i) opportunity \ncosts  carried  by  both  public  and  private  outlays  to  finance  recovery  that  redirects  funding \nfrom productive assets to the rebuilding activity; (ii) lost revenues in the interim when private \nand public services are not functional with related employment and socioeconomic impacts; \nand (iii) temporary loss of agricultural production, with impact on inflation, productivity, and \neconomic  growth.  These  are  offset  to  some  extent  by  the  labor  intensity  of  the  recovery \nphase and an estimated additional 60,000 labor-days, or 6% addition to overall employment, \nparticularly  in  the  construction  industries.  While  the  country\u2019s  inflation  has  been  low,  the \nlosses  in  agricultural  production  with  the  corresponding  increase  in  food  imports  are \nexpected  to  contribute  to  inflationary  pressure.  With  supply-side  shortages  characterizing \nlabor  and  materials  markets,  the  additional  demand,  particularly  on  labor  and  construction \nmaterials, can be expected to result in wage and profit increases leading to further inflation. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nRegretfully, the inflationary trend impacts most harshly on the poor. Finally, migration away \nfrom the outer islands and to international destinations, both long and short term, is expected \nto increase. \n \n74. \nThe Project supports prudent financial management of Government fiscal resources, \nenabling  maintenance  of  fiscal  viability  and  debt  servicing  by  maximizing  concessional \nfunding for recovery expenditures. With the Project\u2019s support, the Government will be able to  \nmaintain  macroeconomic  performance  in  accordance  with  the  1998  Manila  Agreement \nfinancial ratios.16 This, in turn, will enable the Government to continue with its objectives of \nattaining  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  and  improving  standards of  living  in the  Cook \nIslands. The Project is expected to contribute to a favorable resolution of the credit check by \ncredit-rating agencies and continue attracting repatriated, international, and domestic private \nsector investment, particularly to the tourism sector, and thus fuel growth and employment. \n \n75. \nTourism.  Tourism  generates  54%  of  the  GDP  and  is  the  main  export  earner  with \nmajor  markets  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  While  extreme  weather  events  may  not \nsignificantly affect total tourist arrivals, the economy is highly vulnerable to strong cyclones \nthat  can  inflict  damage  on  tourism  infrastructure,  such  as  hotels,  mostly  located  along \ncoastal  areas.  Cyclone-motivated  reservation  cancellations  and  deferment  was  temporary \nand  estimated  at  20%  of  the  expected  hotel  occupancy,  with  March  2005  reservations \nindicating  recovery.  Local  commercial  banks  are  extending  tourism  businesses  cyclone-\nrelated, debt-rescheduling packages that include working capital, rescheduling of loan terms, \ninterest capitalization, and grace periods for amortization and interest payments. Restoration \ninvestment  and  the  associated  revenue  losses  are  estimated  to  reach  NZ$10  million  and \nNZ$5  million,  respectively,  with  about  70%  of  these  funded  through  external  cyclone \ninsurance.17 In addition, Rarotonga was not able to receive four planned cruise ship calls at \nAvatiu port, and experienced an associated reduction in total revenues for cruise ship calls \nby a  minimum  of  NZ$240,000.18  While  tourism  is characterized  as resilient,  the  future  cost \nand availability of cyclone and sea surge insurance and the diminished capacity of the Cook \nIslands  to  attract  long-haul  tourist  markets  in  Europe  and  North  America  are  areas  of \nconcern.  \n \n76. \nAgriculture. About 70% of all households are engaged in agricultural activity, either \nsubsistence and/or commercial. The tourism sector is an important market outlet for locally \ngrown produce. With agriculture currently contributing about 7.1% of the country's GDP, the \nMinistry  of  Agriculture  is  researching  new  varieties  of  fruit  and  vegetables,  and  is  initiating \nprojects  to  revive  the  citrus,  banana,  and  pineapple-growing  industries.  Loss  of  planted \nagriculture production ranges  from  100% in  Pukapuka and  Nassau,  to  50%  in  Aitutaki  and \nRarotonga. In Pukapuka, the island population was left totally dependent on imported food \nand water. In Rarotonga, significant increases in food imports have become necessary due \nto  a  partial  loss  of  hydroponic  vegetable  production  that  primarily  caters  to  the  hotels. \nAgriculture  GDP  is  expected  to  be  affected  with  a  temporary  loss  (6\u20134  months)  affecting \n78% of arable land with an income loss estimated at 26%, or about NZ$4.4 million.  \n \n77. \nFisheries.  Pearl  farming,  fishing,  and  agriculture  generate  the  remainder  of  GDP. \nFisheries,  particularly  offshore  fishing  industries,  grew  fast  from  nearly  nothing  since \n2002/03.  However,  after  some  early  success,  setbacks  have  related  to  inconsistency  in \nquantity  of  catch  required  for  commercial  viability.  The  Cook  Islands  also  receives  about \nNZ$1  million  a  year  from  tuna  fishing  access  fees.  The  impact  of  cyclones  on  marine \nfisheries was mostly due to loss of fishing days.  \n                                                 \n16  See the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n17  Cyclone, including sea surge coverage, insurance is generally required by commercial creditors.  \n18  Each  600-passenger  cruise  ship  brings  a  total  revenue,  including  port  duties,  restaurant,  and  other  retail \nservices  ranging  from  NZ$60,000  to  NZ$100,000,  totaling  an  estimated  revenue  loss  of  NZ$240,000  for  the \nfour calls.  \n\n\f 18 \n\nB. \n\nPoverty and Other Impacts \n\n78. \nPoverty  Impact.  Natural  disasters  affect  the  poor  disproportionately  in  terms  of \nhealth,  housing,  employment,  livelihood,  and  food  security.  In  this  case,  residents  of  the \nremote outer islands have damaged housing and food crops. Damage to port facilities has  \nrestricted the delivery of essential supplies, particularly food and fuel. While the Project will \nnot  directly  address  private  housing  or  agriculture,  it  will  assist  the  poor  by  restoring  port \nservices, rural infrastructure, and community infrastructure facilities. \n \nSocial Impacts. In 2001,19 the country had a population of 15,017; 5,560 lived on the \n79. \nouter  islands.  The  cyclones  affected  Atiu  with  a  resident  population  of  600,  Aitutaki  1,743, \nMangaia  739,  Mauke  469,  Mitiaro  226,  Nassau  72,  Palmerston  48,  Pukapuka  662,  and \nRarotonga 9,451. The most serious social impacts are being experienced by Pukapuka and \nNassau,  where  most  of  the  population  lost  functionality  of  their  homes  and  agricultural \nproduction,  particularly  the  food  staple\u2014taro,  which  was  partly  destroyed,  leaving  the \ncommunity dependent on food imports, thus exacerbating hardship and poverty. In the other \nislands,  partial  damage  to  homes  was  common.  Countrywide,  but  particularly  in  the  outer \nislands,  recovery  of  homes  will  absorb  the  limited  savings  and  exacerbate  economic \ndifficulties  and  hardship.  In  Rarotonga,  commercial  banks  are  funding  residential  recovery \nwith  softer  than  usual  terms,  thus  reallocating  financing  from  home  purchase  and \nimprovement to refurbishment.  \n \nEmployment  Generation.  The  recovery  activities  funded  under  the  Project  are \n80. \nestimated \nthe \nreconstruction and repair of infrastructure. The poverty reduction aspects will be enhanced \nby contractors using local workers in unskilled and semiskilled tasks. \n \nC. \n\nto  generate  about  60,000  person-days  of  employment,  mostly \n\nResettlement \n\nin \n\n81. \nThe Project will not involve land acquisition or resettlement of any kind  as recovery \nactivities are concerned only with restoration of existing facilities. The Project is focused on \nreinstatement of services and facilities to their precyclone condition using cyclone-resistant \ndesigns, where technically feasible, particularly for the benefit of indigenous Cook Islanders, \nespecially  in  the  outer  islands.  The  Project  involves  no  negative  impacts  on  indigenous \npeoples. \n \nD. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n82. \nThe Project is classified as category B in accordance with ADB Environment Policy \n(2002). The initial environmental examination (IEE), including the environment management \nplan,  was  conducted  to  determine  the  degree  of  likely  impacts  and  describe  possible \nmitigation  measures.  The  Project  involves  only  rehabilitation  of  previously  existing \ninfrastructure previously or currently used for the same purpose. The IEE concluded that the \nProject is unlikely to generate any significant environmental impact either during construction \nor  during  operation.  All  recovery  activities  will  be  required  to  complete  and  satisfy  an \nenvironmental assessment screening checklist during formulation. Recommended mitigation \nmeasures  will  be  incorporated  in  the  design  of  subprojects  and  contractors\u2019  work \nassignments. Positive impacts will arise from the restoration of water supplies and sanitation \nfacilities,  clearing  of  debris  in  general,  and  adoption  of  cyclone-resistant  designs,  where \npossible. The summary IEE is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n                                                 \n19 Government of the Cook Islands. 2001. Census of Population and Dwelling. Statistics Office. Ratotonga.

The  Government  will \nensure  that  all  recovery  activities  carried  out  under  the  Project  meet,  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  ADB,  the  agreed  general  and  specific  eligibility  criteria  and \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  that  all  such  recovery  activities  are  properly \ncontrolled and monitored to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n\nThe  Government  will  evaluate  each  activity  proposed  for  financing  under  the \nProject  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  eligibility  criteria  and  will  submit  all  such \nproposals to ADB for approval. Each financing proposal will include (a) a detailed \ndescription of the proposed design; (b) an account of the Government\u2019s use of its \nbudget reserves and its efforts to obtain external grant financing for such activity, \nif applicable; (c) a description of the proposed procurement methodology; (d) the \nfinancial disbursement plan, including the proposed timing of disbursements; (e) \nan  environmental  assessment  and  mitigation  plan  prepared  in  accordance  with \nGovernment and ADB environmental requirements; (f) a description of the extent \nand nature of beneficiary consultations and the results of such consultations; (g) \nperformance  monitoring \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  recovery  activity  application  or  quarterly  reports  of  the  PMU,  as \napplicable;  and  (h)  intended  date  for  the  submission  of  a  compliance  and \ncompletion certificate for such activity. \n\nindicators  and \n\ntargets  as \n\nintegrated \n\ninto \n\nOperation  and  maintenance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  facilities \nrestored  under  the  Project  are  operated  and  maintained  by  the  responsible \nimplementing agency in accordance with sound policies and practices. In order to \nfacilitate  proper  maintenance  of  project  facilities,  the  Government  will  devise  a \ndetailed and comprehensive maintenance plan for such project facilities and the \nplan will be incorporated into the final project completion report. \n\nCounterpart  funds.  The  Government  will  allocate,  on  a  timely  basis,  adequate \ncounterpart funds from its budget in accordance with its comprehensive recovery \nassessment and program. \n\nEnvironment and resettlement. The Government will ensure that the Project is \ncarried  out  and  all  project  facilities  are  operated  and  maintained  in  accordance \nwith  (a)  the  Environment  Act  2003  and  all  other  existing  laws,  regulations,  and \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n\f 20 \n\n \n(vi) \n\nstandards  of  the  Government  concerning  environmental  protection;  (b)  ADB \nEnvironment Policy (2002); and (c) all environmental mitigation measures set out \nin  the  IEE,  including  the  environment  management  plan,  for  each  project \ncomponent.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  that  the  mitigation  measures \nidentified  by  the  IEEs  are  incorporated  into  the  design,  rehabilitation,  and \noperation of the project facilities, as applicable. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  no  land acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement \nwill  be  required  for  the  Project.  In  the  event  that  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement  is  required,  the  Government  will  prepare  a  resettlement  plan  in \naccordance with applicable Government laws and regulations and ADB Policy on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement (1995).20 Any such resettlement plan will be submitted \nto ADB for review and approval before any resettlement activities are initiated. \n\n(vii)  Good  governance.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough  its  agents,  any  possible  financial  management  or  perceived  impropriety \nin  implementing  the  Project.  The  Government,  together  with  MFEM  and  the \nrelevant \nto  cooperate  with  any  such \ninvestigation and extend all necessary assistance, including access to all relevant \nbooks and records as well as the engagement of independent experts, who may \nbe  needed  to  complete  any  such  investigations  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  All \nexternal  costs  related  to  any  such  investigation  by  ADB  will  be  borne  by  the \nProject. \n\nimplementing  agencies,  will  agree \n\n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that the PMU establishes a website for the Project to \nprovide  information  on  how  project  funds  are  being  used  for  the  intended \nbeneficiaries. The project website will include information on project activities, an \nupdate  on  the  timing  of  project  activities,  and  an  analysis  of  the  social  and \neconomic  impacts  of  the  Project.  The  project  website  will  also  present  financial \nstatements;  track  procurement  contract  awards;  and  include  information  on, \namong others, the list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic \ndetails on bidding procedures adopted, amount of the contract awarded, and list \nof goods and/or services purchased and their intended and actual utilization. The \nGovernment will also ensure that MFEM and the implementing agencies actively \ndisseminate  information,  through  the  use  of  local  media  and  other  appropriate \nmeans,  on  the  use  of  project  funds  to  beneficiaries  who  do  not  have  access  to \nthe project website. \n\n(ix)  Midterm  review.  The  Government  and  ADB  will,  1  year  after  the  effective  date \nfor  the  Project,  jointly  carry  out  a comprehensive  midterm  review  of  the  Project. \nThe  midterm  review  will  assess  the  Project\u2019s  achievements  and  progress  in \nimplementing  the  project  objectives  to  identify  any  difficulties  or  constraints \nencountered in project implementation and to make adjustments, if necessary, for \nthe remaining project implementation period. Specifically, the midterm review will \nassess  the  adequacy  of  funds,  any  cost  overruns,  and  any  reallocation \nrequirements.  \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n20  ADB.  1998.

Cyclone  Meena,  with  a  maximum  severity  rating  of  category  5,  began  in \nAmerican Samoa, with the eye of the cyclone moving in an easterly direction. Gaining strength, \nMeena entered the Cook Islands\u2019 territory on 4 February 2005 and passed 145 kilometers (km) \nnortheast  of  Palmerston,  161  km  west  of  Aitutaki,  and  90  km  northeast  of  Rarotonga  on  6 \nFebruary. Meena then moved south toward Mangaia. The winds reached 100 km per hour (kph) \non  Rarotonga.  Wave  surges  caused  substantial  damage  to  the  commercial  district  of  Avarua, \ncapital  of  the  Cook  Islands.  The  waves  demolished  buildings  along  the  waterfront,  left  rubble \nstrewn  on  the  main  road,  and  damaged  the  road  to  the  airport,  causing  road  closures.  In \nAitutaki,  the  cyclone  caused  damage  to  power  supply,  the  port,  and  buildings,  particularly \nAraura College. In Mauke, the cyclone caused serious damage to the port, whereas in Mangaia, \nhigh winds and rough seas affected the airport, water supply, roads, buildings, and the wharf. \nThe National Emergency Operations Centre reported no casualties throughout the archipelago.  \n\n2. \nNancy. A second cyclone, Nancy, followed Meena on 13 February and passed 112 km \nsouthwest of Suwarrow, with the center advancing at 148 kph and causing gale-force winds with \nsqually thunderstorms on Palmerston. Aitutaki experienced high seas and strong winds of 95\u2013\n145 kph, with heavy rain. Nancy passed Rarotonga at 50 km on 15 February, with destructive \nwind  gusts  felling  many  trees  and  power  lines,  leaving  more  than  800  customers  without \nelectricity, rendering the main roads impassable owing to debris, and destroying the roofs of a \nnumber  of  buildings  (schools,  churches,  restaurants).  The  cyclone  curled  around  to  the \nsouthwest of Rarotonga, with gusts of up to 140 kph recorded. In Atiu, Nancy reached winds of \nup  to  241  kph  and  brought  down  power  lines,  poles,  and  trees;  ripped  off  roofs;  and  spread \ndebris on the roads. The strong winds and rain left the majority of houses with water damage. \nThe  country's  southernmost  island,  Mangaia,  experienced  strong  gusts  of  up  to  259  kph, \ninflicting damage on all infrastructure.   \n\nOlaf.  A  third  cyclone,  Olaf,  merged  with  Nancy,  and  reached  the  west  coast  of \n3. \nRarotonga  on  17  February,  with  winds  of  259  kph  and  gusts  of  315  kph.  Olaf  lifted  roofs  of \nresidences  and  business  establishments,  brought  down  trees,  and  left  households  without \npower or phone connections. Olaf caused storm surges, damaging structures along the coast. \nWhen Olaf\u2019s eye passed 200 km west of Rarotonga, its winds reached 285 kph and it was given \na  severity  rating  of  category  4.  Reports  from  outer  islands,  including  Aitutaki  and  Palmerston, \nrecorded sea surges and wind damage, but no injuries. \n\n 4. \nPercy. A fourth cyclone, Percy, with a maximum severity rating of category 5, severely \naffected  the  low-lying,  fragile,  and  remote  atolls  of  Pukapuka  (population  640)  and  Nassau \n(population  72)  located  1,140  km  north  of  Rarotonga  on  27  February  2005.  The  eye  of  the \ncyclone  passed  40  km  south  of  Pukapuka,  with  the  wind  gusts  estimated  at  230  kph.  Percy \ncaused  damage  to  most  buildings  in  Pukapuka,  including  the  hospital,  school,  and  churches, \nand  rendered  the  roads  inaccessible  owing  to  strewn  debris  and  fallen  trees.  No  fatalities  or \ninjuries were reported. Nassau, located 57 km southwest of Pukapuka, was also severely hit by \nPercy,  which  damaged  all  houses  and  left  only the  church, with  a  torn  roof,  standing.  Women \nand young children were evacuated from the island until recovery action was completed. Percy \npassed 200 km southwest of Palmerston, with winds of at least 37 kph and gusts up to 56 kph, \nwith no serious damage reported. \n\n5. \nRae. A fifth cyclone, Rae, was minimal and passed 320 km southwest of Rarotonga. It \nstayed  at  tropical  storm  strength  without  escalating  to  hurricane  level.  However,  warnings  for \nlocalized  flash  floods  were  raised  by  Fiji  Regional  Meteological  Service  Centre  on  Rarotonga \nand Mangaia islands. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nFORMAT FOR RECOVERY ACTIVITY APPLICATION \n\n{Title of the Recovery Activity} \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDate: {dd mm yyyy} \n1.

The  economy  was  severely  disrupted.  The \nGovernment  and  its  agencies  have  managed  early  warning  information  dissemination  and \nevacuation,  and  provided  emergency  relief  to  the  affected  population  with  the  support  of \ninternational  and  regional  relief  agencies.  Preliminary  assessments  of  the  physical  damage \nhave been carried out. However, the Government lacks capacity and resources to finance the \nimmediate recovery and reinstatement of basic services.   \n \n2. \nThe  emergency  highlights  the  need  for  a  long-term  strategy  and  an  integrated \ninfrastructure  development  plan  that  (i)  incorporates  climate  change  adaptation  concepts;  and \n(ii)  prioritizes  the  development  and  implementation  of  policies  and  measures  to  support \neconomic  and  social  development,  and  ensure  maintenance  of  basic  infrastructure  against \nweather-related threats.  \n \nThe  social  infrastructure  is  ill-prepared  for  weather-related  threats;  this  was  highlighted \n3. \nby the Climate Change Adaptation Project for the Pacific.1 The inherent geographic vulnerability \nof the Cook Islands to climate change can be ameliorated by integrated infrastructure and social \ndevelopment,  including  human  resource  development.  The  country  needs  to  be  \u201cclimate \nproofed\u201d  by  enhancing  its  adaptive  capacity  and  resilience  to  climate  change  and  climate \nvariability,  including  extreme  events.  Strengthening  disaster  management  and  mitigation \ncapacity will help to (i) ensure that future social and infrastructure program designs incorporate \nclimate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation  strategies,  thus  allowing  delivery  of  the  envisaged \nbenefits to the community; and (ii) disaster management capacity includes the ability to mobilize \na robust and rapid response to minimize impact on the fragile economy.   \n \nB. \n \nThe  objectives  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  are  to  (i)  assist  the  Government  in \n4. \nstrengthening  disaster  and  recovery  management, \nincluding  damage  assessment,  aid \nmanagement,  and  operational  coordination;  and  (ii)  establish  financial  controls  required  to \nensure  good  governance  in  managing  rapid  disbursement  of  recovery  funds.  The  TA  will \ndevelop  a  far-reaching  and  systematic  approach  to  mitigating  the  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to \nadverse  weather  conditions  under  three  phases\u2014emergency  response,  recovery,  and  the \ndevelopment  or  establishment  of  institutions  and  environmentally  sustainable  infrastructure \ncapable  of  preventing  the  recurrence  of  disasters.  The  TA  will  establish  (i)  robust  disaster \nmanagement operations and control mechanisms to support not only the efficient and effective \nimplementation of the Cyclone Emergency Assistance Project, but future disasters as well; and \n(ii)  a  preventive  master  plan  that  will  develop  long-term  preparedness  by  minimizing  the \npotential harmful impacts of future emergencies. \n\nObjectives \n\n                                                           \n1  ADB. 2002.

These are presented according to the different project \nphases,  i.e.,  from  site  assessment  and  design  to  construction,  to  operation  and  maintenance. \nMitigation measures are prescribed, together with the proposed environmental monitoring plan, \ninstitutional requirements, and public consultation and information disclosure requirements. The \nIEE  procedure  follows  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).  \n\nB. \n\n \nDescription of Project \n \n2. \nThe  Cyclone  Emergency  Assistance  Project  intends  to  fast  track  the  recovery  and \nrehabilitation  of  damaged  public  services  and  in  the  process  lessen  the  adverse  social  and \neconomic impact of the cyclones. The Project will finance a major part of the cyclone recovery \nprogram  to  restore  the  functionality  of  public  utilities  (such  as  water  and  power),  education, \nhealth, and transport sector services. Specifically, the Project will (i) repair and clean up roads, \nbridges, and drainage, particularly in Rarotonga; Aitutaki; Mauke; and Mangaia; (ii) restore the \nfunctionality of harbors in Aitutaki, Mangaia, Mauke, Pukapuka, and  Rarotonga,; (iii) repair the \npower  distribution  lines  and  infrastructure  in  Aitutaki  and  Rarotonga;  (iv)  reinstate  the  water \nsupply facilities to their precyclone condition, particularly in Pukapuka and Nassau; (v) restore \nthe newly constructed waste management landfill in Rarotonga; and (vi) repair hospitals, health \ncenters, staff quarters, and administrative buildings of government agencies. \n \nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n \n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n \n \n3. \nThe  Cook  Islands  has  a  tropical  oceanic  climate  with  two  seasons.  The  drier  months, \nfrom April to November, have an average maximum temperature of about 26 degrees Celsius \n(oC)  and  an  average  minimum  temperature  of  about  20oC.  The  wetter,  more  humid  months, \nfrom  December  to  March,  have  an  average  maximum  temperature  of  28oC  and  an  average \nminimum  of  22oC.  During  the  wet  season,  the  Cook  Islands  can  experience  severe  tropical \ncyclones. Water supply in Rarotonga is obtained from the water catchments of the mountainous \ninterior  of  the  island.  The  main  sources  of  drinking  water  in the  other  volcanic  southern  group \nislands are freshwater lenses and through roof catchments. The main source of drinking water \nin the northern atolls is from rainwater tanks and cisterns because the groundwater resource is \nprone to contamination from human waste and salt intrusion. \n \n\nEcological Resources \n\n2. \n \nBiodiversity  of  the  country  includes  a  variety  of  plants  and  animal  species.  Rarotonga \n4. \nhas 180 indigenous flowering plants, the Makatea islands have 90 to 100 indigenes, Aitutaki has \n40, and the northern atolls vary from 25 in Pukapuka to 18 on Manihiki. The plants of the Cook \nIslands  are  widely  used  by  the  people.  The  Natural  Heritage  Project  has  documented  over \n1,007  flowering  plants, of  which  163  are  used  for  food,  73  for  medicines,  52  for  agriculture  or \nhorticulture, 20 provide timber, and 406 are ornamental (leaves or flowers). Birds include about \n20 indigenous resident seabirds and 13 indigenous resident land birds. Six Alaskan shorebirds \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n43\n\nregularly spend the southern winter in the country. Two of the uninhabited islands, Takutea in \nthe southern island group and Suwarrow in the northern group, play an important ecological role \nas bird sanctuaries, both supporting species not found elsewhere in the Cook Islands. Twenty-\nfour  coral  genera  and  58  species  have  been  identified  in  the  Cook  Islands  mainly  on  Aitutaki \nand Rarotonga. Coral reef resources and lagoons provide a very important food source for Cook \nislanders,  particularly  in  the  northern  island  group  and  also  on  some  islands  of  the  southern \ngroup. \n \n\nEconomic Development \n\n3. \n \n5. \nDespite the Cook Islands\u2019 economic vulnerability, it achieved its sixth consecutive year \nof  growth  in  2004.  Real  gross  domestic  product  grew  by  3.4%  over  fiscal  year  (FY)  2004;  its \nprimary  contributors  are  tourism  (54%),  including  the  related  retail,  wholesale,  and  other \nconsumption  and  financial  services;  agriculture  and  fisheries  (16%);  transportation  (15%);  and \npublic administration (12%). Tourism, the leading economic sector, has grown massively since \n1971. In 2000, a record of 75,000 people visited the country, bringing huge economic benefits \nand major developments in tourist infrastructure on both Rarotonga and the northern island of \nAitutaki. Fisheries also contribute substantially to the economy: every week, up to 20 tons of fish \nwere  exported  to  markets  in  Japan  and  the  United  States  (US).  Cook  Islands  boats  caught \nabout  846  tons  of  tuna  worth  about  US$3.1  million  (gross).  The  Cook  Islands  also  receives \nabout US$1 million a year from a fishing treaty that allows a certain number of US tuna fishing \nboats to operate in the country\u2019s exclusive economic zone each year. Black pearls are the Cook \nIslands\u2019  leading  export,  ranking  second  to  tourism  in  their  importance  to  the    economy.  The \nlargest  market  is  Japan  which  buys  about  50%  of  Cook  Islands\u2019  production.  The  remainder  is  \nAustralia,  Europe,  Hawaii,  and  domestic  markets.  About  70%  of  all  households  in  the  Cook \nIslands are engaged in some form of agricultural activity for subsistence, commercial, or both. \nSome agricultural produce is exported to New Zealand.  \n\n \n4. \n\nSocial and Cultural Resources \n\n \n6. \nThe  indigenous  population  of  the  Cook  Islands  is  the  Cook  Islands  Maori,  Polynesians \nclosely related ethnically to the indigenous populations of Tahiti and nearby islands and to the \nNew  Zealand  Maori.  The  population  of  the  Cook  Islands  in  2003  was  18,027.  Since  the \neconomic reform programs of 1995\u20131996, the population has experienced heavy losses due to \nmigration  to  Australia  and  New  Zealand.  Settlements  are  mainly  concentrated  on  the  coastal \nzone.  Broad  social  indicators  place  the  Cook  Islands  toward  the  top  in  the  Pacific  in  literacy \nrates  and  school  enrolment  ratios.  Life  expectancy,  infant  mortality  rates,  and  access  to  safe \nwater and sanitation compare well with Pacific neighbors. Access to and quality of social service \nprovision in Rarotonga differs significantly from that on the outer islands. Of the approximately \n28 primary schools in the Cook Islands, 10 are in Rarotonga, and out of the 23 schools offering \nsecondary level education, 3 are in Rarotonga. Postsecondary education facilities, however, are \nlimited and are based mainly in Rarotonga, such as the extension center of the University of the \nSouth Pacific in Avarua.  \n \nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n7. \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  help  the  Cook  Islands  recover  from  the \ndevastation  wrought  by  five  cyclones  that  hit  the  country  between  February  and  March  2005. \nTable A8 presents the potential adverse impact that rehabilitation and construction works may \npose  for  the  environment,  particularly  on  the  quality  of  the  air,  water,  soil,  wildlife,  and \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nvegetation, as well as the impact on the social and cultural makeup of the local people. Project \ncompletion is expected to bring social and economic benefits to local residents. \n \n8. \nBecause  the  project  activities  are  generally  repair  works,  environmental  impacts  are \npredicted to be limited. The identified potential environmental impacts on the air, water, lands, \nvegetation, wildlife, and the local people, are manageable and could be mitigated as outlined in \nTable  A8.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  staff  will  oversee  and  monitor  the  progress  of \nproject  construction  and  operational  activities.  The  PMU  will  have  full  support  from  the \nGovernment, particularly the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) and the \nNational Environment Service.  \n \nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n \n1. \n \n9. \nMFEM  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  with  the  Ministry  of  Works,  Cook \nIsland  Investment  Corporation  including  the  Ports  Authority  and  Te  Aponga  Uira  Power \nAuthority  (Rarotonga),  and  Office  of  the  Minister  for  Island  Administrations  as  implementing \nagencies. A PMU, guided by a steering committee, will be created to administer and coordinate \ndaily  project  activities.  The  PMU,  headed  by  a  project  manager,  will  oversee  overall  project \nimplementation,.  The  PMU  will  ensure  that  project  operations  are  within  the  environmental \nstandards  set  by  the  IEE  and  other  appropriate  policies,  rules,  and  regulations  set  by  the \nGovernment. Environmental monitoring and evaluation of project activities will be undertaken by \na multipartite monitoring team comprising representatives from the PMU, MFEM, and technical \nstaff  from  the  National  Environment  Service.  Representative(s)  from  affected  communities  will \nbe  selected  to  form  part  of  the  monitoring  team.  ADB  may  join  the  monitoring  team  as  a \ntechnical adviser. Other experts from outside organizations may be included as needed. \n\nInstitutional Requirements \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Monitoring Plan \n\n \n2. \n \n10. \nDuring  the  preconstruction  phase,  the  focus  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  the \ndesign  and  location  of  various  project  rehabilitation  and  repair  activities.  The  monitoring  team \nwill  ensure  that  the  designs  incorporate  all  the  mitigating  measures  identified,  to  limit,  if  not \ntotally  eliminate,  the  possible  negative  impact  of  project  construction  activities.  Mitigating \nmeasures  should  include  the  concerns  and  requirements  of  the  local  communities.  With  the \nmitigating  measures  already  defined  and  parameters  listed,  the  monitoring  team  will  then \nconduct  regular  inspection  activities.  Monitoring  may  be  done  6  months  immediately  after  the \ncommencement of construction and other related activities. This will be regularized (either on a \nmonthly  or  quarterly  basis)  depending  on  the  need  of  the  Project  and  requirements  of  MFEM \nand  ADB.  The  team  will  conduct  an  annual  evaluation.  If  the  construction  activities  cause  an \nunfavorable  environmental  condition,  the  monitoring  team,  through  the  PMU,  will  notify  the \nsteering committee, which will advise on appropriate action.  \n \nF. \n\nPublic Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n11. \nThe  ADB  Damage  Assessment  Mission  held  from  11\u201317  March  2005  identified  the \nurgency of undertaking rehabilitation of damaged areas. Consultations with Government officials \nconcerned,  affected  local  communities,  and  representatives  from  aid  partners  have  confirmed \nthat delay in the rehabilitation work would result in more harm to the ailing economy. The local \npopulace  is  in  dire  need  of  public  services  such  as  roads,  transport,  safe  water,  power, \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n45\n\ntelecommunication, hospitals, and schools. Reestablishing services would hasten the return of \ncommunities to their normal life and performance of their usual social and economic activities. \n\n \n12. \nIn  designing  the  rehabilitation  activities  and  conduct  of  actual  construction  works,  care \nmust be taken that the concerns of local people are incorporated in the plans and programs of \nactivities. Further consultations will be conducted during construction to ensure that their needs \nand requirements are considered. Representatives from the local communities will be invited to \nform part of the monitoring and evaluation team to examine overall project implementation.  \n\nG. \n\n \nFindings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n \n13. \nThe  project  activities  are  mainly  clean  up  and  repair  and  rehabilitation  in  scope,  while \nnew  construction  activities  (if  any)  will  be  very  minimal.  These  activities  are  expected  to  pose \nnegligible  impact  on  the  environment,  and  are  tolerable  depending  on  adherence  to  the \nmitigating  measures  defined.  Implementation  and  subsequent  completion  of  project  activities \nwould even result in more benefits, both socially and economically, for Cook Islanders.  \n\n \n14. \nNo  component  activities  of  the  Project  will  require  a  full  environmental  impact \nassessment,  and  therefore,  the  Project  may  proceed  as  planned,  and  the  identified  mitigating \nmeasures  be  duly  observed  during  construction  and  operation  and  maintenance  phases  of \nproject  implementation.  This  IEE  can  therefore  be  considered  as  the  required  environmental \nassessment for the project and no follow-up environmental impact assessment is needed. \n \n\n \n\n\f4\n6\n \n \n \n \n \n

given  to  the  same  phenomenon  in \ndifferent  parts  of  the  world.  They  are  weather  systems  with  strong  winds  that  circulate \nanticlockwise  around  low-pressure  areas  in  the  northern  hemisphere  and  clockwise  in  the \nsouthern  hemisphere.  They  are  capable  of  causing  massive  destruction  in  three  ways:  by \nhigh  winds,  heavy  rainfall  causing  inland  flooding;  and  storm-surge  flooding.  Tropical \ncyclones form near the equator near the open sea where the surface temperature is at least \n26\u00b0  Celsius.  They  may  last  with  destructive  power  for  2  weeks  or  more.  The  warm  sea \nprovides the overlying atmosphere with a continuous supply of energy and moisture, first to \ngenerate a tropical cyclone and then to maintain its destructive violence as it moves forward. \nThe diameter of a tropical storm, called the eye, may have a diameter ranging from 20\u2013150 \nkilometers  (km)  The  source  of  energy  is  cut  off  when  the  storm  crosses  a  coastline  and \nmoves inland, thus reducing its destructive power.  \n", "The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale uses a 1\u20135 rating to measure the cyclone\u2019s intensity and \nis used to give an estimate of the potential property damage and flooding expected along the \ncoast  from  a  cyclone  landfall.  Wind  speed  is  the  determining  factor  in  the  scale,  as  storm-\nsurge values are highly dependent on the slope of the continental shelf in the landfall region. \n \n", "Description of Hurricane \n", "Category \n", "Five \n", "Involving winds greater than 249 km per hour (km/hr) and storm surge generally \ngreater than 6 meters above normal, it is capable of causing complete roof failure \non  residential  and  industrial  buildings;  complete  building  failure  with  small  utility \nbuildings blown over or away; blowing away shrubs, trees, and signs; destruction \nof mobile homes; severe and extensive window and door damage; interruption of \nlow-lying escape routes with rising water; major damage to lower floor structures \nlocated  less  than  5  meters  above  sea  level  and  within  450  meters  of  the \nshoreline;  and  typically  requires  evacuation  of  residential  areas  on  low  ground \nwithin 8\u201316 km of the shoreline. \n", "Four \n", "Three  \n", "Two \n", "One  \n", "Involving winds of 210\u2013249 km/hr and storm surge generally at 4\u20136 meters above \nnormal,  it  is  capable  of  causing  extensive  curtain-wall  failure;  complete  roof \nstructure failure on small residences; strewn shrubs, trees, and tearing of signs; \ncomplete destruction of mobile homes; extensive damage to doors and windows, \nand interruption of low-lying escape routes with rising water in 3\u20135 hours before \narrival of the hurricane center; and major damage to lower floors and structures \nnear  the  shore.
