An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nundertaken and its summary (SEIA) was circulated on 21 August \n2006.  \n \nThe Project consists of the construction of a 156 megawatt (MW) \nhydropower  plant \nin \nQuang Nam  province,  central  Viet  Nam.  A  110  meter  (m)  high \nroller compacted concrete (RCC) dam with a crest length of 367 m \nwill  be  built  across  the  Song  Bung  river.  The  dam  will  form  a \nreservoir with a surface area of 15.8 square kilometers (km2) at a \nfull  supply  level  of  222.5  m  above  sea  level.  Water  from  the \nreservoir will be conveyed through a 3.1 kilometer (km) tunnel to \nthe power station, and released along a short tailrace canal to the \nSong Bung river about 5 km downstream of the dam.  \n  \nThe  Project  is  located  in  Nam  Giang  district  (bordering  the  Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic) of Quang Nam province in central \nViet Nam predominantly inhabited by indigenous people belonging \nto  the  Co  Tu  ethnic  minority.  The  Project  will  result  in  the \nrelocation of 206 mainly Co Tu households in Zuoih commune of \nNam  Giang  district.  The  Project  is  also  located  near  to  the  Song \nThanh  Nature  Reserve,  about  140  hectares  (ha)  of  which  will  be \ninundated. \n \nComprehensive  assessments  of  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  and \nsocial  impacts  have  been  undertaken  and  appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures  have  been  included  in  the  Project\u2019s  design.  These \ninclude  restoration  and  improvement  of  lost  livelihoods  in  a \nfor  project-affected  persons, \nculturally  appropriate  manner \nprovision  of  social  infrastructure,  and  conservation  offset  to \ncompensate  for  adverse  impacts  on  the  Song  Thanh  Nature \nReserve. \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nRationale \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nViet  Nam  has  maintained  a  GDP  growth  rate  of  over  7.5%  per \nyear  during  the  last  10  years  and  has  reduced  the  incidence  of \npoverty  from  58%  in  1993  to  less  than  20%  in  2007.  This  has \nbeen  achieved  through  rapid  industrialization  and  urbanization, \nwhich  have  increased  demand  for  electricity.  Electricity  demand \nhas grown at an average rate of 15% per annum; it is forecast to \nmaintain the same rate until 2010 and then to fall to 11% by 2015. \n \nThe planned capacity addition for 2007\u20132017 is over 40,000 MW, \nof which over 13,000 MW is already under construction. The total \ninvestment  requirement  in  the  power  sector  for  2007\u20132012  is \nabout $24 billion. Of this amount, Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) plans \nto  make  an  investment  of  $16  billion;  non-EVN  investments, \nincluding  from  the  private  sector,  are  expected  to  be  $8  billion. \nFinancing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) would bridge \nthe  financing  gap  in  the  sector  and  complement  financing  from \nother sources. \n \nThe Project is the first hydropower project in Viet Nam to receive \nfinancing  from  a  multilateral  financial  institution.  It  has  been \ndesigned  to  address  environmental  and  social  impacts  in  a \nsustainable  and  socially  inclusive  manner.  The  Project  will  also \npromote  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  in  the \nriver  basin  through  policy  dialogue  and  associated  technical \nassistance (TA). \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  impact  will  be  a  contribution  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nincreasing  power  demand  in  an  environmentally  sustainable  and \nsocially inclusive manner.   \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  outcome  will  be  increased  power  generation \ncapacity  in  Quang  Nam  Province,  Central  Viet  Nam  and, \nmitigation of adverse environmental  impacts, and restoration and \nimprovement of the livelihoods of project-affected persons.  \n \nThe \ntotal \n$267.3 million.  \n \nThe  Project  is  proposed  to  be  financed  using a  combination  of  a \n$196.0 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR), \na  loan  equivalent  to  $22.3  million  from  Viet  Nam  Development \nBank, and a $49.0 million contribution from EVN financed through \ninternal cash generation.  \n \n\ninvestment  cost  of \n\nis  estimated  at \n\nthe  Project \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe  ADB  loan  of  $196  million  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon inter bank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum,  \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements.  \n \nThe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will act as the borrower for the \nADB  loan,  which  will  be  relent  to  EVN.    The  Ministry  of  Finance \nwill levy a relending fee of 1.5 % on semiannual loan repayments \n(loan amortization plus interest).  \n \nUntil 30 June 2014 \n \n31 December 2013 \n\nfor \n\n \nThe Project will be implemented by the Song Bung 4 Hydropower \nmanagement  board,  a  project  management  board  of  EVN.  The \nthe  day-to-day \nmanagement  board  will  be  responsible \nmanagement  of  implementation  of  the  Project  under  the  overall \nsupervision  of  EVN.  The  technical  design  and  procurement  of \nmajor civil works contracts and equipment are subject to approval \nby EVN. The resettlement component will be carried out through a \ncommittee  consisting  of  representatives  from  the  management \nboard and the Nam Giang district people\u2019s committee reporting to \nQuang Nam province people\u2019s committee.   \n \nViet Nam Electricity (EVN) \n \nCivil works contracts and equipment to be financed under the loan \nwill  be  procured \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).     \n \nThe  loan  will  finance  the  following  consulting  services:  (i)  an \ninternational \nfor  project  supervision  on \ntechnical,  contractual,  resettlement,  and  environmental  aspects; \nand (ii) a national nongovernment organization or consultant firm \nfor independent monitoring of social and environment safeguards. \n \nThe  international  and  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \ntime).  The  Government \ntime \n(2007,  as  amended \nrequested  advance  action  for  recruitment  of  consultants  to \nminimize  delays  in  project  implementation.  ADB  has  approved \nadvance recruitment and informed the Government that this would \nnot commit ADB to financing the consultants.  \n \n\nfirm  of  consultants \n\nfrom \n\nto \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe  Project  will  help  to  meet  the  rapidly  growing  demand  for \nelectricity  in  Viet  Nam.  The  availability  of  reliable  and  cheap \nelectricity  is  an  essential  prerequisite  if  Viet  Nam\u2019s  rapid  and \nsocially  inclusive  economic  growth  is  to  be  maintained  and \npoverty  reduced.  The  Project  will  also  improve  the  stability  and \noverall  reliability  of  the  power  system,  and  further  reduce  the \ndependency of Viet Nam\u2019s power sector on fossil fuels, with their \nassociated  greenhouse  gas  emissions.    The  project  will  result  in \ncarbon  emission  reductions  because  it  will  replace  fossil-fuel- \nbased power generation.  \n \nThe  Project  will \nto  and  common \nimprove  accessibility \ninfrastructure  facilities  of  hitherto  remote  areas  in  Quang  Nam \nprovince.  The  livelihood  improvement  component  of  the  Project \nwill  improve  the  well-being  of  project-affected  persons  who \ncurrently depend on subsistence livelihoods.  \n \nThe  main  technical  risks  of  the  Project  relate  to  the  design  and \nconstruction of the 110 m high concrete dam and the geotechnical \nrisks of the dam site, power plant site, and alignment of the tunnel. \nThe  geotechnical  condition  of  the  project  site  is  good  and  is  not \nexpected \nto  cause  major  problems  during  construction  or \noperation.  Adequate  contingency  provisions  have  been  included \nin  the  cost  estimates  to  deal  with  possible  cost  overruns  caused \nby technical risks. The amount of electricity to be generated by the \nProject  depends  on  the  hydrology  of  the  river;  this  has  been \nthoroughly  assessed  and  the  implications  of  reduced  inflows  on \nelectricity  output  have  been  incorporated  into  the  sensitivity \nanalysis. \n \nThe  Project  also  depends  on  the  overall  financial  viability  of  the \npower  sector.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  sector  is  currently  undergoing \nrapid  expansion  to  meet  the  high  forecast  demand  growth  rate \nand any drop in the growth rate caused by an economic slowdown \nis likely to result in surplus capacity in 2010\u20132015. The increasing \ndebt  service  commitment  and  likely  increase  in  fossil  fuel  prices \n(Viet Nam  is  a  net  exporter  of  fossil  fuel)  may  also  require \nsustained tariff increases to maintain the viability of the sector. \n \nThe social risks of the Project relate to the implementation risk of \nthe resettlement and ethnic minority development plan, especially \nthe  livelihood  improvement  plan  for  affected  people.  A  grant  of \n$2 million, \nfor  Poverty \nReduction,  will  be  provided  to  finance  livelihood  improvement \nactivities that are beyond current government practice.  \n \n\nthe  Japan  Fund \n\nfinanced \n\nthrough \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nThe environmental issues relate to the adverse impact on aquatic \nspecies  caused  by  changes  to  flow  regime  in  the  river  and \nincreased access to Song Thanh Nature Reserve because of the \nProject.  The  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP)  has \nrecommended  appropriate  measures  to  minimize  these  impacts. \nHowever, proper implementation of the EMP during the operations \nphase  of  the  Project  remains  a  risk  that  needs  to  be  addressed \nthrough the monitoring mechanisms of the Government and ADB. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\fDa Nang\n\nu   G i a\n\ng .

The country strategy \nand  program  update  for  2006\u20132008 1  included  the  Project.  ADB  has  approved  two  technical \nassistance (TA) grants to prepare the Project .2 \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic  Performance  and  Linkages  with  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram \n\n2. \nViet  Nam\u2019s socioeconomic  development  since 1993  has  been  remarkable.  The country\u2019s \nsuccess in reducing poverty level from 58% in 1993 to less than 20% in 2007 is unprecedented. \nDuring this period, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has increased from $288 to $850 and \neconomic growth has averaged 7.5% per year with the growth rate for 2007 reaching 8.5%. The \nstructure  of  the  economy  has  been  transformed  since  1993\u2014the  share  of  the  energy-intensive \nindustry  and  service  sectors  has  increased  at  the  expense  of  the  agriculture  sector.  The  high \neconomic growth has been underpinned by robust and sustainable levels of investment equal to \n40%  of  GDP  in  2007.  An  increasing  share  of  investment,  especially  in  the  manufacturing \nindustries  and  service  sector,  has  been  made  by  the  private  sector.  Foreign  direct  investment \napprovals exceeded $20 billion in 2007, an increase of over 80% compared with 2006. \n \n3. \nThe  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  maintaining  its  impressive  record  of  sustainable  and \nsocially inclusive economic growth is outlined in the Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) \nfor  2006\u20132010  approved  by  the  National  Assembly  in  May  2006.  The  SEDP  acknowledges  the \ncritical importance of private sector participation, good governance, and integration with the global \neconomy  through,  among  others,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  membership  of  the  World  Trade  Organization. \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Viet Nam 2007\u201320103 supports the key objectives of the \nSEDP  in  achieving  a  balance  between  business-led  economic  growth,  social  equity,  and \nenvironmental  sustainability  while  strengthening  the  governance  of  public  sector  institutions  and \nsupporting  private  sector  investments  in  the  productive  sectors  of  the  economy.  The  country \nstrategy  and  program  identifies  the  critical  importance  of  removing  infrastructure  bottlenecks  in \nthe  energy  and  transport  sectors  to  further  increase  the  competitiveness  of  Viet Nam\u2019s  private-\nsector-led manufacturing and service sectors.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nMajor Challenges Facing the Power and Energy Sectors \n\na. \n\nMeeting Rapidly Increasing Demand   \n\nThe  key  challenge  facing  the  power  sector  is  maintaining  adequate  investments  to  meet \n4. \nthe rapid growth in demand. The performance of Viet Nam\u2019s power sector and the government\u2019s \npower  sector  strategy  is  described  in  Appendix  2.  The  projected  power  generation  capacity \naddition during 2007\u20132017 (Table 1) is over 40,000 megawatts (MW), of which over 13,000 MW \nare under construction and will be commissioned by 2012. Managing an expansion program that \nis  expected  to  increase  the  system  capacity  by  more  than  four  times  within  10  years  will  be  a \nmajor challenge for the institutions in the power sector. EVN will undertake more than half of the \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005. Viet Nam Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008).

Private  sector  investments \nwill be focused on thermal power generation and medium-sized and small hydropower plants and \nrenewable energy plants.   \n \n5. \nThe Government is keen to reduce Viet Nam\u2019s energy intensity (0.66 tons of oil equivalent \n[toe]  per  $1,000  GDP)  to  a  level  similar  to  those  of  its  neighbors  (0.40  toe  per  $1,000  GDP  in \nMalaysia and 0.38 toe per $1,000 GDP in Thailand). The Government has formulated a national \nenergy efficiency and conservation program, consisting of economic incentives, capacity building \nand administrative measures, and time-bound efficiency targets.  Although the program covers all \nsectors of the economy it focuses on the rapidly expanding industrial sector. The objectives of the \nProgram  are  (i)  to  establish  energy  efficiency  programs  at  60%  of  large  and  medium-sized \nenergy-consuming consumers; (ii) to formulate an energy-efficiency building code; (iii) to achieve \na  3\u20135  %  reduction  in  national  energy  consumption  and  a  5%  reduction  in  industrial  energy \nconsumption by 2010; and (iv) to achieve a 5\u20138 % reduction in national energy consumption and \nan 8% reduction in industrial energy consumption by 2015 per unit of economic output.  \n \n\nTable 1: Projected Capacity Additions to Viet Nam Power System, 2007\u20132015 \n(megawatt) \n\nType of Plant \n \n\nHydro  \nCoal \nNatural Gas/ \nFurnace Oil  \nSmall Hydro and \nRenewable \nImport \n\n2007\u20132012 \n\n2013\u20132017 \n\nEVN \n3,000 \n   900 \n600 \n\nNon-EVN \n     1,500 \n  3,800 \n   2,800 \n\nEVN \n5,300 \n10,800 \n \n\nNon-EVN \n1,900 \n5,100 \n2,700 \n\nTotal \n \n11,700 \n  20,600 \n  6,100  \n\n \n\n350 \n\n \n\n1,000 \n\n1,350 \n\n \n4,600 \n\n500 \n8,950 \n\n \n16,100 \n\n1,400 \n12,100 \n\n1,900 \n41,650 \n\nTotal \nEVN = Viet Nam Electricity. \nSource:  Institute of Energy, Viet Nam \n\nb. \n\nMobilizing Financial Resources and Maintaining Financial Viability \n\nTable 2 summarizes the investment requirements in the power sector to 2017. \n\n \n\n6. \n \n\nTable 2: Investment Requirements in the Power Sector \n($ million) \n\nItem \nGenerating capacity \n\nTotal EVN \nTotal non-EVN \nTotal generation \nTransmission and Distribution \n\nTransmission  \nDistribution  \n\nTotal transmission and distribution \n \n\nTotal \nEVN = Viet Nam Electricity. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n2007\u20132012 \n\n2013\u20132017 \n\n2007\u20132017 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8,900 \n8,100 \n17,000 \n \n2,400 \n4,600 \n7,000 \n24,000 \n\n12,200 \n3,300 \n15,500 \n \n2,300 \n4,200 \n6,500 \n22,000 \n\n21,100 \n11,400 \n32,500 \n \n4,700 \n8,800 \n13,500 \n46,000 \n\n \n7. \nThe  total  investment  requirement  in  the  power  sector  for  2007\u20132012  will  be  about  $24 \nbillion, of which EVN will invest $16 billion and others will invest about $8 billion. A similar level of \ninvestment  is  expected  to  be  maintained  for  the  period  2013\u20132017.  The  net  internal  cash \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3\n \n\ngeneration  of  EVN  for  the  period  2007\u20132012  is  expected  to  be  about  $9  billion,  and  its  net \nborrowings to be about $7 billion. EVN is increasingly resorting to borrowing on commercial terms \nfrom export credit agencies and from ADB on ordinary capital resources (OCR) terms. The World \nBank  is  also  considering  lending  to  EVN  on  OCR  equivalent  terms.  EVN  also  intends  to  raise \nfunding in the international and domestic capital markets through a series of bond issues.  \n \n8. \nSince  its  creation,  EVN  has  been  profitable  and  has  financed  the  rapid  expansion  of \nViet Nam\u2019s  electricity  sector  without  resorting  to  significant  fiscal  subsidies.  The  key  financial \nperformance  indicators;  debt  service  cover  ratio,  self-financing  ratio,  and  receivables  have  been \nmaintained  within  prudential  limits  while  the  average  end  user  tariff  had  been  maintained  at \n$0.051  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  until  2007.  The  average  tariff  was  increased  at  the  beginning  of \n2007  to  $0.053/kWh  and  a  further  tariff  increase  of  5%  is  expected  in  the  second  half  of  2008. \nSustained tariff increases are required to maintain adequate levels of debt service coverage and \nfinancing  new  investments  because  of  increasing  debt  financing  and  financial  obligations  for \npower purchase from independent power producers (IPP).  \n \n\nc. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Issues  \n\n9. \nThe  rapid  expansion  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  sector  will  inevitably  result  in  significant \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts.  The  addition  of  over  20,000  MW  of  coal  power  generation \ncapacity will contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions. However, the current level of per \ncapita greenhouse gas emissions in Viet Nam is among the lowest in the world. Supercritical and \nultra-supercritical boiler technologies can help to increase efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions per kWh produced. The Government is keen on applying these advanced technologies \nand  has  taken  a  decision  that  new  coal  power  plants  using  imported  coal  will  use  supercritical \nboiler  technologies.  Hydropower  projects  involve  significant  resettlement  and  environment \nimpacts. The Government has strengthened its approach to mitigation of social and environmental \nimpacts  through  improved  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  arrangements  for \nproject-affected  persons.  The  Government  also  supports  the  enactment  of  legislation  to \nmainstream  the  benefit  sharing  of  hydropower  projects  with  the  affected  communities  based  on \nthe recommendations of ADB TA.4  \n \n\nloans  were  primarily \n\nADB Sector Experience \n\n2. \nADB  has  approved  three  OCR  loans 5  amounting  to  $1,480  million  and  three  Asian \n10. \nDevelopment  Fund  (ADF)  loans6 amounting  to  $186.3  million  for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  sector.

More  recently  ADB  has  focused  on  power \ngeneration.  For  example  the  Mong  Duong  1  Thermal  Power  Project  (footnote  5)  is  financing \npower generation facilities using domestic coal in an environmentally sustainable manner.  ADB \nhas  also  supported  private  sector  investment  in  power  generation  by  providing  direct  loans  and \npolitical  risk  guarantees  for  the  Phu  My  2.2  gas-fired  power  project  in  2002  and  the  Phu  My  3 \nproject in 2003. 8 During 2005 and 2006, ADB approved a series of advisory TA (ADTA) projects9 \nto improve the crosscutting social and environmental issues of the power sector, and three project \npreparatory TA (PPTA) projects to prepare the current Project and the Mong Duong, and O Mon \nthermal power projects (the latter two projects are to be implemented in a phased manner by EVN \nand  the  private  sector).10 ADB  approved  an  ADTA  to  assist  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade \n(MOIT)  to  implement  the  national  program  on  energy  efficiency  and  conservation.

Since  1995,  the \nWorld Bank has approved over $1.3 billion of International Development Association (IDA) credits \nto  the  sector  for  expanding  the  transmission  network  and  rural  electrification.  More  recent \nWorld Bank  projects  focus  on  the  institutional  aspects  of  rural  power  supply.  Sida  has  financed \nthe  equipment  for  the  Song  Hinh  hydropower  cascade.

External assistance to Viet Nam power sector is listed in \nAppendix 7.  \n\n4. \n\nLessons on Hydropower Development \n\n \n\n14. \nIn  2000,  the  World  Commission  on  Dams  (WCD)  published  a  global  review  of  dam \nprojects.  While  recognizing  the  important  contribution  of  dams,  the  report  highlighted  several \nshortcomings\u2014including  high  variability  in  delivering  predicted  outcomes,  impoverishment  of \naffected communities, and limited success in dealing with environmental impacts. Although such \nproblems  are  often  attributed  to  project  planning,  ineffective  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures  during  the  operation  phase  also  contributed.  An  evaluation  of  four  hydropower \nprojects13 undertaken by ADB, also concluded that many problems were associated with project \nplanning; and attributed them to weak public participation, inadequate attention to environmental \nprotection  measures  and  monitoring,  and  lack  of  attention  to  livelihood  restoration.  Post-\nevaluation of the Nam Leuk hydropower project14 in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR)  raised  a  number  of  issues  that  went  beyond  the  physical  implementation  timetable  of  the \nproject,  including  how  to  replace  lost  fisheries  and  provide  clean  water  supplies  to  affected \ncommunities.  \n \n15.  Many  of  these  lessons  are  reflected  in  ADB\u2019s  framework  of  social,  environmental,  and \nsector policies\u2014in particular, the identification of project-specific and cumulative impacts, and the \ndesign of mitigation measures. During the preparation of the Project, extensive consultations were \nundertaken  and  alternative  mitigation  options  were  explored  with  local  communities.  Livelihood \ndevelopment measures were proposed to cover upstream and downstream communities to offset \nany loss of income due to adverse impacts on fisheries. Links were established to complementary \ndonor-financed programs such as the Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative15 to provide an \nintegrated  approach  to  environmental  mitigation.  At  a  policy  level,  longer  term  support  to  local \ncommunities  is  being  explored  with  the  Government  through  proposed  ADB  TA  on  a  benefit \nsharing arrangement for project-affected communities (footnote 4). \n\n \n\n5. \n\nADB Sector Strategy  \n\n16. \nSocially  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  economic  growth  is  a  key  pillar  in \nADB\u2019s country strategy for Viet Nam. The competitiveness of Viet Nam\u2019s economy, especially the \nindustrial  sector,  depends  on  the  availability  of  a  cheap  and  reliable  supply  of  electricity.  ADB\u2019s \npower sector strategy aims to help the Government to meet the challenge of increasing demand \n\n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2002.

The  large \ninvestment  requirement  of  the  power  sector  ($2.5  billion\u2013$3.5  billion  per  annum)  requires \nconcerted  efforts  from  both  public  and  private  sector  investors  and  a  significant  proportion  of \npublic sector investments have to be financed through multilateral or bilateral financing.  With the \nGovernment\u2019s  strong  drive  to  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energy  in  total  electricity \ngeneration,  and  with  the  low  prevalence  of  renewable  energy  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  current  electricity \ngeneration  mix,  opportunities  for  financing  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  investments \nwill be actively pursued. The key aspects of ADB\u2019s sector strategy are summarized below.   \n\n \na. \n\nMobilizing Financial Resources for the Power Sector \n\n \n17. \nADB\u2019s interventions in the power sector will focus on financing environmentally sustainable \npower generation and high voltage transmission lines, including links between Viet Nam and other \nGreater Mekong Subregion countries. While ADB finances hydropower projects as public sector \ninvestments, it will play a catalytic role in mobilizing private sector investment for thermal power \ngeneration. This approach is consistent with the Government\u2019s strategy of financing hydropower \nprojects  as  public  sector  investments  because  of  their  multipurpose  nature  and  long  gestation \nperiod, and attracting private investments in partnership with the public sector for thermal power \nplants.  An  example  is  the  Mong  Duong  Thermal  Power  Project  (2,200  MW),  structured  as  a \npublic\u2013private  partnership  in  which  phase  1  and  the  common  facilities  will  be  implemented  by \nEVN with ADB OCR financing (footnote 5) and phase 2 will be implemented by a private sector \ninvestor with possible ADB support through the Private Sector Operations Department.   \n \n\nb. \n\nMobilizing Financial Resources to the Power Sector \n\nADB  will  also  increasingly  leverage  co-financing  from  other  financiers  in  the  sector.  This \n18. \nwill include (i) providing political risk and partial credit guarantees, (ii) acting as lender of record \nunder a complementary financing scheme, and (iii) providing guarantees to export credit agencies \nand  other  commercial  financiers  to  mitigate  political  and  other  risks  of  a  project.  ADB  will  also \nassist  public  sector  entities  in  the  sector  to  access  international  capital  markets  by  providing \nadvisory and risk-sharing instruments under the innovation and efficiency initiative. \n \n\nc. \n\nImproving the Regulatory Framework of the Power Sector \n\n19. \nStarting  in  1997,  ADB  has  played  a  catalytic  role  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  sector  reform \nprogram through several technical assistance grants. ADB has an ongoing Power Market Design \nTA  (footnote  7)  to  provide  further  assistance  to  MOIT  to  establish  the  basic  framework  for  the \nproposed electricity market and for capacity building of the electricity regulator. ADB will provide \ntargeted TA to MOIT in close collaboration with other donors active in the sector. The World Bank \nand AFD are also actively involved in assisting the Government with power sector reform.    \n \n\nd. \n\nDealing with Environmental and Social Issues \n\n20. \nThe investment projects need to be coupled with policy dialogue to improve the social and \nenvironmental  sustainability  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  generation  expansion  program.  ADB  has \nprovided  targeted  TA  (footnote 9)  to  sector  entities  and  national  and  provincial  enforcement \nagencies to deal with adverse impacts at both national and project level. The objectives of the TA \nare  general  capacity  building  in  strategic  and  cumulative  environment  assessment,  livelihood \nimprovement,  and  exploring  possible  revenue  sharing  mechanisms  with  project-affected \ncommunities. ADB will actively promote the adoption of clean and more efficient technologies for \nnew  power  generating  projects,  particularly  supercritical  and  ultra-supercritical  technologies  for \ncoal-fired  power  plants  and  combined  cycle  gas-fired  power  plants.  Regional  technical \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n \n\nassistance16 will  enhance  the  capability  of  power  utility  staff  and  provincial  officials  in  preparing \nenvironment  impact  assessments  and  implementing  and  monitoring  environment  management \nplans.   \n \n\ne. \n\nPromoting Investments in Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \n\n21. \nADB  has  not  directly  financed  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  projects  in \nViet Nam, partly because such projects are small. However, in the context of ADB\u2019s new initiatives \non energy efficiency and the clean energy, ADB will play an important role in promoting renewable \nenergy  and  energy  efficiency  investments  by  providing  TA  as  well  as  loans  and  guarantees  for \ndevelopers and facilitating access to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Access to debt \nfinancing  for  both  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  investments  has  been  identified  by \nproject developers as a constraint. ADB will work with domestic financing institutions to address \nthis issue through appropriately designed lending or guarantee products and policy interventions \nmaking use of the resources and expertise available at ADB through the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility and Carbon Market Initiative. In this regard ADB is providing policy advice to \nMOIT  on  promoting  energy  efficiency  in  the  industrial  sector  (footnote  11).  Recently  ADB  has \nbeen requested by MOIT to assist in electrifying 400 remote communes using off-grid renewable \nenergy  technologies  and  to  draft  a  renewable  energy  law  to  establish  the  legal  and  policy \nframework for renewable energy investments.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n22. \nThe impact of the proposed Project will be to contribute to meeting Viet Nam\u2019s electricity \ndemand with reliable and economical sources of electricity generation using the country\u2019s natural \nresources.  The  Project  will  also  set  an  example  for  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially \ninclusive  hydropower  development.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  is  increased  power  generation \ncapacity  in  Quang  Nam  Province,  Central  Viet  Nam  and,  mitigation  of  adverse  environmental \nimpacts,  and  restoration  and  improvement  of  the  livelihoods  of  project-affected  persons.  The \nDesign and Monitoring Framework of the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n1. \n\nConstruction of the Hydroelectric Plant and Related Infrastructure \n\n23. \nThe  project  site  is  in  the  central  province  of  Quang  Nam,  about  950  km  south  of  Hanoi. \nThe Project includes the construction of a 156 MW hydropower plant on the Bung river, a tributary \nof  the  Vu  Gia  river.  The  Project  forms  a  cascade  with  the  proposed  Song  Bung  2  hydropower \nproject  (located  upstream  of  the  Project)  and  Song  Bung  5  hydropower  project  (located \ndownstream  of  the  Project).  A  110  meter  (m)  high  roller  compacted  concrete  (RCC)  dam  will \ncapture the flow of water from the watershed of the Bung river, creating a reservoir of 15.8 square \nkilometers (km2) surface area in Zuoih and Ta Bhing communes of Nam Giang district in Quang \nNam province. Water from the reservoir will be conveyed through a 3.1 kilometer (km) tunnel and \nwill  drop  about  26  m  to  an  aboveground  power  house.  The  water  discharged  from  the  power \nhouse will be returned through a short tailrace canal to the Song Bung river, 5 km downstream of \nthe dam. The Project will also include a double-circuit 220-kV transmission line about 35 km long \nfrom the power house to Thanh My in Nam Giang district. On average, 491 gigawatt-hours (GWh) \nof power will be provided annually to the EVN grid. The main infrastructure components consist of \nthe  concrete  dam  with  integral  gated  spillway;  intake  structure,  headrace  tunnel,  surge  shaft, \npressure shaft, and pressure tunnel in the underground works; a power house consisting of two \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB.  2007.

Appendix \n3 provides the technical details of the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nResettlement of Affected Communities \n\nThe  reservoir  will  result  in  the  inundation  of  four  villages  and  the  relocation  of  \n24. \n206 households, including the center of Zuoih commune in Nam Giang district\u2014one of the most \nremote and mountainous communes in the district. The reservoir will flood the agricultural land of \n52 households in two other villages in Ta Binh commune. The affected persons belong to the Co \nTu  ethnic  minority  group  and  over  70%  of  them  are  below  the  national  poverty  line.  For  the \nrelocating  villages,  the  Project  will  provide  new  resettlement  sites,  including  associated \ninfrastructure  (such  as  access  roads)  and  better  common  facilities  (such  as  schools  and  health \nfacilities);  and  provide  assistance  to  restore  and  improve  the  livelihoods  in  a  culturally  sensitive \nmanner. The proposed resettlement sites are in the same commune and have been selected on \nthe basis of a thorough analysis of the potential for improving the livelihoods of affected persons \nbased on upland and wet rice cultivation, collection of non-timber forestry products, livestock, and \nfishponds.  EVN  will  finance  infrastructure  facilities,  including  housing,  agriculture  and  livestock \ninputs,  transitional  cash  allowances,  and  cash  compensation  for  lost  assets  according  to \nprevailing government regulations. A complementary grant of $2 million financed by Japan Fund \nfor  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  will  finance  enhanced  livelihood  improvement,  including  capacity \nbuilding for project-affected persons, which goes beyond current government practices.  \n\n \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nReflecting International Good Practice in Hydropower Development  \n\nA  number  of  initiatives  have  been  proposed  to  address  the  social,  environmental,  and \n25. \ngovernance  problems  often  associated  with  the  planning  and  implementation  of  hydropower \nprojects.17 These  have  been  considered  during  the  preparation  of  the  Project,  in  the  context  of \nViet  Nam,  including  initial  screening  of  different  generation  and  site  options  in  the  National \nHydropower  Plan  Study18,  assessment  of  alternative  design  and  layout  configurations,  and  the \ninclusion  of  mitigation  measures  for  projected  social  and  environmental  impacts  in  the  project \ndesign.  A  checklist  of  the  Project\u2019s  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  water  policy19 and  integrated  water \nresources management (IWRM) principles is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n26. \nA development-oriented objective\u2014in which the primary aim is to improve the livelihoods \nof  those  adversely  affected\u2014underlies  the  approach  to  mitigating  negative  social  impacts.  This \nwill be achieved through a range of project-specific interventions targeted at both household and \ncommunity  levels,  as  set  out  in  the Project\u2019s  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  plan \n(REMDP). In addition, at the policy level, ADB is supporting ERAV\u2019s program to develop long-term \narrangements to direct project benefits at affected communities through the TA on benefit sharing \nmechanisms  for  people  adversely  affected  by  power  generation  projects  (footnote  4).  The \nREMDP,  the  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA),  and  the  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP),  incorporate  clear  statements  on  the  entitlements  of  affected  persons,  resettlement \nprocedures, environmental mitigation actions, responsibilities for implementation, and budgets.  \n \n\nIntegrated Water Resources Management in the river Basin  \n\n2. \nThe  National  Water  Resources  Strategy  of  Viet  Nam,  supported  by  ADB,20 incorporates \n27. \nthe  principles  of  IWRM  and  reflects  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  development  of  IWRM \n                                                 \n17 These  include  the  recommendations  to  improve  development  outcomes  prepared  by  WCD,  and  the  Sustainability \n\nGuidelines and Compliance Protocol of the International Hydropower Association. \n\n18 Joint venture SWECO International, Statkraft Groner and Norplan/Electricity of Vietnam. 2007.

Facilitation  and  technical  support  is \nprovided through a pilot demonstration activity funded by ADB\u2019s Water Cooperation Fund.  \n \n28. \nIn  parallel  with  the  proposed  Project,  TA  has  been  provided  to  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources and Environment (MONRE) and Quang Nam Provincial authorities in capacity building \nfor strategic environment assessment (SEA) of the hydropower sector (footnote 9). The Vu Gia-\nThu  Bon  river  basin,  where  the  proposed  Project  is  located,  has  been  selected  for  testing  the \nmethodologies  to  be  developed  under  the  TA  for  strategic  environment  assessment.  The  pilot \nstudy has taken into account the impacts of all seven proposed hydropower projects23 in the river \nbasin.    The  project-specific  recommendations  of  the  SEA  will  be  incorporated  into  the \nEnvironment Management Plan of the Project as appropriate.  \n \n\n3. \n\nConsultations and Disclosure \n\nInitial consultations on overall hydropower development in Viet Nam were held at national, \n29. \nprovincial,  river  basin  levels.  Consultations  were  also  held  in  sample  districts,  communes,  and \nvillages  as  part  of  the  preparation  of  the  National  Hydropower  Plan.    These  consultations \ndiscussed  the  need  for  specific  hydropower  projects,  including  the  Song  Bung  4  Hydropower \nProject,  in  relation  to  national  development  goals,  alternative  layouts,  expected  project  impacts, \nand  associated  mitigation  measures.  The  stakeholder  analysis  was  further  refined  during  the \nPPTA  phase  I (footnote  2),  using  an  approach  based  on  the  rights,  risks,  and  responsibilities  of \nthe various stakeholder groups.  \n \n30. \nThese initial consultations formed the foundation of an extensive and detailed participation \nstrategy implemented during preparation of the REMDP, covering project-affected communities in \nthe reservoir, both upstream and downstream, and agencies at district and provincial levels. The \nbasic principles were inclusiveness and openness, encouragement of active participation, cultural \nand gender sensitivity, and meaningful participation in the design of mitigation measures. Outputs \nfrom the consultations in the villages included informed decisions on the location of resettlement \nvillages, village and house design, and components of the livelihood development programs.  \n \n31. \nThree stakeholder workshops were held in relation to the environmental assessment of the \nProject to solicit input to the environment assessment process and provide feedback on the initial \nfindings and mitigation proposals. The first and third meetings were held in Nam Giang district; the \nsecond  meeting  was  held  in  the  provincial  capital  of  Tam  Ky  and  included  representatives  from \nQuang  Nam  province  and  Da  Nang  City.  The  consultations  reflected  the  provisions  of  national \nregulatory  requirements  and  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies,  and  provided  an  opportunity  for \nstakeholders  to  give  feedback  on  the  need  for  and  implications  of  the  Project  in  line  with  the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy.  The  REMDP  and  SEIA  have  been  made  available  to \naffected communities in the Vietnamese language and posted on the internet.  \n \n\n4. \n\nBenefit Sharing with Affected Communities   \n\nPolicy dialogue between ADB and the Government on the principle of sharing the benefits \n32. \nof  hydropower  development  with  local  communities  has  been  undertaken  through  the  TA  on \n\n                                                 \n21  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  the  Environment.  2006.

This  TA  reviewed  experience  from  developed  and  developing  countries; \nprepared  policy  guidance  on  measures  to  direct  a  share  of  hydropower  revenues  to  local \ncommunity  development,  livelihood  restoration  and  improvement  of  affected  people,  and  as \npayment  for  environmental  services  such  as  watershed  protection;  and  developed  detailed \nguidelines  for  pilot  implementation  of  benefit-sharing  mechanism  for  a  selected  hydropower \nproject. The Government has accepted the initial recommendations of the TA and requested ADB \nassistance  to  pilot  test  the  proposed  guidelines  for  benefit-sharing  in  the  A  Vuong  hydropower \nproject located in the Quang Nam province.  ADB Management has approved a change in scope \nto the TA on benefit-sharing for this purpose and the guidelines will be finalized in the form of a \ndecree to be issued by MOIT based on the lessons learned from the pilot test. \n \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan  \n\nA  summary  of  the  EMP  is  included  in  the  summary  environmental  impact  assessment \n33. \n(SEIA), and the detailed EMP is included in the EIA. The SEIA is in Supplementary Appendix B \nand the EIA is in Supplementary Appendix C. The main environmental Issues are summarized in \nAppendix  11.  The  SEIA  was  first  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  21  August  2006. \nImplementation of the EMP is the responsibility of the implementing agency (IA), and a dedicated \nenvironmental management unit (EMU) will be set up in the IA for this purpose. The key aspects \nof the EMP are as follows. \n \n\nConstruction  phase.  Controlling  soil  erosion  and  siltation,  maintaining  the  water \nquality of the river, minimizing the loss of flora during construction, and controlling \nwildlife trading and hunting by construction workers.  \n\nOperation  phase.  Maintaining  water  quality,  operating  Song  Bung  5  when \nconstructed  as  a  daily  reregulating  reservoir  to  minimize  water  level  fluctuations \ndownstream  and  reduce  impacts  on  aquatic  life,  strengthening  the  capacity  of \nSong  Thanh  Nature  Reserve  management  board  to  control  illegal  logging  and \nhunting caused by the increased access to the reserve, and better management of \nthe watershed to minimize soil erosion. \n\nSocial Safeguard Issues \n\n34. \nThe  Project  is  located  in  one  of  the  poorest  and  most  remote  parts  of  central  Viet  Nam \n(Nam  Giang  district  of  Quang  Nam  province),  predominantly  inhabited  by  the  Co  Tu  ethnic \nminority who have had little contact with the mainstream Kinh people. The Co Tu people maintain \na  traditional  lifestyle  based  on  subsistence  agriculture  and  collection  of  non-timber  forest \nproducts,  which  provides  most  of  their  cash  income.  The  Project  will  result  in  the  physical \nrelocation  of  four  Co  Tu  villages  in  Zuoih  commune\u2014comprising  206  households,  the  loss  of  a \nsignificant  portion  of  agricultural  land,  and  the  commune  center  housing  the  school  and  health \ncenter.  The  Project  will  also  affect  the  agricultural  lands  of  three  other  communes  (Ta  Binh,  Ca \nDy, and Thanh My) with majority Co Tu populations because of land acquisition for construction \nsites  and  the  transmission  line  associated  with  the  Project.  It  is  estimated  that  a  further  1,500\u2013\n2,000  Kinh  households  in  the  neighboring  Dai  Loc  district  will  have  their  livelihoods  affected \nbecause of the expected reduction in fishing in the Song Bung river.  \n \nThe  Project  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB  safeguards,  including  the \n35. \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy24 and the Policy on Indigenous Peoples25. As the majority of the \nsignificantly  affected  persons  belong  to  the  Co  Tu  ethnic  minority,  indigenous  peoples\u2019  issues \nhave  been  mainstreamed  into  the  resettlement  plan  and  a  combined  resettlement  and  ethnic \nminority development plan (REMDP) has been prepared for the Project. This reflects the outcome \nof  extensive  consultations  with  affected  persons,  and  emphasizes  maintaining  traditional  culture \nand  improving  livelihoods.  A  participatory  implementation  arrangement  for  resettlement  is \n                                                 \n24  ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Manila. \n25  ADB. 1998.

The REMDP is in Supplementary Appendix A and is summarized in Appendix 10; \nthe summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. The gender action plan to \naddress  negative  impacts  of  the  Project  on  women  and  to  maximize  benefits  to  women  is \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix D. The detailed gender action plan is in Supplementary \nAppendix  E  and  the  Construction  Phase  Social  Management  Plan  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix G.   \n \n\n7. \n\nEnhanced Livelihoods Program for Affected People (JFPR Grant) \n\n36. \nAlthough  recent  national  legislation  on  involuntary  resettlement  (prepared  with  ADB \nassistance)  stipulates  that  poor  and  vulnerable  resettled  persons  should  be  assisted  to  improve \ntheir livelihoods in a sustainable manner, current practice in Viet Nam is limited to the provision of \nagricultural  inputs  such  as  seeds,  fertilizer,  and  livestock  for  12 months,  and  rice  and  food \nallowances for up to 3 years. While ADB\u2019s policies and the Government\u2019s legislation have similar \nobjectives  of  improving  conditions  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  the  approaches  to  resettlement \nand  ethnic  minority  planning  and  implementation  differ  significantly.    EVN  is  committed  to \nfinancing preparation of resettlement sites, including associated village infrastructure, housing and \ncommunity  facilities,  cash  compensation  for  lost  assets,  transitional  cash  allowances  and \nlivelihood support in accordance with current government standards.    \n \n37. \nAn enhanced livelihood improvement support program has been proposed in the REMDP \nand activities that go beyond current government practices will be financed through the proposed \nJFPR  grant  of  $2  million.  This  will  provide  an  example  for  future  resettlement  as  a  result  of \nhydropower projects, as Viet Nam is embarking on a large hydropower program (over 20 projects \nto  be  built  in  2006\u20132015)  affecting  over  150,000  people,  most  of  whom  belong  to  poor  and \nvulnerable ethnic minorities.  \n \n\n8. \n\nClean Development Mechanism (CDM) \n\n38. \nAs  the  Project  involves  significant  financial  commitments  to  mitigate  the  social  and \nenvironmental impacts, its financial rate of return is not as attractive as those of other hydropower \nprojects  financed  by  EVN.  As  a  result,  EVN  is  seeking  additional  revenues  through  the  CDM  to \nimprove  the  financial  viability  of  the  Project.  The  Project  qualifies  as  a  CDM  project  under  the \napproved methodology of the CDM executive board as the power density of the Project (i.e., the \nratio  between  installed  generation  capacity  in  MW  and  the  surface  area  of  the  reservoir  at  full \nsupply  level  in  sq.  km)  is  greater  than  4.  A  project  design  document  will  be  prepared  for \nsubmission to the CDM Executive Board. A brief CDM assessment report has been prepared and \nis attached as Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n39. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $267.3 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties  of  $15.2  million.

The  interest  on  the  ADB  loan  during  construction  will  be \ncapitalized  and  the  taxes  on  ADB-financed  procurement  contracts  will  be  financed  by  the  loan. \nThe inclusion of taxes in loan financing for Viet Nam was approved by ADB Management on 27 \nJune 2007. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will be the borrower and the proceeds of the loan \nwill be relent to EVN with a re-lending rate equivalent to OCR rate plus 1.5% of semiannual loan \nrepayment (loan amortization plus interest).  The ADB loan  will have a  25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such \nother terms and conditions as are set forth in the loan agreement. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for the decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  this  choice  was  its  own \nindependent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB. \nResettlement  costs,  including  the  access  roads  to  resettlement  sites,  will  be  financed  by  a  loan \nequivalent  to  $22.3 million  from  Viet  Nam  Development  Bank.  Financing  by  EVN  will  amount  to \n$49.0 million and will be funded through its internal cash generation. The analysis of EVN\u2019s cash \nflows shows that EVN has sufficient cash flows for this purpose. The financing plan is in Table 4.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n \n\nTable 4: Financing Plan \n($ million equivalent) \n \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nViet Nam Development Bank \nViet Nam Electricity  \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nTotal \n196.0 \n22.3 \n49.0 \n\n267.3 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n% \n73.3 \n8.4 \n18.3 \n\n100.0 \n\n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n41. \nEVN  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  responsible  for  implementation  of  the  Project \nthrough  the  Song  Bung  4  Hydropower  Project  management  board  (the  management  board), \nwhich  will  be  the  IA.  The  management  board  was  created  by  transferring  staff  from  the  former \nHydropower Project Management Unit No. 3, which was responsible for implementing hydropower \nprojects located in central Viet Nam and has successfully implemented the Song Hinh hydropower \nproject,  financed  by  Sida.  It  was  also  involved  in  project  management  of  four  other  hydropower \nprojects,  including  two  projects  presently  under  construction.    The  key  technical  staff  of  the \nmanagement  board  will  be  exclusively  engaged  in  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  The \nmanagement  board  has  about  45  employees,  including  specialists  in  engineering,  environment, \nresettlement,  economics,  and  finance.  It  will  coordinate  and  monitor  all  project  construction \nactivities,  including  mobilization  of  design  and  supervision  consultants,  preparation  of  bid \ndocuments, bid evaluation, construction supervision, and approving payments to contractors. The \ntechnical  design,  bid  documents,  and  contract  award  are  subject  to  approval  by  the  EVN  head \noffice. The main findings of financial management assessment are summarized in Appendix 9.  \n \n42.      The  environment  and  social  division  of  the  management  board  is  responsible  for  the \nenvironmental and social aspects of the Project. Prior to the commencement of construction work, \nthe  management  board  will  set  up  an  environment  management  unit  (EMU)  to  implement  the \nEMP,  including  environment  monitoring  during  the  construction  phase  of  the  Project.  The  EMU \nwill be supported by the supervision consultants. A resettlement management and implementation \nunit  (RMIU)  will  be  established,  consisting  of  management  board staff  and  representatives  from \nNam  Giang  district  people\u2019s  committee,  and  assisted  by  JFPR-financed  consultants  to  manage \nthe implementation of REMDP, including the livelihood improvement of affected people.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period  \n\n43. \nProject  implementation  began  immediately  after  the  Government\u2019s  approval  of  the \nfeasibility study in August 2007. EVN has recruited a national consulting firm using its own funds \nto undertake the detailed technical design of the Project and to prepare the bidding documents. In \nparallel  with  the  technical  design,  recruitment  of  ADB-financed  consultants  for  implementation \nsupervision has begun under advance action procedures. It is expected that the technical design \nwill  be  completed  by  September  2008  and  approved  by  December  2008.  The  ADB-financed \nconsultants\u2019 implementation supervision will be mobilized by December 2008. Pre-qualification of \ncontractors for major civil works will also be undertaken in 2008. Bid documents will be issued in \nJanuary 2009 to pre-qualified contractors and contracts will be awarded in December 2009. The \nmain construction work will begin in January 2010. The preparatory civil works, including access \nroads  to  main  project  sites  and  resettlement  site  preparation,  will  be  undertaken  in  2009  using \nlocal  contractors  financed  by  EVN  and  the  relocation  of  affected  people  will  be  completed  by \n2012.  The  major  civil  works  will  be  completed  by  middle  of  2013,  and  reservoir  filling  will  be \nundertaken from June 2013 to September 2013. Commissioning will be completed by December \n2013. The detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.  \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n44. \nProcurement of works, goods, and services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The  major civil works have been divided into \ntwo  packages  to  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  The \nequipment  component  is  divided  into  two  packages  and  will  also  be  procured  using  ICB \nprocedures.  Small  civil  works  contracts  partly  or  wholly  financed  by  ADB  and  costing  up  to  $3 \nmillion will be procured using national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to ADB \nand  will  be  subject  to  selective  post-review.  ICB  procedures  will  be  used  for  procurement  of \nequipment and goods with a contract price exceeding $1,000,000. NCB procedures will be used \nfor  contracts  less  than  $1,000,000.  Shopping  will  be  authorized  for  procurement  of  goods  and \nequipment with a contract price less than $100,000. The procurement plan26 for the Project is in \nAppendix  5  and  the  National  Competitive  Bidding  procedures  applicable  to  Viet  Nam  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix J.  \n \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n45. \nA  total  of  131  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  1,009  person-months  of \nnational consultants will be required during the implementation of the Project.  These consultants \nwill  be  financed  under  the  loan  and  will  be  recruited  and  engaged  by  EVN  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). There will be \ntwo ADB-financed consulting service contracts as set out below. \n \n\n(i) \n\nImplementation  supervision  will  consist  of  (a)  a  review  of  bid  documents  and  bid \nevaluation, (d) contract negotiation, (c) construction supervision and management, \nincluding  support  for  implementing  the  EMP  during  construction.  The  terms  of \nreference  for  the  construction  supervision  consultants  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  F  and  summarized  in  Appendix  14.  These  services  will  be  obtained \nthrough an international firm of consultants to be recruited using quality and cost-\nbased  selection  (QCBS)  and  will  require  131  person-months  of  international \nconsultants and 949 person-months of national consultants.  \n \nWith respect to national consultancy requirements, the consulting service industry \nin Viet Nam is still in its development stage. There are no private consulting firms \nspecializing  in  hydropower  projects  that  would  be  capable  of  providing  the  large \nand specialized consulting inputs required for the Project. The national consultants \nare  therefore  to  be  recruited  through  engineering  consulting  firms  affiliated  with \nEVN.  These  firms  are  incorporated  as  separate  corporate  entities  with  complete \nfinancial  independence.  EVN\u2019s  role  is  limited  to  that  of  the  majority  shareholder. \nSince  they  were  not  engaged  in  developing  the  terms  of  reference  for  the \nsupervision  consulting  services,  there  will  be  no  conflict  of  interest  in  their \nundertaking  construction  supervision.  Accordingly,  consortia  or  joint  ventures \nconsisting  of  international  consulting  firms  and  EVN-affiliated  consulting  firms  will \nbe considered for the provision of consultancy services. \n \nAn independent monitoring agency will be engaged using fixed budget selection to \nundertake  independent  monitoring  of  the  effectiveness  of  implementing  the \nsafeguard documents (REMDP and EIA/EMP). This will require 60 person-months \nof national consultancy services.   \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n26  The  Borrower  has  submitted  and  ADB  has  approved  the  procurement  plan  for  the  next  18  months.  This  will  be \n\nupdated annually or as necessary. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Action \n\n46. \nThe  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  for  advance  action  to  expedite  the \nrecruitment  of  consultants,  and  procurement  for  civil  works  and  critical  equipment.  ADB \nManagement approved advance procurement and consultant recruitment on 14 September 2006. \nThis  covers  recruitment  of  consultants,  prequalification  of  contractors,  and  tendering  and  bid \nevaluation  of  procurement  packages,  but  does  not  include  the  signing  of  contracts.  The \nGovernment and EVN have been advised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB \nto financing the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n47. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  EVN  and  the  management  board.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB \nin  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine the records and accounts of EVN and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. EVN will maintain a website to disclose information \non procurement details, including the name and contract price of the winning bidder.  \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n48. \nDisbursement  will  be  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe Borrower and ADB. The disbursements for major civil works and equipment supply procured \nthrough ICB and consultancy services procured through firms will be made by direct payment and \ncommitment procedures. Disbursement for civil works contracts awarded through NCB and goods \nprocured  through  shopping  for  resettlement-related  activities  will  be  made  through  an  imprest \naccount to be established soon after the loan effectivity at a bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest \naccount will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed between the Borrower and ADB. The \namount  to  be  maintained  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  10%  of  the  loan  amount  or  the \nprojected expenses for the following 6 months, whichever is less. The statement of expenditures \nprocedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditure  and  liquidate  advances  to  the  imprest \naccount, and records will be maintained to substantiate the payments made through statement of \nexpenditures. Payments under statement of expenditures will be limited to $100,000 per payment.  \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe management board, through EVN, will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB. The \n49. \nreports will provide a narrative of progress made during the period, changes in the implementation \nschedule, problems or difficulties encountered, and work to be carried out in the next period. The \nprogress  reports  will  also  include  a  summary  financial  account  for  the  investment  component, \nconsisting of project expenditures during the period year to date and total expenditure to date. In \naddition  to  the  quarterly  reports,  within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year,  the \nmanagement board through EVN will submit to ADB annual audited accounts of EVN and annual \naudited  financial  statements  of  the  Project.  Annual  project  accounts  will  contain  detailed \ndescriptions  of  the  fund  sources  and  expenditures.  The  imprest  account  and  statement  of \nexpenditures will be audited as part of the annual audit, and an opinion on each will be included in \nthe  annual  audit  statement.  The  annual  audited  financial  statements  of  EVN  will  comprise  an \nincome statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and related notes to financial statements \nand confirmation by auditors of compliance or otherwise with financial covenants included in the \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nLoan Agreement. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the management board \nwill furnish ADB with a project completion report.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n50. \nThe  management  board,  assisted  by  the  implementation  supervision  consultants,  will \nestablish  a  systematic  project  performance  and  monitoring  analysis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProject  Performance  Management  System  Handbook. 27  Baseline  social  economic  data  for \nsubsequent  performance  monitoring  have  been  included  in  the  REMDP.  Project  performance \nmonitoring consists of several layers of supervision. Physical construction of the major civil works \nand  equipment  installation  will  be  supervised  and  monitored  by  the  implementation  supervision \nconsultants. Implementation of environment and social safeguard documents will be monitored by \nthe  independent  monitoring  agency.  The  social  and  monitoring  reports  will  be  disclosed  as \nrequired under ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). ADB review missions will review the \nmonitoring reports to be submitted by independent monitors with regard to implementation of the \nEMP  and  REMDP,  and  remedial  measures  will  be  proposed  for  any  shortcomings.  At  project \ncompletion, a comprehensive social and environment evaluation will be carried out to assess the \neffectiveness of social and environmental mitigation measures of the Project. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n51. \nIn  addition  to  regular  review  missions  by  ADB,  a  comprehensive  midterm  review  will  be \nundertaken  by  ADB  and  the  Government  to  focus  on  the  engineering,  implementation, \nresettlement, and environmental aspects. An evaluation of the likelihood of attaining the Project\u2019s \nimmediate  objectives  will  be  performed,  and  if  necessary,  corrections  introduced  to  ensure \nachievement of objectives.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits  \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Viability \n\n52. \nThe  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects. 28  The  costs  were  derived  from  the  cost \nestimates  in  Appendix  4,  excluding  transfer  payments  such  as  taxes  and  interest  during \nconstruction,  but  including  social  and  environment  mitigation  measures.  It  is  assumed  that \nenvironment and social costs are fully internalized through the inclusion of mitigation costs. The \nenvironmental  benefits  of  the  Project  attributed  to  the  reduction  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions \nbecause  fossil-fuel-based  power  plants  will  be  replaced  have  been  taken  into  account  in  the \neconomic analysis. Economic costs are expressed in constant 2006 prices and costs incurred in \nforeign  currency  are  converted  to  a  domestic  price  numeraire  using  a  shadow  exchange  rate \nfactor29 of 1.1.   \n \nThe  economic  benefits  of  electricity  produced  by  the  Project  have  been  determined  by \n53. \ncomparing  the  with-  and  without-Project  scenarios.  The  without-Project  scenario  would  cause \n(i) suboptimal  operation  of  the  power  system,  resulting  in  a  higher  operating  cost  per  unit  of \nelectricity generated compared with the with-Project scenario; and (ii) load shedding because of \ninadequate  generation  capacity.  The  former  is  considered  the  non-incremental  benefit  of  the \nProject and is valued at the resource cost saving; the latter is considered an incremental benefit \nand  is  valued  at  the  willingness  to  pay  (WTP)  by  consumers.  Detailed  economic  analysis  in \nAppendix 8  shows  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  14.78%  and  net  present  value \n(NPV) of $48.54 million at a discount rate of 12%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the Project \nis economically viable even under combined adverse conditions.  \n\n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2002. Performance Management System Handbook. Manila. \n28  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, Manila. \n29  The ratio between the economic price of foreign currency and the market exchange rate.  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Evaluation \n\n \n\n54. \nFinancial projections for the cash flows attributable to the Project have been prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects30 to assess the financial \nviability of the Project and EVN, its EA. Financial analysis of the Project is in Appendix 10 and the \nfinancial assessment of EVN is in Appendix 9. The financial assessment of EVN shows that EVN \nwill remain a financially viable entity assuming moderate tariff increases of around 5% per annum, \nand will comply with prudential financial ratio covenants of a minimum debt service cover ratio of \n1.5, self-finance ratio of 25%, and debt-equity ratio of 70:30.  \n \n55. \nThe financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2006 \nprices. The project cost estimates and the financial projections in nominal terms were converted \nto  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuations.  The \nelectricity  generated  by  the  Project  was  conservatively  valued  at  $0.044  per  kWh  based  on  the \nprice paid by EVN to independent power producers. The cost estimates in Appendix 4 are used \nfor  the  financial  analysis,  excluding  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction.  The \nfinancial  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  with  is  6.49%.  This  compares \nfavorably with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), also computed on an after-tax basis, \nof  3.46%.  The  Project  is  considered  both  financially  viable  and  sustainable.  Sensitivity  analysis \nindicates the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions. The revenues from the CDM, should they \nbecome available, will further improve the financial viability of the Project to yield a FIRR of 7.60 \n%.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSocial Benefits \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  access  and  improvements  in  communication,  health,  education, \n56. \nand improved livelihood opportunities to an area that has remained isolated and remote from the \nmain economic centers in Viet Nam. The ethnic minority people inhabiting the area will be able to \nbenefit  from  these  opportunities  through  the  provision  of  assistance  to  adapt  to  new  livelihoods \nand social changes while maintaining their traditional lifestyles.  \n\nB. \n\n \nProject Impacts \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\nChange  in  Hydrology  Downstream  of  the  Dam.  The  water  flow  in  the  river  stretch \n57. \nbetween the dam and power station will be almost negligible, and flows downstream of the power \nstation will be significantly affected depending on the operation regime of the power station. If the \npower station is operated as a peaking plant as expected, there will be significant fluctuations in \nthe  water  level,  which  could  be  as  high  as  1.5  m  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  power  station. \nThis fluctuation would diminish further downstream, (20 km from power station) reducing to 0.2 m \nin the vicinity of villages in Dai Loc district.  \n \nIncreased  Access  to  Song  Thanh  Nature  Reserve.  The  reservoir  will  inundate  about \n58. \n143 hectares (ha) of the Song Thanh Nature Reserve, which is less than 0.2% of the area of the \nreserve.  More  importantly,  there  will  be  increased  access  to  the  nature  reserve  through  the \nreservoir  and  the  realigned  highway.  The  capacity  building  for  Song  Thanh  Nature  Reserve \nauthorities and the conservation offset will contribute to preserving biodiversity in the project area, \nspecifically the Song Thanh Nature Reserve.  \n \n59. \nImpacts  on  Aquatic  Ecology  and  Fauna.  The  altered  hydrology  in  the  Bung  river  will \ncause adverse impacts on the aquatic ecology of the river as the diurnal fluctuations in the water \nlevel and the dry sections of the river will affect the biological productivity of the river and reduce \nthe fish populations. The migratory barrier of the Song Bung 4 dam, and later the Song Bung 5 \n\n                                                 \n30  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects, Manila \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\ndam  downstream,  if  constructed,  will  adversely  affect  migratory  fish  that  use  the  river  for \nspawning. The aquatic and faunal species in the Vu Gia river are not considered endangered, and \nimpacts will have insignificant biodiversity implications.  \n\n2. \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n \n\nThe Project will directly affect: four ethnic minority villages (206 households) that will lose \n60. \nboth  residential  and  agricultural  land  in  Zuoih  commune;  52  households  that  will  lose  upland \nfarmland  in  Ta  Bhing  commune  for  the  reservoir  inundation;  over  30  households  that  will  lose \nagricultural  land  in  Ta  Bhing  commune  for  project  construction  lands;  and  1,500\u20132,000 \nhouseholds that engage in fishing in the river in downstream areas in Dai Loc district. Reservoir \ninundation and relocation will entail loss of rice fields, fields for other crops and vegetables, river \nfishery,  associated  social  and  cultural  traits,  and  social  networks.  In  addition,  there  will  be \npotential  negative  social  impacts  in  the  wider  ethnic  minority  community  in  Nam  Giang  district \n(population  of  20,000)  because  of  the  influx  of  over  2,000 construction  workers  during  the \nconstruction  phase  and  the  greater  access  provided  by  the  Project.  People  in  the  downstream \narea could be affected by changes in the water flow and aquatic ecology in the river.  \n \nC. \n\nProject Risks \n\n1. \n\nTechnical Risks of the Project \n\n61. \nThe  Project  will  have  several  types  of  technical  risks,  including  those  related  to  geology \nand  hydrology.  The  design  has  taken  steps  to  avoid  or  minimize  these  risks.  In  general,  the \ndesign  of  the  various  project  components  is  conventional  and  within  accepted  norms  and \npractices.  The  dam  height  is  in  the  midrange  for  this  type  of  dam  (RCC  dams  have  been  built \nhigher  than  190  m),  and  turbines  with  the  proposed  range  of  head  and  discharges  have  been \ninstalled  in  many  other  projects.  The  hydrological  risk  during  construction  is  minimal  as \novertopping of an RCC dam is quite acceptable and construction can proceed once the flood has \npassed.  The  spillway  of  the  Project  is  designed  in  line  with  Vietnamese  standards  to  pass  the \n5,000-year flood of 15,000 cubic meters per second (m3/s) without expected damage. Stability of \nthe dam has been checked for a probable maximum flood event and, although such a flood could \novertop  the  dam  and  cause  extensive  damage  to  ancillary  works,  it  would  not  endanger  the \nstructural  integrity  of  the  dam  itself.  The  geotechnical  risks  at  the  dam  site,  tunnel  and  power \nhouse site are expected to be manageable because geological conditions in the project area are \ngood.  \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Risks  \n\nThe  financial  risks  of  the  Project  relate  to  cost  overruns  caused  by  technical  risks, \n62. \nimplementation  delays,  and  reduction  in  plant  output  caused  by  adverse  hydrological  conditions \nafter commissioning. These are sufficiently factored into the financial analysis and contingencies \nare  provided  in  the  cost  estimates;  the  Project  is  financially  robust  enough  to  withstand  these \nrisks. In addition to the project-specific risks, the overall financial viability of the sector would have \nan impact on the overall success of the Project. With the increasing commercial financing of new \ninvestments,  the  financing  cost  of  the  sector  will  increase  with  the  financial  risk  profile  of  the \nsector, and adequate tariff increases and control over operating costs will be required to maintain \nthe financial risks of the sector at a level acceptable to financers. A further tariff increase of 5% is \nexpected  in  the  second  half  of  2008  in  addition  to  the  6.6%    tariff  increase  approved  in \nJanuary 2007.  With  the  establishment  of  a  competitive  power  market  in  2009,  generation  tariffs \nwill be set by the market and the transmission and distribution tariffs by the regulator. The sector \nis also exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risks because of the currency mismatches \nbetween revenues and liabilities.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19\n \n\n3. \n\nPolicy and Institutional Risks \n\n63. \nViet  Nam  is  embarking  on  an  ambitious  sector  reform  program  aimed  at  establishing  a \ncompetitive  generation  market  by  2010.  This  involves  converting  EVN  into  a  holding  company, \nand  divesting  operating  units  of  EVN  engaged  in  power  generation  and  distribution.  The \nregulation  of  the  sector,  including  soliciting  and  procuring  new  generation  capacity,  will  be  the \nresponsibility  of  ERAV.  One  of  the  major  challenges  and  risks  in  Viet  Nam  is  implementing  this \nreform  program  while  expanding  the  capacity  of  the  power  system  to  meet  the  projected  15% \ndemand growth per year. Providing adequate comfort levels to potential investors in the sector in \nthe context of the incipient power market and evolving regulatory regime\u2014without compromising \nthe flexibility required to operate a competitive market\u2014is a major challenge. ADB TA on power \nmarket  design  (footnote  7)  is  providing  assistance  to  ERAV  to  implement  the  proposed  sector \nreforms.  \n \n\n4. \n\nSocial Risks \n\n64. \nIn  Zuoih  commune,  about  70%  of  the  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line.  The  social \nrisks  of  the  Project  relate  to  failure  to  implement  the  social  safeguard  activities  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies.  Relocation  and  land  acquisition  can  lead  to \nimpoverishment,  and  loss  of  traditional  social and  cultural  identity.  Certain  requirements  of  ADB \nsocial safeguard policies aimed at ensuring the restoration and improvement of the livelihoods of \naffected  people  and  compensation  for  upstream  and  downstream  impacts  exceed  the  current \npractice in Viet Nam. The institutional capacity to implement these measures remains a major risk \nfactor.  The  ability  of  ethnic  minority  communities  to  adapt  to  new  livelihoods  at  the  proposed \nresettlement sites, and competition for natural resources and land with outsiders who may settle \nin the project area because of increased access provided by the Project, have also been identified \nas risk factors. The Project will provide assistance to EVN and the district people\u2019s committee in \nimplementing  social  safeguards  and  will  provide  direct  assistance  to  affected  persons  for \nimproving their livelihoods.  \n \n\n5. \n\nEnvironmental Risks \n\n65. \nThe  main  environment  risks  relate  to  the  effectiveness  of  implementation  of  the  EMP. \nEnsuring  adequate  environment  standards  to  minimize  adverse  impacts  on,  for  example,  water \nquality and soil erosion during the construction phase is the responsibility of the contractors. The \nProject will provide adequate support to supervise the contractors in their compliance with these \nrequirements.  Implementation  of  the  EMP  during  the  operational  phase,  especially  provision  of \nadequate financing for implementing the conservation offset, remains a risk.

Total  power  generation  reached  68,000  GWh  in  2007  corresponding  to  per  capita \ngeneration of 800 kWh/per person. The total installed generation capacity as of the end of 2007 \nwas 12,600 MW; new capacity addition during the period 2002\u20132007 was over 4,800 MW. The \ninstalled  capacity  is  projected  to  exceed  25,000  MW  by  2012  and  50,000  MW  by  2017.  The \npower  sector  in  Viet  Nam  is  dominated  by  the  state-owned  Viet  Nam  Electricity  (EVN).    EVN \nwas formed in June 2006 by converting the vertically integrated former Electricity of Viet Nam \ninto  a  holding  company  structure.  EVN\u2019s  operating  units,  consisting  of  power  plants,  regional \npower distribution companies and power transmission system operator have been converted to \nindependent subsidiaries of EVN.   \n \n2. \nof the following elements. \n \n\nThe power generation subsector in Viet Nam is summarized in Table A2.1 and consists \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nStrategic multipurpose hydropower plants.  These will remain under the sole \nownership of EVN with less than 25% of generation market share.  \nPrivatized  power  plants.    These  are  previously  EVN-owned  power  plants  that \nwere recently partially privatized or in  the process of being privatized and listed \non  the  stock  market.  By  the  end  of  2007,  five  power  plants  with  a  combined \ncapacity  of  approximately  1,500  MW  had  been  privatized;  the  remaining  EVN- \nowned  plants,  except  the  strategic  hydropower  plants,  are  expected  to  be \nprivatized by the end of 2009.  \nIndependent power producers (IPPs). There are two categories of IPPs in Viet \nNam: (a) power plants developed by private investors under the provisions of the \nbuild-own-transfer (BOT) decree; secured with government guarantees and long-\nterm  power  purchase  agreements  (PPAs).  There  are  two  such  projects  in \noperation (Phy My 2.2 and Phu My 3) and several others are under negotiation. \n(b)  Power  plants  developed  by  non  EVN  state-owned  enterprises  and domestic \ninvestors.    These  plants  have  medium  term  PPAs  which  will  expire  at  the \ncommencement of proposed power market.  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A2.1: Capacity Mix of Viet Nam\u2019s Power Sector as of end 2007 \n(megawatt) \n\n \n\nIPP \n \nNon- EVN \n\nUnder BOT \nDecree \n\n \n\nEVN \n4,543 \n1,210 \n2,910 \n476 \n220 \n0 \n9,359 \n\nSOE \nItem \n237 \nHydropower \n225 \nCoal \n500 \nNatural Gas  \n0 \nDiesel oil or furnace oil \n0 \nImport \n0 \nBio Mass \n \n962 \nEVN  =  Viet  Nam  Electricity,  IPP  =  independent  power  producer,  SOE  =  state-owned  enterprise,  BOT  =  build-own-\ntransfer  \nSource: Institute of Energy, Viet Nam. \n \n3. \nThe  transmission  network  consists  of  about  3,250  kilometers  (km)  of  500  kV  double \ncircuit backbone line from north to south, and 220 kV and 110 kV networks connecting the load \n\nTotal \n4,780 \n1,600 \n4,876 \n1,096 \n220 \n24 \n12,596 \n\n1,466 \n \n \n \n1,466 \n\n \n165 \n \n620 \n \n24 \n809 \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ncenters  to  the  backbone  network.  The  ongoing  transmission  augmentation  program  will \ncomplete  the  500  kV  ring  networks  around  Hanoi  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City.  In  the  distribution \nsector,  regional  power  companies  belonging  to  EVN  are  charged  an  internal  transfer  price \n(i.e., bulk power tariffs) at 110 kV level and are responsible for power distribution to end users. \nThe bulk tariffs are set by EVN to enable each power company to achieve a reasonable profit, \nirrespective  of  its  cost  structure.  By  2006,  the  household  electrification  rate  exceeded  91% \ncompared with 73% in 2000 and the transmission and distribution losses have been reduced to \n11% in 2006 compared with 19.3% in 1996. \n \n4. \nDriven  by  rapid  economic  growth,  electricity  demand  will  maintain  the  present  growth \nrate of over 16% per annum until 2010; thereafter, it will fall to an average rate of about 11% per \nannum  by  2015.  However,  per  capita  consumption  in  Viet  Nam  remains  low  compared  to  its \nneighbors. It is projected to reach the present per capita consumption of Thailand in 2015 and \nMalaysia in 2023.1 The projected increase in electricity demand is summarized in Table A2.2. \n\n \n\nTable A2.2: Electricity Demand Projection, 2005\u20132025 \n \n\nItem \nAnnual Demand (TWh) \nGrowth in Demand  \nT&D Losses and Self-Generation \nAnnual Generation (TWh) \nMaximum Demand (MW) \nPer capita consumption (kWh) \n\n2005 \n45.6\n16.1%\n14.7%\n53.6\n9,500\n 549\n\n2010 \n97.1\n11.1%\n13.8%\n112.7\n19,550\n 1,106\n\n2015 \n164.9\n9.3%\n13.2%\n190.0\n32,200\n1,774\n\n2020 \n257.3 \n8.1% \n12.5% \n294.0 \n48,650 \n2,629 \n\n2025 \n381.2\n\n11.7%\n431.6\n71,400\n3,703\n\n   MW = megawatt, T&D = transmission and distribution, TWh = terawatt-hour. \n   Source: Institute of Energy, Viet Nam. \n \n\n1. \n\nThe Government\u2019s Power Sector Strategy  \n\n5. \nThe Government\u2019s policy for the power sector, as enunciated in the Electricity Law that \ncame  into  effect  in  July  2005,  is  to  develop  a  power  market  based  on  the  principles  of \ntransparency  and  competition  to  (i)  achieve  economic  efficiency,  (ii)  attract  investments  from \nboth state and non-state entities to the sector, and (iii) ensure the legitimate rights of consumers \nand  investors  in  the  sector.  The  law  declares  that  the  state  monopoly  in  the  sector  would  be \nlimited  to  power  transmission,  national  load  dispatch,  and  strategically  important  large  power \nplants\u2014leaving  power  distribution  and  non-strategic  power  generation  to  potential  private \ninvestors.  Since  the  enactment  of  the  Electricity  Law,  the  Government  has  demonstrated  its \nstrong commitment to creating a transparent power market and to broadening ownership of the \nsector  by  taking  several  key  initial  steps,  including  the  establishment  of  the  Electricity \nRegulatory  Authority  of  Vietnam  (ERAV),  approving  the  road  map  for  establishing  a  power \nmarket,  approving  the  establishment  of  EVN  based  on  a  holding  company  structure,  and \ninitiating the partial privatization of EVN subsidiaries.  \n \n\na. \n\nRoad Map for Competitive Power Market  \n\n6. \nThe  road  map  for  electricity  market  establishment  and  development  approved  by  the \nPrime Minister in 2006 envisages a phased approach to reforms. During the first phase of the \ndevelopment  of  the  power  market,  (establishment  of  a  competitive  generation  market) \ncompetition  will  be  only  among  the  sellers  (power  plants)  and  a  single  buyer  will  act  as  an \nintermediary  between  the  power  plants  and  distribution  companies.  The  single  buyer  will  sell \nelectricity  to  distribution  companies  and  large  consumers  at  regulated  prices.  The  competitive \ngeneration market is expected to start in 2010. The next phase of power market development, \n\n                                                 \n1   Per capita electricity consumption is 1,854 kilowatt-hour (kWh) for Thailand and 3,125 kWh for Malaysia, compared \n\nwith 549 kWh in Viet Nam. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n27\n\nscheduled  to  start  in  2014,  will  entail  a  wholesale  competitive  market  where  sellers  (power \nplants)  and  buyers  (distributors  and  large  consumers)  will  competitively  transact  in  a  power \npool. The final stage will be retail competition, where retail consumers will be allowed to choose \ntheir supplier.   \n \n7. \nThe ERAV was established within the Ministry of Industry and Trade in October 2005 as \na separate institution. ERAV\u2019s  functions include: (i) issuing and enforcing electricity licenses, (ii) \nadvising the minister on market structure and industry policy, (iii) establishing retail tariff setting \nprinciples  and  mechanisms,  (iv)  proposing  the  market  design  and  developing  the  associated \nregulatory  framework,  (v)  approving  power  purchase  arrangements  of  the  single  buyer,  (vi) \nmonitoring  the  progress  of  implementation  of  new  generation  and  transmission  projects,  and \n(vii) monitoring the operation of the power market. Since its inception, ERAV has been engaged \nin  building  institutional  capacity  to  carry  out  its  regulatory  mandate  and  preparing  regulatory \ninstruments  with  the  assistance  provided  by  donor  agencies.    This  include  the  conceptual \ndesign  of  Competitive  Generation  Market  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  TA  on  power  market \ndesign 2 and the World Bank and other bilateral donors are supporting the   preparation of draft \nelectricity  licenses  and  regulatory  fees,    retail  tariff  and  transmission  pricing  methodologies,  \nsubsidy mechanism for rural electrification, standard power purchase agreements for small and \nmedium-sized  renewable  energy  projects  and  preparing  the  detailed  market  rules  for  the \nproposed competitive generation market.  \n \n\nb. \n\nCorporate Restructuring of EVN  \n\n8. \nThe Government is restructuring the electricity industry with the establishment of EVN as \na  holding  company.  As  part  of  this  process,  in  April  2007,  the  Government  approved  the \n\u201cequitization\u201d  (partial  privatization  with  EVN  holding  more  than  50%  of  share  capital)  plan  for \n2007\u20132009  for  equitizing  most  of  the  operating  units  engaged  in  power  generation  and \ndistribution. All the existing power plants and the nine regional power distribution companies\u2014\nexcept  the  three  multipurpose  hydropower  plants  (Yaly,  Hoa  Binh,  and  Tri  Anh)\u2014will  be \nequitized during 2007\u20132009. The thermal power plant complexes and the hydropower plants are \ngrouped  into  separate  companies  for  the  purpose  of  equitization.  The  four  power  engineering \nconsulting  companies  belonging  to  EVN  have  already  being  privatized  and  the  subsidiary \nengaged in telecom services (EVN Telecom) will also be equitized. Prior to approval of this plan, \ntwo  thermal  power  plants,  a  hydropower  plant,  and  a  provincial  power  distribution  company \nwere  equitized  and  listed  in  stock  market  in  2006.  During  2007,  a  further  nine  subsidiaries, \nincluding three power plants, were equitized through initial public offerings.  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

From  the  intake  structure  on  the  right  bank  of  the  reservoir,  a  single  tunneled \nhydraulic system 3.1 kilometers (km) long conveys water to a surface power house that houses \ntwo  78 megawatt  (MW)  Francis  generating  units.  The  water  is  then  returned  to  the  Bung  river \nalong a 20 meter (m) long tailrace canal.

The  dam  was  designed  to  Vietnamese \nstandards,  and  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultant  confirmed  that \nthe  design  is  conservative  since  the  various  calculated  safety  factors  are  within  the  allowable \nranges. The maximum height is 109.5 m and the crest length is 367 m. The dam is located on \nan  outcrop  of  sandstone  with  inter-bedded  siltstone  in  the  Bung  river,  and  has  a  grout  curtain \nand  drainage  gallery  to  control  seepage  and  seepage  pressure.  The  dam  will  be  monitored \nduring  and  after  construction  for  seepage,  foundation  pore  pressure,  dam  tilt,  opening  of \ninduced cracks, concrete temperature, and earthquake acceleration. \n \n3. \nA gated spillway designed according to Vietnamese standards (1,000-year design flood) \nwill be built into the dam, with five 15 m x 16 m radial gates, a ski-jump chute and a plunge pool. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n29\n\nThe spillway is capable of passing the 5,000-year flood1 without causing damage to the spillway. \nThe stability of the dam was also checked under a probable maximum flood event2.  \n \n4. \nDuring construction, the river will be diverted into a 7 m by 9 m twin box culvert that will \nbe part of the dam body. Upstream and downstream rock-fill cofferdams will divert the water into \nand  out  of  the  box  culverts.  The  diversion  has  been  designed  for  a  10-year  flood,  and  it  is \nexpected that, during the rainy season, the dam under construction could be overtopped. This is \nnot  expected  to  cause  any  damage  to  the  dam  structure  and  this  methodology  has  been \nadopted in construction of other RCC dams around the world. Extreme floods normally last for \nless than 1 week in the wet season from September to December. \n \nC. \n\nIntake Structure  \n\n5. \nThe  intake  will  be  founded  on  rock,  with  adequate  strength  on  the  right  bank  of  the \nreservoir about 100 m upstream of the dam. The intake structure will be 50 m high and cast in \nconcrete.  It  will  be  provided  with  two  trash  rack  bays  and  one  intake  gate  designed  for \n172.7 cubic meters per second (m3/s). \n \nD. \n\nPower Tunnels \n\nThe power tunnels consist of the following: (i) a concrete-lined head race tunnel, 6.8 m in \n6. \ndiameter and 3,046 m long; (ii) a concrete-lined variable diameter surge shaft about 75 m high, \nof which 21.5 m is above ground; (iii) a 270 m long concrete-embedded steel penstock with a \ndiameter of 5.2 m; and (iv) a bifurcation with a diameter of 3.4 m at the end of the steel lining, \nbranching  to  each  generating  unit  at  the  power  station.  The  rock  cover  along  the  head  race \ntunnel will range from 60 m to 430 m. Access to the underground works during construction will \nbe through three adits. The tunnels are designed to be built by drill and blast excavation, with \nprimary  support  of  rock  bolts,  shotcrete, 3  and  mesh;  and  permanent  support  of  reinforced \nconcrete.  This  is  the  conventional  approach  used  in  Viet  Nam  for  similar  projects  and  is \nconsidered  conservative  at  an  international  level.  The  linings  are  grouted  to  fill  any  voids  and \nfissures on the rock contact. The surge shaft is provided to regulate pressure transients during \nrapid  changes  in  station  load,  which  may  results  in  increase  in  the  gross  head  by  19.5  m  or \n15%. \n \n7. \nThe  surface-accessed  \u201cpit\u201d  power  house,  comprising  a  superstructure  and  a \nsubstructure,  is  provided  to  contain  the  two  vertical-axis  Francis  generating  units.  The \nsuperstructure provides protective housing for the generators and control equipment, as well as \nstructural  support  for  the  main  crane  of  the  machine  hall.  The  superstructure  is  extended  and \nprovides for an erection bay that protects component assemblies during inclement weather. The \nsubstructure, or foundation of the power house, consists of concrete necessary to form the draft \ntube, support the turbine stay ring and generator, and encase the spiral case of the turbines. A \nseparate control building housing workshops, offices, and comfort facilities for the operators is \nplanned adjacent to the power house. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   The Song Bung 4 Hydropower management board has checked the design of the dam to withstand a 5,000-year \nflood. Based on existing hydrological data and probability modeling, this means the maximum flood level that would \non average be exceeded once in every 5,000 years.  \n\n2 The Probable maximum Flood is the maximum flood that is statistically probable.  Under this event, overtopping of \n\nthe dam is allowed, without causing structural damage to the dam.  \n\n3   Shotcrete  is  mortar  or  concrete  conveyed  through  a  hose  and  pneumatically  projected  at  high  velocity  onto  a \n\nsurface. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nItem \n\nA. \n\nInvestment Costs \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.

The \naverage gross domestic product (GDP) growth exceeded 7.5% per annum for the period 2000\u2013\n2007) with 2007 growth rate reaching 8.5%; industry is projected to grow at 11% per annum and \nservices at 8% per annum.  \n \n2. \nViet Nam sustained high growth of 13.5% during 2002\u20132007. Within the short term (e.g., \nup  to  5  years),  electricity  demand  projections  were  estimated  based  on  the  so-called  direct \nmethod. This direct estimation is based on surveys of all registered new demand of committed \nor planned expansion or newly created industrial and economic zones together with major urban \ncenters,  collected  on  a  province-by-province  basis.  In  the  longer  term  (i.e.,  10  years  and \nbeyond), provincial economic development plans are less definitive, and econometric methods \nused  for  demand  forecast  take  into  consideration  the  correlation  between  electricity  demand \ngrowth  and  sectoral  growth  rates  and  historical  trends.  Table  A8.1  contains  the  main \nparameters of the demand projection.  \n \n\nTable A8.1: Main Indicators of Demand Forecast, 2005\u20132025 \n\n45.6 \n\n2010 \n\n2005 \n\nItem \nAnnual demand (TWh) \n5-year growth rate (%),  \n    next 5 years \n16.3 \nPer capita consumption (kWh) \n549 \nT&D losses and own use (%) \n14.7 \n9,500 \nPeak load (MW) \n  kWh = kilowatt-hour, MW = megawatt, T&D = transmission and distribution, TWh = terawatt-hour. \n  Source: Institute of Energy. 2005.

The  master  plan \nnormally  includes  a  demand  forecast,  a  least-cost  expansion  plan,  a  transmission  expansion \nplan,  a  fuel  supply  assessment,  a  rural  electrification  program,  an  investment  requirement, \nregional  interconnection  and  power  trade  with  neighboring  countries,  and  environmental  and \nsocial externalities of power system development.  \n \n4. \nThe  technical  potential  for  hydropower  in  Viet  Nam  is  estimated  at  308 terawatt-hours \n(TWh)/year  with  a  capacity  of  70,000  megawatts  (MW),  while  the  economic  potential  is \nestimated  at  120 TWh/year  and  a  capacity  of  30,000  MW.  Taking  into  account  the \nenvironmental  and  social  criteria,  the  feasible  hydropower  potential  is  estimated  to  be \n20,750 MW and 83 TWh/year. The domestic fossil fuel resources suitable for power generation \nare coal in the north and gas in the south. The expansion plan considered importing coal (from \nIndonesia  and  Australia)  for  producing  electricity  from  2015.  Nuclear  energy  will  also  be  a \npossible candidate for meeting high electricity demand after 2018. Table A8.2 summarizes the \nprojection of supply of hydrocarbon fuel in Viet Nam and the corresponding total demand of the \ncountry. \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n37 \n\nTable A8.2: Domestic Production and Demand of Hydrocarbon Fuel Toward 2025 \n\nFuel Type \n\n \n\nSupply \n\nCoal  \n  (million tons)  Demand \nOil \n  (million tons)  Demand \nSupply  \nGas \n  (billion m3) \nDemand \n\nSupply \n\n2005 \n29.20 \n13.62 \n17.80 \n11.00 \n6.50 \n4.50 \n\n2010 \n32.91 \n22.41 \n20.36 \n18.29 \n8.52 \n8.31 \n\n2015 \n41.42 \n33.93 \n19.34 \n29.97 \n13.96 \n14.46 \n\n2020 \n60.75 \n62.95 \n19.48 \n44.56 \n14.39 \n14.91 \n\n2025 \n64.54 \n100.13 \n18.62 \n54.60 \n16.20 \n16.34 \n\n            m3 = cubic meter. \n         Source:  Institute of Energy, Viet Nam. \n \n5. \nThe  planning  exercise  is  based  on  the  set  of  candidate  plants  and  takes  into \nconsideration  constraints  that  reflect  the  fuel  availability  and  system  reliability  criteria  (e.g., \npower  plant  outage,  maintenance  requirements,  and  transmission  line  reliability).  System \noptimization  was  carried  out  using  STRATEGIST  software  to  meet  the  forecasted  demand  for \nelectricity,  which  includes  the  potential  savings  from  ongoing  demand  side  management  and \nenergy  efficiency  programs.    The  optimum  generation  expansion  plan  resulting  in  the  lowest \ntotal discounted system costs was determined using an optimization alogritham, after taking into \naccount transmission system constraints on interchange between regions.  \n \n6.      The  optimal  generation  expansion  plan  is  a  combination  of  all  types  of  generating \ncapacities,  reflecting  the  resource  base  of  the  country.  Hydropower  will  continue  to  be \ndeveloped  as  Viet Nam\u2019s  present  installed  hydropower  capacity  is  about  25%  of  the  feasible \nhydropower  potential  of  20,000  MW.  Thermal  power,  such  as  gas-  and  coal-based  power  will \nalso  have  their  share  in  the  generation  mix.  The  contribution  of  renewable  sources  to  the \nsystem will become more significant and the contribution from small and mini hydropower and \nwind  will  increased  over  the  next  10  years.  By  2011,  renewable  capacity  will  reach  only  100 \nMW, but it will quickly increase to 500 MW in 2015 and to about 1,000 MW in 2025. \n  \nC. \n\nEconomic Valuation of Costs and Benefits of Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project \n\nAccording  to  the  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects 1  of  the  Asian \n6. \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the economic viability of the Project was examined by comparing the \ntwo  scenarios:  with-  and  without-Project.  The  comparison  takes  into  account  the  costs  and \nbenefits to society in these scenarios. The basis of comparison is that both scenarios face the \nsame projected electricity demand.  \n \n\n1. \n\nCosts \n\n7. \nThe costs to society are the investment and operating costs of the Project and the costs \nof environmental and social mitigations. In this analysis, the domestic price numeraire is used \nand  the  costs  expressed  in  border  prices  are  multiplied  by  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor \n(footnote 27) equal to 1.1 in the case of Viet Nam.  \n \n\n2. \n\nBenefits \n\n8. \nTo  compare  the  system  behavior  in  the  with-  and  without-Project  scenarios,  the \nSTRATEGIST power planning tool was used. The optimal expansion plan was simulated, which \ncorresponds  to  the  with-Project  scenario  and  annual  output  from  each  plant  in  the  optimum \nsystem,  power transfer among regions, and system loss of load expectation are calculated. The \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nwithout-Project  scenario  is  simulated  by  taking  the  Project  from  the  optimum  system  while \nkeeping  other  generation  sources  unchanged.  Since  the  production  of  hydropower  stations  is \ndependent on water availability, their output is kept the same as in the with-Project case and the \ndeficit caused by withdrawal of the Project is assumed to be met by increased production from \nthermal plants. The electricity demand that can not be met by increased production of thermal \npower plants is considered \u201cunserved energy\u201d.  \n \n9. \nIn this analysis, the economic value of electricity generated by the Project is measured \nby the costs to society of not having it. This cost comprises the incremental costs of suboptimal \noperation  of  thermal  power  plants  to  partly  replace  the  Project  and  the  costs  to  consumers \n(industrial, residential, commercial) because of unserved electricity. In other words, the benefits \nof  having  the  Project  are  the  sum  of  two  components:  the  non-incremental  benefits  (the \ndifference in operating the power system in a suboptimal manner in the without-Project scenario \ncompared  with  the  with-Project  scenario)  and  the  incremental  benefits  equal  to  the  cost  of \nunserved energy in the without-Project case.  \n \n\na. \n\nNon-Incremental Benefits \n\n10. \nThe extra amounts of thermal production in the northern and southern regions vary year \nby year as shown in Table A8.3. The extra production by power plants in central and northern \nregions  is  coal-based;  in  the  south,  it  is  based  on  gas  and/or  furnace  oil.  The  corresponding \naverage  costs  are  $0.0474  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  for  coal  and  $0.0528/kWh  for  gas.  These \nproduction  costs  are  used  to  value  the  non-incremental  benefits  of  the  Project  in  terms  of \nincreased costs of increased output of thermal power plants in the without-Project scenario.  \n\n \nTable A8.3: Increased Production of Thermal Power Plants  \nto Offset Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project \n(GWh) \n\nYear \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n\nBy Coal \n251.63 \n169.00 \n151.24 \n54.84 \n81.32 \n78.88 \n73.83 \n77.54 \n76.57 \n218.91 \n104.56 \n189.99 \n77.54 \n67.35 \n\nBy Gas/Oil \n183.73 \n259.71 \n263.36 \n311.78 \n292.92 \n269.39 \n253.03 \n209.49 \n187.49 \n52.72 \n174.61 \n67.17 \n180.29 \n128.35 \n\nTotal \n435.36 \n428.71 \n414.60 \n366.63 \n374.24 \n348.27 \n326.86 \n287.04 \n264.06 \n271.62 \n279.17 \n257.17 \n257.84 \n195.70 \n\n \n\n \n\nGWh = gigawatt-hour. \nSource:  Institute of Energy, Viet Nam. \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nIncremental Benefits \n\n11. \nAs  thermal  power  plants  cannot  completely  meet  the  shortage  of  electricity  in  the \nwithout-Project  scenario,  end  users  will  experience  demand  curtailment.  The  cost  of  this \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndemand curtailment represents the incremental benefits of having the Project. The shortage of \nelectricity  supply  caused  by  the  without-Project  scenario  produces  different  costs  for  different \nconsumer categories. The household consumer electricity demand function is assumed to be of \nthe natural logarithm function:2 \n \n\nln(Q) = a + b*P \n\n \n\n(Equation. 4.1) \n\nwhere: \nQ is the electricity consumption level of an individual household \nP is the corresponding price of electricity \na and b are the coefficients specific to a given situation \n\n \n12.  With  such  a  demand  function,  the  loss  of  consumer  welfare  because  of  a  reduction  of \nconsumption from level Q1 to level Q2 (Q2 < Q1) is measured by: \n \n\nHH_loss =  \u222b\n\nPdq  \n\n \n\nQ\n1\n\nQ\n2\n\nafter integrating over the Q2 \u2013 Q1 range: \n\n(Equation. 4.2) \n\nHH_loss = Q1 * (P1-1/b) \u2013 Q2 *(P2-1/b) \n\n(Equation. 4.3) \n\n \n\n \n\n \nwhere:  \nP1 is the tariff \nQ1 is the consumption at P1  \nQ2 is the consumption after demand curtailment \nP2  is the willingness to pay for electricity while consuming at curtailed demand of Q2  \n(P2 > P1 )  \n\nFor small changes in consumption level, it can be assumed that P1 ~ P2 and the above equation \ncan be simplified to: \n\nHH_loss = (Q1 \u2013 Q2) * (P1-1/b) \n\n(Equation. 4.4) \n\n13. \nThe  equation  for  benefits  calculation  presented  above  is  applicable  for  an  individual \nhousehold.  Based  on  population  growth  rate  of  1.12  %  per  annum  (decreasing  over  time  to  \n1.09%  per  annum)  and  average  household  size  decreasing  from  4.5  to  3.8,  it  is  possible  to \nestimate  the  number  of  households  in  Viet  Nam  for  the  whole  study  period.  Using  data  from \nprevious  sources,3 values  of  coefficients  a  and  b  of  the  demand  function  are  estimated  for  a \ntypical household in Viet Nam.  However, in the case of commercial and industrial consumers, it \nis likely that they will resort to captive power generation using diesel generators in the event of \ndemand curtailment. The cost to industrial and commercial consumers is the cost of alternative \ngeneration.  The  most  popular  replacement  for  grid  electricity  is  the  stand-alone  diesel \ngenerator,  with  capacity  from  150  kW  to  5  MW.  The  average  cost  of  diesel  generation  is \n$0.1445/kWh.  \n \n14. \nThe  environmental  benefits  of  the  Project  attributed  to  reductions  in  greenhouse  gas \nemissions because of the replacement of fossil-fuel-based power plants are taken into account \n\n                                                 \n2  Choynowski, P. 2002.

The  carbon  emissions  due  to  the  Project  have  been  estimated  as \n217,879 per year using based on a carbon emission factor of 534.5 tCO2 per GWh for the Viet \nNam power grid computed using the approved  methodology ACM0002 version 7 of the Clean \nDevelopment  Mechanism  Executive  Board.    The  economic  benefits  due  to  the  reduction  in \ncarbon  emissions  is  assumed  to  be  equal  to  the  projected  revenues  from  the  sale  of  carbon \nemission reductions (CER) at a price of $10 / CER ton. \n \n \nTable A8.4 summarizes the results of the benefit calculation. The total economic benefits \n15. \nof  the  Project  are  the  sum  of  the  avoided  costs  of  operating  thermal  power  plants  in  a  sub-\noptimum manner and the avoided costs to the industrial and commercial consumers who have \nto  use  a  more  expensive  source  of  electricity  (diesel  generators),  the  avoided  welfare  loss  of \nthe \nhousehold  consumers  who  have \nenvironmental  benefits  valued  at  CER  revenues.  The  net  benefits  have  been  computed  by \nsubtracting the capital cost and the operating cost valued at domestic prices. The resultant net \npresent value (NPV) of the benefits amounts to $48.54 million (at a 12% discount rate) and the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 14.78%. \n \n\ntheir  consumption \n\ninvoluntarily,  and \n\nto  reduce \n\nTable A8.4: Economic Benefits of Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project  \n($ million) \n\nYear \n\n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n\nBenefits to \nHousehold \nConsumers \n2.90 \n3.19 \n3.87 \n6.33 \n6.02 \n7.31 \n8.44 \n10.44 \n11.62 \n11.23 \n10.82 \n11.97 \n11.94 \n15.10 \n\nBenefits to \nIndustrial \nConsumers \n3.28 \n3.60 \n4.37 \n7.15 \n6.80 \n8.26 \n9.54 \n11.80 \n13.13 \n12.69 \n12.22 \n13.52 \n13.49 \n17.06 \n\nBenefits to \nCommercial \nConsumers \n1.64 \n1.80 \n2.18 \n3.58 \n3.40 \n4.13 \n4.77 \n5.90 \n6.56 \n6.34 \n6.11 \n6.76 \n6.74 \n8.53 \n\nTotal Benefits \n31.65 \n32.53 \n33.70 \n38.33 \n37.75 \n39.86 \n41.81 \n45.09 \n47.05 \n45.63 \n45.54 \n47.02 \n47.57 \n52.87 \n\n \n \nEnvironment \nBenefits \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n2.21 \n\nAvoided \nCosts of \nThermal \nPower \n21.63 \n21.72 \n21.07 \n19.06 \n19.32 \n17.96 \n16.86 \n14.74 \n13.53 \n13.16 \n14.18 \n12.55 \n13.19 \n9.97 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n16. \nThe  risk  analysis  of  NPV  and  EIRR  with  respect  to  main  input  parameters  has  been \nanalyzed by using the @RISK Software program. The main input parameters subjected to risk \nanalysis include the energy output of the Project; the capital investment costs; and the values \nthat  household,  industrial,  and  commercial  consumers  attach  to  the  unserved  electricity.  The \ntotal project cost is the key variable, so the variation of the project cost was examined in relation \nto its components.  The variation of cost components was simulated to determine the probability \ndistribution of the Project cost. The electricity output of the Project (within a range of 20%) and \nwillingness  to  pay  for  both  household  and  non-household  consumers  (within  a  range  of  10%) \nwas simulated to determine the probability distribution of the Project economic benefits and the \nEIRR  and  NPV  of  the  Project  at  a  discount  rate  of  12%.  The  results  of  the  simulation  are \nsummarized in Table A8.5. \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n41 \n\nTable A8.5: Risk Analysis of NPV and EIRR Relative to Key Input Parameters \n \n\n \n\nLow \n\nBase \n\nHigh \n\nParameter \nCapital ($million) \nGeneration (GWh) \nHousehold WTP ($/kWh) \nNon-Household WTP ($/kWh) \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n57.21  \n74.73  \n52.46  \n65.91  \n\n221.94 \n491 \n\n0.141\n0.16 \n\n0.128\n0.145\n\n0.1 \n0.11 \n\n266 \n589 \n\n200 \n393 \n\n12.33% 15.43%\n13.29% 16.24%\n14.56% 14.98%\n14.67% 15.64%\n\nHigh \n($ million) \n\nNPV ($48.54 m) \nLow  \n($ million) \n6.99 \n22.34 \n44.28 \n46.28 \n\nEIRR (14.78%) \n\nLow \n\nHigh \n\n19. \nThe analysis showed that the project economics (EIRR and NPV) are most sensitive to \nthe  project  cost  (relative  sensitivity  index  =  0.77),4 followed  by  generation  output  (0.54).

In 2006, the Government had decided to convert \nEVN  into  a  holding  company;  most  of  its  operating  entities  have  been  converted  to  limited \nliability (i.e., joint stock) companies, with EVN retaining whole or partial ownership and most of \nthe operating subsidiaries are expected to be partially privatized by the end of 2009.  At present \nseveral  subsidiaries  engaged  in  power  generation  and  power  engineering  consultancy  are \npartially privatized.    \n\nSince its creation in 1995, as a vertically integrated entity responsible for the electricity \n2. \nsector in Viet Nam, EVN\u2019s operations have been profitable. It has financed the rapid expansion \nof  Viet  Nam\u2019s  electricity  sector  without  resorting  to  significant  fiscal  subsidies.  Key  financial \nperformance  indicators  such  as  the  debt  service  coverage  ratio,  the  self-financing  ratio,  and \nreceivables  have  been  maintained  at  prudential  limits.  The  average  end  user  tariff  has  been \nmaintained  at  around  $0.053  /kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  since  January  2007.  However,  to  satisfy \nfuture  demand  for  electricity  resulting  from  rapid  economic  growth,  EVN  will  need  to  make \nconsiderable investments in generation, transmission, and distribution. A substantial portion of \nthese investments will be debt financed, and sustained tariff increases are required to maintain \nadequate levels of debt service cover and self-financing of these new investments. The financial \nperformance  of  EVN  from  2000\u20132006  and  the  financial  projections  from  2007\u20132011  are \nsummarized in the Tables A 9.1, A 9.2, and A 9.3.   \n\nB. \n\nHistorical Performance \n\n3. \nIn  recent  loans  approved  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  World  Bank, \nthe  banks  and  the  Government  have  agreed  to  adopt  new  financial  covenants  based  on: \n(i) consolidated  EVN  financial  statements,  and  (ii)  EVN\u2019s  overall  financial  viability  and \nperformance  rather  than  arbitrary  tariff  levels  set  in  foreign  currencies.  These  covenants  were \nintroduced  in  the  loan  for  the  Northern  Power  Transmission  Sector  Project 1  in  2004  and  \nmaintained in loans for the Northern Power Transmission Expansion Sector Project  and Mong \nDuong 1 Thermal Power Project.2 The covenants are (i) a self-financing ratio of 25%, (ii) a debt \nservice  cover  ratio  of  1.5,  and  (iii)  a  debt-equity  ratio  of  70:30.  EVN  has  complied  with  these \ncovenants  during  2000\u20132006.    However,  there  has  been  a  reduction  in  its  net  cash  flow  and \noperating profits because of the absence of tariff increases during 2003\u20132006. This has reduced \nthe self-financing ratio to 34% in 2006 from 77% in 2003, and the debt service ratio from 8.49 in \n2003 to 2.77 in 2006. This is expected to be reversed with the tariff increase of 6.6% effective \nJanuary  2007  and  5.0%  effective  July  2008.  The  retail  tariffs  beyond  2010  will  be  adjusted  to \nreflect market prices in the competitive generation market to be set up in 2010.  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2004.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of \nDirectors on a Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power Project. \nManila (Loan 2353\u2013VIE approved in September). \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n43 \n\n1. \n\nSales and Income \n\n4. \nEVN\u2019s electricity sales have grown by three times from 1998 to 2006, (from 17.7 TWh to \n51.3  TWh)  representing  an  annual  growth  rate  of  14.2%.  Although  the  average  tariffs  net  of \nsales taxes have increased only marginally from D660/kWh ($0.046/kWh) in 2000 to D853/kWh \n($0.053/kWh)  by  2006,  revenue  has  increased  from  D16.8  trillion  ($1.16  billion) 3in  2000  to \nD44.9  trillion  ($2,807  million)  in  2006.    The  largest  growth  in  electricity  sales  has  been  in  the \nindustrial sector where average annual growth was 17%\u201418%, with the result that the industrial \nsector share in total sales increased from 40% in 2000 to 45% in 2006. The household sector \nhas also shown annual growth of 12% per annum over the last 12 years. This is because of a \nmixture  of  increasing  demand  by  existing  customers  and  additional  demand  from  new \nconnections as more households are connected to the electricity supply system.   \n\n2.  \n\nProduction and Supply \n\n5. \nIn  2006,  EVN  produced  46.5 terawatt-hours  (TWh)  from  its  own  power  stations  and \npurchased a further 12.5 TWh from independent power producers (IPPs). The largest source of \npower  was  hydropower  (33%),  followed  by  natural  gas  (30%),  coal  (15%),  and  oil  (1%).  IPPs \n(including  imports)  account  for  21%  of  total  supply.  However,  electricity  from  hydropower  has \ndeclined by 7% because of adverse hydrological conditions, and the resulting deficit has been \nmade  up  primarily  from  oil-fired  power  stations  and  by  an  increase  in  power  purchases  from \nIPPs. Given that gas-fired power plants are in the south and most of hydropower plants are in \nnorth,  the  power  transmission  from  the  south  to  north  is  constrained  by  limitations  on \ntransmission capacity, resulting in localized load shedding in the North Viet Nam during the dry \nseason. \n\n3. \n\nOperating Costs \n\nDepreciation is one of the largest operating costs for EVN, accounting for over 30% of its \n6. \noperating  costs.  Under  the  Vietnamese  accounting  system,  depreciation  periods  are  generally \nshorter  than  those  allowed  under  International  Accounting  Standards.  As  a  result,  levels  of \ndepreciation are relatively high. However, the high depreciation provision provides higher cash \nflows  for  financing  capital  expenses  and  improves  the  self-financing  ratio.  Other  major  cost \nitems are the fuel cost for thermal power stations and the purchase cost of electricity from IPPs. \nEVN uses lower calorific value (4,000\u20135,500 kilocalories per kilogram) domestic anthracite coal \nfor  power  generation.  The  higher  quality  anthracite  coal  is  exported  as  coking  coal.  The  price \nEVN pays for this type of coal varies from $24/ton to $28/ton and is administratively fixed at a \ndiscount to the export prices. Gas prices are in US dollars, based on agreed volume and long-\nterm  contracts.  EVN  receives  no  direct  operating  subsidies  from  the  Government  to  cover  its \noperating  costs.  However,  the  Government  injects  additional  capital  to  help  finance  specific \ninvestments such as 2,400 MW Son La Hydropower Project and access to lower interest loans \nfrom state-owned banks.  \n\n4. \n\nCapital Expenditure \n\n7. \nDuring 2000\u20132006, EVN invested over D102.4 trillion ($6.4 billion) in new capital work. \nApproximately  45%  of  this  expenditure  has  been  financed  by  taking  out  additional  long-term \nloans, and the remainder has been financed from its own resources (50%) and capital injections \n\n                                                 \n3   Exchange rate D14,480 per $1 is used for the year 2000.  \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nby the Government (5%). Total outstanding long-term loans have increased to over 68.7 trillion \n($4.3 billion) by 2006 compared with D26.9 trillion ($ 1.85 billion)  in 2000. \n\nC.  \n\nFinancial Projections, 2007\u20132011  \n\n1.  \n\nSales and Revenue  \n\n8. \nAlthough  the  corporate  structure  of  EVN  is  envisaged  to  change  under  the  proposed \npower sector reforms, it is likely to remain a holding company owning significant stakes of the \npower  sector.  It  is  assumed  that  the  consolidated  electricity  sales  would  reach  97.1 TWh  in \n2010  compared  with  51.3  TWh  in  2006,  with  an  annual  growth  rate  of  16%  during  the  period \n2006\u20132011.  Electricity  sales  by  each  regional  distribution  company  have  been  projected  by \ndifferent  consumer  category  and  consolidated  to  derive  the  total  sales  and  the  projected \nrevenues. The revenue projections are based on tariff assumptions prepared by EVN to ensure \ncompliance with the various loan covenants. The tariff increase of 6.6% to an average tariff level \nof D853/kWh ($0.053/kWh) effective from 1 January 2007 and 5.0% effective from the middle of \n2008 are assumed in the projections.  \n\n2. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nThe  operating  expenses  of  EVN  largely  depend  on  the  plant  mix  used  for  meeting  the \n9. \nforecasted demand and the fuel price projections. The plant mix for 2006\u20132011 is based on the \neconomic merit order dispatch subject to the hydrological and transmission constraints, and the \ncontractual commitments with regard to independent power producers. The system losses are \nto be reduced from their current level of 12.6% to about 10.9% by 2011. It is also expected that \nby 2011 EVN would purchase 33.6 TWh from third parties (i.e., private power producers, joint \nventure  companies,  and  imports)  out  of  the  total  generation  of  125.0  TWh  compared  with \n12.5 TWh purchased from IPPs in 2006.  \n\n10. \nFuel  consumption  is  based  on  the  projected  plant  mix  and  the  fuel  expenses  were \nderived based on the expected fuel prices in Viet Nam\u2019s domestic fuel prices. The coal prices \nare kept at around $24\u2013$28 per ton during 2006\u20132011. Although these prices are less than the \nprevalent international coal prices, the quality of the coal used by EVN is of lower quality and is \nnot directly comparable with international prices for good quality coal.  However, the fuel costs \nare  expected  to  increase  from  2012  when  Viet  Nam  starts  using  imported  coal  for  power \ngeneration. The gas prices are based on production share agreements signed with international \ngas field developers.  \n\n3. \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nThe  cumulative  capital  investments  to  be  made  by  EVN  during  the  2006\u20132011  period \n11. \namount to D219 trillion ($13.7 billion) compared with D81.5 trillion ( $ 5.6 billion) incurred during \n2000\u20132005. The debt service commitment during 2006\u20132011 will also increase to D78 trillion ($ \n4.9 billion) compared with D20 trillion ( $ 1.4 billion)  in the previous 6-year period. In addition to \ndirect investments, EVN is planning to form joint venture companies to implement some power \ngeneration  projects  in  2006\u20132011.  The  direct  investments  by  EVN  and  EVN  investments \nthrough  joint  ventures  in  power  generation  will  be  complemented  by  investments  by  non-EVN \nentities, including the private sector, in new IPP plants. \n\n12. \nAlthough EVN\u2019s internal cash generation is projected to reach D134 trillion ($8.4 billion) \nduring  2006\u20132011,  the  significant  portion  of  the  investments  would  be  financed  by  new \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n45 \n\nborrowings  amounting  to  D154.7  trillion  ($9.7  billion).  This  indicates  significantly  increased \nlevels  of  borrowings  compared  with  the  2000\u20132005  period  when  EVN\u2019s  net  borrowings \namounted to only D48 trillion. In the absence of significant equity injections, this investment plan \nwill substantially increase EVN\u2019s debt and its debt service requirements. The debt to equity ratio \nwould increase to 65:35 in 2011 from 57:43 in 2006 and the debt service requirements in 2011 \nwould be D21 trillion ($ 1.3 billion) compared with D4.8 trillion ( $ 300 million) in 2006, resulting \nin the debt service coverage ratio dropping to 2.13 by 2011. This trend reflects EVN\u2019s transition \nfrom a lightly geared utility, because of lack of access to debt financing prior to 1995, to a more \ntypical utility in a fast-growing economy. \n\nD. \n\nFuture Developments \n\nEVN  is  moving  away  from  its  traditional  role  of  generating  its  own  electricity  to \n13. \npurchasing  a  considerable  amount  of  electricity  from  third  parties,  and  then  transmitting  and \ndistributing  it  to  end  users.  There  is  a  strong  case  for  splitting  EVN  into  a  number  of \nindependent entities\u2014such as transmission, distribution companies, power stations (where the \nstate\u2019s  shares  in  these  entities  are  held  by  a  holding  company)\u2014as  a  way  of  increasing \ntransparency  in  the  functioning  of  the  electricity  market.  The  Government  has  approved  the \n\u201cequitization\u201d  (partial  privatization  with  EVN  holding  more  than  50%  of  share  capital)  of  most \npower  generation  plants  and  regional  power  companies.  As  of  December  2007,  three  power \nplants  have  been  equitized,  including  a  1,000 megawatt  (MW)  coal  power  plant,  a  provincial \npower  distribution  utility,  and  17  non-core  businesses.  The  liabilities  associated  with  the \nequitized entities are transferred to the equitized entity and the par value is computed net of the \nliabilities. The cash proceeds from the equitization will improve EVN\u2019s cash flow. However, the \ndebt-equity ratio of EVN as a consolidated entity will not be affected as EVN intends to hold a \nmajority stake in the equitized entities.  \n\nE. \n\nProposed Covenants \n\n14. \nBecause  of  the  delay  in  approving  the  tariff  increase,  the  lower  than  expected  tariff \nincrease,  and  increasing  capital  investment,  EVN\u2019s  self-financing  ratio  is  likely  to  be  between \n25% and 30% during 2007 and 2008. Given EVN\u2019s increasing indebtedness, a maximum long-\nterm debt to equity ratio of 70:30 and minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 are proposed \nas  financial  covenants  to  ensure  EVN\u2019s  debt  level  and  debt  service  capacity  remain  within \nprudential limits. Although the debt to equity position is steadily increasing and the debt service \ncoverage  ratio  is  decreasing,  they  remain  within  these  limits  during  the  forecast  period.  A \nminimum  self-financing  ratio  of  25%  is  imposed  to  ensure  that  EVN  generates  adequate  cash \nflows  to  finance  a  reasonable  portion  of  the  capital  investments  to  retain  the  company's \nleverage  within  prudential  limits.  EVN  has  complied  with  these  covenants  from  2004  to  2006. \nWhether EVN will comply with loan covenants in future years depends to a large extent on the \nfuture tariff increases and fuel price fluctuations.  \n\nF. \n\nFinancial Management Assessment of EVN and the Management Board  \n\n1. \n\nStaffing, Accounting Policies, Budgeting System, and Payments  \n\n15. \nThe  proposed  project  will  be  implemented  by  Song  Bung  4  Hydropower  management \nboard (the management board), a newly created project management board of EVN responsible \nfor implementing the Project.  The management board currently has about 45 employees, with \nspecialists  in  engineering,  environmental,  resettlement,  economics,  and  finance.  The  finance \ndepartment has four staff.  EVN and the management board are required by the Government to \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\ncomply  with  Vietnamese  accounting  standards.  Accordingly,  EVN  has  adopted,  for  all  its \nbusiness  units,  uniform  accounting policies  and  procedures  for  documentation  of  transactions. \nThe  consolidation  of  accounts  takes  place  at  the  EVN  head  office  and  consolidated  accounts \nare later converted to International Accounting Standards.  \n\n16. \nEVN  and  the  management  board  have  experience  in  the  efficient  management, \nbudgeting,  and  disbursement  of  funds  in  previous  projects  as  the  management  board  was \ncreated  by  splitting  former  the  Hydro  Power  Project  Management  Board  No.  3  which  had \nmanaged several projects, including the proposed Project, until December 2007. The Project\u2019s \nbudget  estimates  will  be  prepared  in  sufficient  detail  for  all  significant  activities  under  each \nproject component. Actual expenditures will be compared with the budget at least on a quarterly \nbasis,  and  explanations  will  be  prepared  for  significant  variations  from  the  budget.  The \nmanagement board can approve deviations of up to D30 billion ($ 2 million); any amount above \nthis needs EVN approval. The management board director has full authorization to execute all \ntransactions  under  the  Project.  The  financial  director  is  responsible  for  recording  the \ntransactions. Bank reconciliation is prepared by account staff and approved by the director. The \nmanagement board is responsible only for project construction. Once complete, the Project will \nhanded over to another part of EVN that will be responsible for its operation and maintenance.  \n\n17. \nAlthough the management board is not a separate company, it prepares its own annual \nfinancial reports. Its balance sheet is incorporated into EVN\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. When \nthe  management  board  procures  new  assets  for  a  particular  project,  these  are  added  to  the \nbalance  sheet  of  the  management  board.  When  a  project  is  complete,  the  assets  associated \nwith  the  project  are  removed  from  the  management  board\u2019s  balance  sheet  and  transferred  to \nthe EVN entity that will operate and maintain the project. \n\n2. \n\nReporting \n\n18.  As the management board is responsible only for implementing the Project, it will maintain \nseparate  accounts  for  the  Project.  It  will  submit  progress  reports  to  ADB  on  a  quarterly  basis. \nThe  reports  will  provide  a  narrative  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  changes  in  the \nimplementation schedule, problems or difficulties encountered, and the work to be carried out in \nthe  next  period.  The  progress  reports  will  include  a  summary  financial  account  for  the \ninvestment component, including project expenditures during the period. The quarterly progress \nreports will be submitted to ADB within 1 month of the end of each quarter.4  \n \nIn addition to the quarterly reports, within 6 months of the close of the financial year, the \n18. \nmanagement  board  through  EVN  will  submit  to  ADB  annual  audited  accounts  of  EVN  and \nannual  audited  financial  statements  of  the  Project.

A project completion report will be submitted to ADB by EVN within 3 \nmonths of Project completion.  \n\n                                                 \n4   EVN progress reports for past and ongoing projects have been submitted on time and the quality of these reports \n\nwas adequate. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n47 \n\n3. \n\nInternal Audit and External Audit \n\n19. \nFinancial  statements  of  EVN  are  currently  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors. \nExperience from previous projects indicates that there have been no delays in EVN audits since \n1999.  Audits  of  EVN  have  been  conducted  mostly  in  accordance  with  the  International \nStandards on Auditing for public institutions.  EVN established its Internal Audit Department in \nMarch 1998. It is headed by a chief of internal audit supported by five professional accountants. \nCurrently,  EVN  relies  heavily  on  direct  supervision,  detailed  reporting,  and  authorization  from \ntop management for internal control. Based on the financial management assessment, EVN and \nits  Project  management  boards  have  satisfactory  internal  financial  control  and  oversight \nmechanisms to ensure that the project funds will be utilized for the intended purpose and that \nrecords will be maintained on how the funds are utilized.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCost of sales \n\nSelling costs \n\nAdministration costs \n\nDepreciation \n    Total Operating     \n    Expenses \n\nOperating profit \n\nFinance charges \n\nProfit from associates \nForeign exchange \nloss/(gain) \n\nTax \n\n \n\nTable A9.1: Viet Nam Electricity Income Statement, 2000\u20132011  \n(D billion) \n \n\nItem \n\nSales \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n 16,510 \n\n19,210 \n\n23,566 \n\n30,246 \n\n34,530  \n\n37,273 \n\n43,766 \n\n54,148 \n\n68,040 \n\n81,185 \n\n94,689 \n\n107,334 \n\nOther income \n\n271 \n\n553 \n\n580 \n\n729 \n\n892  \n\n741 \n\n1.165 \n\n2,688 \n\n3,379 \n\n4,029 \n\n4,694 \n\n5,316 \n\n    Total Income \n\n16,781 \n\n19,763 \n\n24,146 \n\n30,975 \n\n35,422  \n\n38,014 \n\n44,931 \n\n56,836 \n\n71,419 \n\n85,214 \n\n99,383 \n\n112,649 \n\n9,112 \n\n10,824 \n\n12,031 \n\n13,510 \n\n18,367  \n\n23,047 \n\n27,663 \n\n34,956 \n\n41,543 \n\n44,076 \n\n49,940 \n\n54,979  \n\n336 \n\n771 \n\n4,462 \n\n405 \n\n1,025 \n\n5,135 \n\n477 \n\n1,157 \n\n7,056 \n\n655 \n\n2,464 \n\n8,376 \n\n748  \n\n1,171 \n\n8,085  \n\n811 \n\n1,784 \n\n9,100 \n\n1,307 \n\n 2,114 \n\n1,246 \n\n2,352 \n\n1,564 \n\n2,906 \n\n1,864 \n\n3,451 \n\n2,172 \n\n4,012 \n\n2,460 \n\n4,543 \n\n9,993 \n\n10,574 \n\n12,372 \n\n14,946 \n\n18,535 \n\n22,388  \n\n14,681 \n\n17,389 \n\n20,721 \n\n25,005 \n\n28,371 \n\n34,742 \n\n41,033 \n\n49,128 \n\n58,386 \n\n64,337 \n\n74,659 \n\n84,370 \n\n \n\n \n\n550 \n\n\u2014 \n\n154 \n\n514 \n\n882 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3,272 \n\n1,608 \n\n\u2014 \n\n(2,370) \n\n4,034 \n\n1,195 \n\n2,839 \n\n \n\n8.6 \n\n5.4 \n\n2,100 \n\n2,374 \n\n3,425 \n\n587 \n\n\u2014  \n\n246 \n\n541 \n\n783 \n\n\u2014 \n\n314 \n\n2,328 \n\n678 \n\n5,970 \n\n1,032 \n\n7,051 \n\n1,313 \n\n3,088 \n\n1,850 \n\n20 \n\n1,500 \n\n4,238 \n\n906 \n\n3,854 \n\n1,847 \n\n(41) \n\n2,048 \n\n355 \n\n7,708 \n\n1,828 \n\n37 \n\n680 \n\n5,237 \n\n1,456 \n\n13,033 \n\n20,876 \n\n24,725 \n\n28,280 \n\n2,692 \n\n3,679 \n\n5,126 \n\n6,026  \n\n37 \n\n51 \n\n52 \n\n52  \n\n843 \n\n9,536 \n\n2,660 \n\n1,003 \n\n1,165 \n\n1,297 \n\n16,246 \n\n18,486 \n\n21,010 \n\n4,535 \n\n5,162 \n\n5,868 \n\nProfit before tax \n\n1,396 \n\n1,541 \n\nProfit after tax \n\n1,000 \n\n1,650 \n\n1,830 \n\n3,332 \n\n1,693 \n\n3,781 \n\n6,876 \n\n11,711 \n\n13,324 \n\n15,142 \n\n \nOperating margin (% of \nsales) \nReturn on fixed assets \n(%) \n\n12.5 \n\n12.0 \n\n14.2 \n\n9.9 \n\n8.7 \n\n9.0 \n\n19.3 \n\n12.7 \n\n19.9 \n\n13.4 \n\nReturn on equity (%) \n\u2014 = not available, ( ) = negative. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates for 2007\u20132011 and published accounts of EVN for 2000\u20132006. \n\n3.2 \n\n3.5 \n\n5.2 \n\n5.2 \n\n8.6 \n\n6.5 \n\n3.4 \n\n8.6 \n\n5.8 \n\n13.6 \n\n14.7 \n\n8.0 \n\n18.2 \n\n21.5 \n\n12.8 \n\n24.5 \n\n28.1 \n\n18.5 \n\n24.9 \n\n26.0 \n\n17.7 \n\n25.1 \n\n24.6 \n\n17.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4\n8\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n9\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nTable A9.2: Viet Nam Electricity Balance Sheet, 2000\u20132011  \n(D billion) \n\n2000 \n\n2001 \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n2010 \n\n2011 \n\n \n\n \n\n6,694  \n\n7,653  \n\n10,793 \n\n12,855  \n\n12,232  \n\n12,829 \n\n18,469 \n\n2,619  \n\n2,665  \n\n4,074  \n\n1,375  \n\n1,731  \n\n2,299  \n\n504  \n\n670  \n\n463  \n\n5,749  \n\n2,859  \n\n518  \n\n7,396  \n\n3,777  \n\n798  \n\n7,961 \n\n4,424 \n\n250 \n\n10,280 \n\n5,478 \n\n297 \n\n7,407 \n\n4,736 \n\n2,669 \n\n798 \n\n7,104 \n\n5,952 \n\n3,047 \n\n798  \n\n9,897 \n\n16,636 \n\n27,807 \n\n7,101 \n\n3,690 \n\n798 \n\n8,282 \n\n4,459 \n\n798 \n\n9,387 \n\n5,607 \n\n798 \n\n       Total Current Assets  \n\n11,192  \n\n12,719 \n\n17,629 \n\n21,981  \n\n24,203  \n\n25,464 \n\n34,484 \n\n15,611 \n\n16,901 \n\n21,486 \n\n30,175 \n\n43,599 \n\n2.

The  Project \n1. \ncost  estimates  and  financial  projections  in  nominal  terms  were  converted  to  real  terms  by \nremoving the effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations. \n \n\n \nB. \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n\nThe weighted average cost of capital (WACC) has been calculated in real terms based \n\n2. \non the capital composition detailed in Table A10.1 \n\n \nTable A10.1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nFinancing Source \nAsian Development Bank Loan \nDomestic Bank Loans \nEquity \n         Total Project Cost \n\nAmount \n196.0 \n22.3 \n49.0 \n267.3 \n\n% of Financing \n73.3 \n8.4 \n18.3 \n \n\n      Source:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3. \nThe  real  cost  of  foreign  debt  has  been  calculated  based  on  the  10-year  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  swap1 rate  of  4.5%  plus  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nspread  of  0.2%,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  relending  fee  of  0.3%  (on  annualized  basis),  an \nincome tax  rate of 28% per annum, and an international inflation rate of 1.0% per annum. On \nthis  basis,  the  cost  of  foreign  debt,  in  real  terms,  has  been  computed  at  2.57%.  The  nominal \ninterest cost of the domestic bank loan is 8.5%. After adjusting for income tax rate of 28% and \ndomestic  inflation  rate  of  4%,  the  after-tax  real  cost  of  the  domestic  bank  loan  is  2.04%.

The price contingencies and \ninterest and commitment fees during construction period included in the cost estimates were not \ntaken into account in the financial analysis. The value added tax (VAT) on capital investments is \nnot  considered  in  the  financial  analysis  as  EVN  recovers  it  from  VAT  collected  from  its \nconsumers.  The  plant  output  is  estimated  to  be  378  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  in  the  dry  season \nand  113  GWh  in  the  wet  season.  The  electricity  output  is  valued  at  $0.044  per  kilowatt-hour \n(kWh  based  on  the  prevailing  prices  for  power  procured  from  independent  power  producers. \nThe operation and maintenance expenses of the power plant is assumed to be The FIRR and \nthe NPV calculated at a discount rate equal to the WACC of the Project are 6.49% and $110.6 \nmillion respectively.  \n \nIt  is  also  expected  that  additional  revenues  may  be  sought  by  selling  certified  carbon \n6. \nreductions  (CER)  due  to  the  Project  under  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM).  The \ncash outflows during the operation phase include the operation and maintenance costs and the \nenvironment  and  social  mitigation  costs.  The  carbon  emissions  due  to  the  Project  have  been \nestimated at 217,879 tons per year based on a carbon emission factor of 534.5 tCO2 per GWh \nfor Viet Nam power grid, computed using the approved methodology ACM0002 version 7 of the \nCDM  Executive  Board.  Revenues  from  the  sale  of  CER  are  estimated  conservatively  at \n$10/CER  ton.  When  CDM  revenues  are  taken  into  account,  the  FIRR  improves  to  7.60%  and \nthe  net  present  value  (NPV)  at  the  discount  rate  equal  to  WACC  of  the  Project  improves  to \n$158.2 million.  \n\n \n\n \n4. \n \n\n \nC. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\n53\n\nD. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n7. \nA number of scenarios were tested to determine the sensitivity to a number of variables, \nincluding  a  10%  increase  in  capital  costs,  a  10%  reduction  in  electricity  output,  and  a  1-year \ndelay in implementation.

Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  FIRR  will  exceed  the  WACC  under  combined \nevent adverse circumstances.  Although the Project is financially viable without considering the \nCDM  revenues,  the  CDM  revenues  are  important  to  provide  a  rate  of  return  on  the  equity \ninvestment in the Project that exceeds the hurdle rate of return (8%) of EVN.  Given the overall \nobjectives  of  the  Project,  the  financial  performance  is  deemed  acceptable,  and  the  Project  is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. \n\n \n\n\f \n54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA.  \n \nThe  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B \n1. \nsummarizes  the  environment  impact  assessment  (EIA)  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  They \nwere  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Environmental \nAssessment  Guidelines  and  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  the  SEIA  was  disclosed  on  the \nADB website on 21 August 2006. The Project is classified category A in accordance with ADB \nenvironmental classification criteria. The Project is located in the Bung river, a tributary of the Vu \nGia river in Quang Nam province. \n \nB. \n\nTechnical Alternatives to the Project \n\n2. \nTechnical  Alternatives.  At  the  pre-feasibility  stage  of  the  Project,  two  options  were \nstudied:  with  and  without  a  diversion  of  the  water  after  power  generation  to  the Cai  river.  The \nalternative without trans-basin diversion was selected mainly for environmental considerations. \nWater  diversion  would  alter  the  natural  conditions  of  both  the  Bung  and  Cai  rivers.  Two \nalternative locations for the power station were also considered: one at the foot of the dam and \nthe other about 5.5 kilometers (km) downstream. A power station located at the dam foot would \nslightly  reduce  environmental  impact  by  eliminating  the  river  bypass.  However,  the  option  to \nlocate the power plant 5.5 km downstream was adopted on economic grounds as the capacity, \nfirm  power,  and  total  annual  electricity  output  would  increase  significantly  as  a  result  of  the \nhigher head provided by the river bypass. A minimum operating level (MOL) of 220 meters (m) \nwas considered as an alternative to the proposed 195 m MOL. A higher MOL (i.e., 220 m) with a \nlower  water  level  fluctuation  in  the  reservoir  would  give  better  conditions  for  natural  fish \nproduction  in  the  reservoir.  However,  this  would  provide  a  very  small  active  reservoir  volume, \nand  the  power  plant  would  be  effectively  operated  as  a  run-of-river  plant  with  insufficient  firm \npower  capability.  The  flood  mitigation  potential  would  also  be  reduced  significantly.  From  a \ntechnical and economical evaluation, the alternative with 195 m MOL was therefore adopted \n \nC. \n\nAnticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n3. \nHydrology.  The  natural  mean  annual  inflow  into  the  reservoir  has  been  estimated  at \n63.5 cubic meters per second (m3/s). The driest month of the year is April with a mean inflow of \n27.0 m3/s  and  a  minimum  flow  of  about  4.5  m3/s.  November  is  the  month  with  highest  mean \nmonthly inflows of 183.0 m3/s. The Project will alter the natural flows of the river downstream of \nthe dam. The flow will be negligible in the river section between the dam and the power plant.    \n \n4. \nBecause of the storage provided by the reservoir, the average monthly  flow during the \ndry season downstream of the power plant will increase, while the average monthly flow in the \nwet season will decrease. However, peaking operation will cause daily fluctuations in flow and \nwater  levels  in  the  river  downstream  of  the  power  station  outlet.  The  flow  downstream  of  the \npower station in the driest months will range from about 0.2 m3/s when the power plant is not in \noperation  (usually  at  night)  to  93 m3/s  when  the  power  plant  is  operating.  Inflow  from  the \nintermediate catchments and over spilling at Song Bung 4 and A Vuong hydropower projects in \nthe wet season will add to these flows. The magnitude of water level fluctuations will vary along \nthe  river,  depending  on  the  cross-sections  at  different  locations  and  distance  from  the  power \nstation.  Downstream  of  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  power  station  outlet,  the  water  level  can \nfluctuate  quite  suddenly  during  startup  of  the  generators  and  the  maximum  water  level \nfluctuation  is  estimated  at  1.5 m.  About  25 km  downstream  of  the  power  plant  in  the  Vu  Gia \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n55\n\nriver,  after  the  confluence  with  its  largest  tributary,  the  Cai  river,  the  maximum  water  level \nfluctuation is estimated to be 0.6 m.1 To moderate the rapid water level fluctuations, especially \non the first few kilometers downstream of the power station, it is recommended to start and stop \nthe power station in a stepwise sequence in coordination with the national load dispatch center. \nThe  start-up  procedure  at  the  power  station  will  be  preceded  by  warning  sirens  to  warn \ndownstream river users.   \n \n5. \nSoil  Erosion.  Much  of  the  land  cover  in  the  project  construction  area  has  grass  and \nshrub  vegetation  on  steep  slopes,  and  is  prone  to  erosion  and  landslides.  All  top  soil  will  be \nscraped off at project sites (stored for reuse), and temporary acquired land and spoil areas will \nbe  rehabilitated  after  completing  construction.  Sand  will  be  acquired  from  the  riverbank  in  Cai \nriver near Thanh My where there is no topsoil. The soil pits and rock quarries will be filled and \nappropriately  planted  with  trees,  shrubs,  and  grasses.  Rehabilitation  will  include  (i)  immediate \nre-vegetation  (using  fast-growing  species),  (ii)  installation  of  sediment  runoff  control  devices, \nand (iii) erosion and re vegetation success monitoring.  \n \nWater  Quality.  In  the  first  years  after  reservoir  impoundment,  the  erosion  rate  will \n6. \nincrease in the reservoir embankments, and along the river downstream of the power plant. This \nimpact is expected to slow down after 3\u20135 years. Erosion of the watershed is also expected to \nincrease  in  general  because  of  increased  human  activity,  particularly  related  to  forest \ndegradation, agricultural activities, and road construction. However, the heavier sediment will be \ntrapped  in  the  reservoir,  as  opposed  to  being  carried  downstream.  In  the  initial  years  after \nreservoir  impoundment,  the  water  discharged  from  the  reservoir  will  have  low  oxygen  content \nbecause of decomposition of organic material from the inundated biomass. The discharge water \nwill  also  contain  high  levels  of  nutrients,  which  will  cause  some  eutrophication  (nutrient \nenrichment) impacts downstream. These effects are expected to last only for 2\u20135 years, as the \nreservoir will become oligotrophic (nutrient poor) in a short period.  \n \nFlora and Fauna. Potential impacts on flora and fauna include (i) vegetation loss during \n7. \nconstruction  activities;  (ii)  potential  increase  in  illegal  logging,  fuel  wood  and  non-timber  forest \nproduct  collection,  and  illegal  hunting  (also  in  Song  Thanh  Nature  Reserve);  and  (iii) localized \ndisturbance  to  wildlife  (e.g.,  macaque  and  turtle  populations).  Removal  of  vegetation  is \ninevitable at the construction sites but damage can be minimized by careful removal of trees. All \nplant and animal species, and vegetation communities are widely distributed and species loss is \nminimal. Surveys in the project sites did not reveal any special habitats for protected animals. \nHowever, construction activity will disturb animals that may come close to the project sites from \nnearby forested areas. The project will affect the Song Thanh Nature Reserve by inundating an \narea of 143 hectares (ha). The inundated area has been subject to logging and illegal hunting in \nthe past, and is now used for non-timber forest products collection. \n \nAquatic Ecology. Long distance migratory species of fish are likely to affected because \n8. \nof the barrier effect of the dam. The large water level variation in the river between the dam and \nthe  confluence  with  Cai  river  will  strongly  reduce  the  biological  productivity  of  the  river.  In  the \nstretch  downstream  of  the  confluence  with  Cai  river,  the  impacts  on  fish  will  be  smaller.    The \nProject will result in a loss of river habitat along a 30 km stretch upstream of the dam, which will \nbe replaced by a reservoir with a large 27.5 m water level fluctuation between full supply level \nand  minimum  operating  level  (regulation  zone).  Most  of  the  aquatic  life  in  the  regulation  zone \nwill die because of periodical dry-up. The regulation zone, especially steep slopes, are likely be \nheavily eroded, resulting in a denuded, inorganic, desert-like zone of sand, gravel, and stones \n\n                                                 \n1   This will be reduced when the downstream Song Bung 5 Hydropower Project is built. \n\n \n\n\f \n56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n\nwith  reduced  nutritional  value    for  the  bottom-dwelling  animals.  In  the  first  years  after \nimpoundment,  fish  productivity  will  be  relatively  good  because  of  the  supply  of  food  and \nnutrients  from  the  inundated  terrestrial  land.  Over  time,  fish  productivity  is  expected  to  be \nmarkedly  reduced.  Only  a  few  fish  species  will  succeed  in  adapting  to  a  lake  life.  In  the \nreservoir,  the  biodiversity  of  fish is expected  to  fall by  30\u201350%.  However,  most  of  the  species \nwill survive in small populations in the upstream of the reservoir and in the tributaries.  \n\n9. \nCumulative  Impacts.  The  Project  is  one  of  eight  hydropower  projects  planned  in  the \nVu Gia-Thu  Bon  river  system.  All  the  projects  are  planned  to  be  commissioned  before  2016, \naccording  to  Master  Plan  VI  for  Power  Development.  Currently,  two  of  the  projects  are  under \nconstruction  with  total  installed  capacity  of  372 megawatts  (MW).  The  six  remaining  projects, \nincluding  Song  Bung  4,  have  a  total  capacity  of  782  MW.  The  relatively  small  Song  Bung  5 \nreservoir  downstream  of  Song  Bung  4  will  act  as  a  re-regulation  reservoir  for  the  upstream \nhydropower plants Song Bung 4, Song Bung 2, and A Vuong\u2014resulting in smaller water level \nfluctuations downstream of the Song Bung 5 dam. The hydropower projects will be operated in \na way that increases the downstream flow in dry months and decreases the flow in wet months. \nIncreased flow in dry periods will give a more secure supply of water for irrigation, domestic and \nindustrial  use  in  the  downstream  areas.  On  the  floodplain,  where  most  of  the  water  users  are \nlocated,  increased  flow  in  dry  season  may  also  reduce  the  negative  impacts  from  salinity \nintrusion  from  the  sea.  To  some  extent,  the  reservoirs  can  also  reduce  the  frequency  and \nmagnitude of floods.  \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan \n\nD. \n \nBefore  the  commencement  of  project  construction,  the  Song  Bung  4  Hydropower \n10. \nmanagement  board  will  set  up  an  environmental  management  unit  (EMU)  for  environmental \nmanagement  and  operation,  including  supervision  of  contractors  to  ensure  compliance  with \nEMP. The EMU will ensure implementation of the EMP, including the environmental monitoring \nplan during construction and operation of the Project. The EMU will coordinate all environmental \nmonitoring activities as summarized in the SEIA and in the EIA. The EMU will ensure that the \nEMP  is  updated  periodically  during  the  construction  period.  An  independent  environmental \nsupervision consultant, as part of the independent monitoring agency will supervise and monitor \nenvironmental  procedures.  The  EMU  will  submit  reports  (including  physical  data)  on \nimplementation  of  the  EMP  to  the  Executing  Agency,  Department  for  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironment of Quang Nam province, and ADB biannually during construction and annually for \n2 years after the commissioning of the Project.  \n \nE. \n \n11.  Major  potential  environmental  impacts  from  the  Project  will  include  (i)  soil  erosion,  \n(ii)  loss  of  terrestrial  and  aquatic  biodiversity,  (iii)  increased  pressure  on  Song  Thanh  Nature \nReserve,  (iv) loss  of  river  continuity  because  of  the  dam,  (v)  a  river  section  with  strongly \nreduced  flow,  and  (vi) daily  water  level  fluctuations  downstream  of  the  power  plant.  Mitigation \nmeasures have been proposed to minimize and regularly monitor the impacts. By implementing \nthe  EMP,  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  can  be  minimized  to  acceptable \nlevels.  The  proposed  Project\u2019s  anticipated  environmental  benefits  include  less  emission  of \ngreenhouse gases, a general contribution to development of the area, irrigation benefits in the \ndry months of the year, and a positive contribution to minimize the salt intrusion problem in the \nfloodplain.  \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n57 \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT AND ETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN \n\nScope  of  Resettlement  and  Ethnic  Minority \n\n1. \nImpacts.  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  and  related  social  impacts  are  anticipated  in  four  geographic  zones.  The \nresettlement impacts of the Project in these four zones are described below and a summary of \nresettlement-related impacts is presented in Table A12.4. The detailed resettlement and ethnic \nminority development plan (REMDP) is in Supplementary Appendix A, the gender action plan is \nin  Supplementary  Appendix  F,  and  the    Social  Management  Plan  for  the  construction  phase \n(including the health action plan) is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n2. \nReservoir Inundation Area. Six villages of Zuoih commune in Nam Giang district will be \naffected by flooding of Song Bung 4 reservoir, and 206 ethnic minority households in four of the \nsix villages will be physically relocated. The remaining two villages, Thon Vinh and Pa Toi in Ta \nBhing commune, will lose part of the upland agricultural and grazing land belonging to 52 ethnic \nminority households, but the residential area will not be affected. Relocation of the four villages \nwill  entail  loss  of  houses,  community  facilities  such  as  schools  and  health  centres,  rice  fields, \nfields for other crops and vegetables, forestland, and fishing grounds; associated social stress; \nand  consequent  changes  in  lifestyles  and  livelihoods.  One  of  the  villages,  Pa  Rum  A,  will  be \ndisplaced only from its residential lands and rice fields, while its other crops and forestland will \nnot  be  flooded.  Resettlement  of  the  reservoir-affected  villages  is  described  in  detail  in  the \nREMDP volume 2. \n\n3. \nProject Construction Land Areas. The Project will require about 550 hectares (ha) for \nconstruction sites, including for the dam site, power house, access roads, quarries, spoil areas, \nrelocation of the flooded section of highway 14D, and 220 kilovolt (kV) and 35-kV transmission \nlines. As the project design available is to the level required for the feasibility study, the design \ndetails  of  auxiliary  components  of  the  Project,  including  the  transmission  line  and  the  \n5.4  kilometer  (km)  access  road  to  the  dam  site,  are  indicative  with  respect  to  location, \nalignment, and size. Based on the available design, a maximum of 94 households (540 people) \nin  Thon  Vinh  village  could  lose  agricultural  lands,  and  approximately  one  third  of  these  94 \nhouseholds  (31  households)  could  lose  more  than  10%  of  their  productive  assets.  The  only \nstructures to be displaced might be 10 temporary field huts and graves. In nearby Pa Toi village, \nwith  23  households  (22  Co  Tu,  1  Kinh)  and  109 people,  the  losses  would  be  only  upland  rice \nland, and no household would lose more than 10% of total productive assets.1  \n\n4. \nFor the 220 kV transmission towers, it is estimated that only 0.81 ha, or 0.2% of total wet \nand  upland  rice  areas  would  be  lost  in  the  13  villages  along  the  preliminary  alignment.  No \nhousehold would lose more than 10% of productive land. For the 35 kV transmission line that \nwill be located along the existing highway 14D and access road to the project site, the current \nlevel  of  design  indicates  no  structures  or  productive  land  or  trees  would  be  impacted.  For  the \nmain  construction  components  (including  the  dam  site,  tunnel  adits,  power  house,  and  intake \nsite) where there is a feasibility level of design, only 15 ha of land will be required\u2014consisting of \npublic forest (11 ha), scrubland (3.5 ha), water surface (0.6 ha), and no cropland. All land will be \nacquired  with  associated  compensation  and  income  restoration  to  current  owners  and  users. \nLand acquisition for project construction land is addressed in the REMDP, volume 3.    \n\nUpstream  and  Downstream  of  the  Dam.  The  upstream  and  downstream  social  and \n\n5. \nlivelihood impacts are caused by two main hydropower project features. \n\n                                                 \n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB) Operations Manual F2/BP footnote 12 and this Project\u2019s resettlement policy define \nphysical displacement from housing and/or loss of 10% or more of productive, income-generating assets as major \nimpacts requiring rehabilitation measures\u2014not just compensation for losses. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n \n6. \nzones.  \n \n\nCreation  of  the  dam  and  reservoir.  (a)  The  dam  will  block  fish  migration  and \nthus  significantly  affect  upstream  and  downstream  catch  of  migrating  species; \n(b) the dam and reservoir will cause sediments to settle in the reservoir, and the \nclear  water  that  will  be  released  will  have  fewer  nutrients  for  aquatic  life,  and \nrejuvenation  of  the  alluvial  plains;  and  (c)  the  released  water  will  be  colder  and \ndeoxygenated, which will make it less favorable for aquatic life. \nOperation  of  the  power  station. (a)  There will be daily river level fluctuations; \n(b) the ecology and reproductive biology of aquatic species will be affected by the \nblocking  of  migratory  routes;  (c)  in  DS  Zone  2  (see  below)  some  river  bank \nerosion will occur, which will affect some river bank gardens and crop land; and \n(d) access to the river for (1) domestic water collection, and (2) domestic animals \nwill be more difficult.  \n\nFor  social  and  livelihood  impact  assessment,  the  downstream  is  divided  into  three \n\nDownstream zone 1: between Song Bung 4  dam site and confluence with Song \nCai (Pa Dau 2 is the only village in this zone). \nDownstream  zone  2: around the confluence of Song Bung river with the Song \nCai river (Dai Son commune, consisting  of eight villages, is located in this zone, \nDownstream  zone  3:  further  downstream  from  the  confluence  (after  which  the \nriver is called the Vu Gia) until the Song Quang Hue, a short channel connecting \nthe Vu Gia to the Thu Bon.  \n\n \n7. \nTables A12.1 and A12.2 contain the number of households that are likely to be affected \nby  the  impact  on  fisheries  and  other  impacts.  Upstream  and  downstream  social  impacts  are \ndescribed in more detail in the REMDP, volume 4. \n \n\nTable A12.1: Number of Downstream Fishing Households  \n\n \n\n \n\nDownstream Zone \nZone 1  Pa Dau 2 Village \n\nZone 2  Dai Son Commune \nZone 3  Other 9 Communes \nTotal \n\n \n\nNo. of Households \n\nTotal \n\nFishing Subsistence \n\nCommercial  \n\n39 \n\n679 \n25,067 \n\n34 \n\n98 \n1,678 \n\n \n\n1,810 \n\n34 \n\n66 \n1,437 \n\n1,537 \n\n \n\n32 \n241 \n\n273 \n\n              Source: Resettlement and Ethnic Minority Development Plan of Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project. \n \n\nTable A12.2: Number of Downstream Households Affected by Non-Fisheries Impacts \n\nDownstream Zone \nZone 1  Pa Dau 2 Village \n\nTotal number  \nof HH \n\nRiverbank \nGardens Erosion, \nNo. of HH \n0 \n\n39 \n\n679 \n\nDomestic Water \nImpacts \n\nOther Social or \nCultural Impacts \n\n0 \nExact impact \nuncertain, but not \nsignificant \n\u2014 \n\nYes, cultural \n\nYes: (a) safety,  \n(b) river transport \n\nNo  \n\nZone 2  Dai Son Commune \n\n125 \n\nZone 3  10 Other Communes \n\u2014 = not available, HH = household. \nSource: Resettlement and Ethnic Minority Development Plan of Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project. \n \n\n25,067 \n\n\u2014 \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n59 \n\nUpstream  of  the  Dam.  The  reservoir  inundation  will  result  in  a  loss  of  30  km  of  river \n8. \nhabitat, which will be replaced by a reservoir with water level fluctuation (planned 27.5 meters \n[m]  between  full  supply  level  and  minimum  operating  level).  In  the  first  years  after  regulation, \nfish  productivity  will  be  relatively  good  because  of  the  supply  of  food  and  nutrients  from  the \ninundated  biomass.  However,  over  time,  fish  productivity  will  be  markedly  reduced  and  the \npotential  for  the  fish  harvest  will  be  low.  The  portion  of  their  fish  catch  that  is  made  up  of \nmigratory species will be lost as these species will no longer be able to complete their migration \ncycles.  The  number  of  villages  that  may  be  affected  by  this,  and  the  importance  of  migratory \nspecies in their fish catch, is the subject of ongoing investigations. Impacts on livelihoods will be \ncompensated for and restored, as described in more detail in the REMDP, volume 4  \n\n9. \nScope  of  the  REMDP.  As  part  of  project  preparation,  social,  gender,  and  poverty \nanalysis  was  carried  out  in  the  project  areas.  A  census,  an  inventory  of  losses,  and  a \nsocioeconomic survey were carried out for the reservoir inundation area, the project lands, and \nthe areas upstream and downstream of the dam. The REMDP for project lands will be updated \nafter  detailed  design.  Detailed  village  development  plans  will  be  prepared  for  each  of  the \nreservoir impacted villages during project implementation. A detailed plan to mitigate upstream \nand downstream impacts will be prepared during project implementation. \n\n10. \nLegal  Framework. The REMDP has been prepared for the Project in accordance with \nthe requirements of Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), \nPolicy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998),  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998),  and  Public \nCommunications Policy (2005). The REMDP was also prepared in compliance with laws of the \nGovernment  of  Viet  Nam,  principally  Decree  197/CP  (2004)  as  amended  by  Decree  17/CP \n(2006). The Vietnamese legal framework brings resettlement in Viet Nam  very close to ADB\u2019s \nstandards,  but  there  are  still  some  gaps,  particularly  in  interpretation  and  implementation. \nProvisions and principles adopted in the REMDP for the Project will supersede the provisions of \nrelevant  decrees  currently  in  force  in  Viet  Nam  wherever  a  gap  exists.  The  Project  will \nimplement a programmatic approach to resettlement  that is similar to a rural livelihood project \nand  includes  technical  assistance  (TA)  through  the  proposed  JFPR  grant  and  transitional \nassistance until the resettlers can sustain their own livelihoods. \n \nGrant  Financing  to  Close  the  Gaps  between  Government  and  ADB  Policy  and \n11. \nPractice.  ADB  policies  and  government  legislation  have  similar  objectives  of  improving \nconditions  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  but  the  understanding  of  what  this  means  and  the \napproaches  to  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  planning  are  significantly  different,  especially \nwith  respect  to  livelihood  restoration  and  improvement.  For  example,  the  Government\u2019s \napproach  to  resettlement  is  to  provide  basic  inputs\u2014resettlement,  some  cash  compensation, \nrice supplements for 1\u20133 years, agricultural land, limited or no access to forest and fisheries on \nwhich resettled people previously depended to supplement their subsistence agriculture, and no \nor  inadequate  skills  training.  In  most  cases,  the  compensation  is  only  short-term  and \nimplemented through top-down approaches. This is not a very sustainable way of restoring the \nlives  and  livelihoods  of  affected  persons  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Prevailing  government \npolicies do not require compensation for adverse impacts on livelihoods that do not result from \nrelocation, such as upstream and downstream impacts.  \n\n12. \nFunding  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  has  been  secured  to \nfinance  an  enhanced  livelihood  program  that  goes  beyond  the  approach  followed  on  projects \nfinanced by Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) in Viet Nam. The intention is not only to restore or even \nimprove the livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable, but also to demonstrate to the Government \nhow resettlement can be considered as a development opportunity, and to build local skills. The \nproposed  grant  would  finance  (i)  an  enhanced  livelihood  program  aimed  at  improving  and \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nsustaining  the  livelihoods  of  reservoir  resettlers,  as  well  as  people  in  downstream  areas  who \nwould experience loss of their fisheries-based livelihood; and (ii) consulting input to manage the \nimplementation of enhanced livelihood program in a sustainable manner.  \n\nEntitlements.  Project  entitlements  have  been  designed  to  provide  for  compensation, \n13. \nresettlement, and rehabilitation for lost land, assets, infrastructure, resources, income sources, \nand  services,  so  that  affected  persons  would  be  at  least  as  well-off  after  the  Project  as  they \nwould  have  been  in  its  absence.  The  poorest  affected  persons  and  others  who  are  most \nvulnerable to the risks of impoverishment caused by involuntary resettlement2 will be assisted to \nimprove their standard of living above the national poverty line. Non-vulnerable households will \nbe  assisted  to  restore  their  pre-project  socio-economic  status.  There  will  be  no  differentiation \nbetween people with and without legal title to land. A separate detailed entitlement matrix has \nbeen prepared for each of the project areas in the REMDP, volumes 2, 3, and 4. \n\n14. \nEthnic  Minorities  and  Other  Vulnerable  Groups.  All  affected  households  in  the \nreservoir area belong to the Co Tu ethnic minority, with the exception of four Kinh households \nand four households of Kinh men married to Co Tu women. The majority of the population in the \nproject  lands  areas  (but  not  along  the  220  kV  transmission  line)  and  in  one  of  the  villages \ndownstream of the dam are also Co Tu. The overall aims of the REMDP are to: (i) address the \nimportant issue of culturally sensitive development for project-affected persons, (ii) significantly \nimprove the livelihoods and standard of living of the ethnic minority and other vulnerable project-\naffected persons, (iii) provide effective safeguards against adverse impacts, and (iv) ensure that \nthe affected persons have been consulted fully and have participated in the decisions that affect \nthem.  \n\n15. \nResettlement  Strategy. The four Zuioh commune villages that will be displaced by the \nreservoir  will  be  relocated  to  resettlement  sites  within  close  proximity  of  their  current  village \nsites. Two of the villages, Pa Dhi (62 households, 282 people) and Pa Rum A (44 households, \n196  people),  will  move  within  their  own  village  boundaries;  only  the  residential  area  and  rice \nfields  of  Pa  Rum  A  will  be  flooded,  not  the  rest  of  its  land.  The  third  village,  Thon  2 \n(48 households, 229 people), will move 3 km away into the territory of another village, Papang \n(21  households,  85  persons),  which  will  become  a  host  village.  The  consensus  of  the  fourth \nvillage, Pa Rum B (52 households, 264 people), is that most of the village will move 4\u20138 km to \ntheir former village territory and the rest will go to Papang. A primary school will be built in each \nvillage.  The  commune  center  will  be  reestablished  in  Pa  Dhi  and  a  sub  center  will  be \nestablished  in  Papang.  A  secondary  school  and  health  center  will  be  built  in  Pa  Dhi  and \nPapang.  The  host  population  of  Papang  will  also  receive  benefits  including  schools,  health \ncenter,  lands,  water  supply,  and  an  irrigation  system.  The  resettlers  and  host  population  will \nundertake  detailed  village  planning  and  design,  and  house  construction  with  support  from  the \nProject.  New  access  roads  and  village  infrastructure  facilities  will  be  built  by  the  Project. \nEnvironmental assessment will be performed for all sites.  \n \n16. \nLivelihood  Improvement.  The  approach  to  resettlement  of  the  reservoir-affected \nresettlers is based on restoring and improving livelihoods in the case of vulnerable groups. The \napproach to income restoration and livelihood improvement is through a combination of upland \nrice,  wetland  rice  (where  topography  permits),  and  livestock;  and  exclusive  access  to  forest \nthrough  a  community-based  forest  management  program  and  fishery  resources,  including \nreservoir  fisheries  to  the  extent  possible.  The  livelihood  plan,  which  has  been  designed  in \n\n                                                 \n2   Vulnerable  groups  include  households  with  income  levels  below  the  national  poverty  line,  ethnic  minority \nhouseholds, landless households and those headed by women, the elderly, disabled, and children without means \nof support. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n61 \n\nconsultation with affected persons, will be detailed into village and household level plans during \nimplementation.  \n\n17. \nOptions  for  income  restoration  for  affected  persons  in  upstream  and  downstream \ncommunities have also been designed in consultation with the affected people. For land-based \nlosses, providing replacement land will be the priority.  Although the cash compensation is likely \nto be preferred by affected persons, other options will be considered that revolve  around self-\nemployment  and  livelihoods  options  that  will  enable  restoration  of  pre-project  socioeconomic \nstatus. Income and protein from downstream fisheries losses will be restored through alternative \nlivelihood options, such as replacing fish loss with fishponds or support for enhanced livestock \nprogram, which will be developed through a participatory process.  \n\nTransitional  Support  and  a  Phased  Exit  Strategy  for  Reservoir  Resettlers.  The \n18. \nProject is taking a development approach of improving living standards and livelihoods, not just \nresettling people and restoring their impoverished pre-project conditions. To do this, the Project \nwill  make  available  an  enhanced  package  of  livelihood  activities  that  are  similar  to  their  pre-\nproject livelihood activities but with potential for higher yield and productivity.  This is combined \nwith secured land tenure and improved health and education capacity building and training on \nnew agricultural practices, livestock breeding and  preparing fish ponds. All households will be \nassisted  as  needed  with  transitional  food  support  until  they  can  become  self-sufficient  in  the \nnew  resettlement  sites.  Resettlers  will  also  be  provided  with  community  development  and \ncapacity building to cope with changing social conditions. \n\n19. \nParticipatory  Process,  Disclosure,  and  Grievance  Mechanism.  The  resettlement \nplanning  undertaken  to  date  has  enabled  the  resettlers  to  participate  fully  in  the  detailed \nresettlement  planning  process  so  that  their  concerns  and  needs  are  fully  reflected  in  the \nREMDP.  This  approach  has  allowed  flexibility  and  adaptability,  particularly  in  the  selection  of \nresettlement  sites,  and  design  of  the  resettlement  strategy  and  household  livelihood  activities, \nso  that  they  are  tailored  toward  the  needs  and  situation  of  each  individual  household.  Local \nconsultations  have  been  targeted  at  men  and  women  affected  by  reservoir  inundation,  project \nconstruction,  and  upstream  and  downstream \nInformation  on  compensation, \nresettlement,  and  livelihood  options  has  been  presented  to  all  affected  men  and  women  by \ntrained  community  and  district  facilitators  through  easily  understandable  visual  materials \ntogether with verbal explanations in the Co Tu language; site visits of village men and women to \nproposed resettlement areas; and open discussions and feedback on proposals, concerns, and \npreferences. All affected persons have been informed and consulted regarding the impacts, and \nproposed mitigation and rehabilitation measures.  \n\nimpacts. \n\n20. \nTo  ensure  that  the  basic  rights  of  project-affected  persons  are  protected,  concerns \nadequately addressed, and entitlements delivered, a grievance mechanism will be implemented. \nThe first level of complaint will be the village resettlement committee, followed by commune and \ndistrict resettlement grievance committees. The commune grievance committee will include the \nCommune Women\u2019s Union chief and another woman representative of the commune, who will \nbe  a  Co  Tu  woman  for  Co  Tu  villages.  The  district  grievance  committee  will  include \nrepresentatives from the Justice Department, Women\u2019s Union, Ethnic Council, and Department \nof Agriculture. \n\n21. \nInstitutional  Arrangements.  A  specific  set  of  institutional  arrangements  and  agencies \nwill  be  established  for  the  direction,  management,  and  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the \nREMDP.  Decree  197/CP  assigns  full  responsibility  for  resettlement  implementation  to  the \nrespective  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  (in  this  case,  Quang  Nam  Provincial  People\u2019s \nCommittee) and to the districts affected by resettlement for this Project. The district resettlement \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\ncommittee  together  with  the  Song  Bung  4  Hydropower  management  board  will  establish  a \nresettlement management implementation unit (RMIU) to work directly with commune officials, \nvillage resettlement committees, and village resettlement teams in day-to-day implementation of \nthe REMDP. The RMIU will be staffed by some management board staff, but mainly by district \nstaff,  assisted  by  JFPR-financed  consultants.  The  district  and  commune  resettlement \ncommittees will include representatives from the Women\u2019s Union and women from Co Tu ethnic \nminority groups. District and commune resettlement committees for project lands and upstream \nand downstream areas will also include representatives from the Women\u2019s Union. Community-\nbased  male  and  female  extension  workers  will  be  trained  for  establishing  a  sustainable \nextension system for livelihood development in the resettlement sites for Co Tu ethnic groups. \nTraining  will  be  provided  through  the  JFPR  grant  to  demonstrate  an  improved,  sustainable, \ntimely,  and  cost-effective  approach  to  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  for \nhydropower projects in Viet Nam. \n \n22.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Monitoring  will  determine  whether  the  REMDP  programs \nare  achieving  their  objectives.  Monitoring  will  be  carried  out  both  internally  and  externally. \nInternal  monitoring  by  the  RMIU  under  the  district  resettlement  committee  will  focus  on  the \nprocess  and  physical  progress  of  resettlement  implementation  against  the  schedule  in  the \nREMDP.  External  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  an  independent  monitoring  agency  with \nextensive  experience  in  socioeconomic  survey  and  rural  development.  Project  socioeconomic \nimpacts,  including  the  well-being  of  ethnic  minority  groups  in  the  project  areas,  will  be  closely \nmonitored.  External  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  for  the  duration  of  REMDP  implementation \nand for an appropriate period after the commissioning of the Project until the objectives of the \nREMDP  are  achieved.  The  independent  monitoring  agency  will  send  their  reports  directly  to \nADB.  \n\n23. \nImplementation  Schedule.  Resettlement  activities  will  be  coordinated  with  the  civil \nworks  schedule,  so  that  adequate  time  will  be  planned  for  resettlement  activities  to  be \nsatisfactorily  implemented  before  the  commencement  of  the  reservoir  impounding.  For  project \nlands,  prior  to  commencement  of  civil  works  on  a  particular  project  land  or  group  of  project \nlands,  all  compensation  shall  have  been  paid  and  relocation  completed  satisfactorily  and \nrehabilitation measures are put in place. Relocation to resettlement sites shall commence only \nwhen the sites have been prepared with infrastructure, domestic and irrigation water supply, and \nhouses ready for occupancy. \n \n24. \nCost  Estimates.  Table  A12.3  presents  the  current  budget  estimate  to  cover  REMDP \nimplementation costs. EVN will finance $18 million for costs of activities normally undertaken on \ngovernment-financed  resettlement  projects.  The  JFPR  grant  will  finance  additional  costs, \nspecifically the livelihood improvement costs, including necessary consulting inputs.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n63 \n\n  \n\nItem \n\nTable A12.3: Cost Estimates for Resettlement and  \nEthnic Minority Development Plan \n($) \n\nTotal \nEVN \n\nTotal \nJFPRa \n\nInfrastructure and roads for reservoir resettlement sites \nHousing and other cultural facilities for reservoir APs  \nUXO survey and clearance \nTransitional allowances \nOperational and implementation support to RMIU \nProject lands acquisition and compensation \nLivelihoods program for Zuoih commune \nCapacity building for APs \nLivelihoods program for downstream communities \nTechnical assistance  \nContingencies \n          Total \n2,000,000\nAP = affected person, EVN = Viet Nam Electricity, JFPR = Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, \nRMIU = resettlement management and implementation unit, UXO = unexploded ordnance. \na  JFPR financing is being sought. \n\n14,944,867 \n1,384,193 \n260,177 \n919,501 \n360,000 \n161,331 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n736,896\n152,800\n241,055\n442,000\n101,697\n\n18,030,069 \n\n325,552\n\n  \n\n   Source: Resettlement and Ethnic Minority Development Plan of Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project. \n\n \n\n\f6\n4\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n2\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nTable A12.4: Summary of Affected Persons, Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project \n\nProject Component,  \nArea of Project Impacts \n\nNo. of Villages\n\nTotal No.\nof HH \n\nImpacted \n(HH) \n\nPhysically \nRelocating  \n(HH) \n\nLand or \nLivelihood \nImpacts \n(HH) \n\nFisheries \nImpacts \n(HH) \n\nSocial and/or \nCultural Impacts\n(HH) \n\nA.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nIn recent years, strong economic growth in Viet Nam has resulted in substantial increase in demand for electricity. The draft \n6th Power Development Master Plan expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.5% per annum over the period 2006\u2013\n2020. Electricity demand is expected to grow by 16% per annum over 2006\u20132010. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncountry strategy supports the Government\u2019s energy sector development strategy to supply electricity at an affordable price, \nand to ensure reliable and quality of supply to meet the rapidly growing demand. In particular, ADB will support efforts to \ndevelop new and renewable energy sources, especially in remote and mountainous areas. The rapid economic growth over \nthe past decades has resulted in a sharp decline in poverty rates, from 58% in 1993 to below  20% in 2007 Poverty reduction \nhas been a result of rapid, stable, and inclusive economic growth. The Government\u2019s aim is to maintain economic growth of \n7.5% per annum until 2010, and further reduce poverty incidence to 10\u201311% by 2010. Because of economic growth, Viet Nam \nis already facing a growing deficit of electricity supply. A reliable and sufficient amount of electricity supply is important for \neconomic growth. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project is built on the Bung river, a tributary of Vu Gia river, in Zuoih and Ta Bhing communes, \nNam Giang  district,  Quang  Nam  province  in  central  Viet  Nam\u2014to  sustain  economic  growth  in  the  region.  The  Project  will \nproduce  electricity  to  cover  increasing  demand  in  central  Viet  Nam.  It  will  significantly  affect  the  economy  in  the  form  of \naccelerated economic growth, and creating new jobs and a transport system. Jobs are expected to be created as a result of \nindustrialization, developed transportation and road networks, support services, and other multiplier effects. Following ADB\u2019s \nEnhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004), projects classified as general intervention no longer require project \nlevel poverty assessment. The main project impacts are anticipated in Nam Giang district of Quang Nam province and relate \nto land acquisition and reservoir inundation. \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nThe total population of Nam Giang district where the Song Bung 4 Project is located is approximately 20,000. Almost 80% of \nthe population consists of ethnic minority groups and 20% is Kinh (Vietnamese). Among the ethnic minority groups, 56% is Co \nTu, 19% Gie Trieng, and the rest belongs to other ethnic groups. Nam Giang district is one of the districts with high incidence \nof poverty\u2014about 52.6% of the population is below poverty line. The Project will directly affect five communes: Ta Bhing, Ca \nDy,  Thanh  My,  Cha  Val,  and  Zuoih  in  Nam  Giang  district.  Reservoir  inundation  will  affect  ethnic  minority  people  from  the \nfollowing villages: Thon 2, Pa Dhi, Pa Rum A, and Pa Rum B in Zuoih commune; and Pa Toi and Vinh in Ta Bhing commune. \nLand acquisition in project construction sites, including the dam site and transmission line, will affect people from 15 villages \nin three communes: Ta Bhing, Ca Dy, and Thanh My.  \n \nReservoir Inundated Villages. The four ethnic minority (Co Tu) villages\u2014Thon 2, Pa Dhi, Pa Rum A, and Pa Rum B in Zuoih \ncommune\u2014will  have  be  relocated  for  the  creation  of  the  reservoir.  Some  206  households  with  a  population  of  971  will  be \nphysically relocated, and 52 Co Tu households in Ta Bhing commune will lose more that 10% of upland cropland and grazing \nland. A further 21 Co Tu households will be affected, as they will be one of the host villages for resettlers. A large percentage \n(45.2%)  of  the  population  in  the  four  villages  is  below  18  years  and  the  education  level  is  low.  The  majority  of  Co  Tu \nhousehold heads have only elementary education or no education. The most common health problems in Zuoih commune are \nrespiratory  infections,  influenza,  pneumonia,  bronchitis,  and  diarrhea.  Malaria  occurs  mainly  in  the  rainy  season.  Poverty  is \nwidespread in Zuoih commune, which is one of the poorest communes in Nam Giang district. In Zuoih commune, 72.2% of \nthe  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line.  A  socioeconomic  survey  in  four  affected  villages  indicates  that  60%  of  the \nhouseholds in Parum B and 40% in Parum A do not have sufficient rice supply to last a year. These households relied on a \nmixed  staple  of  rice  and  cassava.  In  Pa  Dhi,  50%  of  households  depend  on  mixed  staples.  Thon  2  village  is  better  off  in \ncomparison  with the other three villages. These four villages are remote  and located  far from the district center. They have \npoor infrastructure and social services. The Co Tu villages in Zuoih commune have no access to newspapers but more than \nhalf  of  the  families  have  radio.  The  Co  Tu  people  in  Zuoih  commune  are  heavily  dependent  on  subsistence  farming,  non-\ntimber forest products, and river fishery.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n \nAnalysis  of  social,  economic,  and  cultural  conditions  of  the  four  affected  villages  are  described  in  detail  in  volume  2  of  the \nresettlement and ethnic minority development plan (REMDP). Reservoir inundation and relocation will entail loss of rice fields, \nfields  for  other  crops  and  vegetables,  river  fishery,  associated  social  and  cultural  traits,  and  social  networks.  The  REMDP \nincludes  mitigation  measures  and  livelihood  development  programs  for  the  reservoir  inundated  villages  to  replace  the  lost \nassets and livelihoods.  \n   \nProject  Lands.  Most  of  the  land  for  dam  construction  and  the  transmission  line  is  in  nine  villages  in  Ta  Bhing  and  Ca  Dy \ncommunes and Thanh My town. Most of the people in Ta Bhing and Ca Dy are Co Tu and Thanh My town is 56% Kinh. The \naffected villages due to transmission line are located along highway 14D and Ho Chi Minh Trail and are accessible throughout \nthe year. The ethnic minority people from these villages have more contact with Kinh people than those in Zuoih commune. \nThe rate of poverty is lower in Ta Bhing, Ca Dy, and Thanh My communes than in Zuoih commune. In Ta Bhing, 50.1% of \npeople (mostly Co Tu) are living below the poverty line; the percentage living below the poverty line is 45.4% in Ca Dy and \n31.5% in Thanh My. Both agricultural land and forestlands will be affected in the impact zone due to the land acquisition for \nproject construction area. Fishponds and cattle grazing may also be affected. Thirty one Co Tu households are likely to loose \nmore than 10% of their productive assets due to land acquisition for project construction lands. The mitigation measures for \nthe affected households are included in the resettlement plan for project lands (REMDP, volume 3). \n \nDownstream  Villages.  The  downstream  impact  includes  11  communes  in  Dai  Loc  district  and  one  village  in  Nam Giang \ndistrict. People living in downstream villages in Dai Loc district are all Kinh except for one village in Nam Giang district where \nall  39  households  are  Co  Tu.  The  main  impact  would  be  loss  of  fisheries.  The  REMDP  includes  measures  to  address  the \ndownstream impact (REMDP, volume 4). Several Co Tu villages in the upstream area may be affected by loss of migratory \nfish because of the barrier effect of the dam.  \n \n \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations (REMDP, volume 1)  were held  with the affected communities, government officials, and commune officials to \ndiscuss  the  Project,  resettlement  activities,  impact  of  the  Project,  mitigating  measures,  and  livelihood  improvements. \nConsultations were held with the affected communities to discuss reservoir inundation impacts, proposed resettlement sites, \nand  their  entitlements,  downstream  and  upstream  riverine  impacts  and  proposed  entitlements,  project  construction  land \nacquisition, and potential health impacts. Further consultation will be held during the implementation phase.    \n \n2.    What  level  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  envisaged  during  the  project  implementation  and \nmonitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nThe stakeholder analysis identified the various stakeholders and the rights, risks, and responsibilities at the initial stages of \nproject preparation (project preparatory technical assistance phase 1). A consultation plan was prepared based on the \nstakeholder analysis.  The consultation plan implemented during the PPTA phase II was based on the consultation plan and it \nwas implemented by a group of national consultants with expertise in consultations with ethnic minority communities. The total \nbudget for this component was approximately $100,000. \n \n \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nThe relocation and land acquisition of the Project pose a risk to women\u2019s social, economic, and health conditions. The women \nare  more  vulnerable  to  changes  in  the  physical  environment  and  changes  to  their  productive  resources  as  they  lack  social \ncoping  mechanisms.    The  Project  is  likely  to  disrupt  most  of  social  infrastructure  in  the  Zuoih  commune  due  to  relocation, \nespecially  the  health  and  education  services.  The  Project  will  also  result  in  Co  Tu  women  having  more  contacts  with \noutsiders,  including  construction  workers,  and  more  access  to  their  villages.  This  may  result  in  loss  of  cultural  identity  and \nexploitation of women including trafficking.   \n2.  Key  Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nSelection of resettlement sites will be carried out in consultation with women representatives from Co Tu villages. \nIn selection of resettlement sites, women\u2019s work in household subsistence will be given priority.  \n\n \n(i) \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n67 \n\nA  capacity  building  training  program  will  be  designed  for  effective  implementation  of  the  REMDP,  health  action \nplan,  and  community-based  forest  management  plan.  The  capacity  building  training  plan  will  include \nrepresentatives  from  district  and  commune  Women\u2019s  Unions,  and  women  representatives  from  affected \nhouseholds of reservoir inundated villages and the project construction area.  \n\n(iii)  Women will be consulted in designing village layout for social services and housing in the resettlement sites. \n(iv)  The district and commune level resettlement committees will include representatives from the Women\u2019s Union and \n\n(v) \n\nwomen from Co Tu ethnic minority groups. \nIn the resettlement sites for Co Tu villagers, land use rights for farming and user rights for forest products will be \nissued in the names of husband and wife.  \n\n(vi)  Extension  training  on  farming,  aquaculture,  animal  husbandry,  poultry,  community-based  forestry  development, \n\nand management activities will include women from Co Tu households. \n\n(vii)  The  grievance  committee  will  establish  a  mechanism  to  address  grievance  made  by  Co  Tu  women  in  the \nresettlement  sites;  similarly,  measures  to  address  women-specific  issues  will  be  included  in  the  grievance \ncommittee for the Project Lands Resettlement Committee. \n\n(viii)  The HIV/AIDS and trafficking awareness campaign will involve the Women\u2019s Union, Youth Union, Co Tu, women \nleaders  from  affected  households,  women  community  leaders  from  the  villages  around  construction  sites,  and \nwomen health workers. \n\n(ix)  The public health action plan will include information, education and communication materials on women\u2019s health, \n\ntaking into account ethnic cultural/practice.
