An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nAssessment  undertaken and its summary (SEIA) was circulated on 21 August \n2006.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project consists of the construction of a 156 megawatt (MW) \nhydropower  plant  in  the  Vu  Gia-Thu  Bon  river  basin  in \nQuang Nam province, central Viet Nam. A 110 meter (m) high \nroller compacted concrete (RCC) dam with a crest length of 367 m \nwill be built across the Song Bung river. The dam will form a \nreservoir with a surface area of 15.8 square kilometers (km2) at a \nfull  supply  level  of  222.5  m  above  sea  level.  Water  from  the \nreservoir will be conveyed through a 3.1 kilometer (km) tunnel to \nthe power station, and released along a short tailrace canal to the \nSong Bung river about 5 km downstream of the dam.  \n  \nThe Project is located in Nam Giang district (bordering the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic) of Quang Nam province in central \nViet Nam predominantly inhabited by indigenous people belonging \nto  the  Co  Tu  ethnic  minority.  The  Project  will  result  in  the \nrelocation of 206 mainly Co Tu households in Zuoih commune of \nNam Giang district. The Project is also located near to the Song \nThanh Nature Reserve, about 140 hectares (ha) of which will be \ninundated. \n \nComprehensive assessments of the Project\u2019s environmental and \nsocial impacts have been undertaken and appropriate mitigation \nmeasures  have  been  included  in  the  Project\u2019s  design.  These \ninclude  restoration  and  improvement  of  lost  livelihoods  in  a \nculturally  appropriate  manner  for  project-affected  persons, \nprovision  of  social  infrastructure,  and  conservation  offset  to \ncompensate  for  adverse  impacts  on  the  Song  Thanh  Nature \nReserve. \n \n ", "ii   \nRationale  Viet Nam has maintained a GDP growth rate of over 7.5% per \nyear during the last 10 years and has reduced the incidence of \npoverty from 58% in 1993 to less than 20% in 2007. This has \nbeen achieved through rapid industrialization and urbanization, \nwhich have increased demand for electricity. Electricity demand \nhas grown at an average rate of 15% per annum; it is forecast to \nmaintain the same rate until 2010 and then to fall to 11% by 2015. \n \nThe planned capacity addition for 2007\u20132017 is over 40,000 MW, \nof which over 13,000 MW is already under construction. The total \ninvestment  requirement  in  the  power  sector  for  2007\u20132012  is \nabout $24 billion. Of this amount, Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) plans \nto  make  an  investment  of  $16  billion;  non-EVN  investments, \nincluding from the private sector, are expected to be $8 billion. \nFinancing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) would bridge \nthe financing gap in the sector and complement financing from \nother sources. \n \nThe Project is the first hydropower project in Viet Nam to receive \nfinancing  from  a  multilateral  financial  institution.  It  has  been \ndesigned  to  address  environmental  and  social  impacts  in  a \nsustainable and socially inclusive manner. The Project will also \npromote integrated water resources management (IWRM) in the \nriver  basin  through  policy  dialogue  and  associated  technical \nassistance (TA). \n \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project\u2019s  impact  will  be  a  contribution  to  Viet  Nam\u2019s \nincreasing power demand in an environmentally sustainable and \nsocially inclusive manner.   \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  outcome  will  be  increased  power  generation \ncapacity  in  Quang  Nam  Province,  Central  Viet  Nam  and, \nmitigation of adverse environmental impacts, and restoration and \nimprovement of the livelihoods of project-affected persons.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The  total  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n$267.3 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Project is proposed to be financed using a combination of a \n$196.0 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR), \na loan equivalent to $22.3 million from Viet Nam Development \nBank, and a $49.0 million contribution from EVN financed through \ninternal cash generation.  \n ", "  iii\n  The  ADB  loan  of  $196  million  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon inter bank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum,  \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements.  \n \nAllocation and Relending  The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will act as the borrower for the \nTerms  ADB loan, which will be relent to EVN.  The Ministry of Finance \nwill levy a relending fee of 1.5 % on semiannual loan repayments \n(loan amortization plus interest).  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented by the Song Bung 4 Hydropower \nArrangements  management board, a project management board of EVN. The \nmanagement  board  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day \nmanagement of implementation of the Project under the overall \nsupervision  of  EVN.  The  technical  design  and  procurement  of \nmajor civil works contracts and equipment are subject to approval \nby EVN. The resettlement component will be carried out through a \ncommittee  consisting  of  representatives  from  the  management \nboard and the Nam Giang district people\u2019s committee reporting to \nQuang Nam province people\u2019s committee.   \n   \nExecuting Agency  Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) \n   \nProcurement  Civil works contracts and equipment to be financed under the loan \nwill  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).    \n   \nConsulting Services  The  loan  will  finance  the  following  consulting  services:  (i)  an \ninternational  firm  of  consultants  for  project  supervision  on \ntechnical, contractual, resettlement, and environmental aspects; \nand (ii) a national nongovernment organization or consultant firm \nfor independent monitoring of social and environment safeguards. \n \n  The  international  and  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  Government \nrequested  advance  action  for  recruitment  of  consultants  to \nminimize  delays  in  project  implementation.  ADB  has  approved \nadvance recruitment and informed the Government that this would \nnot commit ADB to financing the consultants.  \n \n ", "iv   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  help  to  meet  the  rapidly  growing  demand  for \nBeneficiaries  electricity  in  Viet  Nam.  The  availability  of  reliable  and  cheap \nelectricity  is  an  essential  prerequisite  if  Viet  Nam\u2019s  rapid  and \nsocially  inclusive  economic  growth  is  to  be  maintained  and \npoverty reduced. The Project will also improve the stability and \noverall  reliability  of  the  power  system,  and  further  reduce  the \ndependency of Viet Nam\u2019s power sector on fossil fuels, with their \nassociated greenhouse gas emissions.  The project will result in \ncarbon  emission  reductions  because  it  will  replace  fossil-fuel- \nbased power generation.  \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  accessibility  to  and  common \ninfrastructure facilities of hitherto remote areas in Quang Nam \nprovince. The livelihood improvement component of the Project \nwill  improve  the  well-being  of  project-affected  persons  who \ncurrently depend on subsistence livelihoods.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The main technical risks of the Project relate to the design and \nconstruction of the 110 m high concrete dam and the geotechnical \nrisks of the dam site, power plant site, and alignment of the tunnel. \nThe geotechnical condition of the project site is good and is not \nexpected  to  cause  major  problems  during  construction  or \noperation. Adequate contingency provisions have been included \nin the cost estimates to deal with possible cost overruns caused \nby technical risks. The amount of electricity to be generated by the \nProject  depends  on  the  hydrology  of  the  river;  this  has  been \nthoroughly assessed and the implications of reduced inflows on \nelectricity  output  have  been  incorporated  into  the  sensitivity \nanalysis. \n \nThe Project also depends on the overall financial viability of the \npower sector. Viet Nam\u2019s power sector is currently undergoing \nrapid expansion to meet the high forecast demand growth rate \nand any drop in the growth rate caused by an economic slowdown \nis likely to result in surplus capacity in 2010\u20132015. The increasing \ndebt service commitment and likely increase in fossil fuel prices \n(Viet Nam  is  a  net  exporter  of  fossil  fuel)  may  also  require \nsustained tariff increases to maintain the viability of the sector. \n \nThe social risks of the Project relate to the implementation risk of \nthe resettlement and ethnic minority development plan, especially \nthe livelihood improvement plan for affected people. A grant of \n$2 million,  financed  through  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction,  will  be  provided  to  finance  livelihood  improvement \nactivities that are beyond current government practice.  \n ", "  v\n  The environmental issues relate to the adverse impact on aquatic \n  species  caused  by  changes  to  flow  regime  in  the  river  and \nincreased access to Song Thanh Nature Reserve because of the \nProject.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  has \nrecommended appropriate measures to minimize these impacts. \nHowever, proper implementation of the EMP during the operations \nphase of the Project remains a risk that needs to be addressed \nthrough the monitoring mechanisms of the Government and ADB. \n \n \n ", "", "Da Nang\nSOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM\nSg.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project. The country strategy \nand  program  update  for  2006\u201320081 included  the  Project.  ADB  has  approved  two  technical \nassistance (TA) grants to prepare the Project .2 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Macroeconomic  Performance  and  Linkages  with  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s socioeconomic development since 1993 has been remarkable. The country\u2019s \nsuccess in reducing poverty level from 58% in 1993 to less than 20% in 2007 is unprecedented. \nDuring this period, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has increased from $288 to $850 and \neconomic growth has averaged 7.5% per year with the growth rate for 2007 reaching 8.5%. The \nstructure of the economy has been transformed since 1993\u2014the share of the energy-intensive \nindustry and service sectors has increased at the expense of the agriculture sector. The high \neconomic growth has been underpinned by robust and sustainable levels of investment equal to \n40%  of  GDP  in  2007.  An  increasing  share  of  investment,  especially  in  the  manufacturing \nindustries and service sector, has been made by the private sector. Foreign direct investment \napprovals exceeded $20 billion in 2007, an increase of over 80% compared with 2006. \n \n3.  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  maintaining  its  impressive  record  of  sustainable  and \nsocially inclusive economic growth is outlined in the Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) \nfor 2006\u20132010 approved by the National Assembly in May 2006. The SEDP acknowledges the \ncritical importance of private sector participation, good governance, and integration with the global \neconomy  through,  among  others,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  membership  of  the  World  Trade  Organization. \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program for Viet Nam 2007\u201320103 supports the key objectives of the \nSEDP  in  achieving  a  balance  between  business-led  economic  growth,  social  equity,  and \nenvironmental sustainability while strengthening the governance of public sector institutions and \nsupporting private sector investments in the productive sectors of the economy. The country \nstrategy and program identifies the critical importance of removing infrastructure bottlenecks in \nthe energy and transport sectors to further increase the competitiveness of Viet Nam\u2019s private-\nsector-led manufacturing and service sectors.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Major Challenges Facing the Power and Energy Sectors \na.  Meeting Rapidly Increasing Demand   \n4.  The key challenge facing the power sector is maintaining adequate investments to meet \nthe rapid growth in demand. The performance of Viet Nam\u2019s power sector and the government\u2019s \npower sector strategy  is described in Appendix 2. The  projected power generation capacity \naddition during 2007\u20132017 (Table 1) is over 40,000 megawatts (MW), of which over 13,000 MW \nare under construction and will be commissioned by 2012. Managing an expansion program that \nis expected to increase the system capacity by more than four times within 10 years will be a \nmajor challenge for the institutions in the power sector. EVN will undertake more than half of the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Viet Nam Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008). Manila. \n2  ADB. 2005.

The remaining investments will be made by joint ventures between \nstate-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  such  as  EVN,  Vinacomin,  PetroVietnam  and  private  sector \ninvestors, and private sector investments without SOE participation. Private sector investments \nwill be focused on thermal power generation and medium-sized and small hydropower plants and \nrenewable energy plants.   \n \n5.  The Government is keen to reduce Viet Nam\u2019s energy intensity (0.66 tons of oil equivalent \n[toe] per $1,000 GDP) to a level similar to those of its neighbors (0.40 toe per $1,000 GDP in \nMalaysia and 0.38 toe per $1,000 GDP in Thailand). The Government has formulated a national \nenergy efficiency and conservation program, consisting of economic incentives, capacity building \nand administrative measures, and time-bound efficiency targets.  Although the program covers all \nsectors of the economy it focuses on the rapidly expanding industrial sector. The objectives of the \nProgram  are  (i)  to  establish  energy  efficiency  programs  at  60%  of  large  and  medium-sized \nenergy-consuming consumers; (ii) to formulate an energy-efficiency building code; (iii) to achieve \na 3\u20135 % reduction in national energy consumption and a 5% reduction in industrial energy \nconsumption by 2010; and (iv) to achieve a 5\u20138 % reduction in national energy consumption and \nan 8% reduction in industrial energy consumption by 2015 per unit of economic output.  \n \nTable 1: Projected Capacity Additions to Viet Nam Power System, 2007\u20132015 \n(megawatt)\n \nType of Plant  2007\u20132012  2013\u20132017  Total \n  EVN  Non-EVN  EVN  Non-EVN   \nHydro   3,000       1,500  5,300  1,900  11,700 \nCoal     900    3,800  10,800  5,100    20,600 \nNatural Gas/  600     2,800    2,700    6,100  \nFurnace Oil  \nSmall Hydro and    350    1,000  1,350 \nRenewable \nImport    500    1,400  1,900 \nTotal  4,600  8,950  16,100  12,100  41,650 \nEVN = Viet Nam Electricity. \nSource:  Institute of Energy, Viet Nam \n \nb.

The total investment requirement in the power sector for 2007\u20132012 will be about $24 \nbillion, of which EVN will invest $16 billion and others will invest about $8 billion. A similar level of \ninvestment  is  expected  to  be  maintained  for  the  period  2013\u20132017.  The  net  internal  cash ", "     3\ngeneration of EVN for the period 2007\u20132012 is expected to be about $9 billion, and its net \nborrowings to be about $7 billion. EVN is increasingly resorting to borrowing on commercial terms \nfrom export credit agencies and from ADB on ordinary capital resources (OCR) terms. The World \nBank is also considering lending to EVN on OCR equivalent terms. EVN also intends to raise \nfunding in the international and domestic capital markets through a series of bond issues.  \n \n8.  Since its creation, EVN has been profitable and has financed the rapid expansion of \nViet Nam\u2019s electricity sector without resorting to significant fiscal subsidies. The key financial \nperformance indicators; debt service cover ratio, self-financing ratio, and receivables have been \nmaintained within prudential limits while the average end user tariff had been maintained at \n$0.051 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) until 2007. The average tariff was increased at the beginning of \n2007 to $0.053/kWh and a further tariff increase of 5% is expected in the second half of 2008. \nSustained tariff increases are required to maintain adequate levels of debt service coverage and \nfinancing new investments because of increasing debt financing and financial obligations for \npower purchase from independent power producers (IPP).  \n \nc.  Environmental and Social Issues  \n9.  The  rapid  expansion  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  sector  will  inevitably  result  in  significant \nenvironmental and social impacts. The addition of over 20,000 MW of coal power generation \ncapacity will contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions. However, the current level of per \ncapita greenhouse gas emissions in Viet Nam is among the lowest in the world. Supercritical and \nultra-supercritical boiler technologies can help to increase efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions per kWh produced. The Government is keen on applying these advanced technologies \nand has taken a decision that new coal power plants using imported coal will use supercritical \nboiler  technologies.  Hydropower  projects  involve  significant  resettlement  and  environment \nimpacts. The Government has strengthened its approach to mitigation of social and environmental \nimpacts  through  improved  compensation,  resettlement,  and  rehabilitation  arrangements  for \nproject-affected  persons.  The  Government  also  supports  the  enactment  of  legislation  to \nmainstream the benefit sharing of hydropower projects with the affected communities based on \nthe recommendations of ADB TA.4  \n \n2.

The two OCR loans approved in 2004 and 2005 finance expansion of the 500 kV high \nvoltage transmission system in northern Viet Nam. More recently ADB has focused on power \ngeneration. For example the Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power Project (footnote 5) is financing \npower generation facilities using domestic coal in an environmentally sustainable manner.  ADB \nhas also supported private sector investment in power generation by providing direct loans and \npolitical risk guarantees for the Phu My 2.2 gas-fired power project in 2002 and the Phu My 3 \nproject in 2003. 8 During 2005 and 2006, ADB approved a series of advisory TA (ADTA) projects9 \nto improve the crosscutting social and environmental issues of the power sector, and three project \npreparatory TA (PPTA) projects to prepare the current Project and the Mong Duong, and O Mon \nthermal power projects (the latter two projects are to be implemented in a phased manner by EVN \nand the private sector).10 ADB approved an ADTA to assist the Ministry of Industry and Trade \n(MOIT) to implement the national program on energy efficiency and conservation.

External Assistance to the Power Sector \n13.  In addition to ADB, the major supporters of the power sector are the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC), the World Bank, the French Development Agency (AFD), and \nthe  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  (Sida).  Since  1993,  JBIC  has \ncommitted about \u00a5400 billion to the power sector, mainly for power generation. Since 1995, the \nWorld Bank has approved over $1.3 billion of International Development Association (IDA) credits \nto  the  sector  for  expanding  the  transmission  network  and  rural  electrification.  More  recent \nWorld Bank projects focus on the institutional aspects of rural power supply. Sida has financed \nthe equipment for the Song Hinh hydropower cascade. AFD cofinanced the Northern Power \nTransmission Sector Project (footnote 5). External assistance to Viet Nam power sector is listed in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n4.  Lessons on Hydropower Development \n14.  In  2000,  the  World  Commission  on  Dams  (WCD)  published  a  global  review  of  dam \nprojects. While recognizing the important contribution of dams, the report highlighted several \nshortcomings\u2014including  high  variability  in  delivering  predicted  outcomes,  impoverishment  of \naffected communities, and limited success in dealing with environmental impacts. Although such \nproblems  are  often  attributed  to  project  planning,  ineffective  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures  during  the  operation  phase  also  contributed.  An  evaluation  of  four  hydropower \nprojects13 undertaken by ADB, also concluded that many problems were associated with project \nplanning; and attributed them to weak public participation, inadequate attention to environmental \nprotection  measures  and  monitoring,  and  lack  of  attention  to  livelihood  restoration.  Post-\nevaluation of the Nam Leuk hydropower project14 in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR) raised a number of issues that went beyond the physical implementation timetable of the \nproject, including how to replace lost fisheries and provide clean water supplies to affected \ncommunities.  \n \n15.  Many of these lessons are reflected in ADB\u2019s framework of social, environmental, and \nsector policies\u2014in particular, the identification of project-specific and cumulative impacts, and the \ndesign of mitigation measures. During the preparation of the Project, extensive consultations were \nundertaken and alternative mitigation options were explored with local communities. Livelihood \ndevelopment measures were proposed to cover upstream and downstream communities to offset \nany loss of income due to adverse impacts on fisheries. Links were established to complementary \ndonor-financed programs such as the Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative15 to provide an \nintegrated approach to environmental mitigation. At a policy level, longer term support to local \ncommunities is being explored with the Government through proposed ADB TA on a benefit \nsharing arrangement for project-affected communities (footnote 4). \n \n5.  ADB Sector Strategy  \n16.  Socially  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  economic  growth  is  a  key  pillar  in \nADB\u2019s country strategy for Viet Nam. The competitiveness of Viet Nam\u2019s economy, especially the \nindustrial sector, depends on the availability of a cheap and reliable supply of electricity. ADB\u2019s \npower sector strategy aims to help the Government to meet the challenge of increasing demand \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2002.

The  large \ninvestment  requirement  of  the  power  sector  ($2.5  billion\u2013$3.5  billion  per  annum)  requires \nconcerted efforts from both public and private sector investors and a significant proportion of \npublic sector investments have to be financed through multilateral or bilateral financing.  With the \nGovernment\u2019s  strong  drive  to  increase  the  share  of  renewable  energy  in  total  electricity \ngeneration, and with the low prevalence of renewable energy in Viet Nam\u2019s current electricity \ngeneration mix, opportunities for financing renewable energy and energy efficiency investments \nwill be actively pursued. The key aspects of ADB\u2019s sector strategy are summarized below.   \n \na.  Mobilizing Financial Resources for the Power Sector \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s interventions in the power sector will focus on financing environmentally sustainable \npower generation and high voltage transmission lines, including links between Viet Nam and other \nGreater Mekong Subregion countries. While ADB finances hydropower projects as public sector \ninvestments, it will play a catalytic role in mobilizing private sector investment for thermal power \ngeneration. This approach is consistent with the Government\u2019s strategy of financing hydropower \nprojects as public sector investments because of their multipurpose nature and long gestation \nperiod, and attracting private investments in partnership with the public sector for thermal power \nplants. An example is the Mong Duong Thermal Power Project (2,200 MW), structured as a \npublic\u2013private partnership in which phase 1 and the common facilities will be implemented by \nEVN with ADB OCR financing (footnote 5) and phase 2 will be implemented by a private sector \ninvestor with possible ADB support through the Private Sector Operations Department.   \n \nb.  Mobilizing Financial Resources to the Power Sector \n18.  ADB will also increasingly leverage co-financing from other financiers in the sector. This \nwill include (i) providing political risk and partial credit guarantees, (ii) acting as lender of record \nunder a complementary financing scheme, and (iii) providing guarantees to export credit agencies \nand other commercial financiers to mitigate political and other risks of a project. ADB will also \nassist public sector entities in the sector to access international capital markets by providing \nadvisory and risk-sharing instruments under the innovation and efficiency initiative. \n \nc.  Improving the Regulatory Framework of the Power Sector \n19.  Starting in 1997, ADB has played a catalytic role in Viet Nam\u2019s power sector reform \nprogram through several technical assistance grants. ADB has an ongoing Power Market Design \nTA (footnote 7) to provide further assistance to MOIT to establish the basic framework for the \nproposed electricity market and for capacity building of the electricity regulator. ADB will provide \ntargeted TA to MOIT in close collaboration with other donors active in the sector. The World Bank \nand AFD are also actively involved in assisting the Government with power sector reform.    \n \nd.  Dealing with Environmental and Social Issues \n20.  The investment projects need to be coupled with policy dialogue to improve the social and \nenvironmental  sustainability  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  generation  expansion  program.  ADB  has \nprovided  targeted  TA  (footnote 9)  to  sector  entities  and  national  and  provincial  enforcement \nagencies to deal with adverse impacts at both national and project level. The objectives of the TA \nare general capacity building in strategic and cumulative environment assessment, livelihood \nimprovement,  and  exploring  possible  revenue  sharing  mechanisms  with  project-affected \ncommunities. ADB will actively promote the adoption of clean and more efficient technologies for \nnew power generating projects, particularly supercritical and ultra-supercritical technologies for \ncoal-fired  power  plants  and  combined  cycle  gas-fired  power  plants.  Regional  technical ", "     7\nassistance16 will enhance the capability of power utility staff and provincial officials in preparing \nenvironment impact assessments and implementing and monitoring environment management \nplans.   \n \ne.  Promoting Investments in Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \n21.  ADB  has  not  directly  financed  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  projects  in \nViet Nam, partly because such projects are small. However, in the context of ADB\u2019s new initiatives \non energy efficiency and the clean energy, ADB will play an important role in promoting renewable \nenergy and energy efficiency investments by providing TA as well as loans and guarantees for \ndevelopers and facilitating access to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Access to debt \nfinancing for both renewable energy and energy efficiency investments has been identified by \nproject developers as a constraint. ADB will work with domestic financing institutions to address \nthis issue through appropriately designed lending or guarantee products and policy interventions \nmaking use of the resources and expertise available at ADB through the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility and Carbon Market Initiative. In this regard ADB is providing policy advice to \nMOIT on promoting energy efficiency in the industrial sector (footnote 11). Recently ADB has \nbeen requested by MOIT to assist in electrifying 400 remote communes using off-grid renewable \nenergy  technologies  and  to  draft  a  renewable  energy  law  to  establish  the  legal  and  policy \nframework for renewable energy investments.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n22.  The impact of the proposed Project will be to contribute to meeting Viet Nam\u2019s electricity \ndemand with reliable and economical sources of electricity generation using the country\u2019s natural \nresources. The Project will also set an example for environmentally sustainable and socially \ninclusive hydropower development. The outcome of the Project is increased power generation \ncapacity in Quang Nam Province, Central Viet Nam and, mitigation of adverse environmental \nimpacts, and restoration and improvement of the livelihoods of project-affected persons. The \nDesign and Monitoring Framework of the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Outputs \n1.  Construction of the Hydroelectric Plant and Related Infrastructure \n23.  The project site is in the central province of Quang Nam, about 950 km south of Hanoi. \nThe Project includes the construction of a 156 MW hydropower plant on the Bung river, a tributary \nof the Vu Gia river. The Project forms a cascade with the proposed Song Bung 2 hydropower \nproject  (located  upstream  of  the  Project)  and  Song  Bung  5  hydropower  project  (located \ndownstream of the Project). A 110 meter (m) high roller compacted concrete (RCC) dam will \ncapture the flow of water from the watershed of the Bung river, creating a reservoir of 15.8 square \nkilometers (km2) surface area in Zuoih and Ta Bhing communes of Nam Giang district in Quang \nNam province. Water from the reservoir will be conveyed through a 3.1 kilometer (km) tunnel and \nwill drop about 26 m to an aboveground power house. The water discharged from the power \nhouse will be returned through a short tailrace canal to the Song Bung river, 5 km downstream of \nthe dam. The Project will also include a double-circuit 220-kV transmission line about 35 km long \nfrom the power house to Thanh My in Nam Giang district. On average, 491 gigawatt-hours (GWh) \nof power will be provided annually to the EVN grid. The main infrastructure components consist of \nthe concrete dam with integral gated spillway; intake structure, headrace tunnel, surge shaft, \npressure shaft, and pressure tunnel in the underground works; a power house consisting of two \n                                                 \n16 ADB.  2007.

Resettlement of Affected Communities \n24.  The  reservoir  will  result  in  the  inundation  of  four  villages  and  the  relocation  of  \n206 households, including the center of Zuoih commune in Nam Giang district\u2014one of the most \nremote and mountainous communes in the district. The reservoir will flood the agricultural land of \n52 households in two other villages in Ta Binh commune. The affected persons belong to the Co \nTu ethnic minority group and over 70% of them are below the national poverty line. For the \nrelocating  villages,  the  Project  will  provide  new  resettlement  sites,  including  associated \ninfrastructure (such as access roads) and better common facilities (such as schools and health \nfacilities); and provide assistance to restore and improve the livelihoods in a culturally sensitive \nmanner. The proposed resettlement sites are in the same commune and have been selected on \nthe basis of a thorough analysis of the potential for improving the livelihoods of affected persons \nbased on upland and wet rice cultivation, collection of non-timber forestry products, livestock, and \nfishponds. EVN will finance infrastructure facilities, including housing, agriculture and livestock \ninputs,  transitional  cash  allowances,  and  cash  compensation  for  lost  assets  according  to \nprevailing government regulations. A complementary grant of $2 million financed by Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction (JFPR) will finance enhanced livelihood improvement, including capacity \nbuilding for project-affected persons, which goes beyond current government practices.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Reflecting International Good Practice in Hydropower Development  \n25.  A number of initiatives have been proposed to address the social, environmental, and \ngovernance  problems  often  associated  with  the  planning  and  implementation  of  hydropower \nprojects.17 These have been considered during the preparation of the Project, in the context of \nViet  Nam,  including  initial  screening  of  different  generation  and  site  options  in  the  National \nHydropower Plan Study18, assessment of alternative design and layout configurations, and the \ninclusion of mitigation measures for projected social and environmental impacts in the project \ndesign. A checklist of the Project\u2019s conformity with ADB\u2019s water policy19 and integrated water \nresources management (IWRM) principles is in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n26.  A development-oriented objective\u2014in which the primary aim is to improve the livelihoods \nof those adversely affected\u2014underlies the approach to mitigating negative social impacts. This \nwill be achieved through a range of project-specific interventions targeted at both household and \ncommunity levels, as set out in the Project\u2019s resettlement and ethnic minority development plan \n(REMDP). In addition, at the policy level, ADB is supporting ERAV\u2019s program to develop long-term \narrangements to direct project benefits at affected communities through the TA on benefit sharing \nmechanisms  for  people  adversely  affected  by  power  generation  projects  (footnote  4).  The \nREMDP, the environmental impact assessment (EIA), and the environmental management plan \n(EMP),  incorporate  clear  statements  on  the  entitlements  of  affected  persons,  resettlement \nprocedures, environmental mitigation actions, responsibilities for implementation, and budgets.  \n \n2.  Integrated Water Resources Management in the river Basin  \n27.  The National Water Resources Strategy of Viet Nam, supported by ADB,20 incorporates \nthe principles of IWRM and reflects the Government\u2019s commitment to development of IWRM \n                                                 \n17 These include the recommendations to improve development outcomes prepared by WCD, and the Sustainability \nGuidelines and Compliance Protocol of the International Hydropower Association. \n18 Joint venture SWECO International, Statkraft Groner and Norplan/Electricity of Vietnam. 2007.

Facilitation and technical support is \nprovided through a pilot demonstration activity funded by ADB\u2019s Water Cooperation Fund.  \n \n28.  In parallel with the proposed Project, TA has been provided to the Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment (MONRE) and Quang Nam Provincial authorities in capacity building \nfor strategic environment assessment (SEA) of the hydropower sector (footnote 9). The Vu Gia-\nThu Bon river basin, where the proposed Project is located, has been selected for testing the \nmethodologies to be developed under the TA for strategic environment assessment. The pilot \nstudy has taken into account the impacts of all seven proposed hydropower projects23 in the river \nbasin.    The  project-specific  recommendations  of  the  SEA  will  be  incorporated  into  the \nEnvironment Management Plan of the Project as appropriate.  \n \n3.  Consultations and Disclosure \n29.  Initial consultations on overall hydropower development in Viet Nam were held at national, \nprovincial, river basin levels. Consultations were also held in sample districts, communes, and \nvillages  as  part  of  the  preparation  of  the  National  Hydropower  Plan.    These  consultations \ndiscussed the need for specific hydropower projects, including the Song Bung 4 Hydropower \nProject, in relation to national development goals, alternative layouts, expected project impacts, \nand associated mitigation measures. The stakeholder analysis was further refined during the \nPPTA phase I (footnote 2), using an approach based on the rights, risks, and responsibilities of \nthe various stakeholder groups.  \n \n30.  These initial consultations formed the foundation of an extensive and detailed participation \nstrategy implemented during preparation of the REMDP, covering project-affected communities in \nthe reservoir, both upstream and downstream, and agencies at district and provincial levels. The \nbasic principles were inclusiveness and openness, encouragement of active participation, cultural \nand gender sensitivity, and meaningful participation in the design of mitigation measures. Outputs \nfrom the consultations in the villages included informed decisions on the location of resettlement \nvillages, village and house design, and components of the livelihood development programs.  \n \n31.  Three stakeholder workshops were held in relation to the environmental assessment of the \nProject to solicit input to the environment assessment process and provide feedback on the initial \nfindings and mitigation proposals. The first and third meetings were held in Nam Giang district; the \nsecond meeting was held in the provincial capital of Tam Ky and included representatives from \nQuang Nam province and Da Nang City. The consultations reflected the provisions of national \nregulatory  requirements  and  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies,  and  provided  an  opportunity  for \nstakeholders to give feedback on the need for and implications of the Project in line with the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy.  The  REMDP  and  SEIA  have  been  made  available  to \naffected communities in the Vietnamese language and posted on the internet.  \n \n4.  Benefit Sharing with Affected Communities   \n32.  Policy dialogue between ADB and the Government on the principle of sharing the benefits \nof hydropower development with local communities has been undertaken through the TA on \n                                                 \n21  Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment. 2006.

ADB Management has approved a change in scope \nto the TA on benefit-sharing for this purpose and the guidelines will be finalized in the form of a \ndecree to be issued by MOIT based on the lessons learned from the pilot test. \n \n5.  Environmental Management Plan  \n33.  A summary of the EMP is included in the summary environmental impact assessment \n(SEIA), and the detailed EMP is included in the EIA. The SEIA is in Supplementary Appendix B \nand the EIA is in Supplementary Appendix C. The main environmental Issues are summarized in \nAppendix  11.  The  SEIA  was  first  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  21  August  2006. \nImplementation of the EMP is the responsibility of the implementing agency (IA), and a dedicated \nenvironmental management unit (EMU) will be set up in the IA for this purpose. The key aspects \nof the EMP are as follows. \n \n(i)  Construction phase. Controlling soil erosion and siltation, maintaining the water \nquality of the river, minimizing the loss of flora during construction, and controlling \nwildlife trading and hunting by construction workers.  \n(ii)  Operation  phase.  Maintaining  water  quality,  operating  Song  Bung  5  when \nconstructed as a daily reregulating reservoir to minimize water level fluctuations \ndownstream and reduce impacts on aquatic life, strengthening the capacity of \nSong Thanh Nature Reserve management board to control illegal logging and \nhunting caused by the increased access to the reserve, and better management of \nthe watershed to minimize soil erosion. \n \n6.  Social Safeguard Issues \n34.  The Project is located in one of the poorest and most remote parts of central Viet Nam \n(Nam  Giang  district of  Quang  Nam  province),  predominantly  inhabited  by  the Co  Tu  ethnic \nminority who have had little contact with the mainstream Kinh people. The Co Tu people maintain \na  traditional  lifestyle  based  on  subsistence  agriculture  and  collection  of  non-timber  forest \nproducts,  which  provides  most  of  their  cash  income.  The  Project  will  result  in  the  physical \nrelocation of four Co Tu villages in Zuoih commune\u2014comprising 206 households, the loss of a \nsignificant portion of agricultural land, and the commune center housing the school and health \ncenter. The Project will also affect the agricultural lands of three other communes (Ta Binh, Ca \nDy, and Thanh My) with majority Co Tu populations because of land acquisition for construction \nsites and the transmission line associated with the Project. It is estimated that a further 1,500\u2013\n2,000 Kinh households in the neighboring Dai Loc district will have their livelihoods affected \nbecause of the expected reduction in fishing in the Song Bung river.  \n \n35.  The  Project  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB  safeguards,  including  the \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy24 and the Policy on Indigenous Peoples25. As the majority of the \nsignificantly affected persons belong to the Co Tu ethnic minority, indigenous peoples\u2019 issues \nhave been mainstreamed into the resettlement plan and a combined resettlement and ethnic \nminority development plan (REMDP) has been prepared for the Project. This reflects the outcome \nof extensive consultations with affected persons, and emphasizes maintaining traditional culture \nand  improving  livelihoods.  A  participatory  implementation  arrangement  for  resettlement  is \n                                                 \n24  ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement Policy. Manila. \n25  ADB. 1998. Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila. ", "    1 1\nproposed in the REMDP, with the active participation of affected persons, local officials, the IA, \nand the consultants to be provided under the JFPR grant that will be implemented concurrently \nwith the Project. The REMDP is in Supplementary Appendix A and is summarized in Appendix 10; \nthe summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. The gender action plan to \naddress  negative  impacts  of  the  Project  on  women  and  to  maximize  benefits  to  women  is \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix D. The detailed gender action plan is in Supplementary \nAppendix  E  and  the  Construction  Phase  Social  Management  Plan  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix G.   \n \n7.  Enhanced Livelihoods Program for Affected People (JFPR Grant) \n36.  Although  recent  national  legislation  on  involuntary  resettlement  (prepared  with  ADB \nassistance) stipulates that poor and vulnerable resettled persons should be assisted to improve \ntheir livelihoods in a sustainable manner, current practice in Viet Nam is limited to the provision of \nagricultural  inputs  such  as  seeds,  fertilizer,  and  livestock  for  12 months,  and  rice  and  food \nallowances for up to 3 years. While ADB\u2019s policies and the Government\u2019s legislation have similar \nobjectives of improving conditions for the poor and vulnerable, the approaches to resettlement \nand  ethnic  minority  planning  and  implementation  differ  significantly.    EVN  is  committed  to \nfinancing preparation of resettlement sites, including associated village infrastructure, housing and \ncommunity  facilities,  cash  compensation  for  lost  assets,  transitional  cash  allowances  and \nlivelihood support in accordance with current government standards.    \n \n37.  An enhanced livelihood improvement support program has been proposed in the REMDP \nand activities that go beyond current government practices will be financed through the proposed \nJFPR grant of $2 million. This will provide an example for future resettlement as a result of \nhydropower projects, as Viet Nam is embarking on a large hydropower program (over 20 projects \nto be built in 2006\u20132015) affecting over 150,000 people, most of whom belong to poor and \nvulnerable ethnic minorities.  \n \n8.  Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) \n38.  As  the  Project  involves  significant  financial  commitments  to  mitigate  the  social  and \nenvironmental impacts, its financial rate of return is not as attractive as those of other hydropower \nprojects financed by EVN. As a result, EVN is seeking additional revenues through the CDM to \nimprove the financial viability of the Project. The Project qualifies as a CDM project under the \napproved methodology of the CDM executive board as the power density of the Project (i.e., the \nratio between installed generation capacity in MW and the surface area of the reservoir at full \nsupply  level  in  sq.  km)  is  greater  than  4.  A  project  design  document  will  be  prepared  for \nsubmission to the CDM Executive Board. A brief CDM assessment report has been prepared and \nis attached as Supplementary Appendix I.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n39.  The project investment cost is estimated at $267.3 million equivalent, including taxes and \nduties of $15.2 million. The project cost estimate is summarized in Table 3, and detailed cost \nestimates, including the financing source for each component, are provided in Appendix 4. \n   \n ", "12   \nTable 3: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nA.

Financing Plan \n40.  The Government has requested a loan of $196.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The interest on the ADB loan during construction will be \ncapitalized and the taxes on ADB-financed procurement contracts will be financed by the loan. \nThe inclusion of taxes in loan financing for Viet Nam was approved by ADB Management on 27 \nJune 2007. The Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will be the borrower and the proceeds of the loan \nwill be relent to EVN with a re-lending rate equivalent to OCR rate plus 1.5% of semiannual loan \nrepayment (loan amortization plus interest). The ADB loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such \nother terms and conditions as are set forth in the loan agreement. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for the decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that this choice was its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \nResettlement costs, including the access roads to resettlement sites, will be financed by a loan \nequivalent to $22.3 million from Viet Nam Development Bank. Financing by EVN will amount to \n$49.0 million and will be funded through its internal cash generation. The analysis of EVN\u2019s cash \nflows shows that EVN has sufficient cash flows for this purpose.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n41.  EVN will be the Executing Agency (EA) responsible for implementation of the Project \nthrough the Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project management board (the management board), \nwhich will be the IA. The management board was created by transferring staff from the former \nHydropower Project Management Unit No. 3, which was responsible for implementing hydropower \nprojects located in central Viet Nam and has successfully implemented the Song Hinh hydropower \nproject, financed by Sida. It was also involved in project management of four other hydropower \nprojects, including two projects presently under construction.  The key technical staff of the \nmanagement  board  will  be  exclusively  engaged  in  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  The \nmanagement board has about 45 employees, including specialists in engineering, environment, \nresettlement,  economics,  and  finance.  It  will  coordinate  and  monitor  all  project  construction \nactivities,  including  mobilization  of  design  and  supervision  consultants,  preparation  of  bid \ndocuments, bid evaluation, construction supervision, and approving payments to contractors. The \ntechnical design, bid documents, and contract award are subject to approval by the EVN head \noffice. The main findings of financial management assessment are summarized in Appendix 9.  \n \n42.     The  environment  and  social  division  of  the  management  board  is  responsible  for  the \nenvironmental and social aspects of the Project. Prior to the commencement of construction work, \nthe management board will set up an environment management unit (EMU) to implement the \nEMP, including environment monitoring during the construction phase of the Project. The EMU \nwill be supported by the supervision consultants. A resettlement management and implementation \nunit (RMIU) will be established, consisting of management board staff and representatives from \nNam Giang district people\u2019s committee, and assisted by JFPR-financed consultants to manage \nthe implementation of REMDP, including the livelihood improvement of affected people.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n43.  Project  implementation  began  immediately  after  the  Government\u2019s  approval  of  the \nfeasibility study in August 2007. EVN has recruited a national consulting firm using its own funds \nto undertake the detailed technical design of the Project and to prepare the bidding documents. In \nparallel with the technical design, recruitment of ADB-financed consultants for implementation \nsupervision has begun under advance action procedures. It is expected that the technical design \nwill be completed by September 2008 and approved by December 2008. The ADB-financed \nconsultants\u2019 implementation supervision will be mobilized by December 2008. Pre-qualification of \ncontractors for major civil works will also be undertaken in 2008. Bid documents will be issued in \nJanuary 2009 to pre-qualified contractors and contracts will be awarded in December 2009. The \nmain construction work will begin in January 2010. The preparatory civil works, including access \nroads to main project sites and resettlement site preparation, will be undertaken in 2009 using \nlocal contractors financed by EVN and the relocation of affected people will be completed by \n2012. The major civil works will be completed by middle of 2013, and reservoir filling will be \nundertaken from June 2013 to September 2013. Commissioning will be completed by December \n2013. The detailed implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.  \n ", "14   \n \n3.  Procurement \n44.  Procurement of works, goods, and services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The major civil works have been divided into \ntwo  packages  to  be  procured  using  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures.  The \nequipment  component  is  divided  into  two  packages  and  will  also  be  procured  using  ICB \nprocedures. Small civil works contracts partly or wholly financed by ADB and costing up to $3 \nmillion will be procured using national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to ADB \nand will be subject to selective post-review. ICB procedures will be used for procurement of \nequipment and goods with a contract price exceeding $1,000,000. NCB procedures will be used \nfor contracts less than $1,000,000. Shopping will be authorized for procurement of goods and \nequipment with a contract price less than $100,000. The procurement plan26 for the Project is in \nAppendix 5 and the National Competitive Bidding procedures applicable to Viet Nam are in \nSupplementary Appendix J.  \n \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n45.  A total of 131 person-months of international consultants and 1,009 person-months of \nnational consultants will be required during the implementation of the Project.  These consultants \nwill be financed under the loan and will be recruited and engaged by EVN in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). There will be \ntwo ADB-financed consulting service contracts as set out below. \n \n(i)  Implementation supervision will consist of (a) a review of bid documents and bid \nevaluation, (d) contract negotiation, (c) construction supervision and management, \nincluding support for implementing the EMP during construction. The terms of \nreference  for  the  construction  supervision  consultants  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix F and summarized in Appendix 14. These services will be obtained \nthrough an international firm of consultants to be recruited using quality and cost-\nbased  selection  (QCBS)  and  will  require  131  person-months  of  international \nconsultants and 949 person-months of national consultants.  \n \nWith respect to national consultancy requirements, the consulting service industry \nin Viet Nam is still in its development stage. There are no private consulting firms \nspecializing in hydropower projects that would be capable of providing the large \nand specialized consulting inputs required for the Project. The national consultants \nare therefore to be recruited through engineering consulting firms affiliated with \nEVN. These firms are incorporated as separate corporate entities with complete \nfinancial independence. EVN\u2019s role is limited to that of the majority shareholder. \nSince  they  were  not  engaged  in  developing  the  terms  of  reference  for  the \nsupervision  consulting  services,  there  will  be  no  conflict  of  interest  in  their \nundertaking  construction  supervision.  Accordingly,  consortia  or  joint  ventures \nconsisting of international consulting firms and EVN-affiliated consulting firms will \nbe considered for the provision of consultancy services. \n \n(ii)  An independent monitoring agency will be engaged using fixed budget selection to \nundertake  independent  monitoring  of  the  effectiveness  of  implementing  the \nsafeguard documents (REMDP and EIA/EMP). This will require 60 person-months \nof national consultancy services.   \n \n                                                 \n26  The Borrower has submitted and ADB has approved the procurement plan for the next 18 months. This will be \nupdated annually or as necessary. ", "    1 5\n5.  Advance Action \n46.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  for  advance  action  to  expedite  the \nrecruitment  of  consultants,  and  procurement  for  civil  works  and  critical  equipment.  ADB \nManagement approved advance procurement and consultant recruitment on 14 September 2006. \nThis covers recruitment of consultants, prequalification of contractors, and tendering and bid \nevaluation  of  procurement  packages,  but  does  not  include  the  signing  of  contracts.  The \nGovernment and EVN have been advised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB \nto financing the Project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n47.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith EVN and the management board. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB \nin connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of EVN and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. EVN will maintain a website to disclose information \non procurement details, including the name and contract price of the winning bidder.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n48.  Disbursement  will  be  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe Borrower and ADB. The disbursements for major civil works and equipment supply procured \nthrough ICB and consultancy services procured through firms will be made by direct payment and \ncommitment procedures. Disbursement for civil works contracts awarded through NCB and goods \nprocured through shopping for resettlement-related activities will be made through an imprest \naccount to be established soon after the loan effectivity at a bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest \naccount will be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed between the Borrower and ADB. The \namount to be maintained in the imprest account will not exceed 10% of the loan amount or the \nprojected expenses for the following 6 months, whichever is less. The statement of expenditures \nprocedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditure and liquidate advances to the imprest \naccount, and records will be maintained to substantiate the payments made through statement of \nexpenditures. Payments under statement of expenditures will be limited to $100,000 per payment.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  The management board, through EVN, will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB. The \nreports will provide a narrative of progress made during the period, changes in the implementation \nschedule, problems or difficulties encountered, and work to be carried out in the next period. The \nprogress reports will also include a summary financial account for the investment component, \nconsisting of project expenditures during the period year to date and total expenditure to date. In \naddition  to  the  quarterly  reports,  within  6  months  of  the  close  of  the  financial  year,  the \nmanagement board through EVN will submit to ADB annual audited accounts of EVN and annual \naudited  financial  statements  of  the  Project.  Annual  project  accounts  will  contain  detailed \ndescriptions  of  the  fund  sources  and  expenditures.  The  imprest  account  and  statement  of \nexpenditures will be audited as part of the annual audit, and an opinion on each will be included in \nthe annual audit statement. The annual audited financial statements of EVN will comprise an \nincome statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and related notes to financial statements \nand confirmation by auditors of compliance or otherwise with financial covenants included in the \n ", "16   \nLoan Agreement. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the management board \nwill furnish ADB with a project completion report.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n50.  The  management  board,  assisted  by  the  implementation  supervision  consultants,  will \nestablish a systematic project performance and monitoring analysis in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProject  Performance  Management  System  Handbook.27 Baseline  social  economic  data  for \nsubsequent performance monitoring have been included in the REMDP. Project performance \nmonitoring consists of several layers of supervision. Physical construction of the major civil works \nand equipment installation will be supervised and monitored by the implementation supervision \nconsultants. Implementation of environment and social safeguard documents will be monitored by \nthe  independent  monitoring  agency.  The  social  and  monitoring  reports  will  be  disclosed  as \nrequired under ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). ADB review missions will review the \nmonitoring reports to be submitted by independent monitors with regard to implementation of the \nEMP and REMDP, and remedial measures will be proposed for any shortcomings. At project \ncompletion, a comprehensive social and environment evaluation will be carried out to assess the \neffectiveness of social and environmental mitigation measures of the Project. \n \n10.  Project Review \n51.  In addition to regular review missions by ADB, a comprehensive midterm review will be \nundertaken  by  ADB  and  the  Government  to  focus  on  the  engineering,  implementation, \nresettlement, and environmental aspects. An evaluation of the likelihood of attaining the Project\u2019s \nimmediate  objectives  will  be  performed,  and  if  necessary,  corrections  introduced  to  ensure \nachievement of objectives.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits  \n1.  Economic Viability \n52.  The  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.28 The  costs  were  derived  from  the  cost \nestimates  in  Appendix  4,  excluding  transfer  payments  such  as  taxes  and  interest  during \nconstruction,  but  including  social  and  environment  mitigation  measures.  It  is  assumed  that \nenvironment and social costs are fully internalized through the inclusion of mitigation costs. The \nenvironmental benefits of the Project attributed to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions \nbecause fossil-fuel-based power plants will be replaced have been taken into account in the \neconomic analysis. Economic costs are expressed in constant 2006 prices and costs incurred in \nforeign currency are converted to a domestic price numeraire using a shadow exchange rate \nfactor29 of 1.1.   \n \n53.  The economic benefits of electricity produced by the Project have been determined by \ncomparing the with- and without-Project scenarios. The without-Project scenario would cause \n(i) suboptimal operation of the power system, resulting in a higher operating cost per unit of \nelectricity generated compared with the with-Project scenario; and (ii) load shedding because of \ninadequate generation capacity. The former is considered the non-incremental benefit of the \nProject and is valued at the resource cost saving; the latter is considered an incremental benefit \nand is valued at the willingness to pay (WTP) by consumers. Detailed economic analysis in \nAppendix 8 shows an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 14.78% and net present value \n(NPV) of $48.54 million at a discount rate of 12%. The sensitivity analysis shows that the Project \nis economically viable even under combined adverse conditions.  \n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2002.

Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, Manila. \n29  The ratio between the economic price of foreign currency and the market exchange rate.  ", "    1 7\n \n2.  Financial Evaluation \n54.  Financial projections for the cash flows attributable to the Project have been prepared in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects30 to assess the financial \nviability of the Project and EVN, its EA. Financial analysis of the Project is in Appendix 10 and the \nfinancial assessment of EVN is in Appendix 9. The financial assessment of EVN shows that EVN \nwill remain a financially viable entity assuming moderate tariff increases of around 5% per annum, \nand will comply with prudential financial ratio covenants of a minimum debt service cover ratio of \n1.5, self-finance ratio of 25%, and debt-equity ratio of 70:30.  \n \n55.  The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2006 \nprices. The project cost estimates and the financial projections in nominal terms were converted \nto  real  terms  by  adjusting  for  foreign  and  domestic  inflation  and  currency  fluctuations.  The \nelectricity generated by the Project was conservatively valued at $0.044 per kWh based on the \nprice paid by EVN to independent power producers. The cost estimates in Appendix 4 are used \nfor the financial analysis, excluding price contingencies and interest during construction. The \nfinancial rate of return (FIRR) computed on an after-tax basis with is 6.49%. This compares \nfavorably with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), also computed on an after-tax basis, \nof 3.46%. The Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity analysis \nindicates the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions. The revenues from the CDM, should they \nbecome available, will further improve the financial viability of the Project to yield a FIRR of 7.60 \n%.  \n \n3.  Social Benefits \n56.  The Project will provide access and improvements in communication, health, education, \nand improved livelihood opportunities to an area that has remained isolated and remote from the \nmain economic centers in Viet Nam. The ethnic minority people inhabiting the area will be able to \nbenefit from these opportunities through the provision of assistance to adapt to new livelihoods \nand social changes while maintaining their traditional lifestyles.  \n \nB.  Project Impacts \n1.  Environmental Impacts \n57.  Change in Hydrology Downstream of the Dam. The water flow in the river stretch \nbetween the dam and power station will be almost negligible, and flows downstream of the power \nstation will be significantly affected depending on the operation regime of the power station. If the \npower station is operated as a peaking plant as expected, there will be significant fluctuations in \nthe water level, which could be as high as 1.5 m in the immediate vicinity of the power station. \nThis fluctuation would diminish further downstream, (20 km from power station) reducing to 0.2 m \nin the vicinity of villages in Dai Loc district.  \n \n58.  Increased Access to Song Thanh Nature Reserve. The reservoir will inundate about \n143 hectares (ha) of the Song Thanh Nature Reserve, which is less than 0.2% of the area of the \nreserve. More importantly, there will be increased access to the nature reserve through the \nreservoir and the realigned highway. The capacity building for Song Thanh Nature Reserve \nauthorities and the conservation offset will contribute to preserving biodiversity in the project area, \nspecifically the Song Thanh Nature Reserve.  \n \n59.  Impacts on Aquatic Ecology and Fauna. The altered hydrology in the Bung river will \ncause adverse impacts on the aquatic ecology of the river as the diurnal fluctuations in the water \nlevel and the dry sections of the river will affect the biological productivity of the river and reduce \nthe fish populations. The migratory barrier of the Song Bung 4 dam, and later the Song Bung 5 \n                                                 \n30  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects, Manila \n ", "18   \ndam  downstream,  if  constructed,  will  adversely  affect  migratory  fish  that  use  the  river  for \nspawning. The aquatic and faunal species in the Vu Gia river are not considered endangered, and \nimpacts will have insignificant biodiversity implications.  \n \n2.  Social Impacts \n60.  The Project will directly affect: four ethnic minority villages (206 households) that will lose \nboth residential and agricultural land in Zuoih commune; 52 households that will lose upland \nfarmland in Ta Bhing commune for the reservoir inundation; over 30 households that will lose \nagricultural  land  in  Ta  Bhing  commune  for  project  construction  lands;  and  1,500\u20132,000 \nhouseholds that engage in fishing in the river in downstream areas in Dai Loc district. Reservoir \ninundation and relocation will entail loss of rice fields, fields for other crops and vegetables, river \nfishery,  associated  social  and  cultural  traits,  and  social  networks.  In  addition,  there  will  be \npotential negative social impacts in the wider ethnic minority community in Nam Giang district \n(population  of  20,000)  because  of  the  influx  of  over  2,000 construction  workers  during  the \nconstruction phase and the greater access provided by the Project. People in the downstream \narea could be affected by changes in the water flow and aquatic ecology in the river.  \n \nC.  Project Risks \n1.  Technical Risks of the Project \n61.  The Project will have several types of technical risks, including those related to geology \nand hydrology. The design has taken steps to avoid or minimize these risks. In general, the \ndesign  of  the  various  project  components  is  conventional  and  within  accepted  norms  and \npractices. The dam height is in the midrange for this type of dam (RCC dams have been built \nhigher than 190 m), and turbines with the proposed range of head and discharges have been \ninstalled  in  many  other  projects.  The  hydrological  risk  during  construction  is  minimal  as \novertopping of an RCC dam is quite acceptable and construction can proceed once the flood has \npassed. The spillway of the Project is designed in line with Vietnamese standards to pass the \n5,000-year flood of 15,000 cubic meters per second (m3/s) without expected damage. Stability of \nthe dam has been checked for a probable maximum flood event and, although such a flood could \novertop the dam and cause extensive damage to ancillary works, it would not endanger the \nstructural integrity of the dam itself. The geotechnical risks at the dam site, tunnel and power \nhouse site are expected to be manageable because geological conditions in the project area are \ngood.  \n \n2.  Financial Risks  \n62.  The  financial  risks  of  the  Project  relate  to  cost  overruns  caused  by  technical  risks, \nimplementation delays, and reduction in plant output caused by adverse hydrological conditions \nafter commissioning. These are sufficiently factored into the financial analysis and contingencies \nare provided in the cost estimates; the Project is financially robust enough to withstand these \nrisks. In addition to the project-specific risks, the overall financial viability of the sector would have \nan impact on the overall success of the Project. With the increasing commercial financing of new \ninvestments, the financing cost of the sector will increase with the financial risk profile of the \nsector, and adequate tariff increases and control over operating costs will be required to maintain \nthe financial risks of the sector at a level acceptable to financers. A further tariff increase of 5% is \nexpected  in  the  second  half  of  2008  in  addition  to  the  6.6%    tariff  increase  approved  in \nJanuary 2007. With the establishment of a competitive power market in 2009, generation tariffs \nwill be set by the market and the transmission and distribution tariffs by the regulator. The sector \nis also exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risks because of the currency mismatches \nbetween revenues and liabilities.  \n ", "    1 9\n3.  Policy and Institutional Risks \n63.  Viet Nam is embarking on an ambitious sector reform program aimed at establishing a \ncompetitive generation market by 2010. This involves converting EVN into a holding company, \nand  divesting  operating  units  of  EVN  engaged  in  power  generation  and  distribution.  The \nregulation of the sector, including soliciting and procuring new generation capacity, will be the \nresponsibility of ERAV. One of the major challenges and risks in Viet Nam is implementing this \nreform program while expanding the capacity of the power system to meet the projected 15% \ndemand growth per year. Providing adequate comfort levels to potential investors in the sector in \nthe context of the incipient power market and evolving regulatory regime\u2014without compromising \nthe flexibility required to operate a competitive market\u2014is a major challenge. ADB TA on power \nmarket design (footnote 7) is providing assistance to ERAV to implement the proposed sector \nreforms.  \n \n4.  Social Risks \n64.  In Zuoih commune, about 70% of the population lives below the poverty line. The social \nrisks of the Project relate to failure to implement the social safeguard activities prepared in \naccordance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies.  Relocation  and  land  acquisition  can  lead  to \nimpoverishment, and loss of traditional social and cultural identity. Certain requirements of ADB \nsocial safeguard policies aimed at ensuring the restoration and improvement of the livelihoods of \naffected people and compensation for upstream and downstream impacts exceed the current \npractice in Viet Nam. The institutional capacity to implement these measures remains a major risk \nfactor. The ability of ethnic minority communities to adapt to new livelihoods at the proposed \nresettlement sites, and competition for natural resources and land with outsiders who may settle \nin the project area because of increased access provided by the Project, have also been identified \nas risk factors. The Project will provide assistance to EVN and the district people\u2019s committee in \nimplementing  social  safeguards  and  will  provide  direct  assistance  to  affected  persons  for \nimproving their livelihoods.  \n \n5.  Environmental Risks \n65.  The main environment risks relate to the effectiveness of implementation of the EMP. \nEnsuring adequate environment standards to minimize adverse impacts on, for example, water \nquality and soil erosion during the construction phase is the responsibility of the contractors. The \nProject will provide adequate support to supervise the contractors in their compliance with these \nrequirements. Implementation of the EMP during the operational phase, especially provision of \nadequate financing for implementing the conservation offset, remains a risk. Indirect impacts on \nSong Thanh Nature Reserve caused by increased access and general development of a hitherto \nunderdeveloped area with high biodiversity value is also a risk that needs to be managed through \ncapacity building and improvement of enforcement capacities of provincial agencies.   \n \nV.

Power Sector Performance \n1.  Rapid  economic  development,  increasing  industrialization,  and  greater  access  to \nelectricity have led to an average growth in electricity demand of 13.5% per annum from 2002 to \n2007.   Total power generation reached 68,000 GWh in 2007 corresponding to per capita \ngeneration of 800 kWh/per person. The total installed generation capacity as of the end of 2007 \nwas 12,600 MW; new capacity addition during the period 2002\u20132007 was over 4,800 MW. The \ninstalled capacity is projected to exceed 25,000 MW by 2012 and 50,000 MW by 2017. The \npower sector in Viet Nam is dominated by the state-owned Viet Nam Electricity (EVN).  EVN \nwas formed in June 2006 by converting the vertically integrated former Electricity of Viet Nam \ninto a holding company structure. EVN\u2019s operating units, consisting of power plants, regional \npower distribution companies and power transmission system operator have been converted to \nindependent subsidiaries of EVN.   \n \n2.  The power generation subsector in Viet Nam is summarized in Table A2.1 and consists \nof the following elements. \n \n(i)  Strategic multipurpose hydropower plants.  These will remain under the sole \nownership of EVN with less than 25% of generation market share.  \n(ii)  Privatized power plants.  These are previously EVN-owned power plants that \nwere recently partially privatized or in the process of being privatized and listed \non the stock market. By the end of 2007, five power plants with a combined \ncapacity of approximately 1,500 MW had been privatized; the remaining EVN- \nowned  plants,  except  the  strategic  hydropower  plants,  are  expected  to  be \nprivatized by the end of 2009.  \n(iii)  Independent power producers (IPPs). There are two categories of IPPs in Viet \nNam: (a) power plants developed by private investors under the provisions of the \nbuild-own-transfer (BOT) decree; secured with government guarantees and long-\nterm  power  purchase  agreements  (PPAs).  There  are  two  such  projects  in \noperation (Phy My 2.2 and Phu My 3) and several others are under negotiation. \n(b) Power plants developed by non EVN state-owned enterprises and domestic \ninvestors.    These  plants  have  medium  term  PPAs  which  will  expire  at  the \ncommencement of proposed power market.  \n \nTable A2.1: Capacity Mix of Viet Nam\u2019s Power Sector as of end 2007 \n(megawatt) \n    IPP   \n  Under BOT \nItem  EVN  SOE  Non- EVN  Decree  Total \nHydropower  4,543  237      4,780 \nCoal  1,210  225  165    1,600 \nNatural Gas   2,910  500    1,466  4,876 \nDiesel oil or furnace oil  476  0  620    1,096 \nImport  220  0      220 \nBio Mass  0  0  24    24 \n  Total  9,359  962  809  1,466  12,596 \nEVN = Viet Nam Electricity, IPP = independent power producer, SOE = state-owned enterprise, BOT = build-own-\ntransfer  \nSource: Institute of Energy, Viet Nam. \n \n3.  The transmission network consists of about 3,250 kilometers (km) of 500 kV double \ncircuit backbone line from north to south, and 220 kV and 110 kV networks connecting the load \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \ncenters  to  the  backbone  network.  The  ongoing  transmission  augmentation  program  will \ncomplete the 500 kV ring networks around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. In the distribution \nsector, regional power companies belonging to EVN are charged an internal transfer price \n(i.e., bulk power tariffs) at 110 kV level and are responsible for power distribution to end users. \nThe bulk tariffs are set by EVN to enable each power company to achieve a reasonable profit, \nirrespective of its cost structure. By 2006, the household electrification rate exceeded 91% \ncompared with 73% in 2000 and the transmission and distribution losses have been reduced to \n11% in 2006 compared with 19.3% in 1996. \n \n4.  Driven by rapid economic growth, electricity demand will maintain the present growth \nrate of over 16% per annum until 2010; thereafter, it will fall to an average rate of about 11% per \nannum by 2015. However, per capita consumption in Viet Nam remains low compared to its \nneighbors. It is projected to reach the present per capita consumption of Thailand in 2015 and \nMalaysia in 2023.1 The projected increase in electricity demand is summarized in Table A2.2. \n \nTable A2.2: Electricity Demand Projection, 2005\u20132025 \n \nItem  2005  2010  2015  2020  2025 \nAnnual Demand (TWh)  45.6 97.1 164.9 257.3  381.2\nGrowth in Demand   16.1% 11.1% 9.3% 8.1% \nT&D Losses and Self-Generation  14.7% 13.8% 13.2% 12.5%  11.7%\nAnnual Generation (TWh)  53.6 112.7 190.0 294.0  431.6\nMaximum Demand (MW)  9,500 19,550 32,200 48,650  71,400\nPer capita consumption (kWh)   549  1,106 1,774 2,629  3,703\n   MW = megawatt, T&D = transmission and distribution, TWh = terawatt-hour. \n   Source: Institute of Energy, Viet Nam. \n \n1.  The Government\u2019s Power Sector Strategy  \n5.  The Government\u2019s policy for the power sector, as enunciated in the Electricity Law that \ncame  into  effect  in  July  2005,  is  to  develop  a  power  market  based  on  the  principles  of \ntransparency and competition to (i) achieve economic efficiency, (ii) attract investments from \nboth state and non-state entities to the sector, and (iii) ensure the legitimate rights of consumers \nand investors in the sector. The law declares that the state monopoly in the sector would be \nlimited to power transmission, national load dispatch, and strategically important large power \nplants\u2014leaving  power  distribution  and  non-strategic  power  generation  to  potential  private \ninvestors. Since the enactment of the Electricity Law, the Government has demonstrated its \nstrong commitment to creating a transparent power market and to broadening ownership of the \nsector  by  taking  several  key  initial  steps,  including  the  establishment  of  the  Electricity \nRegulatory Authority of Vietnam (ERAV), approving the road map for establishing a power \nmarket,  approving  the  establishment  of  EVN  based  on  a  holding  company  structure,  and \ninitiating the partial privatization of EVN subsidiaries.  \n \na.  Road Map for Competitive Power Market  \n6.  The road map for electricity market establishment and development approved by the \nPrime Minister in 2006 envisages a phased approach to reforms. During the first phase of the \ndevelopment  of  the  power  market,  (establishment  of  a  competitive  generation  market) \ncompetition will be only among the sellers (power plants) and a single buyer will act as an \nintermediary between the power plants and distribution companies. The single buyer will sell \nelectricity to distribution companies and large consumers at regulated prices. The competitive \ngeneration market is expected to start in 2010. The next phase of power market development, \n                                                 \n1   Per capita electricity consumption is 1,854 kilowatt-hour (kWh) for Thailand and 3,125 kWh for Malaysia, compared \nwith 549 kWh in Viet Nam. ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nscheduled to start in 2014, will entail a wholesale competitive market where sellers (power \nplants) and buyers (distributors and large consumers) will competitively transact in a power \npool. The final stage will be retail competition, where retail consumers will be allowed to choose \ntheir supplier.   \n \n7.  The ERAV was established within the Ministry of Industry and Trade in October 2005 as \na separate institution. ERAV\u2019s  functions include: (i) issuing and enforcing electricity licenses, (ii) \nadvising the minister on market structure and industry policy, (iii) establishing retail tariff setting \nprinciples and mechanisms, (iv) proposing the market design and developing the associated \nregulatory framework, (v) approving power purchase arrangements of the single buyer, (vi) \nmonitoring the progress of implementation of new generation and transmission projects, and \n(vii) monitoring the operation of the power market. Since its inception, ERAV has been engaged \nin building institutional capacity to carry out its regulatory mandate and preparing regulatory \ninstruments with the assistance provided by donor agencies.  This include the conceptual \ndesign of Competitive Generation Market with the assistance of ADB TA on power market \ndesign 2 and the World Bank and other bilateral donors are supporting the   preparation of draft \nelectricity licenses and regulatory fees,  retail tariff and transmission pricing methodologies,  \nsubsidy mechanism for rural electrification, standard power purchase agreements for small and \nmedium-sized  renewable  energy  projects  and  preparing  the  detailed  market  rules  for  the \nproposed competitive generation market.  \n \nb.  Corporate Restructuring of EVN  \n8.  The Government is restructuring the electricity industry with the establishment of EVN as \na holding company. As part of this process, in April 2007, the Government approved the \n\u201cequitization\u201d (partial privatization with EVN holding more than 50% of share capital) plan for \n2007\u20132009  for  equitizing  most  of  the  operating  units  engaged  in  power  generation  and \ndistribution. All the existing power plants and the nine regional power distribution companies\u2014\nexcept  the  three  multipurpose  hydropower  plants  (Yaly,  Hoa  Binh,  and  Tri  Anh)\u2014will  be \nequitized during 2007\u20132009. The thermal power plant complexes and the hydropower plants are \ngrouped into separate companies for the purpose of equitization. The four power engineering \nconsulting  companies  belonging  to  EVN  have  already  being  privatized  and  the  subsidiary \nengaged in telecom services (EVN Telecom) will also be equitized. Prior to approval of this plan, \ntwo thermal power plants, a hydropower plant, and a provincial power distribution company \nwere equitized and listed in stock market in 2006. During 2007, a further nine subsidiaries, \nincluding three power plants, were equitized through initial public offerings.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

The scheme consists of the concrete dam in Bung river, which allows water to be stored \nin a reservoir. From the intake structure on the right bank of the reservoir, a single tunneled \nhydraulic system 3.1 kilometers (km) long conveys water to a surface power house that houses \ntwo 78 megawatt (MW) Francis generating units. The water is then returned to the Bung river \nalong a 20 meter (m) long tailrace canal.

Dam Design and Construction \n \n2.  Given the strong rock foundation at the dam site, EVN chose a concrete gravity dam \nconstructed with roller compacted concrete (RCC). The dam was designed to Vietnamese \nstandards, and the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultant confirmed that \nthe design is conservative since the various calculated safety factors are within the allowable \nranges. The maximum height is 109.5 m and the crest length is 367 m. The dam is located on \nan outcrop of sandstone with inter-bedded siltstone in the Bung river, and has a grout curtain \nand drainage gallery to control seepage and seepage pressure. The dam will be monitored \nduring  and  after  construction  for  seepage,  foundation  pore  pressure,  dam  tilt,  opening  of \ninduced cracks, concrete temperature, and earthquake acceleration. \n \n3.  A gated spillway designed according to Vietnamese standards (1,000-year design flood) \nwill be built into the dam, with five 15 m x 16 m radial gates, a ski-jump chute and a plunge pool. ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nThe spillway is capable of passing the 5,000-year flood1 without causing damage to the spillway. \nThe stability of the dam was also checked under a probable maximum flood event2.  \n \n4.  During construction, the river will be diverted into a 7 m by 9 m twin box culvert that will \nbe part of the dam body. Upstream and downstream rock-fill cofferdams will divert the water into \nand out of the box culverts. The diversion has been designed for a 10-year flood, and it is \nexpected that, during the rainy season, the dam under construction could be overtopped. This is \nnot expected to cause any damage to the dam structure and this methodology has been \nadopted in construction of other RCC dams around the world. Extreme floods normally last for \nless than 1 week in the wet season from September to December. \n \nC.  Intake Structure  \n5.  The intake will be founded on rock, with adequate strength on the right bank of the \nreservoir about 100 m upstream of the dam. The intake structure will be 50 m high and cast in \nconcrete.  It  will  be  provided  with  two  trash  rack  bays  and  one  intake  gate  designed  for \n172.7 cubic meters per second (m3/s). \n \nD.  Power Tunnels \n6.  The power tunnels consist of the following: (i) a concrete-lined head race tunnel, 6.8 m in \ndiameter and 3,046 m long; (ii) a concrete-lined variable diameter surge shaft about 75 m high, \nof which 21.5 m is above ground; (iii) a 270 m long concrete-embedded steel penstock with a \ndiameter of 5.2 m; and (iv) a bifurcation with a diameter of 3.4 m at the end of the steel lining, \nbranching to each generating unit at the power station. The rock cover along the head race \ntunnel will range from 60 m to 430 m. Access to the underground works during construction will \nbe through three adits. The tunnels are designed to be built by drill and blast excavation, with \nprimary  support  of  rock  bolts,  shotcrete,3 and mesh;  and  permanent  support  of reinforced \nconcrete.  This  is  the  conventional  approach  used  in  Viet  Nam  for  similar  projects  and  is \nconsidered conservative at an international level. The linings are grouted to fill any voids and \nfissures on the rock contact. The surge shaft is provided to regulate pressure transients during \nrapid changes in station load, which may results in increase in the gross head by 19.5 m or \n15%. \n \n7.  The  surface-accessed  \u201cpit\u201d  power  house,  comprising  a  superstructure  and  a \nsubstructure,  is  provided  to  contain  the  two  vertical-axis  Francis  generating  units.  The \nsuperstructure provides protective housing for the generators and control equipment, as well as \nstructural support for the main crane of the machine hall. The superstructure is extended and \nprovides for an erection bay that protects component assemblies during inclement weather. The \nsubstructure, or foundation of the power house, consists of concrete necessary to form the draft \ntube, support the turbine stay ring and generator, and encase the spiral case of the turbines. A \nseparate control building housing workshops, offices, and comfort facilities for the operators is \nplanned adjacent to the power house. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The Song Bung 4 Hydropower management board has checked the design of the dam to withstand a 5,000-year \nflood. Based on existing hydrological data and probability modeling, this means the maximum flood level that would \non average be exceeded once in every 5,000 years.  \n2 The Probable maximum Flood is the maximum flood that is statistically probable.  Under this event, overtopping of \nthe dam is allowed, without causing structural damage to the dam.  \n3  Shotcrete is mortar or concrete conveyed through a hose and pneumatically projected at high velocity onto a \nsurface. \n ", "      3\n0\n \nA\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES  p\np\ne\nTable A4.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category  nd\nix\n  (D billion)  ($ million)         4\n \n  Foreign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local   Total  % of Base \nItem  Cost  Cost  Cost  Cost  Cost  Cost  Cost \n \nA.

The \naverage gross domestic product (GDP) growth exceeded 7.5% per annum for the period 2000\u2013\n2007) with 2007 growth rate reaching 8.5%; industry is projected to grow at 11% per annum and \nservices at 8% per annum.  \n \n2.  Viet Nam sustained high growth of 13.5% during 2002\u20132007. Within the short term (e.g., \nup to 5 years), electricity demand projections were estimated based on the so-called direct \nmethod. This direct estimation is based on surveys of all registered new demand of committed \nor planned expansion or newly created industrial and economic zones together with major urban \ncenters,  collected  on  a  province-by-province  basis.  In  the  longer  term  (i.e.,  10  years  and \nbeyond), provincial economic development plans are less definitive, and econometric methods \nused for demand forecast take into consideration the correlation between electricity demand \ngrowth  and  sectoral  growth  rates  and  historical  trends.  Table  A8.1  contains  the  main \nparameters of the demand projection.  \n \nTable A8.1: Main Indicators of Demand Forecast, 2005\u20132025 \n \nItem  2005  2010  2015  2020  2025 \nAnnual demand (TWh)  45.6  97,1  164.9  257.3  381.2 \n5-year growth rate (%),  \n    next 5 years  16.3  11.2  9.3  8.2   \nPer capita consumption (kWh)  549  1,106  1,774  2,629  3,703 \nT&D losses and own use (%)  14.7  13.8  13.2  12.5  11.7 \nPeak load (MW)  9,500  19,550  32,196  48,650  71,400 \n  kWh = kilowatt-hour, MW = megawatt, T&D = transmission and distribution, TWh = terawatt-hour. \n  Source: Institute of Energy. 2005. Master Plan VI (final draft). Hanoi. \n \nB.  Least-Cost System Expansion Plan of the Viet Nam Power Sector \n3.  A master plan for the next 10 years with an outlook for 20 years is prepared every \n5 years,  which  looks  into  all  aspects  of  the  power  system  development.  The  master  plan \nnormally includes a demand forecast, a least-cost expansion plan, a transmission expansion \nplan, a fuel supply assessment, a rural electrification program, an investment requirement, \nregional interconnection and power trade with neighboring countries, and environmental and \nsocial externalities of power system development.  \n \n4.  The technical potential for hydropower in Viet Nam is estimated at 308 terawatt-hours \n(TWh)/year  with  a  capacity  of  70,000  megawatts  (MW),  while  the  economic  potential  is \nestimated  at  120 TWh/year  and  a  capacity  of  30,000  MW.  Taking  into  account  the \nenvironmental  and  social  criteria,  the  feasible  hydropower  potential  is  estimated  to  be \n20,750 MW and 83 TWh/year. The domestic fossil fuel resources suitable for power generation \nare coal in the north and gas in the south. The expansion plan considered importing coal (from \nIndonesia and Australia) for producing electricity from 2015. Nuclear energy will also be a \npossible candidate for meeting high electricity demand after 2018.

The  planning  exercise  is  based  on  the  set  of  candidate  plants  and  takes  into \nconsideration constraints that reflect the fuel availability and system reliability criteria (e.g., \npower  plant  outage,  maintenance  requirements,  and  transmission  line  reliability).  System \noptimization was carried out using STRATEGIST software to meet the forecasted demand for \nelectricity, which includes the potential savings from ongoing demand side management and \nenergy efficiency programs.  The optimum generation expansion plan resulting in the lowest \ntotal discounted system costs was determined using an optimization alogritham, after taking into \naccount transmission system constraints on interchange between regions.  \n \n6.      The  optimal  generation  expansion  plan  is  a  combination  of  all  types  of  generating \ncapacities,  reflecting  the  resource  base  of  the  country.  Hydropower  will  continue  to  be \ndeveloped as Viet Nam\u2019s present installed hydropower capacity is about 25% of the feasible \nhydropower potential of 20,000 MW. Thermal power, such as gas- and coal-based power will \nalso have their share in the generation mix. The contribution of renewable sources to the \nsystem will become more significant and the contribution from small and mini hydropower and \nwind will increased over the next 10 years. By 2011, renewable capacity will reach only 100 \nMW, but it will quickly increase to 500 MW in 2015 and to about 1,000 MW in 2025. \n  \nC.  Economic Valuation of Costs and Benefits of Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project \n6.  According  to  the  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects1 of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the economic viability of the Project was examined by comparing the \ntwo scenarios: with- and without-Project. The comparison takes into account the costs and \nbenefits to society in these scenarios. The basis of comparison is that both scenarios face the \nsame projected electricity demand.  \n \n1.  Costs \n7.  The costs to society are the investment and operating costs of the Project and the costs \nof environmental and social mitigations. In this analysis, the domestic price numeraire is used \nand the costs expressed in border prices are multiplied by a shadow exchange rate factor \n(footnote 27) equal to 1.1 in the case of Viet Nam.  \n \n2.  Benefits \n8.  To  compare  the  system  behavior  in  the  with-  and  without-Project  scenarios,  the \nSTRATEGIST power planning tool was used. The optimal expansion plan was simulated, which \ncorresponds to the with-Project scenario and annual output from each plant in the optimum \nsystem,  power transfer among regions, and system loss of load expectation are calculated. The \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "38  Appendix 8 \nwithout-Project scenario is simulated by taking the Project from the optimum system while \nkeeping other generation sources unchanged. Since the production of hydropower stations is \ndependent on water availability, their output is kept the same as in the with-Project case and the \ndeficit caused by withdrawal of the Project is assumed to be met by increased production from \nthermal plants. The electricity demand that can not be met by increased production of thermal \npower plants is considered \u201cunserved energy\u201d.  \n \n9.  In this analysis, the economic value of electricity generated by the Project is measured \nby the costs to society of not having it. This cost comprises the incremental costs of suboptimal \noperation of thermal power plants to partly replace the Project and the costs to consumers \n(industrial, residential, commercial) because of unserved electricity. In other words, the benefits \nof  having  the  Project  are  the  sum  of  two  components:  the  non-incremental  benefits  (the \ndifference in operating the power system in a suboptimal manner in the without-Project scenario \ncompared with the with-Project scenario) and the incremental benefits equal to the cost of \nunserved energy in the without-Project case.  \n \na.  Non-Incremental Benefits \n10.  The extra amounts of thermal production in the northern and southern regions vary year \nby year as shown in Table A8.3. The extra production by power plants in central and northern \nregions is coal-based; in the south, it is based on gas and/or furnace oil. The corresponding \naverage costs are $0.0474 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for coal and $0.0528/kWh for gas. These \nproduction costs are used to value the non-incremental benefits of the Project in terms of \nincreased costs of increased output of thermal power plants in the without-Project scenario.  \n \nTable A8.3: Increased Production of Thermal Power Plants  \nto Offset Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project \n(GWh) \nYear  By Coal  By Gas/Oil  Total \n2012  251.63  183.73  435.36 \n2013  169.00  259.71  428.71 \n2014  151.24  263.36  414.60 \n2015  54.84  311.78  366.63 \n2016  81.32  292.92  374.24 \n2017  78.88  269.39  348.27 \n2018  73.83  253.03  326.86 \n2019  77.54  209.49  287.04 \n2020  76.57  187.49  264.06 \n2021  218.91  52.72  271.62 \n2022  104.56  174.61  279.17 \n2023  189.99  67.17  257.17 \n2024  77.54  180.29  257.84 \n2025  67.35  128.35  195.70 \n      GWh = gigawatt-hour. \nSource:  Institute of Energy, Viet Nam. \n \nb.  Incremental Benefits \n11.  As  thermal  power  plants  cannot  completely  meet  the  shortage  of  electricity  in  the \nwithout-Project  scenario,  end  users  will  experience  demand  curtailment.  The  cost  of  this ", "  Appendix 8  39 \ndemand curtailment represents the incremental benefits of having the Project. The shortage of \nelectricity supply caused by the without-Project scenario produces different costs for different \nconsumer categories. The household consumer electricity demand function is assumed to be of \nthe natural logarithm function:2 \n \nln(Q) = a + b*P        (Equation. 4.1) \nwhere: \nQ is the electricity consumption level of an individual household \nP is the corresponding price of electricity \na and b are the coefficients specific to a given situation \n \n12.  With such a demand function, the loss of consumer welfare because of a reduction of \nconsumption from level Q  to level Q  (Q  < Q ) is measured by: \n1 2 2 1\n \nQ\n1\nHH_loss =  \u222bPdq        (Equation. 4.2) \nQ\n2\n  after integrating over the Q  \u2013 Q  range: \n2 1\n \nHH_loss = Q  * (P -1/b) \u2013 Q  *(P -1/b)  (Equation. 4.3) \n1 1 2 2\n \n   \nwhere:  \nP  is the tariff \n1\nQ  is the consumption at P  \n1 1 \nQ is the consumption after demand curtailment \n2 \nP  is the willingness to pay for electricity while consuming at curtailed demand of Q   \n2  2\n(P  > P  )  \n2 1\n \nFor small changes in consumption level, it can be assumed that P  ~ P  and the above equation \n1 2\ncan be simplified to: \n \nHH_loss = (Q  \u2013 Q ) * (P -1/b)  (Equation. 4.4) \n1 2 1\n \n \n13.  The equation for benefits calculation presented above is applicable for an individual \nhousehold. Based on population growth rate of 1.12 % per annum (decreasing over time to  \n1.09% per annum) and average household size decreasing from 4.5 to 3.8, it is possible to \nestimate the number of households in Viet Nam for the whole study period. Using data from \nprevious sources,3 values of coefficients a and b of the demand function are estimated for a \ntypical household in Viet Nam.  However, in the case of commercial and industrial consumers, it \nis likely that they will resort to captive power generation using diesel generators in the event of \ndemand curtailment. The cost to industrial and commercial consumers is the cost of alternative \ngeneration.  The  most  popular  replacement  for  grid  electricity  is  the  stand-alone  diesel \ngenerator, with capacity from 150 kW to 5 MW. The average cost of diesel generation is \n$0.1445/kWh.  \n \n14.  The environmental benefits of the Project attributed to reductions in greenhouse gas \nemissions because of the replacement of fossil-fuel-based power plants are taken into account \n                                                 \n2  Choynowski, P. 2002.

The carbon emissions due to the Project have been estimated as \n217,879 per year using based on a carbon emission factor of 534.5 tCO per GWh for the Viet \n2 \nNam power grid computed using the approved methodology ACM0002 version 7 of the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism Executive Board.  The economic benefits due to the reduction in \ncarbon emissions is assumed to be equal to the projected revenues from the sale of carbon \nemission reductions (CER) at a price of $10 / CER ton. \n \n \n15.  Table A8.4 summarizes the results of the benefit calculation. The total economic benefits \nof the Project are the sum of the avoided costs of operating thermal power plants in a sub-\noptimum manner and the avoided costs to the industrial and commercial consumers who have \nto use a more expensive source of electricity (diesel generators), the avoided welfare loss of \nhousehold  consumers  who  have  to  reduce  their  consumption  involuntarily,  and  the \nenvironmental benefits valued at CER revenues. The net benefits have been computed by \nsubtracting the capital cost and the operating cost valued at domestic prices. The resultant net \npresent value (NPV) of the benefits amounts to $48.54 million (at a 12% discount rate) and the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 14.78%. \n \nTable A8.4: Economic Benefits of Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project  \n($ million)\n \nAvoided   \nCosts of  Benefits to  Benefits to  Benefits to   \nThermal  Household  Industrial  Commercial  Environment \nYear  Power  Consumers  Consumers  Consumers  Benefits  Total Benefits \n2012  21.63  2.90  3.28  1.64  2.21  31.65 \n2013  21.72  3.19  3.60  1.80  2.21  32.53 \n2014  21.07  3.87  4.37  2.18  2.21  33.70 \n2015  19.06  6.33  7.15  3.58  2.21  38.33 \n2016  19.32  6.02  6.80  3.40  2.21  37.75 \n2017  17.96  7.31  8.26  4.13  2.21  39.86 \n2018  16.86  8.44  9.54  4.77  2.21  41.81 \n2019  14.74  10.44  11.80  5.90  2.21  45.09 \n2020  13.53  11.62  13.13  6.56  2.21  47.05 \n2021  13.16  11.23  12.69  6.34  2.21  45.63 \n2022  14.18  10.82  12.22  6.11  2.21  45.54 \n2023  12.55  11.97  13.52  6.76  2.21  47.02 \n2024  13.19  11.94  13.49  6.74  2.21  47.57 \n2025  9.97  15.10  17.06  8.53  2.21  52.87 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n16.  The risk analysis of NPV and EIRR with respect to main input parameters has been \nanalyzed by using the @RISK Software program. The main input parameters subjected to risk \nanalysis include the energy output of the Project; the capital investment costs; and the values \nthat household, industrial, and commercial consumers attach to the unserved electricity. The \ntotal project cost is the key variable, so the variation of the project cost was examined in relation \nto its components.  The variation of cost components was simulated to determine the probability \ndistribution of the Project cost. The electricity output of the Project (within a range of 20%) and \nwillingness to pay for both household and non-household consumers (within a range of 10%) \nwas simulated to determine the probability distribution of the Project economic benefits and the \nEIRR and NPV of the Project at a discount rate of 12%.

General Overview \n1.  Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) is a large and complex organization whose core business is \nthe supply of electricity throughout Viet Nam. In 2006, the Government had decided to convert \nEVN into a holding company; most of its operating entities have been converted to limited \nliability (i.e., joint stock) companies, with EVN retaining whole or partial ownership and most of \nthe operating subsidiaries are expected to be partially privatized by the end of 2009.  At present \nseveral  subsidiaries  engaged  in  power  generation  and  power  engineering  consultancy  are \npartially privatized.    \n2.  Since its creation in 1995, as a vertically integrated entity responsible for the electricity \nsector in Viet Nam, EVN\u2019s operations have been profitable. It has financed the rapid expansion \nof Viet Nam\u2019s electricity sector without resorting to significant fiscal subsidies. Key financial \nperformance indicators such as the debt service coverage ratio, the self-financing ratio, and \nreceivables have been maintained at prudential limits. The average end user tariff has been \nmaintained at around $0.053 /kilowatt-hour (kWh) since January 2007. However, to satisfy \nfuture demand for electricity resulting from rapid economic growth, EVN will need to make \nconsiderable investments in generation, transmission, and distribution. A substantial portion of \nthese investments will be debt financed, and sustained tariff increases are required to maintain \nadequate levels of debt service cover and self-financing of these new investments. The financial \nperformance  of  EVN  from  2000\u20132006  and  the  financial  projections  from  2007\u20132011  are \nsummarized in the Tables A 9.1, A 9.2, and A 9.3.   \nB.  Historical Performance \n3.  In recent loans approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, \nthe  banks and  the  Government  have  agreed  to  adopt  new  financial  covenants  based  on: \n(i) consolidated  EVN  financial  statements,  and  (ii)  EVN\u2019s  overall  financial  viability  and \nperformance rather than arbitrary tariff levels set in foreign currencies. These covenants were \nintroduced  in  the  loan  for  the  Northern  Power  Transmission  Sector  Project1 in  2004  and  \nmaintained in loans for the Northern Power Transmission Expansion Sector Project  and Mong \nDuong 1 Thermal Power Project.2 The covenants are (i) a self-financing ratio of 25%, (ii) a debt \nservice cover ratio of 1.5, and (iii) a debt-equity ratio of 70:30. EVN has complied with these \ncovenants during 2000\u20132006.  However, there has been a reduction in its net cash flow and \noperating profits because of the absence of tariff increases during 2003\u20132006. This has reduced \nthe self-financing ratio to 34% in 2006 from 77% in 2003, and the debt service ratio from 8.49 in \n2003 to 2.77 in 2006. This is expected to be reversed with the tariff increase of 6.6% effective \nJanuary 2007 and 5.0% effective July 2008. The retail tariffs beyond 2010 will be adjusted to \nreflect market prices in the competitive generation market to be set up in 2010.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

", "  Appendix 9  43 \n1.  Sales and Income \n4.  EVN\u2019s electricity sales have grown by three times from 1998 to 2006, (from 17.7 TWh to \n51.3 TWh) representing an annual growth rate of 14.2%. Although the average tariffs net of \nsales taxes have increased only marginally from D660/kWh ($0.046/kWh) in 2000 to D853/kWh \n($0.053/kWh) by 2006, revenue has increased from D16.8 trillion ($1.16 billion) 3in 2000 to \nD44.9 trillion ($2,807 million) in 2006.  The largest growth in electricity sales has been in the \nindustrial sector where average annual growth was 17%\u201418%, with the result that the industrial \nsector share in total sales increased from 40% in 2000 to 45% in 2006. The household sector \nhas also shown annual growth of 12% per annum over the last 12 years. This is because of a \nmixture  of  increasing  demand  by  existing  customers  and  additional  demand  from  new \nconnections as more households are connected to the electricity supply system.   \n2.   Production and Supply \n5.  In 2006, EVN produced 46.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) from its own power stations and \npurchased a further 12.5 TWh from independent power producers (IPPs). The largest source of \npower was hydropower (33%), followed by natural gas (30%), coal (15%), and oil (1%). IPPs \n(including imports) account for 21% of total supply. However, electricity from hydropower has \ndeclined by 7% because of adverse hydrological conditions, and the resulting deficit has been \nmade up primarily from oil-fired power stations and by an increase in power purchases from \nIPPs. Given that gas-fired power plants are in the south and most of hydropower plants are in \nnorth,  the  power  transmission  from  the  south  to  north  is  constrained  by  limitations  on \ntransmission capacity, resulting in localized load shedding in the North Viet Nam during the dry \nseason. \n3.  Operating Costs \n6.  Depreciation is one of the largest operating costs for EVN, accounting for over 30% of its \noperating costs. Under the Vietnamese accounting system, depreciation periods are generally \nshorter than those allowed under International Accounting Standards. As a result, levels of \ndepreciation are relatively high. However, the high depreciation provision provides higher cash \nflows for financing capital expenses and improves the self-financing ratio. Other major cost \nitems are the fuel cost for thermal power stations and the purchase cost of electricity from IPPs. \nEVN uses lower calorific value (4,000\u20135,500 kilocalories per kilogram) domestic anthracite coal \nfor power generation. The higher quality anthracite coal is exported as coking coal. The price \nEVN pays for this type of coal varies from $24/ton to $28/ton and is administratively fixed at a \ndiscount to the export prices. Gas prices are in US dollars, based on agreed volume and long-\nterm contracts. EVN receives no direct operating subsidies from the Government to cover its \noperating costs. However, the Government injects additional capital to help finance specific \ninvestments such as 2,400 MW Son La Hydropower Project and access to lower interest loans \nfrom state-owned banks.  \n4.  Capital Expenditure \n7.  During 2000\u20132006, EVN invested over D102.4 trillion ($6.4 billion) in new capital work. \nApproximately 45% of this expenditure has been financed by taking out additional long-term \nloans, and the remainder has been financed from its own resources (50%) and capital injections \n                                                 \n3  Exchange rate D14,480 per $1 is used for the year 2000.  \n ", "44   Appendix 9 \nby the Government (5%). Total outstanding long-term loans have increased to over 68.7 trillion \n($4.3 billion) by 2006 compared with D26.9 trillion ($ 1.85 billion)  in 2000. \nC.   Financial Projections, 2007\u20132011  \n1.   Sales and Revenue  \n8.  Although the corporate structure of EVN is envisaged to change under the proposed \npower sector reforms, it is likely to remain a holding company owning significant stakes of the \npower sector. It is assumed that the consolidated electricity sales would reach 97.1 TWh in \n2010 compared with 51.3 TWh in 2006, with an annual growth rate of 16% during the period \n2006\u20132011. Electricity sales by each regional distribution company have been projected by \ndifferent  consumer  category  and  consolidated  to  derive  the  total  sales  and  the  projected \nrevenues. The revenue projections are based on tariff assumptions prepared by EVN to ensure \ncompliance with the various loan covenants. The tariff increase of 6.6% to an average tariff level \nof D853/kWh ($0.053/kWh) effective from 1 January 2007 and 5.0% effective from the middle of \n2008 are assumed in the projections.  \n2.  Operating Expenses \n9.  The operating expenses of EVN largely depend on the plant mix used for meeting the \nforecasted demand and the fuel price projections. The plant mix for 2006\u20132011 is based on the \neconomic merit order dispatch subject to the hydrological and transmission constraints, and the \ncontractual commitments with regard to independent power producers. The system losses are \nto be reduced from their current level of 12.6% to about 10.9% by 2011. It is also expected that \nby 2011 EVN would purchase 33.6 TWh from third parties (i.e., private power producers, joint \nventure companies, and imports) out of the total generation of 125.0 TWh compared with \n12.5 TWh purchased from IPPs in 2006.  \n10.  Fuel consumption is based on the projected plant mix and the fuel expenses were \nderived based on the expected fuel prices in Viet Nam\u2019s domestic fuel prices. The coal prices \nare kept at around $24\u2013$28 per ton during 2006\u20132011. Although these prices are less than the \nprevalent international coal prices, the quality of the coal used by EVN is of lower quality and is \nnot directly comparable with international prices for good quality coal.  However, the fuel costs \nare expected to increase from 2012 when Viet Nam starts using imported coal for power \ngeneration. The gas prices are based on production share agreements signed with international \ngas field developers.  \n3.  Capital Expenditures \n11.  The cumulative capital investments to be made by EVN during the 2006\u20132011 period \namount to D219 trillion ($13.7 billion) compared with D81.5 trillion ( $ 5.6 billion) incurred during \n2000\u20132005. The debt service commitment during 2006\u20132011 will also increase to D78 trillion ($ \n4.9 billion) compared with D20 trillion ( $ 1.4 billion)  in the previous 6-year period. In addition to \ndirect investments, EVN is planning to form joint venture companies to implement some power \ngeneration  projects  in  2006\u20132011.  The  direct  investments  by  EVN  and  EVN  investments \nthrough joint ventures in power generation will be complemented by investments by non-EVN \nentities, including the private sector, in new IPP plants. \n12.  Although EVN\u2019s internal cash generation is projected to reach D134 trillion ($8.4 billion) \nduring  2006\u20132011,  the  significant  portion  of  the  investments  would  be  financed  by  new ", "  Appendix 9  45 \nborrowings  amounting  to  D154.7  trillion  ($9.7 billion).  This  indicates significantly  increased \nlevels  of  borrowings  compared  with  the  2000\u20132005  period  when  EVN\u2019s  net  borrowings \namounted to only D48 trillion. In the absence of significant equity injections, this investment plan \nwill substantially increase EVN\u2019s debt and its debt service requirements. The debt to equity ratio \nwould increase to 65:35 in 2011 from 57:43 in 2006 and the debt service requirements in 2011 \nwould be D21 trillion ($ 1.3 billion) compared with D4.8 trillion ( $ 300 million) in 2006, resulting \nin the debt service coverage ratio dropping to 2.13 by 2011. This trend reflects EVN\u2019s transition \nfrom a lightly geared utility, because of lack of access to debt financing prior to 1995, to a more \ntypical utility in a fast-growing economy. \nD.  Future Developments \n13.  EVN  is  moving  away  from  its  traditional  role  of  generating  its  own  electricity  to \npurchasing a considerable amount of electricity from third parties, and then transmitting and \ndistributing  it  to  end  users.  There  is  a  strong  case  for  splitting  EVN  into  a  number  of \nindependent entities\u2014such as transmission, distribution companies, power stations (where the \nstate\u2019s  shares  in  these  entities  are  held  by  a  holding  company)\u2014as  a  way  of  increasing \ntransparency in the functioning of the electricity market. The Government has approved the \n\u201cequitization\u201d (partial privatization with EVN holding more than 50% of share capital) of most \npower generation plants and regional power companies. As of December 2007, three power \nplants have been equitized, including a 1,000 megawatt (MW) coal power plant, a provincial \npower  distribution  utility,  and  17  non-core  businesses.  The  liabilities  associated  with  the \nequitized entities are transferred to the equitized entity and the par value is computed net of the \nliabilities. The cash proceeds from the equitization will improve EVN\u2019s cash flow. However, the \ndebt-equity ratio of EVN as a consolidated entity will not be affected as EVN intends to hold a \nmajority stake in the equitized entities.  \nE.  Proposed Covenants \n14.  Because of the delay in approving the tariff increase, the lower than expected tariff \nincrease, and increasing capital investment, EVN\u2019s self-financing ratio is likely to be between \n25% and 30% during 2007 and 2008. Given EVN\u2019s increasing indebtedness, a maximum long-\nterm debt to equity ratio of 70:30 and minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 are proposed \nas financial covenants to ensure EVN\u2019s debt level and debt service capacity remain within \nprudential limits. Although the debt to equity position is steadily increasing and the debt service \ncoverage ratio is decreasing, they remain within these limits during the forecast period. A \nminimum self-financing ratio of 25% is imposed to ensure that EVN generates adequate cash \nflows  to  finance  a  reasonable  portion  of  the  capital  investments  to  retain  the  company's \nleverage within prudential limits. EVN has complied with these covenants from 2004 to 2006. \nWhether EVN will comply with loan covenants in future years depends to a large extent on the \nfuture tariff increases and fuel price fluctuations.  \nF.  Financial Management Assessment of EVN and the Management Board  \n1.  Staffing, Accounting Policies, Budgeting System, and Payments  \n15.  The proposed project will be implemented by Song Bung 4 Hydropower management \nboard (the management board), a newly created project management board of EVN responsible \nfor implementing the Project.  The management board currently has about 45 employees, with \nspecialists in engineering, environmental, resettlement, economics, and finance. The finance \ndepartment has four staff.  EVN and the management board are required by the Government to \n ", "46   Appendix 9 \ncomply  with  Vietnamese  accounting  standards.  Accordingly,  EVN  has  adopted,  for  all  its \nbusiness units, uniform accounting policies and procedures for documentation of transactions. \nThe consolidation of accounts takes place at the EVN head office and consolidated accounts \nare later converted to International Accounting Standards.  \n16.  EVN  and  the  management  board  have  experience  in  the  efficient  management, \nbudgeting, and disbursement of funds in previous projects as the management board was \ncreated by splitting former the Hydro Power Project Management Board No. 3 which had \nmanaged several projects, including the proposed Project, until December 2007. The Project\u2019s \nbudget estimates will be prepared in sufficient detail for all significant activities under each \nproject component. Actual expenditures will be compared with the budget at least on a quarterly \nbasis,  and  explanations  will  be  prepared  for  significant  variations  from  the  budget.  The \nmanagement board can approve deviations of up to D30 billion ($ 2 million); any amount above \nthis needs EVN approval. The management board director has full authorization to execute all \ntransactions  under  the  Project.  The  financial  director  is  responsible  for  recording  the \ntransactions. Bank reconciliation is prepared by account staff and approved by the director. The \nmanagement board is responsible only for project construction. Once complete, the Project will \nhanded over to another part of EVN that will be responsible for its operation and maintenance.  \n17.  Although the management board is not a separate company, it prepares its own annual \nfinancial reports. Its balance sheet is incorporated into EVN\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. When \nthe management board procures new assets for a particular project, these are added to the \nbalance sheet of the management board. When a project is complete, the assets associated \nwith the project are removed from the management board\u2019s balance sheet and transferred to \nthe EVN entity that will operate and maintain the project. \n2.  Reporting \n18.  As the management board is responsible only for implementing the Project, it will maintain \nseparate accounts for the Project. It will submit progress reports to ADB on a quarterly basis. \nThe  reports  will  provide  a  narrative  of  progress  made  during  the  period,  changes  in  the \nimplementation schedule, problems or difficulties encountered, and the work to be carried out in \nthe  next  period.  The  progress  reports  will  include  a  summary  financial  account  for  the \ninvestment component, including project expenditures during the period. The quarterly progress \nreports will be submitted to ADB within 1 month of the end of each quarter.4  \n \n18.  In addition to the quarterly reports, within 6 months of the close of the financial year, the \nmanagement board through EVN will submit to ADB annual audited accounts of EVN and \nannual audited financial statements of the Project. The annual project accounts will contain \ndetailed descriptions of the fund sources and expenditures. The annual financial statements of \nEVN consist of an income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and related notes to \nfinancial statements. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on \nthese reports. It will meet with EVN, the management board, and the Government annually to \ndiscuss Project progress. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB by EVN within 3 \nmonths of Project completion.  \n                                                 \n4  EVN progress reports for past and ongoing projects have been submitted on time and the quality of these reports \nwas adequate. ", "  Appendix 9  47 \n3.  Internal Audit and External Audit \n19.  Financial statements of EVN are currently audited annually by independent auditors. \nExperience from previous projects indicates that there have been no delays in EVN audits since \n1999.  Audits  of  EVN  have  been  conducted  mostly  in  accordance  with  the  International \nStandards on Auditing for public institutions.  EVN established its Internal Audit Department in \nMarch 1998. It is headed by a chief of internal audit supported by five professional accountants. \nCurrently, EVN relies heavily on direct supervision, detailed reporting, and authorization from \ntop management for internal control. Based on the financial management assessment, EVN and \nits  Project  management  boards  have  satisfactory  internal  financial  control  and  oversight \nmechanisms to ensure that the project funds will be utilized for the intended purpose and that \nrecords will be maintained on how the funds are utilized.   \n ", "     \n4\n8\n \nTable A9.1: Viet Nam Electricity Income Statement, 2000\u20132011   A\np\n(D billion)  p\ne\n  n\nd\nItem  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  ix 9\n \nSales   16,510  19,210  23,566  30,246  34,530   37,273  43,766  54,148  68,040  81,185  94,689  107,334 \nOther income  271  553  580  729  892   741  1.165  2,688  3,379  4,029  4,694  5,316 \n    Total Income  16,781  19,763  24,146  30,975  35,422   38,014  44,931  56,836  71,419  85,214  99,383  112,649 \n                         \nCost of sales  9,112  10,824  12,031  13,510  18,367   23,047  27,663  34,956  41,543  44,076  49,940  54,979  \nSelling costs  336  405  477  655  748   811  1,307  1,246  1,564  1,864  2,172  2,460 \nAdministration costs  771  1,025  1,157  2,464  1,171  1,784   2,114  2,352  2,906  3,451  4,012  4,543 \nDepreciation  4,462  5,135  7,056  8,376  8,085   9,100  9,993  10,574  12,372  14,946  18,535  22,388  \n    Total Operating     \n    Expenses  14,681  17,389  20,721  25,005  28,371  34,742  41,033  49,128  58,386  64,337  74,659  84,370 \n                         \nOperating profit  2,100  2,374  3,425  5,970  7,051  3,272  3,854  7,708  13,033  20,876  24,725  28,280 \nFinance charges  550  587  783  1,032  1,313  1,608  1,847  1,828  2,692  3,679  5,126  6,026  \nProfit from associates  \u2014  \u2014   \u2014      \u2014    37  37  51  52  52  \nForeign exchange \nloss/(gain)  154  246  314  3,088  1,500  (2,370)  (41)  680  843  1,003  1,165  1,297 \nProfit before tax  1,396  1,541  2,328  1,850  4,238  4,034  2,048  5,237  9,536  16,246  18,486  21,010 \nTax  514  541  678  20  906  1,195  355  1,456  2,660  4,535  5,162  5,868 \nProfit after tax  882  1,000  1,650  1,830  3,332  2,839  1,693  3,781  6,876  11,711  13,324  15,142 \n                         \nOperating margin (% of \nsales)  12.5  12.0  14.2  19.3  19.9  8.6  8.6  13.6  18.2  24.5  24.9  25.1 \nReturn on fixed assets \n(%)  9.9  8.7  9.0  12.7  13.4  5.4  5.8  14.7  21.5  28.1  26.0  24.6 \nReturn on equity (%)  3.2  3.5  5.2  5.2  8.6  6.5  3.4  8.0  12.8  18.5  17.7  17.0 \n\u2014 = not available, ( ) = negative. \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates for 2007\u20132011 and published accounts of EVN for 2000\u20132006. \n ", "   \nTable A9.2: Viet Nam Electricity Balance Sheet, 2000\u20132011  \n(D billion) \nItem  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011 \nCurrent Assets                   \n1.

The Project \ncost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by \nremoving the effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations. \n \n \nB.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n2.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) has been calculated in real terms based \non the capital composition detailed in Table A10.1 \n \nTable A10.1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nFinancing Source  Amount  % of Financing \nAsian Development Bank Loan  196.0  73.3 \nDomestic Bank Loans  22.3  8.4 \nEquity  49.0  18.3 \n         Total Project Cost  267.3   \n      Source:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  The  real  cost  of  foreign  debt  has  been  calculated  based  on  the  10-year  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR) swap1 rate of 4.5% plus the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nspread of 0.2%, and the Ministry of Finance relending fee of 0.3% (on annualized basis), an \nincome tax rate of 28% per annum, and an international inflation rate of 1.0% per annum. On \nthis basis, the cost of foreign debt, in real terms, has been computed at 2.57%. The nominal \ninterest cost of the domestic bank loan is 8.5%. After adjusting for income tax rate of 28% and \ndomestic inflation rate of 4%, the after-tax real cost of the domestic bank loan is 2.04%.

Financial Internal Rate of Return \n5.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was calculated over a 40-year period (5-year \nconstruction period plus 35 years operations) on an after-tax basis. The price contingencies and \ninterest and commitment fees during construction period included in the cost estimates were not \ntaken into account in the financial analysis. The value added tax (VAT) on capital investments is \nnot  considered  in  the  financial  analysis  as  EVN  recovers  it  from  VAT  collected  from  its \nconsumers. The plant output is estimated to be 378 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the dry season \nand 113 GWh in the wet season. The electricity output is valued at $0.044 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh based on the prevailing prices for power procured from independent power producers. \nThe operation and maintenance expenses of the power plant is assumed to be The FIRR and \nthe NPV calculated at a discount rate equal to the WACC of the Project are 6.49% and $110.6 \nmillion respectively. \n \n \n6.  It is also expected that additional revenues may be sought by selling certified carbon \nreductions (CER) due to the Project under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The \ncash outflows during the operation phase include the operation and maintenance costs and the \nenvironment and social mitigation costs. The carbon emissions due to the Project have been \nestimated at 217,879 tons per year based on a carbon emission factor of 534.5 tCO per GWh \n2 \nfor Viet Nam power grid, computed using the approved methodology ACM0002 version 7 of the \nCDM  Executive  Board.  Revenues  from  the  sale  of  CER  are  estimated  conservatively  at \n$10/CER ton. When CDM revenues are taken into account, the FIRR improves to 7.60% and \nthe net present value (NPV) at the discount rate equal to WACC of the Project improves to \n$158.2 million. \n \n ", "  Appendix 10   53\nD.  Sensitivity Analysis \n7.  A number of scenarios were tested to determine the sensitivity to a number of variables, \nincluding a 10% increase in capital costs, a 10% reduction in electricity output, and a 1-year \ndelay in implementation.  A sensitivity analysis that combined these adverse scenarios was also \nundertaken (Table A10.5). \n \nTable A10.5: Sensitivity Analysis \n \n  NPV   \nFIRR     without  NPV with \nwithout  FIRR with  CDM  CDM \nScenario  CDM (%)  CDM (%)  ($ million)  ($ million) \n Base  Case  6.49  7.60  110.6  158.2 \n10% increase in Capex  5.79  6.84  91.3  139.0 \n 1-year delay  5.98  6.98  96.3  141.7 \n10% reduction in electricity  5.75  6.79  81.3  124.2 \nproduction \n10% increase in Capex and 10%  5.05  6.05  61.1  103.9 \nreduction in electricity production \n10% increase in Capex, 1-year  4.65  5.56  47.7  88.6 \ndelay and10% reduction in \nelectricity production \nCDM = Clean Development Mechanism, Capex = capital expense, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, \nKWh = kilowatt-hour, NPV = net present value. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Conclusion \n8.  The FIRR is 6.49% compared with the project WACC of 3.46% (both computed on an \nafter-tax basis) and the net present value when discounted at WACC is equal to $110.6 million.  \nThe FIRR improves to 7.60% and the NPV to $158.2 million when CDM revenues are taken into \naccount. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR will exceed the WACC under combined \nevent adverse circumstances.  Although the Project is financially viable without considering the \nCDM revenues, the CDM revenues are important to provide a rate of return on the equity \ninvestment in the Project that exceeds the hurdle rate of return (8%) of EVN.  Given the overall \nobjectives of the Project, the financial performance is deemed acceptable, and the Project is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. \n ", " 54  Appendix 11     \nENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT \n \nA.   Introduction \n \n1.  The summary environmental impact assessment (SEIA) in Supplementary Appendix B \nsummarizes the environment impact assessment (EIA) in Supplementary Appendix C. They \nwere  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines and Environment Policy (2002), and the SEIA was disclosed on the \nADB website on 21 August 2006. The Project is classified category A in accordance with ADB \nenvironmental classification criteria. The Project is located in the Bung river, a tributary of the Vu \nGia river in Quang Nam province. \n \nB.  Technical Alternatives to the Project \n2.  Technical Alternatives. At the pre-feasibility stage of the Project, two options were \nstudied: with and without a diversion of the water after power generation to the Cai river. The \nalternative without trans-basin diversion was selected mainly for environmental considerations. \nWater  diversion  would  alter  the  natural  conditions  of  both  the  Bung  and  Cai  rivers.  Two \nalternative locations for the power station were also considered: one at the foot of the dam and \nthe other about 5.5 kilometers (km) downstream. A power station located at the dam foot would \nslightly reduce environmental impact by eliminating the river bypass. However, the option to \nlocate the power plant 5.5 km downstream was adopted on economic grounds as the capacity, \nfirm power, and total annual electricity output would increase significantly as a result of the \nhigher head provided by the river bypass. A minimum operating level (MOL) of 220 meters (m) \nwas considered as an alternative to the proposed 195 m MOL. A higher MOL (i.e., 220 m) with a \nlower  water  level  fluctuation  in  the  reservoir  would  give  better  conditions  for  natural  fish \nproduction in the reservoir. However, this would provide a very small active reservoir volume, \nand the power plant would be effectively operated as a run-of-river plant with insufficient firm \npower capability. The flood mitigation potential would also be reduced significantly. From a \ntechnical and economical evaluation, the alternative with 195 m MOL was therefore adopted \n \nC.  Anticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n3.  Hydrology. The natural mean annual inflow into the reservoir has been estimated at \n63.5 cubic meters per second (m3/s). The driest month of the year is April with a mean inflow of \n27.0 m3/s and a minimum flow of about 4.5 m3/s. November is the month with highest mean \nmonthly inflows of 183.0 m3/s. The Project will alter the natural flows of the river downstream of \nthe dam. The flow will be negligible in the river section between the dam and the power plant.    \n \n4.  Because of the storage provided by the reservoir, the average monthly flow during the \ndry season downstream of the power plant will increase, while the average monthly flow in the \nwet season will decrease. However, peaking operation will cause daily fluctuations in flow and \nwater levels in the river downstream of the power station outlet. The flow downstream of the \npower station in the driest months will range from about 0.2 m3/s when the power plant is not in \noperation (usually at night) to 93 m3/s when the power plant is operating. Inflow from the \nintermediate catchments and over spilling at Song Bung 4 and A Vuong hydropower projects in \nthe wet season will add to these flows. The magnitude of water level fluctuations will vary along \nthe river, depending on the cross-sections at different locations and distance from the power \nstation. Downstream of the immediate vicinity of the power station outlet, the water level can \nfluctuate  quite  suddenly  during  startup  of  the  generators  and  the  maximum  water  level \nfluctuation is estimated at 1.5 m. About 25 km downstream of the power plant in the Vu Gia ", "  Appendix 11   55\nriver, after the confluence with its largest tributary, the Cai river, the maximum water level \nfluctuation is estimated to be 0.6 m.1 To moderate the rapid water level fluctuations, especially \non the first few kilometers downstream of the power station, it is recommended to start and stop \nthe power station in a stepwise sequence in coordination with the national load dispatch center. \nThe  start-up  procedure  at  the  power  station  will  be  preceded  by  warning  sirens  to  warn \ndownstream river users.   \n \n5.  Soil Erosion. Much of the land cover in the project construction area has grass and \nshrub vegetation on steep slopes, and is prone to erosion and landslides. All top soil will be \nscraped off at project sites (stored for reuse), and temporary acquired land and spoil areas will \nbe rehabilitated after completing construction. Sand will be acquired from the riverbank in Cai \nriver near Thanh My where there is no topsoil. The soil pits and rock quarries will be filled and \nappropriately planted with trees, shrubs, and grasses. Rehabilitation will include (i) immediate \nre-vegetation (using fast-growing species), (ii) installation of sediment runoff control devices, \nand (iii) erosion and re vegetation success monitoring.  \n \n6.  Water  Quality. In the first years after reservoir impoundment, the erosion rate will \nincrease in the reservoir embankments, and along the river downstream of the power plant. This \nimpact is expected to slow down after 3\u20135 years. Erosion of the watershed is also expected to \nincrease  in  general  because  of  increased  human  activity,  particularly  related  to  forest \ndegradation, agricultural activities, and road construction. However, the heavier sediment will be \ntrapped in the reservoir, as opposed to being carried downstream. In the initial years after \nreservoir impoundment, the water discharged from the reservoir will have low oxygen content \nbecause of decomposition of organic material from the inundated biomass. The discharge water \nwill  also  contain  high  levels  of  nutrients,  which  will  cause  some  eutrophication  (nutrient \nenrichment) impacts downstream. These effects are expected to last only for 2\u20135 years, as the \nreservoir will become oligotrophic (nutrient poor) in a short period.  \n \n7.  Flora and Fauna. Potential impacts on flora and fauna include (i) vegetation loss during \nconstruction activities; (ii) potential increase in illegal logging, fuel wood and non-timber forest \nproduct collection, and illegal hunting (also in Song Thanh Nature Reserve); and (iii) localized \ndisturbance  to  wildlife  (e.g.,  macaque  and  turtle  populations).  Removal  of  vegetation  is \ninevitable at the construction sites but damage can be minimized by careful removal of trees. All \nplant and animal species, and vegetation communities are widely distributed and species loss is \nminimal. Surveys in the project sites did not reveal any special habitats for protected animals. \nHowever, construction activity will disturb animals that may come close to the project sites from \nnearby forested areas. The project will affect the Song Thanh Nature Reserve by inundating an \narea of 143 hectares (ha). The inundated area has been subject to logging and illegal hunting in \nthe past, and is now used for non-timber forest products collection. \n \n8.  Aquatic Ecology. Long distance migratory species of fish are likely to affected because \nof the barrier effect of the dam. The large water level variation in the river between the dam and \nthe confluence with Cai river will strongly reduce the biological productivity of the river. In the \nstretch downstream of the confluence with Cai river, the impacts on fish will be smaller.  The \nProject will result in a loss of river habitat along a 30 km stretch upstream of the dam, which will \nbe replaced by a reservoir with a large 27.5 m water level fluctuation between full supply level \nand minimum operating level (regulation zone). Most of the aquatic life in the regulation zone \nwill die because of periodical dry-up. The regulation zone, especially steep slopes, are likely be \nheavily eroded, resulting in a denuded, inorganic, desert-like zone of sand, gravel, and stones \n                                                 \n1  This will be reduced when the downstream Song Bung 5 Hydropower Project is built. \n ", " 56  Appendix 11     \nwith  reduced  nutritional  value    for  the  bottom-dwelling  animals.  In  the  first  years  after \nimpoundment,  fish  productivity  will  be  relatively  good  because  of  the  supply  of  food  and \nnutrients from the inundated terrestrial land. Over time, fish productivity is expected to be \nmarkedly reduced. Only a few fish species will succeed in adapting to a lake life. In the \nreservoir, the biodiversity of fish is expected to fall by 30\u201350%. However, most of the species \nwill survive in small populations in the upstream of the reservoir and in the tributaries.  \n9.  Cumulative Impacts. The Project is one of eight hydropower projects planned in the \nVu Gia-Thu Bon river system. All the projects are planned to be commissioned before 2016, \naccording to Master Plan VI for Power Development. Currently, two of the projects are under \nconstruction with total installed capacity of 372 megawatts (MW). The six remaining projects, \nincluding Song Bung 4, have a total capacity of 782 MW. The relatively small Song Bung 5 \nreservoir downstream of Song Bung 4 will act as a re-regulation reservoir for the upstream \nhydropower plants Song Bung 4, Song Bung 2, and A Vuong\u2014resulting in smaller water level \nfluctuations downstream of the Song Bung 5 dam. The hydropower projects will be operated in \na way that increases the downstream flow in dry months and decreases the flow in wet months. \nIncreased flow in dry periods will give a more secure supply of water for irrigation, domestic and \nindustrial use in the downstream areas. On the floodplain, where most of the water users are \nlocated, increased flow in dry season may also reduce the negative impacts from salinity \nintrusion from the sea. To some extent, the reservoirs can also reduce the frequency and \nmagnitude of floods.  \nD.  Environmental Management Plan \n \n10.  Before  the  commencement  of  project  construction,  the  Song  Bung  4  Hydropower \nmanagement board will set up an environmental management unit (EMU) for environmental \nmanagement and operation, including supervision of contractors to ensure compliance with \nEMP. The EMU will ensure implementation of the EMP, including the environmental monitoring \nplan during construction and operation of the Project. The EMU will coordinate all environmental \nmonitoring activities as summarized in the SEIA and in the EIA. The EMU will ensure that the \nEMP is updated periodically during the construction period. An independent environmental \nsupervision consultant, as part of the independent monitoring agency will supervise and monitor \nenvironmental  procedures.  The  EMU  will  submit  reports  (including  physical  data)  on \nimplementation of the EMP to the Executing Agency, Department for Natural Resources and \nEnvironment of Quang Nam province, and ADB biannually during construction and annually for \n2 years after the commissioning of the Project.  \n \nE.  Conclusion \n \n11.  Major  potential  environmental  impacts  from  the  Project  will  include  (i)  soil  erosion,  \n(ii) loss of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity, (iii) increased pressure on Song Thanh Nature \nReserve,  (iv) loss  of  river  continuity  because  of  the  dam,  (v)  a  river  section  with  strongly \nreduced flow, and (vi) daily water level fluctuations downstream of the power plant. Mitigation \nmeasures have been proposed to minimize and regularly monitor the impacts. By implementing \nthe EMP, the adverse environmental impacts of the Project can be minimized to acceptable \nlevels.  The  proposed  Project\u2019s  anticipated  environmental  benefits  include  less  emission  of \ngreenhouse gases, a general contribution to development of the area, irrigation benefits in the \ndry months of the year, and a positive contribution to minimize the salt intrusion problem in the \nfloodplain.  \n ", "  Appendix 12  57 \n \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT AND ETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN \n1.  Scope  of  Resettlement  and  Ethnic  Minority  Impacts.  Land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  and  related  social  impacts  are  anticipated  in  four  geographic  zones.  The \nresettlement impacts of the Project in these four zones are described below and a summary of \nresettlement-related impacts is presented in Table A12.4. The detailed resettlement and ethnic \nminority development plan (REMDP) is in Supplementary Appendix A, the gender action plan is \nin Supplementary Appendix F, and the  Social Management Plan for the construction phase \n(including the health action plan) is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n2.  Reservoir Inundation Area. Six villages of Zuoih commune in Nam Giang district will be \naffected by flooding of Song Bung 4 reservoir, and 206 ethnic minority households in four of the \nsix villages will be physically relocated. The remaining two villages, Thon Vinh and Pa Toi in Ta \nBhing commune, will lose part of the upland agricultural and grazing land belonging to 52 ethnic \nminority households, but the residential area will not be affected. Relocation of the four villages \nwill entail loss of houses, community facilities such as schools and health centres, rice fields, \nfields for other crops and vegetables, forestland, and fishing grounds; associated social stress; \nand consequent changes in lifestyles and livelihoods. One of the villages, Pa Rum A, will be \ndisplaced only from its residential lands and rice fields, while its other crops and forestland will \nnot be flooded. Resettlement of the reservoir-affected villages is described in detail in the \nREMDP volume 2. \n3.  Project Construction Land Areas. The Project will require about 550 hectares (ha) for \nconstruction sites, including for the dam site, power house, access roads, quarries, spoil areas, \nrelocation of the flooded section of highway 14D, and 220 kilovolt (kV) and 35-kV transmission \nlines. As the project design available is to the level required for the feasibility study, the design \ndetails  of  auxiliary  components  of  the  Project,  including  the  transmission  line  and  the  \n5.4  kilometer  (km)  access  road  to  the  dam  site,  are  indicative  with  respect  to  location, \nalignment, and size. Based on the available design, a maximum of 94 households (540 people) \nin Thon Vinh village could lose agricultural lands, and approximately one third of these 94 \nhouseholds (31 households) could lose more than 10% of their productive assets. The only \nstructures to be displaced might be 10 temporary field huts and graves. In nearby Pa Toi village, \nwith 23 households (22 Co Tu, 1 Kinh) and 109 people, the losses would be only upland rice \nland, and no household would lose more than 10% of total productive assets.1  \n4.  For the 220 kV transmission towers, it is estimated that only 0.81 ha, or 0.2% of total wet \nand upland rice areas would be lost in the 13 villages along the preliminary alignment. No \nhousehold would lose more than 10% of productive land. For the 35 kV transmission line that \nwill be located along the existing highway 14D and access road to the project site, the current \nlevel of design indicates no structures or productive land or trees would be impacted. For the \nmain construction components (including the dam site, tunnel adits, power house, and intake \nsite) where there is a feasibility level of design, only 15 ha of land will be required\u2014consisting of \npublic forest (11 ha), scrubland (3.5 ha), water surface (0.6 ha), and no cropland. All land will be \nacquired with associated compensation and income restoration to current owners and users. \nLand acquisition for project construction land is addressed in the REMDP, volume 3.    \n5.  Upstream and Downstream of the Dam. The upstream and downstream social and \nlivelihood impacts are caused by two main hydropower project features. \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB) Operations Manual F2/BP footnote 12 and this Project\u2019s resettlement policy define \nphysical displacement from housing and/or loss of 10% or more of productive, income-generating assets as major \nimpacts requiring rehabilitation measures\u2014not just compensation for losses. \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \n(i)  Creation of the dam and reservoir. (a) The dam will block fish migration and \nthus significantly affect upstream and downstream catch of migrating species; \n(b) the dam and reservoir will cause sediments to settle in the reservoir, and the \nclear water that will be released will have fewer nutrients for aquatic life, and \nrejuvenation of the alluvial plains; and (c) the released water will be colder and \ndeoxygenated, which will make it less favorable for aquatic life. \n(ii)  Operation of the power station. (a)  There will be daily river level fluctuations; \n(b) the ecology and reproductive biology of aquatic species will be affected by the \nblocking of migratory routes; (c) in DS Zone 2 (see below) some river bank \nerosion will occur, which will affect some river bank gardens and crop land; and \n(d) access to the river for (1) domestic water collection, and (2) domestic animals \nwill be more difficult.  \n \n \n6.  For  social  and  livelihood  impact  assessment,  the  downstream  is  divided  into  three \nzones.  \n \n \n(i)  Downstream zone 1: between Song Bung 4 dam site and confluence with Song \nCai (Pa Dau 2 is the only village in this zone). \n(ii)  Downstream zone 2: around the confluence of Song Bung river with the Song \nCai river (Dai Son commune, consisting  of eight villages, is located in this zone, \n(iii)  Downstream zone 3: further downstream from the confluence (after which the \nriver is called the Vu Gia) until the Song Quang Hue, a short channel connecting \nthe Vu Gia to the Thu Bon.  \n \n7.  Tables A12.1 and A12.2 contain the number of households that are likely to be affected \nby the impact on fisheries and other impacts. Upstream and downstream social impacts are \ndescribed in more detail in the REMDP, volume 4. \n \nTable A12.1: Number of Downstream Fishing Households  \n \nNo. of Households \nDownstream Zone  Total  Fishing Subsistence  Commercial  \nZone 1  Pa Dau 2 Village  39  34  34   \nZone 2  Dai Son Commune  679  98  66  32 \nZone 3  Other 9 Communes  25,067  1,678  1,437  241 \nTotal      1,810  1,537  273 \n              Source: Resettlement and Ethnic Minority Development Plan of Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project. \n \nTable A12.2: Number of Downstream Households Affected by Non-Fisheries Impacts \n \nRiverbank \nTotal number   Domestic Water  Other Social or \nGardens Erosion, \nof HH  Impacts  Cultural Impacts \nDownstream Zone  No. of HH \nZone 1  Pa Dau 2 Village  39  0  0  Yes, cultural \nExact impact \nYes: (a) safety,  \nZone 2  Dai Son Commune  679  125  uncertain, but not \n(b) river transport \nsignificant \nZone 3  10 Other Communes  25,067  \u2014  \u2014  No  \n\u2014 = not available, HH = household. \nSource: Resettlement and Ethnic Minority Development Plan of Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project. \n ", "  Appendix 12  59 \n8.  Upstream of the Dam. The reservoir inundation will result in a loss of 30 km of river \nhabitat, which will be replaced by a reservoir with water level fluctuation (planned 27.5 meters \n[m] between full supply level and minimum operating level). In the first years after regulation, \nfish productivity will be relatively good because of the supply of food and nutrients from the \ninundated biomass. However, over time, fish productivity will be markedly reduced and the \npotential for the fish harvest will be low. The portion of their fish catch that is made up of \nmigratory species will be lost as these species will no longer be able to complete their migration \ncycles. The number of villages that may be affected by this, and the importance of migratory \nspecies in their fish catch, is the subject of ongoing investigations. Impacts on livelihoods will be \ncompensated for and restored, as described in more detail in the REMDP, volume 4  \n9.  Scope  of  the  REMDP.  As part of project preparation, social, gender, and poverty \nanalysis  was  carried  out  in  the  project  areas.  A  census,  an  inventory  of  losses,  and  a \nsocioeconomic survey were carried out for the reservoir inundation area, the project lands, and \nthe areas upstream and downstream of the dam. The REMDP for project lands will be updated \nafter  detailed  design. Detailed  village  development  plans  will  be  prepared  for each  of  the \nreservoir impacted villages during project implementation. A detailed plan to mitigate upstream \nand downstream impacts will be prepared during project implementation. \n10.  Legal Framework. The REMDP has been prepared for the Project in accordance with \nthe requirements of Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), Policy on Gender and Development (1998), and Public \nCommunications Policy (2005). The REMDP was also prepared in compliance with laws of the \nGovernment of Viet Nam, principally Decree 197/CP (2004) as amended by Decree 17/CP \n(2006). The Vietnamese legal framework brings resettlement in Viet Nam very close to ADB\u2019s \nstandards,  but  there  are  still  some  gaps,  particularly  in  interpretation  and  implementation. \nProvisions and principles adopted in the REMDP for the Project will supersede the provisions of \nrelevant  decrees  currently  in  force  in  Viet  Nam  wherever  a  gap  exists.  The  Project  will \nimplement a programmatic approach to resettlement that is similar to a rural livelihood project \nand  includes  technical  assistance  (TA)  through  the  proposed  JFPR  grant  and  transitional \nassistance until the resettlers can sustain their own livelihoods. \n \n11.  Grant Financing to Close the Gaps between Government and ADB Policy and \nPractice.  ADB  policies  and  government  legislation  have  similar  objectives  of  improving \nconditions for the poor and vulnerable, but the understanding of what this means and the \napproaches to resettlement and ethnic minority planning are significantly different, especially \nwith  respect  to  livelihood  restoration  and  improvement.  For  example,  the  Government\u2019s \napproach to resettlement is to provide basic inputs\u2014resettlement, some cash compensation, \nrice supplements for 1\u20133 years, agricultural land, limited or no access to forest and fisheries on \nwhich resettled people previously depended to supplement their subsistence agriculture, and no \nor  inadequate  skills  training.  In  most  cases,  the  compensation  is  only  short-term  and \nimplemented through top-down approaches. This is not a very sustainable way of restoring the \nlives  and  livelihoods  of  affected  persons  in  a  sustainable  manner.  Prevailing  government \npolicies do not require compensation for adverse impacts on livelihoods that do not result from \nrelocation, such as upstream and downstream impacts.  \n12.  Funding  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  has  been  secured  to \nfinance an enhanced livelihood program that goes beyond the approach followed on projects \nfinanced by Viet Nam Electricity (EVN) in Viet Nam. The intention is not only to restore or even \nimprove the livelihoods of the poor and vulnerable, but also to demonstrate to the Government \nhow resettlement can be considered as a development opportunity, and to build local skills. The \nproposed grant would finance (i) an enhanced livelihood program aimed at improving and \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \nsustaining the livelihoods of reservoir resettlers, as well as people in downstream areas who \nwould experience loss of their fisheries-based livelihood; and (ii) consulting input to manage the \nimplementation of enhanced livelihood program in a sustainable manner.  \n13.  Entitlements. Project entitlements have been designed to provide for compensation, \nresettlement, and rehabilitation for lost land, assets, infrastructure, resources, income sources, \nand services, so that affected persons would be at least as well-off after the Project as they \nwould have been in its absence. The poorest affected persons and others who are most \nvulnerable to the risks of impoverishment caused by involuntary resettlement2 will be assisted to \nimprove their standard of living above the national poverty line. Non-vulnerable households will \nbe assisted to restore their pre-project socio-economic status. There will be no differentiation \nbetween people with and without legal title to land. A separate detailed entitlement matrix has \nbeen prepared for each of the project areas in the REMDP, volumes 2, 3, and 4. \n14.  Ethnic  Minorities  and  Other  Vulnerable  Groups.  All  affected  households  in  the \nreservoir area belong to the Co Tu ethnic minority, with the exception of four Kinh households \nand four households of Kinh men married to Co Tu women. The majority of the population in the \nproject lands areas (but not along the 220 kV transmission line) and in one of the villages \ndownstream of the dam are also Co Tu. The overall aims of the REMDP are to: (i) address the \nimportant issue of culturally sensitive development for project-affected persons, (ii) significantly \nimprove the livelihoods and standard of living of the ethnic minority and other vulnerable project-\naffected persons, (iii) provide effective safeguards against adverse impacts, and (iv) ensure that \nthe affected persons have been consulted fully and have participated in the decisions that affect \nthem.  \n15.  Resettlement Strategy. The four Zuioh commune villages that will be displaced by the \nreservoir will be relocated to resettlement sites within close proximity of their current village \nsites. Two of the villages, Pa Dhi (62 households, 282 people) and Pa Rum A (44 households, \n196 people), will move within their own village boundaries; only the residential area and rice \nfields  of  Pa  Rum  A  will  be  flooded,  not  the  rest  of  its  land.  The  third  village,  Thon  2 \n(48 households, 229 people), will move 3 km away into the territory of another village, Papang \n(21 households, 85 persons), which will become a host village. The consensus of the fourth \nvillage, Pa Rum B (52 households, 264 people), is that most of the village will move 4\u20138 km to \ntheir former village territory and the rest will go to Papang. A primary school will be built in each \nvillage.  The  commune  center  will  be  reestablished  in  Pa  Dhi  and  a  sub  center  will  be \nestablished in Papang. A secondary school and health center will be built in Pa Dhi and \nPapang. The host population of Papang will also receive benefits including schools, health \ncenter, lands, water supply, and an irrigation system. The resettlers and host population will \nundertake detailed village planning and design, and house construction with support from the \nProject.  New  access  roads  and  village  infrastructure  facilities  will  be  built  by  the  Project. \nEnvironmental assessment will be performed for all sites.  \n \n16.  Livelihood  Improvement.  The  approach  to  resettlement  of  the  reservoir-affected \nresettlers is based on restoring and improving livelihoods in the case of vulnerable groups. The \napproach to income restoration and livelihood improvement is through a combination of upland \nrice, wetland rice (where topography permits), and livestock; and exclusive access to forest \nthrough  a  community-based  forest  management  program  and  fishery  resources,  including \nreservoir fisheries to the extent possible. The livelihood plan, which has been designed in \n                                                 \n2  Vulnerable  groups  include  households  with  income  levels  below  the  national  poverty  line,  ethnic  minority \nhouseholds, landless households and those headed by women, the elderly, disabled, and children without means \nof support. ", "  Appendix 12  61 \nconsultation with affected persons, will be detailed into village and household level plans during \nimplementation.  \n17.  Options  for  income  restoration  for  affected  persons  in  upstream  and  downstream \ncommunities have also been designed in consultation with the affected people. For land-based \nlosses, providing replacement land will be the priority.  Although the cash compensation is likely \nto be preferred by affected persons, other options will be considered that revolve around self-\nemployment and livelihoods options that will enable restoration of pre-project socioeconomic \nstatus. Income and protein from downstream fisheries losses will be restored through alternative \nlivelihood options, such as replacing fish loss with fishponds or support for enhanced livestock \nprogram, which will be developed through a participatory process.  \n18.  Transitional Support and a Phased Exit Strategy for Reservoir Resettlers. The \nProject is taking a development approach of improving living standards and livelihoods, not just \nresettling people and restoring their impoverished pre-project conditions. To do this, the Project \nwill make available an enhanced package of livelihood activities that are similar to their pre-\nproject livelihood activities but with potential for higher yield and productivity.  This is combined \nwith secured land tenure and improved health and education capacity building and training on \nnew agricultural practices, livestock breeding and  preparing fish ponds. All households will be \nassisted as needed with transitional food support until they can become self-sufficient in the \nnew  resettlement  sites.  Resettlers  will  also  be  provided  with  community  development  and \ncapacity building to cope with changing social conditions. \n19.  Participatory  Process,  Disclosure,  and  Grievance  Mechanism.  The  resettlement \nplanning  undertaken  to  date  has  enabled  the  resettlers  to  participate  fully  in  the  detailed \nresettlement  planning  process  so  that  their  concerns  and  needs  are  fully  reflected  in  the \nREMDP. This approach has allowed flexibility and adaptability, particularly in the selection of \nresettlement sites, and design of the resettlement strategy and household livelihood activities, \nso that they are tailored toward the needs and situation of each individual household. Local \nconsultations have been targeted at men and women affected by reservoir inundation, project \nconstruction,  and  upstream  and  downstream  impacts.  Information  on  compensation, \nresettlement, and livelihood options has been presented to all affected men and women by \ntrained  community  and  district  facilitators  through  easily  understandable  visual  materials \ntogether with verbal explanations in the Co Tu language; site visits of village men and women to \nproposed resettlement areas; and open discussions and feedback on proposals, concerns, and \npreferences. All affected persons have been informed and consulted regarding the impacts, and \nproposed mitigation and rehabilitation measures.  \n20.  To ensure that the basic rights of project-affected persons are protected, concerns \nadequately addressed, and entitlements delivered, a grievance mechanism will be implemented. \nThe first level of complaint will be the village resettlement committee, followed by commune and \ndistrict resettlement grievance committees. The commune grievance committee will include the \nCommune Women\u2019s Union chief and another woman representative of the commune, who will \nbe  a  Co  Tu  woman  for  Co  Tu  villages.  The  district  grievance  committee  will  include \nrepresentatives from the Justice Department, Women\u2019s Union, Ethnic Council, and Department \nof Agriculture. \n21.  Institutional Arrangements. A specific set of institutional arrangements and agencies \nwill be established for the direction, management, and implementation and monitoring of the \nREMDP.  Decree  197/CP  assigns  full  responsibility  for  resettlement  implementation  to  the \nrespective  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  (in  this  case,  Quang  Nam  Provincial  People\u2019s \nCommittee) and to the districts affected by resettlement for this Project. The district resettlement \n ", "62  Appendix 12 \ncommittee together with the Song Bung 4 Hydropower management board will establish a \nresettlement management implementation unit (RMIU) to work directly with commune officials, \nvillage resettlement committees, and village resettlement teams in day-to-day implementation of \nthe REMDP. The RMIU will be staffed by some management board staff, but mainly by district \nstaff,  assisted  by  JFPR-financed  consultants.  The  district  and  commune  resettlement \ncommittees will include representatives from the Women\u2019s Union and women from Co Tu ethnic \nminority groups. District and commune resettlement committees for project lands and upstream \nand downstream areas will also include representatives from the Women\u2019s Union. Community-\nbased  male  and  female  extension  workers  will  be  trained  for  establishing  a  sustainable \nextension system for livelihood development in the resettlement sites for Co Tu ethnic groups. \nTraining will be provided through the JFPR grant to demonstrate an improved, sustainable, \ntimely,  and  cost-effective  approach  to  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development  for \nhydropower projects in Viet Nam. \n \n22.  Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring will determine whether the REMDP programs \nare achieving their objectives. Monitoring will be carried out both internally and externally. \nInternal monitoring by the RMIU under the district resettlement committee will focus on the \nprocess and physical progress of resettlement implementation against the schedule in the \nREMDP. External monitoring will be carried out by an independent monitoring agency with \nextensive experience in socioeconomic survey and rural development. Project socioeconomic \nimpacts, including the well-being of ethnic minority groups in the project areas, will be closely \nmonitored. External monitoring will be carried out for the duration of REMDP implementation \nand for an appropriate period after the commissioning of the Project until the objectives of the \nREMDP are achieved. The independent monitoring agency will send their reports directly to \nADB.  \n23.  Implementation  Schedule. Resettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil \nworks  schedule,  so  that  adequate  time  will  be  planned  for  resettlement  activities  to  be \nsatisfactorily implemented before the commencement of the reservoir impounding. For project \nlands, prior to commencement of civil works on a particular project land or group of project \nlands,  all  compensation  shall  have  been  paid  and  relocation  completed  satisfactorily  and \nrehabilitation measures are put in place. Relocation to resettlement sites shall commence only \nwhen the sites have been prepared with infrastructure, domestic and irrigation water supply, and \nhouses ready for occupancy. \n \n24.  Cost Estimates. Table A12.3 presents the current budget estimate to cover REMDP \nimplementation costs. EVN will finance $18 million for costs of activities normally undertaken on \ngovernment-financed  resettlement  projects.  The  JFPR  grant  will  finance  additional  costs, \nspecifically the livelihood improvement costs, including necessary consulting inputs.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nIn recent years, strong economic growth in Viet Nam has resulted in substantial increase in demand for electricity. The draft \n6th Power Development Master Plan expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.5% per annum over the period 2006\u2013\n2020. Electricity demand is expected to grow by 16% per annum over 2006\u20132010. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncountry strategy supports the Government\u2019s energy sector development strategy to supply electricity at an affordable price, \nand to ensure reliable and quality of supply to meet the rapidly growing demand. In particular, ADB will support efforts to \ndevelop new and renewable energy sources, especially in remote and mountainous areas. The rapid economic growth over \nthe past decades has resulted in a sharp decline in poverty rates, from 58% in 1993 to below  20% in 2007 Poverty reduction \nhas been a result of rapid, stable, and inclusive economic growth. The Government\u2019s aim is to maintain economic growth of \n7.5% per annum until 2010, and further reduce poverty incidence to 10\u201311% by 2010. Because of economic growth, Viet Nam \nis already facing a growing deficit of electricity supply. A reliable and sufficient amount of electricity supply is important for \neconomic growth. \n \nB.

Key Issues  \nThe Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project is built on the Bung river, a tributary of Vu Gia river, in Zuoih and Ta Bhing communes, \nNam Giang district, Quang Nam province in central Viet Nam\u2014to sustain economic growth in the region. The Project will \nproduce electricity to cover increasing demand in central Viet Nam. It will significantly affect the economy in the form of \naccelerated economic growth, and creating new jobs and a transport system. Jobs are expected to be created as a result of \nindustrialization, developed transportation and road networks, support services, and other multiplier effects. Following ADB\u2019s \nEnhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004), projects classified as general intervention no longer require project \nlevel poverty assessment. The main project impacts are anticipated in Nam Giang district of Quang Nam province and relate \nto land acquisition and reservoir inundation. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nThe total population of Nam Giang district where the Song Bung 4 Project is located is approximately 20,000. Almost 80% of \nthe population consists of ethnic minority groups and 20% is Kinh (Vietnamese). Among the ethnic minority groups, 56% is Co \nTu, 19% Gie Trieng, and the rest belongs to other ethnic groups. Nam Giang district is one of the districts with high incidence \nof poverty\u2014about 52.6% of the population is below poverty line. The Project will directly affect five communes: Ta Bhing, Ca \nDy, Thanh My, Cha Val, and Zuoih in Nam Giang district. Reservoir inundation will affect ethnic minority people from the \nfollowing villages: Thon 2, Pa Dhi, Pa Rum A, and Pa Rum B in Zuoih commune; and Pa Toi and Vinh in Ta Bhing commune. \nLand acquisition in project construction sites, including the dam site and transmission line, will affect people from 15 villages \nin three communes: Ta Bhing, Ca Dy, and Thanh My.  \n \nReservoir Inundated Villages. The four ethnic minority (Co Tu) villages\u2014Thon 2, Pa Dhi, Pa Rum A, and Pa Rum B in Zuoih \ncommune\u2014will have be relocated for the creation of the reservoir. Some 206 households with a population of 971 will be \nphysically relocated, and 52 Co Tu households in Ta Bhing commune will lose more that 10% of upland cropland and grazing \nland. A further 21 Co Tu households will be affected, as they will be one of the host villages for resettlers. A large percentage \n(45.2%) of the population in the four villages is below 18 years and the education level is low. The majority of Co Tu \nhousehold heads have only elementary education or no education. The most common health problems in Zuoih commune are \nrespiratory infections, influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis, and diarrhea. Malaria occurs mainly in the rainy season. Poverty is \nwidespread in Zuoih commune, which is one of the poorest communes in Nam Giang district. In Zuoih commune, 72.2% of \nthe population lives below the poverty line. A socioeconomic survey in four affected villages indicates that 60% of the \nhouseholds in Parum B and 40% in Parum A do not have sufficient rice supply to last a year. These households relied on a \nmixed staple of rice and cassava. In Pa Dhi, 50% of households depend on mixed staples. Thon 2 village is better off in \ncomparison with the other three villages. These four villages are remote and located far from the district center. They have \npoor infrastructure and social services. The Co Tu villages in Zuoih commune have no access to newspapers but more than \nhalf of the families have radio. The Co Tu people in Zuoih commune are heavily dependent on subsistence farming, non-\ntimber forest products, and river fishery.  \n \n ", "66  Appendix 13 \n \nAnalysis of social, economic, and cultural conditions of the four affected villages are described in detail in volume 2 of the \nresettlement and ethnic minority development plan (REMDP). Reservoir inundation and relocation will entail loss of rice fields, \nfields for other crops and vegetables, river fishery, associated social and cultural traits, and social networks. The REMDP \nincludes mitigation measures and livelihood development programs for the reservoir inundated villages to replace the lost \nassets and livelihoods.  \n   \nProject Lands. Most of the land for dam construction and the transmission line is in nine villages in Ta Bhing and Ca Dy \ncommunes and Thanh My town. Most of the people in Ta Bhing and Ca Dy are Co Tu and Thanh My town is 56% Kinh. The \naffected villages due to transmission line are located along highway 14D and Ho Chi Minh Trail and are accessible throughout \nthe year. The ethnic minority people from these villages have more contact with Kinh people than those in Zuoih commune. \nThe rate of poverty is lower in Ta Bhing, Ca Dy, and Thanh My communes than in Zuoih commune. In Ta Bhing, 50.1% of \npeople (mostly Co Tu) are living below the poverty line; the percentage living below the poverty line is 45.4% in Ca Dy and \n31.5% in Thanh My. Both agricultural land and forestlands will be affected in the impact zone due to the land acquisition for \nproject construction area. Fishponds and cattle grazing may also be affected. Thirty one Co Tu households are likely to loose \nmore than 10% of their productive assets due to land acquisition for project construction lands. The mitigation measures for \nthe affected households are included in the resettlement plan for project lands (REMDP, volume 3). \n \nDownstream Villages. The downstream impact includes 11 communes in Dai Loc district and one village in Nam Giang \ndistrict. People living in downstream villages in Dai Loc district are all Kinh except for one village in Nam Giang district where \nall 39 households are Co Tu. The main impact would be loss of fisheries. The REMDP includes measures to address the \ndownstream impact (REMDP, volume 4). Several Co Tu villages in the upstream area may be affected by loss of migratory \nfish because of the barrier effect of the dam.  \n \n \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations (REMDP, volume 1) were held with the affected communities, government officials, and commune officials to \ndiscuss  the  Project,  resettlement  activities,  impact  of  the  Project,  mitigating  measures,  and  livelihood  improvements. \nConsultations were held with the affected communities to discuss reservoir inundation impacts, proposed resettlement sites, \nand their entitlements, downstream and upstream riverine impacts and proposed entitlements, project construction land \nacquisition, and potential health impacts. Further consultation will be held during the implementation phase.    \n \n2.    What  level  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  envisaged  during  the  project  implementation  and \nmonitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nThe stakeholder analysis identified the various stakeholders and the rights, risks, and responsibilities at the initial stages of \nproject preparation (project preparatory technical assistance phase 1). A consultation plan was prepared based on the \nstakeholder analysis.  The consultation plan implemented during the PPTA phase II was based on the consultation plan and it \nwas implemented by a group of national consultants with expertise in consultations with ethnic minority communities. The total \nbudget for this component was approximately $100,000. \n \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nThe relocation and land acquisition of the Project pose a risk to women\u2019s social, economic, and health conditions. The women \nare more vulnerable to changes in the physical environment and changes to their productive resources as they lack social \ncoping mechanisms.  The Project is likely to disrupt most of social infrastructure in the Zuoih commune due to relocation, \nespecially the health and education services. The Project will also result in Co Tu women having more contacts with \noutsiders, including construction workers, and more access to their villages. This may result in loss of cultural identity and \nexploitation of women including trafficking.   \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan         Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n(i)  Selection of resettlement sites will be carried out in consultation with women representatives from Co Tu villages. \nIn selection of resettlement sites, women\u2019s work in household subsistence will be given priority.
