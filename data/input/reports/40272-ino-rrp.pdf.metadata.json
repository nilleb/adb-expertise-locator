The DPSP series\u2014cofinancing the Development \nPolicy Loan (DPL) series supported by the World Bank and the \nGovernment  of  Japan\u2014is  embedded  in  the  Government\u2019s \nMedium-Term National Development Plan (RPJM) for 2004\u20132009. \nIt  supports  the  RPJM\u2019s  broad  goals  of  stimulating  higher  and \nsustainable economic growth (up to 7% average annual growth by \n2009 from levels of around 4% prior to 2004) and halving poverty \n(to 8.2% by 2009 from 16.6% in 2004). To achieve these goals, \nDPSP-3 supports wide-ranging reforms in three core areas to (i) \nimprove  the  investment  climate,  (ii)  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement and anticorruption, and (iii) improve public service \ndelivery. DPSP-3 is proposed as a single-tranche operation based \non completed actions demonstrating satisfactory progress.  While \nbuilding on reforms undertaken during past DPSPs, DPSP-3 sets \nthe  groundwork  for  an  expanded  policy  dialogue  for  future \noperations. \n   \nRationale  The DPL series aims to harmonize policy reform support from key \ndevelopment  partners.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  DPL  process \neffectively  builds  on  and  deepens  sector-specific  reforms \nsupported  by  ADB  through  its  past,  ongoing,  and  planned \noperations under the Country Strategy and Program 2006\u20132009. \n \nADB\u2019s participation in the DPL stems from its endeavors to reduce \ntransaction  costs  for  its  developing  member  countries.  The \napproach is consistent with ADB\u2019s reform agenda, as outlined in \nthe  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  and  the  Middle-Income \nCountry Initiative. Participation in DPL helps implement and fulfill \nADB\u2019s  obligations  to  the  Rome  Declaration  on  harmonizing \nprocedures of multilateral development banks (February 2003) and \nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (March 2005). ", "ii   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of DPSP-3 will be in the form of higher economic \ngrowth that is sustained over the medium term and lower levels of \npoverty  and  unemployment.  Its  principal  outcomes  include  (i) \nimproved macroeconomic stability, (ii) better investment climate, \n(iii) good governance in public administration, and (iv) improved \ndelivery of public services. DPSP-3 consists of reforms in the latter \nthree core policy areas. \n   \nFinancing Plan  For DPSP-3, the Government has requested ADB to provide a \nloan of $200 million. DPSP-3 provides parallel cofinancing for the \nWorld  Bank  supported  Fourth  DPL  (DPL-4),  for  which  the \nGovernment  has  requested  $600  million.  The  Government  has \nalso  requested  $200  million  from  the  Government  of  Japan  to \ncofinance DPL-4. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A single-tranche program loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR) based lending facility. The loan will have a \n15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; conversion \noptions that may be exercised in accordance with the draft loan \nagreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; \nand such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft \nprogram loan agreement. \n   \nDisbursement  The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n   \nProgram Period  The Program implementation period for DPSP-3 is from January to \nDecember 2007 and the loan amount will be disbursed in a single \ntranche upon declaration of loan effectiveness. DPSP-3 covers \nprogress  made  in  general  macroeconomic  and  key  high-level \nsector reforms during the course of 2007. All actions included in \nthe policy matrix have been implemented within the year. DPSP-3 \nfits within the overall reform agenda supported under the DPLs, \nwhich cover 2003\u20132008. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans, the loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Republic of \nIndonesia as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation \nwill  be  required  if,  during  each  year  when  loan  proceeds  are \nexpected to be disbursed, the value of Indonesia\u2019s total imports \nminus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and ", "  iii\nimports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be \ndisbursed  during  such  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its \ncompliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be \nrequired. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds \nand verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n   \nProgram Benefits and  The key benefits expected from the DPSP series are: \nBeneficiaries  (i)  Progress toward the Government\u2019s medium-term objectives of \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness,  improved \ninvestment  climate,  reduced  corruption,  and  improved \ngovernance. \n(ii) Raising  the  profile  of  key  issues  at  the  ministerial  level, \naccelerating  the  timetable  for  policy  actions  to  be  taken, \naddressing  administrative  and  bureaucratic  bottlenecks,  and \nproviding an impetus for decision makers to further coordinate \nacross economic and line ministries. \n(iii) Institutional development within government institutions, Bank \nIndonesia, and banks. \n(iv) Greater  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  stemming \nfrom implementation of the deposit protection scheme. \n(v) Sustained  ADB  engagement  in  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment on the direction and content of, and strategies for, \nits economic, structural, and institutional reform agenda\u2014with \nDPSP-3  providing  for  policy  continuity  and  consistency  in \nsectors where ADB has been actively involved. \n(vi) Facilitation,  through  crosscutting  reforms,  of  sector-specific \nreforms in areas where ADB is providing or planning support. \n(vii) Harmonization and parallel financing by the key development \npartners (ADB, World Bank, and Government of Japan) around \na common policy framework and dialogue, and the resulting \nendorsement of the Government\u2019s sound policy implementation \nand macroeconomic management. \n \nRisks and Safeguards  Implementation of the DPSP series is subject to the following risks: \n \n  (i)  External vulnerabilities. With its increased integration into \nglobal  capital  markets,  Indonesia  remains  vulnerable  to  such \nexternal shocks as a capital account shock or a global economic \nslowdown.  With  improvements  in  its  macroeconomic  indicators, \nhowever,  the  economy\u2019s  resilience  to  external  shocks  has \nincreased. Factors limiting the potential impact of external shocks \ninclude diversity of exports, limited external debt exposure, and an \nadequate level of reserves. While significant subsidies continue in \nfuel and electricity, by more than doubling domestic fuel prices in \n2005 Indonesia has significantly reduced its vulnerability to volatile \nglobal petroleum prices. The banking sector is also now sufficiently \nstrong to weather a moderate external shock. The maintenance of \na financial sector safety net supported by the DPL/DPSP series \nwill help to improve the resilience of the banking sector. ", "iv   \n \n(ii)  Policy  Coordination  risks.  Economic  volatility  could \nworsen if the Government does not sustain the reform momentum \nto follow up on the reduction in fuel subsidies. Lack of progress in \nstructural reforms or investment in infrastructure could soon lead to \nbottlenecks  which  would  limit  investment  and  potential  growth. \nFollowing  the  volatility  of  the  October  2005  fuel  price  hike, \nhowever, the need for rapid policy adjustment on the domestic \nfront in line with key global developments is clearly recognized. \nThe  Government  and  Bank  Indonesia  have  also  considerably \nenhanced  their  coordination,  which  will  be  reinforced  by  the \nmeasures under DPSP-3. \n(iii)  Fiduciary constraints. Notwithstanding the improvements \nunderway, there are continuing concerns on the utilization of public \nresources.  The  overall  fiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since \n2001 (with the Country Financial Accountability Assessment) have \nindicated  considerable  improvements  in  the  overall  fiduciary \nenvironment in Indonesia. Ongoing programs supported by several \ndevelopment  partners  provide  significant  technical  assistance \nsupport to strengthen fiduciary governance. The DPSP focus on \ntreasury single account implementation will significantly enhance \ntransparency. \n(iv)  Public opposition to reforms. Tariff reforms and some \naspects of investment climate reforms, such as relate to labor, are \ngenerally opposed by the public as well as special interest groups. \nThe Government managed the fuel subsidy reduction well, but \nlabor reforms have slowed. DPSP allows for flexibility, enabling the \nGovernment  to  build  consensus  for  reforms  to  ensure  their \nacceptance.       \n(v)  Heightened  security  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from \nsectarian and regional conflicts and terrorism could slow foreign \ndirect investment and set back the recovering tourism industry. \nThe Government and law enforcement authorities have taken a \nrange  of  measures  aimed  at  rebuilding  public  and  investor \nconfidence. \n \n ", " \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Third Development Policy Support Program (DPSP-3), \nwhich constitutes the second of two subprograms of a program cluster for the DPSP. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  Sector Performance, Issues, and Opportunities \n2.  Ten years after the East Asia financial crisis, Indonesia has transitioned into a very \ndifferent country, becoming in the process more stable, more democratic, and increasingly \nresilient  to  both  internal  and  external  shocks.  The  concern  is  no  longer  one  of  economic \nstabilization and recovery, but is one of achieving and sustaining higher rates of growth to \nreduce unemployment, poverty, and overall levels of vulnerability. To achieve these objectives, \nthe Government is pursuing a pro-growth agenda while pushing forward on broad structural and \ninstitutional reforms. Progress has been made on all fronts, albeit unevenly in some areas. \nDespite recent improvements, there is a continued need to improve the investment climate, \npublic financial management, and service delivery mechanisms to the poor. The DPSP series \nhas  allowed  the  Government  to  work  with  development  partners  in  a  flexible  manner  to \nimplement  critical  high-level  macroeconomic  and  crosscutting  sector  reforms  that  address \nconstraints to growth and poverty reduction while providing predictability of financial support. As \nsuch, its coverage is fairly broad. Governance is a recurring theme throughout the DPSP series, \nas  it  aims  to  promote  transparency  in  all  its  core  policy  areas.  The  proposed  DPSP-3  is \nanchored in the country strategy and program,1 which in turn provides for deeper sector-level \ninterventions to complement the macroeconomic and governance reforms supported through \nDPSP-3. DPSP-3 builds on past DPSP operations to further support the Government on key \nreform measures in the core areas of investment climate, public financial management and \nanticorruption, and service delivery to the poor.  \n \n3.  Sustained Macroeconomic Performance. Economic growth has picked up in 2007 \nfollowing a mild slowdown in 2005 and the first half of 2006 caused by a sharp spike in \nadministered fuel prices and a subsequent hike in interest rates. Year-on-year growth rates \ndipped to 5% through mid-2006, but then recovered to 6% in the second half of 2006 and edged \nup  to  6.1%  during  the  first  half  of  2007.  The  main  drivers  in  recent  growth  were  private \nconsumption, a recovery in private investment, and solid expansion of net exports. These \ndevelopments have been underpinned by a pickup in domestic credit and falling inflation and \ninterest rates. Year-on-year inflation eased to 6.9% in October 2007, from a peak of 18.4% in \nNovember 2005, as the impact of the 126% rise in fuel prices in October 2005 faded. Inflation is \nnow within the Bank Indonesia (BI) inflation target range of 5\u20137%. With the easing of inflationary \npressures, BI, which had earlier lifted its policy rate (SBI 1 month) by 450 basis points in \nresponse to the rise in prices, has lowered interest rates from 12.8% in May 2006 to 8.25% in \nJuly 2007.  In recent months BI has maintained this rate in view of the rising volatility in \ninternational markets, and inflationary developments. \n \n4.  The lowering of the BI rate has led to a corresponding reduction in commercial bank \nlending and deposit rates and a recovery in credit growth. Notwithstanding an easing of deposit \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132009): Indonesia. Manila. ", "2   \nrates, deposit mobilization has continued to gather pace and reflect growing public confidence in \nthe banking sector.  The stronger growth in lending led to increased profitability for banks, as \nlending rates are less elastic than deposit rates with respect to BI\u2019s policy rate. At the end of \nJuly  2007,  banks\u2019  nonperforming  loans  amounted  to  6.5%  (gross)  and  3.o%  (net).  Banks \nremained well capitalized, with a capital adequacy ratio of 20.5%. Indonesia\u2019s strengthened \nfundamentals  and  yield  differentials  have  attracted  significant  foreign  portfolio  inflows  and \nhelped propel the Jakarta Composite Index up by 46.4% between end-2006 and end-October \n2007. The portfolio inflows, in turn, helped to support the rupiah, which has remained broadly \nstable amidst some volatility in recent months.  The overall favorable external developments \nalso led to a fall in the external debt-GDP ratio (one of the main external risk indicators) to 33% \nin 2006 from around 82% in 2001. Citing the improved policy environment, Standard & Poor\u2019s \nraised Indonesia\u2019s sovereign rating from B+ in 2006 to BB- in 2007.  \n \n5.  Fiscal policy remains geared towards accelerating development spending2 while at the \nsame time reducing public debt. Higher social spending has been made possible by the fiscal \nspace of about $10 billion a year generated as a result of reduction in the fuel subsidy, as well \nas  by  increased  revenues  of  about  $5  billion  from  more  effective  tax  administration  and \ndeclining debt service payments. As a result, expenditures on education as a proportion of total \nnational expenditures have gone up from 14.2% in 2004 to an estimated 17.1% in 2007 while \nexpenditures on health have increased from 3.8% to 4.5% during the same period. The overall \nbudget deficit has been gradually increasing in recent years from 0.5% of GDP in 2005, to 0.9% \nin  2006,  and  a  projected  1.5%  of  GDP  in  2007  (versus  a  budgeted  1.1%).  This  reflects \nexpenditures to mitigate the effects of natural disasters and recognition of the need to ramp up \nmuch-needed  development  expenditures,  which  have  been  lagging  behind  those  of  other \ncountries in the region. Before the crisis, development expenditures had been generally around \n7\u20138% of GDP. These dropped considerably at the time of the financial crisis and have been \nfairly stagnant at around 2\u20133% of GDP since then. Although good progress has been made over \nthe past 2 years in reallocating spending from inefficient subsidies towards pro-poor programs, \nthere are concerns over the quality of such spending. That is especially true regarding health, \nwhere more resources appear to be going to services predominantly used by richer income \nquintiles (secondary care). Moreover, spending on health, at below 1% of GDP, is low by most \ninternational standards while total investment on infrastructure (public, private, and state-owned \nenterprises), at around 3% of GDP, is still substantially below pre-crisis levels of 5\u20136% of GDP. \nAs a result, the road network, port facilities, water supply and sewerage facilities, and electricity \nsupply are all in need of substantial new investments.  The proposed budget for 2008 indicates \na significant increase in resources for the infrastructure and social sectors and a small increase \nin the overall deficit to 1.7% of GDP. \n \n6.  Indonesia\u2019s move to decentralization in 2001, when significant authority was devolved to \ndistrict governments, has significantly altered the fiscal fundamentals of the country. In 2006, \nwith the greater fiscal space provided by reduction in the fuel subsidy, transfers to the regions \nincreased from Rp150.5 trillion in 2005 to Rp226.4 trillion in 2006. These are projected to rise \nfurther  to  Rp252.5  trillion  in  2007.  Here  again  there  are  issues  relating  to  the  overall \neffectiveness of expenditure orientation, as increased fiscal transfers to the regions having been \noffset to some extent by the accumulation of regional government bank deposits, reflecting \nlimited implementation capacity at the regional level. As of March 2007, the regions were \nestimated to hold the equivalent of 2.5% of GDP in cash deposits with commercial banks. The \ncentral Government is encouraging local governments to use these large deposits to increase \npriority spending, notably on education, health, and infrastructure. The central Government is \n                                                 \n2  Development spending comprises capital and social assistance spending. \n ", "3 \nalso currently rolling out a community-designed National Community Empowerment Program \n(PNPM) that could become a vehicle for lifting development spending by local governments. \nThe program will provide resources to communities to undertake locally executed small-scale \npublic works projects. \n \n7.  The Government aims to meet the additional financing for the fiscal deficit through \nissuing government securities and through higher concessional borrowing from development \nbanks. In this context, the Government has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nincrease  its  program  lending  from  $600  million  to  $900  million.  Notwithstanding  increased \nbudgetary financing requirements, given the sources of financing and steady economic growth, \nthe total Government debt-GDP ratio is projected to decline to around 35% at the end of 2007 \nfrom 39% at the end of 2006. \n \nTable 1: Indonesia Key \u2013 Macroeconomic Indicators \n                 \nIndicator  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nReal GDP growth (%)  4.5  4.8  5.0  5.7  5.5 \nInflation (%; average of period)  11.8  6.8  6.1  10.5  13.1 \nM2 growth (% annual growth)  7.9  9.8  10.0  13.0  18.1 \nExternal debt (as % of GDP)  67.2  57.7  53.5  46.6  36.6 \nDebt service ratio (as % of exports of goods and \nservices)  32.1  29.8  31.2  38.6  37.5 \nOverall fiscal balance (as % of GDP)  (1.6)  (2.0)  (1.4)  (0.3)   (0.9) \nCurrent account balance (as % of GDP)  4.0  3.5  0.6  0.1  2.6 \nGross official reserves ($ billion)  32  36.3  36.3  34.7  42.6 \n     in months of imports  6.8  6.1  4.8  4.4  4.8 \n( ) = negative.                \nGDP = gross domestic product; M2 = broad money. \nSources: Bank Indonesia, Central Bureau of Statistics, IMF Article IV 2007. \n  \n \n8.

It subsequently had a sharp spike during the Asian financial crisis\u2014\nincreasing to 23.4% in 1999\u2014before declining to the precrisis levels of 16% in 2005. By March \n2006,  however,  the  poverty  incidence  had  risen  once  again  to  17.8%  (translating  into  an \nadditional 4 million people falling into poverty). The rise in poverty is largely attributed to higher \nrice prices, due in part to drought conditions that delayed the planting season, a ban on rice \nimports, and the inflationary impact of the fuel subsidy reduction. More recent data, however, \nsuggest that the pickup in growth since the latter half of 2006 has led to a decline in the \nincidence of poverty to around 16.7% as of March 2007. These levels of poverty, however, \ntranslate to 37.2 million poor people and remain far from the Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) target of 7.6% by 2015, and the Government\u2019s own target of 8.2% by 2009. While the \nlevel of extreme poverty (those living on less than $1 per day) remains relatively low at 8.5%, \nthe proportion living below $2 per day is 49.6%, or about 10 percentage points higher than the \ncomparable  average  for  East  Asia  (including  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China).  These  figures \nsuggest that there is a very large group of near-poor in Indonesia who are highly vulnerable to \nshocks at all levels. The poverty profile in Indonesia also indicates vast regional differences in \n ", "4   \npoverty, with four provinces having poverty rates of less than 10% (with Jakarta at 3.4%) even \nas at least 14 provinces have poverty rates of more than 20% (with Papua at about 50%). A \nchallenge for the Government is that while the poverty incidence is far higher in eastern regions, \nmost of Indonesia\u2019s poor actually live in the densely populated and relatively more prosperous \nwestern regions. \n \n9.  Indonesia\u2019s progress toward meeting other MDG targets is somewhat mixed (Table 2). \nMalnutrition remains a significant public health problem, with the percentage of children under 5 \nyears who are underweight (MDG1, Target 2) rising from 24.6% in 2000 to 28% in 2005. This \nhas been attributed in part to decentralization in 2000, since the responsibilities for the previous \nhighly centralized family nutrition programs were devolved to more than 400 districts. This  \ncreated difficulties in planning, financing, and supervising these programs. On the second MDG \ngoal relating to education, Indonesia is well on track to achieve the target in primary net \nenrollment, but it is falling behind in achieving net enrollment in junior secondary education. In \nrelation to the third MDG on gender equality, Indonesia is on track to achieve gender equality in \neducation. The gender gaps in terms of net enrollment rates in primary and lower secondary \neducation have already been closed. Measured in terms of labor market participation in the \nnonagricultural sector and seats in parliament, however, female participation continues to lag \nbehind that of men. Indonesia is also on track to achieve the MDG target of reducing the \nunder-5 mortality rate by two thirds by 2015, but progress in reducing the maternal mortality \nratio has not been sufficient to meet the levels targeted in the MDGs. While the country remains \non track for achieving the targets for improved drinking water, it is off track with regard to \nattaining the target on access to improved sanitation facilities. The country is severely off track \nin achieving the targets of reversing forestry loss. In most of the MDG-related indicators, sharp \nregional and socioeconomic differentials remain and progress in many instances remains less \nthan has been achieved by the relatively more advanced regional economies. ADB\u2019s proposed \nPoverty Reduction and MDG Acceleration Program will help Indonesia meet these challenges. \n \nTable 2:  MDGs: Indonesia and Comparator Countries (selected indicators) \nGoal 1  Goal 2  Goal 3  Goal 4  Goal 5  Goal 7 \n   Reduce  Improve \nEradicate extreme  Universal primary  Gender  Ensure environmental \nchild  maternal \npoverty  education  equality  sustainability \nmortality  health \nPrevalence \nMaternal  Access to  Access to \nof  Girl-Boy  Under-5 \nPoverty  Primary  Primary  Mortality  Improved  Improved \nMalnutrition  Ratio in  Child \n($1/day  Enrollment  Complet Ratio (per  Water  Sanitation \n  (% under  Primary  Mortality \nheadcount  Ratio (net  ion Rate  100,000  Source,  Facilities \nage 5  Schools,  (per \nratio, %)  %)  (%)  live  (% rural  (% rural \nunder-  (%)  1,000) \nbirths)  pop.)  pop.) \nweight)  \nEconomy  2006   2005   2006   2004   2005   2005   2000   2004  2004 \nIndonesia  8.5  28  94.8 89.0  96.0  36.0  230.0  69.0  40.0 \nCambodia  18.5  45.2  98.9  63.0  92.0  143.0  450.0  35.0  8.0 \nLao  28.8  40.0  83.6  63.0  88.0  79.0  650.0  43.0  20.0 \nPeople\u2019s \nDemocratic \nMalaysia  \u2013  10.6  95.4  98.0  100.0  12.0  41.0  96.0  93.0 \nPhilippines  13.2  27.6  94.4  75.0  99.0  33.0  200.0  82.0  59.0 \nThailand  \u2013  17.6  93.1  \u2013  96.0  21.0  44.0  100.0  99.0 \nViet Nam  8.4  26.6  87.8  87.0  94.0  19.0  130.0  80.0  50.0 \nNote:  Year listed refers to Indonesia, for all other countries it indicates the most recent year available.  \nSources: ADB. 2007.

Translating  Growth  into  Equity  and  Efficiency\u2014Progress  on  the  Governance \nFront. Indonesia has made significant progress in improving governance since the crisis, and \nparticularly  over  the  last  2\u20133  years.  Legal  reforms  on  elections  and  decentralization  have \nresulted in greater transparency and political accountability. There is open public debate on a \nwide range of issues including, among others, the Government\u2019s performance, quality of public \nadministration, corruption, and government support to the private sector. Noteworthy also has \nbeen the Government\u2019s openness and commitment to fighting corruption. The country\u2019s recent \nexperience with democracy has led to a range of institutions dealing with accountability and \noversight. All line ministries have inspectorate generals who are entrusted with internal audit \nfunctions. The government-wide internal auditor BPKP reports to the President. The State Audit \nAgency (BPK) is the external auditor and supreme audit institution, reporting to Parliament. The \ncountry has also established and strengthened a range of independent oversight and judicial \ninstitutions,  such  as  the  Anti-Corruption  Commission  (KPK),  the  Anticorruption  Court,  the \nJudicial Commission, the Police Commission, and the Prosecutorial Commission. The KPK, \nwhich has a strong mandate to fight corruption through prevention and law enforcement, has \nachieved notable success since it became operational in early 2004, and it is the main vehicle \nfor the President\u2019s anticorruption drive. ADB has provided significant support to strengthen the \ncapacity  and  role  of  the  KPK  and  such  other  independent  institutions  as  the  Financial \nTransactions Analysis and Tracking Center and the Attorney General\u2019s Office. \n \n11.  Notwithstanding these developments, considerably more needs to be done.  While the \nPresident has taken anticorruption seriously, there has been no effective bridge to reduce the \nsignificant disconnect between the new vision and the old way of doing business in most of the \nline ministries and other public sector agencies. An anticorruption package (RAN-PK) was \nadopted through Presidential Instruction No. 5/2005 in February 2005, soon after the new \nGovernment  took  over.  With  more  than  100  action  plans,  the  package  was  meant  to \ninstitutionalize preventive measures against corruption. The package is to be updated annually \nto include the latest anticorruption initiatives. In September 2006, an updated version of RAN-\nPK was published, introducing new action plans to improve service delivery, reform the budget \nsystem, and improve tax services. An elaborate monitoring and evaluation system to track the \nprogress of government agencies towards fulfilling targets set out in RAN-PK has also been \ncreated.  Implementation  of  Presidential  Instruction  No.  5  has  been  slow,  however,  and \nparticularly at the decentralized level. \nB.  Program Structure and the Government\u2019s Strategy \n12.  The DPSP supports the development policy agenda of the Development Policy Loan \n(DPL) series prepared by a joint team of the Government of Indonesia, the World Bank, the \nGovernment  of  Japan,  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).3 Building  on  the  support \nprovided by DPSP-2 (approved in December 2006), the proposed DPSP-3 will provide parallel \ncofinancing  support  to  the  Government  to  help  implement  reforms  under  the  fourth \nDevelopment Policy Loan (DPL-4), which is the fourth in a program of four annual, single-\ntranche  loans  to  support  high  level  macroeconomic  and  crosscutting  sector  reforms  to \naccelerate  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  DPL  series  aims  to  help  the \nGovernment achieve its medium-term growth and poverty reduction objectives through four core \npolicy  areas:  (i)  supporting  macroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness,  (ii)  improved \n                                                 \n3  As ADB did not participate in DPL-1, a different title\u2014DPSP\u2014has been adopted for ADB\u2019s operations. Thus, the \nequivalence is as follows: DPL-1 = ADB\u2019s participation through policy dialogue; DPL-2 = DPSP-1; DPL-3 = \nDPSP-2; and DPL-4 = DPSP-3. The proposed program is in line with ADB\u2019s CSP 2006\u20132009 for Indonesia, which \nsupports continued cofinancing of the DPLs. \n ", "6   \ninvestment  climate,  (iii)  improved  public  financial  management  and  anticorruption,  and  (iv) \nimproved public service delivery to the poor.   \n \n13.  The Government\u2019s Medium-Term National Development Plan, or RPJM, aims to achieve \npeace and security, justice and democracy, while advancing the welfare of the people within the \ntime frame of 2004\u20132009. The RPJM includes the main tenets of a previous draft national \npoverty  reduction  strategy  and  incorporates  the  eight  MDGs  that  provide  an  overarching \nframework placing human development and poverty reduction at the center of the development \nagenda. The RPJM has set a number of social targets, some of which are more ambitious than \nthe MDGs. For example, it aims to halve the 2004 national poverty rate of 16.6% to 8.2% by \n2009. The Government\u2019s annual work plan (RKP), approved each year by the Cabinet, guides \nRPJM implementation. The RKPs set out annual development priorities, including quantitative \ntargets and policy directions, which in turn determine the budgetary allocations.4 The RKP for \n2007  has  nine  priority  areas  to  address  the  overall  theme  of  \u201cIncreasing  Employment \nOpportunities and Reducing Poverty\u201d (Figure 1). Of these, the first, second, fourth, fifth, and \neighth priority areas relate to the four core policy areas of DPSP-3, respectively. This linkage is \nelaborated further in Section III. \n \n14.  The  RKP  for  2008  indicates  that  the  overall  development  theme  for  next  year  is \n\u201cAccelerated Economic Growth for Job Creation and Poverty Reduction.\u201d To address this overall \ntheme,  the  RKP  for  2008  has  the  following  eight  priority  areas:  (i)  increasing  investment, \nexports,  and  job  opportunities;  (ii)  revitalizing  agriculture,  fisheries,  forestry,  and  rural \ndevelopment;  (iii)  accelerating  development  of  infrastructure  and  improvement  of  energy \nmanagement; (iv) improving access and quality of education and health services; (v) improving \nthe effectiveness of poverty reduction measures; (vi) corruption eradication and accelerated \nbureaucratic reform; (vii) strengthening defense capabilities and improving domestic security; \nand (viii) disaster response, disaster risk reduction, and improvement of avian influenza control.    \n \n15.  To help implement the RKP priorities, there are several policy packages from which \nspecific measures are derived to be achieved within a defined period. The June 2007 package \non Policies to Accelerate Development and Empower Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises \n(Presidential  Instruction  No.  6/2007)  builds  on  last  year\u2019s  set  of  policy  packages  on \ninfrastructure,  investment  climate,  the  financial  sector,  and  small  and  medium  enterprises \n(SMEs). Through these policy packages, the Government has demonstrated a clear willingness \nto deal with a number of complex, and in some cases politically sensitive, issues that have been \non hold for some time. Each policy package has time-bound actions and stipulates a minister to \nbe responsible for each item. ADB has provided advice that underpins some of the actions in \nthese policy packages and has supported the monitoring of progress on implementation.   \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  In an apparent recognition of the difficulty of attaining the poverty target, the 2008 RKP sets a target of reducing \nthe poverty rate to 15\u201316% in 2008 from 16.7% in March 2007. \n ", "7 \n \nFigure 1: Links between RPJM, RKP, and the DPSP cluster \nRPJM\nMedium-term Strategy \n(3 objectives addressing 33 policy areas) \n \n  Objective 1  Objective 2 Objective 3\nA safe and peaceful  A just and democratic  A prosperous \nIndonesia  Indonesia  Indonesia \nN\na\n  tio\nRKP n\n  a\n  Annual Work Plan  l S\n(9priorityareasin2007) tra\n  te\ng\n    RpPeodvrieuorcrttyiito yan n1 od f   oEpPmpropiorlotruyintmyit ei2en st,   RaPegrvriioictaruilltitzyui rn3eg   ImapnrPodrv iqionurgait layit cy4c oefs s  y for PoSPNK \n  disparities  investment, and  and rural  education and  ve\nexports  development  health services  rty\n   R\n  ed\nu\n  Priority 5  Priority 6 Priority 7 c\n  Eradication of  Strengthening  Disaster mitigation  tion\ncorruption, civil  defense, security  and reconstructing \n \nservice reform, and  and order, and  Aceh, Nias, and \n  law enforcement  conflict resolution  Central \n  Java/Yogyakarta \n \n           \nPriority 8  Priority 9\n      Acc elerating     Developing border \ninfrastructure  areas and remote \ndevelopment  isolated areas \nDPSP = Development Policy Support Program, RKP = Rencana Kerja Pemerintah (Government\u2019s \nAnnual Work Plan), RPJM = Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah (Government\u2019s Medium-\nTerm National Development Plan), SNPK = Strategy Nasional Pengentasan Kemiskinan (National \nStrategy for Poverty Reduction). \n \nNote: Dotted boxes denote areas supported by DPSP program.  \nSource: National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). \n \n \n16.  The  DPSP  Series,  ADB\u2019s  Other  Sector  Programs,  and  Donor  Harmonization. \nSupport for the RPJM through parallel cofinancing of the DPL series is a key pillar of ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program (CSP) for 2006\u20132009. Under the CSP, a dual-track approach is \nadopted  to  ensure  that  the  high-level  macroeconomic  and  governance  reforms  supported \nthrough the policy dialogue of the DPL series complement, and are reinforced by, ADB\u2019s sector \nprograms. Figure 2 presents the approach, which involves structuring ADB\u2019s support through (i) \nparticipation  in  the  DPLs  to  strengthen  the  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  framework  while \naddressing crosscutting concerns; and (ii) sector-specific policy interventions in the areas of \n ", "8   \ninfrastructure, financial deepening, local government finance and public financial management, \nand poverty reduction and accelerated progress towards the MDGs. ADB\u2019s dual-track approach \naims to harmonize and align  development partner  strategies with  Indonesia\u2019s country  strategy \nand priorities. The participation of ADB and the Government of Japan in the World Bank \ncoordinated DPL series, and the participation of the Government of Japan and World Bank in \nADB\u2019s  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  have  helped  reduce  the \nGovernment\u2019s transaction costs of policy dialogue with three of the country\u2019s most important \ndevelopment partners. Moreover, development partner harmonization around the Government\u2019s \nown programs has bolstered country ownership of the reform process and helped change the \nnature of the relationship with the three development partners to one of reliable collaboration. \nADB\u2019s active participation in the policy discussions in all areas of the DPL and the parallel policy \ndialogue on sector reforms have been particularly appreciated by the Government, as these \nhave helped in setting the overall macroeconomic framework for sector-level reforms supported \nby  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in  these  policy  discussions  and  its  strength  in  the  areas  of \ninfrastructure, financial sector, decentralization, and support for achieving MDGs have helped \navoid duplication of effort and improved the monitoring as well as the quality of the triggers.   \nC.  Lessons   \n17.  The proposed DPL is the fourth operation in a program of annual single-tranche loans. \nThe rationale at its inception in 2004 was to support Indonesia\u2019s transition from postcrisis \nrecovery and stabilization to longer-term strategic development. Four years on, the DPL series \nhas succeeded in providing predictable and harmonized budget support from development \npartners. This reflects the overall good progress that has been made in implementing reforms \nand achieving development results (see Appendix 1 Table A1). In this context, it should be \nnoted that while the financing terms of ADB and the other two development partners remain \nattractive, Indonesia can also access domestic and international capital markets. The main \nreasons for involvement, then, are the reinforcement and policy engagement that the three \ndevelopment partners provide in the focus reform areas. The following broad lessons can be \nderived from past and ongoing DPL operations. \n \n18.  Government  Ownership.  The  effectiveness  of  the  DPL  series  has  been  greatly \nenhanced by strong country ownership. The DPL reform measures have been taken directly \nfrom the Government\u2019s policy packages and built on existing legislation. The Government does \nnot therefore regard including policy actions in the DPLs as a conditionality but rather as support \nfor an integral part of its own program. The DPL series has thus provided a means for decision \nmakers to operationalize the RPJM by translating broad objectives into priority actions. In the \nprocess, the DPLs have helped raise the profile of key issues at ministerial level, accelerated \nthe  timetable  for  policy  actions  to  be  taken,  addressed  administrative  and  bureaucratic \nbottlenecks at lower levels of the Government, and provided an impetus for decision makers to \nfurther coordinate across economic and line ministries. The DPL series have also supported \nchampions within the Government to lock in and accelerate key reform measures.   \n \n19.  Selectivity.  Experience  suggests  that  for  the  program  to  remain  effective  and \nsustainable there is a need to focus on just a few and meaningful triggers that can create \nadditional reform momentum. The DPL series has tried to address this issue by focusing only on \na subset of the Government\u2019s broader development program. It does not pretend to capture the \ntotality of reforms being implemented in the core areas of investment climate, public financial \nmanagement, and public service delivery. Nor does it address issues where the breadth and \ndepth of the required policy dialogue across a number of areas would indicate that they be \nbetter  addressed  under  such  sector  programs  as  the  ADB  and  World  Bank  supported \n ", "9 \ninfrastructure reform programs and ADB\u2019s program support for financial sector deepening, local \ngovernment finance, poverty reduction and MDG acceleration.   \n \n20.  Diversity, Flexibility, and Long-Term Engagement. A number of areas addressed \nunder the DPL series have had relatively short reform histories, as many of the reforms were \ninitiated  after  the  Asian  financial  crisis  (i.e.,  public  financial  management,  administrative \nreforms). There is a need to accept that progress in these areas involving significant structural \nand institutional reforms could be slower than in some other areas. The design of individual DPL \nprograms has to some extent taken this into account by enabling a progressive deepening of \nreforms. Thereby, each successive DPL operation has built upon the previous one to ensure \nincremental implementation. While this has led to advances and successful outcomes in a \nnumber of areas (such as the consolidation of core government cash operations into a treasury \nsingle  account  and  the  phased  elimination  of  blanket  guarantees  on  deposits),  in  some \ninstances the reform initiatives have come up against a number of obstacles, ranging from \nbureaucratic resistance to serious capacity constraints. Therefore, in formulating each new DPL \nprogram, it has been important to allow for flexibility to accommodate the evolving country \ncircumstances and political economy. Experience has also suggested the importance of aligning \nwith reform champions within government to push through reforms, as well as the need to \nensure adequate prior buy-in across line ministries and agencies where successful outcomes \ntypically depend on active collaboration across a multiplicity of government institutions. It also \nunderlies  the  importance  of  ensuring  continuous  policy  engagement  and  the  provision  of \ncapacity building support to underpin the reform efforts. \n ", "10  \nFigure 2: Support for the Government\u2019s Medium-Term National Development Plan\nStrategic Framework: Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM)\nOutcomes:  \n(i)  Revive economic growth to achieve 7% average annual real GDP growth by 2009.  \n(ii)  Halve poverty from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% by 2009. \n(iii)  Reduce unemployment by 2009 from the current levels above 10%. \n(iv)  Promote good governance through combating corruption. \n(v)  Ensure peace, safety, security, justice, and democracy for all Indonesians. \nDPL Series (Coordinated by  Close seamless  Sector Programs under the New \nthe World Bank)  coordination  CSP (Coordinated by ADB) \n  moving from   \n(cid:190)  High-level macroeconomic  macro- (cid:190)  Deeper sector-specific \nand cross-sector reforms  economic to  implementation support for policy, \n(cid:190)  2\u20133 strategic triggers per   sector reforms,  institutional, regulatory reforms  \ncore policy area (CPA)  reinforced by  (cid:190)  Each program designed as a \n(cid:190)  Annual program lending  cofinancing  cluster, with subprograms \nsupport where possible  sequencedover18\u201324months\nCPA  1:  Macroeconomic  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program \nStability and Creditworthiness  Cluster \n\u2022  Effective fiscal policy  \u2022  Comprehensive  sector  and  cross-sector  reforms  as \n\u2022  Macro-level  support  for  outlined in the Program Cluster over 2005\u20132010 \ndecentralization  \u2022  Establishment of Project Development Facility \n\u2022  Fiscal-monetary  \u2022  Supporting infrastructure project transactions \ncoordination \n\u2022 Debtmanagement\nCapital Market Development Program Cluster \n\u2022  Enhanced  information  disclosure  and  improved  price \nCPA  2:  Improving  Investment \ndiscovery \nClimate \n\u2022  Deeper and more liquid financial markets \n\u2022  Legal framework \n\u2022  Improved market surveillance and investor protection \n\u2022  Financial stability \n\u2022  Improved governance and human resource capacity in \n\u2022  Macro-level  support  (e.g., \nmarket institutions\nfiscal  incentives,  risk-\nsharing) \nLocal  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform \nProgram Cluster and the State Audit Reform Program \nCPA  3:  Improving  Public \n\u2022  Ex ante planning and budget reforms through Program \nFinancial Management \nCluster \n\u2022  Transparency  and  good \n\u2022  Streamlining fiscal decentralization \ngovernance \n\u2022  Local government level civil service reforms \n\u2022  Institutional measures (e.g., \n\u2022  Improving public financial management (ex ante aspects \ntreasury single account) \nthrough Program Cluster and internal control and audits \nthrough State Audit Reform Program) \nCPA  4:  Improving  Public \nService Delivery \nPoverty  Reduction  and  Millennium  Development  Goal \n\u2022  Establishing  and \n(MDG) Acceleration Program Cluster \ninstitutionalizing  national-\nlevel program evaluation  \u2022  Improving  delivery  of  health,  education,  and  other \ncommunity  services  in  MDG-deficit  areas,  in  a \n\u2022  Targeted  cross-sector \nprogrammatic manner \nreform \n\u2022  Enhancing  accountability  for  service  delivery  at  local \nRPJM  =  Rencana  Pembangunan  Jangka  government and institutional levels, reinforced by well-\nMenengah  (Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  defined standards that are based on clear costing  \nNational  Development  Plan);  DPL=  \u2022  Facilitating  transition  towards  greater  performance-\nDevelopment  Policy  Loan;  CSP=  Country  orientation \nStrategy and Program; CPA = Core Policy \nArea; MDG = Millennium Development Goal. \nSource: ADB. \n \n ", "11 \n \nIII.

The impact of DPSP-3 will be in the form of higher economic growth that is sustained \nover the medium term and accompanied by lower levels of unemployment and poverty. Its \nprincipal outcomes include (i) improved macroeconomic stability, (ii) better investment climate, \n(iii) good governance in public administration, and (iv) improved delivery of public services. \n \n22.

Appendix  6  presents  the  development \npartners coordination matrix, outlining support from ADB and other development partners in \nareas related to the DPSP series. \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n23.  At its inception in 2004, the DPL series was designed to support Indonesia\u2019s transition \nfrom postcrisis stabilization to more long-term development. The DPL was expected to provide \nthe foundation for continued, medium-term policy engagement in the areas of macroeconomic \nstability, the investment climate, and public financial management and anticorruption. It also \nprovided for a flexible means of taking into account the pace and fluidity of the reform process. \nHence, as the program has evolved, the scope of the reform agenda has become broader. The \nbroadening of the agenda has also been accompanied by a deepening of reforms, whereby \nsuccessive DPL operations have built on previous ones to ensure incremental implementation. \nReflecting the Government\u2019s success in recent years in achieving macroeconomic stability and \nattaining the macroeconomic triggers of the DPL program ahead of time, the Government and \ndevelopment partners have agreed to continue the policy dialogue on macroeconomic stability \nand, in view of the progress of reforms, to remove the macroeconomic pillar in the proposed \nDPL-4/DPSP-3. At the same time, the increased fiscal space generated by the reduction in fuel \nsubsidies,  declining  debt  service  payments,  and  increasing  revenues  has  opened  up \nopportunities for a greater focus on public service delivery. Reflecting the ongoing policy focus \non decentralized development and education, it was agreed that there should be a trigger on \ncommunity  designed development and education under a new pillar\u2014improved delivery of \npublic services\u2014in DPL-4/DPSP-3.   \n \n24.  Taken as a whole, the Government is on course to meeting most of the expected \noutcomes of the DPL program by 2008 (some of which having already been achieved). Table \nA1 in Appendix 1 presents the DPL Results Framework presented in the World Bank\u2019s program \ndocument for a proposed DPL-4.  \n \n25.  The DPSP-2 program document laid out 20 indicative triggers (prior actions) across 10 \npolicy  areas  for  DPSP-3.5 Subsequently,  it  was  decided  to  drop  two  triggers  relating  to \ninfrastructure financing and the restructuring of local government debt as these will be covered \n                                                 \n5  Table A3.2 in Appendix 3 of the Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on the \nproposed program cluster and loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Second Development Policy Support \nProgram (November 2006). \n ", "12  \nmore extensively under the ADB-supported Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \nand the World Bank\u2019s proposed Infrastructure Development Policy Loan. DPSP-3 will also not \ninclude a trigger relating to the regulatory framework for issuing subnational government bonds, \nas this will be taken up under ADB\u2019s proposed Capital Market Development Program Cluster. In \ntotal DPSP-3 is, therefore, focusing on 17 triggers across 10 policy areas.6   \n \n26.  In  line  with  the  DPL  modality,  which  has  been  characterized  by  medium-term \nengagement, strong country ownership, and continuous policy dialogue with the Government, \ntriggers are used in a more process-oriented and flexible sense with less of a focus on condition \ncompliance. 7  On  this  basis,  satisfactory  progress  has  been  made  in  complying  with \nrequirements  of  the  triggers.  Of  the  17  triggers,  Indonesia  has  met  or  exceeded  the \nrequirements for 13.  Satisfactory progress has been made on the remaining four.  These four \ntriggers relate to passage of implementing regulations for the investment law, implementation of \ntransparent accountability arrangements for central government investment funding (RDI) and \nregional  development  accounts  (RDA),  setting  up  of  a  national  procurement  office,  and \nintroduction of a mechanism to reallocate unused community designed development (CDD) \nfunds into subsequent budget. In the case of implementing regulations for the investment law, \nthe relevant decrees have been drafted and are expected to be issued before the end of 2007. \nIn the case of RDI and RDA accounts, the regulatory framework for RDA accounts is being set \nup and IT needs are being met.  These actions will be monitored in the next DPL/DPSP round. \nDelays  in  the  case  of  establishing  the  procurement  office  and  CDD  carryover  are  mainly \nprocedural, requiring the signature of the President for the former, and the issuance of a \nministerial regulation for the latter. Both these actions are expected to occur before the end of \n2007.  \n \n1.  Core Policy Area I: Improved Investment Climate \n27.  Indonesia invested the equivalent of over 30% of its GDP prior to the crisis. This has \nsince averaged around 19\u201324%. Such low levels of investment have impeded Indonesia from \ncompeting  effectively  with  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Vietnam,  which  benefit  from \nconsiderably higher investment-GDP ratios. Weaknesses in the investment climate were clearly \nidentified at the outset of the current administration. The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce \nprovided  a  road  map  for  improving  the  business  environment,  and  the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners outlined five high priority policy areas, including (i) taxation, (ii) customs \nclearance and tariff system, (iii) labor regulation, (iv) infrastructure, and (v) investment policy \nand SME promotion. Although businesses continue to face significant constraints, there has \nbeen steady progress. The gross investment rate rose from 19% of GDP immediately after the \ncrisis to 23.5% in 2005 before declining to 22.6% in 2006 due to high interest rates and inflation \nprevailing at that time. Inflow of foreign direct investment increased from $1.9 billion in 2004 to \n$8.3 billion in 2005 and was $7.5 in 2006. Both gross investment and foreign direct investment \nare  projected  to  come  in  at  considerably  higher  levels  in  2007.  Business  confidence  has \nstrengthened  over  the  past  few  years,  with  the  rupiah  among  the  top  six  best-performing \ncurrencies tracked by Bloomberg.  \n \n                                                 \n6  The following section on triggers should be read along with the background information presented in Appendix 3 on \nthe DPSP-3 triggers. \n7  International experience with policy based lending and recent literature on the subject suggests that a focus on \ntraditional conditionality could undermine country ownership and sustainability of the reform process (see World \nBank. 2005. Conditionality Revisited. Washington DC, and ADB. 2007. Policy-Based Lending: Emerging Practices \nin Supporting Reforms in Developing Member Countries (draft). Manila. \n ", "13 \n28.  Nonetheless, Indonesia\u2019s investment climate continues to rank poorly in international \ncomparisons. Transparency International\u2019s 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Indonesia \n143rd  out  of  180  countries,  while  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business  2007  report  ranked \nIndonesia 135th out of 175 economies on ease of doing business. These comparisons are, \nhowever, based mainly on information from 2005 and hence do not reflect recent reforms. More \nrecent  surveys  of  businesses  perceptions  about  the  investment  climate  indicate  significant \nimprovements  between  2005  and  2007,  with  the  biggest  improvement  in  perceptions  of \nmacroeconomic  instability  and  economic  policy  uncertainty  (Figure  3).  Macroeconomic \ninstability is still viewed as the biggest obstacle, however, followed by transportation, corruption, \nelectricity, the legal system and conflict resolution, tax issues, and labor issues. To address \nthese issues, the Government has undertaken a good deal of planning and preparation for its \npolicy packages relating to investment reform. \n \nFigure 3: Constraints to Investment\n(% of firms reporting constraint to be moderate to very severe) \n \n   \nMacroeconomic Instability 53 66\nTransportation 42 49\nCorruption Local Government 48 52\nEconomic Policy Uncertainty 43 59\nCorruption Central Government 43 47\nElectricity 36 42\nLegal System&Conflict Resolution 3941\nTax rate 3839\nLabor skill & Education 3389\nTax Administration 3839\nLabor Regulation Local Government 3377\nCost of Finance 3377\nLabor Regulation Central Government 3345\nLicense & Permits Local Government 3356 end-2005\nCustoms&Trade Regulation-Regional 3336\nCustoms&Trade Regulation-National 32 36\nCrime 2729 mid-2007\nLicense & Permits Central Government 2299\nMonopoly Practices 2288\nFinancial Access 23 28\nTelecommunication 2211\nLand Procurement 16 20\n   \n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n \nSource: Institute of Economic Research/Faculty of Economics of the University of Indonesia. \n2007. Investment Climate Monetary Survey. Jakarta (June). \n \n` \n29.  The investment climate policy package issued in March 2006 listed 85 individual action \nitems assigned to a minister for follow-up responsibility. Fifty-four of these items specified target \ncompletion dates, ranging from March to December 2006. Forty-two of the 54 (or 78%) were \ncompleted by the end of 2006 and several others reached completion in early 2007. The most \nnotable  development  is  approval  of  the  Investment  Law  in  March  2007,  the  implementing \ndecrees of which are included as triggers for DPSP-3. Other key achievements include (i) \npassage by Parliament of revisions to the draft tax laws by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nincorporating  proposals  from  the  business  community;  (ii)  creation  of  new  investment  tax \nincentives for certain sectors and regions (Government Regulation No. 1/2007 specifies three \ntypes of tax incentive: loss carry forward, accelerated depreciation, and investment tax credits); \n(iii) establishment of a team to evaluate draft regional regulations, leading to cancellation of 70 \nregulations; (iv) improvement of the electronic data interchange system at customs to reduce \ncustoms clearance time to 30 minutes in the green lane and 3 days in the red lane; (v) \ncancellation  of  regional  regulations  imposing  taxes  and  fees  on  the  movement  of  goods, \n ", "14  \ntelecommunication  towers,  and  roadside  weigh  stations;  (vi)  elimination  of  VAT  on  certain \nprimary  agricultural  commodities  to  increase  competitiveness;  and  (vii)  simplification  of \nprocedures  for  granting  visas  and  residence  permits  to  foreign  investors  and  expatriate \nemployees. \n \n30.  Labor reform is one of the most sensitive areas critical to improving the investment \nclimate. Revisions to the Labor Law 13/2003 were proposed for April 2006 as part of the \ninvestment policy package. However, following a strong negative reaction from organized labor, \nthe April target could not be met. This represented a setback for investors, as the 2003 law \nsignificantly raised hiring costs. For example, severance pay rates are now far higher than in \nother regional economies, discouraging employers from hiring new workers on a permanent \nbasis. The proposed changes would have addressed this bias against employers and brought \nlabor regulations into line with those of such neighboring countries as Thailand and Malaysia. \nWhile  the  Government  has  indicated  that  there  will  be  no  comprehensive  reforms,  it  is \nnevertheless exploring various options such as linking unemployment benefits to pension funds. \n \n31.  Triggers under Core Policy Area I. DPSP-3 supports reform measures to improve tax \nand customs administration, trade policy, and investment procedures; reduce business start-up \ntimes; strengthen small businesses; and strengthen the financial sector. \n \n32.  Trigger 1: Improve VAT by, among others, reducing the time for VAT refunds through \nimplementation of the DG Tax Regulation No. 122/2006. (Status: Exceeded) \n \nDirectorate  General  (DG)  Tax  Regulation  No.  122/2006  is  being  implemented.  Substantial \nprogress has been achieved in VAT administration. Manufacturing exporters surveyed in June \n2007 reported that the average VAT refund time had fallen to 5.1 months compared with an \naverage processing time of 12\u201318 months in 2003. During the past 12 months, the Government \nhas also settled 7,878 VAT refund claims from previous fiscal years amounting to Rp10.4 trillion. \nThis amounted to more than 99% of the backlog. The Government has signaled its intention of \nfurther reducing the processing times for VAT refund claims by stating in Presidential Instruction \nNo. 6/2007 that the maximum time to process VAT refunds for compliant (\u201cGolden\u201d) taxpayers \nwill be cut from 1 month to 7 days, for low-risk exporters from 12 months to 2 months, and for \nmedium-risk exporters from 12 months to 4 months. Issuance of a DG tax circular letter on \naccelerating the settlement process for VAT refunds in July 2007 has further strengthened \nimplementation of Tax Regulation No 122/2006.  \n \n33.  Trigger 2: Issue MOF Decree on tax audit procedures that allows taxpayers to request \ndetails of audit findings and a review in case of disputes after closing conference but before \ncompletion of audit. (Status: Exceeded) \n \nIn late 2006, the MOF and the Directorate General for Taxes issued a number of regulations \nthat  affected  tax  audit  procedures.  Ministerial  Decree  123/PMK.03/2006  revised  previous \nprovisions related to tax audit procedures and taxpayer rights. The decree was intended to \nstrike a better balance between the rights and obligations of taxpayers and the powers of tax \nofficials. The regulations allow taxpayers to appeal tax assessments or audits without having to \npay 100% of the disputed amount in advance. Taxpayers are also given the right to be present \nduring audit hearings and to receive copies of the results. Article 15 of the decree supports \ntransparent tax audit procedures and strengthened taxpayer rights in disputing audit findings. It \nrequires the tax auditor to inform taxpayers in writing about the results of the audit and closing \nconference, including details on the audit findings and the legal basis for audit decisions. In \naddition, the DG tax regulation on desk audit and field audit procedures stipulates taxpayer \n ", "15 \nrights to bring an audit decision to\u2014and request a review by\u2014a higher level authority in case of \ndisputes. Extended taxpayer rights are also embedded in the Tax Law Package passed by \nParliament in March 2007.   \n \n34.  Trigger 3: Roll out a National Single Window with online clearance of merchandise. \n(Status: Achieved) \n \nThe Government has signed two international agreements with the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) to establish an ASEAN Single Window by 2008. A blueprint for a \nNational Single Window (NSW) was launched on 7 August 2007. A pilot project for Tanjung \nPriok, which handles around 60% of Indonesia\u2019s trade, is currently under preparation with a \nlaunch date of end-2007. Thus far, DG Customs at Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Trade, \nthe Food and Drugs Supervisory Board, the Quarantine of Animals Department at the Ministry \nof  Agriculture,  and  the  Quarantine  of  Fish  Department  at  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  have \ncommitted their readiness for implementing the NSW at Tanjung Priok. These five agencies \nhandle around 70% of total import activity. A pilot for food, beverage, and drugs related products \ncommenced in early October 2007. A nationwide launch and integration into the ASEAN Single \nWindow is scheduled by end-2008. \n \n35.  Trigger  4:  Enhance  procedure  for  tariff  setting  through  implementing  better \nmethodology,  improved  research  capability,  and  better  information  technology.  (Status: \nAchieved) \n \nThe  technical  team  supporting  Team  Tariff  (the  interministerial  team  responsible  for  tariff \nsetting) has been reconstituted by a decree issued by the Finance Minister and its leadership, \nand coordinating functions have been transferred from MOF to the Ministry of Trade. The World \nBank is currently providing assistance to improve the capacity of the technical team. \n \n36.  Trigger 5: Implement the Investment Law, its supporting regulations, and new operating \nprocedures. (Status: Satisfactory) \n \nOf the four implementing regulations to be issued in 2007, two decrees on negative lists (the \ncriteria for negative lists and the negative list itself) were issued in July 2007. To further support \nimplementing  the  law,  a  new  investment  policy  unit  was  established  by  decree  of  the \nCoordinating Ministry of the Economy in July 2007 as a professional secretariat for the National \nTeam on Accelerating Investment and Exports (PEPI). A second ministerial decree created \nthree working groups under PEPI (each chaired by a minister) for policy formulation; policy \nimplementation;  and  integrated  trade,  tourism,  and  investment  promotion.  The  other \nimplementation  regulations  on  investment  procedures  and  one-stop  shops  will  replace  the \ncurrent  investment  approval  system  with  a  simpler  registration  system  and  will  support \nestablishing one-stop shops for business licenses. These regulations have been drafted and are \nlikely to be issued before the end of 2007. \n \n37.  Trigger  6:  Simplify  or  eliminate  unnecessary  and/or  redundant  business  licenses, \nprocedures, and multiple registration requirements. (Status: Achieved) \n \nIn  September  2007,  the  Government  announced  significant  reforms  designed  to  simplify \nbusiness licenses and the time to establish a company. The Minister of Trade issued two new \ndecrees dated 4 September 2007. The first, on the business trading license, eliminates the need \nfor an on-site inspection prior to issuing the license, reduces the number of prerequisites, \nsimplifies reporting requirements, and allows foreign businesses to hold a trading license. It also \n ", "16  \nestablished a 3-day ceiling on the time to issue a license (from the previous 14 days). The \nsecond decree, on business registration certification, also establishes a 3-day time limit (again \nfrom the existing 14 days). On 21 September 2007, the Minister of Justice issued a decree \nsimplifying the procedures to legalize a limited liability company. The decree eliminated the \nrequirement to open a bank account in the name of the new company prior to legalization. This \neffectively removes several preceding steps, such as the need for a Certificate of Domicile \nissued by a local government official, a letter from a building manager, and a lease agreement. \nIt also allows tax registration to take place towards the end of the business start-up process, \nthereby enabling parallel processing in place of sequential processing. At the same time, the \nMinister of Justice issued a decree rescinding a previous decree that transferred the authority to \nlegalize limited liability companies from its central office to its provincial offices, resolving a \nproblem that had added at least 1 week to business start-up times. The combined impact of \nthese changes\u2014if fully implemented by local governments\u2014should cut business start-up times \nby potentially more than a month. \n \n38.  Trigger 7: Issue a comprehensive SME policy package (including supporting industries) \nthat, among others, increases access to finance and implements the Warehouse Receipts Law. \n(Status: Achieved) \n \nThe SME policy package was issued as part of Presidential Instruction No. 6/2007 covering a \nnumber  of  areas  pertaining  to  SMEs.  In  particular,  it  highlights  several  actions  related  to \nimproving SMEs\u2019 access to finance. This includes recapitalizing credit guarantee firms through a \nreallocation from existing SME finance programs of line ministries, thereby reducing the credit \nrisk borne by commercial banks. Implementing regulations for the Warehouse Receipts Law \nhave been issued (PP 36/2007). \n \n39.  Trigger 8: Implement good corporate governance and risk management standards, \nparticularly in state-owned banks, and continue implementation of financial sector safety net. \n(Status: Achieved) \n \nTo promote good corporate governance in the banking industry, Bank Indonesia (BI) issued \nRegulation No. 8/4/PBI/2006 and followed up with a circular letter on 30 August 2006 to the \nmanagements of commercial banks on Preparations for Implementation of Good Corporate \nGovernance Self-Assessment. This circular letter presents guidelines to banks on corporate \ngovernance self-assessment, with self-assessment coming into effect from January 2007. The \nself-assessment is expected to help banks assess their own compliance with the principles of \ngood corporate governance at the individual bank level and take corrective actions. A recent BI \nsurvey  concluded  that  nearly  all  banks  had  carried  out  individual  self-assessments  in \naccordance with the circular and that approximately 98% of banks in Indonesia have applied a \nminimum 50% of the good corporate governance principles, as mandated by the BI Regulation.  \n \nFurther, steps to improve governance and combat money laundering have been taken by BI \nthrough measures for enhanced cooperation with various law enforcement agencies such as the \nIndonesian Police, Attorney General, Indonesian Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis \nCentre, and, most recently, the Anti-Corruption Commission (KPK). BI has also clarified the \nroles and responsibilities of boards of commissioners and directors and addressed areas with \npotential for conflicts of interest. Regulations now stipulate that key board committees should \nhave substantial representation of independent commissioners and that there is to be more \ndisclosure of key developments that could affect shareholder rights. With specific reference to \nstate-owned  banks,  a  joint  decree  on  special  supervision  of  these  banks  to  improve \nperformance and corporate governance was issued in February 2007. \n ", "17 \n \nImplementation of the financial sector safety net program continues, with coverage on deposits \nhaving  been  reduced  to  Rp100  million  in  March  2007,  as  scheduled.  Concern  about  the \npossible flight to safety and flight to quality of deposits consequent to changing the blanket \nguarantee scheme to a limited guarantee scheme proved to be unfounded, as the banking \nsystem seems to have gone through the transition with little impact. \n2.  Core  Policy  Area  II:  Improved  Public  Financial  Management  and \nAnticorruption \n40.  Indonesia has made significant progress in strengthening public financial management \n(PFM), and its efforts have sparked a genuine momentum in the fight against corruption. Taken \nwith the RPJM agenda and overall governance reforms outlined earlier, the PFM measures are \nbeginning to have an impact on the way business is done within the Government. At the \nnational level, the Government aims to have a state-of-the-art PFM system in place by 2008, \nwith support from the World Bank through the Government Financial Management and Revenue \nAdministration Project (GFMRAP) for ex ante aspects of PFM, and with ADB support through \nthe State Audit Reform Program for the ex post aspects focused on internal and external audits. \nPresidential  Decree  80/2003  on  procurement  set  out  the  basic  principles  of  procurement: \ntransparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and  efficiency.  It  covers  all  areas  of \nprocurement that use public funds and is supposed to cover contracting entities at all levels of \ngovernment.  Notable  progress  has  also  been  achieved  in  making  the  national  budget \ncompatible with the international standard Government Financial Statistics classification and \nestablishing a treasury single account (TSA). These reforms are making important contributions \nto increasing efficiency and transparency while reducing corruption in PFM. \n \n41.  However, key indicators of government budget performance have not improved, most \nimportantly the pattern of disbursement. Indonesia still makes 50% of its capital expenditures in \nthe last quarter of the year. For the last 5 years, spending has started very slowly and then \naccelerated.  This  unhealthy  pattern  raises  concern.  Economic  activity  is  disrupted  by  an \nunnatural cycle; project implementation starts late or, as in the case of multiyear projects, is \ninterrupted at the beginning of each year. \n \n42.  With respect to tax administration, despite progress on extending the modern tax office \nsystem, the tax system is still characterized by relatively low revenue generation, poorly defined \nand  overly  complicated  taxes  (i.e.,  creating  excessive  compliance  costs),  and  poor  and \ninconsistent enforcement (i.e., creating uncertainty and abuse). In part, the problem requires \nbetter oversight of tax officials, and in part it stems from a systematic lack of information and \ncapacity for tax and customs analysis outside of the respective tax and customs offices. The \nlack of capacity has led to an inability to accurately assess and forecast implications of the \nproposed tax and customs changes, has reduced checks and balances, and has not permitted \nbalancing taxpayer and government requirements. \n \n43.  Triggers under Core Policy Area II. There are six triggers under this area, focused on \nstrengthening  budgeting,  controls,  and  transparency  in  financial  management;  improving \nprocurement processes and outcomes; and initiating civil service reforms. \n \n44.  Trigger 9: Implement a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) with a system of \nclear forward estimates for the 2008 budget. (Status: Achieved) \n \n ", "18  \nThe 2008 budget submitted to Parliament in August 2007 included for the first time aggregate \nrevenue and expenditure forward estimates based on macroeconomic forecasts (in the past \nbudget submissions were strictly annual). Progress has also been demonstrated in moving \ntoward a policy-based budget by further integrating the planning and budgeting processes in the \n2008 budget preparation cycle. This has resulted in significant budget reallocations to priority \nsectors\u2014particularly  infrastructure,  education,  and  health\u2014while  more  closely  reflecting \ngovernment  policy  priorities  as  outlined  in  the  government  work  plan  (RKP).  These \ndevelopments constitute an important step forward in implementing a full MTEF. \n \n45.  Trigger 10: Continue to consolidate core government bank accounts. (Status: Achieved) \n \nZero-balance banking arrangements with commercial banks were successfully piloted in 50 \nselected regional treasury offices. The tender for administration of operational accounts to \ncommercial banks has been completed in all regions. Rollout of zero-balance arrangements to \nexpenditure accounts in all 178 regional treasury offices occurred on 1 October 2007. This \nconsolidates more than 1,000 balance-bearing treasury accounts into one balance-bearing TSA \nand associated zero-balance accounts. Revenue accounts are scheduled to become zero-\nbalanced  by  the  end  of  2007.  Meanwhile,  substantial  state  funds  continue  to  be  kept  in \ncommercial  banks  that  are  not  recorded  in  the  treasury  system.  Adoption  of  Government \nRegulation (PP) No. 36/2007 on Cash Management, enacted in July 2007, provides the legal \nbasis for a census of all government accounts and enhances the power of the Minister of \nFinance to close unauthorized bank accounts. Identification and closure of unauthorized bank \naccounts is underway with 30 (out of 73) line ministries and agencies having completed the \nprocess by August 2007. \n \n46.  Trigger 11: Implement transparent accountability arrangements for RDI and RDA \naccounts. (Status: Satisfactory) \n \nRegulation  No.  8/2007  has  been  issued,  which  prescribes  the  principles  for  improved \nmanagement  and  transparent  accountability  in  the  management  of  central  government \ninvestment funding (RDI). In addition, detailed procedures have been issued through ministerial \ndecrees  covering  a  wide  range  of  operational  matters,  such  as  execution  of  investments, \nadministration and supervision of investments, management of the Infrastructure Guarantee \nFund, the minimum service standards for investment funds, administrative requirements for \nfinancial  management  of  public  service  agencies,  supervisory  boards  for  public  service \nagencies, and establishing an investment committee for the central government. However, while \nthe regulatory framework for RDI accounts has been put in place, the regulatory framework for \nregional development accounts (RDAs) is not yet complete. While the MOF has also gradually \ncomputerized records of subsidiary loan accounts (onlending), which contain amounts due from \nministries, using a modified debt management information system, accounting for RDI and RDA \naccounts continues to be manual and both banking and record keeping are currently segregated \nfrom the MOF accounting system. Computerization is, however, in progress. A complete and \nreliable listing of individual loan accounts is under preparation but has not yet been issued. \n \n47.  Trigger 12: Operationalize the National Public Procurement Office (NPPO) and issue a \ndraft procurement law. (Status: Satisfactory) \n \nA  new  presidential  decree  has  been  drafted  to  establish  an  independent  NPPO  or  a \nGoods/Services Procurement Policy Development Institute (LPKPP). That would exceed the \nexpectations  of  the  original  trigger  that  had  aimed  at  strengthening  the  existing  National \nProcurement Office in the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). The planned \n ", "19 \ninstitution will report directly to the President with deputies heading three main departments for \nStrategy and Policy Development, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Information Systems. The \ndecree has been finalized and endorsed by the Minister of Planning, Minister of Economic \nAffairs, Minister of State Apparatus, and Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, and it now \nawaits the final signature of the President. The decree is set to be issued in November 2007. An \nindependent procurement agency with adequate resources, authorities, and strong political \nbacking is likely to drive public procurement reform in the future and inject new momentum into \nsuch critical initiatives as finalization of a new procurement law, adoption of standard bidding \ndocuments, e-procurement, and certification programs. A procurement law has been drafted but \nhas not been finalized in part because there was no institutional focal point to propel the \nlawmaking process.   \n \n48.  Trigger  13:  Establish  a  remuneration  commission  or  interdepartmental  team  to \nrecommend pay policy and pay levels for high level state officials. (Status: Achieved) \n \nA new job evaluation and grading system for high-ranking state officials has been completed by \nan interministerial team from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Administrative Reform, and the \nCivil Service Agency. New methods for job evaluation, including new grading standards, have \nbeen developed, and nearly 200 job descriptions intended to cover some 7,000 high-ranking \nstate official positions have been prepared. For the first time in Indonesia, an appropriate pay \ngrade structure has been developed for state officials based on a comprehensive assessment of \nrelevant job factors in a coherent structure of comparative job grades. However, the plans to \nestablish an independent pay commission have been abandoned due to the administrative \ndifficulties and lengthy procedures implied in such an establishment. Instead, and to keep up the \nreform pace, a different and possibly more ad hoc structure (e.g., an interministerial team) \nwould be established to oversee implementing the new grading system and pay scales. \n \n49.  Trigger  14:  Develop  a  comprehensive  civil  service  reform  plan  for  the  Ministry  of \nFinance as a pilot for civil service reforms on a larger scale. (Status: Achieved) \n \nMOF is implementing a comprehensive strategy of reforms related to business process and \nhuman resource management, including remuneration, service standards, and internal ethics. \nThe reforms, targeting the whole ministry including DG Customs and DG Tax, are coordinated \nby a high-level reform team that reports to the Secretary General. Specifically, the following \nareas are addressed:  \n(i)  strengthening  the  human  resource  management  capacity  of  the  Secretary \nGeneral\u2019s office;  \n(ii)  systematic review of business processes in every department to ensure more \neffective service delivery based on new standard operating procedures, including \nworkload analysis;  \n(iii)  improved  overall  human  resource  management  in  the  Ministry  through  (a) \nreformed job classification for every department, including new job descriptions; \n(b)  establishment  of  a  Personnel  Information  Management  System;  (c) \nestablishment of an assessment center; (d) formulation of new guidelines for staff \nrecruitment; and (e) a new approach to career paths for the various departments; \nand  \n(iv)  creation  of  a  remuneration  scheme  based  on  new  job  evaluations  and  pay \ngrades to link pay to responsibilities, complexity, and workload. In the absence of \na national civil service reform effort, a working group consisting of the Supreme \nCourt, Supreme Audit Board, State Ministry of Administrative Reform, and KPK \nare considering how to roll out the MOF pilot more widely. \n ", "20  \n3.  Core Policy Area III: Improved Delivery of Public Services \n50.  As noted earlier, large numbers of poor remain vulnerable, while education and health \noutcomes are not at desired levels. In the context of increased availability of public resources, \nthe  challenges  in  delivering  such  services  include  how  to  (i)  improve  efficiency  of  public \nspending, (ii) improve services quality, and (iii) reduce inequalities in access and outcomes. \n \n51.  The  Government  remains  committed  to  improving  public  service  delivery.  This  is \nexemplified by the decision it took in 2005 to reallocate savings from the fuel subsidy reductions \nin favor of programs targeting the poor. While monitoring the effectiveness of these various \ncompensation  programs  has  led  to  improvements  in  their  design  and  better  beneficiary \ntargeting, lessons learnt have also been used to improve the design of such new programs as \nan individual conditional cash transfer (CCT) program and a community-based alternative that \nwill together cover close to one million households. The CCT program is modeled on similar \nsuccessful programs in other countries, notably in Latin America, and is intended to improve \nhealth and education outcomes. In addition to piloting CCTs, the Government has also built on \nIndonesia\u2019s extensive experience with community-driven development projects by introducing a \nNational Community Empowerment Program (PNPM). This program focuses on improving local \ngovernance and service delivery at the sub-district and village level by encouraging participatory \nplanning and providing block grants.  Funds are generally used for rural infrastructure, or \neducation- and health-related projects.  Set up to be implemented in 2,000 subdistricts in 2007, \nthe program will be expanded to cover the entire country by 2009. Detailed design of the two \napproaches  is  currently  underway  and  a  communications  strategy  and  social  mobilization \nstrategy will assist in ensuring household beneficiaries understand the programs and expected \nresults. Plans also include participatory monitoring and complaints resolution mechanisms.   \n \n52.  Triggers under Core Policy Area III. There are three triggers under this area consisting \nof institutionalized assessments of service delivery mechanisms, competency standards for \nteacher certification, and community spending over multiyear periods.   \n \n53.  Trigger 15: Develop an enhanced assessment framework for selected service delivery \nprograms. (Status: Achieved) \n \nGuidelines are being prepared for BAPPENAS to develop an enhanced assessment framework \nfor selected service delivery programs with assistance from the World Bank. In addition, a new \nposition of Deputy, Monitoring and Evaluation is being created in BAPPENAS. Other initiatives \nin this area include technical assistance from ADB that supports the Ministry of Home Affairs \nDG  for  Regional  Autonomy  in  developing  a  performance  measurement  system  for  local \ngovernments. \n \n54.  Trigger  16:  Establish  competency  standards  for  teacher  certification  and  the \ninstruments for measuring compliance with those standards. (Status: Achieved) \n \nThe  Teacher  Law  issued  in  December  2005  requires  teachers  to  be  proficient  in  four \ncompetency domains: pedagogical, professional, personal, and social. The National Education \nStandard Agency has formalized standards for teachers for each subject within the school \ncurriculum (Ministerial Decree No. 16/2007). Ministerial Decree No. 18/2007 formalized these \nstandards for teacher certification and the mechanism and instruments for certification. The \nMinistry  of  National  Education  began  the  certification  process  for  approximately  190,000 \nteachers in July 2007. The Decree is sufficient for meeting the trigger, but a government \n ", "21 \nregulation on the Teacher Law is expected to be passed in the near future and will supersede \nthe Ministerial Decree.   \n \n55.  Trigger 17: Permit community spending over multiyear periods and clarify procurement \nprocedures for national budget funded CDD programs. (Status: Satisfactory) \n \nThe Government has agreed upon a mechanism that will reallocate unspent CDD funds of one \nyear into subsequent budgets through a revised budget process.  However, a Finance Minister\u2019s \nregulation on this is still pending. The Government has clarified the rules governing procurement \nprocedures in the guidelines for the PNPM, which is due to be released in November (see also \nthe description of this trigger in Appendix 3).   \nC.  Monitoring the Impact of DPSP-3 \n56.  As part of the policy matrix for DPL-1 (prior to ADB\u2019s direct cofinancing involvement), \noutcome indicators were introduced to highlight the expected key results of the support. These \nindicators  were  taken  mainly  from  government  planning  documents.  Additional  outcome \nindicators have been added during the past 4 years reflecting the expanded scope of the reform \nagenda and number of triggers under the DPL\u2019s core policy areas. As the original program was \nextended  by  1  year  (from  DPL-3  to  DPL-4),  the  targets  for  each  outcome  indicator  have \ncorrespondingly been updated to reflect the expected outcomes by 2008.8 These indicators are \nexpected to provide the basis for an evaluation by the World Bank and ADB of the program after \nDPL-4 (DPSP-3). Other indicators, such as the standardized Public Expenditure and Financial \nAccountability used to assess PFM, would also supplement such an evaluation.   \nD.  Triggers for Future DPLs/DPSPs \n57.  The current DPL series ends in 2008, in line with a 1-year extension of the World Bank\u2019s \nIndonesia  country  assistance  strategy  (CAS)  time  frame.  However,  the  Government  has \nindicated strong support for continuing the DPLs in the near future. In anticipation of a continued \nDPL engagement under the next CAS (covering fiscal years 2009\u20132012), a policy program for \nfuture operations has been discussed between the Government and development partners. In \ndeciding on the indicative triggers for the next DPL/DPSP series, there was agreement that, \ngiven the considerable challenges remaining in the existing core policy areas of investment \nclimate, public financial management, and public service delivery (see Appendix 2), the triggers \nwill remain within these broad areas. However, the policy and reform focus will be shifting more \ntoward reforms designed to improve regulations, increase transparency, and deepen institutions \nas required to sustain medium-term growth and social development. In moving forward, the \nGovernment has also articulated its interest in aligning the policy matrix as closely as possible \nto the existing government reform agenda. The Government has asked ADB to support the next \nDPL series and the current CSP contains provision for such support. \n \n58.  Within this reform program, a core set of 19 policy actions were selected to anchor the \npolicy engagement of a future DPL-5/DPSP-4 operation.9 The selection of policy actions was \nguided by the Government\u2019s ability to continue the reform momentum in given areas and, in \n                                                 \n8  The DPL program originally envisioned three single-tranche operations. However the program was extended by 1 \nyear to DPL-4 in line with a 1-year extension of the World Bank\u2019s country assistance strategy for Indonesia. \n9  ADB will only focus on 17 triggers under its next DPSP operation, as a policy action relating to operationalizing the \nFinancial Sector Stability Forum and establishing a uniform database for poverty targeting are already covered \nunder the proposed Capital Markets Development Program Cluster  and Poverty  Reduction  and Millennium \nDevelopment Goals Acceleration Program. \n ", "22  \nsome cases, expand into new but related areas where there was increased reform momentum. \nIn certain areas, the indicative policy actions for DPL-5/DPSP-4 deepen policy actions already \nsupported under previous DPL operations (i.e., moving beyond the National Single Window pilot \ntowards choosing the operator and moving the Treasury Single Account beyond expenditures to \nrevenues). In other areas, policy actions aim to strategically broaden the focus of the policy \ndialogue into new areas in response to openings in the Government\u2019s evolving agenda, such as \nby  working  with  the  Central  Statistics  Agency  to  begin  improving  targeting  of  the  poor. \nConsequently, while some areas are well-advanced and beginning to affect desired outcomes, \nothers are focused on inputs (such as action plans, laws, or organizational changes) and may \ntake longer to translate into progress on outputs and outcomes.  \n \n59.  Under  the  pillar  of  investment  climate,  the  economic  policy  package  (Presidential \nInstruction  No. 6/2007)  provides  a  source  of  specific  policy  measures.  In  particular, \nDPL-5/DPSP-4 triggers will focus on improving entry conditions for businesses by following up \non the Investment Law and negative investment list, and improving the ability of the private \nsector to voice concerns. Improving private sector operations will focus on actions to follow up \non the new Tax Administration Law, the National Single Window, and tariff harmonization. In \naddition, in the next DPL/DPSP series there will be a focus on improving financial markets by \nstrengthening  the  operations  of  insurance  markets,  a  key  nonbank  market.  That  will \ncomplement the work under ADB\u2019s proposed Capital Markets Development Program Cluster. \nFinally, the Government attaches great importance to the economic health and vitality of small \nand medium enterprises, and the focus will be on continuing to improve their access to credit. \n \n60.  Financial management and governance are becoming ever more important in light of \nincreased fiscal space. The next DPL will focus on actions designed to maintain momentum on \nfinancial management. In particular, this should include a focus on the Treasury Single Account \n(underpinning the new budget and treasury system that should roll out in 2009), extending \nbudgeting reforms to improving performance measures, improving the profile of disbursements \nthrough measures designed to anticipate multiyear spending, and improving overall feedback \nthrough support for improved accounting by the line ministries. In addition, procurement remains \na  critical  area  where  improvements  are  needed,  and  it  would  be  important  to  assist  the \ndevelopment and institutionalization of the NPPO while simplifying procedures that have also \nbeen delaying disbursements. Finally, civil service reform will be furthered by extending the pilot \nat the Ministry of Finance to additional agencies.  \n \n61.  The next DPL/DPSP series will also continue to promote improvements in public service \ndelivery that are critical to poverty reduction and other MDG goals. This will complement the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts under the ADB-supported Poverty Reduction and Millennium Development \nGoals Acceleration Program. Three broad areas will be considered: improving the effectiveness \nand targeting of pro-poor programs, the operations of the PNPM program, and reinforcing the \nteacher-based education reforms introduced in DPL-4.   \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "23 \nTable 3: Indicative Triggers for DPL-5 \n \nA.   DPL Core Policy Area I: Investment Climate \n1.  Regulatory Reform \na.  Empower PEPI to coordinate the development of implementing regulations and technical \nguidelines for effective implementation of the Investment Law to undertake a review of the \nnegative list (Perpres Nol. 77/2007), and to oversee compilation of a mapping of business \nlicenses in key economic sectors with recommendations for specific licenses to be \nstreamlined or eliminated.  \nb.

DPL Core Policy Area II: Public Financial Management and Governance  \n5.  Strengthen Budgeting, Controls, and Transparency in Financial Management \na.  Establishment of a comprehensive TSA regime, including revenue accounts. Counterpart \nteam for implementation of the new automated treasury system is in place and is beginning \npreliminary work, including mapping and reviewing of business processes, to increase \nreadiness for system rollout in 2009. Modernization of 30 provincial treasury offices (KPPNs). \nb.  Enhance performance-based budgeting by revising budget templates (for PKA-KL) and \naccompanying budget preparation manuals, as well as the introduction of key performance \nindicators for selected programs in the 2009 draft budget.  \nc.  All DIPAs are issued and teams assigned at the beginning of the fiscal year by eliminating \nannual SK requirement (for project managers) for multiyear projects and allowing for parallel \nprocessing of procurement. An action plan has been drafted to continue leveling out \ndisbursement of capital and material expenditure over the fiscal year. \nd.  Complete a midterm review to assess application of accounting standards and accounting \nprocedure manuals by line ministries. \n6.  Procurement  \na.  Fully operational LPKPP (staffing and budget allocation for operational costs). Simplification \nof Presidential Decree (Keppres) No. 80/2003 to, among others, accommodate a new set of \nstandard bidding documents. \n7.  Civil Service Reform and Governance \na.

DPL Core Policy Area III: Public Service Delivery  \n8.  Strengthened Effectiveness and Pro-Poor Targeting of Public Programs \na.  Institutionalize government system for program evaluation/assessment and use results in \nbudget allocation, program design, and targeting (Government's annual work plan, state \nbudget).  \nb.  Improve effectiveness in subnational spending in issuing guidelines for pro-poor budgeting \nand planning for local governments.   \n9.  Community-Driven Development \na.  Subject to satisfactory performance, adjust community block grant of PNPM to maximize \nemployment and poverty impacts.   \n10. Education \na.  Require teachers (other than head teachers) to be assigned a minimum 24 teaching hours \nper week in order to receive either the professional allowance (for certified teachers) or the \nspecial area allowance (for teachers working in hardship areas), or a combination of both.  \nE.  Financing Plan \n62.  The Government has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance DPSP-3. DPSP-3 provides parallel cofinancing for the World Bank \nsupported DPL-4, for which the Government has requested $600 million. The Government has \nalso requested $200 million from the Government of Japan to cofinance the DPL-4. The loan \nwill have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum;10 conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in \naccordance  with  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  conversion \nguidelines;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  program  loan \nagreement. The Government has made its own independent decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, and it has given an undertaking that this choice was not made on \nthe basis of any advice from ADB. Responding favorably to the Government\u2019s request will signal \nADB\u2019s relevance in an emerging, confident, and well-performing middle-income country \n \n63.  Gross financing needs of the Government have increased from $11.6 billion in 2006 to \n$15.4 billion in 2007. This reflects a higher fiscal deficit on account of increased development \nspending  and  increased  expenditures  relating  to  natural  disasters,  as  well  as  higher  loan \namortization payments. The Government has sought $2.1 billion in program loan financing from \nADB ($900 million), Japan ($400 million), and the World Bank ($800 million). For the proposed \nDPL-4, the World Bank envisages providing a $600 million program loan on International Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development terms. ADB\u2019s proposed support is based on the strengths \nof the policy package, its development impact, the importance of the sectors covered, and the \ninvestment needs. Besides the overall financing needs stemming from a greater focus on \ndevelopment spending, the Government will incur cash outlays in excess of $200 million to \nimplement many of the institutional strengthening measures supported under DPSP-3, such as \nrolling  out  the  National  Single  Window  for  clearance  of  merchandise  and  setting  up  the \nproposed national procurement office. \n                                                 \n10 There will be no commitment charge for the single-tranche loan if it is declared effective and disbursed within 60 \ndays after signing of the Loan Agreement. Currently the waiver on the commitment charge of 0.50% is applicable \nto all interest periods commencing from 1 January 2007 up to and including 30 June 2008.  \n ", "25 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n64.  The  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  will  be  the  Executing  Agency, \ncollaborating closely with MOF. Implementation of the DPL-4/DPSP-3 actions is coordinated \nwith  a  number  of  other  ministries  and  agencies,  including  BAPPENAS,  Ministry  of  Trade, \nMinistry of Cooperatives and SMEs, and BI.   \n2.  Implementation Period \n65.  The program implementation period for DPSP-3 is from January to December 2007. The \nGovernment and the development partners will prepare a program completion report by mid-\n2008.  \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n66.  The program loan of $200 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties \nand taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding the items \nspecified in the negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and imports financed by other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  ADB  provisions  for  simplifying \ndisbursement of program loans,11 the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the \nRepublic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required if \nduring each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of Indonesia\u2019s total \nimports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required.  \n4.  Anticorruption   \n67.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government.  Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program.  In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB in connection \nwith the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program.  In addition, DPSP-3 has a core focus on \nimproving  governance  and  anticorruption.  It  promotes  transparency  in  PFM.  Noteworthy \nprogress has been achieved through the TSA system and in the implementation of transparent \naccountability arrangements for RDI and RDA accounts, which will help the Government in its \nanticorruption  efforts.  The  programs\u2019  focus  on  tax  audit  procedures,  simplifying  and/or \neliminating unnecessary business licenses, and implementing good corporate governance in \nstate-owned banks will also further the Government\u2019s anticorruption agenda and improve the \ninvestment climate. \n \n68.  The Government places significant emphasis on strengthening internal control systems \nand overall PFM, with support from the World Bank through the GFMRAP and from ADB \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "26  \nthrough the State Audit Reform Sector Development Program. Reforms and capacity building \ninitiatives supported under both these programs have led to initial progress in strengthening \nPFM (see the fiduciary assessment presented in Appendix 8). \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n69.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal applications. Prior to withdrawal, the Government \nwill nominate a deposit account at BI to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be managed, \noperated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n70.  The Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs, MOF, and BAPPENAS will continuously \nmonitor implementation of the DPL-related reforms and their impacts, in line with the overall \nprogram framework and outcome indicators agreed upon with the Government. An overall \nevaluation of the program cluster will take place in 2008. \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n71.  The key benefits expected from implementation of the DPSP cluster are \n(i)  progress in meeting the Government\u2019s medium-term objectives through improved \n(a) investment climate, (b) public financial management and governance, and (c) \nservice delivery to the poor; \n(ii)  raising the profile of key issues at the ministerial level, accelerating the timetable \nfor  policy  actions  to  be  taken,  addressing  administrative  and  bureaucratic \nbottlenecks, and providing an impetus for decision makers to further coordinate \nacross economic and line ministries; \n(iii)  sustained  ADB  engagement  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  the \ndirection  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic,  structural,  and \ninstitutional  reform  agenda  (with  DPSP-3  providing  for  policy  continuity  and \nconsistency in sectors where ADB has been actively involved); \n(iv)  aid harmonization and cofinancing by the key development partners (ADB, World \nBank,  and  Government  of  Japan)  around  a  common  policy  framework  and \ndialogue,  and  the  resulting  endorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s  sound  policy \nimplementation and macroeconomic management; and \n(v)  facilitation,  through  crosscutting  reforms,  of  sector-specific  reforms  in  areas \nwhere ADB is providing or planning support. \n \n72.  Institutional.  Significant  benefits  stem  from  the  engagement  of  Indonesia\u2019s  three \nprincipal development partners. Participation in the DPL series has helped in overall institutional \ncoordination  amongst  the  partners  as  well  as  between  the  Government  and  the  partners. \nProvision  of  advisory  support  through  technical  assistance  has  also  been  significantly \nstreamlined and coordinated to best meet the Government\u2019s needs. The measures supported \nunder the DPSP cluster will result in sustained institutional capacity in such key areas of policy \nformulation  as  fiscal  policy,  debt  and  treasury  management,  and  public  expenditure  and \nfinancial management. \n \n73.  Social. The main contribution of support being leveraged through DPSPs is in the forms \nof improved public administration, sustaining effective public expenditure reorientation towards \nproductive needs, and continuously supporting government measures to effectively align its \n ", "27 \nresources  with  its  medium-term  objectives  of  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  By \nfocusing on supporting strategic reforms aimed at improving public service delivery, the program \nwill have direct beneficial social impact. Appendix 9 presents a summary poverty reduction and \nsocial impact mitigation strategy. \n \n74.  Economic. The nature of the DPSP series does not allow for quantitative financial and \neconomic analysis. However, significant general economic benefits will accrue to the entire \ncountry from the policy initiatives within the three core areas under the present phase. \n \n75.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environment. Implementation of the DPSP-3 \nmeasures will cause no direct or indirect involuntary resettlement, nor will it lead to any issues \naffecting indigenous peoples. Based on desk review, the measures supported under DPSP-3 \nare unlikely to have any adverse environmental impacts. \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n76.  Implementation of the DPSP cluster is subject to the following risks: \n(i)  External  vulnerabilities.  With  its  increased  integration  into  global  capital \nmarkets,  Indonesia  remains  vulnerable  to  such  external  shocks  as  capital \naccount  shocks  or  a  global  economic  slowdown.  With  improvements  in  its \nmacroeconomic indicators, however, the economy\u2019s resilience to external shocks \nhas increased. Factors limiting the potential impacts of external shocks include \ndiversity of exports, limited external debt exposure, and an adequate level of \nreserves. While significant subsidies continue in fuel and electricity, by more than \ndoubling domestic fuel prices in 2005, Indonesia has significantly reduced its \nvulnerability to volatile global petroleum prices. The banking sector is also now \nsufficiently strong to weather a moderate external shock. The maintenance of a \nfinancial sector safety net supported by the DPL/DPSP program will help to \nimprove the resilience of the banking sector. \n(ii)  Policy coordination risks. Economic volatility could worsen if the Government \ndoes not sustain the reform momentum to follow up on the reduction in fuel \nsubsidies. Lack of progress in structural reforms or investment in infrastructure \ncould  soon  lead  to  bottlenecks,  which  would  limit  investment  and  potential \ngrowth. However, following the volatility of the October 2005 fuel price hike, the \nneed for rapid policy adjustment on the domestic front in line with key global \ndevelopments  is  clearly  recognized.  The  Government  and  BI  have  also \nconsiderably  enhanced  their  coordination,  which  will  be  reinforced  by  the \nmeasures under DPSP-3. \n(iii)  Fiduciary constraints. Notwithstanding the improvements underway, there are \ncontinuing  concerns  regarding  utilization  of  public  resources.  The  overall \nfiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since  2001  (with  the  Country  Financial \nAccountability Assessment) have indicated considerable improvements in the \noverall  fiduciary  environment  in  Indonesia.  Ongoing  programs  supported  by \nseveral development partners provide significant technical assistance support to \nstrengthen fiduciary governance. The DPSP focus on TSA implementation will \nsignificantly enhance transparency. \n(iv)  Public opposition to reforms. Tariff and some aspects of investment climate \nreforms, such as relating to labor, are generally opposed by the public as well as \nspecial interest groups. The Government managed the fuel subsidy reduction \nwell, but labor market reforms have slowed. DPSP allows for flexibility, enabling \nthe Government to build consensus for reforms to ensure their acceptance. \n ", "28  \n(v)  Heightened  security  risks.  Alerts  stemming  from  sectarian  and  regional \nconflicts and terrorism could slow foreign direct investment and set back the \nrecovering tourism industry. The Government and law enforcement authorities \nhave  taken  a  range  of  measures  aimed  at  rebuilding  public  and  investor \nconfidence. \nV.  ASSURANCES \n77.

Macroeconomic Stability and Creditworthiness \n1.  In early 2004, at the inception of this DPL series, the economy was growing less than \n5% annually, government debt-GDP ratio was over 60%, investment was less than 20% of \nGDP,  and  the  markets  remained  wary  of  the  country\u2019s  long  climb  back  to  a  precrisis \nenvironment  of  sustained  high  levels  of  investment  and  growth.  Given  continued  sound \neconomic management and progress on structural reforms on several fronts since that time, \nmomentum has shifted and has led to improved market confidence. Despite occasional bouts of \nvolatility, the economy is now on a much stronger footing. Recent growth rates (5.6% in 2005, \n5.5% in 2006, and a projected 6.3% for 2007) are among the highest in the region. Indonesia\u2019s \ninternational credit ratings have seen dramatic improvements over the past 4 years, with S&P \nupgrading Indonesia\u2019s credit rating from CCC+ in 2003 to BB- in 2007\u2015reflecting a five notch \nimprovement in 5 years.   \n2.  Smaller budget deficits, along with steady economic growth, have also led to a rapid \ndecline in the debt-GDP ratio. By end-2005, debt-to-GDP had dropped to 47% from 55% in \n2004 and 100% in 1999. That is well below the 60% target specified in the State Finance Law. \nFor 2007, the debt-GDP ratio is expected to fall to approximately 35%, thus achieving the \nexpected outcome on debt reduction envisioned at the outset of the DPL program. Even with \nexpected increases in public investment in the education, health, and infrastructure sectors, \nfiscal sustainability is expected to continue, and the debt-GDP ratio is projected to fall below \n30% in 2010. To bolster the Government\u2019s efforts, the World Bank and Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development  are  supporting  the  development  of  debt  management  practices, \nincluding risk management, staff capacity building, and the provision of policy guidance. \n3.  The Government has also achieved improvements in non-oil and gas tax revenues, \nmainly through the modernization of tax offices. While the increase in revenues over the past 4 \nyears is mostly attributable to higher oil and gas revenues, non-oil and gas revenues have also \nincreased, from 10.4% of GDP in 2003 to a projected 11.4% for 2007. The Government\u2019s \noverriding objective in its tax agenda is to encourage greater and more predictable revenues \nthrough  improved  compliance  and  a  broader  tax  base  while  reducing  rates  to  improve \ninvestment  sentiment.  Over  the  past  few  years,  the  Government  has  increased  taxpayer \nregistration and tax return filings by new and existing taxpayers, and it has improved recovery of \ntax arrears and expanded audit coverage. In December 2004, e-registration of taxpayers was \nintroduced,  as  was  e-filing  in  January  2005.  This  was  accomplished,  in  part,  through  the \nestablishment and expansion of modern tax offices, including, in 2006 and 2007, those targeting \nmedium  and  smaller  taxpayers  that  are  now  responsible  for  by  far  the  largest  share  of \nIndonesian  taxes.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Government  Financial  Management  and  Revenue \nAdministration Project (GFMRAP) is supporting modernization of these offices, including the \nupgrading of facilities and IT systems, staff reorganization by function, increased remuneration, \nand the institution of a taxpayer bill of rights and a tax official code of conduct. In 2007, the \nGovernment continued its program of extending modern tax offices with a major expansion to \nmedium-sized tax offices and through the beginning of a reorganization of the central tax office \nto support the longer-term tax reform agenda.       \n4.  Despite progress on extending the modern tax office system, many problems remain. \nThe tax system is still characterized by relatively low revenue generation, poorly defined and \noverly complicated taxes (thus creating excessive compliance costs), and poor and inconsistent \n ", "  Appendix 2 39\nenforcement (giving rise to uncertainty and abuse). In part, the problem requires better oversight \nof tax officials, and in part it stems from a systematic lack of information and capacity for tax and \ncustoms analysis outside of the respective tax and customs offices. The lack of capacity has led \nto an inability to accurately assess and forecast the implications of the proposed tax and \ncustoms changes, reduced checks and balances, and diminished the ability to balance taxpayer \nand government requirements. As part of its second phase of institutional reorganization in \n2006\u20132007, the Ministry of Finance established a Fiscal Policy Office. This office replaces the \nAgency for Economic and Financial Sector Research and International Cooperation, which had \nitself become operational only in 2005 with the aim of separating fiscal policy formulation and \nimplementation within the Ministry of Finance and to address the weaknesses described above.  \n5.  One  of  the  most  defining  reforms  supported  by  the  DPL/DPSP  program  was  the \ndramatic reduction in fuel subsidies under DPSP-1, which overall reduced the level of subsidies \nfrom 4% of GDP in 2004 to 2.7% in 2007. The result was a substantial reduction in regressive \nfuel subsidies, which was accompanied by a stable exchange rate, inflation, and interest rates. \nMore broadly speaking, with lower subsidies, the central and regional governments were able to \nuse the additional $10 billion a year in reallocated funds for social protection programs that \nhelped to mitigate the social impacts of the fuel price hike on the poor and to focus more \neffectively on human development and such other priorities as increased infrastructure. Overall, \nconsolidated government investment is estimated to be close to precrisis levels as a share of \nGDP in 2007.   \n6.  Despite these successes, there is scope for more reduction of subsidies. While the 2005 \nfuel price hikes were a bold move, Indonesia\u2019s retail prices for gasoline and kerosene still \nremain well below international prices and are not market-based. The Government also faces a \ncritical choice on electricity subsidies. The increases in fuel prices have raised the subsidies \nrequired by Indonesia\u2019s state-owned electricity company as they pass into production costs. In \n2006, the central government spent Rp35 trillion ($3.8 billion) for electricity subsidies, which \nhave been increasing significantly after the fuel price hikes and result in an additional subsidy of \nRp20 trillion. As was the case of fuel subsidies, those for electricity distort consumer and \nproducer incentives and constrain higher value spending. Most of the electricity subsidy is \nabsorbed through a regressive subsidy to consumers (66%), followed by industry (29%), and \nbusiness  (5%)  in  2006.  Reducing  inefficient  spending  with  due  consideration  for  growth \noutcomes and the impact on the poor will continue to be an important topic of analytical work \nand policy engagement between development partners and the Government.  \nB.  The Investment Climate \n7.  After the crisis, investment fell from 30% to 20% of GDP. Such low levels of investment \nhave prevented Indonesia from growing at such rates as do People's Republic of China and \nVietnam, which benefit from high investment ratios of 45% and 32% of GDP, respectively. The \nweaknesses  in  the  investment  climate  were  clearly  identified  at  the  outset  of  the  current \nadministration, with the new Government\u2019s medium-term plan detailing the major constraints \nand proposed solutions. In this context, a major focus has been placed on financial sector \nreforms. Three economic policy packages were issued in 2006, including one on the investment \nclimate, one on infrastructure, and one on financial sector reform. A comprehensive follow-up \npackage was issued in June 2007 detailing 168 specific reform measures to be carried out over \nthe next 12\u201318 months. Many of the key reform areas spearheaded by the Government have \nbeen supported by the DPL/DPSP programs. The DPL/DPSP has been an effective instrument \nfor  promoting  interministerial  agreement  to  push  for  difficult  reforms  that  may  encounter \nbottlenecks at lower levels of the bureaucracy.   \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \n8.  In  general,  these  reforms,  along  with  the  favorable  macroeconomic  environment \ndescribed above, have shown good results in improving the environment for investments. This \nis evident in the strong contribution by investments to economic expansion, which is projected to \naccount  for  about  one  quarter  of  total  GDP  growth  in  2007.  Business  confidence  has \nstrengthened over the past few years. The rupiah has been among the top six best-performing \ncurrencies tracked by Bloomberg this year, and the equity market is one of the best performers \nin 2007. Business perceptions about the investment climate have also improved significantly \nbetween 2003 and 2007.   \n9.  Financial sector indicators also show evidence of solid outcomes in terms of stability, \naccess, and diversification. Capital adequacy ratios remain over 20%, nonperforming loans \ncontinue to decline, and Indonesian banks continue to be among the most profitable in the \nregion with net interest margins of nearly 6%. Loan-deposit ratios continue to show a gradual \nincrease, although there is concern over sluggish loan growth. The proportion of state-owned \nbanks in the overall banking system stands at 36%, which represents a 10 percentage point \ndecrease since 2003 and indicates the increasing role of private banks. Bank Mandiri\u2015the \nlargest state-owned bank\u2015was removed from Bank Indonesia\u2019s intensive supervision as from \nSeptember 2007. Its nonperforming loans had dropped to 3.9%, below the 5% threshold. In \nsectoral terms, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending has been rising rapidly. As of \nDecember 2006, loans to SMEs were 52% of total loans, compared with 47% in 2003, and \nloans to SMEs had grown at nearly 16% over the year. That was higher than the 11% growth of \nnon-SME lending. The deposit insurance scheme was fully implemented in March 2007, and so \nfar without any signs of flight to quality. Minimum paid-up capital for banks has been raised and \nwill be Rp80 billion by December 2007. Thus far, Bank Indonesia (BI) has indicated most banks \nwould be able to comply with this regulation, whereby shareholders are injecting new capital. BI \nalso  indicated  that  only  a  few  small-sized  banks  would  be  unable  to  meet  the  capital \nrequirement, and mergers and acquisitions of small banks by larger banks are ongoing. \n10.  In the area of the regulatory and institutional framework for trade and investment, much \nof the focus up until this year has been on tax and customs reforms. Specific actions have \nincluded efforts to restrict the creation of nuisance and/or economically harmful charges and \nlevies, to challenge tax assessments stemming from disputed audit findings, and to speed up \nvalue  added  tax  (VAT)  refunds  in  order  to  free  up  working  capital  for  export-oriented \nmanufacturing firms. The latter has shown recent progress, as according to manufacturing firms \nsurveyed in July 2007 the average time to obtain a VAT refund fell from 6.3 months in 2006 to \n5.1 months in 2007. The same survey revealed improved perceptions of tax administration, as \n38% of respondents believed that tax administration represented a moderate, severe, or very \nsevere constraint to doing business in 2007 while 57% of respondents had thought so in 2003.   \n11.  While  the  investment  law,  trade  reforms,  and  business  procedures  were  added  to \nDPSP-3  this  year,  these  have  all  benefited  from  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  make \nimprovements in these areas. According to manufacturing firms surveyed in July 2007, average \nimport clearance time dropped to 6 days in the red lane compared with 8 days in 2003. \nIndicators also show an improvement in perceptions regarding customs and trade regulations as \nconstraints to doing business, that figure falling from 51% of respondents in 2003 to 32% in \n2007. Despite improved perceptions and reforms undertaken in recent years, businesses and \ninvestors continue to suffer from an overall poor business climate. While import clearance has \nimproved, for example, 30% of all import shipments in the main port (Tanjung Priok) are still \nsent through the red lane (physical inspection). This is triple the Government\u2019s target of 10% set \nout in last year\u2019s investment climate policy package.     \n12.  Regarding many other aspects of the investment climate, Indonesia also continues to \nrank poorly in international comparisons. The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2007 report ranked \n ", "  Appendix 2 41\nIndonesia  135th  out  of  175  economies  on  ease  of  doing  business,  and  IMD\u2019s  World \nCompetitiveness Yearbook ranked Indonesia 54th out of 55 countries\u2014putting it well behind the \nPhilippines, India, and Thailand. These comparisons are based mainly on information from \n2005, and hence they do not reflect more recent reforms. Despite progress, businesses in \nIndonesia still face a difficult legal and regulatory environment. Strict labor regulations continue \nto create a disincentive to employment expansion, and infrastructure weaknesses raise the \ncosts and uncertainty of doing business. The Government is attempting to address this issue by \nforging partnerships with the private sector. To support Government efforts in this area, ADB is \nproviding technical assistance to strengthen institutions promoting public-private partnerships \n(PPPs) in infrastructure provision, and it is providing a loan to fund a project development facility \nthat will assist in preparing PPP projects at national and local levels for tendering to the private \nsector on a transparent and competitive basis.1 Businesses also face a complex regulatory \nsystem consisting of numerous overlapping, redundant, and unnecessary licenses, each with its \nown prerequisites, and often involving multiple reporting requirements and inspections. The \nresult is a slow, costly business start-up process and a difficult operating environment in which \narbitrary decisions from officials create great risk and uncertainty. While President Yudhoyono \nhad committed publicly to reducing the number of days to start a business to 30 days (adopted \nas an outcome indicator for DPSP-3), current Government estimates suggest the number of \ndays remains high, at 105, although that at least is lower than the 168 days estimated in 2003. \nC.  Public Financial Management and Anticorruption \n13.  Public  financial  management  (PFM)  systems  in  Indonesia  were  left  essentially \nuntouched by reforms and modernization until the beginning of 2000. The systems were heavily \ncentralized, input-based, and largely reliant on manual processing of transactions. PFM was \nbased  on  an  outdated  chart  of  accounts  and  regulatory  framework.  Founded  on \nrecommendations  provided  in  the  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment  and  the \nGovernment White Paper on Reform of Public Financial Management Systems\u2015both issued in \n2001\u2015there has been ongoing reform to modernize the regulatory framework, reorganize the \nMinistry of Finance, improve budget documentation, and streamline the budget preparation \nprocess. These reforms have taken place in the context of Indonesia\u2019s massive decentralization \neffort, which has devolved up to 50% of public expenditures to lower levels of government.   \n14.  The seminal changes to the legal and regulatory framework on PFM came with the \napproval by Parliament of a troika of laws on State Finance, State Treasury, and State Audit in \n2003 and 2004. A presidential decree on procurement in 2003 set out the basic principles of \nprocurement: transparency, open and fair competition, economy, and efficiency. It covers all \nareas of procurement that use public funds and is supposed to cover contracting entities at all \nlevels of government. These laws provide the framework for PFM modernization in line with \ngood international practice.   \n15.  The DPL program has supported a subset of the ambitious PFM modernization agenda. \nIt has supported many of the implementing regulations to put in force the new legal and \nregulatory framework. The DPL program has also helped move forward reforms to reengineer \nbusiness process across the budget cycle, including to make the national budget compatible \nwith  the  international  standard  Government  Finance  Statistics  classification,  consolidate \ngovernment  accounts  into  a  treasury  single  account  (TSA),  improve  fiscal  reporting,  and \nestablish forward-looking budgeting. The DPL has also supported institutional reforms aimed at \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Infrastructure Reform Sector \nDevelopment Program. Manila (Loan 2264-INO (SF), approved in November,  for the equivalent of $26.5 million). \n ", "42  Appendix 2 \nmodernizing the Ministry of Finance. Overall, Indonesia has taken impressive steps in recent \nyears  to  establish  a  sound  legal  and  administrative  framework  for  modern  financial \nmanagement. Changes in the legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete, and \nthe momentum has shifted towards implementation of new financial management practices.  \n16.  In terms of budget reforms, the DPL has supported implementing regulations under the \nfinance law that define fiscal relationships between various parts of government. Provision of \nthe new regulations is ongoing. The budget classification is largely consistent with contemporary \ninternational standards. The Ministry of Finance has taken first steps in developing a medium-\nterm expenditure framework (MTEF) to guide budget policy. The 2008 budget includes for the \nfirst time a Medium-Term Budget Framework based on aggregate macro-fiscal forecasts of both \nrevenues  and  expenditures  for  two  out-years.  Nevertheless,  budget  plans  continue  to  be \nprepared on a strictly annual basis, and medium-term public investment needs are not yet \naddressed  in  a  systematic  framework  that  reconciles  medium-term  budgetary  costs  with \naggregate resources. Integration of planning and budgeting processes\u2014a critical element in the \nmove  towards  performance-based  budgeting\u2014is  also  progressing.  Despite  this  progress, \nministries and agencies still lack a good understanding of the objectives of the work plan and \nthe budget document. Implementation of a more performance-oriented budget will take more \ntime and a clearer strategy.  \n17.  On budget execution, Indonesia still makes 50% of its total capital expenditure in the \nfinal quarter of the year.2 For the past 5 years, spending has always started slowly and then \naccelerated at the end of each year. This spending pattern means that project implementation is \ndisrupted by an adverse cycle. Moreover, underspending on capital investments constrains \nincreases in infrastructure investments. Slow and back-loaded disbursements are symptoms of \nmore  severe  challenges  that  are  encountered  at  each  stage  of  the  public  expenditure \nmanagement  cycle.  With  expanding  fiscal  space,  public  investment  is  increasing,  putting \nadditional pressure on the PFM systems. Planning and executing public investment is inherently \nmore demanding than current or mandatory expenditure. \n18.  Treasury and cash management reforms have largely focused on converting operational \nbank accounts into zero-balance transit accounts and installing a treasury single account. Pilot \nruns for testing zero-balance arrangements with commercial banks have been successful. It is \nplanned to complete consolidation of all government cash balances into the TSA by end-2007. \nThe  cash-based  accounting  system  generates  timely  records  of  revenue  and  expenditure \ntransactions,  but  it  does  not  track  monthly  arrears.  Transaction  records  are  electronically \ntransmitted  to  the  Directorate  of  Accounts  at  treasury  headquarters  for  consolidation  and \ngenerating periodic reports on budget execution. The cash-based treasury system does not \ntrack payment arrears on a monthly basis, although Directorate General Treasury\u2019s plan to \nmove  towards  an  accrual  recording  system  would  make  this  possible.  Treasury  cash \nmanagement  and  payment  modernization  will  be  supported  by  the  planned  computerized \nTreasury Information Management System under the World Bank GFMRAP project that is under \nimplementation. \n19.  The past few years have witnessed incremental improvements in the public procurement \nenvironment.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  provided  a  national  public  procurement \nregulation that corresponds with most of what is generally regarded as accepted international \npractice, including the basic principles of transparency, open and fair competition, economy, \nand efficiency. This decree also requires that a national procurement policy office (NPPO) be \nestablished as a regulatory body for public procurement. With the introduction of Presidential \n                                                 \n2  World Bank. 2007.

Jakarta/Washington, DC. \n ", "  Appendix 2 43\nDecree  No.  80/2003,  key  provisions  that  had  limited  competition,  such  as  certification \nprocedures and market segmentation, were deleted. Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 also \nestablished a basis for sanctions, complaints handling, and requirements for certification of \nusers. ADB has supported the Government through technical assistance to revise an earlier \npresidential  decree  on  procurement  and  to  prepare  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003. \nNevertheless, the public procurement system still has deficiencies in its regulatory and, more \nimportantly,  implementation  aspects.  These  are  mainly  the  delays  in  establishing  a  strong \nregulatory  body;  slow  progress  in  developing  procurement  regulation  anchored  by  law; \nweakness in implementing agencies\u2019 procurement capacities, and especially at the provincial \nand district levels; collusive and corrupt practices in the bidding process; and concerns over the \nefficiency of anticorruption measures and sanctions.  \n20.  Regarding budget reporting, the aggregate Government Annual Financial Statements \nhave been prepared in a timely manner for 3 years now (2004, 2005, and 2006). This is a major \nachievement. These comply with the new Government Accounting Standards that are described \nby the authorities as \u201ccash towards accrual basis.\u201d The aggregate annual financial statements \npresent revenues, expenditures and transfers, surplus or deficit, and financing aggregates in \ncomparison  with  budget  provisions.  A  balance  sheet  and  a  cash  flow  statement  are  also \npresented,  along  with  a  full  statement  of  government  accounting  policy.  Despite  these \nimprovements, there continue to be serious challenges in making the government financial \nstatements reliable, as reported by external auditors in their annual audit report for 2006. This \nreflects the immense challenges that lay ahead in an environment where accounting capacities \nat the grassroots are weak and the accounting processes not yet integrated or fully automated.  \n21.  The Government\u2019s internal audit framework is extensive, but scope and organization do \nnot match needs. The internal audit function is carried out at the central government through \nthree institutions: Inspectorates General (IGs) in each spending ministry; the State Financial \nControl Agency (BPKP), reporting to the President\u2019s office, with government-wide jurisdiction; \nand the Regional Supervision Agency (BAWASDA) at each local government. To clarify the \ninstitutional  structure,  mandates,  and  division  of  labor  between  the  various  internal  audit \ninstitutions, ADB is providing loan support to bring about institutional reform and a changed \nmandate for BPKP, as well as capacity building support to the BAWASDAs and IGs in spending \nministries.3   \nD.  Making Services Work for the Poor \n22.  After the economic crisis, Indonesia failed to invest sufficiently in its economy, and \nparticularly  in  public  service  delivery.  With  an  estimated  $10  billion  to  reallocate  from  the \nregressive fuel subsidies and an additional $5 billion available from increased revenues and \ndeclining debt service, the Government can start to realize its ambitious poverty reduction \nagenda linked to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. This agenda was added on to \nthe DPL/DPSP umbrella last year as part of ongoing donor analytic, diagnostic, and policy \nsupport to the Government\u2019s fuel compensation schemes. This year, under DPL-4/DPSP-3, \neducation and community-driven development were added on as new policy areas. Because of \nthe  recent  addition  of  these  policy  areas,  assessing  the  expected  improvement  in  service \ndelivery beyond outputs would be difficult at this stage. Hence, the section will be limited to \nreviewing the results of the fuel compensation programs. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the State Audit Reform Sector Development Program. Manila (Loan  2127-INO (SF),   \napproved in December, for the equivalent of $25.0 million). \n ", "44  Appendix 2 \n23.  Since the fuel price hike, there has been an evolving change in how social protection \nprograms are administered, implemented, monitored, and evaluated. Prior to 2005, Indonesia\u2019s \nsocial protection system was characterized primarily by (i) crisis-era safety net programs; and \n(ii) large commodity price subsidies and transfers, particularly through fuel products. The crisis-\nera social safety net programs were temporary, short-term interventions, rather than long-term \nsocial protection systems aimed to ensure continued access for the poor to affordable food, \nhealth, and education services. While meant to be temporary, many of these programs became \nentrenched social policy. The continued safety net programs address a diversity of issues, but \nare low in coverage, institutionally fragmented, and not managed as one umbrella system. In \n2003, budgets allocated to the three principal targeted programs, namely subsidized rice for the \npoor, education scholarships, and health cards, totaled about Rp8.4 trillion, accounting for only \n2.2% of total government expenditure. By comparison, in 2005 about Rp103 trillion was spent \non fuel subsidies. It is estimated that about Rp5 trillion of this benefited the poorest quintile.   \n24.  The fuel compensation programs enacted shortly after the second wave of fuel price \nincreases  in  October  2005  represented  a  break  from  traditional  safety  net  programs.  The \nGovernment opted for a cash transfer scheme wherein 19.2 million households would receive \nRp300,000 each quarter. This represented the largest ever cash transfer program in terms of \ncoverage and total volume transferred. The unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program was \ndesigned as a temporary, 1-year cash transfer program aimed at mitigating the impacts of the \nfuel subsidy. For poor recipients, the cash transfer more than compensated for the losses \nincurred due to the fuel price hike. Initial assessments during the first tranche noted several \nproblems, particularly in targeting. That prompted the Government to make adjustments in the \nUCT\u2019s implementation.   \n25.  Lessons  learned  from  assessments  of  the  UCT  program\u2014which  was  supported  by \nDPL/DPSP\u2014have led to the piloting of conditional cash transfers (CCT). Conditional cash \ntransfers can be used to stimulate demand for services by the poor and give them more of a \nvoice in frontline service provision. Programs that transfer resources directly to poor families \nhave proved effective in several other countries at raising enrolment, attendance, and utilization \nof health facilities. Community-based approaches that aim at increasing utilization are also \nrelevant in the Indonesian context. The President has announced that the Government will pilot \nboth  the  \u201cconventional\u201d  conditional  cash  transfer  to  households  and  a  community-based \nalternative starting in mid- 2007. Detailed design of the two approaches is currently underway, \nled by the National Development Planning Agency and involving the Ministries of Social Affairs, \nEducation, Health, Public Works, and Home Affairs. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  45   \nBACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE TRIGGERS FOR THE THIRD DEVELOPMENT \nPOLICY SUPPORT PROGRAM (DPSP-3) \n \n1.  Trigger 1: Improve VAT by, among others, reducing the time for VAT refunds through \nimplementation of the DG Tax Regulation No. 122/2006. \n \nExports are zero-rated for value added tax (VAT). Nevertheless, exporters pay VAT on domestic \npurchases but do not collect any VAT from buyers of their product. Consequently, they are \nregularly owed VAT refunds by the tax department. Refunds have in the past taken a very long \ntime to process, with the average exporter reporting a 6-month delay between submitting the \nclaim and receiving the refund. This ties up a considerable amount of working capital and \nmakes  Indonesian  exports  less  competitive  than exports  from  other  countries,  where  VAT \nrefunds  typically  take  less  than  1  month.  To  remedy  this,  Directorate  General  (DG)  tax \nregulation no. 122/2006, issued in August 2006, prescribes reduced time limits for completing \nthe approval of refund claims based on the status of the claimant. Low-risk exporters should see \ntheir claims approved in 3 months, medium- and high-risk exporters in 5 months, and other \nclaimants within 13 months. The 2007 package on Policies to Accelerate Development and \nEmpower Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (Presidential Instruction 6/2007) further states \nthat by July 2007 the maximum time to process VAT refunds for compliant (\"Golden\") taxpayers \nwill be cut from 1 month to 7 days, for low-risk exporters from 12 months to 2 months, and for \nmedium-risk exporters from 12 months to 4 months.   \n \n2.   Trigger 2: Issue Ministry of Finance (MOF) Decree on tax audit procedures that allows \ntaxpayers to request details of audit findings and a review in case of disputes after closing \nconference but before completion of audit. \n \nThe Indonesian tax system relies on self-assessment, under which taxpayers are trusted to \ncalculate,  pay,  and  report  their  own  taxes  in  accordance  with  prevailing  tax  laws  and \nregulations. However, the DG tax may issue tax assessment letters to a particular taxpayer if it \nfinds that, based on a tax audit or other information, the taxpayer has not fully paid its tax \nliabilities. Further, DG tax may conduct tax audits in the taxpayer\u2019s premises for some reasons \nincluding but not limited to: a tax refund request, an annual income of tax return presenting a tax \nloss,  a  tax  return  not  filled  within  the  prescribed  time, and  other  reasons  meeting  certain \n(undisclosed) criteria of the DG Tax. At the end of a tax audit, the tax auditors will provide the \ntaxpayer with a written notification of the tax audit findings. The taxpayer will typically have to \nrespond to the notification in writing within 7 to 21 days. After that, a final discussion about the \ntax audit findings (Closing Conference) is to be held between the tax auditor and the taxpayer. \nPreviously, if the taxpayer disagreed with the result of a closing conference, he or she could file \nan appeal with the tax court within 3 months but would have to pay 100% of the disputed \namount  in  advance.  This  created  an  imbalance  between  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the \ntaxpayers and the powers of tax officials.  \n \n 3.  Trigger 3: Roll out a National Single Window with online clearance of merchandise. \n \nThe National Single Window (NSW) for imports and exports is currently the most important \ntrade facilitation initiative underway in Indonesia. Under a single window, traders (importers and \nexporters) will no longer be required to apply individually to multiple government agencies\u2014\nsuch as Customs, the Port Authority, the Ministry of Trade, the Food and Drug Agency, and \nQuarantine\u2014to  clear  cargoes.  A  single  application  is  instead  submitted  using  a  single \nadministrative document, and this application is transmitted to each relevant agency by the \noperator of the Single Window. Approval is transmitted back to the operator so that the trader \n ", "46   Appendix 3 \ncommunicates directly with one authority rather than multiple authorities. Indonesia has signed \ntwo international agreements committing to establishing a NSW as a preliminary step toward \nintegrating into an ASEAN-6 Single Window by September 2008. A national team to establish \nthe single window, chaired by the Minister of Finance and led at the working level by a deputy \nunder the Coordinating Minister for the Economy, was created in March 2006. \n \n4.  Trigger  4:  Enhance  procedure  for  tariff  setting  through  implementing  better \nmethodology, improved research capability, and better information technology. \n \nA 2004 World Bank report, Making Indonesia Competitive: Promoting Exports and Managing \nTrade, found that, although import tariffs are generally low in Indonesia, import licenses and \nnontariff barriers are becoming popular instruments to restrict trade.1 Several high tariffs and a \nnumber of nontariff barriers on inputs, and particularly in agriculture, are taxing the further \ndevelopment of agriculture processing industries. The interministerial Team Tariff  is responsible \nfor  evaluating  Indonesia\u2019s  tariff  regime.  With  recommendations  from  the  Team,  MOF  is \nexercising its authority to change tariff rates. The Team, however, faces weak capacity. There is \na  consensus  that  the  Team\u2019s  secretariat  functions  should  be  revamped.  A  more  effective \ntechnical team should also enhance Team Tariff\u2019s performance in setting tariff policies.   \n \n5.  Trigger 5: Implement the Investment Law, its supporting regulations, and new operating \nprocedures. \n \nA new Investment Law was passed by Parliament in March 2007 after some delay. The law \nprovides equal treatment to domestic and foreign investors, allows for longer work permits for \nexpatriates, and extends the number of years for which land can be leased. It states explicitly \nthat investors are entitled to repatriate and transfer funds in foreign exchange, and that disputes \nbetween  government  and  investors  can  be  settled  through  international  arbitration.  One \nimplementing regulation for the law was issued prior to passage of the law: PP1/2007 on fiscal \nincentives for investment. Four more implementing regulations are to be issued in 2007. Of \nthese, two on the criteria for negative lists and the negative list itself were issued in July 2007. \nTwo more regulations on one-stop shops and investment procedures are pending.   \n \n6.  Trigger  6:  Simplify  or  eliminate  unnecessary  and/or  redundant  business  licenses, \nprocedures, and multiple registration requirements. \n \nThe procedures to set up a business in Indonesia are among the most complex, costly, and time \nconsuming in Asia. Some progress has been made, as the time to establish and register a \nlimited liability company has fallen from 168 days in 2003 to 105 in 2007. This is still well above \nregional  standards  (Malaysia  and  Thailand  require  only  30  days),  however,  and  after \nestablishing a company, investors still must obtain numerous sectoral and local licenses. The \nwhole  process  of  establishing  a new  company  and  obtaining  all  the  required  permits  and \nlicenses can take six months or more, depending on the sector and activity. A presidential \ndecree in 2006 stated that the time to establish a company would be cut to 30 days. The 2007 \npackage  on  Policies  to  Accelerate  Development  and  Empower  Micro,  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprises (Presidential Instruction 6/2007) stipulates that the time to establish a company will \nbe cut to 25 days by simplifying procedures, switching from sequential to parallel processing, \nand setting maximum time limits for each step.  \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2004. Making Indonesia Competitive: Promoting Exports and Managing Trade, Jakarta/Washington, \nDC. \n ", "  Appendix 3  47   \n7.  Trigger 7: Issue a comprehensive SME policy package (including supporting industries) \nthat, among others, increases access to finance and implements the Warehouse Receipts Law. \n \nThe  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  (SME)  policy  package  was  issued  as  part  of \nPresidential Instruction 6/2007. One of the package\u2019s main focus areas is improving access of \nmicro enterprises and SMEs to finance, since they face significant constraints in accessing \nformal  sources  of  finance  to  meet  their  working  capital  and  investment  needs.  Given  the \ncollateralized nature of lending, SMEs often have difficulties obtaining competitive loans from \nbanks. In particular, movable property may not be used as collateral, as Bank Indonesia\u2019s loan \nloss reserve rules prevent the use of such assets. As a result, expanding business has been \nvery hard for many Indonesian SMEs. Presidential Instruction 6/2007 identifies a number of \nways for micro enterprises and SMEs to improve access to finance, and one of the key areas is \nto implement the Warehouse Receipts Law that was enacted by Parliament in June 2006. The \nLaw  intends  to  establish  a  system  of  designated  warehouses  which  could  provide  official \nreceipts for commodities stored by farmers, growers, and traders. This is to provide SMEs in \nagribusiness and related sectors flexibility in selling their products based on market conditions. \nThe designated warehouses will provide them with certificates against goods held. The receipts \ncan be traded as derivatives, or used to settle maturing futures contracts on a commodities \nexchange, or as collateral to obtain bank loans. The World Bank Group is currently supporting \nthe Government in developing implementation regulations for the Law. \n \n8.  Trigger  8: Implement good corporate governance and risk management standards, \nparticularly in state-owned banks, and continue implementation of financial sector safety net.  \n \nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis in 1997, the Government introduced a blanket guarantee \non all bank liabilities to restore public confidence in the banking system and control bank runs. \nSubsequently,  as  crisis  resolution  progressed  and  the  banking  sector  strengthened,  the \nGovernment  committed  itself  to  lifting  the  blanket  guarantee  in  a  phased  manner  and \nintroducing a deposit insurance scheme that would cover deposits of up to Rp100 million. The \nParliament approved the Law on Deposit Insurance in August 2004, setting out a phased plan to \nreduce the coverage of the blanket guarantee to commence from September 2005 as per the \nschedule presented below. The main objectives of the deposit insurance scheme are to reduce \nthe  economic  distortions  and  moral  hazard  created  by  the  blanket  guarantee  as  well  as \npotentially to try and limit the fiscal costs to the Government in the event of future difficulties in \nthe banking sector. It is also an integral part of the overall financial sector safety net being put in \nplace by the Government. Some other elements of that net include BI\u2019s role as a lender of last \nresort and establishment of institutional processes and mechanisms by which banks facing \ndifficulties would be either aided by BI or their situations would be otherwise resolved. \n \nTable A3.1: Implementation Schedule for the Deposit Insurance Scheme \nImplementation Phases  Current Status/Milestone \n22 September 2005\u201321 March 2006  Entire amount of deposit was protected. \n22 March 2006\u201321 September 2006  Maximum Rp5 billion was protected. \n22 September 2006\u201321 March 2007  Maximum Rp1 billion was protected. \nStarting from 22 March 2007  Maximum Rp100 million will be protected. \nSource: Government of Indonesia. Law on Deposit Insurance. \n \n \n \n ", "48   Appendix 3 \n9.  Trigger 9: Implement a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) with a system of \nclear forward estimates for the 2008 budget.  \n \nFor the 2008 budget preparation process, MOF implemented defined changes in the budget \nrequest templates and accompanying budget preparation manuals to strengthen the type and \nstructure  of  performance  information.  Progress  has  also  been  made  in  moving  towards  a \npolicy-based budget by further integrating the planning and budgeting processes into the 2008 \nbudget preparation cycle. The 2008 budget that was submitted to Parliament in August 2007 \nindicates a substantial reallocation of expenditures towards priority sectors, and particularly \ninfrastructure,  that  more  closely  reflect  government  policy  priorities  as  outlined  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  work  plan.  Priority  programs  and  activities  will  also  be  specifically  marked, \nallowing the Government to monitor alignment of budget allocations to government priorities. \n \nAt  the  same  time,  MOF  has  made  progress  in  enhancing  its  macroeconomic  forecasting \ncapacity, which is a key prerequisite for implementing the MTEF. The recent reorganization of \nthe MOF, namely establishment of the Fiscal Policy Office, has strengthened its capacity to take \nthe lead role in finalizing the medium-term macro-fiscal projections. Although medium-term \nmacroeconomic and fiscal forecasts are prepared by the Fiscal Policy Office, they are not yet \nused directly in the budget process and presented in the budget documents that are submitted \nto  the  House  of  Representatives.  For  2008,  MOF  is  intending  to  pilot  implementation  of \nprogrammatic MTEFs in a selected number of line ministries. Finally, to further deepen reforms \nand to increase readiness for further reforms in the 2009 budget preparation process, MOF is \nintending to formulate and publish a coherent, phased strategy for budget reform covering the \nshort, medium, and long terms. \n \n10.  Trigger 10: Continue to consolidate core government (revenue and expenditure) bank \naccounts. \n \nEffective management of state finances requires minimizing central government idle cash and \ncash float, reducing the maintenance costs of too many accounts, facilitating cash forecasting \nand cash management control, as well as enhancing the transparency of central government \nbanking. Support for establishing the treasury single account (TSA) commenced under DPSP-1 \n(DPL-2), with pilots for zero-balance transitory accounts in Batam, Bekasi, and Jakarta. This has \nsince been extended to 50 state treasury offices (KPPNs).  \n \nNevertheless, substantial state funds continue to be held in commercial bank accounts by both \nspending units and state officials. According to the State Audit Agency\u2019s 2005 audit report, this \nincludes about Rp8.5 trillion in some 1,300 current and savings accounts not recorded in the \ntreasury system. These off-the-books funds not only distort the consolidated government cash \nbalance but also are highly vulnerable to embezzlement and corrupt activities. Recent adoption \nof government regulation on cash management will enhance the powers of MOF to close \nunauthorized bank accounts and provide legal backing for a census of all government accounts. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  49   \n11.  Trigger  11:  Implement  transparent  accountability  arrangements  for  RDI  and  RDA \naccounts. \n \nThe central government investment funding (RDI) and regional development accounts (RDA) \nare  off-budget  accounts  maintained  by  MOF  to  finance  loan  operations  to  state-owned \nenterprises and  subnational  entities,  respectively.  As  of  December  2005,  the  total  amount \noutstanding as shown by the audited financial statements of the Government was Rp60.4 trillion \n($6.5bn), of which nearly Rp29 trillion was the rupiah equivalent of loans made in foreign \ncurrency. It is understood that as at end-2006 the total had fallen slightly to Rp59.2 trillion \nspread  across  1,650  loan  accounts.  Under  current  practice,  RDI  and  RDA  accounts  are \noperated as a revolving off-budget fund. Cash received by MOF by way of repayments of \nprincipal, interest, and charges levied is not being deposited into the central treasury account \nbut  is  retained  in  separate  bank  accounts,  which  may  weaken  financial  accountability.  In \naddition,  administrative  and  accounting  records  for  RDI  and  RDA  transactions  have  been \nmaintained in a manual recording system, which did not enable appropriate accounting and \nfiduciary controls to be exercised, given the size, volume, and nature of the transactions \n \n12.  Trigger 12: Fully operationalize the National Public Procurement Office (NPPO) and \nissue a draft procurement law. \n \nThe Presidential Decree 80/2003 sought to establish an NPPO that was fully staffed and led by \na first echelon official with sufficient authority across all levels of government in a decentralized \nframework. Given political difficulties, an acceptable interim solution was to establish the NPPO \nas a separate entity reporting to BAPPENAS with subsequent empowerment as an independent \nentity under the proposed new procurement law. This was agreed upon last year. However, this \ndecision was reversed, and a government committee has now drafted a presidential decree to \nestablish an independent entity. The current draft decree envisages an independent NPPO with \na  first  echelon  staff  reporting  to  the  President  and  with  deputies  heading  three  main \ndepartments for Strategy and Policy Development, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Information \nSystems. Once this decree is issued by the  President, there will still be requirements for \nstaffing, budgeting, and other support to make the NPPO fully functional. The decree represents \na  major  step  towards  having  a  fully  staffed  regulatory  body  that  can  improve  the  public \nprocurement system and monitor its performance. This in itself is a huge task, taking into \nconsideration the degree of centralization in the country. \n \nAlthough a procurement law has been drafted, there is ongoing discussion on the content of a \nprocurement law. The existing Presidential Decree 80/2003 promotes the basic principles of \nprocurement: transparency, open and fair competition, economy, and efficiency. It covers all \nareas of procurement that use public funds and contracting entities at all levels of government. \nThe decree corresponds with most of what is generally regarded as accepted international \npractice. However, the pace of Indonesia\u2019s decentralization reforms has had an impact on public \nsector procurement, as different levels of government\u2014from ministers, to governors, and even \nmayors\u2014are able to issue their own decrees, regulations, and instructions. The plethora of \nregulations is often inconsistent and many of these do not correspond to accepted international \npractice. This is why there is a need for an overall regulatory framework in the form of a \nprocurement law, which will be followed eventually with implementation decrees that would be \nused at both national and provincial levels. \n \n ", "50   Appendix 3 \n13.  Trigger 13 and 14: Initiate civil service reform. \n \nRecently, the Government has begun to undertake a series of initiatives that constitute one of \nthe most promising openings for civil service reform in years. A key first step has been the effort \nto  design  a  new  job  classification  and  remuneration  policy  for  high-ranking  state  officials, \nincluding ministers, legislators, judges, and heads of special commissions and agencies. MOF \nhas taken leadership and set up a task force to examine the entire compensation package with \nthe  goal  of  creating  a  more  transparent,  systematic,  and  coherent  framework  of  pay  and \nallowances based on a comprehensive job evaluation and pay grading. The task force has \nproposed the establishment of a body to recommend to the President both the level and \nstructure of the compensation package first for Indonesia\u2019s highest ranking political officials and, \nonce  that  is  established,  for  the  entire  civil  service.  The  body  will  also  be  tasked  with \nestablishing greater consistency and transparency of the overall remuneration package in order \nto improve governance. The body\u2019s recommendations will be based on such modern techniques \nas job evaluations and pay comparator surveys. In addition, promising civil service reform pilots \nare  being  developed  in  MOF,  which  are  being  rolled  out  more  widely  to  institutions  with \nreform-minded leadership.   \n \n14.  Trigger 15: Develop an enhanced assessment framework for selected service delivery \nprograms. \n \nThe ability to translate public spending into improved services depends, in part, on having better \ninformation on what works. It was for this reason that the Government approached donors to \nsupport them in assessing the four major fuel subsidy compensation programs (the 1-year \nunconditional cash transfer program, health insurance for the poor, operational assistance to \nschools, and village infrastructure) in 2006 (an action supported by DPSP-2/DPL-3). Going \nforward, the Government would like to take greater ownership and institutionalize the use of \nprogram assessments. To do so will require establishing a multiyear plan with appropriate \nbudget and capacity building measures, as well as clearly defined steps to ensure findings are \nused  to  inform  decisions  on  whether  to  expand,  modify,  or  eliminate  programs.  The \nimplementation of such a plan would likely lead to better understanding of the weaknesses of \nvarious program monitoring information systems\u2014hopefully leading to improvements.   \n \n15.  Trigger  16:  Establish  competency  standards  for  teacher  certification  and  the \ninstruments for measuring compliance with those standards. \n \nIndonesia has identified education as one of the most critical sectors with regard to improving \nthe quality of life of its citizens and the attainment of its Millennium Development Goals. In \nDecember 2005, with the passage of the Teacher Law, the Government launched a highly \nambitious effort to upgrade the quality of its teachers. Under the new Law, all teachers will have \ntheir  basic  salaries  doubled  upon  being  certified  as  meeting  the  competency  standards \nmandated by the Law. Those in remote areas will be provided additional incentives, resulting in \na  near  tripling  of  their  basic  salaries.  The  Law  presents  an  unprecedented  opportunity  to \nenhance the quality of professional development and training provided to teachers and to create \na culture of teaching centered on instructional excellence. While survey data indicate that the \nquality of teaching in Indonesia compares poorly with those of such neighboring countries as \nSingapore and Malaysia, the low level of Indonesian teachers\u2019 qualification is itself of concern: \nsome 60% of Indonesia\u2019s teachers do not have the minimum qualifications required by the new \nLaw.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  51   \n16.  Trigger 17: Permit community spending over multiyear periods and clarify procurement \nprocedures for national budget funded community-designed development (CDD) programs. \n \nImplementation  of  the  National  Community  Empowerment  Program  in  70,000  villages  will \ndepend on public financial management and procurement procedures that are suitable at the \nsubdistrict level. The impact of CDD programs in supporting community groups is reduced, \nhowever,  by  the  current  annual  budget  system  used  by  the  Government.  State  budget \nregulations stipulate that public funds must be spent within the current fiscal (calendar) year \neven though public funding may be released as late as the second half of the year, and \ncommunities\u2019 frequent lack of experience creates further delays. The inability of communities to \ncarry  over  unspent  funds  beyond  the  current  fiscal  year  could  potentially  lead  to  major \ndisruptions in spending plans. While the current restrictions on carryover do not affect donor \nloan and grant funds, it applies to the Government\u2019s rupiah funds. While in the past CDD \nprograms were funded mainly by donor funds, this situation has been rapidly changing, and in \n2009 it is expected that the majority of funds will be coming from the Government\u2019s rupiah \nfunds. The Government has been deliberating a number of available options for resolving this \nissue. The other component of the trigger relates to how funds are to be spent by communities. \nAll  public  agencies  are  required  to  undertake  expenditure  in  compliance  with  the  2003 \nProcurement Law. As private entities, community groups are exempt from this requirement. \nNevertheless, there is a misunderstanding within central and regional governments that public \nprocurement regulations apply to community groups, thus adding to the problems communities \nface in completing CDD projects. This has necessitated that the Government raise awareness \namong public agencies and communities regarding procurement regulations.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "52   Appendix 4 \n \nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER AND POLICY MATRIX FOR THE THIRD  \nDEVELOPMENT POLICY SUPPORT PROGRAM \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  53   \n ", "54   Appendix 4 \n ", "  Appendix 4  55   \n ", "56   Appendix 4 \n ", "  Appendix 4  57   \n ", "58   Appendix 4 \n ", "  Appendix 4  59   \n ", "60   Appendix 4 \n ", "  Appendix 4  61   \n ", "62   Appendix 4 \n ", "  Appendix 4  63   \n ", "64   Appendix 4 \n \n \n \n ", "       \nTable A4: Policy Matrix for the Third Development Policy Support Program \n \nDPSP-3 Policy Measures  Status as of 9 November 2007 \nA.

Background and Analytical Underpinnings \n \n1.  Funds from the Development Policy Loan (DPL) operation will provide general budget \nsupport to the Government of Indonesia. Management of the Government\u2019s budget is influenced \nto a large extent by ongoing public financial management (PFM) reforms. This note summarizes \nthe direction and progress of these reforms in order to determine the attendant fiduciary risks \nwith respect to these funds. \n \n2.  This assessment of fiduciary aspects of this loan draws upon several studies on PFM \nand accountability that have been completed over the past 12 months, both internally within the \nWorld  Bank,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  other  development  partners.  Studies \nundertaken internally by the World Bank include a Public Expenditure Review completed this \nyear. It also includes a Sector Report on Accountability & Audit in Indonesia (ADB: January \n2007), implementation reports on the ongoing State Audit Reform Program being implemented \nwith  ADB  support,  a  Statement  of  Fiscal  Risks  (IMF:  2006),  a  Report  on  Budget  Reform \nPriorities (joint World Bank and IMF: April 2007), and a Report on Observance of Standards and \nCodes on Fiscal Transparency (IMF: October 2006). This assessment has also taken into \naccount a review of the progress made in implementing actions agreed under the third DPL \napproved in 2006 and results of recent supervision missions to assess progress in implementing \nthe  World  Bank  financed  Government  Financial  Management  and  Revenue  Administration \nProject  (GFMRAP)  that  became  effective  in  October  2005.  These  reports  and  documents \nprovide  the  analytical  underpinnings  for  this  assessment.  An  exercise  to  measure  PFM \nprocesses based on public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) methodology is \ncurrently under way and is likely to be completed by November 2007. \n \n3.   Deficiencies in Indonesia\u2019s PFM systems have been well documented in recent years, \nand a reform strategy to address these was formulated by the Government in its White Paper on \nPFM reforms in 2001. This strategy covered a broad spectrum of public financial management, \nfrom budget formulation to budget execution, accounting and reporting, and external oversight. \nThese  reforms  directly  influence  the  environment  in  which  public  expenditure  is  planned, \nbudgeted,  executed,  and  accounted  for  across  all  levels  of  government.  A  more  detailed \ncommentary on progress in implementing these reforms is given below to help identify the \nattendant risks arising from the Borrower\u2019s capacity to manage this loan and determine the \nfiduciary arrangements for this operation.  \n \nB.  Budget Allocations  \n \n4.  A  recent  analysis  by  the  World  Bank1 has  concluded  that  prudent  macroeconomic \npolicies, particularly the extremely low budget deficits, have been instrumental in Indonesia\u2019s \nrecovery  from  the  last  crisis.  Over  the  past  10  years,  there  has  also  been  a  remarkable \ntransformation in the way public resources are managed and allocated. As a result, Indonesia \ncan expect to have significant additional fiscal resources, or \u201cfiscal space,\u201d that is almost of the \nmagnitude of the revenue windfall seen during the oil boom of the mid-1970s.  \n \n5.  The composition of public investment has changed substantially since decentralization. \nWhen Indonesia decentralized, subnational governments increased their shares of resources. \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2007.

Jakarta/Washington, DC. \n ", "76  Appendix 8 \nSubnational governments now manage about half of total public investment. At the same time, \nthe sectoral composition of expenditures changed as well. The overall shares of education and \nadministrative  expenditures  have  increased  substantially,  while  infrastructure  has  declined, \nparticularly since 2003. However, some key indicators of Government budget performance have \nnot  improved  so  far,  particularly  budget  outturn  indicators.  Actual  central  government \nexpenditure has consistently deviated from initial plans. Subsidies tend to be underestimated, \nwhile capital spending has been consistently lower than the budgeted amount. At the same \ntime,  other  parts  of  the  budget\u2015most  notably  public  investments  and  central  government \npersonnel spending\u2015show underspending.  \n \nC.  Public Financial Management Reform Strategy \n \n6.  Some key elements of the reform strategy articulated in the past included the following: \n(i)  Modernizing an outdated legal environment for PFM, by issuing a modern set of \nlaws and implementing regulations. \n(ii)  Reforming an opaque and inefficient budget formulation process by discontinuing \nthe separate recurrent and development budgets and introducing performance \nbudgeting systems and forward estimates. \n(iii)  Reforming budget implementation, in particular the inefficient payments system \nand weak monitoring and accountability arrangements. \n(iv)  Modernizing  management  of  the  Government  Treasury  to  consolidate \nfragmented  cash  management  and  make  government  banking  arrangements \nmore efficient. \n(v)  Introducing modern government accounting standards and accounting practices \nto improve the reliability of government financial reporting.  \n(vi)  Reforming arrangements for government auditing, in particular strengthening the \nmandate and capacity of the State Audit Agency (BPK), addressing overlaps \nbetween external and internal audit agencies, and clarifying their respective roles \nand responsibilities. \n(vii)  Modernizing  the  institutional  and  regulatory  framework  for  public  sector \nprocurement. \n \nD.  Summary of Implementation Experience on PFM Reforms \n \n7.  The current Government has embarked on a new phase of reforms in the budget and \nPFM  system  with  support  from  various  development  partners.2 These  followed  important \npolitical reforms that were introduced after 1998, including \u201cbig bang\u201d decentralization and the \ndirect election of the President. Key areas of progress so far include the following:  \n(i)  Adopting a new legal framework for planning, budgeting, treasury management, \nand external audit. New laws were adopted by Parliament in 2003\u20132004 and \nmany government implementing regulations were issued thereafter. \n(ii)  Restructuring the Ministry of Finance (MOF). A first restructuring occurred in \n2004, when the Directorate General (DG) of Treasury was established, separate \nfrom DG Budget. A second restructuring occurred in 2006, when a new Fiscal \nPolicy  Office  was  established  with  a  focus  on  macro-fiscal  policies  and \nprojections, and a new DG Debt was created by splitting off two directorates from \nDG Treasury, with external and domestic debt management consolidated in one \nDG.  \n                                                 \n2  The main technical assistance providers are the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the International \nMonetary Fund, the Government of the Netherlands, the European Community, and the Government of Australia.  \n ", "Appendix 8  77 \n(iii)  Unifying the previous routine and development budgets. As from the 2005 annual \nbudget,  a  new  economic  and  functional  classification  was  introduced  for \nbudgetary  expenditures,  based  on  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nGovernment Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001) system.3 \n(iv)  Beginning a process of rationalizing government bank accounts and improving \ncash management.4 A principal objective is to establish a treasury single account \n(TSA) and to close government accounts outside the DG Treasury\u2019s control. \n(v)  Government  Regulation  No.  24/2005  prescribes  modified  cash  government \naccounting standards as a transition towards full accrual standards at a later \ndate.  Templates  for  accounting  statements  to  be  used  by  central  and  local \ngovernments have also been issued. \n(vi)  Finalizing  plans  to  introduce  a  new  treasury  system.  The  World  Bank\u2019s \nGovernment  Financial  Management  and  Revenue  Administration  Project \n(GFMRAP)  focuses  particularly  on  computerization  of  treasury  operations \nthrough the treasury system. The GFMRAP also includes components to support \nchange  in  the  budget  system\u2014within  the  MOF  and  National  Development \nPlanning  Agency\u2014as  well  as  for  improving  parliamentary  involvement  and \noversight of the budget approval processes. \n(vii)  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  introduces  many  improvements  to  the \nprocurement  regime  and  lays  out  a  plan  for  establishing  a  national  policy \nformulation and oversight agency. An omnibus procurement law is envisaged for \nconsolidating, clarifying, and simplifying the numerous procurement rules and \nregulations.  This  law,  currently  under  preparation,  will  strengthen  the  legal \nfoundation for modernizing public procurement. \n(viii)  Strengthening the mandate of and funding for an external audit institution. The \nState Audit Law, legislated in 2004, lays out the broad legal framework for the \noperation of the country\u2019s supreme audit institution, the BPK, to reinforce its \nposition and mandate as an external audit institution reporting to Parliament. A \nseparate law (the State Audit Agency Law) has recently been passed to cover \nthe institutional arrangements for the management and oversight of the BPK. The \nBPK has seen a significant increase in its budgetary financial resources. \n(ix)  Enhancing  parliamentary  oversight  of  budget  processes.  Parliamentary \ncommissions have become particularly active in scrutinizing and amending the \nGovernment\u2019s draft annual budget. However, this has become more intensive \nand detailed than is the case in many countries. A more strategic and less \ninstructive approach is needed. \n(x)  The Government published the IMF fiscal transparency report5 and undertook its \nsocialization throughout Indonesia. The public availability of fiscal information is \nalready improving and the Government has published a fiscal risk statement \ntogether with the 2008 budget. \n \n                                                 \n3  IMF. 2005.

Washington, DC. \n ", "78  Appendix 8 \nE.  Experience in Implementing Budget Reforms \n \n8.  The fiscal roles of the executive and legislative branches are now defined in law and \nevolving in practice. Fiscal relationships between the executive and legislature are defined in \nState Finance Law No.17/2003. The House of Representatives (DPR) is the principal legislative \nbody, and it plays a significant role in shaping the budget and fiscal policy. The budget is \npassed in agreement between the President and DPR. The process involves an examination by \nthe  DPR  of  the  macroeconomic  framework,  macro-fiscal  policies,  and  the  detailed  budget \nallocations. The relative roles of the executive and legislative branches in this area are evolving. \n \n9.   The  laws  governing  budget  management  clearly  specify  the  responsibilities  of  the \nminister of finance and comprehensive regulations have been developed. While the President, \nas head of the Government, has overall authority to exercise national fiscal management, Law \nNo.  17/2003  clearly  delegates  the  responsibility  of  overall  fiscal  management  of  central \ngovernment finances to the minister of finance as chief financial officer. The law also assigns \nresponsibilities  to  individual  ministers,  governors,  and  other  local  authorities  for  financial \nmanagement and accountability in their jurisdictions. \n \n10.  Provisions of the new regulations are being implemented. The budget classification is \nlargely consistent with contemporary international standards. The MOF is developing plans for a \nmedium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) to guide budget policy. Forward estimates at the \naggregate level have been introduced for 2009 and 2010 with the budget for 2008. However, \nmuch more work needs to be done to fully operationalize the MTEF approach.  \n \nF.  Reforming Budget Execution \n \n11.  Indonesia still spends 50% of its total capital expenditure in the final quarter of the year.6 \nFor the past 5 years, spending has always started slowly and then accelerated towards the end \nof each year. This spending pattern is of concern because project implementation is disrupted \nby an adverse cycle. Moreover, underspending in capital investments constrains increases in \ninfrastructure investments. Slow and back-loaded disbursements are symptoms of more severe \nchallenges that are encountered at each stage of the public expenditure management cycle. \n \n12.  The Government maintains a comparatively rigid budget execution process. Detailed \ninput controls aim to ensure that the composition of the budget complies with political priorities \nand that the budget is not altered during execution. Spending warrants (DIPA), while now issued \nat the start of the fiscal year, contain excessive detail, leaving little flexibility for adjustments in \nthe composition of inputs needed to carry out a given activity. Reallocations across DIPAs from \ndelayed programs to better performing ones that could enhance satisfactory implementation of \nthe overall expenditure program require lengthy revision, sometimes involving Parliament. Such \ninflexibility creates practical difficulties and inefficiencies. \n \n13.  With expanding fiscal space, public investment is increasing, putting additional pressure \non PFM systems. Planning and executing public investment is inherently more demanding than \ncurrent or mandatory expenditure.  \n \n14.  Basic internal control procedures are in place to ensure that expenditures across all \nspending  agencies  strictly  follow  approved  budgets.  Spending  units\u2019  DIPAs  are  the  key \n                                                 \n6  World Bank. 2007.

These are now issued on a timelier basis than in previous years. MOF regulations have \nbeen issued to cover various aspects of budget execution. The Treasury records expenditure \ntransactions at the payment stage. The expenditure control system does not provide for central \nrecording of commitments. Operational control over expenditure stages, such as commitment \nand verification of delivery of goods and services, is undertaken by budget users.  \n \nG.  Treasury and Cash Management \n \n15.  Transparency is clouded by a multitude of bank accounts. The Treasury itself maintains \nmultiple bank accounts, both in rupiah and in foreign currency, at Bank Indonesia (BI). There \nare also an unknown number of extra-budgetary bank accounts maintained by budget users. \nExternal audit reports have placed at over 1,300 the number of bank accounts that have not \nbeen reported to the central Treasury. \n \n16.  Regulations associated with Law 1/2004 will address this weakness and provide for (i) \nestablishment  of  a  treasury  single  account  (TSA)  at  Bank  Indonesia;  (ii)  conversion  of \noperational bank accounts at commercial banks into zero-balance transit accounts; and (iii) a \nmandatory review at MOF of bank accounts of all state agencies outside treasury oversight, with \na view to close those that do not serve the public interest. Pilot runs for testing zero-balance \narrangements with commercial banks have been successful. It is planned to complete the \nconsolidation of all government cash balances into the TSA by end-2007. \n \n17.  The implementing regulation for Law 1/2004, Government Regulation 36/2007 on Cash \nManagement,  was  issued  in  July  2007  and  details  the  governance  and  setup  of  cash \nmanagement. In addition, a number of MOF regulations (PMK) have been issued to further the \nestablishment of the TSA: \n(i)  PMK 57 is the generic PMK to regulate opening of bank accounts by the line \nministries.  \n(ii)  PMK 58 mandates a census of the existing line ministry accounts.  \n(iii)  PMK 59 mandates echelon I officers of MOF to disclose the bank accounts if any \nare being operated.  \n \n18.  The  cash-based  accounting  system  generates  timely  records  of  revenue  and \nexpenditure  transactions,  but  does  not  track  monthly  arrears.  Transaction  records  are \nelectronically  transmitted  to  the  directorate  of  accounts  at  treasury  headquarters  for \nconsolidation and generation of periodic reports on budget execution. The cash-based treasury \nsystem does not track payment arrears on a monthly basis, although DG Treasury\u2019s plans to \nmove towards an accrual recording system would make that possible. \n \n19.  Treasury  cash  management  and  payment  modernization  will  be  supported  by  the \nplanned  computerized  treasury  information  management  system  under  the  World  Bank \nGFMRAP project. Implementation of the treasury component of GFMRAP has been delayed. \nDG Treasury has not mobilized for project implementation, and the procurement process has \nbeen ongoing for more than 18 months.  \n \nH.  Procurement Reforms \n \n20.  The  past  few  years  have  witnessed  improvements  in  the  public  procurement \nenvironment.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  provided  a  national  public  procurement \nregulation  corresponding  to  most  of  what  is  generally  regarded  as  accepted  international \n ", "80  Appendix 8 \npractice, including the basic principles: transparency, open and fair competition, economy, and \nefficiency.  This  decree  also  requires  that  a  national  public  procurement  office  (NPPO)  be \nestablished as a regulatory body for public procurement. With Presidential Decree No. 80/2003, \na previous certification (\u201cpre-qualification\u201d) process for suppliers of goods and services was, in \nmost instances, abandoned by the Government. This has previously led to segmentation of the \nmarket and especially at the provincial levels. Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 also established \nthe basis for sanctions, complaint-handling and requirements for certification of users.  \n \n21.  Nevertheless,  the  public  procurement  system  still  has  significant  deficiencies  in  its \nregulatory and, more importantly, implementation aspects. These are due mainly to delays in \nestablishing  a  strong  regulatory  body;  slow  progress  in developing  procurement  regulation \nanchored by a law; slow progress in developing standard tools in terms of bidding documents \nand users manuals; weakness in procurement capacity in implementing agencies, especially at \nthe provincial and district levels; and collusion and corruption practices in the bidding process, \nalong with concerns over the efficiency of anticorruption and sanction measures.  \n \n22.  A new presidential decree has been drafted that, when issued, will establish a fully \nindependent  Goods/Services  Procurement  Policy  Development  Institution  (Lembaga \nPengembangan Kebijakan Pengadaan Pemerintah, or LPKPP). The planned institution will be \nchaired  by  an  appointee  from  the  civil  service  (nonpolitical),  who  may  be  assisted  by  a \ncommittee  comprised  of  procurement  experts  sourced  from  both  inside  and  outside \ngovernment. The establishment of the LPKPP, in itself, should not be regarded as reforming \npublic sector procurement. Rather, it should be perceived as the first crucial stepping stone to \nenable focus on a wider public procurement reform program.  \n \n23.  Laws enacted since 2000 impacting, or making reference to, public procurement cover \nconstruction (governing civil works), state finance, treasury, audit, and small-scale business. \nThe pace of Indonesia\u2019s commendable decentralization reforms has impacted public sector \nprocurement at all levels of government, with ministers, governors, and even mayors able to \nissue decrees, regulations, and instructions. The plethora of regulations is often inconsistent, \nand  many  regulations  do  not  meet  accepted  international  practice.  Consequently,  national \nprocurement reform and the need for national procurement policies and standards have become \nurgent. \n \n24.  Indonesia\u2019s legal framework for public sector procurement can best be strengthened by \nanchoring  it  with  an  overarching,  consolidated,  and  comprehensive  national  public  sector \nprocurement  law  at  the  highest  level  that  (i)  establishes  the  fundamental  principles  and \nprocedures applicable to all public sector procurement, (ii) allows for the imposition of sanctions \nwhere the principles and procedures, and particularly those relating to good governance and \nethics, are not met, (iii) amends other laws that refer to public sector procurement, and (iv) \nensures that such law has the necessary authority in a decentralized environment. Drafts of a \nnew high-level law and associated subordinate regulations are being finalized and should be \nready by the end of 2007. \n \n25.  Standard  Bidding  Documents.  Currently,  there  are  no  national  standard  bidding \ndocuments in Indonesia. Some implementing agencies (such as the Ministry of Public Works) \nhave developed standard bidding documents for their own use. However, there is no evidence \nthat such documents are consistently used at all levels of government. The NPPO, through the \nsupport  of  ADB,  has  drafted  eight  National  Model  (Standard)  Bidding  Documents:  (i)  An \nExplanatory  Guide,  (ii)  Goods  with  Pre-qualification,  (iii)  Goods  with  Post-qualification,  (iv) \nWorks  with  Pre-qualification,  (v)  Works  with  Post-qualification,  (vi)  Other  Services  with \n ", "Appendix 8  81 \nPre-qualification,  (vii)  Other  Services  with  Post-qualification,  and  (viii)  Consulting  Services. \nThese are now available in a draft form in the Indonesian language only. The use of these \ndocuments is still not mandatory, and, in fact, there is still no strong push from the NPPO to \nenforce their use at the national level. The NPPO preference is to try these documents on a pilot \nbasis. While Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 provides the basic requirements to be included in \nGeneral Conditions of Contract, such a standard has yet to be produced. \n \n26.  Capacity Building and Certification. There has been growing concern, both in the \nGovernment and the ADB and World Bank, over the pace of project implementation. Significant \ndelays and slow disbursement seem to occur across the entire PFM cycle. Projects reported \ndelays  and  difficulties  in  budget  preparation  and  approval,  budget  execution,  and \nimplementation  (procurement).  Specifically,  there  are  concerns  on  the  implementation \n(procurement) capacity of government staff and the absence of incentives for project managers \nand procurement committees. Added to this, fears of prosecution have also affected projects \ndue to the reluctance of officials to take action amid growing worries of being prosecuted under \nanticorruption legislation, even over minor mistakes.  \n \n27.  On Capacity Building. Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 required the Government to \nadopt an examination system and certification for procurement practitioners within Government \ncontracting entities, in order to ensure that their level of competence is consistent with their level \nof responsibilities. So far, the rate of staff passing the basic procurement certification is very low \n(12%). It is evident that there is need for a strategic approach to capacity building. The future \nLPKPP will consider creating a professional procurement training and certification board in order \nto develop and integrate a cost-effective procurement capacity-building program. \n \n28.  Corruption, Sanction and Independent Appeals Mechanism. Despite improvements \nin the public procurement system, concerns remain over corrupt and collusive practices. Several \ncases under ADB and World Bank projects have come to light. While addressing this requires \nan  overall  governance  strategy,  there  are  several  important  elements  in  the  procurement \nsystem that can support such a strategy, such as an independent complaints mechanism, an \neffective  sanctions  mechanism,  and  improving  transparency  in  the  procurement  process \nthrough e-procurement.  \n \n29.  Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 requires the establishment of a complaints handling \nmechanism. However, this is not set up independently but within each implementing agency. As \npart of the ongoing Country Procurement Assessment Report, options to be explored include to \nhave an independent complaints handling mechanism under the \u201cumbrella\u201d but independent of \nthe LPKPP, or possibly to have a totally independent body comprising individuals from private \nsector professional organizations and civil servants with expertise in public sector procurement \nand procurement law. \n \n30.  E-procurement. The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and City of Surabaya have both \nbeen at the forefront in the development of e-government procurement (e-GP) technology. The \nNPPO  has  been  taking  the  lead  on  behalf  of  the  Government  for  implementing  e-GP  in \nIndonesia at a national level. Currently, the focus is on developing policy and legislation for the \nvalidity  of  e-GP,  including  electronic  documents  and  signatures.  The  NPPO  has  also \nestablished an electronic bulletin board for advertising national procurement opportunities. The \nNPPO is considering to adopt a national e-GP system similar to that adopted by the City of \nSurabaya and to pilot the e-tendering functionality as a first step. Eventually, MOPW will need to \ndecide whether to adopt the national system in its entirety or ensure that its own system will \nintegrate with it. Currently, the MPW quasi e-system is used for large national road works \n ", "82  Appendix 8 \ncontracts  in  Java  and  Sumatra.  Generally,  the  MPW  system  provides  most  of  the  online \nfunctionalities  for  e-tendering  that  would  be  required  by  international  standards.  However, \nsubmission of bids is still being done manually due to the absence of legislation to allow the full \nprocess as described above.  \n \nI.  Accounting and Reporting on Budget Execution \n \n31.  The  aggregate  Government  Annual  Financial  Statements  have  been  prepared  in  a \ntimely manner for 3 years now (2004, 2005, and 2006). Although the timeliness is a significant \nachievement, serious concerns remain over their reliability. The BPK has for 3 years issued a \n\u201cdisclaimer\u201d  opinion  on  these  financial  statements  due,  among  various  factors,  to  serious \nshortcomings in the control environment in which these statements were prepared and due to \nscope limitations.  \n \n32.  The  aggregate  annual  financial  statements  present  revenues,  expenditures  and \ntransfers, surpluses or deficits, and financing aggregates in comparison with budget provisions. \nA balance sheet and a cash flow statement are also presented, along with a full statement of \ngovernment accounting policy.  \n \n33.  The recent development of Government Accounting Standards is a step forward in \nimproving  financial  reporting,  although  the  requirement  of  the  State  Treasury  Law  for  the \ncomplete introduction of accrual accounting by 2008 is very ambitious and may not be realistic. \nThe Accounting Standards Committee has been in operation for a few years now, and during \nthat time it has put into place a due process for developing government accounting standards \nthat are well aligned with comparable international standards. Technical capacity constraints \nlimit  the  pace  at  which  these  accounting  standards  can  be  implemented  at  all  levels  of \ngovernment, including line ministries and subnational governments. \n \n34.  Monthly and quarterly reports on budget realization are produced by each ministry on a \nmonthly basis and sent to the MOF for consolidation. A midyear unaudited report on budget \nrealization is presented to the DPR in July and is available to civil society. \n  \n35.  There are no systematic and publicly available reports of the Government\u2019s contingent \nliabilities,  tax  expenditures,  or  quasi-fiscal  activities.  Data  on  central  government  debt  are \nregularly  published,  but  there  are time  lags  in  reporting  total  debt and  concerns  over  the \nreliability of the data on external public debt. Information on government financial assets is \npublished annually.  \n \n36.  Although  commendable  action  has  been  taken  to  improve  government  financial \nreporting, there continue to be serious challenges in making government financial statements \nreliable, as reported by the BPK in its annual audit report for 2006. This reflects the immense \nchallenges that lie ahead in an environment where accounting capacity at the grassroots is \nweak and accounting processes are not yet integrated or fully automated. \n \nJ.  External Audit \n \n37.  Indonesia has made significant progress7 in addressing deficiencies in the audit sector \nover the past few years. The enactment of the State Audit Law in 2004 clarified the BPK\u2019s \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2007. Sector Report on Accountability and Audit in Indonesia. (produced under TA-4473 INO: Support for \nImplementation of Program Loan). Manila.  \n ", "Appendix 8  83 \nmandate as the sole external state audit agency, granting it extensive rights of audit over public \nfinance that are generally in line with international standards (Lima Declaration). In practice, \nhowever, some restrictions continue to apply.  \n \n38.  In addition, the State Audit Agency Law was passed by Parliament in 2006, laying down \ninternal and external governance arrangements for the BPK as an organization on matters such \nas the appointment of BPK Board members and financial and administration independence. The \nBPK has issued a series of internal implementing regulations for these laws and has also \nrecently issued a new set of Government Auditing Standards that are substantially in line with \ncomparable international standards (International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions). \nThe BPK has completed a comprehensive study of its organizational structure compared with \nfully  developed  audit  institutions  in  other  countries  and has  also  prepared  a medium-term \nstrategic development plan. Significant increases in budgetary financial resources have been \ngranted to the BPK for its operational needs. \n \n39.   A peer review of the BPK was completed in 2004 and revealed serious weaknesses in \ncapacity. Since then, improvements are gradually being made to the organization, with new \nhires and training. Spending agencies generally respond well to audit findings reported by the \nBPK.  The  BPK\u2019s  audit  reports  are  submitted  semiannually  to  Parliament  within  a  legally \nmandated time. These reports certify the financial statements of the audited reporting entities \nand comment on any irregularities or inefficiencies in budget execution that may have been \nfound. However, there appears to be little systematic follow-up by the DPR on BPK reports and \nno formal reporting of this. A recent study by ADB8 has highlighted the need for capacity \nbuilding at the DPR Secretariat in order to handle audit reports and information constructively. \nPublic disclosure of all BPK audit reports is now mandatory. \n \nK.  Internal Controls and Internal Audit \n \n40.  The  internal  audit  framework  of  the  Government  is  extensive,  but  scope  and \norganization do not match needs. Ironically, even with (or perhaps because of) multiple internal \naudit  agencies  in  existence,  the  internal  audit  function  continues  to  be  a  weak  link  in \ngovernance. The internal audit function is carried out at central government by three institutions: \nthe Inspectorate General (IG) in each spending ministry; the government-wide internal auditor \n(the  State  Financial  Control  Agency,  or  BPKP),  reporting  to  the  President\u2019s  office,  with \ngovernment-wide jurisdiction; and the Regional Supervision Agency (BAWASDA) at the local \ngovernment level.  \n \n41.  This institutional structure is complex, and the mandates and division of labor between \nthe various internal audit institutions are unclear. The IG represents the principal internal audit \napparatus  of  a  ministry.  The  scope  of  IG  audit  activities  is  generally  limited  to  technical \ncompliance audits. The IGs therefore operate as individual institutions corresponding to the \nnumber of ministries. Professional backgrounds of IG staff therefore normally include technical \nqualifications and not accounting or auditing. Audits by IGs are not conducted on a risk-based \nmethodology. Local governments maintain their own internal audit units (BAWASDA). \n \n42.  BPKP\u2019s staffing levels do not reflect its reduced mandate. Despite this reduced mandate, \nit maintains fully staffed decentralized offices in 26 provinces. The BPKP no longer has a formal \nrole in internal audit, except to provide audit services to line ministries upon request. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006 Report on Capacity Building Needs of DPR Secretariat on Review of BPK Reports. (produced under TA \n4473-INO: Support for Implementation of Program Loan). Manila. \n ", "84  Appendix 8 \n \n43.  Each line ministry plays the role of program executing agency and is therefore principally \nresponsible for maintaining internal controls. It is responsible for performing and achieving the \nobjectives  stated  in  budget  allotment  documents.  In  order  to  strengthen  responsibility  and \naccountability over the appropriated budget by the line ministries, the function of payment order \nissuance has been transferred to the line ministries. This is resulting in a better segregation of \nthe functions for verifying transactions and issuing payments. While this segregation of duties is \nwell designed, implementation experience has not been entirely satisfactory in the absence of \nclearly  defined  standards  of  accounting  evidence,  verification  procedures,  and  well-staffed \nprepayment audit units in the spending agencies.  \n \nL.  Reforming Regional Public Financial Management \n \n44.  Decentralization  has  provided  local  governments  with  significant  resources  and \nauthority. This requires an adequate regulatory framework and PFM capacity at the local level. \nThe  PFM  reforms  stipulated  in  the  decentralization  and  subsequent  finance  and  treasury \nlegislation aim to modernize the regional PFM system and improve accountability (assuming \nefficient  implementation),  but  these  reforms  are  vast  in  scope  and  the  concepts  are \nsophisticated. \n \n45.  The regulatory framework for regional PFM reforms is largely in place and includes \nmechanisms  for  fiscal  transfers  to  local  governments.  After  decentralization,  the  central \ngovernment passed comprehensive legislation for PFM reforms at the regional level to mirror \nthe changes being made at the centre.  \n \n46.  Most regions lack adequate technical and human resources to implement the reforms, \nhowever, and the central government has not yet provided the needed support. The unclear \ndivision of tasks between the MOF and Ministry of Home Affairs has resulted in inconsistent and \ncontradictory legislation with regards to regional financial management, and this has caused \nconfusion among most local governments. While subnational governments are obliged by law to \nreport certain fiscal and financial information to the central government, many do not (the data \nmay be missing or simply withheld voluntarily).  \n  \nM.  State-Owned Enterprises \n \n47.  Indonesia has a sound legal framework for corporate governance and monitoring state-\nowned enterprise (SOE) operations. First, the SOE Law, No. 19/2003, sets a clear ownership \npolicy, as the state is not allowed to be involved in the day-to-day management of SOEs and \nmust allow them full operational autonomy. Second, a 2002 ministerial decree clearly details \ncorporate governance responsibilities, including the requirements to (i) submit each quarter the \nSOEs\u2019 financial statements to the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises and to the appropriate \nline ministries, (ii) prepare annual financial statements that must be audited internally and by an \nindependent auditor, and (iii) publish SOE annual reports in a timely manner.  \n \n48.  Existing laws and regulations governing SOEs are not effectively implemented. Long \ndelays still occur in auditing and publishing SOE financial statements. SOE annual reports are \nusually only regularly and systematically made public in cases where companies have accessed \nthe local capital markets with listed instruments. \n \n49.  The planned use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) to accelerate investment will \ncreate fiscal risks that merit disclosure. The Government has taken steps to mitigate fiscal risks \n ", "Appendix 8  85 \nfrom PPPs. Presidential Regulation No. 67/2005 emphasizes careful project preparation and the \nselection of bidders in an open, competitive tender. It gives the minister of finance the right to \napprove or reject requests for government support. \n \nN.  Debt Management \n \n50.  Two  major  initiatives  in  debt  management  have  been  launched.  Despite  recent \nimprovements in debt indicators, risks to the Government\u2019s budget remain substantial, and \nfurther improvements in debt management are essential to avoid future debt distress. MOF has \nmade good progress in this regard. Two specific examples are the development and publication \nof a comprehensive debt management strategy in September 2005 and the decision to create a \nDirectorate General for Public Debt Management. The Government is now working on a more \nformal debt sustainability analysis. \n \nO.  Governance and Anticorruption  \n \n51.  The  Anti-Corruption  Commission  (KPK)  is  fully  operational  and  performs  its  duties \nindependently, free from any influence. It coordinates with other entities combating corruption, \nconducts investigations and prosecutions against corrupt acts, performs preventative actions \nagainst corruption, and monitors state governance. It has initiated and signed memoranda of \nunderstanding  with  some  provincial  and  local  governments  to  establish  and  support  good \ngovernance at the subnational level. As its capacity to carry out prosecutions is limited to a few \ncases per year, its focus tends to be on high-level, large-scale corruption.  \n \nP.  Key Areas for Future Attention  \n \n52.  In the period ahead, progress of the following key ongoing PFM reforms will need to be \nclosely monitored: \n(i)  Ensuring coherence and momentum in public financial management reform.  \n(ii)  Deepening the reforms of the central government budgetary sector along the \nlines discussed above. \n(iii)  Ensuring  greater  integrity  and  more  effective  management  of  public  funds \nthrough implementing a TSA, automating the treasury payments system, and \ninstituting measures to prevent the proliferation of off-budget bank accounts. \n(iv)  Strengthening internal audit institutions by establishing synergistic relationships \nbetween them and removing overlaps. \n(v)  Implementing a new treasury system, extending implementation of Government \nAccounting  Standards,  and  reengineering  underlying  business  processes  at \nspending agencies to ensure reliable financial reporting. \n(vi)  Widening the reforms throughout government. This means extending modern \nfinancial accountability and management processes to subnational governments \nin a coordinated manner and bringing these fully in line with emerging national \nstandards.  \n \n53.  Many of these reforms are being actively considered, and prioritized implementation \nplans are being developed by the Government. The capacity to centrally monitor these and \nother reforms has recently been established at the Secretary General\u2019s Office of MOF. The \nongoing work on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability indicators will also assist the \nGovernment in setting benchmarks and monitoring progress. \n \n \n ", "86  Appendix 8 \nQ.  Management of Foreign Exchange \n \n54.  The foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The \ncountry is no longer subject to the Extended Arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia was \nlast subject to the transitional procedures under the Fund\u2019s safeguards assessment policy in \n2002. That assessment recommended remedial action to address a number of vulnerabilities in \nBI\u2019s audit arrangements. The main recommendations have been implemented, including the \nestablishment of an independent audit committee at BI and the publication of BI\u2019s audited \nfinancial statements. BI\u2019s audited financial statements for 2006 have been reviewed, and we \nnote that the audit report issued by the BPK contained an unqualified audit opinion. \n \nR.  Conclusion \n \n55.  Following initial years of analytical work, Indonesia has taken impressive steps in recent \nyears to build upon this work and establish a sound legal and administrative framework for \nmodern PFM. Changes in the legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and \nthe momentum has shifted towards implementation of new PFM practices.  \n \n56.  Known weaknesses in financial management and accountability continue to be gradually \naddressed through the PFM reform program discussed above. The development partners are \nactively engaged in this process. Key elements of the reforms are supported by the DPL \ntriggers, as well as by the GFMRAP project and initiatives supported by development partners. \nMuch remains to be done, however. It will clearly take time to realize the full impact of these \nreforms and to attain high standards in every element of sound PFM.  \n \n57.  In the meantime, some fiduciary risks will arise for this operation. Although the pace of \nimplementing the planned reforms has been somewhat slow over the past year, the trajectory of \nreform  is  in  the  right  direction  and  the  current  Government  continues  to  demonstrate  a \ncommitment to completing the planned reforms in public financial management. Taking these \ninto consideration, we do not propose putting in place any additional fiduciary arrangements for \nthis operation. \n ", "  Appendix 9  87 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Indonesia/Third Development Policy Support Program (DPSP-3) \n \nSoutheast Asia \nLending/Financing  Department/  Department \nPolicy-Based \nModality:  Division:  (SERD)/Indonesia \nResident Mission (IRM) \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nBased on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nThe National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) has five basic strategies for poverty reduction: (i) broadening opportunities, \n(ii) empowering community institutions, (iii) increasing capacity, (iv) providing social protection, and (v) promoting global \npartnerships. The NPRS is to be implemented through macroeconomic strategy and policies for fulfilling basic rights, \npromoting gender justice and equality, and regional development. The NPRS considers macroeconomic policies as the \nfoundation for reducing poverty through a supportive business environment and broad opportunities for increasing the \ncapability of the poor through four related objectives to (i) create macroeconomic stability, (ii) promote economic growth, (iii) \nincrease  opportunities  for  employment  and  entrepreneurship,  and  (iv)  reduce  inequalities  between  regions.  The \nGovernment\u2019s Medium-Term National Development Plan, or RPJM, includes the main tenets of the previous draft NPRS and \nalso incorporates the eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This provides an overarching framework that places \nhuman development and poverty reduction at the center of the development agenda. \n \nThe country poverty assessment1 and country poverty partnership agreement2 consider macroeconomic stability as a \nfundamental underpinning to poverty reduction. Under the agreement, Asian Development Bank (ADB) has agreed to \nsupport the Government in promoting macroeconomic stability for inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Highest priority is \ngiven to institutional reforms to achieve transparent and accountable institutions. The poverty agreement also calls for \nexpanding and improving such key basic services as health, education, water supply, and sanitation through public-private \npartnerships, and points out the need to expand the system of social protection. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                             Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nDPSP-3 supports key areas of the RPJM and NPRS, including the investment climate, public financial management and \ngovernance, and service delivery to the poor. The DPSP-3 triggers or policy actions under these core areas are unlikely to \nharm the poor, while several triggers have the potential to reduce poverty in the medium term.   \n \n2. Design Features. Not applicable \n \nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country and major \ngroups affected. \n \nThe majority of triggers under these core policy areas concern policy areas that do not directly affect the household budgets of \nthe poor. The links between poverty reduction and areas such as tax and customs administration, investment procedures, \nfinancial sector improvements, and increased transparency are indirect, through increased economic growth. Bureaucratic \nbarriers to establishing new businesses, increasing access to finance, and strengthening transparency are all areas involving \nconstraints to growth in the medium term. \n \nThree triggers in the DPSP-3 policy matrix are, however, likely to affect the poor in a more direct manner: (i) Changes in tariff \nrates can alter the purchasing power of poor households. Tariff reductions in goods that make up a significant share of poor \nhouseholds\u2019 budgets will benefit the poor by increasing their purchasing power. To mitigate risks of adverse affects in low \nincome groups, the additional research capacity mandated by the trigger should enable policymakers to use empirical \nestimates of the impact of tariff adjustments on poor household as an input into the policy process. (ii) An effective \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005: Indonesia: Country Poverty Assessment. Manila.  \n2  ADB. 2002. ADB-Indonesia Country Poverty Partnership Agreement. Manila.  \n ", "88 Appendix 9 \nassessment framework for selected service delivery can also reduce poverty in the medium to long term. The poor \ndisproportionately suffer from low quality services and low levels of access to health, education, and infrastructure. As a \nresult, 50% of the bottom quintile complete grade 7 compared with 90% of the richest quintile. Similar large inequalities are \npresent in health outcomes and water access. (iii) Teacher certification also has great potential to improve the quality of \nschools in poor areas, since only 55% and 73% of primary and secondary teachers, respectively, currently meet the \nminimum qualifications required by the Ministry of National Education.  \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social analysis). \n \nThe policy reforms of DPSP-3 do not adversely affect vulnerable groups. \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. \n \nThe trigger on enhancing procedures for tariff setting (trigger 4) has the potential to increase the purchasing power of poor \nhouseholds.  The  triggers  relating  to  implementing  the  investment  law  (trigger  5)  and  to  simplifying  and  eliminating \nunnecessary business licenses (trigger 6) may indirectly improve growth and poverty outcomes by encouraging additional \ninvestment and competition, respectively. The trigger relating to increasing access to finance for small and medium \nenterprises (trigger 7) may indirectly reduce poverty through additional growth, while the trigger relating to consolidation of \ncore government bank accounts (trigger 10) and implementing transparent accountability arrangements for RDI and RDA \naccounts (trigger 11) has the potential to indirectly improve poverty by increasing local outlays and possibly reducing \ncorruption. The trigger relating to developing an enhanced assessment framework for selected service delivery programs \n(trigger 15) has the potential to focus attention on service delivery in poor areas to improve poverty outcomes. Finally, the \ntrigger relating to carryover of community-designed development (CDD) budgets over multiyear periods (trigger 17), would \nallow communities and local governments greater flexibility in determining CDD projects and maintaining existing projects \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe policy actions or triggers under DPSP-3 are not likely to harm the poor and, if they affect them at all, they will do more \ngood for the poor. The main impacts, as mentioned above, are indirect.   \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe DPL series has supported actions that have been taken by the Government as part of its own reform agenda. The \ndevelopment of this reform agenda has been done in close consultation with civil society. In particular, the Government \nundertook extensive consultation with key stakeholders on all four recently issued policy packages for 2006/2007 \u2014 in \ninfrastructure, investment climate, SMEs, and the financial sector. The Government has engaged extensively with civil \nsociety on tax and investment law reforms. The entire set of DPL-4/DPSP-3 policy actions will, as was done last year, likely \nbe discussed with Parliament. The design and implementation of the unconditional cash transfer anti-poverty program \ninvolved substantial participation by development partners and civil society. This extended to the evaluation of these \nprograms, as well. Such a systematic assessment of key government programs, making these findings public, and using \nthese findings to help design future anti-poverty programs is a first in Indonesia.  \n \nMoreover, as part of the development policy loan process, consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, \nincluding the private sector, labor groups, and enterprises. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n \n   Information sharing         Consultation        Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. The DPL/DPSP process supports the Government\u2019s C&P process \n \n \nC. Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues. The DPL/DPSP series has indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on making services work for the \npoor. The improved poverty orientation of public spending increases women\u2019s access to essential services for achieving \nMillennium Development Goal targets, including to reduce child and maternal mortality. Improvement of the financial \n ", "  Appendix 9  89 \nmanagement systems of the Government through increased transparency and accountability will provide the civil society with \nbasic information necessary to monitor government actions and enable it to provide inputs into policy and budget decisions. \nA strengthened civil society provides women with a more effective channel for voicing their priorities. An improved \ninvestment climate is expected to provide greater opportunities for women, who experience significantly higher rates of \nunemployment, even when controlling for experience and level of education. \n \n2.  Key Actions.
