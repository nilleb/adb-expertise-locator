The DPSP series\u2014cofinancing the Development \nPolicy  Loan  (DPL)  series  supported  by  the  World  Bank  and  the \nGovernment  of  Japan\u2014is  embedded \nthe  Government\u2019s \nMedium-Term National Development Plan (RPJM) for 2004\u20132009. \nIt  supports  the  RPJM\u2019s  broad  goals  of  stimulating  higher  and \nsustainable economic growth (up to 7% average annual growth by \n2009 from levels of around 4% prior to 2004) and halving poverty \n(to  8.2%  by  2009  from  16.6%  in  2004).  To  achieve  these  goals, \nDPSP-3  supports  wide-ranging  reforms  in  three  core  areas  to  (i) \nimprove  the  investment  climate,  (ii)  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement  and  anticorruption,  and  (iii)  improve  public  service \ndelivery. DPSP-3 is proposed as a single-tranche operation based \non  completed  actions  demonstrating  satisfactory  progress.    While \nbuilding  on  reforms  undertaken  during  past  DPSPs,  DPSP-3  sets \nthe  groundwork  for  an  expanded  policy  dialogue  for  future \noperations. \n \nThe DPL series aims to harmonize policy reform support from key \ndevelopment  partners.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  DPL  process \neffectively  builds  on  and  deepens  sector-specific \nreforms \nsupported  by  ADB  through  its  past,  ongoing,  and  planned \noperations under the Country Strategy and Program 2006\u20132009. \n \nADB\u2019s participation in the DPL stems from its endeavors to reduce \ntransaction  costs  for  its  developing  member  countries.  The \napproach  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  reform  agenda,  as  outlined  in \nthe  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  and  the  Middle-Income \nCountry  Initiative.  Participation  in  DPL  helps  implement  and  fulfill \nADB\u2019s  obligations  to  the  Rome  Declaration  on  harmonizing \nprocedures of multilateral development banks (February 2003) and \nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (March 2005). \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  impact  of  DPSP-3  will  be  in  the  form  of  higher  economic \ngrowth that is sustained over the medium term and lower levels of \npoverty  and  unemployment.  Its  principal  outcomes  include  (i) \nimproved  macroeconomic  stability,  (ii)  better  investment  climate, \n(iii)  good  governance  in  public  administration,  and  (iv)  improved \ndelivery of public services. DPSP-3 consists of reforms in the latter \nthree core policy areas. \n \nFor  DPSP-3,  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a \nloan of $200 million. DPSP-3 provides parallel cofinancing for the \nWorld  Bank  supported  Fourth  DPL  (DPL-4),  for  which  the \nGovernment  has  requested  $600  million.  The  Government  has \nalso  requested  $200  million  from  the  Government  of  Japan  to \ncofinance DPL-4. \n \n\n \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Period \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A single-tranche program loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)  based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a \n15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum;  conversion \noptions  that  may  be  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  draft  loan \nagreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s conversion guidelines; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in  the  draft \nprogram loan agreement. \n \nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n \nThe Program implementation period for DPSP-3 is from January to \nDecember 2007 and the loan amount will be disbursed in a single \ntranche  upon  declaration  of  loan  effectiveness.  DPSP-3  covers \nprogress  made  in  general  macroeconomic  and  key  high-level \nsector  reforms  during  the  course  of  2007.  All  actions  included  in \nthe policy matrix have been implemented within the year. DPSP-3 \nfits  within  the  overall  reform  agenda  supported  under  the  DPLs, \nwhich cover 2003\u20132008. \n \nCoordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs \n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \naccordance  with \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program \nLoans,  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Republic  of \nIndonesia  as  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import  documentation \nwill  be  required  if,  during  each  year  when  loan  proceeds  are \nexpected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Indonesia\u2019s  total  imports \nminus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n\n\f \nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nimports  financed  under  other  official  development  assistance  is \nequal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be \ndisbursed  during  such  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its \ncompliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be \nrequired. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds \nand verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nThe key benefits expected from the DPSP series are: \n(i)  Progress toward the Government\u2019s medium-term objectives of \nimproved \nimproved \n\nmacroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness, \ninvestment  climate, \nreduced  corruption,  and \ngovernance. \n\n(ii)  Raising  the  profile  of  key  issues  at  the  ministerial  level, \naccelerating  the  timetable  for  policy  actions  to  be  taken, \naddressing  administrative  and  bureaucratic  bottlenecks,  and \nproviding an impetus for decision makers to further coordinate \nacross economic and line ministries. \n\n(iii) Institutional  development  within  government  institutions,  Bank \n\nIndonesia, and banks. \n\n(iv) Greater  public  confidence  in  the  banking  system  stemming \n\nfrom implementation of the deposit protection scheme. \n\n(v)  Sustained  ADB  engagement  in  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment on the direction and content of, and strategies for, \nits  economic,  structural,  and  institutional  reform  agenda\u2014with \nDPSP-3  providing  for  policy  continuity  and  consistency  in \nsectors where ADB has been actively involved. \n\n(vi) Facilitation,  through  crosscutting  reforms,  of  sector-specific \nreforms in areas where ADB is providing or planning support. \n(vii) Harmonization  and  parallel  financing  by  the  key  development \npartners (ADB, World Bank, and Government of Japan) around \na  common  policy  framework  and  dialogue,  and  the  resulting \nendorsement of the Government\u2019s sound policy implementation \nand macroeconomic management. \n\nthe  economy\u2019s  resilience \n\n \nImplementation of the DPSP series is subject to the following risks: \n \n(i) \nExternal vulnerabilities. With its increased integration into \nglobal  capital  markets,  Indonesia  remains  vulnerable  to  such \nexternal  shocks  as  a  capital  account  shock  or  a  global  economic \nslowdown.  With  improvements  in  its  macroeconomic  indicators, \nhowever, \nto  external  shocks  has \nincreased. Factors limiting the potential impact of external shocks \ninclude diversity of exports, limited external debt exposure, and an \nadequate level of reserves. While significant subsidies continue in \nfuel  and  electricity,  by  more  than  doubling  domestic  fuel  prices  in \n2005 Indonesia has significantly reduced its vulnerability to volatile \nglobal petroleum prices. The banking sector is also now sufficiently \nstrong to weather a moderate external shock. The maintenance of \na  financial  sector  safety  net  supported  by  the  DPL/DPSP  series \nwill help to improve the resilience of the banking sector. \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n(ii) \nPolicy  Coordination  risks.  Economic  volatility  could \nworsen if the Government does not sustain the reform momentum \nto follow up on the reduction in fuel subsidies. Lack of progress in \nstructural reforms or investment in infrastructure could soon lead to \nbottlenecks  which  would  limit  investment  and  potential  growth. \nFollowing  the  volatility  of  the  October  2005  fuel  price  hike, \nhowever,  the  need  for  rapid  policy  adjustment  on  the  domestic \nfront  in  line  with  key  global  developments  is  clearly  recognized. \nThe  Government  and  Bank  Indonesia  have  also  considerably \nenhanced  their  coordination,  which  will  be  reinforced  by  the \nmeasures under DPSP-3. \nFiduciary  constraints. Notwithstanding the improvements \n(iii) \nunderway, there are continuing concerns on the utilization of public \nresources.  The  overall  fiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since \n2001 (with the Country Financial Accountability Assessment) have \nindicated  considerable  improvements  in  the  overall  fiduciary \nenvironment in Indonesia. Ongoing programs supported by several \ndevelopment  partners  provide  significant  technical  assistance \nsupport  to  strengthen  fiduciary  governance.  The  DPSP  focus  on \ntreasury  single  account  implementation  will  significantly  enhance \ntransparency. \n(iv) \nPublic  opposition  to  reforms.  Tariff  reforms  and  some \naspects of investment climate reforms, such as relate to labor, are \ngenerally opposed by the public as well as special interest groups. \nThe  Government  managed  the  fuel  subsidy  reduction  well,  but \nlabor reforms have slowed. DPSP allows for flexibility, enabling the \nGovernment  to  build  consensus  for  reforms  to  ensure  their \nacceptance.       \n(v) \nfrom \nsectarian  and  regional  conflicts  and  terrorism  could  slow  foreign \ndirect  investment  and  set  back  the  recovering  tourism  industry. \nThe  Government  and  law  enforcement  authorities  have  taken  a \nrange  of  measures  aimed  at  rebuilding  public  and  investor \nconfidence. \n\nrisks.  Alerts  stemming \n\nHeightened  security \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Third  Development  Policy  Support  Program  (DPSP-3), \nwhich  constitutes  the  second  of  two  subprograms  of  a  program  cluster  for  the  DPSP.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nA. \n\nSector Performance, Issues, and Opportunities \n\nTen  years  after  the  East  Asia  financial  crisis,  Indonesia  has  transitioned  into  a  very \n2. \ndifferent  country,  becoming  in  the  process  more  stable,  more  democratic,  and  increasingly \nresilient  to  both  internal  and  external  shocks.  The  concern  is  no  longer  one  of  economic \nstabilization  and  recovery,  but  is  one  of  achieving  and  sustaining  higher  rates  of  growth  to \nreduce unemployment, poverty, and overall levels of vulnerability. To achieve these objectives, \nthe Government is pursuing a pro-growth agenda while pushing forward on broad structural and \ninstitutional  reforms.  Progress  has  been  made  on  all  fronts,  albeit  unevenly  in  some  areas. \nDespite  recent  improvements,  there  is  a  continued  need  to  improve  the  investment  climate, \npublic  financial  management,  and  service  delivery  mechanisms  to  the  poor.  The  DPSP  series \nhas  allowed  the  Government  to  work  with  development  partners  in  a  flexible  manner  to \nimplement  critical  high-level  macroeconomic  and  crosscutting  sector  reforms  that  address \nconstraints to growth and poverty reduction while providing predictability of financial support. As \nsuch, its coverage is fairly broad. Governance is a recurring theme throughout the DPSP series, \nas  it  aims  to  promote  transparency  in  all  its  core  policy  areas.  The  proposed  DPSP-3  is \nanchored  in  the  country  strategy  and  program,1 which  in  turn  provides  for  deeper  sector-level \ninterventions  to  complement  the  macroeconomic  and  governance  reforms  supported  through \nDPSP-3.  DPSP-3  builds  on  past  DPSP  operations  to  further  support  the  Government  on  key \nreform  measures  in  the  core  areas  of  investment  climate,  public  financial  management  and \nanticorruption, and service delivery to the poor.  \n \nSustained  Macroeconomic  Performance.  Economic  growth  has  picked  up  in  2007 \n3. \nfollowing  a  mild  slowdown  in  2005  and  the  first  half  of  2006  caused  by  a  sharp  spike  in \nadministered  fuel  prices  and  a  subsequent  hike  in  interest  rates.  Year-on-year  growth  rates \ndipped to 5% through mid-2006, but then recovered to 6% in the second half of 2006 and edged \nup  to  6.1%  during  the  first  half  of  2007.  The  main  drivers  in  recent  growth  were  private \nconsumption,  a  recovery  in  private  investment,  and  solid  expansion  of  net  exports.  These \ndevelopments  have  been  underpinned  by  a  pickup  in  domestic  credit  and  falling  inflation  and \ninterest rates. Year-on-year inflation eased to 6.9% in October 2007, from a peak of 18.4% in \nNovember 2005, as the impact of the 126% rise in fuel prices in October 2005 faded. Inflation is \nnow within the Bank Indonesia (BI) inflation target range of 5\u20137%. With the easing of inflationary \npressures,  BI,  which  had  earlier  lifted  its  policy  rate  (SBI  1  month)  by  450  basis  points  in \nresponse to the rise in prices, has lowered interest rates from 12.8% in May 2006 to 8.25% in \nJuly  2007.    In  recent  months  BI  has  maintained  this  rate  in  view  of  the  rising  volatility  in \ninternational markets, and inflationary developments. \n \n4. \nThe  lowering  of  the  BI  rate  has  led  to  a  corresponding  reduction  in  commercial  bank \nlending and deposit rates and a recovery in credit growth. Notwithstanding an easing of deposit \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132009): Indonesia. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nrates, deposit mobilization has continued to gather pace and reflect growing public confidence in \nthe  banking  sector.    The  stronger  growth  in  lending  led  to  increased  profitability  for  banks,  as \nlending  rates  are  less  elastic  than  deposit  rates  with  respect  to  BI\u2019s  policy  rate.  At  the  end  of \nJuly  2007,  banks\u2019  nonperforming  loans  amounted  to  6.5%  (gross)  and  3.o%  (net).  Banks \nremained  well  capitalized,  with  a  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  20.5%.  Indonesia\u2019s  strengthened \nfundamentals  and  yield  differentials  have  attracted  significant  foreign  portfolio  inflows  and \nhelped  propel  the  Jakarta  Composite  Index  up  by  46.4%  between  end-2006  and  end-October \n2007.  The  portfolio  inflows,  in  turn,  helped  to  support  the  rupiah,  which  has  remained  broadly \nstable  amidst  some  volatility  in  recent  months.    The  overall  favorable  external  developments \nalso led to a fall in the external debt-GDP ratio (one of the main external risk indicators) to 33% \nin 2006 from around 82% in 2001. Citing the improved policy environment, Standard & Poor\u2019s \nraised Indonesia\u2019s sovereign rating from B+ in 2006 to BB- in 2007.  \n \nFiscal  policy  remains  geared  towards  accelerating  development  spending2 while  at  the \n5. \nsame time reducing public debt. Higher social spending has been made possible by the fiscal \nspace of about $10 billion a year generated as a result of reduction in the fuel subsidy, as well \nas  by  increased  revenues  of  about  $5  billion  from  more  effective  tax  administration  and \ndeclining debt service payments. As a result, expenditures on education as a proportion of total \nnational expenditures have gone up from 14.2% in 2004 to an estimated 17.1% in 2007 while \nexpenditures on health have increased from 3.8% to 4.5% during the same period. The overall \nbudget deficit has been gradually increasing in recent years from 0.5% of GDP in 2005, to 0.9% \nin  2006,  and  a  projected  1.5%  of  GDP  in  2007  (versus  a  budgeted  1.1%).  This  reflects \nexpenditures to mitigate the effects of natural disasters and recognition of the need to ramp up \nmuch-needed  development  expenditures,  which  have  been  lagging  behind  those  of  other \ncountries in the region. Before the crisis, development expenditures had been generally around \n7\u20138%  of  GDP.  These  dropped  considerably  at  the  time  of  the  financial  crisis  and  have  been \nfairly stagnant at around 2\u20133% of GDP since then. Although good progress has been made over \nthe past 2 years in reallocating spending from inefficient subsidies towards pro-poor programs, \nthere are concerns over the quality of such spending. That is especially true regarding health, \nwhere  more  resources  appear  to  be  going  to  services  predominantly  used  by  richer  income \nquintiles (secondary care). Moreover, spending on health, at below 1% of GDP, is low by most \ninternational standards while total investment on infrastructure (public, private, and state-owned \nenterprises), at around 3% of GDP, is still substantially below pre-crisis levels of 5\u20136% of GDP. \nAs a result, the road network, port facilities, water supply and sewerage facilities, and electricity \nsupply are all in need of substantial new investments.  The proposed budget for 2008 indicates \na significant increase in resources for the infrastructure and social sectors and a small increase \nin the overall deficit to 1.7% of GDP. \n \n6. \nIndonesia\u2019s move to decentralization in 2001, when significant authority was devolved to \ndistrict  governments,  has  significantly  altered  the  fiscal  fundamentals  of  the  country.  In  2006, \nwith the greater fiscal space provided by reduction in the fuel subsidy, transfers to the regions \nincreased from Rp150.5 trillion in 2005 to Rp226.4 trillion in 2006. These are projected to rise \nfurther  to  Rp252.5  trillion  in  2007.  Here  again  there  are  issues  relating  to  the  overall \neffectiveness of expenditure orientation, as increased fiscal transfers to the regions having been \noffset  to  some  extent  by  the  accumulation  of  regional  government  bank  deposits,  reflecting \nlimited  implementation  capacity  at  the  regional  level.  As  of  March  2007,  the  regions  were \nestimated to hold the equivalent of 2.5% of GDP in cash deposits with commercial banks. The \ncentral Government is encouraging local governments to use these large deposits to increase \npriority  spending,  notably  on  education,  health,  and  infrastructure.  The  central  Government  is \n\n                                                 \n2  Development spending comprises capital and social assistance spending. \n\n\falso  currently  rolling  out  a  community-designed  National  Community  Empowerment  Program \n(PNPM)  that  could  become  a  vehicle  for  lifting  development  spending  by  local  governments. \nThe  program  will  provide  resources  to  communities  to  undertake  locally  executed  small-scale \npublic works projects. \n \n7. \nThe  Government  aims  to  meet  the  additional  financing  for  the  fiscal  deficit  through \nissuing  government  securities  and  through  higher  concessional  borrowing  from  development \nbanks.  In  this  context,  the  Government  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nincrease  its  program  lending  from  $600  million  to  $900  million.  Notwithstanding  increased \nbudgetary financing requirements, given the sources of financing and steady economic growth, \nthe total Government debt-GDP ratio is projected to decline to around 35% at the end of 2007 \nfrom 39% at the end of 2006. \n \n\nTable 1: Indonesia Key \u2013 Macroeconomic Indicators \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n2002 \n\n2003 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n  \n\nIndicator \n\nReal GDP growth (%) \n\nInflation (%; average of period) \n\nM2 growth (% annual growth) \n\nExternal debt (as % of GDP) \nDebt service ratio (as % of exports of goods and \nservices) \n\nOverall fiscal balance (as % of GDP) \n\nCurrent account balance (as % of GDP) \n\nGross official reserves ($ billion) \n\n     in months of imports \n\n4.5 \n\n11.8 \n\n7.9 \n\n67.2 \n\n32.1 \n\n(1.6) \n\n4.0 \n\n32 \n\n6.8 \n\n4.8 \n\n6.8 \n\n9.8 \n\n57.7 \n\n29.8 \n\n(2.0) \n\n3.5 \n\n36.3 \n\n6.1 \n\n2004 \n\n5.0 \n\n6.1 \n\n10.0 \n\n53.5 \n\n31.2 \n\n(1.4) \n\n0.6 \n\n36.3 \n\n4.8 \n\n5.7 \n\n10.5 \n\n13.0 \n\n46.6 \n\n38.6 \n\n(0.3) \n\n0.1 \n\n34.7 \n\n4.4 \n\n5.5 \n\n13.1 \n\n18.1 \n\n36.6 \n\n37.5 \n\n (0.9) \n\n2.6 \n\n42.6 \n\n4.8 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n( ) = negative. \nGDP = gross domestic product; M2 = broad money. \nSources: Bank Indonesia, Central Bureau of Statistics, IMF Article IV 2007. \n  \n \nTranslating  Growth  into  Poverty  Reduction  and  Human  Development\u2014Poverty \n8. \nProfile and Prospects for Attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Indonesia has had \na good track record in poverty reduction and social development. The proportion of people living \nbelow  the  national  poverty  line  declined  consistently  from  about  40%  in  the  mid-1970s  to  just \nabove  17%  in  1996.  It  subsequently  had  a  sharp  spike  during  the  Asian  financial  crisis\u2014\nincreasing to 23.4% in 1999\u2014before declining to the precrisis levels of 16% in 2005. By March \n2006,  however,  the  poverty  incidence  had  risen  once  again  to  17.8%  (translating  into  an \nadditional 4 million people falling into poverty). The rise in poverty is largely attributed to higher \nrice  prices,  due  in  part  to  drought  conditions  that  delayed  the  planting  season,  a  ban  on  rice \nimports,  and  the  inflationary  impact  of  the  fuel  subsidy  reduction.  More  recent  data,  however, \nsuggest  that  the  pickup  in  growth  since  the  latter  half  of  2006  has  led  to  a  decline  in  the \nincidence  of  poverty  to  around  16.7%  as  of  March  2007.  These  levels  of  poverty,  however, \ntranslate  to  37.2  million  poor  people  and  remain  far  from  the  Millennium  Development  Goal \n(MDG)  target  of  7.6% by  2015,  and  the  Government\u2019s  own  target  of 8.2%  by  2009.  While  the \nlevel of extreme poverty (those living on less than $1 per day) remains relatively low at 8.5%, \nthe proportion living below $2 per day is 49.6%, or about 10 percentage points higher than the \ncomparable  average  for  East  Asia  (including  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China).  These  figures \nsuggest that there is a very large group of near-poor in Indonesia who are highly vulnerable to \nshocks at all levels. The poverty profile in Indonesia also indicates vast regional differences in \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fpoverty, with four provinces having poverty rates of less than 10% (with Jakarta at 3.4%) even \nas  at  least  14  provinces  have  poverty  rates  of  more  than  20%  (with  Papua  at  about  50%).  A \nchallenge for the Government is that while the poverty incidence is far higher in eastern regions, \nmost of Indonesia\u2019s poor actually live in the densely populated and relatively more prosperous \nwestern regions. \n \n9. \nIndonesia\u2019s progress toward meeting other MDG targets is somewhat  mixed (Table 2). \nMalnutrition remains a significant public health problem, with the percentage of children under 5 \nyears who are underweight (MDG1, Target 2) rising from 24.6% in 2000 to 28% in 2005. This \nhas been attributed in part to decentralization in 2000, since the responsibilities for the previous \nhighly  centralized  family  nutrition  programs  were  devolved  to  more  than  400  districts.  This  \ncreated difficulties in planning, financing, and supervising these programs. On the second MDG \ngoal  relating  to  education,  Indonesia  is  well  on  track  to  achieve  the  target  in  primary  net \nenrollment, but it is falling behind in achieving net enrollment in junior secondary education. In \nrelation to the third MDG on gender equality, Indonesia is on track to achieve gender equality in \neducation.  The  gender  gaps  in  terms  of  net  enrollment  rates  in  primary  and  lower  secondary \neducation  have  already  been  closed.  Measured  in  terms  of  labor  market  participation  in  the \nnonagricultural  sector  and  seats  in  parliament,  however,  female  participation  continues  to  lag \nbehind  that  of  men.  Indonesia  is  also  on  track  to  achieve  the  MDG  target  of  reducing  the \nunder-5  mortality  rate  by  two  thirds  by  2015,  but  progress  in  reducing  the  maternal  mortality \nratio has not been sufficient to meet the levels targeted in the MDGs. While the country remains \non  track  for  achieving  the  targets  for  improved  drinking  water,  it  is  off  track  with  regard  to \nattaining the target on access to improved sanitation facilities. The country is severely off track \nin achieving the targets of reversing forestry loss. In most of the MDG-related indicators, sharp \nregional  and  socioeconomic  differentials  remain  and  progress  in  many  instances  remains  less \nthan has been achieved by the relatively more advanced regional economies. ADB\u2019s proposed \nPoverty Reduction and MDG Acceleration Program will help Indonesia meet these challenges. \n \n\nTable 2:  MDGs: Indonesia and Comparator Countries (selected indicators) \n\nPrevalence \nof \nMalnutrition \n(% under \nage 5 \nunder- \nweight)  \n2005  \n28 \n45.2 \n40.0 \n\nGoal 1 \n\nGoal 2 \n\nEradicate extreme \npoverty \n\nUniversal primary \neducation \n\nPoverty \n($1/day \nheadcount \nratio, %) \n\nPrimary \nEnrollment \nRatio (net \n%) \n\nPrimary \nComplet\nion Rate \n(%) \n\nGoal 3 \n\nGender \nequality \n\nGirl-Boy \nRatio in \nPrimary \nSchools, \n(%) \n\nGoal 4 \nReduce \nchild \nmortality \n\nUnder-5 \nChild \nMortality \n(per \n1,000) \n\nGoal 5 \nImprove \nmaternal \nhealth \n\nGoal 7 \n\nEnsure environmental \nsustainability \n\nMaternal \nMortality \nRatio (per \n100,000 \nlive \nbirths) \n\nAccess to \nImproved \nWater \nSource, \n(% rural \npop.) \n\nAccess to \nImproved \nSanitation \nFacilities \n(% rural \npop.) \n\n2004  \n89.0 \n63.0 \n63.0 \n\n2006  \n8.5 \n18.5 \n28.8 \n\n2006  \n94.8\n98.9 \n83.6 \n\n2005  \n96.0 \n92.0 \n88.0 \n\nEconomy \nIndonesia \nCambodia \nLao \nPeople\u2019s \nDemocratic \nMalaysia \nPhilippines \nThailand \nViet Nam \nNote:  Year listed refers to Indonesia, for all other countries it indicates the most recent year available.  \nSources: ADB. 2007.

Indonesia  has  made  significant  progress  in  improving  governance  since  the  crisis,  and \nparticularly  over  the  last  2\u20133  years.  Legal  reforms  on  elections  and  decentralization  have \nresulted  in  greater  transparency  and  political  accountability.  There  is  open  public  debate  on  a \nwide range of issues including, among others, the Government\u2019s performance, quality of public \nadministration,  corruption,  and  government  support  to  the  private  sector.  Noteworthy  also  has \nbeen the Government\u2019s openness and commitment to fighting corruption. The country\u2019s recent \nexperience  with  democracy  has  led  to  a  range  of  institutions  dealing  with  accountability  and \noversight.  All  line  ministries  have  inspectorate  generals  who  are  entrusted  with  internal  audit \nfunctions. The government-wide internal auditor BPKP reports to the President. The State Audit \nAgency (BPK) is the external auditor and supreme audit institution, reporting to Parliament. The \ncountry  has  also  established  and  strengthened  a  range  of  independent  oversight  and  judicial \ninstitutions,  such  as  the  Anti-Corruption  Commission  (KPK),  the  Anticorruption  Court,  the \nJudicial  Commission,  the  Police  Commission,  and  the  Prosecutorial  Commission.  The  KPK, \nwhich  has  a  strong  mandate  to  fight  corruption  through  prevention  and  law  enforcement,  has \nachieved notable success since it became operational in early 2004, and it is the main vehicle \nfor the President\u2019s anticorruption drive. ADB has provided significant support to strengthen the \ncapacity  and  role  of  the  KPK  and  such  other  independent  institutions  as  the  Financial \nTransactions Analysis and Tracking Center and the Attorney General\u2019s Office. \n \nNotwithstanding  these  developments,  considerably  more  needs  to  be  done.    While  the \n11. \nPresident  has  taken  anticorruption seriously,  there  has  been  no  effective  bridge  to  reduce  the \nsignificant disconnect between the new vision and the old way of doing business in most of the \nline  ministries  and  other  public  sector  agencies.  An  anticorruption  package  (RAN-PK)  was \nadopted  through  Presidential  Instruction  No.  5/2005  in  February  2005,  soon  after  the  new \nGovernment  took  over.  With  more  than  100  action  plans,  the  package  was  meant  to \ninstitutionalize preventive measures against corruption. The package is to be updated annually \nto include the latest anticorruption initiatives. In September 2006, an updated version of RAN-\nPK was published, introducing new action plans to improve service delivery, reform the budget \nsystem, and improve tax services. An elaborate monitoring and evaluation system to track the \nprogress  of  government  agencies  towards  fulfilling  targets  set  out  in  RAN-PK  has  also  been \ncreated.  Implementation  of  Presidential  Instruction  No.  5  has  been  slow,  however,  and \nparticularly at the decentralized level. \n\nB. \n\nProgram Structure and the Government\u2019s Strategy \n\nThe  DPSP  supports  the  development  policy  agenda  of  the  Development  Policy  Loan \n12. \n(DPL)  series  prepared  by  a  joint  team  of  the  Government  of  Indonesia,  the  World  Bank,  the \nGovernment  of  Japan,  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). 3  Building  on  the  support \nprovided by DPSP-2 (approved in December 2006), the proposed DPSP-3 will provide parallel \nfourth \ncofinancing  support \nDevelopment  Policy  Loan  (DPL-4),  which  is  the  fourth  in  a  program  of  four  annual,  single-\ntranche  loans  to  support  high  level  macroeconomic  and  crosscutting  sector  reforms  to \naccelerate  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  DPL  series  aims  to  help  the \nGovernment achieve its medium-term growth and poverty reduction objectives through four core \npolicy  areas:  (i)  supporting  macroeconomic  stability  and  creditworthiness,  (ii)  improved \n\nimplement  reforms  under \n\nthe  Government \n\nto  help \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n3  As ADB did not participate in DPL-1, a different title\u2014DPSP\u2014has been adopted for ADB\u2019s operations. Thus, the \nequivalence  is  as  follows:  DPL-1  =  ADB\u2019s  participation  through  policy  dialogue;  DPL-2  =  DPSP-1;  DPL-3  = \nDPSP-2; and DPL-4 = DPSP-3. The proposed program is in line with ADB\u2019s CSP 2006\u20132009 for Indonesia, which \nsupports continued cofinancing of the DPLs. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ninvestment  climate,  (iii)  improved  public  financial  management  and  anticorruption,  and  (iv) \nimproved public service delivery to the poor.   \n \n13. \nThe Government\u2019s Medium-Term National Development Plan, or RPJM, aims to achieve \npeace and security, justice and democracy, while advancing the welfare of the people within the \ntime  frame  of  2004\u20132009.  The  RPJM  includes  the  main  tenets  of  a  previous  draft  national \npoverty  reduction  strategy  and  incorporates  the  eight  MDGs  that  provide  an  overarching \nframework placing human development and poverty reduction at the center of the development \nagenda. The RPJM has set a number of social targets, some of which are more ambitious than \nthe  MDGs.  For  example,  it  aims  to  halve  the  2004  national  poverty  rate  of  16.6%  to  8.2%  by \n2009. The Government\u2019s annual work plan (RKP), approved each year by the Cabinet, guides \nRPJM  implementation.  The  RKPs  set  out  annual  development  priorities,  including  quantitative \ntargets  and  policy  directions,  which  in  turn  determine  the  budgetary  allocations.4 The  RKP  for \n2007  has  nine  priority  areas  to  address  the  overall  theme  of  \u201cIncreasing  Employment \nOpportunities  and  Reducing  Poverty\u201d  (Figure  1).  Of  these,  the  first,  second,  fourth,  fifth,  and \neighth priority areas relate to the four core policy areas of DPSP-3, respectively. This linkage is \nelaborated further in Section III. \n \n14. \nThe  RKP  for  2008  indicates  that  the  overall  development  theme  for  next  year  is \n\u201cAccelerated Economic Growth for Job Creation and Poverty Reduction.\u201d To address this overall \ntheme,  the  RKP  for  2008  has  the  following  eight  priority  areas:  (i)  increasing  investment, \nexports,  and  job  opportunities;  (ii)  revitalizing  agriculture,  fisheries,  forestry,  and  rural \ndevelopment;  (iii)  accelerating  development  of  infrastructure  and  improvement  of  energy \nmanagement; (iv) improving access and quality of education and health services; (v) improving \nthe  effectiveness  of  poverty  reduction  measures;  (vi)  corruption  eradication  and  accelerated \nbureaucratic  reform;  (vii)  strengthening  defense  capabilities  and  improving  domestic  security; \nand (viii) disaster response, disaster risk reduction, and improvement of avian influenza control.    \n \nTo  help  implement  the  RKP  priorities,  there  are  several  policy  packages  from  which \n15. \nspecific measures are derived to be achieved within a defined period. The June 2007 package \non  Policies  to  Accelerate  Development  and  Empower  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises \n(Presidential  Instruction  No.  6/2007)  builds  on  last  year\u2019s  set  of  policy  packages  on \ninfrastructure,  investment  climate,  the  financial  sector,  and  small  and  medium  enterprises \n(SMEs). Through these policy packages, the Government has demonstrated a clear willingness \nto deal with a number of complex, and in some cases politically sensitive, issues that have been \non hold for some time. Each policy package has time-bound actions and stipulates a minister to \nbe  responsible  for  each  item.  ADB  has  provided  advice  that  underpins  some  of  the  actions  in \nthese policy packages and has supported the monitoring of progress on implementation.   \n\n                                                 \n4  In an apparent recognition of the difficulty of attaining  the poverty target, the 2008 RKP sets a target of reducing \n\nthe poverty rate to 15\u201316% in 2008 from 16.7% in March 2007. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nFigure 1: Links between RPJM, RKP, and the DPSP cluster \n\nRPJM\nMedium-term Strategy \n(3 objectives addressing 33 policy areas) \n \nObjective 2\nA just and democratic \nIndonesia \n\nObjective 3\nA prosperous \nIndonesia \n\nObjective 1 \nA safe and peaceful \nIndonesia \n\nRKP\nAnnual Work Plan \n(9 priority areas in 2007)\n\nPriority 1 \nReduction of \npoverty and \ndisparities \n\nPriority 2 \nEmployment \nopportunities, \ninvestment, and \nexports \n\nPriority 3\nRevitalizing \nagriculture \nand rural \ndevelopment \n\nPriority 4\nImproving access \nand quality of \neducation and \nhealth services \n\nPriority 5 \nEradication of \ncorruption, civil \nservice reform, and \nlaw enforcement \n\nPriority 6\nStrengthening \ndefense, security \nand order, and \nconflict resolution \n\nPriority 7\nDisaster mitigation \nand reconstructing \nAceh, Nias, and \nCentral \nJava/Yogyakarta \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nPriority 8 \n \nAccelerating \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment \n\n \n \n\nPriority 9\nDeveloping border \nareas and remote \nisolated areas \n\n7 \n\nN\na\n\nt\ni\n\no\nn\na\n\nl\n \n\nS\n\nt\nr\na\nt\ne\ng\ny\n \nf\no\nr\n \n\nP\no\nv\ne\nr\nt\ny\n \nR\ne\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n\nS\nP\nN\nK\n\n \n\nDPSP  =  Development  Policy  Support  Program,  RKP = Rencana  Kerja  Pemerintah  (Government\u2019s \nAnnual  Work  Plan),  RPJM  =  Rencana  Pembangunan  Jangka  Menengah  (Government\u2019s  Medium-\nTerm  National  Development  Plan),  SNPK  =  Strategy  Nasional  Pengentasan  Kemiskinan  (National \nStrategy for Poverty Reduction). \n \nNote: Dotted boxes denote areas supported by DPSP program.  \nSource: National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). \n\n \n\n16. \nThe  DPSP  Series,  ADB\u2019s  Other  Sector  Programs,  and  Donor  Harmonization. \nSupport  for  the  RPJM  through  parallel  cofinancing  of  the  DPL  series  is  a  key  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s \ncountry strategy and program (CSP) for 2006\u20132009. Under the CSP, a dual-track approach is \nadopted  to  ensure  that  the  high-level  macroeconomic  and  governance  reforms  supported \nthrough the policy dialogue of the DPL series complement, and are reinforced by, ADB\u2019s sector \nprograms. Figure 2 presents the approach, which involves structuring ADB\u2019s support through (i) \nparticipation  in  the  DPLs  to  strengthen  the  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  framework  while \naddressing  crosscutting  concerns;  and  (ii)  sector-specific  policy  interventions  in  the  areas  of \n\n \n\n \n\n\fInfrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  have  helped  reduce \n\ninfrastructure, financial deepening, local government finance and public financial management, \nand poverty reduction and accelerated progress towards the MDGs. ADB\u2019s dual-track approach \naims to harmonize and align  development partner  strategies with  Indonesia\u2019s country  strategy \nand  priorities.  The  participation  of  ADB  and  the  Government  of  Japan  in  the  World  Bank \ncoordinated  DPL  series,  and  the  participation of  the  Government  of  Japan  and  World  Bank  in \nADB\u2019s \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  transaction  costs  of  policy  dialogue  with  three  of  the  country\u2019s  most  important \ndevelopment partners. Moreover, development partner harmonization around the Government\u2019s \nown  programs  has  bolstered  country  ownership  of  the  reform  process  and  helped change  the \nnature  of  the  relationship  with  the  three  development  partners  to  one  of  reliable  collaboration. \nADB\u2019s active participation in the policy discussions in all areas of the DPL and the parallel policy \ndialogue  on  sector  reforms  have  been  particularly  appreciated  by  the  Government,  as  these \nhave helped in setting the overall macroeconomic framework for sector-level reforms supported \nby  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in  these  policy  discussions  and  its  strength  in  the  areas  of \ninfrastructure,  financial  sector,  decentralization,  and  support  for  achieving  MDGs  have  helped \navoid duplication of effort and improved the monitoring as well as the quality of the triggers.   \n\nC. \n\nLessons   \n\n17. \nThe proposed DPL is the fourth operation in a program of annual single-tranche loans. \nThe  rationale  at  its  inception  in  2004  was  to  support  Indonesia\u2019s  transition  from  postcrisis \nrecovery and stabilization to longer-term strategic development. Four years on, the DPL series \nhas  succeeded  in  providing  predictable  and  harmonized  budget  support  from  development \npartners. This reflects the overall good progress that has been made in  implementing reforms \nand  achieving  development  results  (see  Appendix  1  Table  A1).  In  this  context,  it  should  be \nnoted  that  while  the  financing  terms  of  ADB  and  the  other  two  development  partners  remain \nattractive,  Indonesia  can  also  access  domestic  and  international  capital  markets.  The  main \nreasons  for  involvement,  then,  are  the  reinforcement  and  policy  engagement  that  the  three \ndevelopment  partners  provide  in  the  focus  reform  areas.  The  following  broad  lessons  can  be \nderived from past and ongoing DPL operations. \n \n18. \nGovernment  Ownership.  The  effectiveness  of  the  DPL  series  has  been  greatly \nenhanced  by  strong  country  ownership.  The  DPL  reform  measures  have  been  taken  directly \nfrom the Government\u2019s policy packages and built on existing legislation. The Government does \nnot therefore regard including policy actions in the DPLs as a conditionality but rather as support \nfor an integral part of its own program. The DPL series has thus provided a means for decision \nmakers  to  operationalize  the  RPJM  by  translating  broad  objectives  into  priority  actions.  In  the \nprocess,  the  DPLs  have  helped  raise  the  profile  of  key  issues  at  ministerial  level,  accelerated \nthe  timetable  for  policy  actions  to  be  taken,  addressed  administrative  and  bureaucratic \nbottlenecks at lower levels of the Government, and provided an impetus for decision makers to \nfurther  coordinate  across  economic  and  line  ministries.  The  DPL  series  have  also  supported \nchampions within the Government to lock in and accelerate key reform measures.   \n \n19. \nSelectivity.  Experience  suggests  that  for  the  program  to  remain  effective  and \nsustainable  there  is  a  need  to  focus  on  just  a  few  and  meaningful  triggers  that  can  create \nadditional reform momentum. The DPL series has tried to address this issue by focusing only on \na subset of the Government\u2019s broader development program. It does not pretend to capture the \ntotality  of  reforms  being  implemented  in  the  core  areas  of  investment  climate,  public  financial \nmanagement,  and  public  service  delivery.  Nor  does  it  address  issues  where  the  breadth  and \ndepth  of  the  required  policy  dialogue  across  a  number  of  areas  would  indicate  that  they  be \nbetter  addressed  under  such  sector  programs  as  the  ADB  and  World  Bank  supported \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\finfrastructure reform programs and ADB\u2019s program support for financial sector deepening, local \ngovernment finance, poverty reduction and MDG acceleration.   \n \n20. \nDiversity,  Flexibility,  and  Long-Term  Engagement.  A  number  of  areas  addressed \nunder  the  DPL  series  have  had  relatively  short  reform  histories,  as  many  of  the  reforms  were \ninitiated  after  the  Asian  financial  crisis  (i.e.,  public  financial  management,  administrative \nreforms). There is a need to accept that progress in these areas involving significant structural \nand institutional reforms could be slower than in some other areas. The design of individual DPL \nprograms  has  to  some  extent  taken  this  into  account  by  enabling  a  progressive  deepening  of \nreforms.  Thereby,  each  successive  DPL  operation  has  built  upon  the  previous  one  to  ensure \nincremental  implementation.  While  this  has  led  to  advances  and  successful  outcomes  in  a \nnumber of areas (such as the consolidation of core government cash operations into a treasury \nsingle  account  and  the  phased  elimination  of  blanket  guarantees  on  deposits),  in  some \ninstances  the  reform  initiatives  have  come  up  against  a  number  of  obstacles,  ranging  from \nbureaucratic resistance to serious capacity constraints. Therefore, in formulating each new DPL \nprogram,  it  has  been  important  to  allow  for  flexibility  to  accommodate  the  evolving  country \ncircumstances and political economy. Experience has also suggested the importance of aligning \nwith  reform  champions  within  government  to  push  through  reforms,  as  well  as  the  need  to \nensure  adequate  prior  buy-in  across  line  ministries  and  agencies  where  successful  outcomes \ntypically  depend  on  active  collaboration  across  a  multiplicity  of  government  institutions.  It  also \nunderlies  the  importance  of  ensuring  continuous  policy  engagement  and  the  provision  of \ncapacity building support to underpin the reform efforts. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Support for the Government\u2019s Medium-Term National Development Plan\n\nStrategic Framework: Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM)\nOutcomes:  \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nRevive economic growth to achieve 7% average annual real GDP growth by 2009.  \nHalve poverty from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% by 2009. \nReduce unemployment by 2009 from the current levels above 10%. \nPromote good governance through combating corruption. \nEnsure peace, safety, security, justice, and democracy for all Indonesians. \n\nDPL Series (Coordinated by \nthe World Bank) \n\n \n(cid:190)  High-level macroeconomic \nand cross-sector reforms \n(cid:190)  2\u20133 strategic triggers per  \ncore policy area (CPA) \n(cid:190)  Annual program lending \n\nsupport\n\nClose seamless \ncoordination \nmoving from \nmacro-\neconomic to \nsector reforms, \nreinforced by \ncofinancing \nwhere possible \n\nSector Programs under the New \nCSP (Coordinated by ADB) \n\n \n(cid:190)  Deeper sector-specific \n\nimplementation support for policy, \ninstitutional, regulatory reforms  \n\n(cid:190)  Each program designed as a \ncluster, with subprograms \nsequenced over 18\u201324 months\n\nCPA \nStability and Creditworthiness \n\nMacroeconomic \n\n1: \n\n\u2022  Effective fiscal policy \n\u2022  Macro-level \n\nsupport \n\nfor \n\ndecentralization \n\u2022  Fiscal-monetary \ncoordination \n\u2022 Debt management\n\nCPA  2:  Improving  Investment \nClimate \n\n\u2022  Legal framework \n\u2022  Financial stability \n\u2022  Macro-level  support \n\nfiscal \nsharing) \n\nincentives, \n\n(e.g., \nrisk-\n\nCPA \nFinancial Management \n\n3: \n\nImproving  Public \n\nand \n\n\u2022  Transparency \ngovernance \nInstitutional  measures  (e.g., \ntreasury single account) \n\ngood \n\n\u2022 \n\nImproving  Public \n\n4: \nCPA \nService Delivery \n\u2022  Establishing \n\ninstitutionalizing \nlevel program evaluation \n\nand \nnational-\n\ncross-sector \n\n\u2022  Targeted \nreform \n\nDevelopment \n\nRPJM  =  Rencana  Pembangunan  Jangka \n(Government\u2019s  Medium-Term \nMenengah \nNational \nDPL= \nDevelopment  Policy  Loan;  CSP=  Country \nStrategy  and  Program;  CPA  =  Core  Policy \nArea;  MDG  =  Millennium  Development  Goal. \nSource: ADB. \n\nPlan); \n\n \n\nInfrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program \nCluster \n\u2022  Comprehensive  sector  and  cross-sector  reforms  as \n\noutlined in the Program Cluster over 2005\u20132010 \n\n\u2022  Establishment of Project Development Facility \n\u2022  Supporting infrastructure project transactions \n\nCapital Market Development Program Cluster \n\u2022  Enhanced  information  disclosure  and  improved  price \n\ndiscovery \n\n\u2022  Deeper and more liquid financial markets \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\nImproved market surveillance and investor protection \nImproved  governance  and  human  resource  capacity  in \nmarket institutions\n\nLocal  Government  Finance  and  Governance  Reform \nProgram Cluster and the State Audit Reform Program \n\u2022  Ex  ante  planning  and  budget  reforms  through  Program \n\nCluster \n\n\u2022  Streamlining fiscal decentralization \n\u2022  Local government level civil service reforms \n\u2022 \n\nImproving  public  financial  management  (ex  ante  aspects \nthrough  Program  Cluster  and  internal  control  and  audits \nthrough State Audit Reform Program) \n\nPoverty  Reduction  and  Millennium  Development  Goal \n(MDG) Acceleration Program Cluster \n\u2022 \n\nImproving  delivery  of  health,  education,  and  other \nin  a \ncommunity  services \nprogrammatic manner \n\nin  MDG-deficit  areas, \n\n\u2022  Enhancing  accountability  for  service  delivery  at  local \ngovernment  and  institutional  levels,  reinforced  by  well-\ndefined standards that are based on clear costing  \n\ntransition \n\ntowards  greater  performance-\n\n\u2022  Facilitating \norientation \n\n \n\n\f \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n21. \nThe  impact  of  DPSP-3  will  be  in  the  form  of  higher  economic  growth  that  is  sustained \nover  the  medium  term  and  accompanied  by  lower  levels  of  unemployment  and  poverty.  Its \nprincipal outcomes include (i) improved macroeconomic stability, (ii) better investment climate, \n(iii) good governance in public administration, and (iv) improved delivery of public services. \n \n22. \nThe design and monitoring framework for DPSP-3 is in Appendix 1. Appendix 2 provides \na detailed assessment of achievements under the DPL series and remaining challenges, while \nAppendix  3  presents  some  background  to  the  DPSP-3  triggers.  The  development  policy  letter \nand the policy matrix for DPSP-3 are in Appendix 4. A macroeconomic assessment letter from \nthe  International  Monetary  Fund  is  in  Appendix  5.  Appendix  6  presents  the  development \npartners  coordination  matrix,  outlining  support  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners  in \nareas related to the DPSP series. \n\nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nAt its inception in 2004, the DPL series was designed to support Indonesia\u2019s transition \n23. \nfrom postcrisis stabilization to more long-term development. The DPL was expected to provide \nthe foundation for continued, medium-term policy engagement in the areas of macroeconomic \nstability,  the  investment  climate,  and  public  financial  management  and  anticorruption.  It  also \nprovided for a flexible means of taking into account the pace and fluidity of the reform process. \nHence, as the program has evolved, the scope of the reform agenda has become broader. The \nbroadening  of  the  agenda  has  also  been  accompanied  by  a  deepening  of  reforms,  whereby \nsuccessive DPL operations have built on previous ones to ensure incremental implementation. \nReflecting the Government\u2019s success in recent years in achieving macroeconomic stability and \nattaining the macroeconomic triggers of the DPL program ahead of time, the Government and \ndevelopment partners have agreed to continue the policy dialogue on macroeconomic stability \nand,  in  view  of  the  progress  of  reforms,  to  remove  the  macroeconomic  pillar  in  the  proposed \nDPL-4/DPSP-3. At the same time, the increased fiscal space generated by the reduction in fuel \nsubsidies,  declining  debt  service  payments,  and  increasing  revenues  has  opened  up \nopportunities for a greater focus on public service delivery. Reflecting the ongoing policy focus \non  decentralized  development  and  education,  it  was  agreed  that  there  should  be  a  trigger  on \ncommunity  designed  development  and  education  under  a  new  pillar\u2014improved  delivery  of \npublic services\u2014in DPL-4/DPSP-3.   \n \n24. \nTaken  as  a  whole,  the  Government  is  on  course  to  meeting  most  of  the  expected \noutcomes of the DPL program by 2008 (some  of which having already been achieved). Table \nA1 in Appendix 1 presents the DPL Results Framework presented in the World Bank\u2019s program \ndocument for a proposed DPL-4.  \n \nThe DPSP-2 program document laid out 20 indicative triggers (prior actions) across 10 \n25. \npolicy  areas  for  DPSP-3. 5  Subsequently,  it  was  decided  to  drop  two  triggers  relating  to \ninfrastructure financing and the restructuring of local government debt as these will be covered \n\n                                                 \n5  Table  A3.2  in  Appendix  3  of  the  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the \nproposed  program  cluster  and  loan  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Second  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram (November 2006). \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nmore extensively under the ADB-supported Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \nand the World Bank\u2019s proposed Infrastructure Development  Policy Loan. DPSP-3 will also not \ninclude a trigger relating to the regulatory framework for issuing subnational government bonds, \nas this will be taken up under ADB\u2019s proposed Capital Market Development Program Cluster. In \ntotal DPSP-3 is, therefore, focusing on 17 triggers across 10 policy areas.6   \n \n26. \nIn  line  with  the  DPL  modality,  which  has  been  characterized  by  medium-term \nengagement,  strong  country  ownership,  and  continuous  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government, \ntriggers are used in a more process-oriented and flexible sense with less of a focus on condition \ncompliance. 7  On  this  basis,  satisfactory  progress  has  been  made  in  complying  with \nrequirements  of  the  triggers.  Of  the  17  triggers,  Indonesia  has  met  or  exceeded  the \nrequirements for 13.  Satisfactory progress has been made on the remaining four.  These four \ntriggers relate to passage of implementing regulations for the investment law, implementation of \ntransparent  accountability  arrangements  for  central  government  investment  funding  (RDI)  and \nregional  development  accounts  (RDA),  setting  up  of  a  national  procurement  office,  and \nintroduction  of  a  mechanism  to  reallocate  unused  community  designed  development  (CDD) \nfunds into subsequent budget. In the case of implementing regulations for the investment law, \nthe relevant decrees have been drafted and are expected to be issued before the end of 2007. \nIn the case of RDI and RDA accounts, the regulatory framework for RDA accounts is being set \nup and IT needs are being met.  These actions will be monitored in the next DPL/DPSP round. \nDelays  in  the  case  of  establishing  the  procurement  office  and  CDD  carryover  are  mainly \nprocedural,  requiring  the  signature  of  the  President  for  the  former,  and  the  issuance  of  a \nministerial regulation for the latter. Both these actions are expected to occur before the end of \n2007.  \n \n\n1. \n\nCore Policy Area I: Improved Investment Climate \n\nIndonesia  invested  the  equivalent  of  over  30%  of  its  GDP  prior  to  the  crisis.  This  has \n27. \nsince  averaged  around  19\u201324%.  Such  low  levels  of  investment  have  impeded  Indonesia  from \ncompeting  effectively  with  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Vietnam,  which  benefit  from \nconsiderably higher investment-GDP ratios. Weaknesses in the investment climate were clearly \nidentified  at  the  outset  of  the  current  administration.  The  Indonesian  Chamber  of  Commerce \nprovided  a  road  map  for  improving  the  business  environment,  and  the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners outlined five high priority policy areas, including (i) taxation, (ii) customs \nclearance  and  tariff  system,  (iii)  labor  regulation,  (iv)  infrastructure,  and  (v)  investment  policy \nand  SME  promotion.  Although  businesses  continue  to  face  significant  constraints,  there  has \nbeen steady progress. The gross investment rate rose from 19% of GDP immediately after the \ncrisis to 23.5% in 2005 before declining to 22.6% in 2006 due to high interest rates and inflation \nprevailing at that time. Inflow of foreign direct investment increased from $1.9 billion in 2004 to \n$8.3 billion in 2005 and was $7.5 in 2006. Both gross investment and foreign direct investment \nare  projected  to  come  in  at  considerably  higher  levels  in  2007.  Business  confidence  has \nstrengthened  over  the  past  few  years,  with  the  rupiah  among  the  top  six  best-performing \ncurrencies tracked by Bloomberg.  \n \n\n                                                 \n6  The following section on triggers should be read along with the background information presented in Appendix 3 on \n\nthe DPSP-3 triggers. \n\n7  International  experience  with  policy  based  lending  and  recent  literature  on  the  subject  suggests  that  a  focus  on \ntraditional  conditionality  could  undermine  country  ownership  and  sustainability  of  the  reform  process  (see  World \nBank. 2005. Conditionality Revisited. Washington DC, and ADB. 2007. Policy-Based Lending: Emerging Practices \nin Supporting Reforms in Developing Member Countries (draft). Manila. \n\n\fNonetheless,  Indonesia\u2019s  investment  climate  continues  to  rank  poorly  in  international \n28. \ncomparisons. Transparency International\u2019s 2007 Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Indonesia \n143rd  out  of  180  countries,  while  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business  2007  report  ranked \nIndonesia  135th  out  of  175  economies  on  ease  of  doing  business.  These  comparisons  are, \nhowever, based mainly on information from 2005 and hence do not reflect recent reforms. More \nrecent  surveys  of  businesses  perceptions  about  the  investment  climate  indicate  significant \nimprovements  between  2005  and  2007,  with  the  biggest  improvement  in  perceptions  of \nmacroeconomic  instability  and  economic  policy  uncertainty  (Figure  3).  Macroeconomic \ninstability is still viewed as the biggest obstacle, however, followed by transportation, corruption, \nelectricity,  the  legal  system  and  conflict  resolution,  tax  issues,  and  labor  issues.  To  address \nthese issues, the Government has  undertaken a good deal of planning and preparation for its \npolicy packages relating to investment reform. \n\nFigure 3:  Constraints to Investment\n(% of firms reporting constraint to be moderate to very severe) \n\n \n\n \n\nMacroeconomic Instability\nTransportation\nCorruption Local Government\nEconomic Policy Uncertainty\nCorruption Central Government\nElectricity\n\nLegal System&Conflict Resolution\n\nTax rate\nLabor skill & Education\nTax Administration\nLabor Regulation Local Government\nCost of Finance\nLabor Regulation Central Government\nLicense & Permits Local Government\nCustoms&Trade Regulation-Regional\nCustoms&Trade Regulation-National\n\nCrime\n\nLicense & Permits Central Government\nMonopoly Practices\nFinancial Access\nTelecommunication\nLand Procurement\n\n66 \n\n42\n\n53\n\n52\n\n49\n\n48\n\n43\n\n43\n\n47\n\n59\n\nend-2005\n\nmid-2007\n\n36\n\n42\n41\n\n39\n\n38\n\n39\n39\n38\n\n39\n\n38\n37\n37\n37\n37\n\n34\n35\n36\n\n35\n\n36\n\n36\n\n33\n\n32\n\n27\n\n29\n29\n29\n28\n28\n\n28\n\n23\n\n21\n21\n\n16\n\n20\n\nSource: Institute of Economic Research/Faculty of Economics of the University of Indonesia. \n2007.

Fifty-four of these items specified target \ncompletion  dates,  ranging  from  March  to  December  2006.  Forty-two  of  the  54  (or  78%)  were \ncompleted by the end of 2006 and several others reached completion in early 2007. The most \nnotable  development  is  approval  of  the  Investment  Law  in  March  2007,  the  implementing \ndecrees  of  which  are  included  as  triggers  for  DPSP-3.  Other  key  achievements  include  (i) \npassage  by  Parliament  of  revisions  to  the  draft  tax  laws  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF) \nincorporating  proposals  from  the  business  community;  (ii)  creation  of  new  investment  tax \nincentives  for  certain  sectors  and  regions  (Government  Regulation  No.  1/2007  specifies  three \ntypes of tax incentive: loss carry forward, accelerated depreciation, and investment tax credits); \n(iii) establishment of a team to evaluate draft regional regulations, leading to cancellation of 70 \nregulations;  (iv)  improvement  of  the  electronic  data  interchange  system  at  customs  to  reduce \ncustoms  clearance  time  to  30  minutes  in  the  green  lane  and  3  days  in  the  red  lane;  (v) \ncancellation  of  regional  regulations  imposing  taxes  and  fees  on  the  movement  of  goods, \n\n13 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTrigger  1:  Improve  VAT  by,  among  others,  reducing  the  time  for  VAT  refunds  through \n\ntelecommunication  towers,  and  roadside  weigh  stations;  (vi)  elimination  of  VAT  on  certain \nprimary  agricultural  commodities  to  increase  competitiveness;  and  (vii)  simplification  of \nprocedures  for  granting  visas  and  residence  permits  to  foreign  investors  and  expatriate \nemployees. \n \n30. \nLabor  reform  is  one  of  the  most  sensitive  areas  critical  to  improving  the  investment \nclimate.  Revisions  to  the  Labor  Law  13/2003  were  proposed  for  April  2006  as  part  of  the \ninvestment policy package. However, following a strong negative reaction from organized labor, \nthe  April  target  could  not  be  met.  This  represented  a  setback  for  investors,  as  the  2003  law \nsignificantly  raised  hiring  costs.  For  example,  severance  pay  rates  are  now  far  higher  than  in \nother  regional  economies,  discouraging  employers  from  hiring  new  workers  on  a  permanent \nbasis. The proposed changes would have addressed  this bias against employers  and brought \nlabor  regulations  into  line  with  those  of  such  neighboring  countries  as  Thailand  and  Malaysia. \nWhile  the  Government  has  indicated  that  there  will  be  no  comprehensive  reforms,  it  is \nnevertheless exploring various options such as linking unemployment benefits to pension funds. \n \nTriggers under Core Policy Area I. DPSP-3 supports reform measures to improve tax \n31. \nand customs administration, trade policy, and investment procedures; reduce business start-up \ntimes; strengthen small businesses; and strengthen the financial sector. \n \n32. \nimplementation of the DG Tax Regulation No. 122/2006. (Status: Exceeded) \n \nDirectorate  General  (DG)  Tax  Regulation  No.  122/2006  is  being  implemented.  Substantial \nprogress has been achieved in VAT administration. Manufacturing exporters surveyed in June \n2007  reported  that  the  average  VAT  refund  time  had  fallen  to  5.1  months  compared  with  an \naverage processing time of 12\u201318 months in 2003. During the past 12 months, the Government \nhas also settled 7,878 VAT refund claims from previous fiscal years amounting to Rp10.4 trillion. \nThis amounted to more than 99% of the backlog. The Government has signaled its intention of \nfurther reducing the processing times for VAT refund claims by stating in Presidential Instruction \nNo. 6/2007 that the maximum time to process VAT refunds for compliant (\u201cGolden\u201d) taxpayers \nwill be cut from 1 month to 7 days, for low-risk exporters from 12 months to 2 months, and for \nmedium-risk  exporters  from  12  months  to  4  months.  Issuance  of  a  DG  tax  circular  letter  on \naccelerating  the  settlement  process  for  VAT  refunds  in  July  2007  has  further  strengthened \nimplementation of Tax Regulation No 122/2006.  \n \n33. \ndetails of audit findings and a review in case of disputes after closing conference but before \ncompletion of audit. (Status: Exceeded) \n \nIn  late  2006,  the  MOF  and  the  Directorate  General  for  Taxes  issued  a  number  of  regulations \nthat  affected  tax  audit  procedures.  Ministerial  Decree  123/PMK.03/2006  revised  previous \nprovisions  related  to  tax  audit  procedures  and  taxpayer  rights.  The  decree  was  intended  to \nstrike  a  better  balance  between  the  rights  and  obligations  of  taxpayers  and  the  powers  of  tax \nofficials. The regulations allow taxpayers to appeal tax assessments or audits without having to \npay 100% of the disputed amount in advance. Taxpayers are also given the right to be present \nduring  audit  hearings  and  to  receive  copies  of  the  results.  Article  15  of  the  decree  supports \ntransparent tax audit procedures and strengthened taxpayer rights in disputing audit findings. It \nrequires the tax auditor to inform taxpayers in writing about the results of the audit and closing \nconference,  including  details  on  the  audit  findings  and  the  legal  basis  for  audit  decisions.  In \naddition,  the  DG  tax  regulation  on  desk  audit  and  field  audit  procedures  stipulates  taxpayer \n\nTrigger 2: Issue MOF Decree on tax audit procedures that allows taxpayers to request \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\n\ffor \n\nthrough \n\ntariff  setting \n\nTrigger  4:  Enhance  procedure \n\nTrigger  3:  Roll  out  a  National  Single  Window  with  online  clearance  of  merchandise. \n\nrights to bring an audit decision to\u2014and request a review by\u2014a higher level authority in case of \ndisputes.  Extended  taxpayer  rights  are  also  embedded  in  the  Tax  Law  Package  passed  by \nParliament in March 2007.   \n \n34. \n(Status: Achieved) \n \nThe  Government  has  signed  two  international  agreements  with  the  Association  of  Southeast \nAsian  Nations  (ASEAN)  to  establish  an  ASEAN  Single  Window  by  2008.  A  blueprint  for  a \nNational  Single  Window  (NSW)  was  launched  on  7  August  2007.  A  pilot  project  for  Tanjung \nPriok,  which  handles  around  60%  of  Indonesia\u2019s  trade,  is  currently  under  preparation  with  a \nlaunch  date  of  end-2007.  Thus  far,  DG  Customs  at  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  Ministry  of  Trade, \nthe Food and Drugs Supervisory Board, the Quarantine of Animals Department at the Ministry \nof  Agriculture,  and  the  Quarantine  of  Fish  Department  at  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  have \ncommitted  their  readiness  for  implementing  the  NSW  at  Tanjung  Priok.  These  five  agencies \nhandle around 70% of total import activity. A pilot for food, beverage, and drugs related products \ncommenced in early October 2007. A nationwide launch and integration into the ASEAN Single \nWindow is scheduled by end-2008. \n \n35. \nimplementing  better \nmethodology,  improved  research  capability,  and  better  information  technology.  (Status: \nAchieved) \n \nThe  technical  team  supporting  Team  Tariff  (the  interministerial  team  responsible  for  tariff \nsetting) has been reconstituted by a decree issued by the Finance Minister and its leadership, \nand coordinating functions have been transferred from MOF to the Ministry of Trade. The World \nBank is currently providing assistance to improve the capacity of the technical team. \n \n36. \nprocedures. (Status: Satisfactory) \n \nOf  the  four  implementing  regulations  to  be  issued  in  2007,  two  decrees  on  negative  lists  (the \ncriteria for negative lists and the negative list itself) were issued in July 2007. To further support \nimplementing  the  law,  a  new  investment  policy  unit  was  established  by  decree  of  the \nCoordinating Ministry of the Economy in July 2007 as a professional secretariat for the National \nTeam  on  Accelerating  Investment  and  Exports  (PEPI).  A  second  ministerial  decree  created \nthree  working  groups  under  PEPI  (each  chaired  by  a  minister)  for  policy  formulation;  policy \nimplementation;  and \ninvestment  promotion.  The  other \nimplementation  regulations  on  investment  procedures  and  one-stop  shops  will  replace  the \ncurrent  investment  approval  system  with  a  simpler  registration  system  and  will  support \nestablishing one-stop shops for business licenses. These regulations have been drafted and are \nlikely to be issued before the end of 2007. \n \n37. \nprocedures, and multiple registration requirements. (Status: Achieved) \n \nIn  September  2007,  the  Government  announced  significant  reforms  designed  to  simplify \nbusiness licenses and the time to establish a company. The Minister of Trade issued two new \ndecrees dated 4 September 2007. The first, on the business trading license, eliminates the need \nfor  an  on-site  inspection  prior  to  issuing  the  license,  reduces  the  number  of  prerequisites, \nsimplifies reporting requirements, and allows foreign businesses to hold a trading license. It also \n\nTrigger  6:  Simplify  or  eliminate  unnecessary  and/or  redundant  business  licenses, \n\nTrigger 5: Implement the Investment Law, its supporting regulations, and new operating \n\ntourism,  and \n\nintegrated \n\ntrade, \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\festablished  a  3-day  ceiling  on  the  time  to  issue  a  license  (from  the  previous  14  days).  The \nsecond decree, on business registration certification, also establishes a 3-day time limit (again \nfrom  the  existing  14  days).  On  21  September  2007,  the  Minister  of  Justice  issued  a  decree \nsimplifying  the  procedures  to  legalize  a  limited  liability  company.  The  decree  eliminated  the \nrequirement to open a bank account in the name of the new company prior to legalization. This \neffectively  removes  several  preceding  steps,  such  as  the  need  for  a  Certificate  of  Domicile \nissued by a local government official, a letter from a building manager, and a lease agreement. \nIt  also  allows  tax  registration  to  take  place  towards  the  end  of  the  business  start-up  process, \nthereby  enabling  parallel  processing  in  place  of  sequential  processing.  At  the  same  time,  the \nMinister of Justice issued a decree rescinding a previous decree that transferred the authority to \nlegalize  limited  liability  companies  from  its  central  office  to  its  provincial  offices,  resolving  a \nproblem  that  had  added  at  least  1  week  to  business  start-up  times.  The  combined  impact  of \nthese changes\u2014if fully implemented by local governments\u2014should cut business start-up times \nby potentially more than a month. \n \n38. \nTrigger 7: Issue a comprehensive SME policy package (including supporting industries) \nthat, among others, increases access to finance and implements the Warehouse Receipts Law. \n(Status: Achieved) \n \nThe SME policy package was issued as part of Presidential Instruction No. 6/2007 covering a \nnumber  of  areas  pertaining  to  SMEs.  In  particular,  it  highlights  several  actions  related  to \nimproving SMEs\u2019 access to finance. This includes recapitalizing credit guarantee firms through a \nreallocation from existing SME finance programs of line ministries, thereby reducing the credit \nrisk  borne  by  commercial  banks.  Implementing  regulations  for  the  Warehouse  Receipts  Law \nhave been issued (PP 36/2007). \n \n39. \nparticularly in state-owned banks, and continue implementation of financial sector safety net. \n(Status: Achieved) \n \nTo  promote  good  corporate  governance  in  the  banking  industry,  Bank  Indonesia  (BI)  issued \nRegulation  No.  8/4/PBI/2006  and  followed  up  with  a  circular  letter  on  30  August  2006  to  the \nmanagements  of  commercial  banks  on  Preparations  for  Implementation  of  Good  Corporate \nGovernance  Self-Assessment.  This  circular  letter  presents  guidelines  to  banks  on  corporate \ngovernance self-assessment, with self-assessment coming into effect from January 2007. The \nself-assessment  is  expected  to  help  banks  assess  their  own  compliance  with  the  principles  of \ngood corporate governance at the individual bank level and take corrective actions. A recent BI \nsurvey  concluded  that  nearly  all  banks  had  carried  out  individual  self-assessments  in \naccordance with the circular and that approximately 98% of banks in Indonesia have applied a \nminimum 50% of the good corporate governance principles, as mandated by the BI Regulation.  \n \nFurther,  steps  to  improve  governance  and  combat  money  laundering  have  been  taken  by  BI \nthrough measures for enhanced cooperation with various law enforcement agencies such as the \nIndonesian  Police,  Attorney  General,  Indonesian  Financial  Transaction  Reports  and  Analysis \nCentre,  and,  most  recently,  the  Anti-Corruption  Commission  (KPK).  BI  has  also  clarified  the \nroles  and  responsibilities  of  boards  of  commissioners  and  directors  and  addressed  areas  with \npotential  for  conflicts  of  interest.  Regulations  now  stipulate  that  key  board  committees  should \nhave  substantial  representation  of  independent  commissioners  and  that  there  is  to  be  more \ndisclosure of key developments that could affect shareholder rights. With specific reference to \nstate-owned  banks,  a  joint  decree  on  special  supervision  of  these  banks  to  improve \nperformance and corporate governance was issued in February 2007. \n\nTrigger 8: Implement good corporate governance and risk management standards, \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \nImplementation of the financial sector safety net program continues, with coverage on deposits \nhaving  been  reduced  to  Rp100  million  in  March  2007,  as  scheduled.  Concern  about  the \npossible  flight  to  safety  and  flight  to  quality  of  deposits  consequent  to  changing  the  blanket \nguarantee  scheme  to  a  limited  guarantee  scheme  proved  to  be  unfounded,  as  the  banking \nsystem seems to have gone through the transition with little impact. \n\n2. \n\nCore  Policy  Area \nAnticorruption \n\nII: \n\nImproved  Public  Financial  Management  and \n\n40. \nIndonesia  has  made  significant  progress  in  strengthening  public  financial  management \n(PFM), and its efforts have sparked a genuine momentum in the fight against corruption. Taken \nwith the RPJM agenda and overall governance reforms outlined earlier, the PFM measures are \nbeginning  to  have  an  impact  on  the  way  business  is  done  within  the  Government.  At  the \nnational  level,  the  Government  aims  to  have  a  state-of-the-art  PFM  system  in  place  by  2008, \nwith support from the World Bank through the Government Financial Management and Revenue \nAdministration  Project  (GFMRAP)  for  ex  ante  aspects  of  PFM,  and  with  ADB  support  through \nthe State Audit Reform Program for the ex post aspects focused on internal and external audits. \nPresidential  Decree  80/2003  on  procurement  set  out  the  basic  principles  of  procurement: \ntransparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and  efficiency.  It  covers  all  areas  of \nprocurement that use public funds and is supposed to cover contracting entities at all levels of \ngovernment.  Notable  progress  has  also  been  achieved  in  making  the  national  budget \ncompatible  with  the  international  standard  Government  Financial  Statistics  classification  and \nestablishing a treasury single account (TSA). These reforms are making important contributions \nto increasing efficiency and transparency while reducing corruption in PFM. \n \n41. \nHowever,  key  indicators  of  government  budget  performance  have  not  improved,  most \nimportantly the pattern of disbursement. Indonesia still makes 50% of its capital expenditures in \nthe  last  quarter  of  the  year.  For  the  last  5  years,  spending  has  started  very  slowly  and  then \naccelerated.  This  unhealthy  pattern  raises  concern.  Economic  activity  is  disrupted  by  an \nunnatural  cycle;  project  implementation  starts  late  or,  as  in  the  case  of  multiyear  projects,  is \ninterrupted at the beginning of each year. \n \n42.  With respect to tax administration, despite progress on extending the modern tax office \nsystem, the tax system is still characterized by relatively low revenue generation, poorly defined \nand  overly  complicated  taxes  (i.e.,  creating  excessive  compliance  costs),  and  poor  and \ninconsistent  enforcement  (i.e.,  creating  uncertainty  and  abuse).  In  part,  the  problem  requires \nbetter  oversight  of  tax  officials,  and  in  part  it  stems  from  a  systematic  lack  of  information  and \ncapacity  for  tax  and  customs  analysis  outside  of  the  respective  tax  and  customs  offices.  The \nlack  of  capacity  has  led  to  an  inability  to  accurately  assess  and  forecast  implications  of  the \nproposed tax and customs changes, has reduced checks and balances, and has not permitted \nbalancing taxpayer and government requirements. \n \n43. \nTriggers under Core Policy Area II. There are six triggers under this area, focused on \nstrengthening  budgeting,  controls,  and  transparency  in  financial  management;  improving \nprocurement processes and outcomes; and initiating civil service reforms. \n \n44. \nclear forward estimates for the 2008 budget. (Status: Achieved) \n \n\nTrigger 9: Implement a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) with a system of \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fTrigger 10: Continue to consolidate core government bank accounts. (Status: Achieved) \n\nThe 2008 budget submitted to Parliament in August 2007 included for the first time aggregate \nrevenue  and  expenditure  forward  estimates  based  on  macroeconomic  forecasts  (in  the  past \nbudget  submissions  were  strictly  annual).  Progress  has  also  been  demonstrated  in  moving \ntoward a policy-based budget by further integrating the planning and budgeting processes in the \n2008  budget  preparation  cycle.  This  has  resulted  in  significant  budget  reallocations  to  priority \nsectors\u2014particularly  infrastructure,  education,  and  health\u2014while  more  closely  reflecting \ngovernment  policy  priorities  as  outlined  in  the  government  work  plan  (RKP).  These \ndevelopments constitute an important step forward in implementing a full MTEF. \n \n45. \n \nZero-balance  banking  arrangements  with  commercial  banks  were  successfully  piloted  in  50 \nselected  regional  treasury  offices.  The  tender  for  administration  of  operational  accounts  to \ncommercial banks has been completed in all regions. Rollout of zero-balance arrangements to \nexpenditure  accounts  in  all  178  regional  treasury  offices  occurred  on  1  October  2007.  This \nconsolidates more than 1,000 balance-bearing treasury accounts into one balance-bearing TSA \nand  associated  zero-balance  accounts.  Revenue  accounts  are  scheduled  to  become  zero-\nbalanced  by  the  end  of  2007.  Meanwhile,  substantial  state  funds  continue  to  be  kept  in \ncommercial  banks  that  are  not  recorded  in  the  treasury  system.  Adoption  of  Government \nRegulation  (PP)  No.  36/2007  on  Cash  Management,  enacted  in  July  2007,  provides  the  legal \nbasis  for  a  census  of  all  government  accounts  and  enhances  the  power  of  the  Minister  of \nFinance  to  close  unauthorized  bank  accounts.  Identification  and  closure  of  unauthorized  bank \naccounts  is  underway  with  30  (out  of  73)  line  ministries  and  agencies  having  completed  the \nprocess by August 2007. \n \n46. \naccounts. (Status: Satisfactory) \n \nRegulation  No.  8/2007  has  been  issued,  which  prescribes  the  principles  for  improved \nmanagement  and  transparent  accountability  in  the  management  of  central  government \ninvestment funding (RDI). In addition, detailed procedures have been issued through ministerial \ndecrees  covering  a  wide  range  of  operational  matters,  such  as  execution  of  investments, \nadministration  and  supervision  of  investments,  management  of  the  Infrastructure  Guarantee \nFund,  the  minimum  service  standards  for  investment  funds,  administrative  requirements  for \nfinancial  management  of  public  service  agencies,  supervisory  boards  for  public  service \nagencies, and establishing an investment committee for the central government. However, while \nthe regulatory framework for RDI accounts has been put in place, the regulatory framework for \nregional development accounts (RDAs) is not yet complete. While the MOF has also gradually \ncomputerized records of subsidiary loan accounts (onlending), which contain amounts due from \nministries, using a modified debt management information system, accounting for RDI and RDA \naccounts continues to be manual and both banking and record keeping are currently segregated \nfrom  the  MOF  accounting  system.  Computerization  is,  however,  in  progress.  A  complete  and \nreliable listing of individual loan accounts is under preparation but has not yet been issued. \n \n47. \ndraft procurement law. (Status: Satisfactory) \n \nA  new  presidential  decree  has  been  drafted  to  establish  an  independent  NPPO  or  a \nGoods/Services  Procurement  Policy  Development  Institute  (LPKPP).  That  would  exceed  the \nexpectations  of  the  original  trigger  that  had  aimed  at  strengthening  the  existing  National \nProcurement Office in the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). The planned \n\nTrigger 12: Operationalize the National Public Procurement Office (NPPO) and issue a \n\nTrigger 11: Implement transparent accountability arrangements for RDI and RDA \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTrigger  13:  Establish  a  remuneration  commission  or  interdepartmental  team  to \n\ninstitution will report directly to the President with deputies heading three main departments for \nStrategy  and  Policy  Development,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation,  and  Information  Systems.  The \ndecree  has  been  finalized  and  endorsed  by  the  Minister  of  Planning,  Minister  of  Economic \nAffairs, Minister of State Apparatus, and Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs, and it now \nawaits the final signature of the President. The decree is set to be issued in November 2007. An \nindependent  procurement  agency  with  adequate  resources,  authorities,  and  strong  political \nbacking is likely to drive public procurement reform in the future and inject new momentum into \nsuch  critical  initiatives  as  finalization  of  a  new  procurement  law,  adoption  of  standard  bidding \ndocuments, e-procurement, and certification programs. A procurement law has been drafted but \nhas  not  been  finalized  in  part  because  there  was  no  institutional  focal  point  to  propel  the \nlawmaking process.   \n \n48. \nrecommend pay policy and pay levels for high level state officials. (Status: Achieved) \n \nA new job evaluation and grading system for high-ranking state officials has been completed by \nan interministerial team from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Administrative Reform, and the \nCivil  Service  Agency.  New  methods  for  job  evaluation,  including  new  grading  standards,  have \nbeen  developed,  and  nearly  200  job  descriptions  intended  to  cover  some  7,000  high-ranking \nstate  official  positions  have  been  prepared.  For  the  first  time  in  Indonesia,  an  appropriate  pay \ngrade structure has been developed for state officials based on a comprehensive assessment of \nrelevant  job  factors  in  a  coherent  structure  of  comparative  job  grades.  However,  the  plans  to \nestablish  an  independent  pay  commission  have  been  abandoned  due  to  the  administrative \ndifficulties and lengthy procedures implied in such an establishment. Instead, and to keep up the \nreform  pace,  a  different  and  possibly  more  ad  hoc  structure  (e.g.,  an  interministerial  team) \nwould be established to oversee implementing the new grading system and pay scales. \n \n49. \nFinance as a pilot for civil service reforms on a larger scale. (Status: Achieved) \n \nMOF  is  implementing  a  comprehensive  strategy  of  reforms  related  to  business  process  and \nhuman  resource  management,  including  remuneration,  service  standards,  and  internal  ethics. \nThe reforms, targeting the whole ministry including DG Customs and DG Tax, are coordinated \nby  a  high-level  reform  team  that  reports  to  the  Secretary  General.  Specifically,  the  following \nareas are addressed:  \n\nTrigger  14:  Develop  a  comprehensive  civil  service  reform  plan  for  the  Ministry  of \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nstrengthening  the  human  resource  management  capacity  of  the  Secretary \nGeneral\u2019s office;  \nsystematic  review  of  business  processes  in  every  department  to  ensure  more \neffective service delivery based on new standard operating procedures, including \nworkload analysis;  \nimproved  overall  human  resource  management  in  the  Ministry  through  (a) \nreformed job classification for every department, including new job descriptions; \n(b)  establishment  of  a  Personnel \nInformation  Management  System;  (c) \nestablishment of an assessment center; (d) formulation of new guidelines for staff \nrecruitment; and (e) a new approach to career paths for the various departments; \nand  \ncreation  of  a  remuneration  scheme  based  on  new  job  evaluations  and  pay \ngrades to link pay to responsibilities, complexity, and workload. In the absence of \na national civil service reform effort, a working group consisting of the Supreme \nCourt,  Supreme  Audit  Board,  State  Ministry  of  Administrative  Reform,  and  KPK \nare considering how to roll out the MOF pilot more widely. \n\n19 \n\n \n\n\f3. \n\nCore Policy Area III: Improved Delivery of Public Services \n\n50. \nAs  noted  earlier,  large  numbers  of  poor  remain  vulnerable,  while  education  and  health \noutcomes are not at desired levels. In the context of increased availability of public resources, \nthe  challenges  in  delivering  such  services  include  how  to  (i)  improve  efficiency  of  public \nspending, (ii) improve services quality, and (iii) reduce inequalities in access and outcomes. \n \n51. \nThe  Government  remains  committed  to  improving  public  service  delivery.  This  is \nexemplified by the decision it took in 2005 to reallocate savings from the fuel subsidy reductions \nin  favor  of  programs  targeting  the  poor.  While  monitoring  the  effectiveness  of  these  various \ncompensation  programs  has  led  to  improvements  in  their  design  and  better  beneficiary \ntargeting, lessons learnt have also been used to improve the design of such new programs as \nan individual conditional cash transfer (CCT) program and a community-based alternative that \nwill  together  cover  close  to  one  million  households.  The  CCT  program  is  modeled  on  similar \nsuccessful  programs  in  other  countries,  notably  in  Latin  America,  and  is  intended  to  improve \nhealth and education outcomes. In addition to piloting CCTs, the Government has also built on \nIndonesia\u2019s extensive experience with community-driven development projects by introducing a \nNational Community Empowerment Program (PNPM). This program focuses on improving local \ngovernance and service delivery at the sub-district and village level by encouraging participatory \nplanning  and  providing  block  grants.    Funds  are  generally  used  for  rural  infrastructure,  or \neducation- and health-related projects.  Set up to be implemented in 2,000 subdistricts in 2007, \nthe  program  will  be  expanded  to  cover  the  entire  country  by  2009.  Detailed  design  of  the  two \napproaches  is  currently  underway  and  a  communications  strategy  and  social  mobilization \nstrategy will assist in ensuring household beneficiaries understand the programs and expected \nresults. Plans also include participatory monitoring and complaints resolution mechanisms.   \n \n52. \nTriggers under Core Policy Area III. There are three triggers under this area consisting \nof  institutionalized  assessments  of  service  delivery  mechanisms,  competency  standards  for \nteacher certification, and community spending over multiyear periods.   \n \n53. \nprograms. (Status: Achieved) \n \nGuidelines are being prepared for BAPPENAS to develop an enhanced assessment framework \nfor selected service delivery programs with assistance from the World Bank. In addition, a new \nposition of Deputy, Monitoring and Evaluation is being created in BAPPENAS. Other initiatives \nin  this  area  include  technical  assistance  from  ADB  that  supports  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs \nDG  for  Regional  Autonomy  in  developing  a  performance  measurement  system  for  local \ngovernments. \n \n54. \ninstruments for measuring compliance with those standards. (Status: Achieved) \n \nThe  Teacher  Law  issued  in  December  2005  requires  teachers  to  be  proficient  in  four \ncompetency domains: pedagogical, professional, personal, and social. The National Education \nStandard  Agency  has  formalized  standards  for  teachers  for  each  subject  within  the  school \ncurriculum  (Ministerial  Decree  No.  16/2007).  Ministerial  Decree  No.  18/2007  formalized  these \nstandards  for  teacher  certification  and  the  mechanism  and  instruments  for  certification.  The \nMinistry  of  National  Education  began  the  certification  process  for  approximately  190,000 \nteachers  in  July  2007.  The  Decree  is  sufficient  for  meeting  the  trigger,  but  a  government \n\nTrigger  15: Develop an enhanced assessment framework for selected service delivery \n\nTrigger  16:  Establish  competency  standards \n\nteacher  certification  and \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTrigger 17: Permit community spending over multiyear periods and clarify procurement \n\nregulation on the Teacher Law is expected to be passed in the near future and will supersede \nthe Ministerial Decree.   \n \n55. \nprocedures for national budget funded CDD programs. (Status: Satisfactory) \n \nThe Government has agreed upon a mechanism that will reallocate unspent CDD funds of one \nyear into subsequent budgets through a revised budget process.  However, a Finance Minister\u2019s \nregulation on this is still pending. The Government has clarified the rules governing procurement \nprocedures in the guidelines for the PNPM, which is due to be released in November (see also \nthe description of this trigger in Appendix 3).   \n\nC. \n\nMonitoring the Impact of DPSP-3 \n\n56. \nAs  part  of  the  policy  matrix  for  DPL-1  (prior  to  ADB\u2019s  direct  cofinancing  involvement), \noutcome indicators were introduced to highlight the expected key results of the support. These \nindicators  were  taken  mainly  from  government  planning  documents.  Additional  outcome \nindicators have been added during the past 4 years reflecting the expanded scope of the reform \nagenda and number of triggers under the DPL\u2019s core policy areas. As the original program was \nextended  by  1  year  (from  DPL-3  to  DPL-4),  the  targets  for  each  outcome  indicator  have \ncorrespondingly been updated to reflect the expected outcomes by 2008.8 These indicators are \nexpected to provide the basis for an evaluation by the World Bank and ADB of the program after \nDPL-4 (DPSP-3). Other indicators, such as the standardized Public Expenditure and Financial \nAccountability used to assess PFM, would also supplement such an evaluation.   \n\nD. \n\nTriggers for Future DPLs/DPSPs \n\n57. \nThe current DPL series ends in 2008, in line with a 1-year extension of the World Bank\u2019s \nIndonesia  country  assistance  strategy  (CAS)  time  frame.  However,  the  Government  has \nindicated strong support for continuing the DPLs in the near future. In anticipation of a continued \nDPL engagement under the next CAS (covering fiscal years 2009\u20132012), a policy program for \nfuture  operations  has  been  discussed  between  the  Government  and  development  partners.  In \ndeciding  on  the  indicative  triggers  for  the  next  DPL/DPSP  series,  there  was  agreement  that, \ngiven  the  considerable  challenges  remaining  in  the  existing  core  policy  areas  of  investment \nclimate, public financial management, and public service delivery (see Appendix 2), the triggers \nwill remain within these broad areas. However, the policy and reform focus will be shifting more \ntoward reforms designed to improve regulations, increase transparency, and deepen institutions \nas  required  to  sustain  medium-term  growth  and  social  development.  In  moving  forward,  the \nGovernment has also articulated its interest in aligning the policy matrix as closely as possible \nto the existing government reform agenda. The Government has asked ADB to support the next \nDPL series and the current CSP contains provision for such support. \n \n58.  Within this reform program, a core set of 19 policy actions were selected to anchor the \npolicy  engagement  of  a  future  DPL-5/DPSP-4  operation.9 The  selection  of  policy  actions  was \nguided  by  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  continue  the  reform  momentum  in  given  areas  and,  in \n\n                                                 \n8  The DPL program originally envisioned three single-tranche operations. However the program was extended by 1 \n\nyear to DPL-4 in line with a 1-year extension of the World Bank\u2019s country assistance strategy for Indonesia. \n\n9  ADB will only focus on 17 triggers under its next DPSP operation, as a policy action relating to operationalizing the \nFinancial  Sector  Stability  Forum  and  establishing  a  uniform  database  for  poverty  targeting  are  already  covered \nunder  the  proposed  Capital  Markets  Development  Program  Cluster  and  Poverty  Reduction  and  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals Acceleration Program. \n\n21 \n\n \n\n\fsome cases, expand into new but related areas where there was increased reform momentum. \nIn certain areas, the indicative policy actions for DPL-5/DPSP-4 deepen policy actions already \nsupported under previous DPL operations (i.e., moving beyond the National Single Window pilot \ntowards choosing the operator and moving the Treasury Single Account beyond expenditures to \nrevenues).  In  other  areas,  policy  actions  aim  to  strategically  broaden  the  focus  of  the  policy \ndialogue into new areas in response to openings in the Government\u2019s evolving agenda, such as \nby  working  with  the  Central  Statistics  Agency  to  begin  improving  targeting  of  the  poor. \nConsequently, while some areas are well-advanced and beginning to affect desired outcomes, \nothers are focused on inputs (such as action plans, laws, or organizational changes) and may \ntake longer to translate into progress on outputs and outcomes.  \n \nUnder  the  pillar  of  investment  climate,  the  economic  policy  package  (Presidential \n59. \nIn  particular, \nInstruction  No. 6/2007)  provides  a  source  of  specific  policy  measures. \nDPL-5/DPSP-4 triggers will focus on improving entry conditions for businesses by following up \non  the  Investment  Law  and  negative  investment  list,  and  improving  the  ability  of  the  private \nsector to voice concerns. Improving private sector operations will focus on actions to follow up \non  the  new  Tax  Administration  Law,  the  National  Single  Window,  and  tariff  harmonization.  In \naddition, in the next DPL/DPSP series there will be a focus on improving financial markets by \nstrengthening  the  operations  of  insurance  markets,  a  key  nonbank  market.  That  will \ncomplement  the  work  under  ADB\u2019s  proposed  Capital  Markets  Development  Program  Cluster. \nFinally, the Government attaches great importance to the economic health and vitality of small \nand medium enterprises, and the focus will be on continuing to improve their access to credit. \n \n60. \nFinancial  management  and  governance  are  becoming  ever  more  important  in  light  of \nincreased fiscal space. The next DPL will focus on actions designed to maintain momentum on \nfinancial management. In particular, this should include a focus on the Treasury Single Account \n(underpinning  the  new  budget  and  treasury  system  that  should  roll  out  in  2009),  extending \nbudgeting reforms to improving performance measures, improving the profile of disbursements \nthrough  measures  designed  to  anticipate  multiyear  spending,  and  improving  overall  feedback \nthrough support for improved accounting by the line ministries. In addition, procurement remains \na  critical  area  where  improvements  are  needed,  and  it  would  be  important  to  assist  the \ndevelopment  and  institutionalization  of  the  NPPO  while  simplifying  procedures  that  have  also \nbeen delaying disbursements. Finally, civil service reform will be furthered by extending the pilot \nat the Ministry of Finance to additional agencies.  \n \n61. \nThe next DPL/DPSP series will also continue to promote improvements in public service \ndelivery  that  are  critical  to  poverty  reduction  and  other  MDG  goals.  This  will  complement  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts under the ADB-supported Poverty Reduction and Millennium Development \nGoals Acceleration Program. Three broad areas will be considered: improving the effectiveness \nand  targeting  of  pro-poor  programs,  the  operations  of  the PNPM  program,  and  reinforcing  the \nteacher-based education reforms introduced in DPL-4.   \n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTable 3: Indicative Triggers for DPL-5 \n\n \nA.

DPSP-3  provides  parallel  cofinancing  for  the  World  Bank \nsupported DPL-4, for which the Government has requested $600 million. The Government has \nalso  requested  $200  million  from  the  Government  of  Japan  to  cofinance  the  DPL-4.  The  loan \nwill  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum; 10  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in \naccordance  with  the  draft  loan  agreement,  the  loan  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  conversion \nguidelines;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  program  loan \nagreement.  The  Government  has  made  its  own  independent  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, and it has given an undertaking that this choice was not made on \nthe basis of any advice from ADB. Responding favorably to the Government\u2019s request will signal \nADB\u2019s relevance in an emerging, confident, and well-performing middle-income country \n \n63. \nGross financing needs of the Government have increased from $11.6 billion in 2006 to \n$15.4  billion  in  2007.  This  reflects a  higher  fiscal  deficit  on  account  of  increased development \nspending  and  increased  expenditures  relating  to  natural  disasters,  as  well  as  higher  loan \namortization payments. The Government has sought $2.1 billion in program loan financing from \nADB ($900 million), Japan ($400 million), and the World Bank ($800 million). For the proposed \nDPL-4, the World Bank envisages providing a $600 million program loan on International Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development terms. ADB\u2019s proposed support is based on the strengths \nof the policy package, its development impact, the importance of the sectors covered, and the \ninvestment  needs.  Besides  the  overall  financing  needs  stemming  from  a  greater  focus  on \ndevelopment  spending,  the  Government  will  incur  cash  outlays  in  excess  of  $200  million  to \nimplement many of the institutional strengthening measures supported under DPSP-3, such as \nrolling  out  the  National  Single  Window  for  clearance  of  merchandise  and  setting  up  the \nproposed national procurement office. \n\n                                                 \n10 There will be no commitment charge for the single-tranche loan if it is declared effective and disbursed within 60 \ndays after signing of the Loan Agreement. Currently the waiver on the commitment charge of 0.50% is applicable \nto all interest periods commencing from 1 January 2007 up to and including 30 June 2008.  \n\n \n\n\fF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\nThe  Coordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  will  be \n\n64. \nthe  Executing  Agency, \ncollaborating  closely  with  MOF.  Implementation  of  the  DPL-4/DPSP-3  actions  is  coordinated \nwith  a  number  of  other  ministries  and  agencies,  including  BAPPENAS,  Ministry  of  Trade, \nMinistry of Cooperatives and SMEs, and BI.   \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n65. \nThe program implementation period for DPSP-3 is from January to December 2007. The \nGovernment  and  the  development  partners  will  prepare  a  program  completion  report  by  mid-\n2008.  \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n\n66. \nThe program loan of $200 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties \nand  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  the  items \nspecified  in  the  negative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  7)  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources. \nfor  simplifying \ndisbursement  of  program  loans,11 the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  the \nRepublic of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required if \nduring each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed the value of Indonesia\u2019s total \nimports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required.  \n\nIn  accordance  with  ADB  provisions \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption   \n\n67. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government.  Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Program.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Program.    In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB in connection \nwith the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program.  In addition, DPSP-3 has a core focus on \nimproving  governance  and  anticorruption.  It  promotes  transparency  in  PFM.  Noteworthy \nprogress has been achieved through the TSA system and in the implementation of transparent \naccountability arrangements for RDI and RDA accounts, which will help the Government in its \nanticorruption  efforts.  The  programs\u2019  focus  on  tax  audit  procedures,  simplifying  and/or \neliminating  unnecessary  business  licenses,  and  implementing  good  corporate  governance  in \nstate-owned  banks  will  also  further  the  Government\u2019s  anticorruption  agenda  and  improve  the \ninvestment climate. \n \nThe Government places significant emphasis on strengthening internal control systems \n68. \nand  overall  PFM,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank  through  the  GFMRAP  and  from  ADB \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n25 \n\n \n\n\fthrough  the  State  Audit  Reform  Sector  Development  Program.  Reforms  and  capacity  building \ninitiatives  supported  under  both  these  programs  have  led  to  initial  progress  in  strengthening \nPFM (see the fiduciary assessment presented in Appendix 8). \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n69. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal applications. Prior to withdrawal, the Government \nwill nominate a deposit account at BI to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be managed, \noperated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n\n6. \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\n70. \nThe Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs, MOF, and BAPPENAS will continuously \nmonitor  implementation  of  the  DPL-related  reforms  and  their  impacts,  in  line  with  the  overall \nprogram  framework  and  outcome  indicators  agreed  upon  with  the  Government.  An  overall \nevaluation of the program cluster will take place in 2008. \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Impacts \n\n71. \n\nThe key benefits expected from implementation of the DPSP cluster are \n(i) \n\nprogress in meeting the Government\u2019s medium-term objectives through improved \n(a) investment climate, (b) public financial management and governance, and (c) \nservice delivery to the poor; \nraising the profile of key issues at the ministerial level, accelerating the timetable \nfor  policy  actions  to  be  taken,  addressing  administrative  and  bureaucratic \nbottlenecks,  and  providing  an  impetus  for  decision  makers  to  further  coordinate \nacross economic and line ministries; \nsustained  ADB  engagement  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  the \ndirection  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic,  structural,  and \ninstitutional  reform  agenda  (with  DPSP-3  providing  for  policy  continuity  and \nconsistency in sectors where ADB has been actively involved); \naid harmonization and cofinancing by the key development partners (ADB, World \nBank,  and  Government  of  Japan)  around  a  common  policy  framework  and \ndialogue,  and  the  resulting  endorsement  of  the  Government\u2019s  sound  policy \nimplementation and macroeconomic management; and \nfacilitation,  through  crosscutting  reforms,  of  sector-specific  reforms  in  areas \nwhere ADB is providing or planning support. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n72. \nInstitutional.  Significant  benefits  stem  from  the  engagement  of  Indonesia\u2019s  three \nprincipal development partners. Participation in the DPL series has helped in overall institutional \ncoordination  amongst  the  partners  as  well  as  between  the  Government  and  the  partners. \nProvision  of  advisory  support  through  technical  assistance  has  also  been  significantly \nstreamlined  and  coordinated  to  best  meet  the  Government\u2019s  needs.  The  measures  supported \nunder the DPSP cluster will result in sustained institutional capacity in such key areas of policy \nformulation  as  fiscal  policy,  debt  and  treasury  management,  and  public  expenditure  and \nfinancial management. \n \nSocial. The main contribution of support being leveraged through DPSPs is in the forms \n73. \nof improved public administration, sustaining effective public expenditure reorientation towards \nproductive  needs,  and  continuously  supporting  government  measures  to  effectively  align  its \n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fresources  with  its  medium-term  objectives  of  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  By \nfocusing on supporting strategic reforms aimed at improving public service delivery, the program \nwill have direct beneficial social impact. Appendix 9 presents a summary poverty reduction and \nsocial impact mitigation strategy. \n \n74. \nEconomic. The nature of the DPSP series does not allow for quantitative financial and \neconomic  analysis.  However,  significant  general  economic  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  entire \ncountry from the policy initiatives within the three core areas under the present phase. \n \n75. \nResettlement,  Indigenous  People,  and  Environment. Implementation of the DPSP-3 \nmeasures will cause no direct or indirect involuntary resettlement, nor will it lead to any issues \naffecting  indigenous  peoples.  Based  on  desk  review,  the  measures  supported  under  DPSP-3 \nare unlikely to have any adverse environmental impacts. \n\nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n76. \n\nImplementation of the DPSP cluster is subject to the following risks: \n(i) \n\nExternal  vulnerabilities.  With  its  increased  integration  into  global  capital \nmarkets,  Indonesia  remains  vulnerable  to  such  external  shocks  as  capital \naccount  shocks  or  a  global  economic  slowdown.  With  improvements  in  its \nmacroeconomic indicators, however, the economy\u2019s resilience to external shocks \nhas  increased.  Factors  limiting  the  potential  impacts  of  external  shocks  include \ndiversity  of  exports,  limited  external  debt  exposure,  and  an  adequate  level  of \nreserves. While significant subsidies continue in fuel and electricity, by more than \ndoubling  domestic  fuel  prices  in  2005,  Indonesia  has  significantly  reduced  its \nvulnerability  to  volatile  global  petroleum  prices.  The  banking  sector  is  also  now \nsufficiently strong to weather a moderate external shock. The maintenance of a \nfinancial  sector  safety  net  supported  by  the  DPL/DPSP  program  will  help  to \nimprove the resilience of the banking sector. \nPolicy  coordination  risks. Economic volatility could worsen if the Government \ndoes  not  sustain  the  reform  momentum  to  follow  up  on  the  reduction  in  fuel \nsubsidies.  Lack  of  progress  in  structural  reforms  or  investment  in  infrastructure \ncould  soon  lead  to  bottlenecks,  which  would  limit  investment  and  potential \ngrowth. However, following the volatility of the October 2005 fuel price hike, the \nneed  for  rapid  policy  adjustment  on  the  domestic  front  in  line  with  key  global \ndevelopments  is  clearly  recognized.  The  Government  and  BI  have  also \nconsiderably  enhanced  their  coordination,  which  will  be  reinforced  by  the \nmeasures under DPSP-3. \nFiduciary  constraints.  Notwithstanding  the  improvements  underway,  there  are \ncontinuing  concerns  regarding  utilization  of  public  resources.  The  overall \nfiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since  2001  (with  the  Country  Financial \nAccountability  Assessment)  have  indicated  considerable  improvements  in  the \noverall  fiduciary  environment  in  Indonesia.  Ongoing  programs  supported  by \nseveral development partners provide significant technical assistance support to \nstrengthen  fiduciary  governance.  The  DPSP  focus  on  TSA  implementation  will \nsignificantly enhance transparency. \nPublic  opposition  to  reforms.  Tariff  and  some  aspects  of  investment  climate \nreforms, such as relating to labor, are generally opposed by the public as well as \nspecial  interest  groups.  The  Government  managed  the  fuel  subsidy  reduction \nwell, but labor market reforms have slowed. DPSP allows for flexibility, enabling \nthe Government to build consensus for reforms to ensure their acceptance. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n27 \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\n \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nHeightened  security  risks.

Given  continued  sound \neconomic  management  and  progress  on  structural  reforms  on  several  fronts  since  that  time, \nmomentum has shifted and has led to improved market confidence. Despite occasional bouts of \nvolatility, the economy is now on a much stronger footing. Recent growth rates (5.6% in 2005, \n5.5% in 2006, and a projected 6.3% for 2007) are among the highest in the region. Indonesia\u2019s \ninternational credit ratings have seen dramatic improvements over the past 4 years, with S&P \nupgrading Indonesia\u2019s credit rating from CCC+ in 2003 to BB- in 2007\u2015reflecting a five notch \nimprovement in 5 years.   \n\n2. \nSmaller  budget  deficits,  along  with  steady  economic  growth,  have  also  led  to  a  rapid \ndecline  in  the  debt-GDP  ratio.  By  end-2005,  debt-to-GDP  had  dropped  to  47%  from  55%  in \n2004 and 100% in 1999. That is well below the 60% target specified in the State Finance Law. \nFor  2007,  the  debt-GDP  ratio  is  expected  to  fall  to  approximately  35%,  thus  achieving  the \nexpected  outcome  on  debt  reduction  envisioned  at  the  outset  of  the  DPL  program.  Even  with \nexpected  increases  in  public  investment  in  the  education,  health,  and  infrastructure  sectors, \nfiscal  sustainability  is  expected  to  continue,  and  the  debt-GDP  ratio  is  projected  to  fall  below \n30%  in  2010.  To  bolster  the  Government\u2019s  efforts,  the  World  Bank  and  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  are  supporting  the  development  of  debt  management  practices, \nincluding risk management, staff capacity building, and the provision of policy guidance. \n\nThe  Government  has  also  achieved  improvements  in  non-oil  and  gas  tax  revenues, \n3. \nmainly through the modernization of tax offices. While the increase in revenues over the past 4 \nyears is mostly attributable to higher oil and gas revenues, non-oil and gas revenues have also \nincreased,  from  10.4%  of  GDP  in  2003  to  a  projected  11.4%  for  2007.  The  Government\u2019s \noverriding  objective  in  its  tax  agenda  is  to  encourage  greater  and  more  predictable  revenues \nthrough  improved  compliance  and  a  broader  tax  base  while  reducing  rates  to  improve \ninvestment  sentiment.  Over  the  past  few  years,  the  Government  has  increased  taxpayer \nregistration and tax return filings by new and existing taxpayers, and it has improved recovery of \ntax  arrears  and  expanded  audit  coverage.  In  December  2004,  e-registration  of  taxpayers  was \nintroduced,  as  was  e-filing  in  January  2005.  This  was  accomplished,  in  part,  through  the \nestablishment and expansion of modern tax offices, including, in 2006 and 2007, those targeting \nmedium  and  smaller  taxpayers  that  are  now  responsible  for  by  far  the  largest  share  of \nIndonesian  taxes.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Government  Financial  Management  and  Revenue \nAdministration  Project  (GFMRAP)  is  supporting  modernization  of  these  offices,  including  the \nupgrading of facilities and IT systems, staff reorganization by function, increased remuneration, \nand  the  institution  of  a  taxpayer  bill  of  rights  and  a  tax  official  code  of  conduct.  In  2007,  the \nGovernment  continued  its  program  of  extending  modern  tax  offices  with  a  major  expansion  to \nmedium-sized tax offices and through the beginning of a reorganization of the central tax office \nto support the longer-term tax reform agenda.       \n\nDespite  progress  on  extending  the  modern  tax  office  system,  many  problems  remain. \n4. \nThe  tax  system  is  still  characterized  by  relatively  low  revenue  generation,  poorly  defined  and \noverly complicated taxes (thus creating excessive compliance costs), and poor and inconsistent \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2\n\n39\n\nenforcement (giving rise to uncertainty and abuse). In part, the problem requires better oversight \nof tax officials, and in part it stems from a systematic lack of information and capacity for tax and \ncustoms analysis outside of the respective tax and customs offices. The lack of capacity has led \nto  an  inability  to  accurately  assess  and  forecast  the  implications  of  the  proposed  tax  and \ncustoms changes, reduced checks and balances, and diminished the ability to balance taxpayer \nand  government  requirements.  As  part  of  its  second  phase  of  institutional  reorganization  in \n2006\u20132007, the Ministry of Finance established a Fiscal Policy Office. This office replaces the \nAgency for Economic and Financial Sector Research and International Cooperation, which had \nitself  become  operational  only  in  2005  with  the  aim  of  separating  fiscal  policy  formulation  and \nimplementation within the Ministry of Finance and to address the weaknesses described above.  \n\n5. \nOne  of  the  most  defining  reforms  supported  by  the  DPL/DPSP  program  was  the \ndramatic reduction in fuel subsidies under DPSP-1, which overall reduced the level of subsidies \nfrom 4% of GDP in 2004 to 2.7% in 2007. The result was a substantial reduction in regressive \nfuel subsidies, which was accompanied by a stable exchange rate, inflation, and interest rates. \nMore broadly speaking, with lower subsidies, the central and regional governments were able to \nuse  the  additional  $10  billion  a  year  in  reallocated  funds  for  social  protection  programs  that \nhelped  to  mitigate  the  social  impacts  of  the  fuel  price  hike  on  the  poor  and  to  focus  more \neffectively on human development and such other priorities as increased infrastructure. Overall, \nconsolidated  government  investment  is  estimated  to  be  close  to  precrisis  levels  as  a  share  of \nGDP in 2007.   \n\n6. \nDespite these successes, there is scope for more reduction of subsidies. While the 2005 \nfuel  price  hikes  were  a  bold  move,  Indonesia\u2019s  retail  prices  for  gasoline  and  kerosene  still \nremain well below international prices and are not market-based. The Government also faces a \ncritical  choice  on  electricity  subsidies.  The  increases  in  fuel  prices  have  raised  the  subsidies \nrequired by Indonesia\u2019s state-owned electricity company as they pass into production costs. In \n2006,  the  central  government  spent  Rp35  trillion  ($3.8  billion)  for  electricity  subsidies,  which \nhave been increasing significantly after the fuel price hikes and result in an additional subsidy of \nRp20  trillion.  As  was  the  case  of  fuel  subsidies,  those  for  electricity  distort  consumer  and \nproducer  incentives  and  constrain  higher  value  spending.  Most  of  the  electricity  subsidy  is \nabsorbed  through  a  regressive  subsidy  to  consumers  (66%),  followed  by  industry  (29%),  and \nbusiness  (5%)  in  2006.  Reducing  inefficient  spending  with  due  consideration  for  growth \noutcomes  and  the  impact  on  the  poor  will  continue  to  be  an  important topic  of  analytical  work \nand policy engagement between development partners and the Government.  \n\nB. \n\nThe Investment Climate \n\n7. \nAfter the crisis, investment fell from 30% to 20% of GDP. Such low levels of investment \nhave  prevented  Indonesia  from  growing  at  such  rates  as  do  People's  Republic  of  China  and \nVietnam, which benefit from high investment ratios of 45% and 32% of GDP, respectively. The \nweaknesses  in  the  investment  climate  were  clearly  identified  at  the  outset  of  the  current \nadministration,  with  the  new  Government\u2019s  medium-term  plan  detailing  the  major  constraints \nand  proposed  solutions.  In  this  context,  a  major  focus  has  been  placed  on  financial  sector \nreforms. Three economic policy packages were issued in 2006, including one on the investment \nclimate,  one  on  infrastructure,  and  one  on  financial  sector  reform.  A  comprehensive  follow-up \npackage was issued in June 2007 detailing 168 specific reform measures to be carried out over \nthe  next  12\u201318  months.  Many  of  the  key  reform  areas  spearheaded  by  the  Government  have \nbeen supported by the DPL/DPSP programs. The DPL/DPSP has been an effective instrument \nfor  promoting  interministerial  agreement  to  push  for  difficult  reforms  that  may  encounter \nbottlenecks at lower levels of the bureaucracy.   \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nIn  general,  these  reforms,  along  with  the  favorable  macroeconomic  environment \n8. \ndescribed above, have shown good results in improving the environment for investments. This \nis evident in the strong contribution by investments to economic expansion, which is projected to \naccount  for  about  one  quarter  of  total  GDP  growth  in  2007.  Business  confidence  has \nstrengthened over the past few years. The rupiah has been among the top six best-performing \ncurrencies tracked by Bloomberg this year, and the equity market is one of the best performers \nin  2007.  Business  perceptions  about  the  investment  climate  have  also  improved  significantly \nbetween 2003 and 2007.   \n\nFinancial  sector  indicators  also  show  evidence  of  solid  outcomes  in  terms  of  stability, \n9. \naccess,  and  diversification.  Capital  adequacy  ratios  remain  over  20%,  nonperforming  loans \ncontinue  to  decline,  and  Indonesian  banks  continue  to  be  among  the  most  profitable  in  the \nregion  with  net  interest  margins  of  nearly  6%.  Loan-deposit  ratios  continue  to  show  a  gradual \nincrease,  although  there  is  concern  over  sluggish  loan  growth.  The  proportion  of  state-owned \nbanks  in  the  overall  banking  system  stands  at  36%,  which  represents  a  10  percentage  point \ndecrease  since  2003  and  indicates  the  increasing  role  of  private  banks.  Bank  Mandiri\u2015the \nlargest  state-owned  bank\u2015was  removed  from  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  intensive  supervision  as  from \nSeptember  2007.  Its  nonperforming  loans  had  dropped  to  3.9%,  below  the  5%  threshold.  In \nsectoral terms, small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending has been rising rapidly. As of \nDecember  2006,  loans  to  SMEs  were  52%  of  total  loans,  compared  with  47%  in  2003,  and \nloans to SMEs had grown at nearly 16% over the year. That was higher than the 11% growth of \nnon-SME lending. The deposit insurance scheme was fully implemented in March 2007, and so \nfar without any signs of flight to quality. Minimum paid-up capital for banks has been raised and \nwill be Rp80 billion by December 2007. Thus far, Bank Indonesia (BI) has indicated most banks \nwould be able to comply with this regulation, whereby shareholders are injecting new capital. BI \nalso  indicated  that  only  a  few  small-sized  banks  would  be  unable  to  meet  the  capital \nrequirement, and mergers and acquisitions of small banks by larger banks are ongoing. \n\n10. \nIn the area of the regulatory and institutional framework for trade and investment, much \nof  the  focus  up  until  this  year  has  been  on  tax  and  customs  reforms.  Specific  actions  have \nincluded  efforts  to  restrict  the  creation  of  nuisance  and/or  economically  harmful  charges  and \nlevies,  to  challenge  tax  assessments  stemming  from  disputed  audit  findings,  and  to  speed  up \nvalue  added  tax  (VAT)  refunds  in  order  to  free  up  working  capital  for  export-oriented \nmanufacturing firms. The latter has shown recent progress, as according to manufacturing firms \nsurveyed in July 2007 the average time to obtain a VAT refund fell from 6.3 months in 2006 to \n5.1 months in 2007. The same survey revealed improved perceptions of tax administration, as \n38%  of  respondents  believed  that  tax  administration  represented  a  moderate,  severe,  or  very \nsevere constraint to doing business in 2007 while 57% of respondents had thought so in 2003.   \n\n11.  While  the  investment  law,  trade  reforms,  and  business  procedures  were  added  to \nDPSP-3  this  year,  these  have  all  benefited  from  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  make \nimprovements in these areas. According to manufacturing firms surveyed in July 2007, average \nimport  clearance  time  dropped  to  6  days  in  the  red  lane  compared  with  8  days  in  2003. \nIndicators also show an improvement in perceptions regarding customs and trade regulations as \nconstraints  to  doing  business,  that  figure  falling  from  51%  of  respondents  in  2003  to  32%  in \n2007.  Despite  improved  perceptions  and  reforms  undertaken  in  recent  years,  businesses  and \ninvestors continue to suffer from an overall poor business climate. While import clearance has \nimproved,  for  example,  30%  of  all  import  shipments  in  the  main  port  (Tanjung  Priok)  are  still \nsent through the red lane (physical inspection). This is triple the Government\u2019s target of 10% set \nout in last year\u2019s investment climate policy package.     \n\n12. \nRegarding  many  other  aspects  of  the  investment  climate,  Indonesia  also  continues  to \nrank poorly in international comparisons. The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business 2007 report ranked \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2\n\n41\n\nIndonesia  135th  out  of  175  economies  on  ease  of  doing  business,  and  IMD\u2019s  World \nCompetitiveness Yearbook ranked Indonesia 54th out of 55 countries\u2014putting it well behind the \nPhilippines,  India,  and  Thailand.  These  comparisons  are  based  mainly  on  information  from \n2005,  and  hence  they  do  not  reflect  more  recent  reforms.  Despite  progress,  businesses  in \nIndonesia still face a difficult legal and regulatory environment. Strict labor regulations continue \nto  create  a  disincentive  to  employment  expansion,  and  infrastructure  weaknesses  raise  the \ncosts and uncertainty of doing business. The Government is attempting to address this issue by \nforging partnerships with the private sector. To support Government efforts in this area, ADB is \nproviding  technical  assistance  to  strengthen  institutions  promoting  public-private  partnerships \n(PPPs) in infrastructure provision, and it is providing a loan to fund a project development facility \nthat will assist in preparing PPP projects at national and local levels for tendering to the private \nsector  on  a  transparent  and  competitive  basis.1 Businesses  also  face  a  complex  regulatory \nsystem consisting of numerous overlapping, redundant, and unnecessary licenses, each with its \nown  prerequisites,  and  often  involving  multiple  reporting  requirements  and  inspections.  The \nresult is a slow, costly business start-up process and a difficult operating environment in which \narbitrary decisions from officials create great risk and uncertainty. While President Yudhoyono \nhad committed publicly to reducing the number of days to start a business to 30 days (adopted \nas  an  outcome  indicator  for  DPSP-3),  current  Government  estimates  suggest  the  number  of \ndays remains high, at 105, although that at least is lower than the 168 days estimated in 2003. \n\nC. \n\nPublic Financial Management and Anticorruption \n\n13. \nPublic  financial  management  (PFM)  systems  in  Indonesia  were  left  essentially \nuntouched by reforms and modernization until the beginning of 2000. The systems were heavily \ncentralized,  input-based,  and  largely  reliant  on  manual  processing  of  transactions.  PFM  was \nbased  on  an  outdated  chart  of  accounts  and \nframework.  Founded  on \nrecommendations  provided  in  the  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment  and  the \nGovernment White Paper on Reform of Public Financial Management Systems\u2015both issued in \n2001\u2015there  has  been  ongoing  reform  to  modernize  the  regulatory  framework,  reorganize  the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  improve  budget  documentation,  and  streamline  the  budget  preparation \nprocess. These reforms have taken place in the context of Indonesia\u2019s massive decentralization \neffort, which has devolved up to 50% of public expenditures to lower levels of government.   \n\nregulatory \n\n14. \nThe  seminal  changes  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  on  PFM  came  with  the \napproval by Parliament of a troika of laws on State Finance, State Treasury, and State Audit in \n2003  and  2004.  A  presidential  decree  on  procurement  in  2003  set  out  the  basic  principles  of \nprocurement:  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and  efficiency.  It  covers  all \nareas of procurement that use public funds and is supposed to cover contracting entities at all \nlevels  of  government.  These  laws  provide  the  framework  for  PFM  modernization  in  line  with \ngood international practice.   \n\nThe DPL program has supported a subset of the ambitious PFM modernization agenda. \n15. \nIt  has  supported  many  of  the  implementing  regulations  to  put  in  force  the  new  legal  and \nregulatory framework. The DPL program has also helped move forward reforms to reengineer \nbusiness  process  across  the  budget  cycle,  including  to  make  the  national  budget  compatible \nwith  the  international  standard  Government  Finance  Statistics  classification,  consolidate \ngovernment  accounts  into  a  treasury  single  account  (TSA),  improve  fiscal  reporting,  and \nestablish forward-looking budgeting. The DPL has also supported institutional reforms aimed at \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Overall,  Indonesia  has  taken  impressive  steps  in  recent \nyears \nfinancial \nmanagement.  Changes  in  the  legal and  regulatory  architecture  are  now  largely  complete,  and \nthe momentum has shifted towards implementation of new financial management practices.  \n\nlegal  and  administrative \n\nfor  modern \n\nframework \n\nIn terms of budget reforms, the DPL has supported implementing regulations under the \n16. \nfinance  law  that  define  fiscal  relationships  between  various  parts  of  government.  Provision  of \nthe new regulations is ongoing. The budget classification is largely consistent with contemporary \ninternational standards. The Ministry of Finance has taken first steps in developing a medium-\nterm expenditure framework (MTEF) to guide budget policy. The 2008 budget includes for the \nfirst time a Medium-Term Budget Framework based on aggregate macro-fiscal forecasts of both \nrevenues  and  expenditures  for  two  out-years.  Nevertheless,  budget  plans  continue  to  be \nprepared  on  a  strictly  annual  basis,  and  medium-term  public  investment  needs  are  not  yet \naddressed  in  a  systematic  framework  that  reconciles  medium-term  budgetary  costs  with \naggregate resources. Integration of planning and budgeting processes\u2014a critical element in the \nmove  towards  performance-based  budgeting\u2014is  also  progressing.  Despite  this  progress, \nministries  and  agencies  still  lack  a  good  understanding  of the  objectives  of  the  work  plan  and \nthe  budget  document.  Implementation  of  a  more  performance-oriented  budget  will  take  more \ntime and a clearer strategy.  \n\n17. \nOn  budget  execution,  Indonesia  still  makes  50%  of  its  total  capital  expenditure  in  the \nfinal  quarter  of  the  year.2 For  the  past  5  years,  spending  has  always  started  slowly  and  then \naccelerated at the end of each year. This spending pattern means that project implementation is \ndisrupted  by  an  adverse  cycle.  Moreover,  underspending  on  capital  investments  constrains \nincreases in infrastructure investments. Slow and back-loaded disbursements are symptoms of \nmore  severe  challenges  that  are  encountered  at  each  stage  of  the  public  expenditure \nmanagement  cycle.  With  expanding  fiscal  space,  public  investment  is  increasing,  putting \nadditional pressure on the PFM systems. Planning and executing public investment is inherently \nmore demanding than current or mandatory expenditure. \n\n18. \nTreasury and cash management reforms have largely focused on converting operational \nbank accounts into zero-balance transit accounts and installing a treasury single account. Pilot \nruns for testing zero-balance arrangements with commercial banks have been successful. It is \nplanned to complete consolidation of all government cash balances into the TSA by end-2007. \nThe  cash-based  accounting  system  generates  timely  records  of  revenue  and  expenditure \ntransactions,  but  it  does  not  track  monthly  arrears.  Transaction  records  are  electronically \ntransmitted  to  the  Directorate  of  Accounts  at  treasury  headquarters  for  consolidation  and \ngenerating  periodic  reports  on  budget  execution.  The  cash-based  treasury  system  does  not \ntrack  payment  arrears  on  a  monthly  basis,  although  Directorate  General  Treasury\u2019s  plan  to \nmove  towards  an  accrual  recording  system  would  make  this  possible.  Treasury  cash \nmanagement  and  payment  modernization  will  be  supported  by  the  planned  computerized \nTreasury Information Management System under the World Bank GFMRAP project that is under \nimplementation. \n\n19. \nThe past few years have witnessed incremental improvements in the public procurement \nenvironment.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  provided  a  national  public  procurement \nregulation  that  corresponds  with  most  of  what  is  generally  regarded  as  accepted  international \npractice,  including  the  basic  principles  of  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy, \nand  efficiency.  This  decree  also  requires  that  a  national  procurement  policy  office  (NPPO)  be \nestablished  as  a  regulatory  body  for  public  procurement.  With  the  introduction  of  Presidential \n\n                                                 \n2  World  Bank.  2007.

Jakarta/Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2\n\n43\n\nDecree  No.  80/2003,  key  provisions  that  had  limited  competition,  such  as  certification \nprocedures  and  market  segmentation,  were  deleted.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  also \nestablished  a  basis  for  sanctions,  complaints  handling,  and  requirements  for  certification  of \nusers.  ADB  has  supported  the  Government  through  technical  assistance  to  revise  an  earlier \npresidential  decree  on  procurement  and  to  prepare  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003. \nNevertheless,  the  public  procurement  system  still  has  deficiencies  in  its  regulatory  and,  more \nimportantly,  implementation  aspects.  These  are  mainly  the  delays  in  establishing  a  strong \nregulatory  body;  slow  progress  in  developing  procurement  regulation  anchored  by  law; \nweakness  in  implementing  agencies\u2019  procurement  capacities,  and  especially  at  the  provincial \nand district levels; collusive and corrupt practices in the bidding process; and concerns over the \nefficiency of anticorruption measures and sanctions.  \n\nRegarding  budget  reporting,  the  aggregate  Government  Annual  Financial  Statements \n20. \nhave been prepared in a timely manner for 3 years now (2004, 2005, and 2006). This is a major \nachievement. These comply with the new Government Accounting Standards that are described \nby the authorities as \u201ccash towards accrual basis.\u201d The aggregate annual financial statements \npresent  revenues,  expenditures  and  transfers,  surplus  or  deficit,  and  financing  aggregates  in \ncomparison  with  budget  provisions.  A  balance  sheet  and  a  cash  flow  statement  are  also \npresented,  along  with  a  full  statement  of  government  accounting  policy.  Despite  these \nimprovements,  there  continue  to  be  serious  challenges  in  making  the  government  financial \nstatements reliable, as reported by external auditors in their annual audit report for 2006. This \nreflects the immense challenges that lay ahead in an environment where accounting capacities \nat the grassroots are weak and the accounting processes not yet integrated or fully automated.  \n\n21. \nThe Government\u2019s internal audit framework is extensive, but scope and organization do \nnot  match  needs.  The  internal  audit  function  is  carried  out  at  the  central  government  through \nthree  institutions:  Inspectorates  General  (IGs)  in  each  spending  ministry;  the  State  Financial \nControl  Agency  (BPKP),  reporting  to  the  President\u2019s  office,  with  government-wide  jurisdiction; \nand  the  Regional  Supervision  Agency  (BAWASDA)  at  each  local  government.  To  clarify  the \ninstitutional  structure,  mandates,  and  division  of  labor  between  the  various  internal  audit \ninstitutions,  ADB  is  providing  loan  support  to  bring  about  institutional  reform  and  a  changed \nmandate for BPKP, as well as capacity building support to the BAWASDAs and IGs in spending \nministries.3   \n\nD. \n\nMaking Services Work for the Poor \n\n22. \nAfter  the  economic  crisis,  Indonesia  failed  to  invest  sufficiently  in  its  economy,  and \nparticularly  in  public  service  delivery.  With  an  estimated  $10  billion  to  reallocate  from  the \nregressive  fuel  subsidies  and  an  additional  $5  billion  available  from  increased  revenues  and \ndeclining  debt  service,  the  Government  can  start  to  realize  its  ambitious  poverty  reduction \nagenda linked to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. This agenda was added on to \nthe  DPL/DPSP  umbrella  last  year  as  part  of  ongoing  donor  analytic,  diagnostic,  and  policy \nsupport  to  the  Government\u2019s  fuel  compensation  schemes.  This  year,  under  DPL-4/DPSP-3, \neducation and community-driven development were added on as new policy areas. Because of \nthe  recent  addition  of  these  policy  areas,  assessing  the  expected  improvement  in  service \ndelivery  beyond  outputs  would  be  difficult  at  this  stage.  Hence,  the  section  will  be  limited  to \nreviewing the results of the fuel compensation programs. \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2004.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia  for  the  State  Audit  Reform  Sector  Development  Program.  Manila  (Loan    2127-INO  (SF),   \napproved in December, for the equivalent of $25.0 million). \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nSince  the  fuel  price  hike,  there  has  been  an  evolving  change  in  how  social  protection \n23. \nprograms are administered, implemented, monitored, and evaluated. Prior to 2005, Indonesia\u2019s \nsocial  protection  system  was  characterized  primarily  by  (i)  crisis-era  safety  net  programs;  and \n(ii) large commodity price subsidies and transfers, particularly through fuel products. The crisis-\nera social safety net programs were temporary, short-term interventions, rather than long-term \nsocial  protection  systems  aimed  to  ensure  continued  access  for  the  poor  to  affordable  food, \nhealth, and education services. While meant to be temporary, many of these programs became \nentrenched social policy. The continued safety net programs address a diversity of issues, but \nare  low  in  coverage,  institutionally  fragmented,  and  not  managed  as  one  umbrella  system.  In \n2003, budgets allocated to the three principal targeted programs, namely subsidized rice for the \npoor, education scholarships, and health cards, totaled about Rp8.4 trillion, accounting for only \n2.2% of total government expenditure. By comparison, in 2005 about Rp103 trillion was spent \non fuel subsidies. It is estimated that about Rp5 trillion of this benefited the poorest quintile.   \n\n24. \nThe  fuel  compensation  programs  enacted  shortly  after  the  second  wave  of  fuel  price \nincreases  in  October  2005  represented  a  break  from  traditional  safety  net  programs.  The \nGovernment  opted  for  a  cash  transfer  scheme  wherein  19.2  million  households  would  receive \nRp300,000  each  quarter.  This  represented  the  largest  ever  cash  transfer  program  in  terms  of \ncoverage  and  total  volume  transferred.  The  unconditional  cash  transfer  (UCT)  program  was \ndesigned as a temporary, 1-year cash transfer program aimed at mitigating the impacts of the \nfuel  subsidy.  For  poor  recipients,  the  cash  transfer  more  than  compensated  for  the  losses \nincurred  due  to  the  fuel  price  hike.  Initial  assessments  during  the  first  tranche  noted  several \nproblems, particularly in targeting. That prompted the Government to make adjustments in the \nUCT\u2019s implementation.   \n\nLessons  learned  from  assessments  of  the  UCT  program\u2014which  was  supported  by \n25. \nDPL/DPSP\u2014have  led  to  the  piloting  of  conditional  cash  transfers  (CCT).  Conditional  cash \ntransfers  can  be  used  to  stimulate  demand  for  services  by  the  poor  and  give  them  more  of  a \nvoice  in  frontline  service  provision.  Programs  that  transfer  resources  directly  to  poor  families \nhave proved effective in several other countries at raising enrolment, attendance, and utilization \nof  health  facilities.  Community-based  approaches  that  aim  at  increasing  utilization  are  also \nrelevant in the Indonesian context. The President has announced that the Government will pilot \nboth  the  \u201cconventional\u201d  conditional  cash  transfer  to  households  and  a  community-based \nalternative starting in mid- 2007. Detailed design of the two approaches is currently underway, \nled by the National Development Planning Agency and involving the Ministries of Social Affairs, \nEducation, Health, Public Works, and Home Affairs. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n \n45\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION ON THE TRIGGERS FOR THE THIRD DEVELOPMENT \nPOLICY SUPPORT PROGRAM (DPSP-3) \n \n\nTrigger  1:  Improve  VAT  by,  among  others,  reducing  the  time  for  VAT  refunds  through \n\n1. \nimplementation of the DG Tax Regulation No. 122/2006. \n \nExports are zero-rated for value added tax (VAT). Nevertheless, exporters pay VAT on domestic \npurchases  but  do  not  collect  any  VAT  from  buyers  of  their  product.  Consequently,  they  are \nregularly owed VAT refunds by the tax department. Refunds have in the past taken a very long \ntime  to  process,  with  the  average  exporter  reporting  a  6-month  delay  between  submitting  the \nclaim  and  receiving  the  refund.  This  ties  up  a  considerable  amount  of  working  capital  and \nmakes  Indonesian  exports  less  competitive  than  exports  from  other  countries,  where  VAT \nrefunds  typically  take  less  than  1  month.  To  remedy  this,  Directorate  General  (DG)  tax \nregulation  no.  122/2006,  issued  in  August  2006,  prescribes  reduced  time  limits  for  completing \nthe approval of refund claims based on the status of the claimant. Low-risk exporters should see \ntheir  claims  approved  in  3  months,  medium-  and  high-risk  exporters  in  5  months,  and  other \nclaimants  within  13  months.  The  2007  package  on  Policies  to  Accelerate  Development  and \nEmpower Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (Presidential Instruction 6/2007) further states \nthat by July 2007 the maximum time to process VAT refunds for compliant (\"Golden\") taxpayers \nwill be cut from 1 month to 7 days, for low-risk exporters from 12 months to 2 months, and for \nmedium-risk exporters from 12 months to 4 months.   \n \n2. \n Trigger 2: Issue Ministry of Finance (MOF) Decree on tax audit procedures that allows \ntaxpayers  to  request  details  of  audit  findings  and  a  review  in  case  of  disputes  after  closing \nconference but before completion of audit. \n \nThe  Indonesian  tax  system  relies  on  self-assessment,  under  which  taxpayers  are  trusted  to \ncalculate,  pay,  and  report  their  own  taxes  in  accordance  with  prevailing  tax  laws  and \nregulations. However, the DG tax may issue tax assessment letters to a particular taxpayer if it \nfinds  that,  based  on  a  tax  audit  or  other  information,  the  taxpayer  has  not  fully  paid  its  tax \nliabilities. Further, DG tax may conduct tax audits in the taxpayer\u2019s premises for some reasons \nincluding but not limited to: a tax refund request, an annual income of tax return presenting a tax \nloss,  a  tax  return  not  filled  within  the  prescribed  time,  and  other  reasons  meeting  certain \n(undisclosed) criteria of the DG Tax. At the end of a tax audit, the tax auditors will provide the \ntaxpayer  with  a  written notification of  the  tax  audit  findings.  The  taxpayer  will  typically  have  to \nrespond to the notification in writing within 7 to 21 days. After that, a final discussion about the \ntax audit findings (Closing Conference) is to be held between the tax auditor and the taxpayer. \nPreviously, if the taxpayer disagreed with the result of a closing conference, he or she could file \nan  appeal  with  the  tax  court  within  3  months  but  would  have  to  pay  100%  of  the  disputed \namount  in  advance.  This  created  an  imbalance  between  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the \ntaxpayers and the powers of tax officials.  \n \n 3. \n \nThe  National  Single  Window  (NSW)  for  imports  and  exports  is  currently  the  most  important \ntrade facilitation initiative underway in Indonesia. Under a single window, traders (importers and \nexporters)  will  no  longer  be  required  to  apply  individually  to  multiple  government  agencies\u2014\nsuch  as  Customs,  the  Port  Authority,  the  Ministry  of  Trade,  the  Food  and  Drug  Agency,  and \nQuarantine\u2014to  clear  cargoes.  A  single  application  is  instead  submitted  using  a  single \nadministrative  document,  and  this  application  is  transmitted  to  each  relevant  agency  by  the \noperator of the Single Window.

The interministerial Team Tariff  is responsible \nfor  evaluating  Indonesia\u2019s  tariff  regime.  With  recommendations  from  the  Team,  MOF  is \nexercising its authority to change tariff rates. The Team, however, faces weak capacity. There is \na  consensus  that  the  Team\u2019s  secretariat  functions  should  be  revamped.  A  more  effective \ntechnical team should also enhance Team Tariff\u2019s performance in setting tariff policies.   \n \n5. \nprocedures. \n \nA  new  Investment  Law  was  passed  by  Parliament  in  March  2007  after  some  delay.  The  law \nprovides  equal  treatment  to  domestic  and  foreign  investors,  allows  for  longer  work  permits  for \nexpatriates, and extends the number of years for which land can be leased. It states explicitly \nthat investors are entitled to repatriate and transfer funds in foreign exchange, and that disputes \nbetween  government  and  investors  can  be  settled  through  international  arbitration.  One \nimplementing regulation for the law was issued prior to passage of the law: PP1/2007 on fiscal \nincentives  for  investment.  Four  more  implementing  regulations  are  to  be  issued  in  2007.  Of \nthese, two on the criteria for negative lists and the negative list itself were issued in July 2007. \nTwo more regulations on one-stop shops and investment procedures are pending.   \n \n6. \nprocedures, and multiple registration requirements. \n \nThe procedures to set up a business in Indonesia are among the most complex, costly, and time \nconsuming  in  Asia.  Some  progress  has  been  made,  as  the  time  to  establish  and  register  a \nlimited liability company has fallen from 168 days in 2003 to 105 in 2007. This is still well above \nregional  standards  (Malaysia  and  Thailand  require  only  30  days),  however,  and  after \nestablishing  a  company,  investors  still  must  obtain  numerous  sectoral  and  local  licenses.  The \nwhole  process  of  establishing  a  new  company  and  obtaining  all  the  required  permits  and \nlicenses  can  take  six  months  or  more,  depending  on  the  sector  and  activity.  A  presidential \ndecree in 2006 stated that the time to establish a company would be cut to 30 days. The 2007 \npackage  on  Policies  to  Accelerate  Development  and  Empower  Micro,  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprises (Presidential Instruction 6/2007) stipulates that the time to establish a company will \nbe  cut  to  25  days  by  simplifying  procedures,  switching  from  sequential  to  parallel  processing, \nand setting maximum time limits for each step.  \n \n\nTrigger  6:  Simplify  or  eliminate  unnecessary  and/or  redundant  business  licenses, \n\n                                                 \n1  World  Bank.  2004.

One of the package\u2019s main focus areas is improving access of \nmicro  enterprises  and  SMEs  to  finance,  since  they  face  significant  constraints  in  accessing \nformal  sources  of  finance  to  meet  their  working  capital  and  investment  needs.  Given  the \ncollateralized  nature  of  lending,  SMEs  often  have  difficulties  obtaining  competitive  loans  from \nbanks. In particular, movable property may not be used as collateral, as Bank Indonesia\u2019s loan \nloss  reserve  rules  prevent  the  use  of  such  assets.  As  a  result,  expanding  business  has  been \nvery  hard  for  many  Indonesian  SMEs.  Presidential  Instruction  6/2007  identifies  a  number  of \nways for micro enterprises and SMEs to improve access to finance, and one of the key areas is \nto implement the Warehouse Receipts Law that was enacted by Parliament in June 2006. The \nLaw  intends  to  establish  a  system  of  designated  warehouses  which  could  provide  official \nreceipts  for  commodities  stored  by  farmers,  growers,  and  traders.  This  is  to  provide  SMEs  in \nagribusiness and related sectors flexibility in selling their products based on market conditions. \nThe designated warehouses will provide them with certificates against goods held. The receipts \ncan  be  traded  as  derivatives,  or  used  to  settle  maturing  futures  contracts  on  a  commodities \nexchange, or as collateral to obtain bank loans. The World Bank Group is currently supporting \nthe Government in developing implementation regulations for the Law. \n \n8. \nparticularly in state-owned banks, and continue implementation of financial sector safety net.  \n \nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis in 1997, the Government introduced a blanket guarantee \non all bank liabilities to restore public confidence in the banking system and control bank runs. \nSubsequently,  as  crisis  resolution  progressed  and  the  banking  sector  strengthened,  the \nGovernment  committed  itself  to  lifting  the  blanket  guarantee  in  a  phased  manner  and \nintroducing a deposit insurance scheme that would cover deposits of up to Rp100 million. The \nParliament approved the Law on Deposit Insurance in August 2004, setting out a phased plan to \nreduce the coverage of the blanket guarantee to commence from  September 2005 as per the \nschedule presented below. The main objectives of the deposit insurance scheme are to reduce \nthe  economic  distortions  and  moral  hazard  created  by  the  blanket  guarantee  as  well  as \npotentially to try and limit the fiscal costs to the Government in the event of future difficulties in \nthe banking sector. It is also an integral part of the overall financial sector safety net being put in \nplace by the Government. Some other elements of that net include BI\u2019s role as a lender of last \nresort  and  establishment  of  institutional  processes  and  mechanisms  by  which  banks  facing \ndifficulties would be either aided by BI or their situations would be otherwise resolved. \n \n\nTrigger  8:  Implement  good  corporate  governance  and  risk  management  standards, \n\nTable A3.1: Implementation Schedule for the Deposit Insurance Scheme \n\nImplementation Phases \n22 September 2005\u201321 March 2006 \n22 March 2006\u201321 September 2006 \n22 September 2006\u201321 March 2007 \nStarting from 22 March 2007 \nSource: Government of Indonesia.

Progress  has  also  been  made  in  moving  towards  a \npolicy-based budget by further integrating the planning and budgeting processes into the 2008 \nbudget  preparation  cycle.  The  2008  budget  that  was  submitted  to  Parliament  in  August  2007 \nindicates  a  substantial  reallocation  of  expenditures  towards  priority  sectors,  and  particularly \ninfrastructure,  that  more  closely  reflect  government  policy  priorities  as  outlined  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s  work  plan.  Priority  programs  and  activities  will  also  be  specifically  marked, \nallowing the Government to monitor alignment of budget allocations to government priorities. \n \nAt  the  same  time,  MOF  has  made  progress  in  enhancing  its  macroeconomic  forecasting \ncapacity, which is a key prerequisite for implementing the MTEF. The recent reorganization of \nthe MOF, namely establishment of the Fiscal Policy Office, has strengthened its capacity to take \nthe  lead  role  in  finalizing  the  medium-term  macro-fiscal  projections.  Although  medium-term \nmacroeconomic  and  fiscal  forecasts  are  prepared  by  the  Fiscal  Policy Office,  they  are  not  yet \nused directly in the budget process and presented in the budget documents that are submitted \nto  the  House  of  Representatives.  For  2008,  MOF  is  intending  to  pilot  implementation  of \nprogrammatic MTEFs in a selected number of line ministries. Finally, to further deepen reforms \nand to increase readiness for further reforms in the 2009 budget preparation process, MOF is \nintending to formulate and publish a coherent, phased strategy for budget reform covering the \nshort, medium, and long terms. \n \n10. \naccounts. \n \nEffective  management  of  state  finances  requires  minimizing  central  government  idle  cash  and \ncash  float,  reducing  the  maintenance  costs  of  too  many  accounts,  facilitating  cash forecasting \nand  cash  management  control,  as  well  as  enhancing  the  transparency  of  central  government \nbanking. Support for establishing the treasury single account (TSA) commenced under DPSP-1 \n(DPL-2), with pilots for zero-balance transitory accounts in Batam, Bekasi, and Jakarta. This has \nsince been extended to 50 state treasury offices (KPPNs).  \n \nNevertheless, substantial state funds continue to be held in commercial bank accounts by both \nspending units and state officials. According to the State Audit Agency\u2019s 2005 audit report, this \nincludes  about  Rp8.5  trillion  in  some  1,300  current  and  savings  accounts  not  recorded  in  the \ntreasury system. These off-the-books funds not only distort the consolidated government cash \nbalance but also are highly vulnerable to embezzlement and corrupt activities. Recent adoption \nof  government  regulation  on  cash  management  will  enhance  the  powers  of  MOF  to  close \nunauthorized bank accounts and provide legal backing for a census of all government accounts. \n \n\nTrigger  10:  Continue  to  consolidate  core  government  (revenue  and  expenditure)  bank \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n \n49\n\n \n\nTrigger  12:  Fully  operationalize  the  National  Public  Procurement  Office  (NPPO)  and \n\nTrigger  11:  Implement  transparent  accountability  arrangements  for  RDI  and  RDA \n\n11. \naccounts. \n \nThe  central  government  investment  funding  (RDI)  and  regional  development  accounts  (RDA) \nare  off-budget  accounts  maintained  by  MOF  to  finance  loan  operations  to  state-owned \nenterprises  and  subnational  entities,  respectively.  As  of  December  2005,  the  total  amount \noutstanding as shown by the audited financial statements of the Government was Rp60.4 trillion \n($6.5bn),  of  which  nearly  Rp29  trillion  was  the  rupiah  equivalent  of  loans  made  in  foreign \ncurrency.  It  is  understood  that  as  at  end-2006  the  total  had  fallen  slightly  to  Rp59.2  trillion \nspread  across  1,650  loan  accounts.  Under  current  practice,  RDI  and  RDA  accounts  are \noperated  as  a  revolving  off-budget  fund.  Cash  received  by  MOF  by  way  of  repayments  of \nprincipal,  interest,  and  charges  levied  is  not  being  deposited  into  the  central  treasury  account \nbut  is  retained  in  separate  bank  accounts,  which  may  weaken  financial  accountability.  In \naddition,  administrative  and  accounting  records  for  RDI  and  RDA  transactions  have  been \nmaintained  in  a  manual  recording  system,  which  did  not  enable  appropriate  accounting  and \nfiduciary controls to be exercised, given the size, volume, and nature of the transactions \n \n12. \nissue a draft procurement law. \n \nThe Presidential Decree 80/2003 sought to establish an NPPO that was fully staffed and led by \na first echelon official with sufficient authority across all levels of government in a decentralized \nframework. Given political difficulties, an acceptable interim solution was to establish the NPPO \nas a separate entity reporting to BAPPENAS with subsequent empowerment as an independent \nentity under the proposed new procurement law. This was agreed upon last year. However, this \ndecision was reversed, and a government committee has now drafted a presidential decree to \nestablish an independent entity. The current draft decree envisages an independent NPPO with \na  first  echelon  staff  reporting  to  the  President  and  with  deputies  heading  three  main \ndepartments for Strategy and Policy Development, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Information \nSystems.  Once  this  decree  is  issued  by  the  President,  there  will  still  be  requirements  for \nstaffing, budgeting, and other support to make the NPPO fully functional. The decree represents \na  major  step  towards  having  a  fully  staffed  regulatory  body  that  can  improve  the  public \nprocurement  system  and  monitor  its  performance.  This  in  itself  is  a  huge  task,  taking  into \nconsideration the degree of centralization in the country. \n \nAlthough a procurement law has been drafted, there is ongoing discussion on the content of a \nprocurement  law.  The  existing  Presidential  Decree  80/2003  promotes  the  basic  principles  of \nprocurement:  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and  efficiency.  It  covers  all \nareas of procurement that use public funds and contracting entities at all levels of government. \nThe  decree  corresponds  with  most  of  what  is  generally  regarded  as  accepted  international \npractice. However, the pace of Indonesia\u2019s decentralization reforms has had an impact on public \nsector procurement, as different levels of government\u2014from ministers, to governors, and even \nmayors\u2014are  able  to  issue  their  own  decrees,  regulations,  and  instructions.  The  plethora  of \nregulations is often inconsistent and many of these do not correspond to accepted international \npractice.  This  is  why  there  is  a  need  for  an  overall  regulatory  framework  in  the  form  of  a \nprocurement law, which will be followed eventually with implementation decrees that would be \nused at both national and provincial levels. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTrigger 13 and 14: Initiate civil service reform. \n\nTrigger  15: Develop an enhanced assessment framework for selected service delivery \n\n13. \n \nRecently, the Government has begun to undertake a series of initiatives that constitute one of \nthe most promising openings for civil service reform in years. A key first step has been the effort \nto  design  a  new  job  classification  and  remuneration  policy  for  high-ranking  state  officials, \nincluding ministers, legislators, judges, and heads of special commissions and agencies. MOF \nhas taken leadership and set up a task force to examine the entire compensation package with \nthe  goal  of  creating  a  more  transparent,  systematic,  and  coherent  framework  of  pay  and \nallowances  based  on  a  comprehensive  job  evaluation  and  pay  grading.  The  task  force  has \nproposed  the  establishment  of  a  body  to  recommend  to  the  President  both  the  level  and \nstructure of the compensation package first for Indonesia\u2019s highest ranking political officials and, \nonce  that  is  established,  for  the  entire  civil  service.  The  body  will  also  be  tasked  with \nestablishing greater consistency and transparency of the overall remuneration package in order \nto improve governance. The body\u2019s recommendations will be based on such modern techniques \nas job evaluations and pay comparator surveys. In addition, promising civil service reform pilots \nare  being  developed  in  MOF,  which  are  being  rolled  out  more  widely  to  institutions  with \nreform-minded leadership.   \n \n14. \nprograms. \n \nThe ability to translate public spending into improved services depends, in part, on having better \ninformation  on  what  works.  It  was  for  this  reason  that  the  Government  approached  donors  to \nsupport  them  in  assessing  the  four  major  fuel  subsidy  compensation  programs  (the  1-year \nunconditional  cash  transfer  program,  health  insurance  for  the  poor,  operational  assistance  to \nschools,  and  village  infrastructure)  in  2006  (an  action  supported  by  DPSP-2/DPL-3).  Going \nforward,  the  Government  would  like  to  take  greater  ownership  and  institutionalize  the  use  of \nprogram  assessments.  To  do  so  will  require  establishing  a  multiyear  plan  with  appropriate \nbudget and capacity building measures, as well as clearly defined steps to ensure findings are \nused  to  inform  decisions  on  whether  to  expand,  modify,  or  eliminate  programs.  The \nimplementation  of  such a  plan  would  likely  lead  to  better  understanding  of  the  weaknesses  of \nvarious program monitoring information systems\u2014hopefully leading to improvements.   \n \n15. \ninstruments for measuring compliance with those standards. \n \nIndonesia has identified education as one of the most critical sectors with regard to improving \nthe  quality  of  life  of  its  citizens  and  the  attainment  of  its  Millennium  Development  Goals.  In \nDecember  2005,  with  the  passage  of  the  Teacher  Law,  the  Government  launched  a  highly \nambitious effort to upgrade the quality of its teachers. Under the new Law, all teachers will have \ntheir  basic  salaries  doubled  upon  being  certified  as  meeting  the  competency  standards \nmandated by the Law. Those in remote areas will be provided additional incentives, resulting in \na  near  tripling  of  their  basic  salaries.  The  Law  presents  an  unprecedented  opportunity  to \nenhance the quality of professional development and training provided to teachers and to create \na  culture  of  teaching  centered  on  instructional  excellence.  While  survey  data  indicate  that  the \nquality  of  teaching  in  Indonesia  compares  poorly  with  those  of  such  neighboring  countries  as \nSingapore and Malaysia, the low level of Indonesian teachers\u2019 qualification is itself of concern: \nsome 60% of Indonesia\u2019s teachers do not have the minimum qualifications required by the new \nLaw.  \n \n\nTrigger  16:  Establish  competency  standards \n\nteacher  certification  and \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n \n51\n\n \n\nTrigger 17: Permit community spending over multiyear periods and clarify procurement \n\n16. \nprocedures for national budget funded community-designed development (CDD) programs. \n \nImplementation  of  the  National  Community  Empowerment  Program  in  70,000  villages  will \ndepend  on  public  financial  management  and  procurement  procedures  that  are  suitable  at  the \nsubdistrict  level.  The  impact  of  CDD  programs  in  supporting  community  groups  is  reduced, \nhowever,  by  the  current  annual  budget  system  used  by  the  Government.  State  budget \nregulations  stipulate  that  public  funds  must  be  spent  within  the  current  fiscal  (calendar)  year \neven  though  public  funding  may  be  released  as  late  as  the  second  half  of  the  year,  and \ncommunities\u2019 frequent lack of experience creates further delays. The inability of communities to \ncarry  over  unspent  funds  beyond  the  current  fiscal  year  could  potentially  lead  to  major \ndisruptions  in  spending  plans.  While  the  current  restrictions  on  carryover  do  not  affect  donor \nloan  and  grant  funds,  it  applies  to  the  Government\u2019s  rupiah  funds.  While  in  the  past  CDD \nprograms were funded mainly by donor funds, this situation has been rapidly changing, and in \n2009  it  is  expected  that  the  majority  of  funds  will  be  coming  from  the  Government\u2019s  rupiah \nfunds. The Government has been deliberating a number of  available options for resolving this \nissue. The other component of the trigger relates to how funds are to be spent by communities. \nAll  public  agencies  are  required  to  undertake  expenditure  in  compliance  with  the  2003 \nProcurement  Law.  As  private  entities,  community  groups  are  exempt  from  this  requirement. \nNevertheless, there is a misunderstanding within central and regional governments that public \nprocurement regulations apply to community groups, thus adding to the problems communities \nface in completing CDD projects. This has necessitated that the Government raise awareness \namong public agencies and communities regarding procurement regulations.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER AND POLICY MATRIX FOR THE THIRD  \nDEVELOPMENT POLICY SUPPORT PROGRAM \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n \n53\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n \n55\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n \n57\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n \n59\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n \n61\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n \n63\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A4: Policy Matrix for the Third Development Policy Support Program \n \n\nStatus as of 9 November 2007 \n\nDPSP-3 Policy Measures \nA.

Directorate  General  (DG)  tax  regulation  No.  122/2006  is  being  implemented.    Substantial \nprogress  has  been  achieved  in  VAT  administration,  with  the  average  time  taken  to  settle  the  VAT  refund \nclaims of manufacturing exporters having fallen to 5.1 months in 12-18 months in 2003.  The Government \nhas also settled 7,878 VAT refund claims from previous fiscal years amounting to Rp. 10.4 trillion during the \npast  12  months.    The  issuance  of  a  DG  tax  circular  letter  on  accelerating  the  settlement  process  of  VAT \nrefunds in July 2007, has further strengthen implementation of Tax Regulation No 122/2006. \n \nExceeded.  In late 2006 the Ministry of Finance and the Directorate General for Taxes issued a number of \nregulations  that  affected  tax  audit  procedures.  The  Ministerial  Decree  123/PMK.03/2006  revised  previous \nprovisions  related  to  tax  audit  procedures  and  taxpayer  rights.  Article  15  of  this  decree  requires  the  tax \nauditor  to  inform  taxpayers  in  writing  about  the  results  of  the  audit  and  the  closing  conference,  including \ndetails on the audit findings and the legal basis for audit decisions. In addition, the DG Tax regulations PER-\n173/PJ/2006 on desk audit procedures and PER-176/PJ/2006 on field audit procedures stipulate taxpayer \nrights to bring an audit decision to and request a review by a higher level of authority in case of disputes.  \nExtended taxpayer rights are also embedded in the Tax Law package passed by Parliament in March 2007 \n \nAchieved.  The  blueprint  for  the  National  Single  Window  has  been  released    A  pilot  project  for  Tanjung \nPriok, which handles about 60% of Indonesia's trade, is currently under preparation with a scheduled launch \ndate of December 2007. \n \n\nAchieved.  The  technical  team  supporting  team  tariff  has  been  reconstituted  by  a  decree  issued  by  the \nFinance  Minister  and  its  leadership  and  coordinating  functions  have  been  transferred  from  MOF  to  the \nMinistry of Trade.

Out  of  the  four  outstanding  decrees  to  be  issued  in  2007,  two  decrees,  PP  76/2007  on  the \ncriteria for negative lists, and PP/77/2007 on the negative list itself was issued in July 2007.  In addition, two \nministerial  decrees  have  been  issued  creating  a  professional  secretariat  for  the  inter-ministerial  National \nTeam  on  Accelerating  Investment  and  Exports  (PEPI),  and  three  working  groups  under  PEPI  for  policy \nformulation,  policy  implementation,  and  integrated  trade,  tourism  and  investment  promotion.

The Minister of trade issued two new decrees on 4 September 2007 to reduce the time to obtain \nthe business trading license and the business registration certification.  Both decrees eliminate a number of \nprerequisites and simplify reporting requirements.  On 21 September 2007, the Minister of Justice issued a \ndecree  simplifying  the  procedures  to  legalize  a  limited  liability  company,  which  effectively  removed  a \nnumber of prior actions.  At the same time the Minister of Justice also issued a decree rescinding a previous \ndecree  that  transferred  the  authority  to  legalize  limited  liability  companies  from  its  central  office  to  its \nprovincial  offices,  which  had  added  one-week  to  business  start  up  times.    The  combined  impact  of  these \nchanges should cut business start up times by potentially more than one month. \n \n \n\n6\n6\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nAchieved. The SME policy package was issued as part of Presidential Instruction (Inpres) 6/2007 covering \na  number  of  areas  pertaining  to  SMEs  -  and  in  particular  it  highlights  several  actions  related  to  improving \naccess to finance for SMEs. This includes recapitalizing credit guarantee firms through a reallocation from \nexisting SME finance programs of line ministries into a two step guarantee fund, thereby reducing the credit \nrisk borne by commercial banks.  The Government has allocated Rp. 1.4 trillion in the state budget (APBN) \nfor this purpose.  Implementing regulations for the Warehouse receipt law has been issued (PP 36/2007).  \n \n\n5.

A Programmatic MTEF pilot has been prepared for the Ministry \nof Finance.  \n \nAchieved.  Zero-balance  banking  arrangements  with  commercial  banks  have  been  successfully  piloted  in \n50  selected  regional  treasury  offices  (KPPN).    The  tender  for  administration  of  operational  accounts  to \ncommercial  banks  has  been  completed  in  all  regions  and  the  roll-out  of  zero  balance  arrangements  to \nexpenditure  accounts  in  all  178  KPPNs  occurred  on  1  October  2007.    This  consolidates  more  than  1000 \nbalance-bearing treasury accounts into one balance bearing treasury single account (TSA) and associated \nzero-balance  accounts.    Revenue  accounts  are  scheduled  to  become  zero-balanced  by  the  end  of  2007.  \nThe  adoption  of  Government  Regulation  (PP)  No.  36/2007  on  Cash  Management  enacted  in  July  2007 \nprovides the legal basis for a census of all government accounts and enhances the power of the Minister of \nFinance to close unauthorized bank accounts.

Regulation  No.  8/2007  has  been  issued  which  prescribes  the  principals  for  improved \nmanagement  and  transparent  accountability  in  the  management  of  RDI  accounts.    In  addition,  detailed \nprocedures  have  been  issued  through  ministerial  decree  covering  a  range  of  operational  matters.    The \nregulatory framework for RDI accounts have also been put in place, while the regulatory framework for RDA \naccounts is still outstanding.  Accounting for RDI and RDA continues to be manual and segregated from the \naccounting  system  of  Ministry  of  Finance,  though  computerization  is  in  progress.  A  complete  and  reliable \nlisting of individual loan accounts is under preparation but has not been issued yet \n \n \n\nSatisfactory.  A  new  presidential  decree  has  been  drafted  to  create  an  independent  NPPO  (the \nGoods/Services  Procurement  Policy  Development  Institute,  or  LPKPP)  which  is  beyond  the  original \nexpectations  of  the  trigger.  The  target  date  for  issuance  of  the  decree  is  November  2007.    The  draft \nProcurement Law has yet to be finalized. \n \n \n\nAchieved.  The inter-departmental team that consists of working-level officials from MOF, State Ministry of \nAdministrative Reform and Civil Service Agency  was  established in 2006. The  team has completed a pay \nproposal of high-state official positions.  \n \nAchieved. The Ministry of Finance issued a far-reaching short-term civil service reform program on January \n2007  that  includes:  (i)  reorganization  within  the  secretary  general  office;  (ii)  improvement  of  business \nprocess;  (iii)  improvement  of  the  overall  human  resource  management;  and  (iv)  creation  of  a  job-based \nremuneration system.

Management of the Government\u2019s budget is influenced \nto a large extent by ongoing public financial management (PFM) reforms. This note summarizes \nthe  direction  and  progress  of  these  reforms  in  order  to  determine  the  attendant  fiduciary  risks \nwith respect to these funds. \n \n2. \nThis  assessment  of  fiduciary  aspects  of  this  loan  draws  upon  several  studies  on  PFM \nand accountability that have been completed over the past 12 months, both internally within the \nWorld  Bank,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  other  development  partners.  Studies \nundertaken  internally  by  the  World  Bank  include  a  Public  Expenditure  Review  completed  this \nyear.  It  also  includes  a  Sector  Report  on  Accountability  &  Audit  in  Indonesia  (ADB:  January \n2007), implementation reports on the ongoing State Audit Reform Program being implemented \nwith  ADB  support,  a  Statement  of  Fiscal  Risks  (IMF:  2006),  a  Report  on  Budget  Reform \nPriorities (joint World Bank and IMF: April 2007), and a Report on Observance of Standards and \nCodes  on  Fiscal  Transparency  (IMF:  October  2006).  This  assessment  has  also  taken  into \naccount  a  review  of  the  progress  made  in  implementing  actions  agreed  under  the  third  DPL \napproved in 2006 and results of recent supervision missions to assess progress in implementing \nthe  World  Bank  financed  Government  Financial  Management  and  Revenue  Administration \nProject  (GFMRAP)  that  became  effective  in  October  2005.  These  reports  and  documents \nprovide  the  analytical  underpinnings  for  this  assessment.  An  exercise  to  measure  PFM \nprocesses  based  on  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  methodology  is \ncurrently under way and is likely to be completed by November 2007. \n \n3.  \nDeficiencies  in  Indonesia\u2019s  PFM  systems  have  been  well  documented  in  recent  years, \nand a reform strategy to address these was formulated by the Government in its White Paper on \nPFM reforms in 2001. This strategy covered a broad spectrum of public financial management, \nfrom budget formulation to budget execution, accounting and reporting, and external oversight. \nThese  reforms  directly  influence  the  environment  in  which  public  expenditure  is  planned, \nbudgeted,  executed,  and  accounted  for  across  all  levels  of  government.  A  more  detailed \ncommentary  on  progress  in  implementing  these  reforms  is  given  below  to  help  identify  the \nattendant  risks  arising  from  the  Borrower\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  this  loan  and  determine  the \nfiduciary arrangements for this operation.  \n \nB. \n \nA  recent  analysis  by  the  World  Bank 1  has  concluded  that  prudent  macroeconomic \n4. \npolicies,  particularly  the  extremely  low  budget  deficits,  have  been  instrumental  in  Indonesia\u2019s \nrecovery  from  the  last  crisis.  Over  the  past  10  years,  there  has  also  been  a  remarkable \ntransformation in the way public resources are managed and allocated. As a result, Indonesia \ncan expect to have significant additional fiscal resources, or \u201cfiscal space,\u201d that is almost of the \nmagnitude of the revenue windfall seen during the oil boom of the mid-1970s.  \n \n5. \nThe composition of public investment has changed substantially since decentralization. \nWhen  Indonesia  decentralized,  subnational  governments  increased  their  shares  of  resources. \n\nBudget Allocations  \n\n                                                 \n1  World  Bank.  2007.

Jakarta/Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f76 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nSubnational governments now manage about half of total public investment. At the same time, \nthe sectoral composition of expenditures changed as well. The overall shares of education and \nadministrative  expenditures  have  increased  substantially,  while  infrastructure  has  declined, \nparticularly since 2003. However, some key indicators of Government budget performance have \nnot  improved  so  far,  particularly  budget  outturn  indicators.  Actual  central  government \nexpenditure  has  consistently  deviated  from  initial  plans.  Subsidies  tend  to  be  underestimated, \nwhile  capital  spending  has  been  consistently  lower  than  the  budgeted  amount.  At  the  same \ntime,  other  parts  of  the  budget\u2015most  notably  public  investments  and  central  government \npersonnel spending\u2015show underspending.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \n\nSome key elements of the reform strategy articulated in the past included the following: \n(i) \n\nPublic Financial Management Reform Strategy \n\n(iv)  Modernizing  management  of \n\nModernizing an outdated legal environment for PFM, by issuing a modern set of \nlaws and implementing regulations. \nReforming an opaque and inefficient budget formulation process by discontinuing \nthe  separate  recurrent  and  development  budgets  and  introducing  performance \nbudgeting systems and forward estimates. \nReforming  budget  implementation,  in  particular  the  inefficient  payments  system \nand weak monitoring and accountability arrangements. \n\nthe  Government  Treasury \n\nto  consolidate \nfragmented  cash  management  and  make  government  banking  arrangements \nmore efficient. \nIntroducing modern government accounting standards and accounting practices \nto improve the reliability of government financial reporting.  \nReforming arrangements for government auditing, in particular strengthening the \nmandate  and  capacity  of  the  State  Audit  Agency  (BPK),  addressing  overlaps \nbetween external and internal audit agencies, and clarifying their respective roles \nand responsibilities. \n\nthe \n\ninstitutional  and  regulatory \n\nframework \n\nfor  public  sector \n\n(vii)  Modernizing \nprocurement. \n\nSummary of Implementation Experience on PFM Reforms \n\n \nD. \n \n7. \nThe  current  Government  has  embarked  on  a  new  phase  of  reforms  in  the  budget  and \nPFM  system  with  support  from  various  development  partners. 2  These  followed  important \npolitical  reforms  that  were  introduced  after  1998,  including  \u201cbig  bang\u201d  decentralization  and  the \ndirect election of the President. Key areas of progress so far include the following:  \n\nAdopting a new legal framework for planning, budgeting, treasury management, \nand  external  audit.  New  laws  were  adopted  by  Parliament  in  2003\u20132004  and \nmany government implementing regulations were issued thereafter. \nRestructuring  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).  A  first  restructuring  occurred  in \n2004, when the Directorate General (DG) of Treasury was established, separate \nfrom  DG  Budget.  A  second  restructuring  occurred  in  2006,  when  a  new  Fiscal \nPolicy  Office  was  established  with  a  focus  on  macro-fiscal  policies  and \nprojections, and a new DG Debt was created by splitting off two directorates from \nDG Treasury, with external and domestic debt management consolidated in one \nDG.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n2  The  main  technical  assistance  providers  are  the  World  Bank,  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the  International \nMonetary Fund, the Government of the Netherlands, the European Community, and the Government of Australia.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n77 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nUnifying the previous routine and development budgets. As from the 2005 annual \nbudget,  a  new  economic  and  functional  classification  was  introduced  for \nbudgetary  expenditures,  based  on  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nGovernment Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001) system.3 \nBeginning  a  process  of  rationalizing  government  bank  accounts  and  improving \ncash management.4 A principal objective is to establish a treasury single account \n(TSA) and to close government accounts outside the DG Treasury\u2019s control. \nGovernment  Regulation  No.  24/2005  prescribes  modified  cash  government \naccounting  standards  as  a  transition  towards  full  accrual  standards  at  a  later \ndate.  Templates  for  accounting  statements  to  be  used  by  central  and  local \ngovernments have also been issued. \nFinalizing  plans  to  introduce  a  new  treasury  system.  The  World  Bank\u2019s \nGovernment  Financial  Management  and  Revenue  Administration  Project \n(GFMRAP)  focuses  particularly  on  computerization  of  treasury  operations \nthrough the treasury system. The GFMRAP also includes components to support \nchange  in  the  budget  system\u2014within  the  MOF  and  National  Development \nPlanning  Agency\u2014as  well  as  for  improving  parliamentary  involvement  and \noversight of the budget approval processes. \nPresidential  Decree  No.  80/2003 \nthe \nprocurement  regime  and  lays  out  a  plan  for  establishing  a  national  policy \nformulation and oversight agency. An omnibus procurement law is envisaged for \nconsolidating,  clarifying,  and  simplifying  the  numerous  procurement  rules  and \nregulations.  This  law,  currently  under  preparation,  will  strengthen  the  legal \nfoundation for modernizing public procurement. \n\nintroduces  many \n\nimprovements \n\nto \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  Strengthening  the  mandate  of  and  funding  for  an  external  audit  institution.  The \nState  Audit  Law,  legislated  in  2004,  lays  out  the  broad  legal  framework  for  the \noperation  of  the  country\u2019s  supreme  audit  institution,  the  BPK,  to  reinforce  its \nposition  and  mandate  as  an  external  audit  institution  reporting  to  Parliament.  A \nseparate  law  (the  State  Audit  Agency  Law)  has  recently  been  passed  to  cover \nthe institutional arrangements for the management and oversight of the BPK. The \nBPK has seen a significant increase in its budgetary financial resources. \nEnhancing  parliamentary  oversight  of  budget  processes.  Parliamentary \ncommissions  have  become  particularly  active  in  scrutinizing  and  amending  the \nGovernment\u2019s  draft  annual  budget.  However,  this  has  become  more  intensive \nand  detailed  than  is  the  case  in  many  countries.  A  more  strategic  and  less \ninstructive approach is needed. \nThe Government published the IMF fiscal transparency report5 and undertook its \nsocialization  throughout Indonesia. The  public availability  of  fiscal  information  is \nalready  improving  and  the  Government  has  published  a  fiscal  risk  statement \ntogether with the 2008 budget. \n\n(x) \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3  IMF. 2005.

Washington, DC. \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nExperience in Implementing Budget Reforms \n\nE. \n \n8. \nThe  fiscal  roles  of  the  executive  and  legislative  branches  are  now  defined  in  law  and \nevolving  in  practice.  Fiscal  relationships  between  the  executive  and  legislature  are  defined  in \nState Finance Law No.17/2003. The House of Representatives (DPR) is the principal legislative \nbody,  and  it  plays  a  significant  role  in  shaping  the  budget  and  fiscal  policy.  The  budget  is \npassed in agreement between the President and DPR. The process involves an examination by \nthe  DPR  of  the  macroeconomic  framework,  macro-fiscal  policies,  and  the  detailed  budget \nallocations. The relative roles of the executive and legislative branches in this area are evolving. \n \n9.  \nThe  laws  governing  budget  management  clearly  specify  the  responsibilities  of  the \nminister of finance and comprehensive regulations have been developed. While the President, \nas head of the Government, has overall authority to exercise national fiscal management, Law \nNo.  17/2003  clearly  delegates  the  responsibility  of  overall  fiscal  management  of  central \ngovernment  finances  to  the  minister  of  finance  as  chief  financial  officer.  The  law  also  assigns \nresponsibilities  to  individual  ministers,  governors,  and  other  local  authorities  for  financial \nmanagement and accountability in their jurisdictions. \n \n10. \nProvisions  of  the  new  regulations  are  being  implemented.  The  budget  classification  is \nlargely consistent with contemporary international standards. The MOF is developing plans for a \nmedium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) to guide budget policy. Forward estimates at the \naggregate  level  have  been  introduced  for  2009  and  2010  with  the  budget  for  2008.  However, \nmuch more work needs to be done to fully operationalize the MTEF approach.  \n \nF. \n \nIndonesia still spends 50% of its total capital expenditure in the final quarter of the year.6 \n11. \nFor the past 5 years, spending has always started slowly and then accelerated towards the end \nof each year. This spending pattern is of concern because project implementation is disrupted \nby  an  adverse  cycle.  Moreover,  underspending  in  capital  investments  constrains  increases  in \ninfrastructure investments. Slow and back-loaded disbursements are symptoms of more severe \nchallenges that are encountered at each stage of the public expenditure management cycle. \n \n12. \nThe  Government  maintains  a  comparatively  rigid  budget  execution  process.  Detailed \ninput controls aim to ensure that the composition of the budget complies with political priorities \nand that the budget is not altered during execution. Spending warrants (DIPA), while now issued \nat the start of the fiscal year, contain excessive detail, leaving little flexibility for adjustments in \nthe composition of inputs needed to carry out a given activity. Reallocations across DIPAs from \ndelayed programs to better performing ones that could enhance satisfactory implementation of \nthe overall expenditure program require lengthy revision, sometimes involving Parliament. Such \ninflexibility creates practical difficulties and inefficiencies. \n \n13.  With expanding fiscal space, public investment is increasing, putting additional pressure \non PFM systems. Planning and executing public investment is inherently more demanding than \ncurrent or mandatory expenditure.  \n \n14. \nBasic  internal  control  procedures  are  in  place  to  ensure  that  expenditures  across  all \nspending  agencies  strictly  follow  approved  budgets.  Spending  units\u2019  DIPAs  are  the  key \n\nReforming Budget Execution \n\n                                                 \n6  World  Bank.  2007.

Jakarta/Washington, DC.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n79 \n\nTreasury and Cash Management \n\ndocuments  required  to  authorize  government  spending  and  form  the  basis  for  expenditure \ncontrol. These are now issued on a timelier basis than in previous years. MOF regulations have \nbeen  issued  to  cover  various  aspects  of  budget  execution.  The  Treasury  records  expenditure \ntransactions at the payment stage. The expenditure control system does not provide for central \nrecording  of  commitments.  Operational  control  over  expenditure  stages,  such  as  commitment \nand verification of delivery of goods and services, is undertaken by budget users.  \n \nG. \n \n15. \nTransparency is clouded by a multitude of bank accounts. The Treasury itself maintains \nmultiple  bank  accounts,  both  in  rupiah  and  in  foreign  currency,  at  Bank  Indonesia  (BI).  There \nare  also  an  unknown  number  of  extra-budgetary  bank  accounts  maintained  by  budget  users. \nExternal  audit  reports  have  placed  at  over  1,300  the  number  of  bank  accounts  that  have  not \nbeen reported to the central Treasury. \n \n16. \nRegulations  associated with  Law  1/2004  will  address  this  weakness  and  provide  for  (i) \nestablishment  of  a  treasury  single  account  (TSA)  at  Bank  Indonesia;  (ii)  conversion  of \noperational  bank  accounts  at  commercial  banks  into  zero-balance  transit  accounts;  and  (iii)  a \nmandatory review at MOF of bank accounts of all state agencies outside treasury oversight, with \na  view  to  close  those  that  do  not  serve  the  public  interest.  Pilot  runs  for  testing  zero-balance \narrangements  with  commercial  banks  have  been  successful.  It  is  planned  to  complete  the \nconsolidation of all government cash balances into the TSA by end-2007. \n \n17. \nThe implementing regulation for Law 1/2004, Government Regulation 36/2007 on Cash \nManagement,  was  issued  in  July  2007  and  details  the  governance  and  setup  of  cash \nmanagement. In addition, a number of MOF regulations (PMK) have been issued to further the \nestablishment of the TSA: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nPMK  57  is  the  generic  PMK  to  regulate  opening  of  bank  accounts  by  the  line \nministries.  \nPMK 58 mandates a census of the existing line ministry accounts.  \nPMK 59 mandates echelon I officers of MOF to disclose the bank accounts if any \nare being operated.  \n\nto \n\ntransmitted \n\ntreasury  headquarters \n\nThe  cash-based  accounting  system  generates \n\n \n18. \ntimely  records  of  revenue  and \nexpenditure  transactions,  but  does  not  track  monthly  arrears.

The cash-based treasury \nsystem  does  not  track  payment  arrears  on  a  monthly  basis,  although  DG  Treasury\u2019s  plans  to \nmove towards an accrual recording system would make that possible. \n \nTreasury  cash  management  and  payment  modernization  will  be  supported  by  the \n19. \nplanned  computerized  treasury  information  management  system  under  the  World  Bank \nGFMRAP  project.  Implementation  of  the  treasury  component  of  GFMRAP  has  been  delayed. \nDG  Treasury  has  not  mobilized  for  project  implementation,  and  the  procurement  process  has \nbeen ongoing for more than 18 months.  \n \nH. \n \nthe  public  procurement \n20. \nenvironment.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  provided  a  national  public  procurement \nregulation  corresponding  to  most  of  what  is  generally  regarded  as  accepted  international \n\nfew  years  have  witnessed \n\nProcurement Reforms \n\nimprovements \n\nThe  past \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f80 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nInstitution \n\nfrom  both \n\npractice, including the basic principles: transparency, open and fair competition, economy, and \nefficiency.  This  decree  also  requires  that  a  national  public  procurement  office  (NPPO)  be \nestablished as a regulatory body for public procurement. With Presidential Decree No. 80/2003, \na previous certification (\u201cpre-qualification\u201d) process for suppliers of goods and services was, in \nmost instances, abandoned by the Government. This has previously led to segmentation of the \nmarket and especially at the provincial levels. Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 also established \nthe basis for sanctions, complaint-handling and requirements for certification of users.  \n \nNevertheless,  the  public  procurement  system  still  has  significant  deficiencies  in  its \n21. \nregulatory  and,  more  importantly,  implementation  aspects.  These  are  due  mainly  to  delays  in \nestablishing  a  strong  regulatory  body;  slow  progress  in  developing  procurement  regulation \nanchored by a law; slow progress in developing standard tools in terms of bidding documents \nand users manuals; weakness in procurement capacity in implementing agencies, especially at \nthe provincial and district levels; and collusion and corruption practices in the bidding process, \nalong with concerns over the efficiency of anticorruption and sanction measures.  \n \nA  new  presidential  decree  has  been  drafted  that,  when  issued,  will  establish  a  fully \n22. \nindependent  Goods/Services  Procurement  Policy  Development \n(Lembaga \nPengembangan  Kebijakan  Pengadaan  Pemerintah,  or  LPKPP).  The  planned  institution  will  be \nchaired  by  an  appointee  from  the  civil  service  (nonpolitical),  who  may  be  assisted  by  a \ninside  and  outside \ncommittee  comprised  of  procurement  experts  sourced \ngovernment.  The  establishment  of  the  LPKPP,  in  itself,  should  not  be  regarded  as  reforming \npublic sector procurement. Rather, it should be perceived as the first crucial stepping stone to \nenable focus on a wider public procurement reform program.  \n \n23. \nLaws enacted since 2000 impacting, or making reference to, public procurement cover \nconstruction  (governing  civil  works),  state  finance,  treasury,  audit,  and  small-scale  business. \nThe  pace  of  Indonesia\u2019s  commendable  decentralization  reforms  has  impacted  public  sector \nprocurement  at  all  levels  of  government,  with  ministers,  governors,  and  even  mayors  able  to \nissue  decrees,  regulations,  and  instructions.  The  plethora  of  regulations  is  often  inconsistent, \nand  many  regulations  do  not  meet  accepted  international  practice.  Consequently,  national \nprocurement reform and the need for national procurement policies and standards have become \nurgent. \n \n24. \nIndonesia\u2019s legal framework for public sector procurement can best be strengthened by \nanchoring  it  with  an  overarching,  consolidated,  and  comprehensive  national  public  sector \nprocurement  law  at  the  highest  level  that  (i)  establishes  the  fundamental  principles  and \nprocedures applicable to all public sector procurement, (ii) allows for the imposition of sanctions \nwhere  the  principles  and  procedures,  and  particularly  those  relating  to  good  governance  and \nethics,  are  not  met,  (iii)  amends  other  laws  that  refer  to  public  sector  procurement,  and  (iv) \nensures that such law has the necessary authority in a decentralized environment. Drafts of a \nnew  high-level  law  and  associated  subordinate  regulations  are  being  finalized  and  should  be \nready by the end of 2007. \n \nStandard  Bidding  Documents.  Currently,  there  are  no  national  standard  bidding \n25. \ndocuments  in  Indonesia.  Some  implementing  agencies  (such  as  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works) \nhave developed standard bidding documents for their own use. However, there is no evidence \nthat such documents are consistently used at all levels of government. The NPPO, through the \nsupport  of  ADB,  has  drafted  eight  National  Model  (Standard)  Bidding  Documents:  (i)  An \nExplanatory  Guide,  (ii)  Goods  with  Pre-qualification,  (iii)  Goods  with  Post-qualification,  (iv) \nWorks  with  Pre-qualification,  (v)  Works  with  Post-qualification,  (vi)  Other  Services  with \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n81 \n\nthe \n\nPre-qualification,  (vii)  Other  Services  with  Post-qualification,  and  (viii)  Consulting  Services. \nThese  are  now  available  in  a  draft  form  in  the  Indonesian  language  only.  The  use  of  these \ndocuments  is  still  not  mandatory,  and,  in  fact,  there  is  still  no  strong  push  from  the  NPPO  to \nenforce their use at the national level. The NPPO preference is to try these documents on a pilot \nbasis. While Presidential Decree No. 80/2003 provides the basic requirements to be included in \nGeneral Conditions of Contract, such a standard has yet to be produced. \n \n26. \nCapacity  Building  and  Certification.  There  has  been  growing  concern,  both  in  the \nGovernment and the ADB and World Bank, over the pace of project implementation. Significant \ndelays  and  slow  disbursement  seem  to  occur  across  the  entire  PFM  cycle.  Projects  reported \nin  budget  preparation  and  approval,  budget  execution,  and \ndelays  and  difficulties \nimplementation  (procurement).  Specifically, \nimplementation \nthere  are  concerns  on \n(procurement) capacity of government staff and the absence of incentives for project managers \nand  procurement  committees.  Added  to  this,  fears  of  prosecution  have  also  affected  projects \ndue to the reluctance of officials to take action amid growing worries of being prosecuted under \nanticorruption legislation, even over minor mistakes.  \n \n27. \nOn  Capacity  Building.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  required  the  Government  to \nadopt an examination system and certification for procurement practitioners within Government \ncontracting entities, in order to ensure that their level of competence is consistent with their level \nof responsibilities. So far, the rate of staff passing the basic procurement certification is very low \n(12%). It is evident that there is need for a strategic approach to capacity building. The future \nLPKPP will consider creating a professional procurement training and certification board in order \nto develop and integrate a cost-effective procurement capacity-building program. \n \n28. \nCorruption,  Sanction  and  Independent  Appeals  Mechanism. Despite improvements \nin the public procurement system, concerns remain over corrupt and collusive practices. Several \ncases under ADB and World Bank projects have come to light. While addressing this requires \nan  overall  governance  strategy,  there  are  several  important  elements  in  the  procurement \nsystem  that  can  support  such  a  strategy,  such  as  an  independent  complaints  mechanism,  an \neffective  sanctions  mechanism,  and  improving  transparency  in  the  procurement  process \nthrough e-procurement.  \n \n29. \nPresidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  requires  the  establishment  of  a  complaints  handling \nmechanism. However, this is not set up independently but within each implementing agency. As \npart of the ongoing Country Procurement Assessment Report, options to be explored include to \nhave an independent complaints handling mechanism under the \u201cumbrella\u201d but independent of \nthe LPKPP, or possibly to have a totally independent body comprising individuals from private \nsector professional organizations and civil servants with expertise in public sector procurement \nand procurement law. \n \n30. \nE-procurement.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW)  and  City  of  Surabaya  have  both \nbeen at the forefront in the development of e-government procurement (e-GP) technology. The \nNPPO  has  been  taking  the  lead  on  behalf  of  the  Government  for  implementing  e-GP  in \nIndonesia at a national level. Currently, the focus is on developing policy and legislation for the \nvalidity  of  e-GP,  including  electronic  documents  and  signatures.  The  NPPO  has  also \nestablished an electronic bulletin board for advertising national procurement opportunities. The \nNPPO  is  considering  to  adopt  a  national  e-GP  system  similar  to  that  adopted  by  the  City  of \nSurabaya and to pilot the e-tendering functionality as a first step. Eventually, MOPW will need to \ndecide  whether  to  adopt  the  national  system  in  its  entirety  or  ensure  that  its  own  system  will \nintegrate  with  it.  Currently,  the  MPW  quasi  e-system  is  used  for  large  national  road  works \n\n \n\n\f82 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nAccounting and Reporting on Budget Execution \n\ncontracts  in  Java  and  Sumatra.  Generally,  the  MPW  system  provides  most  of  the  online \nfunctionalities  for  e-tendering  that  would  be  required  by  international  standards.  However, \nsubmission of bids is still being done manually due to the absence of legislation to allow the full \nprocess as described above.  \n \nI. \n \n31. \nThe  aggregate  Government  Annual  Financial  Statements  have  been  prepared  in  a \ntimely manner for 3 years now (2004, 2005, and 2006). Although the timeliness is a significant \nachievement, serious concerns remain over their reliability. The BPK has for 3 years issued a \n\u201cdisclaimer\u201d  opinion  on  these  financial  statements  due,  among  various  factors,  to  serious \nshortcomings in the control environment in which these statements were prepared and due to \nscope limitations.  \n \n32. \nThe  aggregate  annual  financial  statements  present  revenues,  expenditures  and \ntransfers, surpluses or deficits, and financing aggregates in comparison with budget provisions. \nA  balance  sheet  and  a  cash  flow  statement  are  also  presented,  along  with  a  full  statement  of \ngovernment accounting policy.  \n \n33. \nThe  recent  development  of  Government  Accounting  Standards  is  a  step  forward  in \nimproving  financial  reporting,  although  the  requirement  of  the  State  Treasury  Law  for  the \ncomplete introduction of accrual accounting by 2008 is very ambitious and may not be realistic. \nThe  Accounting  Standards  Committee  has  been  in  operation  for  a  few  years  now,  and  during \nthat time it has put into place a due process for developing government accounting standards \nthat  are  well  aligned  with  comparable  international  standards.  Technical  capacity  constraints \nlimit  the  pace  at  which  these  accounting  standards  can  be  implemented  at  all  levels  of \ngovernment, including line ministries and subnational governments. \n \n34.  Monthly and quarterly reports on budget realization are produced by each ministry on a \nmonthly  basis  and  sent  to  the  MOF  for  consolidation.  A  midyear  unaudited  report  on  budget \nrealization is presented to the DPR in July and is available to civil society. \n  \nThere  are  no  systematic  and  publicly  available  reports  of  the  Government\u2019s  contingent \n35. \nliabilities,  tax  expenditures,  or  quasi-fiscal  activities.  Data  on  central  government  debt  are \nregularly  published,  but  there  are  time  lags  in  reporting  total  debt  and  concerns  over  the \nreliability  of  the  data  on  external  public  debt.  Information  on  government  financial  assets  is \npublished annually.  \n \n36. \nAlthough  commendable  action  has  been  taken  to  improve  government  financial \nreporting,  there  continue  to  be  serious  challenges  in  making  government  financial  statements \nreliable, as reported by  the BPK in its annual audit report for 2006. This reflects the immense \nchallenges  that  lie  ahead  in  an  environment  where  accounting  capacity  at  the  grassroots  is \nweak and accounting processes are not yet integrated or fully automated. \n \nJ. \n \nIndonesia  has  made  significant  progress7 in  addressing  deficiencies  in  the  audit  sector \n37. \nover  the  past  few  years.  The  enactment  of  the  State  Audit  Law  in  2004  clarified  the  BPK\u2019s \n\nExternal Audit \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2007.  Sector  Report  on  Accountability  and  Audit  in  Indonesia.  (produced  under  TA-4473  INO:  Support  for \n\nImplementation of Program Loan). Manila.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n83 \n\nmandate as the sole external state audit agency, granting it extensive rights of audit over public \nfinance  that  are  generally  in  line  with  international  standards  (Lima  Declaration).  In  practice, \nhowever, some restrictions continue to apply.  \n \nIn addition, the State Audit Agency Law was passed by Parliament in 2006, laying down \n38. \ninternal and external governance arrangements for the BPK as an organization on matters such \nas the appointment of BPK Board members and financial and administration independence. The \nBPK  has  issued  a  series  of  internal  implementing  regulations  for  these  laws  and  has  also \nrecently issued a new set of Government Auditing Standards that are substantially in line with \ncomparable  international  standards  (International  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions). \nThe  BPK  has  completed  a  comprehensive  study  of  its  organizational  structure  compared  with \nfully  developed  audit  institutions  in  other  countries  and  has  also  prepared  a  medium-term \nstrategic  development  plan.  Significant  increases  in  budgetary  financial  resources  have  been \ngranted to the BPK for its operational needs. \n \n39.   A peer review of the BPK was completed in 2004 and revealed serious weaknesses in \ncapacity.  Since  then,  improvements  are  gradually  being  made  to  the  organization,  with  new \nhires and training. Spending agencies generally respond  well to audit findings reported by the \nBPK.  The  BPK\u2019s  audit  reports  are  submitted  semiannually  to  Parliament  within  a  legally \nmandated  time.  These  reports  certify  the  financial  statements  of  the  audited  reporting  entities \nand  comment  on  any  irregularities  or  inefficiencies  in  budget  execution  that  may  have  been \nfound. However, there appears to be little systematic follow-up by the DPR on BPK reports and \nno  formal  reporting  of  this.  A  recent  study  by  ADB 8 has  highlighted  the  need  for  capacity \nbuilding at the DPR Secretariat in order to handle audit reports and information constructively. \nPublic disclosure of all BPK audit reports is now mandatory. \n \nK. \n \nThe  internal  audit  framework  of  the  Government  is  extensive,  but  scope  and \n40. \norganization do not match needs. Ironically, even with (or perhaps because of) multiple internal \naudit  agencies  in  existence,  the  internal  audit  function  continues  to  be  a  weak  link  in \ngovernance. The internal audit function is carried out at central government by three institutions: \nthe  Inspectorate  General  (IG)  in  each  spending  ministry;  the  government-wide  internal  auditor \n(the  State  Financial  Control  Agency,  or  BPKP),  reporting  to  the  President\u2019s  office,  with \ngovernment-wide  jurisdiction;  and  the  Regional  Supervision  Agency  (BAWASDA)  at  the  local \ngovernment level.  \n \n41. \nThis institutional structure is complex, and the mandates and division of labor between \nthe various internal audit institutions are unclear. The IG represents the principal internal audit \napparatus  of  a  ministry.  The  scope  of  IG  audit  activities  is  generally  limited  to  technical \ncompliance  audits.  The  IGs  therefore  operate  as  individual  institutions  corresponding  to  the \nnumber of ministries. Professional backgrounds of IG staff therefore normally include technical \nqualifications and not accounting or auditing. Audits by IGs are not conducted on a risk-based \nmethodology. Local governments maintain their own internal audit units (BAWASDA). \n \n42. \nBPKP\u2019s staffing levels do not reflect its reduced mandate. Despite this reduced mandate, \nit maintains fully staffed decentralized offices in 26 provinces. The BPKP no longer has a formal \nrole in internal audit, except to provide audit services to line ministries upon request. \n\nInternal Controls and Internal Audit \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006 Report on Capacity Building Needs of DPR Secretariat on Review of BPK Reports. (produced under TA \n\n4473-INO: Support for Implementation of Program Loan). Manila. \n\n \n\n\f84 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nReforming Regional Public Financial Management \n\n \n43. \nEach line ministry plays the role of program executing agency and is therefore principally \nresponsible for maintaining internal controls. It is responsible for performing and achieving the \nobjectives  stated  in  budget  allotment  documents.  In  order  to  strengthen  responsibility  and \naccountability over the appropriated budget by the line ministries, the function of payment order \nissuance has been transferred to the line ministries. This is resulting in a better segregation of \nthe functions for verifying transactions and issuing payments. While this segregation of duties is \nwell designed, implementation experience has not been entirely satisfactory in the absence of \nclearly  defined  standards  of  accounting  evidence,  verification  procedures,  and  well-staffed \nprepayment audit units in the spending agencies.  \n \nL. \n \n44. \nDecentralization  has  provided  local  governments  with  significant  resources  and \nauthority. This requires an adequate regulatory framework and PFM capacity at the local level. \nThe  PFM  reforms  stipulated  in  the  decentralization  and  subsequent  finance  and  treasury \nlegislation  aim  to  modernize  the  regional  PFM  system  and  improve  accountability  (assuming \nefficient  implementation),  but  these  reforms  are  vast  in  scope  and  the  concepts  are \nsophisticated. \n \nThe  regulatory  framework  for  regional  PFM  reforms  is  largely  in  place  and  includes \n45. \nmechanisms  for  fiscal  transfers  to  local  governments.  After  decentralization,  the  central \ngovernment  passed  comprehensive  legislation  for  PFM  reforms  at  the  regional  level  to  mirror \nthe changes being made at the centre.  \n \n46.  Most  regions  lack  adequate  technical  and  human  resources  to  implement  the  reforms, \nhowever,  and  the  central  government  has  not  yet  provided  the  needed  support.  The  unclear \ndivision of tasks between the MOF and Ministry of Home Affairs has resulted in inconsistent and \ncontradictory  legislation  with  regards  to  regional  financial  management,  and  this  has  caused \nconfusion among most local governments. While subnational governments are obliged by law to \nreport certain fiscal and financial information to the central government, many do not (the data \nmay be missing or simply withheld voluntarily).  \n  \nM. \n \n47. \nIndonesia has a sound legal framework for corporate governance and monitoring state-\nowned  enterprise  (SOE)  operations.  First,  the  SOE  Law,  No.  19/2003,  sets  a  clear  ownership \npolicy,  as  the  state  is  not  allowed  to  be  involved  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  SOEs  and \nmust  allow  them  full  operational  autonomy.  Second,  a 2002  ministerial  decree  clearly  details \ncorporate governance responsibilities, including the requirements to (i) submit each quarter the \nSOEs\u2019  financial  statements  to  the  Ministry  of  State-Owned  Enterprises  and  to  the  appropriate \nline ministries, (ii) prepare annual financial statements that must be audited internally and by an \nindependent auditor, and (iii) publish SOE annual reports in a timely manner.  \n \nExisting  laws  and  regulations  governing  SOEs  are  not  effectively  implemented.  Long \n48. \ndelays still occur in auditing and publishing SOE financial statements. SOE annual reports are \nusually only regularly and systematically made public in cases where companies have accessed \nthe local capital markets with listed instruments. \n \n49. \nThe  planned  use  of  public-private  partnerships  (PPPs)  to  accelerate  investment  will \ncreate fiscal risks that merit disclosure. The Government has taken steps to mitigate fiscal risks \n\nState-Owned Enterprises \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n85 \n\nDebt Management \n\nGovernance and Anticorruption  \n\nfrom PPPs. Presidential Regulation No. 67/2005 emphasizes careful project preparation and the \nselection of bidders in an open, competitive tender. It gives the minister of finance the right to \napprove or reject requests for government support. \n \nN. \n \n50. \nTwo  major  initiatives  in  debt  management  have  been  launched.  Despite  recent \nimprovements  in  debt  indicators,  risks  to  the  Government\u2019s  budget  remain  substantial,  and \nfurther improvements in debt management are essential to avoid future debt distress. MOF has \nmade good progress in this regard. Two specific examples are the development and publication \nof a comprehensive debt management strategy in September 2005 and the decision to create a \nDirectorate General for Public Debt Management. The Government is now working on a more \nformal debt sustainability analysis. \n \nO. \n \nThe  Anti-Corruption  Commission  (KPK)  is  fully  operational  and  performs  its  duties \n51. \nindependently, free from any influence. It coordinates with other entities combating corruption, \nconducts  investigations  and  prosecutions  against  corrupt  acts,  performs  preventative  actions \nagainst  corruption,  and  monitors  state  governance.  It  has  initiated  and  signed  memoranda  of \nunderstanding  with  some  provincial  and  local  governments  to  establish  and  support  good \ngovernance at the subnational level. As its capacity to carry out prosecutions is limited to a few \ncases per year, its focus tends to be on high-level, large-scale corruption.  \n \nP. \n \n52. \nclosely monitored: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nIn the period ahead, progress of the following key ongoing PFM reforms will need to be \n\nKey Areas for Future Attention  \n\nEnsuring coherence and momentum in public financial management reform.  \nDeepening  the  reforms  of  the  central  government  budgetary  sector  along  the \nlines discussed above. \nEnsuring  greater  integrity  and  more  effective  management  of  public  funds \nthrough  implementing  a  TSA,  automating  the  treasury  payments  system,  and \ninstituting measures to prevent the proliferation of off-budget bank accounts. \nStrengthening  internal  audit  institutions  by  establishing  synergistic  relationships \nbetween them and removing overlaps. \nImplementing  a  new  treasury  system,  extending  implementation  of  Government \nAccounting  Standards,  and  reengineering  underlying  business  processes  at \nspending agencies to ensure reliable financial reporting. \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi)  Widening  the  reforms  throughout  government.  This  means  extending  modern \nfinancial accountability and management processes to subnational governments \nin  a  coordinated  manner  and  bringing  these  fully  in  line  with  emerging  national \nstandards.  \n\n \n53.  Many  of  these  reforms  are  being  actively  considered,  and  prioritized  implementation \nplans  are  being  developed  by  the  Government.  The  capacity  to  centrally  monitor  these  and \nother  reforms  has  recently  been  established  at  the  Secretary  General\u2019s  Office  of  MOF.  The \nongoing work on Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability indicators will also assist the \nGovernment in setting benchmarks and monitoring progress. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f86 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nConclusion \n\nManagement of Foreign Exchange \n\nQ. \n \n54. \nThe foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The \ncountry  is  no  longer  subject  to  the  Extended  Arrangement  from  the  IMF.  Bank  Indonesia  was \nlast  subject  to  the  transitional  procedures  under  the  Fund\u2019s  safeguards  assessment  policy  in \n2002. That assessment recommended remedial action to address a number of vulnerabilities in \nBI\u2019s  audit  arrangements.  The  main  recommendations  have  been  implemented,  including  the \nestablishment  of  an  independent  audit  committee  at  BI  and  the  publication  of  BI\u2019s  audited \nfinancial  statements.  BI\u2019s  audited  financial  statements  for  2006  have  been  reviewed,  and  we \nnote that the audit report issued by the BPK contained an unqualified audit opinion. \n \nR. \n \n55. \nFollowing initial years of analytical work, Indonesia has taken impressive steps in recent \nyears  to  build  upon  this  work  and  establish  a  sound  legal  and  administrative  framework  for \nmodern  PFM.  Changes  in  the  legal  and  regulatory  architecture  are  now  largely  complete  and \nthe momentum has shifted towards implementation of new PFM practices.  \n \n56. \nKnown weaknesses in financial management and accountability continue to be gradually \naddressed  through  the  PFM  reform  program  discussed  above.  The  development  partners  are \nactively  engaged  in  this  process.  Key  elements  of  the  reforms  are  supported  by  the  DPL \ntriggers, as well as by the GFMRAP project and initiatives supported by development partners. \nMuch  remains  to  be  done,  however.  It  will  clearly  take  time  to  realize  the  full  impact  of  these \nreforms and to attain high standards in every element of sound PFM.  \n \n57. \nIn the meantime, some fiduciary risks will arise for this operation. Although the pace of \nimplementing the planned reforms has been somewhat slow over the past year, the trajectory of \nreform  is  in  the  right  direction  and  the  current  Government  continues  to  demonstrate  a \ncommitment  to  completing  the  planned  reforms  in  public  financial  management.

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n\nBased  on  the  country  poverty  assessment,  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  the  sector  analysis,  describe  how  the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n\nThe National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS) has five basic strategies for poverty reduction: (i) broadening opportunities, \n(ii)  empowering  community  institutions,  (iii)  increasing  capacity,  (iv)  providing  social  protection,  and  (v)  promoting  global \npartnerships.  The  NPRS  is  to  be  implemented  through  macroeconomic  strategy  and  policies  for  fulfilling  basic  rights, \npromoting  gender  justice  and  equality,  and  regional  development.  The  NPRS  considers  macroeconomic  policies  as  the \nfoundation  for  reducing  poverty  through  a  supportive  business  environment  and  broad  opportunities  for  increasing  the \ncapability of the poor through four related objectives to (i) create macroeconomic stability, (ii) promote economic growth, (iii) \nincrease  opportunities  for  employment  and  entrepreneurship,  and  (iv)  reduce  inequalities  between  regions.  The \nGovernment\u2019s Medium-Term National Development Plan, or RPJM, includes the main tenets of the previous draft NPRS and \nalso  incorporates  the  eight  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  This  provides  an  overarching  framework  that  places \nhuman development and poverty reduction at the center of the development agenda. \n \nThe  country  poverty  assessment 1  and  country  poverty  partnership  agreement 2  consider  macroeconomic  stability  as  a \nfundamental  underpinning  to  poverty  reduction.  Under  the  agreement,  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  agreed  to \nsupport the Government in promoting macroeconomic stability for inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Highest priority is \ngiven  to  institutional  reforms  to  achieve  transparent  and  accountable  institutions.  The  poverty  agreement  also  calls  for \nexpanding and improving such key basic services as health, education, water supply, and sanitation through public-private \npartnerships, and points out the need to expand the system of social protection. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                             Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nDPSP-3  supports  key  areas  of  the  RPJM  and  NPRS,  including  the  investment  climate,  public  financial  management  and \ngovernance, and service delivery to the poor. The DPSP-3 triggers or policy actions under these core areas are unlikely to \nharm the poor, while several triggers have the potential to reduce poverty in the medium term.   \n \n2. Design Features. Not applicable \n \n\nC. Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country and major \n\ngroups affected. \n\n \nThe majority of triggers under these core policy areas concern policy areas that do not directly affect the household budgets of \nthe poor. The links between poverty reduction and areas such as tax and customs administration, investment procedures, \nfinancial sector improvements, and increased transparency are indirect, through increased economic growth. Bureaucratic \nbarriers to establishing new businesses, increasing access to finance, and strengthening transparency are all areas involving \nconstraints to growth in the medium term. \n \nThree triggers in the DPSP-3 policy matrix are, however, likely to affect the poor in a more direct manner: (i) Changes in tariff \nrates can alter the purchasing power of poor households. Tariff reductions in goods that make up a significant share of poor \nhouseholds\u2019  budgets  will  benefit  the  poor  by  increasing  their  purchasing  power.  To  mitigate  risks  of  adverse  affects  in  low \nincome  groups,  the  additional  research  capacity  mandated  by  the  trigger  should  enable  policymakers  to  use  empirical \nestimates  of  the  impact  of  tariff  adjustments  on  poor  household  as  an  input  into  the  policy  process.  (ii)  An  effective \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005: Indonesia: Country Poverty Assessment. Manila.  \n2  ADB. 2002. ADB-Indonesia Country Poverty Partnership Agreement. Manila.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f88 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nassessment  framework  for  selected  service  delivery  can  also  reduce  poverty  in  the  medium  to  long  term.  The  poor \ndisproportionately  suffer  from  low  quality  services  and  low  levels  of  access  to  health,  education,  and  infrastructure.  As  a \nresult, 50% of the bottom quintile complete grade 7 compared with 90% of the richest quintile. Similar large inequalities are \npresent  in  health  outcomes  and  water  access.  (iii)  Teacher  certification  also  has  great  potential  to  improve  the  quality  of \nschools  in  poor  areas,  since  only  55%  and  73%  of  primary  and  secondary  teachers,  respectively,  currently  meet  the \nminimum qualifications required by the Ministry of National Education.  \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social analysis). \n \nThe policy reforms of DPSP-3 do not adversely affect vulnerable groups. \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. \n\nThe trigger on enhancing procedures for tariff setting (trigger 4) has the potential to increase the purchasing power of poor \nhouseholds.  The  triggers  relating  to  implementing  the  investment  law  (trigger  5)  and  to  simplifying  and  eliminating \nunnecessary  business  licenses  (trigger  6)  may  indirectly  improve  growth  and  poverty  outcomes  by  encouraging  additional \ninvestment  and  competition,  respectively.  The  trigger  relating  to  increasing  access  to  finance  for  small  and  medium \nenterprises (trigger 7) may indirectly reduce poverty through  additional growth,  while the trigger relating to consolidation of \ncore  government  bank  accounts  (trigger  10)  and  implementing  transparent  accountability  arrangements  for  RDI  and  RDA \naccounts  (trigger  11)  has  the  potential  to  indirectly  improve  poverty  by  increasing  local  outlays  and  possibly  reducing \ncorruption.  The  trigger  relating  to  developing  an  enhanced  assessment  framework  for  selected  service  delivery  programs \n(trigger 15) has the potential  to focus attention on service delivery  in poor areas to improve poverty outcomes. Finally, the \ntrigger  relating  to  carryover  of  community-designed  development  (CDD)  budgets  over  multiyear  periods  (trigger  17),  would \nallow communities and local governments greater flexibility in determining CDD projects and maintaining existing projects \n\n \n\n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe policy actions or triggers under DPSP-3 are not likely to harm the poor and, if they affect them at all, they will do more \ngood for the poor. The main impacts, as mentioned above, are indirect.   \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe  DPL  series  has  supported  actions  that  have  been  taken  by  the  Government  as  part  of  its  own  reform  agenda.  The \ndevelopment  of  this  reform  agenda  has  been  done  in  close  consultation  with  civil  society.  In  particular,  the  Government \nundertook  extensive  consultation  with  key  stakeholders  on  all  four  recently  issued  policy  packages  for  2006/2007  \u2014  in \ninfrastructure,  investment  climate,  SMEs,  and  the  financial  sector.  The  Government  has  engaged  extensively  with  civil \nsociety on tax and investment law reforms. The entire set of DPL-4/DPSP-3 policy actions will, as was done last year, likely \nbe  discussed  with  Parliament.  The  design  and  implementation  of  the  unconditional  cash  transfer  anti-poverty  program \ninvolved  substantial  participation  by  development  partners  and  civil  society.  This  extended  to  the  evaluation  of  these \nprograms,  as  well.  Such  a  systematic  assessment  of  key  government  programs,  making  these  findings  public,  and  using \nthese findings to help design future anti-poverty programs is a first in Indonesia.  \n\n \nMoreover, as part of the development policy loan process, consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders, \nincluding the private sector, labor groups, and enterprises. \n \n\n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n \n\n \n\n Information sharing       \n\n Consultation      \n\n Collaborative decision making     \n \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n3. Was a C&P plan prepared? \n \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. The DPL/DPSP process supports the Government\u2019s C&P process \n \n \nC. Gender and Development \n\n1.  Key  Issues.  The  DPL/DPSP  series  has  indirect  gender  impacts  through  its  emphasis  on  making  services  work  for  the \npoor.  The  improved  poverty  orientation  of  public  spending  increases  women\u2019s  access  to  essential  services  for  achieving \nMillennium  Development  Goal  targets,  including  to  reduce  child  and  maternal  mortality.  Improvement  of  the  financial \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n \n89\n\nmanagement systems of the Government through increased transparency and accountability will provide the civil society with \nbasic information necessary to monitor government actions and enable it to provide inputs into policy and budget decisions. \nA  strengthened  civil  society  provides  women  with  a  more  effective  channel  for  voicing  their  priorities.  An  improved \ninvestment  climate  is  expected  to  provide  greater  opportunities  for  women,  who  experience  significantly  higher  rates  of \nunemployment, even when controlling for experience and level of education. \n \n2.
