A \ntop-down  approach  to  strengthening  capacity  at  the  Ministry  of \nEducation  (MOE)  to  enhance  efficiency,  relevance,  and  equity  in \nprimary  and  general  secondary  education,  and  a  bottom-up \napproach to strengthening schools and district (raion) departments \nof  education  in  five  pilot  districts,  will  help  MOE  to  strike  a  greater \nbalance  between  central  and  local  functions.  The  project  focus  on \ninformation  system \nstrengthening \n(EMIS)  is  expected  to  improve  annual  planning  and  budgeting \ncritical  to  targeting  resources  to  priority  reforms  and  addressing \ninequities.  This  is  also  expected  to  significantly  enhance  MOE\u2019s \ncapacity  to  monitor  progress  of  reforms  and  respond  to  emerging \nneeds. \n \nTajikistan\u2019s education system is under significant threat following (i) \nindependence  and  cessation  of  large  subsidies  from  the  former \nSoviet Union, (ii) prolonged civil strife that caused physical damage \nto  an  estimated  20%  of  the  school  facilities,  and  (iii)  sharply \nreduced financing to education resulting from an overall downturn in \nthe  economy.  The  Government  is  now  committed  to  reverse  the \ntrend  with \nfunding \nagencies.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  institutionalize  systemic \nreforms  to  make  primary  and  general  secondary  education  more \naffordable,  efficient,  relevant,  and  equitable  within  a  coherent  and \naffordable national education development framework (NEDF). The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) provided emergency-type physical \nreconstruction  under  a  social  sector  rehabilitation  project  and \nrecognizes the need to undertake reforms gradually, through a well-\ninformed  and  participatory  process.  The  ESRP  will  combine  top-\ndown  and  bottom-up  approaches  in  close  collaboration  with  other \ndevelopment  partners  under  MOE  leadership  to  systematically \naddress urgent reform priorities. \n \n \n\nfrom  several  external \n\nincreasing  support \n\n\f \nObjective and Scope \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCost Estimate \n \n \n \nFinancing Plan \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\n \nThe  main  objective  of  the  ESRP  is  to  support  MOE  in  developing \nand  initiating  a  prioritized,  costed  NEDF  to  improve  efficiency, \nequity,  and  quality  of  primary  and  general  secondary  education. \nThe  ESRP  will  emphasize  system  efficiency  and  management \nimprovement  required  throughout  the  education  system  in order  to \nmake  the  education  system  more  affordable  and  sustainable.  The \nESRP  will  strengthen  policy  and  planning  capacity,  encompassing \nkey  aspects  of  management  efficiency  (pedagogical  renewal, \nfinancial management, and management reorganization). Improved \nefficiency  in  these  system  elements  will  support  enhanced  access \nand completion and improved quality. \n \nThe  ESRP  will  support  MOE  at  the  national  level  to  manage \neducation  reform,  and  at  the  district  level  it  will  support  five  pilot \ndistricts  for  school  improvement.  The  ESRP  will  have  a  direct \npositive  impact  on  Tajikistan\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  by \nimproving  equitable  access  to  and  completion  of  better  quality \nprimary  and  general  secondary  education  and  improved  gender \nbalance in school participation in the five pilot districts.  \n \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $9.375  million  equivalent,  of  which \n$4.184  million  (45%)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $5.191 \nmillion equivalent (55%) is the local currency cost. \n \n\nSource \n\nADB \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n4.184 \n       0 \n4.184 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n3.316 \n1.875 \n5.191 \n\n($ million equivalent)\n\n \nTotal \n7.500 \n1.875 \n9.375 \n\n \nPercent \n  80 \n  20 \n100 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n\n \nThe Government has requested ADB to mobilize cofinancing in the \nform of grants from other development partners to substitute for the \nloan  allocations  for  training,  consultancy  services,  and  project \nmanagement.  Once  grants  are  firmly  committed,  corresponding \nsavings  under  the  loan  may  be  cancelled  or  reallocated  as \nappropriate. \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  in  various  currencies, \nequivalent  to  $7.5  million  in  special  drawing  rights,  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including \na  grace  period  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  charge  of  1%  per  year \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter. The borrower \nwill be the Republic of Tajikistan. \n \nUntil 30 June 2009 \n \n31 December 2008 \n \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \nImplementation  \nArrangements \n \n \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nProcurement \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConsulting Services \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRisks and Assumptions \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \nThe  Implementing  Agency  will  be  MOE.  MOE  and  the  five  pilot \ndistrict departments of education will be responsible for day-to-day \nplanning,  management,  and  implementation  of  project  activities  in \nthe district. \n \nPresident\u2019s Office \n \nProcurement  of  ADB-financed  goods,  related  services,  and  civil \nworks  will  be  carried  out  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  Packages  of  equipment  and  textbooks  will  be \nprocured by international competitive bidding for contracts in excess \nof  $500,000;  international  shopping  for  contracts  in  excess  of \n$100,000; and direct purchase for contracts of less than $100,000. \nCivil  works  and  educational  equipment  will  be  carried  out  through \nlocal competitive bidding satisfactory to ADB. \n \nA  total  of  367  person-months  of  consulting  services  (44  person-\nmonths of international, including 20 for project management to be \nshared  with  the  health  sector  reform  project,  and  323  person-\nmonths of domestic) will be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other procedures acceptable to ADB for \nthe  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Consultants  will  be \nrecruited individually or through a firm. The quality- and cost-based \nselection method will be applied to consulting firms.  \n \nThe ESRP  will support MOE at the national level by strengthening \nthe  EMIS,  which  will  improve  MOE\u2019s  capacity  for  planning, \nbudgeting,  and  decision-making.  Management  training  programs \nwill  benefit  10  MOE  managers,  15  regional  managers,  30  district \nmanagers,  and  300  school  managers,  and  will  contribute  to \nstrengthening  management  capacity  at  all  levels.  At  the  district \nlevel, about 50% of the 300 schools in pilot districts will benefit from \nsome  form  of  physical  improvement  and  from  school  improvement \nfunds (SIFs) that help to improve equitable access to better-quality \nprimary  and  general  secondary  education.  More  than  6,000 \nteachers in pilot districts will also benefit from in-service training in \nmodern teaching methods. About 90,000 school children in grades \n1\u201311  will  have  access  to  better  quality  education.  Schools  in  pilot \ndistricts  will  benefit \nfrom  more  effective  school  governance, \nincluding  formation  of  and  effective  support  from  parent-teacher \nassociations. \n \nThe  project \nrisks.  First,  successful \nimplementation  depends  on  continuation  of  regular  government \nfinancial  support  to  the  pilot  districts,  system  rationalization,  and \nrealization  of  expected  funding  increases.  The  timely  and  full \nrelease  of  counterpart  funds  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  is  another \nimportant  element  in  successful  project  implementation.  Similarly, \nthe financial contribution of district education departments to SIFs is \ncritical  to  sustaining  this  approach  after  the  project  ends,  and  to \n\nthree  possible \n\nfaces \n\n\f \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTechnical Assistance \n \n \n\n \n\nv\n\nimproving school financing. \n \nSecond,  successful  implementation  depends  largely  on  MOE\u2019s \ncapacity to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate reform activities, \nincluding the establishment of an EMIS. In order to manage the risk \nto project outputs, the design includes technical assistance (TA) in \nkey  aspects  and  management  training  that  specifically  addresses \ncapacity building. \n \nThird,  the  ESRP  assumes  that  MOE  is  committed  to  significant \nrestructuring of education management. This commitment exists in \nvarious  policy  documents,  notably \nthe  National  Concept  on \nEducation  of  July  2002.  Without  such  restructuring,  inefficiencies \nwill endure, and the results of successful pilot projects may not be \nfed  into  systemic  reform.  The  ESRP  is  expected  to  lay  the \nfoundation for further reform. \n \nThe  purpose  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to  provide  strong \nlinks  between  project  design  and  implementation,  and  to  provide \nimpetus  for  building  EMIS  that  is  used  for  informed  policy  dialog, \ndecision-making,  and  monitoring.  The  TA\u2019s  objectives  are  to  (i) \nstreamline  EMIS  at  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE),  region,  and \ndistrict levels, (ii) set up EMIS frameworks in the five pilot districts, \n(iii)  support  a  national  school  census  of  all  primary  and  general \nsecondary  schools,  (iv)  improve  decision-making  at  all  levels,  and \n(v) support monitoring and evaluation at the MOE. The TA will serve \nas  a  central  policy  tool  to  improve  MOE\u2019s  annual  planning, \nbudgeting,  and  overall  decision-making  to  address  key  policy \npriorities.  ADB  will  finance  the  TA  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan \nSpecial  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  TA  is \nestimated  to  cost  $355,000  equivalent,  comprising  $238,000  in \nforeign  exchange  costs and  $117,000  equivalent  in local  currency. \nADB  will  provide  $300,000  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  currency \ncost  and  $62,000  of  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will \nprovide the remaining $55,000 equivalent in kind. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Tajikistan  for  the  Education  Sector  Reform  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  strengthening  planning  and  policy  dialogue  for  education  reform, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis  \n\nFollowing  cessation  of  economic  transfers  from  the  former  Soviet  Union  after \n2. \nindependence in 1991, ethnic pressures contributed to a civil war that began in 1992 and lasted \nuntil 1997. Macroeconomic conditions worsened until 1997 when the economy started showing \nsigns of recovery. Real gross domestic product (GDP) in 2002 was 60% of that in 1991. GDP \nper capita in 2001 was $162. Inflation, although lower than in the early 1990s, is still high, while \nreal  wages  have  decreased  significantly  since  1991.  The  aftermath  of  civil  war,  together  with \neconomic depression, has put more than 80% of the population below the national poverty line.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (PRSP),1  endorsed  by  the \n3. \nparliament  in  June  2002,  sets  out  efficient  and  fair  provision  of  basic  social  services  to \nvulnerable  groups  as  an  approach  to  reducing  poverty.  The  Government's  medium-term \nstrategy  has  been  set  in  line  with  the  poverty  reduction  strategy  under  its  poverty  partnership \nagreement  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  December  2002.  The  medium-term \nstrategy  stipulates  that,  for  social  sectors,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  focus  on  improving \nsocial  service  delivery  to  vulnerable  groups  and  rationalizing  social  sector  expenditures  to \nensure equitable access to quality education and health services. The Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) for 2015 form the key basis for the Government to monitor performance targets. \nThe project framework in Appendix 1 provides key project targets. \n \n4. \nThe  education  system  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  and  is \nadministered through a network of education departments in each of three regions (oblasts), as \nwell  as  in  Dushanbe,  in  the  Regions  of  Republican  Subordination  (RSS),  and  in  the  districts \n(raion). Compulsory basic education is 9 years, reduced from 11 years in 1996 due to resource \nconstraints.  It  is  free,  as  per  the  constitution,  and  consists  of  4  years  of  primary  (grades  1\u20134) \nand 5 years of lower secondary (grades 5\u20139). Upper secondary comprises grades 10 and 11. \nTechnical and vocational education and training is available after grade 9 (3 or 4 years) or after \ngrade 11 (2 years). Public and private institutions provide tertiary education, with increasing cost \nrecovery at both types of institutions.     \n \n5. \nTajikistan has a rapidly growing population, with children under 17 years old comprising \nalmost  50%  of  the  total  population  of  6.3  million  in  2000.  The  fertility  rate\u2014which  was  5.0  in \n1990 and declined to 3.7 in 2000\u2014remains the highest in Central Asia, and the population risks \ndoubling  every  20  years.  Primary  and  general  secondary  education  will  have  an  additional \n850,000  students  by  2015,  and  social  services  must  be  ready  to  accommodate  a  rapidly \ngrowing population.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. 2002. The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan. \n\n \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nTajikistan  is  committed  to  achieving  the  MDGs  as  stipulated  in  the  PRSP.  The \n6. \nGovernment  has  pledged  to  reduce  poverty  incidence  from  83%  of  the  population  in  1999  to \n58% by 2010 and improve the coverage of primary education from 78% in 2000 (a decline from \nover 90% in 1991) to 90% in 2015. The elimination of gender disparity in primary and general \nsecondary education, mainly in upper secondary (grades 10 and 11), may be possible only by \n2010 or later. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n7. \nTajikistan inherited a highly centralized education system with a well-developed network \nof educational institutions, well-trained and -qualified teachers, almost universal access to and \ngender  balance  in  compulsory  basic  education,  and  almost  universal  literacy  (Appendix  2). \nEducational indicators were comparable with middle-income countries. These achievements are \nnow threatened. \n \n8. \nDeclining Opportunities for Education. Following independence, declining resources \nand rising poverty have harmed the education system. Budget allocations to sustain the sector \nhave  been  constrained,  as  has  the  demand  for  education,  as  represented  by  the  opportunity \ncosts  of  participation  and  poor  employment  opportunities.  Enrollment  in  preschool  and  TVET \nhas collapsed, but increased 19% from 1991 to 2001 in primary and general secondary to more \nthan 1.5 million. This comes in spite of a decline in the gross enrollment ratio2 in basic education \nfrom 94.9% in 1990 to less than 84.3% in 2000. Gender imbalance is emerging particularly at \nthe  upper  secondary  level,  with  the  proportion  of  girls  declining  from  49%  in  1991  to  38%  in \n2001.  While  enrollment  has  declined  in  primary  education,  actual  attendance  may  be  even \nlower.  Many  qualified  teachers  have  left  the  profession  because  of  very  low  salaries.  Many \nstudents do not have textbooks or learning materials, and school buildings were badly damaged \nfrom the civil war and poor maintenance. More than 40% of parents have told surveys they are \ndissatisfied with education quality.3 The current generation in Tajikistan is at risk of receiving a \npoorer education than the previous one. \n \n9. \nNeed  for  a  Coherent  Vision  and  Strategy  for  Equitable,  Sustainable  Education. \nSince independence in 1991, a significantly reduced budget has been inadequate to sustain a \nhighly developed education system. The PRSP proposes new measures to address challenges \nfacing  the  sector.  Tajikistan  envisaged  some  decentralization  in  its  new  Law  on  Education \n(1994), but this strategy was largely employed to shift financial responsibility downward to local \ngovernments  and  parents  who  lack  commensurate  capacity,  conceptual  clarity,  or  resources. \nThe  Government  wants  to  introduce  a  new  financing  system,  involve  local  governments  and \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  improve  quality  through  various  measures,  and  make \nappropriate  legal  changes  and  amendments.  The  Government  needs  to  develop  a  coherent, \nrealistic vision and strategy given that the financial needs of the sector are not affordable within \nthe current economic context. \n \n10.  Weak  Information  Base  and  Poor  Capacity  to  Prioritize  Systemic  Reform  and \nAddress  Inherent  Inequities.  MOE  recognizes  gaps  in  the  information  systems  that  support \neducation  planning,  such  as  the  lack  of  information  on  learner  performance.  For  planning \npurposes, MOE has access only to broad averages on attendance and distribution of education \ninputs.  While  it  is  possible  to  analyse  resource  distribution  across  districts,  it  is  not  easy  to \n                                                 \n2   Gross enrollment ratio is the total number of children enrolled in school divided by the total school-age population. \nThe  primary  gross  enrollment  ratio  in  a  district  will  be  the  total  number  of  children  enrolled  in  primary  education \n(grades 1\u20134) divided by total number of children aged 7\u201310 in the district. \n\n3   ADB. 2000. Country Briefing Paper: Women in Tajikistan. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nanalyse  this  distribution  below  the  district  level.  MOE  has  weak  capacity  to  monitor  equitable \nparticipation  or  student  performance,  and  lacks  the  ability  to  plan  accordingly.  There  is  an \nalmost exclusive emphasis on quantitative information, such as the number of students enrolled \nper grade. There is little or no qualitative information on important aspects of education such as \nquality  of  education  management,  quality  of  teaching,  or  learner  performance.  The  level  of \neffective  utilization  of  data  for  planning  is  low.  For  example,  information  on  disparities  in \nexpenditure  by  region  and  district  is  not  used  to  correct  disparities.  Information  gathered  by \ninspectors  and  methodologists  is  not  used  to  design  retraining  programs  for  teachers. \nInformation  on  the  quality  of  school  management  is  not  used  to  design  training  programs  for \nschool  principals  and  parents\u2019  committees;  indeed,  few  such  programs  are  available.  Data \nexists within MOE but is not integrated for coherent strategies or plans.  \n \nBecause an integrated education management information system (EMIS) and adequate \n11. \ndistrict-based  information  systems  are  lacking,  it  is  difficult  to  ascertain  whether  education  is \nequitably  provided  across  or  within  districts.  Although  there  is  substantial  circumstantial \nevidence of inequities, these are difficult to quantify. If little is known about inequities in terms of \neducational inputs, less is known about variations in learning outcomes. It is therefore difficult, if \nnot impossible, to plan for increased equity or quality.  \n \n12. \nInequitable  Opportunities  for  Teaching  and  Learning.  The \neducation  system  that  was  conceived  and  developed  for  a  socialist  society  is  now  under \npressure  to  adapt  to  a  market-based,  internationally  competitive  society.  The  teaching \nprofession is unattractive because of low salaries, poor working conditions, and a lack of career \nopportunities.  The  overall  teacher-to-student  ratio  of  1:15,4  average  workload  of  14\u201318  hours \nper  week,  and  single-subject  specialization  of  teachers  in  grades  5\u201311  make  the  system \ninefficient  and  expensive,  and  it  absorbs  resources  that  could  be  used  to  improve  teacher \nsalaries or provide more textbooks. \n \n13.  MOE made efforts after independence, most recently in 2002, to add new subjects to the \ncurriculum and, in particular, to build national identity. However, the already heavy course load \nhas increased further with the introduction of new subjects. In some cases, the new curriculum \nrequires specialization to start from grade 5 instead of grade 9, as in the past. The curriculum \nmust be made more relevant to the issues dominating Tajikistan's current social, political, and \neducational  development,  such  as  the  movement  toward  a  market  economy;  a  transparent, \ndemocratic, and just society; attempts to improve system efficiency; and a focus on the quality \nof  learning  outcomes  in  schools.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  bring  efficiency  into  both  the \ncurriculum  development  system  and  the  actual  curriculum  through  further  reform  focused  on \nlearning  outcomes.  Curriculum  development  is  currently  coordinated  by  the  Department  of \nScience, which has relied on ad-hoc groups and is fragmented as a result. \n\nInadequate  and \n\n \nChildren in schools do not have necessary textbooks. Since independence, the supply of \n14. \nfree Soviet textbooks has ceased, and the civil war devastated the existing supply. Parents are \nunable  to  buy  books,  and  MOE  lacks  budget  to  provide  them.  MOE  has  been  struggling  to \naddress this problem. A rental scheme has been introduced to mobilize additional resources. \n\n  \n15. \nLimited  and  Inefficient  Financing.  The  Government  recognizes  that  tight  finances \npose a major challenge to education development. Public funding for education is generally tied \nto norms such as the number of teachers required according to the curriculum at each grade. \n\n                                                 \n4   Computed on the basis of data supplied by Statistical Department at MOE. The ratio was calculated by dividing the \n\ntotal number of students by the total number of teachers in Tajikistan in 2001. \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\nFunds  allocated  to  line  items  are  set  rigidly,  and  transfer  of  funds  across  line  items  is  limited. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) has just introduced unit costs per student to increase flexibility in \nspending.  Substantial  efforts  are  now  required  to  implement  per-capita  funding  to  enhance \nequity and efficiency linked to student outcomes. \n \n16. \nThe Government, under its PRSP, plans to gradually increase funding to education from \n2.4% of GDP in 2001 to 3.0% in 2004. However, there are regional disparities due to different \nrevenue bases of local governments and an insufficient budget\u2014particularly at the local levels, \ngiven  that  over  80%  funding  for  primary  and  general  secondary  education  comes  from  local \nbudgets\u2014to  address  such  disparities.  A  set  of  strategic  measures  is  needed,  to  increase \nresources  and  enhance  efficient  resource  use.  This  includes  identifying  and  reducing  system-\nwide inefficiencies, identifying and reducing high unit costs, developing alternative cost-effective \nmeasures  and  means,  streamlining  and/or  rationalizing  the  education  system,  establishing \n\u201cpartnerships,\u201d  generating  income,  obtaining  a  larger  proportion  of  the  national  budget,  and \nensuring  successful  reform.  Finally,  it  also  requires  reforming  the  incentive  system  and \nproviding greater flexibility on expenditure management to education institutions and managers \nat all levels. \n \nIn a national policy document, the Concept on Education,5 Tajikistan places high priority \n17. \non  reforming  and  modernizing  its  education  system.  The  PRSP  recognizes  that  education \ndevelopment  is  central  to  poverty  reduction.  Tajikistan  has  publicly  committed  itself  to  the \nEducation for All goals and increased educational spending as a percentage of GDP. \n \n18. \nLessons  Learned.  Experience  from  the  ongoing  social  sector  rehabilitation  project \nsuggests  that  project  management  needs  careful  design  and  qualified  staff  to  expedite \nimplementation  and  maintain  quality  work.  It  also  points  out  the  need  to  support  the \nimplementing agency (in this case, MOE), especially when major reforms are involved. Finally, \nhigher-level ownership and support is critical for successful implementation. Without appropriate \nsalaries,  performance-related  incentives,  training,  or  on-the-job  support,  it  is  difficult  to  ensure \ngood  performance  and  high  standards.  Effective  human  resource  management  at  the  district \nand  school  levels  requires  sufficient  delegation  of  authority  and  responsibility,  as  well  as \nappropriate  training  with  ongoing  supportive  supervision.  At  the  regional  level,  functional \nanalyses  will  be  important  in  identifying  service  and  staffing  needs  and  in  supporting  effective \nworkforce  planning  and  management.  Many  countries  in  Central  Asia  are  supporting \neducational  decentralization,  but  experience  shows  this  requires  a  strong  information  base, \nsupport for capacity building, and effective monitoring. \n \n19. \nEducation reform efforts since 1997 provide more lessons. While efforts such as training \nteachers,  developing  and  distributing  textbooks,  involving  parent-teacher  associations,  and \nrehabilitating  school  buildings  have  improved  the  education  sector,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to \nconsolidate  these  efforts  and  to  construct  a  national  education  system  to  (i)  modernize \ngovernance and management, and (ii) develop a curriculum that better prepares citizens for this \ncentury. There is also a need to develop capacity to improve availability and use of information \nto  plan  and  target  resources  at  reducing  inequities.  The  system  needs  to  identify  efficiency \nmeasures, and their linkages within the sector to use resources more effectively, as well as to \nrationalize the education system to ensure sustainable, relevant education post independence. \nTajikistan\u2019s  tight  fiscal  situation,  combined  with  high  adult  literacy,  provides  opportunities  to \nmobilize communities for school improvements. \n\n                                                 \n5  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  (2002).  National  Concept  on  Education  of  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan. \n\nDushanbe. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nFunding  Coordination.  A  major  project  strategy  is  to  pursue  a  unique  opportunity  to \n20. \ncollaborate  with  several  other  development  partners  under  the  newly  emerging  funding \ncoordination initiative (Appendix 3). Based on existing comparative advantage and experience, \ncollaboration  is  being  sought  to  complement  MOE-level  TA  for  capacity  building,  led  by  the \nUnited  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID);  school  improvement  funds  and \nteacher training, led by the Aga Khan Foundation; the EMIS, supported by the German Agency \nfor Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the Soros Foundation; textbook development, led by the \nSoros Foundation; community-based EMIS, supported by Save the Children Fund-UK and the \nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF);  and  baseline  student  assessment,  supported  by \nUNICEF.  The  Education  Sector  Reform  Project  (ESRP)  builds  on  ongoing  initiatives  and \ncomplements emerging initiatives from other development partners where there is potential for \nsynergy.  For  instance,  the  pilot  district  of  Roshkala  already  benefits  from  the  Aga  Khan \nFoundation\u2019s  support  in  social,  health,  and  education  services.  Similarly,  the  curriculum  and \ntextbook  development  work  under  the  ESRP  will  be  carried  out  in  close  collaboration  with  the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  parallel  support  to  textbook  policy.  The  ESRP  also  supports  MOE\u2019s  capacity  to \ncoordinate funding agencies.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nObjective \n\n21. \nThe  goal  of  the  ESRP  is  to  contribute  to  the  Government\u2019s  overall  strategic  goal  of \npoverty  reduction  by  improving  equitable  access  to,  and  completion  of,  quality  primary  and \ngeneral  secondary  education.  This  goal  focuses  on  girls and  vulnerable  groups, particularly  in \nrural areas. The ESRP\u2019s objective is to support MOE\u2019s education reform program by helping it to \ndevelop  a  prioritized,  costed  National  Education  Development  Framework  (NEDF)  to  improve \nefficiency, equity, and quality in primary and general secondary education.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n22. \nThe ESRP has three components: (i) system efficiency and management, (ii) equitable \naccess  and  completion,  and  (iii)  quality  improvement.  The  ESRP  will  have  national  and  pilot \ndistrict  components.  Pilot  components  will  be  implemented  in  five  rural  districts:  Roshkala,  in \nGorno Badakshan Autonomous Region (GBAR); Kulyab, in Khatlon Region; Ayni and Gornaya \nMatcha,  in  Sughd  Region;  and  Garm,  in  RRS.  The  pilot  districts  were  selected  based  on  the \nlevel and severity of poverty, the level of infant and maternal mortality, girls\u2019 enrollment rate, and \nproportion  of  female  teachers  (Appendix  4).  Geographical  variation  was  also  considered.  The \nESRP\u2019s goal will have a direct positive impact on Tajikistan\u2019s PRSP, and will target primary and \ngeneral secondary education, with particular focus on girls and vulnerable groups, contributing \nto  achievement  of  key  MDGs.  Parallel  implementation  of  the  ESRP  with  another  in  the  health \nsector  in  the  same  districts  will  particularly  benefit  community  mobilization,  child  health,  and \nearly education.  \n \n\n1. \n\nComponent 1: System Efficiency and Management \n\n23. \nImproved  system  efficiency  and  improved  management  are  required  throughout  the \neducation  system,  especially  given  that  the  current  system  is  unaffordable.  This  component \nconsists of three subcomponents described in the following paragraphs.  \n  \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\na. \n\nPolicy and Planning \n\n24. \nThe  policy  and  planning  subcomponent  provides  support  to  the  Department  for \nEducation Policy Development (DEPD) in MOE to develop an NEDF. The NEDF will coordinate \nvarious reform processes toward a broad national education agenda that contributes to national \ndevelopmental  goals  (economic  growth  and  a  vibrant  democracy)  as  well  as  to  specific \neducational  targets  (increased  net  enrollment,  particularly  for  girls  in  grades  10\u201311;  increased \nuse of modern pedagogical techniques; more parental control over local educational resources; \nhigh  expectations  of  all  learners;  better  children\u2019s  health  and  school  readiness;  improved \nefficiency of available resources). While the basic components of a framework were set out in \nan ADB-sponsored workshop (19\u201321 September 2002), DEPD will develop it to ensure that the \nNEDF informs government and nongovernment activity at all levels. The NEDF will also function \nas a tool to assess the impact of reform, an education investment decision support aid, and a \ndynamic learning device. The NEDF will be the product of a well-informed consultative process \ninvolving stakeholders at all levels, including parents and community leaders. It will draw from \nthe PRSP, build on the education public expenditure review, and be set within a medium-term \nexpenditure framework to be supported directly or indirectly by other development partners. The \nNEDF  will  pull  together  various  analyses  and  build  on  the  initiatives  of  the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners. \n \nThe  ESRP  will  support MOE  in  convening  four  task  teams:  (i)  a  financial  management \n25. \ntask  team  to  design  structures  and  systems  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  financial  decision \nmaking;  (ii)  a  pedagogical  renewal  task  team  to  support  curriculum  development,  teacher \ntraining, and instructional materials; (iii) a management reorganization task team, to design and \nmonitor  a  management  reorganization  framework  of  education  management  responsibilities; \nand  (iv)  an  information  and  evaluation  task  team  (IETT)  to  design  information  systems  for \nplanning.  DEPD  will  oversee  and  integrate  the  work  of  various  task  teams,  and  will  develop \nmedium-  and  long-term  education  development  plans  derived  from  the  NEDF.  The  education \ndevelopment  plans  will  be  outcomes-based,  and  will  contain  broad  performance  indicators  to \nallow  for  flexibility  in  implementation  at  local  and  institutional  levels.  The  ESRP,  in  close \ncollaboration with development partners, is expected to influence the development of secondary \nlegislation (decrees and regulations) and possible primary legislation\u2014to the extent feasible and \npractical\u2014as  an  effort  toward  longer-term  sustainable  development  of  the  education  sector \n(Appendix 5).  \n \n\nb. \n\nInformation Systems and Monitoring and Evaluation System \n\n26. \nThis  subcomponent  provides  for  the  construction  of  a  sound  EMIS,  as  well  as  a \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system  (MES)  that  will  (i)  provide  a  basis  for  improved  planning \nsystems,  (ii)  help  quantify  inequities  pertaining  to  gender  and  poverty,  and  (iii)  ensure  that \nanalyzed information is fed back into planning processes and system improvement.  \n \n27. \nThe  ESRP  will  strengthen  the  EMIS  to  improve  the  quality  of  information  available  to \nMOE, education departments at regional and district levels, and education institutions. Elements \nwill be incorporated into the EMIS to quantify inequities and to support school rationalization, in \nsuch  a  way  that  the  overall  cost  and  policy  implications  of  school  rationalization  can  be \nexamined at various levels throughout the system.  \n \nThe  ESRP  provides  for  the  design  and  implementation  of  an  MES.  Standards  and \n28. \nperformance indicators for various key activities (learning, teaching, management, and support) \nand  actors  (pupils,  teachers,  school  directors,  department  heads,  and  deputy  ministers) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nthroughout  the  system  are  key  to  the  success  of  the  MES.  Results  should  also  be \ndisaggregated  by  gender.  Various  policy  documents  refer  to  the  need  for  new  standards  of \nlearning achievement; however, development of a culture of quality standards for other aspects \nof  the  system  is  equally  important.  For  example,  the  ESRP  will  allow  development  of  new  job \ndescriptions for teachers and education managers, and standards of expected performance and \nrelated indicators. Information on achievement in terms of standards and performance indicators \nwill be crucial and will drive the overall pedagogical renewal effort. The MES will be designed to \nprovide  feedback  against  these  standards  and  indicators,  and  in  this  way  will  give  important \ninformation  about  the  success  of  the  reform  process  and  possible  enhancements.  It  will  also \nhelp  IETT  to  analyze  the  differential  project  impacts  and  provide  suggestions  on  upscaling \nproject activities. The crucial challenge in this component is to develop a culture of learning at \nall  levels  of  the  system  (including  parents  and  MOE  staff),  by  ensuring  that  level-appropriate \ntypes and formats of information are available for continued planning. \n \n\nc. \n\nManagement Development \n\nThe  management  development  subcomponent  provides  for  training  for  education \n29. \nmanagers to develop competence in policy and planning, EMIS and MES, pedagogical renewal, \nand  financial  management  (Appendix  6).  The  management  program  will  be  based  on  a  clear \ndefinition  of  competence,  encapsulated  in  program  outcomes,  assessment  criteria,  and \nthe  successful  completion  of \nperformance  requirements.  Credits  will  be  awarded \nmanagement  programs,  and,  with  careful  attention  to  the  logical  combination  of  topics,  such \ncredits can be accumulated as qualifications for different categories of education management \n(for  example,  financial  planning).  An  international  academic  institution  will  be  identified  to \ndevelop  14  management  development  modules  with  inputs  from  key  MOE  officials,  and  the \ntraining  will  be  delivered  through  a  national  institution.  About  10  MOE  managers,  15  regional \nmanagers,  30  district  managers,  and  300  school  managers  will  receive  management \ndevelopment  training.  About  10  officials  will  receive  overseas  training  associated  with  the \nmanagement development program. \n \n\nfor \n\n2. \n\nComponent 2: Increasing Equitable Access and Completion \n\nThe ESRP is designed to increase equitable access to and completion of education, with \n30. \nfocus  on  girls  and  vulnerable  groups,  using  school  mapping  as  a  central  strategy.  Building  on \nthe  EMIS  development,  a  detailed  mapping  exercise  will  define  the  scope  of  rationalization, \nleading  where  necessary  to  the  closure  of  unsustainable  schools.  The  mapping  exercise  will \nalso generate two key rankings of schools in the target districts: a rehabilitation index (para. 32) \nand a poverty index (para. 33). The indexes will be used to allocate school rehabilitation funds \n(SRFs)  and  school  improvement  funds  (SIFs).  The  strategy  will  be  supported  through  school \ncommunity  mobilization  (para.  34).  Together,  the  two  indexes  will  create  an  overall  index  of \nschool need. The index of school need, once it has been pilot tested in the target districts, will \nform the basis for policy and planning in the education system as a whole. The funding formulas \ndeveloped by the ESRP will be used to ensure that schools are funded in a manner that reflects \ntheir needs and the relative cost of addressing the needs, taking into account that rehabilitation \ncosts  may  be  greater  than  quality  improvement  costs.  Crucially,  the  funding  formulas  will  be \nused to improve the budgeting process. All components will be planned within the information \nfor  planning \nfinancial \nmanagement framework. \n\nthe  monitoring  and  evaluation \n\nframework,  and \n\nframework, \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\na. \n\nSchool Mapping \n\n31. \nThe school mapping subcomponent supports a comprehensive school- and district-level \nbaseline  survey  to  compare  pre-  and  post-project  cases.  Baseline  information  has  two \ndimensions:  (i)  quantitative,  generating  hard  data  on  the  location,  distribution,  and  physical \ncondition  of  schools;  and  (ii)  qualitative,  generating  a  comprehensive  gender-disaggregated \nanalysis of learner achievement as well as social and other barriers to schooling. These barriers \nmay  include  factors  such  as  gender  discrimination,  poverty  constraints,  transport  difficulties, \nclimate,  and  poor  health.  School  mapping  will  generate  various  outputs:  (i)  an  analysis  of  the \ndistribution of schools and constraints to access and retention of girls and vulnerable groups, (ii) \nan analysis of school rehabilitation needs and of school poverty at individual schools, and (iii) an \nanalysis  of  learner  achievement.  District-level  mapping  will  generate  a  school  rationalization \nplan,  and  will  help  to  rank  all  schools  in  terms  of  poverty  and  rehabilitation  needs.  A  physical \nsurvey  was  already  undertaken  in  Garm  (RSS)  during  project  preparation.  The  UNICEF-Save \nthe  Children  initiative  in  community-based  EMIS  will  also  be  a  model  for  this  component.  The \nexperience gained by ADB, Save the Children, and UNICEF will be examined. The component \nwill help indicate how school mapping can be replicated nationally to enrich the national EMIS \n(para. 27) and MES (para. 28). \n \n\nb. \n\nSchool Rehabilitation \n\n32. \nThrough the school mapping exercise (para. 31), schools in target districts will be ranked \nin  terms  of  rehabilitation  needs.  About  95  schools  will  be  rehabilitated:  40  will  receive  minor \nrehabilitation  ($10,000  equivalent  per  school),  30  will  see  major  rehabilitation  ($30,000 \nequivalent  per  school),  and  25  will  have  extensions  where  classrooms  are  severely  damaged \n($10,000  equivalent  per  school).  The  index  of  school  rehabilitation  will  be  used  to  allocate \nweighted and specified SRFs to the districts, or directly to schools with capacity to manage the \nfunds.  Schools  serving  poorer  populations  will  be  allocated  greater  amounts.  SRFs  will  be \nallocated  particularly  for  school  rehabilitation,  and  will  be  tied  to  a  school\u2019s  ranking  on  the \nrehabilitation  index.  Schools  would  receive  the  SRF  directly  if  they  have  produced  a  school \nimprovement plan (SIP)6 and can demonstrate their capacity to implement it. The evaluation of \nSIPs  will  be  based  on  simple  criteria:  it  must  be  the  product  of  a  widely  consultative  effort \namong  school  and  community  stakeholders,  and  there  must  be  mechanisms  to  ensure \ntransparency,  accuracy,  and  accountability  in  financial  management.  TA  will  be  provided  to \nsupport  the  overall  SIP  process  at  the  district  and  school  levels,  particularly  with  respect  to \nschool mapping, planning, and local procurement. \n \n\nc. \n\nSchool Improvement \n\n33. \nThe  strategy  for  school  improvement  is  similar  to  the  strategy  for  school  rehabilitation. \nSchools in the target districts will first be ranked in terms of poverty through the school mapping \nexercise  (para.  31).  The  ranking  will  be  based  on  key  factors,  including  the  proportion  of  girls \nand female teachers, local income levels, child health, and water and sanitation conditions. The \nindex of school poverty will be used to allocate SIFs to the districts (or directly to schools if there \nis capacity to manage the funds). The SIFs will be weighted in the same manner as the SRFs \n(para. 32). The evaluation of the SIPs will be based on similar criteria to those applied for the \n\n                                                 \n6   School  improvement  planning,  which  is  used  in  several  countries  around  the  world,  is  being  proposed  as  an \ninstrument  to  strengthen  school-level  governance,  management,  and  financing  to  support  improvements  in  key \npriority areas identified by the school community. The SIF, including SRF, is a funding mechanism to support SIP \nproposals from participating schools for improvements in areas consistent with project objectives. The SIP and SIF \nsupport will build on the current experience in Tajikistan. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nSRFs,  and  appropriate  TA  will  be  provided  to  ensure  sound  financial  management  and \nreporting,  among  other  things.  Up  to  150  schools  in  the  pilot  districts  may  receive  SIFs  of  as \nmuch as $10,000 equivalent. Up to $2,500 equivalent may be spent for minor repair and up to \n$7,500  equivalent  on  learning  materials  (mainly  for  libraries),  teaching  aids,  basic  equipment \n(chalkboards  and  sports  materials),  and  school  attendance  and  retention  schemes,  including \nsynergy on child health with activities under the health sector reform project (HSRP). \n \n\nd. \n\nCommunity Mobilization  \n\n34. \nUnder  this  subcomponent,  community-level  stakeholders  will  be  encouraged  to  take \ncharge of the educational well-being of their children, empowering them to (i) participate in the \neducational  process  by  developing  and  implementing  SIPs,  as  well  as  managing  SRFs  and \nSIFs;  (ii)  make  demands  on  the  system;  (iii)  hold  the  system  accountable  for  results;  and  (iv) \nappoint people at the village level to support the improvement process. These are major steps \nin democratizing the education system and curbing corruption, as well as contributing to school \nimprovement  with  focus  on  gender  equity,  school  health,  and  quality.  The  ESRP  will  support \ncommunity mobilization in each pilot district to organize targeted public information campaigns \nsupporting equitable access and quality improvement. In many cases, the ESRP will not be the \nonly community-level reform effort under way, so synergy of effort and economies of scale must \nbe  ensured.  In  each  pilot  district,  a  community  change  agent  will  be  identified  to  play  a  major \nrole in this regard. The change agent will be accountable to the appointing committee, which will \ncomprise  elected  representatives  of  parent-teacher  associations.  In  the  long  term,  funding \narrangements for change agents will come from SIFs, and village schools can decide whether to \ninvest in this strategy or not. \n \n\n3. \n\nComponent 3: Improving Quality Education \n\n35. \nThis  component  is  designed  to  improve  the  quality  of  education  through  teacher \ndevelopment,  curriculum  development,  and  improved  teaching  and  learning  materials.  Key \nsubcomponents are described in the following paragraphs. \n \n\na. \n\nTeacher Training \n\n36. \nThis subcomponent will draw up a detailed action plan to implement the teacher-training \nelement  of  the  pedagogical  renewal  framework  (PRF).  The  action  plan  will  include  (i)  a \nframework  of  teacher  standards  to  guide  the  design  of  accredited  pre-  and  in-service  teacher \ntraining  programs;  (ii)  a  teacher  appraisal  system  that  will  form  part  of  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation framework (para. 28); (iii) mechanisms to ensure that the results of teacher appraisal \nfeed  into  the  district-level  EMIS  and  into  planning  for  improvement;  (iv)  incentives  (monetary \nand  nonmonetary)  to  ensure  that  teachers  who  successfully  complete  in-service  training  and \nimplement  the  new  competencies  are  rewarded;  and  (v)  strategies  to  attract  and  retain  more \nfemale teachers. Provided that all the action plans meet the outcomes set out in the PRF, the \nvarious  districts  may  pilot  different  approaches  interweaving  standards,  appraisal,  incentives, \nand accredited teacher-training programs, though the standards should be uniform. Over 6,000 \nteachers,  including  all  female  teachers  in  primary  and  general  secondary  schools  in  pilot \ndistricts,  will  receive  in-service  training.  District-level  action  plans  should  be  developed  in  a \nparticipatory  manner,  with  focus  on  increasing  the  numbers  of  girls  in  grades  10  and  11  and \nfemale  teachers.  The  results  of  the  evaluation  of  the  different  strategies  will  feed  into  the \nrefinement  of  the  PRF  and  the  NEDF.  Strategies  for  servicing  remote  rural  areas  will  be \nemphasized. \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\nb. \n\nCurriculum Development \n\n37. \nA  detailed  action  plan  will  be  drawn  up  and  implemented  to  support  the  curriculum \ndevelopment  element  of  the  PRF  building  on  MOE\u2019s  new  curriculum  (2002).  The  action  plan \nshould  include  (i)  a  framework  of  competence-based  learner  achievement  standards  (generic \nand  subject-specific)  that  will  guide  the  design  of  the  curriculum  and  of  teaching  and  learning \nmaterials; (ii) a learner assessment system that will form part of the monitoring and evaluation \nframework  (para.  28);  (iii)  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  the  results  of  learner  assessments  feed \ninto the district-level EMIS and into planning for improvement; and (iv) nonmonetary incentives \nto  ensure  that  learner  achievement  is  stimulated  continuously  and  not  only  rewarded  through \ncertification. Two core curriculum subjects in grades 5\u201311 will be renewed to reflect state-of-the-\nart  teaching  and  learning  practices.  As  with  teacher  training,  all  action  plans  must  meet  the \noutcomes set out in the PRF, but the various districts may pilot different approaches provided \nthat learner achievement standards are uniform. District-level action plans should be developed \nin a participatory manner, in parallel with plans for teacher training. As with teacher training, the \nresults of evaluating the different strategies will support refinements to the PRF and NEDF.  \n \n\nc. \n\nTeaching and Learning Materials \n\n38. \nA policy on teaching and learning materials will be developed as an element of the PRF, \nas well as a strategy for implementation. The policy and strategy will encompass (i) standards \nfor  producing  teaching  and  learning  materials,  (ii)  linking  between  standards  of  learner \nachievement  and  teaching  standards,  (iii)  commissioning  and  approval  systems  that  eliminate \npossible corruption, (iv) cost-effective production and distribution systems, and (v) mechanisms \nfor  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  quality  of  teaching  and  learning  materials  that  feed  into  the \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  framework.  Two  core  curriculum  subjects  for  grades  5\u201311  will  be \ntargeted for textbook distribution, which will support MOE\u2019s textbook rental scheme. Results of \nevaluations will help to refine the PRF and NEDF.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n39. \nAt  the  national  level,  the  ESRP  provides  an  inclusive  system  reform  framework \n(Appendix 7). This framework will allow key MOE officials to seek TA to identify priority areas of \nreforms  and  to  address  them  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  priorities  through  a  more \nconsultative and analytical process. This approach is expected to enhance MOE\u2019s ownership of \nthe reform process. \n \n40. \nAt  the  district  level,  the  ESRP  relies  on  school  mapping  information  to  rank  schools \nbased  on  poverty  and  rehabilitation,  including  gender  equity  and  school  health,  an  approach \nunique to Tajikistan. This is expected to channel support to the most needy schools (para. 31). \nSupport  to  school  improvement  plans  will  strengthen  the  financing  process,  and  will  provide  a \nmechanism to link funding to school improvement. \n \n41. \nTajikistan is a transition economy, where the move from rigid central planning to a more \nopen  market  environment  has  created  many  challenges  to  education.  To  cope  with  these \nchanges, the ESRP supports policy and institutional reforms, including (i) reorienting education \nservice delivery by strengthening the capacity of schools; (ii) strengthening MOE\u2019s ability to plan \nand  target  resources;  (iii)  refocusing  budget  preparation  from  norm-based  to  per-capita \nallocation;  and  (iv)  promoting  accelerated  system  rationalization.  DEPD\u2019s  capacity  to  manage \neducation reform will be considerably strengthened. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n42. \nThe  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $9.38  million  equivalent,  of  which  an  estimated \n$4.18  million,  or  45%,  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost.  The  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at \n$5.20  million  equivalent,  or  55%  of  the  total  cost.  Cost  estimates  by  component  are  shown  in \nTable 1 with details in Appendix 8.  \n \n\nTable 1.

The  loan  will  be  repayable  over  32  years,  with  a  grace \nperiod of 8 years. It will bear an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. The borrower will be the Government of Tajikistan. ADB will finance \n100%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  totaling  45%  of  total  project  cost,  and  64%  of  the  local \ncurrency  cost  or  $3.316  million  equivalent.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $1.88 \nmillion equivalent as counterpart financing, which accounts for 20% of the total project cost. This \nincludes financing civil works, taxes and duties, training, workshops, surveys, studies, and other \nrecurrent costs. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 2.

At the consultative group \nmeeting held in Dushanbe in May 2003, development partners pledged $900 million for the next \n3 years, including $700 million in grants. ADB has been actively seeking grants to substitute for \nsome of the loan proceeds. As grant funds are firmly committed, corresponding savings under \nthe loan may be canceled or reallocated. Potential grant financing is indicated in Appendix 9. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements   \n\n1. \n\nProject Management  \n\nThe ESRP will be implemented in parallel with the proposed HSRP in the same five pilot \n45. \ndistricts.  The  ESRP\u2019s  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  President\u2019s  Office,  and  a  deputy  prime \nminister  will  serve  as  the  project  coordinator.  A  national  steering  committee\u2014chaired  by  the \ndeputy  prime  minister  and  comprising  senior  officials  from  MOE,  the  Ministry  of  Health,  MOF, \nand  governors  of  the  pilot  districts\u2014will  be  established  to  coordinate  policy  reform,  address \nimplementation  bottlenecks,  and  provide  overall  project  guidance.  The  steering  committee  will \nmeet quarterly and be responsible for approving the annual project budget and work plans, as \nwell as reviewing and advising on implementation. \n \n46. \nA  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be  set  up  at  MOE  with  three  full-time  staff  to \nundertake  technical  project  functions  in  full  consultation  with  the  four  task  teams  (financial \nmanagement, organizational restructuring, pedagogical renewal, and EMIS and MES). The PIU \nwill be supported by a project administration unit (PAU) to be shared by PIUs at MOE and the \nMinistry of Health to manage procurement, consultants, training, reports on disbursement, and \nmonitoring  of  pilot  districts.  The  PIU,  with  support  from  PAU,  will  organize  quarterly \nimplementation review meetings jointly with the task teams. The PIU will engage part-time staff \nas needed. \n \n47. \nEach of the five pilot districts will have a district supervisory group, shared by the ESRP \nand HSRP, comprising the district governor, the chief medical doctor at the district hospital, the \ndirector  of  the  district  department  of  education,  two  village  leaders,  two  school  directors,  and \ntwo  doctors  or  health  specialists.  The  group  will  coordinate  district-level  activities  and  ensure \nsynergy between education and health. In each pilot district, the education department will serve \nas the district PIU, comprising a district project coordinator, procurement/civil engineer, and an \nadministrator responsible for district-level implementation and day-to-day management. Project \nmanagement  and  monitoring  capacities  will  be  strengthened  at  the  MOE\u2019s  PIU,  the  PAU,  and \nthe district supervisory group and district PIU through targeted staff training. The implementation \narrangements, elaborated in Appendix 10, will promote MOE\u2019s ownership of and commitment to \neducation reform.  \n \n48.  Mobilizing  parallel  grant  funds  in  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  request  will  result  in  a \nvariety  of  financing  sources  and  will  impose  an  additional  degree  of  difficulty  in  implementing \nand  coordinating  the  ESRP.  Coordination  of  external  funding  agencies  must  be  enhanced  to \ncomplement the roles of the PIU and PAU. \n \n49.  Management  Training  Programs.  Management  development  programs  will  be \ndesigned and delivered by (i) an international academic institution with experience in education \nmanagement  development,  (ii)  a  local  public  training  institute,  and  (iii)  consultants  working \nunder  the  relevant  components.  Key  members  of  task  teams  will  be  supported  by  consultants \nand will receive targeted, short-term, out-of-country training. Management training modules will \nbe  developed  by  an  international  academic  institution  and  will  be  delivered  through  a  local \npublic training institute. \n \n50. \nImplementation of SIPs, SIFs, and SRFs. Each school in the pilot district will be invited \nto submit a simple SIP proposal for SRFs and SIFs. The education department, with project TA, \nwill review  proposals and identify eligible schools. Schools identified to receive SRFs are also \neligible to receive SIFs for instructional materials for teachers, libraries, chalkboards, and sports \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nequipment.  Each  school  identified  to  receive  the  SIF  will  be  informed  officially  by  the  district \ndepartment  of  education  and  will  sign  a  letter  indicating  its  contributions  and  commitment  to \nimplement the funds. Funds to the schools receiving such support will be channeled through the \ndistrict  department  of  education,  or  to  the  school  directly  if  it  has  the  requisite  capacity. \nInternational NGOs with experience in school improvement and community mobilization will be \nengaged to support this activity. The district PIU will organize audits of SIFs and submit reports \nto the national-level PIU. About 25% of the funds available for SIFs will be committed before the \nmidterm  review.  The  midterm  review  will  include  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  SIFs  and \npropose  improvements.  The  remaining  75%  of  funds  will  be  disbursed  after  improvements \nrecommended in the midterm review.  \n  \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe ESRP will be implemented over 5 years. A tentative implementation schedule is in \n\n51. \nAppendix 11.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n52. \nADB-financed  goods,  related  services,  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Packages of equipment and textbooks will be procured \nthrough  international  competitive  bidding  for  contracts  in  excess  of  $500,000,  international \nshopping  for  contracts  in  excess  of  $100,000,  and  direct  purchase  for  contracts  of  less  than \n$100,000.  Civil  works  and  procurement  of  basic  educational  equipment  will  be  carried  out \nthrough  local  competitive  bidding  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  indicative  contract  packages  are  in \nAppendix 12. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\nA total of 367 person-months of consulting services (44 person-months of international, \n53. \nincluding  20  for  project  management  to  be  shared  with  the  HSRP,  and  323  person-months  of \ndomestic)  will  be  recruited  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \nprocedures acceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will \nbe recruited individually (for project management and for specific technical expertise) or through \na  firm.  Quality-  and  cost-based  selection  will  be  applied  to  consulting  firms.  Appendix  13 \nprovides indicative terms of reference and consultancy requirements. \n \n\n5. \n\nContracting Institutions \n\n54. \nApart  from  consulting  services,  an  international  academic  institution  for  developing \nmanagement development modules and supporting a national academic institution in delivering \ntraining  will  be  identified  and  engaged  competitively  according  to  procedures  satisfactory  to \nADB.  Experienced  international  NGOs  will  be  engaged  to  support  MOE  and  the  districts  in \nimplementing  SIFs  and  mobilizing  communities.  If  international  NGOs  have  experience  and \ndistinct  comparative  advantages  over \nthey  will  be  contracted \ncompetitively to support MOE and the districts. \n \n\nindividual  consultants, \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\nThe  PIU  will  establish  an  imprest  account  in  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  to \n55. \nexpedite  disbursement  of  the  loan  proceeds,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook  and  detailed  arrangements  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  Government \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\nmay  make  withdrawals  from  the  imprest  account  for  PIU  and  district  supervisory  staff  costs; \ntraining, seminars, and studies; locally available materials; domestic consultants; and civil works \ncontracts  under  local  competitive  bidding.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest \naccount will not exceed $250,000. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures will be followed \nto liquidate the imprest account and reimburse individual payments that do not exceed $50,000. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  project  implementation  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \n56. \nproject performance report and submit them to ADB within 30 days of the end of the applicable \nperiod. Within 3 months of physical completion, the PIU will submit a project completion report \nto ADB. Separate records and accounts for all expenditures financed out of the proceeds of the \nloan  will  be  maintained  by  the  PAU  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  Auditors \nacceptable to ADB will audit project accounts, financial statements, statements of expenditures, \nand imprest account records annually. The audit report should be submitted to ADB in English \nnot later than 6 months after the fiscal year to which it relates.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  System (PPMES)     \n\n57. \nThe  EMIS  and  baseline  data  will  provide  a  foundation  for  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nWithin the EMIS framework, the EMIS and MES consultants will work closely with the PIU and \nPAU  to  establish  a  comprehensive  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system \n(PPMES)  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PPMES  will  help  monitor  project  activities  and  regular \neducation  data  pertaining  to  primary  and  general  secondary  education.  The  ESRP  monitoring \nwill (i) assess the ESRP\u2019s technical performance; (ii) evaluate delivery of planned activities; (iii) \nmeasure project impacts; (iv) measure social and economic benefits with a focus on vulnerable \ngroups,  including  women  and  the  disabled;  and  (v)  monitor  achievement  of  project  targets. \nMonitoring  of  primary  and  general  secondary  education  will  provide  regular  information  on \nstudents,  teachers,  facilities,  financing,  and  efficiency.  The  baseline  information  will  allow \ncomparing  progress  made  by  schools  in  pilot  districts  from  the  beginning  of  the  ESRP  to  the \nend,  and  EMIS  data  will  provide  a  comparative  picture  between  pilot  and  nonpilot  districts. \nPPMES indicators and the baseline data will serve as a basis for assessing differential impacts \nand  help  develop  strategies  for  expanding  pilot  activities  and  preparing  reports  on  project \nimplementation and reform process, including (i) fiscal impacts, (ii) improved use of resources, \n(iii) change in access to services (in particular for females and vulnerable groups), (iv) improved \nservice  quality,  (v)  client  satisfaction,  and  (vi)  progress  on  rationalization.  Some  indicators  will \nbe  monitored  through  project-financed  surveys;  other  indicators  will  be  monitored  through \nregular administrative and financial data drawn from the EMIS. Where feasible, indicators will be \ndisaggregated  by  socioeconomic  level  and  gender.  A  list  of  key  performance  indicators  is  in \nAppendix 14. \n \n58. \nThe  IETT  will  generate  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework,  and  evaluate  and \nredesign the process of building an MES, supported by relevant research and international/local \nTA. The IETT will produce a yearly monitoring and evaluation report with short-, medium-, and \nlong-term goals, objectives, and performance indicators. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nThe Government and ADB will jointly conduct two annual reviews. The Government and \n59. \nADB will jointly establish the issues to be addressed during each mission and reports required. \nA  midterm  review  of  implementation  arrangements,  with  a  focus  on  a  few  key  issues,  will  be \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\ncarried out by the Government and ADB 18 months into implementation or later, depending on \nprogress. ADB and the Government will consider changes based on the findings of the review. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n\n60. \nThe purpose of the TA is to provide impetus for building EMIS for informed policy dialog, \ndecision-making, and system monitoring. The objectives of the TA are to (i) streamline EMIS at \nthe  MOE,  region,  and  district  levels,  (ii)  set  up  EMIS  frameworks  in  the  five  pilot  districts,  (iii) \nsupport  a  national  school  census  of  all  primary  and  general  secondary  schools,  (iv)  improve \ndecision-making at all levels, and (v) support monitoring and evaluation at the MOE. The TA will \nserve as a central policy tool to improve MOE\u2019s annual planning and budgeting. Baseline data \nwill help plan project activities, monitor performance, and measure impacts. The TA will finance \n9  months  of  international  consulting  services  and  70  months  of  domestic  consulting  with \nexpertise in EMIS, surveys, and database management. EMIS consultants will work closely with \nthe  monitoring  and  evaluation  consultants.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  18  months. \nAppendix  15  provides  detailed  information  on  the  proposed  TA.  Consultants  will  be  engaged \nindividually according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. For domestic consultants, \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB will be used. \n \n61. \nADB  will  finance  the  TA  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA is estimated to cost $355,000 equivalent, comprising $238,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $117,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide $300,000 to \nfinance the entire foreign currency cost and $62,000 of local currency cost. The Government will \nprovide the remaining $55,000 equivalent in kind. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nProject Benefits \n\n62. \nThe ESRP  will have a  positive impact on primary and general secondary education by \nimproving  efficiency  and  quality  of  education  and  helping  to  reduce  large  discrepancies  in \naccess, particularly for girls and vulnerable groups. The expected impact will be achieved by (i) \ninvolving school communities in organizing training, and equipping and rehabilitating education \nfacilities; (ii) campaigning to improve education quality and relevance; (iii) facilitating an increase \nin and targeting of budget allocation to school education; (iv) enabling pro-poor strategies at the \ndistrict  level  through  poverty  indexing  that  will  primarily  benefit  the  lower  half  of  the  poorer \npopulation in five of the poorest districts; and (v) enhancing the capacity of education personnel  \nto  work  for  girls  and  vulnerable  groups  at  all  levels.  The  focus  on  gender  equity  and  school \nhealth  through  community  mobilization  and  school  improvement  will  enhance  the  children\u2019s \ncapacity to attend school regularly and improve their performance. \n \n63. \nAt the national level, the ESRP will support MOE with the development of an NEDF to \nprioritize  education  reform  and  strengthen  the  EMIS  and  MES  to  improve  policy  analysis  and \nannual planning, budgeting, monitoring, and overall decision-making. The management training \nprograms will benefit 10 MOE managers, 15 regional managers, 30 district managers, and 300 \nschool directors, and will contribute to strengthening management competency and capacity at \nall levels. At the district level, about 50% of the 300 schools in five of the poorest districts will \nbenefit from SIFs that will help to improve equitable access to better quality primary and general \nsecondary education. Over 6,000 teachers, including all female teachers in the pilot districts, will \nalso benefit from in-service training in modern teaching methods. About 90,000 school children \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\nin grades 1\u201311 will have access to better-quality school education. About 50% of the schools in \nthe pilot districts will benefit from some form of physical improvement. \n \nB. \n\nProject Risks \n\n64. \nThe  ESRP  faces  three  possible  risks,  particularly  in  the  short  term.  Financially, \nsuccessful implementation depends on continuation of regular government financial support to \nthe  pilot  districts  (paras.  74  and  75),  rationalization  of  the  system,  and  realization  of  funding \nincreases  expected  (para.  17).  The  timely  and  full  release  of  counterpart  funds  by  MOF  is \nanother  important  element  in  successful  implementation  (para.  85).  Similarly,  the  financial \ncontribution of district departments of education to SIFs is critical to sustain this approach, even \nafter the ESRP, and to improve financing to schools.   \n \n65. \nSuccessful  implementation  depends  largely  on  MOE\u2019s  capacity  to  plan,  develop, \nimplement, and evaluate system reforms, including the establishment of an EMIS. Involvement \nof the President\u2019s Office and shared implementation arrangements with the HSRP based on an \nexperienced PAU offset somewhat the complicated implementation arrangements and the risks \narising from the Government\u2019s reluctance to borrow for training, consulting services, or project \nmanagement (para. 44). Any effort to further reduce the provision for these activities may pose \na serious risk to implementation. The national steering committee needs to pay close attention \nto and support the strengthening of MOE capacity to implement project activities and associated \nreforms.  \n \n66. \n The  ESRP  assumes  MOE  is  committed  to  significant  restructuring  of  education \nmanagement. This commitment is expressed in various policy documents, notably the National \nConcept  on  Education  of  July  2002  (para.  17).  Without  such  restructuring,  inefficiencies  will \nendure,  and  the  results of  successful  pilot  projects  in  the  target  districts  may  not  contribute  to \nsystemic reform. The ESRP is expected to lay the foundation for further reform. \n \nC. \n\nEnvironment \n\n67. \nThe  ESRP  falls  under  environmental  category  \"C;\"  i.e.,  the  screening  process  during \nproject  preparation  identified  no  adverse  environmental  impacts.  Appendix  16  provides  a  brief \nsummary of the initial environmental assessment. \n \nD. \n\nSocial Analysis \n\n68. \nThe  ESRP  aims  to  increase  equity  and  effectiveness  in  the  provision  of  educational \nbenefits by focusing on five pilot districts disadvantaged by natural disasters, civil strife, poverty, \nand vulnerable minority populations. Women and girls are also a specific focus. The ESRP will \nset up social measures likely to benefit the vulnerable groups, women, and children based on \ncomprehensive school mapping in each pilot district. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy form is in Appendix 17. \n \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n69. \nPoverty  remains  Tajikistan\u2019s  central  development  issue.  Tajikistan  was  one  of  the \npoorest republics even before the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, despite large annual \nbudget transfers from Moscow. The economic collapse of the early 1990s and subsequent civil \nstrife  caused  poverty  to  intensify  and  spread.  About  83%  of  the  population  was  below  the \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\npoverty line in 1999.7 Poverty rates were high for households with many children, widows with \nsmall  children,  the  unemployed,  people  without  access  to  any  kind  of  social  safety  net  (the \ndisabled,  school  dropouts,  street  children,  and  the  elderly),  single  pensioners,  returnees,  and \ninternally displaced people. Rural areas have higher and deeper incidences of poverty, and the \ndirect incidences of poverty occur in remote mountainous areas where the population is mostly \nvery young or elderly. The five pilot districts are considered among the poorest in Tajikistan, and \nthe lower half of the population is intended to benefit more from the ESRP than the upper half. \n \nPoverty  manifests  itself  in  different  forms,  and  disproportionately  affects  vulnerable \n70. \ngroups  in  the  education  sector.  Meager  budgetary  allocations  to  education,  as  well  as  formal \nand  informal  charges  at  different  levels,  mean  that  the  lowest  economic  quintile  has  to \ncontribute 17.0% of household income to education, compared to just 5.3% for the top quintile. \nPreschool  enrollment,  particularly  of  children  from  poor  households,  has  declined  sharply \nbecause they are unable to pay, so their children are less well prepared to perform in school. \nThe poor have greater difficulty getting textbooks and learning materials because of associated \ncharges.  Health  problems,  greater  opportunity  costs,  and  inadequate  clothing  for  bad  weather \nmean that regular school attendance among the poor has declined, more so in rural areas and \nin upper grades. A gender gap is emerging, particularly at upper and post-secondary levels, with \na consistent trend across all regions. These analyses will guide poverty indexing and targeting \nunder the ESRP. \n \n\n2. \n\nWomen \n\n71. \nPrior to independence, Tajikistan achieved high adult literacy (99% in 1990) and gender \nparity  in  educational  participation.  However,  in  recent  years,  girls\u2019  enrolment  and  attendance, \nparticularly at the upper secondary level, is lower than boys\u2019. The proportion of female teachers \nhas been rising steadily since 1991, and females comprised about 45.7% of the teaching force \nin primary and general secondary education in 2001 (against 37% in 1991). But the decline in \ngirls\u2019  enrollment  in  grades  10  and  11,  particularly  in  remote  locations,  may  limit  the  pool  of \nfemale  teachers.  Women  in  their  20s  are  slightly  less  educated  than  those  in  their  30s, \nindicating  that  greater  efforts  are  required  to  enroll  more  females,  particularly  at  the  upper-\nsecondary  level.  Women,  when  they  work,  are  concentrated  in  the  lowest-paid  sectors\u2014 \nagriculture, education, and health\u2014where wages are insufficient. \n \n72. \nThe proportion of girls enrolled in grades 10 and 11 in the five project districts is about \n36%, or less than the national average of 38%. The proportion of female teachers is about 35%, \nless  than  the  national  proportion  of  46%.  The  ESRP  will  make  targeted  efforts  to  ensure \nincreased enrollment of girls and a greater proportion of female teachers in project schools. \n \n\n3. \n\nEthnic Minorities \n\n73. \nThe constitution indicates that no person shall be discriminated against on the basis of \nethnic origin. The constitution also guarantees minorities equal access to education. According \nto some NGOs working in the pilot districts, ethnic minorities are well integrated and enjoy the \nsame  health  and  education  status,  except  for  the  elderly  Russian  population  that  receives \nsupport  from  NGOs.  The  ESRP  falls  under  category  \u201cC\u201d  in  terms  of  minority  groups.  More \ndetailed information on ethnic minorities is provided in Appendix 4. \n  \n\n                                                 \n7  World Bank. 2000. Republic of Tajikistan: Poverty Assessment.

Basic education is 9 years (grades 1\u20139), reduced from 11 years in 1996 \ndue  to  resource  constraints.  It  is  compulsory  and  free  as  per  the  constitution,  consisting  of  4 \nyears  (grades  1\u20134)  of  primary  and  5  years  (grades  5\u20139)  of  lower  secondary.  General  upper \nsecondary  comprises  grades  10  and  11.  Technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  is \navailable after grade 9 (3 or 4 years) or after grade 11 (2 years). Tertiary education is provided \nby public and private institutions with increasing cost recovery at both types of institutions.

Allocations  to  primary  and  general  secondary  education  have  risen  from \naround 44% of the education budget in 1992 to over 75% in 2003, indicating a rising priority on \nand  needs  of  primary  and  general  secondary  education.  Private  spending  on  education, \naccording  to  the  1999  Tajikistan  Living  Standard  Measurement  Survey,  is  almost  50%  of  total \nspending  on  education,  although  the  bulk  of  the  spending  is  at  the  tertiary  level.  Every \nhousehold with one or more members attending education institutions spends some money on \neducation. \n \n3. \nDeclining  resources  and  rising  poverty  have  had  significant  adverse  impact  on  the \neducation  system  since  1991.  Enrollment  levels  have  collapsed  in  preschool  education  from \n145,100 in 1991 to 57,800 in 2001 and in technical and vocational education and training from \n82,500  to  49,100  during  the  same  period.  This  is  largely  because  of  the  collapse  of  state \nenterprises  that  funded  these  institutions.  Gross  enrollment  has  fallen  in  basic  education \n(grades  1\u20139)  from  94.9%  in  1990  to  84.3%  in  1999.  The  fall  has  been  sharper  at  the  upper \nsecondary  level  from  40.5%  in  1990  to  17.2%  in  1999.    Gender  imbalance  is  emerging, \nparticularly at the upper secondary level, with girls\u2019 enrollment sharply declining from 49% of the \ntotal  enrollment  in  1991  to  38%  in  2001.  However,  official  statistics  indicate  that  literacy  is \nalmost universal. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nIn-service teacher training is insignificant, and more than 50% of the students graduating \n4. \nfrom pre-service teacher training do not enter the profession because of very low salaries and \npreference  for  other  professions.  Teacher  salaries  increased  in  2002,  but  many  teachers \nsupplement  their  salaries  by  teaching  more  than  one  shift.  Similarly,  many  experienced  and \nqualified  teachers  have  left  the  profession,  resulting  in  about  20%  of  the  teachers  with  no \ntraining  in  2000  compared  to  9%  in  1991,  and  62%  of  the  teachers  with  university  training  in \n2000 compared to 77% in 1991. \n \nInternal  and  external  efficiency  of  the  education  system  is  considered  low.  A  smaller \n5. \nproportion of students is completing the general secondary cycle. A pupil-teacher ratio of 15:1 \nand a teaching-to-non-teaching staff ratio of 1:1.5 are considered very low and indicate room for \nsignificant  improvement.  Lower  participation  of  females  (less  than  40%  of  total  enrollment) \nbeyond the basic level needs to be improved. Improvement in student assessment is critical to \nimprove efficiency of available resources. \n \n6. \nAttendance rates have particularly declined in primary and general secondary education \nto  around  80%,  but  more  sharply  in  upper  secondary  education,  with  adverse  implications  on \nquality.  Children\u2019s  attendance  has  declined  mainly  because  they  lack  textbooks  or  learning \nmaterials, have health problems (malnutrition, anemia), experience rising opportunity costs, and \nother  problems  associated  with  poverty.  More  than  40%  of  parents  have  expressed \ndissatisfaction over the status of education quality.1 The current generation in Tajikistan is at risk \nof receiving a poorer education than the previous one. \n \n7. \nIn  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  stipulations,  the  ADB-supported  education  sector \nreview proposes key reforms, including (i) constructing a national education system, (ii) moving \naway  from  the  command-and-control  mode  of  educational  delivery  that  characterized  the \nprevious  centralized  system,  (iii)  modernizing  system  governance  and  management,  and  (iv) \ndeveloping  a  curriculum  to  better  prepare  its  citizens  for  this  century.  A  key  challenge  is  that \nTajikistan can ill afford to run the system it inherited at independence. Despite funding agency \ndriven reform efforts over the last 5 years, Tajikistan still faces similar problems: infrastructural \nruin  and  neglect,  displaced  communities,  institutional  breakdown,  a  brain  drain  of  highly \nqualified  experts,  the  emergence  of  a  shadow  economy  that  rivals  the  \u201cofficial\u201d  economy,  and \nthe  deterioration  of  public  services.  More  recently,  external  funding  agencies  in  the  education \nsector have begun to improve coordination to support the Government. \n \n8. \nTajikistan  now  faces  a  formidable  task  of  reforming  its  education  system.  Problems \nadequately addressed in small-scale pilot projects are yet to be taken to scale, while the rest of \nthe system confronts major challenges. However, opportunities do exist. The Government has \npressed  forward  with  the  formal  adoption  of  a  poverty  reduction  strategy  that  recognizes  the \neducational development as central to relieving poverty. Tajikistan has publicly committed itself \nto education and educational spending as a percentage of GDP.  \n \n9. \nDonor coordination has begun to move forward with key funding agencies coordinating \nunder  the  auspices  of  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  beginning  to  work \nclosely with the Government by complementing each other, avoiding duplication, and stressing \nkey  reform  priorities.

It  is  encouraging  to  note  that  more  agencies \nsuch  as  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  are  now  supporting  education  with  more \nexternal resources. ADB will complement other funding agencies by supporting the Ministry of \nEducation with educational management information system, policy analysis, organizational and \nfinancial management, textbook development and distribution of two core subjects for grades 5\u2013\n11,  and  school  improvements  and  rehabilitation  in  five  pilot  districts.  World  Bank  will  support \ncurriculum  and  textbook  development,  teacher  training,  and  school  improvement  and  school \nrehabilitation  in  seven  pilot  districts;  USAID  in  teacher  training,  curriculum  development,  and \nschool rehabilitation; the World Food Programme in school feeding; GTZ in teacher training and \neducation  management \nin  policy  analysis  and  school \nimprovement;  the  Aga  Khan  Foundation  in  teacher  training  and  school  improvement;  and  the \nSoros Foundation in teacher training and textbook development.  \n \n10. \nThe Government\u2019s commitment to reform reflected in its National Concept on Education \n(2002) and poverty reduction strategy and program, the initial recognition by key stakeholders of \nsome  of  inherent  difficulties,  and  emerging  coordination  among  key  funding  agencies  provide \ngood  opportunities  to  address  some  of  the  key  challenges  that  Tajikistan  is  facing  in  the \neducation  sector.  A  reliable  information  system  to  enhance  policy  analysis,  to  prioritize  and \nenhance efficiency in the existing system, and to mobilize resources will help the Government \nwork  closely  with  key  stakeholders  to  develop  a  realistic  guiding  vision  that  is  well  informed, \nrational, and affordable.  \n \n\ninformation  system;

Tajik nationals increased from 56.2% \nof the population in 1970 to 62.3% in 1989. Tajikistan is also home to Uzbeks (23.5% in 1989), \nRussians  (7.6%),  Tatars  (1.5%),  Kyrgyz  (1.2%),  Ukrainians  (0.9%),  and  others.  Germans, \nKoreans,  and  representatives  of  more  than  140  other  nationalities  comprise  2.16%  of  the \npopulation. Ethnic groups are widely distributed throughout the country, although on a local level \nsome  clustering  tends  to  occur.  Higher  concentrations  of  Tajiks  may  be  found  in  central  and \neastern regions, or specific river valleys. Uzbek settlements are more common in southwestern \nor  western  villages  and  centers,  and  Russians  or  Russian-speaking  populations  live  in  larger \ntowns and in Dushanbe. \n \n2. \nOf the five pilot districts, Kulyab district is 20% Uzbek, while other districts have a 1\u20135% \nRussian  minority  (Table  4).  In  Roshkala,  Tajiks  comprise  more  than  99%  of  the  district \npopulation  (they  are  known  as  Shugni),  with  less  than  1%  of  the  population  being  Russian. \nShugni people speak Shugni and Tajik languages, and their children attend Tajik schools since \nShugni is not a written language and Tajik is the state language. The Russian minority is mostly \nold and poor, remaining in Tajikistan when most Russians left during the civil war. NGOs such \nas  the  International  Federation  of  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  give  them  food  and  social \nservices. There are also Kyrgyz and Tatar minorities who married with Tajiks and integrated well \ninto Tajik society. \n \n3. \nAccording  to  district  administrations,  the  Uzbek  minority  in  Kulyab  is  distributed  across \nthe  district,  with  education  attainment  and  access  to  health  services  on  a  par  with  the  Tajik \nmajority.  However,  no  specific  data  is  available  on  health  and  education  status  by  ethnic \nminority  group.  Uzbeks  understand  and  speak  Tajik.  Health  workers  and  teachers  represent \nboth Tajik and Uzbek ethnic groups. \n \n   \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4       29 \n\nTable A4.2: Summary Information on Ethnic Minorities \n\nMinority Groups \n\nNGO Working \nin Pilot \nDistricts \n\n \nRegions \n\nPilot Districts  \n \n \n \n \nRussian 4% \nAyni \nGornaya Matcha  Russian 2% \nRasht/Garm \n\nSughd \nSughd \nRRS \n \nGBAR \n \nKhatlon \nAga Khan = Aga Khan Foundation, GBAR = Gorno Badakshan Autonomous Region, IFRC = International Federation \nof  Red  Cross  and  Red  Crescent  Society,  MSF=  Medicins  Sans  Frontieres  (Doctors  without  Borders),  NGO  = \nnongovernment organization, RRS = Regions of Republican Subordination. \n \n\nUzbek 3% \nKyrgyz 0.05% \nKyrgyz 0.05%  Uzbek 0.05% \nKyrgyz 1.5%  Tatar 0.05% \n\nRussian 0.5% \nShugni more than 99%, \nRussian less than 1%  \n\n  \nRussian, Tatar, \nAcetian 1% \n\nIFRC \nIFRC \nMSF \nAga Khan \n\nUzbek 19.2% \n\nIFRC, Merlin \n\nRoshkala \n\nKulyab \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nLEGISLATION OPTIONS \n\nPedagogical Renewal \n\nFinancial Management \n\n \n1. \nBased  on  the  review  of  recent  government  documents\u2014including  the  Concept  on \nEducation1, a national policy document\u2014possible legislative changes that will be supported by \nthe  Project  are  listed  below.  These  legislative  changes  have  already  been  proposed  by  the \nGovernment; the ESRP will assist the Government in supporting the following changes in order \nto strengthen the policy framework:  \n \nA. \n \nThe national Education for All assessment2 anticipates a review of education legislation \n2. \nto provide a legal basis for education standards. Enabling legislation is needed that stipulates a \nprocess for promulgating educational standards, but does not incorporate actual statements of \nstandards. In this way, the process of standard setting will be flexible, and can be supported by \npiloting  standards  at  different  levels  and  in  different  sectors  of  the  education  and  training \nsystem. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  national  Education  for  All  assessment  and  the  education  component  of  the \nGovernment's  poverty  reduction  strategy3  propose  changes  in  policies  that  are  relevant  to \nfinancial management, another key aspect of the ESRP. Specifically, Education for All proposes \nto (i) create a new legislative basis for multisource financing, (ii) determine new funding norms, \nand  (iii)  ensure  the  transparent  use  by  schools  of  nonbudgetary  financial  resources,  such  as \nparental  payments.  The  ESRP  proposes  to  (i)  develop  a  multifaceted  approach  to  funding \neducation institutions, and (ii) review options such as tax breaks for investment in education for \nparent-teacher associations. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  Concept  on  Education  suggests  measures  relevant  to  the  management  and \ninstitutional  development  of  educational  institutions\u2014including  school  community  mobilization \nand  democratization  of  the  school  system\u2014specifically  through  preparing  decrees  for  the \ndevelopment of education institutions, including private ones. \n \n \n \n \n\nInstitutional Development \n\n                                                 \n1   Government  of  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  (2000).

Background and Rationale \n \n1. \nis important to address the following issues:  \n \n\nIn order to establish an effective educational management information system (EMIS), it \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nDetailed  information  on  education  institutions,  particularly  on  schools,  is \nconsolidated  at  the  district  level,  and  again  at  the  city/region  level  before  being \nsubmitted  to  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE).  This  means  that  the  MOE  has \naccess  only  to  broad  averages  and  totals  for  planning  purposes.  While  it  is \npossible to analyze the distribution of resources across districts, it is not easy to \nanalyze  this  distribution  below  the  district  level.  The  capacity  of  the  MOE  to \nmonitor equity in education, and to plan accordingly, is therefore weak. \n\nThere  is  an  almost  exclusive  emphasis  on  quantitative  information  such  as \nlearner  numbers  per  grade.  There  is  little  or  no  qualitative  information  on \nimportant factors such as quality of education management, quality of teaching, \nor learner performance.  \n\nEffective  use  of  data  for  planning  is  poor.  For  example,  information  on  the \ndisparities  in  expenditure  by  region  and  by  district  is  not  used  to  correct \ndisparities. Information gathered by inspectors and methodologists is not used to \ndesign  retraining  programs  for  teachers.  Information  on  the  quality  of  school \nmanagement  is  not  used  to  design  training  programs  for  school  principals  and \nparents\u2019 committees; indeed, few such programs exist. \n\nData exists in diverse locations within different levels of the system and the MOE. \nThis data is not integrated to generate coherent strategies and plans. \n\nB.    Objectives \n \n2. \nThe  purpose  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to  provide  impetus  in  building \nmanagement  information  systems  for  informed  policy  dialog  and  decision-making.  The \nobjectives of the TA are to (i) streamline EMIS at the MOE, region, and district levels, (ii) set up \nEMIS  frameworks  in  the  five  pilot  districts,  (iii)  support  a  national  school  census  of  all  primary \nand  general  secondary  schools,  (iv)  improve  decision-making  at  all  levels,  and  (v)  support \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  at  the  MOE.  The  TA  will  serve  as  a  central  policy  tool  to  improve \nMOE\u2019s annual planning, budgeting, and system monitoring. Baseline data will help plan project \nactivities, monitor performance, and measure impacts.  \n   \nC. \n \n3. \nThe  project  design  contains  a  central  emphasis  on  systemic  reform.  The  Project \nprovides  for  the  development  of  a  National  Education  Development  Framework  (NEDF).  The \nNEDF  will  ultimately  set  standards  and  specify  outcomes  for  system  and  management \nefficiency, for access and equity, and for pedagogical renewal. The framework will also specify \nthe types of system change that are required; for example, changes in systems like budgeting \nand structures (reorganization of system management).  \n \n\nScope and Methodology \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n49 \n\nThe  Project  was  essentially  intended  to  improve  policy  and  planning  capacity  in  areas \n4. \nsuch  as  financial  management,  management  reorganization,  and  pedagogical  renewal. \nHowever,  data  is  unreliable  and  analysis  is  weak,  making  it  difficult  to  support  policy  and \nplanning.  A  \u201ckick-start\u201d  is  therefore  needed  as  soon  as  possible  in  the  form  of  EMIS \ndevelopment. A rapid national survey of schools is required to eliminate fundamental problems \nsuch  as  poor  data  on  teachers,  learners,  and  the  location,  size,  and  condition  of  schools.  A \ndatabase on school conditions will greatly facilitate the initial phase of assistance in policy and \nplanning, and will also provide initial impetus for enhancing equity and access. \n \nD. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n5. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $355,000,  of  which  $236,000  is  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $119,000  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance $300,000, covering the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $64,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. ADB will finance the TA on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill finance the balance of the local currency cost, $55,000 equivalent, by providing counterpart \nstaff, office space with utilities for TA administration, and workshop facilities.

The president\u2019s office will be \nthe  executing  agency  and  MOE  the  implementing  agency.  The  project steering  committee  will \nalso guide the TA. The steering committee will oversee government coordination, provide timely \nguidance  and  management  support  to  the  TA,  ensure  close  links  with  the  project,  and  meet \nevery quarter. \n \nA team of international and local consultants will implement the TA. The TA will provide \n7. \n9  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  70  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants  with  expertise  in  EMIS,  surveys,  and  database  management.  The  consultants  will \nbe recruited as individuals according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Procurement  of  office  equipment,  computers,  and  printers \nwill follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.   \n \nF. \n \n8. \nThe  TA  will  produce  the  following  outputs:  (i)  an  EMIS  framework;  (ii)  key  EMIS \nindicators;  (iii)  a  data  collection  and  analysis  manual;  (iv)  an  initial  data  analysis  report;  (v) \nbaseline  data  for  monitoring  and  impact  analysis  in  pilot  districts;  and  (vi)  an  initial  monitoring \nand evaluation report. \n \nG. \n \nAn  international  education  management  specialist/team  leader  (2  person-months)  and \n9. \ntwo  domestic  education  management  specialists,  including  a  co-team  leader  (20  person-\nmonths), will \n \n\nTerms of References of international consultants  \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nAssist the MOE project implementation unit (PIU) in anchoring development of a \nclear understanding of the project design and in designing initial action plans. \nAssist the MOE, the Ministry of Finance, and pilot region and district departments \nof education in developing a clear understanding of the project design and of the \nimplications of their effective participation. \nIdentify, in consultation with the MOE and the PIU, the potential members of all \nproject task teams and brief them regarding the purpose and modus operandi of \nthe task teams. \nIdentify,  in  consultation  with  the  MOE  and  the  PIU,  local  nongovernment \norganizations and public training institutions as candidates to design and deliver \nthe management development programs. \nVisit  pilot  districts  to  (i)  conduct  situational  analyses  of  education  management, \n(ii)  gather  all  available  school-related  data,  (iii)  hold  meetings  of  district-based \neducation  managers  and  school-based  managers  on  project  design,  and  (iv) \nascertain how the climate is likely to affect logistics in each district. \nDevelop a comprehensive briefing pack for the PIU on all of the above. \nThe  domestic  co-team  leader  will  share  responsibility  for  team  leadership  and \ncoordinate the work in the absence of the international team leader. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n51 \n\nThree education planners (5 person-months of international consulting services and 40 \n10. \nperson-months of domestic) will design and implement a national survey of schools and oversee \nthe development of a national database on school conditions. They will  \n \n\nAssist the MOE in designing an EMIS that will incorporate basic data on schools \nas an initial basis for improved education planning systems.  \nIn  particular,  the  EMIS  will  help  (i)  quantify  systemic  inequities  such  as  access, \nretention,  and  physical  condition  of  schools,  (ii)  ascertain  numbers  and \ndistribution  of  teachers,  (iii)  ascertain  numbers  and  distribution  of  learners,  (iv) \nascertain  quantity  and  distribution  of  schools,  school  conditions,  and  school \nresources. \nEnsure  that  capacity  is  developed  in  the  MOE,  pilot  regions,  and  districts  to \nmaintain the database and begin using it for planning purposes. \n\n(iv)  Monitor the use and maintenance of the EMIS and provide necessary advice. \n\n \n11. \nTwo school census specialists (2 person-months of international consulting services and \n10 person-months of domestic) will design a school survey and develop a national database on \nschool conditions. They will \n \n\nAssist the education planner in designing a national school survey questionnaire, \nschedule,  and  manual  that  will  help  (i)  quantify  systemic  inequities,  mainly \nassociated  with  gender  and  poverty,  such  as  access,  retention,  and  physical \ncondition  of  schools,  (ii)  ascertain  numbers  and  distribution  of  teachers,  (iii) \nascertain  numbers  and  distribution  of  learners,  (iv)  ascertain  numbers  and \ndistribution of schools, school conditions, and school resources. \n\nDesign a national database of school conditions that will incorporate information \ngathered  during  the  school  survey,  ensuring  that  MOE  and  region/district \neducation managers can easily access the database for planning purposes. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nProvide  workplace-based  training  to  the  MOE  and  region/district  education \nmanagers on the maintenance and use of the database. \n\n(iv)  Monitor the use and maintenance of the database and provide necessary advice. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT \n\nThe ESRP falls under environmental category \"C\". Screening during project preparation \n\n \n1. \nfound no adverse environmental impacts. \n \n2. \nPoor  sanitary  installations  and  wastewater  treatment  are  concerns  to  be  addressed \nunder  the  ESRP.  In  most  cases,  schools  have  unprotected  pit  latrines  without  provisions  for \nmaintenance or basic hygiene. Drinking water sources may be polluted.  \n \n3. \nThe participatory civil works survey (school mapping) during project implementation will \nassess needs and set criteria for subprojects, civil works, and environmental improvements. If a \nsubproject  includes  installing  toilets  and  septic  tanks,  it  will  provide  running  nonpotable  water \nand ensure that it is not used for drinking. Support for physical rehabilitation\u2014including sanitary \nfacilities  and  adequate  wastewater  treatment,  where  feasible\u2014will  significantly  improve  public \nhealth and raise school attendance. \n \nDesigns for rehabilitated schools will explore affordable, safe heating solutions, including \n4. \nindoor air-quality considerations. The design of civil works will ensure that new and rehabilitated \ninfrastructure meets earthquake and fire safety standards.  \n \nThe  ESRP  will  not  cause  any  other  adverse  social  impact.  The  ESRP  will  promote \n5. \nincreased  quality  of  life  in  rural  communities  through  improved  education  and  environmental \nmanagement of schools, and therefore will have positive environmental impacts. \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 17 \n\n53 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY FORM \n\nPoverty \n\n \nYes \n\n \nYes \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nProposed Classification \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nPartnership \nCountry \nAgreement?   \n\n \nA. \n \nSector  identified  as  a  National  Priority  in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   \nSocial Sector \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Tajikistan: \n \nNet  enrollment  and  school  attendance  rates,  particularly  at  the  upper  secondary  level  (grades  10-11), \nare higher for children coming from higher-income quintiles. Strategic and targeted investment in primary \nand  general  secondary  education  is  critical  to  sustaining  high  levels  of  educational  attainment  in \nTajikistan. The ESRP will target investments to improve efficiency and quality of education, and help to \nreduce  large  discrepancies  in  access  to  quality  education  services,  particularly  in  pilot  districts. \nIncreased participation by the poorer population in better quality education is expected to provide more \nneeded  skills  to  face  emerging  labor  market  needs,  provide  better  earning  potential,  improve  health \npractices, and contribute to enhancing social cohesion. \n \nB. \n \nAbout  83%  of  the  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line.  About  341,800  people,  or  5%  of  the  total \npopulation,  live  in  the  five  pilot  districts  of  whom  over  83%  (more  than  284,000)  live  below  the  poverty \nline. About 90,000 students are enrolled in 298 schools and about 20,000 school-age children are either \nout of school or do not attend school regularly. The five pilot districts are considered poorer than average \nbased on the level and severity of poverty (poverty rating developed by World Bank for all districts), the \nlevel  of  infant  and  maternal  mortality,  the  proportion  of  girls\u2019  enrollment,  and  the  proportion  of  female \nteachers in schools. \n \nThrough  school  mapping,  the  ESRP  will  identify  factors  inhibiting  access  to  and  regular  attendance  at \nschools to identify and target support to out-of-school children and those not attending schools regularly. \nRegular  school  attendance  has  declined,  particularly  among  the  poor  and  more  so  in  rural  areas  and \nupper grades. These factors may include gender barriers, health problems, greater opportunity costs, and \nother  problems  associated  with  poverty.  A  poverty  index  and  a  school  rehabilitation  index  will  be \ndeveloped to rank all schools into four quartiles.  \n \nThe ranking of schools based on poverty and school conditions is designed to target the lower half of the \npoorest population. About 45,000 students studying in about 150 schools falling in the lower half of the \npoverty index will benefit more from the ESRP. Similarly, about 20,000 school-age children who are out of \nschool  or  not  attending  schools  regularly  will  benefit  from  improved  access  to  schooling.  This  will  help \nlocal  governments  responsible  for  primary  and  general  secondary  education  to  plan  better  and  target \nresources. This will also help to target the poor who can ill afford textbooks and learning materials. \n \n            The ESRP is classified as Core Poverty Intervention.      \n \nC. \nFor the first time in many years, women in the  20-30 age group are less educated than those in 30-40 \nage  group,  indicating  that  girls  in  recent  years  have  received  less  education.  Although  Tajikistan  had \nachieved  gender  parity  in  education,  this  is  now  threatened.  While  girls\u2019  enrollment  up  to  grade  9  is \nslightly less than that of boys, it drops significantly to 38% in grades 10 and 11 nationally, and to 36% in \npilot districts. While national attendance is around 80% in basic education, girls\u2019 attendance is estimated \nto be less. Unless this trend is rectified soon, the situation may deteriorate further. The ESRP will directly \nor indirectly benefit more than 37,000 girls enrolled in grades 1-11 in project schools. Over 14,000 girls \nestimated to be out of school in project districts are expected to benefit from improved access to schools. \nThe  ESRP  will  target  girls  to  ensure  that  their  enrollment  and  attendance  in  primary  and  general \nsecondary schools increases by 10-20% in pilot districts, with particular emphasis in grades 10 and 11.  \n\nGender and Development \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n \n\nAppendix   17 \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \nAt  the  national  level,  the  educational  management  information  system  will  assist  the  Ministry  of \nEducation\u2019s annual planning and budgeting to target girls\u2019 participation. At the district level, a combination \nof school mapping and school improvement funds will allow district education departments and schools to \ntarget funds to support improved participation of girls. School mapping will also identify the number of out-\nof-school  girls  and  factors  inhibiting  girls\u2019  participation.  Social  analysis  under  school  mapping  will  also \nanalyze government policies and strategies on increasing girls\u2019 enrollment and increasing the proportion \nof  female  teachers  and  female  employees  in  the  education  system.  School  improvement  proposals  will \nsupport locally appropriate strategies to improve girls\u2019 enrollment and completion by targeting girls. \n \nGender plan prepared? None required. The above strategies are well reflected in the ESRP.  \n \nD. \nStakeholder analysis prepared                                                                                          Yes \nA  multilevel  consultation  process  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  was  carried  out  during  project \npreparation.  Primary  stakeholders  include  service  users  and  providers  at  the  region  (oblast),  district \n(raion),  and  village  (jamoat)  levels.  Secondary  stakeholders  comprised  national  and  local  policy  and \ndecision makers.  \n \nParticipatory strategy: \nComprehensive  school  mapping  will  identify  quantitative  and  qualitative  factors  associated  with  school \nimprovement  in  all  primary  and  general  secondary  schools  in  all  pilot  districts.  The  provision  of  school \nimprovement funds requires extensive consultations by parent-teacher associations in each participating \nschool. Community mobilization supports a full-time district level community change agent to work closely \nwith village organizations and parent-teacher associations to facilitate school improvement through wider \nparticipation and greater synergy with other relevant activities and agencies at the district level.   \n\n \nE. \n\nSocial Issues \n\n Subject \n\nResettlement  \n \n  \n\nAffordability  \n \n \n\n Significant, \nNot Significant, \n\nUncertain, None  \n\nNone \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n \nNo new schools will be constructed. \n\nNot significant \n\nThe ESRP will not initiate user fees or cofinancing that \nrisk  harming  affordability \nthe  poor.

Tajikistan  is  one  of  the \npoorest  countries  in  the  world,  with  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  of  US$162  in \n2001. Although about 83% of the population remains below the poverty line and unemployment \nis  estimated  as  high  as  30%,1  Tajikistan's  human  development  index  ranking  (112  in  2002) \nremains  high  compared  to  other  developing  countries  because  of  its  historical  achievement  in \nsocial development. \n \nLow  levels  of  public  expenditure  on  education  are  partially  explained  by  poor \n2. \ngovernment capacity to raise tax revenue. Total revenue from tax is around 14% of GDP, which \nis low for a developing country. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThere  is  a  firm  economic  rationale  to  justify  public  investment  in  human  capital  to \nenhance the earning potential and social benefits. Global studies indicate high rates of return on \ninvestment in education; the highest returns are in primary education, with rates of return ROR \nabove 20%. Secondary education sees ROR above 15% in low income countries.2 \n \n4. \nThree  scenarios  were  considered  to  analyze  the  cost-effectiveness  of  the  ESRP:  (i) \nkeeping  the  status  quo,  (ii)  increasing  the  education  budget  without  significant  systemic \ninvestment  or  change,  and  (iii)  making  the  investments  as  planned  in  this  proposal.  The  first \nalternative  was  rejected  because  all  available  analyses  indicate  that  the  current  situation  is \ndeteriorating  to  the  detriment  of  many  school  age  children.  The  second  alternative  was  also \nrejected because the system requires major reforms to  make it sustainable; for example, if all \nthe currently prescribed textbooks were distributed to all school children, this item alone would \nconsume all the education resources. The third alternative is therefore being pursued. \n \nThe third alternative was further analyzed under three alternatives. First, an investment \n5. \nloan  modality  was  proposed  since  the  country  has  begun  to  stabilize  following  the  protracted \ncivil war, there is a need to move away from emergency-type operations, and there is a need to \nbuild  on  different  initiatives  from  different  agencies,  including  coordination  mechanisms.  The \nenvironment is not yet appropriate for program- or sector development program-type operations \nsince  it  is  first  critical  to  establish  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  sector,  develop  initial \ninformation base, and build institutional capacity, and establish good donor coordination before \nembarking  on  more  comprehensive  policy  reforms.  The  investment  modality  proposes  to \nsupport  some  of  key  elements  (national  education  development  framework  [NEDF],  donor \ncoordination,  piloting  of  school  reforms,  information  base),  which  would  facilitate  other \nmodalities in the future. Initial donor coordination is already emerging. \n \nSecond, project components are packaged by national and district levels to ensure cost-\n6. \neffective  use  of  resources.  Systemic  reforms  are  necessary  at  the  national  level,  whereas \ndistrict-level investments involve direct interventions at the district, school, and community levels \n\n                                                 \n1   World Bank. 2000.

Washington, D.C. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n57 \n\nFiscal Impact \n\nin  line  with  the  NEDF.  The  first  component  to  support  the  development  of  the  NEDF  sets  the \nstage for the Ministry of Education to develop medium-term education plans underpinned by the \npoverty reduction strategy paper, a public expenditure review, and a medium-term expenditure \nframework. While the national capacity is enhanced, the focus on school improvement based on \nobjective criteria (baseline information from school mapping) and community mobilization at the \ndistrict level will further strengthen the linkage between national policies and implementation at \nthe school level. Finally, the focus on quality improvement through teacher training, curriculum \ndevelopment,  and  instructional  materials  in  line  with  the  national  framework,  followed  by \nprovision of training and instructional materials at the school level, will make investments more \ncost-effective, coherent, and sustainable, all critical elements for Tajikistan.  \n \n7. \n  Third, school improvements are cost-effective since school selection will be based on \nobjective  criteria  such  as  poverty  level,  school  conditions,  resource  mobilization,  community \nsupport,  and  financial  sustainability.  The  review  of  this  approach  is  based  on  eligibility  of \nschools, as well as quality and other output-based performance indicators. Since not all schools \nwill receive school improvement funds, the process will generate competition leading to a more \nefficient,  equitable,  and  better-quality  primary  and  general  secondary  school  system.  This \napproach also complements the efforts of other development partners who share the need for \nreform at the level of service delivery.  \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe  Government  will  finance  about  20%  of  the  ESRP  cost.  The  total  ESRP  cost, \ninclusive  of  taxes,  duties,  contingencies,  and  interest  charges,  is  $9.38  million  over \napproximately 5 years. A financial sustainability analysis was done to evaluate the impact of the \nESRP  on  the  government  budget  (Table  A18).  Based  on  economic  development  and \nexpenditure  trends,  projections  were  made  to  assess  the  annual  recurrent  expenditure  as  a \nresult  of  the  project  investment  so  that  the  Government  is  presented  with  a  clear  funding \ncommitment.  Although  education  expenditures  increased  substantially  during  the  last  3  years, \nprojections  were  conservatively  made  under  the  following  assumptions:  (i)  maintenance  of \neducation expenditure at over 3% of GDP and 17% of state expenditure throughout the project \nperiod; and (ii) incremental recurrent costs after the ESRP will be maintained at about 20% of \nproject costs (to decrease gradually). \n \n9. \nOf the total ESRP cost of $9.38 million, the Government will finance about $1.88 million.  \nThe Government\u2019s annual share in ESRP costs will average around $310,000 equivalent, which \nis  about  0.91%  of  the  average  annual  projected  education  budget  of  about  $34.4  million.  The \nrecurrent  costs  to  be  borne  by  the  Government  during  the  project  period  are  estimated  at \n$200,000  per  year  and  include  (i)  operating  expenses  of  project  implementation,  and  (ii) \noperating and maintaining renovated school facilities and equipment.  Based on projections, the \nresulting impact of the project on total education expenditure is only 0.1%; and about 1.1% and \n1.4% respectively on general education budget expenditures and local expenditures. Assuming \nthe education spending is maintained, the budgetary impact of the estimated annual recurrent \ncosts during and after project implementation is minimal. In parallel, the World Bank will provide \na $20 million loan (of which $7 million is grant) to implement reforms in seven pilot districts.  The \nUnited States Agency for International Development  and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische \nZusammenarbeit  (German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation,  GTZ)  will  extend  $5  million  and \n$2  million  respectively  during  the  next  2\u20133  years.  These  external  fund  sources  average  over \n12% of education budget expenditures during the project period. Recurrent costs of externally \nfunded  projects,  on  the  other  hand,  average  about  2.1%  and  1.2%,  respectively,  of  the \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nEducation Sector \n\neducation  budget  expenditures  during  and  after  the  project  period,  and  appear  manageable \nover the medium term. \n \n10. \nThe  ESRP  is  designed  to  minimize  recurrent  costs  for  the  Government  and  the \ncommunity. The improvement of the quality and management support systems under the ESRP \nis intended to improve efficiency of the education system. The development of appropriate and \nimproved system will result in an efficient use of resources and an effective delivery of services. \nThe  costs  associated  with  system  development  are  one-time  costs  to  support  reforms,  and \ntherefore the incremental costs from the ESRP are negligible and sustainable. Although school \nrehabilitation  and  school  funds  are  being  financed,  sustainability  is  being  ensured  through \ncommitments  from  the  local  community  (particularly  parent-teacher  associations)  and  local \ngovernment, with support from stronger district departments. \n \nD. \n \n11. \nA sharp decline in the economy following Tajikistan\u2019s independence in 1991 has had a \nserious impact on social-sector financing. The sharp decline in financing to education from over \n11% of GDP in 1991 to around 2.4% in 2001 and the severe damage inflicted to the education \ninfrastructure during the protracted civil strife have eroded past achievements. Tajikistan cannot \nafford  the  education  system  of  its  past.  Since  the  system  is  making  efforts  to  align  with \ndemocracy  and  an  emerging  market  economy,  serious  care  is  needed  to  adopt  an  efficient, \nsustainable approach to financing. While there is a need to increase resources for education, it \nis  equally  important  to  streamline  structural  problems.  A  major  project  objective  is  to  help  the \nGovernment  to  move  in  this  direction  by  laying  the  foundation  for  a  longer-term  financing \nframework.  The  design  comprises  components  that  support  management  and  technical \nefficiency to make investment more affordable and sustainable. \n \n12. \nFrom  2000  to  2002,  the  social  sector  absorbed  over  a  third  of  the  total  government \nexpenditure.  The  share  of  social spending  in  total  state  expenditures grew  from  about  34%  in \n2000  (4.7%  of  GDP)  to  42%  (5.9%  of  GDP)  in  2002,  indicating  the  Government\u2019s  rising \ncommitment to improving social services. After significant declines in the mid-1990s, education \nspending  as  a  share  of  total  state  expenditures  has  increased  steadily  from  15.3%  in  2000  to \n17.6%  in  2002.  Per  capita  spending  grew  from  $2.86  to  $4.34  during  the  same  period.  It  is \nprojected that government and per capita spending will reach 18.9% and $4.95 respectively in \n2003.  By international comparison, however, Tajikistan\u2019s annual education spending as a share \nof GDP has been the lowest in Central Asia at around 2.5% in 2001. \n \n13. \nPrivate  expenditure  in  education  is  about  50%  of  the  total  expenditure,  with  almost  all \nfamilies  spending  some  money  on  education,  the  bulk  of  it  at  the  tertiary  level.3  Following  the \nLaw  on  Education  (1994),  several  private  schools  and  universities  have  been  established  but \nprivate  enrolment  is  only  about  1%.  Given  the  tight  fiscal  scenario  and  inability  of  the \nGovernment  to  increase  allocations  significantly,  private  funding  is  needed.  Efforts  are \nnecessary  to  target  public  resources  to  children  from  poor  families  at  all  levels  and  to  make \nfinancing more transparent to improve quality and equity in education. \n\n                                                 \n3   World Bank. 2000.
