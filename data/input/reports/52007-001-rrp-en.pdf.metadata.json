It supports a switch \nto cleaner fuel, that is from coal to gas (natural gas and biogas) for residential, commercial, and \nindustrial use to improve air quality in Henan Province.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe greater BTH region is a major industrial and commercial zone, and generates about \none-third of the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product. The region\u2019s gross domestic product has grown \nby  about  8%  annually  between  2009  and  2018, but the  heavy  reliance  on  coal  as  the  primary \nenergy  source  for residential,  commercial,  and industrial purposes  has resulted  in serious  and \nextensive air pollution. To address this, the PRC launched the first Comprehensive Action Plan \nfor Air Pollution Prevention and Control 2013\u20132017, which aimed to improve air quality. The plan\u2019s \nsuccessful  implementation  has  reduced  concentrations  of  particulate  matter  less  than  2.5 \nmicrometer in diameter (PM2.5) by 39.6%, from 105 micrograms per cubic meter (\u03bcg/m3) in 2013 \nto 64 \u03bcg/m3 in 2017.4 To further improve air quality, in June 2018 the central government issued \nthe Three-Year Action Plan to Win Blue Sky War (2018\u20132020) to reduce emissions of nitrogen \noxide (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) by over 15%, and emissions of PM2.5 by over 18%, by 2020 \n(from 2015 levels). 5 \n \n4. \nHenan Province is located within the greater BTH region, and is the PRC\u2019s second-most \npopulous and most coal-dependent province. It has good access to the major national natural gas \ntransmission pipelines, but this has not been fully taken advantage of to reduce air pollution.6 In \n2018,  coal  provided  about  72.0%  of  primary  energy,  compared  with  the  national  average  of \n                                                \n1  The greater BTH region includes Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Shandong, and Shanxi \n\nprovinces; and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n\n2  ADB.  2015.

Beijing.  \n6  Two  transnational  natural  gas  pipelines  (West\u2013East  Gas  Pipeline  I  and  II)  pass  through  10  provinces,  including \n\nHenan, and have transported natural gas from Central Asia to the east coast of the PRC since 2015.  \n\n\f2 \n\n59.0%.  Henan  Province remains  a major  contributor to  air  pollution  in  the greater  BTH region. \nCoal burning is the major source of air pollution in the province, and the provincial government\u2019s \nmedium-term  and  long-term  energy  development  plan  (2012\u20132030)  has  a  strategic  target  of \nincreasing the natural gas supply, with dependence on coal as a primary energy source targeted \nto decline to 65% by 2023 and 58% by 2030. In 2014, it issued the Henan Blue Sky Action Plan \n(2014\u20132017)  to  reduce,  by  2017,  emissions  of  particulate  matter  less  than  10  micrometer  in \ndiameter (PM10) by 15% and PM2.5 by 10% (from levels in 2012).7 These targets were achieved, \nbut Henan Province nevertheless recorded air pollutant concentrations in 2018 for PM2.5 of 63 \n\u03bcg/m3; PM10 of 114 \u03bcg/m3: SO2 of 15 \u03bcg/m3; and NOx of 39 \u03bcg/m3; these all far exceed the national \ncategory  I  air  quality  standard,  and  the  World  Health  Organization  standard. 8  In  2018,  the \nprovincial government further launched its Three-Year Action Plan for Henan Province to Combat \nBlue  Sky  War  (2018\u20132020). 9  It  includes  comprehensive  policy  actions  to  (i)  reduce  coal \nconsumption, promote energy efficiency, deploy renewable energy, and reduce emissions from \ntransport; (ii) reduce PM2.5 to 58 \u03bcg/m3 by 2020; and (iii) achieve the national air quality category \nII standard (35 \u03bcg/m3) by 2023. \n \nHenan Province\u2019s policy framework (para. 4) seeks to reduce both high coal dependency \n5. \nand  air  pollution.  The  provincial  government\u2019s  actions  focus  primarily  on  reducing  coal \nconsumption  through  an  annual  limit,  demolition  of  energy-inefficient  coal-fired  boilers,  and \npromotion  of  natural  gas  and  other  cleaner  fuels.  As  a  result,  the  province\u2019s  natural  gas \nconsumption increased by 60.2% during 2014\u20132018. The primary driver was the increased supply \nof gas  in  urban  areas, which  accounted for  67.1%  of total  natural gas consumption  in  2018.10 \nDespite  the  rapid  expansion  in  natural  gas  consumption  in  major  urban  centers,  most  of  the \npopulation  in  semi-urban  and rural  areas  in the  province  remains  unserved,  because  of (i) the \nlimited ability to pay for gas, and preference for traditional fuels among rural households; and (ii) \nthe limited private and public investment appetite due to high costs of reaching geographically \nscattered populations in townships and villages.11 Another challenge is ensuring energy security, \nwhich requires decreased dependence on gas imports while sustaining a clean, long-term fuel \nsupply. Biogas as an alternative domestic energy source has a large potential, because Henan \nProvince is the largest producer of grain in the country. Production of biogas using crop waste is \nlargely untapped, with biogas production below 1% of the province\u2019s resource potential. \n \nB. \n \n6. \nCleaner  fuel  switch  investment  program.  Based  on  the  provincial  government\u2019s \nmedium- and long-term energy development plan,12 the Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program \n(2019\u20132030) was formulated to provide a clear expenditure and financing framework for access \nto gas in semi-urban and rural areas. This aims to establish a distributed gas supply network with \n\nProgram Rationale \n\n                                                \n7   Government of Henan Province. 2014.

Natural \n\ngas consumption in the cities has increased by 119% between 2014 and 2018. \n\n11 A project completion report for Air Quality Improvement Project in Henan Province  found that outcomes fell short of \ntargets with respect to physical connections (52%) and natural gas utilization (36%) because of a low investment \nappetite among gas suppliers caused by the high initial cost of extending the distribution network in the targeted \ncounties, resistance among the rural population to switching from traditional fuels (coal and firewood), and a lack of \ninterest  among  end-users  because  of  high  connection  fees  (Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency.  2013.  The \nProject Completion Report for Air Quality Improvement Project in Henan Province. Tokyo.). \n\n12  Government  of  Henan  Province.  2012.  Medium-  and  Long-Term  Energy  Development  Plan  (2012\u20132030). \n\nZhengzhou. \n\n \n\n\fa target of reaching 4.5 million customers in 80 counties in the province by 2030. These areas are \nless developed and geographically scattered, and the population is still largely dependent on coal \nfor primary energy use. The fuel switch from coal to gas for residential, commercial, and industrial \ncustomers  in  semi-urban  and  rural  areas  was  initiated  in  2018  on  pilot  basis,  and  307,078 \ncustomers in 10 counties were connected to cleaner fuel. The program will expand the gas supply \nnetwork  and  biogas  production  in  a  phased  manner  until  2030;  it  will  require  an  investment  of \n\u20ac1,988.9  million,  including  \u20ac1,383.7  in  debt  financing  and  \u20ac605.2  million  in  equity  contribution \nfrom the program\u2019s implementing agencies. \n \n7. \nProposed results-based lending program. To ensure the long-term investment needed \nto support the switch from coal to gas is sustainably funded, the program will adopt ADB\u2019s results-\nbased lending (RBL) modality during its initial stage. ADB\u2019s RBL program will support program \nfinancing  during  2019\u20132023  (the  overall  investment  program  is  for  2019\u20132030).  To  address \nidentified  development  challenges,  the  RBL  program  design  incorporates  lessons  from  past \ninvestments in natural gas supply networks in the province, including (i) reducing entry barriers \nfor  targeted  customers  by  providing free  connections; (ii)  employing  awareness  campaigns for \nnew  customers  to  develop  an  awareness  of  safety  issues  and  induce  a  switch  away  from \ntraditional  fuels;  (iii)  including  biogas  as  a  cleaner  fuel  source;  and  (iv)  building  institutional \ncapacity to ensure sustainable investment and efficient operation, with private sector involvement \nto improve gas supply and customer service quality. The RBL modality is considered appropriate \nbecause  it  will  (i)  provide  incentives  to  deliver  on  core  results;  (ii)  enhance  institutional  and \norganizational capacity to leverage sustainable funding for subsequent long-term investment in \nthe  overall  program;  and  (iii)  lower  the  transaction  costs  of  managing  numerous  small-scale \nactivities and expenditures across the province using existing fiduciary and safeguard systems, \nwhich will be further reinforced with an agreed program action plan (PAP).13 \n \n8. \nSector  deregulation  and  private  sector  involvement.  The  private  sector  has  been \nactive in supplying gas in urban areas, but the natural gas industry in the PRC has been largely \ndominated by state-owned enterprises which own most of the pipeline networks, storage facilities, \nand liquefied natural gas terminals; the existing industrial structure is hindering the response to \nthe  immediate  need  to  reduce  coal  consumption  to  improve  air  quality.  The  government  has \ninitiated several reforms since 2018 that deregulate the natural gas sector in order to encourage \nprivate sector participation in upstream and downstream natural gas supply.14 The RBL program \nis aligned with ongoing sector deregulation in natural gas supply; private sector involvement will \npromote efficient gas delivery operations and services in semi-urban and rural areas, which is a \ndifficult  market  segment  for  the  private  sector  to  tackle  alone.  A  partnership  with  a  private \ncompany  was  arranged  to  undertake  the  Cleaner  Fuel  Switch  Investment  Program.  A  special \npurpose vehicle\u2014the Henan Yu-Tian New Energy Co. Ltd. (YTNE)15\u2014was established as a joint \nventure  project  company  between  the  Zhongyuan  Yuzi  Investment  Holding  Group  (ZYIG),  a \n\n                                                \n13 RBL is considered a suitable loan modality for programmatic activities across extensive areas and activities. Unlike \nthe  sector  loan  modality,  the  RBL  requirements  are  applied  to  the  entire  program  (beyond  the  ADB-financed \ncomponents),  and  to  counterpart  and  cofinancing  components.  RBLs  can  also  be  linked  directly  to  capacity \ndevelopment. While program implementation ability was demonstrated through the initial connection of more than \n300,000 customers in 2018, there is room to improve the overall capacity of the program implementing agencies and \nstaff with clear milestones; hence, RBL frameworks with disbursement-linked mechanisms will provide incentives to \nimprove capacity to sustain operations and leverage financing to achieve the long-term program goals. The PAP is \naccessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n\n14 The deregulation policy includes (i) open access to natural gas infrastructure for the third party, (ii) linking domestic \nnatural  gas  gate  price  with  international  market  price,  and  (iii)  introducing  the  return  on  asset  benchmark  for \ntransmission (8%) and distribution (7%). \n\n15 YTNE was established in June 2018 to implement the Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program. \n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\nprovincial  government-owned  enterprise, 16  and  the  China  Tian  Lun  Gas  Holding  Limited \n(CTLG),17 a private gas supplier. \n  \n9. \nADB\u2019s value addition. ADB financing using the RBL program modality will add substantial \nvalue by setting up a framework for sustainable implementation of the overall investment program \nand  (i)  providing  (a)  comprehensive  support  for  behavioral  changes  in  energy  use  through \nawareness  campaigns  to  use  gas,  with  particular  attention  on  gender;  and  (b)  cost  reductions \nthrough  no-cost  gas  connections  for  rural  customers  to  lower  social  disparities  in  gas  use;  (ii) \nfacilitating technology adoption for biogas production using the dry fermentation process, which \nis  the  first  application  in  piped  biogas  supply in the PRC;  and  (iii)  demonstrating  a  sustainable \nbusiness  model  with  private  sector  involvement  in  gas  supply  in  semi-urban  and  rural  areas, \nthrough capacity enhancement of the program implementing agencies with respect to corporate \ngovernance,  financial  management,  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  procurement  and \nanticorruption, and gender development. The RBL program provides a holistic solution to reducing \ndevelopment barriers to gas access in semi-urban and rural areas of the province. The lessons \nand experience from the RBL program are expected to be disseminated to other provinces in the \ngreater BTH region that face similar challenges.18 The business model can also be replicated in \nother countries for a sustainable cleaner fuel switch to improve air quality. \n \n10. \nThe RBL program is fully aligned with the priorities of broadening the response to climate \nchange and strengthening environmental sustainability in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nthe  PRC,  2016\u20132020.19 It  will  support  key  strategic  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030:  (i)  tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability  by  accelerating  low  greenhouse  gas  emissions  development  and  ensuring \nenvironmental sustainability through actions for expansion of natural gas use and development \nof  bioenergy  to  build  low  carbon energy  system  in  the  PRC  and  thereby support  its  Nationally \nDetermined Contributions;20 (ii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity by providing \ninclusive gas service with greater engagement of the private sector; and (iii) accelerating progress \nin  achieving  gender  equality  through  gender  mainstreaming  activities.21 The  RBL  program  will \nalso  contribute  to  Sustainable  Development  Goal  7  (Ensure  access  to  affordable,  reliable, \nsustainable, and modern energy for all) by providing affordable access to cleaner fuels in rural \nareas. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nBased  on the  medium- and  long-term  energy  development  plan  (2012\u20132030)  of  Henan \nProvince  (footnote  12),  the  Cleaner  Fuel  Switch  Investment  Program  (2019\u20132030)  supports \nexpansion of the natural gas network and development of biogas in support of a switch to cleaner \nfuels, thereby reducing coal use and improving air quality. The program is being implemented in \n\nProgram Scope \n\n                                                \n16 ZYIG was established in 2011 with a mandate to finance urban and rural development for housing and associated \n\nbasic infrastructure in Henan Province. \n\n17 CTLG was established in 2002 for natural gas supply and sales.

The outcome will be increased use of cleaner fuels by residential, commercial, \nand  industrial  customers  in  Henan  Province  (disbursement-linked  indicators  [DLIs]  1  and  2).22 \nInstitutional capacity enhancement under the RBL program will also lay the foundation to enable \nCNY 915 million of commercial financing (DLI 3), which will sustain investments under the overall \nprogram till 2030. The RBL program will have four outputs. \n \n13.  Output  1:  Gas  network  system  expanded.  The  RBL  will  develop  a  distributed  gas \nsystem including a 26,880 kilometer (km) distribution network (DLI 4), and 12 gas stations (DLI \n5),  thereby  replacing  the  old  coal-burning  facilities.  To  address  affordability  concerns  for  rural \n\n                                                \n22 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fconsumers, the RBL program will offer (i) end pipe connections at no cost; and (ii) an installment \npayment scheme to help purchase gas appliances, such as cooking stoves and heaters. \n \n14.  Output 2: Alternative clean fuel developed. The RBL program will develop a pilot biogas \nplant with an annual production capacity of 17 million Nm3 using the dry anaerobic fermentation \nprocess with agricultural waste to supplement natural gas in the future (DLI 6). The pilot plant will \nbe the first utility-scale dry fermentation technology application for piped gas supply in the PRC, \nproducing high-quality biomethane, which meets the PRC natural gas regulation standards. \n \n15. \nOutput 3: Cleaner fuel use awareness enhanced. The RBL program will help change \nthe use of traditional energy by consumers, and enhance awareness regarding the use of cleaner \nfuels,  and  gas  safety.  It  targets  greater  participation  by  female  customers  (at  least  50%  of \nparticipants) in the cleaner fuel awareness campaign that includes the benefit of gas for cooking \nand heating, the use of gas appliances, and safety of gas use. Continuous implementation of the \nawareness campaign will be essential to meet increased gas connection and consumption targets \nunder  the  RBL  program;  at  least  500  awareness  campaigns  will  be  convened  throughout  the \nprogram implementation period (DLI 7). \n \n16.  Output 4: Institutional and organizational capacity enhanced. The RBL program will \nsupport  institutional  and  organizational  capacity  enhancement  of  ZYIG  and  YTNE  to  sustain \noverall  program  implementation,  including  after  completion  of  the  RBL  program  (DLI  8).  This \nincludes (i) developing an integrated enterprise resource planning and management system; (ii) \nstrengthening corporate governance and management systems in financial and risk control, and \nenvironment  and  social  safeguard  management;  (iii)  expanding  fund-raising  capacity  and \nfinancing avenues for commercial borrowing; and (iv) increasing staff resources to ensure sound \nprogram implementation, with a gender balance target of increasing the proportion of female staff \nmembers, from 15% in 2018 to 30% by 2022. \n \nEight  DLIs  were  selected  to  effectively  promote  the  use  of  cleaner  fuels  through  the \n17. \ndevelopment  of  the  gas  infrastructure;  technology  development  through  the  use  of  advanced \nbiogas  fermentation  technology;  private  sector  involvement  for  efficient  service  delivery  and \nsustainable  funding;  and  behavioral  changes  among  end-users,  with  particular  attention  on \ngender. The program is projected to reach a total of 1.2 million customers, with gas consumption \nof 316.63 million m3 per year. The RBL program is focused on core results; therefore, 55% of the \ntotal  ADB  loan  amount  is  allocated  to  DLIs  1,  2,  and  3.

The Government of the PRC has requested a regular loan of \u20ac269.0 \nmillion  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (48.3%)  to  help  finance  the  program.  China \nDevelopment Bank will loan \u20ac185.2 million (33.3%). The balance of \u20ac102.4 million will be financed \nby  the  program  implementing  agencies.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  Based  on  the  straight-line \nmethod,  average maturity  is  15.25  years,  and maturity  premium  payable  to  ADB  is  0.10%  per \nyear.

Financing of prior results achieved not more than 12 months before loan \nsigning is allowed to support achieving the results as scheduled, given that such activities comply \nwith  the  PAP  and  the  results  are  verified  in  accordance  with  verification  protocols.  The  total \namount of such financing will not exceed 20% of total amount. Except for DLIs 7 and 8, partial \ndisbursement  is  allowed  in  proportion  to  the  DLI  target  achievements,  provided  that  these  are \nverified  and  accepted  by  ADB.  Disbursements  may  be  made  early  or  late  subject  to  the  DLI \nachievements. This means that, regardless of the DLI target years, disbursements can be made \nonly when the set targets are met during the RBL program. Verification mechanism and protocols \nhave been established depending on the nature of the DLIs (Appendix 3). \n \nF. \n \n22. \nExtensive assessments have identified capacity gaps in implementing the RBL program. \nAn  initial  PAP  was  prepared  and  agreed  with  ZYIG  and  YTNE  to  define  specific  activities  for \nimproving the program implementation capacity, as targeted in DLIs for the program\u2019s outputs for \nfinancial \ninstitutional  capacity  enhancement.  The  PAP  covers  corporate  governance, \nmanagement, environment and social safeguards, procurement and anticorruption, and gender \ndevelopment.  The  PAP  is  based  on  the  capacity  gap  assessments  in  implementing  the  initial \nstage of the program to achieve the overall outreach target. \n \nG. \n \n23. \nThe executing agency is the Government of Henan Province, with overall responsibility for \nexecuting the program. The implementing agencies are ZYIG and YTNE, which are responsible \nfor implementing and monitoring the program\u2019s activities. The program coordination committee \nwill  be  established  among  ZYIG,  YTNE,  and  provincial  government  agencies  to  oversee  the \nprogram implementation and provide strategic guidance and direction. The ADB financing would \nbe  onlent  from  the  Government  of  the  PRC  to  the  Government  of  Henan  Province  for  further \nrelending  to  ZYIG,  with  further  onlending  of  the  proceeds  to  YTNE  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions.  YTNE  will  assume  the  ADB  loan\u2019s  foreign  exchange  risk. 23 Concluding  onlending \narrangements  across  the  Henan  Provincial  Government  (HPG),  ZYIG,  and  YTNE  will  be  a \ncondition of the first ADB loan withdrawal. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nIII. \n\nSUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n\nProgram Technical Assessments \n\n \nA. \n \n24. \nThe RBL program\u2019s technical assessment indicates that the design of gas networks and \ngas  stations  fully  complied  with  the  national  construction  standards,  and  the  associated  cost \nestimate reflects the actual construction cost from natural gas supply projects implemented by \nCTLG.  The  biogas  dry  fermentation  technology  is  proven  in  Europe  but  this  will  be  the  first \napplication to piped gas supply in the PRC. The biogas design fully meets international standards \nand the estimated capital cost is the range of international costs. The first-of-its-kind technology \nrisk in the PRC can be controlled by engaging an experienced international technology supplier. \nThe overall gas safety standard for construction and operation is in accordance with natural gas \nsafety regulations and guidelines in the PRC, which are as stringent as in the United States and \n\n                                                \n23 By 2020, YTNE will establish a foreign currency fluctuation reserve fund, with terms acceptable to ADB, to mitigate \n\nthe foreign currency exchange risk of the ADB loan. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fEurope.24 The gas facilities are designed to detect possible gas leakage at the end-users\u2019 meters, \ndistribution networks, and gas stations. YTNE is also aligned with the operational safety code of \nCTLG, which is compliant with international best practice. \n \nThe  RBL  program\u2019s  scope  is  considered  appropriate to  help sustainably  implement the \n25. \noverall program. The overall cleaner fuel switch program adopts a phased approach with learning-\nby-doing practices to construct and expand the gas supply networks. The RBL program aims to \nsupport the initial stage of the overall program to build practical capacity and knowledge to achieve \nthe  overarching  program  targets  until  2030.  Based  on  successful  implementation  of  the  RBL \nprogram, the overall program is expected to be implemented with additional commercial financing \nand  private  sector  involvement,  which  is  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  ongoing  natural  gas \nderegulation policy (para. 8). The RBL program\u2019s financial and economic assessments found the \nprogram  to  be  financially  viable  and  economically  sustainable. 25  The  institutional  financial \nperformance of YTNE and ZYIG are projected to remain sound under the overall program. \n \n26. \nThe  RBL  program  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender  analysis \nindicates women in the project area are largely responsible for household energy use for heating, \ncooking, and heating water for bathing children and elderly. These activities can be time intensive, \nparticularly for the poorest households that still use coal or firewood. While they are supportive of \nthe introduction of cleaner, faster, and more convenient fuels, women in the project sites want to \nknow more about how to safely use non-traditional fuel. Changing traditional fuel use behavior \namong the targeted population in townships and villages is a challenge to achieving the intended \nresults. Cleaner fuel awareness campaigns under the RBL program will support a change to gas \nuse among end-users and will involve the participation of women (at least 50% of participants) in \nthe campaigns, which will focus on the benefits of gas for cooking and heating, and safe usage \nof gas and gas appliances.26 The campaign will be undertaken on an ongoing basis, with at least \n500 events throughout the implementation period to ensure that a critical mass of users is reached \nand that connection and consumption targets under the RBL program are met. In addition, the \nshare of female staff in YTNE will be doubled, from 15% in 2019 to 30% in 2022. \n \nB. \n \n27.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  systems.  The  existing  YTNE  management  information \nsystem  will  accommodate  the  data  needed  to  monitor  the  overall  program  and  track  DLI \nachievements. However, the present management information system (MIS) comprises separate \nindependent  systems,  with  no  integrated  function  to  comprehensively  cover  customer  service \nmanagement, financial control, procurement and construction, operation and maintenance, and \nsafety  aspects.  The  RBL  program  will  upgrade  the  existing  MIS  into  an  integrated  enterprise \nresource planning system, which is an output-level DLI to be achieved by 2020. To complement \nmonitoring and evaluation systems, an independent verification agent (IVA) will be engaged to \nverify information related to DLIs and to monitor PAP implementation for compliance. The IVA is \nto be selected in accordance with qualification criteria as detailed in the program implementation \ndocument;27 the IVA selection is subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval. To assure the credibility of the \n\nProgram Systems Assessments \n\n                                                \n24 Safety regulation requirements and benchmarks in the PRC are equivalent to those in Europe and the United States. \nFor instance, the benchmark for acceptable gas leakage per 1,000 km pipeline is 0.4 times in both the PRC and the \nUnited States. Actual leakage per 1,000 km is 0.19 times in the PRC while 0.17 times in Europe in 2018. \n\n25 The program\u2019s financial rate of return is 7.76% and economic rate of return is 10.94%. Each is above the benchmark \n\nthreshold under sensitivity tests. \n\n26 In addition to safe usage, the campaign will aim to positively portray the roles of men and women in household energy \n\ntasks to address stereotyping and promote equal sharing of household responsibilities. \n\n27 Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fverification results in a transparent manner, the PAP mandates that ZYIG and YTNE adopt an \ninformation  disclosure  policy  to  share  information  on  progress  and  achievement  of  DLIs  with \ntargeted customers and the public. \n \nFiduciary systems. The program will use ZYIG and YTNE\u2019s fiduciary systems in financial \n28. \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  anticorruption.  Their  financial  management  assessment \nindicates  that  financial  management  systems  are  in  place,  but  that  there  is  room  to  improve \nZYIG\u2019s internal control and risk management systems, which could affect YTNE as the majority \nshareholder.  ZYIG  corporate  governance  strengthening  will  help  ensure  that  overall  program \nmanagement is sustainable and transparent, and build market confidence, which is important in \nattracting more commercial financing following completion of the RBL program. ZYIG\u2019s corporate \ngovernance and YTNE\u2019s institutional capacity will be strengthened by 2020, as included in the \noutput-level DLI and PAP.28 \n \n29. \nGaps  identified  by  the  procurement  assessment  include  (i)  a  shortage  of  experienced \nprocurement staff, (ii) the absence of standard bid documents in compliance with both national \nand ADB procurement policies, and (iii) loose definitions of conflict of interest and related party \ntransaction in national procurement systems. These gaps will be addressed by the PAP, while \nhigh-value  contracts  will  be  excluded  from  the  RBL  program.29 ADB  Guidelines  to  Prevent  or \nMitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for \nPrograms were explained to and agreed with the executing and implementing agencies.30 \n \n30. \nSafeguard  systems.  The  RBL  program  has  been  classified  as  Category  B  for  the \nenvironment and involuntary resettlement, and Category C for indigenous people, in accordance \nwith  the  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  RBL  program  will  not  involve  activities \nclassified as Category A for environment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous people. YTNE \nwill adopt CTLG\u2019s Environment, Health and Safety Policy and has adequate capacity to manage \nthe social and environmental risks associated with RBL program activities. Based on the program \nsafeguard  systems  assessment  (PSSA),31 the  overall  requirements  of  environment  and  social \nsafeguard  assessments,  monitoring,  and  management  were  defined  in  YTNE\u2019s  corporate \ntechnical guidelines for environment and social safeguards. \n \nEnvironment safeguards. Outputs 1 and 2 could have negative environmental impacts \n31. \nduring  construction,  including  soil  erosion,  fugitive  dust,  solid  waste,  and  community  and \noccupational health and safety risks. During operation, potential negative environmental impacts \ninclude gas odor, wastewater, solid waste, noise, and community and occupational health and \nsafety risks. Overall, the PSSA concludes that negative impacts during construction and operation \ncan  be  effectively  minimized  and  mitigated.  Weaknesses  identified  by  the  environmental \nsafeguard risk assessment were (i) the lack of a grievance redress mechanism, (ii) the absence \nof  meaningful  public  consultations  for  projects  classified  as  category  B,  (iii)  the  lack  of \nenvironmental audit and assessment of associated and existing facilities, (iv) the lack of analysis \nof  alternatives,  and  (v)  inadequate  institutional  arrangements  to  monitor  environmental \nmanagement  plan  implementation.  These  gaps  are  addressed  in  the  environment  safeguard \n\n                                                \n28 The  corporate  governance  strengthening  will  include  (i)  issuing  financial  and  risk  management  guidelines;  (ii) \nengaging  an  external  board  of  director  with  oversight  regarding  internal  control  and  risk  assessment;  and  (iii) \nstrengthening  the  corporate  governance  structure  through  establishment  of  the  audit  and  risk  management \ncommittee, and investment decision committee under the board. \n\n29 The amounts are $50 million for works, turnkey and supply, and installation contracts; $30 million for goods; $20 \nmillion for information technology systems and non-consulting services; and $15 million for consulting services. \n\n30 ADB. 2013.

A climate risk assessment has been conducted. Potential climate \nrisks  to  the  program  are  assessed  as  medium,  including  an  increase  in  seasonal  and  annual \ntemperature, precipitation, and the probability of drought severity and duration. These potential \nrisks will be addressed in the technical design. \n \n32. \nSocial  safeguards.  PSSA  has  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  PRC\u2019s  resettlement \nsafeguards.  Output  1  will  involve  (i)  temporary  land  acquisition  impacts  associated  with \ndistribution pipeline installation and (ii) land acquisition for gas stations. Considering the size of \nregulatory and storage facilities in semi-urban and rural areas, the involuntary resettlement and \nland  acquisition  impacts  are  deemed  not  significant. 32 For  output  2,  land  acquisition  will  be \nrequired  for  construction  of  the  pilot  biogas  plant,  but  the  biogas  plant  site  will  be  selected  to \nensure it is classified as Category B for resettlement. Outputs 3 and 4 will not trigger involuntary \nresettlement  impacts.  Gaps  identified  by  the  assessment  include  (i)  lack  of  screening  and \ncategorization;  (ii)  no  requirement  for  resettlement  preparation,  due  diligence  for  past  land \nacquisition, and a social compliance audit for existing facilities; (iii) lack of identification of poor \nand  vulnerable  groups  during  the  involuntary  resettlement  screening  process;  (iv)  inadequate \ndocumentation of consultation and information disclosure activities, and grievances received; (v) \ninadequate social risk analysis; and (vi) inadequate monitoring and evaluation. These gaps will \nbe  addressed  by  the  social  safeguard  technical  guidelines  and  PAP,  including  a  screening \nprocess to ensure that the RBL program will not involve subprojects classified as resettlement \ncategory A. The program is classified as category C for indigenous peoples as it is not expected \nto have any adverse impacts on ethnic minorities. \n \nC. \n \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. The overall RBL program \nrisk was assessed to be moderate. The benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nIntegrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 5: Summary of Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n\n \n \nRisks \nResults-related risks \nSlower adoption of gas and/or use of \ntraditional fuels (e.g., coal, wood, and \nagricultural waste) following physical \ngas connection. \n\nRatings Without \nthe Mitigating \nMeasures \n\nSubstantial \n\nBiogas plant fails to achieve targeted \nproduction volume. \n\nSubstantial \n\nExpenditures and financing risks \nImplementing agencies fail to mobilize \nnecessary financing for continuous \nimplementation of overall program after \nRBL program completion. \n\nSubstantial \n\n \n \nKey Mitigating Measures \n\nThe awareness campaign regarding gas use and \nsafety will stimulate demand among the \ncustomers.
