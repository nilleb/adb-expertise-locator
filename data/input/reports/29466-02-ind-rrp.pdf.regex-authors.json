An initial environmental examination (IEE) and \nAssessment  an  Environmental  Management  Plan  have  been  undertaken. \nA summary IEE was circulated to the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  Board  of  Directors  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on \n7 August 2006. \n   \nProject Description  The supplementary loan for the Kolkata Environmental Improvement \nProject (the Project) will support the Kolkata Municipal Corporation \n(KMC) in achieving the original scope and objectives of the Project: \nthe  Calcutta  (Kolkata)  Environmental  Improvement  Project  (Loan \n1813-IND). The Project will continue to (i) improve environmental \nconditions in the outer areas of Kolkata, (ii) reduce poverty in low-\nincome areas through affordable access to basic urban services, \n(iii) facilitate  community  empowerment  through  participatory \nprocesses, (iv) protect the environment from adverse developmental \nimpacts,  and  (v)  help  the  KMC  develop  as  a  proficient  and \nautonomous municipality. The Project will contribute to achieving the \ntargets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in particular \nMDG 7. \n   \nRationale  Despite initial delays and the subsequent cancellation of part of the \nloan proceeds, implementation of the Project is now in full swing, \nand there are strong justifications for providing the supplementary \nloan.  The  executing  agencies  have  overcome  the  steep  initial \nlearning curve and are now well equipped to complete the scope of \nthe Project as proposed. The Government of West Bengal (GoWB) \nis strongly committed, and during the last 18 months, substantial \nstrengthening  of  project  management  has  been  apparent.  As  of \n10 November 2006, under ADB\u2019s financing, contracts worth $120.7 \nmillion have already been awarded, and the remaining contracts are \nbeing  tendered.  Disbursements  will  soon  follow.  The  request  for \nsupplementary financing meets the criteria under the ADB\u2019s policy \nfor supplementary financing1 as demonstrated by the following: \n \n(i)  The  Project  is  a  priority  for  both  the  GoWB  and  the \nGovernment of India\u2019s development strategy. \n  (ii)  The timely provision of funds is critical for maintaining the \ncurrent momentum and the positive impacts that are already \napparent as a result of the Project.   The  supplementary loan \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. A Review of the Policy on Supplementary Financing: Addressing Challenges and Broader Needs. Manila. ", "iv   \n  is needed to complete improvements in sewerage, drainage, \nand   canal  works   in  an   integral   manner   for  the  entire \narea. If the full project scope were not completed, the impacts \nand objectives envisaged for the Project would be seriously \nundermined,  for  instance,  some  facilities  currently  under \nconstruction would be underutilized or redundant.  \n  (iii)  The  continued  value-added  involvement  of  ADB  in  this \nProject will ensure that the unique ecological characteristics \nof the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW) are maintained through \nthe application of ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and its \naccumulated  knowledge.  In  August  2002,  the  EKW,  into \nwhich some of the treated wastewater from the project areas \n(from Borough VII, part of Borough XI, and Borough XII) is \ndesigned  to  be  discharged,  was  included  in  the  list \nmaintained by the Ramsar Bureau established under Article 8 \nof the Ramsar Convention, which recognizes the EKW as a \n\u201cwetland of international importance\u201d (site number 1208) for \nits  approach  to  treating  the  city  of  Kolkata\u2019s  wastewater, \nwhereby it efficiently recovers nutrients from the wastewater \nand uses the treated water for pisiculture (fish farming) and \nagriculture. This intervention has a significant demonstration \neffect  as  an  urban  sector,  eco-friendly,  best  practice  that \ncould be maximized in India. \n(iv)  The Project remains technically feasible, economically and \nfinancially  viable,  and  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements. By rationalizing and extending the coverage to \na new borough, the most congested and rapidly expanding \narea of Kolkata\u2019s outer peripheries, the Project enhances and \nfurther  strengthens  the  Project\u2019s  original  objectives  and \nextends  its  benefits  to  more  than  150,000  additional \nbeneficiaries than originally envisaged.  \n(v)  The due diligence matrix for ADB\u2019s policy on supplementary \nfinancing has been observed for all steps, and all new or \nrevised policies approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors since \nthe original appraisal of the Project have been taken into \nconsideration  as  required  by  the  policy  on  supplementary \nfinancing. \n(vi)  The  provision  of  this  supplementary  loan  allows  ADB  to \ncontinue  to  assist  the  GoWB  in  its  governance  and \nanticorruption  reforms  and  to  enhance  its  long-term \nrelationship with the GoWB. \n(vii)  The financial health of both the KMC and the GoWB is sound \nas demonstrated by the financial analysis. \n        \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The overall impact of the Project is sustained improvement in the \nenvironmental health and quality of life of residents of the city of \nKolkata.  The  outcomes  of  the  Project  are  (i) the  provision  of \nsewerage  and  drainage  facilities  for  more  than  2  million  people, \n(ii)  an   improvement   in   environmental   conditions   and   reduced ", "  v\n  flooding  incidents  in  Kolkata,  (iii) an  improvement  in  solid  waste \nmanagement  services  for  more  than  5  million  people,  (iv) the \nenhancement of basic urban services for 0.2 million slum dwellers, \nand (v) an improvement in the financial sustainability of  the KMC \nwhereby it can meet all operation and maintenance costs of urban \nservices for which it is responsible. \nProject Investment Plan  The  revised  total  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n$401.4  million,  including  taxes,  duties,  and  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  of  which  the  investment  cost  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary loan is $113.6 million. The supplementary loan from \nADB  financing  is  proposed  to  amount  to  $80  million.  With  the \nproposed supplementary loan, ADB will cover 64.2% of the total \ninvestment requirement for the Project. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A  supplementary  loan  of  $80  million  from  the  ordinary  capital \nresources of ADB will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based  lending facility. The supplementary  loan  \nwill be fully synchronized with the original loan, and will have  a term \nof 19 years, an interest rate determined with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per year, and any \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  Under the revised financing arrangements, the two ADB loans will \nTerms  cover 64.2% of the total investment costs. Of the total investment \ncost, the GoWB will finance 18.5% and the KMC will finance 17.3%. \nThe Government of India will pass the proposed supplementary loan \non to the GoWB as 70% debt on the same terms and conditions as \nfor the original loan and 30% grant. The GoWB will then onlend the \nfull amount of the loan portion to the KMC on the same terms and \nconditions as for the original loan, while the grant portion will also be \npassed on to the KMC as a grant. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 December 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  Implementation arrangements for the proposed supplementary loan \nArrangements  will remain the same as for the original loan for the Project. The two \nproject management units (PMUs) established under each of the \nexecuting  agencies\u2014the  KMC  and  the  Irrigation  and  Waterways \nDepartment\u2014will continue to implement the respective components \nof the Project, i.e., the Irrigation and Waterways Department PMU \nwill continue to be responsible for implementing canal works and the \nKMC PMU will continue to be responsible for implementing all the \nremaining  works  under  the  Project.  To  streamline  project \nmanagement and speed up implementation, the KMC will act as the \nlead  executing  agency  responsible  for  overall  project  planning, \nbudgeting, reporting, and execution and will be ADB\u2019s primary point \nof contact for the Project period. \n   \nExecuting Agencies  Kolkata  Municipal  Corporation  and  Irrigation  and  Waterways \nDepartment \n ", "vi   \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s  \nProcurement  Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time).  \n  All civil works contracts estimated to cost $10 million equivalent or \nmore  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive \nbidding procedures, and civil works contracts estimated to cost less \nthan $10 million will be procured using national competitive bidding \nprocedures. Procurement of goods will, to the extent practicable, \nbe grouped into packages larger than $1 million to be suitable for \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Goods that cannot be \ngrouped into larger contracts and are estimated to cost less than \n$1 million per contract will be procured following national competitive \nbidding  or  limited  international  bidding  procedures,  and \nmiscellaneous minor goods estimated to cost less than $100,000 will \nbe  purchased  following  shopping  procedures.  All  civil  works, \nequipment purchases, and consulting contracts under the proposed \nsupplementary  loan  will  be  separate  from  contracts  under  the \noriginal loan for the Project. \n  \nConsulting Services  Under the original loan for the Project, and following ADB\u2019s quality-\nbased  selection  procedures,  an  international  consulting  firm  has \nalready been engaged as the project management consultant and a \nnational  consulting  firm  has  been  engaged  as  the  design  and \nconstruction supervision consultant. Additional consulting services\u2014\n63  person-months  for  the  project  management  consultant  and \n367  person-months  for  the  design  and  construction  supervision \nconsultant\u2014will  be  required  to  implement  the  Project,  including \nworks  under  the  proposed  supplementary  loan.  The  proposed \nadditional  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  the  current \nconsulting firms, which will be engaged under the supplementary \nloan  through  single  source  selection  procedures  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from \ntime to time). Each of the firms will be requested to provide a biodata \ntechnical  proposal  for  review  by  the  KMC  and  ADB  and  for \nsubsequent negotiations. In addition, a national firm will be engaged \nas creative consultants for 30 person-months in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedures. \nProject Benefits and  The Project will provide sewerage and drainage facilities for more \nBeneficiaries  than 2 million people, improved environmental conditions and solid \nwaste management services for more than 5 million people, and \nenhanced basic urban services for 0.2 million slum dwellers. With an \nincrease in the number of beneficiaries by more than 150,000 and in \nthe number of property connections to sewer lines by 30,200 (the \noriginal target was 90,000 whereas the revised target is 120,200), \nthe  proposed  supplementary  loan  will  further  refine  the  Project\u2019s \nscope, coverage, and benefits. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Risks and assumptions originally identified under the Project were \n  reassessed to establish continued and additional risks to the Project, \n  including those specific to the proposed supplementary loan, and \nmitigation measures are proposed. Key risks identified during the \noriginal  Project  appraisal  pertained to (i)  land  acquisition,  (ii) user ", "  vii\n  charges,  (iii) rationalization  of  the  KMC\u2019s  staff,  (iv) property  tax \nreforms, and (v) state of the GoWB\u2019s finances. Significant progress \nwith land acquisition for the Project, comprehensive  analysis  of  the \nfinancial soundness of the GoWB   and  the  KMC,  and  progress  \nwith the KMC Capacity-Building Program under the Department for \nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  grant  provide \nadequate  assurances  that  risks  (i),  (iii),  and  (v)  have  been \nminimized,  including  for  the  supplementary  loan.  With  regard  to \nproperty tax reforms, the KMC has already prepared and ratified the \nnecessary  legal  documents  and  forwarded  them  to  the  legal \nassembly of the GoWB. The GoWB has provided  assurances  that  \na  relevant  act  will be effected by the end of fiscal year 2007. \nFurthermore, the original objective of property tax reforms was to \nstrengthen the ailing financial standing of the GoWB, which is not the \ncase anymore, as demonstrated by the new financial analysis of the \nGoWB and the KMC. The loan covenant on introducing user charges \nfor domestic water and sewerage consumption is still outstanding, \nand  the  risk  in  relation  to  this  aspect  of  the  Project  remains. \nTo  minimize  this  risk,  a  phased  and  realistic  road  map  for  tariff \nimplementation,  with  firm  milestones,  has  been  agreed  with  the \nGoWB and the KMC to achieve the original objectives of the Project. \nSuch a road map has been reflected in additional covenants in the \nproposed Loan Agreement for supplementary financing. \n \nThe  risk  of  delayed  implementation,  as  experienced  in  the  early \nyears of Project implementation, is minimal, as the capacity and \nmandate  of  the  PMUs  were  significantly  enhanced  in  the  last \n2  years  and  the  PMUs  have  already  completed  detailed  design, \ntender  document  preparation,  and  land  acquisition  for  all  the \nremaining  major  contracts  under  the  Project,  including  contracts \nunder the proposed supplementary loan. \n ", "  ix\n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary loan to India for the Kolkata Environmental Improvement Project.1 A revised design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Rationale \n \n2.  According to India\u2019s 2001 population census, more than 285 million people (27.8% of the \ntotal population) live in urban areas. Given current trends in population growth and migration,  \nthe urban population is estimated to reach 575 million by 2030. Estimates indicate that the urban \nsector contributes 50\u201352% of India\u2019s gross domestic product. Sixty-five percent of employment in \ntrade, commerce, and financial services; 65% of manufacturing employment; and 68% of transport \nsector employment are concentrated in urban areas. Despite the significance of the urban sector, \npoverty,  inadequate  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  and  environmental  degradation  are \nwidespread in India\u2019s cities. Poor urban management is not only undermining India\u2019s ability to \ndeliver a good quality of life to its citizens, but is also constraining potential local and national \neconomic growth. Estimates indicate that one third of India\u2019s urban population lives below the \npoverty  line.  The  provision  of  basic  infrastructure  facilities  and  services,  and  consequent \nenvironmental health conditions, is poor for many segments of society, but especially for those \nliving in slums and poorer communities, where conditions are rapidly deteriorating. The need for a \nstrong focus on and accelerated investment in urban development is clear. \n \n3.  Kolkata, the capital of the state of West Bengal, is one of India\u2019s most populous cities. \nAccording  to  the  2001  census,  Kolkata  has  a  population  of  4.58  million,  while  the  urban \nagglomeration  as  a  whole  houses  an  estimated  13.20  million  people.  Kolkata\u2019s  municipal \nadministration dates back to 1727. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) Act (1980) is a \nprogressive piece of legislation that contains many of the reforms currently under consideration in \nIndia\u2019s urban sector and was enacted well before the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which \ndelegated  power  to  from  the  central  Government  to  local  bodies.  The  KMC  is  made  up  of  \n15 boroughs subdivided into 141 wards. Some 36,000 executive officers and staff carry out the \nmunicipality\u2019s functions. \n \n4.  The KMC\u2019s average population density is more than 24,000 people per square kilometer, \none of the highest population densities in India. While more than 85% of the KMC\u2019s population has \naccess to piped water, only 50% of the KMC\u2019s population has a sewer connection, and in the outer \nareas this figure drops to about 17%. Sewage and storm water from the inner core area of Kolkata \nare conveyed by artificially created channels referred to as dry weather flow (DWF) channels and \nstorm water flow channels, respectively. Both types of channels flow through the East Kolkata \nWetlands (EKW) before eventually entering the Kulti River. Kolkata\u2019s flat topography necessitates \npumping virtually all sewage and storm water to the points of discharge: either sewage treatment \nplants (STPs) or the DWF and storm water flow channels. The flat topography also leads to severe \nand rapid silting of many of the channels, which aggravates flooding. The extent of solid waste \ncollection is quite high in the inner core areas, covering about 70\u201390% of the urban population, \nwhereas collection efficiency in the outer areas is much lower. Registered bustees (slum or low-\nincome communities) represent around 30% of the population, with unregistered bustees and \nillegal squatters accounting for approximately an additional 9%. \n \n5.  In the 1990s, faced with severe environmental degradation and a growing urban poverty \nproblem, the Government of West Bengal (GoWB) prepared two long-term documents: the Basic \n                                                 \n1  The name of the original Project was the Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project, which has now been changed \nto the Kolkata Environmental Improvement Project, because the name of the city has changed officially from Calcutta \nto Kolkata. ", "2   \nDevelopment Plan and the Master Plan for Water Supply, Sewerage, and Drainage, Kolkata \nMetropolitan  District  (1996\u20132001).  These  plans,  which  address  the  institutional  and  planning \naspects  of  development  as  well  as  its  physical  investment  requirements,  have  since  been \nprogressively  implemented.  Kolkata  has  also  benefited  from  India\u2019s  Megacity  Scheme,  which \npromotes the establishment of revolving funds for sustained investment in urban infrastructure \nthrough the adoption of direct and indirect cost-recovery measures, and the Bustee Improvement \nProgram,  whose  implementation  began  in  1970  and  focuses  on  sanitation.  Loan  1813-IND: \nCalcutta (Kolkata) Environmental Improvement Project2 was founded on these plans and schemes \nand takes Kolkata\u2019s pressing urban needs into account. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n6.  On  19  December  2000,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Calcutta \n(Kolkata) Environmental Improvement Project (the Project) for $250 million to help the GoWB \nimprove sanitation in the outer areas of the municipality of Kolkata. The Project became effective \non 16 April 2002 and has a closing date of 31 December 2007. The Project components are (i) part \nA: stakeholder consultation program, (ii) part B: sewerage and drainage (S&D) improvements, \n(iii) part  C:  solid  waste  management,  (iv) part  D:  slum  improvements,  (v) part  E:  canal \nimprovements,  and  (vi) part  F:  implementation  assistance  and  capacity  building.  In  parallel,  \na $42 million Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom grant is \nsupporting modernization and strengthening of the KMC. The project area covers boroughs I, VII, \nXI, XII, XIII, XIV, and XV for part B, while physical works under parts A, C, D, E, and F cover \ndifferent boroughs. \n \n7.  The Project\u2019s objectives are to (i) improve environmental conditions in the outer areas of \nKolkata, (ii) reduce poverty in low-income areas by means of affordable access to basic urban \nservices, (iii) facilitate community empowerment through participatory processes, (iv) protect the \nenvironment from adverse developmental impacts, and (v) help the KMC develop into a proficient \nand autonomous municipality.3 \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n8.  The total cost of the Project was estimated at $360 million equivalent, including duties and \ntaxes. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the original cost estimates and the financing plan, respectively. \n \n9.  Of the total cost of $360 million, ADB provided a loan of $250 million (the original loan) from \nits ordinary capital resources (OCR), representing approximately 69% of the total original project \ncost. The original loan was for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 6 years. The original \nloan, which initially consisted of a pool-based loan and a London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased loan, was changed in July 2002 to an entirely LIBOR-based loan, and the amortization \nschedule was adjusted accordingly as determined in accordance with interest rates under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based loan regulations. \n \n10.  The Government of India passed the original loan to the GoWB as 70% ($175 million) debt \nand 30% ($75 million) grant. GoWB then onlent the full amount of the loan portion to KMC on \nterms  acceptable  to  ADB,  while  the  grant  portion  was  passed  on  to  KMC  also  as  a  grant.  \nIn addition, the GoWB provided further budgetary support of $54.6 million, of which $9.17 million \nwas allocated to the Irrigation and Waterways Department (I&WD), the second executing agency \nfor the Project (the KMC was the first), as a grant to meet the cost of canal improvements and \nresettlement, and $45.43 million was allocated as a grant to the KMC. \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000.

In  2003,  to  reduce  the  GoWB\u2019s  debt  burden,  the  Government  of  India  requested  the \ncancellation of $30 million of the original loan based on the expectation prevailing at the time that \nthe Indian rupee would continue its depreciation against the US dollar and that prices would be \nrelatively stable. Subsequently, in 2005, the Government of India requested the cancellation of \n$42.2 million allocated for interest during construction, which was no longer necessary, as the \nGovernment had changed its policy and started paying interest during construction when it became \ndue rather than capitalizing it. An additional rationale for these cancellations was that India had a \nfew nonperforming urban projects that eventually had to be cancelled. Thus, the Government was \nseriously concerned that this Project would remain nonperforming, and might have to be cancelled \neventually as well, because no significant project implementation took place for almost 4 years \ninitially and little progress was apparent. \n \n12.  During the last 18 months, however, the Project has seen substantial strengthening of \nproject management and speedy progress of project implementation (para. 13). At the same time, \nstrong  growth  of  the  overall  Indian  economy  in  recent  years  has  resulted  in  major  inflation, \nespecially in construction prices across the country, and in strengthening of the Indian rupee \nagainst the US dollar. As a result, a significant financial gap became evident in the Project, which \nis now performing well. The KMC attempted to reshuffle and rationalize the use of available funds \nby  cutting  the  physical  scope  of  the  S&D  and  canal  improvement  components,  but  these \n ", "4   \ncomponents, in particular, the S&D works, constitute integral packages of network development, \ntherefore partial reduction of the physical scope of the Project would seriously undermine the \nimpacts  envisaged  under  the  Project  and  jeopardize  achievement  of  the  Project\u2019s  objectives.  \nFor instance, some facilities currently under construction would be underutilized or would be \nredundant unless the full Project scope were to be completed. Note also that current rationalization \nof the Project scope would result in more than 150,000 additional project beneficiaries under the \nS&D improvement component.  \n \nD.  Status and Progress of Project Implementation \n1.  Summary of Project Implementation Progress \n13.  Despite significant start-up delays, the executing agencies are strongly committed and \nproject implementation is now progressing steadily, as seen in the expeditious tendering and \nimplementation of contracts over the last 18 months. This is a result of a major initiative undertaken \nby the GoWB in 2004\u20132005 to reorganize and strengthen the project management units (PMUs) in \norder to speed up project implementation (Appendix 2 provides details on measures introduced by \nthe  executing  agencies).  As  of  10  November  2006,  under  ADB  financing,  contracts  worth  \n$120.7 million have been awarded under the Project. Even though only $30.8 million of ADB \nfinancing has been disbursed so far, the PMUs are projecting expenditure of $50 million by the end \nof fiscal year (FY) 2007 based on work progress and contractors\u2019 projections. The remaining \ncontracts are in the final stages of detailed design and tender document preparation. ADB\u2019s Loan \nFinancial  Information  System4 report  rates  the Project  as partially  satisfactory  based  on  past \ndelays. All civil works and equipment purchase contracts are expected to be awarded by the end of \n2007, including packages under the proposed supplementary loan, and no further time overrun is \nexpected under the Project. Appendix 3 provides details of the implementation status of each \ncomponent of the Project.  \n \n2.  Compliance Review \n14.  A comprehensive assessment of compliance with the original loan covenants was carried \nout and is summarized in Appendix 4. Two major covenants that remain outstanding are (i) the \nintroduction of an area-based property tax, and (ii) the introduction of water and sewerage tariffs. \nWith regard to property tax reform, the KMC has already prepared, ratified, and forwarded the \nnecessary legal documents to the provincial legal assembly of the GoWB and the GoWB has \nprovided assurances that a relevant act will be approved by its legal assembly by the end of \nFY2007. Based on lessons from project implementation, GoWB, ADB and KMC agreed that a more \nphased tariff implementation road map, with firm milestones, is needed to achieve the original \nobjectives of the Project. Such a road map has been reflected in additional covenants in the \nproposed Loan Agreement for supplementary financing. For example, the KMC has agreed to \ninitially introduce a flat-rate tariff by 30 June 2007. Subsequently, the KMC will install at least \n100,000 household water meters, conduct the necessary preparatory tariff analysis, and reassess \nwillingness to pay by updating an earlier study5 by March 2007. \n \n15.  Environment.  Supplementary  Appendix  A  presents  a  review  of  compliance  with \nenvironmental safeguards. The assessment indicates that mitigation measures proposed in the \noriginal initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Project have been incorporated in bidding \ndocuments.  The  executing  agencies  have  prepared  the  necessary  environmental  assessment \ndocuments, such as IEEs, prior to commencement of works in all boroughs. These separate IEEs \nhave now been incorporated in the revised IEE for the Project. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006. Loan Financial Information System Report. Manila \n5  A willingness-to-pay study was conducted in 2000 with the assistance of the World Bank (Weston International, USA, \net al. November 2001. An Assessment of Social Aspects and Willingness to Pay: Project Preparation Studies for \nCalcutta Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Projects, World Bank Project No. P.O.50648. Kolkata). ", "    5    \n16.  The Project was originally classified as category B for environment in 2000 when it was \napproved. However, in August 2002, the EKW, into which some of the treated wastewater from the \nproject  areas  (from  Borough  VII,  part  of  Borough  XI,  and  Borough  XII)  is  designed  to  be \ndischarged, was included in the list maintained by the Ramsar Bureau established under Article 8 \nof the Ramsar Convention, which recognizes the EKW as a \u201cwetland of international importance\u201d \n(site  number  1208)  for  its  approach  to  treating  the  city  of  Kolkata\u2019s  wastewater,  whereby  it \nefficiently recovers nutrients from the wastewater and uses the treated water for pisiculture (fish \nfarming) and agriculture. This designation of the receiving water body has resulted in the Project \nbeing reclassified as category B (sensitive) for environment under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines.6 Furthermore, the KMC is currently conducting \na comprehensive study of the Project\u2019s potential environmental impacts on the EKW in order to \npropose dropping two STPs from the Project and instead discharging the sewage from Borough \nVII, part of Borough XI, and Borough XII) into the DWF channel to be treated through the fisheries \nin the EKW. The DWF channel is an artificial channel that carries wastewater from almost the \nentire core of the city to the Kulti River, after traveling a distance of more than 30 kilometers (km), \nwhere it undergoes a process of natural treatment through fisheries and agriculture in the EKW \narea.  \n \n17.  Social Safeguards. The Project was classified as category A for involuntary resettlement in \n2000. A resettlement plan was prepared in 2000. Changes in design and physical scope during \nproject implementation have increased the number of affected persons for the canal improvement \ncomponent  by  3%,  but  the  current  project  design  and  scope  will  nevertheless  have  similar \nresettlement impacts as originally envisaged under the Project. Compliance assessment shows \nthat  implementation  of  the  Project  in  general  has  been  in  accordance  with  the  original  loan \ncovenants and relevant ADB policies. \n \n18.  An updated resettlement plan is required7 because (i) a detailed Project design is now \navailable, (ii) there are some modifications in the Project\u2019s scope and design, and (iii) entitlements \nfor affected persons have changed. The Project is providing improved compensation for those \naffected by canal improvements. Salient issues that need to be addressed include ensuring that \nthe updated resettlement plan includes (i)  revision of the number of affected persons based on the \nupdated socioeconomic information, including a census of highly vulnerable persons; (ii) inventory \nof  common  property  losses;  (iii) strategies  on  income  restoration  and  social  support; \n(iv) documentation  on  land  acquired,  particularly  private  land,  ensuring  consistency  with  the \nresettlement plan and loan agreements; (v) assessment of temporary impacts in relation to S&D \nimprovements and subsequent entitlements; (vi) detailed budget and flow of funds; and (vii) full \ndocumentation of disclosure and consultation activities. Recommendations on and a review of \ncompliance  with  the  resettlement  plan  implementation  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  \nThe executing agencies have prepared an updated resettlement plan.8 \n \n19.  Gender issues have been carefully integrated into project planning, including resettlement \nplanning and implementation. During the stakeholder consultation process, specific consultations \nwere carried out separately for female groups to provide information on various issues such as \nappropriate  entitlements,  formation  and  role  of  user  groups,  self-help  groups,  and  field-level \nmonitoring committees, in order to address women\u2019s concerns and to motivate and support their \nparticipation in the planning and implementation of project works at the local level. Female-headed \nhouseholds are considered to be vulnerable and are accorded additional entitlements.9 In addition, \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n7  Para. 28, p. 41, of the original Loan Agreement. \n8  The updated resettlement plan was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 22 August 2006. \n9  To assist the highly vulnerable, the Project will provide them with first-floor Valmiki Ambedkar Shahari Aawas Yojna \n(VAMBAY) apartments, which have commercial possibilities, provide access to land for social forestry and vegetable \nor other crop production along rehabilitated canal banks, and facilitate access to Government livelihood and other \nsocial programs. VAMBAY is a scheme of the Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation of the \nGovernment of India. This scheme, launched in December 2001, provides  grant subsidy for construction and \nrehabilitation of the dwelling units for the slum dwellers and the population living below the poverty line. \n ", "6   \nlegal titles will be in the name of women, and thus the Project will help promote the empowerment \nof  women.10 Other  project  actions  consistent  with  gender  development  are  (i) ensuring  an \nadequate gender balance among the PMUs\u2019 staff; (ii) addressing and monitoring gender issues;11 \n(iii) ensuring that women benefit from poverty alleviation schemes for the urban poor, from the \nformation of women\u2019s self-help groups, and from vocational training provided for such groups;12 \nand (iv) empowering women through gender sensitization, participation, and training. \n \n3.  Lessons  \n20.  Past urban development projects in India, including the Project, experienced significant \ndelays in the executing agencies undertaking initial activities during the project start-up period. \nThese  resulted  in  both  time  and  cost  overruns,  leading  to  the  Borrower  incurring  undue \ncommitment charges. Indeed, the cancellations of some of the loan proceeds under the Project \nwere closely related to the accumulation of commitment charges accruing from significant start-up \ndelays. To give the executing agencies more time to carry out project start-up activities, the \nGovernment of India also tended to delay loan signing for as long as possible following approval by \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors, thereby reducing the commitment charges payable. For instance, in the \ncase of the Project, the loan signing was delayed by 12 months. Furthermore, unlike experienced \nnational agencies, such as the National Highway Authority of India or other central government \nentities, at the time of project appraisal, state governments and local urban bodies do not have \ndedicated PMUs that can take on advance procurement activities. Thus a new PMU has to be \ncreated for implementing each ADB loan project with staff deputed from several state government \nagencies or specifically hired for the purpose. This implies that PMUs\u2019 capacities to take on project-\nrelated work, especially their understanding of ADB procedures and requirements, need to be built \nup from scratch, which takes time. \n \n21.  It was therefore apparent that consultant support would be required not just at the detailed \nengineering design and supervision stage, but also at the project preparatory stage. In the absence \nof retroactive financing arrangements, state governments had to wait for loans to be signed and \nmade effective to mobilize consultants, which is why, under the Project, appointing consultants \nafter  the  loan  signing  took  11  months.  Such  initial  delays  in  appointing  consultants  have  a \nsignificant  impact  on  subsequent  project  implementation,  because  the  preparation  of  generic \nprequalification and standard bidding documents, detailed engineering surveys, and specific tender \ndocuments  can  only  take  place  after  the  project  management  and  design  and  construction \nsupervision consultants are in place. As a result, in the case of the Project, it took more than  \n2 years after the appointment of the consultants to award the first major civil works contract. \n \n22.  Both the Government of India and ADB found these significant start-up delays and resulting \ntime and cost overruns to be excessively costly. To overcome these start-up delays, in 2003 and \n2004, Government and ADB representatives participated in extensive discussions and reviews \npertaining to urban sector projects in India. For its part, the Government of India agreed to set up \ndedicated PMUs at the time of project appraisal, while ADB agreed to provide support to executing \nagencies  to  (i) establish  project  management  and  implementation  units  far  ahead  of  loan \neffectiveness; (ii) strengthen the managerial and institutional capabilities of such units; (iii) help \ndevelop tender documents, select consultants, and prequalify contractors; (iv) familiarize project \nstaff with ADB policies and procedures; and (v) develop a strong sense of ownership among state \nand  municipal  governments  and  promote    public  participation.  The  experience  of  providing \nadvance support to the executing agencies was successful and it has now been adopted in all \nurban projects in India and other South Asian countries. \n                                                 \n10 These apartments come with legal titles for occupants, turning informal dwellers on government lands to legal owners \nof well-built apartments. \n11 This is included in the implementation schedule for the resettlement plan, especially domestic violence issues. \n12 The Project has introduced skills training programs, self-help groups, and financing support for the self-help groups as \nadditional measures to augment the income levels of affected families. Women are the main beneficiaries of programs \ncurrently run at the Nonadanga relocation site. ", "    7    \n \n4.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n23.  As substantial physical progress only started in the last 18 months, the Project\u2019s benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation (BME) process has been delayed. However, the collection of baseline \ndata on indicators to be used for monitoring project outputs and benefits has been completed for all \nworks, and the data will be used during the comprehensive midterm review of the Project, which is \nscheduled for December 2007. After completion, the Project is expected to provide (i) S&D facilities \nfor more than 2 million people, (ii) improved solid waste management facilities for more than  \n5 million people, and (iii) improved basic urban services for 0.2 million slum dwellers. \n \n24.  With  assistance  from  nongovernment  organizations  and  consultants,  the  Project  has \nconducted extensive consultations with affected families, local leaders, and other stakeholders on \nvarious social development issues. Using those inputs, the Project has moved forward with a \nnumber of schemes designed to extend short-term and long-term benefits to the urban poor, \nincluding vocational training, insurance schemes, and health and hygiene awareness programs. \nSelf-help groups are being established, and the Social Development Unit is coordinating with \nseveral government agencies to ensure that the schemes dovetail with their own schemes. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \n \nA.  Cost Overrun \n \n25.  During detailed design and project implementation, the physical scope of the Project has \nundergone some modifications and changes, and the unit costs of goods and materials have risen \nsignificantly since 1999, when the original cost estimates for the Project were prepared. Based on \nrevised cost estimates, the overall increase in the project cost is $113.6 million, which is around \n32% of the original total project cost estimate ($360.0 million) and around 39% of the currently \navailable  total  Project  funds  ($287.8  million).  S&D  improvements,  canal  improvements,  and \nimplementation  assistance  are  the  major  project  components  for  which  cost  overruns  are \nsignificant. Additional funds for contingencies are also required. Major factors causing project cost \noverruns  include  (i) price  increases  caused  by  general  inflation;  (ii) physical  changes  in  the \nProject\u2019s design and scope; and (iii) cost underestimation at the appraisal stage, in particular,  \nof market rates for construction works and materials. \n \n26.  Further analysis of the cost overrun shows that in monetary terms, of the total cost overrun \nof $113.6 million, $99.5 million is for civil works (87.5% of the total cost overrun); followed by  \n$9.4 million for contingencies (8.2%); $8.0 million for consultancy costs (7.1%); $3.9 million for \ntaxes  and  duties  (3.4%);  $3.1  million  for  incremental  administration  (2.8%);  $1.8  million  for \nresettlement (1.6%); and $0.3 million for land acquisition(0.2%). At the same time, project cost \nreductions occurred in two expenditure categories that include equipment ($12.3 million) and the \nsmall-scale loan facility ($0.1 million) resulting mainly from changes in the Project\u2019s design and/or \nscope. \n \n27.  The cost overrun is due primarily to price escalation from 1999 to 2005, which accounted \nfor 37% of the escalation in total project costs, with the balance explained by changes in the \nProject\u2019s scope and/ or design (30%) and cost underestimation at the original appraisal stage \n(33%). In particular, civil works, which constitute about 70% of the revised cost estimate, witnessed \na cost escalation of 55%. \n \n28.  Price  Escalation. The average annual inflation rate, based on India\u2019s wholesale price \nindex, was around 5% during 1999\u20132005; however, during this period, inflation fluctuated from \nyear to year and for different commodity groups in particular years. While average inflation for all \ncommodity groups was around 4.8% during this period, major construction materials such as iron \nand steel and cement recorded higher inflation rates of 7.7% and 5.5%, respectively. Considering \nthe composition of construction materials in project costs, the price escalation for the Project is \n ", "8   \nestimated at 5.5% per year. The price contingencies provided under the original Project, amounting \nto 12% of the base cost, were thus insufficient to cover the real price increase of around 37%.  \n \n29.  Cost Increase Resulting from Changes in Project Scope and/or Design. During the \ndetailed design and implementation of the Project, it has undergone some changes in design and \nphysical scope as noted earlier, including the inclusion of Borough VII, the changes in the canal \nimprovement  works,  an  increase  in  the  number  of  project-affected  persons  to  be  resettled, \nchanges in the entitlements for the affected families a reduction in the equipment component, and \nan increase in project implementation assistance caused by the delay in implementation. Based on \na cost estimate analysis broken down by component (Appendix 5), of the total cost increase \nresulting from such changes (30%), changes in project scope contribute around 13% and the \nbalance, i.e., 17%, can be explained by design changes, such as the change from a separate to a \ncombined sewer system and increase in number of pumping stations required for the system. \n \n30.  Cost Increase due to Underestimation. Engineers\u2019 cost estimates during the original \nProject appraisal, which were subsequently reflected in tender documents, were based on the \nschedule  of  rates  (state-imposed  ceilings  on  rates  that  are  periodically  updated  but  do  not \nnecessarily reflect market rates). The bids for the tendered contracts under the Project indicated \nthat the variation between the engineers\u2019 estimates and the bid amounts has been rather large. \nThe  cost  increase  due  to  this  underestimation  amounts  to  33%  of  the  total  cost  overrun.  \nThe highest variation (38%) between the estimates and the lowest bid values was observed in the \nS&D improvements packages (Appendix 5). Appendix 5 includes further details at cost overrun and \nprice escalation analysis. \n \nB.  Key Physical Changes and Design Modifications \n31.  In 2003, the GoWB decided to build a centrally located biomedical and hazardous waste \nmanagement  facility  as  part  of  a  build-own-and-transfer  scheme  for  the  city  rather  than \nconstructing the facility as originally expected under the Project. Therefore, following a request \nfrom the Government of India, $19 million originally allocated for this component was reallocated to \nallow additional S&D improvement works in various wards of Borough VII. Borough VII is the most \ncongested, populous, and rapidly expanding area in the outer periphery of the city and is currently \ndischarging  its  sewage  into  canals,  thereby  creating  a  significant  environmental  hazard.  \nIts inclusion in the Project was considered necessary because it would not only benefit the largest \nnumber  of  beneficiaries  per  unit  investment,  thereby  giving  the  largest  return  on  investment,  \nit would also result in the largest corresponding improvement in Kolkata\u2019s environmental sanitation. \nSome items of equipment were also dropped from the solid waste management component, as \nthey had either already been purchased by the KMC with its own funds (because of earlier delays \nin project implementation) or are no longer required because of the planned outsourcing of solid \nwaste management responsibilities. \n \n32.  The sanitary landfill site previously identified under the Project now falls within the EKW \nboundary, which is now a wetland protected under the Ramsar Convention. Therefore, the KMC \nhas agreed to identify an alternative parcel of KMC land for the sanitary landfill site. \n \n33.  As already mentioned, the KMC is currently conducting a comprehensive study to identify \nthe Project\u2019s potential environmental impacts on the EKW to propose dropping the two STPs from \nthe Project and instead discharging the sewage from Borough VII, part of Borough XI, and Borough \nXII into the DWF channel to be treated through the fisheries in the EKW. \n \n34.  Appendix 6 summarizes all physical changes and their rationales.  \n \nC.  Impact on the Project \n35.  The proposed supplementary loan will support the KMC in achieving the original objectives \nof the Project (para. 7), and will cover cost-overruns and modified activities under the following ", "    9    \nparts of the Project: (i) part B: Sewerage and Drainage Improvement; (ii) part C: Solid Waste \nManagement; (iii) part E: Canal Improvements; and (iv) part F: Implementation Assistance and \nCapacity Building. In particular, the proposed supplementary loan will cover civil works contracts \nfor S&D improvement works in boroughs VII and XV, STP construction for sewage effluent from \nBorough  VII,  rehabilitation  works  in  the  Churial  canal,  pumping  station  at  Gushighata,  and \nadditional consulting services. The supplementary loan is required to complete the full scope of the \nProject and is crucial for sustaining the current momentum and impacts already apparent under the \nProject and ensuring that its objectives and impacts are achieved. \n \n36.  For ease of administration and monitoring, contracts for civil works and consulting services \nunder the proposed supplementary loan have been completely separated from the original loan for \nthe  Project.  A  procurement  plan  is  included  in  Appendix  7.  Planning,  layout,  and  detailed \nengineering design for works in all boroughs have been completed and tender documents have \nbeen prepared for most of the works to be carried out under the proposed supplementary loan.  \nA proposed revised implementation schedule for the Project is included in Appendix 8.   \n \n37.  The  capacity  of  the  executing  agencies  to  implement  the  Project  and  undertake  the \nnecessary procurement  was  reassessed.  Various  measures  have  been  proposed  to  help the \nexecuting  agencies  strengthen  their  capacity,  for  example,  holding  a  dedicated  procurement \nworkshop for the executing agencies with ADB, harmonizing the procurement procedures and \nresources of the KMC and the I&WD, and providing technical assistance (TA) for capacity building \nfor  the  authorities  responsible  for  monitoring  and  managing  ecological  resources.13 These \nmeasures and details of the implementation capacity assessment of the executing agencies are \nincluded in Appendix 2 and paras. 71\u201374. These assessments show that the executing agencies \nwill have adequate resources and capacity. \n \nD.  Rationale for the Proposed Supplementary Loan \n38.  Despite the initial delays and subsequent cancellations of parts of the loan proceeds,  \nproject implementation is now in full swing and there are strong justifications for providing the \nsupplementary loan. The EAs have overcome the steep initial learning curve and are now well \nequipped to complete the project scope. The Government of India is strongly committed, and \nduring the last 18 months, substantial strengthening of project management has been apparent. \nUnder  ADB  financing,  contracts  worth  $120.70  million  have  already  been  awarded  and  the \nremaining  contracts  are  being  finalized  and  tendered.  Disbursements  will  soon  follow.  \nThe request for supplementary financing meets ADB\u2019s criteria under its policy for supplementary \nfinancing14 as demonstrated by the following: \n(i)    The  Project  is  a  priority  for  both  the  GoWB\u2019s  and  the  Government  of  India\u2019s \ndevelopment strategy. The Administrative Report (2001\u20132005) of the Municipal Affairs \nDepartment of the GoWB15 mentions the Project as a priority and further states that \n\"both  the  state  government  and  the  KMC  are  paying  special  attention  to  proper \nimplementation and timely completion of the Project.\"  \n(ii)   The timely provision of funds is critical for maintaining the current momentum and \npositive impacts that are already apparent under the Project. The supplementary loan is \nnecessary to complete the sewerage, drainage, and canal works in an integral manner \nfor the entire catchment area. If the full project scope were not completed, the impacts \nand objectives envisaged for the Project would be seriously undermined, for instance, \nsome facilities currently under construction would be underutilized or redundant.  \n                                                 \n13 A component TA is currently being processed under TA 4814-IND (ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance Cluster for \nProject Processing and Capacity Development.

Kolkata.  \n ", "10   \n(iii)   The continued value-added involvement of ADB in this Project will ensure that the \nunique ecological characteristics of the EKW are maintained through the application of \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and accumulated knowledge. The EKW, which is part \nof the Project, is a Ramsar-protected site that has been selected for its approach to \ntreating the city of Kolkata\u2019s wastewater, whereby it efficiently recovers nutrients from \nthe wastewater and uses the treated water for pisiculture (fish farming) and agriculture. \nThe  significant  demonstration  effect  of  the  Project  in  relation  to  eco-friendly  best \npractices  in  the  urban  sector  can  be  maximized.  An  evaluation  study  of  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) notes that \u201cADB has not maximized its potential for value \naddition to client countries such as India.\u201d This opportunity to realize this potential \nshould not be missed.  \n(iv)   The Project remains technically feasible and economically and financially viable and \ncomplies  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements.  By  rationalizing  and  extending  the \ncoverage  to  a  new  borough,  the  most  congested  and  rapidly  expanding  area  in \nKolkata\u2019s outer periphery, the Project enhances and further strengthens the original \nobjectives  and  extends  the  project  benefits  to  more  than  150,000  additional \nbeneficiaries.  \n(v)   The steps listed in the matrix of due diligence for ADB\u2019s policy on supplementary \nfinancing (footnote 14) have all been observed and all new or revised policies approved \nby  the  Board  since  the  original  appraisal  of  the  Project  have  been  taken  into \nconsideration as required by the policy. \n(vi)   The provision of this supplementary loan will permit ADB to continue to assist the \nGoWB with its governance and anticorruption reforms and will enhance ADB\u2019s long-\nterm relationship with the GoWB. \n(vii)   The financial health of both the KMC and the GoWB is sound as demonstrated by the \nfinancial analysis. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n39.  Social. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the Project is in Appendix 9. \nThe executing agencies prepared an updated resettlement plan (Supplementary Appendix C) in \nline  with  (i) the  Land  Acquisition  Act  (1894,  amended  in  1984),  (ii) the  National  Policy  on \nResettlement  and  Rehabilitation  for  Project  Affected  Families, 16  and  (iii) ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995). A summary of the updated resettlement plan is in Appendix 10. \nThe Project design has carefully incorporated engineering solutions to minimize land acquisition \nand resettlement impacts.17 Changes in project design had the objective of minimizing disruptions \nto the project area population. In the case of canal improvements, which affect the most people of \nall the project components, design changes avoided densely populated canal tracts.18 Component \nsiting and alignment continue to be studied with the objective of further reducing land acquisition \nand resettlement impacts as the Project is implemented. \n \n40.  For the S&D improvement component, the 2.58 hectares required for sewage pumping \nstations is government land.19 STP works will be within existing facilities. The S&D improvement \ncomponent will result in temporary impacts because of the construction of trunk sewer lines. Solid \nwaste management components will be sited on a 60-hectare KMC property. The eventual closure \nof the current landfill site will affect 655 garbage sorters. For the canal improvement component, \n                                                 \n16  Government  of India. 2003. National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation for Project Affected Families. Gazette \nof India, Delhi. \n17 For example, the need for maintaining an engineering right-of-way on either side of the canals have been reconsidered \nin light of the impacts on shopkeepers, and the engineering right-of-way will be maintained on one bank without \ndisturbing shops. \n18 For example, in the case of the Keorapukur canal, works were reduced from 9 km to 1.15 km. In the case of the \nChurial canal, the same objective of avoiding a densely populated settlement was achieved through a slight diversion \nthrough the Churial extension canal that involved an increase in the canal\u2019s length from 24 km to 27.55 km. \n19 Eight drainage pumping stations originally proposed have been dropped from the Project based on the revised project \ndesign. ", "   11    \n77.31 km of canals will be improved. While land acquisition is not required at the canal sites, it will \naffect 3,626 households dwelling along the canals. Government land will be used for relocation \nsites. \n \n41.  The Project\u2019s positive environmental impacts will result in public health benefits and it will \nimprove the quality of life of urban residents. While no significant adverse impacts on vulnerable \ngroups have been identified, the resettlement plan will provide additional entitlements to vulnerable \naffected  persons,  including  indigenous  peoples,  should  they  experience  adverse  resettlement \nimpacts. \n \n42.  Environmental. Environmental screening and an assessment of the Project\u2019s physical \nscope and design changes were carried out, and a revised IEE (Supplementary Appendix D) was \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines  (footnote  6).  The  Project  has  been  recategorized  as  category  B  (sensitive)  for \nenvironment. The summary IEE (Supplementary Appendix E) has been disclosed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s disclosure and public communication policies. \n \n43.  A draft environmental management plan (EMP) has been prepared as part of the revised \nIEE for the management and monitoring of environmental impacts arising from the existing scope \nand design of the Project. The revised IEE and the draft EMP take into consideration the potential \nimpacts, the proposed mitigation measures, and the environmental monitoring program allowing for \nthe most sensitive case scenario (for potential environmental impact purposes), i.e., the sewage \nfrom  concerned  boroughs  being  treated  through  the  fisheries  and  agriculture  in  the  EKW.20  \nA comprehensive environmental study will be undertaken and submitted to ADB for review and \napproval prior to any proposed diversion of sewage into the EKW. \n \n44.  The revised IEE shows that the Project, including works under the proposed supplementary \nloan, will still result in net environmental benefits. The draft EMP, the EKW management plan \ncurrently being prepared with Project support, and the legal framework for the EKW (the EKW \nConservation and Management Act 2006) will further ensure that adequate measures are taken to \nmitigate potential impacts on the EKW and the wider environment. \n \nF.  Revised Cost Estimates \n45.  Revised  costs  for  the  Project,  including  those  to  be  financed  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary loan, are estimated at $401.4 million including taxes and duties, physical and price \ncontingencies, and front-end fees. However, commitment and interest charges have not been \nincluded in line with Government policy to pay interest during construction when it becomes due \nrather than capitalizing it. Table 3 summarizes the revised cost estimates for the Project. Details of \nrevised cost estimates are included in Appendix 11. Appendix 12 presents details of the revised \neconomic analysis. \n \nG.  Revised Financing Plan \n \n46.  The original loan of $250.0 million was allocated from ADB\u2019s OCR. The available loan \namount is now $177.8 million. With an additional $80.0 million proposed under the supplementary \nloan from ADB\u2019s OCR, the total available ADB loan amount will be $257.8 million. The Government \nof India requested that the repayments of the supplementary OCR loan be fully synchronized with \nthe repayments of the original loan.21 Consequently, the supplementary OCR loan will have a term \n                                                 \n20 Authorities have been identified for implementing mitigation measures and monitoring requirements. Responsibilities \nfor reporting and review, cost estimates, and feedback and adjustment have been identified. The PMUs will submit to \nEMP progress reports to ADB on a 6-monthly basis, including monitoring results.  The EMP ensures proper operation \nand maintenance of fisheries facilities to improve water treatment functions and maintain them at a desired level. \n21  This is allowed under the OM Section H5/BP.

The additional investment cost needed to complete the Project is $113.6 million, \nresulting in total investment for the Project of $401.4 million.   \n2.    Cost estimates are in constant 2006 prices.  \n3.   Contingencies for the components under the existing loan are set at the original amount, whereas \ncontingencies for those under the supplementary loan are set at 16%. \n4.  Taxes and duties are computed as 12.24% for service tax, 25% for withholding tax for foreign \nconsultancy. Table 1, original cost estimates, includes taxes and duties in the base cost. \n5.    Financing costs include interest during construction on the original loan paid up to April 2005. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n47.  Under  the  revised  financing  arrangements,  the  two  ADB  loans  will  cover  64.2%  \n($257.8 million) of the total investment costs of $401.4 million. The proposed supplementary loan \nwill cover 70.4% ($80.0 million) of the additional financing requirement of $113.6 million. Of the \ntotal investment costs, the GoWB will finance 18.5% and the KMC will finance 17.3%, which will \ninclude  taxes  and  duties,  land,  a  portion  of  contingencies,  civil  works,  and  incremental \nadministration. ADB\u2019s loan funds will fund part of civil works, equipment, consultancy services and \na portion of contingencies. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 4.  \n \n48.  The Government of India will pass the proposed supplementary loan on to the GoWB as \n70% debt on the same terms and conditions as for the original loan and 30% grant. The GoWB will \nthen onlend the full amount of the loan portion to the KMC on the same terms and conditions as for \nthe original loan, and the grant portion will be passed on to the KMC also as a grant. The existing \nonlending agreement, signed between KMC and GoWB, will be revised, as acceptable to ADB, to \nreflect the changes arising from the proposed supplementary loan. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n22  Repayments will commence on 1 July 2007.

Remedial Steps \n49.  Reliable Costing. To minimize underestimation and/or overestimation errors in the future, \nadequate steps have been taken during cost estimation that include (i) the use of an updated \nschedule of rates (2005) applicable to the KMC and of market rates where applicable, (ii) an \nadequate premium to take into account the gap between the engineers\u2019 estimates and contracted \namounts based on already tendered work packages, (iii) the use of adequate provisions for land \nacquisition and resettlement requirements, and (iv) a requirement for implementation assistance \nduring the revised project period. As the preparation of detailed engineering design and tender \ndocuments  has  already  been  completed  for  most  remaining  contracts  under  the  Project,  the \nvariation that generally arises during the detailed engineering design phase has already been \nminimized. Annual cost updates will be continued and will be monitored by project review missions. \n \n50.  Price Contingencies. Adequate price contingencies have been included to accommodate \nprice escalation. Given the status of remaining works, which are mostly at the tender stage, the \nrisks of time overruns are minimized. Furthermore, adequate provisions have been included in the \ncost estimates to meet unforeseen variations during the contract implementation period. To provide \nrisk  coverage  for  the  uncompleted  and  ongoing  work  packages  under  the  original  loan,  an \nadequate contingency of about 16% is provided under the supplementary loan. \n \n51.  Timely  Implementation.  To  prevent  further  cost  overruns,  minimizing  delays  in \nconstruction activities is essential. For this purpose, the PMUs will continue to update the existing \ncritical  path  method  diagrams  as  part  of  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  and  to \nimplement necessary measures. The implementation periods for ongoing and future packages and \nthe revised Project completion date are reasonable and the capacity of the executing agencies to \nimplement the Project is adequate, hence the risk of time overruns is minimal. \n \nI.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n52.  Implementation arrangements for the proposed supplementary loan will remain the same as \nfor the original loan for the Project. The two PMUs established under each of the executing \nagencies\u2014the I&WD and the KMC\u2013will continue to implement the respective components of the \nProject, i.e., the I&WD PMU will continue to be responsible for implementing canal improvement \nworks, while the KMC PMU will continue to be responsible for implementing all the remaining \nworks, such as S&D improvement works, slum improvements, solid waste management, and \nstakeholder consultation. As the two PMUs share the same premises and supporting consultants, \ncoordination between the two is already good. \n \n ", "14   \n53.  To improve efficiency and streamline project implementation, the KMC will act as the lead \nexecuting agency responsible for overall project planning, budgeting, reporting, and execution and \nthe  primary  point  of  contact  for  ADB  for  the  revised  project  period.  While  the  PMUs  share \nconsultants, such as the design and construction supervision consultant (DSC) and the project \nmanagement  consultant  (PMC),  as  well  as  the  Social  Development  Unit,  the  KMC  PMU  will \ncontinue to manage consultants/ contracts and be accountable for ensuring that all ADB and \nGoWB policies and ADB\u2019s loan covenants for both the original and the supplementary loan are \nadhered to during the revised project implementation period. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n54.  The Project was originally expected to be implemented over 7 years with a completion date \nof 31 December 2007. Given the delays in Project implementation, it is envisaged that the Project \nwill now be completed by 30 June 2010. The proposed supplementary loan will be implemented in \nparallel with the original project activities. The completion date for activities under the proposed \nsupplementary loan is 30 June 2010. A proposed revised implementation schedule is included in \nAppendix  8  and  a  detailed  project  schedule  identifying  critical  paths  and  milestones  for  all \npackages is included in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n3.  Procurement \n55.  Procurement of all goods and services under the proposed supplementary loan will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time \nto time). All civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $10 million or more will be \nprocured  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts \nestimated  to  cost  less  than  $10  million  will  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. Procurement of goods will, to the extent practicable, be grouped into packages larger \nthan $1 million to be suitable for international competitive bidding procedures. Goods that cannot \nbe grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to cost less than $1 million per contract will be \nprocured following national competitive bidding or limited international bidding procedures, and \nmiscellaneous  minor  goods  costing  less  than  $100,000  will  be  purchased  following  shopping \nprocedures. All NCB procurement under the proposed supplementary loan shall be conducted in \naccordance with the procurement procedures agreed for the original Loan Agreement. In 2004, \nbefore commencement of NCB procurement, ADB reviewed the standard bidding documents to be \nused under the Project to ensure consistency with the ADB requirements. Under the proposed \nsupplementary loan, these bidding documents will be reviewed and modified as necessary to \nensure  consistency  with  the  updated  ADB  requirements  before  commencement  of  NCB \nprocurement. All civil works, equipment purchases, and consulting contracts under the proposed \nsupplementary  loan  will  be  separated  from  contracts  under  the  original  loan  for  the  Project.  \nThe procurement plan for the Project (Appendix 7), which also details contracts to be funded under \nthe supplementary loan, will be updated annually by the executing agencies for approval by ADB.  \n \n56.  The  two  PMUs  have  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  (i) advance  contracting  to  recruit \nconsultants and to procure goods and civil works; and (ii) retroactive financing of up to 20% of the \nproposed supplementary loan amount for eligible expenditures, including consultants, goods, and \ncivil works, incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but no earlier than 1 January 2006 or 12 months \nbefore the signing of the Loan Agreement. Advance contracting and retroactive financing are \nnecessary to avoid any disruption and ensure smooth and continuous project implementation.  \nThe two PMUs have been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing does not constitute a commitment to finance the supplementary loan. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n57.  Under the original loan for the Project, an international consulting firm has already been \nengaged as the PMC and a national consulting firm has been engaged as the DSC following \nADB\u2019s  quality-based  selection  procedures.  Additional  consulting  services  under  the  PMC  ", "   15    \n(63 person-months) and the DSC (367 person-months) will be required to implement the Project, \nincluding  works  under  the  proposed  supplementary  loan.  The  proposed  additional  consulting \nservices will be provided by the respective firms currently working as the PMC and DSC, which will \nbe engaged for the additional works under the supplementary loan through single source selection \nprocedures following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from \ntime to time). The executing agencies have found the performance of both firms to be satisfactory, \nand single source selection is considered to be the most appropriate and advantageous method for \nthe selection of the PMC and DSC, because the proposed tasks represent a natural continuation of \ntheir previous work. Each of the firms will be requested to provide a biodata technical proposal for \nthe KMC\u2019s and ADB\u2019s review and for subsequent negotiations. \n \n58.  In addition, a national firm will be engaged as creative consultants to provide consulting \nservices for 30 person-months in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nusing quality- and cost-based selection procedures. As these services will involve public relations, \nincluding extensive consultations with affected families and other stakeholders, local firms are \ndeemed to be appropriate. Furthermore, an adequate number of local firms qualified to perform \nsuch services exists in the market. Outline terms of reference for additional consulting services are \nincluded in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n59.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the KMC and the GoWB. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, \nand transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the executing agencies; the PMUs; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n60.  The GoWB and the KMC are already implementing various anticorruption and governance \nmeasures in the Project, for example, (i) public disclosure of project progress, including physical \nand financial details, via information centers, newspapers, and the Project\u2019s website; (ii) public \naudits of project works by field-level committees in every borough; (iii) public disclosure of the \nresults of all tenders on the Project\u2019s website; (iv) mobilization of third-party \u201cflying squads\u201d to carry \nout random spot checks of quality and safety aspects at work sites; (v) development of a regulatory \nframework for better management of the EKW area; (vi) redress of public grievances through such \nmeans as complaint registers at information centers, an online complaint handling system, and a \nrequirement to respond to complaints within 24 hours of receipt; and (vii) computerization of all \ndata relating to contracts under the Project. The GoWB and the KMC will ensure strict adherence \nto such Project-specific anticorruption measures (Appendix 13).  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n61.  Disbursement of the proposed supplementary loan proceeds will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  detailed \narrangements between ADB and the GoWB. No imprest account has yet been established with the \nReserve Bank of India for the original loan. The KMC may request the opening of a separate \nimprest account for the supplementary loan to ensure timely release of loan proceeds and efficient \nproject  implementation.  The  KMC  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  imprest  account  and \nensuring  timely  release  of  funds.  The  KMC  may  also  establish  a  second-generation  imprest \naccount in a noninterest bearing current account with a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. \nADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures will be followed to replenish and liquidate the imprest \naccount for eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 per payment. The advance to the imprest \naccount and the second-generation imprest account will be limited to projected disbursement for \n ", "16   \nthe next 6 months, or 5% of the loan, whichever is lower. Auditors, satisfactory to ADB, will audit \nthe use of the imprest account and the statement of expenditures procedures. A separate audit \nopinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures will be \nincluded in the annual audit report. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n62.  The PMUs will continue to maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \nfinancing resources received and expenditures made on the Project, including all goods, works, \nand services financed by the supplementary loan proceeds, the KMC, and the GoWB. The project \naccounts  and  related  financial statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound \nauditing standards by auditors acceptable to ADB. The PMUs will submit annual audited reports \nand related financial statements to ADB within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year. The KMC \nwas made aware of ADB\u2019s policy on delayed submission, and also of the importance of satisfactory \nand acceptable quality, of audited reports. The KMC, as the lead executing agency for the Project, \nwill support the I&WD in ensuring that financial audit statements for the Project are submitted \nwithin the agreed time frame.  \n \n63.  The PMUs will prepare quarterly progress reports, in a format acceptable to ADB, with \ninformation on (i) progress made against established targets, including preidentified monitoring \nindicators; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve them; (iii) work \ncarried out by consultants; (iv) updated results of water quality monitoring and action taken on \nproblems  encountered;  (v) changes  in  project  staff;  (vi) compliance  with  loan  covenants; \n(vii) proposed program of activities for the next quarter; and (viii) progress expected during the next \n3 months. The quarterly report will be submitted to ADB by the end of first week of the following \nquarter. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMUs will prepare and submit to \nADB a project completion report on the execution of the Project, including its costs and compliance \nwith the loan covenants. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n64.  The BME process currently being carried out by the executing agencies will include the \nproposed supplementary loan, and the BME for the Project will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s guidelines on the project performance monitoring system. The collection of BME baseline \ndata, including contracts under the proposed supplementary loan, will be completed by the end of \nDecember  2006.  These  data  will  be  used  as  benchmarks  for  monitoring  project  outcomes, \nincluding of the proposed supplementary loan, throughout the Project period. \n \n9.  Project Review \n65.  Because of implementation delays, the midterm review of the Project has not yet been \ncarried out. A comprehensive midterm review will be carried out in December 2007, by which time \nall major contracts should have been awarded and commenced, including contracts financed by \nthe supplementary loan. The midterm review will include a comprehensive review; an evaluation of \nthe  project  outputs  against  the  indicators  set  by  the  BME;  and  a  review  of  implementation \narrangements,  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  of  progress  on  the  Capacity-Building \nProgram. The midterm review will also identify implementation constraints and critical issues,  \nif any, in order to recommend corrective measures and adjustments in the project design for \nspeedy implementation. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n66.  With an increase in the number of beneficiaries by more than 150,000 and in the number of \nproperty connections to sewer lines by 30,200 (original target 90,000, revised target 120,200),  \nthe design, scope, and coverage of most components of the Project have been refined and ", "   17    \nexpanded.  Therefore  the  benefits  and  impacts  anticipated  under  the  Project  not  only  remain \nrelevant, but will be further enhanced. \n \n67.  The Project will improve the urban environment and enhance human capital, which will lead \nto improvements in health and increased productivity, particularly among slum dwellers and the \npoor, especially poor women. In the long run, improved health will contribute to better educational \nstandards and economic growth. The Project will have large benefits for women. As caretakers of \nthe home environment, women are particularly affected by poor living conditions, especially poor \nsanitation conditions, and improved environmental sanitation will enhance their quality of life. Given \nits framework to mitigate environmental and social risks effectively, the Project will help ensure that \nthe ecological characteristics of the EKW are not adversely affected. \n \n68.  Economic  Analysis.  An  economic  analysis  of  the  components  considered  for  the \nproposed  supplementary  loan  was  carried  out,  namely,  the  S&D  improvement  and  canal \nimprovement  component.  The  analysis  reappraised  the  economic  viability  of  the  components \nincorporating design changes, revised cost estimates, and updated information available from the \nsocioeconomic survey. \n \n69.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  S&D  improvement  component  is \nestimated at 12.7% for the full project scope including all seven boroughs and at 11.8% for the two \nboroughs under the supplementary loan. Both these figures are around the economic opportunity \ncost of capital of 12.0%. For the canal improvement component, the EIRR is estimated at 19.2%, \nmuch  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  12.0%.  Combining  both  S&D  and  canal \nimprovement components, the EIRR is estimated at 13.3%. The sensitivity analysis with respect to \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs and assumptions about the beneficiaries demonstrates \nthe robustness of the analysis. Appendix 12 presents details of the revised economic analysis. \n \n70.  The analysis does not include some important benefits that are difficult to quantify at \npresent  or  might  incur  double  counting  under  some  circumstances.  These  benefits  include \n(i) reduced private and public costs of mosquito control, (ii) appreciation of land values because of \nthe  improved  environment  and  the  reduced  risk  of  flooding,  (iii) psychological  benefits  from \nreductions  in  morbidity  and  mortality,  (iv) reduced  disruptions  to  traffic  because  of  flooding, \n(v) benefits to visitors and nonresidents working in the areas, and (vi) positive impacts on tourism \nand tourist-related businesses. If these nonquantified benefits were considered, the EIRR would be \nmuch higher. \n \n71.  Financial Analysis. A financial analysis was carried out to confirm the financial viability of \nthe  components  as  determined  during  the  original  Project  appraisal  using  the  revised  cost \nestimates and paying particular attention to the components considered for funding under the \nproposed  supplementary  loan.  Hence  the  S&D  improvement  component,  the  only  revenue-\ngenerating component, was reappraised to confirm its financial viability. As the KMC has no \nnonrevenue-generating components to maintain and the revenue-generating component may not \nbe self-financing within the sector, the KMC\u2019s overall financial capacity was also assessed. \n \n72.  The  functional  efficiency  of  accounting  practices  in  the  KMC  has  recently  improved \nconsiderably. The preparation of accounts and financial statements on a timely basis and the \ncompletion of the backlog of audits are among the loan covenants that the KMC has complied with. \nIn  addition,  various  reforms  in  accounting  procedures  are  under  way  in  the  KMC  under  the \nCapacity-Building Program funded by the DFID. By 2008, a fully computerized accounting system \nis expected to be in place. Training the KMC\u2019s accounting personnel in the newly computerized \nenvironment is also progressing. This capacity building is expected to improve the KMC\u2019s tax \ncollection efficiency to 80% of the total dues as required under the loan covenants for the original \nProject. \n \n ", "18   \n73.  The KMC\u2019s financial performance for the last 5 years shows that it has achieved a cash \nsurplus in its revenue account since FY2003. From FY2001 to FY2005, revenues generated by the \nKMC have increased from around 66% of the total amount billed to 73%, thereby reducing its \ndependence  on  transfers  from  the  GoWB.  During  the  same  period,  collection efficiencies for \nproperty taxes and commercial and bulk water supply charges improved substantially from 24% \nand 29%, respectively, to 64% and 66%, respectively. However, the proposed reforms to introduce \narea-based property taxes and user charges for water and sewerage are long overdue. Once \nthese are implemented, the KMC\u2019s receipts under the revenue account will improve considerably. \n \n74.  The  S&D  improvement  component  covered  under  the  proposed  supplementary  loan \n(boroughs VII & XV) is estimated to have a financial internal rate of return of 6.6%, which is above \nthe weighted average of cost of capital of 4.9%. Even though the full S&D improvement component \nunder the original loan and the proposed supplementary loan together is estimated to have a \nfinancial internal rate of return of only 1.31%, the S&D improvement component can generate more \nthan enough revenues to cover the incremental O&M costs resulting from the Project. Indeed, the \nincremental revenues from the Project are estimated to cover the full O&M costs as well as 58% of \nthe capital costs resulting from the Project. Given that 30% of the capital costs are provided as a \ngrant, the actual subsidy required for the S&D improvement component is not a substantial burden \nfor the KMC (Supplementary Appendix H: provides details). \n \nB.  Assumptions and Risks \n75.  Risks and assumptions originally identified under the Project were reassessed to establish \ncontinued  and  additional  risks  to  the  Project,  including  those  specific  to  the  proposed \nsupplementary  loan,  and  to  recommend  mitigation  measures.  Key  risks  identified  during  the \noriginal Project appraisal pertained to (i) land acquisition, (ii) user charges, (iii) rationalization of the \nKMC\u2019s staff, (iv) property tax reforms, and (v) state of the GoWB\u2019s public finances. Significant \nprogress on land acquisition for the Project, comprehensive analysis of the GoWB\u2019s and KMC\u2019s \nfinancial soundness, and progress on the Capacity-Building Program for the KMC under the DFID \ngrant provide adequate assurances that risks (i), (iii), and (v) have been minimized for both the \nProject and the supplementary loan. With regard to property tax reforms, the KMC has already \nprepared and ratified the necessary legal documents and forwarded them to the legal assembly of \nthe GoWB, which has provided assurances that a relevant act will be effected by the end of \nFY2007. Furthermore, the original objective of property tax reforms was to strengthen the then \nailing financial standing of the GoWB, which is no longer the case. The loan covenant on the \nintroduction of user charges for domestic water and sewerage consumption is still outstanding.  \nTo minimize this risk, a phased and realistic tariff implementation road map with firm milestones \nhas been agreed with the GoWB and the KMC to achieve the Project\u2019s original objectives. Such a \nroad  map  has  been  reflected  in  additional  covenants  in  the  proposed  loan  agreement  for \nsupplementary financing.  \n \n76.  The risk of delayed implementation, as experienced in the early years of implementation of \nthe  Project,  is  minimal,  as  the  capacity  and  mandate  of  the  PMUs  have  been  significantly \nenhanced in the last 2 years and the PMUs have already completed detailed design, tender \ndocument preparation, and land acquisition for all the remaining major contracts under the Project, \nincluding contracts under the proposed supplementary loan. \n \n77.  Environmental Risks. Risks that may be posed by the possible disposal of sewage from \nBorough VII, part of Borough XI, and Borough XII into the DWF channel will be mitigated by the \nimplementation of adequate mitigation measures and regular monitoring as outlined in the revised \nIEE. \n \n78.  Financial Viability. The financial viability of such revenue-generating components as the \nS&D improvements depends on the proposed user fee structure for the forecast period from 2010 \n(the revised project completion date). It is assumed that by FY2011, the implementation of all S&D ", "   19    \nimprovement works will have been completed and that property tax and water and sewerage tariff \nreforms will have been introduced. Revenue collection from these charges will determine cost \nrecovery for the S&D improvement component. In the absence of compliance in relation to these \nreforms, the financial viability of the Project will be compromised. However, the sound cash flow \nsituation projected for the KMC could support the Project even if this component were not being \nfinancially sustainable on a stand-alone basis. \n \n79.  Economic Growth and Political Stability. The success of the Project in achieving its \nimpacts assumes stability in the economic and political environments of both the Government of \nIndia and the GoWB. As both governments show ample signs of stability, the risks to the Project \nare minimal. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n80.  In addition to the assurances set forth in the amended and restated Loan Agreement dated \n24  July  2002  and  the  Project  Agreement  dated  18  December  2001,  both  for  the  Calcutta \nEnvironmental Improvement Project, the Government of India and the GoWB have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  The GoWB and the KMC will ensure that the project director of the KMC PMU continues to \nbe a special secretary, that the project director of the I&WD PMU continues to be a chief \nengineer, and that both PMUs continue to have qualified and experienced project staff for \nthe revised duration of the Project. \n(ii)  The GoWB and the KMC will ensure that BME of the Capacity-Building Program funded by \nthe DFID, is carried out.

Introduction \n \n1.  The executing agencies for the Kolkata Environmental Improvement Project are the Kolkata \nMunicipal Corporation (KMC) and the Irrigation and Waterways Department (I&WD). As the project \nmanagement  units  (PMUs)  established  for  each  of  the  executing  agencies  share  the  same \npremises and supporting consultants, coordination between the two is good. The I&WD PMU is \nresponsible for implementing canal works, while the KMC PMU is responsible for implementing all \nother activities under the Project, such as the sewerage and drainage, slum improvement, and \nsolid waste management works and the community consultation program. \n \n2.  The PMUs are assisted by the design and construction supervision consultant (DSC),  \nthe project management consultant (PMC), nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and individual \nsocial development and creative consultants. While both PMUs share these consultants, the KMC \nPMU manages their contracts and is accountable for ensuring that all Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and Government of West Bengal (GoWB) policies and ADB loan covenants are adhered to \nduring  project  implementation.  Furthermore,  the  KMC  PMU  acts  as  the  lead  PMU  and  is \nresponsible for overall project planning, budgeting, execution, and implementation and is ADB\u2019s \nprimary point of contact for the Project.  \n \nB.  Assessment of Implementation and Procurement Capacity \n \n3.  In  2004\u20132005,  the  KMC  and  GoWB  undertook  a  major  initiative  to  reorganize  and \nstrengthen the PMUs to speed-up project implementation, which had been slow. This resulted in \nthe following:  \n(i)  Upgrading of the post of project director from the rank of joint commissioner to that \nof commissioner of the KMC, with the posting of a senior Indian administrative \nservice  officer  as  project  director  in  February  2005,  thereby  strengthening  the \nproject director\u2019s decision-making capacity and autonomy.  \n(ii)  Setting up of a Contracts Management Unit within the KMC PMU headed by a chief \nengineer deputed from the KMC. The other members of the Contracts Management \nUnit include two deputy chief engineers, six executive engineers, and 12 assistant \nengineers. \n(iii)  Establishment of a new unit, the Social Development Unit (SDU). The SDU consists \nof  social  sector  staff  seconded  to  the  PMUs  from  the  KMC  and  experts  and \nconsultants engaged from the market. The SDU engages NGOs to carry out field-\nlevel activities. The SDU currently has 4 KMC staff and 7 consultants assisted by  \n10  NGOs  and  3  community  mobilizers.  The  PMUs  have  also  engaged  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation consultants, who are supervised by the SDU. Planning, \nmonitoring, and evaluation of the stakeholder consultation process, resettlement \nactivities,  and  other  social  sector  initiatives  of  the  Project  are  specific  SDU \nresponsibilities. Creative consultants have been engaged to provide design and \noperational support to the Project\u2019s communication and public relations activities. \nThe allocation of person-months for the DSC and PMC has been revised to suit the \nProject\u2019s current needs.  \n(iv)  Establishment of a Project Accounts Unit (PAU), headed by a senior state audit \naccounts officer, which consists of a mix of finance and accounts officers seconded \nto the KMC PMU from the KMC and chartered accountants hired from the market. \nThe Project\u2019s accounting system has been fully computerized and is operational.  \n(v)  Establishment of a separate Project Coordination Unit in the KMC PMU under a \nsenior  administrative  officer  from  the  GoWB\u2019s  civil  service.  Special  officers  are \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nrecruited for this unit to look after land acquisition matters, environmental issues, \nand all interdepartmental coordination issues arising during the implementation of \nthe Project.  \n \n4.  These  structural  changes  were  coupled  with  PMU  empowerment  and  autonomy.  \nThe financial and decision-making powers of the project director are now equivalent to those of the \nKMC\u2019s commissioner. Similarly, the PMUs\u2019 accounting system is now independent, and payments \nand disbursements are being processed and made from the PMUs rather than the KMC, which \nwas the practice prior to 2005.  \n \n5.  The Project Steering Committee has been reconstituted with the minister of municipal \naffairs as chair and the project director (in place of the KMC\u2019s commissioner) as the convenor.  \nA Project Review Committee has been set up under the mayor of Kolkata to undertake monthly \nreviews of the Project. A Coordination Committee under the secretary of municipal affairs is in \nplace that includes representatives of all GoWB departments and utility providers connected with \nthe Project.  \n \n6.  The I&WD project director is a chief engineer seconded from the GoWB to the Project. \nAlthough, unlike the KMC PMU, I&WD PMU has not undergone major changes in its organizational \nsetup, it was sufficiently strengthened during 2005\u20132006 to enable it to implement and monitor the \ncanal rehabilitation works. In addition to the project director, the I&WD PMU has two project \nmanagers who are superintending engineers, six executive engineers, four assistant engineers, \nand one subassistant engineer. \n \n7.  The PMUs handle procurement following ADB norms with assistance from the DSC and \nPMC.  The  KMC  PMU\u2019s  Technical  and  Finance  Committee  consists  of  team  leaders  of  the \nContracts Management Unit, Project Accounts Unit, the DSC, and the PMC. It is headed by the \nproject  director.  Relevant  KMC  officials  and/or  engineers  are  invited  to  the  meetings  of  this \ncommittee  as  and  when  required.  The  committee  is  responsible  for  all  procurement  matters, \nincluding the evaluation and recommendation of tenders and bids. Similarly, the I&WD PMU has a \nProject Implementation Committee consisting of the I&WD project director, the project manager, \nthe DSC team leader, and the PMC team leader. It performs the same functions as the KMC\u2019s \nTechnical and Finance Committee.  \n \n8.  The PMUs have also created a technical subcommittee to oversee the technical aspects of \nvarious work packages that consists of team leaders and deputy team leaders of the Contracts \nManagement Unit, the DSC, and the PMC. This subcommittee meets on a fixed day each week. \nKey PMU officials attend procurement training programs and workshops held in India or abroad on \na regular basis, including those organized by ADB. For consistency and harmonization, during the \nAppraisal Mission for the Project it was agreed that the team leader of the PAU of KMC be made a \npermanent member of the Procurement Committee of the I&WD PMU. For further strengthening of \nthe two PMUs\u2019 procurement skills, it was proposed by ADB that, with ADB support, a dedicated \nprocurement workshop be organized by the end of 2006. Furthermore, the KMC, as the lead \nexecuting agency for the Project, will ensure that all necessary steps are carried out in a timely \nmanner, such as (a) providing training to the I&WD, (b) engaging consultants and auditors as \nrequired, (c) seconding personnel to the I&WD as applicable, and (d) assisting I&WD in submitting \nall required reports and information to ADB. \n \nC.  Assessment of Financial Capacity \n \n9.  The  functional  efficiency  of  the  KMC\u2019s  accounting  practices  has  recently  improved \nconsiderably. The preparation of accounts and financial statements on a timely basis and the \ncompletion of backlogged audits are among the loan covenants that the KMC has complied with. \nAlso various accounting procedures reforms  are under way in the KMC under the Capacity-\n ", "Appendix 2  25\n \nBuilding Program funded by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom. \nBy 2008, a completely computerized accounting system is expected to be in place. Training of \nKMC  accounting  personnel  in  the  newly  computerized  environment  is  also  progressing.  \nThis  capacity  building  among  KMC  accounting  staff  is  expected  to  improve  the  KMC\u2019s  tax \ncollection efficiency to 80% as required under ADB\u2019s loan covenants for the Project. \n \n10.  The KMC\u2019s financial performance for the last 5 years shows that it has achieved a cash \nsurplus. From fiscal year (FY) 2001 to FY2005, revenues generated by the KMC increased from \naround 66% of total receipts to 73%, an average annual growth rate of 10%. The other major \nsource of recurrent revenues is annual transfers from the GoWB to the KMC. In FY2001, total \ntransfers from the GoWB to the KMC represented 34% of the KMC\u2019s receipts. This figure declined \nto 27% in FY2005, demonstrating a decline in the KMC\u2019s dependence on the state. Nevertheless, \nthe proposed reforms to introduce area-based property taxes and user charges for water and \nsewerage are long overdue. Once these have been implemented, the KMC\u2019s revenues will improve \nconsiderably. Further details of the assessment of the KMC\u2019s and GoWB\u2019s financial capacity are \nincluded in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n11.  Thus with the support of consultants and by means of the internal arrangements for dealing \nwith  various  aspects  of  the  Project,  the  two  executing  agencies  have  adequate  capacity  to \nimplement the Project. \n \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \nIMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS SUMMARY1 \n \nA.  Part A: Stakeholder Consultation Process \n \n1.  The  stakeholder  consultation  process  is  being  implemented  smoothly.  Implementation \narrangements for this component were slightly rearranged in 2005 to improve the efficiency of \nimplementation.  While  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  community-based  organizations, \nand field-level coordinators continue to be responsible for field-level implementation, a Social \nDevelopment Unit (SDU) has been created, consisting of Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) \nofficials and consultants and shared by both the project management units (PMUs), to manage and \ncoordinate overall implementation of part A, the stakeholder consultation process; part D, slum \nimprovements; benefit monitoring and evaluation, and social interventions across all components \nof the Project. With the assistance of NGOs and consultants, extensive consultations on various \nsocial development issues have been carried out with affected families and other stakeholders.  \n \n2.  The community development plan has been finalized and linked to government schemes for \nthe urban poor. Four NGOs have been engaged to help implement the community development \nplan, and the Project has moved forward with a number of schemes designed to extend short-term \nand long-term benefits to the urban poor, including vocational training, insurance schemes, and \nhealth and hygiene awareness programs. Self-help groups are also being established. The Project \nis coordinating with several GoWB agencies to ensure that these schemes dovetail with theirs. \nExamples of good practice include promoting house connections to sewer lines through door-to-\ndoor  campaigns,  holding  frequent public  meetings,  distributing  information  leaflets  to  citizens, \nestablishing ward-level coordination committees, and setting up information centers in project \nareas and public complaints registers at the contractors\u2019 site offices. These measures are helping \nto generate wide public support for the Project. \n \nB.  Part B: Sewerage and Drainage Improvements \n \n3.  Sewerage and drainage (S&D) improvements suffered from serious start-up delays and \ncontract awards and physical works have only commenced in the last 18 months. However, \ndetailed  design  and  tender  document  preparation  for  all remaining  contracts  have  now  been \ncompleted. Works under six contracts are in progress and major civil works contracts for two \nboroughs are being tendered. All contracts under the S&D works will be awarded by March 2007 \nand all works will be completed by mid-2010. The KMC PMU is exploring measures to expedite the \nS&D works to make up for lost time. As part of such efforts, the KMC PMU organized a workshop \nfor contractors in May 2006 to seek feedback and identify potential constraints and opportunities. \nThe participants\u2019 recommendations, such as introducing a bonus clause in remaining contracts, are \nbeing incorporated in the Project\u2019s implementation and contract documentation. \n \n4.  S&D works in the project boroughs have been grouped under six works packages. While \nworks under four packages are in progress, bid documents for works packages in Borough XV has \nbeen sent to ADB for approval, and detailed design for works package in Borough VII is complete \nand tender documents are being prepared. In addition, pilot works are being implemented in one \nward of each of the boroughs, of which four packages have been completed and works for the rest \nare in progress. Because of the delayed start-up, however, physical progress for S&D works has \nonly just started, with only 52 kilometers of S&D pipes of the total 424 kilometers under the Project \ncompleted to date.   \n \n5.  S&D Pumping Stations. Pumping stations under the Project are divided into six works \npackages. Technical evaluation of works package for construction of pumping stations in boroughs \nXII, XIII, and XIV is in progress, and works package for augmentation of the existing pumping \nstations in boroughs I, XI, XIII, XIV, and XV has been tendered. While works package for pumping \n                                                 \n1  As of 10 November 2006. \n ", "Appendix 3  27\n \n \nstations in boroughs I and XV is being tendered, tender documents for, works package for pumping \nstations for Borough VII and Borough XV are being prepared. \n \n6.  Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs). Based on the satisfactory outcome of a detailed impact \nstudy, an alternative proposal for treating sewage effluent from boroughs VII and XII and parts of \nBorough XI may be adopted and the construction of two new STPs may be dropped from the \nProject. Therefore the detailed design of the two STPs has been put on hold. The remaining works \ninclude augmenting three STPs, of which financial evaluation of works package for augmentation \nof the South Suburban East STP is in progress; and tender documents for works package for \naugmentation of the Bangur STP and works package for augmentation of the Garden Reach STP \nare being prepared. Tenders for these two packages will be invited in December 2006.  \n \n7.  Lake  Rehabilitation  Works.  Rehabilitation works  for  identified  small  parks  and  water \nbodies have been divided into two works packages. While rehabilitation works under the larger \nworks package have been completed, contract documentation for the remaining works package is \nbeing finalized, with contract award expected in March 2007.  \n \n8.  Procurement of Equipment. Smaller equipment (1 suction machine, 2 jetting machines, \netc.) has already been procured. The purchase of water meters will start in January 2007.  \n \nC.  Part C: Solid Waste Management \n \n9.  Detailed design of the sanitary landfill is in its final stages. A noteworthy development is that \nthe Project has engaged consultants to package transfer and disposal responsibilities for the city\u2019s \nsolid waste management under a public-private partnership modality. The consultants will conduct \nthe necessary viability assessments and options analysis and will prepare contract documents \nunder  an  appropriate  public-private  partnership  modality  for  the  construction,  operation,  and \nfinancing of a solid waste management and disposal system for Kolkata, including the construction \nand operation of the sanitary landfill. In the long run, the KMC is also considering involving the \nprivate sector in primary collection of solid waste, which will reduce and rationalize the massive \nworkforce currently engaged in the sector. Subsequent to the adoption of the findings of the \nconsultants\u2019 assessments, the tender process for the new sanitary landfill is expected to start in \nJune 2007. \n \n10.  Procurement of equipment and vehicles for collection efficiency improvement is almost \ncomplete. This subcomponent consists of 10 packages, out of which five packages have been \ncompleted: procurement of mechanical sweepers, bulldozers, vehicles with containers and pay \nloaders.  While  contracts  for  the  purchase  of  other  collection  equipment  has  been  awarded, \ncontract for the procurement of collection bins, push carts, etc. is expected to be awarded in March \n2007.   \n \nD.  Part D: Slum Improvement Works \n \n11.  Slum improvements are progressing well. Works have started in all slum areas identified \nunder the Project. Field-level committees have been formed in all slums and meet at least once \nevery month. Four\u2013hundred-and-fifty user groups have already been formed for the operation and \nmaintenance of assets in 14 slums. Similarly, 15 self-help groups have been formed and financing \nsupport for the self-help groups has been established. Noteworthy good practices include the \nintegration of slum improvement activities under the Project with the KMC\u2019s poverty alleviation \nprograms, resulting in long-term social security benefits for slum dwellers, such as insurance \nschemes. Most of the civil works under the slum improvement component have already been \nimplemented or are under implementation. \n \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \n12.  Slum improvement works are being executed through 15 works packages. Works under the \nfirst six packages have been completed. While works four packages are in progress, financial \nevaluation of three packages are in progress, and the remaining packages are currently being \nfinalized for tender. As noted earlier, the community development plan is assisting slum dwellers to \nform self-help groups and to benefit from other long-term Project and Government of West Bengal \ninitiatives.  \n \nE.  Part E: Canal Improvements \n \n13.  Canal improvements are divided into three types of packages: canal rehabilitation, bridge \nconstruction, and construction of canal pumping stations. While contracts for bridge construction \nhave been awarded, implementation of canal rehabilitation and pumping station works has been \nslow,  with  only  one  contract  currently  in  the  implementation  phase.  Most  of  the  remaining \npackages are at the tendering stage, and detailed engineering design of works for the Churial \ncanal is under way. Similar to the S&D works, this component of the Project has gained renewed \nmomentum only in the last 18 months, and since then has been moving ahead speedily. This part \nalso involves the resettlement of 3,626 families, which is being undertaken as agreed in the original \nand revised resettlement plans. \n \n14.  Canal  Rehabilitation.  Works  under  this  subcomponent  are  being  implemented  under  \n11  work  packages.  Works  package  for  rehabilitation  of  downstream  of  the  Tollygunge-\nPanchannagram  canal  has  been  awarded.  Financial  evaluation  of  the  following  packages: \nrehabilitation of the rest of the Tollygunge-Panchannagram canal and Monikhali canal (upstream \nand branch canals) have been completed. Detailed design and tender document preparation are \nunderway for the remaining works packages.  \n \n15.  Construction  of  Canal  Pumping  Stations.  Three  canal  pumping  stations  will  be \nconstructed under a single package at Keorapukur, Monikhali, and Chowbaga under a single \npackage, financial evaluation of which has been completed. A pumping station at Ghushighata will \nbe constructed under a separate package that is currently being designed. \n \n16.  Construction of Bridges. The construction of 53 bridges over canals is included under two \nworks packages. Work under the first package, comprising 23 bridges, is in progress and is \nexpected  to  be  completed  in  December  2006.  Work  under  the  second  package,  comprising  \n30 bridges, has recently started.  \n \n17.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Canal Bank Dwellers. Of the 3,626 affected families, \n229  families  have  already  been  relocated  in  apartments  being  constructed  by  the  Kolkata \nMunicipal Metropolitan Development Authority under the Valmiki Ambedkar Shahari Aawas Yojna2  \nSimilarly, 352 families will be relocated to these apartments in March 2007. All these families are \ndisplaced by canal works in the Tollygunge-Panchannagram basin. In addition, the Project is \nexpected to construct 1,417 apartments in phases at Nonadanga by November 2007. Another  \n510 apartments will be constructed in Kasba by June 2007 and 57 more apartments will be \nconstructed  in  Purba  Putiary,  Purba  Barsiha,  and  Sampa  Mirzanagar  by  November  2007  for \nrelocating families affected by other canal works. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  Valmiki Ambedkar Shahari Aawas Yojna (VAMBAY) is a scheme of the Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty \nAlleviation of the Government of India. This scheme, launched in December 2001, provides grant subsidy for \nconstruction and rehabilitation of the dwelling units for the slum dwellers and the population living below the poverty \nline. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  29\n \n \nF.  Part F: Implementation Assistance and Capacity Building \n \n18.  Consulting services by the project management consultant and design and construction \nsupervision  consultant  are  ongoing.  In  parallel,  the  Capacity-Building  Program  funded  by  the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom is being implemented by a \nseparate KMC department. Coordination between the PMUs and the KMC\u2019s Capacity-Building \nProgram team needs immediate strengthening. Baseline data collection for benefit monitoring and \nevaluation of the Capacity-Building Program has started. The Capacity-Building Program is being \nimplemented under the following subcomponents (each being carried out by a consulting firm \nengaged  through  a  competitive  bidding  process):  (i)  organizational  development;  \n(ii) computerization; (iii) public relations and communication; (iv) geographic information system;  \n(v) program management, including implementation, change management and governance, social \ninclusion, and urban planning; and (vi) resource mobilization.

As this arrangement was found to be ineffective, the SDU was set up within the Kolkata Municipal  p\ne\nsupervision rearranged  Corporation (KMC) Project Management Unit to oversee the stakeholder consultation process. Implementation (field- n\nd\nlevel  activities)  is  still  being  carried  out  by  nongovernment  organizations,  community-based  organizations,  and  ix\nconsultants.

During \ndetailed design, comprehensive hydraulic modeling was carried out by the design and construction supervision \nconsultants, based on which the requirements for pumping stations were adjusted accordingly. For instance, the \nexisting pumping station at Beerpara was found to be adequate to handle the flow, and hence the proposal for an \nadditional pumping station was dropped. Similarly, flow generated from an area in Ward 5 could not be diverted directly \nto the Circular Canal because of the area\u2019s physical constraints, thus a new pumping station with a capacity of 610 lps \nwas designed within the existing pumping stations premises.  \nBorough XI          \nAugmentation of pumping  0  6  Hydraulic modeling showed that all six existing pumping stations had to be augmented to cope with the calculated DWF \nstations  discharge from the area. All DWF is designed to reach the pumping station LS-5, from where it will be pumped to the \nKeorapukur MPS to be pumped to the South Suburban (East) STP.  \nBorough XII          \nNew pumping stations  0  4  The number, size, and location of these pumping stations were determined from the conclusions of the hydraulic \nmodeling carried out during the detailed engineering design phase. \nSTP  2 (total  2 (total  The capacity of the two STPs proposed will need to be increased to 150 MLD because of the inclusion of S&D works in \ncapacity  capacity 150  Borough VII.

However, during detailed design it became evident that all \nfour existing pumping stations (LS-1, LS-2, LS-3, and the Keorapukur MPS) needed augmentation in order to pump the \nDWF to the South Suburban (East) STP as originally envisaged.  \n ", " \nDetails  Original   Revised  Description \nNew pumping stations  4  1  Four new SWF pumping stations were considered in the original Project design. However, after detailed engineering \ndesign (and the fact that the S&D system being built was now a combined one), it was found that one additional \npumping stations at Canal Road would be sufficient to handle the DWF from the area. The remaining SWF will be \ndischarged by gravity.  \nBorough XIV          \nAugmentation of pumping  2  1  The flow to the existing Jinjira Bazar pumping station (capacity 558 lps) was overestimated during the original project \nstations  design. During detailed design and hydraulic modeling, the design flow to this pumping station was estimated to be 344 \nlps, which is well below the capacity of the pumping station. Hence, augmentation of this pumping station was dropped \nfrom the Project.  \nNew pumping stations  1  3  The original Project design had considered only one new SWF pumping station near the Parnasree canal. During \ndetailed design, it was found that the SWF can be achieved by gravity at this location. Furthermore, during detailed \nhydraulic modeling and design, it was found that to achieve optimal utilization of existing canals and effective utilization \nof the existing DWF network, three more DWF pumping stations were required: (i) at the Diamond Harbour Road canal \n(capacity 178 lps); (ii) adjacent to the Begore Branch canal (capacity 305 lps); and (iii) at the Behala Flying Club \n(capacity 545 lps).  \nBorough XV          \nNew pumping stations  3  2  Of the three new pumping stations proposed for Borough XV, the Karbala pumping station for DWF and the Monikhali \npumping station 1 have been eliminated, as it was found possible during the detailed design phase to divert DWF to \nexisting systems and/or canals by gravity. Due to the lack of land, the location of the Monikhali pumping station 2 was \nshifted to Mudiali for the disposal of SWF to the Monikhali canal. Similarly, detailed design of S&D works in Borough XV \nestablished the need for constructing another pumping station within the existing Santoshpur pumping station premises \nto augment pumping capacity at that location from 464 lps to 1,108 lps.  \nBorough VII          \nS&D network, pumping  Borough  36.3 km of   Savings from the elimination of the biomedical and hazardous waste subcomponent were reallocated to allow additional \nstations and   not  S&D  S&D works in various wards of Borough VII. Borough VII was selected as it is the most congested, populous, and \npumping main  covered  network,  rapidly expanding area in the periphery of Kolkata and is currently discharging its sewage into canals, thereby creating a \naugmentation  significant environmental hazard. Its inclusion in the Project was considered a necessary step, because it would not only \nof 7 pumping  benefit the largest number of beneficiaries, thereby giving the largest return on investment, but it would also result in the \nstations, 3  largest corresponding improvement in environmental sanitation in Kolkata.

There \nPanchannagram basin   are no significant deviations from other slum improvement works. As already noted, the SDU is now responsible for \nde-siltation   oversight of this part of the works. \nPart E: Canal Improvement Works \nIncrement in the canal de-     After the cancellation of significant funds from the original loan, the KMC attempted to reshuffle and stretch the available \nsiltation and lining works,  funds by cutting some of the physical scope under the canal components (even though the project preparatory technical \nand number of bridges  assistance and the original Project appraisal had appraised them). For instance, de-silting and lining of significant \nlengths of the Churial canal and other canals were dropped. As these subcomponents form an integral part of the larger \ncatchment area, the lack of improvements or their removal from the Project would undermine the impacts and objectives \nenvisaged for the Project. Furthermore, detailed design showed that if the complete canal improvement works were not \ncarried out, the effects of the S&D system would not be fully realized. Therefore these subcomponents will be \nimplemented under the proposed supplementary loan. The modifications are based on outputs and recommendations \nfrom the hydraulic modeling and the current scope of S&D works. The basic objectives are to provide relief from \nrecurrent waterlogging and flooding problems upstream of the Tollygunge-Panchannagram basin. In some cases, the \ncanal lining length has been reduced. The largest increment has been in the number of bridges (from 30 to 53). These \nwere considered necessary, pursuant to detailed design and hydraulic modeling, to avoid flow obstructions in the canal \nand to provide reasonable connectivity in the area. Furthermore, a pumping station at Gaushighata, instead of at the \nChurial canal as in the original design, was found to be more effective for the functioning of the SWF channel and for \nminimizing flooding risks, based on detailed hydraulic modeling and design.  \nDWF = dry weather flow, KMC = Kolkata Municipal Corporation, lps = liters per second,   mld = million liters per day, MPS = main pumping station, S&D = sewerage and drainage, \nSDU = Social Development Unit, STP = sewage treatment plant, SWF = storm water flow.  \na  Even though the project preparatory technical assistance had designed separate S&D networks under the original Project, it was later negotiated and included in the Loan \nAgreement that combined sewers would be built in keeping with the city\u2019s existing (combined) system and separate storm water drains would be built where feasible. However, \nduring detailed design it was found that most of the lanes and by-lanes in the Project areas are narrow and already contain underground utility cables, therefore laying a separate \nsystem was not deemed feasible. This has resulted in changes in the length of the sewer network, pumping mains, and associated infrastructure; however, overall coverage and \nhousehold connections have increased as shown here. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "Appendix 7  39\nPROCUREMENT PLAN \n \nTable A7.1 Project Information \nCountry  India \nName of Borrower  India  \nProject Name  Kolkata Environmental Improvement Project \nLoan or TA Reference  Loan 1813-IND and TBD (for the proposed \nsupplementary loan) \nDate of Effectiveness  16 April 2002 (original loan), TBD (for the proposed \nsupplementary loan) \nAmount US$  $257.1 million \nOf which Committed, US$  $177.8 million \nExecuting Agency  Kolkata Municipal Corporation and Irrigation and \nWaterways Department \nApproval Date of Original Procurement Plan  Not applicable \nApproval of most recent Procurement Plan  Not applicable \nPublication for Local Advertisements  The Telegraph and Anandabazar Patrika \nPeriod Covered by this Plan  2000\u20132010 \nTA = technical assistance, TBD = To be decided. \n \n \nTable A7.2: Procurement Thresholds, Goods and Related Services,  \nWorks and Supply and Installa \nProcurement Method  Amount \nInternational Competitive Bidding (ICB) Works  $10,000,000 and above  \nICB Goods  $1,000,000 and above \nNational Competitive Bidding (NCB) Worksb  Less than $10,000,000 \nNCB Goods  Less than $1,000,000 \nLimited International Bidding (LIB)  Less than $1,000,000 \nShopping Works  Less than $100,000 \nShopping Goods  Less than $100,000 \na  These thresholds apply only to the proposed supplementary loan. \nb  The standard bidding documents to be used under the Project will be reviewed and modified as necessary to ensure \nconsistency with the updated Asian Development Bank requirements before commencement of National Competitive \nBidding procurement. \n \nTable A7.3: Procurement Thresholds, Consultants Servicesa \nProcurement Method   Amount \nConsultants qualifications selection   Less than $200,000 \nSingle source selection may be used to engage the existing  Less than $100,000 \nproject management consultants, the design and construction \nsupervision consultants for the execution and/or continuation of \nservices under the supplementary loan. \na  These thresholds apply only to the proposed supplementary loan. \n \n \n ", " \n \n  4\n0\nTable A7.4: List of Contract Packages in Excess of $100,000, Goods, Works and Consulting Servicesa   \n \n \n \nContract  Estimated Cost  Procurement  Expected Date of  Prior Review    \nContract Description Comments Loan Source   \nNo. ($ million) Method Advertisement Y/N A\np\nSewerage and Drainage Improvement pe\nn\nSDA1 Construction of S&D Network for Borough XI -

The Kolkata municipal \narea has a high population density, and between 1950 and 1970 grew by about 20\u201330% each decade, with much of \nthe growth occurring over short periods because of geopolitical events or natural disasters. However, since the 1970s, \nthe rate of population growth has declined considerably. Between 1971 and 1981, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation \n(KMC) recorded an annual growth rate of less than 0.5%, and between 1981 and 1991 the total growth for the decade \nwas a little over 6%. The 1991 census recorded a population for the Kolkata municipal area of 4.38 million, with a \nheavy concentration in the inner wards, which are thought to have population densities of up to four times what an \nurban area can support on a sustainable basis. Thus people in these areas are likely to move to the outer areas, with a \nconsequent readjustment of population densities. The outer areas, which comprise the project area for most of the \ncomponents, currently have a total population of around 1.40 million, with densities ranging from 7,000 to 29,000 \npeople per square kilometer. Based on land use maps and recent growth trends, the population in the outer areas is \nexpected to grow to around 1.47 million by 2011 and 1.52 million by 2021. \n \nAround 50% of the project area population live in slum housing or worse.1 A slum dwelling is typically a single-roomed, \nsingle-story dwelling constructed of nonpermanent building materials. About 700,000 people live in such houses. \nAbout 26\u201330% of the slum-dwelling households in the project area live below the poverty line, that is, about \n180,000\u2013210,000 people or 13\u201315% of the project area population.2 Low-income or slum settlements comprise \nregistered  bustees  (29%  of  the  project  area  population),3 refugee  colonies  (11%),  unregistered  settlements \n(unregistered bustees and canal bank settlements) (10%), and pavement dwellers. The KMC Act (1980) and the \nThika Tenancy Act aim to mainstream the poor into society by providing them with security of tenure and basic \nservices.  Under  a  series  of  refugee  rehabilitation  schemes,  the  Government  of  West  Bengal  is  progressively \nrecognizing refugee colonies by providing them with land titles and basic amenities. The KMC does not recognize \nunregistered settlements and pavement dwellers, who are therefore not entitled to any security of tenure or basic \nservices.  \nIn the project area, only 17% of residents have a sewerage connection, fewer than 50% are covered by a drainage \nsystem, and 70% are served by solid waste collection. While infrastructure deficiencies affect all segment of society, \nthey particularly affect the urban poor, more than 90% of whom must share toilet facilities. Drainage systems are aging \nand inadequate, which gives rise to frequent flooding and environmental contamination of low-lying residential areas. \nIndustrial wastes flow, largely untreated, into the surrounding environment, exposing the community to acids, toxic \nchemicals, paints and varnishes, and other highly toxic compounds. Smoke from the burning of dung, wood, coal, and \nkerosene inside slum dwellings predisposes occupants, especially young children and women, to acute respiratory \ninfections. Some 77% of respondents to a socio-economic survey conducted during project preparation reported \nhaving no separate and dedicated cooking area. Degradation of the environment is leading to increasing concern \nabout morbidity and mortality rates. Although the KMC\u2019s database on public health is limited, it shows that mortality \nrates due to acute respiratory infections and diarrhea account for around 29% of all infant deaths. The population \ndensity typical of slum settlements remains a major public health concern with regard to the transmission of \ncommunicable diseases, especially tuberculosis. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Proposed Classification: Targeted Intervention \n \nAn estimated 200,000 people live below the poverty line in the project area. The stakeholder consultation process and \nthe Capacity-Building Program will have a direct impact on poor groups through the development of mechanisms and \napproaches to the design and operation of projects that will specifically make provisions for the underprivileged. In \n                                                 \n1  For classification purposes, the term slum refers to low-income settlements with a high population density that lack \n  adequate public services and amenities. \n2  The poverty line is defined as the income necessary to buy food to meet a daily intake of 2,400 calories of energy in \n  rural areas or 2,100 calories in urban areas and certain basic nonfood items, such as clothing and transportation.  \n3  A bustee is a settlement of primarily low-income people. \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \naddition, the stakeholder consultation process will empower communities, enabling them to participate more actively \nand constructively in all civic matters. Up to 5 million people will benefit from the Project, of which some 50% reside in \nslum settlements. Under the Capacity-Building Program, skills will be developed in the KMC, in nongovernmental \norganizations (NGOs), and in community-based organizations to ensure effective program delivery, and systems \nwill be institutionalized under the Project. The Program will also empower civil society in general. Extending access to \nthe sewerage system and ensuring better solid waste management for the poor will enhance their health.  \nThe project interventions in the slum communities will address poverty in two ways. First, the slum communities will \nhave greater access to basic facilities, such as water supply and sanitation. Second, the standard of shelter in the \nslums is expected to improve, as the communities will be offered financial assistance to rehabilitate their homes, \nwhere appropriate. About 190,000 slum dwellers will benefit from direct slum intervention under the Project. A crisis \nmanagement approach will be adopted to address immediate needs for water supply and sanitation in unrecognized \nlow-income settlements. Up to 65,000 slum dwellers will benefit from targeted settlements in Cossipore, Garden \nReach, and Jadavpur. Proposed civil works include (i) providing water standposts (9,350 units), (ii) constructing and/or \nconverting sanitary latrines (4,200 units), (iii) constructing and/or renovating community latrines (910 units), and \n(iv) constructing washing and/or bathing platforms (430 units). Longer-term improvements will include a wide range of \namenities to improve the living conditions of slum dwellers. The same rights and responsibilities that the KMC has \nconveyed to dwellers in registered bustees will accrue to slum dwellers in unrecognized bustees. This will be achieved \nthrough a pilot scheme to establish land titles, register dwellings, recognize tenancy rights, impose rent controls, and \nassess municipal tax liabilities. Security of tenure will enhance tenants\u2019 creditworthiness and improve their access to \nfinancing for physical improvements. A small-scale loan facility of $60,000 will be established to finance the physical \nimprovement of slum dwellings on a pilot basis. Proposed civil works include (i) widening and realigning neighborhood \naccess lanes (1,490 meters); (ii) providing electric lighting to illuminate lanes and open public spaces (40 poles and \nwiring); (iii) widening, realigning, and lining drains (595 meters); (iv) constructing sewer and drainage lines (380 \nmeters); (v) building water supply lines (785 meters); (vi) providing solid waste containers (6 units); and (vii) improving \npublic open spaces (3,182 square meters). An estimated 190,000 people will benefit from improved facilities under this \ncomponent. \n \nThe canal bank dwellers who are relocated under the canal rehabilitation works will have an improved quality of life \nthrough the provisions of the Asian Development Bank-approved resettlement plan. The Government of West Bengal \nand the KMC have recognized this exercise as an opportunity to help the canal bank dwellers improve their standard \nof living. The resettlement plan ensures a minimum standard of housing for relocation and addresses the special \nneeds of vulnerable groups, such as children and female household heads, through specially designed rehabilitation \nprograms. \n  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis:                           Yes     No \n \nThe stakeholder consultation process will promote stakeholders\u2019 involvement in the Project and contribute to effective \nimplementation of the project investments. The process is designed to ensure stakeholder awareness, participation, \nand education with respect to the implementation and management of the project facilities. It will also educate \ncommunities about the link between environmental sanitation and health. The project beneficiaries will be consulted \nabout project operations, as well as the implications for the community in terms of benefits and responsibilities. \nInformation about stakeholders\u2019 needs and expectations under the Project will be conveyed to the project management \nteams. Using existing community networks where possible, stakeholders will be encouraged to become involved in \nproject design, implementation, operation and maintenance, and monitoring. As a cross-cutting component, the \nstakeholder consultation process will underpin the promotion of affordable access by the poor to basic urban services \nin low-income areas and facilitate community empowerment through the development and adoption of demand-led, \nparticipatory approaches across all project components.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy:                                  Yes     No \n \nThe stakeholder consultation process will underpin the Project\u2019s sustainability through improved representation. \nIn addition, the process will empower communities, enabling them to participate more actively and constructively on all \ncivic matters. NGOs will also be mobilized to facilitate consultation, community mobilization, participation in prioritizing \ncommunity requirements, planning and scheduling of civil works, management of the small-scale loan facility, and \nmaintenance. The NGOs will work with community-based organizations and other civil society organizations. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 9  45\nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nAlthough the Project is not specifically targeted at women, all components will help improve their quality of life. \nWomen, as \u201ccaretakers\u201d of the home environment, are affected by poor living conditions, particularly poor sanitation \nstandards. In addition, their exposure to cooking smoke substantially increases the risk of acute respiratory infection. \nImproved environmental sanitation and the replacement of traditional indoor cooking fires will enhance their quality of \nlife. \n \nGender  issues  have  been  carefully  integrated  in  resettlement  planning  and  implementation.  Female-headed \nhouseholds are considered to be vulnerable households and are accorded additional entitlements.4 In addition, legal \ntitles will be in the name of women, and thus the Project will help promote the empowerment of women.5 Among the \nresettlement plan\u2019s actions consistent with gender development are (i) ensuring an adequate gender balance among \nthe staff of the project management units; (ii) addressing gender issues and monitoring them;6 (iii) ensuring that women \nbenefit from poverty alleviation schemes for the urban poor, the formation of women\u2019s self-help groups, and provision \nof vocational training;7  and (iv) empowering women through sensitization, participation, and training.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?

On  19  December  2000,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Calcutta \n(Kolkata) Environment Improvement Project to help the government improve sanitation in the outer \nareas of the Kolkata municipality. The supplementary loan has been proposed to address (i) cost \noverruns, (ii) price escalation, (iii) cost increases caused by physical and design changes, and  \n(iv) cost underestimates. A resettlement plan was prepared for the Project in 2000 and updated in \n2006 based on project design and physical changes, specifically: (i) increase in the length of \ncanals to be improved, (ii) cancellation of sewage treatment plant components and drainage \npumping stations, and (iii) change in the location of the solid waste management facility. \n \nA.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n2.  The  project  design  has  carefully  incorporated  engineering  solutions  to  minimize  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. The objective of changes in the project design was to cause \nthe least disruption to the project area population. In the case of canal improvements, which of all \nthe project components affect the most people, design changes led to the avoidance of densely \npopulated canal tracts.1 Reviews of siting and alignment continue with the objective of reducing \nland acquisition and resettlement impacts as the Project is implemented. \n \n3.  Components B (sewerage and drainage improvements), C (solid waste management), and \nE (canal improvements) require land. For Component B, the 2.58 hectares required for sewage \npumping stations is government land,2 and sewage treatment plant works will take place within \nexisting facilities. Component B will result in temporary impacts because of the construction of \ntrunk sewer lines. For component C, an estimated 60 hectares are required for the solid waste \nmanagement  facility  and  this  land  will  be  Kolkata  Municipal  Corporation  (KMC)  property.  \nThe eventual closure of the current landfill site will affect garbage sorters. For component E,  \n77.31 kilometers of canals will be improved. While land acquisition is not required at the canal \nsites, the component will affect a significant numbers of canal dwellers and government land will \nbe used for relocation sites. Table A10.1 summarizes component E\u2019s resettlement impacts. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n4.  The policy framework and entitlements for the Project are based on (i) the Land Acquisition \nAct (1894, amended in 1984); (ii) the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation for Project \nAffected Families; and (iii) ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). The entitlement matrix \nfor the Project, based on the foregoing, is given in Table A10.2.3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  For example, in the case of the Keorapukur canal, works were reduced from 9 km to 1.15 km. In the case of the \nChurial canal, the same objective of avoiding a densely populated settlement was achieved through a slight diversion \nthrough the Churial extension canal that involved an increase in the canal\u2019s length from 24 km to 27.55 km. \n2  Eight drainage pumping stations originally proposed have been dropped from the Project based on revised project \ndesign. \n3  An assessment of the status and progress of project implementation shows that for components that will require land \nand result in resettlement impacts, progress has been slow. This pace ensures that all affected persons are provided \nwith compensation and assistance based on the updated resettlement plan. \n ", "48  Appendix 10 \nTable A10.1: Summary of Resettlement Impacts Caused by Component E \nItem                     Total \nNumber of Affected Households            3,626 \nNumber of Affected Persons               16,317 \nNumber of Affected Persons without Land Titles              16,317 \nNumber of Female-Headed Households               462 \nNumber of Very Poor Households (incomes less than Rs2,300 per             2,765  \nmonth)    \nNumber of Elderly and/or Disabled Affected Persons               399 \nNumber of Residential Structures Affected            3,177 \nMain Type of Residential Structure                     Kutcha (96%)a \nNumber of Affected Shops               449 \nNumber of Affected Common Property Resources                 18 \nAverage Annual Household Income (Rs)     2,000\u20132,500 \nPrimary Source of Income                  Wages (82%),  \n self-employment (18%) \nAverage Household Size (number of people)                   6                       \na Kutcha  are dwellings that typically have bamboo mat or mud walls with roof tiles and mud floors. \nSource: Kolkata Municipal Corporation. 2006.

Information Dissemination, Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n5.  The Project adopts a participatory approach throughout implementation of the resettlement \nplan. Every month, a series of interactive sessions is held with all stakeholders, including affected \npersons, ward committee members, municipal councilors, and representatives of civil society \ngroups. Thirty-seven canal resettlement groups with a total of 460 affected person members have \nbeen formed. These groups meet regularly to decide on and discuss issues pertaining to their \ncommunities and will be the basis of housing cooperatives when affected persons are moved to \nthe Valmiki Ambedkar Shahari Aawas Yojna (VAMBAY) apartments.4 VAMBAY is a scheme of the \nMinistry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation of the Government of India. This scheme, \nlaunched in December 2001, provides grant subsidy for construction and rehabilitation of the \ndwelling units for the slum dwellers and the population living below the poverty line. The Project \nregularly  distributes  English  and  local-language  pamphlets  containing  information  about  the \nProject\u2019s progress to stakeholders. In addition, information booths have been set up at construction \nsites and in resettlement areas and are being set up in boroughs and canal settlements to increase \ninformation dissemination. Information about resettlement planning was disclosed to affected persons \nand other stakeholders. \n \n6.  At  the  settlement  level,  canal  resettlement  groups  address  the  grievances  of  affected \npersons. The groups are expected to resolve any issues brought to their attention within a week, \nafter which the grievance is brought to the attention of the relevant nongovernment organization \n(NGO), which has 1 week to resolve grievances.5 Grievances not resolved by the NGO are brought \nto the attention of the Social Development Unit, which in consultation with the councilor and \nappropriate government authority, will address the grievance within one week. Grievances not \nredressed  by  the  Social  Development  Unit  (SDU)  are  brought  to  the  Grievance  Redress \nCommittee,  which  consists  of  the  councilor,  two  SDU  staff,  two  project  staff,  and  two \nrepresentatives from the canal resettlement groups. Grievances not addressed by the Grievance \nRedress Committee within 2 weeks can be taken to the appropriate court. \n                                                 \n4  Canal resettlement groups will also be responsible for the operation and maintenance of infrastructure facilities, such \nas drainage, internal pathways, solid waste collection, and water supply in the apartments. \n5  Suggestion boxes have been placed at settlement sites so that affected persons who hesitate to approach canal \nresettlement groups, NGOs, or SDU can convey their complaints. The NGOs collect these complaints and forward \nthem to the SDU via the field staff every week. \n ", " \nTable A10.2: Entitlement Matrix \nItem  Definition of Entitled  Responsible \nNumber  Type of Loss  Application  Person  Compensation Policy  Implementation Issues  Agency \n  Canal       \nImprovement \nWorks \n1  Loss of  Loss of residential  Encroacher/squatter  (cid:131)  Provision of 190-square  (cid:131)  Each affected family  PMUs (primarily \nstructure  structure  household head  foot VAMBAY apartment  will contribute 5%b of  through the SDU). \nwith connections to basic  the total cost of the   \nurban services (water  apartment, which is  Highly vulnerable \nsupply, electricity, and  estimated at   households to be \nsewage) allotted on a 99- Rs4,000.c The  verified by the SDU. \nyear nonresalable lease.

Institutional Framework, Resettlement Costs, and Implementation Schedule \n \n8.  The KMC has established the SDU within its Project Management Unit that coordinates its \nactivities with all government agencies as well as with NGOs. The Irrigation and Waterways \nDepartment, the other executing agency for the Project, is responsible for implementing canal \nworks. The SDU is responsible for all tasks connected with the resettlement and rehabilitation of \nthe affected people in a participatory manner, for the livelihood restoration program, for internal \nmonitoring, and for reporting. This requires the SDU to be in regular consultation with affected \npersons in the field. Even though a strong field presence is essential, no staff will be recruited for \nthis purpose in either the KMC or the Irrigation and Waterways Department. Instead, the Project \nwill use consultants and engage NGOs as implementing agencies. Two NGOs have been engaged \nspecifically for field-level implementation of resettlement activities. The total estimated resettlement \ncosts are $6.90 million, including for transferring land from other government departments, for \ntransit villages, for VAMBAY units, for income restoration, and for administration. Resettlement \nimplementation is expected to be completed within a 19-month time frame.  \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n9.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  will  make  use  of  both  quantitative  and  qualitative \napproaches using a variety of tools and methods, such as key informant interviews, focus group \ndiscussions, community public meetings, structured direct observations, and case studies. The \nSDU will prepare a monthly plan to check the progress of implementation of the resettlement plan \nand will be responsible for conducting regular internal monitoring. Internal monitoring will cover \ncompensation and assistance; resettlement entitlements; transit camps; land development; income \nrestoration; special interventions for vulnerable groups; empowerment of through sensitization, \nparticipation, and training; information sharing and consultation; grievance redress; implementation \nstrategy and schedule sharing; coverage of affected persons under various government schemes \nfor poverty alleviation and income generation; and formation of women\u2019s self-help groups and the \nprovision of vocational training for such groups. Internal monitoring reports will be monthly. An \nexternal monitor will be engaged primarily to create a database to be used as a baseline for \nmonitoring project output and impacts, assess project outcomes and impacts, and identify quality \nof life indicators against which the impacts can be monitored. The external monitor will submit \nquarterly reports in the first 3 years and two reports for the remainder of the Project\u2019s duration. \nExternal monitoring will verify the results of internal monitoring and evaluate whether the objectives \nof the plan are being met. The external monitor will submit reports to both ADB and the Project \nManagement Units.  \n \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \n \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A11.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n($ million)\nForeign  Local  % of Total \nItem Exchange Currency Total Base Cost\nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The original scope of the Project (loan of $250 million) was designed to finance sewerage \nand  drainage  (S&D)  improvements,  slum  improvements,  and  canal  improvements  in  \nseven boroughs (I, XI, XII, XIII, XIV, VII, and XV). in the outer areas of Kolkata and to help all  \n15 boroughs of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) with stakeholder consultation programs, \nsolid  waste  management  improvements,  and  project  implementation  and  capacity  building.  \nThe supplementary loan ($79.33 million loan) is intended to cover S&D improvements in two \nboroughs  (VII  and  XV),1 for  canal  improvements  in  the  Churial  basin,  and  sanitary  landfill \nconstruction and associated resettlement and project implementation assistance and to support the \noriginal scope of the Project over an extended period of implementation. The economic analysis \nreappraises  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project  incorporating  design  changes,  revised  cost \nestimates, and updated information available from the socioeconomic survey in accordance with \nthe Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.2 \n \n2.  The Project focuses on providing services to the outer areas of Kolkata, which have been \nexperiencing rapid population growth of around 2.5% annually, much higher than the annual \ngrowth rate of 1% observed in the city\u2019s core areas, and which are therefore facing increasing \ndemand for urban services. Service coverage in the outer areas is low with 32% coverage by water \nsupply, 17% by sewerage systems, less than 50% by drainage systems, and less than 70% by \nsolid waste management. Without the Project, the service coverage would deteriorate further, as it \nwould be unable to keep up with the population growth. Furthermore, by focusing on the outer \nareas, the Project targets the poor, as the incidence of poverty is much higher in the outer areas of \nKolkata.  \n \nB.  Rationale for Government Intervention \n \n3.  The main goals of the Project are to improve the social, economic, and environmental \nquality of life in Kolkata; to reduce poverty in low-income areas by ensuring affordable access to \nbasic urban services; to reduce flooding in low-income areas; and to improve sewerage and \ndrainage (S&D) management systems, thereby decreasing the incidence of waste-related and \nwaterborne  diseases.  The  economic  rationale  for  the  intervention  is  sound,  because  (i)  the \ninvestment is large enough to achieve significant economies of scale; (ii) the services provided are \nof a public good nature, including protection of the environment and of public health; (iii) the Project \nfocuses  on  low-income  communities  with  a  view  to  distributing  income;3 and  (iv)  wastewater \nmanagement needs to be centrally controlled and monitored, as the wastewater discharges affect \nthe larger ecological system of the East Kolkata Wetlands, requiring management of externalities. \n \n4.  While the KMC, under the KMC Act, is responsible for all urban services assisted under the \nProject,  some  service  delivery  may  be  suitable  for  private  sector  participation  under  overall \nsupervision by the KMC. In particular, the transfer and disposal of municipal solid waste, including \na  compost  plant,  are  being  considered  for  a  public-private  partnership,  and  the  Project  has \nengaged  consultants  to  conduct  the  necessary  assessments  and  prepare  a  package  and/or \ncontract under an appropriate modality. The KMC is also considering extending a public-private \npartnership modality to primary collection of municipal solid waste in the long run.     \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The capital work includes sewerage and drainage and a sewerage treatment plant for sewage effluent from Borough \nVII. \n2  ADB. 1997.

Cost Overruns and Change in Project Beneficiaries \n \n5.  The supplementary loan of $79.33 million is required because of two main reasons:  \n(i) there was a loan cancellation of $72.2 million by the Government in expectation of the rupee \ndepreciating against the dollar and lower cost inflation; and (ii) there was cost escalation because \nof  minor  design  changes,  higher  than  expected  price  increases  in  materials  and  rupee \nappreciation, underestimation of costs at the appraisal stage, and delayed implementation. While \nthe Project has suffered from the cost escalation, the number of project beneficiaries was revised \nupward during the detailed design period, partially offsetting the negative impact on net benefits of \nthe cost escalation. The beneficiary population is now based on 2001 census figures, which were \nnot  available  at  the  appraisal  stage,  and  design  modifications  allowed  for  more  household \nconnections for the S&D component. In particular, Borough VII, which was added to the original \nscope of the S&D component, is the most congested borough among the outer areas and has an \nestimated 338,697 beneficiaries. All the economic costs and benefits are adjusted to constant 2006 \nprices.  \n \nD.  Alternatives Considered for the Supplementary Loan \n \n6.  For the S&D component, the area coverage, the number of beneficiaries, and the amount of \ndry weather flow (DWF) and storm water flow discharges are reestimated for each borough.  \nThe sewer network and the location of pumping stations are reconfigured to optimize system \nefficiency. Gravity outfall was proposed rather than pumping to the extent possible to minimize the \ninvestment and operation costs. The Government also proposed to drop two sewage treatment \nplants (STPs) and discharge sewage effluent into the DWF channels to further reduce costs. \nHowever, as the environmental impacts of discharging sewage effluent into the DWF channels and \ntreating it in the East Kolkata Wetlands could be significant, the two STPs are still included under \nthe  Project.  Reducing  the  coverage  of  S&D  and  canal  components  was  also  considered  to \ndownsize the Project and retain it within currently available funds, but as the Project was prepared \nas an integrated environmental improvement of the outer areas, dropping some boroughs or \ncanals would undermine the environmental impact of the Project. It was therefore decided to retain \nthe original scope of the Project for the S&D and canal components. \n \n7.  At the micro design level, alternative designs were considered and the best design was \nselected based on three factors: (i) the cost-effectiveness of the design, (ii) the operation and \nmaintenance capacity of the executing agencies, and (iii) the health hazard risk. Cost-effectiveness \nis assured by covering only the already densely populated areas or high population growth areas, \nas well as by using locally available materials and equipment for construction and maintenance; \nthe technology selected is manageable given the executing agencies\u2019 current capacity; and no \nsignificant health hazard risks are anticipated.  \n \nF.  Economic Viability of the Project \n \n8.  The  components  financed  under  the  supplementary  loan  mainly  include  (i)  S&D \nimprovements in boroughs VII & XV, and (ii) canal improvements along the Churial and Suti \ncanals. Economic analysis is undertaken for the S&D component assuming the entire scope of the \nProject financed by both the existing and the supplementary loans including seven boroughs, and \nthe scope of the Project financed by only the supplementary loan including two boroughs, while \neconomic analysis for canal improvements is conducted for the entire project scope only financed \nby both the existing and the supplementary loans.  \n \n9.  Assumptions. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is calculated by estimating the \nincremental economic benefits and costs over a 25-year period upon commission of the Project.  \nAll the costs are expressed in constant 2006 prices and are adjusted to economic prices with a \nshadow exchange rate factor of 1.1 and a shadow wage rate of 0.7 for unskilled labor. Incremental \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs (0.7% of investment costs) are added to capital costs to \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \nobtain the total economic cost of the Project. For the S&D component, the capital replacement \ncosts are added at 80% of equipment investment costs in fiscal year (FY) 2024.   \n \n10.  The S&D component will benefit 1.34 million people in the entire scope and 0.44 million in \nthe limited scope financed only by the supplementary loan by FY2010, the first year of operation. \nThe canal component will benefit 1.25 million people in the entire scope by FY2010. These are \nincreases from the appraisal figure of 1.07 million for the S&D component in the entire scope and \n0.72 million for the canal component in the entire scope,  respectively. One of the quantified \neconomic benefits for both components is health benefits, which are estimated by multiplying \ndisability-adjusted life years saved because of the Project by the median per capita income. \nDisability-adjusted life years are derived from the number of life years lost because of a disability \nusing a scale from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (death). In 1992, an estimated 171 disability-adjusted life \nyears per 1,000 population were lost in West Bengal.4 For this economic analysis, disability-\nadjusted life year losses attributable to poor S&D and poor canal management are assumed to be \n15% and 2%, respectively. The median household income in 2006 prices is Rs103,496 ($2,352) \nper year. This means that the average loss per capita resulting from illness is Rs2,923 ($66.4) per \nyear. Hence the per capita loss caused by poor S&D and poor canal management is Rs452 ($10) \nand Rs52 ($1.2) per year, respectively. The economic value of health benefits is assumed to \nincrease in line with real increases in state domestic product per capita. The per capita state \ndomestic product of West Bengal increased at an average annual rate of 5.51% during FY1993\u2013\nFY2002.5 This analysis assumed that the per capita value of health benefits increases at an annual \nrate of 6%.  \n \n11.  Other quantified benefits for the S&D component include (i) savings in household (private) \nhealth expenditures that represent about 1.9% of total household expenditure in the KMC area;  \n(ii) savings in public health expenditures equivalent to 15% of the amount spent annually on \nhospital and health services by the KMC; (iii)  savings in the costs of repairing damage to roads \nand  vehicles  caused  by  flooding,  assuming  that  20%  of  the  KMC\u2019s  expenditure  on  road \nmaintenance is related to flooding and an 50% of vehicle maintenance expenditures are due to \nflooding; (iv) avoided expenditures on construction and maintenance of septic tanks considering \nthe average annual price per household for cleaning and renting a septic tank; (v) benefits from \ncleaner water downstream of the STPs for communities that use canal water for washing, bathing, \ndomestic water supply, irrigation, etc; and (vi) business benefits derived from fewer disruptions of \neconomic  activities  from  flooding,  especially  for  small  firms  and  the  informal  sector.  Other \nquantified benefits for canal components include (i) savings in expenditures on repairs of dwellings \nand other properties damaged by waterlogging, assuming that 6.25% (5.00% for dwellings and \n1.25%  for  other  properties)  of  total  household  expenditures  on  repairs  is  related  to  flooding;  \n(ii) recreational benefits estimated at 1% of income; (iii) reduced productive days lost because of \nflooding, assuming that the average number of days lost is 5 (2.5 days for working days lost \nbecause of flooding and 2.5 days because of disruption and clean-up operations after flooding) \ndays per household per year; and (iv) savings in private and public health expenditures.  \n \n12.  Both components also yield unquantifiable benefits, including (i) reduced private and \npublic  costs  of  mosquito  control,  (ii)  appreciation  of  land  values  because  of  the  improved \nenvironment and reduced risks of flooding, (iii) psychological benefits from reductions in morbidity \nand  mortality,  (iv)  reduced  traffic  disruptions  caused  by  flooding,  (v)  benefits  to  visitors  and \nnonresidents  working  in  the  areas,  and  (vi)  positive  impacts  on  tourism  and  tourist-related \nbusinesses. Hence the estimated EIRRs should be considered conservative.  \n \n13.  EIRR. The economic viability of the Project is summarized in Table A13. The EIRR for the \nS&D component is estimated at 12.7% for a full scope and at 11.8% for a supplementary scope, \nwhich are around the economic opportunity cost of 12.0%. At the same time, the EIRR for the \n                                                 \n4  Health and Family Welfare Department, GoWB. 1999. Health Indicators \u2013 West Bengal. West Bengal.  \n5  GoWB. 2005. Economic Review 2004\u20132005. West Bengal. \n ", "Appendix 12  59\ncanal component is estimated at 19.2%, much higher than 12.0%. Combining both S&D and canal \nimprovement  components,  the  EIRR  is  estimated  at  13.3%.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  also \nconducted with respect to cost and benefit assumptions and is also presented in Table A13. \nSwitching values for two parameters critical for the EIRR computation (i.e., the percentage of \ncapital costs assumed to go toward O&M costs and the number of beneficiaries) are shown in the \nbottom panel of Table A13. In the base case scenario, O&M costs are assumed to be 0.7% of \ncapital costs, while the 10% EIRR switching value for the percentage of capital cost going toward \nO&M costs is as high as 5.9% for the total investments. This means that even if the annual O&M \ncosts increase up to 8.4 times as much as that assumed in the base case scenario, the Project \nremains economically viable with an EIRR of 10%. Similarly, the number of beneficiaries can be \ndecreased  by  a  maximum  of  29.5%  from  the  base  case  assumption  for  the  Project  to  be \neconomically  viable  with  an  EIRR  of  10%.
