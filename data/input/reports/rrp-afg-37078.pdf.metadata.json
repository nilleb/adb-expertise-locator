A summary of the initial environmental examination is \nAssessment  in Appendix 11.  \n \nProject Description  The  Project  will  construct  and  rehabilitate  206  kilometers  of \ntransmission network, and rehabilitate the associated substations \nand distribution systems in 11 rural towns and adjacent rural areas \nin the northern, eastern, and southern provinces. The Project will \nconnect 90,700 new consumers, most of whom are poor, to the \ngrid and, in addition, will allocate 18,000 electricity connection kits, \nwith affordable and flexible payment options.  \n \nRationale  Most of Afghanistan\u2019s 28 million people\u2014mostly rural poor\u2014have \nno access to reliable, modern forms of energy such as electricity, \ngas, and liquid fuels. The national electrification ratio is about 9%. \nAs the power sector\u2019s poor state severely constrains economic \ngrowth, the Government puts priority on developing the sector. \n  Afghanistan\u2019s  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \nsystems have been severely damaged by years of conflict. There \nis no national transmission grid, and the overall condition of lines is \nvery  poor.  The  Northern  Transmission  Link,  which  is  being \nrehabilitated, serves the major northern cities and Kabul and is the \nbackbone  of  the  transmission  system.  Because  of  the  lack  of \ngeneration capacity, power has to be imported in the near term \nfrom neighboring countries, which are rich in gas. In the long term, \nwhen Afghanistan\u2019s hydropower potential is realized, power could \nbe exported to neighboring countries. The transmission system \nneeds to be rehabilitated and reinforced to improve reliability and \nreduce system losses. \n \n  Distribution  systems  are  stretched  beyond  their  technical  and \neconomic  lives  because  of  inadequate  investment  and  lack  of \nmaintenance.  The  substations  and  low-voltage  distribution \nnetworks are either destroyed or overloaded. A large number of \nunauthorized  consumers  are  overloading  the  system,  thus \nreducing supply voltage and increasing technical losses. ", "iv   \n  The Project is part of the Government\u2019s power master plan and is \nconsistent with the Government\u2019s policy of providing reliable power \nsupply to all Afghans. The Project\u2019s scope has been coordinated \nwith other external funding agencies.  \n \nA 2005 International Monetary Fund (IMF) debt sustainability study \nsuggests that Afghanistan will need to rely primarily on grants and, \nin a limited way, on borrowings. It highlights the importance of a \nhigh grant element for loans.  \n \nImpact and  The Project\u2019s objective is to improve power supply in the northern, \nOutcome  southern, and eastern areas of the country. Power supply will be \n  improved by rehabilitating and extending power transmission and \ndistribution  systems.  The  Project  will  construct  and  rehabilitate \ntransmission  lines  and  build  the  associated  substations  and \ndistribution  networks.  The  Project\u2019s  technical  assistance  (TA) \ncomponent will cover capacity building in the Ministry of Energy \nand Water (MEW) and Afghanistan Electricity Authority (DABM, \nthe vertically integrated power company) for the operation and \nmanagement of electricity business.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The  Project\u2019s  cost  is  estimated  at  $50.0  million  equivalent, \ncomprising a foreign exchange cost of $40.5 million (81%) and a \nlocal currency cost of $9.5 million equivalent (19%).  \n   \nFinancing Plan  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a \ntotal of $50.0 million (a grant of $23.5 million and a loan of $26.5 \nmillion) equivalent from its Special Funds resources to finance the \nforeign exchange and local currency cost. The approved waiver of \ncost-sharing limits for loans and TA operations for Afghanistan is \napplied to this Project. \n   \nLoan Amount and  A loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR 17.298 million \nTerms  ($26.5  million  equivalent)  will  be  provided  from  Special  Funds \nresources. \n   \nSpecial Terms  Concessional terms will be used to support economic recovery. \nThe terms will offer a 40-year maturity, including a 10-year grace \nperiod  with  1%  interest  charge  throughout  the  term  to  be \ncapitalized  during  grace  the  period  and  charged  to  the  loan \naccount. \n \nAllocation and  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  made  available  to  the \nRelending Terms  Implementing  Agency,  under  substantially  the  same  terms  as \nthose of the ADB loan.  \n \nADF Grant  Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX grant of $23.5 million will assist \nAfghanistan in the transition from a post-conflict situation to peace \nand stability.  \n ", "    v \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  MEW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  DABM  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency. \n   \nImplementation  Project  implementation  will  commence  in  July  2005  and  be \nArrangements  completed in 3 years. The project implementation support unit \nestablished  by  MEW  will  manage  day-to-day  project \nimplementation. \n \nProcurement  Loan-financed goods, services, and civil works will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement and by the \nprocurement  unit  of  the  Afghanistan  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment Services on behalf of the MEW and assisted by the \nproject implementation consultants. ADB  has approved advance \nprocurement action for the turnkey contracts, including preparation \nand  issuance  of  bid  documents,  and  evaluation  of  the  bids \nreceived.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  (40  person-months  international  and  100 \nperson-months domestic) will be required to assist the MEW and  \nthe  DABM  in  project  implementation.  All  project-financed \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for selection and engagement of \ndomestic  consultants,  pursuant  to  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection. MEW will take advance action to recruit the consultants.  \n \nProject Benefits  The Project will directly benefit about 1.2 million people, who are \nand Beneficiaries  largely poor (90,700 households), in 11 rural towns (Breshna Kot, \nImam Sahib, Jalalabad, Khan Abad, Mehtarlam, Muhammad Agha, \nPuli Alam, Qarghayi, Sarepul, Surobi, and Taluqan). Among the \ntargeted population, the number of consumers connected to grid \npower supply will increase from 28% to more than 50% by 2010. \nTransmission and distribution network losses will be reduced from \n35\u201340% to 30% by 2010. \n \nThe Project will benefit the poor living in rural towns. All surveyed \nbeneficiaries indicated that, after potable water, electricity (lighting, \nin  particular)  would  most  improve  their  living  conditions  and \nlivelihoods. They considered electricity as a means to improve \nlearning opportunities for children (49% of the population, up to 14 \nyears old). Access to electricity will allow home-based businesses \n(about  3.5%,  mostly  grocery  stores,  food  processing,  or  rug-\nmaking)  to  expand  into  small-scale  commercial  or  industrial \noperations. ", "vi   \n  Other benefits are improved health (fewer eye and respiratory \ninfections) as electricity will replace kerosene for lighting. Women \nare expected to benefit the most from the additional lighting and/or \nmotive  power  for  home-based  income-generating activities and \nfrom improved indoor air quality. The use of electricity will result in \nnet savings to consumers, as it is cheaper than kerosene and \nfuelwood.  \n \n  The overall financial and economic analyses have confirmed the \nviability of the project components. \n   \nRisks and  The overall political and security situation remains volatile and \nAssumptions  uncertain. Security\u2014mobility restriction to and within Afghanistan, \nand  personal  safety\u2014could  delay  project  implementation.  An \ninterministerial committee will be established to continue guidance \nin all aspects of security.  \n \nWeak implementation capacity on the part of the government could \nlead to delay in implementation. In addition, weak governance \nstructures within government raise the specter of corruption as a \nrisk.  Also  weak  implementation  capacity  in  accounting  and \nfinances  increases  these  risks.  The  risk  of  delay  because  of \ninadequate implementation capacity will be mitigated by training \nstaff of MEW (in project management, planning) and DABM (in \ndesign, implementation, and operation and maintenance).  \n \nAdequate  investment  in  generation  and  transmission  will  be \nensured  by  coordination  with  other  donor  agencies  and  the \nGovernment in a way consistent with the power sector master \nplan.  \n \nA further risk is that the allocation of electrification kits may be \ninfluenced by corruption. The Project protects against this risk by \nrequiring a transparent procedure to establish objective allocation \ncriteria for the kits. It also establishes a grievance, complaints and \ndispute resolution mechanism for customers receiving kits.  \n \nInstitutional reform required to improve the sector\u2019s sustainability \nand operation will be pursued under the Government\u2019s Priority \nReform and Restructuring program in cooperation with all external \nfunding agencies.  \n   \nTechnical  An  advisory  TA  for  $750,000  will  be  attached  to  the  loan  to \nAssistance  strengthen project management, planning, design, implementation, \nand operation and maintenance done by MEW. The TA will finance \nhuman resource development, and inland and overseas training of \nMEW and DABM personnel in selected utilities and management \ninstitutions. The TA will be financed as a grant from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. An international consultant and trainers will be \nrequired for 11 person-months intermittently, and will be engaged \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to  the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan for the  Power \nTransmission and Distribution Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance \n(TA) for capacity building of the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW), and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the \nTA. The Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Most of Afghanistan\u2019s nearly 28 million people are rural poor, with no access to reliable, \nmodern forms of energy such as electricity, gas, and liquid fuels.  As the power sector\u2019s poor \nstate severely constrains economic growth, the Government puts priority on developing the \nsector. Afghanistan\u2019s per capita power consumption is among the lowest in the world (21 \nkilowatt  hours  [kWh]  per  year),  and  only  about  234,000  customers  (less  than  10%1)  are \nconnected to the isolated public grid, of which about 30% is in Kabul. There is no national power \ngrid, and most rural areas are virtually unserved. Reliable power service is critical to economic \ngrowth, social equity, and political unity. \n \n3.  The  power  sector  needs  immediate  investment  in  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution. Four isolated power systems\u2014centered around Kandahar in the south, Kabul in the \ncenter, Herat in the west, and Mazar-e-Sharif in the north\u2014form the main power infrastructure \nas most rural town centers are remote, isolated, and separated by mountains. The power \ndistribution infrastructure has been destroyed and needs major rehabilitation. Although the total \ninstalled generation capacity is 453 megawatt (MW), only 250 MW is generated, and most \ngenerating units require overhaul or replacement. Appendix 2 analyzes the power sector in \ndetail. \n \n4.  Afghanistan has  large hydropower potential (more than 20,000 MW) that could be \nexported in the long term to lessen reliance on expensive gas-based generation in neighboring \ncountries. In the interim, however, Afghanistan has to rely on imported power to meet growing \npower demand. Based on annual power purchase agreements, it imports about 76 gigawatt-\nhours  (GWh)  from  Uzbekistan2  to  meet  demand  in  Balkh  and  Hairatan,  18.2  GWh  from \nTurkmenistan to meet demand in Herat, and 12.3 GWh from Tajikistan to meet demand in \nKunduz and other northern provinces. \n \n5.  A centralized transmission grid covering the whole country (based on load forecast) is \nnot economically feasible as the distance between load centers greatly raises the cost of \ntransmission and energy losses.  Two other transmission projects\u2014Hairatan to Pul-e-Khumri \n(funded by ADB) and Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul (funding under consideration by the US Agency for \nInternational Development [USAID] and the Government of India) are creating the backbone of \nthe transmission network, enabling the import of electricity to Kabul. The isolated distribution \nsystems  are  stretched  beyond  their  technical  and  economic  lives  because  of  inadequate \n                                                 \n1  Based upon 234,000 households with electricity, an average of 12 people per household, and a population of 28.5 \nmillion (9.85% electrification). \n2  Under the ongoing Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project, ADB is helping the \nGovernment enter into a power purchase agreement with Uzbekistan for 150 MW of power import. ", "2   \ninvestment and prolonged lack of maintenance. The electricity distribution system remains the \nweakest link in the economy, and investments and management reform are urgently needed to \ncapitalize on gains made in transmission and generation investments. The distribution networks \nin provincial cities have similar problems.  \n \n6.  Technical losses due to overloading of transmission and distribution equipment, and \nsubstandard overhead conductors and underground cable joints are estimated to be about 20\u2013\n25%. Nontechnical losses from pilferage and inappropriate metering are as high as 15\u201320%. \nOverall load shedding (cutting off the power on certain lines when demand becomes greater \nthan supply), unreliable supply, and high system losses have paralyzed the power sector.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Institutional Framework \n \n7.  In December 2004, the newly elected Government created the Ministry of Energy and \nWater (MEW) by merging the responsibilities of the Ministry of Water and Power and some \nresponsibilities  of  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Industry.  MEW  is  responsible  for  power, gas, \npetroleum, and water resources. In the power sector, MEW controls the operation of five state-\nowned  enterprises:  (i)  Afghanistan  Electricity  Authority  (DABM)\u2014power  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution; 5,421 employees; (ii) Spinghar Construction Unit\u2014civil works for \nthe power sector; 385 employees; (iii) Power Construction Unit\u2014erection of transmission and \ndistribution  lines  and  substations;  420  employees;  (iv)  Water  and  Power  Engineering \nConsultancy  Authority\u2014design  and  field  survey  of  new  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution; 182 employees; and (v) New and Renewable Energy Research and Development \nCentre\u2014development of renewable energy; 149 employees. Although the Enterprise Act of \n1980 sets out their responsibilities, in practice these enterprises are closely controlled by MEW. \nDABM\u2014the vertically integrated power utility\u2014manages about 80% of the country\u2019s electricity \nproduction, while the ministries of mines and industry and of light industry share management of \nthe remaining 20%. The Government owns all these enterprises, which directly report to MEW. \n \n8.  The massive brain drain and collapse of the educational system have left Afghanistan \nwith limited local analytical and management capabilities. Limited absorptive capacity is a major \nbottleneck for effective donor assistance. Business, technical, and operational skills must be \ndeveloped immediately to rebuild the power sector. External consultants have carried out \nprocurement, project management, and planning, on an interim basis, under different ADB \nprograms to develop institutions\u2019 capacity to assume responsibility for these functions and to \nimprove the country\u2019s capacity to absorb assistance. DABM lacks the economic and operational \nresources to provide basic electricity supply. Most DABM staff lack the technical skills to operate \nthe power system. DABM\u2019s financial situation is unsustainable mainly because of inadequate \ngeneration to meet demand, low tariffs, large losses, and poor collection. The Government \nrecently received World Bank assistance3 to commercialize DABM (i.e., to restructure and \nincorporate it, to computerize financial management, and to apply a recommended multiyear \ntariff path); and to wage a major public relations campaign to communicate the Government\u2019s \nvision, strategy, and reform program to all stakeholders. This initiative complements ADB\u2019s \nwork. \n \n                                                 \n3  Approved in June 2004, for $105 million to finance rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution network in Kabul, \nrehabilitation of Naghlu hydro power station, rehabilitation of 110 kV transmission line from Naghlu to Kabul East \nand Kabul North substations. ", "    3 \n \n  2.  Power Shortage in Kabul \n \n9.  Kabul, with 3 million people, has no permanent power source\u2014only three hydropower \nstations and a diesel-fueled gas turbine (44 MW). The total effective generation capacity is 145 \nMW, and the maximum peak demand is about 140 MW, excluding the 50 MW load that is \nusually shed during peak periods. A large part of electricity supply is generated by diesel and \nfunded by USAID. According to the Government\u2019s master plan, maximum demand in Kabul will \nreach about 320 MW by 2020, and new hydropower or gas-based thermal power production can \nbe available only after 2010. Under the master plan, the increase of power supply to Kabul in \nthe short term has to be based on a combination of the following: (i) new, small diesel plants; (ii) \nextension of the North West Thermal Power Station with a combined cycle unit; (iii) restoring of \noriginal generating capacity of existing hydropower plants; (iv) use of natural gas resources near \nSheberghan;  and  (v)  import  of  power  from  neighboring  countries  in  the  north  over  new \ntransmission lines to Kabul. \n \n10.  The Government plans to import about 150 MW from Uzbekistan to meet demand in \nKabul via Khulm and Pul-i-Khumri. The line from Amu (in Uzbekistan) to Kabul is about 500 \nkilometers (km): ADB is financing4 the stretch from Termez to Khulm and construction of two \nsingle  circuit  lines  from  Khulm  to  Pul-i-Khumri  (the  northern  link).  The  Government  has \nrequested USAID to finance the construction of the transmission line from Pul-i-Khumri to Kabul.  \n \n3.  Limited Rural Electrification \n11.  Rural electrification is a long-term prospect, and access to the grid for all is not a viable \nalternative. Most people live in rural areas and lead a very basic life. Their access to electricity \nis limited, almost nonexistent, worsening already poor education and health conditions. No \nmajor  small-scale  livelihood  program  has  been  developed  in  rural  areas.  Per  capita \nconsumption of electricity is 21 kWh per month (one 100-watt light bulb consumes 1 kWh in 10 \nhours). Rural electrification\u2014with emphasis on renewable energy\u2014may be the only way to \nrecover lost economic opportunities. The Government is undertaking a comprehensive survey in \nrenewable energy resources with support from ADB.5 The TA will establish the conditions \n(including a pilot project covering 10 remote villages) for using solar power in areas with no \naccess to grid power.  \n \n4.  Private Sector Participation \n12.  The power sector needs large amounts of investment in generation, transmission, and \ndistribution. The Government has relied on aid finance to meet its capital expenditure, and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs are sometimes externally financed as power supply \noperation is unable to recover full operation cost, a situation worsened by growing security and \nsafety concerns. The Government\u2019s dependency on aid financing is likely to continue in the \nshort to medium term, as the overall investment climate is not favorable to private or other \n                                                 \n4  ADB 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nTransitional Islamic State of Afghanistan for Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project. \nManila. \n5  ADB 2003. Renewable Energy Development in Small Towns and Rural Areas, Manila (TA 3874), for $450,000, \napproved on 21 March 2003. This TA complemented Subcluster 1 Capacity Building for Reconstruction of \nAgricultural and Natural Resources Management, which forms part of the TA Cluster (ADB. 2002. Technical \nAssistance Cluster to the Republic of Afghanistan for Capacity Building for Reconstruction and Development [TA \n3874-AFG, for $14.5 million, approved 15 May 2002]). ", "4   \ninvestors. In the interim, however, aid financing will benefit the private sector by reducing \noperational, regulatory, and policy uncertainties. Private sector participation will take two forms: \n(i) large-scale involvement (not necessarily direct equity investment) in generation to supply \nbase load for Kabul or other main cities and (ii) small-scale generation and distribution (by \ndomestic entrepreneurs) in isolated rural areas. Barely existent in the energy sector, private \nsector investment may be the only viable option to quickly electrify large parts of the country. \nMultiple wars over many years have left a weak power supply monopoly, unlike in many other \ncountries facing deregulation. Regulation, rules, and  agencies, while urgently needed, must \ntherefore be carefully crafted so as not to discourage investment. \n \n5.  Financial Sustainability \n13.  Financial sustainability needs infrastructure (generation, transmission, and distribution); \neffective  institutions  to  manage  the  business;  and  appropriate  tariff,  billing,  and  revenue \ncollection. Afghanistan is challenged on all fronts. This situation and medium-term prospects are \nsummarized in Appendix 2, Table A2.2. Although the average tariff for electricity is higher than \nin neighboring countries, tariffs6 only recover on average about 50% of cost. Unlike many \ndeveloping countries, Afghanistan has location-specific tariffs rather than a uniform national \ntariff.  This  average  domestic  tariff  varies  widely  depending  on  the  source  of  power: \nhydropower\u2014Kabul  and  Kandahar  (2.0  cents  per  kWh);  and  imported  energy  and  diesel \ngeneration\u2014Mazar-e-Sharif (5.2), Kunduz (5.9), and Herat (9.1). The Government is committed \nto full cost recovery of hydro-based electricity and to the phased increase of electricity tariffs \ntoward cost recovery in the medium term.  \n \n14.  Nontechnical  loss  (estimated  at  15\u201320%) will have to be minimized and collection \nefficiency (60-70%) improved. Most of the uncollected revenues\u2014AF1,300 million7 (about $30 \nmillion) as of the end of October 2004\u2014is mostly owed by public sector customers (e.g., the \nGovernment, military, and police). The Government has to ensure budget appropriation for \nunpaid customers in the Government sector and to issue policy guidelines on disconnection, \nand anti-theft measures.  \n \n6.  Government\u2019s Policies and Plans \n15.  The Government\u2019s goal is to make energy more available at least-cost and in an \nenvironmentally friendly manner. In February 2004, the Government formulated an electricity \nsector policy and a power sector road map (Appendix 2). The main elements of the policy are \nsector  restructuring,  unbundling,  establishment  of  a  regulatory  framework,  and \ncommercialization. The policy plans to supply the entire country  with reliable power and to \ncreate  730,000  more  connections  by  2010.  The  Government  aims  to  make  power  more \navailable in the main regions by (i) investing in system rehabilitation; (ii) increasing supply, in \npart  by  importing  power;  and  (iii)  expanding  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \ninfrastructure.  \n \n16.  The Government\u2019s reform plan is to corporatize DABM and appoint a new board of \ndirectors. Four vertically integrated business units will be established, reflecting the current and \nmedium-term regional grid structures: (i) Breshna East (covering Ghazni, Kabul, Khost , Logar, \nNangarhar, and Pak Tia provinces); (ii) Breshna North (Baghlan,  Balkh,  Faryab,  Jowzjan, \n                                                 \n6  Average cost of supply estimated at 7 cents per kWh; the average tariff across the country is about 3.5 cents per \nkWh. \n7  Provisional figure from DABM, to be confirmed by the Government and DABM by June 2005. ", "    5 \nKunduz, Samangan and Sarepul provinces); (iii) Breshna South (Helmand, Kandahar and Zabol \nprovinces); and (iv) Breshna West (covering Baghdis, Faryab and Herat provinces). An off-grid \naccess unit will cover all other rural, urban, and peri-urban areas and will eventually become a \nseparate rural electrification authority. MEW will be responsible for sector policy and planning, \nand will continue to prepare and implement sector policies, coordinate external assistance \nprograms, and improve governance in the sector. Certain non-core functions such as civil \nconstruction and erection being undertaken by enterprises under MEW\u2019s administrative control \nwill be divested.  \n \n17.  In part, the Government\u2019s policy follows the global trend of unbundling of the power \nsector, creation of an independent regulator, and separation of policy and operation. While an \nefficient energy sector is the paramount objective, care must be taken before implementing \nthese strategies. The electricity system is small and the incremental benefit of unbundling must \noutweigh the cost of unbundling in the long run. Afghanistan may not have the management and \ntechnical  staff  to  efficiently  operate  three  or  more  independent  companies  after  sector \nunbundling. ADB will continue its policy dialogue with the Government together with other \nexternal  funding  agencies  on  the  practical  options  for  restructuring  and  unbundling  in \naccordance with economies of scale. \n \n7.  Lessons Learned  \n18.  The key lessons learned from ADB operations since 2002 are the following: (i) the \nstrategic focus has to be linked to the Government\u2019s strategies and priorities, (ii) capacity \nbuilding should continue to be emphasized, and (iii) coordination with development partners \nmust be done properly. These lessons are included in the design of the Project, which covers (i) \nincreased access to reliable power, a key Government priority; (ii) a separate TA for capacity \nbuilding; (iii) active coordination through project implementation and support unit (PISU) and \nsteering  committee;  and  (iv)  project  components  that  development  partners  agree  are \nimmediate priorities. \n \n19.  Implementation  of  the  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction \nProject (EIRRP), the first energy project (footnote 2), was hobbled by new executing agencies\u2019 \nlack of familiarity with ADB guidelines and procedures. Implementation was delayed as MEW \nneeded to rely entirely on the consultants to prepare bid documents, manage the bidding \nprocess, and evaluate bids. Dedicated full-time consultants were not available and essential \nskills  were  not  transferred  to  MEW  staff.  Although  the  situation  has  improved  and  the \nGovernment has created a centralized PISU (para. 25) to avoid similar problems, one individual \nconsultant (project management specialist) was engaged under the ongoing TA cluster8 to help \nthe  MEW  in  (i)  advance  recruitment  of  the  implementation  consultants  and  (ii)  advance \nprocurement action of contractors for the turnkey contracts. Another individual consultant (and \ninstitutional and policy reform specialist) was engaged to facilitate progress on policy matters \n(regulation, tariff, and unbundling). \n \n20.  Because of limited competition for the large turnkey contracts under the EIRRP, the bid \nprices were much higher than the engineers\u2019 estimates. The Project will use smaller packages \nto attract more bidders and increase competition. As the route of transmission lines under this \nProject will pass through an area containing unexploded ordinance, the cost of de-mining, to be \ncarried out by United Nations Mine Action Center Afghanistan, will be the responsibility of \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002.

This will ensure that cost of security is competitively reflected in the bid \nprices.  The Ministry of Interior will be invited to join the project steering committee to ensure \nthat all security measures are considered.  \n \n8.  External Assistance \n21.  Previous  ADB  assistance  (mostly  transmission)  and  major  assistance  by  other  aid \nagencies to the power sector in Afghanistan are listed in Appendix 3. The power sector has \nreceived substantial support from German Development Cooperation via KfW (metering, billing, \nand renewable energy); USAID (generation); and the World Bank (distribution and generation), \nbesides ADB. The governments of India and Iran have provided financial assistance to finance \nkey power transmission links. KfW and ADB are promoting the use of renewable energy options \nfor Afghanistan. ADB regularly coordinates with all major external funding agencies through \nperiodic meetings on key policy issues. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy  \n22.  ADB  has  taken  a  three-pronged  approach  to  support  reconstruction  and  poverty \nreduction: building capacity, establishing appropriate policy and institutional framework, and \nrehabilitating essential infrastructure.9 ADB\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) maximizing the use of \nexisting infrastructure by rehabilitating power substations, power transmission, and generation \nprojects; (ii) improving the quality, reliability, and promotion of energy efficiency; (iii) managing \nsecurity issues by coordinating closely with all stakeholders; (iv) establishing policies and \ninstitutions to improve importation of energy; (v) using renewable energy where possible; (vi) \ndeveloping a consistent policy in regulation, environment, tariff, and energy efficiency; (vi) \nbuilding capacity across the sector and promoting private-public sector partnerships in projects; \nand (vii) fast-tracking implementation where possible. \n \n23.  The Project, with its emphasis on rehabilitation of power infrastructure, facilitation of \nenergy imports, promotion of energy efficiency (by using efficient lighting in connection kits), and \nsupport for capacity building, is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy. ADB will \nwork with the Government to encourage private companies to invest in generation in Kabul and \nprovincial cities, and small private distribution networks to operate in isolated rural communities. \nEstablishment of regulation by contract is necessary for private sector participation.  \n \n10.  Policy Dialogue  \n24.  While the Project will rehabilitate and reinforce transmission and distribution networks, it \nwill continue the policy thrust of the Post-Conflict Multisector Program Loan,10 which included \npolicy and institutional reform to improve institutional efficiency and cost recovery, establish a \nregulatory framework, and encourage private sector participation.  \n \na.  Institutional Reform \n25.  The Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) Program (Supplementary Appendix H) was \nlaunched by decree in July 2003 to kick-start the administrative reforms across Government \ndepartments and agencies. The PRR framework allows departments of ministries to be given \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2004.

MEW proposes \nto reform the ministry by (i) creating a PISU11 as the main implementation interface for aid-\nfunded projects to improve accountability, (ii) updating the electricity law, (iii) appointing a \ntechnical advisory board to support the minister or deputy minister; and (iv) establishing a high-\nlevel reform task force to lead the sector restructuring process. The PISU\u2019s overall goal is to \naccelerate the implementation of the power sector development program. Jointly with the World \nBank, ADB has supported the creation of the PISU using resources under the ongoing capacity-\nbuilding cluster TA (footnote 8). \n  \nb.  Private Sector Participation \n26.  The  energy  sector  is  dominated  by  public  sector  monopolies.  The  Government is \ndeveloping12 a framework to encourage private sector participation, particularly for base load \npower generation in large cities. As establishing a credible and capable independent regulator \ntakes time (at least 5\u20137 years), in the interim, ADB will help the Government create a simple \nform of regulation by contract for power generation and distribution, and exemptions from \nlicensing  requirements  for  small  captive  generation  and  embedded  distribution,  where \napplicable. Regulation by contract will commit the Government (and the regulatory commission \nthat it will create) to implement a pre-specified tariff-setting system (with a reasonably high \ndegree of certainty as to the company\u2019s future revenues over several years), whereas the \nprivate company will agree to provide power distribution or  generation service of agreed-on \nquality to specified customers over a defined period.  \n \n27.  Regulation by contract will (i) protect consumers from monopoly prices and poor service \nquality;  and  (ii)  attract  investors,  by  reducing  regulatory  risk,  who  will  invest  in  providing \naffordable  service.  However,  large  private  investors  in  the  main  cities  are  likely  to  be \ndiscouraged by perceived security and political risks, and only local small private investors in \nremote rural distribution and generation may benefit from simple regulation, as they are likely to \nbe less sensitive to such risks.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n28.  The Project\u2019s objective is to improve power supply in the northern, southern, and eastern \nareas of the country  by  rehabilitating  and  extending  power  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems. The Project will complement an earlier ADB  project (footnote 4) that rehabilitated and \nreconstructed damaged transmission lines and substations in the north for importing power from \nneighboring  countries.  The  Project  will  help  strengthen  institutions  to  accelerate  project \nimplementation and improve sector efficiency.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n29.  The Project\u2019s scope will cover the region north of Hindu Kush mountain, the central \neastern region from the central Hindu Kush to Kabul and eastward, and the southern region. A \nportion of the Project will be financed by grant (para. 33). Access to electricity is essential for \n                                                 \n11  The PISU is supported by a team of international consultants.  \n12 MEW, in its submission to the National Development Budget to Ministry of Finance on 17 January 2004, identifies \nlack of private sector participation as a key problem and lists a set of actions to solve it. ", "8   \neconomic growth. As most electricity customers are poor, the Project will  benefit them. The \nProject will rehabilitate distribution, which will support small infrastructure and create jobs, and \nconnect new customers (including poor and isolated communities) to power sources. The \ndistribution components will be financed by grant and the transmission components by loan. \nThe components are: \n \n (i)  Grant-financed portion of the Project (low-voltage distribution) \n \n(a)  Northern  area.  Construction  of  substations  at  Imam  Sahib,  Sarepul, \nTaluqan  and  a  switching  station  at  Shekanbandar;  construction  of \ndistribution  network  in  Khan  Abad,  Imam  Sahib  and  Taluqan  (51,000 \nhouseholds); and provision of 9,000 electrification kits. \n \n(b)  Central  and  eastern  area.  Rehabilitation  of  substations  at  Jalalabad, \nMehtarlam, Qarghayi and Surobi; rehabilitation of distribution networks in \nJalalabad  and  Mehtarlam  (23,000  households);  and  provision  of  6,300 \nelectrification kits. \n   \n(c)   Southern  area.  Construction  of  substations  at  Puli-Alam  and  Gardez; \nrehabilitation of city distribution networks in Puli-Alam, Muhammad Agha, \nand Gardez (16,500 households); and provision of 3,000 electrification kits. \n \n(iii)  Loan-financed portion of the Project (110 kV transmission) \n \n (a)  Northern  area.  Construction  of  a  20  km  single  circuit  line  from \nShekanbandar to Imam Sahib.  \n \n(b)  Central and eastern area.  Construction of 75 km single circuit line from \nNaghlu east to Jalalabad, and 17 km double circuit 110 kV from Mehtarlam \nto Jalalabad. \n \n(c)  Southern area. Construction of 12 km double circuit 110 kv transmission \nline from Breshnakt to Kabul South, and  43 km (one circuit of a double \ncircuit) 220 kV transmission line from Kabul South to Puli-Alam, and 51 km \nPuli-Alam to Gardez. \n \n30.  The Project\u2019s components are the most critical ones in the Government\u2019s power master \nplan and consistent with a least-cost power sector development plan for the regions.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n31.  The social and poverty survey undertaken during project preparation noted that the \naverage cost for a new household connection was $31. Although the survey noted a high \nwillingness to pay for electricity, the project beneficiaries may not be able to pay the one-time \nconnection  charge  and  the  internal  wiring  costs  for  lighting  and  power  points.  Improper \nconnections are a fire and personal safety hazard. To ensure safe and affordable connection, \nthe Project will provide electrification kits, which will include a standard meter, two compact \nfluorescent lights, and a double power point. Kit users will have immediate access to electricity, \nwith a flexible payment option levied through the kit tariff (repayment over a period rather than \nupfront). Detailed descriptions of the kits are in Appendix 4. \n ", "    9 \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n32.  Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 1. The total project cost is $50.0 million, \nincluding physical and price contingencies, and service charges during construction. The foreign \nexchange cost is $40.5 million, or about 81% of the total and the local currency costs of $9.5 \nmillion, or 19% (Appendix 5).

Financing Plan \n \n33.  The Government has requested a loan of $26.5 million and a grant of $23.5 million (total \n$50.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to finance the entire cost of the \nProject, comprising foreign exchange cost of $40.5 million and local currency costs of $9.5 \nmillion (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2: ADB Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total   \nSource \nCost \nExchange  Currency  % \nGrant   19.44  4.06  23.50  47 \nLoan   21.06  5.44  26.50  53 \n  Total  40.50  9.50  50.00  100.0 \nSource: ADB estimates. \n ", "10   \n34.  The loan will have a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, and an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum. The total amount of the interest charge during the grace \nperiod will be capitalized and charged to the loan account. The Government will make the loan \navailable  to  DABM  under  a  subsidiary  financing  agreement  with  conditions  similar  (same \ninterest rate and loan terms) to the ADB loan. The Government will bear the foreign exchange \nrisk.  \n \nF.  Asian Development Fund (ADF) IX Grant Financing \n35.  Under the ADF IX resolution13 donors agreed that ADF grants could be used to assist \npoor countries make the transition from post-conflict to peace and stability. Afghanistan was \nidentified as one of the poorest post-conflict countries and eligible for ADF grants14. Prolonged \nconflict has endangered the poor, destroyed their economic opportunities, damaged water and \nelectricity infrastructure, and disrupted delivery of basic services to the neediest. Access to a \nreliable  power  source  is  a  prerequisite  for  sustained  economic  growth,  and  grants  can \naccelerate such growth. The Project will increase access to power by rehabilitating distribution \nsystems and providing electrification kits. \n \n36.  Afghanistan has made significant progress since the ouster of the Taliban regime. The \nGovernment has implemented a wide range of structural reforms and adhered to almost all \nquantitative indicators and structural benchmarks under the Staff-Monitored Program, led by the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  Notwithstanding  these  achievements  and  double-digit \neconomic growth over the last 2 years, the economic and fiscal situation continues to be \nextremely fragile. Security, economic, social, and administrative challenges are formidable. The \ncountry continues to need external development finance that does not fiscally burden the \nnascent administration. \n \n37.  The high growth rates since the end of the conflict have been fuelled primarily by \nexternal funding agency supported relief and construction activities as well as by the temporary \nend to the drought. However, to achieve growth targets over the medium term and to gradually \nreplace  opium  production,  the  Government  must  aim  for  broad-based  and  sustainable \ndevelopment and identify new drivers of growth. Investment in the power sector is a prerequisite \nfor sustained economic growth, and grants will greatly help accelerate this transition. Appendix \n4 describes the justification for the grant, and the debt sustainability issues in detail.  The \nGovernment will make the grant available to DABM under the subsidiary financing agreement \nwith  conditions  including  DABM  perform  the  project,  and  write-down  outstanding  debt  of \ngovernment departments in amounts equal to or less than disbursements of the grant.  \n \nG.  Special Terms \n38.  The ADF lending terms approved by the ADB Board of Directors, while generous, are \nnot  sufficient  for  sustainable  development.  The  Government  requested  more  concessional \nfunding for the transition and reconstruction phase, and ADB approved this request in the \nEIRRP (2003) and the Agriculture Sector Program (ASP)15 (2004). It is therefore proposed that \nthe loan be made on concessional terms identical to those of the EIRRP and ASP. These are (i) \ngrandfathering pre-1999 ADF lending terms so that the loan has 40-year maturity including a \n                                                 \n13 Eighth Replenishment of the Asian Development Fund and Third Regularized Replenishment of the Technical \nAssistance Special Fund\" (ADF IX Resolution) \n14 Paragraph 23 of the ADF Staff Instructions Program, 16, November 2004. \n15 ADB. 2004.

The justification for the proposed loan term is the same as that given in \nthe  EIRRP  and  ASP.  Appendix  4  describes  the  justification  for  special  terms,  and  debt \nsustainability issues in detail.  \n \n39.  Substantial continued donor assistance will be required for the recurrent budget over the \nmedium term. Recurrent expenditures for FY2005 amount to $609 million, while revenues are \nexpected  to  amount  to  about  $256  million,  which  means  that  almost  60%  of  recurrent \nexpenditures will have to be financed by foreign assistance. The capital and development \nbudget for FY2005 of $4,068 million is to be financed entirely by external funding agencies. A \nrecent IMF report16 expressed serious concern about the fiscal sustainability of the Government \npayroll and security expenditures and highlighted the importance of continued assistance from \nexternal funding agencies. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n40.  MEW will be the Executing Agency for the Project, and DABM will be the Implementing \nAgency. The PISU established by MEW will manage day-to-day project implementation. DABM \nwill assign at least one engineer in each project province to supervise the contractors full-time. \nThe implementation consultant will help certify construction progress and issue approvals. The \nDABM staff will report to the project manager of the PISU. Appendix 6 shows the project \nimplementation organization.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n41.  The Project will be implemented in 36 months, commencing July 2005. A detailed \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.   \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n42.  Loan-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement, by the procurement unit of the Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development \nServices on behalf of the MEW, and assisted by the implementation consultants. The EA will \nexecute and administer the contracts as employer. \n \n43.  Contracts for design, installation, and construction of transmission lines, substations, \ndistribution lines, and connection kits will be divided into contract packages. The electrification \nkits  will  be  procured  under  a  single  turnkey  contract  package.  The  contracts  have  been \npackaged  as  turnkey  (design-build)  contracts  to  ensure  completion  within  the  project \nimplementation period. It is  anticipated that all turnkey contracts will be awarded following \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. \n \n44.  Construction and O&M equipment, communication equipment, and vehicles valued at \n$0.5 million or less will be procured through international shopping, and through international \ncompetitive bidding if above $0.5 million. List of contract packages is in Appendix 8. \n \n                                                 \n16 Third Review Under the Staff Monitored Program, Concluding Statement, 3 February 2005. ", "12   \n45.  Management has approved the Government\u2019s request for advance procurement action \non the understanding that such approval does not commit ADB to financing the Project. Bidding \ndocuments have been prepared and will be issued by March.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n46.  Consulting services will be required to help the MEW and DABM implement the Project. \nThe consulting services will involve project management, detailed design, preparation of bid \ndocuments,  assistance  in  procurement,  supervision  of  construction  and  installation  of \nequipment, testing and certifying of completed works, training of MEW and DABM staff in \nmanagement and O&M and in monitoring and evaluation. The consultants will also assist the \nMEW in environmental management and monitoring of social and resettlement safeguards. \n \n47.  The consultants will be selected and engaged through an international consulting firm in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for selection and engagement of domestic consultants. The quality- and \ncost-based selection method will be used. A total of 40 person-months of international and 100 \nperson-months  of  domestic  expertise  will  be  required.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 9.  \n \n  5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n48.  Loan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nprimarily using direct payment procedures for large turnkey contracts and consulting services, \nand commitment procedures for supply and delivery contracts. The consultants will assist the \nEA in environmental management and monitoring. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n49.  The PISU will prepare quarterly progress reports for the project components and submit \nthem ADB to within 6 weeks of the end of each quarter. The reports will describe progress made \nduring  each  period,  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule,  problems  or  difficulties \nencountered  and  the  remedial  actions  taken,  performance  of  the  project  implementation \nconsultants, and work to be carried out in the upcoming period.  \n \n50.  Within 6 months of the closing of each financial year, DABM will submit to ADB annual \nproject accounts and, within 9 months, annual DABM financial statements. The project accounts \nand financial statements will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, with the \nauditors\u2019 observations covering loan proceeds and compliance with loan covenants. A project \ncompletion report will be submitted to ADB within 3 months of project completion. The reports \nwill review the attainment of planned objectives and the achievement of the project outputs, \nincluding costs and benefits derived, as well as performance and contribution of all parties \nassociated with project execution. \n \n51.  DABM will submit to ADB compiled information of billed and collected amounts, grouped \nby aging (outstanding period), region, and customer type. The report will contain a list of bad \ndebtors,  remedial  actions  taken,  targeted  and  achieved  collection,  and  numbers  of  new \nconnections and disconnections, for each region and each customer type.  \n ", "    13 \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n52.  The  PISU,  with  the  assistance  of  the  implementation  consultants,  will  establish  a \ncomprehensive project performance evaluation and monitoring system acceptable to ADB and \nimplement it by conducting quantitative and qualitative performance monitoring for each project \ncomponent to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the project benefits accrued.  \n \n8.  Project Review \n53.  The Project will be supervised by ADB through two review missions each year. ADB will \nmonitor implementation of all components through quarterly progress reports. In addition to the \nnormal periodic reviews, ADB and the Government will undertake a midterm review 2 years \n(around June 2007) after project implementation begins. The midterm review will include a \ndetailed evaluation of project scope, implementation arrangements, resettlement, consultation \nwith project-affected people, and achievement of scheduled targets, progress in policy reforms, \nand capacity-building measures. \n \n9.  Environmental and Social Measures \na.  Environmental Aspects \n \n54.  The Project is classified under category \u201cB\u201d in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental \npolicy (2002). An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared. Sufficient community \nconsultations  for  a  category-B  project  were  undertaken  during  project  design.  All  project \ncomponents follow environmental safeguards and technical specifications established for ADB-\nfinanced  projects.  The  Project  has  been  prepared  to  follow  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \nenvironment policy and the relevant parts of the Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). \nThe summary IEE is in Appendix 11. Based on the IEE, the Project will generate only minor \nenvironmental impacts, which can be mitigated by standard measures normally associated with \ninternational best practices in the design and construction of transmission lines, substations, \nand  distribution  systems.  An  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  has  been \ndeveloped  and  will  be  implemented  by  MEW.  Mitigation measures will be specified in all \ncontract documents. Any minor environmental impacts will be offset considerably by the benefits \nthat will accrue from the Project.  \n \n55.  MEW is responsible for ensuring that the Project is implemented in an environmentally \nacceptable manner in accordance with the Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n(EMPP). Since MEW has limited environmental capacity, designated staff members must be \ntrained in environmental management and monitoring of power transmission and distribution \nprojects. An international (1.5 person-months) and a local (3.0 person-months) environmental \nspecialist have been included in the project implementation consultant\u2019s team to train MEW staff \nmembers in environmental management, establish routine environmental monitoring protocols, \nand  undertake  periodic  environmental  monitoring  and  audit  of  construction  works  during \nconstruction.  \n \nb.  Social and Poverty Aspects \n \n56.  The project design included a social and poverty assessment  of 21 districts in four \nregions\u2014north (Sarepul, Puli-e-Khumri-Kunduz, Shekhanbandar-Imam Sahib); east (Butkak, \nSurobi-Jalalabad-Mihtarlam);  and  southeast  (Muhammad  Agha-Gardez-Ghazni-Khost).  The \nsurvey team, including MEW staff members, surveyed over 1,100 households across the project ", "14   \nregions and conducted town meetings in nine project towns. The social and poverty survey \nshowed  that  the  communities  prioritized  their  development  needs:  potable  drinking  water, \nelectricity,  educational  facilities,  and  health facilities. All respondents said electricity would \nimprove children\u2019s learning opportunities as it would replace kerosene for lighting. Almost all \nrespondents said electricity would improve livelihoods (98.3%) and health (95.0%). Women are \nexpected to be the main beneficiaries of additional lighting and/or motive power for home-based \nincome-generating  activities  and  improved  indoor  air  quality.  The  survey  established  that \nalthough the main use of electricity was for household lighting, people were willing to invest in \nother appliances to improve living conditions and livelihoods. The poverty and social analyses \nare in Appendix 12.  \n \n57.  Alternative  sources  for  lighting  include  kerosene  or  diesel  lamps,  small  diesel \ngenerators, and battery-operated lights, and cost significantly more than grid electricity. It was \nclear that even the poorest could afford grid-connected electricity more than alternative forms. \nElectricity will be new to many project beneficiaries, and a safety awareness campaign is \nincluded  in  the  terms  of  reference  of  the  implementation  consultants  (Appendix  9).  The \ncampaign will be conducted via schools, printed materials, community meetings, and the radio. \nSafety information will be included in the connection kits and during local consultation meetings. \n \n58.  The Government will work closely with the communities to ensure that men and women \nbenefit equally from the Project. Contractors will be required to ensure equal payment for equal \nwork. MEW\u2019s capacity to implement the social safeguards (resettlement action plan and social \nimpact monitoring) is poor. MEW (with the assistance of the project implementation consultant) \nwill  be  responsible  for  ensuring  on  a  day-to-day  basis  that  the  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring activities identified in the social safeguards are implemented. A PISU member will be \nappointed as a social safeguard supervisor, to oversee the implementation safeguard plans, \nand will receive on-the-job training and assistance from the project implementation consultants. \nc.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n59.  As the Project mainly involves restoration, land will be required only temporarily for \naccess  ways  during  construction.  For  alignment  of  new  transmission  lines,  potential \nresettlement issues will be minimized: where possible, lines will be placed on roadside reserves \nor on unused land. All new substations will be placed only on Government land. For local \ndistribution, poles will follow only local roads, leaving adequate distance for houses, and will not \nobstruct public and private access. All distribution transformers will be pole mounted. As such, \nthe Project is classified under category B.17 \n \n60.  A short resettlement plan has been prepared based on consultations with the project-\naffected people and other stakeholders. The plan has been translated into Dari and Pushto, and \ncommunity meetings were held in November and December 2004 to explain it to project-\naffected communities. Upon completion of the detailed measurement survey of the line routes, \nspecific project-affected people will be informed about compensation rates based on actual \nmarket rates at the time of the detailed measurement survey. The finalized dispute resolution \nsystem has three stages: (i) complaints by project-affected people on compensation and unpaid \nlosses may be filed with their village resettlement committee; (ii) if they are not satisfied or \nreceive no reply from the committee, the grievance applications will be forwarded to the district \nresettlement committee; (iii) if the complainants are not satisfied with the decision, or if the \n                                                 \n17 Under 200 people will be displaced from their houses, under 200 people will lose less than 10% of their income-\ngenerating assets, and 200 or more people will experience minor impacts. ", "    15 \ncommittee does not reply, they can forward their complaints to the committee on compensation, \nwhich will issue the final decision within 30 days. The summary resettlement plan is in Appendix \n13, and the detailed resettlement plan in Supplementary Appendix F. The resettlement plan will \nbe disclosed on the ADB website upon project approval. \n \nd.  Indigenous People \n61.  The  Project  is  classified  under  category  B.  Although  estimates  vary,  the  ethnic \ncomposition of Afghanistan is around 38% Pashtun, 25% Tajik, 19% Hazara, 6% Uzbek, and \n12% other groups. The social and poverty survey indicated the following composition in project \nareas: 52.0% Pashtun, 35.3% Tajik, 7.0% Uzbek, 2.3% Turkmen, 1.8% Hazara, 0.2% Nuristani, \n0.2% Aimaq, and 0.3% other groups. Ethnic relations have varied with the political climate, but a \ncommon theme has been the notable difference of the Hazaras, who are Sunni Muslims (rather \nthan Shi'a Muslims like the Pashtuns and Tajiks). \n \n62.  Socioeconomic  change  is  likely  to  result  from  increased  electrification  rates  of \nhouseholds and education sectors with no negative effects. The Project will bring grid power for \nthe first time to areas with high numbers of ethnic minorities, such as Imam Sahib and Sarepul, \nwhile bringing equal benefits to the wider population A small fund for social development of \nwomen and minorities will be established to mitigate any negative impacts (Supplementary \nAppendix B). The fund  will assist up to 200 project-affected women and poor minorities. A \nnongovernment organization will be contracted to monitor the resettlement action plan and to \nuse  it  to  train  project-affected  women  and  minorities  through  a  livelihood  program.  Each \neligible18  household  will  receive  AF3,00019  for  small  businesses  or  alternative  income \ngeneration, such as livestock, microenterprise, carpet weaving. MEW\u2019s Environmental and \nSocial Impact Assessment Office will coordinate the collection of household baseline data to \nmonitor the poverty program and resettlement impact.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n63.  MEW\u2019s  weak  institutional  capability  is  a  major  constraint  on  the  power  sector\u2019s \ndevelopment. The ministry needs training in modern planning and utility management, as well \nas information technology and communication facilities. An advisory capacity-building TA will be \nadded to the proposed ADB loan, which will strengthen MEW\u2019s project management, planning, \ndesign, implementation, and O&M activities (Appendix 14). ADB  will help develop practical \ntraining  in  program  management  and  portfolio  review,  and  build  institutions  to  ensure \nsustainability  of  training  operations.  Where  possible,  bilateral  exchange  programs  will  be \ndeveloped with electricity companies in the region to develop role models for Afghan managers. \nThe total TA cost is estimated at $750,000, comprising foreign exchange cost of $680,000 and \nlocal currency cost of $70,000. The TA will be financed on  a grant basis from the ADB TA \nfinancing program. The TA will finance the services of an international consultant and of trainers \nfor 11 person-months on an intermittent basis. They will be engaged individually in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultant will have expertise in capacity \nbuilding and training, and will assess the training needs of MEW and DABM. \n \n                                                 \n18 Impacted by the Project (land acquisition or cutting down of trees etc. rather than physical displacement) where the \nhousehold head is either an ethnic minority member or female or both (since these groups are more vulnerable to \npoverty). \n19 About $60, a figure determined through consultations in the field as sufficient for small-business set-up costs. ", "16   \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic and Financial Assessment \n1.  Economic Analysis \n64.  Investments to rehabilitate and upgrade the utilities\u2019 infrastructure or to expand supplies \nwill greatly improve the extent and quality of service. In particular, investments to upgrade the \nasset base are expected to increase economic and financial returns. Better quality of supply and \ngreater access to electricity are expected to reduce the cost of energy for households and to \nsupport  productive  activities  (industrial,  commercial,  etc.),  and  thereby  help  meet  the \nGovernment\u2019s growth and poverty reduction objectives. \n \n65.  The  Project\u2019s  economic  analysis  is  based  on  incremental  cost-and-benefit  streams \nassociated with each component, whose economic performance is evaluated by comparing \nwith- and without-project scenarios. Revenue is based on incremental electricity sales to the \nadditional  customers  to  be  connected  and  financed  under  the  Project.  The  value  of  the \nincreased sales is a measure of project benefits. The value of electricity is derived from the cost \nof  alternate  energy  sources  that  consumers  use.  Incremental  benefit  is  calculated  using \ncustomers\u2019 willingness to pay. The overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is about 33% \n(Appendix 15, Table 15.1). The sensitivity of economic performance to changes in key variables \nhas been tested. In general, EIRRs are not sensitive to the variables tested, even for the \nmultiple downside scenarios. \n \n2.  Financial Analysis \n66.  For financial evaluation, cost streams reflect incremental costs in delivering the benefits \nidentified. Financial costs comprise costs of capital, incremental energy, O&M, administration \n(particularly  additional  billing),  and  taxation.  Capital  costs  include  physical  contingencies. \nIncremental energy costs are accrued to additional generation and power purchase to be \nsupplied to the project area. DABM\u2019s sources of generation are mostly hydro,  but relatively \ninexpensive power imports will be available to the project area through the transmission lines to \nbe extended by the Project. O&M costs for transmission and distribution systems are estimated \nto be 1.0% and 1.5% of required capital costs.  \n \n67.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is calculated on the basis of the Project\u2019s \nincremental cost-and-benefit streams. The FIRR after tax is 11.8%, which is higher than the \nweighted average cost of capital. The FIRR was tested for sensitivity to changes in key \nvariables. The results are summarized in Appendix 16, Table A.16, indicating that the overall \nProject is financially feasible. The FIRRs are not sensitive to variables tested, even for multiple \ndownside (combined) scenarios.  \n \nB.  Social and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n68.  A  benefit  distribution  analysis  conducted  as  part  of  the  social  and  poverty  survey \nestimated the number of beneficiaries for each town by extrapolating the number of poor for \neach town, each town\u2019s electrification rates, and customers\u2019 willingness to pay for electricity. \nThe results indicate that the Project would directly benefit 1.2 million poor people, or 95,500 \nhouseholds\u2014about 80% of the target population of 1.5 million.  \n ", "    17 \n69.  Benefits to the poor will be increased economic opportunities and improved health. \nAppendix 12 shows the calculation for proportion of poor beneficiaries. A distribution analysis of \nproject  benefits  was  carried  out  for  the  affected  groups  identified  as  producers  (DABM), \nunskilled labor (10% of the project cost), the Government, and electricity consumers (90% poor, \nliving below $1 per day). The analysis quantified the incidence of poverty in the project areas by \nusing poverty profiles of different proposed routes, and the result was included in the economic \nviability of that route. The poverty impact ratios (PIRs) for the subprojects were computed at \n25%  to  over  100%.  PIRs  are  all  high  primarily  because  the  overwhelming  proportion  of \nelectricity  consumers  in  the  target  area are poor, and electricity consumers are the main \nbeneficiaries. PIRs greater than 100% indicate that at least one project-affected group (DABM in \nall cases) faces financial loss in providing positive economic value to consumers. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n70.  The overall political and security situation remains volatile and uncertain. Security\u2014\nmobility  restriction  to  and  within  Afghanistan,  and  personal  safety\u2014could  delay  project \nimplementation. An interministerial committee will be established to continue guidance in all \naspects of security.  \n \n71.  Weak implementation capacity on the part of the government could lead to delay in \nimplementation. In addition weak governance structures within government raises the specter of \ncorruption as a risk. Also weak implementation capacity in accounting and finances increases \nthese risks. The risk of delay because of inadequate implementation capacity will be mitigated \nby  training  staff  of  MEW  (in  project  management,  planning)  and  DABM  (in  design, \nimplementation, and operation and maintenance).  Institutional reform required to improve the \nsector\u2019s sustainability and operation will be pursued under the Government\u2019s Priority Reform \nand Restructuring program in cooperation with all external funding agencies. \n \n72.  Adequate investment in generation and transmission will be ensured by coordination \nwith other donor agencies and the Government in a way consistent with the power sector \nmaster plan.  \n \n73.  A further risk is that the allocation of electrification kits may be influenced by corruption. \nThe Project protects against this risk by requiring a transparent procedure to establish objective \nallocation criteria for the kits. It also establishes a grievance, complaints and dispute resolution \nmechanism for customers receiving kits.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n74.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MEW have given the \nfollowing assurances that will be incorporated in the loan agreement. \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement, and Indigenous People  \n75.  The Government will update the agreed resettlement plan based upon a final detailed \ndesign and detailed measurement and surveys, and it will be subject to approval by ADB, and \ndisclosed to affected people. The Government will ensure that all land and rights-of-way are \nmade available to the Contractor and that any land acquisition and resettlement activities are ", "18   \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations;  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995); and the updated resettlement plan.  \n \n76.  By the award of the civil works contracts, the Government will ensure that a Fund for \nSocial Development of Women and Ethnic Minorities is established and maintained with the \nfinancial resources allocated in the budget for the Project from which to finance the mitigation of \nany negative impacts upon women, minorities and indigenous people from the Project. \n \n2.  Environmental \n77.  The Government will ensure that the preparation, design, construction, implementation \nand  operation  of  the  Project  complies  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations;  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Policy (2002); and all monitoring and mitigation measures in the IEE.  MEW will \nensure that quarterly progress reports on all matters in the EMMP will be forwarded to ADB. The \nGovernment will ensure that contracts with all civil works contractors include provisions that \nrequire the contractors to comply with the EMMP, and to notify MEW (copied to ADB) in writing \nof any environmental issues that are not covered by the EMMP and IEE. \n   \n3.  Financial \n78.  Within 9 months of the Effective Date, the Government will refine its disconnection and \nanti-theft  policy,  including  conditions  of  disconnection,  to  eliminate  non-payment,  start  a \ncustomer awareness campaign, and to develop procedure for survey and inventory of meters to \ndetermine whether the meters are fully operational. Within 12 months of the Effective Date, the \nGovernment will have caused DABM to commence implementation of the disconnection and \nanti-theft policy. \n \n79.  The Government will make an allocation in each annual budget, to ensure that accounts \nreceivables from government departments on time, so that DABM can maintain accounts \nreceivable for FY 2007, less than the preceding 6 months\u2019 equivalent of sales, and from 2008, \naccounts receivables less than the preceding 3 months\u2019 equivalent of sales.  \n \n4.  Institutional and Sector Restructuring \n80.  To ensure the Project\u2019s medium term viability, within 12 months of the Effective Date, the \nGovernment will develop, in a transparent participatory manner that, to the satisfaction of ADB, \na form of regulation by contract for the distribution and transmission of electricity. \n \n81.  The  Government  agrees  to  reflect  certain  priorities  and  principles  in  sector  and \ninstitutional reform, including ensuring autonomy and independence of DABM, establishing an \nindependent board (at least 25% non-government representative), specifying the policy and \nplanning role of MEW; and the operational role of DABM.  \n \n82.  Within 6 months of the Effective Date, the Government will establish fair allocation \ncriteria  for  electrification  kits,  acceptable  to  ADB  and  allocate  the  kits  accordingly.  The \nGovernment will establish an independent complaint mechanism acceptable to ADB, to address \ncomplaints from stakeholders relating to the allocation of electrification kits. \n ", "    19 \n5.  Security  \n83.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contracts  contain  requirements  to \nprepare an action plan for adequate security for the smooth uninterrupted implementation of the \nProject; and to undertake demining and the cost of implementing such plan to be included in the \nbudget  for  such  civil  works;  and  such  plan  is  implemented.    Within  2  months  of  loan \neffectiveness, the Government will establish an interministerial steering committee for proper \ncoordination of security issues.  \n \n6.  Efficiency Improvements \n84.  MEW shall improve its effectiveness by implementing the PRR Program by:(a) 30 June \n2005, establish a skilled task force chaired by the Minister, MEW, to lead and manage the PRR \nProgram; and (b) by 31 December 2005, prepare a detailed proposal, specifying the expected \nefficiency improvements, cost savings, identification, and justification of the positions or tasks, to \nbe placed on the PRR Program pay scale with a full costing of the proposed changes.  \n \nB.  Conditions to Effectiveness \n85.   DABM has duly authorized, ratified, executed and delivered the Project Agreement and \nit has become legally binding upon DABM, subject to loan effectiveness; and the Government \nand DABM have duly authorized, ratified, executed and delivered the Subsidiary Financing \nAgreement, and it has become legally binding upon DABM and the Government, subject only to \nloan effectiveness. \nVII.

Power Sector \n1.  The power sector is one of the least developed sectors in Afghanistan, and it is the key \nbottleneck for economic development. Afghanistan is well endowed with hydropower, natural \ngas, and coal. Some estimates put hydropower potential at 25,000 megawatts (MW), of which \n5,000 MW are inside Afghanistan and the rest on the border of Amu Darya.  Hydropower the \nkey sources (about 75% of total) of power supply in Afghanistan: the main dams are Kajakai in \nHelmand  Province  near  Kandahar,  Mahipar  and  Breshna-Kot  in  Nangarhar  Province  near \nJalalabad, and Dahla in Kandahar Province. Kabul is fed by three hydroelectric power stations, \nwith a combined output of 80 MW (nameplate rating of 188 MW).  \n \n2.  The total generation capacity has declined from about 456 MW in 1990s to about 250 \nMW. Only about 6\u20139% of the population has access to power, of whom approximately 30% are \nin Kabul. The other provinces have even less access, with rural areas being virtually unserved. \nBefore the conflict in 1980, power transmission lines comprised about 140 circuit-kilometers and \nabout 1,080 circuit-kilometers of 220 kilovolt (kV) and 110 kV transmission lines, respectively. \nMany were destroyed during the war and only some 110 kV are now operating. The damaged \n220 kV lines have been downgraded to operate at 110 kV while some damaged 110 kV lines \nnow operate at 35 kV.  \n \nB.  Demand Scenarios \n3.  Energy demand forecasts have been made by the ongoing studies on the power sector \nmaster plan (up to 2020) and the gas development master plan (up to 2025). The power \ndemand forecast is based on adjusted actual energy sales of 2002. Adjusted demand includes \nthe suppressed demand, which is around 75% of the energy supplied. In the basic forecast, \nenergy demand is assumed to reach 3,861 GWh in 2020, giving an average annual growth rate \nof 6.3%. In the high forecast, energy demand is assumed to reach 5,640 GWh in 2020, or 46% \nhigher than the basic forecast, implying an average growth rate of 8.2%.  \n \n4.  The present peak load is assumed around 215 MW for all of Afghanistan. Adding a \nsuppressed demand assumed to be 138 MW, the peak load starting point for the forecasts is \n363 MW. In the basic forecast, the peak load is assumed to increase to 911 MW in 2020. This \ngives an average annual growth rate of 5.2%. The growth rate for the peak load is somewhat \nlower than the growth rate for energy demand since the load factor is assumed to increase \nduring the forecast period. In the high forecast the peak load is assumed to increase to 1,316 \nMW in 2020. This gives an average annual growth rate of 7.4%. \n \nC.  Supply Options \n1.  Business as Usual \n5.  Business  as  usual  assumes  that  the  existing  practices  of  energy  development  will \ncontinue without any changes in strategy. Development of known hydropower, natural gas, oil, \n ", "Appendix 2  23 \nand coal reserves will continue; indigenous hydropower, natural gas, and coal will be used for \npower generation; no program on energy conservation will be initiated; and development and \nmanagement  of  biomass  fuels  will  continue  without  any  linkages  with  commercial  energy \ndevelopment program. The gap between projected demand and indigenous supply can only be \nreduced with serious exploration program; else the gap will have to be met from imported \nsources.  \n \n2.  Reference Option \n6.  Additional  issues  included  in  reference  option  are  (i)  enhancement  of  exploration, \nappraisal, and extraction of indigenous nonrenewable energy resources; (ii) implementation of \neffective programs to conserve energy; and (iii) integration of commercial energy and biomass \nfuels program to maintain sustainable supply of biomass fuels. Exploration and appraisal of oil \nand  natural  gas  will  be  enhanced;  development  of  hydropower,  natural  gas,  and  coal  will \ncontinue; new and renewable energy sources will be harnessed; a program will be undertaken \nto conserve commercial energy and biomass fuels; and development of biomass fuels will be \nconsidered along with the development of commercial energy sources. \n \n7.  A business-as-usual scenario would put a strain on the economy with a sharp increase \nin energy demand. It would require additional fuel because of a lack of energy conservation \nmeasures,  and  may  cause  severe  environmental  degradation  due  to  overexploitation  of \nbiomass fuels. The analysis used the reference option.  \n \n8.  The  Government\u2019s  power  sector  master  plan  estimates  over  $1.5  billion  for  the \nrecommended generation and transmission development plan up to 2020, whereas, the World \nBank estimates a requirement of about $1.9 billion on generation and transmission alone for the \nnext 7 years. Distribution will require another $800 million, as per the master plan.  \n \nD.  Sector Road Map and Sustainability \n9.  The Government has developed a detailed road map for the power sector (Table A2.1). \nIn  the  preparatory  phase,  focus  will  be  on  capacity  building,  improvement  of  billing  and \ncollection, theft control, and development of a master plan. So far the Government has met its \ntargets. In the medium term (2005\u20132007) the focus will be on developing a power sector law, \nestablishing independent regulation, separating generation from distribution; commercializing \nKabul Distribution Company, and finalizing key transmission infrastructure. The longer-term \ntarget is establishment of national transmission grid and increase access to 75% of households. \n \n10.  The power sector\u2019s ability to provide sustainable economic and social benefits will need \nreliable infrastructure (investment in power generation, transmission, and distribution); capable \ninstitutions; and appropriate cost recovery. While in other countries investment in infrastructure \nis not an essential precondition for sustainability, without investments, the power sector of \nAfghanistan  will  not  be  able  to  deliver  basic  services  to  existing  consumers.  Table  A2.2 \nsummarizes  the  initiative  by  the  Government  and  other  donors  to  ensure  the  overall \nsustainability of the power sector. \n ", " \n2\n  4\n \n \nTABLE A2.1: AFGHANISTAN POWER SECTOR ROAD MAP    \n \n \n   A\np\n  p\ne\nPhase  Preparatory Phase  Intermediate Phase  Long-term Phase  Results  n\nd\nActivities  2003 to 2004  2005 to 2007  2008 to 2010  ix\n 2\n(cid:131) New constitution enacted  (cid:131) Power sector law enacted    (cid:131) Comprehensive        \n(cid:131) National economic legislation  (cid:131) Law and regulations  power sector   \nLegislation \ncompleted.   completed and implemented  regulation is \n(cid:131) MWP policy framework approved  functional. \n(cid:131) Power sector law prepared \n(cid:131) Capacity building in MWP on  (cid:131) Independent regulatory  (cid:131) Independent  (cid:131) The regulatory \nregulation functions  agency created  regulatory agency fully  agency is operating \nRegulator  (cid:131) MWP continues to adjust tariffs in  operational  independently. \nKabul to cost-recovering levels \n(cid:131)  Study on future industry structure \ncompleted \n(cid:131) Basic commercialization activities  (cid:131) Separate generation and  (cid:131) Generation and  (cid:131) Distribution and \nundertaken   distribution companies  distribution companies  generation \n(cid:131) Billing and collection  established according to the  ready for deeper  companies provide \nUtility \n(cid:131) Accounting systems  policy framework   private sector  efficient and reliable \n(cid:131) Cost of service analysis    participation  power with private \nOperation \n(cid:131) Metering and connections  (cid:131) KDC created and a    sector participation. \n(cid:131) Theft control  management contract  (cid:131) The Government \n(cid:131) New connections  awarded  has a subsidiary \n  role in the sector. \n(cid:131) Master plan for power sector  (cid:131) Hairitan\u2013Kabul transmission  (cid:131) KDC connected  (cid:131) 40% access is \ncompleted  line constructed  200,000 new  achieved (from 4\u2013\n(cid:131) Reconstruction projects are completed  (cid:131) IDA and soft loans finance  customers  6% today). \n(ADB, KfW, WB)   new projects in KDC  (cid:131) New generation  (cid:131) Overall system \n(cid:131) Study/plan for Kabul and major  (200,000 new customers  installed in the order of  losses from are \nprovincial cities distribution network  connected)  200 MW  reduced from 40\u2013\nPhysical \ncompleted  (cid:131) MEW constructs new  (cid:131) Electricity reaches  50% to 20\u201330%. \n(cid:131) Key feasibility studies initiated  distribution projects around  75% of all districts \nInfrastructure \n(cid:131) Implementation of urgent priority  the country (200,000 new  (cid:131) Backbone of national \nprojects according to master plan  customers connected)  transmission grid \ninitiated  (cid:131) Master plan priority  constructed \n(cid:131) Study on options to expand rural  generation and transmission \naccess  projects initiated \n(cid:131) Rural electrification program \nimplemented \nSource: World Bank 2004, Report No. T762-AFG, Appendix 2. \n ", " \n \n \nTable A2.2: Sustainability of Afghanistan\u2019s Power Sector \n \n \nDrivers  Existing Condition  Medium-term Scenario  \n(activities by donors and Government) \n1.

The power sector in Afghanistan has received considerable external financing from a \nnumber of aid agencies, including the World Bank, United States Agency for International \nDevelopment  (USAID),  German  Development  Cooperation  (KfW),  (GTZ),  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).  \nA.  The World Bank   \n \n2.  Under  the  Emergency  Infrastructure  Reconstruction  Project,  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nInternational Development Association (IDA) provided a $15.5 million power component which \nincludes distribution materials for Kabul and six provincial cities, supply of essential tools and \nequipment, the recommissioning of the northwest Kabul gas turbine plant and fuel, installation of \nspare parts for the 4x25 megawatt (MW) Naghlu hydropower station, and technical assistance \n(TA) for updating the power sector master plan. In January 2003, the 45 MW northwest Kabul \nplant was recommissioned, almost doubling the available capacity for Kabul during the peak \nwinter hours. This project is scheduled for completion in 2005. \n \n3.  In June 2004, IDA approved a new $200-million project (of which IDA funding is $100 \nmillion) which would finance investments in distribution and generation in addition to substantial \nTA to commercialize the operations of Afghanistan Electricity Authority (DABM) The project will \nsupport  the  overall  reform  of  the  sector  but  will  focus  largely  on  distribution.    It  will  help \nreorganize the utility on a commercial basis while addressing the sector\u2019s enormous investment \nneeds. The project will help finance the rehabilitation and expansion of distribution networks in \nKabul  and  several  other  cities  and  will  provide  support  to  improve  the  commercial  and \nmanagement aspects of DABM.   \n \nB.  German Development Cooperation \n \n4.  KfW is implementing four projects with funding from Germany, European Commission, \nand Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) for a total of \u20ac46.65 million.  The first \nproject is the rehabilitation of Kabul Region Electric Grid (phase 1) for \u20ac16.1 million. This project \ninvolved (i) a street-lighting component, (ii) rehabilitation of the 110 kilovolt (kV) transmission \nline from Sarobi to Breshna Kot, (iii) the 15(20) kV overhead lines (Breshna Kot to Junctions I \nand  III),  (iv)  rehabilitation  of  the  Breshna  Kot  substation,  and  (v)  the  rehabilitation  of  the \nmedium-  and  low-voltage  distribution  network.    The  second  project  is  phase  2  of  the \nrehabilitation of Kabul Region Electric Grid (KfW Mandate from the European Commission) for a \ntotal of \u20ac9 million.  This involves four lots technically similar to the first phase: street lighting, 110 \nkilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  from  Breshna  Kot  to  Kabul  east,  substations  Breshna  Kot \n(extension) and Kabul east (reconstruction), and medium- and low-voltage distribution network.  \nThis project is scheduled for completion 2004.  \n \n5.  The third project involves the rehabilitation of the Mahipar and Sarobi hydropower plants, \nwhich serve Kabul for a total of \u20ac15 million. The supply and erection contract will come into \nforce in December 2003. The work will go on during 2004, with work on the second Sarobi unit \nextending to 2005. The fourth committed project is a KfW Mandate from ARTF for \u20ac6.55 million \n($7.4 million) to complete some of the above projects: hydropower plant rehabilitation, city \ndistribution network, and 110 kV transmission lines.  On the technical assistance side, KfW has \nseconded a long-term adviser to the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW).  GTZ has seconded ", "Appendix 3  27 \na  long-term  adviser  to  build  capacity  in  the  power  utility,  DABM,  specifically  in  the  Kabul \nElectricity Department. \n \nC.  USAID \n \n6.  USAID  is  providing  technical  assistance  to  MEW  under  the  Economic  Governance \nProject,  which  covers  institutional  strengthening  and  restructuring  of  MEW,  design  of  a \nregulatory framework and new sector law, and includes the funding of a resident advisor.  The \nGovernment of the United States is providing approximately $80.0 million as part of the $1.2 \nbillion funding package for Afghanistan Relief and Reconstruction over the next year. The \ncritical USAID interventions in the sector include provision of fuel supplies for Kabul, Jalalabad, \nand Kandahar. USAID is committed to finance rehabilitation of the power generation stations in \nKajakai and Darunta, and the power generation plant near Kabul.  \n \nD.  Government of Iran \n \n7.  Iran provided some bilateral assistance to the power sector. The completed projects \ninclude low-voltage transmission lines from Iran to Zaranj in Nimroz Province and from Iran to \nHerat at an estimated cost of $2.5 million, and the construction of a high-voltage transmission \nline from Iran to Herat at an estimated cost of $14.0 million.  \n \nE.  Government of India \n \n11.  The Government of India has actively supported the power sector. Recently a team \nsuccessfully completed the design and survey of Kabul to the Pul-e-Khumri line through the \nSilang bypass.  ", "28  Appendix 4   \nJUSTIFICATION FOR SPECIAL LOAN TERMS AND ADF GRANT \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  Afghanistan has made significant progress since the ouster of the Taliban regime. The \nGovernment has implemented a wide range of structural reforms and adhered to almost all \nquantitative indicators and structural benchmarks under the Staff-Monitored Program, led by the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  Notwithstanding  these  achievements  and  double-digit \neconomic growth over the last 2 years, the country is economically and fiscally fragile. Security, \neconomic, social, and administrative challenges are formidable. The country continues to need \nexternal development finance that does not fiscally burden the nascent administration.  \n \n1.  Debt Sustainability \n \n2.  At  the  Berlin  Donor  Conference  in  March  2004,  the  Government  presented  its \ndevelopment strategy\u2014Securing Afghanistan's Future: Accomplishments and the Strategic Path \nForward.  The  strategy  argues  that  an  average  of  9%  growth  per  annum  of  the  nondrug \neconomy: 10\u201315% in the short term and 7-9% in the long term) is needed visibly improve \neconomic and social conditions while gradually eliminating the drug economy. Total financing of \n$31.8 billion is needed until 2010 to raise Afghanistan to an annual per capita gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) of about $500 by 2015, including an external financing requirement of $27.6 \nbillion over 7 years. Substantial continued external funding agencies assistance will be required \nfor the recurrent budget over the medium term. Recurrent expenditures for FY2005 amount to \n$609 million while revenues are expected to amount to about $256 million, which means that \nalmost 60% of recurrent expenditures will have to be financed by foreign assistance. The capital \nand development budget for FY2005 of $4,068 million is to be financed entirely by external \nfunding  agencies.  In  a  recent  report,  IMF  expressed  serious  concern  about  the  fiscal \nsustainability  of  the  Government  payroll  and  security  expenditures  and  highlighted  the \nimportance of continued external funding agencies\u2019 assistance.  \n \n  2.  Government and External Funding Agencies\u2019 Strategies \n \n3.  The high growth rates since the end of the conflict have been fuelled primarily by external \nfunding agencies-supported relief and construction activities as well as by the temporary end to \nthe drought. However, to achieve growth targets over the medium term and to gradually replace \nopium production, the Government must aim for broad-based and sustainable development and \nidentify new drivers of growth. Investment in the power sector is a prerequisite for sustained \neconomic growth, and grants will greatly help accelerate this transition. \n \n4.  The  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  is  a  central  instrument  of  the  international \ncommunity for reducing poverty in the Asia and Pacific region. ADF represents an effective \npartnership between the international community, Asian Development Bank, and ADF client \ncountries.  The  ADF  IX  replenishment  features  a  new  grant  program.  The  external  funding \nagencies  agreed  that  the  concessional  assistance  could  be  used  to  help  poor  countries \naccelerate  their  transition  from  post-conflict  situations  to  peace  and  stability.  Afghanistan\u2019s \ncondition clearly qualifies it for grant funding. Prolonged conflict has endangered the poor, \ndestroyed their economic opportunities, damaged basic infrastructure, and disrupted delivery of \nbasic services to the neediest. Access to a reliable power source is a prerequisite for sustained \neconomic growth, and grants can accelerate such growth. The Project will increase access to \npower by rehabilitating distribution systems and providing electrification kits. \n ", "Appendix  4  29   \n \n \n3.  Project Intervention:  Sustainable Post Conflict Ground \n \n5.  The social and poverty survey noted that the average cost of connection per household \nis $31, including the line from the distribution network to the household and the tariff meter. \nAlthough the survey noted that people were willing to pay, the beneficiaries will probably not be \nable to afford such a high one-time connection and the internal wiring costs for lighting and \npower points. Internal wiring must be done properly to mitigate fire hazards.  \n \n6.  The  Project  will  distribute  approximately  18,000  electrification  kits  costing  about \n$740,000.1 The kits will include a standard meter, two compact fluorescent lights, and a double \npower point, which can be used for small appliances such as radios, fans, etc. Wiring, sockets, \nand power points are necessary to use the electricity. \n \n7.  It is difficult to determine selection criteria by physical household characteristic (most \nhouses  look  the  same  and  access  by  strangers  is  problematic  and  time-consuming),  land \nownership (no credible records exist), or income (variable by season and not well understood by \nstakeholders themselves). Beneficiaries will be advised that connection kits are available and \nwill be at cost charged through tariff. The kits will allow immediate connection. If this approach \n(as a pilot) is successful, assistance may provide more kits. \n \n8.  Should  demand  for  connection  kits  exceed  supply,  preference  should  be  given  to \nhouseholds with children, since the most immediate benefit of electrification is lighting, which \nhelps children studying at home. Should further criteria be required, it is suggested that female-\nheaded  households  and  similarly  socially  disadvantaged  households  (ethnic  minorities, \nphysically disabled, etc.) be selected with assistance from local leaders. Detailed selection \ncriteria will be developed by the implementation consultants in consultation with the Government \nand other stakeholders. \n \n9.  Installation by the turnkey contractor should take advantage of Afghanistan Electricity \nAuthority (DABM) staff and other local labor, and will include basic instructions on safe use of \nelectricity.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Estimate based on supply of 18,000 kits at $41 per kit.

Financial Position \n \n1.  Profitability. The financial accounts of the Afghanistan Electricity Authority (DABM) \nbefore 2001 were destroyed during the war, and only the last 2 years\u2019 profit-and-loss accounts \nare available. Adjustments are needed because assets and depreciation costs have not been \ncaptured correctly. After preliminary adjustments,1 the revised DABM loss as of 20 March 2004 \nwould amount to AF1,300 million (about $30 million)\u2014more than 10 times the reported loss of \nAF63.8  million  (about  $1.4  million).  This  discrepancy  results  from  depreciation  based  on \nvaluation of assets and bad-debt provisions. Current low depreciation will inflate taxable income \nwhen the cash flow is positive. A proper asset register is urgently required to know DABM\u2019s \nfinancial position. \n \n2.  DABM\u2019s financial position has improved marginally despite revision of tariff rates by \nmore than 100% in March 2003. Revenues increased by 88% but most profit has been wiped \nout by the operation of costly Kabul northwest gas turbine power plant. The fuel cost alone is 12 \ncents/kWh,  which  is  much  higher  than  DABM\u2019s  average  tariff  of  3.5  cents/kWh.  High \ntransmission and distribution losses of 35\u201340% have increased generation and power purchase \ncosts, and shortage of power has further reduced revenue. The overall cost recovery as of 20 \nMarch 2004 is estimated at only 51%, with overall average tariff of 3.5 cents/kWh and average \ncost of supply of 7.0 cents/kWh.  \n3.  Tariff. DABM has a location-specific tariff, with no uniform national tariff. These tariff \nrates vary widely depending on the source of power. Hydro-based Kabul and Kandahar have an \naverage domestic tariff of around 2 cents/kWh, while Mazar-e-Sharif and Herat, which rely on \nimported  energy  and  diesel  generation,  have  tariffs  more  than  twice  and  four  times, \nrespectively.  Tariffs  have  three  customer  categories:  domestic,  governmental,  and  other,2 \nallowing cross-subsidization for domestic customers. In Kabul, domestic tariffs are divided into \nthree brackets depending on consumption, but most domestic customers are in the lowest \nconsumption bracket of below 600 kWh per 2 months. \n4.  Cash Flow. DABM manages cash shortage resulting from spare parts and fuel costs of \nKabul northwest gas turbine power plant funded by the World Bank and United States Agency \nfor International Development (USAID). Investment funds have been heavily dependent on \nGovernment support through donor communities. Until FY2003, even salaries of DABM staff \nwere paid from the MEW budget. The cash collection rate is about only 60\u201370%. Billing and \ncollection are based either on customers\u2019 own readings or on bimonthly meter readings by a \nlimited number of meter readers. The German Development Cooperation through GTZ and \nUSAID have supported pilot programs to improve billing and collection efficiency of DABM.  \n                                                 \n1 Depreciation cost for FY2004 at DABM was AF897, 000 (approximately $20,000). For a realistic opening balance, \nthe depreciated replacement cost method was used for valuation of existing fixed assets. The following key \nassumptions were used: (i) for distribution and generation, the asset\u2019s age assumed was to be 30 years;  (ii) out-of-\nservice assets have been assigned zero value; (iii) buildings, vehicles, spares, etc. are assumed to be fully \ndepreciated; and (iv) meters are assumed to be paid for and owned by customers (assigned zero value). \n2 Government customers include ministries and other central and provincial administrative authorities, schools, \nhospitals, jails, military installations, and commercial activities owned or controlled by the Government, such as \nhotels, etc. Other customers are mostly commercial establishments, industry, shops, etc. ", "Appendix 10  37 \n \nB.  Financial Performance Improvement \n \n5.  Four key drivers would quickly improve DABM\u2019s financial performance: expansion of \ncapacity to meet increasing demand; efficiency improvement in generation, transmission, and \ndistribution; improvement of billing and collection system; and tariff increase to improve cost \nrecovery.  \n6.  Capacity. Alternative, cheaper power must be generated or imported, and transmission \nand distribution capacity must be expanded and rehabilitated to meet demand. Rehabilitation of \nhydro power plants is expected to increase capacity but will not be enough to meet growing \ndemand for electricity. Full operation of the trunk transmission line from Termez via Pul-e-\nKhumri to Kabul is expected to enable MEW and DABM to import power from neighboring \ncountries to meet demand in the northern and eastern regions. \n7.  Efficiency. The operational efficiency of the generation, transmission, and distribution \nnetwork needs to be improved immediately. High losses, suboptimal dispatch, and expensive \ndiesel generation are the key contributors to the high cost of supply. \n8.  Billing and Collection. DABM\u2019s uncollected revenues (around AF1,300 million or $30 \nmillion as of the end of October 2004) are mostly owed by Government sector customers (e.g., \nministries,  jails,  the  military,  police,  etc).  To  enable  DABM  to  recover  its  arrears3  and \nconsistently collect the billed amounts, the  Government will make a budget appropriation to \nensure timely payment so that, from 20 March 2007 onward, DABM can maintain accounts \nreceivable from all customers equivalent to less than the preceding 3 months\u2019 of sales. The \nGovernment will issue a policy against theft and on disconnection, and DABM will be vigilant in \norder to minimize nontechnical losses. \n9.  Cost Recovery.  The rationalization of tariff to meet full cost recovery must consider \nsocial impacts on customers who consume the least (55% of total consumers in Kabul), adverse \nenvironmental impacts of using alternative energy with pollution risks, and operational and \nfinancial sustainability of DABM. Ongoing and future rehabilitation and reconstruction of hydro \nplants and the increase of inexpensive power imports are expected to gradually improve the \ncost recovery of DABM, and that the transmission line from Uzbekistan to Kabul can largely \nrelease suppressed demand around the northern and eastern regions and cause a financial \nturnaround. However, an indicative financial projection of DABM (Table A10) suggests that \nDABM should increase Kabul-based tariff4 by 10% annually for the next 3 to 4 years so that \nDABM can maintain full cost recovery after the turnaround, retain enough free cash flow to carry \nout its operations and self-financing investments, and obtain long-run financial sustainability \n(Supplementary Appendix F presents a detailed financial projection of DABM).  \n                                                 \n3 By 30 June 2005, the Government and DABM will finalize a settlement scheme for overdue amounts for FY2005 \nfrom Government departments and enterprises.  \n4  As of 20 March 2004, the average domestic tariff in Kabul (including Nangarhar, Parwan, Ghori [except Kunduz], \nand Kandahar) was around AF1.0/kWh (2 cents/kWh). Assuming 10\u201320% annual increases on that tariff for 3 \nyears from FY2006, the required domestic tariff would be AF1.3\u20131.8/kWh in nominal terms.

In case MEW and DABM cannot implement planned investment projects and power \nimports  on  time,  and  fail  to  improve  billing  and  collection  as  well  as  cost  recovery,  the \nGovernment may be required to continue sizable financial support to DABM. \nC.  Financial Management \n \n11.  Accounting. DABM\u2019s accounting system is manual, on a cash basis, so processing is \nslow and accounting records are erroneous. The records of assets (e.g., fixed assets and \ninventories) have not been maintained on time or correctly. Historical records are lacking. As a \nresult, the depreciation charges in income statements seem too low. Since MEW manages \ninvestment  and  construction,  and  DABM  conducts  operation  and  maintenance  only  after \ncompletion of facilities, the separation of responsibilities may lead to misrepresentation of \naccounting information. Government received technical assistance from the World Bank5 for \nreconstruction of the asset registers, development of proper financial statements, accounting \naudit and installation accounting system and financial management.  \n12.  Financial  Autonomy. Government\u2019s financial assistance to the power sector (e.g., \ninvestment and partial fuel cost) has sustained DABM\u2019s operations and finance, DABM has little \nincentive for cost cutting and efficiency improvement, as responsibilities are shared with MEW. \nCredit control and inventory management are almost nonexistent in DABM. Separation of policy \n(MEW) and operation (DABM) roles are pre-requisite for improving autonomy An independent \nboard, appropriate license and a charter for its operation are immediate priority. \n                                                 \n5 Emergency Power Rehabilitation Project, approved in May 2004.  ", "Appendix 11  39 \nENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction  \n \n1.   The Project\u2019s initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out by the Ministry of Energy \nand Water (MEW), the Executing Agency. The Project is classified under environment category B. \nThe IEE involved analysis of data collected through review of reports, maps, etc.; discussions with \ninterested parties; and field visits to proposed project areas. \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Physical Resources \n \n2.  In the north, the transmission line routes traverse the fertile floodplains of the Kunduz and \nAmudaryu rivers (<300 meters [m] elevation) and their adjacent hinterland comprising a rolling, loess-\ncovered piedmont plain (300\u2013400 m elevation). In the central eastern area, the routes traverse alpine \nareas  comprising  deeply  dissected  mountains  (1,800\u20134,700  m  above  sea  level  [asl])  and \nintermountain basins (500\u20131,800 m asl).  \n \n3..  The  northern  area  consists  mainly  of  quaternary  conglomerates,  sand,  and  loess,  with \nscattered inliers of tertiary limestone overlain by thick (5\u201320 m) and generally fertile, sandy soils. The \ncentral eastern region comprises tertiary sedimentary rocks and volcanic overlying Mesozoic and \nPaleozoic sandstones, limestone, and schist. Mountainous areas of the central eastern region have \nthin soils (0.5\u20135.0 m) of rubble and sandy loam. Low-lying areas of the plateau have thicker soils of \nloam and sandy loam, or sand and gravel in the case of river valleys. The region is seismically active, \nwith a history of strong earthquakes. \n \n4.  The project areas have a dry continental climate, with four distinct seasons and wide annual \nand daily temperature fluctuations, which varies according to elevation. Rainfall is greatest in winter \nand spring. Summers are typically hot and dry and winters are cool or cold depending on elevation. \nWater resources in the northern area are generally plentiful due to the proximity and reliable perennial \nflows of Amudaryu and Kunduz rivers. The Kabul River and its tributaries drain the central eastern \nregion, with their flows derived entirely from rainfall and seasonal snow melt of the surrounding \nmountains. Surface water is limited, with peak flows in spring, and sporadic or nonexistent flows in \nmany watercourses in summer. \n \n2.  Ecological Resources \n \n5.  In the north, natural vegetation consists of grasses that dry out in summer, and sparse shrubs. \nArable lands along the bottoms of basins and valleys are cultivated with grain (wheat, rice) and \nvegetables. Orchards and vineyards occur near the towns. Woody plants at higher elevations in the \nnorth comprise sparse wild pistachio, almond, and juniper woodland with tree heights of 4\u201310 m. \nBottomlands of the Amudaryu River contain riparian forests consisting of dense thickets of reeds and \nshrubs as well as timber stands of elm or wild olive and poplar 5\u201312 m tall. The Amudaryu River area \nis home to the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), wild boar, and the endangered Bactrian deer (Cervus \nelaphus bactrianus) as well as waterbirds and birds of prey. \n \n6.  In the central eastern region, natural vegetation in the valleys and intermountain basins \nconsists of drought-resistant grasses (sagebrush, needle grass) with patches of sparse shrubs with ", "40  Appendix 11 \noccasional juniper and wild pistachio. In the mountains around Charikar and Bamyan, vegetation \ncomprises mixed grass meadows, which die off during late summer. South and east of Kabul, the \ntransmission line alignments generally traverse arid areas of minimal natural vegetation. Arable lands \nin the basins and valleys are cultivated with wheat, corn, beans, and other vegetables. Orchards and \nvineyards occur near the towns. \n \n7.  Small-scale industries exist in the main centers, primarily producing goods for domestic \nconsumption\u2014i.e. wheat, flour, bread, meat, preserved fruits, sugar, salt, plastic bags, toilet paper, \netc. Natural gas has been a valuable export commodity in the past, and potential exists for further \nexploitation, including mineral deposits such as iron, barites, talc, mica, copper, and semiprecious \nstones. Some small- to medium-scale manufacturing enterprises exist, such as leather working and \ncarpet making.  During the years of conflict, opium poppy has increasingly replaced wheat as the \nmost significant autumn-sown cash crop in the southwest and eastern provinces. \n \n3.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n8.  Screening of potential environmental impacts of the Project was based on ADB\u2019s Checklist of \nEnvironmental  Parameters  for  Power  Transmission  Lines  Projects.  No  significant  environmental \neffects will result from this project.  In addition, land acquisition and resettlement will be minimized by \navoiding settlements and buildings and minimizing the need to acquire agricultural land. The Project \nwill not encroach upon precious ecological areas or block wildlife passages.  It will generally traverse \narid areas of minimal vegetation or farmland along river valleys.  All transmission and distribution lines \nas well as substations have been designed to avoid ecologically sensitive areas.  \n \n9.  Minor  encroachment  into  farmland  along  some  sections  of  the  rehabilitated  and  new \ntransmission  lines,  due  to  the  location  of  towers  and  temporary  access  roads,  is  unavoidable. \nHowever, the Project will ensure that such impacts are minimized through careful route selection to \navoid siting towers on farmland wherever possible and making use of existing tower footings and \naccess roads. Farmers will be able to use agricultural land along the transmission line right-of-way. \nTrees along the right-of-way will need to be trimmed or removed to maintain a minimum vertical safe \nclearance between the conductors and the trees. Compensation will be paid for any loss of trees and \ntemporary and permanent loss of agricultural production during project implementation, in accordance \nwith the compensation policy outlined in the resettlement action plan. \n \n10.  Minor disruption to farming activities and disturbance of crops, bunds, canals and drains could \noccur during construction and line maintenance activities. To minimize such impacts, established \nroads and tracks will be used wherever possible, compensation will be paid for temporary loss in \nagricultural production in accordance with the resettlement action plan (RAP), topsoil will be protected \nand  reinstated  after  construction  is  completed,  damaged  bunds  and  irrigation  facilities  will  be \nreinstated after construction completed, and irrigation facilities will be maintained in working condition \nthroughout project implementation. \n \n11.  Uncontrolled soil erosion and silt run-off are likely to be minor due to the limited amount of \nexcavation required for towers and dry climate. In addition, measures to minimize erosion and silt run-\noff will be incorporated into contract documents. \n \n12.  Substations will be sited and designed to ensure that noise will not be a nuisance. Noise \ngenerated by construction activities will be of short duration in predominantly rural locations, and is \nconsidered  insignificant.  Other  nuisances  from  construction  activities  will  be  mitigated  through \ncontract clauses specifying careful construction practices and compensation paid for any losses in \nagricultural production. Escape of polluting materials such as oil and sewage from construction camps ", "Appendix 11  41 \nand substations will be prevented through design and installation of appropriate oil containment and \nsewerage systems.  \n \n13.  Health hazards from potential explosions or fire, electric shocks, and accidents to staff and the \ngeneral public will be mitigated during implementation by the following measures: careful designs \nusing appropriate technologies to minimize hazards; safety awareness raising for construction and \noperational staff and the public; substations equipped with modern fire control systems; provision of \nadequate water supply and sanitation facilities for substations and construction camps; provision of \nadequate staff training in operations and maintenance; and security fences and barriers around \nsubstations and transmission towers in populated areas.  \n \n14.  The limited environmental capability of MEW to manage and monitor implementation of the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP) for the Project will be strengthened through \ntraining of staff in environmental management and monitoring of power transmission projects, and the \nestablishment of environmental monitoring and audit protocols for use during all phases of project \nimplementation. \n \n4.  Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n \n15.  The EMMP and summary EMMP for the Project are in Tables A11.1 and A11.2. They \nidentify (i) potential environmental impacts that could occur during each project stage, (ii) \nproposed  mitigation  measures  to  address  each  impact,  (iii)  authority  responsible  for \nimplementing  mitigation  measures,  (iv)  summary  of  monitoring  tasks  to  ensure  mitigation \nmeasures have been implemented effectively during each stage of the project, and (v) schedule \nand responsibility for monitoring. \n \nTable A11.1: Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan \n \nProject Activity  Potential  Proposed Mitigation Measure  Institutional  Implementati\nImpact  Responsibility  on Schedule \nLocation and Design (Pre-Construction) Phase \nInvoluntary  Social  \u2022  Careful route selection to avoid  MEW  Part of \nresettlement or  inequities   existing settlements  detailed \nland acquisition   \u2022  Minimize need to acquire agricultural  alignment \nland  survey and \n\u2022  Compensation paid for temporary or  design \npermanent loss of productive land as \nspecified in the RAP.  \nEncroachment  Loss of  \u2022  Use existing tower footings and  MEW and  Part of \ninto farmland  agricultural  towers wherever possible  contractor  detailed \nproductivity  \u2022  Avoid siting new towers on farmland  alignment \nwherever feasible   survey and \n\u2022  Farmers compensated for any  design \npermanent loss of productive land \n\u2022  Farmers and landowners \ncompensated for significant trees that \nneed to be trimmed or removed along \nthe right-of-way \nNoise impacts  Nuisance to  \u2022  Substations sited and designed to  MEW and  Part of \nneighboring  ensure noise will not be a nuisance.  contractor  detailed \nproperties  alignment \nsurvey and \ndesign \nInterference with  Flooding  \u2022  Appropriate siting of towers to avoid  MEW and  Part of \ndrainage patterns  hazards, loss  channel interference  contractor  detailed ", "42  Appendix 11 \nProject Activity  Potential  Proposed Mitigation Measure  Institutional  Implementati\nImpact  Responsibility  on Schedule \nand irrigation  of agricultural  alignment \nchannels  production  survey and \ndesign \nEscape of  Environmental  \u2022  Transformers designed with oil spill  MEW and  Part of \npolluting  pollution   containment systems, and purpose- contractor  detailed \nmaterials  built oil, lubricant and fuel storage  alignment \nsystem, complete with spill cleanup  survey and \nequipment  design \n\u2022  Substations to include drainage and \nsewage disposal systems to avoid \noffsite land and water pollution \nExplosions or fire  Hazards to life  \u2022  Design of substations to include  MEW and  Part of \nand limb  modern fire control systems. firewalls.  contractor  detailed \n\u2022   Provision of fire fighting equipment to  alignment \nbe located close to transformers.  survey and \ndesign \nConstruction Phase \nEncroachment  Loss of  \u2022  Use existing access roads wherever  Contractor  Construction \ninto farmland  agricultural  possible  (contract  period \nproductivity  \u2022  Compensation for temporary loss in  requirements) \nagricultural production \n\u2022  Protect and preserve topsoil and \nreinstate after construction completed  \n\u2022  Repair damaged bunds etc. after \nconstruction is completed \n\u2022  Ensure existing irrigation facilities are \nmaintained in working condition \n\u2022  Damaged bunds of wheat and paddy \nfields to be reinstated after \ncompletion of construction  \nUncontrolled  Soil loss and  \u2022  Need for access tracks minimized,  Contractor  Construction \nerosion or silt  downstream  use of existing roads.

Participants did not see any negative environmental or social \nimpacts.  MEW  is  designing  newsletters,  issuing  press  releases,  conducting  TV  interviews,  and \nmaintaining a  web page and has recently recruited a media relations expert. In view of this, it is \nexpected that information regarding the Project will be similarly disseminated.  \n \n7.  Conclusions \n \n19.  The Project will not result in any significant environmental impacts, if recommended mitigation \nmeasures are properly implemented. The measures would be incorporated into contract documents \nand its implementation should be monitored during the entire Project. Training in environmental \nmanagement and monitoring should  be provided to MEW staff. The IEE, including the EMPP and \nmonitoring program, is considered sufficient to meet the environmental assessment requirements for \nthe Project. No further environmental assessment is required. ", "Appendix 12  45 \nPOVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n \n1.  A survey of about 1,100 households estimated that 2.88 million people are living in \npoverty (using the $1-a-day benchmark). The sample was 42% urban (i.e., living in, or within 10 \nkm of, a town or city) and 58% rural. Average daily per capita income across the sample was 39 \ncents per day (the same for male-headed households). Female-headed households (only 1% of \nthe sample) earned per capita 48 cents per day (although the average household income is \n20% lower for female-headed households, the survey also revealed that family size is two thirds \nthat of male-headed households, resulting in higher per capita income). Only 10% of the sample \nearns more than $1 per day per capita. \n \n2.  The average household size is 12.8 for male-headed households and 8.4 for female-\nheaded households. The high average household size is in part due to a high fertility rate of 6.8, \nbut  also  to  a  nonnuclear  family  structure,  with  one  household  often  comprising  three \ngenerations, more than one wife per married male, and married brothers and their families living \ntogether under the same roof.  The survey reveals that approximately 31% of female-headed \nhouseholds are concentrated in the lowest income quintile, with more male-headed households \nproportionate to female-headed households in the upper quintiles.  A large proportion (85.7%) of \nthe population reported owning their own homes, with only 8.5% renting their homes and 4.6% \nliving in their homes for free. Most dwellings are made of mud brick (95%).  \n \n3.  The survey concludes that populations in all project areas are growing, the situations of \nmost households are improving, and there is a healthy demand for electricity as well as the \nlighting and electrical appliances, all of which spells a significant increase in demand. Improved \nelectricity services could impact positively on the home-based business sector. No households \nenjoy a 24-hour supply. The average is 15 hours per day across the five grid-connected towns \n(which is why alternate forms of energy, particularly kerosene for lighting, are used pervasively). \nThe  average  is  far  lower  if  towns  using  a  community  or  village  generator  are  included. \nResidents in all towns desire supply 24-hours a day, and are willing to pay a connection fee to \nhave it. \n \n4.  Households using grid electricity, and those that do not are fairly evenly distributed \nacross the income quintiles. Use of grid electricity is therefore not so much determined by \nincome but by location: if electricity is available, it will be used, regardless of the users\u2019 income \nlevel. We can determine from patterns of expenditure on forms of energy that can be replaced \nby grid electricity that the poorest income quintile will not only be able to afford it but will also \nincrease their energy consumption without spending more. Each town has different income and \nexpenditure characteristics and electricity consumption. Pricing mechanisms for power will need \nto take these differences into consideration. \n ", "46  Appendix 12 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

No  national priority in country poverty    No \n  partnership agreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan:   \n \nRestoring electric power infrastructure is critical for the revival and resumption of economic activities, \nwhich would create jobs, generate income, and improve security and stability. The poor, who constitute the \nmajority of the population of Afghanistan, will benefit directly through job opportunities for unskilled and \nsemiskilled laborers during construction.  \n \nSpecific beneficiaries include the rural and urban poor, displaced populations, demobilized combatants, \nand  women.  Specifically,  the  benefits  will  be  directly  or  indirectly  attributable  to  different  project \ncomponents. The Project will (i) improve the quantity, quality, stability, safety, and environmental impact of \nelectricity supply; (ii) improve household quality of life; (iii) revive industries and establish new ones; (iv) \ncontribute to energy security and self-reliance; and (v) promote private sector activities, including those \nowned and operated by women.  \n \nPoor quality and unreliable power disproportionately burdens the poor because they are less able to resort \nto alternative sources of power and because their income sources are less diversified such that loss of one \nincome source may have larger impacts for the poor than for nonpoor households. On the other hand, a \nreliable supply of power attracts commercial and industrial activities, which may enable the poor to \ndiversify income sources with the increased availability of jobs. \n \n \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification:  General Intervention \n \nAfghanistan is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries: life expectancy at birth, 43 years (20 years lower than \nneighboring Tajikistan); child  malnutrition, 49%; access to an improved water source, 13%; access to \nimproved sanitation facilities, 12%; fertility rate, 6.8 live births per woman; malnourished population, 70%. \nNinety percent of the target population under this Project live below the $1-a-day threshold, and the lowest \nincome quintile spend half as much on energy as the highest quintile, but a much higher proportion of their \ntotal income (16% compared to 4%).  \n \nA  distribution  analysis  of  project  benefits  was  carried  out  for  the  project-affected  groups\u2014power \nproducers, unskilled labor, the Government, and electricity consumers. The poverty impact ratio (PIR) for \nthe different subprojects was computed in the range of 25% to over 100%. PIRs are all high primarily \nbecause an overwhelming proportion of electricity consumers in the target area are poor, and electricity \nconsumers are the main beneficiaries. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  There is no Poverty Partnership Agreement (PPA) with Afghanistan yet.

Yes                   No \n \nThe Project survey team and MEW staff surveyed over 1,100 households across the project regions and \nconducted town meetings in nine project towns. The meetings raised awareness about the Project and \nprovided important data as feedback for improving project design. Women are expected to be the main \nbeneficiaries from additional lighting and/or motive power for home-based income-generating activities and \nimproved indoor air quality.  The survey also established that although the main use of electricity was for \nhousehold lighting, people were willing to invest in other appliances to improve living conditions and \nlivelihood.   \n \n \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nMany women refused to participate in the survey and those who did participate often had scant knowledge \nof  household  income  and  expenditure.  Therefore,  enumerators  had  to  estimate  based  on  known \nconsumption. Most women in villages have no responsibility for \u201doutside the house\u201d activities such as \nshopping. Most women lack basic education and are reluctant to speak with \u201coutsiders.\u201d Many women \nrefused to give their names and did not know their age. However, women are expected to realize the \ngreatest  benefit  from  the  additional  lighting  and/or  motive  power  for  home-based  income-generating \nactivities and improved indoor air quality. The safety awareness campaign will ensure that information \nreaches women, as they spend most of their time in the family compound and will be the main users of \nelectricity.  \n \nA fund for social development of women and minorities will be established under the Project to mitigate \nany negative impacts. \n \nThe Government will work closely with the local community leaders in the project areas to ensure that men \nand  women are given equal opportunities to benefit from the Project.

Introduction and Description of Project \n \n1.   The scope of the Project will cover the region north of Hindu Kush mountain, the central \neastern region from the central Hindu Kush to Kabul and eastward, and the southern region.  \n \nB.  Analysis \n \n2.  The Project is classified under category B\u2014insignificant resettlement. Fewer than 200 \npeople are displaced from their houses, fewer than 200 people will lose less than 10% of their \nproductive assets (income generating), or 200 people or more will experience minor impacts.  \nLand acquisition is limited to moving back boundary walls in a few cases in the Imam Sahib \narea, compensation for small tracts (4 square meters) of agricultural land where towers are to \nbe sited in northern and eastern areas, and removal or trimming of trees in most distribution \nareas. There will be some temporary land acquisition during construction.  \n \n3.   The resettlement fieldwork and analysis was undertaken in Afghanistan during June-July \n2004. Some project areas were visited by the resettlement specialist, others by the social and \npoverty specialist, and the remainder (specifically in the south and east) by the domestic \nconsulting team (due to the security situation at that time). Further resettlement analysis will be \nrequired once detailed design is completed by the implementation consultant to record exact \nnumbers of affected persons and their entitlements. The scope and budget for this has been \nincluded in the terms of reference of the implementation consultant. \n  \n4.   Land acquisition and resettlement impacts were minimized through the following actions: \n(i) aligning any new transmission lines away from areas with high population density and by \navoiding agriculturally or culturally important areas; (ii) occupying wasteland and waste hills for \nalignment, where possible; (iii) using existing alignments and/or upgrading local distribution \nstructures, where possible; (iv) protecting water conservancy and irrigation facilities as far as \npossible. Consultations were held with local officials to minimize resettlement effects during the \nsetting of the alignment during the feasibility study. \n \nC.  Resettlement Plan \n \n5.   For people unavoidably affected by the Project, the resettlement objective is to ensure \nattainment of equal or better livelihoods and living standards in line with the Afghanistan Law on \nLand Acquisition and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement \n(1998). The law is supplemented by articles 14, 40, and 51 of the Afghanistan Constitution \n(2004). The Executing Agency will ensure that any people losing land, housing, or other assets \nand means of production will be helped to restore their incomes and living standards to at least \nthe levels without the Project's intervention. Assets will either be replaced or their owners \ncompensated at replacement cost. The total resettlement budget is $68,420. \n \n6.   Land compensation payments are calculated at current regional rates. Young crops that \ncannot be harvested before land acquisition are compensated at the average purchasing price \nper season of the crop compensation rate. Temporarily acquired land is paid the annual \naverage output value for each year of occupation. Topsoil is stored and then replaced in the \noriginal site at the end of occupation. The cost of restoring land to farmland will be paid by the \nProject; some payments can be made directly to the farmers for helping to restore these lands. \n ", "50  Appendix 13 \n \n7.   No houses will be lost as a result of this project.  However, some boundary walls will \nrequire shifting back and land adjoining roadside reserves acquired for the unimpeded erection \nof power poles. People losing such walls will receive direct compensation according to the type \nof  material.  Compensation  is  based  on  the  ground  area  and  material.  There  will  be no \ndepreciation of land values, and the project-affected people will be allowed to salvage materials \nfrom their former structures without deduction from their compensation. They can choose to \nconstruct their own structure, or to request that the township or village arrange this for them.  \nThe Project will have no impacts on private enterprises or commercial operations.  \n \n8.   The Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) and the Afghanistan Electricity Authority \n(DABM) offices will supervise the resettlement program with assistance from the implementation \nconsultant. DABM will be responsible for resettling people and for delegating activities to \ntownship officials and village committees affected by the Project. The township offices will sign \nland acquisition and resettlement agreements with project-affected villages and individuals, pay \ncompensation,  and  carry  out  the  daily  specific  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. \n \n9.   A short resettlement plan has been prepared.  Consultations have been held with the \nproject-affected people to obtain inputs on the design of the plan and to inform the project-\naffected people of ADB\u2019s policies regarding involuntary resettlement, and explain the proposed \nplan. The plan has been translated to Dari and Pushto and explained to project-affected people \nat community meetings in November and December 2004. After the detailed measurement \nsurvey  of  the  line  routes,  specific  project-affected  people  will  be  contacted  by  the \nimplementation consultants to explain the their rights under the plan and to inform them of the \ncompensation rates which will be based on the actual market rates at the time of the detailed \nmeasurement  survey.  A  system  has  also  been  designed  for  addressing  grievance  and \nregistering complaints.  It has three stages: (i) A project-affected person files a complaint about \ncompensation and unpaid losses with the village resettlement committee (VRC). The VRC is \nobliged to reply and explain the decision within 15 days from the date the complaint was \nreceived. (ii)  If the project-affected person is not satisfied or the VRC does not reply, the \ngrievance application will be forwarded to the district resettlement committee (DRC). The DRC \nmust decide within 15 days from the date the complaint was filed. (iii) If the project-affected \nperson is not satisfied with the decision or the DRC does not reply, the complaint can be \nforwarded to the committee on compensation, which will issue the final decision within 30 days. \nThe plan will be disclosed on the ADB website upon approval of the Project. \n \n10.   The  resettlement  plan  provides  for  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  specifies \nmethods for both. Afghanistan has limited capacity for internal resettlement supervision and \nmonitoring,  and  therefore  the  implementation  consultant\u2019s  team  includes  a  resettlement \nspecialist to build capacity within the MEW. MEW has agreed to the resettlement framework \nwith ADB, and is committed to ensuring the timely resettlement. MEW will engage an external \nmonitoring agency, such as a nongovernment organization, acceptable to ADB. The external \nmonitoring  agency  will  conduct  baseline  surveys,  investigate  resettlement  implementation \nprogress, and prepare monitoring and evaluation reports for submission to MEW and ADB every \n6 months. The scope of work for external monitoring is included in the resettlement framework. \nAfter resettlement, annual investigations will be carried out for 2 years to assess whether \nrehabilitation measures have fully restored incomes and livelihoods of all affected people. \nAnnual evaluation reports will be prepared by the external monitoring agency and submitted to \nMEW and ADB.  The full resettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix D.  ", "Appendix 14  51 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR \nCAPACITY BUILDING  \n \nA.   Objectives and Scope \n \n1.  The Government has initiated an innovative incentive based mechanism, the Priority \nReform  and  Restructuring  (PRR)  program,  to  fast-track  reform  in  the  public  sector  of \nAfghanistan, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the PRR process \nthrough the ongoing technical assistance (TA) cluster.1 The effective operation of the power \nsector hinges on immediate capacity building in (i) commercialization activities, (ii) billing and \ncollection, (iii) accounting systems, (iv) cost of service analysis, (v) operative metering and \nconnections, (vi) theft control, and (vii) new connection. Sustainability of reform will be ensured \nthrough a comprehensive capacity building initiative. As the World Bank, German Development \nCooperation (GTZ), and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are \nactively focusing on the first two areas\u2014commercialization, and billing and collection\u2014ADB will \nmainly assist in capacity building of basic skills in technical and accounting areas.  \n \n2.  The objective of the TA is to improve effective operation of the power sector by providing \ntechnical and accounting training. Three streams of training packages will be developed: \n \n(i)  business  management:  general  business  management,  portfolio  review,  and \nprogram management;  \n \n(ii)  technical  operation:  technical  operation  of  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution in the power sector; power plant protection; metering (meter readers, \nmeter  installation,  and  disconnection);  loss  management;  and  optimum \ndispatching; and \n \n(iii)  accounting  and  economic  management:  accounting  (e.g.,  double-entry \nbookkeeping, register, accrual-basis accounting); contracting; procurement and \ninventory management; financial reporting; management information system; and \neconomics of cost recovery and tariff setting. \n \n3.  The TA will help improve skills that will increase the overall efficiency of operations. It will \nimprove customer service delivery and overall  safety standards, and daily operations and \ntechnical and financial record keeping. \n \n4.  It  is  essential  that  the  training  packages  are  implemented  using  existing  training \nresources within the Ministry. Therefore there is a requirement to upskill the trainers within the \nDepartment of Education-Ministry of Education and Water who number approximately 60, and \nhave engineering qualifications and teaching capability.  \n \n5.  Premises to conduct training are extremely limited, the original extensive laboratories, \nworkshops,  class  rooms  and  hostel  remain  a  bombed  out  shell,  and  current  training  is \nconducted under tents and in primitive buildings. This TA recognizes the limited scope of \nphysical resources and there is a specific requirement to analyze and determine short term, \nmedium term, and long term physical resource requirements in conjunction (to the extent that \nthis is feasible) with other multilateral development agencies. \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2002.

The TA will be implemented over 5 months, from July to November 2005. \n \n8.  The TA will finance the services of an international consultant for 2 person-months on an \nintermittent basis. The consultant will be engaged individually in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultant will have expertise in capacity building \nand training within the energy sector, and will conduct training needs assessment of MEW and \nDABM.  \n \n9.  The training will have three components: (i) train the trainers within the Department of \nEducation-Ministry of Energy and Water; support for the establishment of a training institute in \nterm  of  short,  medium  and  long  term  planning;  (ii)  three  1-week  modules\u2014business ", "Appendix 14  53 \nmanagement, technical operation, and accounting and economic management; and (iii) a study \ntour to fast-developing countries for a selected group of trainers. \n \n10.  Under the training of the trainer module: about nine trainers from the Department of \nEducation-Ministry of Energy and Water (academic or technical experts, three for each subject) \nwill work under the guidance of training consultant together with a training institute to develop \nthe training modules suitable for Afghanistan. Three Afghan trainers will be trained under each \nmodule and an institute will be involved for developing each module. This process will take \nabout a month, and the three trainers will be work overseas with the training institutes. Each \ntraining will be run three times, covering 40\u201345 participants each time. A reputable international \neducational institute will be associated in providing the training with the support from the Afghan \ntrainers (graduates of the train the trainers program). Depending on the available skill base, all \nthree modules may be developed either by a single institute or three different institutes. The \nselection of the educational institute(s) will be based on the experience, competence, and skills \nin providing training in those areas. \n \n11.  Based on performance of the trainees, about six participants will be selected for study \ntours abroad. The tours will be designed along the lines of an exchange program, with an \noverseas utility where the Afghan participants will spend a month each learning operation, \nmanagement, and technical issues by working with the utility experts. \n \n12.

", "54  Appendix 15 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS  \n \nA.  Rationale \n   \n1.  Government is the main investor in electricity transmission all over the world. Investment \nin power transmission involves large amounts of capital, little maintenance cost, and a return \nover a long period. Government or an independent regulator regulates this sector because of its \nnatural monopoly characteristics; high fixed costs making it unprofitable for a second firm to \nenter and compete.  \n \n2.  All the components are part of the least-cost expansion program developed under the \npower system master plan. The plan considers supply alternatives to areas without grid supply \nand  with  large-scale  isolated  diesel  generation.  The  Project  is  the  least-cost  option  for \ndeveloping transmission and distribution network in the selected cities. On an incremental basis, \nthe Project will greatly reduce reliance on inefficient and high-cost village, household, and \nenterprise self-generation at unit costs in the range $0.15\u20130.55/kWh, replaced with an estimated \naverage incremental cost of grid-connected electricity of $0.079/kWh. \n \nB.  Economic Cost of Project Components \n \n3.  To convert financial project cost into economic cost, turnover and income taxes were \ndeducted, and connection costs added (after allowing for the about 18,000 electrification kits \nthat will be distributed to the poorest households as part of the Project). Annual operation and \nmaintenance and administration costs were calculated in economic prices (financial prices \nadjusted using the standard conversion factor). No price contingencies are included in the base \ncapital  cost  but  the  economic  capital  costs  include  physical  contingencies.  Costs  were \nseparated into foreign exchange and local costs. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was used. \nThe  cost  of  supply  was  valued  based  on  the  long-run  marginal  cost  for  generation  and \ntransmission as calculated in the power sector master plan. \n \n4.  Consistent with the financial analysis, 30 years is used for the project economic analysis. \nInvestment is assumed to take place during 2005\u20132007, and projects benefits are assumed to \nbe realized from 2007. Beyond 2020, further investment will be required to meet incremental \ndemand growth. \n \nC.  Quantification of Benefits \n \n5.  The main benefits are from (i) eventual connection to northern neighboring countries for \nthe long-term reliable electricity; (ii) connection of new customers to electricity; (iii) improved \navailability  and  reliability;  and  (iv)  supply  of  electricity  from  non-diesel  sources  and  loss \nreduction. The incremental and non-incremental benefits were selected separately. Incremental \nbenefit was calculated using customers\u2019 willingness to pay, and the non-incremental benefit was \nnot captured in the calculation, as resource cost savings for individual components could not be \nreliably estimated. \n \n6.  The reductions in technical and nontechnical losses were derived from the power system \nmaster plan forecast, and were applied uniformly across all components. In general, technical \nlosses at the distribution level are assumed to reduce from present levels of approximately 19% \nof energy sales to 12% by 2020. Nontechnical losses are assumed to reduce from present \nlevels to 6% over the same period. Loss reduction has been applied to incremental and non-\nincremental sales in calculating benefit streams. ", "Appendix 15  55 \n \n7.  Most households in the project area have no access to grid electricity. However, village-\nsponsored  systems  and  privately  operated  generators  based  on  diesel  or  petrol-powered \ngensets provide limited amounts of electricity. Thus, even in the absence of grid supply, the \nresidential, Government, and \u201cother\u201d sectors consume a certain amount of electricity, although \nthe price paid is substantially higher than the grid-connected customers. \n \n1.  Domestic Consumers \n \n8.  For  economic  analysis,  adjustments  were  made  to  incremental  electricity  sales,  to \nexclude  non-incremental  energy  consumption  (existing  energy  consumption  that  will  be \ncaptured by Afghanistan Electricity Authority [DABM] as the network is rehabilitated). Based on \nfindings  of  the  socioeconomic  survey,  domestic  average  non-incremental  demand  was \nestimated at 9.3 kWh per month per household. For other consumer groups, it was assumed \nthat estimated suppressed demand is met from other electrical and nonelectrical sources. \n \n9.  The economic benefits of extending grid supply to unserved areas are estimated based \non the cost of alternative energy sources used for existing consumption levels, and based on \nthe willingness to pay for induced consumption as a consequence of the availability of reliable \ngrid  supply.  Analysis  of  the  socioeconomic  survey  revealed  that  the  non-incremental \nconsumption of electricity or its equivalent in other forms of energy is approximately AF270 \n($5.80) per household per month, whether grid-connected or not. Households that have access \nto  electricity  include  many  that  are  supplied  by  village-operated  petrol-  or  diesel-powered \ngensets, for an average of about 5 hours per day. The average expenditure per household from \nthis source is AF236 ($5.12) per month for consumption of 9.3 kWh, equivalent to AF25.3/kWh \n($0.55/kWh).  \n \n10.  Households in project areas connected to the grid and paying a tariff of AF0.96\u20132.5/kWh \n($0.02\u20130.05/kWh), spend on average AF270 ($5.86) per month for electricity, consuming 107\u2013\n281 kWh per household per month. Incremental consumption of electricity within the project \nareas in the domestic sector is thus 98.5\u2013280 kWh per month per household (total average \nconsumption with the project less non-incremental consumption). Non-incremental consumption \nof electricity is thus valued at the resource cost of AF25.3/kWh ($0.55/kWh). \n \n11.  Incremental consumption of electricity, valued assuming a linear demand function (that \nis, assuming that 50% of the difference between the current tariff and the cost of the alternative \nrepresents consumer surplus), is estimated at AF13.9 /kWh (3.23 c/kWh). A semi-log demand \nfunction, which would theoretically lower the value of the incremental consumption, was not \nused, as the price change would not be significant after rounding to one decimal place in US \ndollars. \n \n12.  The analysis ignored the benefit from supply reliability improvements as the level of \nindustrialization is very low in Afghanistan and, consequently, the difference between the value \nof lost load and tariff will be low. An average incremental cost of future electricity supply (to the \nmedium voltage bus bar) was estimated as part of the power system master plan to be \napproximately AF3.6 /kWh (9 c/kWh) for the integrated central grid. Most customers in the \ncurrent and expanded network will be connected at the low-voltage level. At current tariffs then, \nsupply costs are typically under-recovered, and a prima facie economic subsidy to domestic \nconsumers will be realized as the system expands.  ", "56  Appendix 15 \nD.  Economic Model and Evaluation \n13.  To test the economic viability of each of the components, the economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) was calculated on the basis of incremental cost-and-benefit streams associated \nwith each project. The economic analysis evaluated the economic performance of the proposed \ncomponents by comparing the with- and without-project scenarios, i.e., the economic value of \nthe incremental and non-incremental supply of electricity that the components will provide \ncompared with the existing patterns of energy use in non-electrified areas. \n \n14.  Economic returns are acceptable for all projects and robust for most. This stems from \ngrid extensions\u2019 capacity to bring urban-quality power at the urban tariff to rural villages that \nwould otherwise face high costs for low-quality service. On average, the Project will allow poor \nhouseholds to consume 10 times the electricity than they had access to under a similar \nhousehold budget without the Project.  \n \nTable A15.1: Summary of EIRR for Project Components \n \nProject  EIRR (%) \n1.

Sensitivity Analysis  \n15.  Sensitivity of project economic performance to changes in key variables was tested. \nResults are summarized in Table 15.2.

", "Appendix 16  57 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS  \nA.  Project Cost \n \n1.  The  total  project  cost  includes  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest  during \nconstruction, and provisions for security and de-mining. Physical contingency is provisioned on \n8% of the project base cost. The project cost, including physical contingency, is based on \nconstant 2005 prices. Allowance for price contingency provides for future price escalation due to \nfluctuation of foreign and domestic inflation.1 Interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod will be capitalized and charged to the loan account. The total project cost also includes \nprovisions  for  support  facilities,  de-mining  and  security  activities,  resettlement  and  its \nmonitoring, and consulting services, which will all support project implementation. Local taxes \nand duties are not payable under the Project. \n \nB.  Project Financial and Economic Evaluation \n \n1.  Financial Analysis \n \n2.  Methodology. Subproject components were planned cost-effectively. Since the financial \nimpacts of the transmission and distribution components are interdependent, they have been \ncombined for financial evaluation. A period of 30 years has been used for the project evaluation. \nInvestment is expected to take place during 2005\u20132007 and project benefits will be realized \nfrom 2007. Beyond 2020, further investment will be required to meet incremental demand \ngrowth. All benefit-and-cost streams are determined in constant 2005 dollar terms.  \n \n3.  Financial Benefits. From a financial perspective, project benefits will be generated from \nincremental  sales  resulting  from  reduction  of  transmission  and  distribution  losses.  The \nrehabilitation  and  construction  of  transmission  and  distribution  systems  will  enable  older \nsystems to be gradually retired as appropriate, thereby reducing losses and increasing reliability \nand quality of supply. Under the current situation of acute power supply shortfall against \ndemand in the areas, additional project benefits will also depend on release of the present \nsuppressed demand and ability to meet growing demand. Distribution loss is will be gradually \nreduced by 0.6% on an annual average for next 3 years during project implementation2 while \ntransmission loss accruing from new transmission components is taken on 1.5%.    \n \n4.  Financial  Costs.  For  the  purpose  of  financial  evaluation,  cost  streams  reflect \nincremental costs in delivering the benefits identified. The financial costs comprise capital, \nincremental energy, operation and maintenance (O&M), administration, particularly additional \nbilling, costs, and taxation. The capital costs include physical contingencies. Incremental energy \ncosts are accrued to additional generation and power purchase to be supplied to the project \narea. O&M costs for transmission and distribution systems are assumed on 1.0% and 1.5% of \nrequired  capital  costs.  The  size  of  incremental  administration  costs,  including  billing  and \ncollection costs, is minor but is assumed to increase in proportion to consumption growth since \ndistribution projects contribute to a large number of new connections (para 1). Project cash \nflows will be taxed in accordance with the existing tax regime for state enterprises\u20142% tax on \nturnover (electricity sales) and 20% tax on net income. \n                                                 \n1  Domestic inflation rate is taken as 2.0% per annum and foreign inflation rates are based on manufacturing unit \nvalue index. \n2 The overall distribution losses in Afghanistan Electricity Authority  (DABM) are estimated on 27%. The Project\u2019s \ndistribution  system  will  reduce  technical  losses,  but  overall  distribution  losses  are  assumed  to  be  reduced \nconservatively due to the present inadequate billing and collection management and meter-reading system of \nDABM.  ", " 58 Appendix 16 \n \n  2.  Financial Evaluation \n \n5.  To evaluate  the financial viability of the Project, the financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR) is calculated on the basis of incremental benefit and cost streams associated with the \nProject. The FIRR was tested on sensitivity of the project performance to changes in  key \nvariables.  The  results  are  summarized  in  Table  A16,  which  indicates  that  the  Project  is \nfinancially feasible,3 and FIRRs are not sensitive to variables tested, even for multiple downside \n(combined) scenarios. The calculation of the base FIRR analysis is in Supplementary Appendix \nE. \n \n \nTable A16:  Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Test \nCapital  1 Year Delay \nBase Case  Demand   Cost  O&M Cost  of  Combined  \n   (10%)  10%  10%  Construction  Scenario \n11.8%  10.7%  10.9%  11.7%  11.3%  9.5% \n \nAF = Government of Afghanistan currency unit, DABM = Da Afghanistan Breshna Moasses (Afghanistan Electricity \nAuthority), IDC = interest during construction, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, KV = kilovolt, O&M = operation \nand maintenance, T&D = transmission and distribution. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3 The real weighted average cost of capital (WACC) compared with FIRRs in assessing the Project\u2019s financial \nfeasibility. Given 100% ADB funding at 1% interest charges on DABM, the WACC is lower than the minimum test \nrate of 4% in accordance with  Guidelines for Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects \nFinanced by ADB.
