A summary of the initial environmental examination is \nin Appendix 11.  \n \n\nProject Description  The  Project  will  construct  and  rehabilitate  206  kilometers  of \ntransmission  network,  and  rehabilitate  the  associated  substations \nand distribution systems in 11 rural towns and adjacent rural areas \nin  the  northern,  eastern,  and  southern  provinces.  The  Project  will \nconnect  90,700  new  consumers,  most  of  whom  are  poor,  to  the \ngrid and, in addition, will allocate 18,000 electricity connection kits, \nwith affordable and flexible payment options.  \n \nMost  of  Afghanistan\u2019s  28  million  people\u2014mostly  rural  poor\u2014have \nno access to reliable, modern forms of energy such as electricity, \ngas, and liquid fuels. The national electrification ratio is about 9%. \nAs  the  power  sector\u2019s  poor  state  severely  constrains  economic \ngrowth, the Government puts priority on developing the sector. \n\nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\nAfghanistan\u2019s  power  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \nsystems  have  been  severely  damaged  by  years  of  conflict.  There \nis no national transmission grid, and the overall condition of lines is \nvery  poor.  The  Northern  Transmission  Link,  which  is  being \nrehabilitated, serves the major northern cities and Kabul and is the \nbackbone  of  the  transmission  system.  Because  of  the  lack  of \ngeneration  capacity,  power  has  to  be  imported  in  the  near  term \nfrom neighboring countries, which are rich in gas. In the long term, \nwhen  Afghanistan\u2019s  hydropower  potential  is  realized,  power  could \nbe  exported  to  neighboring  countries.  The  transmission  system \nneeds  to  be  rehabilitated  and  reinforced  to  improve  reliability  and \nreduce system losses. \n \nDistribution  systems  are  stretched  beyond  their  technical  and \neconomic  lives  because  of  inadequate  investment  and  lack  of \nlow-voltage  distribution \nmaintenance.  The  substations  and \nnetworks  are  either  destroyed  or  overloaded.  A  large  number  of \nunauthorized  consumers  are  overloading \nthus \nreducing supply voltage and increasing technical losses. \n\nthe  system, \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and \nOutcome  \n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and \nTerms \n\n \nSpecial Terms \n\nAllocation and \nRele nding Terms \n\nADF Grant \n\nThe Project is part of the Government\u2019s power master plan and is \nconsistent with the Government\u2019s policy of providing reliable power \nsupply  to  all  Afghans.  The  Project\u2019s  scope  has  been  coordinated \nwith other external funding agencies.  \n \nA 2005 International Monetary Fund (IMF) debt sustainability study \nsuggests that Afghanistan will need to rely primarily on grants and, \nin  a  limited  way,  on  borrowings.  It  highlights  the  importance  of  a \nhigh grant element for loans.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s objective is to improve power supply in the northern, \nsouthern,  and  eastern  areas  of  the  country.  Power  supply  will  be \nimproved  by  rehabilitating  and  extending  power  transmission  and \ndistribution  systems.  The  Project  will  construct  and  rehabilitate \ntransmission  lines  and  build  the  associated  substations  and \ndistribution  networks.  The  Project\u2019s  technical  assistance  (TA) \ncomponent  will  cover  capacity  building  in  the  Ministry  of  Energy \nand  Water  (MEW)  and  Afghanistan  Electricity  Authority  (DABM, \nthe  vertically  integrated  power  company)  for  the  operation  and \nmanagement of electricity business.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  cost  is  estimated  at  $50.0  million  equivalent, \ncomprising  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $40.5  million  (81%)  and  a \nlocal currency cost of $9.5 million equivalent (19%).  \n \nIt  is  proposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provide  a \ntotal of $50.0 million (a grant of $23.5 million and a loan of $26.5 \nmillion) equivalent from its Special Funds resources to finance the \nforeign exchange and local currency cost. The approved waiver of \ncost-sharing  limits  for  loans  and  TA  operations  for  Afghanistan  is \napplied to this Project. \n \nA  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR  17.298  million \n($26.5  million  equivalent)  will  be  provided  from  Special  Funds \nresources. \n \nConcessional  terms  will  be  used  to  support  economic  recovery. \nThe  terms  will  offer  a  40-year  maturity,  including  a  10-year grace \nperiod  with  1%  interest  charge  throughout  the  term  to  be \ncapitalized  during  grace  the  period  and  charged  to  the  loan \naccount. \n \nThe  proceeds  of \nthe \nImplementing  Agency,  under  substantially  the  same  terms  as \nthose of the ADB loan.  \n \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) IX grant of $23.5 million will assist \nAfghanistan in the transition from a post-conflict situation to peace \nand stability.  \n \n\nloan  will  be  made  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n\f \n\n \n\n v\n\nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2015 \n \n \nEstimated Project \n30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\nProcurement \n\n \nMEW  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  DABM  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency. \n \nProject  implementation  will  commence  in  July  2005  and  be \ncompleted  in  3  years.  The  project  implementation  support  unit \nestablished  by  MEW  will  manage  day-to-day \nproject \nimplementation. \n \nLoan-financed goods, services, and civil works will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  by  the \nprocurement  unit  of \nthe  Afghanistan  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment Services on behalf of the MEW and assisted by the \nproject  implementation  consultants.  ADB  has  approved  advance \nprocurement action for the turnkey contracts, including preparation \nand  issuance  of  bid  documents,  and  evaluation  of  the  bids \nreceived.  \n \n\nin  project \n\nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  (40  person-months  international  and  100 \nperson-months  domestic) will be required to assist the MEW and  \nimplementation.  All  project-financed \nthe  DABM \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for selection and engagement of \nto  quality-  and  cost-based \ndomestic  consultants,  pursuant \nselection. MEW will take advance action to recruit the consultants.  \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  about  1.2  million  people,  who are \nlargely poor (90,700 households), in 11 rural towns (Breshna Kot, \nImam Sahib, Jalalabad, Khan Abad, Mehtarlam, Muhammad Agha, \nPuli  Alam,  Qarghayi,  Sarepul,  Surobi,  and  Taluqan).  Among  the \ntargeted  population,  the  number  of  consumers  connected  to  grid \npower  supply  will  increase  from  28%  to  more  than  50%  by  2010. \nTransmission and distribution network losses will be reduced from \n35\u201340% to 30% by 2010. \n \nThe Project will benefit the poor living in rural towns. All surveyed \nbeneficiaries indicated that, after potable water, electricity (lighting, \nin  particular)  would  most  improve  their  living  conditions  and \nlivelihoods.  They  considered  electricity  as  a  means  to  improve \nlearning opportunities for children (49% of the population, up to 14 \nyears old). Access to  electricity will allow home-based businesses \n(about  3.5%,  mostly  grocery  stores,  food  processing,  or  rug-\nmaking)  to  expand  into  small-scale  commercial  or  industrial \noperations. \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \nTechnical \nAssistance \n\nOther  benefits  are  improved  health  (fewer  eye  and  respiratory \ninfections)  as  electricity  will  replace  kerosene  for  lighting.  Women \nare expected to benefit the most from the additional lighting and/or \nmotive  power  for  home-based  income-generating  activities  and \nfrom improved indoor air quality. The use of electricity will result in \nnet  savings  to  consumers,  as  it  is  cheaper  than  kerosene  and \nfuelwood.  \n \nThe  overall  financial  and  economic  analyses  have  confirmed  the \nviability of the project components. \n \nThe  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  volatile  and \nuncertain.  Security\u2014mobility  restriction  to  and  within  Afghanistan, \nand  personal  safety\u2014could  delay  project  implementation.  An \ninterministerial committee will be established to continue guidance \nin all aspects of security.  \n \nWeak implementation capacity on the part of the government could \nlead  to  delay  in  implementation.  In  addition,  weak  governance \nstructures  within  government  raise  the  specter  of  corruption  as  a \nrisk.  Also  weak  implementation  capacity  in  accounting  and \nfinances  increases  these  risks.  The  risk  of  delay  because  of \ninadequate  implementation  capacity  will  be  mitigated  by  training \nstaff  of  MEW  (in  project  management,  planning)  and  DABM  (in \ndesign, implementation, and operation and maintenance).  \n \nAdequate  investment  in  generation  and  transmission  will  be \nensured  by  coordination  with  other  donor  agencies  and  the \nGovernment  in  a  way  consistent  with  the  power  sector  master \nplan.  \n \nA  further  risk  is  that  the  allocation  of  electrification  kits  may  be \ninfluenced  by  corruption.  The  Project  protects against this risk by \nrequiring  a  transparent  procedure  to  establish  objective  allocation \ncriteria for the kits. It also establishes a grievance, complaints and \ndispute resolution mechanism for customers receiving kits.  \n \nInstitutional  reform  required  to  improve  the  sector\u2019s  sustainability \nand  operation  will  be  pursued  under  the  Government\u2019s  Priority \nReform and Restructuring program in cooperation with all external \nfunding agencies.  \n \nAn  advisory  TA  for  $750,000  will  be  attached  to  the  loan  to \nstrengthen project management, planning, design, implementation, \nand operation and maintenance done by MEW. The TA will finance \nhuman resource development, and inland and overseas training of \nMEW  and  DABM  personnel  in  selected  utilities  and management \ninstitutions.  The  TA  will  be  financed  as  a  grant  from  ADB\u2019s  TA \nfunding  program.  An  international  consultant  and  trainers  will  be \nrequired  for  11  person-months  intermittently,  and  will  be  engaged \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n\n\fvii \n\n \n\n\f  \n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  grant,  both  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Power \nTransmission and Distribution Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance \n(TA) for capacity building of the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW), and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the \nTA. The Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nMost of Afghanistan\u2019s nearly 28 million people are rural poor, with no access to reliable, \nmodern  forms  of  energy  such  as  electricity,  gas,  and  liquid  fuels.  As the power sector\u2019s poor \nstate  severely  constrains  economic  growth,  the  Government  puts  priority  on  developing  the \nsector.  Afghanistan\u2019s  per  capita  power  consumption  is  among  the  lowest  in  the  world  (21 \nkilowatt  hours  [kWh]  per  year),  and  only  about  234,000  customers  (less  than  10%1)  are \nconnected to the isolated public grid, of which about 30% is in Kabul. There is no national power \ngrid, and most rural areas are virtually unserved.  Reliable power service is critical to economic \ngrowth, social equity, and political unity. \n \n3. \nThe  power  sector  needs  immediate  investment  in  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution. Four isolated power systems\u2014centered around Kandahar in the south, Kabul in the \ncenter, Herat in the west, and Mazar-e-Sharif in the north\u2014form the main power infrastructure \nas  most  rural  town  centers  are  remote,  isolated,  and  separated  by  mountains.  The  power \ndistribution infrastructure has been destroyed and needs major rehabilitation. Although the total \ninstalled  generation  capacity  is  453  megawatt  (MW),  only  250  MW  is  generated,  and  most \ngenerating  units  require  overhaul  or  replacement.  Appendix  2  analyzes  the  power  sector  in \ndetail. \n \nAfghanistan  has  large  hydropower  potential  (more  than  20,000  MW)  that  could  be \n4. \nexported in the long term to lessen reliance on expensive gas-based generation in neighboring \ncountries. In the interim, however, Afghanistan has to rely on imported power to meet growing \npower  demand.  Based  on  annual  power  purchase  agreements,  it  imports  about  76  gigawatt-\nhours  (GWh)  from  Uzbekistan2  to  meet  demand  in  Balkh  and  Hairatan,  18.2  GWh  from \nTurkmenistan  to  meet  demand  in  Herat,  and  12.3  GWh  from  Tajikistan  to  meet  demand  in \nKunduz and other northern provinces. \n \nA  centralized  transmission  grid  covering  the  whole  country  (based  on  load  forecast)  is \n5. \nnot  economically  feasible  as  the  distance  between  load  centers  greatly  raises  the  cost  of \ntransmission  and  energy  losses.  Two  other  transmission  projects\u2014Hairatan  to  Pul-e-Khumri \n(funded by ADB) and Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul (funding under consideration by the  US Agency for \nInternational Development [USAID] and the Government of India) are creating the backbone of \nthe  transmission  network,  enabling  the  import  of  electricity  to  Kabul.  The  isolated  distribution \nsystems  are  stretched  beyond  their  technical  and  economic  lives  because  of  inadequate \n                                                 \n1   Based upon 234,000 households with electricity, an average of 12 people per household, and a population of 28.5 \n\nmillion (9.85% electrification). \n\n2   Under  the  ongoing  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project,  ADB  is  helping  the \n\nGovernment enter into a power purchase agreement with Uzbekistan for 150 MW of power import. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\ninvestment  and  prolonged  lack  of  maintenance.  The  electricity  distribution  system  remains  the \nweakest link in the economy, and investments and management reform are urgently needed to \ncapitalize on gains made in transmission and generation investments. The distribution networks \nin provincial cities have similar problems.  \n \n6. \nTechnical  losses  due  to  overloading  of  transmission  and  distribution  equipment,  and \nsubstandard overhead conductors and underground cable joints are estimated to be about 20\u2013\n25%.  Nontechnical  losses  from  pilferage  and  inappropriate  metering  are  as  high  as  15\u201320%. \nOverall  load  shedding  (cutting  off  the  power  on  certain  lines  when  demand  becomes  greater \nthan supply), unreliable supply, and high system losses have paralyzed the power sector.  \n \nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n(i)  Afghanistan  Electricity  Authority \n\n \n7. \nIn  December  2004,  the  newly  elected  Government  created  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and \nWater  (MEW)  by  merging  the  responsibilities  of  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Power  and  some \nresponsibilities  of  the  Ministry  of  Mines  and  Industry.  MEW  is  responsible  for  power,  gas, \npetroleum, and water resources. In the power sector, MEW controls the operation of five state-\nowned  enterprises: \n(DABM)\u2014power  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution; 5,421 employees; (ii) Spinghar Construction Unit\u2014civil works for \nthe  power  sector;  385  employees;  (iii)  Power  Construction  Unit\u2014erection of transmission and \ndistribution  lines  and  substations;  420  employees;  (iv)  Water  and  Power  Engineering \nConsultancy  Authority\u2014design  and  field  survey  of  new  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution;  182  employees;  and  (v)  New  and  Renewable  Energy  Research  and  Development \nCentre\u2014development  of  renewable  energy;  149  employees.  Although  the  Enterprise  Act  of \n1980 sets out their responsibilities, in practice these enterprises are closely controlled by MEW. \nDABM\u2014the  vertically  integrated  power  utility\u2014manages  about  80%  of  the  country\u2019s  electricity \nproduction, while the ministries of mines and industry and of light industry share management of \nthe remaining 20%. The Government owns all these enterprises, which directly report to MEW. \n \n8. \nThe  massive  brain  drain  and  collapse  of  the  educational  system  have  left  Afghanistan \nwith limited local analytical and management capabilities. Limited absorptive capacity is a major \nbottleneck  for  effective  donor  assistance.  Business,  technical,  and  operational  skills  must  be \ndeveloped  immediately  to  rebuild  the  power  sector.  External  consultants  have  carried  out \nprocurement,  project  management,  and  planning,  on  an  interim  basis,  under  different  ADB \nprograms  to  develop  institutions\u2019  capacity  to  assume  responsibility  for  these  functions  and  to \nimprove the country\u2019s capacity to absorb assistance. DABM lacks the economic and operational \nresources to provide basic electricity supply. Most DABM staff lack the technical skills to operate \nthe  power  system.  DABM\u2019s  financial  situation  is  unsustainable  mainly  because  of  inadequate \ngeneration  to  meet  demand,  low  tariffs,  large  losses,  and  poor  collection.  The  Government \nrecently  received  World  Bank  assistance3  to  commercialize  DABM  (i.e.,  to  restructure  and \nincorporate  it,  to  computerize  financial  management,  and  to  apply  a  recommended  multiyear \ntariff  path);  and  to  wage  a  major  public  relations  campaign  to  communicate  the  Government\u2019s \nvision,  strategy,  and  reform  program  to  all  stakeholders.  This  initiative  complements  ADB\u2019s \nwork. \n \n\n                                                 \n3  Approved in June 2004, for $105 million to finance rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution network in Kabul, \nrehabilitation of Naghlu hydro power station, rehabilitation of 110 kV transmission line from Naghlu to Kabul East \nand Kabul North substations. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 3\n\n2. \n\nPower Shortage in Kabul \n\n \n \n \n9. \nKabul,  with  3  million  people,  has  no  permanent  power  source\u2014only three hydropower \nstations and a diesel-fueled gas turbine (44 MW). The total effective generation capacity is 145 \nMW,  and  the  maximum  peak  demand  is  about  140  MW,  excluding  the  50  MW  load  that  is \nusually  shed  during  peak  periods.  A  large  part  of  electricity  supply  is  generated  by  diesel  and \nfunded by USAID. Ac cording to the Government\u2019s master plan, maximum demand in Kabul will \nreach about 320 MW by 2020, and new hydropower or gas-based thermal power production can \nbe  available  only  after  2010.  Under  the  master  plan,  the  increase  of  power  supply  to  Kabul  in \nthe short term has to be based on a combination of the following: (i) new, small diesel plants; (ii) \nextension of the North West Thermal Power Station with a combined cycle unit; (iii) restoring of \noriginal generating capacity of existing hydropower plants; (iv) use of natural gas resources near \nSheberghan;  and  (v)  import  of  power  from  neighboring  countries  in  the  north  over  new \ntransmission lines to Kabul. \n \nThe  Government  plans  to  import  about  150  MW  from  Uzbekistan  to  meet  demand  in \n10. \nKabul  via  Khulm  and  Pul-i-Khumri.  The  line  from  Amu  (in  Uzbekistan)  to  Kabul  is  about  500 \nkilometers  (km):  ADB  is  financing4  the  stretch  from  Termez  to  Khulm  and  construction  of  two \nsingle  circuit  lines  from  Khulm  to  Pul-i-Khumri  (the  northern  link).  The  Government  has \nrequested USAID to finance the construction of the transmission line from Pul-i-Khumri to Kabul.  \n \n\n3. \n\nLimited Rural Electrification \n\nRural electrification is a long-term prospect, and access to the grid for all is not a viable \n11. \nalternative.  Most people live in rural areas and lead a very basic life. Their access to electricity \nis  limited,  almost  nonexistent,  worsening  already  poor  education  and  health  conditions.  No \nmajor  small-scale  livelihood  program  has  been  developed  in  rural  areas.  Per  capita \nconsumption of electricity is 21 kWh per month (one 100-watt light bulb consumes 1 kWh in 10 \nhours).  Rural  electrification\u2014with  emphasis  on  renewable  energy\u2014may  be  the  only  way  to \nrecover lost economic opportunities. The Government is undertaking a comprehensive survey in \nrenewable  energy  resources  with  support  from  ADB.5  The  TA  will  establish  the  conditions \n(including  a  pilot  project  covering  10  remote  villages)  for  using  solar  power  in  areas  with  no \naccess to grid power.  \n \n\n4. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n12. \nThe  power  sector  needs  large  amounts  of  investment  in  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution.  The  Government  has  relied  on  aid  finance  to  meet  its  capital  expenditure,  and \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  are  sometimes  externally  financed  as  power  supply \noperation is unable to recover full operation cost, a situation worsened by growing security and \nsafety  concerns.  The  Government\u2019s  dependency  on  aid  financing  is  likely  to  continue  in  the \nshort  to  medium  term,  as  the  overall  investment  climate  is  not  favorable  to  private  or  other \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB 2003.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nTransitional  Islamic  State  of  Afghanistan  for  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  Project. \nManila. \n\n5   ADB  2003.  Renewable  Energy  Development  in  Small  Towns  and  Rural  Areas,  Manila  (TA  3874),  for  $450,000, \napproved  on  21  March  2003.  This  TA  complemented  Subcluster  1  Capacity  Building  for  Reconstruction  of \nAgricultural  and  Natural  Resources  Management,  which  forms  part  of  the  TA  Cluster  (ADB.  2002.  Technical \nAssistance Cluster to the Republic of Afghanistan for Capacity Building for Reconstruction and Development [TA \n3874-AFG, for $14.5 million, approved 15 May 2002]). \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ninvestors.  In  the  interim,  however,  aid  financing  will  benefit  the  private  sector  by  reducing \noperational, regulatory, and policy uncertainties.  Private sector participation will take two forms: \n(i)  large-scale  involvement  (not  necessarily  direct  equity  investment)  in  generation  to  supply \nbase  load  for  Kabul  or  other  main  cities  and  (ii)  small-scale  generation  and  distribution  (by \ndomestic  entrepreneurs)  in  isolated  rural  areas.  Barely  existent  in  the  energy  sector, private \nsector  investment  may  be  the  only  viable  option  to  quickly  electrify  large  parts  of  the  country. \nMultiple wars over many years have left a weak power supply monopoly, unlike in many other \ncountries  facing  deregulation.  Regulation,  rules,  and  agencies,  while  urgently  needed,  must \ntherefore be carefully crafted so as not to discourage investment. \n \n\n5. \n\nFinancial Sustainability \n\nFinancial  sustainability  needs  infrastructure  (generation,  transmission,  and  distribution); \n13. \neffective  institutions  to  manage  the  business;  and  appropriate  tariff,  billing,  and  revenue \ncollection. Afghanistan is challenged on all fronts. This situation and medium-term prospects are \nsummarized in Appendix 2, Table A2.2. Although the average tariff for electricity is higher than \nin  neighboring  countries,  tariffs6  only  recover  on  average  about  50%  of  cost.  Unlike  many \ndeveloping  countries,  Afghanistan  has  location-specific  tariffs  rather  than  a  uniform  national \ntariff.  This  average  domestic  tariff  varies  widely  depending  on  the  source  of  power: \nhydropower\u2014Kabul  and  Kandahar  (2.0  cents  per  kWh);  and  imported  energy  and  diesel \ngeneration\u2014Mazar-e-Sharif (5.2), Kunduz (5.9), and Herat (9.1). The Government is committed \nto  full  cost  recovery  of  hydro-based  electricity  and  to  the  phased  increase  of  electricity  tariffs \ntoward cost recovery in the medium term.  \n \nNontechnical  loss  (estimated  at  15\u201320%)  will  have  to  be  minimized  and  collection \n14. \nefficiency  (60-70%)  improved.  Most  of  the  uncollected  revenues\u2014AF1,300  million7 (about $30 \nmillion)  as  of  the  end  of  October  2004\u2014is  mostly  owed  by  public  sector  customers  (e.g.,  the \nGovernment,  military,  and  police).  The  Government  has  to  ensure  budget  appropriation  for \nunpaid  customers  in  the  Government  sector  and  to  issue  policy  guidelines  on  disconnection, \nand anti-theft measures.  \n \n\n6. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Policies and Plans \n\nrestructuring,  unbundling,  establishment  of  a \n\n15. \nThe  Government\u2019s  goal  is  to  make  energy  more  available  at  least-cost  and  in  an \nenvironmentally  friendly  manner.  In  February  2004,  the  Government  formulated an electricity \nsector policy and a power sector road map (Appendix 2). The main elements of the policy are \nframework,  and \nsector \ncommercialization.  The  policy  plans  to  supply  the  entire  country  with  reliable  power  and  to \ncreate  730,000  more  connections  by  2010.  The  Government  aims  to  make  power  more \navailable  in  the  main  regions  by  (i)  investing  in  system  rehabilitation;  (ii)  increasing  supply,  in \npart  by  importing  power;  and  (iii)  expanding  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \ninfrastructure.  \n \n16. \nThe  Government\u2019s  reform  plan  is  to  corporatize  DABM  and  appoint  a  new  board  of \ndirectors. Four vertically integrated business units will be established, reflecting the current and \nmedium-term regional grid structures: (i) Breshna East (covering Ghazni, Kabul, Khost , Logar, \nNangarhar,  and  Pak  Tia  provinces);  (ii)  Breshna  North  (Baghlan,  Balkh,  Faryab,  Jowzjan, \n\nregulatory \n\n                                                 \n6   Average cost of supply estimated at 7 cents per kWh; the average tariff across the country is about 3.5 cents per \n\nkWh. \n\n7   Provisional figure from DABM, to be confirmed by the Government and DABM by June 2005. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 5\n\nKunduz, Samangan and Sarepul provinces); (iii) Breshna South (Helmand, Kandahar and Zabol \nprovinces); and (iv) Breshna West (covering Baghdis, Faryab and Herat provinces). An off-grid \naccess unit will cover all other rural, urban, and peri-urban areas and will eventually become a \nseparate rural electrification authority. MEW will be responsible for sector policy and planning, \nand  will  continue  to  prepare  and  implement  sector  policies,  coordinate  external  assistance \nprograms,  and  improve  governance  in  the  sector.  Certain  non-core  functions  such  as  civil \nconstruction and erection being undertaken by enterprises under MEW\u2019s administrative control \nwill be divested.  \n \n17. \nIn  part,  the  Government\u2019s  policy  follows  the  global  trend  of  unbundling  of  the  power \nsector, creation of an independent regulator, and separation of policy and operation. While an \nefficient  energy  sector  is  the  paramount  objective,  care  must  be  taken  before  implementing \nthese strategies. The electricity system is small and the incremental benefit of unbundling must \noutweigh the cost of unbundling in the long run. Afghanistan may not have the management and \ntechnical  staff  to  efficiently  operate  three  or  more  independent  companies  after  sector \nunbundling.  ADB  will  continue  its  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  together  with  other \nexternal  funding  agencies  on  the  practical  options  for  restructuring  and  unbundling  in \naccordance with economies of scale. \n \n\n7. \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n18. \nThe  key  lessons  learned  from  ADB  operations  since  2002  are  the  following:  (i)  the \nstrategic  focus  has  to  be  linked  to  the  Government\u2019s  strategies  and  priorities,  (ii)  capacity \nbuilding  should  continue  to  be  emphasized,  and  (iii)  coordination  with  development  partners \nmust be done properly. These lessons are included in the design of the Project, which covers (i) \nincreased  access  to  reliable  power,  a  key  Government  priority;  (ii)  a  separate  TA  for  capacity \nbuilding;  (iii)  active  coordination  through  project  implementation  and  support  unit  (PISU)  and \nsteering  committee;  and  (iv)  project  components  that  development  partners  agree  are \nimmediate priorities. \n \n19. \nImplementation  of  the  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction \nProject (EIRRP), the first energy project (footnote 2), was hobbled by new executing agencies\u2019 \nlack  of  familiarity  with  ADB  guidelines  and  procedures.  Im plementation  was  delayed  as  MEW \nneeded  to  rely  entirely  on  the  consultants  to  prepare  bid  documents,  manage  the  bidding \nprocess,  and  evaluate  bids.  Dedicated  full-time  consultants  were  not  available  and  essential \nskills  were  not  transferred  to  MEW  staff.  Although  the  situation  has  improved  and  the \nGovernment has created a centralized PISU (para. 25) to avoid similar problems, one individual \nconsultant (project management specialist) was engaged under the ongoing TA cluster8 to help \nthe  MEW  in  (i)  advance  recruitment  of  the  implementation  consultants  and  (ii)  advance \nprocurement action of contractors for the turnkey contracts. Another individual consultant (and \ninstitutional  and  policy  reform  specialist)  was  engaged  to  facilitate  progress  on  policy  matters \n(regulation, tariff, and unbundling). \n \n20. \nBecause of limited competition for the large turnkey contracts under the EIRRP, the bid \nprices were much higher than the engineers\u2019 estimates. The Project will use smaller packages \nto attract more bidders and increase competition. As the route of transmission lines under this \nProject will pass through an area containing unexploded ordinance, the cost of de-mining, to be \ncarried  out  by  United  Nations  Mine  Action  Center  Afghanistan,  will  be  the  responsibility  of \n\n                                                 \n8   ADB. 2002.

This will ensure that cost of security is competitively reflected in the bid \nprices.    The  Ministry  of  Interior  will  be  invited  to  join  the  project  steering  committee  to  ensure \nthat all security measures are considered.  \n \n\n8. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n21. \nPrevious  ADB  assistance  (mostly  transmission)  and  major  assistance  by  other  aid \nagencies  to  the  power  sector  in  Afghanistan  are  listed  in  Appendix  3.  The  power  sector  has \nreceived substantial support from German Development Cooperation via KfW (metering, billing, \nand renewable energy); USAID (generation); and the World Bank (distribution and generation), \nbesides ADB. The governments of India and Iran have provided financial assistance to finance \nkey power transmission links. KfW and ADB are promoting the use of renewable energy options \nfor  Afghanistan.  ADB  regularly  coordinates  with  all  major  external  funding  agencies  through \nperiodic meetings on key policy issues. \n \n\n9. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy  \n\n22. \nADB  has  taken  a  three-pronged  approach  to  support  reconstruction  and  poverty \nreduction:  building  capacity,  establishing  appropriate  policy  and  institutional  framework,  and \nrehabilitating  essential  infrastructure.9  ADB\u2019s  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  maximizing  the  use  of \nexisting  infrastructure  by  rehabilitating  power  substations,  power  transmission,  and  generation \nprojects; (ii) improving the quality, reliability, and promotion of energy efficiency; (iii) managing \nsecurity  issues  by  coordinating  closely  with  all  stakeholders;  (iv)  establishing  policies  and \ninstitutions  to  improve  importation  of  energy;  (v)  using  renewable  energy  where  possible;  (vi) \ndeveloping  a  consistent  policy  in  regulation,  environment,  tariff,  and  energy  efficiency;  (vi) \nbuilding capacity across the sector and promoting private-public sector partnerships in projects; \nand (vii) fast-tracking implementation where possible. \n \nThe  Project,  with  its  emphasis  on  rehabilitation  of  power  infrastructure,  facilitation  of \n23. \nenergy imports, promotion of energy efficiency (by using efficient lighting in connection kits), and \nsupport  for  capacity  building,  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy.  ADB  will \nwork with the Government to encourage private companies to invest in generation in Kabul and \nprovincial cities, and small private distribution networks to operate in isolated rural communities. \nEstablishment of regulation by contract is necessary for private sector participation.  \n \n\n10. \n\nPolicy Dialogue  \n\n24.  While the Project will rehabilitate and reinforce transmission and distribution networks, it \nwill  continue  the  policy  thrust  of  the  Post-Conflict  Multisector  Program  Loan,10 which included \npolicy  and  institutional  reform  to  improve  institutional  efficiency  and  cost  recovery,  establish  a \nregulatory framework, and encourage private sector participation.  \n \n\na. \n\nInstitutional Reform \n\nThe Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) Program (Supplementary Appendix H) was \n25. \nlaunched  by  decree  in  July  2003  to  kick-start  the  administrative  reforms  across  Government \ndepartments  and  agencies.  The  PRR  framework  allows  departments  of  ministries  to  be  given \n\n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2004.

MEW proposes \nto  reform  the  ministry  by  (i)  creating  a  PISU11  as  the  main  implementation  interface  for  aid-\nfunded  projects  to  improve  accountability,  (ii)  updating  the  electricity  law,  (iii)  appointing  a \ntechnical advisory board to support the minister or deputy minister; and (iv) establishing a high-\nlevel  reform  task  force  to  lead  the  sector  restructuring  process.  The  PISU\u2019s  overall  goal  is  to \naccelerate the implementation of the power sector development program. Jointly with the World \nBank, ADB has supported the creation of the PISU using resources under the ongoing capacity-\nbuilding cluster TA (footnote 8). \n  \n\nb. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\nThe  energy  sector  is  dominated  by  public  sector  monopolies.  The  Government  is \n26. \ndeveloping12  a  framework  to  encourage  private  sector  participation,  particularly  for  base  load \npower generation in large cities. As establishing a credible and capable independent regulator \ntakes  time  (at  least  5\u20137  years),  in  the  interim,  ADB  will  help  the  Government  create  a  simple \nform  of  regulation  by  contract  for  power  generation  and  distribution,  and  exemptions  from \nlicensing  requirements  for  small  captive  generation  and  embedded  distribution,  where \napplicable. Regulation by contract will commit the Government (and the regulatory  commission \nthat  it  will  create)  to  implement  a  pre-specified  tariff-setting  system  (with  a  reasonably  high \ndegree  of  certainty  as  to  the  company\u2019s  future  revenues  over  several  years),  whereas  the \nprivate  company  will  agree  to  provide  power  distribution  or  generation  service  of  agreed-on \nquality to specified customers over a defined period.  \n \nRegulation by contract will (i) protect consumers from monopoly prices and poor service \n27. \nquality;  and  (ii)  attract  investors,  by  reducing  regulatory  risk,  who  will  invest  in  providing \naffordable  service.  However,  large  private  investors  in  the  main  cities  are  likely  to  be \ndiscouraged  by  perceived  security  and  political  risks,  and  only  local  small  private  investors  in \nremote rural distribution and generation may benefit from simple regulation, as they are likely to \nbe less sensitive to such risks.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome  \n\n28. \nThe Project\u2019s objective is to improve power supply in the northern, southern, and eastern \nareas  of  the  country  by  rehabilitating  and  extending  power  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems. The Project will complement an earlier ADB  project (footnote 4) that rehabilitated and \nreconstructed damaged transmission lines and substations in the north for importing power from \nneighboring  countries.  The  Project  will  help  strengthen  institutions  to  accelerate  project \nimplementation and improve sector efficiency.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  scope  will  cover  the  region  north  of  Hindu  Kush  mountain,  the  central \n29. \neastern region from the central Hindu Kush to Kabul and eastward, and the southern region. A \nportion  of  the  Project  will  be  financed  by  grant  (para.  33).  Access  to  electricity  is  essential  for \n\n                                                 \n11  The PISU is supported by a team of international consultants.  \n12 MEW, in its submission to the National Development Budget to Ministry of Finance on 17 January 2004, identifies \n\nlack of private sector participation as a key problem and lists a set of actions to solve it. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\neconomic  growth.  As  most  electricity  customers  are  poor,  the  Project  will  benefit  them.  The \nProject will rehabilitate distribution, which will support small infrastructure and create jobs, and \nconnect  new  customers  (including  poor  and  isolated  communities)  to  power  sources.  The \ndistribution  components  will  be  financed  by  grant  and  the  transmission  components  by  loan. \nThe components are: \n \n\n (i) \n\nGrant-financed portion of the Project (low-voltage distribution) \n \n(a)  Northern  area.  Construction  of  substations  at  Imam  Sahib,  Sarepul, \nTaluqan  and  a  switching  station  at  Shekanbandar;  construction  of \ndistribution  network  in  Khan  Abad,  Imam  Sahib  and  Taluqan  (51,000 \nhouseholds); and provision of 9,000 electrification kits. \n\n \n(b)  Central  and  eastern  area.  Rehabilitation  of  substations  at  Jalalabad, \nMehtarlam,  Qarghayi  and  Surobi;  rehabilitation  of  distribution  networks  in \nJalalabad  and  Mehtarlam  (23,000  households);  and  provision  of  6,300 \nelectrification kits. \n\n \n\n \n(c)   Southern  area.  Construction  of  substations  at  Puli-Alam  and  Gardez; \nrehabilitation  of  city  distribution  networks  in  Puli-Alam,  Muhammad  Agha, \nand Gardez (16,500 households); and provision of 3,000 electrification kits. \n\n(iii) \n\nLoan-financed portion of the Project (110 kV transmission) \n\n \n\n \n\n (a)  Northern  area.  Construction  of  a  20  km  single  circuit \n\nline \n\nfrom \n\nShekanbandar to Imam Sahib.  \n\n \n(b)  Central  and  eastern  area.  Construction  of  75  km  single  circuit  line  from \nNaghlu east to Jalalabad, and 17 km double circuit 110 kV from Mehtarlam \nto Jalalabad. \n\n \n(c)  Southern area.  Construction  of  12  km  double  circuit  110  kv  transmission \nline  from  Breshnakt  to  Kabul  South,  and  43  km  (one  circuit  of  a  double \ncircuit) 220 kV transmission line from Kabul South to Puli-Alam, and 51 km \nPuli-Alam to Gardez. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n \nThe Project\u2019s components are the most critical ones in the Government\u2019s power master \n\n30. \nplan and consistent with a least-cost power sector development plan for the regions.  \n \nC. \n \n31. \nThe  social  and  poverty  survey  undertaken  during  project  preparation  noted  that  the \naverage  cost  for  a  new  household  connection  was  $31.  Although  the  survey  noted  a  high \nwillingness  to  pay  for  electricity,  the  project  beneficiaries  may  not  be  able  to  pay  the  one-time \nconnection  charge  and  the  internal  wiring  costs  for  lighting  and  power  points.  Improper \nconnections  are  a  fire  and  personal  safety  hazard.  To ensure safe and affordable connection, \nthe  Project  will  provide  electrification  kits,  which  will  include  a  standard  meter,  two  compact \nfluorescent lights, and a double power point. Kit users will have immediate access to electricity, \nwith a flexible payment option levied through the kit tariff (repayment over a period rather than \nupfront). Detailed descriptions of the kits are in Appendix 4. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 9\n\nCost Estimates  \n\nD. \n \n32. \nProject cost estimates are summarized in Table 1. The total project cost is $50.0 million, \nincluding physical and price contingencies, and service charges during construction. The foreign \nexchange  cost  is  $40.5  million,  or  about  81%  of  the  total  and  the  local  currency  costs  of  $9.5 \nmillion, or 19% (Appendix 5).

The  total  amount  of  the  interest  charge  during  the  grace \nperiod will be capitalized and charged to the loan account. The Government will make the loan \navailable  to  DABM  under  a  subsidiary  financing  agreement  with  conditions  similar  (same \ninterest rate and loan terms) to the ADB loan. The Government will bear the foreign exchange \nrisk.  \n \nF. \n\nAsian Development Fund (ADF) IX Grant Financing \n\nUnder  the  ADF  IX  resolution13\n\n35. \n  donors  agreed  that  ADF  grants  could  be  used  to  assist \npoor  countries  make  the  transition  from  post-conflict  to  peace  and  stability.  Afghanistan  was \nidentified as one of the poorest post-conflict countries and eligible for ADF grants14. Prolonged \nconflict has endangered the poor, destroyed their economic opportunities, damaged water and \nelectricity  infrastructure,  and  disrupted  delivery  of  basic  services  to the neediest. Access to a \nreliable  power  source  is  a  prerequisite  for  sustained  economic  growth,  and  grants  can \naccelerate such growth. The Project will increase access to power by rehabilitating distribution \nsystems and providing electrification kits. \n \n36. \nAfghanistan has made significant progress since the ouster of the Taliban regime. The \nGovernment  has  implemented  a  wide  range  of  structural  reforms  and  adhered  to  almost  all \nquantitative indicators and structural benchmarks under the Staff-Monitored Program, led by the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  Notwithstanding  these  achievements  and  double-digit \neconomic  growth  over  the  last  2  years,  the  economic  and  fiscal  situation  continues  to  be \nextremely fragile. Security, economic, social, and administrative challenges are formidable. The \ncountry  continues  to  need  external  development  finance  that  does  not  fiscally  burden  the \nnascent administration. \n\n \n\n37. \nThe  high  growth  rates  since  the  end  of  the  conflict  have  been  fuelled  primarily  by \nexternal funding agency supported relief and construction activities as well as by the temporary \nend to the drought. However, to achieve growth targets over the medium term and to gradually \nreplace  opium  production,  the  Government  must  aim  for  broad-based  and  sustainable \ndevelopment and identify new drivers of growth. Investment in the power sector is a prerequisite \nfor sustained economic growth, and grants will greatly help accelerate this transition.  Appendix \n4  describes  the  justification  for  the  grant,  and  the  debt  sustainability  issues  in  detail.    The \nGovernment  will  make  the  grant  available  to  DABM  under  the  subsidiary  financing  agreement \nwith  conditions  including  DABM  perform  the  project,  and  write-down  outstanding  debt  of \ngovernment departments in amounts equal to or less than disbursements of the grant.  \n \nG. \n\nSpecial Terms \n\nThe  ADF  lending  terms  approved  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors,  while  generous,  are \n38. \nnot  sufficient  for  sustainable  development.  The  Government  requested  more  concessional \nfunding  for  the  transition  and  reconstruction  phase,  and  ADB  approved  this  request  in  the \nEIRRP (2003) and the Agriculture Sector Program (ASP)15 (2004). It is therefore proposed that \nthe loan be made on concessional terms identical to those of the EIRRP and ASP. These are (i) \ngrandfathering  pre-1999  ADF  lending  terms  so  that  the  loan  has  40-year  maturity  including  a \n                                                 \n13  Eighth  Replenishment  of  the  Asian  Development  Fund  and  Third  Regularized  Replenishment  of  the  Technical \n\nAssistance Special Fund\" (ADF IX Resolution) \n\n14 Paragraph 23 of the ADF Staff Instructions Program, 16, November 2004. \n15  ADB.  2004.

The justification for the proposed loan term is the same as that given in \nthe  EIRRP  and  ASP.  Appendix  4  describes  the  justification  for  special  terms,  and  debt \nsustainability issues in detail.  \n \n39. \nSubstantial continued donor assistance will be required for the recurrent budget over the \nmedium  term.  Recurrent  expenditures  for  FY2005  amount  to  $609  million,  while  revenues  are \nexpected  to  amount  to  about  $256  million,  which  means  that  almost  60%  of  recurrent \nexpenditures  will  have  to  be  financed  by  foreign  assistance.  The  capital  and  development \nbudget for FY2005 of $4,068 million is to be financed entirely by external funding agencies. A \nrecent IMF report16 expressed serious concern about the fiscal sustainability of the Government \npayroll and security expenditures and highlighted the importance of continued assistance from \nexternal funding agencies. \n \nH. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n40.  MEW will be the Executing Agency for the Project, and DABM will be the Implementing \nAgency. The PISU established by MEW will manage day-to-day project implementation. DABM \nwill assign at least one engineer in each project province to supervise the contractors full-time. \nThe implementation consultant will help certify construction progress and issue approvals. The \nDABM  staff  will  report  to  the  project  manager  of  the  PISU.  Appendix  6  shows  the  project \nimplementation organization.  \n \n\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  36  months,  commencing  July  2005.  A  detailed \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n41. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n \nLoan-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n42. \nfor Procurement, by the procurement unit of the Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development \nServices  on  behalf  of  the  MEW,  and  assisted  by  the  implementation  consultants.  The  EA  will \nexecute and administer the contracts as employer. \n \n43. \nContracts  for  design,  installation,  and  construction  of  transmission  lines,  substations, \ndistribution lines, and connection kits will  be divided into contract packages. The electrification \nkits  will  be  procured  under  a  single  turnkey  contract  package.  The  contracts  have  been \npackaged  as  turnkey  (design-build)  contracts  to  ensure  completion  within  the  project \nimplementation  period.  It  is  anticipated  that  all  turnkey  contracts  will  be  awarded  following \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. \n \nConstruction  and  O&M  equipment,  communication  equipment,  and  vehicles  valued  at \n44. \n$0.5  million  or  less  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping,  and  through  international \ncompetitive bidding if above $0.5 million. List of contract packages is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n                                                 \n16 Third Review Under the Staff Monitored Program, Concluding Statement, 3 February 2005. \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n45.  Management  has  approved  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  advance  procurement  action \non the understanding that such approval does not commit ADB to financing the Project. Bidding \ndocuments have been prepared and will be issued by March.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n46. \nConsulting services will be required to help the MEW and DABM implement the Project. \nThe  consulting  services  will  involve  project  management,  detailed  design,  preparation  of  bid \ndocuments,  assistance  in  procurement,  supervision  of  construction  and  installation  of \nequipment,  testing  and  certifying  of  completed  works,  training  of  MEW  and  DABM  staff  in \nmanagement  and  O&M  and  in  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  consultants  will  also  assist  the \nMEW in environmental management and monitoring of social and resettlement safeguards. \n \n47. \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged through an international consulting firm in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  quality- and \ncost-based selection method will be used. A total of 40 person-months of international and 100 \nperson-months  of  domestic  expertise  will  be  required.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 9.  \n \n \n \n48. \nLoan funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nprimarily using direct payment procedures for large turnkey contracts and consulting services, \nand  commitment  procedures  for  supply  and  delivery  contracts.  The  consultants  will  assist  the \nEA in environmental management and monitoring. \n \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n49. \nThe PISU will prepare quarterly progress reports for the project components and submit \nthem ADB to within 6 weeks of the end of each quarter. The reports will describe progress made \nduring  each  period,  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule,  problems  or  difficulties \nencountered  and  the  remedial  actions  taken,  performance  of  the  project  implementation \nconsultants, and work to be carried out in the upcoming period.  \n \n50.  Within 6 months of the closing of each financial year, DABM will submit to ADB annual \nproject accounts and, within 9 months, annual DABM financial statements. The project accounts \nand  financial  statements  will  be  audited  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  the \nauditors\u2019  observations  covering  loan  proceeds  and  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  A  project \ncompletion report will be submitted to ADB within 3 months of project completion. The reports \nwill  review  the  attainment  of  planned  objectives  and  the  achievement  of  the project outputs, \nincluding  costs  and  benefits  derived,  as  well  as  performance  and  contribution  of  all  parties \nassociated with project execution. \n \nDABM will submit to ADB compiled information of billed and collected amounts, grouped \n51. \nby  aging  (outstanding  period),  region,  and  customer  type.  The  report  will  contain  a  list  of  bad \ndebtors,  remedial  actions  taken,  targeted  and  achieved  collection,  and  numbers  of  new \nconnections and disconnections, for each region and each customer type.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 13\n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n52. \nThe  PISU,  with  the  assistance  of  the  implementation  consultants,  will  establish  a \ncomprehensive project performance evaluation and monitoring system acceptable to ADB and \nimplement it by conducting quantitative and qualitative performance monitoring for each project \ncomponent to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the project benefits accrued.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Review \n\n53. \nThe Project will be supervised by ADB through two review missions each year. ADB will \nmonitor implementation of all components through quarterly progress reports. In addition to the \nnormal  periodic  reviews,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  midterm  review  2  years \n(around  June  2007)  after  project  implementation  begins.  The  midterm  review  will  include  a \ndetailed  evaluation  of  project  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  consultation \nwith project-affected people, and achievement of scheduled targets, progress in policy reforms, \nand capacity-building measures. \n \n\n9. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\na. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\n \n54. \nThe  Project  is  classified  under  category  \u201cB\u201d  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental \npolicy  (2002).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared.  Sufficient  community \nconsultations  for  a  category-B  project  were  undertaken  during  project  design.  All  project \ncomponents follow environmental safeguards and technical specifications established for ADB-\nfinanced  projects.  The  Project  has  been  prepared  to  follow  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \nenvironment policy and the relevant parts of the Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). \nThe  summary  IEE  is  in  Appendix  11.  Based  on  the  IEE,  the  Project  will  generate  only  minor \nenvironmental impacts, which can be mitigated by standard measures normally associated with \ninternational  best  practices  in  the  design  and  construction  of  transmission  lines,  substations, \nand  distribution  systems.  An  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  has  been \ndeveloped  and  will  be  implemented  by  MEW.  Mitigation  measures  will  be  specified  in  all \ncontract documents. Any minor environmental impacts will be offset considerably by the benefits \nthat will accrue from the Project.  \n \n55.  MEW is responsible for ensuring that the Project is implemented in an environmentally \nacceptable  manner  in  accordance  with  the  Environmental  Management  and  Monitoring  Plan \n(EMPP).  Since  MEW  has  limited  environmental  capacity,  designated  staff  members  must  be \ntrained  in  environmental  management  and  monitoring  of  power  transmission  and  distribution \nprojects.  An  international  (1.5  person-months)  and  a  local  (3.0  person-months) environmental \nspecialist have been included in the project implementation consultant\u2019s team to train MEW staff \nmembers in environmental management, establish routine environmental monitoring protocols, \nand  undertake  periodic  environmental  monitoring  and  audit  of  construction  works  during \nconstruction.  \n \n\nb. \n\nSocial and Poverty Aspects \n\n \n56. \nThe  project  design  included  a  social  and  poverty  assessment  of  21  districts  in  four \nregions\u2014north  (Sarepul,  Puli-e-Khumri-Kunduz,  Shekhanbandar-Imam  Sahib);  east  (Butkak, \nSurobi-Jalalabad-Mihtarlam);  and  southeast  (Muhammad  Agha-Gardez-Ghazni-Khost).  The \nsurvey team, including MEW staff members, surveyed over 1,100 households across the project \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nregions  and  conducted  town  meetings  in  nine  project  towns.  The  social  and  poverty  survey \nshowed  that  the  communities  prioritized  their  development  needs:  potable  drinking  water, \nelectricity,  educational  facilities,  and  health  facilities.  All  respondents  said  electricity  would \nimprove  children\u2019s  learning  opportunities  as  it  would  replace  kerosene  for  lighting.  Almost  all \nrespondents said electricity would improve livelihoods (98.3%) and health (95.0%). Women are \nexpected to be the main beneficiaries of additional lighting and/or motive power for home-based \nincome-generating  activities  and  improved  indoor  air  quality.  The  survey  established  that \nalthough the main use of electricity was for household lighting, people were willing to invest in \nother  appliances  to  improve  living  conditions  and  livelihoods.  The poverty and social analyses \nare in Appendix 12.  \n \n57. \nAlternative  sources  for  lighting  include  kerosene  or  diesel  lamps,  small  diesel \ngenerators,  and  battery-operated  lights,  and  cost  significantly  more  than  grid  electricity.  It  was \nclear that even the poorest could afford grid-connected electricity more than alternative forms. \nElectricity  will  be  new  to  many  project  beneficiaries,  and  a  safety  awareness  campaign  is \nincluded  in  the  terms  of  reference  of  the  implementation  consultants  (Appendix  9).  The \ncampaign will be conducted via schools, printed materials, community meetings, and the radio. \nSafety information will be included in the connection kits and during local consultation meetings. \n \n58. \nThe Government will work closely with the communities to ensure that men and women \nbenefit equally from the Project. Contractors will be required to ensure equal payment for equal \nwork. MEW\u2019s capacity to implement the social safeguards (resettlement action plan and social \nimpact monitoring) is poor. MEW (with the assistance of the project implementation consultant) \nwill  be  responsible  for  ensuring  on  a  day-to-day  basis  that  the  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring activities identified in the social safeguards are implemented. A PISU member will be \nappointed  as  a  social  safeguard  supervisor,  to  oversee  the  implementation  safeguard  plans, \nand will receive on-the-job training and assistance from the project implementation consultants. \n\nc. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n59. \nAs  the  Project  mainly  involves  restoration,  land  will  be  required  only  temporarily  for \naccess  ways  during  construction.  For  alignment  of  new  transmission  lines,  potential \nresettlement issues will be minimized: where possible, lines will be placed on roadside reserves \nor  on  unused  land.  All  new  substations  will  be  placed  only  on  Government  land.  For  local \ndistribution, poles will follow only local roads, leaving adequate distance for houses, and will not \nobstruct public and private access. All distribution transformers will be pole mounted. As such, \nthe Project is classified under category B.17 \n \n60. \nA  short  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  based  on  consultations  with  the  project-\naffected people and other stakeholders. The plan has been translated into Dari and Pushto, and \ncommunity  meetings  were  held  in  November  and  December  2004  to  explain  it  to  project-\naffected communities. Upon completion of the detailed measurement survey of the line routes, \nspecific  project-affected  people  will  be  informed  about  compensation  rates  based  on  actual \nmarket  rates  at  the  time  of  the  detailed  measurement  survey.  The  finalized  dispute  resolution \nsystem has three stages: (i) complaints by project-affected people on compensation and unpaid \nlosses  may  be  filed  with  their  village  resettlement  committee;  (ii)  if  they  are  not  satisfied  or \nreceive no reply from the committee, the grievance applications will be forwarded to the district \nresettlement  committee;  (iii)  if  the  complainants  are  not  satisfied  with  the  decision,  or  if  the \n\n                                                 \n17 Under 200 people will be displaced from their houses, under 200 people will lose less than 10% of their income-\n\ngenerating assets, and 200 or more people will experience minor impacts. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 15\n\ncommittee does not reply, they can forward their complaints to the committee on compensation, \nwhich will issue the final decision within 30 days. The summary resettlement plan is in Appendix \n13, and the detailed resettlement plan in Supplementary Appendix F. The resettlement plan will \nbe disclosed on the ADB website upon project approval. \n \n\nd. \n\nIndigenous People  \n\n61. \nThe  Project  is  classified  under  category  B.  Although  estimates  vary,  the  ethnic \ncomposition  of  Afghanistan  is  around  38%  Pashtun,  25%  Tajik,  19%  Hazara,  6%  Uzbek,  and \n12% other groups. The social and poverty survey indicated the following composition in project \nareas: 52.0% Pashtun, 35.3% Tajik, 7.0% Uzbek, 2.3% Turkmen, 1.8% Hazara, 0.2% Nuristani, \n0.2% Aimaq, and 0.3% other groups. Ethnic relations have varied with the political climate, but a \ncommon theme has been the notable difference of the Hazaras, who are Sunni Muslims (rather \nthan Shi'a Muslims like the Pashtuns and Tajiks). \n \n62. \nSocioeconomic  change  is  likely  to  result  from  increased  electrification  rates  of \nhouseholds and education sectors with no negative effects. The Project will bring grid power for \nthe first time to areas with high numbers of ethnic minorities, such as Imam Sahib and Sarepul, \nwhile  bringing  equal  benefits  to  the  wider  population  A  small  fund  for  social  development  of \nwomen  and  minorities  will  be  established  to  mitigate  any  negative  impacts  (Supplementary \nAppendix  B).  The  fund  will  assist  up  to  200  project-affected  women  and  poor  minorities.  A \nnongovernment  organization  will  be  contracted  to  monitor  the  resettlement  action  plan  and  to \nuse  it  to  train  project-affected  women  and  minorities  through  a  livelihood  program.  Each \neligible18  household  will  receive  AF3,00019  for  small  businesses  or  alternative  income \ngeneration,  such  as  livestock,  microenterprise,  carpet  weaving.  MEW\u2019s  Environmental  and \nSocial  Impact  Assessment  Office  will  coordinate  the  collection  of  household  baseline  data  to \nmonitor the poverty program and resettlement impact.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n63.  MEW\u2019s  weak  institutional  capability  is  a  major  constraint  on  the  power  sector\u2019s \ndevelopment.  The  ministry  needs  training  in  modern  planning  and  utility  management,  as well \nas information technology and communication facilities. An advisory capacity-building TA will be \nadded to the proposed ADB loan, which will strengthen MEW\u2019s project management, planning, \ndesign,  implementation,  and  O&M  activities  (Appendix  14).  ADB  will  help  develop  practical \ntraining  in  program  management  and  portfolio  review,  and  build  institutions  to  ensure \nsustainability  of  training  operations.  Where  possible,  bilateral  exchange  programs  will  be \ndeveloped with electricity companies in the region to develop role models for Afghan managers. \nThe total TA cost is estimated at $750,000, comprising foreign exchange cost of $680,000 and \nlocal  currency  cost  of  $70,000.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB  TA \nfinancing program. The TA will finance the services of an international consultant and of trainers \nfor 11 person-months on an intermittent basis. They will be engaged individually in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultant will have expertise in capacity \nbuilding and training, and will assess the training needs of MEW and DABM. \n \n\n                                                 \n18 Impacted by the Project (land acquisition or cutting down of trees etc. rather than physical displacement) where the \nhousehold head is either an ethnic minority member or female or both (since these groups are more vulnerable to \npoverty). \n\n19 About $60, a figure determined through consultations in the field as sufficient for small-business set-up costs. \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Assessment \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n64. \nInvestments to rehabilitate and upgrade the utilities\u2019 infrastructure or  to expand supplies \nwill greatly improve the extent and quality of service. In particular, investments to upgrade the \nasset base are expected to increase economic and financial returns. Better quality of supply and \ngreater  access  to  electricity  are  expected  to  reduce  the  cost  of  energy  for  households  and  to \nsupport  productive  activities  (industrial,  commercial,  etc.),  and  thereby  help  meet  the \nGovernment\u2019s growth and poverty reduction objectives. \n \n65.  The  Project\u2019s  economic  analysis  is  based  on  incremental  cost-and-benefit  streams \nassociated  with  each  component,  whose  economic  performance  is  evaluated  by  comparing \nwith-  and  without-project  scenarios.  Revenue  is  based  on  incremental  electricity  sales  to  the \nadditional  customers  to  be  connected  and  financed  under  the  Project.  The  value  of  the \nincreased sales is a measure of project benefits. The value of electricity is derived from the cost \nof  alternate  energy  sources  that  consumers  use.  Incremental  benefit  is  calculated  using \ncustomers\u2019 willingness to pay. The overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is about 33% \n(Appendix 15, Table 15.1). The sensitivity of economic performance to changes in key variables \nhas  been  tested.  In  general,  EIRRs  are  not  sensitive  to  the  variables  tested,  even  for  the \nmultiple downside scenarios. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n66. \nFor financial evaluation, cost streams reflect incremental costs in delivering the benefits \nidentified.  Financial  costs  comprise  costs  of  capital,  incremental  energy,  O&M,  administration \n(particularly  additional  billing),  and  taxation.  Capital  costs  include  physical  contingencies. \nIncremental  energy  costs  are  accrued  to  additional  generation  and  power  purchase  to  be \nsupplied  to  the  project  area.  DABM\u2019s  sources  of  generation  are  mostly  hydro,  but  relatively \ninexpensive power imports will be available to the project area through the transmission lines to \nbe extended by the Project. O&M costs for transmission and distribution systems are estimated \nto be 1.0% and 1.5% of required capital costs.  \n \n67. \nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  Project\u2019s \nincremental  cost-and-benefit  streams.  The  FIRR  after  tax  is  11.8%,  which  is  higher  than  the \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital.  The  FIRR  was  tested  for  sensitivity  to  changes  in  key \nvariables.  The  results  are  summarized  in  Appendix  16,  Table  A.16,  indicating  that  the  overall \nProject is financially feasible. The FIRRs are not sensitive to variables tested, even for multiple \ndownside (combined) scenarios.  \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n\nA  benefit  distribution  analysis  conducted  as  part  of  the  social  and  poverty  survey \n68. \nestimated  the  number  of  beneficiaries  for  each  town  by  extrapolating  the  number  of  poor  for \neach  town,  each  town\u2019s  electrification  rates,  and  customers\u2019  willingness  to  pay  for  electricity. \nThe  results  indicate  that  the  Project  would  directly  benefit  1.2  million  poor  people,  or  95,500 \nhouseholds\u2014about 80% of the target population of 1.5 million.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n 17\n\nRisks \n\nBenefits  to  the  poor  will  be  increased  economic  opportunities  and  improved  health. \n69. \nAppendix 12 shows the calculation for proportion of poor beneficiaries. A distribution analysis of \nproject  benefits  was  carried  out  for  the  affected  groups  identified  as  producers  (DABM), \nunskilled labor (10% of the project cost), the Government, and electricity consumers (90% poor, \nliving below $1 per day). The analysis quantified the incidence of poverty in the project areas by \nusing poverty profiles of different proposed routes, and the result was included in the economic \nviability  of  that  route.  The  poverty  impact  ratios  (PIRs)  for  the  subprojects  were  computed  at \n25%  to  over  100%.  PIRs  are  all  high  primarily  because  the  overwhelming  proportion  of \nelectricity  consumers  in  the  target  area  are  poor,  and  electricity  consumers  are  the  main \nbeneficiaries. PIRs greater than 100% indicate that at least one project-affected group (DABM in \nall cases) faces financial loss in providing positive economic value to consumers. \n \nC. \n \n70. \nThe  overall  political  and  security  situation  remains  volatile  and  uncertain.  Security\u2014\nmobility  restriction  to  and  within  Afghanistan,  and  personal  safety\u2014could  delay  project \nimplementation.  An  interministerial  committee  will  be  established  to  continue  guidance  in  all \naspects of security.  \n \n71.  Weak  implementation  capacity  on  the  part  of  the  government  could  lead  to  delay  in \nimplementation. In addition weak governance structures within government raises the specter of \ncorruption  as  a  risk.  Also  weak  implementation  capacity  in  accounting  and  finances  increases \nthese risks. The risk of delay because of inadequate implementation capacity will be mitigated \nby  training  staff  of  MEW  (in  project  management,  planning)  and  DABM  (in  design, \nimplementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance).    Institutional  reform  required  to  improve  the \nsector\u2019s  sustainability  and  operation  will  be  pursued  under  the  Government\u2019s  Priority  Reform \nand Restructuring program in cooperation with all external funding agencies. \n \nAdequate  investment  in  generation  and  transmission  will  be  ensured  by  coordination \n72. \nwith  other  donor  agencies  and  the  Government  in  a  way  consistent  with  the  power  sector \nmaster plan.  \n \nA further risk is that the allocation of electrification kits may be influenced by corruption. \n73. \nThe Project protects against this risk by requiring a transparent procedure to establish objective \nallocation criteria for the kits. It also establishes a grievance, complaints and dispute resolution \nmechanism for customers receiving kits.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MEW  have  given  the \n\n74. \nfollowing assurances that will be incorporated in the loan agreement. \n \n\n1. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement, and Indigenous People  \n\n75. \nThe  Government  will  update  the  agreed  resettlement  plan  based  upon  a  final  detailed \ndesign and detailed measurement and surveys, and it will be subject to approval by ADB, and \ndisclosed  to  affected  people.  The  Government  will ensure  that  all  land  and  rights-of-way are \nmade  available  to  the  Contractor  and  that  any  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nimplemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations;  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995); and the updated resettlement plan.  \n \n76. \nBy  the  award  of  the  civil  works  contracts,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  a  Fund  for \nSocial  Development  of  Women  and  Ethnic  Minorities  is  established  and  maintained  with  the \nfinancial resources allocated in the budget for the Project from which to finance the mitigation of \nany negative impacts upon women, minorities and indigenous people from the Project. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental \n\nthe  Project  complies  with  applicable \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  preparation,  design,  construction, implementation \n77. \nand  operation  of \nlaws  and  regulations;  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Policy (2002); and all monitoring and mitigation measures in the IEE.   MEW will \nensure that quarterly progress reports on all matters in the EMMP will be forwarded to ADB. The \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  contracts  with  all  civil  works  contractors  include  provisions  that \nrequire the contractors to comply with the EMMP, and to notify MEW (copied to ADB) in writing \nof any environmental issues that are not covered by the EMMP and IEE. \n \n\n \n3. \n\nFinancial \n\n78.  Within 9 months of the Effective Date, the Government will refine its disconnection and \nanti-theft  policy,  including  conditions  of  disconnection,  to  eliminate  non-payment,  start  a \ncustomer awareness campaign, and to develop procedure for survey and inventory of meters to \ndetermine whether the meters are fully operational. Within 12 months of the Effective Date, the \nGovernment  will  have  caused  DABM  to  commence  implementation  of  the  disconnection and \nanti-theft policy. \n \n79. \nThe Government will make an allocation in each annual budget, to ensure that accounts \nreceivables  from  government  departments  on  time,  so  that  DABM  can  maintain  accounts \nreceivable for FY 2007, less than the preceding 6 months\u2019 equivalent of sales, and from 2008, \naccounts receivables less than the preceding 3 months\u2019 equivalent of sales.  \n\n \n4. \n\nInstitutional and Sector Restructuring \n\n80. \nTo ensure the Project\u2019s medium term viability, within 12 months of the Effective Date, the \nGovernment will develop, in a transparent participatory manner that, to the satisfaction of ADB, \na form of regulation by contract for the distribution and transmission of electricity. \n \n81. \nThe  Government  agrees  to  reflect  certain  priorities  and  principles  in  sector  and \ninstitutional  reform,  including  ensuring  autonomy  and  independence  of  DABM,  establishing  an \nindependent  board  (at  least  25%  non-government  representative),  specifying  the  policy  and \nplanning role of MEW; and the operational role of DABM.  \n \n82.  Within  6  months  of  the  Effective  Date,  the  Government  will  establish  fair  allocation \ncriteria  for  electrification  kits,  acceptable  to  ADB  and  allocate  the  kits  accordingly.  The \nGovernment will establish an independent complaint mechanism acceptable to ADB, to address \ncomplaints from stakeholders relating to the allocation of electrification kits. \n \n\n\f \n\n5. \n\nSecurity  \n\n \n\n 19\n\n83. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contracts  contain  requirements  to \nprepare an action plan for adequate security for the smooth uninterrupted implementation of the \nProject; and to undertake demining and the cost of implementing such plan to be included in the \nbudget  for  such  civil  works;  and  such  plan  is  implemented.    Within  2  months  of  loan \neffectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  an  interministerial  steering  committee  for  proper \ncoordination of security issues.  \n \n\n6. \n\nEfficiency Improvements \n\n84.  MEW shall improve its effectiveness by implementing the PRR Program by:(a) 30 June \n2005, establish a skilled task force chaired by the Minister, MEW, to lead and manage the PRR \nProgram; and (b) by 31 December 2005, prepare a detailed proposal, specifying the expected \nefficiency improvements, cost savings, identification, and justification of the positions or tasks, to \nbe placed on the PRR Program pay scale with a full costing of the proposed changes.  \n \nB. \n\nConditions to Effectiveness \n\n85. \n DABM has duly authorized, ratified, executed and delivered the Project Agreement and \nit has become legally binding upon DABM, subject to loan effectiveness; and the Government \nand  DABM  have  duly  authorized,  ratified,  executed  and  delivered  the  Subsidiary  Financing \nAgreement, and it has become legally binding upon DABM and the Government, subject only to \nloan effectiveness. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \n\n86. \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 17.298 million to the \nIslamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Power  Transmission  and  Distribution  Project \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum; a term of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years; and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nFinancing  Agreement  and  draft  Project  Agreement  presented  to  the  Board;  in  addition, \nthe total amount of interest during the grace period will be capitalized;  \n\nin respect of such loan, a variation from the existing loan terms under ADF resources on \nan exceptional basis; and \n\nthe  grant  of  $23.5  million  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Afghanistan  for  the  Power \nTransmission and Distribution Project from the Asian Development Fund, in accordance \nwith the terms and conditions set forth in the draft Financing Agreement and draft Project \nAgreement  presented  to  the  Board,  and  subject  to  the  condition  that  ADB  has,  in \naccordance with the provisions of Resolution No. 300 of the Board of Governors and as \ndetermined by the President, sufficient resources to finance the grant.  \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n17 March 2005 \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance \nIndicators/Targets \n\nMonitoring Mechanisms \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n\n \n\n \n\nImproved and cost-effective \npower supply to all \nconsumers  \n\nIncrease consumption per \ncapita from 21 kWh per year to \n30 kWh by 2010  \n\nNational and regional \nstatistics  \n\n20 \n\nAppendix 1     \n\nDesign Summary \n\nA.

Afghanistan  is  well  endowed  with  hydropower,  natural \ngas, and coal. Some estimates put hydropower potential at 25,000 megawatts (MW), of which \n5,000  MW  are  inside  Afghanistan  and  the  rest  on  the  border  of  Amu  Darya.    Hydropower  the \nkey sources (about 75% of total) of power supply in Afghanistan: the main dams are Kajakai in \nHelmand  Province  near  Kandahar,  Mahipar  and  Breshna-Kot  in  Nangarhar  Province  near \nJalalabad, and Dahla in Kandahar Province. Kabul is fed by three hydroelectric power stations, \nwith a combined output of 80 MW (nameplate rating of 188 MW).  \n \n2. \nThe  total  generation  capacity  has  declined  from  about  456  MW  in  1990s  to  about  250 \nMW. Only about 6\u20139% of the population has access to power, of whom approximately 30% are \nin Kabul. The other provinces have even less access, with rural areas being virtually unserved. \nBefore the conflict in 1980, power transmission lines comprised about 140 circuit-kilometers and \nabout  1,080  circuit-kilometers  of  220  kilovolt  (kV)  and  110  kV  transmission  lines,  respectively. \nMany were destroyed during the war and only some 110 kV are now operating. The damaged \n220  kV  lines  have  been  downgraded  to  operate  at  110 kV  while  some  damaged  110  kV  lines \nnow operate at 35 kV.  \n \nB. \n\nDemand Scenarios \n\n3. \nEnergy demand forecasts have been made by the ongoing studies on the power sector \nmaster  plan  (up  to  2020)  and  the  gas  development  master  plan  (up  to  2025).  The  power \ndemand forecast is based on adjusted actual energy sales of 2002. Adjusted demand includes \nthe  suppressed  demand,  which  is  around  75%  of  the  energy  supplied.  In  the  basic  forecast, \nenergy demand is assumed to reach 3,861 GWh in 2020, giving an average annual growth rate \nof 6.3%. In the high forecast, energy demand is assumed to reach 5,640 GWh in 2020, or 46% \nhigher than the basic forecast, implying an average growth rate of 8.2%.  \n \n4. \nThe  present  peak  load  is  assumed  around  215  MW  for  all  of  Afghanistan.  Adding  a \nsuppressed  demand  assumed  to  be  138  MW,  the  peak  load  starting  point  for  the  forecasts  is \n363 MW. In the basic forecast, the peak load is assumed to increase to 911 MW in 2020. This \ngives an average annual growth rate of 5.2%. The growth rate for the peak load is somewhat \nlower  than  the  growth  rate  for  energy  demand  since  the  load  factor  is  assumed  to  increase \nduring the forecast period. In the high forecast the peak load is assumed to increase to 1,316 \nMW in 2020. This gives an average annual growth rate of 7.4%. \n \nC. \n\nSupply Options \n\n1. \n\nBusiness as Usual \n\n5. \nBusiness  as  usual  assumes  that  the  existing  practices  of  energy  development  will \ncontinue without any changes in strategy. Development of known hydropower, natural gas, oil, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n23 \n\nand coal reserves will continue; indigenous hydropower, natural gas, and coal will be used for \npower  generation;  no  program  on  energy  conservation  will  be  initiated;  and  development  and \nmanagement  of  biomass  fuels  will  continue  without  any  linkages  with  commercial  energy \ndevelopment program. The gap between projected demand and indigenous supply can only be \nreduced  with  serious  exploration  program;  else  the  gap  will  have  to  be  met  from  imported \nsources.  \n \n\n2. \n\nReference Option \n\n6. \nAdditional  issues  included  in  reference  option  are  (i)  enhancement  of  exploration, \nappraisal,  and  extraction  of  indigenous  nonrenewable  energy  resources;  (ii)  implementation  of \neffective programs to conserve energy; and (iii) integration of commercial energy and biomass \nfuels program to maintain sustainable supply of biomass fuels. Exploration and appraisal of oil \nand  natural  gas  will  be  enhanced;  development  of  hydropower,  natural  gas,  and  coal  will \ncontinue; new and renewable energy sources will be harnessed; a program will be undertaken \nto  conserve  commercial  energy  and  biomass  fuels;  and  development  of  biomass  fuels  will  be \nconsidered along with the development of commercial energy sources. \n \nA business-as-usual scenario would put a strain on the economy with a sharp increase \n7. \nin  energy  demand.  It  would  require  additional  fuel  because  of  a  lack  of  energy  conservation \nmeasures,  and  may  cause  severe  environmental  degradation  due  to  overexploitation  of \nbiomass fuels. The analysis used the reference option.  \n \n8. \nThe  Government\u2019s  power  sector  master  plan  estimates  over  $1.5  billion  for  the \nrecommended generation and transmission development plan up to 2020, whereas, the World \nBank estimates a requirement of about $1.9 billion on generation and transmission alone for the \nnext 7 years. Distribution will require another $800 million, as per the master plan.  \n \nD. \n\nSector Road Map and Sustainability \n\n9. \nThe Government has developed a detailed road map for the power sector (Table A2.1). \nIn  the  preparatory  phase,  focus  will  be  on  capacity  building,  improvement  of  billing  and \ncollection, theft control, and development of a master plan. So far the Government has met its \ntargets.  In  the  medium  term  (2005\u20132007)  the  focus  will  be on  developing  a  power  sector  law, \nestablishing  independent  regulation,  separating  generation  from  distribution;  commercializing \nKabul  Distribution  Company,  and  finalizing  key  transmission  infrastructure.  The  longer-term \ntarget is establishment of national transmission grid and increase access to 75% of households. \n \n10. \nThe power sector\u2019s ability to provide sustainable economic and social benefits will need \nreliable infrastructure (investment in power generation, transmission, and distribution); capable \ninstitutions; and appropriate cost recovery. While in other countries investment in infrastructure \nis  not  an  essential  precondition  for  sustainability,  without  investments,  the  power  sector  of \nAfghanistan  will  not  be  able  to  deliver  basic  services  to  existing  consumers.

In January 2003, the 45 MW northwest Kabul \nplant  was  recommissioned,  almost  doubling  the  available  capacity  for  Kabul  during  the  peak \nwinter hours. This project is scheduled for completion in 2005. \n \n3. \nIn  June  2004,  IDA  approved  a  new  $200-million  project  (of  which  IDA  funding  is  $100 \nmillion) which would finance investments in distribution and generation in addition to substantial \nTA to commercialize the operations of Afghanistan Electricity Authority (DABM) The project will \nsupport  the  overall  reform  of  the  sector  but  will  focus  largely  on  distribution.    It  will  help \nreorganize the utility on a commercial basis while addressing the sector\u2019s enormous investment \nneeds. The project will help finance the rehabilitation and expansion of distribution networks in \nKabul  and  several  other  cities  and  will  provide  support  to  improve  the  commercial  and \nmanagement aspects of DABM.   \n \nB. \n \n4. \nKfW  is  implementing  four  projects  with  funding  from  Germany,  European  Commission, \nand  Afghanistan  Reconstruction  Trust  Fund  (ARTF)  for  a  total  of  \u20ac46.65  million.    The  first \nproject is the rehabilitation of Kabul Region Electric Grid (phase 1) for \u20ac16.1 million. This project \ninvolved  (i)  a  street-lighting  component,  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  the  110  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission \nline from Sarobi to Breshna Kot, (iii) the 15(20) kV overhead lines (Breshna Kot to Junctions I \nand  III),  (iv)  rehabilitation  of  the  Breshna  Kot  substation,  and  (v)  the  rehabilitation  of  the \nmedium-  and  low-voltage  distribution  network.    The  second  project  is  phase  2  of  the \nrehabilitation of Kabul Region Electric Grid (KfW Mandate from the European Commission) for a \ntotal of \u20ac9 million.  This involves four lots technically similar to the first phase: street lighting, 110 \nkilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line  from  Breshna  Kot  to  Kabul  east,  substations  Breshna  Kot \n(extension) and Kabul east (reconstruction), and medium- and low-voltage distribution network.  \nThis project is scheduled for completion 2004.  \n \n5. \nThe third project involves the rehabilitation of the Mahipar and Sarobi hydropower plants, \nwhich  serve  Kabul  for  a  total  of  \u20ac15  million.  The  supply  and  erection  contract  will  come  into \nforce in December 2003. The work will go on during 2004, with work on the second Sarobi unit \nextending to 2005. The fourth committed project is a KfW Mandate from ARTF for \u20ac6.55 million \n($7.4  million)  to  complete  some  of  the  above  projects:  hydropower  plant  rehabilitation,  city \ndistribution network, and 110 kV transmission lines.  On the technical assistance side, KfW has \nseconded a long-term adviser to the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW).  GTZ has seconded \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\na  long-term  adviser  to  build  capacity  in  the  power  utility,  DABM,  specifically  in  the  Kabul \nElectricity Department. \n \nC. \n \n\nUSAID \n\nGovernment of Iran \n\n6. \nUSAID  is  providing  technical  assistance  to  MEW  under  the  Economic  Governance \nProject,  which  covers  institutional  strengthening  and  restructuring  of  MEW,  design  of  a \nregulatory framework and new sector law, and includes the funding of a resident advisor.  The \nGovernment  of  the  United  States  is  providing  approximately  $80.0  million  as  part  of  the  $1.2 \nbillion  funding  package  for  Afghanistan  Relief  and  Reconstruction  over  the  next  year.  The \ncritical USAID interventions in the sector include provision of fuel supplies for Kabul, Jalalabad, \nand Kandahar. USAID is committed to finance rehabilitation of the power generation stations in \nKajakai and Darunta, and the power generation plant near Kabul.  \n \nD. \n \n7. \nIran  provided  some  bilateral  assistance  to  the  power  sector.  The  completed  projects \ninclude low-voltage transmission lines from Iran to Zaranj in Nimroz Province and from Iran to \nHerat at an estimated cost of $2.5 million, and the construction of a high-voltage transmission \nline from Iran to Herat at an estimated cost of $14.0 million.  \n \nE. \n \nThe  Government  of  India  has  actively  supported  the  power  sector.  Recently  a  team \n11. \nsuccessfully  completed  the  design  and  survey  of  Kabul  to  the  Pul-e-Khumri  line  through  the \nSilang bypass.  \n\nGovernment of India \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n\nJUSTIFICATION FOR SPECIAL LOAN TERMS AND ADF GRANT \n \n\nA.  Background \n\n \nAfghanistan  has  made  significant  progress  since  the  ouster  of  the  Taliban  regime.  The \n1. \nGovernment  has  implemented  a  wide  range  of  structural  reforms  and  adhered  to  almost  all \nquantitative indicators and structural benchmarks under the Staff-Monitored Program, led by the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  Notwithstanding  these  achievements  and  double-digit \neconomic growth over the last 2 years, the country is economically and fiscally fragile. Security, \neconomic, social, and administrative challenges are formidable. The country continues to need \nexternal development finance that does not fiscally burden the nascent administration.  \n \n\n1. \n\nDebt Sustainability \n \n\n2. \nAt  the  Berlin  Donor  Conference  in  March  2004,  the  Government  presented  its \ndevelopment strategy\u2014Securing Afghanistan's Future: Accomplishments and the Strategic Path \nForward.  The  strategy  argues  that  an  average  of  9%  growth  per  annum  of  the  nondrug \neconomy:  10\u201315%  in  the  short  term  and  7-9%  in  the  long  term)  is  needed  visibly  improve \neconomic and social conditions while gradually eliminating the drug economy. Total financing of \n$31.8  billion  is  needed  until  2010  to  raise  Afghanistan  to  an  annual  per  capita  gross  domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  of  about  $500  by  2015,  including  an  external  financing  requirement  of  $27.6 \nbillion over 7 years. Substantial continued external funding agencies assistance will be required \nfor  the  recurrent  budget  over  the  medium  term.  Recurrent  expenditures  for  FY2005  amount  to \n$609  million  while  revenues  are  expected  to  amount  to  about  $256  million,  which  means  that \nalmost 60% of recurrent expenditures will have to be financed by foreign assistance. The capital \nand  development  budget  for  FY2005  of  $4,068  million  is  to  be  financed  entirely  by  external \nfunding  agencies.  In  a  recent  report,  IMF  expressed  serious  concern  about  the  fiscal \nsustainability  of  the  Government  payroll  and  security  expenditures  and  highlighted  the \nimportance of continued external funding agencies\u2019 assistance.  \n \n \n\nGovernment and External Funding Agencies\u2019 Strategies \n \n\n2. \n\n3. \nThe high growth rates since the end of the conflict have been fuelled primarily by external \nfunding agencies-supported relief and construction activities as well as by the temporary end to \nthe drought. However, to achieve growth targets over the medium term and to gradually replace \nopium production, the Government must aim for broad-based and sustainable development and \nidentify  new  drivers  of  growth.  Investment  in  the  power  sector  is  a  prerequisite  for  sustained \neconomic growth, and grants will greatly help accelerate this transition. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  is  a  central  instrument  of  the  international \n4. \ncommunity  for  reducing  poverty  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region.  ADF  represents  an  effective \npartnership  between  the  international  community,  Asian  Development  Bank,  and  ADF  client \ncountries.  The  ADF  IX  replenishment  features  a  new  grant  program.  The  external  funding \nagencies  agreed  that  the  concessional  assistance  could  be  used  to  help  poor  countries \naccelerate  their  transition  from  post-conflict  situations  to  peace  and  stability.  Afghanistan\u2019s \ncondition  clearly  qualifies  it  for  grant  funding.  Prolonged  conflict  has  endangered  the  poor, \ndestroyed their economic opportunities, damaged basic infrastructure, and disrupted delivery of \nbasic services to the neediest. Access to a reliable power source is a prerequisite for sustained \neconomic  growth,  and  grants  can  accelerate  such  growth.  The  Project  will  increase  access  to \npower by rehabilitating distribution systems and providing electrification kits. \n \n\n\fAppendix  4 \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nProject Intervention:  Sustainable Post Conflict Ground \n\n \n5. \nThe social and poverty survey noted that the average cost of connection per household \nis  $31,  including  the  line  from  the  distribution  network  to  the  household  and  the  tariff  meter. \nAlthough the survey noted that people were willing to pay, the beneficiaries will probably not be \nable  to  afford  such  a  high  one-time  connection  and  the  internal  wiring  costs  for  lighting  and \npower points. Internal wiring must be done properly to mitigate fire hazards.  \n \n6. \nThe  Project  will  distribute  approximately  18,000  electrification  kits  costing  about \n$740,000.1 The kits will include a standard meter, two compact fluorescent lights, and a double \npower point, which can be used for small appliances such as radios, fans, etc. Wiring, sockets, \nand power points are necessary to use the electricity. \n \n7. \nIt  is  difficult  to  determine  selection  criteria  by  physical  household  characteristic  (most \nhouses  look  the  same  and  access  by  strangers  is  problematic  and  time-consuming),  land \nownership (no credible records exist), or income (variable by season and not well understood by \nstakeholders  themselves).  Beneficiaries  will  be  advised  that  connection  kits  are  available  and \nwill be at cost charged through tariff. The kits will allow immediate connection. If this approach \n(as a pilot) is successful, assistance may provide more kits. \n \n8. \nShould  demand  for  connection  kits  exceed  supply,  preference  should  be  given  to \nhouseholds  with  children,  since  the  most  immediate  benefit  of  electrification  is  lighting,  which \nhelps children studying at home. Should further criteria be required, it is suggested that female-\nheaded  households  and  similarly  socially  disadvantaged  households  (ethnic  minorities, \nphysically  disabled,  etc.)  be  selected  with  assistance  from  local  leaders.  Detailed  selection \ncriteria will be developed by the implementation consultants in consultation with the Government \nand other stakeholders. \n \n9. \nInstallation  by  the  turnkey  contractor  should  take  advantage  of  Afghanistan  Electricity \nAuthority  (DABM)  staff  and  other  local  labor,  and  will  include  basic  instructions  on  safe  use  of \nelectricity.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Estimate based on supply of 18,000 kits at $41 per kit. \n\n\f 30           Appendix   5\n\nProject Component\n\nA.

The  financial  accounts  of  the  Afghanistan  Electricity  Authority  (DABM) \n1. \nbefore 2001 were destroyed during the war, and only the last 2 years\u2019 profit-and-loss accounts \nare  available.  Adjustments  are  needed  because  assets  and  depreciation  costs  have  not  been \ncaptured correctly. After preliminary adjustments,1 the revised DABM loss as of 20 March 2004 \nwould amount to AF1,300 million (about $30 million)\u2014more than 10 times the reported loss of \nAF63.8  million  (about  $1.4  million).  This  discrepancy  results  from  depreciation  based  on \nvaluation of assets and bad-debt provisions. Current low depreciation will inflate taxable income \nwhen  the  cash  flow  is  positive.  A  proper  asset  register  is  urgently  required  to  know  DABM\u2019s \nfinancial position. \n \n2. \nDABM\u2019s  financial  position  has  improved  marginally  despite  revision  of  tariff  rates  by \nmore than 100% in March 2003. Revenues increased by 88% but most profit has been wiped \nout by the operation of costly Kabul northwest gas turbine power plant. The fuel cost alone is 12 \ncents/kWh,  which  is  much  higher  than  DABM\u2019s  average  tariff  of  3.5  cents/kWh.  High \ntransmission and distribution losses of 35\u201340% have increased generation and power purchase \ncosts, and shortage of power has further reduced revenue. The overall cost recovery as of 20 \nMarch 2004 is estimated at only 51%, with overall average tariff of 3.5 cents/kWh and average \ncost of supply of 7.0 cents/kWh.  \n\n3. \nTariff.  DABM  has  a  location-specific  tariff,  with  no  uniform  national  tariff.  These  tariff \nrates vary widely depending on the source of power. Hydro-based Kabul and Kandahar have an \naverage  domestic  tariff  of  around  2  cents/kWh,  while  Mazar-e-Sharif  and  Herat,  which rely on \nimported  energy  and  diesel  generation,  have  tariffs  more  than  twice  and  four  times, \nrespectively.  Tariffs  have  three  customer  categories:  domestic,  governmental,  and  other,2 \nallowing cross-subsidization for domestic customers. In Kabul, domestic tariffs are divided into \nthree  brackets  depending  on  consumption,  but  most  domestic  customers  are  in  the  lowest \nconsumption bracket of below 600 kWh per 2 months. \n\nCash Flow. DABM manages cash shortage resulting from spare parts and fuel costs of \n4. \nKabul northwest gas turbine power plant funded by the World Bank and United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  (USAID).  Investment  funds  have  been  heavily  dependent  on \nGovernment  support  through  donor  communities.  Until  FY2003,  even  salaries  of DABM staff \nwere  paid  from  the  MEW  budget.  The  cash  collection  rate  is  about  only  60\u201370%. Billing and \ncollection  are  based  either  on  customers\u2019  own  readings  or  on  bimonthly  meter  readings  by  a \nlimited  number  of  meter  readers.  The  German  Development  Cooperation  through  GTZ  and \nUSAID have supported pilot programs to improve billing and collection efficiency of DABM.  \n\n                                                 \n1 Depreciation cost for FY2004 at DABM was AF897, 000 (approximately $20,000). For a realistic opening balance, \nthe  depreciated  replacement  cost  method  was  used  for  valuation  of  existing  fixed  assets.  The  following  key \nassumptions were used: (i) for distribution and generation, the asset\u2019s age assumed was to be 30 years;  (ii) out-of-\nservice  assets  have  been  assigned  zero  value;  (iii)  buildings,  vehicles ,  spares,  etc.  are  assumed  to  be  fully \ndepreciated; and (iv) meters are assumed to be paid for and owned by customers (assigned zero value). \n\n2  Government  customers  include  ministries  and  other  central  and  provincial  administrative  authorities,  schools, \nhos pitals,  jails,  military  installations,  and  commercial  activities  owned  or  controlled  by  the  Government,  such  as \nhotels, etc. Other customers are mostly commercial establishments, industry, shops, etc. \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n37 \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Performance Improvement \n\nFour  key  drivers  would  quickly  improve  DABM\u2019s  financial  performance:  expansion  of \n5. \ncapacity  to  meet  increasing  demand;  efficiency  improvement  in  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution;  improvement  of  billing  and  collection  system;  and  tariff  increase  to  improve  cost \nrecovery.  \n\n6. \nCapacity. Alternative, cheaper power must be generated or imported, and transmission \nand distribution capacity must be expanded and rehabilitated to meet demand. Rehabilitation of \nhydro  power  plants  is  expected  to  increase  capacity  but  will  not  be  enough  to  meet  growing \ndemand  for  electricity.  Full  operation  of  the  trunk  transmission  line  from  Termez  via  Pul-e-\nKhumri  to  Kabul  is  expected  to  enable  MEW  and  DABM  to  import  power  from  neighboring \ncountries to meet demand in the northern and eastern regions. \n\nEfficiency.  The  operational  efficiency  of  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution \n7. \nnetwork  needs  to  be  improved  immediately.  High  losses,  suboptimal  dispatch,  and  expensive \ndiesel generation are the key contributors to the high cost of supply. \n\nBilling and Collection.  DABM\u2019s  uncollected  revenues  (around  AF1,300  million  or  $30 \n8. \nmillion as of the end of October 2004) are mostly owed by Government sector customers (e.g., \nministries,  jails,  the  military,  police,  etc).  To  enable  DABM  to  recover  its  arrears3  and \nconsistently  collect  the  billed  amounts,  the  Government  will  make  a  budget  appropriation  to \nensure  timely  payment  so  that,  from  20  March  2007  onward,  DABM  can  maintain  accounts \nreceivable  from  all  customers  equivalent  to  less  than  the  preceding  3  months\u2019  of  sales. The \nGovernment will issue a policy against theft and on disconnection, and DABM will be vigilant in \norder to minimize nontechnical losses. \n\n9. \nCost Recovery.  The  rationalization  of  tariff  to  meet  full  cost  recovery  must  consider \nsocial impacts on customers who consume the least (55% of total consumers in Kabul), adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  of  using  alternative  energy  with  pollution  risks,  and  operational  and \nfinancial  sustainability  of  DABM.  Ongoing  and  future  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  hydro \nplants  and  the  increase  of  inexpensive  power  imports  are  expected  to  gradually  improve  the \ncost  recovery  of  DABM,  and  that  the  transmission  line  from  Uzbekistan  to  Kabul  can  largely \nrelease  suppressed  demand  around  the  northern  and  eastern  regions  and  cause  a  financial \nturnaround.  However,  an  indicative  financial  projection  of  DABM  (Table  A10)  suggests  that \nDABM  should  increase  Kabul-based  tariff4  by  10%  annually  for  the  next  3  to  4  years  so  that \nDABM can maintain full cost recovery after the turnaround, retain enough free cash flow to carry \nout  its  operations  and  self-financing  investments,  and  obtain  long-run  financial  sustainability \n(Supplementary Appendix F presents a detailed financial projection of DABM).  \n\n                                                 \n3 By 30 June 2005, the Government and DABM will finalize a settlement scheme for overdue amounts for FY2005 \n\nfrom Government departments and enterprises.  \n\n4   As of 20 March 2004, the average domestic tariff in Kabul (including Nangarhar, Parwan, Ghori [except Kunduz], \nand  Kandahar)  was  around  AF1.0/kWh  (2  cents/kWh).  Assuming  10\u201320%  annual  increases  on  that  tariff  for  3 \nyears from FY2006, the required domestic tariff would be AF1.3\u20131.8/kWh in nominal terms.    \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n \n\nTable A10: Indicative Financial Performance of  \nAfghanistan Electricity Authority (DABM) \n\n51\n(55)\n4.0\n\u2014a\n\u2014a\n\u2014\n\nFiscal Year (Ending 20 March) \nFinancial Indicators \nCost recovery  \nAverage return of assets \nReceivables' collection \n\nLong-term debt\u2013equity ratio  \n\nDebt service coverage ratio \n\nUnit \n \n% \n% \nmonths  \n\n% \n\n \n\n2004  2005  2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008 \n\n2009 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2010  2011 \n \n\n \n\n70\n(20)\n4.0\n\n5\n\n\u2014\n\n80\n(12)\n3.5\n\n51\n\n\u2014\n\n82\n5\n3.0\n\n76\n\n54\n\n110\n3\n3.0\n\n74\n\n24\n\n108\n2\n3.0\n\n72\n\n17\n\n96\n1\n3.0\n\n71\n\n12\n\n100 \n2 \n3.0 \n\n70 \n\n12 \n\n% \nSelf-financing ratio \n\u2014 = not available, AF = Government of Afghanistan currency unit, kWh = kilowatt hour  \na    The  average  domestic  tariff  only  in  the  regions  of  Kabul  (including  regions  of  Nangarhar,  Parvan,  Ghori  [except \n\n20\n\n26\n\n13\n\n\u2014\n\n7\n\n8\n\n31 \n\nKunduz], and Kandahar), which average is AF1/kWh (2 cents/kWh).     \n\nb DABM had no long-term debt service. \nSource: ADB Staff estimates. \n \n10. \nIn  case  MEW  and  DABM  cannot  implement  planned  investment  projects  and  power \nimports  on  time,  and  fail  to  improve  billing  and  collection  as  well  as  cost  recovery,  the \nGovernment may be required to continue sizable financial support to DABM. \n\nC. \n\nFinancial Management \n\n \nAccounting.  DABM\u2019s  accounting  system  is  manual,  on  a  cash  basis,  so  processing  is \n11. \nslow  and  accounting  records  are  erroneous.  The  records  of  assets  (e.g.,  fixed  assets  and \ninventories) have not been maintained on time or correctly. Historical records are lacking. As a \nresult,  the  depreciation  charges  in  income  statements  seem  too  low.  Since  MEW  manages \ninvestment  and  construction,  and  DABM  conducts  operation  and  maintenance  only  after \ncompletion  of  facilities,  the  separation  of  responsibilities  may  lead  to  misrepresentation  of \naccounting  information.  Government  received  technical  assistance  from  the  World  Bank5 for \nreconstruction  of  the  asset  registers,  development  of  proper  financial  statements,  accounting \naudit and installation accounting system and financial management.  \n\n12. \nFinancial  Autonomy.  Government\u2019s  financial  assistance  to  the  power  sector  (e.g., \ninvestment and partial fuel cost) has sustained DABM\u2019s operations and finance, DABM has little \nincentive for cost cutting and efficiency improvement, as responsibilities are shared with MEW. \nCredit control and inventory management are almost nonexistent in DABM. Separation of policy \n(MEW)  and  operation  (DABM)  roles  are  pre-requisite  for  improving  autonomy An independent \nboard, appropriate license and a charter for its operation are immediate priority. \n\n                                                 \n5 Emergency Power Rehabilitation Project, approved in May 2004.  \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n39 \n\nENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n\nIntroduction  \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \n The Project\u2019s initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out by the Ministry of Energy \nand  Water  (MEW),  the  Executing  Agency.  The  Project  is  classified  under  environment  category  B. \nThe  IEE  involved  analysis  of  data  collected  through  review  of  reports,  maps,  etc.;  discussions  with \ninterested parties; and field visits to proposed project areas. \n \nB. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n1.  Physical Resources \n\n \n\n2. \nIn  the  north,  the  transmission  line  routes  traverse  the  fertile  floodplains  of  the  Kunduz  and \nAmudaryu rivers (<300 meters [m] elevation) and their adjacent hinterland comprising a rolling, loess-\ncovered piedmont plain (300\u2013400 m elevation). In the central eastern area, the routes traverse alpine \nareas  comprising  deeply  dissected  mountains  (1,800\u20134,700  m  above  sea  level  [asl])  and \nintermountain basins (500\u20131,800 m asl).  \n \nThe  northern  area  consists  mainly  of  quaternary  conglomerates,  sand,  and  loess,  with \n3.. \nscattered inliers of tertiary limestone overlain by thick (5\u201320 m) and generally fertile, sandy soils. The \ncentral  eastern  region  comprises  tertiary  sedimentary  rocks  and  volcanic  overlying  Mesozoic  and \nPaleozoic  sandstones,  limestone,  and  schist.  Mountainous  areas  of  the  central  eastern region have \nthin soils (0.5\u20135.0 m) of rubble and sandy loam. Low-lying areas of the plateau have thicker soils of \nloam and sandy loam, or sand and gravel in the case of river valleys. The region is seismically active, \nwith a history of strong earthquakes. \n \nThe project areas have a dry continental climate, with four distinct seasons and wide annual \n4. \nand daily temperature fluctuations, which varies according to elevation. Rainfall is greatest in winter \nand spring. Summers are typically hot and dry and winters are cool or cold depending on elevation. \nWater resources in the northern area are generally plentiful due to the proximity and reliable perennial \nflows  of  Amudaryu  and  Kunduz  rivers.  The  Kabul  River  and  its  tributaries  drain  the  central  eastern \nregion,  with  their  flows  derived  entirely  from  rainfall  and  seasonal  snow  melt  of  the  surrounding \nmountains.  Surface  water  is  limited,  with  peak  flows  in  spring,  and  sporadic  or  nonexistent  flows  in \nmany watercourses in summer. \n \n\n2.  Ecological Resource s \n\n \nIn the north, natural vegetation consists of grasses that dry out in summer, and sparse shrubs. \n5. \nArable  lands  along  the  bottoms  of  basins  and  valleys  are  cultivated  with  grain  (wheat,  rice)  and \nvegetables. Orchards and vineyards occur near the towns. Woody plants at higher elevations in the \nnorth  comprise  sparse  wild  pistachio,  almond,  and  juniper  woodland  with  tree  heights  of  4\u201310 m. \nBottomlands of the Amudaryu River contain riparian forests consisting of dense thickets of reeds and \nshrubs as well as timber stands of elm or wild olive and poplar 5\u201312 m tall. The Amudaryu River area \nis  home  to  the  Eurasian  otter  (Lutra  lutra),  wild  boar,  and  the  endangered  Bactrian  deer  (Cervus \nelaphus bactrianus) as well as waterbirds and birds of prey. \n \n6. \nIn  the  central  eastern  region,  natural  vegetation  in  the  valleys  and  intermountain  basins \nconsists  of  drought-resistant grasses (sagebrush, needle grass) with patches of sparse shrubs with \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\noccasional  juniper  and  wild  pistachio.  In  the  mountains  around  Charikar  and  Bamyan,  vegetation \ncomprises  mixed  grass  meadows,  which  die  off  during  late  summer.  South  and  east  of  Kabul,  the \ntransmission line alignments generally traverse arid areas of minimal natural vegetation. Arable lands \nin the basins and valleys are cultivated with wheat, corn, beans, and other vegetables. Orchards and \nvineyards occur near the towns. \n \n7. \nSmall-scale  industries  exist  in  the  main  centers,  primarily  producing  goods  for  domestic \nconsumption\u2014i.e.  wheat,  flour,  bread,  meat,  preserved  fruits,  sugar,  salt,  plastic  bags,  toilet  paper, \netc.  Natural  gas  has  been  a  valuable  export  commodity  in  the  past,  and  potential  exists  for  further \nexploitation,  including  mineral  deposits  such  as  iron,  barites,  talc,  mica,  copper,  and  semiprecious \nstones. Some small- to medium-scale manufacturing enterprises exist, such as leather working and \ncarpet  making.    During  the  years  of  conflict,  opium  poppy  has  increasingly  replaced  wheat  as  the \nmost significant autumn-sown cash crop in the southwest and eastern provinces. \n \n\n3.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \nScreening of potential environmental impacts of the Project was based on ADB\u2019s Checklist of \n8. \nEnvironmental  Parameters  for  Power  Transmission  Lines  Projects.  No  significant  environmental \neffects will result from this project.  In addition, land acquisition and resettlement will be minimized by \navoiding settlements and buildings and minimizing the need to acquire agricultural land. The Project \nwill not encroach upon precious ecological areas or block wildlife passages.  It will generally traverse \narid areas of minimal vegetation or farmland along river valleys.  All transmission and distribution lines \nas well as substations have been designed to avoid ecologically sensitive areas.  \n \nMinor  encroachment  into  farmland  along  some  sections  of  the  rehabilitated  and  new \n9. \ntransmission  lines,  due  to  the  location  of  towers  and  temporary  access  roads,  is  unavoidable. \nHowever,  the  Project  will  ensure  that  such  impacts are minimized through careful route selection to \navoid  siting  towers  on  farmland  wherever  possible  and  making  use  of  existing  tower  footings  and \naccess  roads.  Farmers  will  be  able  to  use  agricultural  land  along  the  transmission  line  right-of-way. \nTrees along the right-of-way will need to be trimmed or removed to maintain a minimum vertical safe \nclearance between the conductors and the trees. Compensation will be paid for any loss of trees and \ntemporary and permanent loss of agricultural production during project implementation, in accordance \nwith the compensation policy outlined in the resettlement action plan. \n \n10.  Minor disruption to farming activities and disturbance of crops, bunds, canals and drains could \noccur  during  construction  and  line  maintenance  activities.  To  minimize  such  impacts,  established \nroads  and  tracks  will  be  used  wherever  possible,  compensation  will  be  paid  for  temporary  loss  in \nagricultural production in accordance with the resettlement action plan (RAP), topsoil will be protected \nand  reinstated  after  construction  is  completed,  damaged  bunds  and  irrigation  facilities  will  be \nreinstated after construction completed, and irrigation facilities will be maintained in working condition \nthroughout project implementation. \n \n11. \nUncontrolled  soil  erosion  and  silt  run-off  are  likely  to  be  minor  due  to  the  limited  amount  of \nexcavation required for towers and dry climate. In addition, measures to minimize erosion and silt run-\noff will be incorporated into contract documents. \n \n12. \nSubstations  will  be  sited  and  designed  to  ensure  that  noise  will  not  be  a  nuisance.  Noise \ngenerated  by  construction  activities  will  be  of  short  duration  in  predominantly  rural  locations,  and  is \nconsidered  insignificant.  Other  nuisances  from  construction  activities  will  be  mitigated  through \ncontract  clauses  specifying  careful  construction  practices  and  compensation  paid  for  any  losses  in \nagricultural production. Escape of polluting materials such as oil and sewage from construction camps \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n41 \n\nand substations will be prevented through design and installation of appropriate oil containment and \nsewerage systems.  \n \n13. \nHealth hazards from potential explosions or fire, electric shocks, and accidents to staff and the \ngeneral  public  will  be  mitigated  during  implementation  by  the  following  measures:  careful  designs \nusing  appropriate  technologies  to  minimize  hazards;  safety  awareness  raising  for  construction  and \noperational staff and the public; substations equipped with modern fire control systems; provision of \nadequate  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities  for  substations  and  construction  camps;  provision  of \nadequate  staff  training  in  operations  and  maintenance;  and  security  fences  and  barriers  around \nsubstations and transmission towers in populated areas.  \n \n14. \nThe  limited  environmental  capability  of  MEW  to  manage  and  monitor  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan (EMMP) for the Project will be strengthened through \ntraining of staff in environmental management and monitoring of power transmission projects, and the \nestablishment  of  environmental  monitoring  and  audit  protocols  for  use  during  all  phases  of  project \nimplementation. \n \n\n4.

Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n\n \n18. \nThe  project  components,  including  the  physical  impacts  of  constructing  the  infrastructure, \nwere  explained  to  the  participants  during  public  consultation  and  information  disclosure.  Survey \nparticipants  were  given  the  opportunity  to  express  their  views  on  the  Project\u2019s  anticipated \nenvironmental  and  social  effects.  Participants  did  not  see  any  negative  environmental  or  social \nimpacts.  MEW  is  designing  newsletters,  issuing  press  releases,  conducting  TV  interviews,  and \nmaintaining a  web  page  and  has  recently  recruited  a  media  relations  expert.  In  view  of  this,  it  is \nexpected that information regarding the Project will be similarly disseminated.  \n \n\n7.  Conclusions \n\n \n19. \nThe Project will not result in any significant environmental impacts, if recommended mitigation \nmeasures are properly implemented. The measures would be incorporated into contract documents \nand  its  implementation  should  be  monitored  during  the  entire  Project.  Training  in  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring should  be  provided  to  MEW  staff.  The  IEE,  including  the  EMPP  and \nmonitoring program, is considered sufficient to meet the environmental assessment requirements for \nthe Project. No further environmental assessment is required. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n45 \n\nPOVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n\n \n \n1. \nA  survey  of  about  1,100  households  estimated  that  2.88  million  people  are  living  in \npoverty (using the $1-a-day benchmark). The sample was 42% urban (i.e., living in, or within 10 \nkm of, a town or city) and 58% rural. Average daily per capita income across the sample was 39 \ncents per day (the same for male-headed households). Female-headed households (only 1% of \nthe  sample)  earned  per  capita  48  cents  per  day  (although  the  average  household  income  is \n20% lower for female-headed households, the survey also revealed that family size is two thirds \nthat of male-headed households, resulting in higher per capita income). Only 10% of the sample \nearns more than $1 per day per capita. \n \nThe  average  household  size  is  12.8  for  male-headed  households  and  8.4  for  female-\n2. \nheaded households. The high average household size is in part due to a high fertility rate of 6.8, \nbut  also  to  a  nonnuclear  family  structure,  with  one  household  often  comprising  three \ngenerations, more than one wife per married male, and married brothers and their families living \ntogether  under  the  same  roof.    The  survey  reveals  that  approximately  31%  of  female-headed \nhouseholds are concentrated in the lowest income quintile, with more male-headed households \nproportionate to female-headed households in the upper quintiles.  A large proportion (85.7%) of \nthe population reported owning their own homes, with only 8.5% renting their homes and 4.6% \nliving in their homes for free. Most dwellings are made of mud brick (95%).  \n\n \n3. \nThe survey concludes that populations in all project areas are growing, the situations of \nmost  households  are  improving,  and  there  is  a  healthy  demand  for  electricity  as  well  as  the \nlighting and electrical appliances, all of which spells a significant increase in demand. Improved \nelectricity services could impact positively on the home-based business sector. No households \nenjoy a 24-hour supply. The average is 15 hours per day across the five grid-connected towns \n(which is why alternate forms of energy, particularly kerosene for lighting, are used pervasively). \nThe  average  is  far  lower  if  towns  using  a  community  or  village  generator  are  included. \nResidents in all towns desire supply 24-hours a day, and are willing to pay a connection fee to \nhave it. \n \n4. \nHouseholds  using  grid  electricity,  and  those  that  do  not  are  fairly  evenly  distributed \nacross  the  income  quintiles.  Use  of  grid  electricity  is  therefore  not  so  much  determined  by \nincome but by location: if electricity is available, it will be used, regardless of the users\u2019 income \nlevel. We can determine from patterns of expenditure on forms of energy that can be replaced \nby  grid  electricity  that  the  poorest  income  quintile  will  not  only  be  able  to  afford  it  but  will  also \nincrease their energy consumption without spending more. Each town has different income and \nexpenditure characteristics and electricity consumption. Pricing mechanisms for power will need \nto take these differences into consideration. \n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n\n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \n\nIs the sector identified as a \n\npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\nnational priority in country poverty \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\n Yes1 \n  No \n\npartnership agreement?   \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Afghanistan:   \n \nRestoring  electric  power  infrastructure  is  critical  for  the  revival  and  resumption  of  economic  activities, \nwhich would create jobs, generate income, and improve security and stability. The poor, who constitute the \nmajority  of  the  population  of  Afghanistan,  will  benefit  directly  through  job  opportunities  for  unskilled  and \nsemiskilled laborers during construction.  \n \nSpecific  beneficiaries  include  the  rural  and  urban  poor,  displaced  populations,  demobilized  combatants, \nand  women.  Specifically,  the  benefits  will  be  directly  or  indirectly  attributable  to  different  project \ncomponents. The Project will (i) improve the quantity, quality, stability, safety, and environmental impact of \nelectricity  supply;  (ii)  improve  household  quality  of  life;  (iii)  revive  industries  and  establish  new  ones;  (iv) \ncontribute  to  energy  security  and  self-reliance;  and  (v)  promote  private  sector  activities,  including  those \nowned and operated by women.  \n \nPoor quality and unreliable power disproportionately burdens the poor because they are less able to resort \nto alternative sources of power and because their income sources are less diversified such that loss of one \nincome  source  may  have  larger  impacts  for  the  poor  than  for  nonpoor  households.  On  the  other  hand,  a \nreliable  supply  of  power  attracts  commercial  and  industrial  activities,  which  may  enable  the  poor  to \ndiversify income sources with the increased availability of jobs. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nTargeting Classification:  General Intervention \n\n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nAfghanistan is one of the world\u2019s poorest countries: life expectancy at birth, 43 years (20 years lower than \nneighboring  Tajikistan);  child  malnutrition,  49%;  access  to  an  improved  water  source,  13%;  access  to \nimproved sanitation facilities, 12%; fertility rate, 6.8 live births per woman; malnourished population, 70%. \nNinety percent of the target population under this Project live below the $1-a-day threshold, and the lowest \nincome quintile spend half as much on energy as the highest quintile, but a much higher proportion of their \ntotal income (16% compared to 4%).  \n \nA  distribution  analysis  of  project  benefits  was  carried  out  for  the  project-affected  groups\u2014power \nproducers,  unskilled  labor,  the  Government,  and  electricity  consumers.  The  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR)  for \nthe  different  subprojects  was  computed  in  the  range  of  25%  to  over  100%.  PIRs  are  all  high  primarily \nbecause  an  overwhelming  proportion  of  electricity  consumers  in  the  target  area  are  poor,  and  electricity \nconsumers are the main beneficiaries. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  There is no Poverty Partnership Agreement (PPA) with Afghanistan yet.  The PPA is presently scheduled for later in 2005, in \n\nconjunction with a full CSP. \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n47 \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a participation strategy? \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \nThe  Project  survey  team  and  MEW  staff  surveyed  over  1,100  households  across  the  project  regions  and \nconducted  town  meetings  in  nine  project  towns.  The  meetings  raised  awareness  about  the  Project  and \nprovided  important  data  as  feedback  for  improving  project  design.  Women  are  expected  to  be  the  main \nbeneficiaries from additional lighting and/or motive power for home-based income-generating activities and \nimproved  indoor  air  quality.    The  survey  also  established  that  although the main use of electricity was for \nhousehold  lighting,  people  were  willing  to  invest  in  other  appliances  to  improve  living  conditions  and \nlivelihood.   \n\nD.  Gender Development \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nMany women refused to participate in the survey and those who did participate often had scant knowledge \nof  household  income  and  expenditure.  Therefore,  enumerators  had  to  estimate  based  on  known \nconsumption.  Most  women  in  villages  have  no  responsibility  for  \u201doutside  the  house\u201d  activities  such  as \nshopping.  Most  women  lack  basic  education  and  are  reluctant  to  speak  with  \u201coutsiders.\u201d  Many  women \nrefused  to  give  their  names  and  did  not  know  their  age.  However,  women  are  expected  to  realize  the \ngreatest  benefit  from  the  additional  lighting  and/or  motive  power  for  home-based  income-generating \nactivities  and  improved  indoor  air  quality.  The  safety  awareness  campaign  will  ensure  that  information \nreaches  women,  as  they  spend  most  of  their  time  in  the  family  compound  and  will  be  the  main  users  of \nelectricity.  \n \nA  fund  for  social  development  of  women  and  minorities  will  be  established  under  the  Project  to  mitigate \nany negative impacts. \n \nThe Government will work closely with the local community leaders in the project areas to ensure that men \nand  women  are  given  equal  opportunities  to  benefit  from  the  Project.  Contractors  will  be  required  to \nensure equal payment for equal work.  A covenant to ensure this has been included in the assurances. \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fE.

The  electrification  kits  will \ninclude  a  standard  meter,  two  compact  fluorescent \nlights, and a double power point.

Fewer  than  200 \npeople are displaced from their houses, fewer than 200 people will lose less than 10% of their \nproductive  assets  (income  generating),  or  200  people  or  more will experience minor impacts.  \nLand  acquisition  is  limited  to  moving  back  boundary  walls  in  a  few  cases  in  the  Imam  Sahib \narea, compensation for small tracts (4 square meters) of agricultural land where towers are to \nbe  sited  in  northern  and  eastern  areas,  and  removal  or  trimming  of  trees  in  most  distribution \nareas. There will be some temporary land acquisition during construction.  \n \n3.  \nThe resettlement fieldwork and analysis was undertaken in Afghanistan during June-July \n2004. Some project areas were  visited by the resettlement specialist, others by the social and \npoverty  specialist,  and  the  remainder  (specifically  in  the  south  and  east)  by  the  domestic \nconsulting team (due to the security situation at that time). Further resettlement analysis will be \nrequired  once  detailed  design  is  completed  by  the  implementation  consultant  to  record  exact \nnumbers  of  affected  persons  and  their  entitlements.  The  scope  and  budget  for  this  has  been \nincluded in the terms of reference of the implementation consultant. \n  \n4.  \nLand acquisition and resettlement impacts were minimized through the following actions: \n(i)  aligning  any  new  transmission  lines  away  from  areas  with  high  population  density  and  by \navoiding agriculturally or culturally important areas; (ii) occupying wasteland and waste hills for \nalignment,  where  possible;  (iii)  using  existing  alignments  and/or  upgrading  local  distribution \nstructures,  where  possible;  (iv)  protecting  water  conservancy  and  irrigation  facilities  as  far  as \npossible. Consultations were held with local officials to minimize resettlement effects during the \nsetting of the alignment during the feasibility study. \n \nC. \n \nFor  people  unavoidably  affected  by  the  Project,  the  resettlement  objective  is  to  ensure \n5.  \nattainment of equal or better livelihoods and living standards in line with the Afghanistan Law on \nLand  Acquisition  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement \n(1998).  The  law  is  supplemented  by  articles  14,  40,  and  51  of  the  Afghanistan  Constitution \n(2004). The Executing Agency will ensure that any people losing land, housing, or other assets \nand means of production will be helped to restore their incomes and living standards to at least \nthe  levels  without  the  Project's  intervention.  Assets  will  either  be  replaced  or  their  owners \ncompensated at replacement cost. The total resettlement budget is $68,420. \n \n6.  \nLand compensation payments are calculated at current regional rates. Young crops that \ncannot be harvested before land acquisition are compensated at the average purchasing price \nper  season  of  the  crop  compensation  rate.  Temporarily  acquired  land  is  paid  the  annual \naverage  output  value  for  each  year  of  occupation.  Topsoil  is  stored  and  then  replaced  in  the \noriginal site at the end of occupation. The cost of restoring land to farmland will be paid by the \nProject; some payments can be made directly to the farmers for helping to restore these lands. \n\nResettlement Plan \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nthe \n\nline  routes,  specific  project-affected  people  will  be  contacted  by \n\n \n7.  \nNo  houses  will  be  lost  as  a  result  of  this  project.    However,  some  boundary  walls  will \nrequire shifting back and land adjoining roadside reserves acquired for the unimpeded erection \nof power poles. People losing such walls will receive direct compensation according to the type \nof  material.  Compensation  is  based  on  the  ground  area  and  material.  There  will  be  no \ndepreciation of land values, and the project-affected people will be allowed to salvage materials \nfrom  their  former  structures  without  deduction  from  their  compensation.  They  can  choose  to \nconstruct  their  own  structure,  or  to  request  that  the  township or village arrange this for them.  \nThe Project will have no impacts on private enterprises or commercial operations.  \n \n8.  \nThe  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  (MEW)  and  the  Afghanistan  Electricity  Authority \n(DABM) offices will supervise the resettlement program with assistance from the implementation \nconsultant.  DABM  will  be  responsible  for  resettling  people  and  for  delegating  activities  to \ntownship officials and village committees affected by the Project. The township offices will sign \nland acquisition and resettlement agreements with project-affected villages and individuals, pay \ncompensation,  and  carry  out  the  daily  specific  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement. \n \n9.  \nA  short  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared.    Consultations  have  been  held  with the \nproject-affected  people  to  obtain  inputs  on  the  design  of  the  plan  and  to  inform  the  project-\naffected people of ADB\u2019s policies regarding involuntary resettlement, and explain the proposed \nplan. The plan has been translated to Dari and Pushto and explained to project-affected people \nat  community  meetings  in  November  and  December  2004.  After  the  detailed  measurement \nsurvey  of \nthe \nimplementation consultants to explain the their rights under the plan and to inform them of the \ncompensation  rates  which  will  be  based  on  the  actual  market  rates  at  the  time  of  the  detailed \nmeasurement  survey.  A  system  has  also  been  designed  for  addressing  grievance  and \nregistering complaints.  It has three stages: (i) A project-affected person files a complaint about \ncompensation  and  unpaid  losses  with  the  village  resettlement  committee  (VRC).  The  VRC  is \nobliged  to  reply  and  explain  the  decision  within  15  days  from  the  date  the  complaint  was \nreceived.  (ii)  If  the  project-affected  person  is  not  satisfied  or  the  VRC  does  not  reply,  the \ngrievance application will be forwarded to the district resettlement committee (DRC). The DRC \nmust  decide  within  15  days  from  the  date  the  complaint  was  filed.  (iii)  If  the  project-affected \nperson  is  not  satisfied  with  the  decision  or  the  DRC  does  not  reply,  the  complaint  can  be \nforwarded to the committee on compensation, which will issue the final decision within 30 days. \nThe plan will be disclosed on the ADB website upon approval of the Project. \n \n10.  \nThe  resettlement  plan  provides  for  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  specifies \nmethods  for  both.  Afghanistan  has  limited  capacity  for  internal  resettlement  supervision  and \nmonitoring,  and  therefore  the  implementation  consultant\u2019s  team  includes  a  resettlement \nspecialist  to  build  capacity  within  the  MEW.  MEW  has  agreed  to  the  resettlement  framework \nwith ADB, and is committed to ensuring the timely resettlement. MEW will engage an external \nmonitoring agency, such as a nongovernment  organization,  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  external \nmonitoring  agency  will  conduct  baseline  surveys,  investigate  resettlement  implementation \nprogress, and prepare monitoring and evaluation reports for submission to MEW and ADB every \n6 months. The scope of work for external monitoring is included in the resettlement framework. \nAfter  resettlement,  annual  investigations  will  be  carried  out  for  2  years  to  assess  whether \nrehabilitation  measures  have  fully  restored  incomes  and  livelihoods  of  all  affected  people. \nAnnual evaluation reports will be prepared by the external monitoring agency and submitted to \nMEW and ADB.  The full resettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n51 \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR \nCAPACITY BUILDING  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\nA.  \n \n1. \nThe  Government  has  initiated  an  innovative  incentive  based  mechanism,  the  Priority \nReform  and  Restructuring  (PRR)  program,  to  fast-track  reform  in  the  public  sector  of \nAfghanistan,  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  the  PRR  process \nthrough  the  ongoing  technical  assistance  (TA)  cluster.1  The  effective  operation  of  the  power \nsector  hinges  on  immediate  capacity  building  in  (i)  commercialization  activities,  (ii)  billing  and \ncollection,  (iii)  accounting  systems,  (iv)  cost  of  service  analysis,  (v)  operative  metering  and \nconnections, (vi) theft control, and (vii) new connection. Sustainability of reform will be ensured \nthrough a comprehensive capacity building  initiative. As the World Bank, German Development \nCooperation  (GTZ),  and  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  are \nactively focusing on the first two areas\u2014commercialization, and billing and collection\u2014ADB will \nmainly assist in capacity building of basic skills in technical and accounting areas.  \n \n2. \ntechnical and accounting training. Three streams of training packages will be developed: \n \n\nThe objective of the TA is to improve effective operation of the power sector by providing \n\nbusiness  management:  general  business  management,  portfolio  review,  and \nprogram management;  \n\ntechnical  operation: \ntransmission,  and \ntechnical  operation  of  generation, \ndistribution in the power sector; power plant protection; metering (meter readers, \nmeter \nloss  management;  and  optimum \ndispatching; and \n\ninstallation,  and  disconnection); \n\n(e.g.,  double-entry \naccounting  and  economic  management:  accounting \nbookkeeping,  register,  accrual-basis  accounting);  contracting;  procurement  and \ninventory management; financial reporting; management information system; and \neconomics of cost recovery and tariff setting. \n\n \n3. \nThe TA will help improve skills that will increase the overall efficiency of operations. It will \nimprove  customer  service  delivery  and  overall  safety  standards,  and  daily  operations  and \ntechnical and financial record keeping. \n \n4. \nIt  is  essential  that  the  training  packages  are  implemented  using  existing  training \nresources within the Ministry. Therefore there is a requirement to upskill the trainers within the \nDepartment  of  Education-Ministry  of  Education  and  Water  who  number  approximately  60,  and \nhave engineering qualifications and teaching capability.  \n \n5. \nPremises  to  conduct  training  are  extremely  limited,  the  original  extensive laboratories, \nworkshops,  class  rooms  and  hostel  remain  a  bombed  out  shell,  and  current  training  is \nconducted  under  tents  and  in  primitive  buildings.  This  TA  recognizes  the  limited  scope  of \nphysical  resources  and  there  is  a  specific  requirement  to  analyze and determine short term, \nmedium  term,  and  long  term  physical  resource  requirements  in  conjunction  (to  the  extent  that \nthis is feasible) with other multilateral development agencies. \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2002.

The  project  implementation  unit  (PIU), \nunder  guidance  from  the  PISU  and  MEW  and  Water  and  DABM  will  coordinate  with  the \nDepartment  of  Education  (of  MEW)  on  selection  of  candidates  to  participate  in  the  training \nprograms. The TA will be implemented over 5 months, from July to November 2005. \n \n8. \nThe TA will finance the services of an international consultant for 2 person-months on an \nintermittent  basis.  The  consultant  will  be  engaged  individually  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  consultant  will  have  expertise  in  capacity  building \nand training within the energy sector, and will conduct training needs assessment of MEW and \nDABM.  \n \n9. \nThe  training  will  have  three  components:  (i)  train  the  trainers  within  the  Department of \nEducation-Ministry of Energy and Water; support for the establishment of a training institute in \nterm  of  short,  medium  and  long  term  planning;  (ii)  three  1-week  modules\u2014business \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n53 \n\nmanagement, technical operation, and accounting and economic management; and (iii) a study \ntour to fast-developing countries for a selected group of trainers. \n \n10. \nUnder  the  training  of  the  trainer  module:  about  nine  trainers  from  the  Department  of \nEducation-Ministry of Energy and Water (academic or technical experts, three for each subject) \nwill  work  under  the  guidance  of  training  consultant  together  with  a  training  institute  to  develop \nthe training modules suitable for Afghanistan. Three Afghan trainers will be trained under each \nmodule  and  an  institute  will  be  involved  for  developing  each  module.  This  process  will  take \nabout  a  month,  and  the  three  trainers  will  be  work  overseas  with  the  training  institutes.  Each \ntraining will be run three times, covering 40\u201345 participants each time. A reputable international \neducational institute will be associated in providing the training with the support from the Afghan \ntrainers (graduates of the train the trainers program). Depending on the available skill base, all \nthree  modules  may  be  developed  either  by  a  single  institute  or  three  different  institutes.  The \nselection of the educational institute(s) will be based on the experience, competence, and skills \nin providing training in those areas. \n \nBased  on  performance  of  the  trainees,  about  six  participants  will  be  selected for study \n11. \ntours  abroad.  The  tours  will  be  designed  along  the  lines  of  an  exchange  program,  with  an \noverseas  utility  where  the  Afghan  participants  will  spend  a  month  each  learning  operation, \nmanagement, and technical issues by working with the utility experts. \n \n12. \nTraining  equipment,  including  computers  and  multimedia  projectors,  will  be  provided. \nTeaching  materials  such  as  reference  books,  instructional  video,  English  library  books,  and \ntesting and other technical equipment required for the  training center will be provided under the \nTA. All equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, and \nwill  be  handed  over  to  the  Department  of  Education-Ministry  of  Energy  and  Water  upon \ncompletion of the TA. \n \nD. \n \n13. \nThe  capacity-building  and  training  expert  should  have  experience  in  capacity-building \ninitiatives,  preferably  in  post-conflict  countries.  The  expert  will  closely  consult  with  MEW,  and \nduties will include, but not be limited to, the following: \n \n\nOutline Terms of Reference of the Consultant \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nAssess  the  training  needs  of  DABM  and  MEW  staff  at  from  the  head  office  as \nwell as in the provinces, in technical fields, management, and accounting. \n \nPrepare  a  comprehensive  training  program  in  the  above  areas,  and  develop a \ntime schedule suitable to MEW. \n \nEstablish  selection  criteria  for  the  candidates  for  the  various  training  programs, \nincluding training of trainers. \n \nEstablish selection criteria and terms of reference for the training institutions. \n \nPrepare technical reports, including an evaluation report upon completion of the \ntraining program. \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS  \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n   \nGovernment is the main investor in electricity transmission all over the world. Investment \n1. \nin  power  transmission  involves  large  amounts  of  capital,  little  maintenance  cost,  and  a  return \nover a long period. Government or an independent regulator regulates this sector because of its \nnatural  monopoly  characteristics;  high  fixed  costs  making  it  unprofitable  for  a  second  firm  to \nenter and compete.  \n \n2. \nAll  the  components  are  part  of  the  least-cost  expansion  program  developed  under  the \npower system master plan. The plan considers supply alternatives to areas without grid supply \nand  with  large-scale  isolated  diesel  generation.  The  Project  is  the  least-cost  option  for \ndeveloping transmission and distribution network in the selected cities. On an incremental basis, \nthe  Project  will  greatly  reduce  reliance  on  inefficient  and  high-cost  village,  household,  and \nenterprise self-generation at unit costs in the range $0.15\u20130.55/kWh, replaced with an estimated \naverage incremental cost of grid-connected electricity of $0.079/kWh. \n \n\nB. \n\nEconomic Cost of Project Components \n\n \nTo  convert  financial  project  cost  into  economic  cost,  turnover  and  income  taxes  were \n3. \ndeducted,  and  connection  costs  added  (after  allowing  for  the  about  18,000  electrification  kits \nthat will be distributed to the poorest households as part of the Project).  Annual operation and \nmaintenance  and  administration  costs  were  calculated  in  economic  prices  (financial  prices \nadjusted using the standard conversion factor). No price contingencies are included in the base \ncapital  cost  but  the  economic  capital  costs  include  physical  contingencies.  Costs  were \nseparated into foreign exchange and local costs. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was used. \nThe  cost  of  supply  was  valued  based  on  the  long-run  marginal  cost  for  generation  and \ntransmission as calculated in the power sector master plan. \n \n4. \nConsistent with the financial analysis, 30 years is used for the project economic analysis. \nInvestment is assumed to take place during 2005\u20132007, and projects benefits are assumed to \nbe  realized  from  2007.  Beyond  2020,  further  investment  will  be  required  to  meet  incremental \ndemand growth. \n \n\nC.  Quantification of Benefits \n\n \n5. \nThe main benefits are from (i) eventual connection to northern neighboring countries for \nthe  long-term  reliable  electricity;  (ii)  connection  of  new  customers  to  electricity;  (iii)  improved \navailability  and  reliability;  and  (iv)  supply  of  electricity  from  non-diesel  sources  and  loss \nreduction. The incremental and non-incremental benefits were selected separately. Incremental \nbenefit was calculated using customers\u2019 willingness to pay, and the non-incremental benefit was \nnot captured in the calculation, as resource cost savings for individual components could not be \nreliably estimated. \n \n6. \nThe reductions in technical and nontechnical losses were derived from the power system \nmaster  plan  forecast,  and  were  applied  uniformly  across  all  components.  In  general,  technical \nlosses at the distribution level are assumed to reduce from present levels of approximately 19% \nof  energy  sales  to  12%  by  2020.  Nontechnical  losses  are  assumed  to  reduce  from  present \nlevels  to  6%  over  the  same  period.  Loss  reduction  has  been  applied  to  incremental  and  non-\nincremental sales in calculating benefit streams. \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n55 \n\n \n7. \nMost households in the project area have no access to grid electricity. However, village-\nsponsored  systems  and  privately  operated  generators  based  on  diesel  or  petrol-powered \ngensets  provide  limited  amounts  of  electricity.  Thus,  even  in  the  absence  of  grid  supply,  the \nresidential, Government, and \u201cother\u201d sectors consume a certain amount of electricity, although \nthe price paid is substantially higher than the grid-connected customers. \n \n\n1. \n\nDomestic Consumers \n\n \n8. \nFor  economic  analysis,  adjustments  were  made  to  incremental  electricity  sales,  to \nexclude  non-incremental  energy  consumption  (existing  energy  consumption  that  will  be \ncaptured by Afghanistan Electricity Authority [DABM] as the network is rehabilitated). Based on \nfindings  of  the  socioeconomic  survey,  domestic  average  non-incremental  demand  was \nestimated at 9.3 kWh per month per household. For other consumer groups, it was assumed \nthat estimated suppressed demand is met from other electrical and nonelectrical sources. \n \nThe economic benefits of extending grid supply to unserved areas are estimated based \n9. \non  the  cost  of  alternative  energy  sources  used  for  existing  consumption  levels,  and  based  on \nthe willingness to pay for induced consumption as a consequence of the availability of reliable \ngrid  supply.  Analysis  of  the  socioeconomic  survey  revealed  that  the  non-incremental \nconsumption  of  electricity  or  its  equivalent  in  other  forms  of  energy  is  approximately  AF270 \n($5.80) per household per month, whether grid-connected or not. Households that have access \nto  electricity  include  many  that  are  supplied  by  village-operated  petrol-  or  diesel-powered \ngensets, for an average of about 5 hours per day. The average expenditure per household from \nthis source is AF236 ($5.12) per month for consumption of 9.3 kWh, equivalent to AF25.3/kWh \n($0.55/kWh).  \n \n10. \nHouseholds in project areas connected to the grid and paying a tariff of AF0.96\u20132.5/kWh \n($0.02\u20130.05/kWh), spend on average AF270 ($5.86) per month for electricity, consuming 107\u2013\n281  kWh  per  household  per  month.  Incremental  consumption  of  electricity  within  the  project \nareas  in  the  domestic  sector  is  thus  98.5\u2013280  kWh  per  month  per  household  (total  average \nconsumption with the project less non-incremental consumption). Non-incremental consumption \nof electricity is thus valued at the resource cost of AF25.3/kWh ($0.55/kWh). \n \n11. \nIncremental  consumption  of  electricity,  valued  assuming  a  linear  demand  function  (that \nis, assuming that 50% of the difference between the current tariff and the cost of the alternative \nrepresents consumer surplus), is estimated at AF13.9 /kWh (3.23 c/kWh). A semi-log demand \nfunction,  which  would  theoretically  lower  the  value  of  the  incremental  consumption, was not \nused,  as  the  price  change  would  not  be  significant  after  rounding  to  one  decimal  place  in  US \ndollars. \n \n12. \nThe  analysis  ignored  the  benefit  from  supply  reliability  improvements  as  the  level  of \nindustrialization is very low in Afghanistan and, consequently, the difference between the value \nof lost load and tariff will be low. An average incremental cost of future electricity supply (to the \nmedium  voltage  bus  bar)  was  estimated  as  part  of  the  power  system  master  plan  to  be \napproximately  AF3.6  /kWh  (9  c/kWh)  for  the  integrated  central  grid.  Most  customers  in  the \ncurrent and expanded network will be connected at the low-voltage level. At current tariffs then, \nsupply  costs  are  typically  under-recovered,  and  a  prima  facie  economic  subsidy  to  domestic \nconsumers will be realized as the system expands.  \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nD. \n\nEconomic Model and Evaluation \n\n13. \nTo test the economic viability of each of the components, the economic internal rate of \nreturn  (EIRR)  was  calculated  on  the  basis  of  incremental  cost-and-benefit streams associated \nwith each project. The economic analysis evaluated the economic performance of the proposed \ncomponents  by  comparing  the  with-  and  without-project  scenarios,  i.e.,  the  economic  value  of \nthe  incremental  and  non-incremental  supply  of  electricity  that  the  components  will  provide \ncompared with the existing patterns of energy use in non-electrified areas. \n \n14. \nEconomic  returns  are  acceptable  for  all  projects  and  robust  for  most.  This  stems  from \ngrid  extensions\u2019  capacity  to  bring  urban-quality  power  at  the  urban  tariff  to  rural  villages  that \nwould otherwise face high costs for low-quality service. On average, the Project will allow poor \nhouseholds  to  consume  10  times  the  electricity  than  they  had  access  to  under  a  similar \nhousehold budget without the Project.  \n \n\nTable A15.1: Summary of EIRR for Project Components \n\n \n\n \n\nProject \n\n1.

Physical contingency is provisioned on \n8%  of  the  project  base  cost.  The  project  cost,  including  physical  contingency,  is  based  on \nconstant 2005 prices. Allowance for price contingency provides for future price escalation due to \nfluctuation of foreign and domestic inflation.1 Interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace \nperiod will be capitalized and charged to the loan account. The total project cost also includes \nprovisions  for  support  facilities,  de-mining  and  security  activities,  resettlement  and  its \nmonitoring,  and  consulting  services,  which  will  all  support  project  implementation. Local taxes \nand duties are not payable under the Project. \n \nB. \n \n\nProject Financial and Economic Evaluation \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n2. \nMethodology. Subproject components were planned cost-effectively. Since the financial \nimpacts  of  the  transmission  and  distribution  components  are  interdependent,  they  have  been \ncombined for financial evaluation. A period of 30 years has been used for the project evaluation. \nInvestment  is  expected  to  take  place  during  2005\u20132007  and  project  benefits  will  be  realized \nfrom  2007.  Beyond  2020,  further  investment  will  be  required  to  meet  incremental  demand \ngrowth. All benefit-and-cost streams are determined in constant 2005 dollar terms.  \n \nFinancial Benefits. From a financial perspective, project benefits will be generated from \n3. \nincremental  sales  resulting  from  reduction  of  transmission  and  distribution  losses.  The \nrehabilitation  and  construction  of  transmission  and  distribution  systems  will  enable  older \nsystems to be gradually retired as appropriate, thereby reducing losses and increasing reliability \nand  quality  of  supply.  Under  the  current  situation  of  acute  power  supply  shortfall  against \ndemand  in  the  areas,  additional  project  benefits  will  also  depend  on  release  of  the  present \nsuppressed demand and ability  to  meet  growing  demand.  Distribution  loss  is  will  be  gradually \nreduced  by  0.6%  on  an  annual  average  for  next  3  years  during  project  implementation2 while \ntransmission loss accruing from new transmission components is taken on 1.5%.    \n \n4. \nFinancial  Costs.  For  the  purpose  of  financial  evaluation,  cost  streams  reflect \nincremental  costs  in  delivering  the  benefits  identified.  The  financial  costs  comprise  capital, \nincremental  energy,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  administration,  particularly  additional \nbilling, costs, and taxation. The capital costs include physical contingencies. Incremental energy \ncosts  are  accrued  to  additional  generation  and  power  purchase  to  be  supplied  to  the  project \narea. O&M costs for transmission and distribution systems are  assumed on 1.0% and 1.5% of \nrequired  capital  costs.  The  size  of  incremental  administration  costs,  including  billing  and \ncollection costs, is minor but is assumed to increase in proportion to consumption growth since \ndistribution  projects  contribute  to  a  large  number  of  new  connections  (para  1).  Project  cash \nflows will be taxed in accordance with the existing tax regime for state enterprises\u20142% tax on \nturnover (electricity sales) and 20% tax on net income. \n                                                 \n1  Domestic inflation rate is taken as 2.0% per annum and foreign inflation rates are based on manufacturing unit \n\nvalue index. \n\n2  The  overall  distribution  losses  in  Afghanistan  Electricity  Authority    (DABM)  are  estimated  on  27%.  The  Project\u2019s \ndistribution  system  will  reduce  technical  losses,  but  overall  distribution  losses  are  assumed  to  be  reduced \nconservatively  due  to  the  present  inadequate  billing  and  collection  management  and  meter-reading system of \nDABM.  \n\n\f \n58\n\nAppendix 16 \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Evaluation \n\n \n \n \n5. \nTo  evaluate  the  financial  viability  of  the  Project,  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return \n(FIRR)  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  incremental  benefit  and  cost  streams  associated  with  the \nProject.  The  FIRR  was  tested  on  sensitivity  of  the  project  performance  to  changes  in  key \nvariables.  The  results  are  summarized  in  Table  A16,  which  indicates  that  the  Project  is \nfinancially feasible,3 and FIRRs are not sensitive to variables tested, even for multiple downside \n(combined) scenarios. The calculation of the base FIRR analysis is in Supplementary Appendix \nE. \n \n \n\nTable A16:  Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Test \n\nBase Case  \n\nDemand  \n\nO&M Cost \n\nCombined  \n\n  \n\n11.8% \n\n(10%) \n\n10.7% \n\n10% \n\nConstruction  Scenario \n\n11.7% \n\n11.3% \n\n9.5% \n\n \nAF = Government of Afghanistan currency unit, DABM = Da Afghanistan Breshna Moasses (Afghanistan Electricity \nAuthority), IDC = interest during construction, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, KV = kilovolt, O&M = operation \nand maintenance, T&D = transmission and distribution. \n \n\nCapital \nCost \n\n10% \n\n10.9% \n\n1 Year Delay \nof \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n3  The  real  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  compared  with  FIRRs  in  assessing  the  Project\u2019s  financial \nfeasibility.
