An initial environmental  examination was undertaken \nand the summary is a core appendix.  \n \nDespite  the  comprehensive  structural  reforms  and  a  stabilizing \nmacroeconomic  situation,  the  high  incidence  of  rural  poverty \nremains  a  major  concern  in  Pakistan.  Widespread  lack  of \naffordable  rural  financial  services  constrains  rural  growth  and \nemployment.  The  potential  client  base  for  rural  finance  (RF)  is \nestimated  at  9  million  households  comprising  both  the  poor  and \nnonpoor.  The  demand  and  supply  in  the  stratified  RF  markets \nmirrors the inequitable rural socioeconomic structure, landholding, \nand  employment  pattern.  While  credit  demand  is  estimated  at \nPRs240 billion-PRs260 billion per annum, the supply from formal \nfinancial  institutions  is  only  PRs56  billion.  Most  of  this  amount \ndoes not reach the middle and lower segments of the RF markets \nconsisting  of  rural  entrepreneur,  small  and  subsistence  farmers, \nand  the  landless.  Informal  sources  such  as  landlords  and  input \nsuppliers  provide  intermittent  short  duration  loans  at  very  high \ninterest  rates  that  reflect  the  weak  bargaining  power  of  the \nborrowers.  \n \nOver  the  last  4  decades  the  RF  markets  in  Pakistan  could  only \nprovide  limited  accessibility  and  poor-quality services. Emphasis \non agriculture ignored the demand from the nonfarm sector, which \naccounts for half the rural income. Reliance of RF institutions on \nsoft  budgetary  resources  depressed  savings  mobilization  and \nundermined  financial  discipline.  Overt  politicization  and  weak \ngovernance  eroded  the  sustainability  of  RF  institutions  and  this \ncreated  the  perception  that  RF  per  se  is  nonviable.  This \nperception  inhibited  commercial  banks  from  extending  their  RF \nportfolio  and  discouraged \nthe  emergence  of  private  RF \ninstitutions.  \n \nThe role of RF in expanding income and reducing poverty remains \nunfulfilled.  Weak  RF  markets  in  Pakistan  perpetuate  poverty, \ndepress  the  rate  of  rural  economic  growth,  and  distort  income \ndistribution.  The  Government,  therefore,  aims  to  develop  the  RF \nsector  to  attain  self-reliance  in  agricultural  commodities,  ensure \nfood security, and generate employment.  \n \n \nThe  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program  (RFSDP)  has \nbeen  designed  to  assist  the  Government  in  accelerating  rural \neconomic  growth  by  addressing  key  constraints  in  RF.  The \nprogram  goals  are  to  ensure  permanent  access  to  institutional \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nComponents and \nOutputs  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nProgram Period and \n \n\nTranching \n\nExecuting Agency \nand \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n           Procurement \n\nprogram  goals  are  to  ensure  permanent  access  to  institutional \nfinancial  services  for  a  majority  of  rural  households  at  minimal \ntransaction  cost  and  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in \nRF  sector.  The  specific  objective  is  to  develop  a  sustainable  RF \nsystem  for  providing  affordable  services,  primarily  to  the  middle \nand  lower  segments  of  the  RF  markets  for  a  significant  income \nexpansion and poverty reduction impact. \n \nThe  program  loan  consists  of  4  components:  (i)  creating  a \nfavorable  policy  environment,  (ii)  institutional  restructuring  and \nreforms,  (iii)  new  bank  fund  (NBF),  and  (iv)  product  and  process \ninnovations.  The  policy  reforms  introduce  a  new  RF  paradigm \nwhere the Government will (i) complement, facilitate, and improve \nthe  functioning  of  the  RF  markets;  and  (ii)  limit  its  direct \nintervention  only  to  identifiable  market  failures.  The  policies  will \nfundamentally  alter  the  governance  and  operations  of  Zarai \nTaraqiati  Bank  Limited  (ZTBL),  the  key  RF  institution.  The  NBF \nwill  encourage \nthe  emergence  of  private  or  public-private \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs).  \n \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of $225 million \nfrom its ordinary capital resources with a 15-year term, including a \ngrace  period  of  3  years;  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offer  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; \na  front-end  fee  of  1%  of  the  loan  amount, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement.  \n \nThe loan will be released in 4 tranches over a 3-year period. The \nfirst \nloan \ntranche  of  $100  million  will  be  released  upon \neffectiveness; the second tranche of $50 million, expected after 7 \nmonths  of  the  first  tranche;  the  third  tranche  of  $50  million \nexpected within 12 months of the second tranche; and the fourth \ntranche  of  $25  million,  expected  within  17  months  of  the  third \ntranche, in each case subject to compliance with the conditions for \ntheir release. \n \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency and \nwill  also  implement  the  Credit  Union  Plan  and  Pilot  Insurance \nPlan.  State  Bank  of Pakistan (SBP), the central bank, will be the \nimplementing  agency  (IA)  for  strengthening  supervision  and \nregulation, NBF, and RF Resource Center. ZTBL will be the IA for \nZTBL  restructuring.  The  National  Credit  Consultative  Council \nconsisting  of  a  broad  array  of  stakeholders  will  ensure  wider \nconsultation on policy matters.   \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign  exchange \ncost  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries, \nexcluding ineligible items.  \n \n \n\n\fCounterpart \nFunds \n\n \nThe Project Loan  \nObjective  \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nProcurement \n\nExecuting Agency \nand \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\ninstitutional  strengthening \n\nCounterpart  funds  generated  from  the  program  loan  will  be  used \nfor  ZTBL  restructuring,  NBF,  RF  Resource  Center,  Credit  Union \nPlan, and Pilot Insurance Plan.  \n \n \nThe project loan will provide institutional strengthening support to \nZTBL, SBP, and the project management unit at MOF.  \n \nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $25  million  from  its  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  4 \nyears; an interest rate to  be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum; a front-end fee of 1% of the loan amount; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement.  \n \nMOF  will  oversee  and  coordinate  implementation.  ZTBL  will  be \nthe IA for ZTBL restructuring. SBP will be the IA for the NBF, RF \nResource  Center,  and \nfor  RF \nregulation.  \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Expenditure  procedures  will \nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nConsultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging  domestic  consultants.  A  total  of  438  person-months of \ninternational  and  651  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \ninputs will be required. Where possible and appropriate simplified \nprocedures will be applied.  \n \nThe  shift  in  the  RF  policy  paradigm  with  emphasis  on  good \ngovernance  will  permit  sustainable  RF  markets  to  develop.  The \nhitherto  segmented  RF  markets  will  be  integrated  with  the \nmainstream  financial  sector,  thus  opening  up  the  possibility  of \narresting  the  flow  of  resources  from  the  rural  sector.  Gains  from \ninstitutional  reforms  will  be  captured  in  improved  governance, \nsubstantial cost savings through rightsizing, and greater outreach. \nIncreased  rural  financial  intermediation  will  lead  to  income \nexpansion  by  addressing  the  growing  demand  from  the  rural \nnonfarm  sector  through  product  and  service  diversification. \nStrategic  initiatives  with  incentives  for  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation  in  RF  provide  greater  prospects  for  reaching  the \nmiddle  and  lower  segments  of  the  RF  markets.  Pilots  for  crop \ninsurance  and  credit  union  will  establish  innovative  cost-effective \nsolutions  to  reduce  risk  and  expand  outreach.  Outreach  is \nexpected to increase by about 200,000 by the end of the RFSDP \nperiod of 3 years.   \n \n \n \n\nv\n\n \n\n\fincluding \n\nrural  producers, \n\nIncreased  rural  financial  intermediation  will  stimulate  linkages \nwithin  the  rural  economy  and  with  urban  areas.  Employment \nopportunities are  expected  to  increase  for  the  rural  unemployed \nand  underemployed  as  a  result  of  emphasis  on  rural  nonfarm \nactivities.  While  the  full  benefits  from  a  strengthened  RF  system \nare  likely  to  occur  in  the  medium  term,  the  reformed  institutions \nwill target the middle and lower segments of RF markets from the \noutset.  Taken  together,  these  developments  are  expected  to \nimprove rural economic growth that translates into higher income \nfor \nthe  poor.  The  promotion, \ndevelopment,  and  strengthening  of  MFIs  through  private-public \npartnership  will  ensure  that  the  poverty  reduction  impact  is  felt \nbeyond the life of the RFSDP. Appropriately designed and priced \nservices \nthat  consider  asset  and  consumption  buildup \nrequirements  are  expected  to  raise  household income above the \npoverty threshold after 4-5 credit cycles.  \n \nThe  major  risks  relate  to  commitment  to  reforms,  private sector \nperception  of \nthe  short \nimplementation period.  The  reform  agenda  was  arrived  at  after \nsustained  policy  dialogue.  The  reforms  are  phased  to  show \ntangible  outreach  results \nthat  will  strengthen  sociopolitical \nacceptance  and  minimize  the  risk  of  any  rollback  of  reforms. \nInvestor  response  is  likely  to  remain  positive  because  of  up-front \nincentives,  and  central  bank \nreforms, \nsupervision  for  good  governance.  The  loan  will  be  released  in  4 \ntranches  to  permit  greater  dialogue  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment and allow sufficient time for implementation. \n \nThe risk of incomplete or delayed institutional reform is mitigated by \nprior  actions  on  governance, \nrestructuring,  and \nrightsizing. Support to RF institutions is contingent upon achieving \nloan \na  defined  performance \nremissions  and  waivers  are  mitigated  by  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment that it will not pardon outstanding loan repayment or \ndiscourage debt recovery.  \n \n \n\ninvestment  opportunities,  and \n\nlevel.

However,  the  high  incidence  of  rural  poverty1 \nremains a major policy concern. Government objectives for the rural sector, therefore, include \nattaining  self-reliance  in  agricultural  commodities,  ensuring  food  security,  and  generating  rural \nemployment. Widespread lack of rural financial services from institutional sources at reasonable \nterms constrains the realization of these objectives. Rural finance (RF) in Pakistan constitutes \ndelivery of financial services including savings, credit, insurance, and payment services to poor \nand nonpoor rural households. Microfinance (MF),2 targeting the poor, is an integral part of RF. \nAppendix 1 presents the sector and subsector analysis.  \n \nPreponderant  Poor  and  Low-Income  Client  Base.  The  rural  sector  consists  of  97 \n3. \nmillion  people,  or  two  thirds  of  the  total  population,  in  14.3  million  households.  Of  the  5.07 \nmillion  farm  households,3  44%  belong  to  subsistence  farmers  and  36%  to  small  farmers. The \nrest  are  nonfarm  households  including  the  landless.  The  rural  population  includes  35  million \npoor, or three fourths of the total poor population, in 5.15 million households. Nearly two thirds \nof  the  workforce  are  engaged  in  rural  jobs.  Agriculture,4  including  livestock,  provides  half  the \nrural income. Nonfarm income comes from rural enterprises5 and nonfarm employment.  \n \nStratified  Market  with  Diverse  Needs.  The  RF  market  consists  of  formal  sources \n4. \nincluding  RF  institutions  (RFIs):  Zarai  Taraqiati  Bank  Limited  (ZTBL),6  cooperatives,  rural \nbranches of commercial banks (CBs), licensed microfinance institutions (MFIs), insurance and \nleasing  companies,  and  post  offices.  While  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP)\u2014the  central  bank\u2014\nsupervises  CBs,  ZTBL,  and  MFIs,  the  provincial  cooperative  departments  supervise  the \ncooperatives. Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are classified as semiformal sources and \nare  not  subject  to  formal  supervision.  The  informal  sources  comprise  input  suppliers,  traders, \nmoneylenders,  landlords,  relatives,  and  friends.  The  structure  of  the  RF  markets  mirrors  the \nsocioeconomic  structure  of  the  rural  society,  landholding  patterns,  and  nature  of  employment. \nAccordingly, the demand for RF services is heterogeneous.  \n\n                                                 \n1   Rural poverty incidence is 36.3% as against 22.4% in urban areas. The official poverty line is PRs670 per capita \n\nper month or 2,450 calories per rural adult per day. ADB. 2002. Pakistan Poverty Assessment. Manila. \n\n2   Considering the demographics of Pakistan, MF is primarily rural even though MF institutions also target the urban \n\npoor. RF, including MF, as argued in this document is part of the broader financial sector.  \n\n3   Farmers  are  classified  as  subsistence  (up  to  2  hectares  of  landholding);  small  (above  2  and  up  to  5);  medium \n(above 5 and up to 10); and large  (above  10).  Farmers  include  owners,  owner-cum -tenants, and tenants. About \none third of the operational farms have tenant farmers, most of whom are poor. \n\n4   Agriculture production and marketing, farm mechanization, land development, irrigation, livestock, forestry, etc.  \n5   Rural enterprises include both agriculture-related and nonfarm enterprises. Agriculture-related enterprises include \nsmall-scale processing of agriculture produce and byproducts into semifinished and finished goods, and production \nand supply of agricultural inputs. Nonfarm enterprises include transport, warehousing, handicraft, and weaving.   \n6    Former  Agricultural  Development  Bank  of  Pakistan.  ZTBL  was  incorporated  on  23  October  2002  as  part  of  the \nRFSDP reform agenda. Reference to ZTBL in this document is made both for discussing the issues with regard to \nthe Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan and the restructuring plan of ZTBL. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nUpper.  This  segment  comprises  primary  processors  of  agriculture  commodity, \nindustries,  agriculture  produce \nfood  processors, \nwholesalers, and farmers with large landholdings (above 20 hectares). The CBs \ncater to the requirements of this segment that include high-end financial services \nsuch as letters of credit, export guarantee, and long-term investment capital.  \n\nlarge  agriculture-based \n\nMiddle.  This  segment  comprises  the  nonpoor  nonfarm  households  and  better- \noff  farmers  (landholding  of  10-20  hectares)  engaged  in  rural  enterprises, \nagribusiness services, and agriculture input supply. CBs and RFIs partially meet \nthe  needs  for  working  capital,  trade  finance,  investment  credit,  and  crop  loans. \nSignificant reliance is on reinvestment of business surpluses and family sources. \n\nLower  Middle.  This  segment  comprises  medium  farmers,  (landholding  of  5-\n10 hectares),  small  rural  enterprises,  agriculture  produce  retailers,  and \ncommercial  dairy.  While  often  mandated  to  receive  RF  services  from  formal \nsources, they have to rely primarily on household savings and informal sources.  \n\nLowest. This segment comprises the landless poor and small, subsistence, and \ntenant farmers (landholding up to 5 hectares). Informal sources meet the credit \nneeds  for  consumption,  subsistence  agriculture,  and  microenterprises.  This \nsegment is a natural MFI clientele with a significant demand for savings facilities.  \n\n \n5. \nImmense Untapped Potential Demand.  Estimates of rural credit requirements from all \nsources range from PRs240 to PRs260 billion per annum (p.a.) for a potential clientele base of \n9  million  rural  households.  Of  this  number,  nearly  3  million  are  poor  households  with  an \nestimated credit demand of PRs68 billion p.a. Half the credit demand is for agriculture, and one \nfourth  each  for  rural  enterprises  and  consumption.  The  savings  potential  of  the  rural  poor  and \nnonpoor households on average is estimated at PRs4,000 and PRs22,000, or about 20% of the \nhousehold  income.  This  amounts  to  around  PRs268  billion  annually.  Savings  comprise  self-\nfinancing for investments, livestock, cash, and bank deposits. The demand is mainly for savings \nand credit, although the need for crop and calamity insurance is widely felt. \n \nInadequate  Supply  Response.  Rural  household  borrowings  from  all  sources  were \n6. \nestimated at PRs180 billion in FY2001. Formal sources accounted for PRs56 billion to 786,000 \nborrowers, nearly 6% of the rural households and one fifth of the estimated demand. Among the \nformal sources, ZTBL provided 49% of the credit; CBs 37%; cooperatives 11%; and MFIs 3%. \nNGOs had about 100,000 clients. The balance was provided primarily by informal sources. Most \nof  the  credit  was  for  short-term  agriculture  production.  The  requirements  of  rural  enterprises \nwere largely unmet. CBs held nearly 90% of rural savings with the formal institutions, estimated \nat PRs200 billion. Post offices provided some savings, remittance, and insurance services. All \nother sources did not mobilize savings in any significant manner. \n \n7. \nInverted and Inequitable Access. The upper segments of the RF markets have access \nto formal sources of credit, leasing, and insurance services. Informal sources meet bulk of the \ndemand from the middle and lower segments. Among the poor who borrow, 90% have recourse \nonly  to  informal  sources,  as  they  lack  collateral  to  access  formal  sources.  Half  the  informal \ncredit  is  for  consumption  and  loan  sizes  are  nearly  one  fourth  of  the  formal  sources.  The \nprevailing interest charges from formal sources, 13-15% p.a., on average are half to one third of \nthe  informal  sources.  In  the  absence  of  safe  and  liquid  savings  facilities,  the  savings  from  the \npoor households remain locked in nonfinancial assets.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fInappropriate  Policy  Paradigm.  The  goal \n\n8. \nto  accelerate  agriculture  production \ninfluenced the  evolution of the RF market during the last 4 decades, ignoring rural enterprises. \nGovernment intervened through directed credit, state-owned RFIs, concessional refinance, and \nloans at below-cost interest rates. On the other hand, policies relating to agriculture repressed \nfarm  income  potential.  Production  and  marketing  bottlenecks  due  to  weak  rural  infrastructure \nincreased risks, volatility, and uncertainties in the rural sector.  \n \n9. \ngovernance eroded institutional sustainability and constrained the outreach potential. \n\nInefficient  Institutions.  Repressive  policies  along  with  lack  of  autonomy  and  weak \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\nZarai Taraqiati Bank Limited. ZTBL, the key RF institution (RFI), provides savings \nand  collateralized  loans  through  its  nationwide  network  of  343  branches. ZTBL \ndisbursed PRs27.6 billion in 417,000 loans at an average of PRs66,187 per loan \nduring  FY2001.  Loans  mainly  went  to  medium  and  small  farmers.  Poor \nrepayment rate,7 high transaction costs, and profitability are major concerns.  \n\nCooperatives.  Five  provincial  cooperative  banks  (PCBs)  with  205  branches \nspread  over  118  districts  provide  credit  to  62,861  primary  societies  with  3.5 \nmillion  members.  During  FY2001,  PRs6  billion  was  disbursed  to  66,000 \nborrowers, or PRs90,909 per loan. Savings services are sparse.  \n\nCommercial  Banks.  Despite  3,183  rural  branches,  rural  disbursements  of  CBs \nduring  FY2001  was  PRs21  billion  to  256,000  clients  or  PRs82,031  per  loan. \nLoans  for  agriculture  purposes  were  primarily  to  meet  mandatory  credit \nrequirements  and  were  confined  to  financing  of  marketing  operations  with \ncommodity stocks as collateral. \n\n10.  Minimal Income Expansion Through Informal Sources.  Interest  rate  charges  of  40-\n50%  p.a.  by  traders,  input  suppliers,  and  landlords  reflect  the  weak  bargaining  power of the \npoor.  The  interest  rate  is  even  higher  where  competition  from  the  formal  sector  is  weak. \nMoreover, because of its intermittent and short-term nature, credit from informal sources covers \nmainly temporary gaps in consumption and immediate unforeseen contingencies.  \n \n11. \nInitial  Success  in  Microfinance.  With  exclusive  focus  on  the  poor,  MF  is  a  new \nsubsector  comprising  Khushhalibank  (KB)  with  30  branches  and  First  Microfinance  Bank  with \n3 branches.  The  Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund  provides  wholesale  onlending  funds  to \nNGOs.  Short-term  noncollateralized  loans  of  PRs2,500-PRs10,000  at  18-22%  p.a.8  are \ndelivered to groups of poor. Viable interest rates, emphasis on savings, assured repeat loans, \nand building of clients\u2019 capacity ensure gender outreach and loan repayment.  \n \nB. \n  \n\nIssues and Opportunities  \n\n1. \n\nSystemic Weaknesses  \n\n \nThe Government\u2019s role in RF market development (para. 8) was to increase lending by \n12. \nreducing the costs and risks for RFIs in making loans to preferred clients because of perceived \nmarket  failures.  Government  farm  development  projects  treated credit as inputs like seed and \nfertilizers,  ignoring  that  credit  cannot  compensate  for  unprofitable  activities.  The  policy  and \ninstitutional framework did not recognize the challenges in RF: low population density, isolated \n\n                                                 \n7   Repayment rate in this document refers to collection as a percentage of loans due.  \n8  Some MF providers charge higher interest rates.  \n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\nmarkets,  lack  of  traditional  collateral,  high  income  fluctuation  in  poor  households,  and  limited \nopportunities for risk diversification. Seasonality of operations and high risks particularly due to \ndroughts and floods increased transaction costs. Despite some success in credit expansion and \nfood  production  in  the  1990s  and  1980s,  the  availability  of  term  credit  was  limited  and  the \nvolume  of  agriculture  credit  fell  compared  with  credit  for  manufacturing.  Weak  governance \naffected  both  the  quality  and  continuity  of  services.  Destructive  effects  on  CBs  and  RFIs \novershadowed any positive impacts.  \n \n13. \nThe  weak  sector  performance  confirms  the  lessons  learned  internationally  that \n(i) directed credit remains concentrated among a few; (ii) the benefits of cheap interest rates are \ncaptured  by  rural  elite,  thus  crowding  out  the  poor  and  resulting  in  misallocation  of  resources \nand production inefficiencies; (iii) prolonged dependence on subsidy undermines sustainability9 \nand integration with the financial markets; and (iv) repressive agriculture and exchange regime \npolicies,  weak  extension,  and  inadequate  rural  infrastructure  depress  rural  incomes  thus \nadversely  affecting  RF  markets.  Ignoring  the  expansion  of  nonfarm  income  reduces  the \npossibility  of  diversifying  risk  and  income  for  rural  households.  The  crucial  benefits  of  rural \nmonetary  savings  are  not  realized  due  to  perceptions  of  the  nonbankability  of  the  rural  poor. \nPoliticization  of  RF  increased  the  tolerance  for  loan  defaults,  waivers,  and  postponements  in \nPakistan. As a result, repayment rates remained low. RFIs designed in pursuit of and operated \nunder this paradigm were inevitably nonviable. Weak governance exacerbated their problems. \nWhere the state-owned RFIs failed, the private sector has not stepped in to fill the vacuum.  \n \n14. \nPersistence  of  these  trends  led  to  a  situation  where  the  upper  segments  of  the  RF \nmarket  can  access  the  rapidly  modernizing  urban  financial  markets,  but  others  have  to  rely \nlargely  on  household  savings  and  informal  sources.  The  investments  in  establishing  CBs  and \nRFIs thus bypassed large parts of the RF market, and the envisaged economic transformation \nin  an  equitable  manner  could  not  happen.  In  the  process,  RF  markets  remain  exposed  to \nfundamental  issues  relating  to:  (i)  immense  demand  and  sparse  coverage;  (ii)  underserved \nmiddle  and  lower  segments  of  the  RF  markets,  with  lack  of  access  for  the  poor;  (iii) \ninconsistency of products with demand profile; and (iv) poorly governed unsustainable RFIs.  \n \n\n \n2. \n \n15. \nThe objectives of the Government\u2019s Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan 2001/2011 \nand  the  Interim  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper  (IPRSP)  are  to  accelerate  gross  domestic \nproduct  growth,  reduce  unemployment,  eliminate  poverty,  and  encourage  the  private  sector. \nThe  aim  is  to  reduce  absolute  poverty  to  15%  in  2011,  among  others,  through  increased \neconomic opportunities and greater access to physical and social assets, and safety nets. The \nstrategy is to revive economic activity through reliance on 4 key sectors: agriculture, small- and \nmedium-scale enterprises, information technology, and energy. Supporting the expansion of MF \nthrough  a  range  of  institutions  and  initiatives  and  restructuring  ZTBL,  both  part  of  IPRSP,  are \nconsistent with the target to create 11.3 million jobs during 2001-2011 by promoting growth in \nlabor-intensive  sectors  of  agriculture  and  small-  and  medium-scale  enterprises.  Realization of \nthis aim requires stakeholder consensus and commitment for a properly sequenced integrated \napproach to RF sector development that involves: (i)  adopting a new paradigm with a redefined \ngovernment  role,  (ii)  determining  expectations  from  RF,  (iii)  continuing  consistency  and \ncommitment  to  reforms,  (iv)  reforming  institutions  for  sustainability  and  outreach,  and  (v) \nintroducing product and delivery innovations. \n                                                 \n9   Sustainability in this document refers to gaining client acceptance and ability to provide quality financial services to \nexisting  and  potential  clients  on  a  permanent  basis  without  the  need  for  government  or  external  support. \nCommercial  basis  refers  to  adoption  of  for-profit  orientation  in  administration  and  operations  to  attract  equity \ninvestments and mobilize resources from the market through savings and borrowings (also refer to footnote 28).  \n\nOpportunities  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fa. \n\nNew Paradigm with a Redefined Government Role  \n\n \n16.  \nLessons learned in RF (paras. 12-14) adapted to Pakistan\u2019s context translate into a new \nRF paradigm (i) where RF market development is placed in the broader perspective of financial \nsector development; (ii) that prioritizes interventions to complement, facilitate, and improve the \nfunctioning of the RF markets; and (iii) where government role is limited to direct interventions \nwhere  identifiable  market  failures  exist  and  cost-effective transparent means to address them \nare available. Government interventions should primarily relate to (i) creating conducive policies, \n(ii) promoting strategic initiatives with incentive programs that promote private sector role in RF \nto  supplement  the  efforts  of  existing  RFIs,  (iii)  strengthening  supervision  and  regulation, \n(iv) restructuring potentially viable RFIs that were weakened pursuing the old paradigm, and (v) \nrelaxing  credit  controls.  Government  concurs  with  the  new  RF  paradigm.  From  the  client\u2019s \nperspective,  the  new  paradigm  creates  opportunities  and  options  hitherto  unavailable  due  to \nlack  of  access  to  RF  services.  The  marginally  higher  financial  cost  that  may  result  due  to  the \nreforms is both affordable and way below the interest rate charged by informal sources.  \n \n17.   Healthy  and  competitive  RF  markets  will  be  best  served  by  strengthening  supervision \nand regulation and resolving conflict of interest in terms of central bank ownership of RFIs. The \nGovernment  must  avoid  the  temptation  of  using  financial  institutions  for  alleviating  broader \nsocial  and  developmental  problems \nfloods,  droughts,  and  natural  disasters. \nAddressing  policies  and  institutional  deficiencies  involve  significant  costs10  as  well  as  political \nand social resistance that can only be overcome by the Government and, hence the significance \nof its sustained commitment to reforms and continuity of RF in public policy domain.  \n \n\nfollowing \n\n  \n\nb. \n\nDetermination of Expectations from RF \n\n18. \nIncome  Expansion.  Changes  in  the  rural  economic  profile  brought  about  by  fast-\ngrowing  rural  cities  and  towns,  and  the  emergence  of  a  heterogeneous  nonfarm  economy \ncreate  new  opportunities  for  RF  markets  and  demand  for  RF  services.  The  rise  of  farm  and \nnonfarm  income  contributed  to  the  gradual  transformation  of  the  rural  economy.  As  incomes \nrose,  the  increased  demand  for  products  and  services  produced  in  the  nonfarm  sector \ncontributed to the emergence of rural enterprises. This development led to a range of activities: \nsupplying  seed,  fertilizers,  household  utensils,  clothing,  and  farm  equipment;  manufacturing; \nand  establishment  of  repair  shops  and  foundries.  Transport  and  trade  become  important with \nmarketable  farm  surpluses.  Moreover,  some  of  these  rural  enterprises  produce  goods  sold  in \nurban and export markets.  \n \n19. \nThe  expansion  of  rural  income  requires  complementary  development  of  RF  and \nnonfinancial markets. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded Agriculture Sector Program \nII11  is  supporting  fundamental  reforms,  with  emphasis  on  promoting  the  private  sector  through \nmarket-oriented  policies,  openness  to  international  trade,  and  strengthening  agriculture \nextension.  ADB-funded  ongoing  rural  development,  infrastructure,  and  energy  sector  projects \naim  at  enhancing  access  to  infrastructure  and  strengthening  social  capital.  Complementarity \nnecessitates  that  RF  markets  (i)  enable  clients  to  save  and  borrow  to  maximize  enterprise \n\n                                                 \n10 These include direct costs of building, equipping, and staffing banks. The borrower transaction cost includes value \nof time in accessing services, travel, and other noninterest costs. Even closing of banks involves significant costs.  \n11 ADB. 2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \nPakistan for the Agriculture Sector Program II. Manila. The loan intends to phase out government interventions in \nthe  markets  that  brought  the  prices  of  many  agricultural  commodities  below  international prices. Low prices and \nproductivity make it difficult for the agriculture sector to compete for investment capital compared to urban industrial \nprojects.  These  resulted  in  an  agriculture  growth  of  only  3%  p.a.  during  1990-1999,  hardly  sufficient  for  a \npopulation growth of 2.5% p.a. \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nbenefits, (ii) reduce transaction costs, (iii) support private initiatives, and (iv) raise resources by \nintegrating  with  broader  financial  markets.  Financial  institutions  must  efficiently  allocate \nresources  to  small  and  medium-scale  farmers  and  rural  enterprises,  \u201cthe  missing  middle,\u201d12 \nwhich remain grossly underserved by both RFIs and CBs and are not a natural MFI clientele.13 \n \nPoverty Reduction.  Robust  financial  markets  are  correlated  with  rural  growth  through \n20. \nefficient  resource  allocation,  savings  mobilization,  risk  mitigation,  and  facilitation  of  the \nexchange  of  goods  and  services.  Efficient  RF  markets  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by \nenabling  the  rural  households  to  respond  to  economic  and  technological  opportunities  that \ngenerate  employment  in  farm  and  rural  enterprises  and  establish  forward  and  backward \nlinkages in the rural economy. Efficient RF markets are critical for increasing rural incomes in \nPakistan where widespread poverty exists and the current outreach of RF is minimal. However, \nthe  increasing  average  income  may  not  be  equitably  shared  due  to  unequal  wealth  and  skill \nendowments.  Moreover,  given  the  high  rural  poverty  incidence,  large  numbers  of  poor \nhouseholds  will  continue  to  have  inadequate  or  no  access  to  formal  sources  of  RF,  as  retail \ninstitutional  capacity  can  only  be  built  over  the  medium  term.  In  the  rural  economy,  the  poor \nproduce mainly for subsistence, except for some export crops. Food sufficiency is the primary \nobjective, most inputs are nontradable (labor, manure, and seeds), production is low and mostly \nconsumed, and little cash income is generated. As a result, poverty is perpetuated. Vulnerability \nto  risks  remains  high  with  significant  underemployment  and  unemployment.  Lack  of  access  to \nfinancial services impairs the ability of the poor to respond to market opportunities.  \n \n21. \nA poverty reduction goal for RF, therefore, is proactive promotion of the MF subsector to \nmaximize the poverty reduction impact in combination with the income expansion strategy. This \nis  the  rationale  for  the  ongoing  ADB-funded  Microfinance  Sector  Development  Program \n(MSDP).14  The  MF  Institutions  Ordinance  2001  promulgated  under  MSDP  enables  the \nestablishment  of  sustainable  MFIs  targeting  the  poor  households  under  a  conducive  policy \nframework. The ordinance defines and categorizes MFIs (national, provincial, and district); and \ndescribes  their  licensing  procedures  and  equity  requirements,  and  supervisory  and  regulatory \nframework.  Support  to  MFIs,  particularly  in  their  initial  start-up  phase,  can  yield  high  social \nreturns  through  greater  outreach,  provided  that  the  support  is  transparent,  time  bound,  and \nlinked to performance. The Government strongly supports and encourages the establishment of \nMFIs as an appropriate public-private partnership in poverty reduction.  \n\n \nc. \n\nConsistency, Commitment, and Continuity of Reforms  \n\n \nBanking sector problems in Pakistan are rooted in political interference in lending, loan \n22. \ncollection, and loan write-offs. Much like the repressive policies of the past, weak governance, \nand  lack  of  competition  equally  affected  the  CBs  as  they  did  the  RFIs.  Ongoing  CB  reforms, \ntherefore,  aim  to  improve  governance,  supervision,  and  enforcement  of  banking  courts.  The \nWorld  Bank  has  supported  restructuring,  downsizing,  and  privatization  of  CBs,  and  reducing \nnonperforming  loans  (NPLs).15  Distortions  implicit  in  managed  interest  rates  have  been \n                                                 \n12 Rural Financial Markets in Asia: Policies, Paradigms and Performance. This is part (volume 3) of ADB. 2000. Study \n\nof Rural Asia. Oxford University Press. New York. \n\n13 MF  is  more  suited  to  clients  with  regular  cash  flows  that  require  small  short-term  noncollateralized  loans,  not \nfarmers with seasonal cash flows and rural enterprises with large medium -to-long-term credit requirements. While \nRFIs also provide MF, in essence RFIs and MFIs complement each other by addressing segments of the broader \nRF markets. RFIs are more affected by farmer exposure to risks of floods and droughts. \n\n14  ADB. 2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \nPakistan  for  the  Microfinance  Sector  Development  Program.  Manila.  KB  and  the  First  Microfinance  Bank  have \nbeen established under the MSDP framework. \n\n15 Financial Sector Deepening and Intermediation Project (1994); Banking Sector Adjustment Loan (1997); Banking \n\nSector Restructuring and Privatization Project (2001); and Banking Sector Technical Assistance (2002). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fremoved.  The  CB  reforms  were  extended  to  state-owned  development  finance  institutions  to \nreduce  their  number  and  consolidate  operations.16  These  development  finance  institutions  will \ninitially  be  retained  in  the  public  sector  due  to  the  time  required  to  (i)  remedy  the  effects  of \ndecades of politicization and misdirected subsidies, and (ii) generate private sector alternatives \nand investments. Similarly, closure of nonviable RFIs and strengthening of weak RFIs should be \npursued  with  emphasis  on  good  governance,  sustainability,  depoliticization,  and  privatization. \nAid  agencies  should  refrain  from  credit  only  interventions  and  shift  to  projects that emphasize \npolicy and governance issues. External support is essential for institutional building, the need for \nwhich is pervasive.  \n\nd. \n\nInstitutional Reforms for Sustainability and Outreach  \n\n \n\n \n\n23.  Maximizing  sustainability  and  outreach  is  critical  for  meeting  expectations  from  RF. \nLessons  learned  in  banking  reforms  emphasize  in-depth  financial  and  institutional  analysis; \nupfront commitment to good governance, institutional autonomy, and lending discipline; phasing \nof reforms on the capacity  to manage and institutionalize changes; and sequencing to minimize \nservice  disruption.  Evaluation  of  ADB-funded  credit  projects  through  development  finance \ninstitutions  strongly  suggests  more  direct  assistance  for  institutional  strengthening  and \noperational  efficiency.17  Considering  the  time  required  for  building  consensus  for  fundamental \nRFI reforms, preparatory measures for RFI reforms were initiated under the MSDP in 2001. \n \n24. \nZarai  Taraqiati  Bank  Limited.  The  period  from  the  early  1970s  to  mid-1990s  saw \nextensive  external  support  for  ZTBL.  The  World  Bank,  International  Fund  for  Agricultural \nDevelopment, and ADB18 provided 16 projects worth $987 million during 1965-1991. These first \ngeneration  projects  prioritized  agriculture  credit  over  governance  and  sustainability.  Donor \ninterest  in  ZTBL  waned  due  to  financial  and  liquidity  problems,  unsatisfactory  accounting \npractices,  poor  repayment  rate,  and  frequent  loan  waivers.  This  led  to  the  cancellation  of  the \nAgriculture Credit Project in 1994.19 SBP refinance that replaced project credit lines weakened \nfinancial  discipline  and  depressed  savings,  which  is  less  than  2%  of  the  liabilities.  Poorly \ntargeted  subsidized  loans  encouraged  rent-seeking  behavior  that  was  exacerbated  by  poor \ngovernance.  Limited  accountability  led  to  lack  of  motivation  to  pursue  viable  operations  and \nresist  politicization.  Notwithstanding  the  marginal  improvements  noted  lately,  difficulties  are \ncompounded by profligate practices and overheads accumulated during the 1990s, particularly \nthe increase in staff that raised transaction costs without efficiency gains.  \n \n25. \nDespite  weaknesses,  ZTBL  remains  the  key  RFI  with  the  largest  borrower  base. \nEmpirical  evidence  shows  that  when  the  financial  sector  is  liberalized  and  repressive  policies \nlifted,  CBs  close  rural  branches,  minimize  small  transactions,  and  thereby  restrict  access  of \nsmall  clients  with  negative  overall  consequences.20  This  is  true  for  Pakistan  (para.  28). \n                                                 \n16 Federal  Bank  for  Cooperatives,  Bankers  Equity  Limited,  and  National  Development  Finance  Corporation  have \neither been closed or are under liquidation.

Informal Financial Markets Under Liberalization in four African Countries. \n\n7\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nConsidering the client profile, nature of business, and the status of rural infrastructure, it does \nnot  appear  likely  that  RF  will  attract  large  private  commercial  interest  immediately  or  without \nincentives. Therefore, RFIs with probability of turnaround need to be strengthened through good \ngovernance,  a  core  theme  of  the  ADB  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (2002-2006). This will \npromote institutional diversity to provide quality and quantity of services and increase options for \nthe  clients.  Therefore,  in  response  to  stakeholder  consensus21  MSDP  funded  a  portfolio  audit \nand the preparation of a restructuring plan for ZTBL. \n  \n26. \nThe Government opted for ZTBL restructuring considering the demand and supply gap \nfor  institutional  RF  services  and  the  growing  rural-urban income disparities. Cost-effective and \nrealistic  alternatives  that  could  substitute  for  ZTBL  outreach  are  not  immediately  available. \nMajority of clients repay their loans and ZTBL\u2019s nationwide network provides greater capacity to \nwithstand  effects  of  localized  shocks  and  can  provide  the  liquidity  needed  by  affected \nhouseholds. The cost of liquidating ZTBL, both financial and political, is significantly higher than \nthe  estimated  restructuring  cost  (para.  58).  Undefined  pension  liabilities,  staff  redundancy, \nplummeting prospects of recovery of uncovered NPLs in view of liquidation, and the concurrent \nimpact on SBP balance sheet could exceed $1 billion. Liquidation will also result in opportunity \nloss in terms of income and employment for both existing clients and for potential clients.22  \n \n27. \nThere is little justification for closing ZTBL and establishing another state-owned RFI, for \nwhich  additional  costs  will  have  to  be  incurred.  Private  sector  capacity  or  interest  to  acquire \nZTBL and continue its rural operations does not exist. Increasing the mandatory credit quota of \nCBs  instead  of  closing  ZTBL  was  considered  inconsistent  with  the  banking  reforms.  Unless \npreceded  by  restructuring,  dividing  ZTBL  into  provincial  entities  would  simply  divide  the \nproblems into smaller packets. Merger with a CB is not feasible, as distinct orientations within a \nsingle entity will be difficult to assimilate in view of ZTBL\u2019s size and the depth of issues.  \n \n28. \nCommercial Banks.  Although half the branches of CBs are located in rural areas, the \nrural  credit-to-deposit  ratio  is  12.5%  and  rural  credit  is  only  6%  of  the  total  CB  advances. \nReverse  resource  flow  occurs  since  three  fourths  of  the  total  CB  credit  is  concentrated  in  7 \ncities.  This  is  natural  from  CB  perspective,  as  returns  on  rural  investment  projects  are  lower \nthan those from the urban trading or manufacturing sector. While under Government directions \nCBs  had  to  establish  rural  branches,  their  institutional  design  and  orientation  remained  urban. \nNearly 500 loss-incurring branches, mostly rural, have been closed as part of CB restructuring \nand  privatization.  Rural  service  delivery  could  be  further  affected,  as  more  branches  could  be \nclosed.  Nevertheless,  unlike  RFIs  that  have  functioned  as  disbursing  windows,  CBs  have \nmobilized  rural  savings  for  lending.  Their  reluctance  to  extend  rural  credit  stems  from  the \nvitiated RF markets due to the overt politicization of RFIs.  CBs have, therefore, not invested in \nsuccessful RF technologies. Strengthening of the rural operations of CBs could bring substantial \noutreach gains. The CBs are also open to portfolio diversification due to the pressure on their \nmargins in densely banked urban centers. \n\n29. \nCooperatives.  Cooperatives  met  with  little  success  and  have  been  mired  in  financial \nmisappropriations due to politicization and domination by the rural elite (para. 44). Cooperatives \nsuffer  from  (i) uneven  coverage,  with  no  presence  in  two  thirds  of  the  villages;  (ii)  lack  of \naccountability  and  professional  management;  (iii)  poor  portfolio  management;  and  (iv) weak \nsupervisory  capacity  of  the  provincial  cooperative  departments.  Ineligibility  of  those  without \nimmovable properties excludes the poor and women. Nearly two thirds of the 65,000 societies \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 1995.

MSDP therefore supported the closure \nof the  Federal  Bank  for  Cooperatives,  the  apex  of  the  three-tier cooperative credit structure. \nPCBs  and  cooperative  societies  are  the  second  and  third  tiers.  Refinance  to  PCBs  was \nanchored  to  treasury-bill  rates  for  instilling  financial  discipline.  This  strategy  paid  off,  as \nnonviable  PCBs  have  been  closed  or  are  in  the  process  of  being  closed.  Except for Punjab \nPCB, the rest have little prospect of viability.  \n\n \n\n  \n\ne. \n\nProduct and Delivery Innovations  \n\n30. \nLeasing and Insurance. The legal, policy, and institutional frameworks for leasing and \ninsurance are well developed. However, leasing and insurance services have not made a dent \nin rural areas because of limited opportunities for viable operations, scant client information to \nassess  risks,  high  administrative  costs  due  to  widely  dispersed  clients,  and  weak  contract \nenforcement. Most insurance and leasing experiments in rural areas in the past were linked to \nCBs  and  RFIs.  Like  in  other  countries  in  the  region,  crop  and  calamity  insurance  schemes \ninitiated  in  Pakistan  failed  to  become  viable.  SBP  guarantee  for  CB  rural  loans  also  could  not \ncover credit risks and administrative costs. The associated moral hazards and general decline in \nRFI performance dampened the response of potential service providers.  \n \n31.  While leasing can expand in rural areas through linkages with CBs, ZTBL, and MFIs, no \nsustainable  mechanism  for  crop  and  calamity  insurance  has  emerged.  Parts  of  the  country \nremain  under  successive  droughts24  that  affect  the  rural  households  as  well  as  the  banks. \nPrivate and public response for expanding insurance services in rural areas is contingent upon \nan  efficient  ZTBL  and  expanded  rural  portfolio  of  CBs.  It  will,  thus,  be  proper  to  prioritize  the \nreforms to enhance the outreach of the primary demand for savings and credit. In the interim, a \npilot  insurance  scheme  drawing  on  successful  international  practices  should  be  launched  in \nselected districts.25  \n \nLessons from Informal Sources.  Decreasing the role of moneylenders and increasing \n32. \nthe  role  of  commercial  interests  represented  by  traders,  input  suppliers,  and  land-based \narrangements  characterize  the  informal  sources.26  These  commercial  classes  could  possibly \nprovide  limited  retail  onlending  services  by  borrowing  from  formal  sources  and  in  the  process \novercome  the  limitation  of  scale,  risk,  and  term  diversification.  However,  this  is  not  a  practical \noption  in  view  of  the  supervisory  issues  involved.  The  interest  charges  may  yet  remain \nexorbitant.  There  are  a  few,  if  any,  activities  that  can  absorb  interest  charges  from  informal \nsources and yet leave sufficient household surplus (para. 10). The larger issue though relates to \nsocial equity. The commercial classes largely represent the rural elite. A banking role will further \nconsolidate their dominance reflected in the disproportionate share of and continued preferential \naccess  to  resources.  In  view  of  this,  it  is  preferable  that  formal  sources  extend  their  RF \noutreach,  drawing  on  the  low  transaction  cost  and  short  transaction  time  dimensions  of  the \ninformal sources. The resulting competition will better serve both the poor and nonpoor clients.  \n\n                                                 \n23  Muhammad  Jameel  Khan.  1997.

Washington, D.C. \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10\n\n \n\n3. \n\nOverall Rationale  \n\n \n33. \nRural  households  have  bankable  demand  for  credit  and  savings.  The  large  unmet \ndemand  for  RF  services  constrains  the  adoption  of  new  technologies  in  agriculture  and  rural \nenterprises.  Yield  gaps  are  significant  between  farmers  that  have  access  to  institutional credit \nand  those  that  do  not.27  Rural  enterprises  that  have  access  to  savings  and  credit  have  been \nable to allocate resources to potential investment with highest returns, a step that is especially \nsignificant for diversifying income and risks in view of the seasonality of agriculture. Continuous \naccess  to  financial  services  at  affordable  prices28  is  critical  for  the  poor  to  cross  as  well  as \nremain above the poverty threshold. Due to lack of access to RF, the prospects of the majority \nof rural households to benefit from an improving economic climate remain constrained and rural \nemployment generation stunted. Poverty incidence, in all probability has gone beyond the stated \n32.2%  due  to  successive  droughts  in  many  parts  of  the  country  in  the  last  2  years. Rural \nincomes are one third less than those in urban areas. \n \n34. \nHealthy  and  well-functioning  RF  markets  are  directly  related  to  achieving  the  two  key \nnational policy objectives: accelerating rural and agriculture growth, and reducing poverty. The \nrealization  of  these  objectives  depends  on  the  simultaneity  of  developments  in  RF  and \nnonfinancial markets to foster the creation of diverse sources of RF, build sustainable financial \ninstitutions,  and  stimulate  product  and  capital  flows  in  the  rural sector.  For this, RF must be \nseen  as  an  integral  part  of  equitable  development  within  a  framework  of  macroeconomic \nstability  as  enumerated  in  the  IPRSP.  The  ongoing  structural  adjustment  lays  the  basis  for \nfundamental  reforms  for  RF  market  development.  The  recurring  financial  drain  in  pursuing  the \nold  RF  paradigm  and  the  narrowing  fiscal  space  have  also  prompted  a  shift  in  Government \nstrategy that now seeks viable intermediaries for enhancing outreach. For the majority, access \nto affordable RF services is also important to enable them to compete in the post-World Trade \nOrganization scenario. Inability to compete because of high financial costs could reduce income \nof  the  majority  of  farmers,  particularly  the  small  and  subsistence  farmers.  Lack  of  access  to \naffordable RF services will also prevent them from switching to nonfarm activities.  \n \n\nIII.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  \n\n \nThe Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement signed by the Government and ADB on \n35. \n16  September  2002  includes  employment  generation,  pro-poor asset creation, promoting RF \nintermediation,  and  increasing  private  sector  role  for  sustainable  growth  with  emphasis  on \nagriculture and rural development. Support for RF is also part of the ADB Country Strategy and \nProgram    (2002-2006)  for  promoting  growth  and  stability  of  rural  income  and  employment.  To \naccomplish this, an integrated package of policy and institutional strengthening is needed. The \nsector development program modality was, therefore, chosen to foster a long-term, sectorwide \nperspective that can yield considerable benefits. Following CB and capital market 29 reforms and \nthe successful MSDP implementation, the Government submitted a RF Action Plan and sought \nADB support for strengthening the RF sector. The Rural and MF  Committee of ADB discussed \nthe  RF  Action  Plan  in  March  2002.  Program  formulation  was  closely  coordinated  with  various \nstakeholders including SBP, the private sector, and development partners. The agreements on \nRFSDP  are  reflected  in  the  Government\u2019s  development  policy  letter  and  the  attached  policy \nmatrix and RF Sector Plan (Appendix 2). The program framework is in Appendix 3.  \n\n                                                 \n27  International Food Policy Research Institute, Pakistan Panel Survey, cited in Von Barun, Malik and Zeller (1993). \n28 Financial intermediaries determine lending interest rate based on cost of resources, efficiency, scale of operations, \nrisk perception, and competition. In the context of Pakistan the interest rate charged by KB at 18-20% p.a. is the \nbest available proxy for a reasonable or affordable as well as institutionally viable lending interest rate.  \n\n29 ADB.1997.Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Pakistan \n\nfor the Capital Market Development Program and Capacity Enhancement of the Securities Market. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fObjectives and Scope  \n\nA. \n \n36. \nThe Program is designed to assist the Government in accelerating rural economic growth \nby addressing key constraints to RF.  The goal is to enhance the outreach of RF services. The \nobjective  is  to  establish  a  sustainable  RF  system  that  can  enable  the  clients  to  benefit  from \neconomic  opportunities  for  increasing  incomes  and  employment. RFSDP will help diversify the \nsources  of  income  of  rural  households  thereby  reducing  their  vulnerability  to  risks.  A  range  of \nservices will help RF clients, especially the poor, to monetize their savings and simultaneously \nincrease the lendable resources of RFIs. The private sector will be provided with incentives to \nincrease  investment  in  RF.  Good  governance  will  be  at  the  core  of  the  reforms  to  ensure \nequitable  access  for  those  hitherto  excluded.  The  reform  measures  have  natural  synergy  with \nthe agriculture sector reforms and MSDP interventions. \n \nThe RFSDP consists of two components with common objectives: (i) a program or policy \n37. \nreform loan, and (ii) a project or institutional strengthening loan. Policy reforms for strengthening \nRF  markets  are  required  to  achieve  the  key  objectives  of  the  Government\u2019s  Ten-Year \nPerspective  Development  Plan  2001-2011  and  the  IPRSP.  The  project  loan  for  institutional \nstrengthening will enhance institutional capacity to channel investments in the rural sector. The \nreforms will cover  policy,  governance,  institutions,  and  operations.  From  a  sector  perspective, \nthe RFSDP will cover SBP, CBs, ZTBL, cooperatives, and MFIs.  \n \nB. \n \n\nThe Program Loan  \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n \n38. \nThe program goals are to ensure the majority of rural households permanent access to \ninstitutional  financial  services  at  minimal  transaction  cost  and  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation in the RF sector. The specific objective is to develop a sustainable RF system for \nproviding affordable services, primarily to  the lower segments of the RF markets to significantly \nraise  their  income  and  reduce  poverty.  Increased  financial  intermediation  will  give  RF  clients \nopportunities  to  increase  incomes  and  employment  and  improve  their  quality  of  life  through \naccess to a strengthened and responsive RF system.  \n \n\nComponents and Outputs  \n\n2. \n \n39. \nThe  program  loan  has  4  components:  (i)  creating  a  favorable  policy  environment,  (ii) \ninstitutional  restructuring  and  reforms,  (iii)  new  bank  fund,  and  (iv)  product  and  process \ninnovations. \n\na. \n\nCreating a Favorable Policy Environment \n\n \n40. \nThe reforms in Pakistan aim to develop a market-oriented, predominantly private-owned \nfinancial sector, performing efficient intermediation through innovative products and services.30 \nThe  reforms  will  allow  a  fair  return  to  shareholders  and  promote  sustainable  and  equitable \ngrowth.  While  RF  in  general  is  subject  to  these  reforms,  the  following  will  be  continued  and \nextended as part of the RFSDP.  \n  \n\nSavings  and  credit,  and  rural  instead  of  agriculture,  will  be  the  policy  goal  for \nmeeting the heterogeneous demand for RF services.  \n\n \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n30 Dr. Ishrat Hussain, Governor, SBP. 2002. Financial Sector in Pakistan: Future Strategic Direction. Karachi.     \n\n11\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fRFIs will not be subject to lending interest rate ceilings. 31  \n\nThe  Government  will  not  intervene  for  pardoning  outstanding  loan  repayments, \ndiscouraging debt recovery, and granting interest remissions.  \n\nThe  mandate  of  the  Agriculture  Credit  Department  of  SBP  will  be  reviewed  by \nSBP to ensure active participation in RFSDP. The existing MF Support Division \nof SBP will be enlarged to Rural and MF Support Division.  \n\nSBP will not hold equity in RFIs to avoid conflict of interest. SBP equity in ZTBL \nwill be converted to subordinated debt (tier 2 capital).  \n\nSBP  will  only  be  the  lender  of  last  resort  to  RFIs  and  not  a  refinancing  agency \nusing its own resources.32  \n\n(vii)  MFIs  under  the  MFI  Ordinance,  as  a  subset  of  the  RF,  targeted  at  poor \nhouseholds,  will  be  the  preferred  institutional  form  for  extending  outreach.  MFI \nlicenses will be granted to investors that meet the eligibility criteria.33  \n\n \n(viii)  RFIs will be subject to prudential regulations on par with CBs.34  \n\nThe business judgment of CBs on their portfolio exposure will be respected. SBP \nwill phase out the mandatory credit quotas on agriculture credit for CBs.  \n\nMagisterial powers delegated to ZTBL for collecting overdue loans will be phased \nout.  Like  other  banks,  ZTBL  will  use  the  provisions  of  the  Banking  Companies \nOrdinance for collection of overdue agriculture loans as arrears of land revenue. \n\n \n\nb. \n\nInstitutional Restructuring and Reforms  \n\n \n41. \nRestructuring ZTBL. Broader structural reforms and a shift in the RF paradigm do not \nautomatically  result  in  the  emergence  of  sustainable  RFIs.  Concerted  efforts  are  required  to \nreform  RFIs  with  emphasis  on  removing  the  causes  of  weaknesses  rather  than  their  effects. \nWith  the  right  policies  and  strategies,35  openness  to  learn  from  mistakes,  and  stakeholder \ncoordination and commitment, it is possible to reform ZTBL. With these preconditions, the  Bank \nRakyat Indonesia (Unit Desas) was restructured into a highly profitable entity from a politicized \nand  loss-incurring  credit  agency  for  rice  farmers.  Other  successful  cases  include  Bank \nPertanian  Malaysia  and  the  Bagricola  in  the  Dominican  Republic.  In  contrast,  the  strategy  to \nclose RFIs in Latin America and West Africa resulted in a situation where rural and agricultural \ncredit  all  but  dried  up.  Experience  is  negative  when  reforms  do  not  accompany  financial \nliberalization and stakeholder commitment is not maintained.  36 \n \n\n                                                 \n31 While no interest rate ceilings apply, this is to ensure that pricing autonomy of RFIs is maintained.  \n32 In the interim, already committed refinance facility could continue.  \n33 For expanding outreach in rural areas, new MFIs with rural focus will be permitted as a special case.  \n34 MFIs under MFI Ordinance 2001 will be subject to the supervisory and regulatory framework prescribed by SBP.  \n35  These  include  good  governance,  management  autonomy,  staff  policies  that  stress  accountability and incentives, \nlow  transaction  costs,  flexible  product  design,  effective  risk  management  and  monitoring,  savings  emphasis, \npositive real lending rates, diversified portfolio, and advanced information systems.  \n\n36  Hans  Dieter  Seibel.  2000.  Rural  Finance  Working  Paper  No.  A7a  on  Agriculture  Development  Bank  Reform , \nInternational  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development.  Rome.  With  reform  technologies  available,  RFI  restructuring  is \npossible, provided conducive policies and commitment to reform exist. \n\n(ii) \n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n12\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fCreated  and  operated  under  the  old  paradigm  that  repressed  viable \n\n42. \nfinancial \nintermediation through inexpensive funds under weak governance, ZTBL had large overheads \nand  systemic  inefficiencies.  While  these  constraints  seemed  intractable  in  the  past,  in  the \ncontext  of  the  ongoing  financial  sector  reforms  it  is  possible  to  restructure  ZTBL  by \nfundamentally altering the norms of governance and operations. The sunk costs represented by \na  nationwide  branch  network,  often  at  remote  rural  areas,  could  be  put  to  efficient  use  by \nreengineering and implementing a strict program for reaching financial targets. Restructuring will \nbe cost-effective compared with the significant political and financial cost of closing ZTBL (para. \n26).  ZTBL\u2019s  success  on  outreach  goals  is  important  for  the  rural  sector  to  catalyze  private \ninvestment in RF by demonstrating that the rural clients are bankable. 37  \n\n \n43. \nThe  following  actions  have  been  initiated  as  part  of  the  RFSDP.  They  incorporate  the \nrecommendations of the portfolio audit and restructuring plan prepared with MSDP support, and \ndemonstrate Government commitment to a sustainable ZTBL.  \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nGovernance.  ZTBL  was  incorporated  under  the  Company  Law  on  23  October \n2002 with an  authorized capital of  PRs25 billion  ($417  million).  The  Articles  of \nAssociation  for  ZTBL  provide  for  a  majority  private  sector  board  drawn  from \nqualified  professionals.  The  Memorandum  of  Association  of  ZTBL  state \noperational  viability,  farm  and  nonfarm  scope,  and  small  farmer  and  gender \nfocus. A new team will replace the current management of line departments.  \n\nFinancial  Restructuring.  Financial  restructuring  is  meant  to  provide  for \nuncovered bad and doubtful debts estimated at PRs12 billion ($200 million)38 and \nother  assets  of  about  PRs6.8  billion  ($114  million),  identified  by  the  portfolio \naudit,  to  ensure  that  the  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  ZTBL  remains  above  10%  of \nrisk-weighted assets. Government debt of PRs16.4 billion ($274 million) to ZTBL \nhas  been  converted  into  ZTBL  equity  after  adjusting  ZTBL  claims  on  the \nGovernment.39 Further, the Government will provide cash equity of PRs10 billion \n(about  $170  million)  in  3  tranches  provided  ZTBL  meets  agreed  performance \nindicators.  SBP  equity  in  ZTBL  (PRs3.2  billion)  has  been  converted  into \nsubordinated  debt.40  Restated  balance  sheet  of  ZTBL  is  in  Appendix  4  (Tables \nA4.3 and A4.4). \n\nOrganization.  Closing  top-heavy  administrative  units  and  deploying  staff  at \nbranches  will  reduce  administrative  costs.  Staff  with  inconsistent  skills  will  be \ngradually phased out to reduce the cost of service delivery. Already 2,000 staff, \nabout  one  fourth  of  the  total  staff,  have  opted for a golden handshake scheme. \nSignificant  investments  will  be  made  in  human  resource  development  and  staff \nincentives will be modified to recognize and reward performance. \n\nInstitutional  Strengthening.  Reorienting, \nrepackaging \nproducts  and  services,  and  systems  and  procedures  will  ensure  minimal \ntransaction  cost.  Information  technology  (IT)  and  management  information \n\nredesigning,  and \n\n                                                 \n37 The Bank  for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (Thailand) reaches about 85% of the rural households and \nViet Nam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development about 40%. Most of the rural households save with the Unit \nDesa System of Bank Rakyat Indonesia. It also provides credit facilities to nearly one fifth of the rural households.  \n38  Uncovered  provisions  are  over  and  above  the  provisions  already  made  in  compliance  with  SBP  prudential \n\nguidelines. Other adjustments mainly relate to loans waived under Government directives.  \n\n39 These mainly relate to loan waivers granted on Government directives.  \n40 At 30 June 2002, ZTBL equity after adjustments is PRs8.74 billion (Appendix 4, Tables A4.3 and A4.4). \n\n13\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nsystem  (MIS)  architecture  will  be  upgraded  to  support  good  governance  in  line \nwith international best practices in business processes.   \n\nBusiness Strategy. The aim is to reach 600,000 clients by end-2005 compared \nwith  the  current  417,000  by  adopting  efficient  practices,  undertaking  due \ndiligence  in  loan  appraisal,  maintaining  satisfactory  portfolio  quality,  and \nmobilizing  deposits.  Improvements  in  loan  collection  will  be  the  key  criteria  for \nviability.  Management  and  control  of  risks,  especially  delinquency,  will  be \nstrengthened.  Lending  will  be  from  repayments  and  deposit  mobilization  until \nZTBL significantly improves its repayment rate. ZTBL will aim to serve more new \nclients as against the practice of rolling over existing loans. \n\nPerformance  Benchmarking.  ZTBL  will  be  evaluated  based  on  agreed \nperformance indicators (Appendix 4, Table A4.5), including implementation of the \nrestructuring  plan.  Achievement  of  performance  indicators  is  related  to  the \ntranche-release conditions (Appendix 2).  \n\n \n(vii)  Privatization.  The  Government  will  divest  a  reasonable  number  of  shares  of \nZTBL  through  an  initial  public  offering  or  other  methods  of  sale  to  the  private \nsector within 3 years.  \n\n \n(viii)  Anticorruption.  Forensic  accounting  capability  will  be  installed  to  support  the \naudit committee of ZTBL in tracking and minimizing corruption cases. Wherever \nnecessary,  ZTBL  will \nthe  National  Accountability  Bureau,  an \nanticorruption body,  to pursue willful defaulters and corrupt staff.  \n \n\ninvolve \n\n44. \nReforms in  Cooperatives.  The  RFSDP  supports  attrition  for  institutions  that  have  no \nturnaround prospects and remain terminally dependent on budgetary transfer. Cooperatives are \nprovincial  subjects  with  differing  expectations.  The  depth  and  breadth  of  issues  involved  and \nprovincial variations are too numerous and intractable for instituting a restructuring plan with a \nreasonable chance of success. For instance, the cooperative societies need to mobilize savings \nfor sustainability. This, however, is neither permissible nor desirable due to domination of vested \ninterests,  history  of  misappropriations,  and  lack  of  sound  regulatory  structure.  The  present \nsituation  calls  for  a  selective  second-look  at  the  cooperative  societies,  the  essential  building \nblocks, rather than restructuring of largely dormant PCBs. The RFSDP will therefore support \n\ntransformation of PCBs into provincial MFIs under the MFI Ordinance 2001. This \nwill  enable  upfront  introduction  of  RF  best  practices,  broaden  the  scope  from \nagriculture credit to RF, and introduce SBP supervision. These MFIs can use the \neligible cooperative societies for service delivery; and  \n\npreparation  of  the  Credit  Union  Plan  to  leverage  the  network  of  genuine \ncooperative societies for greater outreach.41 The Credit Union Plan will include a \nframework  for  modifications  in  structure,  constitution,  accreditation  criteria, \nsystems,  by-laws, and  supervisory  arrangements  of  cooperative  societies.  The \nCredit Union Plan will be implemented on a pilot basis in up to four districts. \n\n \n45. \nStrengthening Commercial Bank Rural Operations. By the end of 2003, it is expected \nthat  three  fourths  of  the  CBs  will  become  privately  owned.  An  improved  RF  environment  will \n\n                                                 \n41 Credit  unions  are  formal  sector,  member-owned  nonbank  financial  institutions  that  mobilize  savings  and  make \nloans to members. ADB has supported credit unions in Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nc. \n\nNew Bank Fund  \n\nenable  CBs  to  capitalize  their  rural  presence  and  natural  strength  in  catering  to  the  upper \nsegments of the RF market. As part of the RFSDP, a RF Resource Center will be established at \nthe  National  Institute  of  Banking  and  Finance,  an  SBP  subsidiary,  to  strengthen  CB  rural \noperations  by  (i)  creating  awareness  of  the  possibilities,  prospects,  and  risks  in  RF;  (ii) \nimproving  governance  of  RF  operations;  (iii)  developing  demand  adapted  products  and \nservices, with recognition of gender dimensions; (iv) instituting enhanced portfolio management \ncapability; and (v) installing systems and procedures for reducing costs. \n \n \n \n46. \nThe lowest market segment (para. 4) constitutes nearly half the farm holdings and nearly \nhalf  of  the  rural  microenterprises.  These,  as  well  as  subsistence  nonfarm  activities  such  as \nlivestock  and  fishery  have  little  access  to  institutional  credit.  Because  of  limited  assets  and \nskills, the landless and tenant farmers remain unemployed or underemployed. As a result, self-\nperpetuating poverty afflicts nearly half the people in these categories. The slow transformation \nof  economic  growth  into  household  gains  can  only  be  overcome  by  interventions  that  directly \nreach  the  lowest  segment  of  the  RF  market  for  (i)  reducing  poverty,  (ii)  slowing  rural-urban \nmigration, and (iii) promoting broad-based rural growth.  \n \n47. \nThe  consensus  is  to  leverage  the  MSDP  framework  through  incentives  designed  to \n(i) overcome  barriers  to  financial  intermediation  such  as  lack  of  institutions;  (ii)  accelerate  and \nsupport  institutional  development;  and  (iii)  provide  limited  onlending  support  until  new  MFIs \nhave  established  credibility  and  a  track  record  to  borrow  from  the  market.  The  public-private \npartnership  for  poverty  reduction  established  under  MSDP  (para.  21)  will  be  extended  by \nestablishing a New Bank Fund (NBF), worth $15 million, with SBP to encourage the emergence \nof MFIs in rural areas, especially at the provincial and district levels, and to facilitate the delivery \nof MF services to the lowest segment of the RF markets (Appendix 5).  \n \nSBP Act of 1956 provides for the creation of and management of funds by SBP. SBP will \n48. \nprepare  detailed  rules  for  operating  NBF.  The  rules  will  include  (i)  fund  description  and \ndefinitions, (ii) objectives and purposes, (iii) contributions and investments, (iv) governance and \nadministration, (v) annual reports and audits, (vi) eligible institutions, and (vii) qualifying criteria. \nThe eligible MFIs will abide by SBP-approved business plan including gender outreach targets. \nNBF  will  provide  institutional  strengthening  loans  at  soft  terms  not  exceeding  half  the  initial \nequity investment by the promoters. The loans will be converted  into subordinated debt after 3 \nyears provided that MFIs attain a predetermined self-sufficiency standard. MFIs eligible to draw \non NBF resources will also have access to the credit line and specialized funds42 under MSDP \nprovided they meet the requirements.  \n \n49.   NBF  and  its  linkages  with  MSDP  will  ensure  the  gender  orientation  of  MFIs,  their \nproducts, and delivery mechanisms. The institutional strengthening support from NBF is meant \nto  meet  the  costs  for  enhancing  women\u2019s  access  to  MF,  which  are  significantly  higher  due  to \nconstraints on mobility and social interaction. The institutional strengthening component will help \nup-front investments in mobile units to enable MF service delivery to remote rural communities, \nand  recruit,  train,  and  retain  women  staff.  Further,  the  eligibility  of  MFIs  to  access  the \nspecialized long-term funds for social mobilization and community investment under MSDP will \nensure  that  social  intermediation  and  access  to  basic  infrastructure  precede  as  well  as \naccompany MF services.  \n \n\n                                                 \n42 MF Social Development Fund, Community Investment Fund, Deposit Protection Fund, and Risk Mitigation Fund.  \n\n15\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16\n\n \n\n50. \nInterest  in  establishing  MFIs  originates  from  private  investors  including  overseas \nagencies, large NGOs with substantive interest in MF, CBs that wish to corporatize clusters of \nrural branches into MFIs, provincial governments that would like to transform PCBs, local/district \ngovernments, and other public-private sources. ZTBL may also invest in MFIs. Interest in district \nlevel MFIs is positive and is considered consistent with the ongoing devolution process. \n\n \n  \n\nd. \n\nProduct and Process Innovations43  \n\n \n51. \nBecause  of  the  mixed  experience  worldwide  in  crop  insurance  introducing  any \nnationwide  scheme  runs  the  risk  of  adverse  selection  and  failures.  However,  reducing  the \nvulnerability  of  the  rural  households  is  important.  Absence  of  insurance  services  forces \nhouseholds  to  forego  opportunities,  save  in  nonfinancial  assets,  borrow  at  usurious  rates,  and \nremain  unemployed  or  underemployed.  Only  those  with  access  to  formal  sources  have  the \noption  to  save  and  borrow  in  times  of  emergencies.  Risk  management  should,  therefore,  be \nlooked into at farm and bank levels and efforts to manage risk could be made through income \ndiversification, savings, emergency funds, and insurance, and reinsurance. Some schemes can \nbe  developed  to  reduce  if  not  totally  eliminate  the  impact  of  natural  risks.  It  is  commonly \naccepted that the Government often need to share the cost of insurance schemes for small and \nsubsistence farmers. As part of the RFSDP, a Pilot Insurance Plan for up to four districts will be \nprepared in consultation with sector specialists. With preferential access to ZTBL borrowers, the \nPilot  Insurance  Plan  will  (i)  cover  drought  and  floods,  (ii)  adopt  actuarial  rates,  (iii)  link  and \nactivate claims after declaration by a competent authority, and (iv) restrict indemnity to verifiable \ninstruments.  It  may  on  an  as-needed  basis  include  subsidies  and  define  the  role  of  the \nGovernment in replication.  \n\n \n3. \n\nImportant Features  \n\n \n52. \nThe  RFSDP  design  contributes  to  the  goals  of  the  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership \nAgreement, the Government\u2019s Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan, and IPRSP (paras. 15 \nand 34). The RFSDP integrates the key elements of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, private \nsector  strategy,  MF  development  strategy,  and  rural  sector  analysis.44  The  RFSDP  will \nstrengthen ADB\u2019s role in RF, which is critically linked to a range of rural sector interventions.  \n \n53. \nSimultaneity and Linkages. Given the multidimensional nature and causes of poverty, \nthe  RFSDP  has  been  timed  to  coincide  with  (i) structural adjustment projects to create better \nconditions  for  a  market-based  financial  sector,  (ii)  agriculture  sector  policies  that  enhance \nagricultural  income  potential;  and  (iii)  infrastructure  projects  that  break  production  bottlenecks, \nreduce production risk, and bolster the return to capital. The RFSDP is well anchored with the \nreforms  in  the  banking  sector  and  is  consistent  with  the  proposed  ADB  projects  relating  to \nagribusiness export and small- and medium-scale enterprises (Appendix 6).  \n \n54. \nSustainable  Paradigm.  The  Government  has  redefined  its  role  as  complementing, \nfacilitating, and improving the functioning of RF markets. Heterogeneity of the demand (para. 4) \nis recognized and so are the expectations from RF in terms of income expansion and poverty \n                                                 \n43  Savings  and  loan  products  will  be  developed  as  part  of  the  institutional  strengthening  of  ZTBL,  MFIs,  and  CBs. \nCredit  expansion  will  be  facilitated  by  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms  relating  to  titling  and  registering \nland, secured transactions,  and  lowering  the  cost  of  foreclosures.  Addressing  these  issues  within  the  scope  of \nRFSDP though will not be possible, as the focus is on enhancing outreach from its existing narrow base through \nsustainable institutions. The proposed 2003 technical assistance for RF could explore some of these issues.  \n\n44 ADB. 2000.

New York. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nthe  RFSDP \n\nthe  evolutionary  nature  of  reforms, \n\nreduction  (paras.  18\u201321).  This  enabled  introduction  of  an  integrated  approach  where  demand \nfrom  the  middle  and  lower  segments  are  linked  with  corresponding  institutional  forms. \nConsidering \nincorporates  successful \ninternational and local practices and MSDP experience. Reform options were evaluated in terms \nof cost-effectiveness, probability of success, and sustainability.  \n \n55.  Maximizing  Long-Term \nImpact  Through  Good  Governance.  The  RFSDP \nfundamentally alters the norms for governance and institutional design. Candid assessment of \ncorruption  and  remedial  actions  indicate  the  resolve  to  deal  with  sensitive  issues.  By  shifting \nemphasis  to  systemic  issues  that  have  so  far  segmented  the  RF  market  and  affected \nsustainability,  the  RFSDP  represents  a  generational  change  from  RF  projects  that  prioritized \ncredit lines. Within the key institutions, the RFSDP emphasizes optimizing financial and human \nresources, improving repayment rates, designing demand-adapted products and services, and \nencouraging  resource  mobilization  through  savings  and  borrowings.  Savings  mobilization \nprovides greater prospects for sustained outreach compared with a finite credit line. Financing \nloans out of savings will diminish  the patronal relationship that exists between borrowers, RFIs, \nand the Government. Investing in IT and MIS will lay the basis for better portfolio quality.  \n \n56. \nEncouraging Private Sector Role. The RFSDP emphasizes enhanced private sector \ncontributions  to  poverty  reduction  by  proactively  creating  enabling  conditions,  generating \nbusiness  opportunities,  and  catalyzing  private  investments.  Synergy  with  MSDP  interventions \nhas been integrated in RFSDP design. The NBF capitalizes on the framework developed under \nMSDP to encourage the establishment of new MFIs through positive incentives for institutional \nstrengthening and outreach expansion.45 The NBF signals Government\u2019s long-term commitment \nin  MF  to  potential  local  and  international  investors.  The  public-private  partnership  provides \ntransparent incentives with focus on the poor, especially poor women.  \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n57. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $225 million from its ordinary capital resources \n(OCR) for the RFSDP, with a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, with interest \nrate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offer  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; a front-end fee of 1.0% of the loan \namount; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement.  \n \n58. \nThe use of ADB funds is in support of reforms that address complex long-standing and \nsensitive issues relating to (i) dismantling the repressive RF paradigm so as to enhance the flow \nof resources to the rural sector, (ii) enhancing governance and institutional norms for the benefit \nof the middle and lower segments of the RF markets, (iii) reducing misdirected and nontargeted \nsubsidies, and (iv) encouraging sustainable public-private partnerships to enhance employment \nand income-generating opportunities for the poor. The estimated adjustment cost of $547 million \nfor  implementing  the  RFSDP  includes:  conversion  of  Government  loan  to  ZTBL  ($274  million) \ninto ZTBL equity after settling ZTBL claims on the Government; performance-linked cash equity \nfrom  the  Government  to  ZTBL  (about  $170  million);  rightsizing  of  ZTBL  through  a  voluntary \ngolden  handshake  scheme  funded  by  the  Government  ($84  million);46  NBF  ($15  million);  and \nRF  Resource  Center  ($1  million),  Credit  Union  Plan  ($1  million),  and  Pilot  Insurance  Plan  ($2 \nmillion).  The  International  Monetary  Fund  has  factored  in  expenses  up  to  $100  million  for \n\n                                                 \n45 MSDP does not include incentives for es tablishing new MFIs.  \n46  Estimated  3,000  out  of  the  7,692  staff  are  expected  to  eventually  avail  of  the  facility.  Nearly  2,000  have  already \n\napplied.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n60. \n \n\nRFSDP  related  costs  during  FY2003  under  the  quantitative  targets  of  the  ongoing  Poverty \nReduction and Growth Facility. \n\n \n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n \n \n59.  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  will  coordinate  with \nSBP  on  policy  reforms.  A  program/project  management  unit  (PMU)  has  been  set  up  at  MOF \nwith  a  project  director  and  1  full-time  officer,  to  coordinate,  monitor,  and  supervise  program \nimplementation.  One  more  full-time  staff  will  be  recruited  from  among  qualified  professionals. \nSBP will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for the NBF and RF Resource Center, and ZTBL for \nZTBL  restructuring.  The  Rural  and  MF  Support  Division  within  SBP  will  serve  as  a  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  and  has  been  strengthened  with  1  additional  officer.  Additional  staff \nwill  be  provided  with  growing  volume  of  work.  ZTBL  has  set  up  a  PIU  with  2  full  time  officers. \nThe National Credit Consultative Council comprising a broad array of stakeholders will ensure \nwider consultation on policy matters.   \n \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\nImplementation period is 3 years, and to be completed by December 2005 (Appendix 7).  \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced \n61. \nand procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items (Appendix 8). The Government \nwill  certify  that  (i)  if  the  loan  proceeds  will  finance  goods  already  imported,  the  value  of  eligible \nimports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested withdrawal; or (ii) if the \nloan  proceeds  finance  items  to  be  imported,  the  value  of  eligible  imports  in  the  immediately \npreceding 1-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount of the requested withdrawal \nplus  all  other  amounts  expected  to  be  withdrawn  during  the  period.  Simplified  disbursement \nprocedures and related requirements will be adopted.  \n \n\nd. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n62. \nThe use of the loan proceeds will be audited if ADB so requests. ADB retains the right to \n(i) audit any account, and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued by the Government for \neach withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the Government will open an account at SBP to \nreceive all loan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance \nwith terms satisfactory to ADB. The PMU will send quarterly progress reports to ADB on the policy \nreform  measures  including  ZTBL  restructuring,  RF  Resource  Center,  Credit  Union  Plan,  Pilot \nInsurance Plan, and NBF including all entities that avail of NBF.  \n \n\ne. \n\nCounterpart Funds  \n\n \n63. \nAs  part  of  RFSDP,  it  has  been  agreed  that  the  Government  will  contribute  the  entire \ncounterpart funds for ZTBL restructuring ($206 million), NBF ($15 million), RF Resource Center \n($1  million),  Credit  Union  Plan  ($1  million),  and  Pilot  Insurance  Plan  ($2  million).  The \nGovernment  and  ADB  will  monitor  the  use  of  counterpart  funds.  Precise  and  monitorable \ndedication  of  counterpart  funds  through  explicit  expenditure  commitments  directly  supports \nRFSDP  reforms  and  contributes  to the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s poverty reduction goals. The \nallocation  of  counterpart  funds  is  in  the  context  where  resource  requirement  for  poverty \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\freduction  is  immense.  Use  of  counterpart  funds  outside  the  Government  budget  structure  will \nenable flexibility to adapt to changing sector requirements.  \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nf. \n\nTranching and Monitoring \n\n \nThe  program  loan  will  be  released  in  4  tranches  over  3  years  to  meet  the  expected \n64. \noccurrence  of  associated  costs  and  subject  to  ZTBL  performance.  The  first  tranche  of  $100 \nmillion  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness;  the  second  tranche  of  $50  million,  after  7 \nmonths  of  the  first  tranche;  the  third  tranche  of  $50  million,  within  12  months  of  the  second \ntranche;  and  the  fourth  tranche  of  $25  million,  within  17  months  of  the  third  tranche,  in  each \ncase subject to compliance with the conditions for their respective releases.  \n \n65.  Monitorable  and  time-bound  actions  are  reflected  in  the  policy  matrix  attached  to  the \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 2). Both the Government and ADB will regularly and closely \nmonitor RFSDP implementation. Special reviews and audits will conducted periodically. Specific \nperformance indicators with regard to ZTBL have been developed (Appendix 4, Table A4.5).  \n \n \n \n66. \nPMU will establish and maintain a program performance management system including \na database on the status of policy reform measures and program indicators based on the policy \nmatrix. This will be linked with the project performance management system (para. 86).  \n\nProgram Performance Management System \n\ng. \n\n \n\nh. \n\nProgram Review \n\n \n67. \nThe Government, SBP, ZTBL, and ADB will conduct a comprehensive midterm review at \nthe  end  of  year  2  to  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  reform  measures  and  their  impact  on  the \nsector.  ADB  will  also  monitor  implementation  through  periodic  reviews  and  progress  reports. \nADB  will  conduct  annual  reviews  throughout  the  implementation  period  to  identify  further \nmeasures necessary for the continued development of the RF markets. \n \nC. \n \n\nThe Project Loan  \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n \n68. \nThe project loan will strengthen key institutions to help them provide affordable financial \nservices  for  increasing  rural  incomes,  employment,  and  investments.  Institutional  diversity  and \nstrengthening will increase the access of the rural households to financial services.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs  \n\n \n69. \nZTBL  Restructuring.  The  project  loan  will  support  implementation  of  the  ZTBL \nrestructuring plan covering the following (i) governance: establish an environment that facilitates \ngood  governance  and  accountability;  (ii)  systems:  modernize  operations  through  use  of \ntechnology, networking, and communication tools; (iii) business processes: streamline products \nand  delivery  systems  so  as  to  reduce  transaction  costs,  simplify  operations,  and  increase \noutreach;  (iv)  products  and  services:  introduce  products  and  services  that  are  financially  and \neconomically  viable;  (v) human  resource  development:  improve  standards  and  skills  of \nmanagement and staff and strengthen training capacity; and (vi) IT: establish new hardware and \nsoftware  platform  to  support  MIS,  accounting  system  including  forensic  accounting,  and  risk \nmanagement functions. Hiring of a management team and functional specialists, both domestic \nand international, and study visits will also be supported. \n\n19\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n70. \nSBP Institutional Strengthening for RF Regulation. Institutional strengthening support \nfor SBP will include  (i) reviewing the prevailing supervisory and regulatory policy,  systems, and \nframework  for  RF;  (ii)  upgrading  and  formulating  guidelines,  operational  procedures,  and \nstandards  for  off-site  and  on-site inspection, supervision, and reporting; (iii) assessing human \nresource,  skills,  and  IT  requirements;  (iv) installing  basic  IT  infrastructure,  facilities  and \nequipment; and (v) providing training and skills development. The RF Resource Center will be \nassisted in terms of staffing, library, equipment, and partial support for costs of recurring training \nand study visits. The Agriculture Credit Department and Rural  and MF support Division will also \nbe strengthened.  \n \n71.  MOF Institutional Strengthening. The PMU will receive capacity building support for (i) \nimplementing  the  program  and  the  project  and  (ii)  preparing  the  Credit  Union  Plan  and  Pilot \nInsurance Plan and skills, equipment, and facilities support for implementing these plans.  \n\n \n3. \n \n\nImportant Features \n\n72.    Strengthening  ZTBL  will  produce  a  stream  of  benefits  that  include  efficiency, \nsustainability,  and  greater  outreach.  The  project  cash  flows  and  profitability  pay  off  the \ninvestments  within  the  RFSDP  duration.  Emphasis  on  IT,  both  at  ZTBL  and  MFIs,  aims  to \nprovide  quality  services  to  rural  households.  The  RF  Resource  Center  institutionalizes \nknowledge  management  and  dissemination.  As  autonomous  institutions  with  a  significant \nprivate sector stake, MFIs will provide a broad range of financial services to the poor, especially \nwomen. Access to the MSDP credit line will facilitate outreach expansion through MFIs. \n \n\n4. \n\nFinancing Plan  \n\n \n73. \nThe estimated project cost of $29.6 million equivalent (Table 1), comprises $17.2 million \n(58%) in foreign exchange and $12.4 million equivalent (42%) in local currency (Appendix 9 and \nSupplementary Appendix C). The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \n\nTable 1:  Project Cost Estimates ($ million) \n\nForeign                  \n\nExchange \n\nItem  \n\nA. Base Cost \n    1.  ZTBL Restructuring  \n    2.

The  OCR  loan  will \nhave  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years;  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in \n\n \n\n \n\n\faccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per \nannum and a front end fee of 1% of the loan amount; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the Loan Agreement.  \n \n75. \nThe  provision  of  the  local  currency  cost  is  warranted  from  the  objective  of  creating \ninstitutional  capacity  for  greater  outreach.  Country  considerations  justify  the  provision  of  local \ncurrency  cost  financing.  Concerted  efforts  have  been  made  to  maintain  domestic  investment \nlevels  to  sustain  growth,  but  the  country  faces  persistent  budget  pressures.  Moreover,  the \nprogram loan only partially meets the cost of implementing the reforms. \n\n \nTable 2: Summary of Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \n\n \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nLocal Currency \n\nPercent \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n\n16.86 \n0.38 \n17.24 \n\n \n\n8.12 \n4.26 \n12.38 \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n24.98 \n4.64 \n29.62 \n\n \n\n84 \n16 \n100 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\na. \n\nProject Management  \n\n \n\n76. \nAs the EA, MOF will oversee and coordinate implementation and will directly implement \nthe Credit Union Plan and Pilot Insurance Plan. ZTBL will be the IA for ZTBL restructuring and \nSBP  will  be  the  IA  for  strengthening  supervision  and  regulation,  NBF,  and  the  RF  Resource \nCenter. The Rural and MF Support Division of SBP will be the PIU. ZTBL has set up a PIU with \n2 full-time staff at Islamabad. Drawing on the MIS of ZTBL, the PIU will submit information and \nanalysis to the PMU and coordinate the fielding and work of consultants. The PMU will ensure \nsubmission of periodic reports and will adopt sound accounting and internal control systems. \n \n77. \nFlow of Funds. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Borrower. The proceeds \nwill be passed on in the following manner: (i) equipment and capacity building support to ZTBL \nas a grant from the Borrower; and (ii) funds for NBF, RF Resource Center, Credit Union Plan, \nand Pilot Insurance Plan as a grant from the Borrower.  \n\n78.  Management of NBF.  NBF will be governed by NBF Rules (para. 48). The Rural and \nMF  Support  Division  of  SBP  will  be  responsible  for  investing,  managing,  and  operating    NBF. \nNBF  will  be  invested  only  in  approved  government  securities,  and  the  incomes  will  be \nreinvested.  Independent  auditors  will  annually  audit  NBF  and  the  reports  will  be made public. \nSBP will install a web page for wider dissemination about NBF facility.  \n\nImplementation period is 3 years, and to be completed by December 2005 (Appendix 7).  \n\n \nb. \n\n \nc. \n \n\nPeriod of Implementation  \n\nProcurement  \n\n \n\n \n79. \n\n80. \nGoods  and  services  will  be  procured  subject  to  the  provisions  of  ADB's Guidelines for \nProcurement. Vehicles and office equipment will be procured through international competitive \nbidding  procedures  for  packages  exceeding  $500,000  equivalent,  and  through  international \n\n21\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f22\n\n \n\nshopping procedures for packages between $100,000 and $500,000 equivalent. For packages \nbelow  $100,000  equivalent  direct  purchase  may  be  used.  Most  of  the  equipment  relates  to \nsoftware and hardware, which depending upon the requirements of ZTBL will be procured either \nin one package or several packages as appropriate. \n \n\nd. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \n81. \nThe project loan will finance 438 person-months of international and 651 person-months \nof  domestic  consulting  services.  All  consultants  to  be  financed  from the proceeds of the ADB \nloan  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and \narrangements  for  engaging  domestic  consultants  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Consultants  will  be \nrecruited by SBP for strengthening supervision and regulation, NBF, and RF Resource Center; \nand  by  the  PMU  for  all  other  aspects  including  ZTBL  restructuring.  Where  firms  are  to  be \nengaged,  the  quality-based  selection  method  will  be  used  for  selecting  consultants. Simplified \nprocedures will be used wherever appropriate. \n \n\ne. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n \n82. \nOn behalf of the Borrower, SBP  will open at National Bank of Pakistan, within 1 month of \nloan effectiveness, an imprest account denominated in US dollars. The imprest account will be \noperated  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Loan  Disbursements  dated \nJanuary 2001 and ADB\u2019s Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations\u2013LIBOR Based Loan \nProducts  dated  July  2002.  ADB  will  advance  3  months  of  estimated  expenditures  (about  $2.5 \nmillion) into the imprest account. Foreign exchange payments or letters of credit, as well as local \ncurrency  expenditures  may  be  paid  out  of  the  imprest  account.  The  ADB  statement-of-\nexpenditure procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish the imprest account for individual \npayments not exceeding $50,000. \n \nSBP,  ZTBL,  and  MFIs  will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify \n83. \ngoods and services financed out of the loan proceeds and the NBF to disclose their use following \nsound  accounting  principles.  Such  accounts  and  records  will  be  audited  annually  by  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, certified copies of the audit \nreport together with the auditor\u2019s opinion will be submitted to the Government and ADB. The audit \nreports will include a separate opinion on the use of the imprest account.  \n \n\nf. \n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports  \n\n \n84. \nThe  PMU  will  submit  reports  to  ADB  concerning  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds,  project \nadministration,  and  financial  management.  The  reports  include  quarterly,  semiannual,  and \nannual  project  implementation  reports,  a  midterm  review  report,  a  project  completion  report \nincluding program and project components, within 3 months of project completion. The reports \nwill cover (i) expenditures; (ii) activities financed by NBF; (iii) highlights of audit reports, of ZTBL, \nMFI, and RF operations of CBs; (iv) training activities and their impact; and (v) performance of \nCredit Union Plan and Pilot Insurance Plan. These topics will be discussed in greater detail in the \nannual reports. ZTBL will prepare quarterly reports analyzing the overall financial and operational \naspects including the implementation of the ZTBL restructuring plan.  \n \n85. \nThe Government will  maintain  separate records and accounts for the imprest fund and \nproject expenditure in accordance with sound accounting principles and will have such accounts \nand records audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB.  The Government will ensure that \nthe submission of project reports, audited accounts, and financial statements comply with ADB's \nrevised  guidelines  introduced  in  1998.  Audited  annual  accounts  of  ZTBL  will  be  submitted  to \n\n \n\n \n\n\fADB  within  6  months  of  the  reporting  period.  SBP  will  also  provide  the  key  findings  of  its \ninspection  report  on  ZTBL  and  MFIs.  Independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  NBF \nannually  and  will  also  inspect  physical  activities.  In  addition,  3  annual  management  audits  of \nZTBL will  evaluate  management  autonomy,  business  strategy,  organizational structure, credit \npolicy and procedures, service delivery systems, MIS, and training policies and programs. \n  \n\ng. \n\nProject Performance Management System \n\n \n86. \nZTBL  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project  performance  management  system  that  will \ngenerate  monthly,  quarterly,  and  annual  reports.  The  reports  will  comprise  (i)  financial  reports \ncovering loan portfolio growth and performance, liability growth and management especially of \nsavings  deposits,  and  financial  performance  indicators  concerning  earnings  and  liability \nstructures;  (ii)  details  of  the  number  of  borrowers  by  gender,  poverty  classification,  type  of \nservices,  and  size  of  transactions;  (iii)  information  on  the  performance  of  staff  measured  by \nfinancial  volume,  number  of  customers,  and  earnings ratios; (iv) information showing planned \nand  actual  levels  of  activities;  and  (v)  annual  financial  statements.  A  format  for  assessing \npoverty  reduction  impact  of  services  will  be  developed.  Audited  financial  and  operational \ninformation will be made available on the ZTBL website. For MFIs, a system equivalent to that \nfor KB will be mandatory (Appendix 5, Table A5.1).  \n \n \n \n87. \nADB  and  the  Government  will  periodically  review  project  implementation.  The  reviews \nwill  include  evaluation  of  the  project  scope;  implementation  arrangements;  consultation  with \nZTBL,  MFIs,  CBs;  implementation  of  ZTBL  restructuring  plan;  progress  with  the  policy  reform \nagenda; and capacity building measures. ADB will also field regular review missions, including \nmidterm; and project completion review missions. A comprehensive midterm review at the end \nof  year  2  will  be  undertaken  to  evaluate  actual  physical  and  financial  progress.  Based  on  this \nreview, modifications and improvements will be considered.  \n \n\nProject Reviews  \n\nh. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nBenefits and Impacts  \n\nPolicy \n\n1. \n \nIncreasing  agricultural  productivity  and  diversification  and  increasing  rural  nonfarm \n88. \nemployment for higher economic growth have a cause-and-effect relationship with increased RF \nintermediation. Financial institutions can respond to growth opportunities created by the ongoing \nstructural  reforms  only  when  they  operate  in  a  favorable  policy  environment  and  are \nappropriately  governed,  organized,  and  equipped.  RFSDP-supported  reforms  provide  this \ncritical linkage and support the ongoing financial sector reforms.  \n \n\nAltering  the  policy  environment  that  shapes  the  norms  and  incentives  in  which \nfinancial  institutions  operate  will  enable  sustainable  RF  markets  to  grow  and \ndevelop.  Robust  RF  markets  are  correlated  with  rural  growth,  thus  opening  the \npossibility of arresting the flow of resources from the rural sector. \n\nEmphasizing  good  governance  and  sustainability  and  strengthening  supervision \nwill  permit  the  integration  of  the  hitherto  segmented  RF  markets  with  the \nmainstream financial sector. This will reduce pressure on budgetary sources and \nimprove fiscal space for investment in human development.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n23\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24\n\n \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nUndertaking  institutional  restructuring,  rationalization,  and  closures  premised  on \ncost-effectiveness  and  probability  of  success  will  give  correct  incentives  for \naddressing weaknesses that impede sustainable financial intermediation.  \n\nDeveloping demand-adapted products and services will permit effective response \nto the heterogeneous  demand  profile,  growing  significance  of  the  rural  nonfarm \nsector, and immense savings potential.  \n\nImplementing  strategic  initiatives  and  incentives  for  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation  in  RF  markets  specifically  aimed  at  the  lowest  market  segment \nextends  the  successful  MSDP  interventions  through  more  MFIs  with  good \ngovernance and sustainability as core values.  \n\n \n89. \nZTBL reforms have a reasonably good chance of success by adhering to rigorous credit \nappraisal  and  risk  management.  Gains  from  restructuring  will  be  captured  in  improved \ngovernance,  substantial  cost  savings  through  rightsizing,  and  greater  outreach.  ZTBL \nrestructuring  will  establish  a  positive  market  setting  to  allow  savings  mobilization  and  demand \nled rural lending. In the process, CBs will overcome their apprehension of increasing their rural \nportfolio. A better climate for private sector investment in RF in response to NBF will be created. \nWhile  it  is  difficult  to  predict  the  number  of  new  MFIs  that  will  emerge,  it  is  likely  that  four \ninvestors will eventually meet SBP licensing criteria during the RFSDP duration. The increased \noutreach of new MFIs at provincial and district levels will further increase RF intermediation.  \n \nThe  RFSDP  strengthens  ADB\u2019s  lead  role  in  RF.  Continuous sector analysis by the RF \n90. \nResource Center will facilitate policy dialogue. RFSDP-initiated reforms can also establish cost- \neffective  means  to  link  the  vast  network  of  cooperative  societies  with  sustainable  sources  of \nfinance  (Credit  Union  Plan)  and  introduce  a  viable  crop  and  calamity  insurance  system  (Pilot \nInsurance Plan). The success of these pilots can facilitate the medium-term goals (2002-2006) \nof the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement. International dissemination about NBF facility \nwill enhance ADB\u2019s profile in promoting MFIs. \n \n\nInstitutional  \n\n2.  \n \n91. \nFinancial  projections  (Appendix  4  and  Supplementary  Appendix  A)  indicate  operating \nself-sufficiency due to improved repayment rate, reduction in staffing expenses, and additional \ncash equity. ZTBL\u2019s initial equity of PRs8.7 billion increases to PRs10 billion at the end of year 2 \n(ending  June  2004).  For  breakeven  in  year  1  (ending  June  2003),  the  provision  for  probable \nloan loss will need to be considered as allowable deductions from the operating income and the \ninterest rate on loans will also have to be higher. Maintaining the prevailing rate of interest rate \non loans, by the end of year 2 (ending June 2004), ZTBL is expected to disburse PRs37 billion, \nmeet tax and interests liabilities, generate profit, and increase capital adequacy to above 10% of \nrisk  weighted  assets.  During  year  4  (July  2005  -  June  2006),  the  expected  return  on  equity  is \n9%  and  capital  adequacy  ratio  is  16%.    At  this  level,  the  Government  can  begin  divesting  its \nequity in ZTBL to the private sector.  Projections also indicate viability of MFIs (Appendix 5 and \nSupplementary Appendix B) aided by NBF incentives. Breakeven period for the provincial and \ndistrict level MFIs is 5 years, at interest rates of 18% and 20%, respectively.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f25\n\n \n\n \n3.  \n\nEconomic and Financial  \n\n \n92. \nThe  estimated  ZTBL  outreach  of  600,000  clients  p.a.  at  the  2005-end is premised on \nsmall  farmer  focus  and  resource  generated  through  improved  repayment  rate  and  savings \nmobilization. The increased outreach (about 180,000) creates the equivalent of 80,000 full-time \njobs.  The  economic  internal  rates  of  return  for  sample  farm  and  nonfarm  activities  range  from \n21%  to  54%,  with  a  weighted  average  of  37%.  The  range  in  financial  internal  rate  of  return is \n17%  to  75%,  with  a  weighted  average  of  45%  declining  to  33%  after  allowing  for  enterprise \nfailure.  The  profiles  show  moderately  attractive  investments  available  to  the  rural  poor.  The \nMFIs are expected to reach 20,000 poor households during the RFSDP duration, and potentially \nmuch more thereafter. Annually, the lending will result in the equivalent of 12,500 full-time jobs. \nThe  weighted  average  economic  internal  rate  of  return  and  financial  internal  rate  of  return for \ntypical income-generating activities financed by MFIs are, respectively, 34% and 27% (Appendix \n10 and Supplementary Appendix D). \n  \n\n4. \n\nEnvironmental  \n\n \n93. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  of  farm  and  nonfarm  activities  was  made  and  the \nresults were grouped into two broad classes representing larger loans from ZTBL and smaller \nMFI  loans  to  determine  their  impact  on  the  environment.  None  of  the  representative  farm  or \nnonfarm  activities  require  a  category  A  assessment.  There  are  no  negative  environmental \nimpacts  that  cannot  be  mitigated.  However,  emphasis  at  ZTBL  to  effectively  deal  with \nenvironmental  issues  is  modest.  As  part  of  the  ZTBL  institutional  strengthening,  staff  skills  in \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  will  be  enhanced.  The  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination is in Appendix 11.  \n\n \n5. \n\nSocial and Poverty  \n\n \n94. \nThe  RFSDP  supports  poverty  reduction  and  pro-poor  growth  with  agriculture  and  rural \nemphasis enumerated in the Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement. At the macro level, the \npoverty reduction goal is supported through greater access to affordable financial services and \ntheir  effective  use  to  increase  rural  household  income.  NBF  represents  a  direct  pro-poor \nintervention aimed at the lowest segment of the RF market.  Appropriately designed and priced \nservices  that  consider  the  asset  and  consumption  buildup  of  households  will  enhance \nhousehold income above the poverty threshold after 4-5 credit cycles.  Increased rural financial \nintermediation  will  help  farmers  to  increase  their  productivity  and  support  private  enterprises, \nboth farm-related and nonfarm, that will generate employment for the rural poor.  \n \n95. \nIncreased availability of RF services will stimulate linkages within the rural economy and \nbetween  the  rural  and  urban  economy.  The  new  RF  paradigm  and NBF incentives create an \nenvironment  conducive  to  private  sector  participation  and  investment  in  RF.  Intertemporal \nassessment of the institutional reforms suggests that, while the full benefits from a strengthened \nRF  system  are  likely  to  occur  in  the  medium  term,  ZTBL  and  MFIs  will  target  the  middle  and \nlower  segments  of  the  RF  markets  from  the  outset.  The  RFSDP  will  not  have  any  adverse \nimpact  on  indigenous  peoples  and,  thus  will  not  trigger  actions  dictated  by  ADB\u2019s  policy on \nindigenous peoples  and the  policy  on  involuntary  settlement. The summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 12 with further details in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26\n\n \n\n \nB.  \n \n\nRisks   \n\n1.  \n\nProgram Loan \n\n \nThe  success  of  the  RFSDP  depends  on  a  number  of  assumptions that are subject to \n96. \nvariable  degrees  of  risk.  Mitigating  measures  have  been  put  in  place  as  appropriate  and \npossible. \n \nConsistency and Commitment to Reform. RF development requires consistency with \n97. \nthe  financial  sector  reforms.  The  Government  has  shown  unwavering  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, autonomy, and privatization of CBs and has adhered to similar expectations under \nMSDP. The reform agenda under the RFSDP was arrived at after sustained policy dialogue and \nis  phased  to  show  outreach  results  for  facilitating  sociopolitical  acceptance  for  minimizing  the \nrisk  of  any  rollback  of  the  reforms.  Nevertheless,  the  sociopolitical  situation  will  be  closely \nmonitored against RFSDP objectives and continuous policy dialogue maintained.  \n \nPrivate Sector Perception. Private sector investment in RF depends on the perception \n98. \nof  private  investors.  The  measures  under  the  RFSDP  to  improve  investor  confidence  are  up-\nfront  reforms,  transparent  positive  incentives  that  reflect  government  commitment, and strong \nSBP  supervision  for  ensuring  good  governance.  While  the  Government  has  managed  to \nstabilize  the  economy  and  the  outlook  is  positive,  vulnerability  to  exogenous  risks  such  as \nworsening global outlook, regional conflict, and terrorist attacks remains.  \n \nShort  Implementation  Period.  This  risk  is  reduced  through  the  following  measures: \n99. \n(i) the ADB loan will be released in 4 tranches to provide greater dialogue between ADB and the \nGovernment, allow more time for the Government to implement the reforms, and enable various \nstakeholders  with  different  interests  to  maintain  ownership  of  the  policies;  (ii)    consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  implementation  capacity;  and  (iii)  the  National  Credit \nConsultative Council will oversee broader stakeholder coordination (para. 59).  \n\n \n2. \n\nProject Loan  \n\n \n100.  ZTBL  has  been  a  politicized  financial  institution  with  staff  values  that  could  affect  the \nrestructuring.  Autonomy  could  be  eroded  and  expected  improvements  in  repayments  may  not \nmaterialize.  Factors  that  mitigate  the  risks  include  (i)  up-front  agreement  on  the  governance \nframework,  autonomy,  and  a  professional  board  and  management  team;  (ii)  financial \nrestructuring  for  capitalization  and  funds  for  making  provisions  for  the  portfolio  affected  by \npolitical waivers and remissions; (iii) redefining the mission and vision with sustainability as the \nkey objective; (iv) reducing overheads including redundant staff with inappropriate skill set; and \n(v)  significant  investments  in  IT  and  MIS.  The  risk  of  weak  managerial  capability  has  been \nreduced  by  making  the  selection  of  a  qualified  management  team  a  tranche  condition  and \nproviding funds to attract the best talent. The private sector board of directors and independent \ncommittees  to  the  board  will  facilitate  good  governance  and  institutionalize  commercial \norientation. \n \n101.  Support is contingent upon performance. Support for restructuring rather than onlending \nwill  alter  ZTBL  behavior  and  orient  it  to  attract  deposits  and  enhance  eligibility  for  raising \nresources from money markets. Tightening of credit standards, more attention to credit risk, and \nrigorous credit appraisal will improve the portfolio quality. These actions will drive up cost in the \nshort term and could even require  higher  provisioning  and  draw  down  the  equity.  However,  in \nthe medium to long run they will strengthen viability.  Risks associated with loan remissions and \n\n \n\n \n\n\fwaivers are mitigated by the Government\u2019s commitment that it will not pardon outstanding loan \nrepayment or discourage debt recovery.  \n \n102. \nImprovement in loan collection is also premised on (i) stricter powers available to banks \nunder the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance 2001, (ii) establishment of an \nasset management company,  the  Corporate  and  Industrial  Restructuring  Corporation,  and  (iii) \nGovernment  efforts  for  improving  the  banking  courts.  Redesigned  business  processes  and \nupgraded  MIS  are  expected  to  significantly  enhance  appraisal,  credit  risk  management,  and \ndelinquency  monitoring.  It  is  likely  that  natural  calamities  during  the  RFSDP  duration  may \nadversely  affect  the  portfolio  quality,  for  which  no  immediate  protection  is  available.  The  Pilot \nInsurance Plan is expected to provide practical solutions.  \n \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n103. \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n \n \n\nProgram Loan  \n\n1. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n  \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n2. \n \n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  (a)  maintain  the  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  prior  to \nthe  date  of  the  Loan  Agreement  for  the  program  loan,  as  described  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter and the policy matrix, for the duration of the RFSDP and \nsubsequently; (b) promptly adopt the other policies and the other actions included \nin the RFSDP as specified in the development policy letter and the policy matrix; \nand (c) ensure that such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of \nthe RFSDP and subsequently.  \n\nNotwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  the  RFSDP  Program  Loan  Agreement \nand Project Loan Agreement if there is a significant shortfall in the achievement \nof agreed performance indicators by ZTBL, ADB will carry out a special financial \nand  operational  review  of  ZTBL  and  reach  agreement  with  ZTBL  and  the \nGovernment regarding implementation of the recommendations of the review and \nuntil such agreement has been reached, no disbursements will be made. \n\nThe  Government  will  assist  the  private  sector  participants  in  identifying  and \npromoting  small  MFIs,  ensure  resources  are  provided  to  SBP  and  MFIs  in  a \ntimely  manner,  and  review  the  Microfinance  Institutions  Ordinance  2001  in  light \nof the NBF experience in promoting MFIs. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Credit  Union  Plan  and  the  Pilot  Insurance \nPlan will be implemented to the satisfaction of ADB. \n\nZTBL  will  promptly  inform  ADB  of  any  change  in  its  board  of  directors  or  its \nsenior  management  team,  and  ensure  that  any  such  change  will  be  made  in \naccordance with good corporate governance. \n\nProject Loan  \n\nIn case of natural calamities and unforeseen circumstances that affect the equity \nand liquidity of ZTBL, MFIs that avail of NBF, and CBs under the RFSDP, ADB \nwill  be  consulted  immediately  and  a  remedial  action  plan  acceptable  to  ADB \nprepared within one month thereafter. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n27\n\n \n\n\f28\n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nExternal  auditors  will  be  engaged  to  audit  project  accounts,  including  imprest \naccount,  ZTBL,  MFIs,  and  NBF.  The  annual  audited  accounts  and  financial \nstatements,  together  with  audit  reports,  in  English,  will  be  submitted  within \n6 months  following  the  end  of  the  relevant Government fiscal year. In addition, 3 \nspecial management audits of ZTBL will be carried out.  \n\nZTBL will ensure that the lending operation will be carried out in accordance with \nall  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the  Government  and  with \nADB\u2019s environmental policies and procedures.  \n\nThe provision of para (ii) above (program loan) also applies to the project loan. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n104. \nand recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \n\nthe loan of $225,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Rural Finance \nSector Development Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with interest \nto be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term \nof  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan and Program Agreements presented to the Board; and  \n\nthe loan of $25,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Rural Finance \nSector Development Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of \n24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  4  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n\nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n26 November 2002 \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n29\n\nSECTOR AND SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\n \nRural  financial  (RF)1  markets  in  Pakistan  are  characterized  by  low  and  decreasing \n1. \navailability  of  financing  for  both  farm  and  nonfarm  activities.  The  shallow  RF  markets  lack \nvariety,  breadth,  and  range  in  the  services  they  provide.    RF  markets  have  not  expanded  to \nprovide  savings  services,  credit  products  tailored  to  purpose,  crop  insurance,  or  remittance \nservices.  Access  to  formal  financial  services  is  extremely  limited.  The  high  incidence  of  self-\nperpetuating  poverty  in  rural  areas,  growing  income  inequalities  between  urban  and  rural \nmarkets, and concerns for food security and population vulnerability in rural communities are the \nemerging consequences of the failure to establish RF markets consistent with the needs of the \nrural communities.   \n \nRural Economy.  The  estimated  97  million  rural  population  of  Pakistan  is  spread  over \n2. \n14.3 million households. Nearly 80% of the households earn less than a $1 per person per day.  \nThe  head  count  estimate  of  rural  poverty  is  36.3%  and  that  of  urban  poverty  is  22.4% \n(1998-1999). The estimates show that poverty increased in depth and severity during the 1990s. \nOverall inequality also increased.2 The country experienced successive and severe droughts in \nthe  last  3  years.  It  is,  therefore,  highly  likely  that  the  incidence  of  poverty,  particularly  rural \npoverty,  today  is  significantly  higher  than  estimated.  The  inelastic  supply  of  agricultural  land, \nhigher population growth, and gradual mechanization of agriculture have transferred rural labor \nfrom  agricultural  to  nonfarm  activities  in  rural  and  urban  sectors.  Nearly  two  thirds  of  the \nworkforce is engaged in rural jobs, of which 64% are in agriculture, 12% in services, and 24% in \nrural enterprises,3 construction, and trade. The total agricultural income accounted for only 48% \nof the rural income in the country, the rest came from nonfarm activities including remittances.   \n \n3. \nRF  Market  Structure.  The  demand  profile  stratifies  the  market  in  4  broad  categories: \n(i) upper: agriculture commodity processors, food processors, large agriculture-based industries, \nagriculture produce wholesalers, and farmers with large landholdings; (ii) middle: the non-poor \nnonfarm  households  and  better-off  farmers  supplying  agriculture  inputs,  operating  rural \nenterprises, and providing agribusiness services; (iii) lower middle: medium farmers, agriculture \nproduce  retailers,  and  smaller  rural  enterprises;  and  (iv) lowest:  landless  poor,  tenant, \nsubsistence, and small farmers. The segments are interdependent and have inherent overlaps. \nOn  the  supply  continuum,  the  upper  segments  have  more  access  to  formal  financial  sources \nand the lower segments rely on informal sources.  \n \n4. \nDemand.  Nearly  60%  of  the  rural  households  have  borrowed  either  from  formal  or \ninformal sources, and about one third have outstanding debt. Given the limited access to credit, \nthe rural households have been restricted to borrowing levels that are substantially below their \nneeds.  Estimates4  show  that  the  poor  and  non-poor  households  in  the  rural  areas  have,  on \naverage,  borrowed  loans  to  the  level  of  PRs22,000  and  PRs42,000,  respectively,  from  all \nsources.  Relaxing  the  constraints  imposed  by  high  effective  rate5  of  borrowing  and  limited \n\n                                                 \n1 \u2018RF\u2019 also indicates rural finance in this Appendix.  \n2  Annual Review 2001. Social Development in Pakistan,  \n3  Rural enterprises include both agriculture-related and nonfarm enterpris es. Agriculture-related enterprises include \nsmall-scale processing of agriculture produce and byproducts into semifinished and finished goods, and production \nand supply of agricultural inputs. Nonfarm enterprises include transport, warehousing, handicraft, and weaving.   \n4  Government  of  Pakistan.  1985.  Rural  Credit  Survey;  Government  of  Pakistan.  1990.

Report  of  the  Committee  on  Rural  Finance;  and  SBP.  Annual  Estimates  for  Agriculture \nCredit (from formal sources). \n\n5  Most borrowings are from informal sources at interest charges between 40-50% per annum.  \n\n\f30\n\n           Appendix 1 \n \n\naccess, the estimated demand for credit could be PRs240 billion-PRs260 billion annually. With \nthe  expansion  of  the  RF  market,  the  effective  rate  of  borrowing  will  decline  due  to  lower \ntransaction  costs,  which  may  raise  the  demand  for  credit  even  further.6 Within the RF market, \nsome households do not borrow because of strong risk aversion, while others cannot borrow as \nmuch  as  they  need.  Those  in  the  lowest  group  perceive  that  they  are  highly  unlikely  to  have \naccess to reasonably priced credit.  \n \n5. \nWhereas  the  transitory  gaps  in  income  generating  activities  of  the  rural  households, \nparticularly the farm households, raise the demand for credit largely for consumption purposes, \nthe rural households also tend to generate net savings. The poor and non-poor households, on \naverage, are estimated to annually generate net financial savings of PRs4,000 and PRs27,000, \nrespectively.  This  amounts  to  around  PRs268  billion  annually.  Since  banks  in  rural  areas \nprimarily  focus  on  disbursements,  the  forms  and  pattern  of  rural  household  savings  are still \ntraditional  and  inefficient.  Commercial  banks\u2019  (CBs)  rural  deposits  are  only  a  fraction  of  the \npotential. CBs generally do not accept small savings.  \n\n \n\nSupply.  The  formal  RF  sector  in  Pakistan  consists  of  Zarai  Taraqiati  Bank  Limited \n6. \n(ZTBL)7 with 343 branches; CBs (3,183 branches); five provincial cooperative banks (PCBs, 205 \nbranches);  the  newly  established  Khushhalibank  (KB)  with  30  branches;  and  the  First \nMicrofinance Bank (3 branches). There are about 10 nongovernment organizations with interest \nin  microfinance  (MF),  a  subset  of  RF.  During  the  year  ended  June  2001,  the  formal  sources \njointly disbursed a total of 786,000 loans amounting to PRs56 billion i.e., an average loan size of \nPRs71,246.  The  nongovernment  organizations  have  disbursed  about  100,000  loans.  The \nnominal  interest  rates  charged  ranged  between  13%  and  22%.  The  outreach  is  merely  6%  of \nthe  total  rural  households  and  the  amount  disbursed  is  21%  of  the  estimated  demand.  On \naverage, ZTBL disbursed about 1,215 loans per branch annually and the comparable figure for \nCBs  was  80  loans.  CBs  are  reluctant  to  expand  their  rural  outreach  and  have,  on  occasions, \npreferred  to  pay  penalties  to  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP)\u2014the  central  bank\u2014for  non-\ncompliance with the mandatory credit  quota. The limited outreach by formal sources has not \nhelped to reduce the dependence on informal sources where the cost of borrowing is very high. \nThis leaves very little for asset buildup and consumption. The large market share of the informal \nsources at 70% of total loans borrowed in rural areas indicates their dominance. \n \n7. \nFunding  Sources  for  RF.  Previous  projects  funded  by  the  World  Bank  and  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  essentially  focused  on  credit  expansion,  with  ZTBL  as  the  key \ndelivery  channel.  Despite  impressive  onfarm  achievements,  the  project  outcomes  were  rated \nunsatisfactory because institutional development was negligible and sustainability was unlikely. \nSerious  financial  and  liquidity  problems,  increased  dependence  on  subsidies,  unsatisfactory \naccounting practices, and frequent government interventions were considered as major reasons \nfor  project  failure.  The  main  lessons  learned  were  that  deposit  mobilization,  loan  recovery, \nautonomy, and stable professional management were critical for a viable ZTBL. With the rapid \nincrease in rural poverty during the 1990s and ineffectiveness of formal sources of credit in the \nrural  hinterland,  ADB  assisted  in  establishing  KB  with  the  aim  of  enhancing  accessibility  of \nsustainable MF services to the landless, subsistence farmers, and the poor. KB has been able \nto  maintain  portfolio  quality,  rapidly  increase  outreach,  and  establish  a  network  in  30  districts. \n\n                                                 \n6  Every  additional  1%  agricultural  growth  is  associated  with  investment  requirement  of  2%  of  agricultural  gross \n\ndomestic product. \n\n7   Former Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan.  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n31\n\nThe  policy,  legal,  and  supervisory  framework  for  the  establishment  of  MF  institutions  (MFIs)8 \nfacilitated the establishment of the First Microfinance Bank.  \n \n8. \nMajor Issues in RF. A financial paradigm of directed rural credit to promote agriculture \ntechnology, stimulate agricultural production, and help the poor has persisted in Pakistan for 4 \ndecades. RF policies, institutions, and programs adopted a supply-led approach for expanding \nagriculture  credit.  It  meant  promoting  institutions  within  government  control,  expanding  their \nbranch network, and directing them to extend credit under various targeted programs. While the \ntargeted beneficiaries, i.e., small farmers and the rural poor could not receive the major part of \nthe  benefits,  dependence  on  subsidized  credit  was  perpetuated.  Inadequate  emphasis  was \ngiven to savings and insurance. The  government, both as a source of repressive policies and \nprovider of poor-quality RF services, dominated the RF markets. Its direct involvement resulted \nin  allocation  of  credit  without  due  care,  as  it  has  often  been  determined  by  administrative \ndictates  rather  than  bankability.  Consequently,  institutions  suffered  recurring  financial  losses. \nDue to political interference nonperforming loans remain high in the banking sector. Inefficiently \nrun  government-owned  financial  institutions,9  including  ZTBL  and  PCBs,  were  subject  to \nconsiderable  political  interference  and  are  characterized  by  poor  portfolio  quality,  substantial \noverstaffing, and weak human capital.  \n \n9. \nA  cumbersome  system  of  land  titling  raises  transaction  costs  and  inefficiencies,  which \nconstrains  the  collection  of  bad  loans.  The  information  asymmetries  between  borrowers  and \nlenders  contribute  to  the  problem  of  poor  loan  recovery  and  selecting  creditworthy  borrowers. \nCollateral  orientation  has  helped  in  increasing  investment  and  output.  However,  insecure \ntenants,  sharecroppers,  and  agricultural  laborers  have  received  very  little  benefits  from \nexpanded credit disbursements. They have to rely on informal sources where prices are higher \nand  loan  durations  short.  The  costs  of  physical  distance  and  procedural  complexities  for \nborrowers in effect suppress the true demand for formal financial services. \n \nConflicts in ownership and regulation prevail. Supervision and regulation by SBP failed \n10. \nto prevent systemic weaknesses in the banking sector. The supervision of PCBs by provincial \ncooperative departments has been dismal. Except Punjab PCB, the others are nearly dormant. \nThe perceptions of risk and low profitability have limited CBs exposure in rural areas despite a \nwide  branch  network.  The  resulting  overdependence  on  ZTBL  constrains  the  options  for \npotential  clients.  Limited  outreach  of  formal  sources  is  also  concentrated  in  periurban  areas, \nwhile hilly and mountainous areas are sparsely covered. \n \nLessons  Learned.  The  development  of  the  RF  markets  in  Pakistan  has  been \n11. \nconsiderably distorted resulting in fragmented markets that vary in development and density by \nregion.10  However,  during  the  last  2  years  there  has  been  a  visible  shift  in  financial  sector \npolicies.  Focus  on  macroeconomic  stability  and  prudential  supervision  of  financial  institutions \nhas  replaced  repressive  interest  rate  controls.  Financial  markets  are  deepening  with  product \ninnovation,  institutional  restructuring,  and  expansion.  However,  financial  liberalization  has  not \nyet  eased  the  flow  of  resources  in  the  rural  areas  where  returns  are  relatively  low  because  of \nlow  agriculture  productivity  and  inadequate  infrastructure.  CBs  remain  concentrated  in  urban \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2000.

While the intention to expand rural operations is emerging, the skills, technology, and \norientation are lacking.  \n \n12. \nLessons  in  RF,  essentially  derived  from  agriculture  credit  projects,  suggest  that  price- \ndriven credit programs ignored institutional sustainability. Price restrictions inhibited the ability of \nRF  markets  to  develop  internal  sources  of  capital  supply.  This,  coupled  with  high  transaction \ncosts,  limited  the  depth  and  scale  of  outreach.  Institutional  expansion  based  on  a  refinancing \nfacility  on  soft  terms  proved  to  be  short-lived  and  nonviable,  as  it  impaired  the  ability  to  raise \nresources from money markets. Highly inefficient supply-driven applications of capital and weak \nnon-market-driven  management  are  generally  regarded  as  the  basic  reasons  for  the  failure  of \nZTBL  and  PCBs.  Specific  causes  of  failure  revolve  around  high  operating  costs,  losses,  and \ndecapitalization. Poorly designed credit guarantee and insurance programs led to moral hazard \nresulting in repayment disincentives and losses.  \n \nThe  experience  of  MF 11  on  one  hand  provided  a  tool  for  covering  the  excluded  or \n13. \nignored segments of society, and on the other hand, provided alternative approaches to cater to \nthe financial needs of the lower segments of the RF markets i.e., microenterprises, the landless, \nand subsistence farmers. High turnover and short loan periods have given microenterprises the \ncapability to pay higher interest rates for gaining access to financial markets.12 MF has shown \nits  relevance  to  credit  delivery  and  lending  innovations  to  cover  risk  analysis  and  credit \nscreening through peer pressure.  \n \n14. \nThe lessons learned also suggest that removing repressive agriculture sector taxes and \nexchange  regime  policies  enables  farmers  to  increase  agricultural  production  and  incomes \nthrough  improvements  in  production  technology.  Increased  farm  profitability  increases  credit \nabsorption capacity. A more focused approach for expanding nonfarm income activities in rural \nareas will significantly enhance the prospects for more efficient financial markets. \n \nStrengthening RF Markets. Structural reforms in Pakistan are eliminating price controls \n15. \nand  subsidies,  liberalizing  interest  rates,  and  reducing  repression  of  the  financial  markets.13 \nThey  set  the  basis  for  fundamental  RF  reforms  that  require  dealing  simultaneously  with  the \npolicy  environment,  financial  infrastructure,  institutional  reforms,  and  innovations  in  products \nand services. In the context of ongoing financial sector reforms, the old RF paradigm has come \nunder severe criticism in Pakistan as loan collection problems reached alarming levels, outreach \nremains limited, and transaction costs for both borrowers and lenders are high.14 \n \nConsidering the multitude of deep-seated problems, changes can be expected only over \n16. \nthe  medium  term  and,  therefore,  priorities  need  to  be  decided  for  phasing  and  sequencing \ninterventions.  The  first  step  is  a  well-defined  role  of  the  Government  that  is  conducive  to  the \nestablishment  of  a  favorable  policy  environment.  The  core  elements  of  the  strategy  are  two-\n                                                 \n11 Based on experience gained in the implementation of ADB. 2000.

Pakistan Rural Finance Sub-Sector Review, (TA  3229-PAK: Agricultural Sector Program, Annex No.4) \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n33\n\npronged.  The  first  set  of  components  constitutes  (i)  improving  the  policy  environment  by \nextending  the  relevant  financial  sector  policies  to  RF,  (ii)  improving  the  supervisory  and \nregulatory  environment,  (iii)  improving  financial  governance  and  institutional  capacities,  and \n(iv) promoting institutional diversity. The second set relates to: (i) improving outreach and client \noptions, and (ii) implementing institutional restructuring.  \n \n17. \nEmpirical  evidence  shows  that  when  the  financial  sector  is  liberalized and repressive \npolicies  lifted,  CBs  close  rural  branches,  minimize  small  transactions,  and  thereby  restrict \naccess  of  small  clients,  with  negative  overall  consequences.15  Considering  the  client  profile, \nnature  of  business,  and  the  status  of  rural  infrastructure,  it  does  not  appear  likely  that  RF  will \nattract  large  private  commercial  interest  immediately  or  without  incentives.  Therefore,  RF \ninstitutions  with  probability  of  turnaround  need  to  be  strengthened  through  good  governance \nand efficiency. This will promote institutional diversity to provide quality and quantity of services \nand enhance institutional options for the clients.  \n \n18. \nThe  reforms  initiated  to  restructure  ZTBL  show  a  strong  Government  commitment. \nSustained application of the practices adopted by successful RF institutions will be required for \nrestructuring. These practices relate to (i) good governance, (ii) autonomy to develop and price \nproducts; (iii) effective methods to reduce transaction costs; (iv) product mix with due emphasis \non savings and loans for nonfarm activities; (v) transparent and competent financial, accounting, \nand  management  systems;  and  (vi)  innovative  staff  development  and  incentive  systems.  As \nnoted  in  the  case  of  CBs  in  Pakistan,  ZTBL  can  make  a  turnaround  with improved regulation \nand supervision, good governance, and institutional strengthening support.  \n \n19.  While  the  general  direction  of  reform  should  be  to  enhance  economic  growth  through \nincome  expansion,  poverty  reduction  emphasis  will  require  specific  support  for  institutions  to \naddress  the  lowest  segment  of  the  market.  The  returns  on  rural  investment  projects  for \nsubsistence  are  lower  than  those  in  the  urban  trading  or  manufacturing  sector.  However,  the \nsocial  rate  of  return  on  such  investments,  positive  nonpecuniary  externalities  of  poverty \nreduction, and female employment is high. Given the low level of development, borrowers in this \nsector cannot offer any form of financial collateral. This worsens the risk perception of lenders \nand  further  lowers  the  expected  financial  rate  of  return.  Ways  and  means  must  therefore  be \nidentified to enhance access. ADB\u2019s ongoing Microfinance Sector Development Program has a \ncomprehensive  framework  that  can  be  leveraged  to  address  the  demand  emanating  from  the \nlowest segment of the RF market with support for institutional strengthening and outreach.16 In \nview of the high incidence of rural poverty, the Government accords high priority to this.  \n \n20. \nThe  strategic  components  (paras.  16-19)  are  expected  to  significantly  improve  the \nenvironment for RF services, encourage new entrants, and strengthen the existing ones. Both \nthe  Government  and  funding  agencies  recognize  the  problems  in  the  RF  sector.  Supporting \nexpansion  of  MF  through  a  range  of  institutions  and  initiatives  and  restructuring  ZTBL  are \nconsistent with the target to create 11.3 million jobs during 2000-2011 by promoting growth in \nlabor-intensive  sectors  of  agriculture  and  small  and  medium-scale  enterprises.17 To succeed, \nthe  Government,  the  private  sector,  and  funding  agencies  must  coordinate  and  balance  their \npriorities. \n\n                                                 \n15 Steel, F.

On  behalf  of \nthe Government, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)  \u2014 the central bank\u2014 holds 99% of ADBP \nequity  and  the  provincial  governments  hold  the  balance.  ADBP  Ordinance  1961  categorizes \nADBP  as  a  specialized  banking  company.  ADBP  is  allowed  to  perform  all  banking  and  allied \nbusiness,  such  as  accepting  deposits,  pledges,  and  mortgages;  and  investing  in  securities  of \ncorporate bodies and the Government. However, ADBP\u2019s main function is to provide credit for \nagriculture  to  improve  farm  household  income.  In  carrying  out  agricultural  lending,  ADBP  is \nrequired to focus on small farmers with landholdings of less than 5 hectares.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe chairperson cum chief executive officer of ADBP heads a seven-member board of \ndirectors (BOD). ADBP Ordinance 1961 provides for the appointment of federal and provincial \nofficials and members of national and provincial assemblies to the BOD and its subcommittees. \nA management team of two senior executive directors and eight executive directors assists the \nchairperson  in  day-to-day  operations.  Government  influence  on  ADBP  operations  has  been \ndirect  and  pervasive.  Distinction  between  ownership  and  management  diminished,  as \nsuccessive governments required  ADBP to implement directives, such as loan waivers, below- \ncost  lending,  and  loans  for  nonviable  projects.  Means  available  to  the  management  for \nassessing liquidity, interest rate, and credit risks are weak.  \n \nC. \n \n3. \nFrom  its  head  office  in  Islamabad,  ADBP  operates  49  regional  offices  that  are \nadministrative units for branch control, and 343 branches. The overall staff of 7,692 comprises \n59%  officers  and  41%  support  staff.  Around  1,134  (15%)  staff  work  at  the  head  office,  1,277 \n(16%) in regional offices, and 5,281 (69%) at branches. Career progression is not based on any \nobjective  performance  criteria.  The  system  of  performance  evaluation  encourages  personal \nbiases,  as  job  descriptions  are  not  available.  While  ADBP  has  two  training  colleges,  no \nsystematic  training  needs  assessment  has  been  done.  Staff  motivation  and  skills  are  low. \nProductivity, at loans per staff, is the lowest in the region for similar banks. \n  \nD. \n \n4. \nADBP  provides  short-term,  medium-term,  and  long-term  loans.  The  short-term loans, \ncalled production loans range from 6 to 18 months, repayable at the end of the term, and are \nprovided mainly for fertilizer, seed, pesticides and working capital. The medium-term loans are \ndevelopment  loans  with  maturities  up  to  5  years  and  are  for  livestock,  fisheries,  dairy,  poultry, \ntractors, tubewells and other farm implements. Long-term loans with maturities of 5-15 years are \nmainly  for  plantation  crops.  Bes ides  agricultural  credit,  ADBP  also  undertook  project  lending \nwith  World  Bank  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  and  financed  537  projects,  of \n\nOrganization, Staffing, and Personnel Administration \n\nLending Policies and Procedures  \n\n                                                 \n1 In this Appendix, ADBP has been referred to till the incorporation of ZTBL.  \n\n\f        Appendix 4 \n\n50\n\nwhich  229  (43%)  are  in  default.  These  are  large  agribusiness  loans  for  which  ADBP  has  little \nappraisal, monitoring, and technical skills. Project lending is suspended for the last 3 years.  \n \n5. \nSanctioning  powers  have  been  delegated  for  loan  applications  to  be  processed  at \nbranches. Various collateral arrangements are admissible. In case of agricultural loans, land is \ntaken as security through passbooks, issued by revenue authorities that reflect ownership and \nvalue  of  land  in  terms  of  produce  index  units.  Project  lending  was  based  on  mortgage  of  land \nand  machinery.  There  are  a  number  of  lending  schemes including supervised credit scheme, \none-window operation, credit to women, and microfinance loans. Supervised credit is processed \nby  mobile  credit  officers  (MCOs).  Loan  applications  are  processed,  credit  disbursed  with \ntechnical advice, and monitoring carried out by a team of 1,460 male and 23 female MCOs. In \nthe  one-window  operation,  the  concerned  provincial  revenue  officers  along  with  ADBP  staff \nissue  passbooks  and  approve  credit  disbursements.  MCOs  can  approve  short-term loans of \nPRs60,000  under  the  one-window  program.  Microcredit  and  credit  to  women  are  negligible. \nMost of the MCOs were hired in the early 1970s as agricultural graduates. They have no formal \ntraining in credit appraisal and management.  \n \n6. \nThere  is  no  mechanism  for  offering  differential  interest  rates  to  clients  based  on  their \ncredit  rating  or  type  and  term  of  products.  All  clients  are  charged  a  14%  markup,  with  an \nadditional up-front processing fee of 1%. Reliance on collateral precludes cash flow analysis or \nassessment of the ability of borrowers to adjust to price and income risks. The business process \nand operations manuals have not been updated for more than a decade. Although the charter \nprovides for leasing, no effort has been made to develop a leasing business.  \n \nE. \n \n7. \nTotal assets increased marginally by 4.19% over the last 5 years (1977-2001) and stood \nat  PRs78.1  billion  at  the  end  of  financial  year  (FY)  2001.2 Savings from the public at PRs1.4 \nbillion  is  only  about  2%  of  the  liabilities  due  to  inadequate  emphasis  on  savings  mobilization. \nGovernment  and  the  SBP  refinance  almost  the  entire  loan  portfolio.  The  interest  payable  on \nrefinance  is  capitalized  or  shared  on  a  profit-and-loss  basis,  as  ADBP  is  not  in  a  position  to \nservice debts.

During  FY2001,  ADBP \n8. \ndisbursed PRs27.6 billion to 417,000 clients. This is nearly half the agriculture credit disbursed \nby the formal sector. Punjab accounts for 71% of the disbursements, followed by Sindh (20.5%). \nAzad Jammu and Kashmir and other provinces3 account for the balance. The average loan size \nat disbursement is PRs 66,187. Disbursements increased at a rate of 27% over the last 5 years. \nSince the last 3 years, ADBP has restricted disbursements to 90% of the loan collections. The \nratio  of  short-  term  and  long-  term  loans  is  68:32  for  FY2001.  Of  the  disbursements  during \nFY2001, 37% was for purchase of fertilizer, 19% for tractors, 14% for seeds, 13% for pesticides, \nand 6% for tubewells and 4% for working capital requirements. The balance 7% was disbursed \nfor poultry, dairy, fisheries, livestock, farm equipment, orchards, and farm transportation.  \n \nF. \n \n9. \nADBP\u2019s income recognition and provisioning for bad debts are in compliance with SBP \nprudential regulations.4 No income is accrued if the account is delinquent for more than 90 days. \nFor  loans  more  than  90  days  overdue,  the  income  accrual  is  suspended  and  the  loans  are \ncategorized as \u2018other assets especially mentioned\u2019. Accounts delinquent for more than 180 days \nare classified as substandard, 270 days as doubtful, and above 1 year as loss or nonperforming \nloan (NPL). SBP  requires that provisions be made for 25% of substandard accounts, 50% for \ndoubtful, and 100% for loss category. Out of the gross loan portfolio of PRs93.9 billion, PRs53 \nbillion (56%) is performing and PRs41 billion (44%) is NPL. The provisioned loan losses amount \nto  PRs30  billion,  73%  of  the  NPLs  or  32%  of  the  gross  loan  portfolio.  The  entire  project  loan \nportfolio  (para.  4)  of  PRs12  billion  is  considered  as  NPL.  Provisioning  grew  by  an  average \nannual rate of 25% during FY1997-FY2001, while gross advances grew at an average annual \nrate of 10.28%.  \n \n10. \nADBP portfolio quality has been affected by (i) weak loan appraisal, (ii) absence of credit \nrisk  management,  (iii)  inadequate  internal  audit  controls,  and  (iv)  political  interference  in  loan \ncollections. ADBP\u2019s own efforts for collection of overdue loans have been modest. Repayment \nrate  (percentage  of  collection  to  demand)  for  loans  disbursed  during  FY2001  is  70%  and  the \naggregate repayment rate 55%. Recurring droughts and floods have accentuated the problem. \nRelief  packages  announced  by  the  Government  that  allowed  remissions  and  write-offs also \naffected repayment.  \n \nG. \n \nProfits  have  fluctuated  significantly.  ADBP  incurred  a  loss  of  PRs3.8  billion  in  FY1998 \n11. \ndue  to  provisioning  of  PRs9.6  billion.  In  FY1999  owing  to  a  net  increase  in  gross  loans  of \nPRs12.8 billion, ADBP posted a profit of PRs1.7 billion. Since then net profit has decreased and \nin  FY2001  ADBP  incurred  a  loss  of  PRs127  million.  As  a  result,  the  return  on  equity  has \ndropped  from  5%  in  FY2000  to  2%  in  FY2001.  Capital  adequacy  ratio  as  percent  of  risk \nweighted assets for FY2001 at 7% is below the SBP-prescribed limit of 8% (Table A4.2). ADBP \nwill have to charge approximately 21% on its loans to become subsidy independent.5.  \n \n \n \n\nFinancial Statements and Ratios \n\n                                                 \n3  Baluchistan, Northwest Frontier Province, and Federally Administered Northern Areas.  \n4  Same as those applied to commercial banks.  \n5   The formula is from Yaron, J. 1992.

The  income,  borrowing  costs,  interest  on  deposits,  and  other  expenses \nare accounted on an accrual basis. The accrued interest for a loan that is delinquent for more \nthan 90 days is reversed from the income and transferred to a suspense account. Independent \nexternal auditors audit the annual accounts. However, completion of audit is always delayed, as \nrecord  keeping  is  weak  and  inaccurate.  The  management  information  system  (MIS)  and \ninformation technology (IT) platform are primitive and cannot cater to the information needs for \nrisk management and business analysis. In the absence of networked information systems, the \ninformation gathering methodology from branches to the regional offices and further to the head \noffice  causes  delays  and  inaccuracies.  This  diminishes  the  real  time  and  relational  database \ncapabilities and restricts analytical reporting that is essential to support good governance. \n \nI. \n\n Incorporation of  Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited (ZTBL)  \n\n \n\n13.  Within  the  context  of  ongoing  financial  sector  reforms,  initial  measures  for  ADBP \nrestructuring  were  initiated  by  the  ADB-funded  Microfinance  Sector  Development  Program \n(MSDP).6  Reform  of  ADBP  was  considered  necessary,  as  (i)  its  weaknesses  deterred \ninvestments  in  rural  finance  (RF),  and  (ii)  there  is  a  need  to  meet  the  demand  for  affordable \nfinancial services in a grossly underserved market. Accordingly, the MSDP included  a portfolio \naudit  to  assess  the  key  reasons  for  the  poor  portfolio  quality  of  ADBP  and,  subsequently,  to \nprepare a restructuring plan for addressing institutional inadequacies.  \n \nThe  portfolio  audit7  indicates  that  the  basic  reason  for  poor  asset quality was the dual \n14. \nroles  of  ADBP  as  a  development  agency  and  a  financial  institution.  The  roles  affected  the \nnorms, values, and expectations both within and outside ADBP. Successive attempts to achieve \nbroader development goals8 instead of efficient financial intermediation ultimately led the clients \nto  believe  that  ADBP  was  not  comparable  with  a  commercial  bank.  As  such,  ADBP  was \nexpected  to  be  tolerant  when  the  credit  cycle,  in  terms  of  timely  repayments,  remained \nincomplete.  The  audit  also  found  deficiencies  in  (i)  loan  appraisal,  sanctioning,  and \ndisbursements;  (ii)  loan  classification  and  provisioning;9  (iii)  supervision  and  monitoring; \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2000.

In  addition,  problems  in  realization  of  securities,  natural  calamities,  deficiency  in \nterms  of  segregation  of  responsibilities  in  loan  approval  and  management;  and  lack  of \npreventive controls contributed to low repayments and huge accumulation of infected portfolio. \nThe  portfolio  audit  therefore  recommended  the  following  provisioning  requirements  over  and \nabove made in pursuance of SBP regulations.  \n \n\nLoan Portfolio (PRs12 billion) \n\n \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n \n(vi) \n\nPRs1.0 billion for loans where the first installment is due after 3 years.  \n\nPRs1.0  billion  for  short-term  loans  (not  exceeding  18  months)  where  there  has \nbeen  no  repayment  in  the  last  2  years.  These  loans  are  yet  to  be  classified  as \nloss category on the basis of time requirements under the prudential regulations.  \n\nPRs2.8  billion  for  development  loans  (medium-to  long-term  loans)  where  there \nhas been no repayment in the last 3 years.  \n\nPRs4.0  billion  for  adjustment  lending  where  successively  smaller  loans  are \nissued  to  the  same  borrower  on  the  payment  of  the  current  loan.  While  prima-\nfacie it appears that this will not hurt ADBP as both the principal and markup are \nrecovered, if this cycle is discontinued the possibility of repayment will be remote.  \n\nPRs1.5 billion due to information inadequacies. \n\nPRs1.7 billion for disbursements made during 2001 based on recovery trend.  \n\n \n\n \n\nOther Assets (PRs6.8 billion) \n\n(i) \n\nPRs6.8 billion for government claims receivable on account of past loan waivers, \nbranch adjustments, and presumptive tax recoverable. \n\n \nThe  Government  agreed  to  restructure  ADBP  after  evaluating  a  number  of  options \n15. \n(paras. 24-27 and 41-43 of the main text). The decision was influenced by the need to address \nthe grossly underserved rural sector, the realization that RF will not attract private commercial \ninterest immediately, and the experience gained in reforming the commercial banks. ADBP was \nincorporated  on  23  October  2002  as  ZTBL,  with  an  authorized  equity  of  PRs25  billion  and  a \nmandate  to  become  a  sustainable  RF  institution  (para.  43  of  the  main  text).  The  Articles  of \nAssociation provide for a 10-member board with private sector majority. Members of parliament, \nprovincial  assembly,  and  persons  holding  membership  of  political  parties  are  ineligible  to \nbecome a director of ZTBL.  \n \n16. \nZTBL  has  adopted  a  restructuring  plan  at  its  second  board  meeting  on  12  November \n2002. The restructuring plan to be implemented over 3 years emphasizes (i) good governance; \n(ii) effective methods to reduce transaction costs; (iii) product mix with due emphasis on savings \nservices  and \nfinancial,  accounting,  and \nmanagement  systems;  and  (v) innovative  staff  development  and  incentive  systems.  The key \naspects  of  the  restructuring  plan  were  presented  to  the  Economic  Coordination  Committee  of \nthe Cabinet on 4 November 2002.  \n \n\nfor  nonfarm  activities;  (iv) transparent \n\nloans \n\n\f        Appendix 4 \n\n54\n\nProjected Performance of ZTBL  \n\nOn 18 November 2002 the Government issued an order specifying 14 December 2002 \n16. \nto  be  the  effective  date  on  which  all  the  assets,  contracts,  liabilities,  proceedings,  and \nundertakings of the former ADBP will be transferred to ZTBL. Financial restructuring is meant to \nprovide  for  uncovered  bad  and  doubtful  debts  estimated  at  PRs12  billion  ($200  million)  and \nother assets of about PRs6.8 billion to ensure that the capital adequacy ratio of ZTBL remains \nabove 10% of risk-weighted assets. The restated balance sheet and shareholding of ZTBL after \nadjustments are in Tables A4.3 and A4.4. The  Government loan of PRs16.4 billion to ZTBL has \nbeen converted into ZTBL equity after adjusting ZTBL claims on the Government. SBP equity in \nZTBL (PRs3.2 billion) has been converted into subordinated debt of ZTBL. Further, cash equity \nof  up  to  PRs10  billion  will  be  released  in  3  tranches  provided  ZTBL  meets  the  agreed \nperformance indicators (Table A4.5).  \n \nJ. \n \nFinancial  projections 10  (Supplementary  Appendix  A)  indicate  operating  self-sufficiency \n17. \ndue  to  improved  repayment  rate,  reduction  in  staffing  expenses,  and  additional  cash  equity. \nZTBL\u2019s  initial  equity  of  PRs8.7  billion  increases  to  PRs10  billion  at  the  end  of  year  2  (ending \nJune  2004).  For  breakeven  in  year  1  (ending  June  2003),  the  provision  for  probable  loan  loss \nwill need to be considered as allowable deductions from the operating income and the interest \nrate on loans will also have to be higher. Maintaining the prevailing rate of interest rate on loans, \nby the end of year 2 (ending June 2004), ZTBL is expected to disburse PRs37 billion, meet tax \nand  interests  liabilities,  generate  profit,  and  increase  capital  adequacy  to  above  10%  of  risk \nweighted  assets. During year 4 (July 2005  -  June  2006),  the  expected  return  on  equity  is  9% \nand capital adequacy ratio is 16%.  At this level, the Government can begin divesting its equity \nin ZTBL to the private sector.  \n \n18. \nImprovement  in  loan  collection  is  premised  on  (i)  stricter  powers  available  to  banks \nunder the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance 2001, (ii) establishment of an \nasset  management  company,  the  Corporate  and  Industrial  Restructuring  Corporation,11  (iii) \nGovernment efforts for improving the banking courts, and (iv) discontinuation of loan waivers at \nthe  expense  of  financial  institutions.  Redesigned  business  processes  and  upgraded  MIS  are \nexpected  to  significantly  enhance  appraisal,  credit  risk  management,  and  delinquency \nmonitoring.

Khushhalibank,  the  first  microfinance  institution  (MFI)  to  be  set  up,  has \nshown its capability in savings mobilization, credit delivery, and lending innovations to cover risk \nanalysis and credit screening through peer pressure.  \n \n2. \nMF  Institutions  Ordinance  2001  mandates  the  establishment  of  MFIs  under  the \nsupervision of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the central bank. A New Bank Fund (NBF) is \nbeing established as part of the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program  for  encouraging \nthe  establishment  of  sustainable  MFIs  at  provincial  and  district  levels  under  the  MSDP \nframework. NBF incentives relate to institutional strengthening at soft terms. The general outline \nof the MFIs expected to be established in response to the NBF is as follows.  \n \nObjective  and  Strategy.  The  MFIs  will  provide  affordable  but  sustainable  services \n3. \nincluding  savings,  credit,  and  leasing  to  poor  households.  Social  intermediation2 will precede \nand  accompany  MF  services  to  ensure  that  social  and  gender  dimensions  of  poverty  are \nadequately addressed. Of the MFI clients, 25% are expected to be women. \n \n4. \nOwnership and Corporate Governance. The authorized share capital will be PRs250 \nmillion for provincial MFIs and PRs100 million for district MFIs. If convinced of the merits of the \napplication,  SBP  will  issue  a  license  allowing  the  MFI  to  accept  deposits  from  the  public  and \nextend  a  wide  range  of  services  to  poor  households.3  Incorporation  and  governance will be in \naccordance with the provisions of Companies Ordinance,1984. SBP will ensure that members \nof the board and the chief executive officer of MFIs are qualified persons of integrity. \n \nOrganization.  The  promoters  of  eligible  MFIs  will  have  the  flexibility  to  adopt  an \n5. \ninstitutional  design  that  responds  to  geographic  and  demographic  contexts.  However,  to  be \neligible  for  NBF  resources  they  will  need  to  have  their  business  plans  approved  by  SBP  to \nensure that core values of sustainability and good governance are mainstreamed. Broadly, the \ndecentralized structure and systems of Khushhalibank will be the reference point. \n \n6. \nOperating  Procedures.  Operating  procedures  designed  for  efficiency  and  cost \nreduction  will  determine  the  methodology  for  delivery.  The  MFIs  could  opt  for  either  a  group-\nbased or individual client delivery methodology, a combination of the two, or start with a group-\nbased  methodology  and  migrate  to  individual  clients.  Social  intermediation  support  for \ndeveloping  client  skills  will  be  available  from  the  Microfinance  Sector  Development  Fund  and \nCommunity Investment Fund set up under the MSDP for those MFIs that agree to abide by the \nrules, including contributions. MFIs will also have access to the refinance facility under MSDP. \n \n7. \nProducts  and  Services.  MFIs  will  develop  savings  products  that  will  be  attractive  to \nrural communities. Depositors will be paid competitive interest rates and deposits mobilized will \nbe  partly  protected  by  the  depositor  protection  fund  required  by  MFI  Ordinance  2001. \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to \n\nPakistan for the Microfinance Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n2  Improving  the  conditions  for  the  excluded  to  access  finance,  for  example,  through  grassroots  training in group \n\nformation, and vocational and financial skills. \n\n3  MFI Ordinance 2001 Part I define the poor (Section 1) and lists the range of services (Section 6). \n \n\n\f \n\n58\n\nAppendix 5    \n\nAdditionally, MFIs can also join the Deposit Protection Fund set up under MSDP. In particular, \nsmall-size  short-term  loans  for  income-generating  activities  will  be  promoted,  but  MFIs  could \nalso  give  consumption  smoothening  loans.  From  the  Khushhalibank  experience,  the  first  loan \nsize could be about PRs9,000\u201412,000 ($150-200). MFIs could join the Risk Mitigation Fund set \nup under MSDP to provide partial risk cover to their customers.  \n \n8. \nProjected Performance.  Provincial  and  district  MFIs  breakeven  at  year  5  by  factoring \nthe  incentives  of  NBF.  While  a  provincial  MFI  could  breakeven  by  charging  18%  per  annum \n(p.a.) and a service fee of PRs400, a district MFI will need to charge 20% p.a.4 In both cases, at \nbreakeven, two thirds of the loan outstanding is financed from equity and deposits and one third \nfrom borrowings. Detailed projections are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nRisks and Safeguards. MFIs are vulnerable to increases in loan losses and reductions \n9. \nin loan revenues. The risk of delinquency is being mitigated through social collateral, continuous \nmonitoring, adoption of successful practices, loan loss provisions, and autonomy in operations. \nAs  a  positive  incentive  for  better  performance  access  to  NBF  and  funds  under  MSDP  will  be \ncontingent upon attainment of agreed upon performance indicators (Table A5.1).  \n\n \nTable A5.1: Performance Indicators for Microfinance Institutions  \n\nIndicator a \n\nValue \n\nDefinition \n\nOutreach \nNumber of clients   \nLoans disbursed \nEfficiency Ratio \nOperating expense ratio \nSalary-expense-to-portfolio ratio  \nPortfolio Quality \nRepayment rate  \nLoan loss provisions and write-off  \n\nProfitability  \nReturn on equity \n\nReturn on assets  \n\nSolvency/Liquidity \nCapital adequacy ratio \nCash reserves  \n\nReserves \nReserve Fund \n\nDepositor Protection Fund  \n\n \nBusiness plan  \nBusiness plan  \n \nBusiness plan  \nBusiness plan  \n \n90%  \nAs prescribed by SBP  \n\n \nBusiness plan  \n\nBusiness plan  \n\n \nAs prescribed by SBP  \nAs prescribed by SBP  \n\n \n20% of net profit \n\n10% of net profit  \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nDepositors and borrowers  \nAmount during the period  \n \nexpenses/ average total assets \nStaff expenses/ average total assets  \n \nOn-time collection as % of demand  \nTo be independently assessed  \n\n \nNet profit to equity \n\nNet profit to assets  \n\nGender  \nTargets \n \n>25% \n>25% \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\u00aa For purposes of eligibility, indicators will be applied on year-end data, as the determination of some of them requires \naudited  financial  statements.  The  indicators  will  become  part  of  the  monitoring  mechanism  to  be  reported \nperiodically. In the event that MFI fails to meet most of the performance indicators, a provisional eligibility could be \ngiven upon submission of an institutional development plan. SBP will be required to review the plan semiannually.  \n\n                                                 \n4  The projections are conservative. The assumptions include (i) cost of refinance at 7% p.a., and deposit at 7% p.a.; \n(ii)  lending  interest  rate  of  18%  and  20%,  respectively,  for  provincial  and  district  MFIs;  (iii)  loan  loss  provision  of \n11% of net outstanding loans, and write-off after 2 years; (iv) statutory liquidity and cash reserve of 5% of deposit \nat no interest and 15% of deposit at 7% p.a.; (v) income tax at 50% of net profit; (vi) provision for inflation at 6% \np.a.; and (vii) part of the fixed assets financed by NBF. Deposits are projected to increase by an amount equal to \n10% of the annual loan disbursement.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n\nRural Development \n\nAgriculture  \n\nMicrofinance \n\nFinancial Sector \n\nAsian Development Bank  \nInfrastructure, community development, \nsocial capital, and some rural finance.  \n\u2022  Bahawalpur Rural Development \n\nProject ($38 million) \n\u2022  Dera Ghazi Khan Rural \n\nDevelopment Project ($36 million)  \n\n\u2022  Malakand Rural Development \n\nProject ($41 million)  \n\n\u2022  NWFP Barani Area Development \nProject Phase II ($52 million)  \n\u2022  Sindh Rural Development Project \n\n\u2022  Provincial Highways Project ($150 \n\n($50 million)  \n\nmillion)  \n\n($205 million)  \n\n\u2022  Road Sector Development Program \n\n\u2022  Punjab Road Sector Development \n\nProgram ($150 million) \n\nOthers  \nEuropean Community, International \nFund for Agricultural Development, \nIslamic Development Bank, Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation (JBIC), \nSwiss Agency for Development \nCooperation, and World Food \nProgramme \n\nAsian Development Bank  \nEfficient markets for major \ncommodities including \nwheat, cotton, rice, sugar, \nfertilizer, and seeds.

The  financial  returns  and \ncosts  are  estimated  in  constant  year  2001-2002  terms,  while  the  prices  of  farm  and  nonfarm \noutputs as well as inputs are based on published prices adjusted to the farmgate levels.1 World \nBank Commodity Price Projections were used to estimate the economic prices of traded outputs \nand inputs. Prices for wheat, rice paddy, and seed cotton are based on the export parity, while \nthose  for  sugarcane,  milk,  urea,  and  diammonium  phosphate  are  based  on  import  parity.  To \nreflect  underemployment  and  seasonal  unemployment  in  the  labor  market,  a  shadow  wage \nfactor of 0.75 was used, while other nontraded inputs were adjusted by a standard conversion \nfactor of 0.90 to account for the general distortions in the economy. \n \n\n2. \n\nFarm and Enterprise Models2 \n\n3. \nDetailed crop models were prepared for the major and most minor crops in the cropping \npattern. The only exception is in case of orchards. Due to their longer gestation periods and with \nthe focus on marginal, subsistence, and small farmers, it is not likely that new orchards will be \nestablished through a medium-term loan. Along with the provincial cropping patterns, these crop \nmodels were the basis for farm models for average marginal, subsistence, and small farms. \n \n4. \n  Detailed  livestock  activity  models  were  prepared  for  common  types  of  livestock.  Milk, \ncull animals and young stock were assumed as the main products. It was further assumed that \nthe  entire  produce  is  disposed  off  and  any  on-farm  consumption  is  bought  with  cash.  The \nmodels  assume  that  the  milking  animals  will  have  a  5-year  milking  life  and  that  the \nreplacements will be purchased and not reared on the farm. Typical herding patterns were used \nto develop various types of livestock farm models.  \n \n5. \nEnterprise models for likely rural income generation activities are for a period of 5 years \nand  are  the  basis  for  determining  the  financial  and  economic  performance  of  the  respective \nactivities.  \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancing Assumptions \n\nBased  on  the  recent  literature3  and  surveys  on  other  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \n6. \nprojects, it was assumed that all the cash costs are paid for by borrowing from informal sources \nat 5% per month or at 30% for the cropping season. While the lending through Zarai Taraqiati \n\n                                                 \n1   Pakistan Year Book 2001, Federal Bureau of Statistics, 2001. \n2   Detailed crop, livestock, farm and enterprise models are presented in the Supplementary Appendix D. \n3   Khandker, S R et al,  Impact of Farm Credit in Pakistan. The World Bank.; and ADB. 2001. Small-Scale Technical \n\nAssistance to Pakistan for Additional Preparatory Work on the Sindh Rural Development Project. Manila  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n65\n\nBank  Limited  (ZTBL)  and  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  will  be  at  the  prevailing  commercial \nrates, an annual interest rate of 20% was assumed for the purposes of this analysis. The loan \nterm for the seasonal lending for crop production was assumed to be 6 months and that for the \nnew enterprises was assumed to be 1 year. \n \nC. \n\nAnalysis of Financial, Economic, and Employment Impacts \n\n7. \nDetailed  assessments  of  the  financial  and  economic  performance  as  well  as \nemployment creation from typical investment options in the rural economies were made and are \npresented in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n\n1. \n\nSeasonal Lending for Crop Production \n\n8. \n Depending on the farm size and the cropping patterns,  the loan disbursements through \nZTBL  will  be  in  the  range  of  PRs7,500  ($125)  to  PRs51,000  ($850).  When  the  lower  cost  of \ncapital is the only benefit, resulting increase in the household income is in the range of 34% to \n46%. However, it is more realistic to  anticipate that, as a result of lower capital costs, farmers \nwill no longer be constrained to reduce the levels of inputs such as fertilizers and as a result will \nuse  some  of  the  savings  to  improve  crop  productivities.  An  increase  of  10%  in  yields  is \nanticipated to improve the financial farm incomes by 70% to 114%, while the improvement in the \neconomic farm income is estimated to average at about 15%. Annual incremental employment \ngeneration is estimated to be equivalent to 5,000 full time jobs. \n \n\n2. \n\nLending for New Enterprises \n\n9. \nMiddle  segment  of  the  rural  finance  market  will  be  served  by  the  ZTBL  and  loan \ndisbursements are anticipated to range from PRs20,000 ($333) to PRs75,000 ($1,250). Farm-\nrelated enterprises typical of the rural sector are anticipated to generate financial internal rates \nof return (FIRRs) ranging from 38% to 69%, while the corresponding economic internal rates of \nreturn (EIRR) are expected to range from 25% to 53%. Sensitivity analysis taking into account a \n20%  enterprise  failure  rate  shows  that  the  weighted  average  FIRR  declines  from  71%  to  53% \nand weighted average EIRR from 32% to 19%. For the nonfarm enterprises, the FIRRs for the \ntypical  activities  are  expected  to  range  from  17%  to  75%  while  the  EIRRs  from  23%  to 54%. \nSensitivity analysis shows that failure of 20% of the enterprises reduces the weighted average \nFIRRs from 42% to 29% and weighted average EIRRs from 42% to 33%. \n \nOverall  for  the  ZTBL  lending  for  new  enterprises,  the  FIRRs  are  anticipated  to  range \n10. \nfrom  17%  to  75%  and  have  a  weighted  average  of  45%,  which  declines  to  33%  with  a  20% \nenterprise failure. Corresponding EIRRs range from 21% to 54% and have a weighted average \nof 37%. Incremental employment generation from the annual lending for the new enterprises is \nexpected to be equivalent to 75,000 full time jobs.  \n \n11.

Yes.  \n \nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  medium -term \ndevelopment goals are to promote economic growth and \nstability  of  income  and  employment  in  rural  Pakistan, \nincrease  nonfarm  employment  opportunities,  expand \nrural \nfinancial \ninfrastructure, \nintermediation, and enhance access to credit in the rural \nareas.                                              \n\nSector identified as a national priority in Country Poverty \nAnalysis? Yes.  \n \nTo reduce absolute poverty from 32% in 2001 to 15% in \n2011, one of the Government\u2019s strategies is to accelerate \ngrowth  in  four  critical  sectors:  agriculture,  small  and \nmedium -scale  enterprises,  information  technology,  and \nenergy.  The  Government\u2019s  plan  is  to  promote  rural \neconomic  growth \nto \nsustainable rural finance and microfinance. \nContribution of the sector to poverty reduction in Pakistan \n \nIn Pakistan, 75% of the poor live in rural areas; a large proportion of them are pushed into poverty because of the \nvolatility of income. The rural sector accounts for two thirds of employment. Majority of the employed rural population \ndepend  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihood  either  directly  or  indirectly.  Formal  institutions  meet  less  than  one  fifth  of \nrural credit demand. The development of a sustainable rural finance market and credible financial institutions will help \npromote  rural  economic  growth  and  subsequently  reduce  rural  poverty,  through  (i) increased  food  security, \n(ii) increased  diversification  and  development  of  nonfarm  activities,  (iv)  lower  production  costs  leading  to  improved \ncompetitiveness  of  farm  production,  (iv)  stronger  export  of  agricultural  products,  and  (v)  income  and  employment \ngeneration in the rural sector.  \n \nB. \n\nImproved Governance/ Economic Development \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\neconomic \n\npromote \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRural Poverty. Poverty is widespread in the country, but it has historically been higher in the rural than in the urban \nareas. Pakistan has no official poverty lines. As a result, several studies undertaken to enumerate poverty have used \ndifferent figures.  Federal  Bureau  of  Statistics  (using  the  expenditures  necessary  for  intake  of  2,550  calories  as  the \npoverty line) reported incidence of poverty at 32% overall and at 36% in the rural areas in 1998-99. It is likely that the \nincidence  of  poverty  has  risen  since  then,  due  to  the  decline  in  growth  of  nonfarm  activities  and  public  sector \ndevelopment  spending.  Inequality  also  increased  in  Pakistan  during  the  1990s.  Pakistan  does  not  have  gender-\ndisaggregated  poverty-related  data.  However,  it  is  increasingly  evident  from  various  studies  that  women  bear  a \ndisproportionately  high  share  of  the  burden  of  poverty  within  the  family  and  the  society.  Women\u2019s  access  to  and \ncontrol over productive resources are extremely limited. Women\u2019s mobility is restricted and gender segregation and \nfemale  seclusion  are  common.  Poverty  in  Pakistan  is  characterized  by  both  economic  vulnerability (households do \nnot have diversified sources of income to smooth out consumption expenditure in response to exogenous shocks) \nand  social  vulnerability  (denial  of  basic  rights,  social  exclusion,  corruption,  manipulation  of  regulatory  controls,  and \ninsecurity). Other characteristics of the poor in Pakistan are their low education, larger than average household size, \nfew physical assets, and a disproportionate reliance on informal sector employment opportunities.  \n\n \n\nRural  Poverty  and  the  Agriculture  Sector.  One  of  the  root  causes  of  poverty  in  the  rural  areas  is  heavy \ndependence on the agriculture sector, which has been marred by low growth in the last decade. Due to a dearth of \nopportunities  other  than  in  agriculture,  the  impact  of  low  growth  in  agriculture on the rural economy was severe: \nincomes declined and unemployment and underemployment increased. The reasons for low growth in agriculture are \nmultidimensional  and  include  distorted  commodity  markets,  weak  research  and  extension  services,  and  lack  of \naccess  to  formal  credit.  Agricultural  Sector  Program  II1  aims  to  rid  the  economy  of  distortions  in  the  commodity \nmarkets and to make both research and extension more responsive to farmers\u2019 needs and more effective in service \ndelivery. However, little has been done so far to improve farmers\u2019 access to credit. A 1995 survey2 found that only \n60% of the farmers had been able to take loans to finance their operations. Of those who were able to borrow, only \n6% borrowed from banks and other formal sources. The very little formal borrowing is limited to larger and better-off \nfarmers  and  access  of  marginal  and  subsistence  farmers  is  minimal.  In  the  past,  Government-programmed credit \ntended to target inefficient and politically connected producers. These loans discouraged agricultural modernization \nand diversification. In addition, a grant mentality discouraged the development of financial services and institutions. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loans to Pakistan for the \n\nAgriculture Sector Program II.

Report of the Committee on Rural Finance, Karachi. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n69\n\nSurveys show that the informal sources of credit not only charge annual interest rates of 40-50%, but also stipulate \nthat the produce is sold to the lender who manipulates prices to where farmers end up getting paid 5-10% less than \nthe  market  price.  In  addition  to  low  prices,  very  high  capital  costs  affect  the  farmers\u2019  production  decisions:  fertilizer \napplication rates are lowered and pest control is considered a luxury in case of most crops, which leads to lower than \nthe  potential  yields.  In  addition,  when  buying  agricultural  inputs  on  credit,  the  farmers  have  no  choice  but  to  buy \nsubstandard and adulterated  fertilizers  and  pesticides  from  suppliers  that  would  extend  credit  to  them.  This  further \nreduces crop productivity.  \n\nRural Poverty and Land Ownership. The prevalence of an unequal land distribution system is another major cause \nof rural poverty. In general, areas where sharecropping arrangements are structured to favor the landowner tend to \nhave higher levels of rural poverty. Pervasive inequality in land ownership intensifies the degree of vulnerability of the \npoorest sections of the rural society. Ownership of even small landholdings can significantly increase not only the \nowner\u2019s capacity to absorb economic shocks but also access to credit from the formal banking sector. \n\nParticipation Process \n\nRural Poverty and the Nonfarm Subsector. Slow growth in agriculture combined with lack of access to credit has \nled to virtually no growth in nonfarm rural income sources. Employment opportunities in the nonfarm subsector have \nat  best  remained  unchanged  and  have  led  to  higher  levels  of  rural  unemployment  and  underemployment.  Most \naffected  are  the  landless  that  due  to  lack  of  access  to  credit  depend  entirely  on  farm  and  nonfarm  sources  for \nemployment.  Due  to  lack  of  collateral,  the  risk  of  lending  to  the  landless  is  perceived  to  be  greater;  thus  the  credit \nthrough the informal sources is even more expensive, which ensures that the most disadvantaged rural population \nhas  no  opportunity  to  escape  poverty.  Over  half  of  the  rural  population  depend  on  nonfarm  sources  for  their \nlivelihood. While Agriculture Sector Program II addresses the issues relating to agriculture sector, similar measures \nfor  the  rest  of  the  rural  economy  have  been  few,  which  has  led  to  the  situation  where  the  rural  economy  is  highly \ndependent  on  agriculture.  High  dependence  on  the  agricultural  sector  has  meant  that  in  the  event  of  natural \ncalamities  and  exogenous  shocks,  such  as  drought  or  widespread  pest  attacks  (as  in  case  of  leaf  curl  virus  on \ncotton), there was nothing for the rural economy to fall back on. Inadequate supply of credit from formal sources has \nmeant  that  the  rural  economy  lacked  access  to  credit  required  to  diversify  into  sources  of  income  other  than  in \nagriculture. In areas where income sources are not diversified, coping strategies for vulnerable households are very \nlimited and credit could be an important means of sustaining consumption.  \n \nC. \n \nStakeholder analysis prepared?                Yes \n \nStakeholder Groups.  Four stakeholder groups were analyzed: general public, government, private sector, and civil \nsociety. The Rural Finance Sector Development Program will involve participation of stakeholders at different levels \nand from different sectors. Being the primary focus, marginal and subsistence farmers, women, and the rural poor will \nbe  active  participants.  Small,  medium -scale  and  large  farmers,  who  are  the  current  focus  of  Zarai  Taraqiati  Bank \nLimited (ZTBL) lending, will continue to have access to credit from the commercial banks as well as from ZTBL and \nhence remain active participants. In addition, rural labor will benefit from increased employment opportunities in the \nrural economy and will hence play an important role as well. At the Government level, Ministry of Finance, State Bank \nof Pakistan, provincial governments, ZTBL, and the provincial cooperative banks will be involved in implementing the \nproposed policy and investment interventions, and hence will be actively involved. In addition, the proposed policy \nand  investment  options  complement  the  reforms  planned  under  Agriculture  Sector  Program  II  and  hence  require \ncoordination with the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Livestock and Cooperatives. Improved terms and trade volumes \nresulting from the proposed interventions under this loan and the ongoing reforms under Agriculture Sector Program \nII  necessitate  an  indirect  but  active  role  on  the  part  of  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  and  Industry.  Among  the  private \nsector,  the  efforts  to  improve  the  coverage  of  formal  sources  of  credit  will  have  a  direct  but  inverse  impact  on  the \ninform al sources of credit that will not be able to exploit the rural communities as much as now. On the other hand, \nsince these informal sources are mostly input suppliers, the increased demand for the inputs and resulting increases \nin  production  will  mean  some  gains  for  them  as  well.  Similarly,  agriculture-related  industry  through  indirect \ninvolvement  would  benefit  from  the  gains  from  the  proposed  interventions.  Among  the  civil  society,  the  employees \nthat  will  become  redundant  due  to  rightsizing  will  be  directly  affected  and  their  participation  will  be  essential. \nNongovernment  organizations  will  be  yet  another  participant  who  will  help  implement  the  social  intermediation \nprocess  in  coordination  with  microfinance  institutions  using  the  resources  of  the  Microfinance Social Development \nFund established under the ADB-funded Microfinance Sector Development Program.3  \n\nParticipation Strategy                            Yes \n\n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2000.

During  implementation,  the  proposed  policy  and  investment \ninterventions  will  follow  an  integrated  participatory  approach.

However, there \nmay be some positive impacts on resettlement due \nto  improved  productivity  in  agriculture,  greater \nemployment,  and  more  diversified  employment \nopportunities in the rural economy. \nNo  adverse  issues  are  anticipated.  In  contrast, \nthere will be a number of positive impacts such as \nimproved access of women to formal credit, as the \nnew  microfinance  institutions  will  be  mandated  to \nprovide  25%  of  loans  to  women.  Improved  access \nto  lending  along  with  necessary  mobilization  and \ntraining  will \nof  women \nentrepreneurs  in  the  rural  economies.  Increased \naccess  for  women  will  require  that  additional \nwomen  staff  be  inducted.  This  will  have  the \nbeneficial  impact  of  job  creation  for  women  and \nwomen empowerment. \nNo  adverse  issues  are  anticipated.  In  contrast, \nreduced  dependence  on  very  expensive  and \nexploitive  informal  sources  of  credit  will  not  only \nreduce  farmers\u2019  price  of  inputs,  and  cost  of \nproduction,  but  also  ensure  that  the  farmers  are \nable  to  get  market  price  for  the  produce.  In \naddition, farmers will have the option to choose the \nsupplier  offering  the  best  quality  inputs.  The \nreduced costs of production along with productivity \nimprovements  resulting  from  these  will  create  a \nmore  competitive  farming  sector  that  will  help \nreduce  dependence  on  subsidies  and  tariffs  on \nimports to stay afloat. \nAs  a  result  of  the  proposed  restructuring  of  ZTBL, \nabout 3,000 staff are expected to be retrenched. A \nretrenchment  plan  has  been  prepared  to  ensure \nthat the adverse effects are properly mitigated. The \nloan, \nnew \nmicrofinance  institutions,  is  expected  to  create \nemployment  opportunities,  which  will  absorb  the \ncapable staff made surplus by the restructuring of \nZTBL.  In  contrast,  the  implementation  of  the \nproposed  interventions  is  expected  to  annually \nproduce  1  million  person  days  of  incremental \nemployment  opportunities  in  the  agriculture  and \nequivalent  of  75,000  full  time  jobs  in  the  nonfarm \nsubsector  of  the  rural  economy.
