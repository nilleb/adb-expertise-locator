It  includes  a  capacity  development  component  to \nimprove corporate performance and a social development component to foster gender equality.2   \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nUzbekistan is one of the fastest-growing economies in Central Asia, aspiring to become \nan  upper-middle-income  country  by  2020.  The  economy  has  sustained  a  high  growth  rate \naveraging  over  8%  (2007\u20132013).  Generally,  stable  macroeconomic  conditions  and  robust \ngrowth  are  set  to  continue  as  Uzbekistan  aims  to  develop  a  highly  developed  and  diversified \nindustrial and export base. In particular, the Karakalpakstan and Khorezm regions, inhabited by \n3 million people and located in the western part of Uzbekistan, will continue to attract important \ninvestment projects. Reliable power supply is critical to support industrial development in these \nregions.  Indeed,  these  regions  expect  power  demand  to  grow  at  3%,  double  the  expected \nmedium-term national average rate of 1.5%.  \n \n4. \nThe  Takhiatash  TPP  is  the  main  source  of  power  supply  in  the  Karakalpakstan  and \nKhorezm  regions.  In  2012,  power  consumption  in  these  regions  was  2,293 gigawatt-hours \n(GWh)  with  maximum  load  of  466 megawatts  (MW).  By  2020,  the  power  consumption  is \nexpected  to  exceed  3,620 GWh,  with  maximum  load  of  620 MW.  With  730 MW  of  installed \ncapacity,  the  Takhiatash  TPP  now  comprises  five  gas-fired  steam  turbine  generation  units. \nThree  units  totaling  310  MW  have  passed  their  designed  economic  life,  and  have  been \noperating  with  derated  capacity  (130 MW),  low  thermal  efficiency  (23.7%),  and  limited  plant \navailability  (25%).3 The  other  two  units,  totaling  420 MW,  are  26  years  old  or  less.4 However, \ntheir capacity is derated by 15%, the efficiency is low at 31%, and they are overutilized to meet \ndemand, which prevents regular maintenance.  \n \nTo  ensure  reliable  power  supply,  the  government  and  Uzbekenergo,  the  state-owned \n5. \npower  utility,  identified  the  project  as  a  priority,  and  decided  to  (i)  construct  two  CCGT  units \n(230\u2013280 MW each); (ii) decommission three existing power units (Nos. 1\u20133); and (iii) maintain \ntwo  power  units  (Nos. 7\u20138)  for  backup  operation.  This  approach\u2014construction  of  energy-\nefficient  units  while  decommissioning  old  and  inefficient  ones\u2014will  be  the  first  integrated \nmodernization  model  and  will  pave  the  way  to  restructuring  a  power  sector  that  faces  acute \nissues with aging assets.  \n \n\n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA): ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the  Takhiatash Power Plant Efficiency Improvement Project. Manila. \n(TA 8142-UZB, for $1.2 million, approved on 16 August 2012). \n\n3   Of the three units, two of 100 MW each (No. 1 and No. 2) were built in 1969; No. 3, of 110 MW, was built in 1974.  \n4   No. 7, commissioned in 1987, and No. 8, commissioned in 1990, have installed capacity of 210 MW each.  \n\n\fIndeed, Uzbekistan\u2019s power generation plants are generally old and inefficient, requiring \n6. \nurgent  modernization.  The  aging  power  plants  are  a  result  of  underinvestment  in  power \ninfrastructure after the collapse of the Soviet Union. More than 75% of the power plant units are \nover 30 years old, reaching or exceeding their economic life.5 The thermal efficiency averages \n31%, while that of energy-efficient CCGTs exceeds 50%. Although the country is endowed with \nabundant  proven  natural  gas  reserves  and  potential  gas  reserves  are  being  explored,  natural \ngas  is  not  infinite. The  reserve to production  ratio for  the  country\u2019s  natural  gas  is  estimated  at \nabout 25\u201330 years. Replacing existing power generation assets with energy-efficient equipment \nis  a  key  strategy  for  saving  energy,  securing  reliable  power  supply,  and  reducing  greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emission.  \n \n7. \nTo  date,  Uzbekistan\u2019s  power  sector  has  shown  steady  progress  in  meeting  new \nchallenges. In an attempt to improve energy efficiency, one CCGT was commissioned in Navoi \nTPP  and  four  more  CCGT  units  are  under  preparation  with  confirmed  funding.6 On  the  sector \nreform,  the  electricity  tariffs  have  been  steadily  raised  since  2004  to  ensure  financial \nsustainability.  Financial  transparency  has  improved  since  Uzbekenergo, with  the  assistance of \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  adopted  external  audits  based  on  the  International \nStandards  of  Auditing  (ISA)  starting  from  fiscal  year  (FY)  2011. 7  Further,  to  reduce  high \nelectricity  losses  and  to  spur  demand-side  energy  efficiency  improvement,  Uzbekenergo  has \nsecured  funding  to  introduce  an  advanced  electricity  metering  program  in  nine  of  the  14 \nregions.8 \n \n8. \nNonetheless,  further  efforts  to  improve  Uzbekenergo\u2019s  corporate  performance  are \nnecessary.  The  utility  needs  to  develop  a  strategy  and  build  the  capacity  to  become  more \ncommercially  bankable  in  the  medium  term.  It  needs  to  introduce  a  modern  management \nsystem with performance accountability. Uzbekistan and Uzbekenergo will benefit from learning \nand  adopting  best  international  practices  for  tariff  determination  to  improve  efficiency  and  to \nensure \ninfrastructure  needs \nimprovements in management information system.  \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  for \nUzbekistan, which includes a focus on energy efficiency and reliable power supply.9 The project \nis included in the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for Uzbekistan.10 ADB has three \nongoing projects in the energy sector, addressing the need for energy efficiency, reliable power \nsupply, and development of renewable energy (footnotes 7 and 8).11  \n  \n\nfull  cost  recovery.

The outcome will be increased \nenergy-efficient  power  supply  for  the  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm  regions.  The  project  will \ngenerate  more  electricity  with  less  gas,  lower  GHG  emission,  and  less  water,  thereby \ncontributing  to  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation.

The  project  will  construct  two  CCGT  units  (230\u2013280 MW \n11. \neach) with at least 52% thermal efficiency at the existing Takhiatash TPP. Three existing units \n(Nos. 1\u20133)  will  be  decommissioned  and  two  (Nos. 7\u20138)  will  be  kept  for  backup  power \ngeneration, while underutilized structures (blocks 1 and 2) will be demolished and the land will \nbe  remediated.  A  single  turnkey  contractor  will  undertake  these  physical  components.  An \nimplementation consultant will prepare the bidding documents.  \n \n12. \nCapacity  development.  The project will develop Uzbekenergo\u2019s capacity for becoming \na  commercially  bankable  utility.  Tariff  methodology  study  and  training  will  develop  the  skills \nrequired  to  improve  the  tariff  determination  model  and  ensure  cost-recovering  tariff  setting. \nCorporate  performance  management  capacity  will  be  measured  and  managed  by  developing \nkey  performance  indicators.  A risk-profile assessment  study  will  help Uzbekenergo gain  better \naccess to financing. The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) consultant prepared the \nterms of reference and the capacity development road map.  \n \n13. \nSocial  development. The project will build a community social service center adjacent \nto the Takhiatash TPP. The center, open to TPP employees and residents of Takhiatash City, \nwill  create  jobs  and  include facilities  such  as  laundry  services,  health  checkups,  and  a gym. It \nwill thus help improve the community\u2019s welfare and foster gender equality. The need for these \nfacilities was established in a social survey undertaken by the project preparatory TA consultant. \nThe Takhiatash TPP will be responsible for the sustainable operation of the facilities. \n \nD. \n \n14. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $700 million (Table 2). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta \n\n \n\nItem \nA.

The \ncooling  system  will  need  to  withstand extreme  weather conditions  both in summer  and winter, \nand  the  two-stage  bidding  procedure  will  allow  the  bidders  to  propose  the  optimal  solutions \nincluding air, wet, or hybrid cooling system. The CCGT units will provide base and peak power \ngeneration  to  ensure  safe,  more  flexible,  and  efficient  operation.  The  whole  system  will  be \ndesigned,  supplied,  and  installed  by  a  single  system  integrator.  Construction  of  the  units  will \ntake about 30 months, and the units will be operated and maintained by the Takhiatash TPP.  \n \n20. \nThe  power  plant  infrastructure\u2014e.g.,  power  evacuation,  gas  supply,  and  water  supply \nsystems\u2014has  been  constructed  for  the  existing  capacity  of  730  MW.  Natural  gas  is  supplied \nfrom  the Gazli  Group  gas field  in Bukhara  region,  and the  dedicated gas distribution  station  is \nlocated about 2 kilometers away from the Takhiatash TPP. Gas reserves and supply capacity of \n1,014.5  million  cubic  meters  per  year  is  assured  for  the  lifetime  of  the  CCGT  units  through \nrenewal  of  the  annual  gas  supply  contract  with  Uzbekneftegaz,  another  wholly  state-owned \nenterprise.  Water  is  supplied  from  the  Amu  Darya  River  through  the  canal.  Two  other  canals \nwith pump stations act as backup canals. The two backup canals will be running only when the \nwater  level  is  low  in  the  intake  canal.  Power  is  evacuated  through  the  110-kilovolt  and  220-\nkilovolt  substations  and  can  be  evacuated  through  the  existing  switchgears  and  transmission \nlines  with  minor  upgrades  on  the  switchyard.  The  transmission  capacity  is  540 MW  and \nsufficient for the project. However, Uzbekenergo has a plan to expand the transmission capacity \nto improve stability and reliability of the grid in the future. \n \n21. \nAfter  commissioning  the  first  CCGT  unit,  the  power  generation  units  Nos.  1\u20132  will  be \ndecommissioned.  Power  unit  No.  3  will  be  decommissioned  after  the  second  CCGT  unit  is \ncommissioned.  The  outdated  units  Nos.  1\u20133  have  exceeded  their  designed  economic  life  and \nare currently running at an efficiency of about 24%. The project will also demolish the remaining \nstructures  for  the  already  dismantled  units  1  and  2.  The  other  two  units  (Nos.  7  and  8)  have \nbeen  overutilized  to  meet  increasing  power  demand  in  the  Karakalpakstan  and  Khorezm \nregions,  which  left  no  time  for  sufficient  maintenance.  After  the  two  CCGT  units  are \ncommissioned, units Nos. 7\u20138 will be maintained as backup during maintenance and overhaul \nof the CCGT units.  \n \n22. \nAlthough  the  Takhiatash  TPP  is  well  endowed  with  engineers  experienced  in  steam \nturbine  operation  and  maintenance,  operating  a  CCGT  requires  different  technical  know-how. \nTraining  the  plant  engineers  in  CCGT  operation  and  maintenance  will  be  part  of  the \nengineering, procurement, and construction contract. \n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n23. \nThe project is financially and economically viable. The financial internal rate of return is \n6.6%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  at  0.8%.  The \nincremental benefits include the sale of additional power generated by the two CCGT units, and \ngas savings as a result of higher energy efficiency of the CCGT technology.  \n \n24. \nThe  economic  benefits  comprise  incremental  benefits  as  a  result  of  more  electricity \nconsumption  and  nonincremental  benefits  from  fuel  savings.  The  sensitivity  analysis  suggests \nsufficient robustness of the project under all tested assumptions. The economic internal rate of \nreturn is 32.6%, which is greater than the economic opportunity cost of capital.  \n \nUzbekenergo  has  operated  profitably  since  2008.  The  gross  profit  margin  has  been \n25. \nabove  10%  throughout  the  period,  but  has  decreased  from  35.1%  in  2008  to  11.3%  in  2012, \nlargely due to higher-cost maintenance of aging facilities. Despite slow growth in the volume of \nelectricity sales (at an annual average of 1.5% since 2008), low fuel costs and semiannual tariff \nadjustments to reflect inflation have contributed to the profitability of Uzbekenergo. \n \n26. \nFinancial  projections  for  2013\u20132020  indicate  that  the  financial  base  remains  stable  if \ntariff adjustment remains synchronized with inflation and gas prices. Improvement of tariff policy \nand  determination  practice  under  the  capacity  development  component  of  this  project  will \nensure the sustainability of Uzbekenergo\u2019s profitability, and boost its ability to attract financing. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n27. \nThe  pre-mitigation  risk  level  of  Uzbekenergo  is  considered  substantial  given  that  its \ncurrent  financial  management  capacity  requires  further  strengthening,  especially  in  the \nrecruitment and retention of qualified financial and accounting professionals, automation of the \naccounts  consolidation  and  management  reporting  process,  and  ability  to  become  fully \ncompliant  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS).  Uzbekenergo  needs  to \nstrengthen its financial management capacity.  \n \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  accounting  policies,  procedures,  and  financial  reporting  have  followed \n28. \nUzbekistan\u2019s  national  accounting  and  auditing  standards.  However,  to  step  up  its  financial \nmanagement,  Uzbekenergo  undertook  an  external  audit  of  its  financial  statements  in  FY2011 \nbased on the ISA issued by the International Assurance Auditing Standards Board. The results \nindicated  the  need  for  further  improvements,  such  as  in  the  classification  methods  and \nimpairment  provisions  on  account  receivables,  the  scope  of  account  consolidation,  and  the \naccounting  system.  Uzbekenergo  started  to  adopt  the  IFRS  in  FY2012.  The  capacity \ndevelopment plan under other ADB-financed projects will strengthen Uzbekenergo\u2019s information \nsystems  with  the  objective  of  improving  its  financial  management  capability  (footnote  7). \nUzbekenergo\u2019s financial management risk after mitigation is moderate. \n \n29. \nUzbekenergo\u2019s procurement capacity was assessed as average risk. As an institution, it \nhas  experience with  multilateral  and  bilateral financiers,  including  ADB.  However,  the  capacity \nof  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  is  weak.  An  international  project  preparatory  TA \nconsultant has provided procurement training for Uzbekenergo\u2019s key PMU staff. Consultants will \nbe  recruited  to  take  part  in  the  bidding  process  and  handle  project  management  and \nsupervision.  An  early-warning  system  will  be  established  to  ensure  timely  procurement  and \nproject implementation.  \n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n30. \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Uzbekenergo.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 13). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n31. \nThe  increased  efficiency  and  reliability  resulting  from  the  project  will  have  a  positive \nimpact  on  economic growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Electricity  is  essential  not  only  for  rich and \nmiddle-income consumers but also for the poor to meet their basic needs. The project area of \nKarakalpakstan  is  a  socially  and  environmentally  vulnerable  area.  The  Karakalpakstan  and \nKhorezm regions, with 3 million people in urban and rural areas, are the direct beneficiaries of \nthe  project.  Small  local  businesses,  as  well  as  service  providers  such  as  schools  and  health \ncenters,  will  also  benefit  from  more  reliable  power  supply.  Reliable  power  supply  is  also \nessential  for  large-scale  industrial  development  projects,  which  would  bring  much-needed \nincome opportunities to the regions.  \n \nThe  project  features  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  More  reliable  power  supply  to \n32. \nhouseholds will benefit women, who are mostly the managers of household activities.  Reliable \nlighting for homes, businesses, streets, and marketplaces is also critical for facilitating women\u2019s \nand girls\u2019 involvement in educational, entrepreneurial, and community activities. The project will \nconstruct a community social service center, which will be equipped with facilities to cater for the \nlaundry, dry-cleaning, and carpet-cleaning needs of the local community, especially women, as \nwell as Takhiatash TPP staff\u2014in all, about 50,000 people. The center will generate employment \nfor  at  least  20  women  (50%  of  jobs  created).  This  will  provide  significant  gender  benefits  and \nreduce  women\u2019s  time  poverty,  given  that  more  than  90%  of  households  have  no  washing \nmachines  and  women so far  had  to  do  laundry  by  hand.  To  promote gender  equality,  the key \nperformance indicators to be developed under the capacity development component will include \ngender indicators.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nfor  environment,  and  will \n\nEnvironment.  The  project \n\n33. \ninvolve \nis  categorized  A \nimprovement of existing facilities. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \n(SPS),  an  environmental  impact  assessment  for  construction  of  the  CCGT  units  and \ndecommissioning  of  existing  units  was  prepared,  and  was  disclosed  on  20  May  2013.  An \nenvironmental  compliance  audit  was  also  carried  out.  The  environmental  impact  assessment \ncovers  the findings from  the  environmental  compliance audit. The  environmental  management \nplan  was  prepared  to  mitigate  impacts  from  the  construction  of  the  CCGT  units.  Corrective \naction  is  planned  to  improve  the  environmental  performance  of  the  existing  facilities.  Two \nconsultations with potentially affected people were carried out in May 2013 and July 2013, and a \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  was  established  within  the  Takhiatash  TPP  to  resolve  any \ncomplaints. \n \n34. \nBuilding  the  CCGT  units  will  generate  temporary  and  reversible  impacts  such  as  dust, \nnoise, and vibrations. Operating the CCGT units will have positive impacts because ambient air \nquality will improve due to fewer emissions, and water use and noise levels will be lower than in \nthe current units. The Takhiatash TPP will strengthen its health and safety unit by adding staff \nwho  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  environmental  management  plan,  including  the \ncorrective  action  plan  to  improve  the  environmental  performance  of  the  existing  facilities. \nUzbekenergo \nthe \nto \nenvironmental management plan, which are considered adequate.  \n\nimplementing  mitigation  measures \n\nis  committed \n\nincorporated \n\nin \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f \n35. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  project  is  categorized  B  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Building \nthe CCGT units will require additional land next to the existing facilities. The land acquisition and \nresettlement  plan  (LARP)  was  prepared  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS  (2009)  and  was \ndisclosed on 1 August 2013. The LARP was also prepared in accordance with the government\u2019s \nresolution  on  land  acquisitions.  Aside  from  individual  consultations  with  affected  people  while \nsurveying the inventory of losses, the official consultation with affected people was carried out \non  10\u201313  May  2013.  More consultations  are  planned if the  LARP  needs  to  be  updated  during \ndetailed design, as well as during the implementation of the LARP.  \n \n36. \nPermanent  land  acquisition  will  involve  2.29  hectares  and  temporary  acquisition  will \ninvolve 4.55 hectares. This will affect 10 households, two private firms, and two farms, with 144 \naffected people. Buildings affected by land acquisition cover an area of 3,950 square meters, of \nwhich  1,980  square  meters  belong  to  two  private  businesses.  Based  on  the  government \nresolution  and  ADB\u2019s  SPS  (2009),  it  is  estimated  that  compensation  costs  for  land  acquisition \nwill be around $1.4 million. The social compliance audit revealed no past or present complaints \nabout land being used for the existing facilities.  \n \n37. \nThe  project  is  categorized  C  for  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  SPS \n(2009). All the ethnic groups living in the project areas have equal access to all social and other \nservices, including health, education, and water and sanitation. None of the groups are socially \nexcluded either in terms of legislation or in terms of the actual social living conditions. Further, \nnone of the ethnic groups maintain cultural or social identities and characteristics separate from \nthe  mainstream  Uzbekistan  society,  that  would  classify  them  as  ethnic  minorities  and/or \nindigenous peoples.  \n \n38. \nSafeguard capacity. Uzbekenergo has experience in implementing ADB\u2019s requirements \nfor  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  It  has  a  capacity  development  program  under  an \nexisting  ADB-financed  project,  which  aims  to  enhance  its  institutional  safeguard  capacity \n(footnote 7). Moreover, to step up its compliance with the safeguard requirements, Uzbekenergo \nwill employ a safeguards expert through the project implementation consulting firm.   \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.14 The  overall  risk  is  low  with  the  mitigation \nmeasures. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\n(i)  Training in operation and maintenance will be included in the turnkey contract.  \n\nRisks \nLimited operational \nexperience with CCGTs  \nDelayed procurement \nand implementation of \nturnkey contract \n\n(i)  An international consulting firm will be recruited during project implementation.  \n(ii)  The PMU will recruit experienced procurement specialists. \n(iii)  Procurement training is provided through PPTA to the PMU staff.   \n(iv)  The institutions responsible for contract registration assessment will be involved in \nthe procurement and consultant recruitment process to avoid delays in the contract \nregistration required for contract effectiveness.  \n\n(v)  ADB will continue dialogue with the government to improve the contract registration \n\nand review process.  \n \n\n                                                \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nTariff level becomes \nsuboptimal  \nLimited financial \nmanagement capacity \n\nMitigating Measures \n(i)  The government has increased the tariff regularly at a rate above the inflation rate, \n\nand confirmed that the same policy will be maintained.  \n\n(i)  No imprest account will be established.
