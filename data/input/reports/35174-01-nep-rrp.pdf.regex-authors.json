EFA aims to (i) increase equity of access to education and \nsocial  inclusion;  (ii)  improve  quality  and  relevance;  and  (iii) \nenhance efficiency and institutional capacity. \n \nAs the country is emerging from years of conflict following the \nchanges in the political context since April 2006, Nepal is poised \nto  enter  a  new  era  of  development  that  has  raised  people\u2019s \nexpectations and demands with respect to the delivery of good \nquality  education.  The  education  system  is  under  pressure  to \nfurther improve its services beyond what has been achieved so far \nunder  EFA.  Within  this  changing  context,  the  Government  of \nNepal recognizes that 5 years of basic education is not sufficient \nand intends to extend basic education coverage to grades 1\u20138 \nand secondary education to grades 9\u201312. The Government also \nintends  to  improve  synergies  between  basic  education  and \nsecondary  education  to  achieve  a  more  holistic  approach  to \nschool education.  \n \nThe Government has prepared a draft school sector reform (SSR) \ncore document which will guide the preparation and the transition \nfrom the current subsector approach, with education financed by \nprograms such as EFA, to an integrated school sector.  ", "ii \n \n  The draft core document provides an overview of policy intents \nand strategic options for an integrated school system. It provides \nthe rationale for extending basic education to grades 1\u20138, and \nsecondary  education  to  grades  9\u201312.  It  also  takes  a  holistic \napproach  to  school  education  by  integrating  early  childhood \ndevelopment,  formal  education,  alternative  education,  and \ntechnical  education.  The  core  document  details  the  technical, \nmanagerial, regulatory, and financial issues, and the challenges \ninvolved in developing an integrated education system. The draft \ncore  document  contains  a  well-articulated  and  clear  vision  for \nSSR. It provides a solid basis for further elaboration of the reform \nprocess. \n \nThe core document acknowledges the achievements of EFA and \nthe national movement that it has created. SSR is viewed as a \ncombination of affirmative actions and policy changes aimed at \nattaining the EFA goals by 2015. At the same time, SSR builds \nupon lessons learned from EFA and attempts to address systemic \nissues that impede the progress of the education system. \n \nThe preparation of a comprehensive reform program such as SSR \nis a complex and lengthy process that requires several important \nsteps. The Government has prepared an initial SSR transitional \nplan that sets immediate (2007), medium-term (2010), and long-\nterm (2015\u20132016) outcomes and outputs for the key policy reform \nareas  for  SSR.  Planned  actions  under  the  transitional  plan \nbetween  2007  and  2010  include  the  preparation  of  regulatory \nframeworks,  policy  guidelines,  norms  and  standards,  and \noperational procedures. It also includes a model-building of the \nextension of basic education from grades 1\u20135 to grades 1\u20138 in \nselected  districts.  Furthermore,  stakeholders\u2019  capacity-\ndevelopment requirements at all levels are to be identified, and \ncapacity development initiated. \n \nIt is expected that lessons learned and experiences gained from \nimplementation of grade 1\u20138 basic education in selected districts \nand  schools  will  result  in  an  improved  and  final  SSR  core \ndocument. The final core document will guide the implementation \nof an SSR program expected to start in FY2010. It will serve as a \npolicy and planning guide for gradual introduction of the grade 1\u2013\n12 integrated system throughout the country. \n ", "iii \n \nProgram Cluster  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  launched  the  Education \nSector Program (ESP) cluster and approved its first subprogram \nfor an amount of $30 million on 1 December 2006. The ESP \nsupports  the  Government\u2019s  school  sector  reform  (SSR),  which \naims to restructure the school system into an integrated grade 1\u2013\n12 system in a phased manner. The expected outcome of the \nESP  is  a  more  equitable,  inclusive,  effective,  and  holistic \neducation system.  \n \nThe ESP adopted an innovative program cluster design to allow a \nphased  approach  to  prepare  and  implement  SSR.  Three \nsubprograms will be developed and implemented in accordance \nwith the time frame and progress of the SSR from 2007 to 2012. \n \nThe ESP subprogram I supports the ongoing Nepal EFA program \n(2004\u20132009)  for  basic  and  primary  education  (grades  1\u20135).  A \ncapacity-development grant of $2 million complements the ESP \nsubprogram I to develop Government stakeholders\u2019 capacity in \npolicy analysis, formulation, and coordination. It also supports the \npreparation of an SSR core document.  \n \nThe ESP subprogram II will support the preparation and transition \nto  SSR,  in  particular  a  model-building  exercise  of  the  basic \neducation extension to grades 1\u20138 in a few districts, as well as \nbroad capacity development for system readiness. The draft SSR \ncore document will be further developed and is expected to be \naccepted by the Government, development partners and other \nstakeholders. It is expected that lessons learned from the ESP \nsubprogram II will help the Government implement a countrywide \ngrade 1\u20138 restructuring.  \n \nThe ESP subprogram III will support full implementation of the \nSSR once the core document is finalized, financed, and the legal, \ngovernance, and financing framework is adjusted to a grade 1\u201312 \nschool system. \n \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The expected overall impact of the ESP cluster program, including \nthe ESP subprogram II, is enhanced educational attainment and \nlivelihood  for  all  children,  particularly  girls  and  disadvantaged \ngroups. The expected outcome of ESP subprogram II is a broadly \naccepted  and  adequately  financed  SSR  policy,  program,  and \nfinancing framework. \n \n   \n ", "iv \n \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested a program grant of $8 million from \nADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  contribute  to  the  SSR \ntransitional  plan.  In  parallel  with the ADB grant, as part  of the \nEuropean  Commission  contribution  to  the  school  sector,  the \nEuropean Commission will provide a program grant of \u20ac6 million to \nsupport organizational capacity-development activities, both within \nkey sector institutions in the country and with major stakeholders \nand communities. All EFA development partners have agreed to \njointly finance the Program within the existing EFA joint financing \narrangement (JFA).  \n \n   \nProgram Period and  The ESP subprogram II will be implemented over 4 years from \nTranching  January 2008 to December 2011. It is expected that program \ncompletion will be in December 2011 and the grant closing date \nwill be June 2012. The grant will be released in a single tranche \nupon  grant  effectiveness.  All  tranche  release  conditions  have \nbeen met. \n \n   \nExecuting Agency and  The Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) is the Executing \nImplementation  Agency  and  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  is  the \nArrangements  Implementing Agency. A central-level coordination committee has \nbeen established at MOES to effectively coordinate and monitor \nSSR  capacity-development  activities  implemented  by  various \nMOES  line  agencies.  The  EFA\u2019s  JFA  will  be  amended  to \nincorporate SSR transitional activities under ESP subprogram II. \nReporting  and  monitoring  of  progress  on  SSR  transitional \nactivities will be fully integrated into the ongoing reporting and \nmonitoring activities under EFA. \n   \nProcurement and  The  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nDisbursement  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired if, during each year that grant proceeds are expected to \nbe  disbursed,  the  value  of  total  imports  minus  imports  from \nnonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed \nunder other official development assistance, is equal to or greater \nthan the amount of the grant expected to be disbursed during \nsuch year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula with its withdrawal request. ADB reserves the right to \naudit the use of grant proceeds and verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification.  Procurement  of  eligible  items  and \nrecruitment  of  consultants  will  be  on  the  basis  of  standard \nGovernment procurement and recruitment practices acceptable to \nADB for procurement and recruitment by the Government or its \nrepresentatives. \n   \n ", "v \n \nCounterpart Funds  The  local  currency  funds  generated  from  the  proceeds  of  the \nprogram grant will be used by the Government to contribute to the \ncost associated with implementation of the SSR transitional plan. \n   \nProgram Benefits and  ESP II will benefit the children and youth of Nepal, particularly \nBeneficiaries  those who would otherwise be denied a quality and affordable \neducation. Through the model building of the 1\u20138 basic education \nin  selected  districts  and  through  system-wide  capacity \ndevelopment  of  the  education  key  stakeholders,  the  education \nsystem will be in a better position to successfully implement the \nSSR reform on a countrywide basis in FY2010. This will ultimately \nresult in an education system that is capable of providing better \nquality education, resulting in enhanced educational attainment \nand livelihoods for all children, particularly girls and disadvantaged \ngroups. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Potential delay in the political transition may delay some aspects \nof  the  reform  process.  Strategies  related  to  some  areas  of \neducation governance, financing, and structure may be decided at \na  later  stage.  However,  the  model-building  exercise,  capacity-\ndevelopment activities and further preparation in key education \nreform areas of quality improvement and assurance, and social \ninclusion, do not require the political process to be finalized, and \nhence will not be affected. Anticorruption measures under ESP \nsubprogram  II  will  follow  the  provisions  under  the  EFA\u2019s  JFA. \nParticularly,  EFA  partners  endorsed  a  financial  management \nimprovement action plan prepared by DOE. The EFA midterm \nreview concluded that the budgeting, accounting, and reporting \nprocedures under the JFA comply with fiduciary requirements in \nan  acceptable  manner.  Measures  to  (i)  improve  financial \nmanagement  pertinent  to  timely  disbursement  to  districts  and \nschools  and  submission  of  the  financial  monitoring  report,  (ii) \nsimplify and clarify guidelines, and (iii) strengthen monitoring and \ncoordination mechanisms at all levels, are being undertaken by \nDOE. DOE\u2019s financial management improvement action plan also \ncomprises  capacity  development  in  social  auditing  and  school \nauditing.  Both  ESP  subprograms  I  and  II  have  provisions  to \nsupport such capacity development.    \n \n   \n ", "", " ", "", "  1\nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for subprogram II of the Education Sector Program (ESP) Cluster. A design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.    \n  \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  The Program Cluster and Timing of Subprograms \n \n2.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  launched  the  ESP  and  approved  its  first \nsubprogram for an amount of $30 million on 1 December 2006.1 The Government recognizes \nthat  5  years  of  basic  education  are  not  sufficient  and  intends  to  extend  basic  education \ncoverage  to  grades  1\u20138  and  secondary  education  to  grades  9\u201312.  The  Government  also \nintends to improve synergies between basic education and secondary education to achieve a \nmore holistic approach to school education. The ESP supports the Government\u2019s school sector \nreform (SSR), which aims to restructure the school system into an integrated grade 1\u201312 \nsystem in a phased manner. The expected outcome of the ESP is a more equitable, inclusive, \neffective, and holistic education system.  \n \n3.  The ESP adopted an innovative program cluster design to allow a phased approach to \nprepare  and  implement  SSR.  Three  subprograms  will  be  developed  and  implemented  in \naccordance  with  the  time  frame  and  progress  of  the  SSR  from  2007  to  2012.  The  ESP \nsubprogram I supports the ongoing Nepal Education for All (EFA) program (2004\u20132009) for \nbasic  and  primary  education  (grades  1\u20135).  A  capacity-development  grant  of  $2  million \ncomplements the ESP subprogram I to develop Government stakeholders\u2019 capacity in policy \nanalysis,  formulation,  and  coordination.  It  also  supports  the  preparation  of  an  SSR  core \ndocument. The ESP subprogram II will support the preparation and transition to the SSR, in \nparticular a model-building exercise of the basic education extension to grades 1\u20138 in a few \ndistricts, as well as broad capacity development for system readiness. The draft SSR core \ndocument  will  be  further  developed  and  is  expected  to  be  accepted  by  the  Government, \ndevelopment partners and other stakeholders. It is expected that lessons learned from the ESP \nsubprogram II will help the Government implement a countrywide grade 1\u20138 restructuring. The \nESP subprogram III will support full implementation of the SSR once the core document is \nfinalized, financed, and the legal, governance, and financing framework is adjusted to a grade \n1\u201312 school system. \n \n4.  The  timing  of  the  subprograms  will  not  precisely  follow  a  sequential  order  but  will \noverlap. The ESP subprogram I supports the EFA program from FY2007 to FY2009. The ESP \nsubprogram II will start in 2008, towards the end of the EFA implementation, and will initiate the \ntransition towards the SSR program. This is because the preparation for SSR needs to start \nearly, so that lessons learned from the model building can be integrated into the new SSR. As \nthe EFA and the Secondary Education Support Project (grades 6\u201310)2 will end by FY2009, a \nnew  SSR  program  covering  grades  1\u201312  is  expected  to  start  the  same  year.  The  ESP \nsubprogram III will therefore start in FY2010 to support the SSR program. Figure 1 describes \nthe sequencing of the subprograms.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006.

Program-Based Approach   \n \n5.  The second innovative feature of the ESP is the use of a program-based approach. EFA \nis Nepal\u2019s first truly program-based approach in education under which development partners \npool funds and use country systems and fully harmonized procedures for their contributions. \nCore financing of EFA is through a joint financing arrangement (JFA) under which development \npartners3 provide budgetary support to EFA. Program activities and budget items are mutually \nagreed upon by EFA partners before the beginning of each fiscal year, through a review of an \nannual rolling plan, the annual strategic implementation plan (ASIP), and the annual work plan \nand budget (AWPB). Development partners' annual commitments are based on outcome and \nprocess performance indicators.  \n \n6.  The  ESP  is  one  of  the  most  far-reaching  programs  in  terms  of  alignment  with \ngovernment procedures and donor harmonization in education, and the first program-based \napproach supported by ADB. The ESP uses program lending and adjusts it to program-based \napproach  features.  As  such,  ESP  tranche  releases  are  contingent  upon  annually  agreed \nprogram outcomes and progress rather than policy milestones. The ESP also marked a radical \nchange in ADB assistance in education in Nepal from a project approach to a multipartner \nprogram-based approach.   \n \nC.  Subprogram II Presentation  \n \n7.  The ESP subprogram II design follows key ESP cluster program features with little \nchange  in  the  intended  policy  and  program  actions.  Therefore,  this  report  updates  the \n                                                 \n3 As of FY2007, joint financing arrangement (JFA) partners are ADB, Denmark, Finland, Norway, United Kingdom, \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and World Bank. The European Commission intends to join JFA from \nFY2008. The non-JFA partners who provide parallel financing to EFA are Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and World Food Programme.  \n ", "3 \n \nmacroeconomic and political situation and the progress of ESP subprogram I implementation, \nand describes ESP subprogram II details including the updated policy matrix. Other technical \nanalyses and program implementation arrangements pertinent to the ESP cluster program have \nnot changed since the approval of ESP subprogram I and therefore may be found in the ESP \nsubprogram I report and recommendation of the President (footnote 1).    \n \nIII.  THE MACROECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONTEXT  \n8.  Despite political uncertainty, Nepal has achieved broad macroeconomic stability over the \npast 5 years. Annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth during 2003\u20132007 averaged 2.7% \nand inflation was 5.5%. Economic growth is expected to increase in anticipation of further \nstabilization of the political process, which holds promise of sustained peace and a transition to \na more productive economy. Per capita GDP reached $312 in 2006, compared to $241 in 2001. \nIn addition to a consolidation of the peace process, the country will also require increased \nresource mobilization and productivity gains in order to achieve higher sustainable growth. An \ninvestor-friendly climate would create more employment, generate technological benefits, and \ncontribute to overall economic competitiveness, while a skilled labor force would contribute to \nraising domestic productivity.  \n \n9.  The nonagricultural sector is gradually diversifying and creating higher-paying jobs. In \naddition,  an  increasing  number  of  people  are  seeking  employment  abroad.  Remittances\u2014\namounting to $1.3 billion, or 15% of GDP, in 2006\u2014are one of the country\u2019s major income \nsources and have helped improve the living standards of a large number of people. Appropriate \ntraining opportunities for workers abroad are needed under the reform process in education.   \n \n10.  The Government\u2019s 3-year interim plan for FY2008\u2013FY20104 puts special emphasis on \nincreasing  public  expenditure  to  enhance  employment,  as  well  as  on  peace  building, \nreconstruction, rehabilitation, reintegration, inclusion, and revitalization of the economy. The \nannual average economic growth rate for the interim plan period is projected to be 5.5%. \n \n11.  Within this context, the Government recognizes the importance of the education sector. \nEducation is the largest sector within the government budget. For FY2008, NRs28.07 billion out \nof a total budget of NRs168.99 billion is allocated to the education sector. This represents \n16.6% of the total budget, up from just under 16.0% in FY2007.  \n \n12.  On the political front, the country underwent a political transformation following the April \n2006 ceasefire. As a result of a popular movement, the parliament was restored. Subsequently, \nin November 2006 a comprehensive peace accord was signed between a seven-party alliance \nand  the  Communist  Party  of  Nepal  (Maoist).  An  interim  constitution  was  agreed  on  18 \nDecember 2006, promulgated on the first day of the formation of the interim parliament (15 \nJanuary 2007) and amended twice\u2014in March and June 2007. The interim constitution has the \nfollowing provisions pertinent to education: (i) each community will have the right to receive \nbasic education in its mother language, and (ii) each citizen will have the right to receive free \neducation up to the secondary level as provided by law. \n \n13.  In mid-September 2007, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) withdrew from the \ninterim government, and constituent assembly elections originally scheduled for 22 November \n2007 were postponed until mid-April 2008. However, the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) \n                                                 \n4National Planning Commission, Government of Nepal. 2007.

The constituent assembly will be tasked with writing a new constitution in line with the \nvision of a decentralized political structure for Nepal. Political consensus about a move to \ndecentralization is broad. The precise form and extent of decentralization will be subject to the \noutcome of the political process. At this stage, it is not yet clear precisely what government \nfunctions will be decentralized. A highly decentralized system could imply the decentralization of \nall state functions, except a number of core functions such as finance, foreign policy, and \ndefense.  This  would  imply  also  that  education  would  become  the  responsibility  of  the \ndecentralized  system,  with  possibly  only  a  central  education  board  remaining  a  national \nresponsibility.  Other  less  drastic  forms  of  a  decentralized  state  would  continue  to  include \neducation as a national responsibility. The educational governance system will need to be \naligned with changes in the overall government structure. \n \n15.  The political changes in the country have improved the chances for lasting peace and \nthe creation of a prosperous, peaceful, and inclusive Nepal. The changes have also raised \npeople\u2019s expectations and demands with respect to public services. Demand from the people for \nan equitable delivery of good quality education is increasing. The educational management \nsystems  at  various  levels,  including  the  schools,  are  under  pressure  to  respond  to  these \nemerging challenges by improving their services. The restoration of peace has created an \natmosphere more conducive to educational reconstruction and development. \n \nIV.  PROGRESS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF SUBPROGRAM I \nA.  Program Implementation \n \n1.  Education For All Outcome Progress  \n16.  EFA  is  currently  in  its  third  year  of  implementation.  An  EFA  midterm  review  was \nconducted in May 2007, with national stakeholders and all EFA development partners. Overall, \nthe  midterm  review  concluded  that  access  to  schools  has  improved  considerably,  but \nchallenges remain in improving the quality and social and geographic equity of basic and \nprimary  education.  Findings  of  the  midterm  review  on  outcomes  of  the  EFA  program  are \nsummarized below. Appendix 2 contains a table with the status of EFA indicators.  \n(i)  Early childhood development (ECD) centers have expanded, as is evident in the \nproportion of grade 1 students with ECD experience, which has increased from \n8% in 2001 to 18.3% in 2006. The percentage of dalit5 children enrolled in grade \n1 with ECD experience is 17.3%; for janajati6 children the figure is 21.0%. For \nother social groups the proportion of grade 1 students with ECD experience is \n16.5%.  \n(ii)  Enrolment,  including  enrolment  of  girls,  has  increased.  This  has  led  to  an \nincrease in the net enrolment rate, from 81% in 2001 to 87.4% in 2006. The \npercentage of dalit enrolments is 17.7%, janajati enrolments are 38%, while other \nsocial groups account for the remaining 44.3%. The gender parity index has also \nincreased, from 0.6 in 2001 to 0.94 in 2006. The primary-level enrolment for girls \nis 48% of the total enrolment. The percentage of girls\u2019 enrolment in mountain \ndistricts is 47.5%, in hill districts 49.7%, and in Terai districts 47.2%.  \n                                                 \n5 Historically disadvantaged occupational caste group. \n6 Ethnic minority group. \n ", "5 \n \n(iii)  The  rapid  increase  in  enrolment  has  also  resulted  in  an  increased  gross \nenrolment rate, from 123% in 2001 to 138.8% in 2006, which puts the schools \nunder enormous pressure. The situation is of great concern, especially in grade 1 \nwhere the gross intake rate is 148%.  \n(iv)  The total survival rate to grade 5 is 80.3%, up from 66% in 2001. It is 77.4% for \ngirls and 83.0% for boys. The survival rate ranges from 61.5% in the central Terai \ndistricts to 95.2% in the Kathmandu Valley. \n(v)  The student\u2013teacher ratio has increased from 39:1 in 2001 to 45.2:1 in 2006, \ndespite the allocation of additional teachers. The highest student\u2013teacher ratio is \nin the Terai (58.1:1) while the lowest is in the Kathmandu Valley (16.2:1). \n(vi)  The  percentage  of  trained  teachers  has  increased  rapidly,  from  15%  of  all \nteachers in 2001 to 59.9% in 2006. \n(vii)  There is no information on learning achievement. A grade 5 national assessment \nconducted in 2003 showed improvements in learning achievement, but this data \nhas not yet been brought up to date. \n \n17.  The midterm review recognized the progress of EFA in increased participation, including \nthat of girls, the number of trained teachers, and the grade 5 survival rate. It also acknowledged \nEFA's contribution to keeping the school system operating during the insurgency period. The \nschool system has demonstrated the robustness of service, even as the country has emerged \nfrom years of conflict. This is also despite the changing political situation and confusion caused \nby  2  years  of  uncertainty  regarding  the  direction  of  fundamental  changes  in  the  political \nenvironment. EFA as a national movement has supported the system in meeting the immediate \nneeds in education during this difficult period. \n  \n18.  The midterm review findings also outlined the following challenges. \n(i)  Access to education has increased but in some areas this has been at the \nexpense of quality of service delivery and efficiency. For instance, an increasing \ngross enrolment rate has caused crowding of schools and burdens on teachers, \nwho could then not teach adequately. A relative decline in service delivery in turn \nresulted in an increased drop-out rate at grade 1.  \n(ii)  As completion and transition rates increase, there is a risk of widening gaps \nbetween  the  socially  disadvantaged  groups  and  those  in  poor  and  remote \ndistricts, and the rest of the country.  \n(iii)  The correlation between certain inputs and outcomes needs to be strengthened \nfurther. For instance, an increase in the number of ECD centers is not sufficiently \nreflected in an increase in grade 1 students with ECD experience, nor in a better \nsurvival rate of such students at grade 1.  \n(iv)  Learning achievement is a core EFA performance indicator to measure quality. \nHowever, a reliable and standardized learning achievement test is yet to be \ndeveloped in Nepal. \n \n19.  The above-mentioned issues provide some key lessons for a review of policy, strategy, \nand prioritization of resources in education under the future SSR: (i) how to meet public demand \nfor education by increasing access to basic and primary education and at the same time \nimproving quality of service delivery and internal efficiency; (ii) how to ensure social inclusion \nwhile maintaining a broader national target for education; and (iii) how to develop evidence-\nbased planning and management at all levels, based on a clear accountability mechanism that \nincludes the development of sound performance indicators to measure quality and education \noutcomes.  \n ", "6 \n \n \n2.  Education For All Implementation Strategies and Program Management  \n20.  The  midterm  review  concluded  that  EFA\u2019s  core  implementation  strategies  of \ndecentralization, inclusion, and capacity building remain relevant. However, implementation of \nthese strategies faced the following constraints.  \n(i)  Governance structures could not perform as envisaged because of the unstable \nsocial and political situation. Decentralization has been hampered by disruption, \ninadequate institutional capacity, ineffective communication, and the absence of \nelected members. \n(ii)  Monitoring  and  supervision  at  district  and  school  levels  have  been  heavily \nconstrained by the effects of the conflict.  \n(iii)  Local stakeholders faced difficulties in planning, implementing, monitoring, and \nreporting on EFA activities. As a result, differences in outcomes persist between \nand within districts.  \n \n21.  The midterm review raised concern over the appropriate deployment and redeployment \nof teachers. Teacher allocations should be based on clearer criteria on priorities and needs, so \nthat discrepancies in student\u2013teacher ratios can be reduced. A clear plan on how to reduce the \nteacher disparities and student\u2013teacher ratio is needed.  \n \n22.  A financial management review was conducted by the World Bank in conjunction with \nthe midterm review. It concluded that the budgeting, accounting, and reporting procedures \nelaborated in the financial monitoring report (FMR) provide assurance that EFA complies with \nfinancial management requirements in an acceptable manner. However, there are financing \nissues in that disbursements to districts and schools (i) are often late, (ii) are sometimes in \ninappropriate  amounts,  (iii)  sometimes  lack  clarification  on  how  the  amount  has  been \ndetermined, and (iv) may lack clear guidelines on how the money should be spent.  \n \n23.  At  the  process  level,  EFA  has  resulted  in  a  number  of  achievements,  and  has \ndemonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of donor harmonization. The JFA has helped \nharmonize  resources  and  develop  a  culture  of  partnership,  and  has  also  contributed  to \nstrengthening in-country capacity through greater reliance on country systems. Further, the \ndonor harmonization process developed by the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) in \neducation has been a model for progress in the country. \n \n24.  The achievement of EFA is noteworthy for developing a rolling-plan process for the ASIP \nto reflect the ground realities and make strategic choices for program implementation. ASIP has \nalso encouraged the schools and districts to implement their prioritized programs based on \nstrategic interventions through school improvement plans (SIPs) and district education plans \n(DEPs). However, the mechanism where SIPs feed into village education plans, DEPs, and the \nASIP has scope for improvement. Planning continues to be largely a top-down process with \nincremental  budgeting  and  no  clear  prioritization  for  districts  or  activities  in  need  of  more \nresources.  \n \n3.  The Education For All Midterm Review Recommendations and Follow-up \n25.  The midterm review recognized that while systemic issues need to be addressed, EFA \nalso needs to respond to the immediate basic needs of the education system\u2014the provision of \nteachers, classrooms, and textbooks. The midterm review recommended that the Department of \n ", "7 \n \nEducation (DOE) clearly prioritize and target EFA resource allocations, especially to the most \nneeded areas. It also recommended the development of a short- to medium-term plan for more \nequitable teacher deployment. The midterm review agreed on the following priorities for the \nremaining EFA implementation period: (i) equitable provision of teachers, classrooms, and \ntextbooks; (ii) decentralization to support schools, including funding for community-managed \nschools  and  capacity  development  of  school  management  committees  (SMCs);  (iii)  quality \nimprovement to develop stronger indicators to measure quality, and monitor and redefine the \nmedium of instruction; (iv) inclusion strategies to reach unserviced and underserviced learners; \nand (v) improvement of management, including accountability, planning, implementation, and \nmonitoring. These priorities will be reflected in the ASIP for FY2008.    \n \n26.  Financial Management. DOE presented a short-term action plan to improve financial \nmanagement in order to address the following concerns raised by the JFA partners based on \nthe FMR: (i) delays in funds release to district offices; (ii) delays in submission of FMRs; (iii) the \nquality of school audits, and (iv) compliance with social audits. The midterm review agreed that \na committee will be set up to periodically monitor the implementation of the action plan. A \nperformance audit is being conducted by the auditor general, focusing on the management of \nscholarships and SIPs. The midterm review agreed that the incentive schemes will be reviewed \nbased on the results of the performance audit.               \n \n27.  The midterm review recommended that systemic issues\u2014such as quality, governance, \naccountability, and finance\u2014discussed during the meetings, as well as by the earlier review \nmissions, will be addressed by the thematic working groups under the SSR core document \nwriting team. The working groups were asked to refer to the midterm review recommendations \nand incorporate them in their respective thematic work. \n \nB.  Status of Second Tranche Release Conditions of Subprogram I \n \n28.  The second tranche of EFA subprogram I has three conditions. These relate to (i) the \nperformance of program implementation in FY2007 in relation to the ASIP FY2007; (ii) the \npreparation of ASIP FY2009 by MOES and its endorsement by the JFA partners, including ADB; \nand  (iii)  the  preparation  by  MOES  of  an  action  plan  with  resource  allocation  on  the \nimplementation of the recommendations of the EFA midterm review. A draft ASIP FY2009 and \nthe  status  report  for  FY2007,  including  progress  of  implementation  of  the  midterm  review \nrecommendations, are expected to be presented and discussed in the annual EFA review \nmeeting in about May 2008. Therefore, the second tranche release timing is expected to be \naround June 2008, after all conditions have been met.     \n \nV.  THE SCHOOL SECTOR REFORM \n \nA.  Status of the Draft School Sector Reform Core Document \n  \n29.  The  Government  has  prepared  a  draft  SSR  core  document  which  will  guide  the \npreparation and the transition from the current subsector approach, with education financed by \nprograms such as the EFA and the Secondary Education Support Project, to an integrated SSR. \nThe final core document will guide the implementation of an SSR program expected to start in \nFY2010. It will serve as a policy and planning guide for gradual introduction of the grade 1\u201312 \nintegrated  system.  It  will  clarify  Government  commitments  with  respect  to  the  provision, \npromotion,  and  appraisal  of  educational  services  within  the  framework  of  the  grade  1\u201312 \nsystem.  Major  strategies  relating  to  standards  of  services  and  performance\u2014such  as \nmanagement, financing, legal functions, and the regulatory framework\u2014will be detailed. The \n ", "8 \n \nfinal core document will describe operational procedures for delivering school education of an \nacceptable quality in partnership with the community and civil society. It will contain details of \nprograms, the financing framework, and implementation. To write the core document, MOES \nmobilized  a  team  composed  of  thematic  groups  related  to  governance  and  management, \nquality, financing, social inclusion, structure, monitoring, and technical education and vocational \ntraining (TEVT).  \n \n30.  The draft core document provides an overview of policy intents and strategic options for \nan integrated school system. It provides the rationale for extending basic education to grades 1\u2013\n8,  and  secondary  education  to  grades  9\u201312.  It  also  takes  a  holistic  approach  to  school \neducation by integrating ECD, formal education, alternative education, and TEVT. The core \ndocument details the technical, managerial, regulatory, and financial issues, and the challenges \ninvolved in developing an integrated education system. The draft core document contains a well \narticulated and clear vision for SSR. It provides a solid basis for further elaboration of the reform \nprocess. \n \n31.  The core document acknowledges the achievements of EFA and the national movement \nthat it has created. SSR is viewed as a combination of affirmative actions and policy changes \naimed at attaining the EFA goals by 2015. At the same time, SSR builds upon lessons learned \nfrom EFA and attempts to address systemic issues that impede the progress of the education \nsystem. As such, the core document envisages a departure from the current program to a \nsector reform that is more responsive to the reality and needs of the school system. It envisages \na school system that is needs-based, flexible, and autonomous. It intends to provide multiple \neducational choices to schools and communities with regard to learning content, medium of \ninstruction, learning materials, and delivery methods. It envisages a contractual model between \ncentral  and  local  government  bodies  and  the  schools,  wherein  government  bodies  will  be \nresponsible for providing minimum enabling conditions for learning, in exchange for which \nschools will be responsible for achieving an agreed standard for service delivery, learning \nachievements, and outcomes. The backbone of such a system is (i) a clear set of norms and \nstandards; and (ii) an accountability mechanism that will define the roles, obligations, functions, \nand level of responsibilities at each institutional level.  \n \n32.  Accountability is linked to quality improvement and assurance. Strategies to improve the \nquality and relevance of education have been strengthened. A prerequisite is the setting of \nnorms and standards for quality improvement and assurance at all levels. Quality control is to \nbe assured through the mechanism of an independent monitoring body accountable to the \ninterministerial education policy committee (EPC). Quality is also to be measured by learning \noutcomes.  National  and  decentralized  public  school  examinations,  as  well  as  national \nassessment  of  learning  achievement  at  grades  5,  8,  and  10,  are  to  be  conducted,  and \ncontinuous student assessment will be introduced. The curriculum will be revised to make it \nmore competency-based. Teachers\u2019 minimum qualifications will be redefined according to the \nrestructuring  of  grades  1\u20138  and  grades  9\u201312.  Guidelines  for  teacher  management  and \ndevelopment will be prepared. Strategies to improve the relevance of education to local needs \ninclude multigrade teaching and the development and teaching of local content curriculum.  \n \n33.  In accordance with the interim constitution, the core document guarantees free basic \neducation  to  all  children  and  encourages  local  governments  to  make  basic  education \ncompulsory. Responsibilities for assuring equity of access and social inclusion will be shared \nbetween levels of government. A range of affirmative actions to support education for girls and \ndisadvantaged groups has been defined. The core document proposes multiple options for \n ", "9 \n \nschool financing, including block grants, performance-based grants, and formula-based school \ngrants.       \n \nB.  The Core Document Challenges \n \n34.  The core document preparation comes after (i) a thorough process of thematic group \nworks; (ii) a series of central, regional, district, and community-level stakeholder consultations; \nand (iii) periodic review and endorsement of the process by the EPC. Stakeholder consultation \nentails a lengthy process of consensus building among stakeholders with differing backgrounds \nand interests. Therefore the core document at this stage accommodates the views of various \nstakeholders and suggests multiple options for strategies and operational procedures. With the \npolitical uncertainties, the core document also remains cautious in some policy areas which may \nbe directly influenced by future political and governance structures. As a result, further decisions \nare required and inconsistencies need to be resolved in the draft core document. However, the \nGovernment  vision  and  long-term  goal  for  SSR  is  clear  and  firm.  Consensus  among \nstakeholders  around  basic  principles  of  the  reform  is  strong.  The  challenge  is  to  build \nconsensus and deepen analysis on how to achieve SSR goals in a realistic and sustainable \nmanner. The major tasks and challenges will be (i) prioritization of the many areas of suggested \npolicy reforms; (ii) adjustment and streamlining of the multiple strategic options; and (iii) policy \ndecisions on phased and focused reform planning and process, including securing adequate \nfinancial resources. \n \n35.  Some policy directions will be subject to the outcomes of the political process, the \nensuing revised government structure, and the degree of decentralization. These policies are \n(i) education  governance,  including  the  roles  and  mandates  of  local  government  bodies, \ncommunities,  and  schools;  (ii)  the  envisaged  cost-sharing  responsibilities  in  secondary \neducation versus the policy of free secondary education as stated in the interim constitution; \n(iii) the roles and mandates of private education; and (iv) budget scenarios for the expansion to \na grade 1\u20138 system and eventually an integrated grade 1\u201312 school system. Other key areas in \nthe core document can be further analyzed and detailed without the need for the political \nprocess to be finalized. These include (i) finding an appropriate balance between the goals of \nimproving access to, and quality of, education; (ii) establishing suitable incentive, accountability, \nand performance monitoring systems at all levels (central, district, and SMC); (iii) determining \nthe most appropriate forms of affirmative action to enhance social inclusion; and (iv) determining \nan appropriate rationale and strategy for TEVT through formal and nonformal means, including \nthe possibility of adding a vocational stream in school education. These issues are described \nbelow. \n \n36.  Improving Education Quality. The core document rightfully stresses the importance of \nimproving the quality of education by modernizing pedagogy, curriculum, teacher skills, learning \nmaterials, assessment, and professional development of teachers and head teachers. Further \nanalysis  will  need  to  clarify  the  envisaged  balance  between  quantitative  inputs,  such  as \nadditional classrooms and teachers needed for grade 1\u20138 basic education, and inputs which are \nmore  directly  related  to  quality  improvement.  Increased  public  demand  for  education  will \ncontinue pressuring the Government to expand access to grade 1\u20138 basic education. At the \nsame time, there will be higher expectations for quality and performance of public schools. SSR \nwill need to ensure that achieving quantitative access targets will not undermine quality targets. \n \n37.  Incentives  and  Accountability.  International  and  regional  experience  shows  that \nproviding more teachers, classrooms, and textbooks does not necessarily lead to better-quality \n ", "10 \n \neducation. While additional inputs are necessary, they are not all that is needed to improve \nquality. The key ingredient stimulating quality is an appropriate system of accountability and \nincentives that motivates students, teachers, and schools to perform well. The core document \nproposes to improve educational quality by establishing a common threshold and minimum \nenabling  conditions,  linked  to  quantitative  inputs,  as  a  guide  for  raising  school  standards. \nSimultaneously, incentives for students and teachers are proposed. Further details on how the \nproposed incentives are expected to contribute to improving the quality of education are to be \ndeveloped.  For  instance,  the  correlation  between  the  incentives  given  to  teachers,  head \nteachers, and SMCs, and the expected increase in the level of school performance, needs to be \nclarified.     \n \n38.  More accountability will lead to better quality only if the districts and SMCs are provided \nwith adequate resources and incentives for the stakeholders to fulfill their obligations, e.g., \nthrough  the  implementation  of  SIPs.  Furthermore,  apart  from  providing  positive  incentives, \nschool and educational performance must be monitored more carefully in order to detect and \nact upon unsatisfactory fulfillment of obligations. \n \n39.  Social Inclusion. Social inclusion remains a key policy reform area. The core document \nemphasizes the need to improve the access to education by girls and disadvantaged groups \nsuch as dalit, madhesis,7 and mountain communities. Advanced policy and strategy options and \na range of actions, including inclusive education and affirmative actions, have been included. \nThe core document would benefit from further analysis of the implementation progress of, and \nlessons learned from, the current EFA program in these areas. Policies designed to enhance \nsocial inclusion should be consistent with those designed to raise the quality of education. For \ninstance,  affirmative  actions  for  the  recruitment  of  female  teachers  and  those  from \ndisadvantaged groups are to be carefully planned without compromising defined standards for \nteacher qualification.   \n \n40.  Technical  Education  and  Vocational  Training.  Regional  experience  shows  that \npositive arguments and positive rates of return for spending on formal TEVT can be found in \nstrong economies. In weaker economies, nonformal skills centers can have a much higher rate \nof return than formal vocational streams in secondary education. The feasibility of continuing \ncostly investments in formal TEVT should be carefully considered in order to minimize risks that \nsuch investments will undermine investments in general education. Cost-sharing is necessary. \nThe core document proposes continuation of the current centrally driven TEVT programs, and \nthe addition of vocational streams in secondary education from grade 9 onwards. The proposed \ndelegation of authority of TEVT to local levels and cost sharing, including the feasibility of \npublic-private  partnership,  will  need  careful  consideration.  A  strong  economic  argument  is \nneeded for continuing with formal TEVT and adding the vocational stream in school education.     \n \nC.  The Core Document Preparation Process and Next Steps     \n \n41.  The Government has reviewed the core document, taking into consideration the initial \ncomments made by various stakeholders, including the development partners. The revised draft \ncore document has been endorsed by the EPC for wider dissemination and consultation down \nto the school level. It is expected that the draft core document will be forwarded to the National \nPlanning Commission and to the Ministry of Finance for approval in early 2008. Another round \nof consultation meetings may be organized with the development partners in 2008, followed by \none or more joint appraisal missions in 2008\u20132009. It is expected that the SSR policy, program, \n                                                 \n7 Traditional inhabitants of the lowlands (Terai). \n ", "11 \n \nand financing framework will be broadly accepted and adequately financed by the start of \nFY2010. The Government is committed to making the required policy decisions in a timely \nmanner so that the legislative, governance, and financing structure can be revised under a \ngrade 1\u201312 integrated system.  \n \n42.  Preparation of a successful reform program is a complex and lengthy process that \nrequires several important steps. Firstly, the Government is undertaking broad stakeholder \nconsultations  at  all  levels,  with  the  aim  of  analyzing  the  demand  for  SSR,  promoting \nparticipation, and building consensus among diversified interests. These consultations involve \ncentral agencies, district and municipality government stakeholders, village and community \nstakeholders, SMCs, parents, political parties, teachers\u2019 unions, women and dalit associations, \nand other civil society groups. Secondly, the Government intends to undertake a model-building \nexercise of grade 1\u20138 basic education in selected districts to draw lessons in key suggested \npolicy reform areas. Thirdly, the core document approval process should go through a high-\nlevel, single policy coordination, review, and approval mechanism. This mechanism has already \nbeen established through the interministerial EPC. Finally, the Government is undertaking an \nearly identification of capacity-development requirements for system readiness to embark on the \nreform.    \n \n43.  The  Government  has  prepared  an  initial  SSR  transitional  plan  that  sets  immediate \n(2007), medium-term (2010), and long-term (2015\u20132016) outcomes and outputs for the key \npolicy  reform  areas  for  SSR,  which  are  (i)  governance  and  management,  (ii)  quality  of \neducation,  (iii) equity  of  access  and  social  inclusion,  and  (iv)  education  financing.  It  is \nunderstood  that  the  transitional  plan  will  be  revised  along  with  the  revision  of  the  core \ndocument. \n \n44.  Planned  actions  under  the  transitional  plan  between  2007  and  2010  include  the \npreparation of regulatory frameworks, policy guidelines, norms and standards, and operational \nprocedures. It also includes a model-building of the extension of basic education from grades 1\u2013\n5 to grades 1\u20138 in the selected districts. Furthermore, stakeholders\u2019 capacity-development \nrequirements  at  all  levels  are  to  be  identified,  and  capacity  development  initiated.  The \ntransitional plan between 2010 and 2015 focuses on gradually introducing SSR in key reform \nareas. Among other things, the restructured grade 1\u20138 basic education system will be gradually \nexpanded within an overall grade 1\u201312 framework regularized under a single Education Act. \nFurthermore, shared responsibility among governments, parents, and SMCs to provide and \nensure quality education will be established and enforced by a national policy on accountability. \n \n45.  Further in-depth analysis of the legal, institutional, technical, and financial implications of \nthe suggested policy and strategic options, including a cost-effectiveness analysis, will need to \nbe undertaken. This will help in further refining the rationale of the preferred options and in the \nplanning of the phased reform and restructuring process.  \n \n46.  ADB  Assistance  for  the  Core  Document  Preparation.  The  capacity-development \ngrant associated with ESP subprogram I supports the core document thematic group works, the \nconsultation workshops, teacher workshops, school and teacher mapping, and the capacity \ndevelopment of MOES policy functions. ESP subprogram II will focus on supporting the model-\nbuilding exercise and broader capacity development for system readiness. In-depth analysis of \npolicy options will be supported partly by the capacity-development grant and partly by technical \n ", "12 \n \nassistance for the preparation of ESP subprogram III,8 in close harmonization with technical \nassistance from other education development partners.     \n \nVI.  THE PROPOSED SUBPROGRAM II \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n47.  The expected overall impact of the ESP cluster program, including the ESP subprogram \nII,  is  enhanced  educational  attainment  and  livelihood  for  all  children,  particularly  girls  and \ndisadvantaged groups. The expected outcome of ESP subprogram II is a broadly accepted and \nadequately financed SSR policy, program, and financing framework. A program policy matrix \nand a development policy letter for ESP subprogram II are in Appendix 3.  \n   \nB.  Outputs \n \n48.  The expected outputs of the ESP subprogram II are (i) a revised SSR core document, \nwith an analysis of preferred policy options, and a program and financing framework; and (ii) the \ncapacity of stakeholders developed at various levels throughout the country to support school \nsector  reform.  It  is  expected  that  lessons  learned  and  experiences  gained  from  the \nimplementation of the grade 1\u20138 basic education system in the model-building districts and \nschools will be adequately reflected in the SSR core document. \n \n49.  Activities under the transitional plan between 2007 and 2010 include the preparation of \nguidelines and procedures, a model-building exercise and the initiation of capacity development \nfor SSR readiness. The SSR transitional activities will complement and extend the scope of the \nongoing EFA. Especially, it will prepare for a smooth transition from the current subsector \napproach to the integrated 1\u201312 school sector approach. As such, it will follow the National Plan \nof Action for EFA 2015,9 which sets a long-term vision to extend basic education to grade 8 and \nto develop a holistic 1\u201312 school system. \n \n50.  Within  the  overall  EFA  vision  and  objectives,  ESP  subprogram  II  will  support  the \ntransitional plan (2007\u20132010) between 2008 and 2011 jointly with all other EFA development \npartners, particularly the model-building exercise and transition to grade 1\u20138 basic education in \nthe selected districts. With the contribution of the European Commission as a new development \npartner, the ESP subprogram II will also support capacity development to strengthen the school \nsystem\u2019s readiness to embark on the SSR. \n \n1.  The Model-Building Exercise    \n51.   The model building will specifically focus on identifying locally relevant and effective \nways of making the transition to (i) a grade 1\u20138 structure through surveys, planning, and \nconsultation  with  stakeholders;  and  (ii)  integrated  functions  for  school-based  management, \nfinancing, and quality improvement. Rasuwa district from the mountains, Dadeldhura district \nfrom the hills, and Kapilvastu district from the Terai have been selected as model-building \ndistricts. The model-building districts were selected based on ethnic composition, geographic \ndiversity, and preparedness to embark on advanced implementation of the grade 1\u20138 reform. \nDistrict implementation teams have been formed to conduct self-assessment, identify areas for \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2007.

It will not be feasible to restructure and expand all of the existing schools to grade 1\u20138 in \none attempt as some schools may need upgrading, some may need to be downsized, and \nothers may need to be merged. A transitional plan for smooth integration will require a demand \nanalysis with adequate consideration of the needs and readiness of the community. The model-\nbuilding exercise will implement visioning and consultative processes in the model-building \ndistricts to gather community reflections on the integrated system. It will assess the demand and \nimplications of expanding primary level to grade 8. Several models of school structure will be \ntested,  such  as  grades  1\u20133,  grades  1\u20135,  and  grades  1\u20138.  In  communities  with  smaller \npopulations, multigrade teaching schools will be considered. The model-building exercise will \nalso improve enabling conditions for grade 1\u20138 basic education schools through facility upgrade \nto accommodate grades 6\u20138, together with the provision of teaching learning materials.   \n \n53.  Teacher  management\u2014such  as  employment,  deployment,  transfer,  and  teacher \ndevelopment\u2014remains the most critical and complex aspect of education in Nepal. An acute \nshortage of teachers in some districts and surplus in others is recognized. The model building \nwill support the provision of temporary teacher grants to address the short supply of teachers in \nschools  in  the  model-building  districts.  The  model  building  will  assess  the  gaps  and \nopportunities  in  current  teacher  management  and  will  develop  a  plan  for  efficient  teacher \nmanagement in an integrated school system. The following key areas of teacher management \nwill be explored during the model building: (i) teacher qualification, training, and deployment; (ii) \nthe role of the teacher service commission, district education offices, and SMCs; and (iii) other \nservice conditions that are pertinent to an integrated school system. \n \n54.  SIPs are the most commonly used planning tool at the school and community level. \nHowever,  for  SIPs  to  be  a  more  effective  tool  for  school  improvement  they  must  be \ncomplemented  by  efforts  to  develop  capacity  at  the  community  level  in  planning  and \nmanagement  for  school  improvement.  In  order  to  embark  upon  SSR,  it  is  imperative  that \nplanning tools and strategies are relevant and that stakeholders are competent enough to use \nthem. Model building will work on refining existing planning tools and processes. It will develop \ncapacity at the local level to ensure that the planning process is participatory, reflects the needs \nof disadvantaged groups, and that it will also be a part of the district and national-level planning \nand budgeting process. It will seek a better correlation between planning tools and resource \nallocation, enabling the school and community to achieve quality improvement targets. \n \n2.  Capacity Development \n55.  Capacity development is an essential feature of the SSR process. Capacity development \nunder SSR is distinguished at three levels (Figure 2): \n(i)  The SSR preparation supported under the ESP subprogram II is a capacity-\ndevelopment exercise designed to enhance the capacity and understanding of \ncentral  and  local  government  agencies  to  prepare  and  implement  the \ncountrywide restructuring and reform of the school system. It includes thematic \nworks, broad stakeholder consultations, a model-building exercise in selected \ndistricts,  and  use  of  a  single  streamlined  policy  coordination,  review,  and \napproval mechanism of the SSR. \n(ii)  The  SSR  implementation  itself  aims  at  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the \neducation system to better deliver the intended educational outcomes. \n ", "14 \n \n(iii)  In the process, capacity of the different organizations involved in the school \nsector at all levels (central, subnational, and school level) should be strengthened \nso  that  these  organizations  will  be  able  to  perform  their  responsibilities \nadequately. These organizational capacity-development activities will contribute \nto better SSR preparation and implementation through increased capacity of the \norganizations involved.  \n \nFigure 2: Capacity Development\nFY2008  FY2009  FY2010 FY2011 FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 \nSSR preparation \nSSR implementation\nOngoing organizational capacity development\nSSR = school sector reform. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n56.  MOES is developing a broad capacity-development plan as part of the transitional plan. \nWhile support for capacity development for overall system preparedness is embedded in the \nESP  cluster,  the  MOES  capacity-development  plan  will  focus  on  organizational  capacity \ndevelopment at the central, subnational, local, and school levels. Capacity-development needs \nand activities will be refined, along with revision of the SSR core document and the transitional \nplan.  The  capacity-development  plan  will  also  define  the  implementation  and  monitoring \nmechanism at each organizational level. \n    \n57.  The ESP subprogram II will develop the capacity of policy-making bodies within local \ngovernments and SMCs at the school level to set appropriate policies that apply within their \njurisdiction and that are consistent with central policies and guidelines. Local governments will \nreceive orientation and training on national educational policy and their role in educational \ngovernance.   \n \n58.  The capacity of local governments to implement programs and policies will also be \nstrengthened. Systems for planning, monitoring, and administration of schools and alternative \neducation providers will be optimized to support SSR goals and strategic objectives. To support \nlocal  planning  and  monitoring,  documentation  and  research  centers  will  be  created  within \nindividual agencies of the local government.  \n \n59.  In  technical  areas,  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  developing  capacity  for  different \nfunctions, such as curriculum development, assessment, student evaluation, continuous teacher \nsupport  and  development,  standard  setting,  and  accreditation.  To  enhance  management \ncapacity, activities will focus on (i) strengthening the education management information system \ndatabase; (ii) establishing systems for performance audits and social audits; and (iii) preparing \nplanning tools such as ASIPs, DEPs, and SIPs.      \n \n60.  Schools are the central point for educational service delivery. They will be developed to \nenable  them  to  act  as  self-governing  independent  entities,  and  individual  schools  will  be \nprovided  with  technical  support  to  develop  capacity  for  self-management  and  governance. \nCritical  areas  of  capacity  development  envisaged  at  the  school  level  include  (i)  teacher \n ", "15 \n \nmobilization; (ii) teacher, curriculum, and leadership development; (iii) resource mobilization; (iv) \nreporting  and  communication  with  parents;  (v)  instructional  planning;  (vi)  collaboration  and \nnetworking; (vii) action research; and (viii) social auditing. Major focus for capacity-development \nactivities will be given to low-performing schools and those in disadvantaged areas.  \n \nC.  Financing Plan  \n  \n61.  Costs of the early implementation of the SSR in the three model-building districts, as well \nas overall capacity development, are estimated at approximately $16 million. These include (i) \ncosts associated with the development of new learning materials, (ii) additional teacher salaries \nand training, (iii) improvement of the school environment, (iv) enhancement of quality and social \ninclusion,  (v)  additional  SIP  grants  and  scholarships,  (vi)  capacity-development  activities  for \noverall system preparedness, and (vii) monitoring of management and administrative costs. The \nrecurrent costs for operating the school system during the transition phase, which include regular \nteacher salaries in the concerned districts and salary of staff at the central and district level \ninvolved in the SSR transitional plan, have not been incorporated into this cost estimate as they \nwill be borne by the Government. \n \n62.  The Government has requested a program grant of $8 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to contribute to the SSR transitional plan. In parallel with the ADB grant, as part of the \nEuropean Commission contribution to the school sector, the European Commission will provide a \nprogram grant of \u20ac6 million to support organizational capacity-development activities, both within \nkey sector institutions in the country and with major stakeholders and communities. All EFA \ndevelopment partners have agreed to jointly finance the Program within the existing EFA JFA.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n63.  Program Management. MOES is the Executing Agency and DOE is the Implementing \nAgency. A central-level coordination committee has been established at MOES to effectively \ncoordinate and monitor SSR capacity-development activities implemented by various MOES line \nagencies,  and  report  to  EPC  on  SSR  policy  implementation  initiatives.  The  central-level \ncoordination committee is chaired by the joint secretary of the MOES Planning Division and \ncomprises  representatives  from  MOES,  DOE,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  the  National \nPlanning Commission and other education line agencies. Similarly, a regional implementation \nteam in each region and a district implementation team in the three model-building districts will be \nestablished. The technical secretariat at MOES will provide technical support to model-building \ndistricts. The interministerial EPC, chaired by the Minister of Education and Sports, will approve \nSSR policy options and the core document based on the inputs provided by the central-level \ncoordination committee.  \n \n64.  Implementation Period. The ESP subprogram II will be implemented over 4 years from \nJanuary 2008 to December 2011. It is expected that program completion will be in December \n2011 and the grant closing date will be June 2012. \n \n65.  Tranching and Monitoring. The grant will be released in a single tranche. The tranche \nwill be released to the foreign exchange account (FEA) held by MOES at the Nepal Rastra Bank, \nand established under the EFA\u2019s JFA upon fulfilling all tranche release conditions. Funds will be \nreleased from the FEA to the government consolidated fund based on submission of actual \nexpenditures by MOES and approval by MOF.  \n \n ", "16 \n \n66.  The SSR transitional plan and its detailed activities under ESP subprogram II will be jointly \nappraised by the Government and all development partners. This transitional plan will incorporate \n(i) activities of model-building districts transforming into a grade 1\u20138 basic education system, and \n(ii) activities for capacity development for the school sector as a whole. Activities with costs, which \naddress both immediate priorities as well as preparing for longer-term reforms, will be provided for \neach year. Concrete and measurable indicators will be included. Monitoring of progress on the \ntransitional plan will be integrated into the ongoing ASIP and AWPB. \n \n67.  Disbursement, Procurement, and Recruitment. The proceeds of the grant will be \ndisbursed to MOF as the recipient in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.10 The grant proceeds \nwill be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items (Appendix 4) and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. No supporting import documentation \nwill be required if, during each year that grant proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value \nof  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports \nfinanced under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith this formula with its withdrawal request. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of grant \nproceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. Procurement of eligible \nitems and recruitment of consultants will be on the basis of standard Government procurement \nand  recruitment  practices  acceptable  to  ADB  for  procurement  and  recruitment  by  the \nGovernment or its representatives. \n \n68.  Counterpart Funds. The local currency funds generated from the proceeds of the \nprogram  grant  will  be  used  by  the  Government  to  supplement  the  cost  associated  with \nimplementation of the SSR transitional plan. \n \n69.  Fund Flow Mechanism. The EFA\u2019s JFA will be amended to incorporate SSR transitional \nactivities under ESP subprogram II. The amended JFA will provide details of (i) the responsibilities \nof  the  Government  of  Nepal  and  of  participating  development  partners;  (ii)  the  funding \nmechanism;  (iii)  fiduciary  requirements,  including  procurement,  reporting,  monitoring,  and \nauditing; and (iv) other administrative requirements. An additional budget head account to the \nexisting 10 EFA budget head accounts will be opened within the EFA JFA to channel funds for the \nSSR transitional activities. Reporting and monitoring of progress on SSR transitional activities will \nbe  fully  integrated  into  the  ongoing  ASIP  and  AWPB.  MOES  will  provide  an  annual  draft \nprocurement plan to the development partners for their review, and procurement monitoring \nreports will be provided in each trimester during program period. Procurement of works, goods, \nand services for the Program will follow procedures and regulations specified in the Government\u2019s \nProcurement Act 2007 and the Procurement Regulations 2007.  \n \n70.  The responsibility for implementing the program will rest with MOES and DOE. MOES will \nuse the Government\u2019s reporting system to submit the FMR to the pooled development partners \neach trimester. Replenishment of the funds from the FEA will be based on the timely and accurate \nsubmission of the FMR. The ESP subprogram II will be audited by the Office of the Auditor \nGeneral of Nepal in accordance with auditing standards. The audited statements will be provided \nto the partners within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year.  \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "17 \n \n71.  Program  funds  will  be  made  available  in  two  steps.  Firstly,  grant  proceeds  will  be \ndeposited in the FEA held by MOES in accordance with the respective provisions of grant \nagreements between the Government and the respective pooled development partners. While the \nfunds will be pooled, each pooling partners\u2019 accounts will be recorded, reconciled, and reflected \nseparately in the FMR. Under Government procedures, no direct payments can be made from the \nFEA. Secondly, funds will be transferred from the FEA to the Government\u2019s consolidated fund \nbased on submission of actual expenditures by MOES and approval by MOF. However, MOES \nwill transfer the funds from the FEA to the Government\u2019s consolidated fund only upon receipt of \nthe approval of FMR from the pooled development partners.  \n \nE.  Program Risks  \n \n72.  Nepal\u2019s ongoing political transition may delay some aspects of the reform process. \nStrategies related to some areas of education governance, financing, and structure may be \ndecided at a later stage. However, the model-building exercise, capacity-development activities \nand further preparation in key education reform areas of quality improvement and assurance, \nand social inclusion, do not require the political transition to be finalized, and hence will not be \naffected. Anticorruption measures under ESP subprogram II will follow the provisions under the \nEFA\u2019s JFA. In particular, EFA partners endorsed a financial management improvement action \nplan prepared by DOE. The EFA midterm review concluded that the budgeting, accounting, and \nreporting  procedures  under  the  JFA  comply  with  fiduciary  requirements  in  an  acceptable \nmanner. DOE is undertaking measures to (i) improve financial management pertinent to timely \ndisbursement  to  districts  and  schools  and  submission  of  the  FMR,  (ii)  simplify  and  clarify \nguidelines, and (iii) strengthen monitoring and coordination mechanisms at all levels. DOE\u2019s \naction plan for financial management improvement also comprises capacity development in \nsocial auditing and school auditing. Both ESP subprograms I and II have provisions to support \nsuch capacity development.    \n  \nF.  Compliance with Social Safeguard Policies \n    \n73.  ESP subprogram II will have a positive impact on the socially disadvantaged groups, as \nsocial  inclusion  is  a  key  theme  of  the  draft  core  document.  The  vulnerable  communities \ndevelopment framework developed under ESP subprogram I will remain relevant under ESP \nsubprogram II. Civil works will consist of additional classrooms to accommodate grades 6\u20138 in \nbasic education schools in the model-building districts. Approximately 200 classrooms will be \nconstructed.  The  Government  has  undertaken  an  initial  survey  of  land  requirements  to \nimplement the model-building exercise and has concluded that no land acquisition will take \nplace under the Program. No significant adverse environmental impacts are anticipated in this \nProgram.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n74.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the draft Grant Agreement: \n(i)  MOES and DOE will implement, manage, coordinate and monitor the Program in \naccordance  with  its  goals,  responsibilities,  funding  mechanism,  fiduciary \nrequirements, and other program management arrangements as set out in the \ndraft SSR core document and agreed in the EFA JFA; \n ", "18 \n \n(ii)  MOES will implement and manage the Program in accordance with the vulnerable \ncommunities development framework agreed upon between MOES and ADB;  \n(iii)  No activities under the Program will entail land acquisition or other resettlement \nactivities under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995);  \n(iv)  Throughout the program period, the budget share for education will remain at least \nat the level of FY2008, while all efforts will be made to increase the budget \nallocation; and  \n(v)  MOES will ensure compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations of \nNepal, as well as ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).  \n \nB.  Conditions for Grant Effectiveness  \n \n75.  The following are conditions for grant effectiveness:  \n(i)  the Government will have issued an executive order enabling MOES to restructure, \non a pilot basis, 1\u20138 basic education in Rasuwa District, Dadeldhura District, and \nKapilvastu District;    \n(ii)  all policy actions set forth in the policy matrix will have been complied with; and  \n(iii)  the amendments to the EFA JFA, required to use such EFA JFA for financing any \nSSR-related activities, shall have become effective.    \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n76.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  grant  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $8,000,000 to Nepal from the ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for \nthe  Education  Sector  Program  Cluster  (Subprogram  II),  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda  \nPresident \n20 December 2007 \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  19 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPERFORMANCE  DATA SOURCES/  ASSUMPTIONS \nDESIGN SUMMARY \nTARGETS/INDICATORS  REPORTING MECHANISMS  AND RISKS \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nEnhanced education  \u2022  Grade 5 school survival  \u2022 Living standards surveys  \u2022  Political and \nattainment and  rates, NER for lower     socioeconomic conditions \nlivelihoods,  secondary and  \u2022 DOE statistics   improve and remain \nparticularly for girls  secondary, school    stable \nand disadvantaged  leaving certificate pass  \u2022 EFA monitoring reports  \n\u2022  Economy continues to \ngroups   rates improved (by \ncreate jobs and require \n  gender, income level, \nmore educated \nand ethnic groups) by \nparticipants \n10% (from baseline in \n2007) by 2012    \u2022  Government commitment \nto education reform \n\u2022  EFA goals and \ncontinues to be firm \nperformance targets  \n\u2022  Donors will continue their \nsupport for the education \nsector \nRisk \n\u2022  Changes in policy \nenvironment that \ndiscourage further \nreforms \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nBroadly accepted and  \u2022  Revised SSR core  \u2022  Joint appraisal missions  \u2022  Government allocates \nadequately financed  document successfully  sufficient recurrent budget \n\u2022  MOES reports \nschool sector reform  appraised and finalized  to education \npolicy, program, and  for implementation \n\u2022  MOES is effective in \nfinancing framework  throughout the country \nleading and coordinating \n  by FY2010 \nthe development of the \n \nschool system \n \n  \u2022  Government commitment \n  to grade 1\u201312 school \n  sector continues, \n  government structure at \n  various levels clarified \n  and agreed, and reflected \n  in the SSR core document \n  accordingly \n \n  \u2022  Donors will continue their \n  support for the education \n  sector \n \nRisks \n \n  \u2022  Political situation does not \n  improve \n \n\u2022  Lack of funding \n \n  \u2022  Cost-sharing not agreed \n  between various levels \n  and stakeholders \n ", "20  Appendix 1 \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
