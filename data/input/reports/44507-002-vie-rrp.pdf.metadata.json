I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Public\u2013Private Partnership Support Project.1 \n \n2.  The project2 will support the Government of Viet Nam\u2019s initiatives to develop bankable \nand commercially viable public\u2013private partnership (PPP) projects, and to promote a more \nconducive environment for PPP and utilize PPP as a catalyst for broader sector reforms. Under \nthe project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide funding for the establishment and \noperation of a project development facility (PDF) as a funding mechanism to support PPP \nproject preparation activities, which will include the preparation of prefeasibility studies, detailed \nfeasibility studies, and bid and contract documentation. The ADB loan will be used to fund the \nproposed PDF, with specific actions that will be linked to the project loan via specific assurances \nand precedent conditions for loan disbursement.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economic growth and demand for infrastructure. Viet Nam\u2019s impressive economic \ngrowth in 2002\u20132012 has brought about substantial progress and development opportunities as \nwell as challenges. Industrialization and urbanization rates, which are high even by Asian \nstandards,  are  driving  intense  demands  for  new  and  improved  infrastructure  and  related \nservices.  Infrastructure  investments,  comprising  about  10%  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  annual  gross \ndomestic product, is mostly either state-led or, to a lesser extent, through official development \nassistance (ODA).3 However, these investments are widely acknowledged as insufficient to \nmeet Viet Nam\u2019s huge infrastructure funding needs, which are estimated at $160 billion over the \nperiod 2013\u20132022. The unmet demand has serious consequences for the country\u2019s productivity \nand the efficiency of the economy, and in ensuring sustainable economic growth, reducing \npoverty, and meeting Millennium Development Goal targets. \n \n4.  Limited private sector investment in Viet Nam\u2019s infrastructure development. There \nis  a  growing  recognition  of  the  increasing  importance  of  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in \ndevelopment.  However,  for  an  economy  the  size  of  Viet  Nam's,  private  investment  in \ninfrastructure has been very limited.4 In this regard, promotion and leveraging of both domestic \nand foreign private sector investment in infrastructure would be best served through PPPs. PPP \nis also viewed as a means to improve efficiency and service delivery to citizens and gain access \nto new capital, expertise, and technology. The government\u2019s Socio-Economic Development \nPlan (SEDP), 2011\u20132015, clearly cites the importance of establishing policies to attract private \nsector investment in infrastructure by means of PPP in line with international best practice.5 The \nSEDP  also  cites  PPP  as  an  effective  mechanism  to  address  the  limited  state  budget  for \ninfrastructure projects and as a priority modality for private sector investment in infrastructure. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the concept note for the proposed loan 16 May 2011 and provided \nsmall-scale technical assistance. \n3  There is a concern about the possibility of reduced access to ODA as Viet Nam has become a middle-income \ncountry, and this concern strengthens the government\u2019s resolve to further engage in PPP. \n4  For further information on PPP issues in Viet Nam and a dialogue with the government on PPP, see Sector \nAssessment: Public\u2013Private Partnerships (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n5  This is also fundamentally supported in Viet Nam\u2019s new Socio-Economic Development Strategy for 2011\u20132020 \napproved by the 11th Party Congress in January 2011, which emphasizes the need to accelerate the reforms of \neconomic institutions, and to address infrastructure bottlenecks as two of the three \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d the country \nneeds to achieve in ensuring its continuing rapid socioeconomic development. ", "2 \nThis is echoed in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015, whereby PPP will remain an \nimportant policy priority in promoting inclusive economic growth as envisaged under ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2020.6 The development of PPP in Viet Nam will provide opportunities for private \nsector operations. \n \n5.  Need for an appropriate public\u2013private partnership framework. It is recognized that, \ndespite concerted efforts of not only ADB but also many other development partners to promote \nthe concept of PPP through numerous advocacy and training activities,7 very few actual PPP \ntransactions have occurred so far beyond the energy sector. This is an indication that the \nbusiness environment is not conducive for PPP, as it faces various constraints that make public \nsector officials unaware of the importance of PPP and the private sector less attracted to \nengage  in  such  partnerships.  This  is  exacerbated  by  the  lack  of  a  legal  and  regulatory \nframework conducive for PPP implementation, the lack of capacity to manage PPP processes \nand information, as well as the private sector\u2019s limited access to financial resources and project \nfinance skills. \n \n6.  Systemic issues. In the Viet Nam context, PPP faces systemic issues that need to be \naddressed. First, there are difficulties in creating bankable projects for PPP given uncertainties \nin the government commitment to address (i) the underlying issues of low tariffs and willingness-\nto-pay (particularly in the transport and water supply sectors), (ii) perceived risks of investing in \ninfrastructure projects, and (iii) lengthy government procedures. Second, there is the issue of \nthe absence of government viability gap funding to support PPP projects that have strong \neconomic returns but may not be commercially viable, as well as an absence of clarity on the \nother  forms  of  government  undertakings  such  as  guarantees,  making  land  available,  and \nenabling access to ODA grants to identify bankable projects. The third issue is the lack of a \n\u201clevel playing field,\u201d particularly with respect to concerns regarding bid transparency and state-\nowned  enterprise  access  to  state-directed  and/or  preferential  financing,  which  creates  a \n\u201ccrowding out\u201d effect for private firms. The fourth and last issue is the lack of availability of long-\nterm debt for private sector projects, particularly in the local currency. \n \n7.  Lack  of  adequate  cost  recovery. Uncertainties in the government commitment to \naddress the underlying issues of low tariffs (willingness-to-charge) and willingness-to-pay are \nprevalent, particularly in priority sectors such as transport, energy, and water supply. Low tariffs \nfor produced outputs results in inadequate cash flow to support the revenue stream needed by \ninvestors producing these outputs. Furthermore, the private sector is deterred by perceived risks \nof investing in infrastructure projects and lengthy government procedures.  \n \n8.  Support for projects that are commercially not viable but otherwise show strong \neconomic returns. Given the strong demand for infrastructure in Viet Nam and private sector \ninterest to invest, there is a need to explore financing options critical to securing bankable PPP \nprojects with potentially strong economic returns. However, this may not be commercially viable \nin the absence of clarity on various forms of government undertakings such as guarantees, \nviability gap funding, making land available, and enabling access to ODA grants to identify \nbankable projects. Filling in this gap is crucial to effective and successful PPP.  \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila; ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-\nTerm Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. Manila. \n7  The World Bank provided technical support for the establishment of a legal framework for PPP, the output of which \nwas decision 71 (regulation for pilot PPP projects) and decree 78 (regulation on build-operate-transfer, build-\ntransfer-operate, and Build-Transfer contracts). The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), \nthrough its Vietnam Competitiveness Initiative, has provided the layout for the PPP road map for the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment (MPI).  \n ", "3 \n9.  Lack of a \u201clevel playing field.\u201d While the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) is \ncommitted to ensuring that state-owned enterprises compete on a level playing field for PPP \nopportunities, there are still private sector concerns regarding bid transparency and state-owned \nenterprise access to state-directed and/or preferential financing, which creates the \u201ccrowding \nout\u201d effect for private firms. The government will need to demonstrate greater political will to \nprovide greater assurance to the private sector, and will need to continue its reform efforts and \nimproved corporate governance.  \n \n10.  Limited  domestic  financing  modalities  and  private  sector  access  to  financial \nresources. The financial sector in Viet Nam is relatively underdeveloped and unable to provide \nsufficient long-term capital needed by investors. Foreign banks are the most reliable source of \nmedium- to long-term lending. For foreign-denominated debt, lenders are looking for credit \nenhancements and guarantee mechanisms, e.g., through export credit agencies. With limited \nresources for domestic financial institutions to meet the infrastructure funding requirements, \nconcerted  reforms  are  needed  to  mobilize  domestic  resources  of  this  magnitude.  The \ngovernment  needs  to  facilitate  the  development  of  local  capital  markets  by  (i)  enabling \ninsurance firms and pension funds to finance infrastructure, (ii) deepening the bond market, (iii) \nestablishing credit rating, and (iv) establishing dedicated infrastructure funds.  \n \n11.  Institutional and capacity issues. Lack of government capacity to prepare quality \nfeasibility studies, carry out effective competitive tender processes, and effectively deal with \nprivate sector transactions are also constraining factors on effective PPP.  \n \n12.  Public\u2013private partnership legal framework still needs to be made operational. In \nNovember 2010, the government issued decision 71/2010, as issued by the prime minister, to \nenable piloting of solicited PPP transactions on a competitive basis and raise capital from \ndomestic and international sources without increasing public debt.8 Furthermore, in March 2012 \nthe  MPI  minister  issued  decision  392  that  established  a  PPP  office  in  the  MPI\u2019s  Public \nProcurement Agency, and in April 2012 decision 135 outlined the functions of the PPP office. \nHowever, detailed implementing guidelines under decision 71 are still lacking and the specifics \nof the relationship of the PPP office with the line ministries for PPP still need to be worked out.  \n \n13.  Need  for  effective  project  preparation  and  project  development  facility. Sound \nproject  preparation  is  the  key  requirement  to develop  bankable  PPP  projects  that  can  be \nbrought to the marketplace and to build investor confidence. Project preparation involves the \nfollowing activities: (i) prefeasibility studies to identify candidate PPP infrastructure projects; \n(ii) preparation  of  detailed  feasibility  studies,  technical  and  engineering  specifications, \nenvironmental and social impact assessment with management plans, financial analysis, risk \nassessment and mitigation, and assessment of the PPP legal framework; and (iii) bid and \ncontract documentation. The detailed project preparation process to be covered under activity \n(ii) and the bidding process stated in activity (iii) are aimed to help develop bankable structures \nthat will provide the necessary comfort to both the private sector as well as the prospective \nlenders  to  the  project  through  appropriate  risk  allocation.  Improvement  in  the  capacity  to \ndevelop  bankable  projects  is  also  important  to  increasing  the  pace  of  investment  in \ninfrastructure. To facilitate project development for PPPs, a PDF is required. The PDF would \n                                                \n8  Decision 71 is intended to apply to pilot projects over a 3- to 5-year period, at which time it is expected that they will \nbe replaced by a more comprehensive PPP Law to enable replication of a new model of PPP project formulation \nand contracting based on the current piloting initiative. Decision 71 is based on a long-term policy dialogue \nbetween the government and development partners and incorporates recommendations and comments of ADB, \nAFD, Japan International Cooperation Agency, KfW, Korea Eximbank, and the World Bank on several drafts of the \nregulations that were also supported by USAID. \n ", "4 \nprovide  the  sponsoring  government  agencies  with  the  funding  to  procure  the  necessary \nconsultancy and expert services for provision of the outlined project preparation activities.  \n \n14.  Lessons. From ADB experience, the key lessons learned to ensure successful PPPs \nare that there needs to be (i) government engagement on broad-based reforms and ensuring a \nlevel playing field for private sector participation; (ii) strong political commitment on the part of \nsenior government officials to promote and advance PPPs; (iii) strong institutional support for \nplanning and carrying out effective PPP project preparation, including a thorough value-for-\nmoney analysis;9 (iv) a streamlined procurement process and institutional capacity to implement \nthe  process;  (v) pooling  of  donor  resources  to  achieve  critical  mass  and  consistency  in \napproach; and (vi) sufficient financing support to include, but not be limited to, mechanisms for \ngovernment to provide multiyear commitments, creditworthy support, and prudent management \nof the fiscal obligations created by PPPs.10  \n \n15.  Public\u2013Private Partnership Support Project. The proposed project seeks to address \nthe  issue  of  creating  bankable  and  commercially  viable  PPP  projects,  while  continuing  to \nengage the government in a policy dialogue to address the PPP issues (para. 4\u201313). The \ngovernment will address these issues over time as it implements actual projects. Under the \nproposed  project,  ADB  will  use  the  project  loan  modality  to  fund  the  PDF  as  a  funding \nmechanism to support project preparation activities, with specific actions that will be linked to \nthe loan via specific assurances, and precedent conditions for loan disbursement.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The impact will be increased private sector investment in infrastructure. This will in turn \nimprove the efficiency and quality of infrastructure services and accelerate Viet Nam\u2019s economic \ngrowth.  The  outcome  will  be  an  improved  government  capacity  to  catalyze  PPPs  and \ninfrastructure investments.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n17.  The overall project design is fully in line with Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development \nStrategy 2011\u20132020, SEDP 2011\u20132015, and the government\u2019s infrastructure reform agenda. \nThe project will have two outputs, which are described in paras. 18\u201319 and illustrated in Figure \n1.  The  project\u2019s  activities  are  consistent  with  those  outlined  in  pillars  1\u20133  of  ADB\u2019s  PPP \noperational plan.11 \n \n18.  Output  1:  Institutional  mechanism  for  developing  bankable  public\u2013private \npartnership projects. The project will develop and prepare PPP pilot projects that are ready to \nbe bid out to test the limitations of the existing regulatory framework for PPP, and further fine-\ntune the framework. Following this, the project will support the development of a pipeline of \neconomically viable bankable projects. This will be made possible through the establishment of \nthe PDF that will fund the preparation of well-structured project transactions resulting in sound \nmodel  infrastructure  projects  that  can  be  replicated.  To  sustain  the  PDF,  mechanisms, \nprocedures, and guidelines will be developed to enable reimbursement to the PDF by projects \nthat are commercially viable and successfully bid out. \n                                                \n9  ADB.

Output  2:  Strengthened  public\u2013private  partnership  enabling  framework  and \nimproved institutional capacity for public\u2013private partnership. Although the government \nhas issued decision 71 to regulate pilot investments under PPP to enable the private sector to \nengage in PPP and execute and deliver PPP transactions, as well as decisions 392 and 135 to \nestablish a PPP office with specified functions, further work is required for the decisions to \nbecome operational. Given imperfections in the current legal and regulatory framework, the PPP \npilot projects will identify bottlenecks in the design, implementation, and delivery of PPP projects. \nThe deliverables in this output category to strengthen the enabling framework will include (i) \nproposed regulations and guidelines to tender PPP projects under international competitive \nbidding including gender assessment, (ii) review of sector laws and regulations related to PPP \nwith recommendations for sector reforms, and (iii) review of the role of state-owned enterprises \nin PPP transactions and unsolicited proposals and ensuring that PPP projects tendered by an \nauthorized state agency preclude any state-owned enterprise owned by such agency from \nbidding for the project.  \n \n20.  To be able to fully execute and deliver PPP projects, the government will need to \nacquire the capacity to mainstream PPP processes for broader political consensus on PPP and \ndevelop standardized PPP processes and models for implementation by the central government \nand/or provincial and/or local governments. The project will support the government to develop \nand implement a medium-term plan for PPP capacity building that will cover specialized training \ncourses on PPP and development and dissemination of toolkits reflecting international practices. \nContinued medium-term institutional capacity building to implement and sustain PPPs will be \nsupported through technical assistance from other donor agencies and government budgetary \nallocations outside of the project. \n  \nFigure 1: Project Outputs and Process Flows \n \n \nMinistry of Planning and Investment    Government \n  counterpart funding \n \nADB loan \n \n \nLearning \n  by doinga  2.

Although  institutional  capacity  building  on  PPP  will  be  funded  by  the  government\u2019s \nfunding contribution under the project, it should be noted that the consulting services funded by \nADB loans will also have an inherent capacity building component, via a learning-by-doing \napproach.14 The MPI and the sponsoring line ministries will build capacity as they implement \nactual PPP projects with the support of consultants funded by the loans.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.   The MPI will be the executing agency in collaboration with the PPP task force and other \ngovernment ministries and agencies involved with PPP. The task force, chaired by the MPI and \ncomprising the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry \nof Transport, Ministry of Construction, State Bank of Viet Nam, and other relevant agencies as \nmembers, was established in mid-January 2011 to provide overall guidance to the government\u2019s \nPPP piloting initiative. The task force is presently being restructured to facilitate more senior \nrepresentation of the ministries on the task force to enable it to function more effectively as an \ninterministerial coordination body for PPP. The task force will have high-level oversight of the \nPDF and will be the mechanism for coordination of line ministries on the use of the PDF. A \ndedicated project management unit (PMU) will be established with assigned staff from the PPP \noffice of the MPI for day-to-day management of the PDF under the project. The PMU will be \nsupported by a team of national and international experts on PPP who will be funded by the \nproject.  \n \n26.  ADB will coordinate with other development partners who have PPP initiatives in Viet \nNam, including (i) Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), which is processing a loan to \nfund the PDF\u2019s operations, and is also processing grant funding of \u20ac600,000 for capacity \nbuilding of PPP; (ii) the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded \nVietnam Competitiveness Initiative, which has provided consultants to the PPP task force and is \nsupporting the MPI in conducting an initial project screening of potential PPP projects; and (iii) \nthe Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, which is also considering \ngrant funding to the government for PPP capacity building.  \n \n27.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and detailed in the project \nadministration  manual.15 A  diagram  of  the  PPP  institutional  structure  in  the  MPI  and  the \nproposed PDF fund flow mechanism are provided.16 \n \n                                                \n14  The learning-by-doing approach has been utilized in other countries such as Ghana, Ireland, Lesotho, and South \nAfrica,  where  PPP  projects  were  implemented  before  a  full  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  PPP  was \nestablished. In Viet Nam, decision 71 provides a broad framework for PPP but still lacks detailed implementing \nrules and regulations for implementing PPP, particularly at the sector level.   \n15 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Institutional  Structure  and  Project  Development  Facility  Fund  Flow  Mechanism \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2012\u2013December 2018 \nEstimated completion date  June 2019  \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Interministerial Task Force on Public\u2013Private Partnerships \nMinistry of Planning and Investment (MPI) (chair)  \nMembers: to include, but not be limited to, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of \nJustice, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of \nConstruction, State Bank of Viet Nam \n(ii)  Executing agency  MPI \n(iii)  Implementation unit  Project management unit under MPI \nConsulting services  Refer to procurement plan in project administration manual  \nRetroactive financing   Consulting services for preparation of prefeasibility study, full feasibility \nstudy, and transaction advisory with procurement in compliance with Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time).

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Fiduciary \n \n28.  The government\u2019s public financial management reforms are at an early stage but steady \nprogress is being made in improving the legislative and institutional framework. The National \nAssembly promulgated the Law on Public Debt Management in June 2009. The law provides a \nlegal framework for a modern debt management system to monitor public debt, analyze its \nprofile, and resolve and manage related fiscal risks. Implementation of the 2002 Budget Law is \nprogressing. Proposed revisions to the law aim to (i) introduce a medium-term expenditure \nframework  and  performance-based  budgeting;  (ii)  improve  budget  execution;  (iii)  enhance \nbudget  supervision,  monitoring,  and  implementation;  and  (iv)  increase  decentralization  of \nbudget management. A new integrated computerized financial management system (treasury \nand budget management information system) was rolled out in 2008 to strengthen expenditure \nmanagement and control. An updated and improved chart of accounts was developed. A plan \nfor adoption of international public sector accounting standards was approved to provide the \nbasis for preparing government financial statements that are more in line with international \npractices.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.  As the PDF will not finance any investments in project implementation and will aim to \nsupport  only  the  preparation  of  feasibility  studies,  business  case  development,  transaction \nadvisory services, and PPP procurement up to the signing of the PPP contractual agreement, it \nwill not require any economic and financial analysis. \n \n ", "9 \nC.  Governance \n \n30.   With  the  high  stakes  involved  in  large  infrastructure  projects  in  several  sectors, \nchallenges remain, particularly the presence of weak governance and oversight ability in dealing \nwith  PPP  issues,  as  well  as  the  threat  posed  by  collusion  and  corruption.  Although  the \ngovernment has issued a PPP regulation, there are still risks of misallocation of scarce public \nresources,  leading  to  (i)  cases  where  less-qualified  consultants  and  concessionaires  are \nawarded  contracts,  resulting  in  poorly  designed  projects;  and  (ii)  directly  negotiated  PPP \nprojects or unsolicited bids where the interests of the government are discounted and the \ngovernment bears a disproportionate share of the project risk. However, the government is \ntaking an active approach against corruption, and recently adopted several legal changes, \nincluding the Anti-Corruption Law, 2005. Results of investigations against corruption overseen \nby  the  government  inspectorate  have  been  disclosed,  and  a  legal  framework  has  been \nestablished to protect and reward people who speak out against corruption.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n31.   The project aims to improve the investment climate and thereby contribute indirectly \nover the long term to poverty reduction, through greater access to markets and economic and \nemployment opportunities, among other things. The model PPPs to be pursued under the \nproject will help in direct job creation. The following actions will be undertaken to mainstream \ngender at the PDF and PPP project levels: (i) gender assessments will be undertaken in every \nproject to ensure that gender issues are integrated and that project benefits are maximized for \nwomen  and  men;  (ii)  PPP  implementing  guidelines  will  include  guidelines  for  undertaking \ngender  analysis  and  developing  gender  action  plans;  (iii)  a  social  and  gender  specialist \nconsultant will be recruited at the PDF level to ensure due diligence on gender; (iv) the design \nfor individual projects will include a social and gender specialist on the project team; (v) the \nmedium-term capacity development plan will include gender briefing and training sessions for \nstaff of the PPP office, MPI, and sector agencies; (vi) all staff at the PPP office and PMU and \nrelevant staff of sector agencies will be trained on gender issues and gender assessments, and \nwomen\u2019s participation will be encouraged; and (vii) mitigation measures and other social risks \nwill address gender concerns. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.   The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n33.  As the PDF will not finance any investments in project implementation and will aim to \nsupport  only  the  preparation  of  feasibility  studies,  business  case  development,  transaction \nadvisory services, and PPP procurement up to the signing of the PPP contractual agreement, it \nwill not be subject to ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard requirements as prescribed in \nthe  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  as  well  as  development  partner  and  government \nregulations and procedures. Gender assessment will not occur at the PDF level, but is proposed \nto be part of the project preparation activities for each PPP project.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.17 \n                                                \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nMacroeconomic instability due to  Measures  undertaken  by  the  government  to  strengthen  its \nglobal and regional financial  monetary  and  fiscal  policies,  particularly  with  regard  to  public \nturbulence  expenditure management and expansion of the tax base \nWith high stakes involved in large  The government has established a high-level interministerial task \ninfrastructure projects, the project  force on PPP headed by the deputy prime minister to provide \nmay face impediments such as  institutional support.

ASSURANCES \n \n35.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. \n \n36.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR13,171,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership Support Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; \nfor a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to \nthe Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n1 October 2012\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nIncreased private  By the end of 2020 aggregate  International and national  Stable macroeconomic \nsector investment in  private sector investment in  business climate surveys  environment and finance \ninfrastructure  infrastructure will increase by  sector \nWorld Bank PPP database \n50% of the 2010 aggregate \nSufficient liquidity available \ntotal (baseline $3 billion in  MOC, MOF, MPI, SBV, and \nin the private sector \n2010)  other government statistics \non infrastructure investments  Risk \n \ncontained in websites, \nExogenous, international \nreports, and publications \nfinancial shock and \n  macroeconomic instability \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved  By end 2018, at least five  Reports of procurement  Appropriate incentives for \ngovernment  commercially viable PPP  agencies of key ministries  private sector participation \ncapacity to catalyze  infrastructure projects are  involved in public  are available \nPPPs and  successfully bid out and at  infrastructure investments \nRisks \ninfrastructure  least two project commenced \nAnnual reports of project \ninvestments  implementation  Political resistance and \nsponsors/financiers \nvested interest may slow \n   \nReports of procurement  down reforms \n  agencies of key ministries \nPoor governance and \ninvolved in public \ncorruption.
