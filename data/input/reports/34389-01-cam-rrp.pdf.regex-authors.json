The FSP II, approved on 6 \nDecember 2007, takes a cluster approach and consists of four back-\nto-back  subprograms.  Each  succeeding  subprogram  is to  be \nprocessed  sequentially  upon  completion  of  the  preceding \nsubprogram. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsector: Finance sector development \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, governance \nSubthemes: Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets, \nfinancial and economic governance \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nSocial Sector  Involuntary resettlement: Category C. \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C. \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected from program implementation. \n   \nThe Program   With a rapidly growing commercial economy that requires a sound \nRationale    financial system to sustain its rate of growth, the Government, if it is \nto  achieve  long-term  sustainable  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction,  needs  to  develop  the  financial  sector  by  mobilizing \nfinancial resources, channeling them to productive investments, and \nmanaging  the  inherent  risks.  The  Asian  financial  crisis  provided \nmany examples of the devastating impact that financial crises can \nhave on countries, wiping out several years of growth within a very \nshort time. Thus, to promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and \nhelp countries avoid financial crises, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  plays  an  important  role  in  supporting  financial  sector \ndevelopment in its client countries, including Cambodia.  \n \nThe program loan cluster will support the Government\u2019s continued \nefforts  to  strengthen  the  financial  sector  by  supporting  a \ncombination  of  legal  and  regulatory  reforms,  targeted  capacity \nbuilding, improved disclosure standards and financial transparency, \nand establishment of key financial infrastructure. A sound, efficient, \nand integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based \nsustainable  economic  growth.  It  will  help  reduce  poverty  by \nincreasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic \nactivities, and extending the outreach of the formal financial sector \nto poor and rural areas. An efficient financial system will promote \nprivate sector development and foreign direct investment. A robust ", "ii   \n \nfinancial  sector  will  protect  the  economy  from  unfavorable \nexogenous shocks that are becoming more common in increasingly \nglobal financial markets.  \n   \nObjective and Scope  FSP II aims to promote the development of a sound, market-based \nfinancial system to support resource mobilization and sustainable \neconomic  growth.  With  a  growing,  resilient,  and  more  efficient \nfinancial  system  as  the  expected  outcome,  Subprogram  2  will \ncontinue the following reform activities: \n(i)  Improve financial intermediation by upgrading the payments, \nclearance, and settlement system to support growing financial \nservices;  enhance  market  confidence  by  improving  public \nfinancial  disclosure  and  establishing  a  credit  information \nbureau;  support  market  development  by  establishing  an \ninterbank  market  and  tradable  government  securities;  and \nimproving the outreach of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in a \nsustainable manner.  \n(ii)  Enhance  resilience  of  the  financial  sector  by  revising  and \nupdating the law on banking and financial institutions, and by \nintroducing  supportive  regulations  to  strengthen  financial \nactivities;  tighten  prudential  supervision  and  regulations  of \nbanks and microfinance institutions; and build on the legal and \nregulatory foundation by drafting a new law on commercial \ncontracts  that  includes  specific  sections  on  agencies  and \nfranchising. \n(iii)  Promote  good  governance  by  implementing  international \ninitiatives  on  anti-money  laundering  and  combating  the \nfinancing of terrorism; by enhancing corporate governance and \ntransparency  in  the  insurance  industry;  by  establishing \ncommercial dispute resolution mechanisms; and by improving \nthe capability and increasing the number of qualified national \naccountants and auditors. \n(iv)  Enhance  efficiency  by  computerizing  the  management \ninformation system of the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), \nas well as by upgrading the skills and capacity of microfinance \nagencies\u2019 staff.   \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms A  loan  of  $10,300,000  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s\n  Special Funds resources for Subprogram 2. The loan will have a 24-\n  year term, including a grace period of 8 years. The interest rate will \nbe 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter.  \n   \nProgram Period and   The implementation period for Subprogram 2 is January\u2013December \nTranching  2008. The loan will be released in a single tranche upon completion \nof specific tranche conditions and following loan effectiveness. \n   \nExecuting Agency  NBC will be the Executing Agency, and the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance  (MEF)  and  Ministry  of  Commerce  (MOC)  will  be  the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  financial  sector  steering  committee, \nchaired by the governor of NBC and comprising senior officers from ", "iii \nMEF, MOC, and NBC, will meet as required to review progress \nreports from the technical working group, consider pending issues, \nand  propose  concrete  actions  to  resolve  issues.  A  senior  NBC \nofficer has been appointed as program director to assist NBC, MEF, \nand MOC in coordinating day-to-day program implementation. The \nprogram director will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB on \nprogram implementation. \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  All \nprocurement of goods and services produced in, and originating \nfrom, ADB member countries will be made with due consideration to \neconomy  and  efficiency,  in  accordance  with  standard  public \nprocedures  in  Cambodia  and  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices acceptable to ADB. In accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998), the loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed to the Kingdom of Cambodia as the Borrower.  \n   \nRisks and Safeguards  Program implementation could face a number of risks, for which \nmitigation measures have been put in place, as appropriate.  \n \n(i)  Challenges to sustaining economic growth. Cambodia\u2019s \neconomic prospects must be viewed against a number of adverse \ndevelopments in the external environment. The immediate impact of \nthe financial crisis in the US and Europe, and the drying up there of \nliquidity in the commercial paper and related money and interbank \nmarkets pose limited if no direct\u2014or indirect\u2014financial sector risks \nto Cambodia\u2019s economy, either through balance sheets or liquidity \nfactors, as Cambodia\u2019s banks do not have significant exposure to \nborrowing from international banks and capital markets do not as \nyet exist. However, the slowdown in the global economy resulting \nfrom the fall in the US and European growth rates has impacted on \nCambodia\u2019s  growth  rate,  initially  through  reduced  expansion  of \nexports following reduced demand for Cambodia\u2019s garments. The \nrecent unexpected surge in international energy and food prices has \nfueled  higher  domestic  inflation  in  2008  with  potential  knock-on \neffects for consumption and poverty, growth, and financial sector \nstability. In addition to foreign direct investment inflows, the rapid \ncredit expansion is adding to growth in real estate investment and to \nrising property prices, and it is causing the assets of some banks to \nbe increasingly vulnerable to real estate risks. The Government has \nintroduced  a  combination  of  fiscal  and  monetary  measures  that \nhave helped to moderate inflation and slow lending. Throughout \nSubprogram 2, the Government and ADB have undertaken periodic \nreviews of macroeconomic and financial developments to assess \npotential risks to the financial sector. These reviews will continue \nthrough the program period for Subprogram 3. Budget assistance \nthrough a series of program loans in 2008, including through this \n ", "iv   \n \nprogram, is being provided to bolster the economy\u2019s resilience. The \nimpact on poverty of food price increases is being mitigated through \nemergency assistance approved for this purpose. \n \n(ii)  Unexpected  political  disturbance.  Cambodia has been \nenjoying very high political unity and stability for several years. A \nnational election was conducted peacefully on 27 July 2008, as was \nthe  swearing-in  ceremony  for  the  new  Government  on  25 \nSeptember 2008. In anticipation of any delays in forming the new \nGovernment, Subprogram 2 was designed to ensure that most of \nthe legal drafting that closely involves midlevel officials would be \ndone prior to formation of the Government so that draft laws and \nsub-decrees  would  be  ready  for  submission  to  the  Council  of \nMinisters once the new Government was sworn in.  \n \n(iii)  Weak governance and corruption in the sector. Weak \ngovernance  and  incidents  of  corruption  could  erode  investor \nconfidence  and  prevent  the  attainment  of  expected  sector \noutcomes. The Government\u2019s National Strategic Development Plan \n2006\u20132010 views corruption as a threat to sustained growth and \ndevelopment  of  the  country  in  general.  Backed  by  an  active \ndevelopment community, the Government is increasingly taking a \ntougher stance against corruption. The general consensus is that \ngood governance and measures to address corruption are needed \nfor  a  successful  partnership  between  the  Government  and  the \ndevelopment community. This was considered during design of the \nprogram  cluster,  and  there  will  be  continuous  pursuit  of \nimprovements to the institutional governance structure, accounting \ndisclosure  standards,  financial  transparency,  complementary \nlegislation, regulatory updates and enforcement, supervision, and \nsurveillance of the financial sector.  \n \n(iv)  Weak  institutional  and  human  capacity.  Some  of  the \nfinancial  sector  risks  are  associated  with  weak  institutional  and \nhuman  capacity.  The  same  applies  to  the  implementation  and \nenforcement of new laws and regulations. To mitigate those risks, \ntraining programs have been initiated at various training institutions \nestablished during FSP I. Subprogram 2 provides financial support \nto  the  institutions  to  help  update  their  curricula.  The  proposed \nadvisory TA will help reduce the risks arising from weak capacity, \nespecially in the implementation of all prudential regulations. With \nthese design safeguards, the integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to far outweigh any costs.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance   ADB will provide TA in the amount of $300,000 from its TA funding \nprogram to support NBC, MEF, and MOC in implementing some of \nthe reform triggers for Subprogram 3, as well as to provide the \nGovernment with timely policy advice as needed. The main activities \nof the TA will be to (i) further strengthen the on-site supervision and \nsurveillance  of  the  banking  system  (4  person-months),  (ii)  help \nstrengthen the off-site and on-site supervision of MFIs (3 person-", "v \nmonths), and (iii) strengthen the supervision and surveillance of the \ninsurance industry (4 person-months). One national consultant will \nbe engaged, an insurance expert (6 person-months), to assist the \ninternational  insurance  expert.  A  total  of  17 person-months  of \nconsulting inputs, comprising 11 international and 6 national person-\nmonths, are required. The consultants will be engaged by ADB on \nan individual basis to implement TA activities in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time), using the competitive selection method. NBC will \nbe the Executing Agency, and MEF and MOC the implementing \nagencies. The TA is scheduled to commence in February 2009 and \nbe completed by January 2010. \n \n ", "", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL  \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for Subprogram 2 of the Financial Sector Program II Cluster. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the Implementation of Key Policy \nTriggers of Subprogram 3, and if the Board approves the proposed subprogram loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported reforms in Cambodia\u2019s financial \nsector  since  1999,  beginning  with  a  diagnostic  assessment  of  the  financial  sector  and \nformulation of the Financial Sector Development Blueprint 2001\u20132010. The blueprint, updated \nas  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Strategy  (FSDS)  2006\u20132015,  was  adopted  by  the \nGovernment  in  February  2007.  FSDS  provides  the  long-term  objectives  and  development \nframework  to  guide  and  shape  medium-term  policy  design  and  implementation.  The \nGovernment has, since 2001, been able to implement important reforms in the financial sector \nwith ADB assistance under the first Financial Sector Program1 (FSP I) that concluded in August \n2007 and with complementary assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) poverty \nreduction and growth facility that ended in 2003. Since implementation of the blueprint, there \nhave been some notable achievements as well as lessons learned from both domestic and \ninternational  experience.  Those  experiences,  coupled  with  the  need  to  support  continuing \ndevelopment of the financial sector to meet the new challenges, prompted the Government to \nrequest further support from ADB to enable continuing reforms in the sector. This led to design \nand approval of the Second Financial Sector Program (FSP II) Cluster2 on 6 December 2007. \n \n3.  FSP II comprises a series of four single-tranche subprograms, to be implemented from \nSeptember 2006 to December 2010, within a well-defined medium-term framework involving \nfundamental  reforms  to  be  completed  prior  to  Board  consideration  of  each  subprogram. \nSubprograms are linked by key actions (triggers) that are deemed essential for the success of \nthe medium-term program. The overall goal of FSP II is to promote the development of a sound, \nmarket-based  financial  system  to  enhance  resource  mobilization  and  support  sustainable \neconomic growth. The expected outcome is a growing, resilient, and efficient financial system. \n(The design and monitoring framework for the program is in Appendix 1. The policy matrix and \nmedium-term program are in Appendix 2).  \n \n4.  Subprogram 1 with 14 key reform actions was approved together with the FSP II cluster \nconcept on 6 December 2007. All 14 policy actions were completed prior to Board circulation in \nNovember  2007  and  the  loan  agreement  for  Subprogram  1  (footnote  2)  was  signed  on \n18 February 2008. The loan was declared effective on 10 April 2008, following which the total \nloan  equivalent  of  SDR6,381,000  was  disbursed  on  24  April  2008.  To  allow  for  loan \ndisbursement in April, the loan closing date was extended from March to May 2008. ADB \n                                                 \n1\n ADB. 2001.

THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n \n5.  Sustained High Economic Growth and Recent Escalation of Inflation. Cambodia \nhas recorded double-digit economic growth averaging 11% over the last 4 years. Indications are \nthat the incidence of overall poverty declined from 47% in 1994 to around 35% in 2004 (refer to \nkey country economic indicators in Table 1). The economy is expected to grow at a more \nmodest rate of 6.5% in 2008, reflecting an anticipated slowdown in garment exports and the \ndampening effects on domestic demand of the significantly higher inflation. Growth has been \nnarrowly based and concentrated in garments, tourism, and construction, thus leaving the \neconomy vulnerable to external shocks. Reflecting rapid economic growth, domestic liquidity \nhas been rising rapidly, from a small base, partly fueled by the surge in capital inflows from \nforeign direct investments and the rapid growth of credit to the private sector. Inflation, which \nhad been subdued until 2007, was sparked by supply-side shocks and surged from an annual \nrate of 10.8% in December 2007 to peak at 25.1% in June 2008, then slipped to 20.7% in \nSeptember 2008. Domestic excess liquidity is being mopped up to avoid fueling an inflationary \nspiral.  \n \n6.  Balance  of  Payments  Strengthened  but  Challenges  Remain.  While  exports \n(dominated by garments) grew by 11% in 2007, imports rose by over 14% (reflecting growing \ndomestic inflationary pressures). That led to a widening of the trade deficit to 15.5% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP). The resulting current account deficit (excluding transfers) was lower, \nat 7.8% of GDP, thanks to rising tourism receipts. The current account deficit was more than \noffset by rising capital inflows from foreign direct investment and aid. As a result of the very \nsubstantial  capital  inflows,  as  reflected  in  rising  international  reserves  and  a  policy  of \nmaintaining a stable exchange rate, the overall balance of payments was in surplus and gross \ninternational reserves amounted to $1.6 billion at the end of 2007 (equivalent to about 3.8 \nmonths of import cover) and rose further to about $2.0 billion by mid-2008. Dampened demand \nfor garment exports can be expected in 2008 due to the downturn in the United States, and \ngreater competition can be expected from the People\u2019s Republic of China and Viet Nam in 2009 \nwith the termination of safeguards imposed by the United States on garment imports. It is \nexpected that slower growth of the garment trade will be at least partially offset by accelerating \ngrowth in tourism, facilitated by foreign direct investments in constructing new hotels and other \nservice facilities (notably at Siem Reap where the historical ruins of Angkor Wat are located and \nat Sihanoukville where the popular beaches can be easily accessed). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3\n  ADB. 2007.

Fiscal Policy Generally Prudent. Given its importance to macroeconomic management, \nfiscal policy has been key to the pro-growth investment environment prevailing in Cambodia. \nThe 2007 budgetary results have not varied substantially from the past budgetary record, as \nrevenue collections were on target and expenditures were contained close to budgetary levels. \nThe  budget\u2019s  current  account  balance  showed  a  healthy  surplus  while  the  overall  deficit, \nincorporating investment outlays, amounted to about 2.8% of GDP, continuing the trend from \nthe last few years. Fiscal prudence appears to have been maintained in 2008, and the part of \nthe budget funded from domestic sources continued to be contractionary. Government deposits \nin the banking system continued to increase through mid-2008. While the macroeconomic \nvariables of economic growth, budget, and balance of payments were still clearly robust in 2007 \n ", "4   \n \n \nand through mid-2008, the outlook for 2008 and beyond remains a concern unless inflation is \nbrought fully under control. \n \n8.  Inflation  Accelerated. After remaining in single digits in recent years, inflation has \naccelerated rapidly since September 2007. Published figures indicate that on an end-of-period \nbasis, annual consumer price inflation accelerated from 6.4% at end-September 2007 to 10.8% \nat end-December 2007 and further to 25.1% at end-June 2008 before receding to 20.7% in \nSeptember 2008 (Figure 1). Between February and August 2008, official inflation data was not \nreleased pending an ongoing interministerial technical discussion relating to the change in \ncoverage and methodology of the consumer price index.4 In September 2008, the Government \ndecided to retain the old methodology and resumed publication of the inflation data. Despite a \ngenerally  sound  macroeconomic  framework,  Cambodia  now  faces  a  strongly  inflationary \nsituation that has been ignited by sharply higher prices for petroleum and food and has been \nfurther fueled by rapid credit expansion to the private sector. Following the increase in minimum \nreserve requirements to 16% of total deposits at the end of July 2008, the banking system is still \nin a position of excess unrestricted liquidity, equivalent to almost 22% of total deposits. Though \nreal economic growth has averaged 11% over the past 4 years and monetization has been \nincreasing  because  of  rising  confidence  in  the  banking  system,  excess  liquidity  has  been \ncreating demand pressures that are reflected in the accelerating inflation. \n \n \n  \nFigure 1: End-of-Period Inflation \n \n35\n \n \n30\n \n  25\n \n  20\n  %\n  15\n \n10\n \n \n5\n \n \n0\n \nDec-05 Dec-06 Jun-07 Sep-07 Dec-07 Jun-08 Jul-08\n \n  Period\n \n  CAM PRC THA VIE\n \n         CAM = Cambodia, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, THA = Thailand, VIE = Viet Nam \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia, National Institute of Statistics, Staff estimates. \n \n \n9.  Government\u2019s Measures to Reduce Inflation. In a bid to help absorb excess liquidity \nand ease inflationary pressure, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) (i) introduced a 15% \nceiling on commercial bank credit for real estate trading, effective 26 June 2008; (ii) doubled the \n                                                 \n4\n In January 2008, consideration was given to extending coverage of the consumer price index to four urban towns \nin addition to the capital, Phnom Penh; rebasing the index (to 2006); and reweighting based upon income surveys. \nThe weight of food in the index was to increase from 42% to 58%. Following rapid food price increases, the revised \nindex showed a higher inflation rate than did the old one. Among some other technical issues being reexamined by \nan interdepartmental technical group is the increased weight for food in the reference consumer basket.      ", "      5   \n \nminimum reserve requirement for commercial banks to 16%, effective end-July 2008; and (iii) \nrelaxed capital controls by allowing commercial banks, upon verification, to invest their surplus \ndeposits abroad where they can earn higher returns.5 While the liquidity positions of a few small \nbanks have been temporarily affected, this provided the NBC and the Bankers Association with \nthe opportunity to initiate an interbank market. For its part, the Ministry of Economy and Finance \n(MEF) has  also announced a series of measures that are designed to partially offset the \nreduction in the standard of living of civil servants (e.g., increasing the base wage by 20%, \nspouse and child allowances by 100%, and teacher allowances by 10%) and other affected \ngroups (e.g., increasing subsidies to offset higher fuel and electricity costs), and to address \nsome of the domestic food supply-related causes of inflation over the longer term (e.g., special \nfinancing for rice millers to increase rice stocks and internal distribution systems and reduced \ntaxation on imports of agricultural machinery). With these measures in place, the Government \nreported that monetary growth had declined from 60% in December 2007 to 31.4% in August \n2008 and credit growth had slowed. The inflation pressure has moderated, and inflation is \nexpected to drop below 20% by December 2008. The Government will continue to monitor the \nsituation closely. \n \n10.  Macroeconomic Stability Crucial. Cambodia\u2019s economy is vulnerable to a number of \nadverse developments in the external environment. The sharp slowdown in the US economy \nand turbulence in its financial markets will indirectly affect growth conditions by cutting demand \nfor garments. Maintaining macroeconomic stability, including by further reducing inflation, is a \nnecessary  condition  for  the  economy's  continued  expansion  and  diversification.  Equally \nimportant is to limit the adverse impact of rising prices for basic necessities from supply-related \nshocks for the vulnerable segments of society. Cambodia has reserves sufficient for more than \n3 months of imports, and, while these are normally adequate against external shocks, in the \ncurrent  environment  of  uncertain  oil  and  food  prices,  close  monitoring  of  macroeconomic \ndevelopments  is  needed.  Beyond  the  near-term  measures  outlined  above,  complementary \nstructural reforms will be required to address Cambodia\u2019s longer-term development challenges, \nespecially in reducing poverty (particularly in rural areas) and narrowing urban-rural income \ndisparities. As a financial sector contribution, NBC and MEF are considering to accelerate the \nadoption of market-based instruments to help absorb excess liquidity whenever required and to \nbegin the development of a capital market. This is consistent with FSDS 2006\u20132015 objectives. \n \nIV.  LINK BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND ADB STRATEGIES \n11.  Cambodia\u2019s 5-year National Strategic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 was prepared in \nthe context of a falling, but still high, incidence of overall poverty and a growing urban-rural \ndivide. The Plan aims to give effect to the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy (adopted in 2004) \nthat sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda as a series of four interlocking strategies with \nenhanced governance at its core. One of the four strategies focuses on the preconditions \nrequired to promote economic growth through agriculture, infrastructure, and private sector \ndevelopment while enhancing employment and human resource development. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s overarching goal in Cambodia is sustainable poverty reduction. In line with the \npriorities and strategies identified in the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy, ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy  and  program6 focuses  on three  strategic  pillars: (i)  broad-based  economic  growth \n                                                 \n5\n Monetary policy is constrained by the high rate of dollarization in the economy and the lack of policy instruments. \n6  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132009): Cambodia. Manila. \n \n \n ", "6   \n \n \nthrough investments in physical infrastructure, development of the financial sector, support for \ngreater regional integration, sustainable development of small and medium-sized enterprises, \nand investments in agriculture and irrigation; (ii) inclusive social development through basic \neducation, empowerment of vulnerable groups such as women and ethnic minorities, control of \ncommunicable diseases, provision of rural water supply and sanitation facilities, and community-\nbased sustainable management and conservation of natural resources in the Tonle Sap basin; \nand (iii) good governance through improvements in public financial management to enhance the \ndevelopment effectiveness of public expenditures and decentralization initiatives to strengthen \nlocal participation in government and improve public service delivery.   \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program specifically states that ADB will continue its leading \nrole  in  supporting  financial  sector  development  and  that  ADB\u2019s  future  involvement  in  the \nfinancial sector would depend on the successful update of the FSDS. The updated FSDS 2006\u2013\n2015 states that financial sector development is not an end in itself; rather it is one aspect \nsupporting the development and reduction of poverty in Cambodia (Figure 2). While much work \nis  needed  to  achieve  this  difficult  goal,  accelerating  and  diversifying  growth  is  generally \naccepted as the key. Financial sector development must support this objective. Reform and \nchange are essential for growth. At the same time, expanding finance brings risks. Hence, the \ncontext in which financial development occurs must be carefully considered with a focus on \nprudential risk reduction, transparency, and uniform application of rules and regulations. \n \n \nFigure 2: Overview of the Second Financial Sector Program Cluster in Relation to the FSDS 2006\u20132015 \n \nand Cambodia\u2019s National Economic Development Goals \n \n \n   \nFSDS 2006\u20132015 \n  -  increase compe tition \n  -  maintain soundn ess \n-  integrate inform al and formal sector \n \n-  increase efficien cy \n    Economic \n    growth with \n    equitable \n  distribution and \n  Increased resource mobilization, enhanced  poverty \nintermediation, an d risk mitigation\n  reduction \n \n   \n   \nSavers  Intermediate and Markets  Investors \n \n \n \n \n \n  Improve confidence and  Maintain  stability  in  the    Promote good governance  Enhance Efficiency \n  financial intermediation  financial sector    -  Promote international  -  Computerize and \n  -  Improve financial  -  Update legal and    initiatives on anti-money  integrate key \nservices and upgrade  regulatory framework     laundering and combating the  operating \n  the payments system  -  Strengthen bank  financing of terrorism  functions of NBC \n \n  -  Enhance market  supervision capacity  -  Enhance corporate  -  Upgrade the \n \nconfidence  -  Strengthen prudential  governance and transparency  capacity and skills \n   \n-  Develop interbank  supervision and  in the insurance industry  of MFI staff \n  market and tradable  regulations of MFIs    -  Establish commercial dispute \n  government securities  -  Enhance legal foundation    resolution mechanism \n-  Promote outreach in  to support financial and    -  Develop the accounting and \n \nthe formal sector  commercial transactions    auditing profession \n   \nFSDS = Financial Sector Development Strategy, MFI = microfinance institution, NBC = National Bank of \nCambodia. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.

Following the political instability and institutional destruction of the late 1970s and early \n1980s, Cambodia\u2019s financial system has been undergoing rapid development based upon \nprivate sector participation. At the end of June 2008, the formal financial system comprised \nNBC, 20 private commercial banks, 5 specialized financial institutions, 2 representative offices \nof foreign-based banks, 16 licensed and 26 registered microfinance institutions (MFIs), and \n6 insurance companies. Cambodia also has the objective of developing bond and securities \nmarkets  within  the  medium  term.  The  predominantly  rural  nature  of  the  economy,  high \ntransaction costs, inability of the real sector to put together bankable projects, and low creditor \nconfidence have been the main factors resulting in low formal intermediation and outreach \nwithin the financial sector. There has also been a slow development of nonbank financial \ninstitutions, with a limited range of products and services being offered. A sector analysis is \nprovided in Appendix 3.  \n \n15.  The  performance  of  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  has  been  satisfactory,  though \nchallenging (refer to key financial data in Table 2). With a relatively strong banking subsector, \nfinancial deepening has accelerated with more financial services being promoted through the \nprogressive reforms implemented under FSP I. The broad money supply (M2) to GDP rose from \n12.8% of GDP in 2000 (before FSP I) to 30.8% in June 2008 (Figure 3). Credit to the private \nsector correspondingly rose from 6.5% of GDP in 2000 to an estimated 22.9% in June 2008. \nTotal deposits to GDP grew from 9.2% in 2000 to about 25.8% in June 2008. Despite these \npositive  developments,  and  as  noted  below,  there  are  still  policy  gaps,  implementation \nchallenges, and capacity constraints needing to be addressed in each of the subsectors. \n \n \n  Figure 3: Financial Intermediation \n  \n   \n35\n   \n  30   30.8\n   \n25.9\n25\n  %)  \n   DP (20 18  .4 18.4 20.5\n  M2/G15 13 15.6 16.3  \n  10  \n   \n  5  \n   \n0\n   \n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 June-08\n   \nYear\n   \n  M2/GDP (%)\n   \n        M2 = a broad money supply measure, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia.  \n \n   \n . \n ", "8   \n \n \nTable 2: Key Financial Data \n \n June    \nIndicators    2001      2002      2003      2004     2005    2006     2007 \n2008 \nM2/GDP (%)    13.0       15.6         16.3          18.4          18.4          20.5          25.9           30.8 \nNumber  of    33.0       32.0         17.0          17.0          18.0          20.0          24.0           25.0 \nregistered banks \nAverage  CAR    58.5       49.3         40.6          34.5          32.0          26.0           24.0           26.0 \n(%) \nPrivate  sector      6.0         6.3           7.2            8.5            9.3          12.2          18.3           22.9 \ncredit/GDP (%) \nNumber  of  loan  68,167.0  86,757.0  105,347.0  123,937.0  145,161.0  164,931.0  197,337.0  209,053.0 \naccounts \nTotal  10.4       12.7        13.1         15.1         14.6          17.9          26.6          25.8 \ndeposits/GDP \n(%) \nNPLs/total  loans    8.1      14.6        12.7           9.6           7.3           9.8           3.4            2.7 \n(%) \nAverage  return    0.6       1.1         0.9           1.2           1.8           2.8           2.8            1.6 \non assets (%) \nAverage  interest  12.5     14.0       13.3         15.3         12.2         11.8         11.1         10.8 \nspread (%) \nTotal  assets  of  62.7     70.3       68.6         66.6         63.3         66.3         70.0         69.1 \nfive  largest \nbanks/total \nassets (%)        \nTotal  deposits  80.8     83.6       80.9        78.3         71.0        70.0           73.0        61.6 \nof  five  largest \nbanks  /  total \ndeposits (%) \nNumber  of    0.0     30.0      34.0       38.0         39.0         40.0           42.0       42.0 \nlicensed and   \nregistered MFIs \nTotal number of       410.0   328.0       265.0        322.0         368.0        471.0         624.1     689.2 \nMFI  borrowers  \n(\u2018000) \nTotal amount of  35.9     51.3      32.6       40.9         49.2        92.2         160.1    221.3 \nMFI  loans  ($ \nmillion) \nTotal amount of    3.8       7.1       2.5         2.0          1.9          2.9             6.1       6.4 \nMFI deposits  ($ \nmillion) \nTotal number of  158,627.0  107,150.0  88,474.0  122,984.0  137,624.0  113,277.0  147,966.0  154,599.0 \nMFI depositors  \nNumber  of    1.0       1.0        4.0        3.0          3.0         3.0             5.0      5.0 \ninsurance firms \nTotal  insurance    3.6       5.5        8.8      10.1          10.8       13.0           17.5      8.7 \npremium               \n($ million) \nCAR = capital adequacy ratio, GDP = gross domestic product, M2 = a broad money supply measure, MFI = \nmicrofinance institution, NPL = nonperforming loan. \nSources: National Bank of Cambodia and Ministry of Economy and Finance. \n  \n \n16.  Banking.  At  the  end  of  June  2008  there  were  20  private  commercial  banks, \n5 specialized  banks  (including  1  state-owned  bank,  the  Rural  Development  Bank),  and \n2 representative  offices  of  foreign-based  banks  in  Cambodia.  All  registered  banks  are \nadequately capitalized (Figures 4 and 5) following the relicensing process that set the capital \nrequirement at $13 million equivalent (2002) and the initial minimum capital adequacy ratio at ", "      9   \n \n20%, which was then appropriately reduced to 15% in 2004. While banks are free to set their \nown interest rates (since 1995), the average annual interest rate spread tends to be high \n(around 11% in 2007, down from 15.3% in 2004) and most banks continue to maintain high \nliquidity.  The  number  of  active  borrowers  reached  exceeded  209,000  (1.5%  of  the  total \npopulation) at the end of June 2008, with potential for growth. Further work is required to \naddress key governance structures of these banks, upgrade staff skills, encourage competition, \nincrease the minimum capital requirement, and enhance their understanding of and compliance \nwith new statutory requirements (e.g., regular provision of prudential reports, requirements for \nanti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism, a credit information sharing \nsystem, online filing registry for movable collaterals, new Cambodian Accounting Standards, \npublication of audited financial statements). While some progress has been made in the banking \nsupervision area, further work is required to upgrade prudential requirements to international \nstandards and best practices, upgrade the skills of NBC staff, and enhance proper surveillance \n(including the complementary role of external auditors) and uniform enforcement of regulations \nto maintain the safety of public deposits and the integrity of the banking system. \n \n \nFigure 4: Confidence in the Banking System \n \n \n \n \n  35 30\n \n30\n25\n \n  25\n20\n \n20\no.   15%\nN\n15  \n  10\n10\n \n5   5\n \n0 0\n \n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 June-08\n \nYear\n \n  No. of Registered Banks Private Sector Credit/GDP (%) Total Deposits\n \n   \n  GDP = gross domestic product. \n  Source: National Bank of Cambodia.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "10   \n \n \n \nFigure 5: Soundness of the Banking System \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  70\n \n \n  60\n \n \n  50\n \n \n  40\n  %\n \n30\n \n \n    20\n \n  10\n \n \n  0\n \n    2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 June-08\n \n  Year\n   \n   \nAverage CAR (%) NPLs/Total Loans (%)\n   \n \n \n \n   \n   CAR = capital adequacy ratio, NPL = nonperforming loan. \n  Note: Minimum CAR is 15%. \n  Source: National Bank of Cambodia. \n \n \n \n \n17.  Microfinance. Microfinance has come a long way since licensing commenced in 2002, \nas there were new 16 licensed MFIs and 26 registered nongovernment-operated MFIs at the \nend of August 2008. The microfinance industry is expanding rapidly, providing a link from the \nformal financial sector to rural households and microenterprises (Figure 6). The number of \nactive borrowers availing themselves of rural household credits, microbusiness loans, and small \nbusiness loans exceeded 689,000 clients (4.9% of the total population) at the end of June 2008, \nwith potential for further growth. Microfinance lending also grew from $92.2 million in 2006 to \n$221.3 million in June 2008, with reported nonperforming loans below 3%. Voluntary savings \nremain very small, and access to local finance by MFIs has been very limited. With technical \nassistance7 from ADB, NBC issued a prakas8 in December 2007 setting out the criteria for MFIs \nthat are eligible to mobilize voluntary savings. A public campaign to promote MFI savings has \ncommenced. The NBC supervision unit for MFIs regulates the operation of MFIs and further \nsupport will be required to enhance its off-site and on-site supervision capabilities.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7\n ADB.  2005.

Insurance. There are six operating insurance firms (one state-owned), including one \nlocally registered reinsurer (80% state-owned). Shares in both state-owned firms are held by the \nMEF, which is also the regulator of insurance activities. Divesting government shares continues \nto be an important reform agenda item so as to allow the MEF to perform its regulatory functions \nequitably.  Negotiation  to  sell  75%  of  state-owned  Caminco\u2019s  shares  to  a  joint  venture \ncomprising an insurance firm from Thailand and a Cambodian investor is in its final stage. The \ninsurance industry is very small, with a total premium income of $17.5 million in 2007 (Figure 7). \nGrowing the industry would require a more comprehensive legal and regulatory framework \n(comparable  to  those  used  in  neighboring  countries),  accompanied  by  specifically  tailored \ntraining and incentives. A risk-based capital framework is needed following amendments to the \nexisting  insurance  law  that  MEF  initiated.  Some  of  the  international  standards  have  been \nadopted. Further work is required to upgrade the remaining insurance prudential regulations to \ninternational standards, including for insurance companies to adopt an appropriate reporting \nstandard, to upgrade staff skills, to encourage competition on a level playing field, and to \nstrengthen surveillance and ensure that regulations are fully enforced. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "12   \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7: Growing Insurance Industry \n \n \n6 20\n \n  5\n      15\n  4 n\n  o\n  o. 3 10 lli\nN i\n  m\n  2 $ \n  5\n1\n \n \n0 0\n \n \n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n \n  Year\n \n  No. of insurance firms\n  Total insurance premium ($ million)             \n \n \nSource: Ministry of Economy and Finance. \n \n \n19.  Legal and Supporting Infrastructure. Key pieces of legislation have been adopted \nsince 2001. Those include laws on insurance, accounting, commercial enterprises, negotiable \ninstruments  and  payment  transactions,  commercial  arbitration,  secured  transactions, \ngovernment and nongovernment securities, insolvency, as well as anti-money laundering and \ncombating the financing of terrorism. Most of the enacted laws have been implemented, and \ntraining curricula have been introduced at selected legal faculties to train legal practitioners and \njudges  on  these  new  principles.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  support  under \nSubprogram  2  to  revise  and  update  the  banking  and  financial  institutions  law,  prepare \nimplementing sub-decrees for the commercial arbitration law and secured transactions law, and \ncomplete the drafting of a new law on commercial contracts.  \n \n20.  Accounting Development. Key accounting and auditing initiatives implemented so far \ninclude (i) adoption of a law on corporate accounts, their audit, and the accounting profession; \n(ii) establishment of a national accounting council to set and interpret standards; (iii) introduction \nof requirements that international accounting standards and international standards on auditing \nbe applied to all companies incorporated in Cambodia; and (iv) establishment of an association \nof accountants and auditors (Kampuchea Institute of Certified Public Accountants and Auditors), \nits bylaws, a code of ethics that complies with the requirements of the International Federation \nof Accountants, and committees on education and ethics within the association. In 2005, only 10 \nlocally qualified accountants were working in the system. To improve accounting and auditing \ncapacity,  the  Government  has  been  funding  a  scholarship  scheme  to  assist  at  least  70 \ncandidates  annually  to  meet  the  required  certified  public  accountant  (CPA)  accreditation. \nSubprogram 2 will continue to support this scholarship scheme. \n \n \n ", "      13   \n \nB.  Emerging Challenges and Opportunities  \n \n21.  Underdeveloped Commercial and Institutional Framework. As in other developing \neconomies, the fundamental weaknesses that stifle financial sector development in Cambodia \nstem mainly from its underdeveloped commercial and institutional framework, low formalized \nenterprise development, and limited human capacity and technical expertise. The court system \nlacks the judicial capacity to enforce contracts and resolve commercial disputes on a timely and \nconsistent basis. This affects public and investor confidence in the sector. Enterprises that have \nenjoyed many years of operating without an established rule of law prefer to remain informal. \nThe majority of participants in the real sector are reluctant to enter into any form of formal \nfinancial transactions for fear of being exposed to the tax authorities. To help mitigate these \nissues, there are efforts to get the National Assembly to adopt the remaining commercial laws, \nhave  the  Government  establish  a  commercial  court  with  supporting  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms, and enhance institutional and technical capacity.  \n \n22.  Emerging  Risks  and  Anticorruption  Initiatives.  Previous decades of conflict and \nisolation have resulted in weak governance and perceived high corruption. The transition from a \ncentrally controlled to a market-led economy and the speedy implementation of changes creates \nnew forms of risk and accompanying opportunities for corruption. The presence of international \nbanks, the offer of more sophisticated services to depositors, and the increase in lending \ndemonstrate investors\u2019 increasing confidence in Cambodia's financial system. Nevertheless, \nawareness of potential problems must be heightened within both the public and financial sectors \nand new ways pursued of mitigating risks.  \n \n23.  Rapid Expansion of Bank Lending. Starting from a relatively small base, credit to the \nprivate sector has been expanding very rapidly, from an already high year-on-year rate of 46% \nat end-June 2007 to 76% at end-December 2007, and further to 102% by end-June 2008 \n(Figure 8). Total liquidity has also been fueled by increased capital inflows, resulting in the \nincrease of net official international reserves from $1.4 billion at end-September 2007 to $1.6 \nbillion at end-December 2007, and further to $2.0 billion toward end-June 2008. Broad money \ngrew at an annual rate of 60% to December 2007, then dropped to 31.4% in August 2008. The \nbanking system is still in a position of excess unrestricted liquidity, equivalent to almost 22% of \ntotal deposits after July 2008. With real economic growth in the neighborhood of 8%, this excess \nliquidity has been creating demand pressures reflected in the acceleration of inflation. Along \nwith foreign direct investment inflows, rapid credit expansion is adding to growth in real estate \nand construction investment that has been fueled by rising property prices. Credit, which is \nconcentrated in a few banks, is almost entirely collateralized against the booming real estate \nmarket. Some banks\u2019 assets are increasingly vulnerable to real estate risks. NBC has issued \nguidelines  to  help  improve  banks\u2019  classification  and  reporting  of  exposure  to  housing, \nconstruction, and real estate loans. It also introduced a 15% ceiling on commercial bank credit \nto real estate trading with effect from June 2008. While reported system-wide nonperforming \nloans remain below 5%, there are concerns about the quality of asset classification. The rapid \ncredit expansion reinforces the critical importance of strong banking supervision and enforcing \ncompliance with prudential regulations while giving priority to assessing asset quality. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "14   \n \n \n \nFigure 8: Credit to the Private Sector \n9   120\n \n \n \n90\n \n  6\n \n \nKR trillion \nT rillion riel 60 % \n \n \n  3\n  30\n \n \n \n \n0 0\n \n22000033           22000044           22000055            22000066           22000077     JuMnaer-2-200080 8\n \n  Year\n \nLevel Growth\n \n \n \nSource: National Bank of Cambodia, National Institute of Statistics, Staff Estimates. \n \n \n24.  Bank  Supervision  and  Vulnerability  to  Shocks.  Regulatory standards have been \ngradually  improved  and  relevant  prudential  regulations  added  to  maintain  NBC\u2019s  primary \nobjective of enhancing the banking system\u2019s soundness. Moreover, NBC\u2019s capacity for off-site \nsupervision of banks has been upgraded and strengthened. All banks adopted a uniform chart \nof accounts in 2004 and commenced publishing their annual audited financial reports in 2005. \nAt the end of 2006, NBC\u2019s Bank Supervision Department published its second annual report \nproviding a very detailed and comprehensive assessment of the banking system. NBC has \nasked external auditors of each bank to undertake a comprehensive review of loan portfolios to \nJune 2008 and provide their opinions on the quality of those portfolios and the application of \nprudential regulations by end-September 2008. In an effort to further strengthen and consolidate \nthe banking system, NBC issued a directive in September 2008 requiring commercial banks that \nare owned by nonbank entities or individuals to increase their minimum capital to the equivalent \nof $36.5 million by 2010. These developments are evidence that NBC is serious about bank \nsoundness and has made significant progress to promote market transparency and establish a \nsound regulatory and efficient supervisory regime to enhance the banking system\u2019s integrity. \nAlthough enforcement of prudential regulations is improving, compliance with those regulations \nremains uneven. NBC aims, however, to enforce full compliance during FSP II implementation.  \n \nC.  Lessons \n25.  Key lessons from FSP I, Subprogram 1 of FSP II, and the associated TA projects to the \nsector include the following: \n \n(i)  Long-term perspective. Adoption of the medium-term blueprint for the financial \nsector meant that the Government had a set of long-term objectives to guide and \nshape  medium-term  policy  design  and  implementation.  Changes  in  the ", "      15   \n \nunderlying policy environment necessitated an update of the blueprint, and in \nFebruary 2007 the updated blueprint, known as the FSDS for 2006\u20132015, was \nadopted. The close consultative process involving the Government, ADB, and \nother  development  partners  strengthened  the  Government\u2019s  ownership  and \nincreased the potential for funding agency buy-in.  \n \n(ii)  Flexibility in design. Financial sector reforms are complex and involve major \nchanges  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  institutional  arrangements, \nfinancial  infrastructure,  and  human  capacity.  Hence,  sufficient  time  must  be \nallocated  to  program  implementation.  Design  flexibility  is  also  a  key \nconsideration. The use of the program cluster approach under FSP I provided the \nopportunity to refine the proposed policy actions for succeeding subprograms to \nreflect the Government\u2019s achievements, changes in the policy environment, and \nlessons from the previous subprograms. FSP II has also adopted the cluster \napproach, with each of the four subprograms to be processed annually. This \nprovides  the  flexibility  to  address  new  macroeconomic  developments  and \nemerging risks to the financial sector.  \n \n(iii)  TA  resources.  Under  FSP  I,  the  Government  adopted  legal,  policy,  and \ninstitutional measures, many of which were relatively new concepts and therefore \nrequired  extensive  coordination  and  consultation  to  ascertain  stakeholders\u2019 \nunderstanding, acceptance, and likely adoption of the new measures. Substantial \nTA support was necessary to ensure that best practices were incorporated and \nthen consolidated throughout implementation to achieve the intended results. \nFSP II has also identified a set of TA projects to help implement the medium-term \nprogram. Individual consultants have been selected not only on merit but also on \ntheir perceived ability to work well with local counterpart staff and sensitivity to \nthe local culture. These criteria are considered essential for successful transfer of \nknowledge. \n \n(iv)  National and commune council elections. Implementation of subprograms 2 \nand 3 of FSP I was delayed by elections. The commune and national elections \naffected the passage of the draft laws through the Council of Ministers and \nNational  Assembly  and  subsequently  affected  the  achievement  of  targets  in \nrelation to those laws. This is a lesson for FSP II Subprogram 2 design, as the \nnext national general election was held on 27 July 2008. \n \n(v)  Emerging  risks.  The  transition  from  a  centrally  controlled  to  a  market-led \neconomy creates new forms of risk. The presence of international banks, the \noffer of more sophisticated services to depositors (credit and debit cards for \nautomatic  teller  machines  and  electronic  funds  transfer  systems),  and  the \nincrease in lending demonstrate increasing investor confidence in Cambodia's \nfinancial system. With these encouraging developments, however, come new \nrisks and challenges\u2014such as lack of discipline over the use of credit cards, lax \napplication  of  credit  underwriting  and  portfolio  management  policies,  and \ninappropriate safety nets for users of electronic cards. Strengthening awareness \nof potential risks within both the public and the financial sectors is therefore \nimportant. Similarly, new ways for mitigating risks must be pursued.  \n   \n \n \n ", "16   \n \n \nVI.  THE PROPOSED SUBPROGRAM \n \n26.  Links  between  Subprograms.  Following  approval  of  the  FSP  II  cluster  and \nSubprogram 1 in December 2007, the momentum of implementing the policy reforms within the \nFSP II medium-term framework has been maintained. As a continuation of reforms initiated \nunder Subprogram 1, Subprogram 2 has 14 key reform actions that the Government began \nimplementing  in  January  2008.  All  have  been  completed  prior  to  Board  circulation. \nDisbursement will follow loan effectiveness. Subprogram 3 has been designed with 11 triggers \nand 11 milestones to continue the policy reforms initiated under subprograms 1 and 2 within the \nfour broad objectives of the medium-term framework that are intended to (i) improve confidence \nand financial intermediation, (ii) maintain financial stability, (iii) promote good governance, and \n(iv) enhance efficiency of the financial sector. Implementation of Subprogram 3 will commence \nin January 2009 and will be processed for Board approval and disbursement in December 2009. \nReform measures may be added to subprograms 3 and 4 as necessary within the medium-term \nframework after duly considering the Government\u2019s social and economic achievements and \nchanges in the macro policy environment.   \n \n27.  Refined Policy Framework. With recent developments in Cambodia\u2019s macroeconomic \nand financial sectors, and through extensive consultation between ADB and the Government, \nnew policy triggers and milestone were added. To address the rising level of inflation, NBC has \ndoubled the minimum reserve requirement imposed on banks from the current 8% to 16% with \neffect from July 2008 in a bid to absorb some of the excess liquidity. NBC has also relaxed \nsome restrictions on capital outflows, by allowing, upon verification, commercial banks to invest \na proportion of their surplus funds abroad where they can earn higher rates of return. Both have \nbeen added to the policy triggers for Subprogram 2. While the liquidity position of a few small \nbanks  may  be  temporarily  affected  by  the  increase  in  reserve  requirement,  NBC  has \nencouraged the Bankers Association to initiate an interbank market. The NBC indicated that \nfurther measures would be considered if doubling the reserve requirement together with the \nrelaxation of capital outflows was not sufficient to achieve the objective of moderating inflation.  \n \nA.  Progress in the Implementation of Policy Actions under Subprograms 1 and 2 \n1.  Improve Confidence and Financial Intermediation \na.  1.1: Improve Financial Services and the Payments, Clearance, and     \nSettlement System \n28.  A payment, clearance, and settlement system is necessary to achieve modern payment \nsystems and service outreach; for development of money and interbank markets; and to support \nmacroeconomic  policy  implementation.  The  vast  majority  of  transactions  in  Cambodia  are \nconducted in cash rather than by check, and cash transactions are reckoned to be mainly in \ndollars. Checks, mainly used by companies and a few individuals who maintain bank accounts, \nare manually cleared and settled through clearinghouses operated by NBC (in Phnom Penh, \nSiem Reap, and Sihanoukville, with no electronic link between them). Checks are presented \neach morning at 9:30, and dishonored checks flow back through the system at 3:00 p.m. \nSettlement from clearing operations is recorded in the NBC books at each branch office. In view \nof  this  current  manual  system,  NBC  places  high  priority  on  upgrading  the  payment  and \nsettlement  system  because  it  will  help  build  confidence,  enhance  growth  in  financial \nintermediation and outreach, and encourage product and service innovation. Further, the rapidly \ngrowing economy is straining the current manual system; an upgraded system is required to \nsupport the larger, more complex financial transactions in the economy; and moving from the ", "      17   \n \ncash-based  to  a  check-based  treasury  accounts  system  would  enhance  public  financial \nmanagement capacities throughout government.  \n \n29.  In  2005,  Cambodia  enacted  the  Law  on  Negotiable  Instruments  and  Payment \nTransactions, which provides a legal basis for negotiable instruments such as checks, bills of \nexchange,  and  promissory  notes,  plus  regulation  of  payment  systems.  The  process  for \nmodernizing the national payments, clearance, and settlement system started in 2006 when \nNBC established the Payments Policy Unit (PPU). With technical support from ADB, NBC \ndeveloped a road map for modernizing the payments, clearance, and settlement system. Staff \nof the PPU consulted with banks to obtain their input on the unit\u2019s initiatives and to garner \nsupport  for  implementing  the  proposed  road  map.  Under  Subprogram  1,  NBC  signed  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  each  commercial  bank  endorsing  the  road  map  to \nmodernize the national payment, clearance, and settlement system. \n \n30.  NBC continues to implement key actions of phase I of the road map to modernize the \npayment, clearance, and settlement system under Subprogram 2. With a long-term payment \nexpert funded by ADB, the PPU commenced discussions with banks on standardization of \nchecks, on an interbank switch to handle retail electronic payments, and to identify practical \nsolutions  to  enhance  funds  transfer  and  faster  bank  settlement.  A  prakas  on  check \nstandardization was issued by NBC in September 2008 after it was reviewed by all banks. An \ninterbank switch was launched on 28 August 2008 between four banks. The shared visa switch \nis a positive beginning and may develop into a more inclusive and beneficial system in the \nfuture. To enhance funds transfer and early settlement, the PPU has been evaluating a credit \nremittance payment instrument designed with suitable flexibility to be used as a direct funds \ntransfer instrument; as a direct credit; and as a direct debit instrument for government salary \npayment, utility payments, and settlement between banks. Since Cambodia presently operates \non  a  decentralized  basis,  with  every  bank  maintaining  both  riel  and  US  dollar  settlement \naccounts at each provincial NBC, this interim solution is considered pragmatic. The external \nadvice regarding the importance of a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) has not received \nparallel practical consideration because a core requirement of any RTGS is that bank settlement \naccounts are centralized so that the central RTGS has a total view, and total management, of \nthe  respective  commercial  bank\u2019s  credit  and  liquidity  exposure  on  a  real-time  basis. \nCentralization of commercial bank settlement accounts has not been considered by NBC, and it \ncannot be reasonably implemented until the new core banking system is implemented and \nrolled out to all branches sometime near the end of 2010. \n \nb.  1.2: Enhance Consumer Access to Credit and Market Confidence \n31.  To improve the quality of credit underwriting and portfolio management, and to boost the \nconfidence  in  the  banking  system,  a  credible  credit  information  system  and  supporting \nregulations are needed. With close cooperation between NBC and the Bankers Association, a \npilot online credit information sharing system (CIS) was established in August 2006 to support \nthe credit appraisal processes of participating banks. Rules, regulations, procedures, and a \ngoverning structure are in place, but implementation has not met expectations. Participating \nbanks have reported that since introduction of the CIS they have had difficulty uploading data \nand also accessing the information online. A number of actions have been taken under the \nSmall-and Medium Enterprise Development Program9 to improve the software system and build \n                                                 \n9\n ADB. 2004.

Several additions have been made to the \nsystem to allow \u201cno cases to report\u201d as a quick option for participating banks, which can then \ntrigger  a  more  focused  follow-up  by  the  CIS  steering  committee.  Subprogram  1  helped \nfamiliarize stakeholders with the system while addressing important changes to the system and \nto the governing structure of the CIS to enhance its effectiveness. The NBC will continue to help \neliminate  the  systematic  issues  while  strengthening  bank  compliance  and  ensuring  the \nusefulness of the system.  \n \n32.  The orderly development and expansion of the financial market requires knowledgeable \ncustomers as well as financially sound providers of financial services. It requires customers to \nbe able to make informed decisions on the services they need and what financial institutions \nthey should be requesting to undertake their financial transactions. Since 2005, all banks have \nbeen required to publish their audited financial statements to allow the general public to make \ninformed judgments regarding where to place their deposits and with which banks to transact. \nSeveral banks have published these annual audited financial reports on their own websites. \nFollowing recent high credit growth in the banking system, NBC had requested all bank auditors \nto undertake a comprehensive portfolio review as of end-December 2007. These audit reports \nwere completed by the end of June 2008. Subprogram 2 supported NBC in its efforts to promote \nbank  transparency  by  requiring  all  audited  financial  statements  of  banks  as  well  as  new \nprudential regulations to be published on the NBC website.  \n \nc.  1.3: Develop Interbank Market and Tradable Government Securities \n33.  The Law on Government Securities, enacted in January 2007, provides a framework for \nthe efficient issuance and management of government securities. This market will in turn ensure \nthat the Government\u2019s financing needs and payment obligations are met at the lowest possible \ncost, and it will provide key information to financial sector participants through the development \nof a yield curve. NBC has been assigned the role of maintaining the registry function for the \nissuance of government securities. NBC has established the registry and trained the staff on its \noperation and procedures under Subprogram 2.  \n \nd.  1.4: Promote Outreach in the Formal Sector  \n34.  Banking activities in rural areas, although not fully developed, are improving with MFIs \nproviding most of the formal financial services. The formal microfinance industry has undergone \na transition from the development model to a fully commercial model, although some funding is \nstill channeled from aid organizations and their affiliates. Nevertheless, by some estimates, the \ninformal sector still has a greater share by value and number of transactions undertaken within \nthe economy (especially among the poor and remote rural population) than the formal sector, \nwhich  comprises  registered  banks  and  both  licensed  and  registered  MFIs.  At  present,  no \nreliable data is available on the actual size and scale of the informal financial sector. An \nunderstanding of the size and depth of the informal sector outside of the formal financial sector \nneeds to be established to help determine the required policies, both macro and micro, and \namount  of  assistance  needed  to  develop  this  sector.  A  survey  would  be  useful  to  gather \ninformation on nonlicensed MFIs and moneylenders outside the formal sector and their impact \non the economy. It would include data on size, scale, and scope while covering products and \nservices offered, transaction costs, and locations serviced. NBC (for licensing and supervision \npurposes) and MEF (policy formulation) have agreed to jointly undertake this survey under \nSubprogram 2. Two months\u2019 technical support has been provided to assist both agencies. The \nreport of the survey was discussed at a series of workshops in September 2008. \n ", "      19   \n \n2.  Maintain Stability in the Financial Sector \na.  2.1: Update the Legal and Regulatory Framework for Banks \n35.  As part of Cambodia\u2019s efforts to strengthen prudential supervision, update regulations, \nand ensure stability, NBC has issued regulations (i) on large exposures of banks and financial \ninstitutions, and (ii) to amend the prakas on licensing of commercial and specialized banks \nunder Subprogram 1. Further, because the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions was \nenacted in 1999, a comprehensive review of this law is needed to effectively address the \nfeatures of a changing domestic market and the reality of increasing international economic \nintegration. The review, with technical assistance from ADB under Subprogram 2, will take into \nconsideration consumer protection in connection with the use of debit and credit cards, bank \nsecrecy provisions to support development of the CIS, procedures for administering distressed \nand insolvent banks, and protection or immunity of bank regulators. Based upon the findings of \nthis review, a revised and updated law is to be submitted to the Council of Ministers and the \nNational Assembly during FSP II.  \n \nb.  2.2: Strengthen Bank Supervision Capacity and Adopt Measures to \nSustain Financial Stability \n36.  Updating and upgrading skills is a priority area that must be an ongoing feature of \ndevelopment and the deepening of the financial system. New risks will emerge requiring that \nskills  development  and  training  be  pursued  in  tandem  with  these  developments.  NBC  will \ncontinue to strengthen and upgrade the capacity of its own supervision staff to be able to \neffectively manage these developments. At the same time, NBC recognizes that the financial \nsector  is  still  in  an  early  stage  of  development  and  thus  will  strengthen  its  surveillance \nmechanisms.  The  IMF  has  been  providing  a  resident  adviser  to  help  develop  the  off-site \ncapability of the bank supervision staff and will continue to provide support to 2010. With TA for \n$1.7 million approved together with Subprogram 1, ADB has been providing technical support to \nhelp  NBC  undertake  regular  on-site  examinations  of  banks.  During  Subprogram  2,  NBC \nevaluated the progress on capacity building support to bank supervision and again emphasized \nthe need for ADB support for bank on-site supervision. This is very important in view of the rapid \nincrease in the number and size of loans and concern with the quality of information reported by \nthese  banks.  ADB  is  proposing  TA  together  with  Subprogram  2  to  ensure  that  this  very \nimportant area of NBC\u2019s work is further strengthened. \n \n37.  NBC has formulated remedial measures, broadly anchored on the policy matrix and \nprogram policy framework, covering stronger sanctions to address potential vulnerabilities in the \nbanking  system.  NBC  will  closely  monitor  progress  with  implementation  of  the  remedial \nmeasures, and ADB will regularly review progress reports. Under Subprogram 1, NBC has \n(i) assessed  and  identified  capacity  building  needs  for  banking  supervision,  and  (ii) \nstrengthened surveillance and undertaken prompt corrective measures for banks that are not \nconforming to the laws and prudential regulations. NBC continues to require nonconforming \nbanks to provide progress reports and promptly undertake corrective measures, and these \nreports have been discussed with ADB missions. Further, NBC has reviewed its regulations to \nstrengthen good corporate governance, including the requirement for fit and proper testing of \nkey  bank  management  covering  specific  banking  qualifications  and  experience  under \nSubprogram 2. The regulation on corporate governance including the requirements for fit and \nproper test of key bank management has been formally issued as a prakas in October 2008. \n \n ", "20   \n \n \n38.  As a reflection of rapid economic growth, domestic liquidity has been rising rapidly, from \na very small base, partly fueled by the surge in capital inflows from foreign direct investments \nand by the rapid growth of credit to the private sector. Inflation has been sparked by supply-side \nshocks and surged from an annual rate of 10.8% in December 2007 to 25.1% in June 2008. The \ndomestic excess liquidity needs to be mopped up to avoid fueling an inflationary spiral. Under \nSubprogram 2, NBC doubled the reserve requirement from 8% to 16% in July 2008 to help \nreturn  bank  lending  to  sustainable  levels,  and  favorably  considered  applications  from \ncommercial banks to place excess reserves abroad with prudentially approved counterparties. \nPrior to introducing the above measures, NBC consulted the IMF in March 2008 and the \nBankers Association in April 2008, neither of which had any objection to the measures. NBC \nhas  also  encouraged  the  Bankers  Association  to  start  interbank  lending  to  finance  any \ntemporary liquidity requirements. NBC will continue to provide periodic macroeconomic and \nfinancial data for ADB to monitor the performance of the financial sector.  \n \nc.  2.3: Strengthen Prudential Supervision and Regulations for \nMicrofinance Institutions \n39.  Appropriate financial regulation and supervision are essential to build resilience against \nfinancial crisis. Similarly, providing incentives and guidance to financial institutions could further \nenhance their operations. NBC made significant progress in building the regulatory framework \nfor licensing and supervising registered MFIs. It established a division for prudential supervision \nof MFIs within the Banking Supervision Department and it issued several prudential regulations \nin the form of prakas. Division staff has had some training through technical support10 from ADB \nto undertake off-site and, to a limited extent, on-site supervision. Under Subprogram 1, NBC has \nissued  regulations  to  amend  the  prakas  on  the  licensing  of  microfinance  institutions.  The \naccompanying TA for Subprogram 1 also provided technical support to help strengthen NBC\u2019s \nsupervision  of  MFIs.  NBC  issued  additional  regulations  covering  MFIs  that  can  mobilize \nvoluntary savings and manage foreign exchange risks in December 2007 and early 2008, \nrespectively. The accompanying TA for Subprogram 2 will continue ADB\u2019s support to strengthen \noff-site and on-site supervision of the growing MFI subsector. \n    \nd.  2.4: Enhance Legal Foundation to Support Financial and \nCommercial Transactions \n40.  For financial transactions to develop beyond basic, short-term, and mainly cash-based \ntransactions, a legal framework for commerce and finance must be developed, updated, and \nimplemented.  Progress  in  preparing  and  enacting  a  number  of  components  of  the  legal \nframework for financial and commercial transactions has been significant. This includes the \ninsurance law, accounting and auditing law, commercial enterprises law, negotiable instruments \nand  payment  transactions  law,  commercial  arbitration  law,  secured  transactions  law, \ngovernment securities law, civil procedures code, law on anti-money laundering and combating \nthe financing of terrorism, and insolvency law. Under Subprogram 1, MEF submitted the draft \nlaw on nongovernment securities to the National Assembly and on 12 September 2007 the \nNational Assembly adopted the law. Most of the enacted laws have been implemented, and \ntraining curricula have been introduced at selected legal faculties to train legal practitioners and \njudges on these new principles.  \n                                                 \n10\n ADB. 2005.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Subprogram III of \nthe Financial Sector Program. Manila (Loan 2185-CAM). ", "      21   \n \n \n41.  Laws that were recently enacted require the adoption of implementing sub-decrees \nunder  Subprogram  2.  The  Government  has  developed  the  sub-decree  for  the  secured \ntransactions law. ADB has also provided technical support to help the Ministry of Commerce \n(MOC)  complete  the  drafting  of  a  new  law  on  commercial  contracts.  The  new  law  would \nsupplement the Civil Code provisions with regard to contract law and will include general \nprovisions relating to agencies and franchising. The law will help increase reliance on and \nconfidence in the use of written commercial contracts in Cambodia for a variety of business \ntransactions.  Subprogram  2  continued  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  review \nCambodia\u2019s requirements for a detailed set of rules for commercial transactions, review relevant \ninternational models and approaches, and help draft a new harmonized law on commercial \ncontracts. Submission of the draft law to the Council of Ministers and National Assembly is \nexpected during subprograms 3 and 4, respectively.  \n \n3.  Promote Good Governance \na.  3.1: Promote International Initiatives on Anti-Money Laundering and \nCombating the Financing of Terrorism \n42.  Work to implement an anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of \nterrorism (CFT) regime in Cambodia is supporting international deterrence efforts and promotes \nstandard  governance  principles.  This  will  help  build  market  confidence  and  discipline. \nThroughout 2005 and 2006, NBC and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre \n(AUSTRAC)  conducted  joint  training  workshops  on  AML  and  CFT  in  general,  including \nprocedures to assess suspicious transactions reports and the roles of compliance officers at \nbanks  and  financial  institutions.  They  also  conducted  an  AML  and  CFT  assessment. \nSubprogram 1 supported the Government in its successful efforts to adopt the law on AML and \nCFT in 2007. This was followed by adoption of sub-decrees to appoint the board of directors \nand secretary general to head the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and to formally establish the \nFIU with 5 staff members during Subprogram 2. ADB, World Bank, AUSTRAC, Asia Pacific \nGroup on Money Laundering, the Bank Negara Malaysia, and other development partners are \nproviding technical assistance to help the Government implement the AML and CFT initiatives. \n \nb.  3.2: Enhance Corporate Governance and Transparency in the \nInsurance Industry \n43.  Building  consumer  confidence  in  insurance  as  a  service  will  first  require  public \nunderstanding of the insurance business and the services it can provide. Business must be \nconducted  as  transparently  as  possible  to  protect  consumers  and  ensure  that  information \nprovided to the general public and the regulator is accurate. The goal for all participants in the \nindustry is to raise their operations to international standards. The reinsurer and regulator are \nresponsible for reinforcing these standards. The Government and the insurance association can \ncontribute  to  the  insurance  industry\u2019s  development  by  increasing  public  awareness  about \ninsurance.  The  regulator  can  take  a  leadership  role  by  ensuring  transparency  within  the \nindustry, as well as for the general public and other government ministries. Under Subprogram \n1, MEF issued regulations on (i) premium rates for fire insurance, and (ii) licensing of general \nand life insurance companies. MEF also issued prakas covering corporate governance and \nsolvency for insurance companies in early 2008. A prakas on accounting guidelines for general \ninsurance was discussed with international accounting firms, the National Accounting Council, \nand the insurance firms, and this has been adopted under Subprogram 2.  \n \n ", "22   \n \n \nc.  3.3: Establish Commercial Dispute Resolution Mechanism \n44.  To promote good governance and boost public confidence in the financial system, the \nGovernment enacted the law on commercial arbitration in 2006, and the draft sub-decree is \nbeing reviewed by the Council of Ministers. Work to establish a national arbitration center will \nbegin after adoption of the sub-decree. The arbitration center will improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency  of  the  commercial  and  financial  systems,  as  well  as  provide  the  commercial \ncommunity with a cost-effective non-judicial process for dispute resolution. With greater public \nawareness  of  the  arbitration  center\u2019s  functioning,  confidence  in  the  financial  sector  should \nincrease. Before the center can commence operation, however, members of the judiciary, legal \nprofession, and management personnel will need to be trained. TA under Subprogram 2 will \nsupport MOC\u2019s efforts to establish a national arbitration center by adopting the implementing \nsub-decree along with appropriate rules and procedures for commercial arbitration. \n \nd.  3.4: Strengthen the Accounting Institutions and Professional \nCapacity of Members \n45.  For  efficient  financial  intermediation,  financial  market  infrastructure  needs  to  be \ndeveloped\u2014particularly accounting and auditing systems plus qualified personnel to implement \nthem. In 2005, only 10 locally qualified accountants were working in Cambodia and the MEF \nintroduced an initiative to improve accounting and auditing capacity through a Government-\nfunded scholarship scheme to assist at least 70 candidates per year to acquire the qualification \nneeded to become members of the Kampuchea Institute of Certified Public Accountants and \nAuditors.  These  scholarships  were  initially  awarded  to  government  civil  servants  only.  A \nsignificant number of awardees dropped out for various reasons, and results were very poor. \nThrough policy dialogue, this was opened to the general public and selection is now based on \nmerit.  The  scholarships  were  opened  to  the  public  in  2006,  and  the  results  have  greatly \nimproved. Under Subprogram 2, MEF continued to support this public scholarship scheme. \n \n4.  Enhance Efficiency in the Financial Sector \na.  4.1: Computerize and Integrate Key Operating Functions of NBC  \n46.  NBC\u2019s current information technology system is not well integrated across the bank, \nresulting in duplication and inefficiency. NBC would gain considerable benefits in terms of its \nability to provide a more efficient service to the banking sector by implementing an integrated \nsystem that initially links the accounting department to the cash management functions in the \nissues department, the customer account management in the banking operations department, \nand  the  foreign  exchange  transactions  in  the  exchange  management  department.  Under \nSubprogram 1, NBC reviewed and adopted the information technology architecture model for a \ntotal estimated cost of $4.0 million. MEF has allocated a $4.0 million grant to NBC to finance the \nnew system, including the required hardware, and ADB provided two international consultants to \nassist NBC in procuring, designing, and installing the system. Under Subprogram 2, NBC has \nreviewed its management information system and commenced the procurement process to \nacquire the software and hardware for an integrated accounting system.  \n \n47.  Implementation by NBC will continue in subsequent subprograms with technical support \nfrom ADB. Benefits are foreseen, too, in providing improved application software for other parts \nof the bank, in particular departments that do not need to link to the core banking system in real \ntime, such as banking supervision, personnel, and economic research and statistics. Eventually \nthe system should also link the accounting department to the NBC branches, thus promoting ", "      23   \n \nfinancial  deepening  and  operating  efficiency.  A  wide  area  network  infrastructure  will  be \nestablished at NBC to facilitate real time clearing and settlement operations.  \n \nb.  4.2: Upgrade the Capacity of Microfinance Institution Staff \n48.  Finding  adequately  trained  and  skilled  people  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  growing \nmicrofinance  industry  is  an  ongoing  challenge.  Growth  puts  pressure  on  the  delivery  and \ncustomer sides of the business. Capacity development structures are needed within MFIs. In \nconsultation with the association of MFIs, the Center for Banking Studies (CBS) will undertake a \nreview of its curriculum with the objective of expanding the scope of training to include all \naspects of MFI business and to increase management awareness of liquidity risk, interest rate \nrisk,  concentration  of  credit  risk,  and  foreign  exchange  risk.  Technical  assistance  under \nSubprogram 2 is helping to review and upgrade the CBS curriculum.  \n \nB.  Financing Plan \n49.  The Government has requested a loan of $10,300,000 equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  for  Subprogram  2.  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  a  single  tranche  upon \nsatisfactory compliance with specific conditions indicated in the policy matrix. The loan will have \na 24-year term, including an 8-year grace period. The interest rate will be 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The ADB funds are to support the reforms outlined \nin the development policy letter of 26 October 2007 and the policy matrix as updated.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management  \n50.  NBC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  MEF  and  MOC  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies for Subprogram 2. The financial sector steering committee will continue to coordinate \nprogram implementation among government ministries and agencies concerned. To ensure \ntimely program implementation, the committee, comprising senior officers from MEF, MOC, and \nNBC, will meet as required to review progress reports from the technical working group and \nconsider pending issues. The committee will propose concrete actions to resolve those issues. \nA senior NBC officer has been appointed as program director to assist MEF, MOC, and NBC in \ncoordinating  day-to-day  program  implementation.  The  program  director  will  be  required  to \nsubmit quarterly progress reports on Subprogram 2 implementation. \n \n2.  Period of Implementation  \n51.  The implementation period for Subprogram 2 is from January to December 2008. The \nGovernment has implemented all policy actions for the release of the single tranche. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n52.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \nduties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding a \nnegative  list  of  ineligible  items  (Appendix  5)  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. All procurement of goods and services produced in, and originating from, \nADB member countries will be made with due consideration to economy and efficiency, as well \nas in accordance with standard public sector procedures in Cambodia and normal private sector \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB. In accordance with provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification \n ", "24   \n \n \nof Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans (1998), the loan \nproceeds will be disbursed to the Government as the Borrower. The Government will certify that \n(i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible imports is equal to, or exceeds, the amount of ADB\u2019s \nprojected disbursements under the loan in a given period; and (ii) the loan proceeds will be \nutilized in a manner satisfactory to ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed based on the \ncertification provided by the Government, which confirms that the requirements for the loan \nhave been met. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. Subprogram 2 will provide for retroactive financing for \nexpenditures incurred by the Government up to 180 days prior to loan effectiveness.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n53.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the Policy on Combating \nMoney Laundering (2003) were explained to the Government. All relevant ADB guidelines and \nthe loan regulations were specifically brought to the attention and notice of the Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the Government to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, and service providers as they relate to the \nProgram. \n \n54.  An assessment of the country\u2019s public financial management systems was carried out to \nbetter understand the fiduciary risks and determine appropriate arrangements for the fiduciary \narrangements of Subprogram 2. Discussions were held with the Government during formulation \nof Subprogram 2 on the funds flow from NBC to MEF and the contribution of the ongoing public \nfinancial  management  reform  program  to  the  administration  of  loan  proceeds. 11  Very \nsatisfactory progress has been noted in revenue collections, with greater use of the banking \nsystem to streamline revenue collection and payment processes. The redesign of an integrated \nchart  of  accounts  and  budget  classification  has  been  substantially  completed  to  improve \nexpenditure  tracking  and  reporting.  As  part  of  efforts  to  improve  governance  and  reduce \ncorruption, the Government continues to place significant emphasis on strengthening the overall \npublic financial management system, internal systems (including internal audit functions), and \nthe functions of the National Audit Authority. The ongoing public financial management program, \nwhich started in 2004 and is supported by 10 development partners including ADB,12 has helped \nlower the fiduciary risk of the system. \n \n55.  A core component of Subprogram 2 focuses on promoting good governance, deterring \nmoney laundering and financing of terrorism, and implementing measures that will help deter \ncorruption in the overall economy (a good governance framework is in Supplementary Appendix \nA). Subprogram 2 includes measures to improve the management information system and \nreporting standards within NBC, banks, and MFIs; promote transparency of information released \nby banks and MFIs; improve compliance with and usefulness of the credit information sharing \n                                                 \n11\n Ministry of Economy and Finance. 2007.

Increasing use of payment instruments other than cash will particularly \nhelp discourage corruption at central, provincial, and district treasuries. These reforms will help \nkeep savers and investors informed, empower civil society to monitor the weaknesses in these \nfinancial institutions, and deter those who are vulnerable to corrupt activities. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n56.  The  Government  will  open  or  nominate  an  account  with  NBC  to  receive  the  loan \nproceeds for Subprogram 2. It will manage, operate, and liquidate the account in accordance \nwith terms satisfactory to ADB. ADB will retain the right to audit any account and records \nrelating to utilization of the loan proceeds.  \n \n6.  Program Performance Monitoring and Review \n57.  The program director (para. 50) will coordinate and submit quarterly progress reports on \npolicy and institutional reform implementation to the financial sector steering committee and \nADB. The reports will be submitted in such form and detail as ADB may request, and include (i) \nprogress made and problems encountered during the review period, (ii) steps taken or proposed \nto remedy problems encountered, and (iii) proposed detailed activities planned for the next \nreview period. The Government will inform ADB of outcomes of policy discussions with the IMF, \nWorld  Bank  Group,  and  bilateral  funding  agencies  having  implications  for  Subprogram  2 \nimplementation. \n \n58.  ADB, in cooperation with NBC, MEF, and MOC, will conduct semiannual reviews of \nprogram implementation progress and assess macroeconomic developments and their impacts \non the financial and related sectors of the economy. The Government and ADB will continue to \nengage in active policy dialogue throughout Subprogram 2 implementation on macroeconomic \nissues that may affect financial sector development and on additional reforms that may be \nnecessary or desirable for sustainable development of the financial sector. Not later than 4 \nmonths after completion of Subprogram 2, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a \nprogram completion report. \n \nVII.  SUBPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS \nA.   Benefits \n59.  With a rapidly growing commercial economy that requires a sound financial system to \nsustain economic growth, the Government, if it is to achieve long-term sustainable economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction, needs to develop the financial sector by mobilizing financial \nresources, channeling them to productive investments, and managing inherent risks. The Asian \nfinancial crisis of the 1990s provided many examples of the devastating impact that financial \ncrises can have on countries, wiping out several years of growth within a very short time. Thus, \nto promote economic growth, reduce poverty, and help Cambodia avoid financial crises, FSP II, \nSubprogram 2 will support the Government in its development agenda. \n \n60.  The policies supported by Financial Sector Program II Cluster\u2014Subprogram 2 will help \nreduce information asymmetry, improve governance, enhance financial stability, and improve \nefficiency in the financial sector. These factors will contribute to a more conducive environment \nfor continued financial market development. FSP II, Subprogram 2 is expected to help boost \nconfidence among market participants and, with improvements to the payments, clearance, and \n ", "26   \n \n \nsettlement system, financial intermediation will grow. That will result in a wider offering of \nproducts and services in urban and rural areas. A sound, more efficient, and diversified financial \nsector will support higher investments and productivity in the private sector. Together with \nbroader economic reforms, the reforms in the financial sector will contribute to higher economic \ngrowth. \n \nB.        Social and Environmental Safeguards \n61.  Subprogram 2 will not entail any involuntary resettlement or have a negative impact on \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement, \nimpact on indigenous people, and impact on the environment. Subprogram 2 is a general \nintervention aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth. In that respect, it is expected to \nhave an indirect positive effect on poverty reduction. A summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 6. \n \nC.    Assumptions and Risks \n62.  Financial  Sector  Program  II  Cluster\u2014Subprogram  2  assumes  political  stability  in \nCambodia and sustained implementation of sound macroeconomic policies by the Government. \nGiven Cambodia\u2019s encouraging results in the past decade, both these assumptions are valid \nand defensible. Implementation of Subprogram 2 could face a number of risks, however, for \nwhich mitigation measures have been put in place.  \n \n(i)  Challenges to sustaining economic growth. Cambodia\u2019s economic prospects \nmust  be  viewed  against  a  number  of  adverse  developments  in  the  external \nenvironment. The immediate impact of the financial crisis in the US and Europe, \nand the drying up there of liquidity in the commercial paper and related money \nand interbank markets, pose limited or no direct\u2014or indirect\u2014financial sector \nrisks to Cambodia\u2019s economy, either through balance sheets or liquidity factors, \nas  Cambodia\u2019s  banks  do  not  have  significant  exposure  to  borrowing  from \ninternational  banks  and  capital  markets  do  not  as  yet  exist.  However,  the \nslowdown in the global economy resulting from the fall in US and European \ngrowth rates has impacted on Cambodia\u2019s growth rate, initially through reduced \nexpansion of exports due to reduced demand for Cambodian garments. The \nrecent  unexpected  surge  in  international  energy  and  food  prices  has  fueled \nhigher domestic inflation in 2008, with potential knock-on effects for consumption \nand poverty, growth, and financial sector stability. In addition to foreign direct \ninvestment inflows, the rapid credit expansion is adding to growth in real estate \ninvestment and to rising property prices. This is causing the assets of some \nbanks to be increasingly vulnerable to real estate risks. The Government has \nintroduced a combination of fiscal and monetary measures that have helped to \nmoderate inflation and slow lending. Throughout Subprogram 2, the Government \nand  ADB  have  undertaken  periodic  reviews  of  macroeconomic  and  financial \ndevelopments to assess potential risks to the financial sector. These reviews will \ncontinue  through  the  program  period  for  Subprogram  3.  Budget  assistance \nthrough a series of program loans in 2008, including via this program, is being \nprovided to bolster the economy\u2019s resilience. The poverty impact of food price ", "      27   \n \nincreases is being mitigated through emergency assistance approved for this \npurpose.13   \n (ii)  Unexpected  political  disturbance.  Cambodia  has  been  enjoying  very  high \npolitical unity and stability for several years. The national election was conducted \npeacefully  on  27  July  2008,  as  was  the  swearing-in  ceremony  of  the  new \nGovernment on 25 September 2008. In anticipation of any delays in forming the \nnew Government, Subprogram 2 was designed to ensure that most of the legal \ndrafting that closely involves midlevel officials would be done prior to formation of \nthe  Government  so  that  draft  laws  and  sub-decrees  would  be  ready  for \nsubmission to the Council of Ministers once the new Government was sworn in.  \n(ii)   Weak  governance  and  corruption  in  the  sector.  Weak  governance  and \nincidents  of  corruption  could  erode  investor  confidence  and  prevent  the \nattainment of expected sector outcomes. The Government\u2019s National Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 2006\u20132010 views corruption as a threat to sustained growth \nand development of the country in general. Backed by an active development \ncommunity, the Government is taking an increasingly tougher stance against \ncorruption. The general consensus is that good governance and measures to \naddress  corruption  are  needed  for  a  successful  partnership  between  the \nGovernment  and  the  development  community.  This  was  considered  during \ndesign  of  the  program  cluster,  and  there  will  be  continuous  pursuit  of \nimprovements to the institutional governance structure, accounting disclosure \nstandards, financial transparency, complementary legislation, regulatory updates \nand enforcement, supervision, and surveillance of the financial sector.  \n(iv)  Weak institutional and human capacity. Some of the financial sector risks are \nassociated with weak institutional and human capacity. The same applies to the \nimplementation and enforcement of new laws and regulations. To mitigate those \nrisks,  training  programs  have  been  initiated  at  various  training  institutions \nestablished during FSP I. Financial Sector Program II Cluster - Subprogram 2 \nprovides financial support to the institutions to help update their curricula. The \nproposed advisory TA will help reduce the risks arising from weak capacity, \nespecially in the implementation of all prudential regulations. With these design \nsafeguards, the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to far outweigh any \ncosts. \n \nVIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n63.  A program of annual TA projects was identified to help implement the FSP II medium-\nterm program. Implementing TA for $1.7 million was approved with Subprogram 1 to support \nNBC, MEF, and MOC in implementing the policy and institutional reforms under Subprogram 2 \nand  some  of  the  reform  triggers  and  milestones  for  Subprogram  3.  In  response  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s request, ADB has prepared a TA project to support NBC, MEF, and MOC in \nimplementing key reform triggers for Subprogram 3. The TA is estimated to cost a total of \n$375,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance  $300,000  from  its  TA  funding  program  and  the \nGovernment  will  provide  the  remaining  $75,000  equivalent  in  the  form  of  office  space, \ncounterpart staff, and other support facilities.  \n \n64.  The  main  activities  of  the  TA  are  to  (i)  further  strengthen  on-site  supervision  and \nsurveillance of the banking system (4 person-months), (ii) help strengthen off-site and on-site \n                                                 \n13\n ADB. 2008.

A total of \n17 person-months  of  consulting  inputs,  comprising  11 international  and  6  national  person-\nmonths,  are  required.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  on  an  individual  basis  to \nimplement TA activities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time), using the competitive selection method. The TA\u2019s purpose, \noutputs, methodology, implementation arrangements, budget, and terms of references are in \nAppendix 7. NBC will be the Executing Agency, and MEF and MOC the implementing agencies. \nThe TA is scheduled to commence in February 2009 and be completed by January 2010. \n \nIX.  ASSURANCES \n65.  In addition to complying with and implementing the actions specified in the Subprogram \n2 policy matrix and standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the Loan Agreement: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  (a)  implement  the  policy  triggers  and  milestones  in \naccordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained in the medium-term \npolicy framework and as described in the development policy letter, and ensure \nsustainability of the reforms beyond the Subprogram 2 period; and (b) carry out \nall of its obligations as stipulated under the Loan Agreement in a timely manner.  \n(ii)  The  Government  will  undertake  all  reasonable  measures  to  implement  the \ntriggers (reform actions) set out in the medium-term policy framework, which are \nthe prerequisites for processing Subprogram 3. \n(iii)  The Government will keep ADB informed of, and will at least semiannually, and \nmore  frequently  as  requested,  exchange  views  on  the  progress  made  in \nimplementing Subprogram 2.

The development path in the 1990s reflected the period of liberal entry of financial \ninstitutions at a time when regulation and supervisory capacity were weak. The era was marked \nby  a  rapid  rise  in  the  number  of  joint  ventures,  locally  incorporated  family-owned  banks, \nbranches of foreign banks, and state-owned financial institutions. This resulted in most financial \ninstitutions  being  poorly  managed  and  almost  half  being  considered  technically  insolvent. \nSupported by an International Monetary Fund poverty reduction and growth facility that was \nphased out in 2003, the banking system relicensing program (i) introduced a legal framework for \nbanks and financial institutions, (ii) successfully closed all nonviable banks, (iii) relicensed the \nremaining  banks  under  strengthened  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  (NBC)  supervision \nrequirements, and (iv) initiated restructuring and privatization of the major state-owned foreign \ntrade  bank.  Cambodia\u2019s  financial  sector  remains  shallow  and  fragile  with  limited  financial \nintermediation and outreach. \n \n2.  At the end of June 2008, the formal financial system comprised NBC, 20 commercial \nbanks, 5 specialized banks, and 2 representative offices of foreign-based banks; 16 licensed \nand 26 registered microfinance institutions (MFIs); and 6 insurance companies. Cambodia has \nyet to establish bond or securities markets. The predominantly rural nature of the economy, high \ntransaction costs, inability of the real sector to put together bankable projects, and low creditor \nconfidence have been the main factors causing the low formal intermediation and outreach \nwithin  the  sector,  slow  development  in  nonbank  financial  institutions,  and  limited  range  of \nproducts and services being offered. \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s vision for the financial sector is for a sound, market-based system \nthat will enhance resource mobilization, ensure the effective allocation of financial resources, \nand  contribute  to  broad-based  sustainable  economic  growth  as  embodied  in  the  Financial \nSector Development Strategy (FSDS) 2006\u20132015. The FSDS recognizes that, for equitable \ngrowth to occur, a diversified, competitive, but prudentially sound financial system would play an \nimportant  role  in  national  development  by  ensuring  efficient  accumulation  and  effective \nallocation of financial resources. At the same time, expanding finance brings risks. Hence, when \npursuing financial development, a focus on prudential risk management, transparency, and \nuniform application of rules and regulations is needed. \n \n4.  Dominated  by  the  banking  system,  the  financial  sector  has  gone  through  major \nrestructuring and reforms since the mid-1990s. In 1996, NBC was established as the central \nbank following promulgation of the Law on the Organization and Conduct of the National Bank \nof Cambodia. In 1999, the Government enacted the Law on Banking and Financial Institutions, \nenabling NBC to undertake a relicensing program that brought about the closure of 16 nonviable \nbanks in 2002, raised capital requirements for the remaining banks to $13 million equivalent, \nand set the minimum capital adequacy requirement at 20% of risk-weighted assets (which was \nthen appropriately reduced to 15% in 2004). In an effort to further strengthen and consolidate \nthe banking system, NBC issued a directive in September 2008 requiring commercial banks that \nare owned by nonbank entities or individuals to increase their minimum capital to the equivalent \nof $36.5 million by 2010. The Financial Sector Development Blueprint,14 formulated and adopted \nin 2001, provided a clear set of objectives and a sequenced program of reforms in the financial \nsector.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  the  lead  development  partner  in \nsupporting the Government\u2019s efforts to implement the blueprint to improve financial soundness \n                                                 \n14\n ADB. 2001.

Manila ", "    Appendix 3  41\nand efficiency, restore confidence, attract a broader base of high-quality financial institutions, \nand broaden the sector\u2019s outreach within the blueprint framework. \n \n5.  The  economy  is  largely  cash-based  and  highly  dollarized.  Dollarization  emerged  in \nCambodia because public confidence in the local currency eroded following a series of shocks \nduring the conflict and financial mismanagement prior to 1989. In some instances, dollarization \nhas assisted development of the financial sector, but, in other respects, dollarization limits the \ntools  the  Government  can  use  in  its  monetary  policies.  With  recent  improvements  in \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  measures  taken  by  the  authorities  to  restore  confidence  in \ninstitutions and in the banking system, public confidence is growing but slowly, and dollarization \nremains high. In the absence of reliable data, the amount of dollars and other foreign currencies \ncirculating in Cambodia cannot be verified. Thai baht and Vietnamese dong banknotes are also \nwidely used in some of the provinces bordering Thailand and Viet Nam. The cash nature of the \neconomy means that even major transactions are settled in cash outside of the banking system \nand paper trails are minimal.  \n \n6.  The private sector is characterized by a high degree of informality, and it is dominated by \nthe informal sector. Enterprises that have enjoyed years of operating without established rule of \nlaw prefer to remain informal. The tax regime is still very open to negotiation and the majority of \nparticipants in the real sector, especially in rural areas, are reluctant to enter into any form of \nformal financial transactions for fear of being exposed to the tax authorities. Private enterprises \nare generally family owned with no separation between management and owners who usually \ndo not maintain proper records, including financial reports, that can be considered reliable.  \n \n7.  Banking System. No legal barriers are in place for the entry of foreign banks. At the end \nof June 2008, nine commercial banks had majority foreign ownership. The commercial banking \nsubsector at the end of June 2008 consists of 20 commercial banks, 5 specialized banks, and  \n2 representative offices of foreign-based banks. Despite the increase in the number of banks, \nhigh transaction costs and markups remain. Nevertheless, competition is starting to pick up and \nthere is some evidence of market segmentation emerging. With the exception of the Rural \nDevelopment Bank, the banking system is almost entirely owned by the private sector. Most \nbanks have established branches in other urban centers and are planning to open additional \noffices in those areas.  \n \n8.  To date most branches are concentrated in large urban centers, but this is expected to \nchange. ACLEDA bank, a former MFI, currently has branches in every province and a total of \n212 sites provide banking services. Canadia bank has 17 branches outside Phnom Penh. Five \nother banks have more than 3 branches outside Phnom Penh, including ANZ Royal bank (12 \nbranches) with automated teller machines at each of its branches. At the end of 2007, bank staff \ntotaled more than 6,869, with one bank (ACLEDA) employing 4,401 and other banks employing \nbetween 20 and 250. Technical capacity is still weak and most banks provide their own in-house \ntraining to complement the training programs offered by the Bankers Association. \n \n9.  Commercial banking is relatively small but growing quickly. The more aggressive and \nprogressive banks attained average year-on-year growth rates of 77% for credit and 74% for \ndeposits at the end of 2007. The number of commercial bank loans increased by 127% from \n2002 to total 209,053 at the end of June 2008. If these loans were all to individual borrowers, \nthen it would be the equivalent of providing loans to 1.5% of Cambodia\u2019s population. Total \nbanking assets represented about 38.75% of the estimated gross domestic product (GDP) in \n2007. The banking system is fairly concentrated, with about 77.63% of deposits held by the six \n ", "42  Appendix 3 \nlargest commercial banks. These six also accounted for about 84.6% of total loans at the end of \n2007.   \n \n10.  Commercial banks mainly offer simple services to retail and corporate customers in \nurban areas (time and term deposits, savings accounts, basic loans, domestic and cross-border \nwire transfers, foreign exchange, letters of credit, etc.). Specialized banks are not allowed by \nlaw to accept deposits, and commercial banks had about 603,992 depositors (more than 4% of \nthe total population) at the end of 2007. Most deposit products are short-term in nature and, as \na consequence, loan terms are also short (average 3 years) with high interest rates. Banks \ncontinue to rely on physical collateral and personal guarantee as loan security. More advanced \nbanking services are being introduced, such as electronic banking and private banking. As of \nthe end of 2007, 177 ATMs had been installed throughout the urban areas. Several banks have \nindicated that they plan to increase this number. \n \n11.  The  noncash  payment  system  is  very  small  and  of  limited  sophistication.  It  is \npredominantly paper-based and manual. NBC runs the clearinghouse, which operates in both \nriels and dollars. The riel clearinghouse has 19 members (NBC, Ministry of Economy and \nFinance [MEF], and 17 banks) and the dollar clearinghouse has 22 members (NBC and 21 \nbanks). Daily amounts passing through the clearinghouses average about $36 million, of which \nriel clearances represent only around 3%. About 1,811 checks are cleared each day, of which \naround 94% are drawn in dollars. The first clearance is at 9:30 a.m., with a second clearance at \n3:00 p.m. to handle returns. Banks bring their balances to the clearinghouse on flash drives. \nInterbank settlement is by check drawn on the banks\u2019 accounts with NBC. The enactment of the \nnegotiable instruments and payment transactions law in late 2005 and the issuance of key \nregulations  in  December  2006  provided  the  legal  framework  for  developing  the  payments \nsystem, introducing new negotiable instruments, and promoting the development of money and \ninterbank markets. \n \n12.  NBC\u2019s  principal  mission  is  to  formulate  and  implement  monetary  policy  aimed  at \nmaintaining price stability and economic development. Its main functions are to (i) act as the \nmonetary authority and conduct monetary policy (NBC has actively intervened in the riel foreign \nexchange market to deliver a stable exchange rate and ensure price stability in riels), (ii) act as \nthe sole issuer of the national currency (as such NBC has increased the number of currency \ndenominations and replaced worn and dirty bank notes), (iii) act as the supervisory authority of \nthe  banking  and  financial  system,  (iv)  oversee  the  payments  system  in  Cambodia,  and  \n(v) manage the international reserves of the country.    \n \n13.  The banking supervision program and standards have greatly improved since 2001 and \nbeen extended to cover all banks, a move made possible with the addition of skilled staff. \nPrudential supervision was enhanced with the adoption of the uniform chart of accounts by all \nbanks in 2004, and by the same banks making their annual audited financial statements publicly \navailable since 2005. Several banks have published these annual audited financial statements \non  their  own  websites.  In  2006,  NBC  enhanced  its  regulatory  and  supervisory  system  by \nimplementing an off-site supervision system known as Cambodian Bank Reporting for Prompt \nCorrective Action. The system enables staff to perform a regular analysis of off-site reports, to \nidentify  risks  faced  by  banks  and  infringements  caused  by  banks,  and  then  for  the  staff \nconcerned  to  recommend  immediate  actions  to  NBC  management.  The  development  and \nimplementation of the system has been supported by a resident advisor from the International \nMonetary Fund. NBC continues to undertake on-site inspection of each bank once a year. \n \n14.  Banking, along with other financial and commercial subsectors, continues to face high ", "    Appendix 3  43\ntransaction costs attributable to the lack of mechanisms to enforce contracts and absence of \nreliable information. The establishment of the credit information sharing system in 2006 should \nimprove the situation, but some time will be required to build a sufficient database. Dispute \nsettlement remains a major issue and, if unresolved, will continue to affect the degree of \ncertainty associated with financial and commercial transactions. Financial sector stakeholders \nwould undoubtedly welcome the operations of a commercial court and commercial arbitration \ncenter to provide a greater degree of certainty. \n \n15.  Microfinance  Subsector.  Microfinance  is  growing  rapidly,  with  assets  expanding \ngenerally at around 73% in 2007 and some institutions expanding at 146% per annum. The \nexpansion is allowing microfinance to support and grow the economy, especially in its target \nmarket of the poor and remote rural population. The microfinance subsector now comprises 16 \nlicensed  MFIs,  26  registered  rural  credit  operations,  and  around  60  nongovernment \norganizations  operating  unrestricted  across  the  whole  country.  Registration  and  licensing \ncommenced  in  2002.  A  number  have  transitioned  from  aid-focused  nongovernment \norganizations to commercial MFIs, and some were set up as commercial, profit-oriented MFIs \nfrom the outset. Most MFIs have plans to continue rapid expansion with the establishment of \nadditional branches and increased lending activities at existing branches. \n \n16.  As of the end of June 2008, MFIs had around 689,200 clients (about 4.9% of the total \npopulation) and loans outstanding with an average size of $250. The expansion in the net \nnumber of loans is currently around 32% per annum. Voluntary savings of MFIs are very small. \nLicensed MFIs have adopted a wide range of business models with good corporate governance \nand orderly market development to deliver their services and products. This was highlighted in \n2007, when Cambodian MFIs won 4 of 20 financial transparency awards presented by the \nConsultative Group to Assist the Poor.    \n \n17.  MFIs,  while  growing  rapidly,  have  major  challenges  to  expanding  their  services. \nAddressing these issues should assist them to continue to grow in a sound manner. MFIs face \ncompetition from informal operators in their markets. The scale of this competition is anecdotally \nsaid to exceed the size of the formal financial sector, but no reliable data is available to support \nthis view. A number of costs and challenges are imposed on the industry, such as nonresident \nwithholding tax, lack of a reliable method to track the use of certificates of title for collateral \nbetween institutions, and extremely limited access to domestic funding sources. Growth brings \nits own challenges, such as whether management is able to maintain control over business \nprocesses when the scale of operations begins to outstrip the capabilities of current systems \nand  processes.  Foreign  borrowing  does  bring  growth  and  benefits  in  terms  of  improved \ngovernance and transparency, but, at the same time, foreign borrowing brings growing foreign \nexchange risk as institutions increase their lending in the riel-based rural areas. \n \n18.  Moneychangers. In addition to banks, the Law on Foreign Exchange, 1997, allows \nindividuals and legal entities to undertake currency exchange if they register with NBC. They are \nnot allowed to undertake any other financial activity. As of the end of April 2008, the country had \n649 registered moneychangers (34 in Phnom Penh and 615 in the provinces). Statistics on the \ntransactions undertaken by moneychangers are not available. \n \n19.  Insurance Subsector. The Department of Financial Industry within MEF is responsible \nfor prudential regulation and supervision of the insurance industry, which consists of one state-\nowned and four private nonlife insurance companies plus a reinsurance company that is 80% \nstate-owned. Negotiation for the sale of 75% of Caminco\u2019s (the state-owned firm\u2019s) shares to a \njoint venture comprising an insurance firm from Thailand and a Cambodian investor is in its final \n ", "44  Appendix 3 \nstage. The insurance industry is young and small. It has gone through a turbulent period, but \nwith the introduction of regulations and the enforcement of those regulations, stability and \ngrowth have returned. The regulator requires the capital of each company to be distributed as \nfollows: 10% deposited with NBC, 50% deposited in commercial banks, with the decision on \nhow to invest the 40% balance left to the insurance company concerned. Insurance companies \nhave indicated that they would like these ratios to be changed, and the 40% increased. A \nrevision of the insurance law has been initiated by MEF. \n \n20.  Growth has been steady (averaging 11\u201315% in the last 3 years) from a limited range of \ninsurance products. The total gross premiums were $17.5 million at the end of 2007. The three \nnonlife  categories  of  insurance  products  (commercial  vehicles,  construction  sites,  and \npassenger vehicle liabilities) underwritten in this market are compulsory by regulation. Growth \nhas been steady since 2003, with commercial fire and miscellaneous policies making up 63% of \nthe market and motor vehicle insurance 19%. Other products sold include hospital and surgical, \npersonal  and  accident,  marine  cargo,  and  travelers  insurance.  The  insurance  companies \noperating in Cambodia are conservatively managed.   \n \n21.  The insurance industry requires a number of specialist skills that are not required in \nother industries. As insurance is a fairly new concept in Cambodia, these specialist skills are not \navailable and need to be acquired (e.g., the skills of underwriters, actuaries, loss adjustors, and \nfund managers). The framework for insurance supervision has been developed, but material \ndeficiencies in terms of capacity for supervision remain.  \n \n22.  Capital  Market.  Cambodia  has  no  bond  and  securities  markets.  The  Law  on \nGovernment Securities was promulgated by the King in January 2007 and the Law on Issuance \nand Trading of nongovernment securities was subsequently adopted by the National Assembly \nin September 2007. The most recent short-term government securities were issued in 2005. \nThe placement of government securities is jointly organized by NBC and the commercial banks. \nThe Government has established a capital market unit in MEF, and in April 2007 it signed a \nmemorandum of understanding with the stock exchange of the Korea International Cooperation \nAgency  for  $1.8  million  worth  of  technical  assistance  to  help  with  the  initial  training  and \npreparation for establishing a securities market in the near future. \n \n23.  Accounting and Auditing Infrastructure. The continuing growth of the commercial \nsector is creating significant challenges to improving the quality of accounting and auditing, as \nwell as to producing sufficient numbers of qualified accountants. Cambodia has established a \nlegal and regulatory framework for accounting and auditing, but inconsistencies between the \nvarious  laws  and  regulations  remain.  Some  aspects  are  difficult  to  interpret,  and  there  is \nweakness in the overall framework. As of May 2008, 20 Cambodian accounting standards and \n10 Cambodian auditing standards have been introduced based on international standards. A \nstandards advisory body and a local institute of accountants have been established to oversee \nthis. \n \n24.  The accounting profession is in its infancy. As of May 2008, the 19 public accounting \nand auditing firms employed 30 resident qualified accountants\u201410 of whom are locally qualified. \nCurrently more than 12,000 companies are registered, and the rate of registration is growing. \nThe public accounting firms have few, if any, local clients. To date more than 1,000 students \nhave enrolled in the local accounting qualification course, but approximately 40% of those have \neither dropped out or been dismissed. Seventeen students, including those not employed in \npublic accounting, are qualified certified public accountants, but the vast majority of students are \nexperiencing difficulties in completing the early stages of the course.  ", "    Appendix 3  45\n \n25.  Legal  Infrastructure.  An  enabling  legal  framework  for  financial  and  commercial \ntransactions could be achieved by continuing support for Cambodia\u2019s process of law reform, \nincluding for the adoption and implementation of core financial and commercial laws that are \nharmonized  and  aligned  with  the  legal  system.  The  law  reform  process  in  financial  and \ncommercial areas aims to create an enabling environment for the financial sector and for \neconomic growth in general. The Government has taken important steps to prepare, adopt, and \nimplement  certain  major  laws.  The  second  stage  of  development  is  for  additions  and \nrefinements to be made to the legal framework. \n \n26.  The  process  for  enacting  a  new  law  is  subject  to  several  documented  steps.  In  a \ncommon situation, where an international legal expert has provided assistance and produced a \ndraft document in English, the translation into Khmer would take a minimum of 2\u20133 weeks. Then \nthe  process  of  internal  debate  and  consultation  is  held  within  the  ministry  responsible  for \nintroducing the new law. Following these steps, the procedures pertaining to passage of the law \nthrough the Council of Ministers and National Assembly are usually lengthy: approval by the \nCouncil of Ministers typically takes at least 6 months (but usually longer), and the process for \nsubmission to the National Assembly and the approval process within the Assembly itself are \nestimated to take approximately 1 year. Consequently, delay is always a risk at any given stage \nof the legislative process. \n \n27.  The current court process for the enforcement of collateral is seen as lengthy, uncertain, \nand subject to delays (including for the appeals process). The current situation calls for an \nurgent strengthening of Cambodia\u2019s dispute resolution system, as this is a critical element of the \nemerging financial and commercial legal framework. The introduction of commercial arbitration \nunder the new Law on Commercial Arbitration will be a key mechanism to consistently enforce \ncontracts and fairly resolve commercial disputes. A new commercial court law sponsored by the \nUnited Nations and other bilateral development partners, still in the planning stages, has the \npotential to improve transparency and finality under clearly established court procedures. \n \n \n \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \nCapital Markets, Corporate \nBanking and Formal Credit \nGovernance, and Public Financial  Rural and Microfinance \n(including SME and judicial reforms) \nManagement \nAsian Development Bank  Asian Development Bank  Asian Development Bank \n     \nFinancial Sector Program I   Preparing the Financial Sector  Rural Credit and Savings Project  \n\u2022  Budget: $30 million program  Program  \u2022  Budget: $20 million project loan \nloan  \u2022  Budget: $800,000 project  \u2022  Time frame: 2000\u20132006 \n\u2022  Time frame: 2001\u20132007  preparatory TA grant   \n  \u2022  Time frame: 2000\u20132007  Credit Facility to Promote Rural and \nLegal and regulatory foundation for    Microfinance Services \nbanking, insurance, and commercial  Improving Insurance Supervision   \ndevelopment; established  \u2022  Budget: $400,000 TA grant  Developing Deposit Services in Rural \nsupervision and surveillance  \u2022  Time frame: 2002\u20132006  Cambodia \nframework; foundation for developing    \u2022  Budget: $600,000 TA grant \ninterbank and money markets; key  Capacity Building for Banking and  \u2022  Time frame: 2005\u20132007 \nfinancial market infrastructure.

By promoting the development \nof a sound, market-based financial system to enhance the potential for economic growth and the creation of \nemployment opportunities, FSP II will be pivotal in improving financial intermediation in Cambodia. A sound, efficient, \nand integrated financial system is crucial for achieving broad-based sustainable economic growth; it will help reduce \npoverty by increasing job opportunities, lowering transaction costs of economic activities, and extending the outreach \nof the formal financial sector to poor and rural areas. An efficient financial system will promote private sector \ndevelopment and foreign direct investment. Beneficiaries are expected to include the poor and near-poor.
