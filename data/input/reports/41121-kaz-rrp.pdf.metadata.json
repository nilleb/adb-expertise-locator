The Investment \nProgram  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  its \npartner organizations, and the Government will be governed by \nthe frameworks. The first tranche has been subjected to standard \ndue diligence on environmental and social matters, and classified \nenvironmental category B. An initial environmental examination is \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix H. \n   \nProgram Description  Kazakhstan has put together a strategy or road map to develop \nthe transport sector over the medium term. This covers all modes \nof transport, including national highways, as well as provincial and \nrural roads. The strategy recognizes the need for new assets (to \nincrease network coverage) and repair and upkeep of existing \nones (to extend their economic life and improve quality). Some of \nthe  existing  assets  are  in  a  poor  state  of  repair.  A  policy \nframework  backs  the  road  sector  strategy.  It  embodies  basic \noperating principles and best practice approaches with regard to \ngood governance and accountability, sustainable financing, policy \nand  regulatory  framework,  institutional  reform  and  capacity \ndevelopment,  road  safety,  road  sector  sustainability,  and  road \ntransport operations. The strategy and the policy framework will \nbe operationalized via an investment program combining \u201chard\u201d \nand \u201csoft\u201d interventions over the short, medium, and long term. \nThis program requires financing, and the financing strategy rests \non  internal  and  external  sources.  ADB  and  several  other \ninternational financial institutions have been approached by the \nauthorities to team up with the Government and private sector to \nprovide such financing. \n \nThe Road Development Program (RDP) covers 2006\u20132012. At \nthe  start,  the  physical  investment  part  of  the  RDP  will  target \nnational  roads,  the  backbone  of  the  network.  About \n7,000 kilometers (km) of these need major reconstruction and/or \nexpansion. About 18,000 km of the network requires smaller scale \nrehabilitation works. About 18,000 km of local roads also require \nsignificant rehabilitation and expansion. Work on these roads will \ntake  place  over  the  program  period,  although  the  main \ninvestments  will  be  undertaken  once  the  principal  network ", "ii   \ndeficiencies  are  addressed.  The  nonphysical  part  of  the  RDP \ncovers institutional reforms and capacity building aimed at better \nplanning, operations, fiduciary oversight and governance, project \nmanagement,  reporting  and  results  measurement,  outsourcing, \nand private sector involvement.  \n \nThe physical and nonphysical parts of the Investment Program \nwere identified on the basis of due diligence work or assessments \nconducted  over  recent  years\u2014mostly  by  the  Government, \nalthough  some  in  conjunction  with  international  financial \ninstitutions. The  investment  and  advisory  services  components \nincluded under the Investment Program will be sequenced and \nsplit into sections before being \u201cassigned\u201d to individual financiers \nand the private sector.  \n \nADB will team up with the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and \nthe  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  to  handle \nsections of the road network in the southern part of the country. \nThese  sections  amounting  to  480  km  is  part  of  the  so-called \nWestern  Europe\u2013Western  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC) \nInternational  Transit  Corridor.  The  overall  investment  for  the \ncorridor is about $6.7 billion, of which the ADB section and that of \nits partners amount to about $1.48 billion. Other financiers behind \nthe overall corridor development plan include the Government, the \nprivate  sector,  the  World  Bank,  and  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development. ADB has been requested to \nprovide $700 million toward the Investment Program through a \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF). IDB will provide $414 million \nand JICA $150 million. \n   \nRationale  The road sector has long-standing operational and institutional \nbottlenecks: (i) the network is incomplete, and in some sections in \nbad condition; (ii) truck overloading is frequent, cutting into the \neconomic life of road assets; (iii) revenues from transit are low, \naffecting  cost  recovery  and  reinvestment  capabilities; \n(iv) inefficient  cross-border  procedures  increase  the  burden  on \ntrade and traders, and raise the cost of doing business; (v) weak \nroad sector planning affects sound investment sequencing; and \n(vi) project development and project management shortcomings \ncreate inefficiencies, high costs, and bad governance. These gaps \ntranslate  into  higher-than-average  transport  costs.  They  also \nhamper regional cooperation and integration opportunities, and \nultimately the country\u2019s competitiveness. The Investment Program \nand  the  proposed  financing  are  intended  to  remove  these \nconstraints. A problem tree analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nInvestment Program  The  Investment  Program  caters  for  the  improvement  and \nexpansion  of  the  Western  Europe\u2013Western  PRC  International \nTransit Corridor. This runs from Khorgos at the border with the \nPRC, through Almaty and Shymkent, to the western border with \nthe  Russian  Federation.  This  corridor  is  underpinned  by  road ", "           iii     \ninvestments made in the PRC, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. In \nthis sense, the corridor is an integral part and flagship transaction \nunder the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nprogram. Further, the corridor paves the way and justifies the \ndevelopment  of  the  North\u2013South  Corridor  which  runs  into \nUzbekistan,  Turkmenistan,  Afghanistan,  and  Pakistan.  Each  of \nthese corridors will be backed by work at the national level on \nrural access roads.   \n \nA  landmark  reform  is  already  in  place,  related  to  the \nreorganization of the Ministry of Transport and Communications \n(MOTC). This involves the separation of key business functions\u2014\nprocurement,  financial  management,  contract  supervision,  and \nquality control. As a result, MOTC is becoming a facilitator rather \nthan a \u201cdoer\u201d. Most road works contracts are already outsourced \nto the private sector. The exception is routine maintenance works \nthat  are  outsourced  to  a  state-owned  road  maintenance \nenterprise\u2014although even here there are moves to bring in the \nprivate  sector  under  a  variety  of  revenue  and  risk  sharing \narrangements\u2014an  approach  followed  successfully  in  several \nEuropean  Union  countries.  Another  feature  of  the  institutional \nreform  program  already  in  place  is  the  establishment  of  a \nCommittee  of  Roads  under  MOTC;  and  the  introduction  of  a \nwarranty system for construction, operation, and maintenance. In \naddition,  the  procurement  process  has  been  overhauled  and \nprescribed in all bid documentation schedules. MOTC has also \nestablished  a  quality  control  section  and  oblast-based  road \nconstruction testing laboratories. These changes will yield positive \nresults  over  the  short  term,  but  more  are  needed.  The  most \nimportant  changes  concern  the  establishment  of  a  road  fund; \nimproved planning and project management; refinement of the \nlegal framework over time (e.g. to facilitate build-operate-transfer \nand concessions, and improved financial management systems); \nthe introduction of tougher road safety systems; and staff training.  \n \nThe Investment Program earmarked for the three institutions and \nthe Government is divided into three projects financed under three \nseparate tranches. The first tranche under the ADB financing will \nhave two major components: (i) road development, and (ii) road \noperations and maintenance. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The financing plan for the overall corridor development plan is \nshown below, indicating that ADB is one of several players.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "iv   \nSummary Financing Plan of the Corridor \nAmount  Percentage \nSource \n($ million)  (%) \nGovernment   909  15 \nADB  700  10 \nEBRD  181  3 \nIDB   414  6 \nJICA  150  3 \nWorld Bank  2,125  31 \nPrivate   2,221  32 \nTotal  6,700  100 \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EBRD  =  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development, IDB = Islamic Development Bank, JICA = \nJapan International Cooperation Agency. \nSources: Ministry of Transport and Communications and ADB estimates. \n \nThe sections of the corridor development plan earmarked for the \nInvestment Program to be financed by ADB and its partners are \nestimated at $1.48 billion.  \n \nSummary Financing Plan of the Investment Program  \nAmount  Percentage \nFinancier and Financing Modality \n($ million)  (%) \nADB \u2013 multitranche financing  700  47 \nfacility  \nIDB \u2013 collaborative cofinancing  414  28 \nJICA \u2013 joint cofinancing  150  10 \nGovernment  216  15 \nTotal  1,480  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IDB = Islamic Development Bank, JICA = \nJapan International Cooperation Agency. \nSources: Ministry of Transport and Communications and ADB estimates. \n \nThe  JICA\u2019s  loan  will  be  provided  under  the  Accelerated \nCofinancing  Scheme  with  ADB  (ACFA)  signed  in  2007.

In \nthe case of IDB, the proposed financing is expected to be on a \nparallel  basis  in  accordance  with  the  Framework  Cofinancing \nAgreement signed between ADB and IDB in September 2008. \n   \nThe  following  financing  plan  of  projects  under  the  Investment \nProgram is envisaged. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "           v     \nSummary Financing Plan of Projects under  \nthe Investment Program  \n($ million) \nSubsequent  Percentage \nFinancier  Project 1  Total \nProjects  (%) \nADB  340  360  700  47 \nJICA   0  150  150  10 \nIDB   0  414  414  28 \nGovernment  60  156  216  15 \nTotal  400  1,080  1,480  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IDB = Islamic Development Bank, JICA = \nJapan International Cooperation Agency. \nSources: Ministry of Transport and Communications and ADB estimates. \n \nMFF Modality   The MFF is proposed as the modality to extend ADB financing to \nthe  Investment  Program.  This  proposal  is  qualified  on  five \ngrounds. First, the modality provides flexibility to the Government. \nWithin  the  proposed  maximum  financing  commitment  of  $700 \nmillion, ADB and the Government can easily modify the amount \nand  timing  of  ADB  contributions  under  each  tranche.  This  is \nimportant in case the government can raise additional financing \nfrom other sources (such as the private sector). The other element \nbehind this flexibility is that the financing to be provided by ADB \ncan be closely linked to the availability of resources within ADB (a \nmatter made clear to the authorities), as well as to compliance \nwith undertakings made under a financing framework agreement.  \n \nSecond, financing under the MFF can be linked with technical, \nsafeguards,  legal  and  other  project  readiness  filters.  The \nauthorities can make specific loan conversions under the broad \nfacility when projects are ready for implementation. This approach \nfacilitates advance actions, including documentation preparation \nand the establishment of relevant administrative arrangements. \nThe MFF also allows ADB, the Government, and its partners to \nlink  more  closely  the  financing  to  changes  in  the  cost  of \nsubprojects bundled under each tranche. This avoids problems \nassociated with cost overruns. Third, the MFF modality allows \nADB to enter into a medium-term partnership with the authorities \nand its cofinancing partners, and in the process create stability but \nalso credibility at the level of the financing plan. The MFF also \nmixes the physical investments with advisory services. The latter \nincludes work on capacity and policy actions, which at times could \nbe precursors to making the actual physical investments.  \n \nFourth, the individual contract packages are large in size and \nlimited in number. This invalidates a sector loan approach, as well \nas  stand-alone  project  modalities,  as  alternatives.  Although  in \ntheory any of these modalities could be used, the efficiency gains \nwould not be the same. Fifth, all the conditions precedents for the \nuse of an MFF are in place\u2014there is a strategic context, road \n ", "vi   \nmap, policy framework, investment program, and financing plan.  \n \nThe  channeling  of  funding  via  an  MFF  provides  ADB,  the \nGovernment, and the cofinanciers with a chance to shift time and \nresources  away  from  repetitive  processing  tasks  during  the \nnetwork development period into implementation support and key \nadvisory  services.  The  modality  moves  the  analytical  work  up \nfront, leaving resources and multi-entry points for ADB and its \npartners to focus on implementation, capacity, and reforms. ADB \nand its partners have agreed decision-making criteria and filters \nfor  the  provision  of  finance,  including  specific  warranties  and \nrepresentations  and  covenants  leading  to  suspension  and \ncancellation of financing.     \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  expected  impact  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be \nsustainable economic development as a result of the expected \noutcome  of  an  efficient  transport  system  in  Zhambyl  Oblast. \nDesign and monitoring frameworks have been prepared for the \noverall corridor development plan and for the Investment Program \nincluding the first tranche. These results are linked to the problem \ntree analysis. The frameworks are in Appendix 1.   \n   \nFinancing Conditions  The MFF will be split into three tranches. ADB financing will be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The maximum \namount  of  ADB  financing  under  the  MFF  will  be  $700  million \nequivalent. The terms of ADB financing will follow the provisions \nof the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  loans,  subject  to \nmodifications  that  may  be  included  under  individual  loan \nagreements.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2015 \n   \nEstimated Investment  31 December 2014 \nProgram Completion \nDate \n   \nExecuting Agency  MOTC will be the Executing Agency for the Investment Program. \nThe Committee of Roads under MOTC will be the Implementing \nAgency. \n   \nImplementation  MOTC will set up a team and appoint a project director to manage \nArrangements  the Investment Program. The team will cover legal matters (e.g. \nbid  document  and  contract  signing,  contract  supervision, \nundertakings  and  loan  covenant  compliance);  engineering  and \ncontract supervision; safeguards oversight; financial management; \nrecord  keeping;  procurement;  disbursements;  and  evaluation, \nmonitoring,  and  reporting.  It  will  also  contain  a  results \nmeasurement  unit.  The  team  will  include  MOTC  staff  and  will \nrecruit advisers engaged locally and internationally.  \n   ", "           vii     \nImplementation Plan  The transaction team has prepared a project implementation plan, \nby  linking  each  of  the  main  tasks  under  the  first  tranche  to \nprojected  individual  contracts  for  goods,  works,  and  services. \nThere is also a higher level implementation plan for the MFF as a \nwhole.  The  idea  behind  this  plan  is  to  demonstrate  project \nreadiness, but also to agree project management actions ahead of \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors consideration date of the Report and \nRecommendations of the President. This approach facilitates the \nwork of a team made up of ADB and MOTC. The \u201ccool-off\u201d period \nbetween Board approval and loan signing date will be used to \nestablish the MOTC\u2019s team, agree a final organizational structure, \ndefine the final team skills mix, and seek administrative and legal \napprovals.  \n \nThe  anchor  for  the  implementation  plan  is  a  management \ninformation  system  connecting  the  civil  works  contractor \nresponsibilities,  tasks,  and  time  schedules  to  those  of  the \nsupervision  consultants,  the  local  program  management  office \nteam, and the ADB staff in charge of program oversight. The \ninformation system will record contract awards and disbursement \nprojections and anticipated dates for actions by the contractor, \nexecuting agency team, and ADB. It will also provide a summary \nof  the  reports  due  for  management  and  financiers.  The \nimplementation plan for the Investment Program is summarized in \nAppendix 9. Supplementary Appendix B contains more details on \nthis plan.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed \nfrom the ADB and JICA loans will be done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). International competitive bidding (ICB) contract packages \nwill be used for civil works over $3 million and goods over $1 \nmillion.  National  competitive  bidding  for  civil  works  could  be \nconducted  for  contracts  not  exceeding  $3  million.  Civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  through  ICB  among  pre-qualified \nbidders. ADB\u2019s prior review procedures will be followed.  \n \nTranche 1 involves three ICB contract packages for civil works.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The Investment Program requires the assistance of consultants. \nThe  assistance  is  split  into  two:  a  core  team  to  be  engaged \nupfront and additional inputs to be brought into the Investment \nProgram as and when required. The first will be financed under \nthe first tranche and the latter under subsequent tranches.  Under \ntranche 1, ADB financing will be used to engage the services of \ninternational and national experts. About 814 person-months of \nconsultancy services have been budgeted for this purpose. These \ninclude 179 person-months international and 635 person-months \nof national staff. The actual team composition and skill mix may \nvary  during  various  project  implementation  phases.  The  same \napplies to the terms of reference and profile of the experts. The \n ", "viii  \ngeneral principle is that advisers will be secured on a competitive \nbasis and that the specific mandates will be defined and finalized \nby  the  management  team  responsible  for  the  Investment \nProgram. ADB will be required to approve the selection process.  \n \nAll  consultants  financed  from  ADB  and  JICA  loans  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the \nprocurement  plans  for  the  projects.  Consulting  firms  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection procedures. Full technical proposals will be required for \nall consulting services. \n \n   \nBenefits and  The  Investment  Program  will  benefit  an  array  of  people  and \nBeneficiaries  business  in  Kazakhstan  and  neighboring  countries.  The  main \nbenefits  revolve  around  better,  safer,  cheaper,  and  faster \nconnectivity. Better connectivity can yield important externalities, \nincluding access to health and education centers. The program \nwill have gender-related benefits, particularly as urban centers \nbecome better connected to isolated rural areas, thus improving \nmobility  and  job  opportunities  in  the  city.  There  are  also \ninstitutional  and  change  management  gains.  The  beneficiaries \ninclude  trading,  logistics  and  other  service  industry  operators. \nThey  also  include  farmer  communities,  food  and  industrial \nmanufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The economic internal \nrate of return for the Investment Program is 18%.   \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Sound,  timely,  and  cost-effective  implementation  of  the \nInvestment  Program  assumes  a  professional  and  competent \nproject management function, an unaltered strategy and policy \nframework,  and  continued  institutional  changes.  Exogenous \nfactors, such as rising construction costs caused by fuel price \nincreases,  may  also  have  a  bearing  on  the  success  of  the \nprogram, especially with regard to the overall budget and current \nfinancing plan. Finally, and after construction, the success of the \nprogram will depend on how well and how frequently the assets \nare maintained. The introduction of best practice safety measures \nis also a matter for consideration. \n \nOverall, the chances that implementation will be done on time and \nwithin  budget,  and  meet  international  standards  are  high.  The \nproject management team will be staffed with skilled personnel, \nnational  and  international.  An  experienced  professional  with  a \nrecord  in  project  management  will  manage  this  team.  The \nbusiness processes and the operating procedures for awarding \ncontracts  and  then  managing  them  are  reasonably  well \nestablished and credible in Kazakhstan. It is also highly likely that \nthe  Committee  of  Roads  will  adhere  to  best  practice  when  it \ncomes to design and construction standards.

I submit, for your approval, the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Transport  Corridor  I  (Zhambyl  Oblast  Section)  [Western \nEurope\u2013Western People\u2019s Republic of China International Transit Corridor] Investment Program \n(the Investment Program), and (ii) an administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a \nloan to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Investment Program to be provided by the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA). The design and monitoring framework (DMF) for the \nInvestment Program is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.   The economy of Kazakhstan has grown rapidly because of increased prices on its \nleading exports such as oil, metals, and grain. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth has \nreached about 10.6% annually since 2001.2 This growth is expected to continue, albeit with \npossible blips during the short term on account of current external shocks and international \nfinancial crisis. In any event, strong economic growth will lead to an increase in road freight \ntransport (in ton-kilometers) of about 10% per year and a rise in the number of vehicles of about \n5% per year.3 The motorization level of about 100 cars per 1,000 population is relatively high in \nthe region but low by the European standard of above 300 cars per 1,000 inhabitants.4 \n \n3.   Kazakhstan\u2019s  vast  territory,  low  density  of  population,  mineral  resources  scattered \nacross the country, and location between Europe and Asia make it one of the world\u2019s most \ncargo-intensive systems. This results in high dependency on the transport system.  \n \n4.   Roads are a key element of Kazakhstan\u2019s transport system. They play an important role \nin  providing  access  to  rural  areas,  and  facilitating  transit  traffic  and  in-country  transport \nmovement.  However,  much  of  the  road  network  is  in  poor  condition\u2014about  60%  of  the \nrepublican (national) roads require major rehabilitation and proper maintenance. Moreover, the \nfeeder road network serving the rural population is not fully developed; and is characterized by \npoor conditions and a low service level, especially during wintertime. This results in a high cost \nof goods\u2014the transport cost component is about 10% of the cargo value, which is far above the \naverage of about 4% in developed economies (footnote 2).  \n \n5.   Kazakhstan has three road networks, each under the responsibility of different levels of \ngovernments and their respective road organizations: (i) the republican roads are under the \nresponsibility of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) and managed by the \nCommittee of Roads, (ii) local or rural roads are under oblasts or provincial governments, and \n(iii) urban roads are under municipality or city authorities. There are about 23,000 kilometers \n(km) of republican roads, of which only about 40% has an asphalt-based surface; and about \n                                                 \n1  A feasibility study for the Investment Program was prepared by the Ministry of Transport and Communications \n(MOTC).

The  road  sector  has  long-standing  operational  and  institutional  bottlenecks:  (i)  the \nnetwork is incomplete, and in some sections in bad condition; (ii) truck overloading is frequent, \ncutting into the economic life of road assets; (iii) revenues from transit are low, affecting cost \nrecovery and reinvestment capabilities; (iv) inefficient cross-border procedures increase the \nburden on trade and traders, and raise the cost of doing business; (v) weak road sector \nplanning  affects  sound  investment  sequencing;  and  (vi)  project  development  and  project \nmanagement shortcomings create inefficiencies, high costs, and bad governance. These gaps \ntranslate into higher than average transport costs. They also hamper regional cooperation and \nintegration opportunities, and ultimately the country\u2019s competitiveness. A problem tree analysis \nis presented in Appendix 2 as part of the road sector analysis. \n \n7.   The Government has recognized the transport deficiencies and is planning to increase \nthe budget for the road sector. In 2008, road funding represented 1% of GDP with projections \naiming to increase it to 2% of GDP. Developed countries without road funds spend on average \nabout 1% of GDP on their roads. As expected, countries with road funds spend more\u2014an \naverage of about 1.6% of GDP, of which about 0.3% is spent on road maintenance. The current \nroad maintenance budget of about 0.1% of GDP is clearly inadequate. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Road Sector Road Map \na.  Strategic Objectives and Approach \n \n8.   Kazakhstan  has  developed  a  transport  sector  strategy  (the  Transport  Strategy)  to \nimprove and expand the network over the short to medium term.5 The Transport Strategy \nincluding a strategy for the road sector outlines several objectives and sets out quantitative and \nqualitative targets and operating principles. The underlying theme is to make the road system \nlarger, better, more accessible, more affordable, more efficient, safer, and more environmentally \nfriendly. The Government also wants to see greater integration between different modes, cost \nrecovery, much more outsourcing to the private sector \u2013 construction, maintenance, operations, \nand management. The Transport Strategy calls for investments in \u201chard\u201d infrastructure, as well \nas for institutional effectiveness and change.  This includes streamlining the mandate of the \nMinistry of Transport and Communications (MOTC); improving planning, governance, financial \nand project management, safeguards standards, and road safety measures. The Transport \nStrategy sequences priority investments splitting them into public and private investments and a \nmix of both. These create the conditions for investments (the level playing field for public and \nprivate actions), but also the criteria for operating assets and monitoring performance and \nresults.     \n \nb.  Policy Framework \n \n9.   The Government has also developed a policy framework governing investments over the \nmedium term (Appendix 3). A first set of principles under this framework includes institutional \nperformance and accountability, system efficiency, cost recovery, transparency and controls for \nthe way financial resources are used and managed, competition with regard to bidding for \ncontracts (of all types), fiduciary oversight, and cost effectiveness. A second set of principles \n                                                 \n5 Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 2006. Transport Sector Strategy of the Republic of \nKazakhstan up to 2015. Astana. \n ", "      3\n(albeit not lower level) includes outsourcing to the private sector and best practice approaches \nwith regard to safeguards, financial management, project management, safety and institutional \nchange  management.  The  transport  sector  agencies  want  results  and  value  for  their \ninvestments and lower bureaucratic hassles. A third set of principles call for \u201cfacilitator\u201d actions \nsuch as customs efficiency, trade or cargo clearance, asset inventory and regional cooperation. \nA fourth set of principles includes financing and accountability for the way the resources are \nused.  A fund raising strategy has been put in place to tap into domestic and international fund \nproviders, including multilateral and bilateral agencies. This funding will be used mostly for \ncapital expenditure purposes.  Reintroduction of a road fund to deal with recurrent cost needs \nwill be explored.  The policy framework will be revised from time to time. The principles should \nremain in place; but their intensity or emphasis can change, depending on the needs and \ncircumstances. The policy framework underpins the investments \u2013 public and private alike.    \n \n    c.  Challenges \n \n10.   The development of the road system faces challenges.  The due diligence process for \nthe Investment Program identified several issues related to (i) the road network (coverage, \nquality and accessibility periods); (ii) the road sector institutions; and (iii) the level of finance \navailable for investments. A problem tree analysis shows the main issues by category. The \nobject with this work is to separate the root causes of the problem from their symptoms. This \nproblem tree is linked to the DMF for the Investment Program. The objective shown in the \nproblem tree relates to the impact shown in the DMF; the core problem to the outcome and the \ncauses of the problem to the outputs.  The solution chosen relates to the inputs shown in the \nDMF.   \n \n(i)  Road  network  coverage.  The  Republican  road  network  offers  reasonable \ncoverage compared with the rural and urban roads, albeit with still important \nmissing links. Substantial investments are needed to make it complete and more \neffective. The rural road network is the most limited of the three.6 This will be part \nof another investment program at a later stage. The first priority now is to deal \nwith the national road network \u2013 while repairing several provincial roads at the \nsame time.  \n \n(ii)  Quality of existing assets. Major sections of the Republican, rural and urban \nnetworks are in a poor state of repair. MOTC wants to covert 86% of republican \nroads and 70% of local roads into a \u201cgood condition\u201d by 2013, up from 62% \n(republican  roads)  and  51%  (rural  roads)  in  2006.  Only  about  40%  of  the \nrepublican roads are asphalt-based.  \n \n(iii)  Access. Parts of the road network are impassable during winter months. This \nmakes access to rural areas, towns and neighboring countries difficult, thereby \naffecting trade flows and competitiveness.  \n \n(iv)  Institutional/management  gaps.  MOTC  has  already  undergone  reforms \nrecently and is becoming efficient, both in planning and monitoring. But more \nreforms are needed.  The oblast administrations are less capable and need \ntechnical back up.  Unless addressed, this gap affects rural and provincial road \nnetwork development.  Institutional gaps are aggravated by lack of experience in \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Formulation of Rural Road Development Plan. Manila (TA 4145-KAZ); and \nADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Formulation of State Roads Development Plan. Manila (TA 4462-KAZ). \n ", "4   \noutsourcing  works  to  the  private  sector,  project  management  skills  and \nknowledge on best practices related to safeguards, safety, maintenance and \nrepair.   \n \n(v)  Financing.  Road sector development needs capital and recurrent expenditure \nfinance. Road maintenance accounts for 7% of the road sector budget. But this \nactivity has been under funded for years.  Allocations from the Government for \nrepairs and maintenance reach $2000/km by the end of 2008. The financing \nissue is being addressed in various ways: the private sector will figure more \nstrongly in the development and maintenance of assets; the public sector will \nintroduce a road fund to give greater continuity to road maintenance; the budget \nwill make larger and more predictable allocations; and the Government will tap \ninternational financiers to help with the capital expenditure programs. The fund \nraising strategy focuses first and foremost on international financing institutions \n(IFIs) and the budget.  Domestic capital markets will also be tapped, especially in \nthe context of the Republican roads structured around concessions and public-\nprivate partnerships. \n \n(vi)  Strategy and policy framework.  Until recently, the Transport Strategy was \nflawed and the policy principles unclear and unpredictable.  This has changed.  \nBoth gaps have been taken care of, resulting in a more coherent investment \nprogram.   \n \n(vii)  Road safety. While nation-wide data indicates that road conditions improved in \n2007, the number of people killed every year exceeds 2,000, with a further 4,700 \ninjured. A fatality rate of 18 per 100,000 inhabitants was reported in 2004, higher \nthan the regional average. The number of people killed between 2005 and 2007 \nincreased by more than 19%. Road safety has been too downplayed. Speeding \nis  key  contributor,  but  low  quality  construction,  the  lack  of  security  barriers, \nlighting, and police oversight are also to blame. The same applies to vehicle \nroadworthiness  standards  and  supervision.  The  Ministry  of  Internal  Security, \nresponsible for dealing with road accidents, has devised a program to deal with \nthese  problems.  Past  efforts  to  establish  a  Road  Safety  Commission  were \nresisted. This concept is now widely accepted and will be reconsidered.    \n \n(viii)  Border crossing times. The main transport routes in Kazakhstan are into the \nRussian Federation, Europe, and Central Asia. A total of 24,000 commercial \ntransit  vehicles,  including  large  buses  and  medium  to  large  trucks,  cross \nKazakhstan every day in 2007. A total of about 350,000 tons of transit traffic pass \nthrough  this  route.  Business  volumes  are  growing  fast.  This  puts  increasing \npressure  on  the  road  network.  Without  appropriate  and  corresponding \ninvestments at customs points, cross-border time delays and costs are become a \nburden  on  business.  Operators  already  complain  of  unreasonable  delays, \ncomplicated procedures, too many frontier inspections, contradictions between \ndomestic  transport  legislation  and  international  standards,  and  the  lack  of \ninternational standards and agreements relating to transit and traffic regulation. \nAlthough  there  have  been  improvements  in  all  these  areas  in  recent  times, \nborder crossing continues to be a problem to trade. \n \n(ix)  Road operations. Road operations and traffic management requires reliable and \naccurate data on all aspects of the network. Kazakhstan has problems on this \n ", "      5\nfront.  Advance early warning information systems do not exist. But these are \nnecessary to handle axle load monitoring and controls.  There is also a need for \nroad weather information, highways advisory radio and electronic signs, and \ntraffic recordings. This information is also useful for maintenance managers. This \nincludes making the right winter road maintenance decisions - to ensure that \nroad restrictions are minimized and costs are kept low. \n \n(x)  Road data and planning. Road and traffic data are unreliable, out of date and \nincomplete. But planning also needs tightening. The 7-year development plans \nare  based  on  norms  rather  than  analytical  information  regarding  system \nshortcomings. The existing road inspections and traffic surveys needs to be \nmodified and improved. Traffic surveys should include accidents data. \n \n    d.  Road Development Program \n11.   MOTC  has  defined  a  road  development  program  for  the  medium  term  \u2013  Road \nDevelopment  Program  for  2006\u20132012  (RDP). 7  This  calls  for  physical  and  nonphysical \ninvestments and addresses the core problems highlighted above. The RDP splits investments \namong the three types of networks, and then further among the short, medium and longer term. \nCash outlays are also divided into capital expenditures - for the development of new assets and \nthe rehabilitation of existing ones (mostly civil works) - and recurrent expenditures needed for \nmaintenance, repairs and institutional support. The RDP focuses almost exclusively on the \nRepublican roads network, the backbone of the transport system in Kazakhstan.  \n \n12.   Physical Investment.  The capital expenditure budget for this has gone up steadily \n(20% annually) in the last five years. The physical investments focus on the construction and \nreconstruction of 7,205 km of Republican roads. It also caters for major and minor repairs in at \nleast 18,460 km of such roads. The RDP also covers the construction, reconstruction and repair \nof 18,089 km of local roads. Urban roads are not included in this investment program. Within the \nRepublican road network the first priority is the Western Europe\u2013Western People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) International Transit Corridor.  This extends from Khorgos at the border with the \nPRC, through Almaty and Shymkent, into to the western border with the Russian Federation. \nThis Corridor is one of six included in the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy8 \nendorsed by CAREC member countries in 2007. \n \n13.   Nonphysical Investment. The RDP also covers nonphysical investments. Expenditures \nwill be directed at institutional change, including staff training, better internal systems and \nprocedures,  improved  organizational  structures,  the  development  of  safety  standards  and \ncontrol  measures  thereof,  more  funds  for  maintenance,  efficient  project  management \n(documentation, bidding, supervision, monitoring and reporting), due diligence capability for the \npreparation of new projects, safeguards monitoring, improved road maintenance system, results \nmeasurement, and planning. Institutional reforms started in early 2008 with the reorganization of \nMOTC.9 This included separating a number of key functions, namely procurement, financial \nmanagement, contract supervision and quality control. The Committee of Roads, with its Oblast-\nbased Road Administrations under MOTC, will be responsible for the Investment Program. \nMOTC has established a Quality Control Section and 14 oblast-based laboratories. These will \ninspect and assess the performance of road works and service contracts. The Committee on \nRoads will also be mandated to deal with contract supervision for locally funded works.

But further assistance and training is required in this \narea  to  ensure  full  transparency,  competition  and  efficiency.  The  Investment  Program  will \nincrease work loads and complexity. Management training and the introduction of management \ninformation systems will be needed to cope with this extra burden and cut costs. This is \nessential to give agencies the right levels of finance on time.  The promotion of more private \nsector participation in selected road sections is another area that requires technical support and \nadvice. This needs to be backed with better legal frameworks and contract models for build-\noperate-transfers  and  concessions.  An  improvement  of  transport  operations,  through  the \napplication of modern information technology, is another investment area. Better technology and \nsystems are also necessary to ensure cheaper, faster and seamless cross border movements. \nThe improvement of road safety and the tightening of road regulations will figure in the capacity \nbuilding agenda.     \n \n  e.  External Assistance and Lessons \n14.   ADB is a lead agency in the transport, energy, customs, and trade facilitation areas. This \nleadership is exercised mainly within CAREC \u2013 a program for which ADB acts as the facilitator. \nKazakhstan is an active member of CAREC. On the transport arena, CAREC has moved from \nthe definition of a strategy into the execution with investments and knowledge products in key \nareas. The Investment Program represents a flagship operation within this action plan. The \nInvestment Program has huge repercussions for connectivity across the entire Central Asian \nregion. It unleashes other corridors over time, especially in the North-South direction. \n \n15.   International Financial Institutions (IFIs) have been active in the road sector in the region \nand Kazakhstan for some time (Appendix 4). Transport is a strategic priority under ADB, EBRD, \nthe Islamic Development Bank (IDB), Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)10 and \nWorld Bank.  EBRD financed the rehabilitation of national highways along Almaty\u2013Bishkek and \nAktau\u2013Atyrau. IDB financed the rehabilitation of the Almaty\u2013Astana road in collaboration with \nADB. JBIC funded the rehabilitation of several highway segments in western Kazakhstan. The \nWorld Bank financed the rehabilitation of the Almaty\u2013Astana highway.  \n \n16.   ADB\u2019s operations include the rehabilitation of the Gulshad\u2013Akchetau road completed in \n2002  and  Almaty\u2013Bishkek  road  completed  in  2006.  Parts  of  the  first  project  were  rated \nsuccessful.11 The second project was rated satisfactory.12 Generally, the physical components \nwere done reasonably well.  The executing agency was exposed to new technology and road \nmaterials,  international  competitive  bidding,  and  working  with  international  contractors  and \nconsultants. The shortcomings on the institutional components front were due to less attention \ngiven to them. Further, certain covenants, such as the submission of project accounts and \naudits, were done poorly and/or too late. The executing agency needs to be strengthened \nespecially in relation to procurement. The Government has since pushed through with reforms. \nThe institution and the teams have changed; with most of these shortcomings fast becoming a \nthing of the past. The recent restructuring of MOTC is certainly a step in the right direction. This \nprovides  an  opening  for  working  in  partnership,  and  a  higher  degree  of  confidence  over \ninstitutional effectiveness. However, these changes remain work in progress. The reform plan \n                                                 \n10  Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) was integrated with Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA) on 1 October 2008. \n11  ADB. 2006.

An ADB involvement through a partnership program (as opposed to a stand-\nalone project where the leverage is low) will most likely increase the probability of success, and \ngive more entry points to monitor and have a dialogue.   \n \n2.  Preconditions for a Multitranche Financing Facility Modality \n17.   The  MFF  is  proposed  as  the  modality  to  extend  ADB  financing  to  the  Investment \nProgram. This proposal is qualified on five grounds. First, the modality provides flexibility to the \nGovernment. ADB and the Government can easily modify the amount and timing of ADB \ncontributions under each tranche. This is important in case the Government can raise additional \nfinancing from other sources (such as the private sector), or if the Government needs more time \nto finalize their own financing packages (documentation, etc.). The other element behind this \nflexibility is that the financing to be provided by ADB can be closely linked to the availability of \nresources within ADB (a matter made clear to the Government), as well as to compliance with \nwarranties and representations made under a framework financing agreement (FFA). \n \n18.   Second, financing under the MFF can be linked to technical, safeguards, legal, and other \nproject readiness filters. The authorities can make specific loan conversions under the broad \nfacility  when  projects  are  ready  for  execution.  This  approach  facilitates  advance  actions, \nincluding  documentation  preparation  and  the  establishment  of  relevant  administrative \narrangements. The MFF also allows ADB, the Government, and its partners to link the financing \nmore closely to changes in the cost of projects bundled under each tranche. This avoids \nproblems associated with cost overruns. Third, the MFF modality allows ADB to enter into a \nmedium-term partnership with the Government and its cofinancing partners, and in the process \ncreate stability but also credibility at the level of the financing plan. The MFF also mixes the \nphysical investments with advisory services. The latter includes financing to advance work on \ncapacity and policy actions, which at times could be precursors to making the actual physical \ninvestments. \n \n19.   Fourth, the individual contract packages are large in size and limited in number. This \ninvalidates a sector loan approach, as well as stand-alone project modalities, as alternatives. \nAlthough in theory any of these modalities could be used, the efficiency gains would not be the \nsame. Fifth, all the conditions precedents for the use of an MFF are in place\u2014there is a \nstrategic context, road map, policy framework, investment program, and financing plan. The \nchanneling of funding via an MFF provides ADB, the Government, and cofinanciers with a \nchance to shift time and resources away from repetitive processing tasks during the network \ndevelopment  period  into  implementation  support  and  key  advisory  services.  The  modality \nmoves the analytical work up front, leaving resources and multi-entry points for ADB and its \npartners to focus on execution, capacity, and reforms. ADB and its partners have agreed \ndecision-making criteria and filters for the provision of finance, including specific warranties and \nrepresentations and covenants leading to suspension and cancellation of financing. \n \n    a.  Strategic Context and Strategy \n20.   The Government wants to develop the transport system as a whole and has a clear \nstrategy for one of its components\u2014the road sector. The aim is remove existing bottlenecks in \nthe way of better connectivity, competition and trade. As is the case elsewhere in the region, \nthese obstacles are physical, institutional, and policy in nature. The magnitude of the problem \nwas worked out through various specialized studies. These gave way to the preparation of a \nstrategy  with  quantitative  and  qualitative  targets.  The  quantitative  target  is  to  develop  14 \nstrategic  road  corridors,  6  of  which  are  international  roads.  The  qualitative  targets  are \n ", "8   \ninstitutional improvements, policy refinements, best practice on construction and maintenance \nand efficient financing.  The strategy calls for a mix of interventions over the short, medium and \nlong term, further split between different types of networks \u2013 republican, provincial, and rural.  \nThe republican network is the first priority:   \n \n(i)  Uzbekistan Border\u2013Shymkent\u2013Taraz\u2013Almaty\u2013Khorgos\u2013PRC Border,  \n(ii)  Shymkent\u2013Kyzylorda\u2013Aktobe\u2013Uralsk\u2013Samara,  \n(iii)  Almaty\u2013Karaganda\u2013Astana\u2013Petropavlovsk\u2013Russian Border,  \n(iv)  Russian Border\u2013Astrakhan\u2013Atyrau\u2013Aktau\u2013Turkmenistan Border, \n(v)  Omsk\u2013Pavlodar\u2013Semipalatinsk\u2013Mykapchagai\u2013PRC Border, and \n(vi)  Astana\u2013Kostanai\u2013Russian Border. \n \n21.   The Transport Strategy recognizes the difference between the creation of new assets \nand reconstruction, rehabilitation, and repair of old ones. Investments will be both public sector \nand public/private in nature. The road concession law was amended in 2008 to better attract \nprivate investments. The road sector financing mostly relies on three main sources of funds: the \nnational  budget,  the  private  sector  (national  and  international),  and  international  financing \ninstitutions such as ADB. A road fund was in place several years ago to deal with recurrent \nfinancing, but was abolished. The roadmap or strategy for the sector fits well with ADB\u2019s own \ncore business areas. Transport is one of the main activities under the Long Term Strategic \nFramework. Within the ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department, transport and logistics are \npriorities  for  most  countries,  including  Kazakhstan.  This  strategy  is  articulated  and \noperationalized  via  financing  and  advice  for  projects  with  national  and  regional  content. \nRegional activities fall within the mandate of CAREC. CAREC stands for connectivity, improved \ncompetitiveness, cooperation and integration, mainly via investments in transport, energy and \ntrade  facilitation  and  targeted  advice  on  these  sectors,  regional  public  goods  and  special \nthemes such as capacity building and the environment.   \n \n    b.  Policy Framework \n22.   MOTC formulated a policy framework to achieve strategic objectives outlined above. It \naddresses basic principles such as cost recovery, good governance and accountability, private \nsector involvement, sustainable financing, institutional effectiveness, competition and efficiency \nwith respect to contracts, road safety, best practice policies and procedures on safeguards and \nfiduciary oversight, and regular maintenance and repair.  The framework also points to diversity \nin terms of transaction structures and care and attention to thematic matters such as capacity \nand health matters.   \n \n    c.  Investment Plan \n23.   The total length of the corridor is about 2,715 km, of which 2,237 km will be constructed \nand/or reconstructed. The total investment is estimated at about $6.7 billion. ADB and its \ncofinancing partners, which may include JICA and IDB, are expected to finance 480 km of the \ncorridor;  EBRD  102  km;  the  World  Bank  1,062 km;  and  the  private  sector  504  km.  The \nGovernment has already completed 478 km and is constructing 89 km. The Government plans \nto complete the corridor by the end of 2012. The corridor investment will be a mix of public \nsector investment and public\u2013private partnership. The IFIs will finance about 53%, the private \nsector is expected to finance 32%, and the Government contribution will be about 15%. The \nproposed ADB financing for developing the corridor will contribute to enhancing the transport \nnetwork  within  the  region,  and  facilitating  transit  traffic  and  hence  strengthening  regional \ncooperation. \n ", "      9\n24.

Rationale \n26.    The DMF splits the results into outputs, outcome, and impact. These are related to the \nproblem tree analysis, which highlights the objective of the Investment Program (impact), the \nnature of the core problem (outcome), and the causes of the problem (outputs). The core \nproblem  can  be  described  as  follows.  The  road  network  (national,  rural,  and  urban)  is \nincomplete and in bad shape. Some parts of the network are impassable during some times of \nthe year (continuity of service). Such situation needs redressing to ensure that the country and \nthe region has a transport system that increases connectivity (within the country and with the \noutside world), competitiveness (lower transport costs), efficiency (shorter travel time), safety \n(lower fatalities), and trade and regional cooperation.  \n \n27.   In  terms  of  non-physical  issues,  the  institutional  effectiveness  is  low,  the  planning \ncapability  limited,  the  organizational  structure  complex,  and  the  project  management  skills \ndeficient.    MOTC  has  also  been  short  of  funds.  These  issues  are  aggravated  by  poor \nmanagement and information systems and weak policies and procedures related to themes \n ", "10   \nsuch  as  safeguards  and  financial  management.  The  objective  of  the  Investment  Program \ntherefore is to address these problems.  As a result, global and specific benefits accruing to \ncommunities in the country and the region are expected.    \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n28.   The  expected  impact  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment as a result of the expected outcome of an efficient transport system in Zhambyl \nOblast.  \n \nB.  Output \n1.  Output of the Investment Program \n29.   The output of the Investment Program will be (i) about 480 km of constructed highway \nsections in Zhambyl Oblast, and (ii) an improved road operations and maintenance system. The \nhighway is the main route between western PRC, Central Asian countries, and the Russian \nFederation. The Investment Program will help the Government accelerate the completion of the \nentire corridor. The Investment Program is split into projects, and comprises reconstruction of \nthe existing roads and construction of new roads.  \n \n2.  Output of Project 1 \n30.   Project 1 refers to the scope included in the first tranche of the MFF. Project 1 will have \ntwo major components: (i) a road development component, targeting construction of 125 km of \nhighway sections between Taraz and Korday in Zhambyl Oblast; and (ii) a road operation and \nmaintenance component. \n \n31.   Physical \u2013 Road Development Component. This will comprise civil works (roads and \nbridges) on the following sections:  \n \n(i)  Road section between km 404 and km 483. Civil works in this section will \nneither involve land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) nor create significant \nenvironmental impacts. This reconstruction is to meet 4-lane international design \nstandard  within  the  existing  right-of-way  (ROW).  Due  diligence  has  been \nconducted on the road design, technical specification, and cost estimates. \n \n(ii)  Road section between km 214 and km 260. Civil works in this section will not \ninvolve LAR nor create significant environmental impacts. This reconstruction is \nto meet 2-lane international design within the existing ROW.  \n \n32.   Nonphysical \u2013 Road Operations and Maintenance Component. This component will \nprimarily  assist  MOTC  in  improving  the  efficiency  of  road  operation  and  maintenance  in \nKazakhstan. Two subcomponents are envisaged: \n \n(i)  Development of intelligent transport system (ITS). Application of an ITS aims \nto improve road safety, and reduce travel time and delay using its three major \nfunctions: (a) surveillance, (b) control of highway operations, and (c) display of \ninformation to the motorist. This subcomponent will consist of two main tasks: \n(a) development of a strategic plan for the deployment of ITS technologies for the \n ", "      11\nexisting  and  future  road  network  in  the  country,  following  a  phased \nimplementation  approach  and  in  consultation  with  all  stakeholders;  and \n(b) preparation  of  an  implementation  plan,  equipment  specifications,  layout \ndesign, and schedule for the entire corridor. Given the length of the winters and \nthe expectation of heavy commercial traffic, specific consideration will be given to \naxle load monitoring and control facilities, road weather information systems, \nhighway advisory radio and electronic signs, and traffic recording equipment. \n \n(ii)  Improvement of road maintenance system. This subcomponent will review the \nroad maintenance system in Kazakhstan. An advisory service will be provided to \nreview the existing conditions of the road network, available road maintenance \nresources, road maintenance implementation constraints, and current practices. \nLessons from previously undertaken studies, programs, and practices in various \ncountries will be studied for possible implementation in Kazakhstan\u2014subject to \nbudget,  contracting  industry,  and  technical  environment.  Future  maintenance \nrequirements  will  be  developed  including  a  performance-based  road \nmaintenance  plan,  performance  standards,  and  technical  specifications.  This \nsubcomponent will also review Kazakhavtodor\u2019s strategy and plan, and funding \nallocations versus requirements; and provide recommendations for strengthening \nits technical and operational capacity; or may suggest alternative arrangements \nfor  the  consideration  of  MOTC.  Road  fund  and  possible  private  sector \ninvolvement in the operation of the Investment Program road will be assessed for \npossible implementation. \n \n3.  Output of Subsequent Projects \n33.   The output of the subsequent projects will be about 355 km of reconstructed roads \n(Appendix 5, Table A6). Civil works under the subsequent projects will involve land acquisition \nand involuntary resettlement, and create significant environmental impacts caused by road \nwidening  and  construction  of  new  bypasses.  MOTC  will  prepare  LAR  plans  (LARPs)  and \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs).  A  LAR  framework  (LARF)  and  an  environment \nassessment and review framework (EARF) have been prepared and endorsed by MOTC to \nprovide guidance for preparing safeguard documents for the subsequent projects. The EARF \nand LARF have also been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.  \n \n34.   The subsequent projects will continue strengthening road operation and maintenance, \nincluding possible procurement of road maintenance facilities and physical investment in an ITS. \nThe details will be finalized during the implementation of Project 1. \n \nC.  Investment Plan  \n \n35.   The  total  cost  of  the  Investment  Program  is  estimated  at  $1.48  billion  equivalent \nincluding taxes and duties, and physical and price contingencies. The total cost of Project 1\u2014\nincluding  taxes,  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies\u2014is  estimated  at  $400  million \nequivalent. The summary investment plan of the Investment Program is in Table 3.

Financing Plan \n \n1.  Financing Plan and Conditions \n36.   To finance the Investment Program, the Government has requested financing of up to \n$700 million equivalent through the MFF. ADB will provide loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) up to the amount of $700 million equivalent; provided that related periodic \nfinancing requests (PFRs) are submitted by the Government and related loan agreements are \nexecuted, and the Government complies with undertakings set forth in the FFA to be entered \ninto between the Government and ADB. The FFA has been negotiated and its signing by the \nGovernment is being delayed due to the need on the part of the Government to conduct \ninteragency review of the negotiated FFA and loan agreements with other IFIs with regard to the \nentire Corridor financing prior to their signing in accordance with the procedures prescribed by \nthe legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Thus, the FFA signing is expected after the Board \napproval  date.  Each  project  under  the  MFF  must  be  in  compliance  with  those  same \nundertakings. \n \n37.   The proposed financing plans for the Investment Program and for projects funded under \nthe MFF are summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Summary Financing Plan of Projects under the Investment Programa  \n($ million) \nSubsequent  Percentage  \nFinancier  Project 1  Total \nProjects  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  340  360  700  47 \nIslamic Development Bank   0  414  414  28 \nJapan International Cooperation Agency   0  150  150  10 \n         \nGovernment  60  156  216  15 \nTotal  400  1,080  1,480  100 \na In mid-2008 prices.

All provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based loans made from ADB\u2019s OCR dated 1 July 2001 will apply for each \nADB loan made under the MFF, subject to any modifications that may be included in the \nindividual loan agreements. Cofinancing will be provided on the terms and conditions applicable \nto the lending practices of the relevant cofinancier. The specific terms of each loan will be based \non the related PFR. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision, and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB.  \n \n39.   In  accordance  with  the  FFA,  the  Government  will  submit  the  first  PFR  to  ADB, \nrequesting a loan of $340 million to help finance Project 1. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions to be set forth in the related draft loan agreement. The Government will finance \nthe balance of the cost of Project 1 in an amount of $60 million, including local taxes and duties.  \n \n2.  Cofinancing \n40.   The Investment Program will comprise three projects, of which the second and third \nprojects are expected to be cofinanced by JICA and IDB.  Cofinancing from JICA is being \nmobilized for the second project in the form of a loan in the amount of $150 million pursuant to \nthe Accelerated Cofinancing Scheme with ADB (ACFA) signed between ADB and JICA in 2007. \nSuch cofinancing will be on a joint basis and will be administered by ADB.  In the case of IDB, \nthe proposed financing is expected to be provided on a parallel basis in accordance with the \nFramework Cofinancing Agreement signed between ADB and IDB in September 2008.  IDB is \nmobilizing the amount of $414 million to be provided in the form of loans for the second and \nthird projects under the Investment Program.  Formal confirmations have been received from \nJICA and IDB that approval of their respective loans are expected in mid 2009 and mid 201013. \nThe  projects  cofinanced  by  JICA  and  IDB  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard policies and guidelines. \n  \n41.   ADB will endeavor to mobilize additional cofinancing for the Investment Program. If \nsuccessful, such additional cofinancing may be converted into cofinancing administered by ADB \nas permitted by the MFF policy14 and reported to the Board for information.    \n \n3.  Filters for Financing Tranches \n42.   Financing tranches may be made available by ADB, provided matters continue to be in \naccordance with the general understandings and expectations on which the MFF is based and \nwhich are laid out in the FFA. Progress toward achievement of the outputs and the expected \noutcome set out in the design and monitoring frameworks for the overall corridor development \nplan, the Investment Program, and Project 1 will be decision-making criteria for continuing the \nMFF. Furthermore, compliance with the implementation framework, safeguards requirements \nand social development policies, and undertakings set forth in the FFA will also determine \nADB\u2019s decision to continue financing tranches. \n \n                                                 \n13  A memorandum of understanding on financing of the Investment Program was signed by the Ministry of Transport \nand  Communications,  Asian  Development  Bank,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  and  Islamic \nDevelopment Bank on 10 October 2008. \n14 ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila (approved in July 2008). \n ", "14   \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Management  \n43.   MOTC will be the Executing Agency (EA) and the Committee of Roads under MOTC will \nbe  the  Implementing  Agency.  MOTC  will  be  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the \nInvestment  Program  and  liaising  with  IFIs  involved  in  the  sector  (Appendix  7).  MOTC\u2019s \norganizational  structure  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  MOTC  will  establish  a  team  to \nmanage the Investment Program headed by a project director. The proposed organization \nstructure for the Investment Program is in Appendix 7.  \n \n44.   MOTC  will  appoint  the  project  director  who  shall  have  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementation of the Investment Program including project preparation, implementation, and \nmonitoring and reporting. The project director will be a qualified staff member of the Committee \nof Roads, with experience in project management acceptable to ADB. MOTC will ensure that, \nduring  the  entire  period  of  project  implementation,  the  project  director  will  be  adequately \nassisted by a team of MOTC staff responsible for engineering, finance, legal, and procurement \nmatters; and project management consultant (PMCs) and construction supervision consultant \nteams.  \n \n45.   A PMC to be established under the Investment Program (PMC-ADB) will be recruited by \nMOTC. PMC-ADB will be part of the PMC funded under the proposed World Bank\u2019s South West \nCorridor Development Program loan (PMC-WB). The PMC-WB will coordinate all activities \nfunded  by  IFIs  involved  in  the  corridor  investment;  and  provide  support  for  safeguard \ncompliance,  legal,  and  financial  management.  Given  the  critical  role  of  PMC-WB  in  the \nimplementation of the Investment Program, the ADB loan will have a condition stating that if the \nWorld Bank loan becomes liable for suspension, the ADB loan will also be suspended. The \nPMC-ADB will help the project director in implementing the Investment Program. Administrative \nand secretarial staff, office equipment, and facilities will be provided under the PMC-ADB\u2019s \ncontract. The PMC-ADB will introduce a suitable management information system to manage \nthe Investment Program. \n \n46.   The PMC-ADB will conduct the followings tasks to help the project director and its team \nto execute the Investment Program: \n \n(i)  Project management and procurement. The PMC-ADB team will assist MOTC in \nbid  document  preparation,  pre-qualification  criteria,  prequalification  process, \nbidding, selection, and award. The procurement documentation will be checked \nby this team before submission to ADB and the executing agency. The team will \nlook after all contractual arrangements, including any revisions requested by the \ncontractors. The objective is to ensure quality and strict adherence to ADB rules \nand procedures. The team will provide assurance certifications on behalf of the \nGovernment relating to loan covenants and MFF undertakings. \n \n(ii)  Finance and administration.  A financial management expert will run this function. \nThis  activity  will  be  split  into  financial  matters  (principally  funding  requests, \naccounts and money management, payments), controls and internal and external \nauditing  (records,  audits  and  governance  oversight)  and  administrative  work \n(record  keeping,  salaries,  utilities,  and  information  technology  system \nmaintenance).   \n \n ", "      15\n(iii)  Evaluation,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  There  is  also  a  need  to  report  the \nimplementation progress of the Investment Program to the authorities and the \nfinanciers.  This task will be matched by the measurement of results.  Under the \nCAREC Institute work, ADB will be commissioning specialized evaluation and \nimpact studies on CAREC related activities including the Investment Program. \nThis activity is a new feature under the CAREC.  In the meantime, the team will \ndevelop a Project Performance Monitoring System (PPMS) based on the DMF \nagreed  with  ADB  and  its  partners  and  in  the  short  term  at  least  deliver \ninformation on basic outputs (physical and nonphysical). \n \n(iv)  Due-diligence for subsequent projects. The preparation of new projects requires \ndue diligence work covering all standard areas linked to project finance and \nstand-alone  projects\u2014technical,  commercial,  legal,  economic,  social, \nsafeguards,  governance,  fiduciary  oversight,  management,  and  institutional \nmatters. This package is equivalent to a standard project preparation technical \nassistance from ADB, only that it will be financed under the first tranche loan.     \n \n47.   The construction supervision consultants will assist the project director and its team to \nimplement the Investment Program: \n \n(i)  Project  implementation.  The  main  task  will  be  to  manage  the  award  and \nexecution of civil works contracts (from a technical standpoint) and supervise \nschedules,  quality  of  materials  and  construction,  and  cost.  All  works \ncommissioning (acceptance) will require a certificate from the supervision team.  \nPayments and payment schedules from finance and administration (including \nrequests for ADB and its partners to pay) will need to pass this filter before being \nexecuted. This structure and its mandate will remain in place throughout the MFF \nperiod.  \n \n(ii)  Safeguard  compliance.  Safeguards  are  an  important  part  of  the  program \nmanagement task.  Although most sections of the roads involve rehabilitation, \nsome are new. Irrespective of which type of work is undertaken, the project \ndirector will need to ensure that all ADB policies and procedures on safeguards \nare followed throughout the implementation period.  The overall program benefits \nfrom a global safeguards framework. The first tranche has been subjected to due \ndiligence and is backed by plans that need monitoring. A specialized team will \naid  implementation  work  and  ensure  the  highest  standards  with  respect  to \nsafeguards work. The team will closely work with a safeguard team that will be \nrecruited under the World Bank-funded project and oversee the overall safeguard \ncompliance. \n \n48.   With the assistance of the PMC-ADB, the project director will prepare quarterly progress \nreports and will submit them to ADB within 2 weeks from the end of the related quarter. It will \nalso submit other required performance and monitoring reports twice a year. Overall progress \nand compliance with conditions of the loan agreement will be monitored regularly and reviewed \nby  ADB,  consistent  with  existing  project  implementation  requirements.  Reports  will  include \nevaluation of issues and will recommend remedial actions.  \n \n ", "16   \n2.  Implementation Plan and Project Readiness \n49.   Implementation Period. The Investment Program is scheduled for 6 years, inclusive of \nprocurement  and  construction  activities,  and  is  expected  for  completion  at  the  latest  by \n31 December 2014 (Appendix 8). The physical implementation of Project 1 is expected to be \ncompleted by 30 June 2012. The implementation schedule for the subsequent projects will be \nprepared during implementation of Project 1. The second PFR is expected to be submitted to \nADB Management by June 2009. \n \n50.   Implementation Plan. The transaction team has prepared a project implementation plan \nby linking each of the main tasks under the first tranche to projected individual contracts for \ngoods, works, and services. There is also a higher level implementation plan for the MFF as a \nwhole. The idea behind this plan is to demonstrate project readiness, but also to agree project \nmanagement actions ahead of ADB\u2019s Board of Directors consideration date of the proposed \nMFF. This approach facilitates the work of the ADB and client implementation team. The \u201ccool-\noff\u201d period between Board approval and signing dates will be used to establish the Investment \nProgram team, agree a final organizational structure, define the final team skills mix, and seek \nadministrative and legal approvals. \n \n51.   The anchor for the implementation plan is a management information system connecting \nthe civil works contractor responsibilities, tasks, and time schedules to those of the supervision \nconsultants, the local program management office team, and the ADB staff in charge of program \noversight. The information system will record contract awards and disbursement projections and \nanticipated  dates  for  actions  by  the  contractor,  EA  team,  and  ADB.  It  will  also  provide  a \nsummary of the reports due for management and the financiers. The program implementation \nplan  and  project  readiness  are  summarized  in  Appendix  9  and  detailed  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n52.   Project Readiness. Detailed design works for the road sections under the Investment \nProgram financed by MOTC are under way and expected to be submitted to the State Expertise \n(Gosstroy) for approval by early December 2008. The preparation of safeguard documents, \nincluding the EIA and LARPs for the subsequent projects, is also under way. MOTC has \ninitiated advance contracting as approved by ADB to expedite project implementation.  \n \n53.   For each subsequent project, MOTC, with assistance of the PMC-ADB, will prepare (i) a \nproject report, including technical, economic, financial, environmental, and social assessments; \nand  (ii)  a  PFR.  The  project  report  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  and \nprocedures stated in Appendix 10, and other related requirements of the Government and ADB. \nAfter  appraising  each  project  for  technical  and  economic  feasibility  and  compliance  with \nsafeguard requirements, MOTC will submit to ADB a summary appraisal report to be agreed \nbetween ADB and MOTC. ADB will then undertake due diligence in accordance with its relevant \npolicies and procedures, and approve the appraisal, subject to any amendments. If required by \nADB, MOTC will amend the PFR and submit it to ADB for approval on or before the due date of \nthe  PFR.  Meanwhile,  MOTC  will  make  advance  contracting  for  Project  1  and  subsequent \nprojects as approved by ADB to expedite implementation.  \n \n3.  Procurement  \n54.   Procurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed from the ADB and JICA \nloans will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time) and the procurement plans for the projects. The procurement plan for Project 1 is \nin Appendix 11. Procurement plans for subsequent projects will be developed during their \n ", "      17\npreparation. To ensure competitive bidding, international competitive bidding (ICB) contract \npackages will be adopted. ICB will be used for civil works over $3 million and for goods over \n$1 million. National competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works could be conducted for contracts \nnot exceeding $3 million. Civil works contracts will be procured through ICB among pre-qualified \nbidders. ADB\u2019s prior review procedures will be followed. MOTC agreed to include the relevant \nsections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  in  all  bidding  and \ncontractual documents.  \n \n55.   The Investment Program will only involve ICB procurement. If there is a need for NCB \nprocurement, before commencement of NCB procurement, ADB, JICA, and MOTC will review \nthe Government\u2019s procurement procedures to ensure consistency with ADB requirements. Any \nnecessary modifications or clarifications to the Government\u2019s procedures will be reflected in the \nprocurement plan. \n \n56.   Project 1 involves three ICB contract packages for road civil works. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n57.   The Investment Program requires the assistance of consultants. The assistance is split \ninto two: a core team to be engaged upfront and additional inputs to be brought into the \nInvestment Program as and when required. The first will be financed under the first tranche and \nthe latter under subsequent tranches.  It is estimated that a total of about 814 person-months of \nconsultancy services (179 person-months international and 635 person-months national) will be \nneeded for Project 1. About 52 person-months of international consultants and 98 person-\nmonths of national consultants will be required for the PMC-ADB. About 94 person-months of \ninternational consultants and 504 person-months of national consultants will be recruited for \nsupervision construction. About 21 person-months of international and 21 person-months of \nnational consultants will be required to assist MOTC in improving the road maintenance system. \nApproximately 12 international and 12 national consultants will be recruited to help MOTC \ndevelop an ITS strategy.  \n \n58.   All consultants financed from ADB and JICA loans will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and the \nprocurement plans for the projects. Consulting firms will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures. Full technical proposals will be required for the \nPMC-ADB,  construction  supervision,  improvement  of  the  road  maintenance  system,  and \ndevelopment of ITS. The outline of terms of reference for consultants to be recruited under \nProject 1 is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n59.   ADB Management has approved advance action for procuring civil works to be financed \nby ADB under the Investment Program. MOTC has been informed that approval of advance \ncontracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Investment  Program  or  any  project.  No \nretroactive financing is envisaged. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n60.   ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nMOTC. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to projects. To support these efforts, relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding \n ", "18   \ndocuments  for  the  Investment  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the Investment Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Investment Program and individual projects, \nand all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. An anticorruption action \nplan was agreed with MOTC for implementation (Appendix 12). \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n61.   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Direct payment procedures will be used for \ncivil works contracts and consulting services. No imprest account will be required. The proposed \nfund flow is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n8.  Financial Accounting and Auditing \n62.   The Government through MOTC and the Ministry of Finance will (i) maintain separate \naccounts  for  each  of  the  projects  under  the  Investment  Program;  (ii)  have  such  accounts \naudited annually, in accordance with appropriate auditing standards consistently applied by \nindependent auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of reference are acceptable \nto ADB; (iii) furnish to ADB as soon as available but in any event not later than 6 months after \nthe end of each related fiscal year, certified copies of such audited project accounts and audited \nfinancial  statements  and  the  report  of  the  auditors  relating  thereto  (including  the  auditors\u2019 \nseparate opinions on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the financial covenants \nof the loan agreement; and (iv) furnish to ADB such other information concerning such accounts \nand financial statements and the audit thereof as ADB shall from time to time reasonably \nrequest. The independent auditors will be engaged and financed by the Government. A financial \nmanagement action plan was agreed with MOTC for implementation (Appendix 13). \n \n9.  Performance and Monitoring  \n63.   The Committee of Roads, assisted by the PMC-ADB, will establish an ADB project \nperformance  monitoring  system  within  6  months  from  project  commencement  and  collect \nbaseline data for performance monitoring. The key indicators and assumptions outlined at the \nimpact and outcome levels in the Investment Program\u2019s design and monitoring framework will \nbe the primary data required for analysis. \n \n10.  Reviews  \n64.   ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months after signing of the FFA and the \nloan agreement for Project 1. Review missions will be carried out on a semiannual basis jointly \nby  representatives  of  ADB,  Borrower,  MOTC,  and  the  Committee  of  Roads.  The  review \nmissions will assess the project implementation, including procurement, civil works, financing \nstatus,  and  environmental  and social safeguards  based  on  quarterly  progress  reports  and \ndiscuss implementation progress. A mid-term review mission will be carried out 2 years after \neach loan becomes effective. Each mid-term review will evaluate compliance with the terms, \nconditions, and undertakings set out in the FFA, environmental and social safeguards, and loan \ncovenants set out in the loan agreements. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse \ncorrections to ensure successful implementation and the achievement of the project objectives. \nA project completion report will be submitted by MOTC within 3 months of the completion of \neach project. \n \n65.   The  ADB  Resident  Missions  in  Almaty  and  Astana  will  be  asked  to  look  after  the \nInvestment Program jointly with teams at headquarters. Staff will be deployed to Almaty as and \n ", "      19\nwhen  it  is  considered  necessary.  A  fuller  review  will  be  carried  out  1  year  after  loan \neffectiveness. Every year an annual report of the Investment Program will be produced.  The \nreport will cover issues related to each of the components.  It will report on inputs and outputs \nand  start  generating  information  for  the  outcome  and  impact  indicators  of  the  DMF.  All \ncompliance matters will be covered under the review, including warranties and representations, \ncovenants an adherence to ADB policies and procedures. The Project Performance Report will \nbe updated every month and reported to the front office within CWRD.   \n \nIV.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits  \n1.  Economic Benefits \n66.   The improved Investment Program road will permit higher travel speeds, shorten travel \ndistance, and improve the road safety standard. As a result, vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime for users of the improved road will be reduced. The accident rate is also expected to \ndecline. The economic analysis for the road sections in Zhambyl Oblast indicates an average \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  18%  showing  that  the  Investment  Program  is \neconomically viable. The summary of the economic analysis is in Appendix 14. \n \n67.   Project 1 was found to achieve a combined EIRR of 28%. A sensitivity test was carried \nout to assess the impact of different benefit and cost attributes for Project 1. Under the worst \ncase scenario, with traffic 25% less and construction costs increased by 25%, the sensitivity test \ndemonstrated  that  Project  1  is  robust  across  the  broad  range  of  variations  in  these  key \nparameters with EIRR of about 20%. Moreover, the combined effect of excluding generated \ntraffic and ignoring traffic accident savings resulted in an EIRR of about 26%. \n \n68.   A sensitivity test was also performed to examine the effect of delaying implementation of \nProject 1 to 5 years. The EIRR was slightly reduced from 28% to 27%. This suggests that, \ndespite the effect of reducing the discounted construction costs by deferring construction over \n5 years, the overall effect is negative\u2014with reduced net present value and rates of return for all \nsensitivity tests. This sensitivity test further demonstrates that the results for Project 1 are robust \nacross the broad range of variations in these key parameters. \n \n2.  Economic Impacts \n69.   Analysis was undertaken using a forward-looking computable general equilibrium model \nto estimate direct and indirect effects of the corridor development plan. A summary of the \nmacroeconomic assessment is in Appendix 15. This approach captures not only direct costs \nand benefits, but a wide array of economic activities that are facilitated by infrastructure through \ntransport and distribution services. Generally, the cumulative indirect benefits far outweigh direct \nproject  costs  and  benefits,  and  these  benefits  accrue  both  to  Kazakhstan  and  to  many \neconomies linked to it by trade\u2014including neighboring Central Asian countries as well as more \nremote trading partners such as European Union countries. Because of their pervasive linkages, \nmore efficient trade and transport services benefit every sector of Kazakhstan\u2019s economy. By \n2020, the indirect benefits of the road corridor will be more than 10 times the direct project net \nbenefits. \n \n70.   The corridor investment will have significant regional spillovers for Kazakhstan\u2019s trading \npartners, including above all the Central Asian economies whose combined GDP will be 43% \n ", "20   \nhigher  in  2020  compared  to  the  2010  benchmark.  The  effect  is  greatest  for  immediate \nneighbors, like the Kyrgyz Republic, which have high trade shares with and through Kazakhstan \nand relatively low initial GDP. These growth spillovers can be expected to radiate across the \nregion and beyond, and are an important justification for this Investment Program in the regional \npolicy dialogue. Despite their size and diversity, both the Russian Federation and the PRC will \ngain significantly from the entire corridor investment through trade linkages, with real GDP gains \nof 4% for the Russian Federation in 2020 and 6% for the PRC. \n \n71.   It is important to recognize the stakes that all Kazakhstan\u2019s trading partners have in \nregional infrastructure. While the percentage effects of real GDP results in level terms vary with \nproximity, level effects depend on the volume of trade and size (capacity for export production \nand import absorption) of trading partners. Thus, the economies of European Union countries, \nfor example, capture significant nominal benefits from the improved transport infrastructure \nbecause of strong ties to the region through capital goods markets and relatively high import \nand export elasticities. These results support the essential message that the benefits of this \nInvestment Program are truly multilateral. Significant nominal income gains accrue to larger \neconomies, suggesting a broader basis for financing and policy support. \n \n3.  Sustainability \n72.   The Investment Program will be fully public sector investment, as the current traffic of \nabout 4,000 vehicles per day does not justify full private sector investment. However, MOTC will \nconsider offering the Investment Program to the private sector at a later stage when traffic \njustifies  doing  so.  With  EBRD  assistance,  MOTC  is  developing  a  concession  agreement \nbetween the Government and the private sector; and is piloting public\u2013private partnership for a \nroad section of the corridor. Provided this pilot project is implemented successfully, it can be \nreplicated in other highway sections. \n \n73.   The road sector budget will increase up to about 1.6% of GDP by 2012, of which routine \nmaintenance will be about 0.1% GDP. It is expected that the routine maintenance will also \nincrease\u2014reaching 0.3% of GDP\u2014to keep the Investment Program sustainable. \n \n4.  Governance \n74.   A governance assessment was undertaken for the corridor investment by the World \nBank. ADB confirmed the methodology and findings, and the supports the recommendations. \nBased on the analysis of the legislative framework, the effectiveness of regulatory institutions, \nthe strength of enforcement regimes, the capacity of the Committee of Roads and MOTC, the \navailability of human resources, and the risk of corruption, the fiduciary assessment rated the \nenvironment for conducting procurement under the Investment Program as \u201chigh risk\u201d.15 To \nmitigate this, it was agreed that the procurement activities will be delegated to the PMC teams. \nMoreover, a financial management action plan and an anticorruption action were developed. \nThe governance assessment is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n5.  Social Dimensions and Poverty Reduction  \n75.   The Investment Program is a general intervention, as opposed to a targeted intervention \nthat specifically addresses poverty reduction through interventions at the level of households, \nspecific  services,  or  geographical  determinants  of  poverty.  Consequently,  the  Investment \nProgram design does not have to include a poverty reduction strategy.  \n                                                 \n15 World  Bank.  2008.  Assessment  on  Governance  and  Financial  Management  for  Kazakhstan.  South  West \nDevelopment Program (unpublished appraisal mission report).  \n ", "      21\n76.   There will be both direct and indirect beneficiaries of the Investment Program, both in \nKazakhstan and in neighboring countries. The beneficiaries include trading, logistics, and other \nservice  industry  operators.  They  also  include  farmer  communities,  food  and  industrial \nmanufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 16 and the poverty and social analysis is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n77.   The  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  generate  considerable  local  employment, \nparticularly for unskilled labor. Opportunities will vary along the alignment of the Investment \nProgram roads. The Investment Program is not expected to exacerbate gender inequities. \nBetter connectivity can yield important externalities, including access to health and education \ncenters. The program will have gender-related benefits, particularly as urban centers become \nbetter connected to isolated rural areas, thus improving mobility and job opportunities in the city. \nThere are also institutional and change management gains. Opportunities are to be expected \nalong much of the alignment, although female participation may be limited where worker camps \nare established, unless the contractors make special provisions available to attract women to \nthe sites. Highway construction and the development of long-term transit routes will likely lead to \nan increase in the transmission and spread of HIV in many areas. Public information leaflets \nfocusing on HIV/AIDS transmission, and initiated a needle exchange program at one site will be \ndistributed. These initiatives, and others, will be incorporated in the Investment Program. \n \n78.   Kazakhstan  is  a  source,  transit,  and  destination  country  for  human  trafficking;  and \nevidence of internal rural\u2013urban trafficking is growing. The Investment Program is not likely to \naffect current trafficking patterns materially, as the investments themselves will not remove any \nsignificant transit barriers. However, once work on the full corridor is completed, including \nZhambyl Oblast, the improved corridor may be seen by both human and drug traffickers as an \nattractive alternative to the prevailing south\u2013north route. To deter such a transition, one element \nof the communications program for the whole corridor program should focus on human and drug \ntrafficking, aimed at raising public awareness and encouraging civil society engagement to \nprotect potential victims of trafficking and aid efforts to detect and stop traffickers.   \n \nB.  Impacts \n1.  Social Safeguards \n79.   The Investment Program will entail the construction and improvement or rehabilitation of \none or more road sections in Zhambyl Oblast. Other sections will be financed by the EBRD, \nWorld Bank, the Government, and the private sector. Social due diligence has been undertaken \nfor Project 1. \n \n80.   Civil works for Project 1 do not involve LAR, and thus do not require the preparation and \nimplementation of an LARP. The subsequent projects, however, will include the construction of \nroads\u2014with LAR requiring the preparation and implementation of the LARPs. Based on ADB\u2019s \nprocessing requirement for MFFs, MOTC has prepared a LARF reflecting Kazakhstan law, ADB \nprocessing mechanisms, and shared compensation and rehabilitation provisions mandated by \nthe  relevant  policies  of  the  four  concerned  IFIs.16 A  summary  of  social  safeguards  is  in \nAppendix 17 and the LARF is in Supplementary Appendix G.    \n \n                                                 \n16 As per ADB, processing mechanisms and compensation/rehabilitation provisions are based on ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), the LARF, and ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section F2: Involuntary Resettlement. \nManila. \n ", "22   \n81.   Investment  Program  areas  (Zhambyl  Oblast)  are  inhabited  by  a  population  with  an \noverwhelming Kazakh majority. No people fitting ADB\u2019s definition of indigenous peoples are \nexpected to be negatively affected by the Investment Program.  \n \n2.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n82.   Project 1 will have no new impacts on the natural environment along or inside of the \nROW, aside from the possible need to remove a few shelterbelt trees. All attempts should be \nmade to minimize removal of shelterbelt trees, as there are few trees in the area to provide \nshade, bird nesting sites, and wildlife habitat. MOTC is expected to pay special attention to the \nfollowing potential impacts during construction: mismanagement of earthwork and aggregate \nsite operations, mismanagement of lead contaminated soils, mismanagement of construction \ncamp wastes and fuels, mismanagement of asphalt and concrete production, air pollution during \nconstruction, and bridge and culvert replacement and repair. The Investment Program will also \nenhance the capacity of the EA on environmental management through training provided by the \nPMC-WB. \n \n83.   Project 1 has no major environmental impacts and according to ADB guidelines is \nenvironment category B. An initial environmental examination (IEE) and summary IEE (SIEE) \nhave  been  prepared.  The  SIEE  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H  and  the  IEE  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix I. Project implementation will require environmental monitoring as \ndetailed in the environmental management plan (EMP) included in the IEE and SIEE to avoid \nstandard construction impacts. These include environmental standard operating procedures \nsuch as cleaning up construction sites, proper disposal of spoils, grading damaged land and \nreplanting  vegetation,  and  protecting  the  public  from  excessive  noise  and  dust  during \nconstruction.   \n \n84.   The EARF has been prepared to provide guidance in preparation of environmental \nassessments for the subsequent projects (Supplementary Appendix J). This has been prepared \nby the Government in agreement with ADB, and in compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002) and the Government\u2019s environmental assessment regulations and guidelines.  \n \n85.   A cumulative impact assessment has been undertaken for the Investment Program to \nexamine the effects of this and the other donor\u2019s road projects, as well as other initiatives being \nundertaken  in  a  number  of  key  sectors  (Supplementary  Appendix  K).  Valued  ecosystem \ncomponents  have  been  identified  from  environment  subsectors  such  as  air  quality,  social \ndevelopment and poverty alleviation, agricultural development, land use and urban planning, \ntourism, and ecosystem health and biodiversity protection. The cumulative impact assessment \nis founded on comprehensive scoping to identify key valued ecosystem components and their \nindicators to ascertain the potential cumulative effects of multiple development activities. The \ncumulative impact assessment provides a prudent hedge against serious negative effects that \ncould unnecessarily reduce the value of the road development. It also identifies, stimulates, or \nenhances cumulative benefits. \n \nC.  Assumptions and Potential Risks \n86.   The main potential risks to the Investment Program include lack of strict adherence to \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines; start-up delays in implementation of the Investment Program \nparticularly Project 1; and delays in preparatory works for the subsequent projects. Sound, \ntimely, and cost-effective implementation of the Investment Program assumes a professional \nand competent project management function, an unaltered strategy and policy framework, and \n ", "      23\ncontinued institutional changes.  \n \n87.   MOTC is to implement the financial management action plan and the anticorruption \naction plan to ensure that good governance is in place. Start-up delays risk will be mitigated by \nproviding an international procurement specialist under an ADB technical assistance17 grant to \nhelp MOTC procure contractors, suppliers, and consultants until the PMC-ADB is selected. \nDetailed design works for the Investment Program is under way and financed under MOTC\u2019s \nbudget. Training on safeguards has been provided by ADB and the World Bank to national \nconsultants preparing the detailed design. \n \n88.   Exogenous factors such as rising construction costs caused by fuel price increases may \nalso affect the success of the Investment Program, especially with regard to the overall budget \nand current financing plan. Finally, and after construction, the success of the program will \ndepend on how well and how frequently the assets are maintained. The introduction of best \npractice safety measures is also a matter for consideration. \n \n89.   Overall, the chances that implementation will be done on time, within budget and to \ninternational standards, are high. The project management team will be staffed with skilled \npersonnel, national and international. An experienced professional with a record in project \nmanagement and civil engineering will manage this team. The business processes and the \noperating procedures for awarding contracts and then managing them are reasonably well-\nestablished and credible in Kazakhstan. It is also highly likely that the authorities will adhere to \nbest practice when it comes to design and construction standards. Project management will be \ntightened and then monitored through the introduction of a high standard road construction \nmanagement and information system. \n \n90.   The  Government  has  committed  to  the  strategy  and  policy  framework.  The  policy \nframework has all the right principles, including outsourcing to the private sector and regular \nroad maintenance funding. The risk of a policy reversal is low. The same applies to the roles \nand functions of key institutions. MOTC has been restructured and given more of a regulatory \nand supervision mandate. It is unlikely that this institution will be reconverted to operate the \nconstruction and operation of the entire road network on its own. Maintenance remains in public \nhands. One of the key reforms includes the possible reintroduction of a road maintenance fund. \nThis would assure continuity and stability with regard to the financing plan after the construction \nphase.  \n \n91.   The  Government  is  also  assumed  to  continue  improving  cross-border  policies  and \nfacilities,  and  sustaining  policies  conducive  to  economic  growth  and  regional  integration. \nTraining will be given under Project 1 to take care of capacity building needs.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n92.   The Government has given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the \nlegal documents in addition to the standard assurances: \n \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2008.

The Government will keep ADB and IFIs informed in a timely manner of \nany  changes  to  and  progress  in  implementing  the  road  map,  Investment \nProgram, and the financing plan and will consult with them in a policy dialogue \naffecting any of these elements. \n \n(iii)  The Government will make available all counterpart funds required for timely and \neffective  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program  through  annual  budget \nallocations to MOTC, and will ensure that necessary resources thus required are \nreleased in a timely manner. The Government will cause MOTC to include the \nupdated funding requirements for implementation of the Investment Program in \nits annual development program. \n \n(iv)  The Government will cause MOTC to allocate a routine maintenance budget in \naccordance with the 2006\u20132012 RDP and that, each fiscal year after 2012, the \nbudget will be increased by no less than annual inflation rates, provided always \nthat sound fiscal balance is maintained. The Government will allocate and make \navailable, on a timely basis, sufficient funds for the implementation of the RDP. \nThe Government will have such expenditures audited annually and make them \navailable to ADB upon request. \n  \n(v)  The  Government  through  MOTC  will  ensure that  the  Investment  Program  is \ncarried out in accordance with the applicable technical specifications and design, \nand that the construction supervision, quality control, and project management of \nthe Investment Program are performed in accordance with applicable standards \nand  best  international  practices.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  road \nsections  covered  by  the  RDP  are  maintained  in  accordance  with  applicable \nstandards and best international practices. \n \n(vi)  The Government through MOTC will ensure that civil works contracts will include \ncontractor\u2019s obligation to comply with road safety measures. MOTC will monitor \nthe accident rate and traffic volume after commencement of the operation of the \nInvestment Program road. \n \n(vii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  design,  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance of the facilities under the Investment Program are carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, the Government\u2019s environmental \nlaws and regulations, the agreed EARF, cumulative impact assessment, and \nrespective  IEE  for  Project  1  and  EIAs  for  the  subsequent  projects.  The \n ", "      25\nGovernment  through  MOTC  will  ensure  that  potential  adverse  environmental \nimpacts arising from the Investment Program are minimized by implementing all \nmitigation  and  monitoring  measures  as  presented  in  the  environment \nmanagement plan (EMP) included in the IEE and EIA. The Government through \nMOTC will ensure that: \n \n(a)  EMPs are updated prior to issuance of notices to proceed. \n(b)  The  Borrower  has  allocated  and  made  available  to  MOTC  sufficient \nresources  to  implement  and  record  the  implementation  of  the  EMPs \nprepared for the Investment Program. \n(c)  The project director, with assistance of the PMC-ADB and the supervision \nconsultant, prepares semiannual environmental reports and submits them \nADB, within 3 months of the close of each half of the calendar year during \nimplementation of each individual project under the Investment Program. \nThe report will include, among other things, a review of progress made on \nenvironmental measures detailed in the IEE, EIAs, EMPs, and monitoring \nthereof; and problems encountered and remedial measures taken. \n(d)  Detailed  engineering  designs,  civil  works,  and  other  contracts  for  the \nInvestment  Program  facilities  incorporate  applicable  environmental \nmeasures identified in the IEE, EIAs, and EMPs. \n(e)  Civil works contractors are supervised to ensure compliance with the \nrequirements of the IEE, EIAs, and EMPs. \n(f)  The LARF is updated, disclosed, and sent to ADB for review prior to \nappraisal of the tranches. \n(g)  The  summary  EIAs  are  disclosed  to  the  public  120  days  before  the \napproval of the tranches by ADB Management.   \n \n(viii)  The Government will comply with, and will ensure that MOTC complies with, \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. The Government, consistent with its commitment to \ngood governance, accountability and transparency, agrees (a) that ADB has the \nright to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive or coercive practices relating to the Investment Program; and (b) to \ncooperate  fully  with  any  such  investigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary \nassistance, including providing access to all relevant books and records, as may \nbe  necessary  for  the  satisfactory  completion  of  any  such  investigation.  In \naddition, the Government will (a) conduct periodic inspections on the contractors\u2019 \nactivities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (b)  ensure  that  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey  relate  to  the  Investment  Program;  and  (c)  the  construction  supervision \nconsultant shall verify the contractors\u2019 payment certificates in accordance with \nworking  drawings  and  contract  specifications.  MOTC  will  implement  the \nanticorruption action plan (para. 60).  \n \n(ix)  The Government, through MOTC,  will include a specific provision in bidding \ndocuments to ensure that civil works contractors (a) comply with applicable core \nlabor standards, labor laws, and incorporate applicable workplace occupational \nsafety norms; (b) do not differentiate payment between men and women for work \nof equal value; (c) do not employ child labor in the construction and maintenance \nactivities; and (d) to the extent possible, maximize employment of local poor and \n ", "26   \ndisadvantaged  persons  for  project  construction  purposes,  provided  that  the \nrequirements for job and efficiency are adequately met. MOTC will ensure that \nappropriate  entities\u2014for  example,  nongovernment  organizations\u2014disseminate \ninformation on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, to \nthe employees of civil works and contractors engaged under the Investment \nProgram and to members of the local communities surrounding the Investment \nProgram road. \n \n(x)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  Project  1  will  not  involve  LAR  within  the \nmeaning  of  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  applicable \ngovernment\u2019s law and regulations, and the agreed LARF; and all civil works \nunder Project 1 are carried out within existing ROWs. However, if based on detail \ndesign additional land is required triggering any LAR or loss of assets, MOTC will \nprepare, disclose, and implement a resettlement plan in accordance with the \nLARF.  \n \n(xi)  For  the  subsequent  projects  that  will  involve  LAR  and  loss  of  assets,  the \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  no  civil  works  contract  is  awarded  until  the \nrespective LARP has been agreed with ADB based on detailed design. The \nLARPs  must  be  prepared  and  disclosed  to  the  affected  persons  before \nsubmission of the respective PFR to ADB for review. \n \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that the entire Investment Program is carried out in \naccordance  with  the  Borrower\u2019s  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy, and the LARF including, inter alia, the following \nprovisions: \n \n(a)  LARPs  shall  be  prepared  in  consultation  with,  and  disclosed  to,  the \naffected persons in accordance with the provisions of the LARF; \n(b)  The LARPs shall be submitted to ADB for review and clearance prior to \naward of any civil works contract; \n(c)  All land and rights of way required by the Investment Program shall be \nacquired and made available in a timely manner; \n(d)  All  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  shall  be  provided  to \naffected persons prior to their displacement and dispossession;  \n(e)  Efficient grievance redress mechanisms shall be in place in accordance \nwith  the  LARPs  to  assist  affected  persons  in  resolving  queries  and \ncomplaints if any, in a timely manner; \n(f)  Adequate staff and resources shall be made available for supervising and \nmonitoring  implementation  of  the  LARPs.  An  independent  monitor \nacceptable to ADB shall be engaged to carry out external monitoring and \nevaluation of the LARPs and to report the results to ADB on a semiannual \nbasis. Semiannual reports shall be submitted to ADB within 3 months of \nthe end of each period covered. The internal monitoring shall be carried \nout by the raion administration; \n(g)  If during implementation of the LARPs, any changes to the location, land \nalignment  of  roads,  or  additional  environmental  and/or  resettlement \nimpacts are identified, the LARPs shall be updated and prior approval by \nADB and the relevant government agency shall be obtained before further \nimplementation of the LARPs. \n \n ", "      27\n(xiii)  MOTC will maintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify \nthe civil works, goods, and consulting services financed from the loan proceeds, \nthe financing resources received (including counterpart funds) and expenditures \nincurred  for  the  Investment  Program.  These  project  accounts  and  related \nfinancial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing \nstandards by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The Ministry of Finance \nwill submit audited project accounts and audited financial statements to ADB \nwithin 6 months after the end of each fiscal year during project implementation. In \naddition, the Government through the Ministry of Finance shall ensure that an \nannual performance audit for the Investment Program is completed pursuant to \nthe terms of reference to be developed by ADB, provided that all costs incurred \nin  connection  with  such  performance  audits  shall  be  the  Government\u2019s  cost \ncontribution. In addition, MOTC will implement the financial management action \nplan (para. 62).  \n \n(xiv)  The Committee of Roads will ensure that, subsequent to awarding civil works \ncontract under any project, no notice to proceed is issued to contractors for \nrespective sections or parts of the Investment Program road until the applicable \nprovisions of the resettlement plans (including in particular the timely delivery of \ncompensation to affected families) and EMPs have been complied with. \n \n(xv)  Any changes to the location, land alignment of roads, or environmental impacts \non account of detailed designs of related projects will be subject to prior approval \nby ADB and the relevant government agency in accordance with the approval \nprocedures set forth in the FFA. \n \n(xvi)  The Government will cause MOTC through the project director to submit to ADB \nquarterly progress reports within 2 weeks of the quarter to which they relate. The \nGovernment will also cause MOTC to prepare the performance and monitoring \nreports  to  be  submitted  to  ADB  on  a  semiannual  basis.  ADB  shall  review \nquarterly  and  semiannual  reports  during  its  annual  reviews.  A  joint  midterm \nreview shall be carried out 2 years after the loan effectiveness. The midterm \nreview will focus on the engineering, environmental, and social safeguards of the \nInvestment Program; compliance with loan covenants; and review compliance \nwith the undertaking set out in the FFA. The review will allow for any necessary \nmidcourse corrections to ensure successful implementation and the achievement \nof objectives of the Investment Program. \n \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n93.   No withdrawals shall be made from the loan account for Project 1 until ADB has received \nthe Government\u2019s certification, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB that the PMC-ADB \nteam  has  been  adequately  staffed  and  has  become  fully  operational  to  implement  the \nInvestment Program.  \n \nVI.

Introduction \n1.   The economy of Kazakhstan has grown rapidly because of increased prices on its \nleading exports such as oil, metals, and grain. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth has \nreached about 10.6% annually since 2001.1 This growth is expected to continue, leading to an \nincrease in road freight transport (in ton-kilometers) of about 10% per year and a rise in the \nnumber of vehicles of about 5% per year.2 The motorization level of about 100 cars per 1,000 \npopulation is relatively high in the region but low by the European standard of above 300 cars \nper 1,000 inhabitants.3 \n \n2.   Kazakhstan\u2019s vast territory, low population density, mineral resources scattered across \nthe country, and location between Europe and Asia make it one of the world\u2019s most cargo-\nintensive systems. This results in high dependency on the transport system.  \n \n3.   Roads are a key element of Kazakhstan\u2019s transport system, playing an important role in \nproviding access to rural areas, and facilitating transit traffic and in-country transport movement. \nHowever, much of the road network is in poor condition\u2014about 40% of the republican (national) \nroads requires major rehabilitation and proper maintenance. Moreover, the feeder road network \nserving rural population is not fully developed; and is characterized by poor conditions and a low \nservice level, especially during wintertime. This results in high cost of goods\u2014the transport cost \ncomponent is about 10% of the cargo value, which is far above the average of about 4% in \ndeveloped economies (footnote 1). Despite the high costs, the overall domestic transit volume \n(in tons) has grown rapidly, with annual growth of about 10%. A problem tree analysis is in \nFigure A2. \n \nB.  Road Network \n4.   Kazakhstan has three road networks, each under the responsibility of different levels of \nGovernment and their respective road organizations: (i) the republican roads are under the \nresponsibility of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) and are managed by \nthe Committee of Roads, (ii) local or rural roads are under oblasts or provincial governments, \nand (iii) urban roads are under municipality or city authorities. \n \n5.   The  length  of  the  republican  and  rural  roads  by  category  and  pavement  type  is \nsummarized in Table A2.1.  \n \nTable A2.1: Road Network Characteristics \n(kilometer) \nRoad Classificationa  Road Pavement \nType of Roads \nI  II  III  IV  V or No Category  Asphalt  Non-asphalt \nRepublican Roads  680  3,500  16,600  2,100  220  6,900  16,200 \nRural Roads  72  751  18,714  39,289  6,539  6,322  59,043 \nm = meter. \na Category I: 4-lane (2 x 7.5 m), 6-lane (2 x 11.25 m), 8-lane (2 x 15 m); Category II: 2-lane ( 2 x 7.5 m); Category III: \n2-lane (2 x 7.0 m); Category IV: 2-lane (2 x 6.0 m); Category V: 1-lane (4.5 m)  \nSource: Committee of Roads. \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC). 2007.

Road Sector Organization \n6.   Committee of Roads. Republican roads are under the management of the Committee \nof Roads, which has three boards (departments): Operations, Construction and Reconstruction, \nand Quality Control.  \n \n7.   The Operations Board is largely responsible for the collation and checking of the annual \nworks proposals developed by the oblasts, the preparation of the road maintenance budgets, \nrefinement and monitoring of the approved program after funds have been allocated from the \nbudget,  and  regular  inspections  of  the  works  being  implemented  by  the  Oblast  Road \nAdministration.  \n \n8.   The  Construction  and  Reconstruction  Board  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  road \ninvestment  program,  which  is  developed  with  foreign  funding  assistance.  It  develops  the \nprojects from the initial stages through to contract/project completion.   \n \n9.   The Quality Control Board is responsible for reviewing works carried out by contractors \nworking  on  capital  repairs  and  reconstruction  contracts  in  oblasts,  reviewing  supervision \nservices carried out by consultants engaged in capital works and reconstruction contracts, and \ninspecting  and  assessing  the  operations  and  quality  of  service  provided  by  oblast-based \nlaboratories. \n \n10.   There  are  14  oblast-based  road  administrations  with  about  15\u201320  engineers  and \ntechnical staff; each is responsible for managing 1,500 kilometers (km) of roads. The oblast-\nbased road administrations manage the road program, supervise routine maintenance works \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \ncarried out by Kazakhavtodor, develop annual works programs and annual programs, and \nsupervise all road works outsourced to the private sector including reconstruction contracts. \nThey sign all service and works contracts on behalf of the Committee of Roads.  \n \n11.   Kazakhavtodor.  Kazakhavtodor,  a  state-owned  enterprise,  was  incorporated  in  late \n1998 and was made responsible for road maintenance in December 2000. Kazakhavtodor is \nprimarily responsible for routine maintenance, winter maintenance, taking care/expanding the \narea of roadside planting, road inspections and traffic counting. It is also involved in road \ninspection committees. Kazakhavtodor is allowed to compete for midterm maintenance and \ncapital works contracts.  \n \n12.   Procurement. Procurement activities are under the Procurement Department of MOTC. \nThe Procurement Department is involved in managing the whole procurement process until the \nsigning of contracts. The procurement process is largely similar to that used internationally \nexcept that the process is shorter. The bidding is a two-stage process. Bid documentation is \navailable on the MOTC website, which is linked to a government procurement bulletin where \neach contract is listed. The listing for each contract includes all bidding documentation, including \nthe  minutes  produced  at  the  end  of  each  stage  of  the  procurement  process.  All  can  be \ndownloaded from the website. The timelines of procurement and technical evaluation criteria \nhave been clearly defined. \n \n13.   Finance. The Finance Department under MOTC is directly involved in all Committee of \nRoads projects, whether they are domestically funded or assisted by IFIs. It has separate \nsections  for  domestically  funded  and  foreign  funded  projects.  The  Finance  Department  is \ndirectly  involved  in  the  payment  process,  including  the  monitoring  of  expenditure  against \nbudgeted amounts. It is presently working on a financial management system that will be able to \nhandle all projects, whether they are funded from the Republican budget or IFIs.   \n \nD.  Road Funding \n14.   Road funding increased from about $120 million in 2000 (0.6% of the national budget) to \nnearly $1 billion in 2008. The Government has recognized the transport deficiencies and is \nplanning to increase the budget for the road sector. In 2008, road funding represented about 1% \nof GDP with projections aiming to increase this to 2% of GDP. Developed countries without road \nfunds spend on average about 1.0% of GDP on their roads. As expected, countries with road \nfunds spend more with an average of about 1.6% of GDP, of which about 0.3% is spent on road \nmaintenance.  The  current  road  maintenance  budget  of  about  0.1%  of  GDP  is  clearly \ninadequate. \n \n15.   The 2001\u20132005 road sector funding is summarized in Table A2.2 and the Government\u2019s \nRoad Development Program (RDP) for 2006\u20132012 is in Table A2.3. The upgrading works have \nso far focused on key road corridors, and are designed for the increased traffic levels and axle \nloads. Most periodic maintenance works and all rehabilitation, construction, and reconstruction \nworks are outsourced to the private sector.  \n \nTable A2.2: Road Sector Funding 2001\u20132005 \n($ million) \nDescription  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \nConstruction, Reconstruction  151  188  229  256  328 \nRepair and Maintenance  43  50  56  81  130 \nSource: Committee of Roads. \n ", "    Appendix 2  37 \nTable A2.3: Summary of the Road Development Program 2006\u20132012  \nLength of Road  $/Km/Year  Percentage of \nDescription \n(km)  Average of 6 years  Total Allocation \nConstruction and Reconstruction  7,205  120,480  75 \nCapital Repairs (Rehabilitation)  1,660  61,914  9 \nMidterm Maintenance (Periodic Maintenance)  16,800  6,035  9 \nRoutine Maintenance and Repair  23,600  3,296  7 \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Road Development Program for 2006\u20132012. \n \n16.   The RDP proposed a significant increase in expenditure, and a program of works that \nfocuses on national and international road corridors. However, the focus continues to be on \nconstruction and reconstruction rather than on preserving existing investments. It is therefore \nexpected that the cycle of construction and reconstruction will continue for some time, and the \ncosts will remain high\u2014leaving limited funds available for oblast and rural roads. Allocations for \nroutine maintenance and repairs, and winter maintenance, will also be limited. This might lead \nto disruption in some roads, including international roads. \n \nE.  Road Sector Road Map \n1.  Strategic Objective \n17.   Kazakhstan has put together a strategy or road map to develop the transport sector over \nthe medium term. This covers all modes of transport, including national highways, as well as \nprovincial  and  rural  roads.  The  strategy  recognizes  the  need  for  new  assets  (to  increase \nnetwork coverage) and the repair and upkeep of existing ones (to extend their economic life and \nimprove quality). The 2006\u20132015 Transport Strategy outlines transport sector policies and key \nstrategic directions. The main policy objective is to achieve (i) an accessible and affordable \ntransport system, (ii) a safe and environmentally friendly transport system, (iii) an integrated \ntransport system, (iv) self-recovery investment and operation, and (v) private sector-driven \ntransport service provision. \n \n2.  Reform Progress \n18.   Institutional  Restructuring.  Institutional  reforms  took  place  in  early  2008  with  the \nreorganization of MOTC.4 Separation of a number of key functions\u2014procurement, financial \nmanagement, contract supervision, and quality control\u2014has taken place within MOTC. The \nCommittee of Roads, with its oblast-based road administrations under MOTC, is now primarily \nan implementation agency and is taking a lead in implementing the RDP. The changes have \nbeen positive.  \n \n19.   Outsourcing of Road Works. This has been the practice for some times. To improve \nthe work quality of road construction and maintenance, the Committee of Roads has introduced \nextended warranty contracts\u2014with contractors being responsible for guaranteeing their work for \nperiods  of  2  years  for  periodic  maintenance,  3  years  for  rehabilitation,  and  5  years  for \nreconstruction.  \n \n20.   The Committee of Roads has the ability to engage contract supervision for locally funded \ncontracted works, and has established a quality control unit. Routine maintenance and repair \n                                                 \n4  MOTC Decree 1193, 6 December 2007. \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \ncontracts  continue  to  be  single  sourced  from  Kazakhavtodor.  An  experiment  to  outsource \nroutine maintenance to the private sector failed because of the inability of the private sector to \nperform its obligation, especially during wintertime. \n \n21.   Procurement Process. Procurement is under MOTC\u2019s Procurement Department, which \nmanages the whole process including the preparation of contract documents and technical \nspecifications.  The  department  convenes  a  committee  of  representatives  from  relevant \ndepartments of MOTC to oversee a process that is well-defined and has a prescribed schedule. \nThe department oversaw procurement for more than a hundred contracts in 2008.  \n \n22.   Quality Control of Road Works. MOTC has set up 14 oblast-based road materials \nlaboratories.  The  laboratories  inspect  and  assess  the  performance  of  all  road  works  and \nservices contracts.  \n \n3.  Challenges \n23.   Road  Condition  and  Maintenance.  While  the  republican  road  network  has  good \ncoverage,  there  are  missing  links  and  the  rural  road  network  does  not  provide  many \ncommunities with reliable year-round road access.5 Significant sections of the republican road \nnetwork are in poor condition. MOTC aims to achieve about 86% of republican roads and 70% \nof local roads in good condition by 2013 from 62% (republican roads) and 51% (local roads) in \n2006.  \n \n24.   The  roads  performance  has  not  been  up  to  international  standards,  with  major \ninvestment in road rehabilitation and reconstruction being required before their lifetime period \nend. The level and frequency of reinvestment in the network in Kazakhstan is therefore very \nhigh, at $42,000 per km/year for the republican roads in the RDP.  \n \n25.   Road Funding. The investment need for road asset preservation and maintenance is \nhigh. Only 40% of the republican roads are asphalt-based. Missing links also need to be \nconstructed.  Funds  for  road  maintenance  have  increased  under  the  RDP  but  are  still  not \nsufficient. Road maintenance and repairs have been underfunded for some years, but have \nincreased significantly in the last few years with the average allocation for routine maintenance \nand repairs (including winter maintenance) of about $2,000/km in 2008\u2014about 50% less than \nthe Canadian standard for road maintenance. Expenditure on periodic and routine maintenance \nis well below the level necessary for long-term network sustainability, and presently only makes \nup 7% of the budget indicated in the RDP.  \n \n26.   The RDP is still dominated by road reconstruction, rehabilitation, and repairs. There are \ntwo main sources of funding for the road sector: (i) public sector budget and borrowings, and (ii) \nprivate sector sources. Government budget constraints are particularly critical. Funding for the \nroad budget comes from the national budget rather than a specific road fund, although such a \nfund did exist some years ago, and the expenditure gathering mechanisms from that fund still \nexist. However, the revenue is managed by the Ministry of Finance. Private investment in road \ninfrastructure  could  potentially  be  promoted  if  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  is \nimproved.   \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Formulation of Local Road Development \nPlan. Manila (TA 4145-KAZ); and ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the \nFormulation of State Roads Development Plan. Manila (TA 4462-KAZ). \n ", "    Appendix 2  39 \n27.   Road Safety. While the available data indicates that the road situation improved slightly \nin 2007, the number of people killed exceeded 2,000 with a further about 4,700 injured. A fatality \nrate of 18 per 100,000 inhabitants was reported in 2004, which was slightly above the regional \naverage and growing at that time at a rate of more than 10% per annum. The number of people \nkilled between 2005 and 2007 has increased at an annual rate of more than 19% even though \naccidents have only been increasing at around 10% per annum. This suggests that the severity \nof  accidents  is  increasing  at  a  rate  higher  than  the  fatality  rate  (about  15  per  100,000 \ninhabitants) in the eastern European countries (footnote 3).  \n \n28.   Road safety seems to be downplayed in the RDP even though the fatality accident rate \nis one of the highest in the region. Speeding is a key factor in road accidents. Inadequate \npassing opportunities caused by poor sight distances, especially in undulating terrain and poor \nshoulder conditions, make recovery impossible in many areas. The Ministry of Internal Security, \nwhich is responsible for addressing road accidents, analyzes accident data and attempts to \nidentify causes. Past efforts to establish a high level Road Safety Commission have been \nresisted and such an organization does not exist at present. \n \n29.   The Ministry of Internal Affairs is the leading agency responsible, through the State \nTraffic  Police,  for  the  development  of  safety  standards,  rules,  and  regulations;  traffic \nmanagement, surveillance, and enforcement; vehicle inspection; and accident data collection \nand analysis. MOTC is responsible for vehicle certification and developing relevant regulations. \n \n30.   Road design and operations is one of the causes of traffic accidents. Limited sight \ndistance does not meet the international standard in some places. Road signage is generally \ninadequate. The ability of the authority to handle traffic accidents is inadequate. While the Police \nseem to have implemented a program of speed enforcement on some roads, this is limited to \nsettlements. More effort on road safety is clearly required, especially in interurban roads.  \n \n31.   Transit Traffic and Border Crossing. Geographically, the main transport routes in \nKazakhstan are toward the Russian Federation, Europe, and Central Asia. The main road \ntransit routes are to the Russian Federation and Central Asia while those destined for Europe \nand Asia account for less than 5% of the total road transit traffic. A total of 24,000 commercial \ntransit vehicles, including large buses and medium to large trucks, crossed Kazakhstan in 2007 \n(excluding trucks registered in Kazakhstan). A total of about 350,000 ton transit traffic was \nestimated in 2005, which is much lower than its capacity because of deteriorating infrastructure \nand  cross-border  impediments.  Cross-border  issues  include  unreasonable  delays  and \ncomplicated procedures in customs and frontier inspection, contradictions between transport \nlegislation and internationals standards, and a lack of international treaties of transit and traffic \nregulation. Although there have been improvements and there are ongoing negotiations on \ntransit and trade facilitation, border crossing continues to be time\u2013consuming, with long delays \nat borders as loads are inspected and adjusted to accommodate legal limits.  \n \n32.   Road Operations. High fatality rates, truck overloading, and low revenues from transit \ncharges  have  been  partly  due  to  an  inadequate  road  operations  and  traffic  management \nsystem. Road operations and traffic management require reliable and accurate data about all \naspects of the road network. An advance information system could be applied to include axle \nload monitoring and control facilities, road weather information systems, highways advisory \nradio and electronic signs, and traffic recording equipment. Such a system would provide data \nrequired by maintenance managers to make the right winter maintenance decisions to ensure \nthat  road  restrictions  are  minimized  and  costs  are  low,  and  to  inform  road  users  of  road \nconditions in a timely manner. \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \n \n33.   Road Data and Road Planning. The present planning process is not based on the \nactual road or traffic condition. Road and traffic data are incomplete. The 7-year development \nplans are mostly based on norms rather than actual road conditions, capacity deficiencies, or \nroad safety issues. The present system does not provide any reliable indication of the long-term \nconsequences of the strategies and plans being implemented. The existing system of road \ninspections and traffic surveys needs to be modified so that road condition and roadwork needs \n(for the development of the annual maintenance plan) are collected. Traffic surveys also need to \nbe strengthened and expanded, as should the quality of the accident data, so that the causes of \naccidents can be identified.  \n \n4.  Road Development Program \n34.   The RDP comprises physical and nonphysical investments. The planned investment is \nalso  guided  by  the  Transport  Strategy  approved  in  2006.  The  physical  investment  targets \nconstruction and reconstruction of 7,205 km of republican roads; major and minor repairs of \n18,460 km of republican roads; and construction, reconstruction, and repair of 18,089 km of \nlocal roads. The aim is to achieve 86% of the republican roads free from defects in 2013. The \nproposed investment will prioritize the following roads: \n \n(i)  Tashkent\u2013Shymkent\u2013Taraz\u2013Almaty\u2013Khorgos, \n(ii)  Shymkent\u2013Kyzylorda\u2013Aktobe\u2013Uralsk\u2013Samara,  \n(iii)  Almaty\u2013Karaganda\u2013Astana\u2013Petropavlovsk\u2013border of the Russian Federation,  \n(iv)  Astrakhan\u2013Atyrau\u2013Aktau\u2013Turkmenistan border, \n(v)  Bridge construction over Kigach River, \n(vi)  Omsk\u2013Pavlodar\u2013Semipalatinsk\u2013Mykapchagai, \n(vii)  Astana\u2013Kostanai\u2013Chelyabinsk\u2013Ekaterinburg, \n(viii)  Almaty\u2013Ayaguz\u2013Georgiyevka,  \n(ix)  Taskesken\u2013Bakhty,  \n(x)  Chundzha\u2013Kolzhat, \n(xi)  Usharal\u2013Dostyk, \n(xii)  Kyzylorda\u2013Zhezkazgan\u2013Pavlodar\u2013border of the Russian Federation,  \n(xiii)  Zhezkazgan\u2013Petropavlovsk\u2013border of the Russian Federation, and \n(xiv)  Beineu\u2013Akzhigit\u2013border of Uzbekistan. \n \n35.   Table A2.4 reflects the investment plan for the republican roads, showing a target of \nabout 26,000 km of republican roads to be improved. The republican roads, mostly asphalt-\npaved, are the backbone of the road network in Kazakhstan. The budget for the republican road \nworks has steadily increased by about 20% annually in the last 5 years and is expected to \ncontinue increasing at a similar rate. It also shows that about 75% of the budget was allocated \nfor  reconstruction,  16%  for  repair,  and  9%  for  routine  maintenance.  Although  the  budget \nallocated for routine maintenance has increased by 12% annually, it is currently inadequate. \n \n ", "    Appendix 2  41 \nTable A2.4: Road Development Program (Republican Budget) \nYear \nNo.  Activity  Total \n2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012 \nA.

The Government gives high priority to improvement of the Western Europe\u2013Western \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) International Transit Corridor (the corridor) running from \nKhorgos at the border with the PRC, through Almaty and Shymkent, to the western border with \nthe  Russian  Federation.  The  corridor  is  in  bad  condition  and  transit  traffic  and  trade  are \nconstrained by poor infrastructure. Reconstruction of the corridor will improve the road transport \nefficiency following the reduced transport costs and travel time, and improved road operations \nand maintenance system. \n \n37.   The corridor has been defined as corridor 1 out of six priority corridors in the Central \nAsia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy6 \nendorsed by CAREC countries. The Government plans to improve the corridor with assistance \nfrom external sources including ADB, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, \nIslamic Development Bank (IDB),  Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the \nWorld Bank.  \n \n38.   The total length of the corridor is about 2,715 km, of which 2,237 km will be constructed \nand/or reconstructed. The total investment is about $6.7 billion (Table A2.5). Table A2.6 shows \nthat ADB, IDB, and JICA are jointly expected to finance 480 km of the corridor; European Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development 102 km; the World Bank 1,002 km; and the private sector \n504 km. The Government has already completed 478 km and is constructing 89 km. It plans to \ncomplete the corridor by the end of 2012. The overall investment for the corridor will be a mix of \npublic sector investment and public\u2013private partnership. International financial institutions will \nfinance about 53% of the total corridor investment. The private sector is expected to finance \n32% and the Government contribution will be about 15%.  \n                                                 \n6  Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation. 2007.

The roads are designed in accordance with the recommendations of Kazdorproject, the \nconsultant appointed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) to carry out the \nfeasibility study and the preliminary designs following Soviet Technical Norms and Rules (SNIP) \ndesign standards and policies. The cost of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) project road \nsections is mainly based on the design perimeters noted below.1 \n \n3.   Pavement Design Standards. SNIP road design standards and policies have been used \nand harmonized with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials \n(AASHTO) and British standard for concrete pavement in cold climates.  \n \n4.   Cost Estimate. The cost estimate is based on 2001 unit prices, but is escalated based on \nthe annual inflation rate to 2007 (issued by the Government) to reflect current prices. During the \ndue diligence, unit rates were compared with the actual bid rates of recent roadworks and hence \nthe overall cost per kilometer (km) was determined for the Investment Program. It may be further \nupdated after the engineers estimate is completed, based on the detail designs (in progress). \nHowever, it is envisaged that unit costs will remain within current estimates.    \n \n5.   Axle Load and Design Speed. The pavement design was based on 13 ton single axle \nload. The design speed is 120 km per hour for category I and II roads for flat roads, 100 km per \nhour for rolling roads, and 80 km per hour for mountainous roads. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008. Preparing the CAREC Transport Corridor I (Zhambyl Oblast Section) Project. Manila (TA 7071-KAZ). \n ", "48  Appendix 5 \n6.   Category-I Pavement Cross Section. The formation width of a category I pavement, in \naccordance with Kazakhstan standards, is to be 28.50 meters (m) (two 7.50 m carriageway plus \n4.00  m  median  and  3.75  m  outer,  and  1.00  m  inside  shoulders  on  each  side  of  7.50  m \ncarriageway). The right-of\u2013way (ROW) is to be 60.00 m (30.00 m on either side of the centerline \nof the pavement). \n \n7.   Category-II Pavement. The formation width, according to Kazakhstan standards, is to be \n15 m (two 3.75 m carriageway plus 3.75 m shoulders each side). The ROW is to be 40 m (20 m \non either side of the centerline of the pavement). \n \n8.   Concrete Pavement. It will be about a 25\u201328 centimeter (cm) thick (depending on the \nlocation and detail designs) concrete layer as a minimum on a crushed stone base (30 cm) and \ngranular subbase (20 cm), with a geo-textile placed between the concrete and base to prevent \nbonding (to be confirmed after detail design). \n \n9.   Asphalt Pavement. It will comprise 29 cm (surfacing 7 cm and base layers 22 cm) of \nasphalt  concrete  in  3  layers,  on  a  crushed  rock  base  and  granular  subbase  (25  cm),  and \nsubgrade (25 cm) (to be confirmed after detail design). \n \n10.   Design Life. The design life of pavements, for the purpose of economic internal rate of \nreturn  calculations,  is  assumed  to  be  20  years  for  both  concrete  and  asphalt  pavements. \nHowever, the concrete pavement design life is expected to be more than 30 years. \n \n11.   Subgrade Design. The subgrade California Bearing Ratio2 is assumed to be 8% for most \nroad sections and 4% for wet sections (both soaked California Bearing Ratio). Where an existing \nroad is to be reconstructed, the existing pavement will be reused in the new pavement as one of \nthe lower levels of the pavement structure in a stabilized or un-stabilized layer. This may mean \nremoving the material temporarily while the road formation is raised and widened before being \nreturned and compacted. \n \n12.   Bridge Replacement and Repair. Recommendations adopted in accordance with SNIP \nrecommendations. \n \n13.   Drainage.  For  drainage,  hydraulic  and  drainage  design  requirements  based  on  data \ncollected in the field during detailed design phase will be used for longitudinal and cross drainage \ndesign (to drain the water away from pavement gradient). Concrete slabs will be used to reinforce \nthe channels on the high gradient/slopes. At locations with a high water table, special drainage \nfacilities will be provided. Surface and storm water drainage will be designed for 20 years. \n \n14.   Road Safety. The Investment Program road has a high incidence of road fatalities and \naccidents. The road will be designed to improve safety by eliminating any hazardous curves, and \nimproving the road geometrics. Road markings, traffic signs, and traffic signal controls at the \njunctions, and road furniture necessary to improve road safety, will be installed on the Investment \nProgram roads. \n \n15.   Materials. Material investigations will be done at potential borrow pits in the vicinity of the \nroads, using maximum locally available coarse and fine aggregates for subbase, base, and \nwearing course. \n                                                 \n2  California Bearing Ratio is a penetration test for evaluation of the mechanical strength of road subgrades and \nbasecourses. \n ", "    Appendix 6  49 \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN FOR PROJECT 1a \n \n  ADB  Government \nTotal \nItem  Amount  Amount \n%  %  ($ million)\n  ($ million)  ($ million) \nA.

Requirements \n \n1.   The following are the requirements for each road section under the Investment Program: \n \n(i)  The  objective  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  Transport \nCorridor I (Zhambyl Oblast Section) Investment Program is to improve the Western \nEurope\u2013Western China Transportation Corridor running from Khorgos at the border \nwith the People\u2019s Republic of China, through Almaty and Shymkent, to the western \nborder with the Russian Federation. Out of about 2,841 kilometers (km) of the total \ncorridor length, the Government has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nIslamic Development Bank (IDB), and Japan International Cooperation Agency to \njointly assist in the construction and improvement of about 480 km of highway \nsections in Zhambyl Oblast. ADB, through the multitranche financing facility, will \nfinance about 290 km. \n \n(ii)  The projects will be technically sound, and a feasibility study and preliminary design \nwill have been prepared. The Committee of Roads will ensure that the detailed \ndesign reports of the respective packages are prepared within the overall time frame \nagreed for the Investment Program and will be prepared within no more than 5 \nmonths of project approval.  \n \n(iii)  The projects will be economically feasible and financially sustainable, and their \nestimated economic internal rate of return equal to or higher than 12% or an integral \npart of the corridor, based on the economic analysis to be conducted in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.1 \n \n(iv)  Environmental  screening  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines2 will be conducted for all civil work packages. The selected road sections \nwill  not  pass  through  or  be  within  or  less  than  1  km  from  protected  areas  as \ndesignated by the Government, including sanctuaries or national parks. For each \nproject, an environmental impact assessment report will be prepared, including an \nenvironmental management plan, in accordance with the environmental assessment \nand review framework. \n \n(v)  The project roads in line with the larger objectives of the Investment Program will be \nsocially sound and include measures to mitigate any possible social impacts. For \neach  project,  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines on initial poverty and social assessment. \n \n(vi)  Resettlement plans for each civil works package will be prepared in accordance with \nthe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  framework  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). \n \n(vii)  All necessary central and provincial government approval will be obtained. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

Each project will be prepared and processed in accordance the following procedures: \n \n(i)  Detailed  design  for  projects  will  be  conducted  by  consultants  engaged  by  the \nCommittee  of  Roads,  who  will  fill  out  checklists  for  initial  poverty  and  social \nassessment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  environmental  screening.  These \ndocuments will be sent for review to ADB, which may require revisions. \n \n(ii)  Upon completion of the detailed design, the Committee of Roads will prepare and \nsubmit  to  ADB  a  summary  appraisal  report  for  each  project,  together  with  the \nrequired  attachments,  including  LAR  plans,  environmental  assessment,  and \nsummary poverty reduction and social analysis. \n \n(iii)  The Committee of Roads will translate into the local language each project LAR plan \nand disclose it to the affected people before submitting it to ADB. The Committee of \nRoads will revise the resettlement plan if required, based on comments from the \naffected people and ADB. \n \n(iv)  The  Committee  of  Roads  will  disclose  each  project  summary  environmental \nassessment for category A projects to the public 120 days before submitting it to \nADB. \n \n(v)  ADB  will  review  the  summary  appraisal  reports,  together  with  the  required \nattachments.  If  it  finds  that  the  project  does  not  satisfy  eligibility  criteria  and \nprocedures,  or  does  not  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policies,  ADB  may  advise  the \nCommittee of Roads to modify the projects.

Trade Forecast \n1.   The majority of trade in the region runs from east to west through Kazakhstan. Hence, to \nexplore the corridor's potential requires an understanding on the cargo types, major partners, \nand transportation modes. Kazakhstan's largest trade partners are the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), Europe, and the Russian Federation while smaller countries in the region such as \nUzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic comprise a relatively small amount in trade value, despite \ncontributing significantly in trade volumes (tons).  \n \n2.   In general, the region is stable and Kazakhstan enjoys good relations with its neighbors. \nThe following trends are expected: \n \n(i)  The freight movement between the PRC, Central Asian countries, and ultimately \nIran, is expected to fulfill one of the main growth drivers of the corridor, in \nparticular in the Khorgos\u2013Almaty\u2013Shymkent segments. The corridor is expected \nto attract a significant market share for freight of consumer and manufactured \ngoods but not raw materials, even though the service level provided by the \nTrans-Asian Railway is still low. This is partly dependent on the realization of a \nmajor upgrade program of road infrastructure in the Central Asian countries. \n \n(ii)  The  emerging  role  of  the  PRC  as  a  global  manufacturer  and  exporter  of \nconsumer goods, which are more sensitive to door-to-door distribution and in \ntime shipment, will contribute to the fulfillment of the corridor as a west PRC\u2013\nwest Europe link. This is due to the competitive advantage of the corridor for this \ntype of cargo, especially from the western PRC. Production from the eastern \nPRC will continue to be transported by ship or rail because of distance. For other \ntypes of trade, such as energy and raw materials, the corridor is much less \nattractive.  \n \n(iii)  Trade  between  the  PRC  and  Kazakhstan  is  expected  to  grow  above  the \nprojections for PRC\u2019s trade growth. This is due to high yield development plans \nfor  industry  in  western  PRC.  However,  freight  attracted  by  the  corridor  is \ndependent  mainly  on  competition  from  the  (less  quality)  railway  network. \nImproving the border crossing process and implementing the Free Trade Zone \nmay  increase  the  market  share  of  roads  versus  trains  for  small  distance \nconsumer goods freight shipment (i.e., Almaty). \n \n(iv)  Trade between the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan is expected to grow \nsubstantially. However, the majority of the trade is energy and raw materials, \nwhich the corridor will not attract. This is due to the development plans of natural \ngas and oil pipelines. Because of this and the fact that the Russian Federation \ntrades less of other types of cargo, it is expected that the level of freight flows by \nroads in general and through the corridor will not increase. For most of the freight \nthat  will  be  transferred  via  road  between  these  two  countries,  there  is  little \nsubstitution to the corridor because of its superiority in connecting the most \npopulated  and  industrial  regions  of  the  country.  Obviously,  freight  from  the \nAstana region will not utilize the corridor.  \n \n ", "62  Appendix 14 \n(v)  The  low  level  of  trade  between  the  Russian  Federation  and  Central  Asian \ncountries\u2014over 80% of which is by rail\u2014is not expected to change. The freight \nincludes commodities generally transported via railways. The anticipated share of \nthe corridor is insignificant.  \n \nB.  Transport Mode Competition \n3.   The competition between road and rail in a number of major routes determines the trade \nand transport forecast in the corridor. The Trans-Siberian Railway originates in the eastern PRC \nand the eastern Russian Federation and travels through Siberia to Moscow. The Trans-Siberian \nRailway has a limited capacity (about 100 million tons per year) that primarily competes with the \nmuch longer shipping routes. The Trans-Asian Railway network has several routes that will also \ncompete with the corridor.  \n \n4.   The Trans-European Corridor is a planned roadway currently being developed by the \nRussian Federation and international organizations that will run along the two basic routes of \nthe Trans-Siberian Railway. The Asian Highway is another major road that has two primary \ncompetitive routes. In addition to the major highways, there are some regional corridors that \ncould compete with the corridor. Three important major roads include Tashkent\u2013Samarkand\u2013\nAstrakhan\u2013Moscow routes that run west and south before entering western Kazakhstan to \nMoscow. The Almaty\u2013Astana\u2013Ekaterinburg route is competitive for traffic to certain locations in \nthe Russian Federation, but it would primarily affect traffic originating in Kazakhstan. In addition, \nthis route is less attractive than the corridor because of distance and weather condition. The \nUrumqi\u2013Maikapchagay\u2013Omsk  route  connecting  Urumqi  to  the  Trans-European  Corridor  is \ncurrently in a pre-feasibility phase. This road is not expected to attract market share because of \nthe different potential destinations and the poor weather conditions in the region. \n \n5.   Comparison of generalized costs between rail and road among various origins and \ndestinations in Table A14.1 gives a clear picture of the market segmentation. Raw material and \nlow  time  sensitive  consumer  goods  are  transported  by  the  relatively  decayed  rail  system, \nconsisting mainly of the Trans-Siberian and Trans-Asian railways; other types of cargo are \ntransported by road.   \n \nTable A14.1: Cost and Time Comparison between Rail and Road  \nRussian \nKazakhstan- Kazakhstan\u2013\nKazakhstan- PRC\u2013Russian  Federation\u2013 \nRoute  Central Asian  Russian \nPRC  Federation  Central Asian \ncountries  Federation \ncountries \nAverage Travel Time (days)           \nRail  4.5  1.0  8.5  11.5  7.0 \nRoad  1.9  0.5  3.2  4.0  2.3 \nAverage Travel Costs ($/ton)           \nRail  90  10  80  240  60 \nRoad  190  30  240  390  170 \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications. 2007.

TransCad, a geographic information system-based transport model, with shortest route \nassignment, was used to estimate truck traffic. A separate external estimation of private car \ntraffic volume was also used. The base model was run for the conditions of the current situation, \nin which current demand is used and the road network attributes are set to represent the \nexisting  pavement  quality  of  roads  corresponding  to  the  current  average  travel  speed  of \n50 kilometers per hour (km/h). The model has produced the traffic forecasts for the project \ncorridor for 2020 (Table A14.3). The demand forecasts for the project corridor were considered \nfor the following major traffic components: inner traffic of private cars, inner traffic of freight \nvehicles, and external (export, import, and through traffic) traffic of freight vehicles. \n \nTable A14.3: Summary Average Traffic \n(vehicles per day) \nSection  Cars 2006  Cars 2020  Trucks 2006  Trucks 2020 \nKhorgos\u2013Almaty  5,857  22,241  260  5,922 \nAlmaty\u2013Shymkent  3,780  14,352  1,823  7,454 \nShymkent\u2013Russian Federation border  1,570  5,962  955  1,966 \nSource: Ministry of Transport and Communications. 2007.

Generated traffic is additional traffic expected to occur with the project scenario, owing to \nlower transport costs and travel times after completion of the proposed road improvements. For \ninterurban road projects, reduction in vehicle operation costs is generally the main factor driving \ngenerated traffic, with reduction in travel times playing a secondary role. \n \n9.   Generated traffic was estimated as a percentage of normal traffic for each subproject by \n(i) assessing the percentage reduction in vehicle operating costs through a first run of the \nHighway Development Model 4, and (ii) factoring a price elasticity of demand of 0.7. Generated \ntraffic is typically 10%\u201330% of normal traffic where the Investment Program is expected to bring \nsignificant  improvements  in  the  road  condition.  There  are  number  of  bypasses  on  the \nInvestment Program and diverted traffic was estimated for each of the bypasses. \n \n ", "64  Appendix 14 \nD.  Economic Analysis Approach \n10.   Economic analysis was carried out comparing with- and without-Investment Program \nscenarios.  The  base  case  reflects  expected  conditions  in  the  absence  of  the  Investment \nProgram, with maintenance sufficient only to hold the road in its present condition. The project \ncase  involves  initial  investment  followed  by  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  but  with \nexpenditure and frequency of periodic maintenance economically optimum for predicted road \nconditions and traffic flows. \n \n11.   The analysis was conducted by using the Highway Development Model 4. It predicts \naverage  travel  speed,  pavement  roughness,  agency  costs,  and  road  user  costs.  It  also \ncalculates the economic viability of road links. All costs and benefits are expressed in mid-2007 \nprices.  \n \n12.   Economic  analysis  was  conducted  using  the  border  price  numeraire.  A  standard \nconversion factor for non-tradable goods was applied to calculate the economic price of non-\ntradable goods. The shadow wage rates for skilled and unskilled labor were estimated by \ncomparing  the  average  labor  wage  in  the  region  and  the  project  labor  wage,  taking  into \nconsideration the existing unemployment rate. The shadow wage rates for skilled and unskilled \nlabor were adjusted by using a standard conversion factor. The net present value at a 12% \ndiscount factor and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) were calculated to evaluate the \neconomic viability of the Investment Program. \n \n13.   The  economic  costs  were  estimated  based  on  financial  costs,  including  physical \ncontingencies.  Price  escalation  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes  were \nexcluded. Financial costs were converted into economic costs using specific conversion factors \nof 0.92 for road construction and 0.80 for road maintenance.  \n \n14.   A single stage of road development for the Investment Program is envisaged. The initial \ninvestment for civil works will be implemented over a 3-year period from mid-2009 to 2012. A \nresidual value at the end of the evaluation period is estimated at 35% of the initial investment.  \n \nE.  Economic Benefits \n15.   The Investment Program\u2019s primary economic benefits are vehicle operating cost (VOC) \nsavings and travel time savings. Economic benefits to generated domestic traffic are calculated \nas  half of  the  difference  in  unit  VOCs  in  with-  and  without-Investment  Program  scenarios \nmultiplied by generated traffic volumes, in accordance with the \u201crule of the half.\u201d1  \n \n16.   Economic benefits from travel time savings to normal and diverted traffic are calculated \nsimilarly, as the difference in unit travel time under with- and without-Investment Program \nscenarios multiplied by traffic volumes and the value of time. The rule of the half applies \nsimilarly to generated traffic. \n \n17.   Accident cost savings were also taken into account in the analysis on those sections that \nare proposed to be upgraded from category II standard (2 lane road) to category I standard (4-\nlane road with median). They are expected to generate substantial benefits given the alarming \n                                                 \n1  Rule of the half states that the benefits of additional travel are worth half the per-trip saving to existing travelers.

Under  the  without-Investment  Program \nscenario, accident and fatality rates were based on the actual traffic accident data available in \nthe  project  area.  The  relative  reduction  in  accident  rates  arising  from  upgrading  to  dual \ncarriageway was estimated at 24% for fatality rates and 1.3% for injuries based on a previous \nstudy.2  \n \n18.   In the absence of data from Kazakhstan, the values of $400,000 per fatality and $50,000 \nper injury accident were used to value benefits from traffic accident savings. These estimates \nare  comparable  to  those  in  Romania  ($497,000/fatality  and  $59,000/injury)  and  Croatia \n($470,000/fatality and $57,000/injury). The comparison with Romania and Croatia was used to \ndemonstrate that the estimates adopted are likely to be of the right order. Average values for \ndeveloped European Union economies are much higher (in excess of \u20ac1 million per fatality).3 \n \nF.  Findings \n19.   The analysis resulted in an overall EIRR of 18% showing that the Investment Program is \neconomically viable. Project 1 (sections 3 and 6) was found to achieve a combined EIRR of \n28.1%. They are economically justified and provide relatively high returns compared with other \nsections.

A sensitivity test was carried out to assess the impact of different benefit and cost \nattributes. Under the worst case scenario, with traffic less 25% and construction costs increased \nby 25%, the sensitivity test demonstrated that Project 1 is robust across the broad range of \nvariations in these key parameters, with EIRR of about 20% (Table A14.5). Moreover, the \ncombined effect of excluding generated traffic and ignoring accident savings resulted in an \nEIRR of about 26% (Table A14.5). \n \n                                                 \n2  Hopkin, J.M. and D.M.

Another sensitivity test was performed to examine the effect of delaying implementation \nof Project 1 to 5 years. The EIRR was slightly reduced from 28% to 27%. This suggests that, \ndespite the effect of reducing the discounted construction costs by deferring construction over \n5 years, the overall effect is negative\u2014with reduced net present value and rates of return for all \nsensitivity  tests.  This  is  because  the  loss  of  VOC  and  travel  time  savings  outweighs  the \ndiscounted construction cost savings. This is particularly the case with section 6, which under \nthe main case is constructed in advance of section 5. In the case of deferred construction, the \ntraffic is diverted away from section 6 immediately after opening, whereas in the base case, \nthere are significant benefits prior to traffic being diverted away to the bypass. Nonetheless, \nthese sensitivity tests further demonstrate that the results for Project 1 are robust across the \nbroad range of variations in these key parameters. \n ", "    Appendix 15  67 \nSUMMARY MACROECONOMIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n \nA.  Economy and Trade \n1.   Kazakhstan\u2019s economy has grown rapidly because of increased prices on its leading \nexports such as oil, metals, and grain. The key economic indicators are in Table A15.1. Gross \ndomestic product (GDP) has increased by about 10.6% annually since 2001.1 Kazakhstan\u2019s \nGDP reached about $104 billion in 2007, almost double from 2005. It is projected that the GDP \nwill grow annually by 5% in 2008 and nearly 8% in 2013.2 \n \n2.   Kazakhstan makes a significant investment in infrastructure to reduce the infrastructure \nbottleneck. However, the process has only been partially successful since on average transport \ncosts are still 10%3 of the total cargo value, compared to less than 4.0\u20134.5% in developed \ncountries. Despite the high costs, growth of the overall domestic transit volume (in tons) has \nbeen strong, with annual growth of about 10%.  \n \n3.   The majority of trade in the region runs from east to west through Kazakhstan. Hence, to \nexplore the corridor's potential requires an understanding of the cargo types, major partners, \nand transportation modes. Kazakhstan's largest trade partners are the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Europe, and the Russian Federation (Table A15.1). Smaller countries in the region, such \nas Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, comprise only a relatively small amount in trade value, \ndespite contributing significantly in trade volumes (tons).  \n \nTable A15.1: Kazakhstan's Main Trading Partners, 2006 \n(\u20ac billion) \nItem  Amount  Share (%) \nEuropean Union  16.3  36 \nRussian Federation  10.6  24 \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of  6.8  15 \nTurkey  1.3  3 \nUnited States  1.3  3 \nOthers  8.8  20 \n  Total  45.1  100 \nSource:  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications.  2007.

To explain the effects of this large-scale corridor investment including the Investment \nProgram, its properties are decomposed into one baseline and four incremental policy impact \nscenarios. The baseline summarizes consensus growth estimates over the scenario period \n(2008\u20132020), assuming no action is taken on the corridor roads. The following summarizes the \npolicy scenarios: \n \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC). 2007.

The first scenario assumes that only the direct benefits of the corridor investment are \nrelevant.  This  includes the  impact of  direct  expenditures and  the  usual  direct  assessment \nvariables, such as VOCs and other direct benefits to users of the infrastructure. Direct benefits \nare  essential  to  understanding  the  local  returns  to  infrastructure,  but  they  fail  to  capture \nextensive linkage effects across supply and expenditure chains. Moreover, the reduction in \ntransport cost expands the physical horizon of profitability for all transport services, and can be \nexpected to increase capacity use across a wide spectrum of activities. This not only increases \nthe road use, but also integrates the national and regional economy, increases product variety, \nand  sharpens  comparative  advantage.  These  will  increase  trade  and  unit  profitability  by \nrealizing economies of scale. \n \n6.   The second policy scenario measures the contribution of trade and transport productivity \ngrowth as distribution sectors experience lower costs and pass these gains on to all their client \nsectors. The result is more transport-intensive growth for the economy at the national, regional, \nand  global  levels.  Because  distribution  services  are  essential  to  market  access,  rising \nproductivity in the sector accelerates trade for all other sectors, conferring growth leverage from \ntransport services to the rest of the economy. \n \n7.   The third scenario component captures the benefit of reduced delays, product losses, \nand depreciation on transport-related products. For perishable products like agriculture, such \nlosses can be prohibitive, and reducing them significantly can dramatically increase rural market \nparticipation. For other commodities, even nonperishables, delays still induce economic losses \nbecause they increase inventory and storage costs.  \n \n8.   The fourth and final scenario component is to show the effect of falling trade, transport, \nand transit margins\u2014both domestically and across Kazakhstan\u2019s borders. In the Central Asian \ncountries, transport margins can be very high, and in some cases exceed 100% because of low \nquality roads, border delays, and other soft and hard infrastructure obstacles. Corridors like the \none being evaluated can dramatically reduce these costs, increasing the profitable scope of \ntrade as well as its intensity.  \n \n9.   Table A15.2 summarizes the key estimates of impact indicators. When all direct and \nindirect impacts are taken into account (the all-inclusive trade scenario), completing the overall \ncorridor  would  lead  to  68%  higher  real  GDP  for  Kazakhstan  by  2020  compared  to  2010 \nbaseline. These results are a testament to the pervasive contributions of infrastructure as an \neconomic growth catalyst, and reach far beyond the direct financial effects. \n \n ", "    Appendix 15  69 \nTable A15.2: Key Project Impact Indicators \n(annual percentage change from 2010 baseline) \nImpact Indicators  Subject  2020 \nGDP  Kazakhstan  68 \nOutputs  Transport  79 \n  Distribution  77 \nExports  Total  32 \nImports  Total  33 \nOther Central Asian countries 43 \nRussian Federation  4 \nGDP \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of  6 \nEU   4 \nOther Central Asian countries 50 \nRussian Federation  25 \nExports \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of  36 \nEU  28 \nOther Central Asian countries 48 \nRussian Federation  27 \nImports \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of  37 \nEU  30 \nEU = European Union, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2007.

Figure A15.1 summarizes the macroeconomic impacts of the corridor investment in \nnominal  value  of  GDP  (constant  2010  United  States  [US]  dollar)  in  Kazakhstan\u2019s  trading \npartners from the baseline. As expected, because of the proximities and the initial conditions of \nthe countries (i.e., relatively low income), the main beneficiaries of the corridor investment are \nKazakhstan  and  closer  regional  neighbors.  It  is  important  to  recognize  the  stakes  that  all \nKazakhstan\u2019s trading partners have in regional infrastructure. While percentage effects vary with \nproximity, the nominal effects depend on the volume of trade and size of trading partners. Thus, \nthe economies of the European Union capture significant benefits from the improved corridor \nbecause of their strong ties to the region. Significant growth accrues to larger economies, \nsuggesting a broader basis for financing and policy support. \n \n11.   The growth benefits of the corridor investment indicate how real GDP increases showing \nthe importance of the indirect effects. Direct effects are nonexistent for Kazakhstan\u2019s trading \npartners because the corridor investment is in the territory of Kazakhstan, yet they benefit quite \nsignificantly from linkages of their economies through the corridor (Figure A15.2). Even in \nKazakhstan, which captures all direct benefits, the indirect effects are about 10 times greater as \nthe efficiency benefits of improved transport spread across all market-related activities in the \neconomy. Indeed, higher productivity from transport and distribution services constitutes the \nlargest component of induced growth. \n \n \n \n \n ", "70  Appendix 15 \nFigure A15.1: GDP Growth in Nominal Value \n($ million compared to 2010 baseline)\n600\n500\n400\n2015\n300\n2020\n200\n100\n0\nKazakhstan Other Central China, People's Russian EU\nAsian countries Republic of Federation\n \nEU = European Union, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2007.

Table A15.3 summarizes the growth of the target sectors for the corridor investment, \nincluding both direct and indirect effects that include output and trade statistics for Kazakhstan\u2019s \ntransport  and  distribution  sectors  in  the  baseline  (2010)  situation  and  with  the  corridor \ninvestment in 2020. The output variable measures the total value of transport and distribution \nservices provided, while imports and exports measure the value of these services provided to \nand from foreign markets, respectively. For example, without the corridor investment, the output \nof the transport and distribution sectors rises from $56,333 million to $76,664 million from 2010 \nto 2020. With the corridor investment, the latter figure is nearly double at $137,560. \n \nTable A15.3: Trade and Transport Sector Growth \n($ million) \n    2020 \nWithout Corridor  With Corridor \nItem  2010 \nInvestment  Investment \nOutput  53,333  76,664  137,560 \nExports  3,873  5,429  8,857 \nImports  1,481  2,076  2,546 \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank.  2007.

It is apparent that the overall benefits of the corridor investment far outweigh its costs. \nThe trans-boundary spillovers confer significant growth leverage to other regional economies \nand benefit more distant trade partners. More specifically, direct benefits are small compared to \nthe productivity, efficiency, and trade stimulus effects. Productivity gains are the largest source \nof growth benefits, but reduced losses and trade stimulus are of nearly equal benefit. Trade \nbenefits help the overall economies, and extend far beyond the borders of Kazakhstan to large \nbut distant trading partners such as the European Union and the US.  \n \n \n \n ", "72  Appendix 16 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Kazakhstan/CAREC Transport Corridor I (Zhambyl Oblast Section) [Western Europe\u2013Western \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China International Transit Corridor] Investment Program \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Central and West Asia Department/ \nMultitranche Financing Facility \nModality:  Division:  Infrastructure Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThis poverty and social analysis relates to part of the Western Europe\u2013Western PRC International Transport Corridor \nin Zhambyl Oblast, the main artery through the oblast. The highway is to be upgraded under the Investment Program. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Islamic Development Bank \nwill cover the whole oblast, about 480 kilometers (km). The Investment Program is part of the 2,715 km of the \ncorridor, which extends from the People\u2019s Republic of China border at Khorgos to the Russian Federation border at \nSyrym. The Kazakhstan budget, World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the private \nsector are financing other parts of the corridor.   \n \nThe Government is committed to creating enabling conditions for diversification and increased competitiveness of \nnon-oil sectors; promotion of human development; and promotion of good governance. Joint efforts to promote \u201cpro-\npoor growth will seek to maximize horizontal and vertical linkages of the productive sectors, increase employment, \nharness rural-urban synergies at the intra- and inter-oblast levels, and promote domestic and foreign trade.1 To that \nend, transport development is one of the six topics for dialogue and intervention included in ADB\u2019s strategy, focusing \non  \u201csupporting  road  transport  development(s)  that  improve  and  maintain  existing  infrastructure,  facilitate \nimprovements to transport services through support for intermodal development and creation of competitive transport \nmarkets\u201d. As part of the large support for the whole corridor from international financial institutions, the development \nof this corridor will also help \u201censure greater regional economic linkages by improving regional trade links\u201d. \n \nThe key challenge to sustainable poverty reduction is the limited economic and job opportunities largely caused by \nthe narrow productive base in the non-oil sectors, especially in rural areas. The situation is exacerbated by \nenvironmental degradation and deteriorating support infrastructure. The Government and ADB\u2019s efforts in pro-poor \ngrowth will seek to maximize horizontal and vertical linkages of the productive sectors, increase employment, harness \nrural-urban synergies at the intra- and inter-oblast levels, and promote domestic and foreign trade.  \n \nThe Investment Program is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update (2006\u20132008) for Kazakhstan, \nwhich includes support in the transport sector focusing on national networks that are critical links in the regional \nnetwork. It is also consistent with the agreement, where support to road transport development is one of the main \nfocuses of the medium-term strategy. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                      Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nA brief social analysis was prepared for the feasibility study of the whole corridor undertaken in 2007 by the Ministry \nof Transport and Communications (MOTC). The work provided some background data for this poverty and social \nanalysis, supplemented by field visits and other different published materials. \n \nThe Investment Program will provide support to road transport in Kazakhstan. The Investment Program will contribute \nto  sustainable  economic  growth  by  fostering  physical  infrastructure  and  development,  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment, and regional cooperation. The Investment Program does not have a direct poverty reduction impact \nand is hence classified as general intervention. Consequently, the Investment Program design need not include a \npoverty reduction assessment and strategy.  \n \nNo stakeholders are expected to experience long-term negative impacts because of the investment. The impact of \nshort-term  disruptions  and  detours  can  be  minimized  through  a  carefully  designed  and  implemented  public \ninformation strategy that keeps people informed about the location, duration, and consequences of such disruptions; \nand thereby enable them to schedule their activities to avoid bottlenecks and delays. The Investment Program is \nexpected to generate considerable local employment, particularly unskilled labor during construction.  \n ", "Appendix 16    73\n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nZhambyl Oblast is considered one of the less developed parts of Kazakhstan. Population is centered along the rivers \nand near the foothills; the northern area is desert. This is principally a region of irrigated agriculture\u2014vegetables, \nwine, cotton, sugar beet, and rice. Agriculture spurred intensive development of the food and light industries. There \nare also phosphate mining, metallurgy, mechanical engineering, oil production, and refinery industries2 in the oblast \nas well. \n \nZhambyl Oblast covers 144,300 km2. The oblast center is Taraz, once a main stop on the Silk Road, with the \npopulation of 336,100 (34% of the total oblast population). There are 10 raions (districts), 12 urban settlements, and \n367 villages in the oblast. Most of the villages and urban settlements were constructed as part of the state and \ncollective farm structure. Statistically, Zhambyl oblast has an employment level of 90% (448,000), which is close to \nthe national average employment of 92%. \n \nUnemployment rates vary significantly\u2014as much as 9.5%\u2014from one raion to another. The highest unemployment \nrates are in the town of Taraz (14.3%), Mojynkum raion (13.2%), and Turara Ryskulova raion (11.7%). The lowest \nunemployment rates are in Sarysuy (4.8%), Korday (5.0%), and Shu (6.8%) raion. In 2004, 18.3% of the Zhambyl \npopulation was below the minimum subsistence level, 14.6% in urban areas and 21.2% in rural areas. Household \nexpenditures averaged 46% for food, 31% for nonfood items, and 23% for services.5 Monthly average wages in the \noblast region are 66% of the national average, and household consumption is 71% of the national average.3 \n \nProject 1 includes two distinct types of terrain and settlement. Section 3 (Km 404 \u2013 483) goes east from Taraz, the \noblast center and a former stop on the Silk Road, passing through a desert area with little inhabitation and wide vistas \nof the mountains to the south and the steppes to the north. The terrain is flat and occasionally rolling segment of the \nroad near Taraz has a double carriageway; the remainder is a two-lane road. There are no visible encroachments on \nthe right of way (ROW) and the road traverses few villages. In contrast, section 6 (Km 214 \u2013 260) is in a more \ndensely populated area and characterized by more intensive and varied agriculture. Compared to section 3, section 6 \nhas large tracts lined with trees that were undoubtedly planted as windbreak. The terrain is flat and the road is \nstraight, with gentle curves as it winds through the countryside.  \n \nProject 1 will transform the segment into a category 1 highway staying within the existing ROW, with little visible \nimpact. Reconstruction of section 3 will not change local transportation access or traffic patterns, although it is \nexpected to increase transit traffic significantly once work on the whole corridor is completed. Small villages are \nfrequent in section 6, especially compared to section 3, all of which are typical of collective and state farm settlements \nin southern Kazakhstan. Also consistent with other areas, village settlements respect the highway ROWs and there \nare no visible signs of encroachment by permanent structures. The reconstruction in section 6 will leave the road as a \ncategory 2 highway, fully within the existing ROW, so there should be no need for permanent land acquisition or \nrelocation on temporary structures. Highway improvement will not materially change local transportation access or \ntraffic patterns. \n \nThe investment does not raise any social issues that require additional investigation prior to program implementation. \nThe challenges and opportunities are clear and simple, and no new social risks are likely to emerge. Consequently, \nrather  than  recommend  more  in-depth  analysis  during  program  preparation,  this  poverty  and  social  analysis \nrecommends that a social assessment be undertaken and used for three purposes: (i) inform people about the \nInvestment Program and expected schedule, (ii) identify local concerns that have not emerged, and (iii) establish a \nsocioeconomic baseline for eventual use in program monitoring and impact evaluation.   \n \nHighway construction and the development of long-term transit routes have promoted the transmission and spread of \nHIV in many areas. In Kazakhstan overall, the HIV infection rate of women is increasing and the prevalence of \ninfection among drug users is declining,4 suggesting that attention should be given to transit routes as points of \ntransmission. The Investment Program will conduct public information on HIV transmission and initiate a needle \nexchange program at one site. The Investment Program is not likely to affect current trafficking patterns materially, as \nthe investments will not remove any significant transit barriers. However, once work on the full corridor including \nZhambyl Oblast is completed. , the improved corridor may be seen by both human and drug traffickers as an \nattractive alternative to the prevailing south\u2013north route.   \n ", "74  Appendix 16 \n \nB.

Kazakhstan has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) together with Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency and Islamic Development Bank to finance the Central Asia \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Transport  Corridor  I  (Zhambyl  Oblast  Section) \n[Western Europe\u2013Western People\u2019s Republic of China International Transit Corridor] Investment \nProgram to be implemented by the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) as the \nExecuting  Agency  (EA)  and  the  Committee  of  Roads  as  the  Implementing  Agency.  ADB \nfinancing will be through a multitranche financial facility (MFF). The Investment Program will be \ndivided in three tranches, each entailing projects aiming at the construction, improvement, or \nrehabilitation of one or more legs of the Zhambyl Oblast Section of the Western China\u2013Western \nEurope Transportation Corridor Highway. Other sections of the highway will be financed by \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank, private sector, and the \nGovernment.. \n \n2.   Appraisal has been undertaken for the first MFF tranche, which does not include projects \nwith land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) and thus does not require the preparation and \nimplementation of LAR plans (LARPs). The subsequent tranches, however, will include projects \nwith LAR, for which the preparation/implementation of LARPs will be necessary. Based on \nADB\u2019s processing requirement for MFFs, MOTC prepared a LAR framework (LARF) reflecting \nKazakhstan\u2019s law, ADB\u2019s processing mechanisms, and shared compensation and rehabilitation \nprovisions mandated by the relevant policies of the four concerned IFIs.1    \n \nB.  General Procedures \n3.   The MFF/each tranche appraisal will require the preparation of the following documents:  \n \n(i)  a LARF for the whole MFF to be reviewed, updated, and reapproved by ADB \nannually and before the preparation of each tranche; \n(ii)  an initial poverty and social assessment for each tranche indicating whether \nLARP impacts are expected, and if so their type and magnitude; and \n(iii)  LARPs for each project with detailed design/impact figures and compensation \nbudgets and schedules.2 \n \n4.   The appraisal of the MFF and of each project and the approval/implementation of each \nproject under a tranche will have to meet the following LAR-related conditions. \n \n(i)  MFF/tranche 1 appraisal: preparation of LARF for the MFF and LARPs for all \nprojects with LAR impacts;3  \n(ii)  subsequent tranche appraisals: LARF review/update and preparation of LARP for \nall projects with LAR impacts; and \n(iii)  start of project civil works: full LARP implementation. \n                                                 \n1  In accordance with ADB, processing mechanisms and compensation/rehabilitation provisions are based on ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), the LARF, and ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section F2: Involuntary \nResettlement. Manila. \n2  ADB.  2006.  Operations  Manual.  Section  F2/OP:  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  Section  BP  Involuntary \nResettlement. Manila, a resettlement plan\u2019s complexity rests on impact severity. If impacts are severe (> 200 \npeople resettled or with >10% income losses), a project is classified category A and a full LARP is prepared. If \nimpacts are not severe (<200 people resettled or with <10% income losses), a project is classified category B and \nonly a short LARP is prepared. \n3  A LARF has been prepared for the MFF. LARPs are not required for tranche 1. \n ", "                  Appendix 17  77\nC.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework \n5.   The Government has agreed to apply the following principles in the acquisition of private \nland and resettlement of households for investments on the corridor, which reflect the principles \nincorporated in the resettlement policies of ADB and the other IFIs. The principles apply to \ntemporary or permanent impacts resulting from loss of land, structures, or other fixed assets; \nchanges in land use or business; and restrictions on the use of land, housing, or businesses. \nThe principles apply to affected persons experiencing impacts caused by LAR for state needs.   \n \n6.   The policies have a number of principles that must be adhered to in designing and \nimplementing the investments: \n \n(i)  Avoid or minimize LAR. \n(ii)  Affected persons are entitled to be compensated at full replacement cost for their \nlost assets, incomes, and businesses, including temporary losses or impacts, \nwithout adjustments for depreciation. \n(iii)  Compensation  should  enable  affected  persons  to  restore  their  pre-project \nincomes and standard of living by the end of the project. \n(iv)  Affected persons must be consulted and participate in resettlement planning. \n(v)  Affected persons must be fully informed of their compensation options. \n(vi)  Land-for-land swap is the preferred compensation for lost agricultural land, if it is \navailable, unless the affected person chooses cash compensation. \n(vii)  Costs of transfer of property\u2014purchase or swap\u2014are waived or borne by the \ninvestor, including taxes, fees, documentation, and court appeals. \n(viii)  Compensation will be made giving equal consideration to women and men. \n(ix)  Lack  of  formal  title  or  use  agreement  does  not  bar  affected  persons  from \nentitlements or assistance required to achieve the objectives of the policy. \n(x)  Relocated  affected  persons  receive  relocation  and  transition  subsistence \nallowances. \n(xi)  Special attention should be given to households headed by women and other \nvulnerable persons, and appropriate assistance provided to assure that their \nliving standards are maintained or improved. \n(xii)  LAR is executed as part of the project and fully funded. \n(xiii)  Compensation will be fully provided before land is entered for civil works or \ndemolition. \n \n7.   Entitlements and Compensation. Compensation and entitlements must assure that \naffected persons maintain or improve their standard of living after the project.

Institutional Responsibilities. The Committee of Roads through a project director has \nthe overall responsibility for LAR preparation, implementation, and financing with the assistance \nof a project management consultant (PMC). At the PMC, LAR tasks will be handled by a LAR \nconsultant. The PMC will be assisted by a construction supervision team and by nongovernment \norganizations or impact assessment/valuation consultants hired for impact surveys/monitoring \nassistance. The PMC will coordinate with raion governments that have jurisdiction over land \nadministration/valuation.  \n \n9.   The LARPs will be mostly implemented by raion-level officials, with the support of the \noblast administration, civil works contractors, and officials of local self-government. Evaluation \nand compensation are managed  by a raion-level commission established for the purpose, \nincluding staff of the raion administration and officials representing different relevant offices, \nsuch as agriculture, forestry, roads, land resource management, and registration.   \n \n10.   Disclosure/Public  Consultation. The consultation process begins when the akimat \nnotifies  potential  affected  persons  that  their  lands  may  be  subject to  being  reserved.  The \nvaluation process also involves direct consultation with affected persons and is expected to \nresult in satisfactory agreements. Affected persons can discuss their concerns with officials and, \nif dissatisfied, can appeal to the court for a binding valuation. \n \n11.   The LARF has been uploaded on the ADB website and LARPs in English will be posted \non  the  ADB  website  after  EA  endorsement.  LARFs  and  LARPs  in  Russian  and  Kazakh \nlanguages will be disclosed on the project website, MOTC website, at the offices of the Oblast \nCommittee  of  Roads  and  respective  raion  akimats.  Finally,  a  primer  in  local  language \nsummarizing compensation provisions will be sent to all affected persons.  \n \n \n \n ", "80  Appendix 17 \n12.   Grievance  Procedures.  All  project-related  complaints  will  be  handled  through LAR \ngrievance mechanisms that follow the existing pattern and will be described in the project\u2019s \ninformation brochures and posted in local offices: (i) affected persons take their complaints to \nthe head of local self-government, who registers the complaint and attempts to resolve it. If the \ncomplaint is not resolved in 1 week, it is passed to the raion level; (ii) a designated person in the \nraion administration receives the complaint, registers it, and attempts to resolve it. If there is no \nresolution in 2 weeks, it is passed to the oblast level; and (iii) a designated person in the oblast \nadministration receives the complaint and attempts to resolve it. If there is no resolution within \n2 weeks, it is passed to project management for resolution on a priority basis.4 If again after this \nlast step, no solution is found, the affected persons can bring their case to the appropriate court \nof law.  \n \n13.   Alternatively, persons who feel that their grievances are not given adequate attention \ncan contact project management. The monitoring and evaluation officer will acknowledge and \nregister such complaints and seek resolution, reporting to the complainant on a weekly basis.  \n \n14.   Monitoring and Evaluation. LAR will be monitored internally and externally. Internal \nmonitoring will be carried out by the raion administration, which will report to the EA on a \nmonthly basis. The work will be overseen by the project management team LAR specialist.    \n \n15.   The Investment Program will hire an external monitoring agency, which will carry out an \nindependent assessment of the resettlement process and outcomes to be submitted every \n6 months  to  the  EA  and  ADB.  The  external  monitoring  agency  will  assess  whether \nimplementation complies with provisions of the resettlement plan, if the livelihoods of affected \npeoples have been restored, and whether or not any unintended or unanticipated resettlement \nimpacts have occurred. \n \n16.   Finances  and  Schedules. The cost of administrative oversight and monitoring and \nevaluation activities will be included in the project budget and reflected in the LARP budget. \n \n                                                 \n4  This procedure differs from standard practice in that each of the designated officials at the self-government, raion, \nor oblast levels will be required to register the complaints and keep track of their status, reporting monthly to project \nmanagement. Reports and grievance resolution will be subject to follow-up by the external monitoring and \nevaluation team, and by project management. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081023084543+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081125103711+08'00'", "Title": ""}}
