The  Investment \nProgram  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  its \npartner  organizations,  and  the  Government  will  be  governed  by \nthe frameworks. The first tranche has been subjected to standard \ndue diligence on environmental and social matters, and classified \nenvironmental category B. An initial environmental examination is \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nKazakhstan  has  put  together  a  strategy  or  road  map  to  develop \nthe transport sector over the medium term. This covers all modes \nof transport, including national highways, as well as provincial and \nrural  roads. The  strategy  recognizes  the  need for  new  assets  (to \nincrease  network  coverage)  and  repair  and  upkeep  of  existing \nones (to extend their economic life and improve quality). Some of \nthe  existing  assets  are  in  a  poor  state  of  repair.  A  policy \nframework  backs  the  road  sector  strategy.  It  embodies  basic \noperating  principles  and  best  practice  approaches  with  regard  to \ngood governance and accountability, sustainable financing, policy \nand  regulatory \ninstitutional  reform  and  capacity \ndevelopment,  road  safety,  road  sector  sustainability,  and  road \ntransport  operations.  The  strategy  and  the  policy  framework  will \nbe  operationalized  via  an  investment  program  combining  \u201chard\u201d \nand  \u201csoft\u201d  interventions  over  the  short,  medium,  and  long  term. \nThis  program  requires  financing,  and  the  financing  strategy  rests \non \ninternal  and  external  sources.  ADB  and  several  other \ninternational  financial  institutions  have  been  approached  by  the \nauthorities to team up with the Government and private sector to \nprovide such financing. \n \nThe  Road  Development  Program  (RDP)  covers  2006\u20132012.  At \nthe  start,  the  physical  investment  part  of  the  RDP  will  target \nthe  network.  About \nnational \n7,000 kilometers  (km)  of  these  need  major  reconstruction  and/or \nexpansion. About 18,000 km of the network requires smaller scale \nrehabilitation  works.  About  18,000  km  of  local  roads  also  require \nsignificant rehabilitation and expansion. Work on these roads will \ntake  place  over \nthe  main \ninvestments  will  be  undertaken  once  the  principal  network \n\nthe  program  period,  although \n\nthe  backbone  of \n\nframework, \n\nroads, \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\nInvestment Program \n\ninternational \n\nin  conjunction  with \n\ndeficiencies  are  addressed.  The  nonphysical  part  of  the  RDP \ncovers  institutional  reforms  and  capacity  building  aimed  at  better \nplanning,  operations,  fiduciary  oversight  and  governance,  project \nmanagement,  reporting  and  results  measurement,  outsourcing, \nand private sector involvement.  \n \nThe  physical  and  nonphysical  parts  of  the  Investment  Program \nwere identified on the basis of due diligence work or assessments \nthe  Government, \nconducted  over  recent  years\u2014mostly  by \nalthough  some \nfinancial \ninstitutions.  The  investment  and  advisory  services  components \nincluded  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  sequenced  and \nsplit  into  sections  before  being  \u201cassigned\u201d  to  individual  financiers \nand the private sector.  \n \nADB  will  team  up  with  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IDB)  and \nthe  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  to  handle \nsections  of  the  road  network  in  the  southern  part  of  the  country. \nThese  sections  amounting  to  480  km  is  part  of  the  so-called \nWestern  Europe\u2013Western  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC) \nInternational  Transit  Corridor.  The  overall  investment  for  the \ncorridor is about $6.7 billion, of which the ADB section and that of \nits partners amount to about $1.48 billion. Other financiers behind \nthe overall corridor development plan include the Government, the \nfor \nprivate  sector, \nReconstruction  and  Development.  ADB  has  been  requested  to \nprovide  $700  million  toward  the  Investment  Program  through  a \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF). IDB will provide $414 million \nand JICA $150 million. \n \nThe  road  sector  has  long-standing  operational  and  institutional \nbottlenecks: (i) the network is incomplete, and in some sections in \nbad  condition;  (ii)  truck  overloading  is  frequent,  cutting  into  the \neconomic  life  of  road  assets;  (iii)  revenues  from  transit  are  low, \naffecting \ncapabilities; \nand \n(iv) inefficient  cross-border  procedures  increase  the  burden  on \ntrade and traders, and raise the cost of doing business; (v) weak \nroad  sector  planning  affects  sound  investment  sequencing;  and \n(vi)  project  development  and  project  management  shortcomings \ncreate inefficiencies, high costs, and bad governance. These gaps \ntranslate  into  higher-than-average  transport  costs.  They  also \nhamper  regional  cooperation  and  integration  opportunities,  and \nultimately the country\u2019s competitiveness. The Investment Program \nand  the  proposed  financing  are  intended  to  remove  these \nconstraints. A problem tree analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nThe \nimprovement  and \nexpansion  of  the  Western  Europe\u2013Western  PRC  International \nTransit  Corridor.  This  runs  from  Khorgos  at  the  border  with  the \nPRC,  through  Almaty  and  Shymkent,  to  the  western  border  with \nthe  Russian  Federation.  This  corridor  is  underpinned  by  road \n\nthe  World  Bank,  and  European  Bank \n\nInvestment  Program  caters \n\nreinvestment \n\nrecovery \n\ncost \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\n \n\n       iii   \n\n \n\nto \n\nreform \n\nrelated \n\nlandmark \n\nin  place, \n\nis  already \n\nto  a  state-owned \n\nthe  North\u2013South  Corridor  which  runs \n\ninvestments made in the PRC, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. In \nthis sense, the corridor is an integral part and flagship transaction \nunder the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nprogram.  Further,  the  corridor  paves  the  way  and  justifies  the \ninto \ndevelopment  of \nUzbekistan,  Turkmenistan,  Afghanistan,  and  Pakistan.  Each  of \nthese  corridors  will  be  backed  by  work  at  the  national  level  on \nrural access roads.   \n \nA \nthe \nreorganization  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications \n(MOTC). This involves the separation of key business functions\u2014\nprocurement,  financial  management,  contract  supervision,  and \nquality control. As a result, MOTC is becoming a facilitator rather \nthan  a  \u201cdoer\u201d.  Most  road  works contracts  are  already  outsourced \nto the private sector. The exception is routine maintenance works \nroad  maintenance \nthat  are  outsourced \nenterprise\u2014although  even  here  there  are  moves  to  bring  in  the \nprivate  sector  under  a  variety  of  revenue  and  risk  sharing \narrangements\u2014an  approach  followed  successfully  in  several \nEuropean  Union  countries.  Another  feature  of  the  institutional \nreform  program  already  in  place  is  the  establishment  of  a \nCommittee  of  Roads  under  MOTC;  and  the  introduction  of  a \nwarranty system for construction, operation, and maintenance. In \naddition,  the  procurement  process  has  been  overhauled  and \nprescribed  in  all  bid  documentation  schedules.  MOTC  has  also \nestablished  a  quality  control  section  and  oblast-based  road \nconstruction testing laboratories. These changes will yield positive \nresults  over  the  short  term,  but  more  are  needed.  The  most \nimportant  changes  concern  the  establishment  of  a  road  fund; \nimproved  planning  and  project  management;  refinement  of  the \nlegal  framework  over  time  (e.g.  to  facilitate  build-operate-transfer \nand  concessions,  and  improved  financial  management  systems); \nthe introduction of tougher road safety systems; and staff training.  \n \nThe Investment Program earmarked for the three institutions and \nthe Government is divided into three projects financed under three \nseparate tranches. The first tranche under the ADB financing will \nhave  two  major  components:  (i)  road  development,  and  (ii)  road \noperations and maintenance. \n \nThe  financing  plan  for  the  overall  corridor  development  plan  is \nshown below, indicating that ADB is one of several players.   \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\nSummary Financing Plan of the Corridor \n\nSource \n\nGovernment  \nADB \nEBRD \nIDB  \nJICA \nWorld Bank \nPrivate  \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n909 \n700 \n181 \n414 \n150 \n2,125 \n2,221 \n6,700 \n\nPercentage \n(%) \n15 \n10 \n3 \n6 \n3 \n31 \n32 \n100 \n\nTotal \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  EBRD  =  European  Bank \nfor \nReconstruction and Development, IDB = Islamic Development Bank, JICA = \nJapan International Cooperation Agency. \nSources: Ministry of Transport and Communications and ADB estimates. \n\n \nThe  sections  of  the  corridor  development  plan earmarked  for  the \nInvestment  Program  to  be  financed  by  ADB  and  its  partners  are \nestimated at $1.48 billion.  \n \n\nSummary Financing Plan of the Investment Program  \n\nFinancier and Financing Modality \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n700 \n\nPercentage \n(%) \n47 \n\n28 \n10 \n15 \n100 \n\n414 \n150 \n216 \n1,480 \n\nADB \u2013 multitranche financing \nfacility  \nIDB \u2013 collaborative cofinancing \nJICA \u2013 joint cofinancing \nGovernment \nTotal \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  IDB  =  Islamic  Development  Bank,  JICA  = \nJapan International Cooperation Agency. \nSources: Ministry of Transport and Communications and ADB estimates. \n \nThe  JICA\u2019s \nthe  Accelerated \nCofinancing  Scheme  with  ADB  (ACFA)  signed  in  2007.

This  proposal  is  qualified  on  five \ngrounds. First, the modality provides flexibility to the Government. \nWithin  the  proposed  maximum  financing  commitment  of  $700 \nmillion,  ADB  and  the  Government  can  easily  modify  the  amount \nand  timing  of  ADB  contributions  under  each  tranche.  This  is \nimportant  in  case  the  government  can  raise  additional  financing \nfrom other sources (such as the private sector). The other element \nbehind  this  flexibility  is  that  the  financing  to  be  provided  by  ADB \ncan be closely linked to the availability of resources within ADB (a \nmatter  made  clear  to  the  authorities),  as  well  as  to  compliance \nwith undertakings made under a financing framework agreement.  \n \nSecond,  financing  under  the  MFF  can  be  linked  with  technical, \nsafeguards, \nfilters.  The \nlegal  and  other  project  readiness \nauthorities  can  make  specific  loan  conversions  under  the  broad \nfacility when projects are ready for implementation. This approach \nfacilitates  advance  actions,  including  documentation  preparation \nand  the  establishment  of  relevant  administrative  arrangements. \nThe  MFF  also  allows  ADB,  the  Government,  and  its  partners  to \nlink  more  closely  the  financing  to  changes  in  the  cost  of \nsubprojects  bundled  under  each  tranche.  This  avoids  problems \nassociated  with  cost  overruns.  Third,  the  MFF  modality  allows \nADB to enter into a medium-term partnership with the authorities \nand its cofinancing partners, and in the process create stability but \nalso  credibility  at  the  level  of  the  financing  plan.  The  MFF  also \nmixes the physical investments with advisory services. The latter \nincludes work on capacity and policy actions, which at times could \nbe precursors to making the actual physical investments.  \n \nFourth,  the  individual  contract  packages  are  large  in  size  and \nlimited in number. This invalidates a sector loan approach, as well \nas  stand-alone  project  modalities,  as  alternatives.  Although  in \ntheory any of these modalities could be used, the efficiency gains \nwould not be the same. Fifth, all the conditions precedents for the \nuse  of  an  MFF  are  in  place\u2014there  is  a  strategic  context,  road \n\nMFF Modality  \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFinancing Conditions \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Investment \nProgram Completion \nDate \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\nthe \n\nleading \n\nimpact  of \n\nmap, policy framework, investment program, and financing plan.  \n \nThe  channeling  of  funding  via  an  MFF  provides  ADB,  the \nGovernment, and the cofinanciers with a chance to shift time and \nresources  away  from  repetitive  processing  tasks  during  the \nnetwork development period into implementation support and key \nadvisory  services.  The  modality  moves  the  analytical  work  up \nfront,  leaving  resources  and  multi-entry  points  for  ADB  and  its \npartners to focus on implementation, capacity, and reforms. ADB \nand  its  partners  have  agreed  decision-making  criteria  and  filters \nfor  the  provision  of  finance,  including  specific  warranties  and \nrepresentations  and  covenants \nto  suspension  and \ncancellation of financing.     \n \nThe  expected \nInvestment  Program  will  be \nsustainable  economic  development  as  a  result  of  the  expected \noutcome  of  an  efficient  transport  system  in  Zhambyl  Oblast. \nDesign  and  monitoring  frameworks  have  been  prepared  for  the \noverall corridor development plan and for the Investment Program \nincluding the first tranche. These results are linked to the problem \ntree analysis. The frameworks are in Appendix 1.   \n \nThe  MFF  will  be  split  into  three  tranches.  ADB  financing  will  be \nprovided  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  maximum \namount  of  ADB  financing  under  the  MFF  will  be  $700  million \nequivalent.  The  terms  of  ADB  financing  will  follow  the  provisions \nof  the  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations  applicable  to  London \nto \ninterbank  offered \nloan \nmodifications \nagreements.  \n \nUntil 30 June 2015 \n \n31 December 2014 \n\nrate \nthat  may  be \n\nincluded  under \n\nloans,  subject \n\n(LIBOR)-based \n\nindividual \n\n \nMOTC will be the Executing Agency for the Investment Program. \nThe  Committee  of  Roads  under  MOTC  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency. \n \nMOTC will set up a team and appoint a project director to manage \nthe  Investment  Program.  The  team  will  cover  legal  matters  (e.g. \nbid  document  and  contract  signing,  contract  supervision, \nundertakings  and  loan  covenant  compliance);  engineering  and \ncontract supervision; safeguards oversight; financial management; \nrecord  keeping;  procurement;  disbursements;  and  evaluation, \nmonitoring,  and \nresults \nmeasurement  unit.  The  team  will  include  MOTC  staff  and  will \nrecruit advisers engaged locally and internationally.  \n \n\nIt  will  also  contain  a \n\nreporting. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nImplementation Plan \n\n       vii   \n\n \n\nthe  reports  due \n\nfor  management  and \n\nThe transaction team has prepared a project implementation plan, \nby  linking  each  of  the  main  tasks  under  the  first  tranche  to \nprojected  individual  contracts  for  goods,  works,  and  services. \nThere is also a higher level implementation plan for the MFF as a \nwhole.  The  idea  behind  this  plan  is  to  demonstrate  project \nreadiness, but also to agree project management actions ahead of \nADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  consideration  date  of  the  Report  and \nRecommendations  of  the  President.  This  approach  facilitates  the \nwork of a team made up of ADB and MOTC. The \u201ccool-off\u201d period \nbetween  Board  approval  and  loan  signing  date  will  be  used  to \nestablish the MOTC\u2019s team, agree a final organizational structure, \ndefine the final team skills mix, and seek administrative and legal \napprovals.  \n \nThe  anchor  for  the  implementation  plan  is  a  management \ninformation  system  connecting \nthe  civil  works  contractor \nresponsibilities,  tasks,  and  time  schedules  to  those  of  the \nsupervision  consultants,  the  local  program  management  office \nteam,  and  the  ADB  staff  in  charge  of  program  oversight.  The \ninformation system will record contract awards and disbursement \nprojections  and  anticipated  dates  for  actions  by  the  contractor, \nexecuting agency team, and ADB. It will also provide a summary \nof \nfinanciers.  The \nimplementation plan for the Investment Program is summarized in \nAppendix 9. Supplementary Appendix B contains more details on \nthis plan.  \n \nProcurement  of  goods,  civil  works,  and  related  services  financed \nfrom  the  ADB  and  JICA  loans  will  be  done  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  contract  packages \nwill  be  used  for  civil  works  over  $3  million  and  goods  over  $1 \nmillion.  National  competitive  bidding  for  civil  works  could  be \nconducted  for  contracts  not  exceeding  $3  million.  Civil  works \ncontracts  will  be  procured  through  ICB  among  pre-qualified \nbidders. ADB\u2019s prior review procedures will be followed.  \n \nTranche 1 involves three ICB contract packages for civil works.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  requires  the  assistance  of  consultants. \nThe  assistance  is  split  into  two:  a  core  team  to  be  engaged \nupfront  and  additional  inputs  to  be  brought  into  the  Investment \nProgram  as  and  when  required.  The  first  will  be  financed  under \nthe first tranche and the latter under subsequent tranches.  Under \ntranche  1,  ADB  financing  will  be  used  to  engage  the  services  of \ninternational  and  national  experts.  About  814  person-months  of \nconsultancy services have been budgeted for this purpose. These \ninclude  179  person-months  international  and  635 person-months \nof  national  staff.  The  actual  team  composition  and  skill  mix  may \nvary  during  various  project  implementation  phases.  The  same \napplies  to  the  terms  of  reference  and  profile  of  the  experts.  The \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\n \nBenefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\nthe  management \n\ngeneral principle is that advisers will be secured on a competitive \nbasis and that the specific mandates will be defined and finalized \nby \nInvestment \nteam  responsible \nProgram. ADB will be required to approve the selection process.  \n \nAll  consultants  financed  from  ADB  and  JICA  loans  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the \nprocurement  plans  for  the  projects.  Consulting  firms  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection procedures. Full technical proposals will be required for \nall consulting services.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  benefit  an  array  of  people  and \nbusiness  in  Kazakhstan  and  neighboring  countries.  The  main \nbenefits  revolve  around  better,  safer,  cheaper,  and \nfaster \nconnectivity.  Better  connectivity  can  yield  important  externalities, \nincluding  access  to  health  and  education  centers.  The  program \nwill  have  gender-related  benefits,  particularly  as  urban  centers \nbecome  better  connected  to  isolated  rural  areas,  thus  improving \nmobility  and  job  opportunities  in  the  city.  There  are  also \ninstitutional  and  change  management  gains.  The  beneficiaries \ninclude  trading,  logistics  and  other  service  industry  operators. \nThey  also  include  farmer  communities,  food  and  industrial \nmanufacturers,  wholesalers,  and  retailers.  The  economic  internal \nrate of return for the Investment Program is 18%.   \n \nSound, \nthe \nInvestment  Program  assumes  a  professional  and  competent \nproject  management  function,  an  unaltered  strategy  and  policy \nframework,  and  continued \ninstitutional  changes.  Exogenous \nfactors,  such  as  rising  construction  costs  caused  by  fuel  price \nincreases,  may  also  have  a  bearing  on  the  success  of  the \nprogram, especially with regard to the overall budget and current \nfinancing  plan.  Finally,  and  after  construction,  the  success  of  the \nprogram  will  depend  on  how  well  and  how  frequently  the  assets \nare maintained. The introduction of best practice safety measures \nis also a matter for consideration. \n \nOverall, the chances that implementation will be done on time and \nwithin  budget,  and  meet  international  standards  are  high.  The \nproject  management  team  will  be  staffed  with  skilled  personnel, \nnational  and  international.  An  experienced  professional  with  a \nrecord  in  project  management  will  manage  this  team.  The \nbusiness  processes  and  the  operating  procedures  for  awarding \ncontracts  and \nreasonably  well \nestablished and credible in Kazakhstan. It is also highly likely that \nthe  Committee  of  Roads  will  adhere  to  best  practice  when  it \ncomes to design and construction standards. Project management \nwill be tightened and then monitored through the introduction of a \nhigh  standard  road  construction  management  and  information \n\ntimely,  and  cost-effective \n\nimplementation  of \n\nthen  managing \n\nthem  are \n\n\f \n\n \n\n       ix   \n\n \n\nsystem  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  operating  policies  and \nprocedures,  including  those  related  to  financial  management, \nanticorruption measures, procurement, and safeguards. \n \nThe  Government  has  committed  to  the  strategy  and  policy \nframework.  The  policy  framework  has  all  the  right  principles, \nincluding  outsourcing  to  the  private  sector  and  regular  road \nmaintenance  funding.  The  risk  of  a  policy  reversal  is  low.  The \nsame applies to the roles and functions of key institutions. MOTC \nhas  been  restructured  and  given  more  of  a  regulatory  and \nsupervision  mandate.  It  is  unlikely  that  this  institution  will  be \nreconverted to operate the construction and operation of the entire \nroad  network  on  its  own.  Maintenance  remains  in  public  hands. \nOne  of  the  key  reforms  includes  the  possible  reintroduction  of  a \nroad  maintenance  fund.  This  will  assure  continuity  and  stability \nwith regard to the financing plan after the construction phase.  \n \nThe  Government  is  also  assumed  to  continue  improving  cross-\nborder policies and facilities, and sustaining policies conducive to \neconomic  growth  and  regional  integration.  Training  will  be  given \nunder tranche 1 to take care of capacity building needs.  \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n\f\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1.  \nI submit, for your approval, the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Transport  Corridor  I  (Zhambyl  Oblast  Section)  [Western \nEurope\u2013Western People\u2019s Republic of China International Transit Corridor] Investment Program \n(the Investment Program), and (ii) an administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a \nloan  to  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  for  the  Investment  Program  to  be  provided  by  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA). The design and monitoring framework (DMF) for the \nInvestment Program is in Appendix 1.1  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2.  \nThe  economy  of  Kazakhstan  has  grown  rapidly  because  of  increased  prices  on  its \nleading  exports  such  as  oil,  metals,  and  grain.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  has \nreached  about  10.6%  annually  since  2001.2 This  growth  is  expected  to  continue,  albeit  with \npossible  blips  during  the  short  term  on  account  of  current  external  shocks  and  international \nfinancial  crisis.  In  any  event,  strong  economic  growth  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  road  freight \ntransport (in ton-kilometers) of about 10% per year and a rise in the number of vehicles of about \n5% per year.3 The motorization level of about 100 cars per 1,000 population is relatively high in \nthe region but low by the European standard of above 300 cars per 1,000 inhabitants.4 \n \nKazakhstan\u2019s  vast  territory,  low  density  of  population,  mineral  resources  scattered \n3.  \nacross  the  country,  and  location  between  Europe  and  Asia  make  it  one  of  the  world\u2019s  most \ncargo-intensive systems. This results in high dependency on the transport system.  \n \nRoads are a key element of Kazakhstan\u2019s transport system. They play an important role \n4.  \nin  providing  access  to  rural  areas,  and  facilitating  transit  traffic  and  in-country  transport \nmovement.  However,  much  of  the  road  network  is  in  poor  condition\u2014about  60%  of  the \nrepublican (national) roads require major rehabilitation and proper maintenance. Moreover, the \nfeeder road network serving the rural population is not fully developed; and is characterized by \npoor conditions and a low service level, especially during wintertime. This results in a high cost \nof goods\u2014the transport cost component is about 10% of the cargo value, which is far above the \naverage of about 4% in developed economies (footnote 2).  \n \n5.  \nKazakhstan has three road networks, each under the responsibility of different levels of \ngovernments  and  their  respective  road  organizations:  (i)  the  republican  roads  are  under  the \nresponsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  and  managed  by  the \nCommittee of Roads, (ii) local or rural roads are under oblasts or provincial governments, and \n(iii)  urban  roads  are  under  municipality  or  city  authorities.  There  are  about  23,000 kilometers \n(km)  of  republican  roads,  of  which  only  about  40%  has  an  asphalt-based  surface;  and  about \n                                                 \n1   A  feasibility  study  for  the  Investment  Program  was  prepared  by  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications \n(MOTC).  Small-scale  technical  assistance  was  provided  to  complement  the  feasibility  study  and  prepare  the \nInvestment  Program.  ADB.  2008.

Brussels. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n66,000 km of rural roads, of which 10% is asphalt-based. \n \n6.  \nThe  road  sector  has  long-standing  operational  and  institutional  bottlenecks:  (i)  the \nnetwork is incomplete, and in some sections in bad condition; (ii) truck overloading is frequent, \ncutting  into  the  economic  life  of  road  assets;  (iii)  revenues  from  transit  are  low,  affecting  cost \nrecovery  and  reinvestment  capabilities;  (iv)  inefficient  cross-border  procedures  increase  the \nburden  on  trade  and  traders,  and  raise  the  cost  of  doing  business;  (v)  weak  road  sector \nplanning  affects  sound  investment  sequencing;  and  (vi)  project  development  and  project \nmanagement shortcomings create inefficiencies, high costs, and bad governance. These gaps \ntranslate into higher than average transport costs. They also hamper regional cooperation and \nintegration opportunities, and ultimately the country\u2019s competitiveness. A problem tree analysis \nis presented in Appendix 2 as part of the road sector analysis. \n \n7.  \nThe  Government  has  recognized  the  transport deficiencies  and  is  planning  to  increase \nthe budget for the road sector. In 2008, road funding represented 1% of GDP with projections \naiming to increase it to 2% of GDP. Developed countries without road funds spend on average \nabout  1%  of  GDP  on  their  roads.  As  expected,  countries  with  road  funds  spend  more\u2014an \naverage of about 1.6% of GDP, of which about 0.3% is spent on road maintenance. The current \nroad maintenance budget of about 0.1% of GDP is clearly inadequate. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nRoad Sector Road Map \n\na. \n \n\nStrategic Objectives and Approach \n\n8.  \nKazakhstan  has  developed  a  transport  sector  strategy  (the  Transport  Strategy)  to \nimprove  and  expand  the  network  over  the  short  to  medium  term. 5 The  Transport  Strategy \nincluding a strategy for the road sector outlines several objectives and sets out quantitative and \nqualitative  targets  and  operating  principles.  The  underlying  theme  is  to  make  the  road  system \nlarger, better, more accessible, more affordable, more efficient, safer, and more environmentally \nfriendly.  The  Government  also  wants  to  see  greater  integration  between  different modes,  cost \nrecovery, much more outsourcing to the private sector \u2013 construction, maintenance, operations, \nand management. The Transport Strategy calls for investments in \u201chard\u201d infrastructure, as well \nas  for  institutional  effectiveness  and  change.    This  includes  streamlining  the  mandate  of  the \nMinistry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC);  improving  planning,  governance,  financial \nand  project  management,  safeguards  standards,  and  road  safety  measures.  The  Transport \nStrategy sequences priority investments splitting them into public and private investments and a \nmix  of  both.  These  create  the  conditions  for  investments  (the  level  playing  field  for  public  and \nprivate  actions),  but  also  the  criteria  for  operating  assets  and  monitoring  performance  and \nresults.     \n \n\nb. \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n \nThe Government has also developed a policy framework governing investments over the \n9.  \nmedium  term  (Appendix  3).  A  first  set  of  principles  under  this  framework  includes  institutional \nperformance and accountability, system efficiency, cost recovery, transparency and controls for \nthe  way  financial  resources  are  used  and  managed,  competition  with  regard  to  bidding  for \ncontracts  (of  all  types),  fiduciary  oversight,  and  cost  effectiveness.  A  second  set  of  principles \n                                                 \n5  Decree  of  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan.  2006.  Transport  Sector  Strategy  of  the  Republic  of \n\nKazakhstan up to 2015. Astana. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\n(albeit not lower level) includes outsourcing to the private sector and best practice approaches \nwith regard to safeguards, financial management, project management, safety and institutional \nchange  management.  The  transport  sector  agencies  want  results  and  value  for  their \ninvestments and lower bureaucratic hassles. A third set of principles call for \u201cfacilitator\u201d actions \nsuch as customs efficiency, trade or cargo clearance, asset inventory and regional cooperation. \nA  fourth  set  of  principles  includes  financing  and  accountability  for  the  way  the  resources  are \nused.  A fund raising strategy has been put in place to tap into domestic and international fund \nproviders,  including  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies.  This  funding  will  be  used  mostly  for \ncapital expenditure purposes.  Reintroduction of a road fund to deal with recurrent cost needs \nwill be explored.  The policy framework will be revised from time to time. The principles should \nremain  in  place;  but  their  intensity  or  emphasis  can  change,  depending  on  the  needs  and \ncircumstances. The policy framework underpins the investments \u2013 public and private alike.    \n \n \n \n10.  \nThe  development  of  the  road  system  faces  challenges.   The  due  diligence  process  for \nthe  Investment  Program  identified  several  issues  related  to  (i)  the  road  network  (coverage, \nquality  and  accessibility  periods);  (ii)  the  road  sector  institutions;  and  (iii)  the  level  of  finance \navailable  for  investments.  A  problem  tree  analysis  shows  the  main  issues  by  category.  The \nobject  with  this  work  is  to  separate  the  root  causes  of  the  problem  from  their  symptoms.  This \nproblem  tree  is  linked  to  the  DMF  for  the  Investment  Program.  The  objective  shown  in  the \nproblem tree relates to the impact shown in the DMF; the core problem to the outcome and the \ncauses of the problem to the outputs.  The solution chosen relates to the inputs shown in the \nDMF.   \n \n\nChallenges \n\nc. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nRoad  network  coverage.  The  Republican  road  network  offers  reasonable \ncoverage  compared  with  the  rural  and  urban  roads,  albeit  with  still  important \nmissing links. Substantial investments are needed to make it complete and more \neffective. The rural road network is the most limited of the three.6 This will be part \nof  another  investment  program  at  a  later  stage.  The  first  priority  now  is  to  deal \nwith  the  national  road  network  \u2013  while  repairing  several  provincial  roads  at  the \nsame time.  \n\nQuality  of  existing  assets.  Major  sections  of  the  Republican,  rural  and  urban \nnetworks are in a poor state of repair. MOTC wants to covert 86% of republican \nroads  and  70%  of  local  roads  into  a  \u201cgood  condition\u201d  by  2013,  up  from  62% \n(republican  roads)  and  51%  (rural  roads)  in  2006.  Only  about  40%  of  the \nrepublican roads are asphalt-based.  \n\nAccess.  Parts  of  the  road  network  are  impassable  during  winter  months.  This \nmakes  access  to  rural  areas,  towns  and  neighboring  countries  difficult,  thereby \naffecting trade flows and competitiveness.  \n\nInstitutional/management  gaps.  MOTC  has  already  undergone  reforms \nrecently  and  is  becoming  efficient,  both  in  planning  and  monitoring.  But  more \nreforms  are  needed.    The  oblast  administrations  are  less  capable  and  need \ntechnical back up.  Unless addressed, this gap affects rural and provincial road \nnetwork development.  Institutional gaps are aggravated by lack of experience in \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  2003.  Technical  Assistance  for  Formulation  of  Rural  Road  Development  Plan.  Manila  (TA  4145-KAZ);  and \n\nADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Formulation of State Roads Development Plan. Manila (TA 4462-KAZ). \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n\noutsourcing  works  to  the  private  sector,  project  management  skills  and \nknowledge  on  best  practices  related  to  safeguards,  safety,  maintenance  and \nrepair.   \n\nFinancing.    Road  sector  development  needs  capital  and  recurrent  expenditure \nfinance. Road maintenance accounts for 7% of the road sector budget. But this \nactivity  has  been  under  funded  for  years.    Allocations  from  the  Government  for \nrepairs  and  maintenance  reach  $2000/km  by  the  end  of  2008.  The  financing \nissue  is  being  addressed  in  various  ways:  the  private  sector  will  figure  more \nstrongly  in  the  development  and  maintenance  of  assets;  the  public  sector  will \nintroduce a road fund to give greater continuity to road maintenance; the budget \nwill  make  larger  and  more  predictable  allocations;  and  the  Government  will  tap \ninternational  financiers  to  help  with  the  capital  expenditure  programs.  The  fund \nraising  strategy  focuses  first  and  foremost  on  international  financing  institutions \n(IFIs) and the budget.  Domestic capital markets will also be tapped, especially in \nthe  context  of  the  Republican  roads  structured  around  concessions  and  public-\nprivate partnerships. \n\nStrategy  and  policy  framework.    Until  recently,  the  Transport  Strategy  was \nflawed  and  the  policy  principles  unclear  and  unpredictable.    This  has  changed.  \nBoth  gaps  have  been  taken  care  of,  resulting  in  a  more  coherent  investment \nprogram.   \n\n \n(vii)  Road  safety. While nation-wide data indicates that road conditions improved in \n2007, the number of people killed every year exceeds 2,000, with a further 4,700 \ninjured. A fatality rate of 18 per 100,000 inhabitants was reported in 2004, higher \nthan the regional average. The number of people killed between 2005 and 2007 \nincreased by more than 19%. Road safety has been too downplayed. Speeding \nis  key  contributor,  but  low  quality  construction,  the  lack  of  security  barriers, \nlighting,  and  police  oversight  are  also  to  blame.  The  same  applies  to  vehicle \nroadworthiness  standards  and  supervision.  The  Ministry  of  Internal  Security, \nresponsible for dealing with road accidents, has devised a program to deal with \nthese  problems.  Past  efforts  to  establish  a  Road  Safety  Commission  were \nresisted. This concept is now widely accepted and will be reconsidered.    \n\n \n(viii)  Border  crossing  times.  The  main  transport  routes  in  Kazakhstan  are  into  the \nRussian  Federation,  Europe,  and  Central  Asia.  A  total  of  24,000  commercial \ntransit  vehicles,  including  large  buses  and  medium  to  large  trucks,  cross \nKazakhstan every day in 2007. A total of about 350,000 tons of transit traffic pass \nthrough  this  route.  Business  volumes  are  growing  fast.  This  puts  increasing \nthe  road  network.  Without  appropriate  and  corresponding \npressure  on \ninvestments at customs points, cross-border time delays and costs are become a \nburden  on  business.  Operators  already  complain  of  unreasonable  delays, \ncomplicated  procedures,  too  many  frontier  inspections,  contradictions  between \ndomestic  transport  legislation  and  international  standards,  and  the  lack  of \ninternational  standards  and  agreements  relating  to  transit  and  traffic  regulation. \nAlthough  there  have  been  improvements  in  all  these  areas  in  recent  times, \nborder crossing continues to be a problem to trade. \n\nRoad operations. Road operations and traffic management requires reliable and \naccurate  data  on  all  aspects  of  the  network.  Kazakhstan  has  problems  on  this \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\nfront.    Advance  early  warning  information  systems  do  not  exist.  But  these  are \nnecessary to handle axle load monitoring and controls.  There is also a need for \nroad  weather  information,  highways  advisory  radio  and  electronic  signs,  and \ntraffic recordings. This information is also useful for maintenance managers. This \nincludes  making  the  right  winter  road  maintenance  decisions  -  to  ensure  that \nroad restrictions are minimized and costs are kept low. \n\nRoad  data  and  planning. Road and traffic data are unreliable, out of date and \nincomplete.  But  planning  also  needs  tightening.  The  7-year  development  plans \nare  based  on  norms  rather  than  analytical  information  regarding  system \nshortcomings.  The  existing  road  inspections  and  traffic  surveys  needs  to  be \nmodified and improved. Traffic surveys should include accidents data. \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n\n   \n\nd. \n\nRoad Development Program \n\n11.   MOTC  has  defined  a  road  development  program  for  the  medium  term  \u2013  Road \nDevelopment  Program  for  2006\u20132012  (RDP). 7  This  calls  for  physical  and  nonphysical \ninvestments  and  addresses  the  core  problems  highlighted above.  The  RDP  splits  investments \namong the three types of networks, and then further among the short, medium and longer term. \nCash outlays are also divided into capital expenditures - for the development of new assets and \nthe  rehabilitation  of  existing  ones  (mostly  civil  works)  -  and  recurrent  expenditures  needed  for \nmaintenance,  repairs  and  institutional  support.  The  RDP  focuses  almost  exclusively  on  the \nRepublican roads network, the backbone of the transport system in Kazakhstan.  \n \n12.   Physical  Investment.    The  capital  expenditure  budget  for  this  has  gone  up  steadily \n(20%  annually)  in  the  last  five  years.  The  physical  investments  focus  on  the  construction  and \nreconstruction of 7,205 km of Republican roads. It also caters for major and minor repairs in at \nleast 18,460 km of such roads. The RDP also covers the construction, reconstruction and repair \nof 18,089 km of local roads. Urban roads are not included in this investment program. Within the \nRepublican road network the first priority is the Western Europe\u2013Western People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  (PRC)  International  Transit  Corridor.    This  extends  from  Khorgos  at  the  border  with  the \nPRC,  through  Almaty  and  Shymkent,  into  to  the  western  border  with  the  Russian  Federation. \nThis  Corridor  is  one  of  six  included  in  the  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy8 \nendorsed by CAREC member countries in 2007. \n \n13.   Nonphysical Investment. The RDP also covers nonphysical investments. Expenditures \nwill  be  directed  at  institutional  change,  including  staff  training,  better  internal  systems  and \nprocedures,  improved  organizational  structures,  the  development  of  safety  standards  and \ncontrol  measures \nfor  maintenance,  efficient  project  management \n(documentation, bidding, supervision, monitoring and reporting), due diligence capability for the \npreparation of new projects, safeguards monitoring, improved road maintenance system, results \nmeasurement, and planning. Institutional reforms started in early 2008 with the reorganization of \nMOTC.9 This  included  separating  a  number  of  key  functions,  namely  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, contract supervision and quality control. The Committee of Roads, with its Oblast-\nbased  Road  Administrations  under  MOTC,  will  be  responsible  for  the  Investment  Program. \nMOTC has  established a Quality Control Section and 14 oblast-based laboratories.

As  a  result,  about  more  than  a  hundred \ncontracts  were  already  issued  in  2008.  But  further  assistance  and  training  is  required  in  this \narea  to  ensure  full  transparency,  competition  and  efficiency.  The  Investment  Program  will \nincrease work loads and complexity. Management training and the introduction of management \ninformation  systems  will  be  needed  to  cope  with  this  extra  burden  and  cut  costs.  This  is \nessential  to  give  agencies  the  right  levels  of  finance  on  time.    The  promotion  of  more  private \nsector participation in selected road sections is another area that requires technical support and \nadvice.  This  needs  to  be  backed  with  better  legal  frameworks  and  contract  models  for  build-\noperate-transfers  and  concessions.  An  improvement  of  transport  operations,  through  the \napplication of modern information technology, is another investment area. Better technology and \nsystems are also necessary to ensure cheaper, faster and seamless cross border movements. \nThe improvement of road safety and the tightening of road regulations will figure in the capacity \nbuilding agenda.     \n \n\n \n\ne. \n\nExternal Assistance and Lessons \n\n14.   ADB is a lead agency in the transport, energy, customs, and trade facilitation areas. This \nleadership is exercised mainly within CAREC \u2013 a program for which ADB acts as the facilitator. \nKazakhstan is an active member of CAREC. On the transport arena, CAREC has moved from \nthe definition of a strategy into the execution with investments and knowledge products in key \nareas.  The  Investment  Program  represents  a  flagship  operation  within  this  action  plan.  The \nInvestment  Program  has  huge  repercussions  for  connectivity  across  the  entire  Central  Asian \nregion. It unleashes other corridors over time, especially in the North-South direction. \n \nInternational Financial Institutions (IFIs) have been active in the road sector in the region \n15.  \nand Kazakhstan for some time (Appendix 4). Transport is a strategic priority under ADB, EBRD, \nthe  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IDB),  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)10 and \nWorld Bank.  EBRD financed the rehabilitation of national highways along Almaty\u2013Bishkek and \nAktau\u2013Atyrau.  IDB  financed  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Almaty\u2013Astana  road  in  collaboration  with \nADB. JBIC funded the rehabilitation of several highway segments in western Kazakhstan. The \nWorld Bank financed the rehabilitation of the Almaty\u2013Astana highway.  \n \n16.   ADB\u2019s operations include the rehabilitation of the Gulshad\u2013Akchetau road completed in \n2002  and  Almaty\u2013Bishkek  road  completed  in  2006.  Parts  of  the  first  project  were  rated \nsuccessful.11 The  second  project  was  rated  satisfactory.12 Generally,  the  physical  components \nwere done reasonably well.  The executing agency was exposed to new technology and road \nmaterials,  international  competitive  bidding,  and  working  with  international  contractors  and \nconsultants. The shortcomings on the institutional components front were due to less attention \ngiven  to  them.  Further,  certain  covenants,  such  as  the  submission  of  project  accounts  and \naudits,  were  done  poorly  and/or  too  late.  The  executing  agency  needs  to  be  strengthened \nespecially in relation to procurement. The Government has since pushed through with reforms. \nThe institution and the teams have changed; with most of these shortcomings fast becoming a \nthing of the past. The recent restructuring of MOTC is certainly a step in the right direction. This \nprovides  an  opening  for  working  in  partnership,  and  a  higher  degree  of  confidence  over \ninstitutional  effectiveness.  However,  these  changes  remain  work  in  progress.  The  reform  plan \n\n                                                 \n10   Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  was  integrated  with  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \n\n11   ADB.  2006.

An ADB involvement through a partnership program (as opposed to a stand-\nalone project where the leverage is low) will most likely increase the probability of success, and \ngive more entry points to monitor and have a dialogue.   \n \n\n2. \n\nPreconditions for a Multitranche Financing Facility Modality \n\n17.  \nThe  MFF  is  proposed  as  the  modality  to  extend  ADB  financing  to  the  Investment \nProgram. This proposal is qualified on five grounds. First, the modality provides flexibility to the \nGovernment.  ADB  and  the  Government  can  easily  modify  the  amount  and  timing  of  ADB \ncontributions under each tranche. This is important in case the Government can raise additional \nfinancing from other sources (such as the private sector), or if the Government needs more time \nto  finalize  their  own  financing  packages  (documentation,  etc.).  The  other  element  behind  this \nflexibility is that the financing to be provided by ADB can be closely linked to the availability of \nresources within ADB (a matter made clear to the Government), as well as to compliance with \nwarranties and representations made under a framework financing agreement (FFA). \n \n18.   Second, financing under the MFF can be linked to technical, safeguards, legal, and other \nproject  readiness  filters.  The  authorities  can  make  specific  loan  conversions  under  the  broad \nfacility  when  projects  are  ready  for  execution.  This  approach  facilitates  advance  actions, \nincluding  documentation  preparation  and \nthe  establishment  of  relevant  administrative \narrangements. The MFF also allows ADB, the Government, and its partners to link the financing \nmore  closely  to  changes  in  the  cost  of  projects  bundled  under  each  tranche.  This  avoids \nproblems  associated  with  cost  overruns.  Third,  the  MFF  modality  allows  ADB  to  enter  into  a \nmedium-term partnership with the Government and its cofinancing partners, and in the process \ncreate  stability  but  also  credibility  at  the  level  of  the  financing  plan.  The  MFF  also  mixes  the \nphysical  investments  with  advisory  services.  The  latter  includes  financing  to  advance  work  on \ncapacity  and  policy  actions,  which  at  times  could  be  precursors  to  making  the  actual  physical \ninvestments. \n \n19.  \nFourth,  the  individual  contract  packages  are  large  in  size  and  limited  in  number.  This \ninvalidates  a  sector  loan  approach,  as  well  as  stand-alone  project  modalities,  as  alternatives. \nAlthough in theory any of these modalities could be used, the efficiency gains would not be the \nsame.  Fifth,  all  the  conditions  precedents  for  the  use  of  an  MFF  are  in  place\u2014there  is  a \nstrategic  context,  road  map,  policy  framework,  investment  program,  and  financing  plan.  The \nchanneling  of  funding  via  an  MFF  provides  ADB,  the  Government,  and  cofinanciers  with  a \nchance  to  shift  time  and  resources  away  from  repetitive  processing  tasks  during  the  network \ndevelopment  period  into  implementation  support  and  key  advisory  services.  The  modality \nmoves  the  analytical  work  up  front,  leaving  resources  and  multi-entry  points  for  ADB  and  its \npartners  to  focus  on  execution,  capacity,  and  reforms.  ADB  and  its  partners  have  agreed \ndecision-making criteria and filters for the provision of finance, including specific warranties and \nrepresentations and covenants leading to suspension and cancellation of financing. \n \n \n\nStrategic Context and Strategy \n\na. \n\n \n\nThe  Government  wants  to  develop  the  transport  system  as  a  whole  and  has  a  clear \n20.  \nstrategy for one of its components\u2014the road sector. The aim is remove existing bottlenecks in \nthe  way  of  better  connectivity,  competition  and  trade.  As  is  the  case  elsewhere  in  the  region, \nthese obstacles are physical, institutional, and policy in nature. The magnitude of the problem \nwas  worked  out  through  various  specialized  studies.  These  gave  way  to  the  preparation  of  a \nstrategy  with  quantitative  and  qualitative  targets.  The  quantitative  target  is  to  develop  14 \nstrategic  road  corridors,  6  of  which  are  international  roads.  The  qualitative  targets  are \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ninstitutional  improvements,  policy  refinements,  best  practice  on  construction  and  maintenance \nand efficient financing.  The strategy calls for a mix of interventions over the short, medium and \nlong  term,  further  split  between  different  types  of  networks  \u2013  republican,  provincial,  and  rural.  \nThe republican network is the first priority:   \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nUzbekistan Border\u2013Shymkent\u2013Taraz\u2013Almaty\u2013Khorgos\u2013PRC Border,  \nShymkent\u2013Kyzylorda\u2013Aktobe\u2013Uralsk\u2013Samara,  \nAlmaty\u2013Karaganda\u2013Astana\u2013Petropavlovsk\u2013Russian Border,  \nRussian Border\u2013Astrakhan\u2013Atyrau\u2013Aktau\u2013Turkmenistan Border, \nOmsk\u2013Pavlodar\u2013Semipalatinsk\u2013Mykapchagai\u2013PRC Border, and \nAstana\u2013Kostanai\u2013Russian Border. \n\n \nThe  Transport  Strategy  recognizes  the  difference  between  the  creation  of  new  assets \n21.  \nand reconstruction, rehabilitation, and repair of old ones. Investments will be both public sector \nand  public/private  in  nature.  The  road  concession  law  was  amended  in  2008  to  better  attract \nprivate investments. The road sector financing mostly relies on three main sources of funds: the \nnational  budget,  the  private  sector  (national  and  international),  and  international  financing \ninstitutions  such  as  ADB.  A  road  fund  was  in  place  several  years  ago  to  deal  with  recurrent \nfinancing,  but  was  abolished.  The  roadmap  or  strategy  for  the  sector  fits  well  with  ADB\u2019s  own \ncore  business  areas.  Transport  is  one  of  the  main  activities  under  the  Long  Term  Strategic \nFramework.  Within  the  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia  Department,  transport  and  logistics  are \npriorities \nis  articulated  and \noperationalized  via  financing  and  advice  for  projects  with  national  and  regional  content. \nRegional activities fall within the mandate of CAREC. CAREC stands for connectivity, improved \ncompetitiveness,  cooperation  and  integration,  mainly  via  investments  in  transport,  energy  and \ntrade  facilitation  and  targeted  advice  on  these  sectors,  regional  public  goods  and  special \nthemes such as capacity building and the environment.   \n \n \n\nincluding  Kazakhstan.  This  strategy \n\nfor  most  countries, \n\nPolicy Framework \n\nb. \n\n \n\n22.   MOTC  formulated  a  policy  framework  to  achieve  strategic  objectives  outlined  above.  It \naddresses basic principles such as cost recovery, good governance and accountability, private \nsector involvement, sustainable financing, institutional effectiveness, competition and efficiency \nwith respect to contracts, road safety, best practice policies and procedures on safeguards and \nfiduciary oversight, and regular maintenance and repair.  The framework also points to diversity \nin terms of transaction structures and care and attention to thematic matters such as capacity \nand health matters.   \n \n \n\nInvestment Plan \n\nc. \n\n \n\nThe total length of the corridor is about 2,715 km, of which 2,237 km will be constructed \n23.  \nand/or  reconstructed.  The  total  investment  is  estimated  at  about  $6.7  billion.  ADB  and  its \ncofinancing partners, which may include JICA and IDB, are expected to finance 480 km of the \ncorridor;  EBRD  102  km;  the  World  Bank  1,062 km;  and  the  private  sector  504  km.  The \nGovernment has already completed 478 km and is constructing 89 km. The Government plans \nto  complete  the  corridor  by  the  end  of  2012.  The  corridor  investment  will  be  a  mix  of  public \nsector  investment  and  public\u2013private  partnership.  The  IFIs  will  finance  about  53%,  the  private \nsector  is  expected  to  finance  32%,  and  the  Government  contribution  will  be  about  15%.  The \nproposed  ADB  financing  for  developing  the  corridor  will  contribute  to  enhancing  the  transport \nnetwork  within  the  region,  and  facilitating  transit  traffic  and  hence  strengthening  regional \ncooperation. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n9\n\nThe  overall  estimated  investment  needs  for  the  Western  Europe\u2013Western  PRC \n\n24.  \nInternational Transit Corridor development are summarized in Table 1.  \n \n\nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan of the Corridor  \n\nAmount     \n($ million) \n\nPercentage \n(%) \n15 \n\n \n\nFinancier \n\nGovernment \nInternational financing institutions \n  Asian Development Bank  \n  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n \n \n  World Bank \nPrivate sector \nTotal \n\nIslamic Development Bank \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \n\n909 \n\n \n\n700 \n181 \n414 \n150 \n2,125 \n2,221 \n6,700 \n\n10 \n3 \n6 \n3 \n31 \n32 \n100 \n\nSources: Ministry of Transport and Communications and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n25.  \n \n\n \n\nd. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe summary financing plan for the Investment Program is in Table 2. \n\nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan of the Investment Program  \n\nFinancier and Financing Modality  \n\nADB \u2013 multitranche financing facility  \nIDB \u2013 collaborative cofinancing  \nJICA \u2013 joint cofinancing \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n700 \n414 \n150 \n216 \n1,480 \n\nPercentage \n(%) \n47 \n28 \n10 \n15 \n100 \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, IDB = Islamic Development Bank, JICA = Japan International Cooperation \nAgency. \nSources: Ministry of Transport and Communications and ADB estimates. \n \n\n \n\n \n\ne. \n\nRationale \n\n26.  \n The DMF splits the results into outputs, outcome, and impact. These are related to the \nproblem  tree  analysis,  which  highlights  the  objective  of  the  Investment  Program  (impact),  the \nnature  of  the  core  problem  (outcome),  and  the  causes  of  the  problem  (outputs).  The  core \nproblem  can  be  described  as  follows.  The  road  network  (national,  rural,  and  urban)  is \nincomplete and in bad shape. Some parts of the network are impassable during some times of \nthe year (continuity of service). Such situation needs redressing to ensure that the country and \nthe  region  has  a  transport  system  that  increases  connectivity  (within  the  country  and  with  the \noutside  world),  competitiveness  (lower  transport  costs),  efficiency  (shorter  travel  time),  safety \n(lower fatalities), and trade and regional cooperation.  \n \n27.  \nIn  terms  of  non-physical  issues,  the  institutional  effectiveness  is  low,  the  planning \ncapability  limited,  the  organizational  structure  complex,  and  the  project  management  skills \ndeficient.    MOTC  has  also  been  short  of  funds.  These  issues  are  aggravated  by  poor \nmanagement  and  information  systems  and  weak  policies  and  procedures  related  to  themes \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nsuch  as  safeguards  and  financial  management.  The  objective  of  the  Investment  Program \ntherefore  is  to  address  these  problems.    As  a  result,  global  and  specific  benefits  accruing  to \ncommunities in the country and the region are expected.    \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  expected  impact  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be  sustainable  economic \n28.  \ndevelopment  as  a  result  of  the  expected  outcome  of  an  efficient  transport  system  in  Zhambyl \nOblast.  \n \nB. \n\nOutput \n\n1. \n\nOutput of the Investment Program \n\nThe output of the Investment Program will be (i) about 480 km of constructed highway \n29.  \nsections in Zhambyl Oblast, and (ii) an improved road operations and maintenance system. The \nhighway  is  the  main  route  between  western  PRC,  Central  Asian  countries,  and  the  Russian \nFederation. The Investment Program will help the Government accelerate the completion of the \nentire  corridor.  The  Investment  Program  is  split  into  projects,  and  comprises  reconstruction  of \nthe existing roads and construction of new roads.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOutput of Project 1 \n\n30.   Project 1 refers to the scope included in the first tranche of the MFF. Project 1 will have \ntwo major components: (i) a road development component, targeting construction of 125 km of \nhighway sections  between Taraz and Korday in Zhambyl Oblast; and (ii) a road operation and \nmaintenance component. \n \n31.   Physical  \u2013  Road  Development  Component. This will comprise civil works (roads and \nbridges) on the following sections:  \n \n\nRoad  section  between  km  404  and  km  483.  Civil  works  in  this  section  will \nneither  involve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  nor  create  significant \nenvironmental impacts. This reconstruction is to meet 4-lane international design \nstandard  within  the  existing  right-of-way  (ROW).  Due  diligence  has  been \nconducted on the road design, technical specification, and cost estimates. \n\nRoad section between km 214 and km 260. Civil works in this section will not \ninvolve LAR nor create significant environmental impacts. This reconstruction is \nto meet 2-lane international design within the existing ROW.  \n\n \n32.   Nonphysical \u2013 Road Operations and Maintenance Component. This component will \nprimarily  assist  MOTC  in  improving  the  efficiency  of  road  operation  and  maintenance  in \nKazakhstan. Two subcomponents are envisaged: \n \n\n(i) \n\nDevelopment of intelligent transport system (ITS). Application of an ITS aims \nto  improve  road  safety,  and  reduce  travel  time  and  delay  using  its  three  major \nfunctions:  (a)  surveillance,  (b)  control  of  highway  operations,  and  (c)  display  of \ninformation  to  the  motorist.  This  subcomponent  will  consist  of  two  main  tasks: \n(a) development of a strategic plan for the deployment of ITS technologies for the \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n(ii) \n\nin \n\nfuture \n\nthe  country, \n\nroad  network \n\nfollowing  a  phased \nexisting  and \nimplementation  approach  and \nin  consultation  with  all  stakeholders;  and \n(b) preparation  of  an  implementation  plan,  equipment  specifications,  layout \ndesign, and schedule for the entire corridor. Given the length of the winters and \nthe expectation of heavy commercial traffic, specific consideration will be given to \naxle  load  monitoring  and  control  facilities,  road  weather  information  systems, \nhighway advisory radio and electronic signs, and traffic recording equipment. \n\nImprovement of road maintenance system. This subcomponent will review the \nroad maintenance system in Kazakhstan. An advisory service will be provided to \nreview  the  existing  conditions  of  the  road  network,  available  road  maintenance \nresources, road maintenance implementation constraints, and current practices. \nLessons from previously undertaken studies, programs, and practices in various \ncountries  will  be  studied  for  possible  implementation  in  Kazakhstan\u2014subject  to \nbudget,  contracting  industry,  and  technical  environment.  Future  maintenance \nrequirements  will  be  developed \nroad \nmaintenance  plan,  performance  standards,  and  technical  specifications.  This \nsubcomponent  will  also  review  Kazakhavtodor\u2019s  strategy  and  plan,  and  funding \nallocations versus requirements; and provide recommendations for strengthening \nits  technical  and  operational  capacity;  or  may  suggest  alternative  arrangements \nfor  the  consideration  of  MOTC.  Road  fund  and  possible  private  sector \ninvolvement in the operation of the Investment Program road will be assessed for \npossible implementation. \n\nincluding  a  performance-based \n\n \n\n3. \n\nOutput of Subsequent Projects \n\n33.  \nThe  output  of  the  subsequent  projects  will  be  about  355  km  of  reconstructed  roads \n(Appendix 5, Table A6). Civil works under the subsequent projects will involve land acquisition \nand  involuntary  resettlement,  and  create  significant  environmental  impacts  caused  by  road \nwidening  and  construction  of  new  bypasses.  MOTC  will  prepare  LAR  plans  (LARPs)  and \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs).  A  LAR  framework  (LARF)  and  an  environment \nassessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  have  been  prepared  and  endorsed  by  MOTC  to \nprovide  guidance  for  preparing  safeguard  documents  for  the  subsequent  projects.  The  EARF \nand LARF have also been disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.  \n \n34.  \nThe  subsequent  projects  will  continue  strengthening  road  operation  and  maintenance, \nincluding possible procurement of road maintenance facilities and physical investment in an ITS. \nThe details will be finalized during the implementation of Project 1. \n \nC. \n \n35.  \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Investment  Program  is  estimated  at  $1.48  billion  equivalent \nincluding taxes and duties, and physical and price contingencies. The total cost of Project 1\u2014\nincluding  taxes,  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies\u2014is  estimated  at  $400  million \nequivalent.

ADB  will  provide  loans  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  (OCR)  up  to  the  amount  of  $700  million  equivalent;  provided  that  related  periodic \nfinancing requests (PFRs) are submitted by the Government and related loan agreements are \nexecuted,  and  the  Government  complies  with  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  FFA  to  be  entered \ninto  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  FFA  has  been  negotiated  and  its  signing  by  the \nGovernment  is  being  delayed  due  to  the  need  on  the  part  of  the  Government  to  conduct \ninteragency review of the negotiated FFA and loan agreements with other IFIs with regard to the \nentire Corridor financing prior to their signing in accordance with the procedures prescribed by \nthe legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere its own independent decision, and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB.  \n \n39.  \nIn  accordance  with  the  FFA,  the  Government  will  submit  the  first  PFR  to  ADB, \nrequesting a loan of $340 million to help finance Project 1. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions to be set forth in the related draft loan agreement. The Government will finance \nthe balance of the cost of Project 1 in an amount of $60 million, including local taxes and duties.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCofinancing \n\n40.  \nThe  Investment  Program  will  comprise  three  projects,  of  which  the  second  and  third \nprojects  are  expected  to  be  cofinanced  by  JICA  and  IDB.    Cofinancing  from  JICA  is  being \nmobilized for the second project in the form of a loan in the amount of $150 million pursuant to \nthe Accelerated Cofinancing Scheme with ADB (ACFA) signed between ADB and JICA in 2007. \nSuch cofinancing will be on a joint basis and will be administered by ADB.  In the case of IDB, \nthe  proposed  financing  is  expected  to  be  provided  on  a  parallel  basis  in  accordance  with  the \nFramework Cofinancing Agreement signed between ADB and IDB in September 2008.  IDB is \nmobilizing  the  amount  of  $414  million  to  be  provided  in  the  form  of  loans  for  the  second  and \nthird  projects  under  the  Investment  Program.    Formal  confirmations  have  been  received  from \nJICA and IDB that approval of their respective loans are expected in mid 2009 and mid 201013. \nThe  projects  cofinanced  by  JICA  and  IDB  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsafeguard policies and guidelines. \n  \n41.   ADB  will  endeavor  to  mobilize  additional  cofinancing  for  the  Investment  Program.  If \nsuccessful, such additional cofinancing may be converted into cofinancing administered by ADB \nas permitted by the MFF policy14 and reported to the Board for information.    \n \n\n3. \n\nFilters for Financing Tranches \n\n42.  \nFinancing tranches may be made available by ADB, provided matters continue to be in \naccordance with the general understandings and expectations on which the MFF is based and \nwhich  are  laid  out  in  the  FFA.  Progress  toward  achievement  of  the  outputs  and  the  expected \noutcome set out in the design and monitoring frameworks for the overall corridor development \nplan, the Investment Program, and Project 1 will be decision-making criteria for continuing the \nMFF.  Furthermore,  compliance  with  the  implementation  framework,  safeguards  requirements \nand  social  development  policies,  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  FFA  will  also  determine \nADB\u2019s decision to continue financing tranches. \n \n\n                                                 \n13  A memorandum of understanding on financing of the Investment Program was signed by the Ministry of Transport \nIslamic \n\nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  and \n\nand  Communications,  Asian  Development  Bank,  Japan \nDevelopment Bank on 10 October 2008. \n\n14 ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila (approved in July 2008). \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nManagement  \n\n43.   MOTC will be the Executing Agency (EA) and the Committee of Roads under MOTC will \nbe  the  Implementing  Agency.  MOTC  will  be  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the \nInvestment  Program  and  liaising  with  IFIs  involved  in  the  sector  (Appendix  7).  MOTC\u2019s \norganizational  structure  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A.  MOTC  will  establish  a  team  to \nmanage  the  Investment  Program  headed  by  a  project  director.  The  proposed  organization \nstructure for the Investment Program is in Appendix 7.  \n \n44.   MOTC  will  appoint  the  project  director  who  shall  have  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementation  of  the  Investment  Program  including  project  preparation,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring and reporting. The project director will be a qualified staff member of the Committee \nof Roads, with experience in project management  acceptable to ADB. MOTC  will ensure that, \nduring  the  entire  period  of  project  implementation,  the  project  director  will  be  adequately \nassisted by a team of MOTC staff responsible for engineering, finance, legal, and procurement \nmatters;  and  project  management  consultant  (PMCs)  and  construction  supervision  consultant \nteams.  \n \n45.   A PMC to be established under the Investment Program (PMC-ADB) will be recruited by \nMOTC. PMC-ADB will be part of the PMC funded under the proposed World Bank\u2019s South West \nCorridor  Development  Program  loan  (PMC-WB).  The  PMC-WB  will  coordinate  all  activities \nfunded  by  IFIs  involved  in  the  corridor  investment;  and  provide  support  for  safeguard \ncompliance,  legal,  and  financial  management.  Given  the  critical  role  of  PMC-WB  in  the \nimplementation of the Investment Program, the ADB loan will have a condition stating that if the \nWorld  Bank  loan  becomes  liable  for  suspension,  the  ADB  loan  will  also  be  suspended.  The \nPMC-ADB will help the project director in implementing the Investment Program. Administrative \nand  secretarial  staff,  office  equipment,  and  facilities  will  be  provided  under  the  PMC-ADB\u2019s \ncontract.  The  PMC-ADB  will  introduce  a  suitable  management  information  system  to  manage \nthe Investment Program. \n \n46.  \nto execute the Investment Program: \n \n\nThe PMC-ADB will conduct the followings tasks to help the project director and its team \n\nProject management and procurement. The PMC-ADB team will assist MOTC in \nbid  document  preparation,  pre-qualification  criteria,  prequalification  process, \nbidding,  selection,  and  award.  The  procurement  documentation  will  be  checked \nby this team before submission to ADB and the executing agency. The team will \nlook after all contractual arrangements, including any revisions requested by the \ncontractors. The objective is to ensure quality and strict adherence to ADB rules \nand  procedures.  The  team  will  provide  assurance  certifications  on  behalf  of  the \nGovernment relating to loan covenants and MFF undertakings. \n\nFinance and administration.  A financial management expert will run this function. \nThis  activity  will  be  split  into  financial  matters  (principally  funding  requests, \naccounts and money management, payments), controls and internal and external \nauditing  (records,  audits  and  governance  oversight)  and  administrative  work \ntechnology  system \n(record  keeping,  salaries,  utilities,  and \nmaintenance).   \n\ninformation \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n15\n\nEvaluation,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  There  is  also  a  need  to  report  the \nimplementation  progress  of  the  Investment  Program  to  the  authorities  and  the \nfinanciers.  This task will be matched by the measurement of results.  Under the \nCAREC  Institute  work,  ADB  will  be  commissioning  specialized  evaluation  and \nimpact  studies  on  CAREC  related  activities  including  the  Investment  Program. \nThis activity is a new feature under the CAREC.  In the meantime, the team will \ndevelop  a  Project  Performance  Monitoring  System  (PPMS)  based  on  the  DMF \nagreed  with  ADB  and  its  partners  and  in  the  short  term  at  least  deliver \ninformation on basic outputs (physical and nonphysical). \n\nDue-diligence for subsequent projects. The preparation of new projects requires \ndue  diligence  work  covering  all  standard  areas  linked  to  project  finance  and \nsocial, \nstand-alone  projects\u2014technical, \nsafeguards,  governance,  fiduciary  oversight,  management,  and  institutional \nmatters.  This  package  is  equivalent  to  a  standard  project  preparation  technical \nassistance from ADB, only that it will be financed under the first tranche loan.     \n\nlegal,  economic, \n\ncommercial, \n\nThe  construction  supervision  consultants  will  assist  the  project  director  and  its  team  to \n\n \n47.  \nimplement the Investment Program: \n \n\nProject  implementation.  The  main  task  will  be  to  manage  the  award  and \nexecution  of  civil  works  contracts  (from  a  technical  standpoint)  and  supervise \nschedules,  quality  of  materials  and  construction,  and  cost.  All  works \ncommissioning (acceptance) will require a certificate from the supervision team.  \nPayments  and  payment  schedules  from  finance  and  administration  (including \nrequests for ADB and its partners to pay) will need to pass this filter before being \nexecuted. This structure and its mandate will remain in place throughout the MFF \nperiod.  \n\nSafeguard  compliance.  Safeguards  are  an  important  part  of  the  program \nmanagement  task.    Although  most  sections  of  the  roads  involve  rehabilitation, \nsome  are  new.  Irrespective  of  which  type  of  work  is  undertaken,  the  project \ndirector will need to ensure that all ADB policies and procedures on safeguards \nare followed throughout the implementation period.  The overall program benefits \nfrom a global safeguards framework. The first tranche has been subjected to due \ndiligence  and  is  backed  by  plans  that  need  monitoring.  A  specialized  team  will \naid  implementation  work  and  ensure  the  highest  standards  with  respect  to \nsafeguards work.  The  team  will  closely  work  with  a  safeguard  team  that  will  be \nrecruited under the World Bank-funded project and oversee the overall safeguard \ncompliance. \n\n \n48.   With the assistance of the PMC-ADB, the project director will prepare quarterly progress \nreports and will submit them to ADB within 2 weeks from the end of the related quarter. It will \nalso  submit  other  required  performance  and  monitoring  reports  twice  a  year.  Overall  progress \nand compliance with conditions of the loan agreement will be monitored regularly and reviewed \nby  ADB,  consistent  with  existing  project  implementation  requirements.  Reports  will  include \nevaluation of issues and will recommend remedial actions.  \n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Plan and Project Readiness \n\n49.  \nImplementation Period. The Investment Program is scheduled for 6 years, inclusive of \nprocurement  and  construction  activities,  and  is  expected  for  completion  at  the  latest  by \n31 December  2014  (Appendix  8).  The  physical  implementation  of  Project  1  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by 30 June 2012. The implementation schedule for the subsequent projects will be \nprepared  during  implementation  of  Project  1.  The  second PFR  is  expected  to  be  submitted  to \nADB Management by June 2009. \n \n50.  \nImplementation Plan. The transaction team has prepared a project implementation plan \nby  linking  each  of  the  main  tasks  under  the  first  tranche  to  projected  individual  contracts  for \ngoods, works, and services. There is also a higher level implementation plan for the MFF as a \nwhole. The idea behind this plan is to demonstrate project readiness, but also to agree project \nmanagement  actions  ahead  of  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  consideration  date  of  the  proposed \nMFF. This approach facilitates the work of the ADB and client implementation team. The \u201ccool-\noff\u201d period between Board approval and signing dates will be used to establish the Investment \nProgram team, agree a final organizational structure, define the final team skills mix, and seek \nadministrative and legal approvals. \n \n51.  \nThe anchor for the implementation plan is a management information system connecting \nthe civil works contractor responsibilities, tasks, and time schedules to those of the supervision \nconsultants, the local program management office team, and the ADB staff in charge of program \noversight. The information system will record contract awards and disbursement projections and \nanticipated  dates  for  actions  by  the  contractor,  EA  team,  and  ADB.  It  will  also  provide  a \nsummary  of  the  reports  due  for  management  and  the  financiers.  The  program  implementation \nplan  and  project  readiness  are  summarized  in  Appendix  9  and  detailed  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n52.   Project  Readiness.  Detailed  design  works  for  the  road  sections  under  the  Investment \nProgram financed by MOTC are under way and expected to be submitted to the State Expertise \n(Gosstroy)  for  approval  by  early  December  2008.  The  preparation  of  safeguard  documents, \nincluding  the  EIA  and  LARPs  for  the  subsequent  projects,  is  also  under  way.  MOTC  has \ninitiated advance contracting as approved by ADB to expedite project implementation.  \n \n53.  \nFor each subsequent project, MOTC, with assistance of the PMC-ADB, will prepare (i) a \nproject report, including technical, economic, financial, environmental, and social assessments; \nand  (ii)  a  PFR.  The  project  report  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  and \nprocedures stated in Appendix 10, and other related requirements of the Government and ADB. \nAfter  appraising  each  project  for  technical  and  economic  feasibility  and  compliance  with \nsafeguard  requirements,  MOTC  will  submit  to  ADB  a  summary  appraisal  report  to  be  agreed \nbetween ADB and MOTC. ADB will then undertake due diligence in accordance with its relevant \npolicies and procedures, and approve the appraisal, subject to any amendments. If required by \nADB, MOTC will amend the PFR and submit it to ADB for approval on or before the due date of \nthe  PFR.  Meanwhile,  MOTC  will  make  advance  contracting  for  Project  1  and  subsequent \nprojects as approved by ADB to expedite implementation.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement  \n\n54.   Procurement of goods, civil works, and related services financed from the ADB and JICA \nloans will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time) and the procurement plans for the projects. The procurement plan for Project 1 is \nin  Appendix  11.  Procurement  plans  for  subsequent  projects  will  be  developed  during  their \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n17\n\npreparation.  To  ensure  competitive  bidding,  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  contract \npackages  will  be  adopted.  ICB  will  be  used  for  civil  works  over  $3  million  and  for  goods  over \n$1 million. National competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works could be conducted for contracts \nnot exceeding $3 million. Civil works contracts will be procured through ICB among pre-qualified \nbidders.  ADB\u2019s  prior  review  procedures  will  be  followed. MOTC  agreed  to  include  the  relevant \nsections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  in  all  bidding  and \ncontractual documents.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  only  involve  ICB  procurement.  If  there  is  a  need  for  NCB \n55.  \nprocurement,  before  commencement  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB,  JICA,  and  MOTC  will  review \nthe Government\u2019s procurement procedures to ensure consistency with ADB requirements. Any \nnecessary modifications or clarifications to the Government\u2019s procedures will be reflected in the \nprocurement plan. \n \n56.   Project 1 involves three ICB contract packages for road civil works. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n57.  \nThe Investment Program requires the assistance of consultants. The assistance is split \ninto  two:  a  core  team  to  be  engaged  upfront  and  additional  inputs  to  be  brought  into  the \nInvestment Program as and when required. The first will be financed under the first tranche and \nthe latter under subsequent tranches.  It is estimated that a total of about 814 person-months of \nconsultancy services (179 person-months international and 635 person-months national) will be \nneeded  for  Project  1.  About  52  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  98  person-\nmonths  of  national  consultants  will  be  required  for  the  PMC-ADB.  About  94  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants  and  504  person-months  of  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  for \nsupervision  construction.  About  21  person-months  of  international  and  21  person-months  of \nnational consultants will be required to assist MOTC in improving the road maintenance system. \nApproximately  12  international  and  12  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  help  MOTC \ndevelop an ITS strategy.  \n \n58.   All consultants financed from  ADB  and JICA loans will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the \nprocurement plans for the projects. Consulting firms will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures.  Full  technical  proposals  will  be  required  for  the \nPMC-ADB,  construction  supervision,  improvement  of  the  road  maintenance  system,  and \ndevelopment  of  ITS.  The  outline  of  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  to  be  recruited  under \nProject 1 is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n59.   ADB Management has approved advance action for procuring civil works to be financed \nby  ADB  under  the  Investment  Program.  MOTC  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance \ncontracting  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Investment  Program  or  any  project.  No \nretroactive financing is envisaged. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n60.   ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and \nMOTC. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to projects. To support these efforts, relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\ndocuments  for  the  Investment  Program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the Investment Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Investment Program and individual projects, \nand all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers. An anticorruption action \nplan was agreed with MOTC for implementation (Appendix 12). \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n61.  \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for \ncivil works contracts and consulting services. No imprest account will be required. The proposed \nfund flow is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n\n8. \n\nFinancial Accounting and Auditing \n\n62.  \nThe  Government  through  MOTC  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  (i)  maintain  separate \naccounts  for  each  of  the  projects  under  the  Investment  Program;  (ii)  have  such  accounts \naudited  annually,  in  accordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied  by \nindependent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable \nto ADB; (iii) furnish to ADB as soon as available but in any event not later than 6 months after \nthe end of each related fiscal year, certified copies of such audited project accounts and audited \nfinancial  statements  and  the  report  of  the  auditors  relating  thereto  (including  the  auditors\u2019 \nseparate opinions on the use of the loan proceeds and compliance with the financial covenants \nof the loan agreement; and (iv) furnish to ADB such other information concerning such accounts \nand  financial  statements  and  the  audit  thereof  as  ADB  shall  from  time  to  time  reasonably \nrequest. The independent auditors will be engaged and financed by the Government. A financial \nmanagement action plan was agreed with MOTC for implementation (Appendix 13). \n \n\n9. \n\nPerformance and Monitoring  \n\n63.  \nThe  Committee  of  Roads,  assisted  by  the  PMC-ADB,  will  establish  an  ADB  project \nperformance  monitoring  system  within  6  months  from  project  commencement  and  collect \nbaseline  data  for  performance  monitoring.  The key  indicators  and  assumptions  outlined  at  the \nimpact  and  outcome  levels  in  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  design  and  monitoring  framework  will \nbe the primary data required for analysis. \n \n\n10. \n\nReviews  \n\nADB  will  field  an  inception  mission  within  3  months  after  signing  of  the  FFA  and  the \n64.  \nloan agreement for Project 1. Review missions will be carried out on a semiannual basis jointly \nby  representatives  of  ADB,  Borrower,  MOTC,  and  the  Committee  of  Roads.  The  review \nmissions  will  assess  the  project  implementation,  including  procurement,  civil  works,  financing \nstatus,  and  environmental  and  social  safeguards  based  on  quarterly  progress  reports  and \ndiscuss  implementation  progress.  A  mid-term  review  mission  will  be  carried  out  2  years  after \neach  loan  becomes  effective.  Each  mid-term  review  will  evaluate  compliance  with  the  terms, \nconditions, and undertakings set out in the FFA, environmental and social safeguards, and loan \ncovenants  set  out  in  the  loan  agreements.  The  review  will  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse \ncorrections to ensure successful implementation and the achievement of the project objectives. \nA  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  by  MOTC  within  3  months  of  the  completion  of \neach project. \n \n65.  \nThe  ADB  Resident  Missions  in  Almaty  and  Astana  will  be  asked  to  look  after  the \nInvestment Program jointly with teams at headquarters. Staff will be deployed to Almaty as and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n19\n\nwhen  it  is  considered  necessary.  A  fuller  review  will  be  carried  out  1  year  after  loan \neffectiveness.  Every  year  an  annual  report  of  the  Investment  Program  will  be  produced.    The \nreport will cover issues related to each of the components.  It will report on inputs and outputs \nand  start  generating  information  for  the  outcome  and  impact  indicators  of  the  DMF.  All \ncompliance matters will be covered under the review, including warranties and representations, \ncovenants an adherence to ADB policies and procedures. The Project Performance Report will \nbe updated every month and reported to the front office within CWRD.   \n \n\nIV. \n\nBENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits  \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n66.  \nThe improved Investment Program road will permit higher travel speeds, shorten travel \ndistance, and improve the road safety standard. As a result, vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime  for  users  of  the  improved  road  will  be  reduced.  The  accident  rate  is  also  expected  to \ndecline.  The  economic  analysis  for  the  road  sections  in  Zhambyl  Oblast  indicates  an  average \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  18%  showing  that  the  Investment  Program  is \neconomically viable. The summary of the economic analysis is in Appendix 14. \n \n67.   Project 1 was found to achieve a combined EIRR of 28%. A sensitivity test was carried \nout  to  assess  the  impact  of  different  benefit  and  cost  attributes  for  Project  1.  Under  the  worst \ncase scenario, with traffic 25% less and construction costs increased by 25%, the sensitivity test \ndemonstrated  that  Project  1  is  robust  across  the  broad  range  of  variations  in  these  key \nparameters  with  EIRR  of  about  20%.  Moreover,  the  combined  effect  of  excluding  generated \ntraffic and ignoring traffic accident savings resulted in an EIRR of about 26%. \n \n68.   A sensitivity test was also performed to examine the effect of delaying implementation of \nProject  1  to  5  years.  The  EIRR  was  slightly  reduced  from  28%  to  27%.  This  suggests  that, \ndespite the effect of reducing the discounted construction costs by deferring construction over \n5 years, the overall effect is negative\u2014with reduced net present value and rates of return for all \nsensitivity tests. This sensitivity test further demonstrates that the results for Project 1 are robust \nacross the broad range of variations in these key parameters. \n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Impacts \n\n69.   Analysis was undertaken using a forward-looking computable general equilibrium model \nto  estimate  direct  and  indirect  effects  of  the  corridor  development  plan.  A  summary  of  the \nmacroeconomic  assessment  is  in  Appendix  15.  This  approach  captures  not  only  direct  costs \nand benefits, but a wide array of economic activities that are facilitated by infrastructure through \ntransport and distribution services. Generally, the cumulative indirect benefits far outweigh direct \nproject  costs  and  benefits,  and  these  benefits  accrue  both  to  Kazakhstan  and  to  many \neconomies linked to it by trade\u2014including neighboring Central Asian countries as well as more \nremote trading partners such as European Union countries. Because of their pervasive linkages, \nmore  efficient  trade  and  transport  services  benefit  every  sector  of  Kazakhstan\u2019s  economy.  By \n2020, the indirect benefits of the road corridor will be more than 10 times the direct project net \nbenefits. \n \n70.  \nThe corridor investment will have significant regional spillovers for Kazakhstan\u2019s trading \npartners,  including  above  all  the  Central  Asian  economies  whose  combined  GDP  will  be  43% \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nhigher  in  2020  compared  to  the  2010  benchmark.  The  effect  is  greatest  for  immediate \nneighbors, like the Kyrgyz Republic, which have high trade shares with and through Kazakhstan \nand  relatively  low  initial  GDP.  These  growth  spillovers  can  be  expected  to  radiate  across  the \nregion and beyond, and are an important justification for this Investment Program in the regional \npolicy dialogue. Despite their size and diversity, both the Russian Federation and the PRC will \ngain significantly from the entire corridor investment through trade linkages, with real GDP gains \nof 4% for the Russian Federation in 2020 and 6% for the PRC. \n \nIt  is  important  to  recognize  the  stakes  that  all  Kazakhstan\u2019s  trading  partners  have  in \n71.  \nregional infrastructure. While the percentage effects of real GDP results in level terms vary with \nproximity, level effects depend on the volume of trade and size (capacity for export production \nand import absorption) of trading partners. Thus, the economies of European Union countries, \nfor  example,  capture  significant  nominal  benefits  from  the  improved  transport  infrastructure \nbecause  of  strong  ties  to  the  region  through  capital  goods  markets  and  relatively  high  import \nand  export  elasticities.  These  results  support  the  essential  message  that  the  benefits  of  this \nInvestment  Program  are  truly  multilateral.  Significant  nominal  income  gains  accrue  to  larger \neconomies, suggesting a broader basis for financing and policy support. \n \n\n3. \n\nSustainability \n\nThe  Investment  Program  will  be  fully  public  sector  investment,  as  the  current  traffic  of \n72.  \nabout 4,000 vehicles per day does not justify full private sector investment. However, MOTC will \nconsider  offering  the  Investment  Program  to  the  private  sector  at  a  later  stage  when  traffic \njustifies  doing  so.  With  EBRD  assistance,  MOTC  is  developing  a  concession  agreement \nbetween the Government and the private sector; and is piloting public\u2013private partnership for a \nroad  section  of  the  corridor.  Provided  this  pilot  project  is  implemented  successfully,  it  can  be \nreplicated in other highway sections. \n \nThe road sector budget will increase up to about 1.6% of GDP by 2012, of which routine \n73.  \nmaintenance  will  be  about  0.1%  GDP.  It  is  expected  that  the  routine  maintenance  will  also \nincrease\u2014reaching 0.3% of GDP\u2014to keep the Investment Program sustainable. \n \n\n4. \n\nGovernance \n\n74.   A  governance  assessment  was  undertaken  for  the  corridor  investment  by  the  World \nBank.  ADB  confirmed  the  methodology  and  findings,  and  the  supports  the  recommendations. \nBased on the analysis of the legislative framework, the effectiveness of regulatory institutions, \nthe strength of enforcement regimes, the capacity of the Committee of Roads and MOTC, the \navailability  of  human  resources,  and  the  risk  of  corruption,  the  fiduciary  assessment  rated  the \nenvironment  for  conducting  procurement  under  the  Investment  Program  as  \u201chigh  risk\u201d. 15 To \nmitigate this, it was agreed that the procurement activities will be delegated to the PMC teams. \nMoreover,  a  financial  management  action  plan  and  an  anticorruption  action  were  developed. \nThe governance assessment is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n\n5. \n\nSocial Dimensions and Poverty Reduction  \n\n75.  \nThe Investment Program is a general intervention, as opposed to a targeted intervention \nthat  specifically  addresses  poverty  reduction  through  interventions  at  the  level  of  households, \nspecific  services,  or  geographical  determinants  of  poverty.  Consequently,  the  Investment \nProgram design does not have to include a poverty reduction strategy.  \n\n                                                 \n15  World  Bank.  2008.  Assessment  on  Governance  and  Financial  Management  for  Kazakhstan.  South  West \n\nDevelopment Program (unpublished appraisal mission report).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n21\n\nThere  will  be  both  direct  and  indirect  beneficiaries  of  the  Investment  Program,  both  in \n76.  \nKazakhstan and in neighboring countries. The beneficiaries include trading, logistics, and other \nservice  industry  operators.  They  also  include  farmer  communities,  food  and  industrial \nmanufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 16 and the poverty and social analysis is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n77.  \nThe  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  generate  considerable  local  employment, \nparticularly  for  unskilled  labor.  Opportunities  will  vary  along  the  alignment  of  the  Investment \nProgram  roads.  The  Investment  Program  is  not  expected  to  exacerbate  gender  inequities. \nBetter  connectivity  can  yield  important  externalities,  including  access  to  health  and  education \ncenters.  The  program  will  have  gender-related  benefits,  particularly  as  urban  centers  become \nbetter connected to isolated rural areas, thus improving mobility and job opportunities in the city. \nThere  are  also  institutional  and  change  management  gains.  Opportunities  are  to  be  expected \nalong much of the alignment, although female participation may be limited where worker camps \nare  established,  unless  the  contractors  make  special  provisions  available  to  attract  women  to \nthe sites. Highway construction and the development of long-term transit routes will likely lead to \nan  increase  in  the  transmission  and  spread  of  HIV  in  many  areas.  Public  information  leaflets \nfocusing on HIV/AIDS transmission, and initiated a needle exchange program at one site will be \ndistributed. These initiatives, and others, will be incorporated in the Investment Program. \n \n78.   Kazakhstan  is  a  source,  transit,  and  destination  country  for  human  trafficking;  and \nevidence of internal rural\u2013urban trafficking is growing. The Investment  Program is  not likely to \naffect current trafficking patterns materially, as the investments themselves will not remove any \nsignificant  transit  barriers.  However,  once  work  on  the  full  corridor  is  completed,  including \nZhambyl Oblast, the improved corridor may be seen by both human and drug traffickers as an \nattractive alternative to the prevailing south\u2013north route. To deter such a transition, one element \nof the communications program for the whole corridor program should focus on human and drug \ntrafficking,  aimed  at  raising  public  awareness  and  encouraging  civil  society  engagement  to \nprotect potential victims of trafficking and aid efforts to detect and stop traffickers.   \n \nB. \n\nImpacts \n\n1. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n79.  \nThe Investment Program will entail the construction and improvement or rehabilitation of \none  or  more  road  sections  in  Zhambyl  Oblast.  Other  sections  will  be  financed  by  the  EBRD, \nWorld Bank, the Government, and the private sector. Social due diligence has been undertaken \nfor Project 1. \n \n80.   Civil works for Project 1 do not involve LAR, and thus do not require the preparation and \nimplementation of an LARP. The subsequent projects, however, will include the construction of \nroads\u2014with LAR requiring the preparation and implementation of the LARPs. Based on ADB\u2019s \nprocessing requirement for MFFs, MOTC has prepared a LARF reflecting Kazakhstan law, ADB \nprocessing  mechanisms,  and  shared  compensation  and  rehabilitation  provisions  mandated  by \nthe  relevant  policies  of  the  four  concerned  IFIs. 16  A  summary  of  social  safeguards  is  in \nAppendix 17 and the LARF is in Supplementary Appendix G.    \n \n\n                                                 \n16 As per ADB, processing mechanisms and compensation/rehabilitation provisions are based on ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), the LARF, and ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section F2: Involuntary Resettlement. \nManila. \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nInvestment  Program  areas  (Zhambyl  Oblast)  are  inhabited  by  a  population  with  an \n81.  \noverwhelming  Kazakh  majority.  No  people  fitting  ADB\u2019s  definition  of  indigenous  peoples  are \nexpected to be negatively affected by the Investment Program.  \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n82.   Project  1  will  have  no  new  impacts  on  the  natural  environment  along  or  inside  of  the \nROW,  aside  from  the  possible  need  to  remove  a  few  shelterbelt  trees.  All  attempts  should  be \nmade  to  minimize  removal  of  shelterbelt  trees,  as  there  are  few  trees  in  the  area  to  provide \nshade, bird nesting sites, and wildlife habitat. MOTC is expected to pay special attention to the \nfollowing  potential  impacts  during  construction:  mismanagement  of  earthwork  and  aggregate \nsite  operations,  mismanagement  of  lead  contaminated  soils,  mismanagement  of  construction \ncamp wastes and fuels, mismanagement of asphalt and concrete production, air pollution during \nconstruction, and bridge and culvert replacement and repair. The Investment Program will also \nenhance the capacity of the EA on environmental management through training provided by the \nPMC-WB. \n \n83.   Project  1  has  no  major  environmental  impacts  and  according  to  ADB  guidelines  is \nenvironment  category  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  summary  IEE  (SIEE) \nhave  been  prepared.  The  SIEE  is  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H  and  the  IEE  is  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  I.  Project  implementation  will  require  environmental  monitoring  as \ndetailed  in  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  included  in  the  IEE  and  SIEE  to  avoid \nstandard  construction  impacts.  These  include  environmental  standard  operating  procedures \nsuch  as  cleaning  up  construction  sites,  proper  disposal  of  spoils,  grading  damaged  land  and \nreplanting  vegetation,  and  protecting  the  public  from  excessive  noise  and  dust  during \nconstruction.   \n \n84.  \nThe  EARF  has  been  prepared  to  provide  guidance  in  preparation  of  environmental \nassessments for the subsequent projects (Supplementary Appendix J). This has been prepared \nby the Government in agreement with ADB, and in compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002) and the Government\u2019s environmental assessment regulations and guidelines.  \n \n85.   A  cumulative  impact  assessment  has  been  undertaken  for  the  Investment  Program  to \nexamine the effects of this and the other donor\u2019s road projects, as well as other initiatives being \nundertaken  in  a  number  of  key  sectors  (Supplementary  Appendix  K).  Valued  ecosystem \ncomponents  have  been  identified  from  environment  subsectors  such  as  air  quality,  social \ndevelopment  and  poverty  alleviation,  agricultural  development,  land  use  and  urban  planning, \ntourism, and ecosystem health and biodiversity protection. The cumulative impact assessment \nis founded on comprehensive scoping to identify key  valued ecosystem components and their \nindicators  to  ascertain  the  potential  cumulative  effects  of  multiple  development  activities.  The \ncumulative impact assessment provides a prudent hedge against serious negative effects that \ncould unnecessarily reduce the value of the road development. It also identifies, stimulates, or \nenhances cumulative benefits. \n \nC. \n\nAssumptions and Potential Risks \n\n86.  \nThe  main  potential  risks  to  the  Investment  Program  include  lack  of  strict  adherence  to \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines;  start-up  delays  in  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program \nparticularly  Project  1;  and  delays  in  preparatory  works  for  the  subsequent  projects.  Sound, \ntimely,  and  cost-effective  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program  assumes  a  professional \nand competent project management function, an unaltered strategy and policy framework, and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n23\n\ncontinued institutional changes.  \n \n87.   MOTC  is  to  implement  the  financial  management  action  plan  and  the  anticorruption \naction plan to ensure that good governance is in place. Start-up delays risk will be mitigated by \nproviding an international procurement specialist under an ADB technical assistance17 grant to \nhelp  MOTC  procure  contractors,  suppliers,  and  consultants  until  the  PMC-ADB  is  selected. \nDetailed  design  works  for  the  Investment  Program  is  under  way  and  financed  under  MOTC\u2019s \nbudget.  Training  on  safeguards  has  been  provided  by  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  to  national \nconsultants preparing the detailed design. \n \n88.   Exogenous factors such as rising construction costs caused by fuel price increases may \nalso affect the success of the Investment Program, especially with regard to the overall budget \nand  current  financing  plan.  Finally,  and  after  construction,  the  success  of  the  program  will \ndepend  on  how  well  and  how  frequently  the  assets  are  maintained.  The  introduction  of  best \npractice safety measures is also a matter for consideration. \n \n89.   Overall,  the  chances  that  implementation  will  be  done  on  time,  within  budget  and  to \ninternational  standards,  are  high.  The  project  management  team  will  be  staffed  with  skilled \npersonnel,  national  and  international.  An  experienced  professional  with  a  record  in  project \nmanagement  and  civil  engineering  will  manage  this  team.  The  business  processes  and  the \noperating  procedures  for  awarding  contracts  and  then  managing  them  are  reasonably  well-\nestablished and credible in Kazakhstan. It is also highly likely that the authorities will adhere to \nbest practice when it comes to design and construction standards. Project management will be \ntightened  and  then  monitored  through  the  introduction  of  a  high  standard  road  construction \nmanagement and information system. \n \n90.  \nThe  Government  has  committed  to  the  strategy  and  policy  framework.  The  policy \nframework  has  all  the  right  principles,  including  outsourcing  to  the  private  sector  and  regular \nroad  maintenance  funding.  The  risk  of  a  policy  reversal  is  low.  The  same  applies  to  the  roles \nand functions of key institutions. MOTC has been restructured and given more of a regulatory \nand  supervision  mandate.  It  is  unlikely  that  this  institution  will  be  reconverted  to  operate  the \nconstruction and operation of the entire road network on its own. Maintenance remains in public \nhands. One of the key reforms includes the possible reintroduction of a road maintenance fund. \nThis would assure continuity and stability with regard to the financing plan after the construction \nphase.  \n \nThe  Government  is  also  assumed  to  continue  improving  cross-border  policies  and \n91.  \nfacilities,  and  sustaining  policies  conducive  to  economic  growth  and  regional  integration. \nTraining will be given under Project 1 to take care of capacity building needs.  \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the \n\n92.  \nlegal documents in addition to the standard assurances: \n \n\n                                                 \n17  ADB.  2008.

The Government will keep ADB and IFIs informed in a timely manner of \nany  changes  to  and  progress  in  implementing  the  road  map,  Investment \nProgram,  and  the  financing  plan  and  will  consult  with  them  in  a  policy  dialogue \naffecting any of these elements. \n\nThe Government will make available all counterpart funds required for timely and \neffective  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program  through  annual  budget \nallocations to MOTC, and will ensure that necessary resources thus required are \nreleased  in  a  timely  manner.  The  Government  will  cause  MOTC  to  include  the \nupdated  funding  requirements  for  implementation  of  the  Investment  Program  in \nits annual development program. \n\nThe  Government  will  cause  MOTC  to  allocate  a  routine  maintenance  budget  in \naccordance  with  the  2006\u20132012  RDP  and  that,  each  fiscal  year  after  2012,  the \nbudget will be increased by no less than annual inflation rates, provided always \nthat sound fiscal balance is maintained. The Government will allocate and make \navailable, on a timely basis, sufficient funds for the implementation of the RDP. \nThe  Government  will  have  such  expenditures  audited  annually  and  make  them \navailable to ADB upon request. \n\nThe  Government  through  MOTC  will  ensure  that  the  Investment  Program  is \ncarried out in accordance with the applicable technical specifications and design, \nand that the construction supervision, quality control, and project management of \nthe Investment Program are performed in accordance with applicable standards \nand  best  international  practices.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  road \nsections  covered  by  the  RDP  are  maintained  in  accordance  with  applicable \nstandards and best international practices. \n\nThe Government through MOTC will ensure that civil works contracts will include \ncontractor\u2019s obligation to comply with road safety measures. MOTC will monitor \nthe accident rate and traffic volume after commencement of the operation of the \nInvestment Program road. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  design,  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance  of  the  facilities  under  the  Investment  Program  are  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy,  the  Government\u2019s  environmental \nlaws  and  regulations,  the  agreed  EARF,  cumulative  impact  assessment,  and \nrespective  IEE  for  Project  1  and  EIAs  for  the  subsequent  projects.  The \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\n \n\nGovernment  through  MOTC  will  ensure  that  potential  adverse  environmental \nimpacts arising from the Investment Program are minimized by implementing all \nmitigation  and  monitoring  measures  as  presented \nthe  environment \nmanagement plan (EMP) included in the IEE and EIA. The Government through \nMOTC will ensure that: \n\nin \n\n(a) \n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\nEMPs are updated prior to issuance of notices to proceed. \nThe  Borrower  has  allocated  and  made  available  to  MOTC  sufficient \nresources  to  implement  and  record  the  implementation  of  the  EMPs \nprepared for the Investment Program. \nThe project director, with assistance of the PMC-ADB and the supervision \nconsultant, prepares semiannual environmental reports and submits them \nADB, within 3 months of the close of each half of the calendar year during \nimplementation of each individual project under the Investment Program. \nThe report will include, among other things, a review of progress made on \nenvironmental measures detailed in the IEE, EIAs, EMPs, and monitoring \nthereof; and problems encountered and remedial measures taken. \nDetailed  engineering  designs,  civil  works,  and  other  contracts  for  the \nInvestment  Program \nincorporate  applicable  environmental \nmeasures identified in the IEE, EIAs, and EMPs. \nCivil  works  contractors  are  supervised  to  ensure  compliance  with  the \nrequirements of the IEE, EIAs, and EMPs. \nThe  LARF  is  updated,  disclosed,  and  sent  to  ADB  for  review  prior  to \nappraisal of the tranches. \nThe  summary  EIAs  are  disclosed  to  the  public  120  days  before  the \napproval of the tranches by ADB Management.   \n\nfacilities \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  comply  with,  and  will  ensure  that  MOTC  complies  with, \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. The Government, consistent with its commitment to \ngood governance, accountability and transparency, agrees (a) that ADB has the \nright to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Investment  Program;  and  (b)  to \ncooperate  fully  with  any  such  investigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary \nassistance, including providing access to all relevant books and records, as may \nbe  necessary  for  the  satisfactory  completion  of  any  such  investigation.  In \naddition, the Government will (a) conduct periodic inspections on the contractors\u2019 \nactivities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  (b)  ensure  that  all \ncontracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Investment  Program  include \nprovisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey  relate  to  the  Investment  Program;  and  (c)  the  construction  supervision \nconsultant  shall  verify  the  contractors\u2019  payment  certificates  in  accordance  with \nworking  drawings  and  contract  specifications.  MOTC  will \nthe \nanticorruption action plan (para. 60).  \n\nimplement \n\n \n(ix) \n\nThe  Government,  through  MOTC,  will  include  a  specific  provision  in  bidding \ndocuments to ensure that civil works contractors (a) comply with applicable core \nlabor  standards,  labor  laws,  and  incorporate  applicable  workplace  occupational \nsafety norms; (b) do not differentiate payment between men and women for work \nof equal value; (c) do not employ child labor in the construction and maintenance \nactivities; and (d) to the extent possible, maximize employment of local poor and \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndisadvantaged  persons  for  project  construction  purposes,  provided  that  the \nrequirements  for  job  and  efficiency  are  adequately  met.  MOTC  will  ensure  that \nappropriate  entities\u2014for  example,  nongovernment  organizations\u2014disseminate \ninformation on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, to \nthe  employees  of  civil  works  and  contractors  engaged  under  the  Investment \nProgram  and  to  members  of  the  local  communities  surrounding  the  Investment \nProgram road. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  Project  1  will  not  involve  LAR  within  the \nmeaning  of  ADB\u2019s \n(1995),  applicable \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy \ngovernment\u2019s  law  and  regulations,  and  the  agreed  LARF;  and  all  civil  works \nunder Project 1 are carried out within existing ROWs. However, if based on detail \ndesign additional land is required triggering any LAR or loss of assets, MOTC will \nprepare,  disclose,  and  implement  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the \nLARF.  \n\nFor  the  subsequent  projects  that  will  involve  LAR  and  loss  of  assets,  the \nGovernment  will  ensure  that  no  civil  works  contract  is  awarded  until  the \nrespective  LARP  has  been  agreed  with  ADB  based  on  detailed  design.  The \nLARPs  must  be  prepared  and  disclosed  to  the  affected  persons  before \nsubmission of the respective PFR to ADB for review. \n\nThe Government will ensure that the entire Investment Program is carried out in \naccordance  with \nlaws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy, and the LARF including, inter alia, the following \nprovisions: \n\nthe  Borrower\u2019s  applicable \n\n \n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\n \n(xii) \n\nLARPs  shall  be  prepared  in  consultation  with,  and  disclosed  to,  the \naffected persons in accordance with the provisions of the LARF; \nThe  LARPs  shall  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  clearance  prior  to \naward of any civil works contract; \nAll  land  and  rights  of  way  required  by  the  Investment  Program  shall  be \nacquired and made available in a timely manner; \nAll  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  shall  be  provided  to \naffected persons prior to their displacement and dispossession;  \nEfficient  grievance  redress  mechanisms  shall  be  in  place  in  accordance \nwith  the  LARPs  to  assist  affected  persons  in  resolving  queries  and \ncomplaints if any, in a timely manner; \nAdequate staff and resources shall be made available for supervising and \nmonitoring  implementation  of  the  LARPs.  An  independent  monitor \nacceptable to ADB shall be engaged to carry out external monitoring and \nevaluation of the LARPs and to report the results to ADB on a semiannual \nbasis.  Semiannual  reports  shall  be submitted  to  ADB  within  3 months  of \nthe end of each period covered. The internal monitoring shall be carried \nout by the raion administration; \nIf during implementation of the LARPs, any changes to the location, land \nalignment  of  roads,  or  additional  environmental  and/or  resettlement \nimpacts are identified, the LARPs shall be updated and prior approval by \nADB and the relevant government agency shall be obtained before further \nimplementation of the LARPs. \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n27\n\n(xiii)  MOTC  will  maintain  separate  project  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify \nthe civil works, goods, and consulting services financed from the loan proceeds, \nthe financing resources received (including counterpart funds) and expenditures \nincurred  for  the  Investment  Program.  These  project  accounts  and  related \nfinancial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing \nstandards by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The Ministry of Finance \nwill  submit  audited  project  accounts  and  audited  financial  statements  to  ADB \nwithin 6 months after the end of each fiscal year during project implementation. In \naddition,  the  Government  through  the  Ministry  of  Finance  shall  ensure  that  an \nannual  performance  audit  for  the  Investment  Program  is  completed  pursuant  to \nthe terms of reference to be developed by ADB, provided that all costs incurred \nin  connection  with  such  performance  audits  shall  be  the  Government\u2019s  cost \ncontribution.  In  addition,  MOTC  will  implement  the  financial management  action \nplan (para. 62).  \n\n \n(xiv)  The  Committee  of  Roads  will  ensure  that,  subsequent  to  awarding  civil  works \ncontract  under  any  project,  no  notice  to  proceed  is  issued  to  contractors  for \nrespective sections or parts of the Investment Program road until the applicable \nprovisions of the resettlement plans (including in particular the timely delivery of \ncompensation to affected families) and EMPs have been complied with. \n\n \n(xv)  Any changes to the location, land alignment of roads, or environmental impacts \non account of detailed designs of related projects will be subject to prior approval \nby  ADB  and  the  relevant  government  agency  in  accordance  with  the  approval \nprocedures set forth in the FFA. \n\n(xvi)  The Government will cause MOTC through the project director to submit to ADB \nquarterly progress reports within 2 weeks of the quarter to which they relate.

Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  has \nreached about 10.6% annually since 2001.1 This growth is expected to continue, leading to an \nincrease  in  road  freight  transport  (in  ton-kilometers)  of  about  10%  per  year  and  a  rise  in  the \nnumber of vehicles of about 5% per year.2 The motorization level of about 100 cars per 1,000 \npopulation is relatively high in the region but low by the European standard of above 300 cars \nper 1,000 inhabitants.3 \n \nKazakhstan\u2019s  vast  territory,  low  population  density,  mineral  resources  scattered  across \n2.  \nthe  country,  and  location  between  Europe  and  Asia  make  it  one  of  the  world\u2019s  most  cargo-\nintensive systems. This results in high dependency on the transport system.  \n \nRoads are a key element of Kazakhstan\u2019s transport system, playing an important role in \n3.  \nproviding access to rural areas, and facilitating transit traffic and in-country transport movement. \nHowever, much of the road network is in poor condition\u2014about 40% of the republican (national) \nroads requires major rehabilitation and proper maintenance. Moreover, the feeder road network \nserving rural population is not fully developed; and is characterized by poor conditions and a low \nservice level, especially during wintertime. This results in high cost of goods\u2014the transport cost \ncomponent  is  about  10%  of  the  cargo  value,  which  is  far  above  the  average  of  about  4%  in \ndeveloped  economies  (footnote  1). Despite  the high  costs,  the  overall  domestic  transit  volume \n(in  tons)  has  grown  rapidly,  with  annual  growth  of  about  10%.  A  problem  tree  analysis  is  in \nFigure A2. \n \nB. \n\nRoad Network \n\n4.  \nKazakhstan has three road networks, each under the responsibility of different levels of \nGovernment  and  their  respective  road  organizations:  (i)  the  republican  roads  are  under  the \nresponsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  and  are  managed  by \nthe  Committee  of  Roads,  (ii)  local  or  rural  roads  are  under  oblasts  or  provincial  governments, \nand (iii) urban roads are under municipality or city authorities. \n \n5.  \nsummarized in Table A2.1.  \n \n\nThe  length  of  the  republican  and  rural  roads  by  category  and  pavement  type  is \n\nTable A2.1: Road Network Characteristics \n(kilometer) \n\nI \n\n680 \n\n72 \n\nType of Roads \n\nRoad Classificationa \n\nRoad Pavement \n\nII \n\nIII \n\nIV \n\nV or No Category \n\nAsphalt \n\nNon-asphalt \n\nRepublican Roads \n\n3,500 \n\n16,600 \n\n2,100 \n\nRural Roads \n\n751 \n\n18,714  39,289 \n\n220 \n\n6,539 \n\n6,900 \n\n6,322 \n\n16,200 \n\n59,043 \n\nm = meter. \na Category I: 4-lane (2 x 7.5 m), 6-lane (2 x 11.25 m), 8-lane (2 x 15 m); Category II: 2-lane ( 2 x 7.5 m); Category III: \n2-lane (2 x 7.0 m); Category IV: 2-lane (2 x 6.0 m); Category V: 1-lane (4.5 m)  \nSource: Committee of Roads. \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC). 2007.

Republican roads are under the management of the Committee \n6.  \nof Roads, which has three boards (departments): Operations, Construction and Reconstruction, \nand Quality Control.  \n \nThe Operations Board is largely responsible for the collation and checking of the annual \n7.  \nworks  proposals  developed  by  the  oblasts,  the  preparation  of  the  road  maintenance  budgets, \nrefinement  and  monitoring  of  the  approved  program  after  funds  have  been  allocated  from  the \nbudget,  and  regular  inspections  of  the  works  being  implemented  by  the  Oblast  Road \nAdministration.  \n \n8.  \nThe  Construction  and  Reconstruction  Board  is  responsible  for  overseeing  the  road \ninvestment  program,  which  is  developed  with  foreign  funding  assistance.  It  develops  the \nprojects from the initial stages through to contract/project completion.   \n \n9.  \nThe Quality Control Board is responsible for reviewing works carried out by contractors \nworking  on  capital  repairs  and  reconstruction  contracts  in  oblasts,  reviewing  supervision \nservices carried out by consultants engaged in capital works and reconstruction contracts, and \ninspecting  and  assessing  the  operations  and  quality  of  service  provided  by  oblast-based \nlaboratories. \n \nThere  are  14  oblast-based  road  administrations  with  about  15\u201320  engineers  and \n10.  \ntechnical  staff;  each  is  responsible  for  managing  1,500  kilometers  (km)  of  roads.  The  oblast-\nbased  road  administrations  manage  the  road  program,  supervise  routine  maintenance  works \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ncarried  out  by  Kazakhavtodor,  develop  annual  works  programs  and  annual  programs,  and \nsupervise  all  road  works  outsourced  to  the  private  sector  including  reconstruction  contracts. \nThey sign all service and works contracts on behalf of the Committee of Roads.  \n \n11.   Kazakhavtodor.  Kazakhavtodor,  a  state-owned  enterprise,  was  incorporated  in  late \n1998  and  was  made  responsible  for  road  maintenance  in  December  2000.  Kazakhavtodor  is \nprimarily  responsible  for  routine  maintenance,  winter  maintenance,  taking  care/expanding  the \narea  of  roadside  planting,  road  inspections  and  traffic  counting.  It  is  also  involved  in  road \ninspection  committees.  Kazakhavtodor  is  allowed  to  compete  for  midterm  maintenance  and \ncapital works contracts.  \n \n12.   Procurement. Procurement activities are under the Procurement Department of MOTC. \nThe Procurement Department is involved in managing the whole procurement process until the \nsigning  of  contracts.  The  procurement  process  is  largely  similar  to  that  used  internationally \nexcept  that  the  process  is  shorter.  The  bidding  is  a  two-stage  process.  Bid  documentation  is \navailable  on  the  MOTC  website,  which  is  linked  to  a  government  procurement  bulletin  where \neach contract is listed. The listing for each contract includes all bidding documentation, including \nthe  minutes  produced  at  the  end  of  each  stage  of  the  procurement  process.  All  can  be \ndownloaded  from  the  website.  The  timelines  of  procurement  and  technical  evaluation  criteria \nhave been clearly defined. \n \n13.  \nFinance. The Finance Department under MOTC is directly involved in all Committee of \nRoads  projects,  whether  they  are  domestically  funded  or  assisted  by  IFIs.  It  has  separate \nsections  for  domestically  funded  and  foreign  funded  projects.  The  Finance  Department  is \ndirectly  involved  in  the  payment  process,  including  the  monitoring  of  expenditure  against \nbudgeted amounts. It is presently working on a financial management system that will be able to \nhandle all projects, whether they are funded from the Republican budget or IFIs.   \n \nD. \n\nRoad Funding \n\n14.   Road funding increased from about $120 million in 2000 (0.6% of the national budget) to \nnearly  $1  billion  in  2008.  The  Government  has  recognized  the  transport  deficiencies  and  is \nplanning to increase the budget for the road sector. In 2008, road funding represented about 1% \nof GDP with projections aiming to increase this to 2% of GDP. Developed countries without road \nfunds  spend  on  average  about  1.0%  of  GDP  on  their  roads.  As  expected,  countries  with  road \nfunds spend more with an average of about 1.6% of GDP, of which about 0.3% is spent on road \nmaintenance.  The  current  road  maintenance  budget  of  about  0.1%  of  GDP  is  clearly \ninadequate. \n \n15.  \nThe 2001\u20132005 road sector funding is summarized in Table A2.2 and the Government\u2019s \nRoad Development Program (RDP) for 2006\u20132012 is in Table A2.3. The upgrading works have \nso far focused on key road corridors, and are designed for the increased traffic levels and axle \nloads. Most periodic maintenance works and all rehabilitation, construction, and reconstruction \nworks are outsourced to the private sector.  \n\n \nTable A2.2: Road Sector Funding 2001\u20132005 \n($ million) \n\n2001 \n\n151 \n\n43 \n\n2002 \n\n188 \n\n50 \n\n2003 \n\n229 \n\n56 \n\n2004 \n\n256 \n\n81 \n\n2005 \n\n328 \n\n130 \n\nDescription \n\nConstruction, Reconstruction \n\nRepair and Maintenance \n\nSource: Committee of Roads. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\nTable A2.3: Summary of the Road Development Program 2006\u20132012  \n\nDescription \n\nLength of Road \n(km) \n7,205 \n1,660 \n16,800 \n23,600 \n\n$/Km/Year \nAverage of 6 years \n120,480 \n61,914 \n6,035 \n3,296 \n\nPercentage of \nTotal Allocation \n75 \n9 \n9 \n7 \n\nConstruction and Reconstruction \nCapital Repairs (Rehabilitation) \nMidterm Maintenance (Periodic Maintenance) \nRoutine Maintenance and Repair \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Road Development Program for 2006\u20132012. \n \n16.  \nThe  RDP  proposed  a  significant  increase  in  expenditure,  and  a  program  of  works  that \nfocuses  on  national  and  international  road  corridors.  However,  the  focus  continues  to  be  on \nconstruction  and  reconstruction  rather  than  on  preserving  existing  investments.  It  is  therefore \nexpected that the cycle of construction and reconstruction will continue for some time, and the \ncosts will remain high\u2014leaving limited funds available for oblast and rural roads. Allocations for \nroutine maintenance and repairs, and winter maintenance, will also be limited. This might lead \nto disruption in some roads, including international roads. \n \nE. \n\nRoad Sector Road Map \n\n1. \n\nStrategic Objective \n\n17.   Kazakhstan has put together a strategy or road map to develop the transport sector over \nthe  medium  term.  This  covers  all  modes  of  transport,  including  national  highways,  as  well  as \nprovincial  and  rural  roads.  The  strategy  recognizes  the  need  for  new  assets  (to  increase \nnetwork coverage) and the repair and upkeep of existing ones (to extend their economic life and \nimprove quality). The 2006\u20132015 Transport Strategy outlines transport sector policies and key \nstrategic  directions.  The  main  policy  objective  is  to  achieve  (i)  an  accessible  and  affordable \ntransport  system,  (ii)  a  safe  and  environmentally  friendly  transport  system,  (iii)  an  integrated \ntransport  system,  (iv)  self-recovery  investment  and  operation,  and  (v)  private  sector-driven \ntransport service provision. \n \n\n2. \n\nReform Progress \n\n18.  \nInstitutional  Restructuring.  Institutional  reforms  took  place  in  early  2008  with  the \nreorganization  of  MOTC. 4 Separation  of  a  number  of  key  functions\u2014procurement,  financial \nmanagement,  contract  supervision,  and  quality  control\u2014has  taken  place  within  MOTC.  The \nCommittee of Roads, with its oblast-based road administrations under MOTC, is now primarily \nan  implementation  agency  and  is  taking  a  lead  in  implementing  the  RDP.  The  changes  have \nbeen positive.  \n \n19.   Outsourcing  of  Road  Works. This has been the practice for some times. To improve \nthe work quality of road construction and maintenance, the Committee of Roads has introduced \nextended warranty contracts\u2014with contractors being responsible for guaranteeing their work for \nperiods  of  2  years  for  periodic  maintenance,  3  years  for  rehabilitation,  and  5  years  for \nreconstruction.  \n \n20.  \nThe Committee of Roads has the ability to engage contract supervision for locally funded \ncontracted  works,  and  has  established  a  quality  control  unit.  Routine  maintenance  and  repair \n\n                                                 \n4  MOTC Decree 1193, 6 December 2007. \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ncontracts  continue  to  be  single  sourced  from  Kazakhavtodor.  An  experiment  to  outsource \nroutine maintenance to the private sector failed because of the inability of the private sector to \nperform its obligation, especially during wintertime. \n \n21.   Procurement Process. Procurement is under MOTC\u2019s Procurement Department, which \nmanages  the  whole  process  including  the  preparation  of  contract  documents  and  technical \nspecifications.  The  department  convenes  a  committee  of  representatives  from  relevant \ndepartments of MOTC to oversee a process that is well-defined and has a prescribed schedule. \nThe department oversaw procurement for more than a hundred contracts in 2008.  \n \n22.   Quality  Control  of  Road  Works.  MOTC  has  set  up  14  oblast-based  road  materials \nlaboratories.  The  laboratories  inspect  and  assess  the  performance  of  all  road  works  and \nservices contracts.  \n \n\n3. \n\nChallenges \n\n23.   Road  Condition  and  Maintenance.  While  the  republican  road  network  has  good \ncoverage,  there  are  missing  links  and  the  rural  road  network  does  not  provide  many \ncommunities  with  reliable  year-round  road  access.5 Significant  sections  of  the  republican  road \nnetwork are in poor condition. MOTC aims to achieve about 86% of republican roads and 70% \nof local roads in good condition by 2013 from 62% (republican roads) and 51% (local roads) in \n2006.  \n \n24.  \nThe  roads  performance  has  not  been  up  to  international  standards,  with  major \ninvestment  in  road  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  being  required  before  their  lifetime  period \nend.  The  level  and  frequency  of  reinvestment  in  the  network  in  Kazakhstan  is  therefore  very \nhigh, at $42,000 per km/year for the republican roads in the RDP.  \n \n25.   Road  Funding.  The  investment  need  for  road  asset  preservation  and  maintenance  is \nhigh.  Only  40%  of  the  republican  roads  are  asphalt-based.  Missing  links  also  need  to  be \nconstructed.  Funds  for  road  maintenance  have  increased  under  the  RDP  but  are  still  not \nsufficient.  Road  maintenance  and  repairs  have  been  underfunded  for  some  years,  but  have \nincreased significantly in the last few years with the average allocation for routine maintenance \nand  repairs (including  winter  maintenance)  of  about  $2,000/km  in  2008\u2014about  50%  less  than \nthe Canadian standard for road maintenance. Expenditure on periodic and routine maintenance \nis well below the level necessary for long-term network sustainability, and presently only makes \nup 7% of the budget indicated in the RDP.  \n \n26.  \nThe RDP is still dominated by road reconstruction, rehabilitation, and repairs. There are \ntwo main sources of funding for the road sector: (i) public sector budget and borrowings, and (ii) \nprivate sector sources. Government budget constraints are particularly critical. Funding for the \nroad budget comes from the national budget rather than a specific road fund, although such a \nfund did exist some years ago, and the expenditure gathering mechanisms from that fund still \nexist. However, the revenue is managed by the Ministry of Finance. Private investment in road \ninfrastructure  could  potentially  be  promoted  if  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  is \nimproved.   \n \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.

While the available data indicates that the road situation improved slightly \nin 2007, the number of people killed exceeded 2,000 with a further about 4,700 injured. A fatality \nrate of 18 per 100,000 inhabitants was reported in 2004, which was slightly above the regional \naverage and growing at that time at a rate of more than 10% per annum. The number of people \nkilled between 2005 and 2007 has increased at an annual rate of more than 19% even though \naccidents have only been increasing at around 10% per annum. This suggests that the severity \nof  accidents  is  increasing  at  a  rate  higher  than  the  fatality  rate  (about  15  per  100,000 \ninhabitants) in the eastern European countries (footnote 3).  \n \n28.   Road safety seems to be downplayed in the RDP even though the fatality accident rate \nis  one  of  the  highest  in  the  region.  Speeding  is  a  key  factor  in  road  accidents.  Inadequate \npassing opportunities caused by poor sight distances, especially in undulating terrain and poor \nshoulder conditions, make recovery impossible in many areas. The Ministry of Internal Security, \nwhich  is  responsible  for  addressing  road  accidents,  analyzes  accident  data  and  attempts  to \nidentify  causes.  Past  efforts  to  establish  a  high  level  Road  Safety  Commission  have  been \nresisted and such an organization does not exist at present. \n \n29.  \nThe  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  is  the  leading  agency  responsible,  through  the  State \nTraffic  Police,  for  the  development  of  safety  standards,  rules,  and  regulations;  traffic \nmanagement,  surveillance,  and  enforcement;  vehicle  inspection;  and  accident  data  collection \nand analysis. MOTC is responsible for vehicle certification and developing relevant regulations. \n \n30.   Road  design  and  operations  is  one  of  the  causes  of  traffic  accidents.  Limited  sight \ndistance  does  not  meet  the  international  standard  in  some  places.  Road  signage  is  generally \ninadequate. The ability of the authority to handle traffic accidents is inadequate. While the Police \nseem to have implemented a program of speed enforcement on some roads, this is limited to \nsettlements. More effort on road safety is clearly required, especially in interurban roads.  \n \nTransit  Traffic  and  Border  Crossing.  Geographically,  the  main  transport  routes  in \n31.  \nKazakhstan  are  toward  the  Russian  Federation,  Europe,  and  Central  Asia.  The  main  road \ntransit routes are to the Russian Federation and Central Asia while those destined for Europe \nand Asia account for less than 5% of the total road transit traffic. A total of 24,000 commercial \ntransit vehicles, including large buses and medium to large trucks, crossed Kazakhstan in 2007 \n(excluding  trucks  registered  in  Kazakhstan).  A  total  of  about  350,000  ton  transit  traffic  was \nestimated in 2005, which is much lower than its capacity because of deteriorating infrastructure \nand  cross-border \ninclude  unreasonable  delays  and \ncomplicated  procedures  in  customs  and  frontier  inspection,  contradictions  between  transport \nlegislation and internationals standards, and a lack of international treaties of transit and traffic \nregulation.  Although  there  have  been  improvements  and  there  are  ongoing  negotiations  on \ntransit and trade facilitation, border crossing continues to be time\u2013consuming, with long delays \nat borders as loads are inspected and adjusted to accommodate legal limits.  \n \n32.   Road  Operations. High fatality rates, truck overloading, and low revenues from transit \ncharges  have  been  partly  due  to  an  inadequate  road  operations  and  traffic  management \nsystem.  Road  operations  and  traffic  management  require  reliable  and  accurate  data  about  all \naspects  of  the  road  network.  An  advance  information  system  could  be  applied  to  include  axle \nload  monitoring  and  control  facilities,  road  weather  information  systems,  highways  advisory \nradio and electronic signs, and traffic recording equipment. Such a system would provide data \nrequired  by  maintenance  managers  to  make  the  right  winter  maintenance  decisions  to  ensure \nthat  road  restrictions  are  minimized  and  costs  are  low,  and  to  inform  road  users  of  road \nconditions in a timely manner. \n\nimpediments.  Cross-border \n\nissues \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n33.   Road  Data  and  Road  Planning.  The  present  planning  process  is  not  based  on  the \nactual  road or  traffic  condition.  Road  and  traffic  data  are  incomplete.  The  7-year  development \nplans  are  mostly  based  on  norms  rather  than  actual  road  conditions,  capacity  deficiencies,  or \nroad safety issues. The present system does not provide any reliable indication of the long-term \nconsequences  of  the  strategies  and  plans  being  implemented.  The  existing  system  of  road \ninspections and traffic surveys needs to be modified so that road condition and roadwork needs \n(for the development of the annual maintenance plan) are collected. Traffic surveys also need to \nbe strengthened and expanded, as should the quality of the accident data, so that the causes of \naccidents can be identified.  \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Development Program \n\n34.  \nThe  RDP  comprises  physical  and  nonphysical  investments.  The  planned  investment  is \nalso  guided  by  the  Transport  Strategy  approved  in  2006.  The  physical  investment  targets \nconstruction  and  reconstruction  of  7,205  km  of  republican  roads;  major  and  minor  repairs  of \n18,460  km  of  republican  roads;  and  construction,  reconstruction,  and  repair  of  18,089  km  of \nlocal roads. The aim is to achieve 86% of the republican roads free from defects in 2013. The \nproposed investment will prioritize the following roads: \n \n\nTaskesken\u2013Bakhty,  \nChundzha\u2013Kolzhat, \nUsharal\u2013Dostyk, \nKyzylorda\u2013Zhezkazgan\u2013Pavlodar\u2013border of the Russian Federation,  \n\nTashkent\u2013Shymkent\u2013Taraz\u2013Almaty\u2013Khorgos, \nShymkent\u2013Kyzylorda\u2013Aktobe\u2013Uralsk\u2013Samara,  \nAlmaty\u2013Karaganda\u2013Astana\u2013Petropavlovsk\u2013border of the Russian Federation,  \nAstrakhan\u2013Atyrau\u2013Aktau\u2013Turkmenistan border, \nBridge construction over Kigach River, \nOmsk\u2013Pavlodar\u2013Semipalatinsk\u2013Mykapchagai, \nAstana\u2013Kostanai\u2013Chelyabinsk\u2013Ekaterinburg, \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii)  Almaty\u2013Ayaguz\u2013Georgiyevka,  \n(ix) \n(x) \n(xi) \n(xii) \n(xiii)  Zhezkazgan\u2013Petropavlovsk\u2013border of the Russian Federation, and \n(xiv)  Beineu\u2013Akzhigit\u2013border of Uzbekistan. \n \n35.  \nTable  A2.4  reflects  the  investment  plan  for  the  republican  roads,  showing  a  target  of \nabout  26,000  km  of  republican  roads  to  be  improved.  The  republican  roads,  mostly  asphalt-\npaved, are the backbone of the road network in Kazakhstan. The budget for the republican road \nworks  has  steadily  increased  by  about  20%  annually  in  the  last  5  years  and  is  expected  to \ncontinue increasing at a similar rate. It also shows that about 75% of the budget was allocated \nfor  reconstruction,  16%  for  repair,  and  9%  for  routine  maintenance.  Although  the  budget \nallocated for routine maintenance has increased by 12% annually, it is currently inadequate. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n41 \n\nTable A2.4: Road Development Program (Republican Budget) \n\nNo. \n\nActivity \n\nA. \n1. \n\n2. \nB. \n1. \n2. \n3. \n4. \n\nCivil works (km) \nConstruction, reconstruction, and \nrehabilitation  \nMajor and medium repair \nBudget ($ million) \nConstruction and reconstruction \nMajor repair \nMedium repair \nRoutine maintenance and greenery \nplanning \nResearch and development \n\n2007 \n\n2006 \n2,698  3,137  3,412  3,853  4,037  4,118  4,410  25,665 \n7,205 \n\n882  1,203  1,277  1,228  1,390 \n\n2010 \n\n2012 \n\n2011 \n\n2008 \n\n737 \n\n488 \n\nTotal \n\nYear \n2009 \n\n2,210  2,400  2,530  2,650  2,760  2,890  3,020  18,460 \n6,381 \n4,797 \n568 \n582 \n430 \n\n963  1,024  1,106  1,233 \n935 \n731 \n111 \n87 \n106 \n83 \n81 \n62 \n\n474 \n341 \n32 \n60 \n41 \n\n716 \n532 \n69 \n68 \n46 \n\n865 \n656 \n80 \n75 \n54 \n\n774 \n90 \n91 \n69 \n\n829 \n100 \n98 \n77 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.8 \n\n5 \n\n5. \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Road Development Program for 2006\u20132012. \n \n\n5. \n\nInvestment Plan for the Corridor \n\n36.  \nThe  Government  gives  high  priority  to  improvement  of  the  Western  Europe\u2013Western \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  International  Transit  Corridor  (the  corridor)  running  from \nKhorgos at the border with the PRC, through Almaty and Shymkent, to the western border with \nthe  Russian  Federation.  The  corridor  is  in  bad  condition  and  transit  traffic  and  trade  are \nconstrained by poor infrastructure. Reconstruction of the corridor will improve the road transport \nefficiency following the reduced transport costs and travel time, and improved road operations \nand maintenance system. \n \n37.  \nThe  corridor  has  been  defined  as  corridor  1  out  of  six  priority  corridors  in  the  Central \nAsia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy 6 \nendorsed by CAREC countries. The Government plans to improve the corridor with assistance \nfrom  external  sources  including  ADB,  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development, \nIslamic  Development  Bank  (IDB),  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  and  the \nWorld Bank.  \n \nThe total length of the corridor is about 2,715 km, of which 2,237 km will be constructed \n38.  \nand/or reconstructed. The total investment is about $6.7 billion (Table A2.5). Table A2.6 shows \nthat ADB, IDB, and JICA are jointly expected to finance 480 km of the corridor; European Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development 102 km; the World Bank 1,002 km; and the private sector \n504 km. The Government has already completed 478 km and is constructing 89 km. It plans to \ncomplete the corridor by the end of 2012. The overall investment for the corridor will be a mix of \npublic  sector  investment  and  public\u2013private  partnership.  International  financial  institutions  will \nfinance  about  53%  of  the  total  corridor  investment.  The  private  sector  is  expected  to  finance \n32% and the Government contribution will be about 15%.  \n\n                                                 \n6  Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation. 2007.

The  cost  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  project  road \nsections is mainly based on the design perimeters noted below.1 \n \n3.  \nPavement Design Standards. SNIP road design standards and policies have been used \nand  harmonized  with  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials \n(AASHTO) and British standard for concrete pavement in cold climates.  \n \n4.  \nCost Estimate. The cost estimate is based on 2001 unit prices, but is escalated based on \nthe annual inflation rate to 2007 (issued by the Government) to reflect current prices. During the \ndue diligence, unit rates were compared with the actual bid rates of recent roadworks and hence \nthe overall cost per kilometer (km) was determined for the Investment Program. It may be further \nupdated  after  the  engineers  estimate  is  completed,  based  on  the  detail  designs  (in  progress). \nHowever, it is envisaged that unit costs will remain within current estimates.    \n \n5.  \nAxle  Load  and  Design  Speed.  The pavement design was based on 13 ton single axle \nload. The design speed is 120 km per hour for category I and II roads for flat roads, 100 km per \nhour for rolling roads, and 80 km per hour for mountainous roads. \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008. Preparing the CAREC Transport Corridor I (Zhambyl Oblast Section) Project. Manila (TA 7071-KAZ). \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nCategory-I  Pavement  Cross  Section. The formation width of a category I pavement, in \n6.  \naccordance with Kazakhstan standards, is to be 28.50 meters (m) (two 7.50 m carriageway plus \n4.00  m  median  and  3.75  m  outer,  and  1.00  m  inside  shoulders  on  each  side  of  7.50  m \ncarriageway). The right-of\u2013way (ROW) is to be 60.00 m (30.00 m on either side of the centerline \nof the pavement). \n \n7.  \nCategory-II Pavement. The formation width, according to Kazakhstan standards, is to be \n15 m (two 3.75 m carriageway plus 3.75 m shoulders each side). The ROW is to be 40 m (20 m \non either side of the centerline of the pavement). \n \n8.  \nConcrete  Pavement.  It  will  be  about  a  25\u201328  centimeter  (cm)  thick  (depending  on  the \nlocation and detail designs) concrete layer as a minimum on a crushed stone base (30 cm) and \ngranular  subbase  (20  cm),  with  a  geo-textile  placed  between  the  concrete  and  base  to  prevent \nbonding (to be confirmed after detail design). \n \n9.  \nAsphalt  Pavement.  It  will  comprise  29  cm  (surfacing  7  cm  and  base  layers  22  cm)  of \nasphalt  concrete  in  3  layers,  on  a  crushed  rock  base  and  granular  subbase  (25  cm),  and \nsubgrade (25 cm) (to be confirmed after detail design). \n \n10.   Design  Life.  The  design  life  of  pavements,  for  the  purpose  of  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn  calculations,  is  assumed  to  be  20  years  for  both  concrete  and  asphalt  pavements. \nHowever, the concrete pavement design life is expected to be more than 30 years. \n \n11.   Subgrade Design. The subgrade California Bearing Ratio2 is assumed to be 8% for most \nroad sections and 4% for wet sections (both soaked California Bearing Ratio). Where an existing \nroad is to be reconstructed, the existing pavement will be reused in the new pavement as one of \nthe lower levels of the pavement structure in a stabilized or un-stabilized layer. This may mean \nremoving  the  material  temporarily  while  the  road  formation  is  raised  and  widened  before  being \nreturned and compacted. \n \n12.   Bridge  Replacement  and  Repair.  Recommendations adopted in accordance with SNIP \nrecommendations. \n \n13.   Drainage.  For  drainage,  hydraulic  and  drainage  design  requirements  based  on  data \ncollected in the field during detailed design phase will be used for longitudinal and cross drainage \ndesign (to drain the water away from pavement gradient). Concrete slabs will be used to reinforce \nthe  channels  on  the  high  gradient/slopes.  At  locations  with a  high  water  table,  special  drainage \nfacilities will be provided. Surface and storm water drainage will be designed for 20 years. \n \n14.   Road  Safety.  The  Investment  Program  road  has  a  high  incidence  of  road  fatalities  and \naccidents. The road will be designed to improve safety by eliminating any hazardous curves, and \nimproving  the  road  geometrics.  Road  markings,  traffic  signs,  and  traffic  signal  controls  at  the \njunctions, and road furniture necessary to improve road safety, will be installed on the Investment \nProgram roads. \n \n15.   Materials. Material investigations will be done at potential borrow pits in the vicinity of the \nroads,  using  maximum  locally  available  coarse  and  fine  aggregates  for  subbase,  base,  and \nwearing course. \n\n                                                 \n2   California  Bearing  Ratio  is  a  penetration  test  for  evaluation  of  the  mechanical  strength  of  road  subgrades  and \n\nbasecourses. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n49 \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN FOR PROJECT 1a \n\nADB \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nGovernment \nAmount \n($ million) \n\n% \n\nTotal \n($ million)\n\nItem \n\n \n\n \n\n1.

The following measures proposed by the World Bank will apply \nto the Investment Program: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nTraining.  Fiduciary  staff  training  will  start  from  project  launch  and  periodically \ntake  place  thereafter,  customized  to  procedures  and  methods  required  for  the \nnext  12 months  under  World  Bank  assistance.  On-the-job  training  and  regional \ntraining offered by World Bank will be provided. \nPrior  review.  Intensive  and  close  supervision  will  be  provided  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) staff. All contract amendments will be subject to prior \napproval by ADB. \nPublication  of  advertisements  and  contracts.  All  publications  of \nadvertisements and contract awards, including the results of the awards, will be \ndone  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines  and published  in  the  client connection \nsystem, on external websites. \nDebarred  firms.  Appropriate  attention  will  be  given  to  the  need  to  ensure  that \ndebarred  firms  or  individuals  are  not  given  opportunities  to  compete  for  ADB-\nfinanced contracts. \nComplaints. All complaints by bidders will be diligently addressed and monitored \nin consultation with ADB.  \nProcurement  committee.  The  World  Bank  will  review  and  comment  on  the \nqualifications  and  experience  of  proposed  members  of  the  procurement \ncommittee(s),  with  a  view  to  avoiding  nomination  of  unqualified  or  biased \ncandidates. All members will be required to sign a disclosure form. \n\n(vii)  Civil works supervision. A procurement committee will be established under the \nMinistry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC).  Contractors  carrying  out \nreconstruction of road works contracts will be supervised by technically qualified \nsupervisors,  selected  by  the  procurement  committee,  to  ensure  that  the  quality \nspecified in the contract is delivered in a timely manner. \n\n(viii)  Monitoring  of  contract  awards.  All  contracts  are  required  to  be  signed  within \nthe validity of the bids/proposals and, in case of prior review contracts, promptly \nafter  the  no  objection  is  issued.  The  procurement  plan  format  shall  include \ninformation  on  actual  dates  (of  no  objections  and  award)  and  will  be  monitored \nfor cases of delay which will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to identify the \nreasons.  \n\n(x) \n\n(ix)  Monitoring  of  payments.  All  contracts  shall  include  bank  account  information. \nThe  bank  account  shall  be  in  the  name  of  the  same  contractor/supplier/ \nconsultant  that  submitted  the  bid  and  awarded  the  contract.  Payments  to  local \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants shall be made in local currency only and paid \nto the accounts of banks located within the country.  \nMonitoring of payment versus physical progress. The reports to ADB will be \ncustomized to include a form to monitor physical progress compared to payment \ninstallments to avoid upfront loaded payments. \nTimeliness of payments. Payment to contractors, suppliers, and consultants will \nbe  monitored  through  semiannual  interim  unaudited  financial  reports  to  ensure \ntimely payments. The procurement committee will maintain a system/database to \nensure  that  payments  to  the  suppliers  and  contractors  are  paid  without  delay \naccording to the conditions of the contract. \n\n(xi) \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nFINANCIAL MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN \n\n \n \nThe  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs)  will  harmonize  their  efforts  in  improving \nfinancial  management.  A  collective  international  financial  institution  action  is  expected  to \nstrengthen  effective  and  efficient  project  implementation  and  to  harness  good  governance  in \nfinancial  management,  procurement,  and  anticorruption.  The  following  measures  proposed  by \nthe World Bank will also apply to the Investment Program. \n \n\nThe Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) is  to assign the project \nfinancial management function to a nominated unit within the finance division of \nMOTC,  with  suitably  qualified  staff  that  will  be  responsible  for  the  financial \nmanagement  of  the  Investment  Program.

Hence, to \n1.  \nexplore  the  corridor's  potential  requires  an  understanding  on  the  cargo  types,  major  partners, \nand  transportation  modes.  Kazakhstan's  largest  trade  partners  are  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina (PRC), Europe, and the Russian Federation while smaller countries in the region such as \nUzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic comprise a relatively small amount in trade value, despite \ncontributing significantly in trade volumes (tons).  \n \n2.  \nThe following trends are expected: \n \n\nIn general, the region is stable and Kazakhstan enjoys good relations with its neighbors. \n\nThe freight movement between the PRC, Central Asian countries, and ultimately \nIran,  is  expected  to  fulfill  one  of  the  main  growth  drivers  of  the  corridor,  in \nparticular in the Khorgos\u2013Almaty\u2013Shymkent segments. The corridor is expected \nto  attract  a  significant  market  share  for  freight  of  consumer  and  manufactured \ngoods  but  not  raw  materials,  even  though  the  service  level  provided  by  the \nTrans-Asian  Railway  is still  low.  This  is  partly  dependent  on  the  realization  of  a \nmajor upgrade program of road infrastructure in the Central Asian countries. \n\nThe  emerging  role  of  the  PRC  as  a  global  manufacturer  and  exporter  of \nconsumer  goods,  which  are  more  sensitive  to  door-to-door  distribution  and  in \ntime  shipment,  will  contribute  to  the  fulfillment  of  the  corridor  as  a  west  PRC\u2013\nwest Europe link. This is due to the competitive advantage of the corridor for this \ntype  of  cargo,  especially  from  the  western  PRC.  Production  from  the  eastern \nPRC will continue to be transported by ship or rail because of distance. For other \ntypes  of  trade,  such  as  energy  and  raw  materials,  the  corridor  is  much  less \nattractive.  \n\nTrade  between  the  PRC  and  Kazakhstan  is  expected  to  grow  above  the \nprojections for PRC\u2019s trade growth. This is due to high yield development plans \nfor  industry  in  western  PRC.  However,  freight  attracted  by  the  corridor  is \ndependent  mainly  on  competition  from  the  (less  quality)  railway  network. \nImproving  the  border  crossing  process  and  implementing  the  Free  Trade  Zone \nmay  increase  the  market  share  of  roads  versus  trains  for  small  distance \nconsumer goods freight shipment (i.e., Almaty). \n\nTrade  between  the  Russian  Federation  and  Kazakhstan  is  expected  to  grow \nsubstantially.  However,  the  majority  of  the  trade  is  energy  and  raw  materials, \nwhich the corridor will not attract. This is due to the development plans of natural \ngas  and  oil  pipelines.  Because  of  this  and  the  fact  that  the  Russian  Federation \ntrades less of other types of cargo, it is expected that the level of freight flows by \nroads in general and through the corridor will not increase. For most of the freight \nthat  will  be  transferred  via  road  between  these  two  countries,  there  is  little \nsubstitution  to  the  corridor  because  of  its  superiority  in  connecting  the  most \npopulated  and  industrial  regions  of  the  country.  Obviously,  freight  from  the \nAstana region will not utilize the corridor.  \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n(v) \n\nThe  low  level  of  trade  between  the  Russian  Federation  and  Central  Asian \ncountries\u2014over 80% of which is by rail\u2014is not expected to change. The freight \nincludes commodities generally transported via railways. The anticipated share of \nthe corridor is insignificant.  \n\n \nB. \n\nTransport Mode Competition \n\n3.  \nThe competition between road and rail in a number of major routes determines the trade \nand transport forecast in the corridor. The Trans-Siberian Railway originates in the eastern PRC \nand the eastern Russian Federation and travels through Siberia to Moscow. The Trans-Siberian \nRailway has a limited capacity (about 100 million tons per year) that primarily competes with the \nmuch longer shipping routes. The Trans-Asian Railway network has several routes that will also \ncompete with the corridor.  \n \n4.  \nThe  Trans-European  Corridor  is  a  planned  roadway  currently  being  developed  by  the \nRussian  Federation  and  international  organizations  that  will  run  along  the  two  basic  routes  of \nthe  Trans-Siberian  Railway.  The  Asian  Highway  is  another  major  road  that  has  two  primary \ncompetitive  routes.  In  addition  to  the  major  highways,  there  are  some  regional  corridors  that \ncould  compete  with  the  corridor.  Three  important  major  roads  include  Tashkent\u2013Samarkand\u2013\nAstrakhan\u2013Moscow  routes  that  run  west  and  south  before  entering  western  Kazakhstan  to \nMoscow. The Almaty\u2013Astana\u2013Ekaterinburg route is competitive for traffic to certain locations in \nthe Russian Federation, but it would primarily affect traffic originating in Kazakhstan. In addition, \nthis  route  is  less  attractive  than  the  corridor  because  of  distance  and  weather  condition.  The \nUrumqi\u2013Maikapchagay\u2013Omsk  route  connecting  Urumqi  to  the  Trans-European  Corridor  is \ncurrently in a pre-feasibility phase. This road is not expected to attract market share because of \nthe different potential destinations and the poor weather conditions in the region. \n \n5.  \nComparison  of  generalized  costs  between  rail  and  road  among  various  origins  and \ndestinations in Table A14.1 gives a clear picture of the market segmentation. Raw material and \nlow  time  sensitive  consumer  goods  are  transported  by  the  relatively  decayed  rail  system, \nconsisting  mainly  of  the  Trans-Siberian  and  Trans-Asian  railways;  other  types  of  cargo  are \ntransported by road.   \n \n\nTable A14.1: Cost and Time Comparison between Rail and Road  \n\nKazakhstan-\nPRC \n\nKazakhstan-\nCentral Asian \ncountries \n\nKazakhstan\u2013\nRussian \nFederation \n\nPRC\u2013Russian \nFederation \n\nAverage Travel Time (days) \n\nAverage Travel Costs ($/ton) \n\n \n\n4.5 \n\n1.9 \n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\n1.0 \n\n0.5 \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n8.5 \n\n3.2 \n\n \n\n80 \n\n \n\n11.5 \n\n4.0 \n\n \n\n240 \n\nRussian \nFederation\u2013 \nCentral Asian \ncountries \n \n\n7.0 \n\n2.3 \n\n \n\n60 \n\n30 \n\n190 \n\nRoad \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource:  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications.  2007.

A  separate  external  estimation  of  private  car \ntraffic volume was also used. The base model was run for the conditions of the current situation, \nin  which  current  demand  is  used  and  the  road  network  attributes  are  set  to  represent  the \nexisting  pavement  quality  of  roads  corresponding  to  the  current  average  travel  speed  of \n50 kilometers  per  hour  (km/h).  The  model  has  produced  the  traffic  forecasts  for  the  project \ncorridor for 2020 (Table A14.3). The demand forecasts for the project corridor were considered \nfor  the  following  major  traffic  components:  inner  traffic  of  private  cars,  inner  traffic  of  freight \nvehicles, and external (export, import, and through traffic) traffic of freight vehicles. \n \n\nTable A14.3: Summary Average Traffic \n(vehicles per day) \n\nSection \nKhorgos\u2013Almaty \n\nAlmaty\u2013Shymkent \n\nShymkent\u2013Russian Federation border \n\nCars 2006 \n\nCars 2020 \n\nTrucks 2006 \n\nTrucks 2020 \n\n5,857 \n\n3,780 \n\n1,570 \n\n22,241 \n\n14,352 \n\n5,962 \n\n260 \n\n1,823 \n\n955 \n\n5,922 \n\n7,454 \n\n1,966 \n\nSource:  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications.  2007.

Astana. \n\n \n\n8.  \nGenerated traffic is additional traffic expected to occur with the project scenario, owing to \nlower transport costs and travel times after completion of the proposed road improvements. For \ninterurban road projects, reduction in vehicle operation costs is generally the main factor driving \ngenerated traffic, with reduction in travel times playing a secondary role. \n \nGenerated traffic was estimated as a percentage of normal traffic for each subproject by \n9.  \n(i)  assessing  the  percentage  reduction  in  vehicle  operating  costs  through  a  first  run  of  the \nHighway Development Model 4, and (ii) factoring a price elasticity of demand of 0.7. Generated \ntraffic is typically 10%\u201330% of normal traffic where the Investment Program is expected to bring \nsignificant  improvements  in  the  road  condition.  There  are  number  of  bypasses  on  the \nInvestment Program and diverted traffic was estimated for each of the bypasses. \n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nD. \n\nEconomic Analysis Approach \n\n10.   Economic  analysis  was  carried  out  comparing  with-  and  without-Investment  Program \nscenarios.  The  base  case  reflects  expected  conditions  in  the  absence  of  the  Investment \nProgram, with maintenance sufficient only to hold the road in its present condition. The project \ncase  involves  initial  investment  followed  by  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  but  with \nexpenditure  and  frequency  of  periodic  maintenance  economically  optimum  for  predicted  road \nconditions and traffic flows. \n \n11.  \nThe  analysis  was  conducted  by  using  the  Highway  Development  Model  4.  It  predicts \naverage  travel  speed,  pavement  roughness,  agency  costs,  and  road  user  costs.  It  also \ncalculates the economic viability of road links. All costs and benefits are expressed in mid-2007 \nprices.  \n \n12.   Economic  analysis  was  conducted  using  the  border  price  numeraire.  A  standard \nconversion  factor  for  non-tradable  goods  was  applied  to  calculate  the  economic  price  of  non-\ntradable  goods.  The  shadow  wage  rates  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  were  estimated  by \ncomparing  the  average  labor  wage  in  the  region  and  the  project  labor  wage,  taking  into \nconsideration the existing unemployment rate. The shadow wage rates for skilled and unskilled \nlabor  were  adjusted  by  using  a  standard  conversion  factor.  The  net  present  value  at  a  12% \ndiscount factor and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) were calculated to evaluate the \neconomic viability of the Investment Program. \n \n13.  \nThe  economic  costs  were  estimated  based  on  financial  costs,  including  physical \ncontingencies.  Price  escalation  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes  were \nexcluded. Financial costs were converted into economic costs using specific conversion factors \nof 0.92 for road construction and 0.80 for road maintenance.  \n \n14.   A single stage of road development for the Investment Program is envisaged. The initial \ninvestment  for  civil  works  will  be  implemented  over  a  3-year  period  from  mid-2009  to  2012.  A \nresidual value at the end of the evaluation period is estimated at 35% of the initial investment.  \n \nE. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\n15.  \nThe Investment Program\u2019s primary economic benefits are vehicle operating cost (VOC) \nsavings and travel time savings. Economic benefits to generated domestic traffic are calculated \nas  half  of  the  difference  in  unit  VOCs  in  with-  and  without-Investment  Program  scenarios \nmultiplied by generated traffic volumes, in accordance with the \u201crule of the half.\u201d1  \n \n16.   Economic benefits from travel time savings to normal and diverted traffic are calculated \nsimilarly,  as  the  difference  in  unit  travel  time  under  with-  and  without-Investment  Program \nscenarios  multiplied  by  traffic  volumes  and  the  value  of  time.  The  rule  of  the  half  applies \nsimilarly to generated traffic. \n \n17.   Accident cost savings were also taken into account in the analysis on those sections that \nare proposed to be upgraded from category II standard (2 lane road) to category I standard (4-\nlane road with median). They are expected to generate substantial benefits given the alarming \n\n                                                 \n1  Rule of the half states that the benefits of additional travel are worth half the per-trip saving to existing travelers.

Under  the  without-Investment  Program \nscenario, accident and fatality rates were based on the actual traffic accident data available in \nthe  project  area.  The  relative  reduction  in  accident  rates  arising  from  upgrading  to  dual \ncarriageway was estimated at 24% for fatality rates and 1.3% for injuries based on a previous \nstudy.2  \n \n18.  \nIn the absence of data from Kazakhstan, the values of $400,000 per fatality and $50,000 \nper  injury  accident  were  used  to  value  benefits  from  traffic  accident  savings.  These  estimates \nare  comparable  to  those  in  Romania  ($497,000/fatality  and  $59,000/injury)  and  Croatia \n($470,000/fatality and $57,000/injury). The comparison with Romania and Croatia was used to \ndemonstrate  that  the  estimates  adopted  are  likely  to  be  of  the  right  order.  Average  values  for \ndeveloped European Union economies are much higher (in excess of \u20ac1 million per fatality).3 \n \nF. \n\nFindings \n\n19.  \nThe analysis resulted in an overall EIRR of 18% showing that the Investment Program is \neconomically  viable.  Project  1  (sections  3  and  6)  was  found  to  achieve  a  combined  EIRR  of \n28.1%. They are economically justified and provide relatively high returns compared with other \nsections.

A  sensitivity  test  was  carried  out  to  assess  the  impact  of  different  benefit  and  cost \nattributes. Under the worst case scenario, with traffic less 25% and construction costs increased \nby  25%,  the  sensitivity  test  demonstrated  that  Project  1  is  robust  across  the  broad  range  of \nvariations  in  these  key  parameters,  with  EIRR  of  about  20%  (Table  A14.5).  Moreover,  the \ncombined  effect  of  excluding  generated  traffic  and  ignoring  accident  savings  resulted  in  an \nEIRR of about 26% (Table A14.5). \n \n\n                                                 \n2  Hopkin, J.M. and D.M.

Another sensitivity test was performed to examine the effect of delaying implementation \nof Project 1 to 5 years. The EIRR  was slightly reduced from 28% to 27%. This suggests that, \ndespite the effect of reducing the discounted construction costs by deferring construction over \n5 years, the overall effect is negative\u2014with reduced net present value and rates of return for all \nsensitivity  tests.  This  is  because  the  loss  of  VOC  and  travel  time  savings  outweighs  the \ndiscounted construction  cost  savings.  This  is  particularly  the  case  with  section  6, which  under \nthe main case is constructed in advance of section 5. In the case of deferred construction, the \ntraffic  is  diverted  away  from  section  6  immediately  after  opening,  whereas  in  the  base  case, \nthere  are  significant  benefits  prior  to  traffic  being  diverted  away  to  the  bypass.  Nonetheless, \nthese  sensitivity  tests  further  demonstrate  that  the  results  for  Project  1  are  robust  across  the \nbroad range of variations in these key parameters. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n67 \n\nSUMMARY MACROECONOMIC IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n\n \nA. \n\nEconomy and Trade \n\nKazakhstan\u2019s  economy  has  grown  rapidly  because  of  increased  prices  on  its  leading \n1.  \nexports such as oil, metals, and grain. The key economic indicators are in Table A15.1. Gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  has  increased  by  about  10.6%  annually  since  2001.1 Kazakhstan\u2019s \nGDP reached about $104 billion in 2007, almost double from 2005. It is projected that the GDP \nwill grow annually by 5% in 2008 and nearly 8% in 2013.2 \n \n2.  \nKazakhstan makes a significant investment in infrastructure to reduce the infrastructure \nbottleneck. However, the process has only been partially successful since on average transport \ncosts  are  still  10%3 of  the  total  cargo  value,  compared  to  less  than  4.0\u20134.5%  in  developed \ncountries.  Despite  the  high  costs,  growth  of  the  overall  domestic  transit  volume  (in  tons)  has \nbeen strong, with annual growth of about 10%.  \n \nThe majority of trade in the region runs from east to west through Kazakhstan. Hence, to \n3.  \nexplore  the  corridor's  potential  requires  an  understanding  of  the  cargo  types,  major  partners, \nand  transportation  modes.  Kazakhstan's  largest  trade  partners  are  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nChina, Europe, and the Russian Federation (Table A15.1). Smaller countries in the region, such \nas Uzbekistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, comprise only a relatively small amount in trade value, \ndespite contributing significantly in trade volumes (tons).  \n \n\nTable A15.1: Kazakhstan's Main Trading Partners, 2006 \n(\u20ac billion) \n\nItem \nEuropean Union \nRussian Federation \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of \nTurkey \nUnited States \nOthers \n \nSource:  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications.  2007.

This  includes  the  impact  of  direct  expenditures  and  the  usual  direct  assessment \nvariables, such as VOCs and other direct benefits to users of the infrastructure. Direct benefits \nare  essential  to  understanding  the  local  returns  to  infrastructure,  but  they  fail  to  capture \nextensive  linkage  effects  across  supply  and  expenditure  chains.  Moreover,  the  reduction  in \ntransport cost expands the physical horizon of profitability for all transport services, and can be \nexpected to increase capacity use across a wide spectrum of activities. This not only increases \nthe road use, but also integrates the national and regional economy, increases product variety, \nand  sharpens  comparative  advantage.  These  will  increase  trade  and  unit  profitability  by \nrealizing economies of scale. \n \nThe second policy scenario measures the contribution of trade and transport productivity \n6.  \ngrowth as distribution sectors experience lower costs and pass these gains on to all their client \nsectors. The result is more transport-intensive growth for the economy at the national, regional, \nand  global  levels.  Because  distribution  services  are  essential  to  market  access,  rising \nproductivity in the sector accelerates trade for all other sectors, conferring growth leverage from \ntransport services to the rest of the economy. \n \n7.  \nThe  third  scenario  component  captures  the  benefit  of  reduced  delays,  product  losses, \nand  depreciation  on  transport-related  products.  For  perishable  products  like  agriculture,  such \nlosses can be prohibitive, and reducing them significantly can dramatically increase rural market \nparticipation. For other commodities, even nonperishables, delays still induce economic losses \nbecause they increase inventory and storage costs.  \n \n8.  \nThe fourth and final scenario component is to show the effect of falling trade, transport, \nand transit margins\u2014both domestically and across Kazakhstan\u2019s borders. In the Central Asian \ncountries, transport margins can be very high, and in some cases exceed 100% because of low \nquality roads, border delays, and other soft and hard infrastructure obstacles. Corridors like the \none  being  evaluated  can  dramatically  reduce  these  costs,  increasing  the  profitable  scope  of \ntrade as well as its intensity.  \n \nTable  A15.2  summarizes  the  key  estimates  of  impact  indicators.  When  all  direct  and \n9.  \nindirect impacts are taken into account (the all-inclusive trade scenario), completing the overall \ncorridor  would  lead  to  68%  higher  real  GDP  for  Kazakhstan  by  2020  compared  to  2010 \nbaseline.  These  results  are  a  testament  to  the  pervasive  contributions  of  infrastructure  as  an \neconomic growth catalyst, and reach far beyond the direct financial effects. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 15 \n\n69 \n\nTable A15.2: Key Project Impact Indicators \n(annual percentage change from 2010 baseline) \n\nImpact Indicators \nGDP \nOutputs \n \nExports \nImports \n\nGDP \n\nExports \n\nImports \n\nSubject \n\nKazakhstan \nTransport \nDistribution \nTotal \nTotal \nOther Central Asian countries\nRussian Federation \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of \nEU  \nOther Central Asian countries\nRussian Federation \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of \nEU \nOther Central Asian countries\nRussian Federation \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of \nEU \n\n2020 \n68 \n79 \n77 \n32 \n33 \n43 \n4 \n6 \n4 \n50 \n25 \n36 \n28 \n48 \n27 \n37 \n30 \n\nEU = European Union, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2007.

As expected, because of the proximities and the initial conditions of \nthe countries (i.e., relatively low income), the main beneficiaries of the corridor investment are \nKazakhstan  and  closer  regional  neighbors.  It  is  important  to  recognize  the  stakes  that  all \nKazakhstan\u2019s trading partners have in regional infrastructure. While percentage effects vary with \nproximity, the nominal effects depend on the volume of trade and size of trading partners. Thus, \nthe  economies  of  the  European  Union  capture  significant  benefits  from  the  improved  corridor \nbecause  of  their  strong  ties  to  the  region.  Significant  growth  accrues  to  larger  economies, \nsuggesting a broader basis for financing and policy support. \n\n \n\n11.  \nThe growth benefits of the corridor investment indicate how real GDP increases showing \nthe  importance  of  the  indirect  effects.  Direct  effects  are  nonexistent  for  Kazakhstan\u2019s  trading \npartners because the corridor investment is in the territory of Kazakhstan, yet they benefit quite \nsignificantly  from  linkages  of  their  economies  through  the  corridor  (Figure  A15.2).  Even  in \nKazakhstan, which captures all direct benefits, the indirect effects are about 10 times greater as \nthe  efficiency  benefits  of  improved  transport  spread  across  all  market-related  activities  in  the \neconomy.  Indeed,  higher  productivity  from  transport  and  distribution  services  constitutes  the \nlargest component of induced growth. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nFigure A15.1: GDP Growth in Nominal Value \n($ million compared to 2010 baseline)\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\ni\n\n \n\nm\nu\nm\ne\nr\nP\nh\nw\no\nr\nG\nP\nD\nG\n\nt\n\n \n\n \nl\n\na\ne\nR\n\n \nl\na\nu\nn\nn\nA\n \ne\ng\na\nr\ne\nv\nA\n\n)\nt\n\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\np\n(\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n\n \n\nKazakhstan\n\nOther Central\nAsian countries\n\nChina, People's\nRepublic of\n\nRussian\nFederation\n\nEU\n\nEU = European Union, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2007.

The  output  variable  measures  the  total  value  of  transport  and  distribution \nservices  provided,  while  imports  and  exports  measure  the  value  of  these  services provided  to \nand from foreign markets, respectively. For example, without the corridor investment, the output \nof the transport and distribution sectors rises from $56,333 million to $76,664 million from 2010 \nto 2020. With the corridor investment, the latter figure is nearly double at $137,560. \n \n\nTable A15.3: Trade and Transport Sector Growth \n($ million) \n\n2020 \n\n \n\nItem \n\n \n\n2010 \n\nWithout Corridor \nInvestment \n76,664 \n5,429 \n2,076 \n\nWith Corridor \nInvestment \n137,560 \n8,857 \n2,546 \n\n53,333 \n3,873 \n1,481 \n\nOutput \nExports \nImports \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank.  2007.

More specifically, direct benefits are small compared to \nthe productivity, efficiency, and trade stimulus effects. Productivity gains are the largest source \nof  growth  benefits,  but  reduced  losses  and  trade  stimulus  are  of  nearly  equal  benefit.  Trade \nbenefits help the overall economies, and extend far beyond the borders of Kazakhstan to large \nbut distant trading partners such as the European Union and the US.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Kazakhstan/CAREC Transport Corridor I (Zhambyl Oblast Section) [Western Europe\u2013Western \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China International Transit Corridor] Investment Program \n\n \n\nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nMultitranche Financing Facility \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nCentral and West Asia Department/ \nInfrastructure Division \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\ninfrastructure, \n\ntransport  development(s) \n\nthat  improve  and  maintain  existing \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThis poverty and social analysis relates to part of the Western Europe\u2013Western PRC International Transport Corridor \nin Zhambyl Oblast, the main artery through the oblast. The highway is to be upgraded under the Investment Program. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Islamic Development Bank \nwill  cover  the  whole  oblast,  about  480  kilometers  (km).  The  Investment  Program  is  part  of  the  2,715  km  of  the \ncorridor, which extends from the People\u2019s Republic of China border at Khorgos to the Russian Federation border at \nSyrym. The Kazakhstan budget, World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the private \nsector are financing other parts of the corridor.   \n \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  creating  enabling  conditions  for  diversification  and  increased  competitiveness  of \nnon-oil sectors; promotion of human development; and promotion of good governance. Joint efforts to promote \u201cpro-\npoor  growth  will  seek  to  maximize  horizontal  and  vertical  linkages  of  the  productive  sectors,  increase  employment, \nharness rural-urban synergies at the intra- and inter-oblast levels, and promote domestic and foreign trade.1 To that \nend, transport development is one of the six topics for dialogue and intervention included in ADB\u2019s strategy, focusing \non  \u201csupporting  road \nfacilitate \nimprovements to transport services through support for intermodal development and creation of competitive transport \nmarkets\u201d. As part of the large support for the whole corridor from international financial institutions, the development \nof this corridor will also help \u201censure greater regional economic linkages by improving regional trade links\u201d. \n \nThe key challenge to sustainable poverty reduction is the limited economic and job opportunities largely caused by \nthe  narrow  productive  base  in  the  non-oil  sectors,  especially  in  rural  areas.  The  situation  is  exacerbated  by \nenvironmental  degradation  and  deteriorating  support  infrastructure.  The  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  efforts  in  pro-poor \ngrowth will seek to maximize horizontal and vertical linkages of the productive sectors, increase employment, harness \nrural-urban synergies at the intra- and inter-oblast levels, and promote domestic and foreign trade.  \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2006\u20132008)  for  Kazakhstan, \nwhich  includes  support  in  the  transport  sector  focusing  on  national  networks  that  are  critical  links  in  the  regional \nnetwork.  It  is  also  consistent  with  the  agreement,  where  support  to  road  transport  development  is  one  of  the  main \nfocuses of the medium-term strategy. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                      Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nA brief social analysis was prepared for the feasibility study of the whole corridor undertaken in 2007 by the Ministry \nof  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC).  The  work  provided  some  background  data  for  this  poverty  and  social \nanalysis, supplemented by field visits and other different published materials. \n \nThe Investment Program will provide support to road transport in Kazakhstan. The Investment Program will contribute \nto  sustainable  economic  growth  by  fostering  physical  infrastructure  and  development,  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment,  and  regional  cooperation.  The  Investment  Program  does  not  have  a  direct  poverty  reduction  impact \nand  is  hence  classified  as  general  intervention.  Consequently,  the  Investment  Program  design  need  not  include  a \npoverty reduction assessment and strategy.  \n \nNo  stakeholders  are  expected  to  experience  long-term  negative  impacts  because  of  the  investment.  The  impact  of \nshort-term  disruptions  and  detours  can  be  minimized  through  a  carefully  designed  and  implemented  public \ninformation strategy that keeps people informed about the location, duration, and consequences of such disruptions; \nand  thereby  enable  them  to  schedule  their  activities  to  avoid  bottlenecks  and  delays.  The  Investment  Program  is \nexpected to generate considerable local employment, particularly unskilled labor during construction.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n \n\n73\n\n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nZhambyl Oblast is considered one of the less developed parts of Kazakhstan. Population is centered along the rivers \nand  near  the  foothills;  the  northern  area  is  desert.  This  is  principally  a  region  of  irrigated  agriculture\u2014vegetables, \nwine, cotton, sugar beet, and rice. Agriculture spurred intensive development of the food and light industries. There \nare also phosphate mining, metallurgy, mechanical engineering, oil production, and refinery industries2 in the oblast \nas well. \n \nZhambyl  Oblast  covers  144,300  km2.  The  oblast  center  is  Taraz,  once  a  main  stop  on  the  Silk  Road,  with  the \npopulation of 336,100 (34% of the total oblast population). There are 10 raions (districts), 12 urban settlements, and \n367 villages  in  the  oblast.  Most  of  the  villages  and  urban  settlements  were  constructed  as  part  of  the  state  and \ncollective farm structure. Statistically, Zhambyl oblast has an employment level of 90% (448,000),  which is close to \nthe national average employment of 92%. \n \nUnemployment  rates  vary  significantly\u2014as  much  as  9.5%\u2014from  one  raion  to  another.  The  highest  unemployment \nrates  are  in  the  town  of  Taraz  (14.3%),  Mojynkum  raion  (13.2%),  and  Turara  Ryskulova  raion  (11.7%).  The  lowest \nunemployment  rates  are  in  Sarysuy  (4.8%),  Korday  (5.0%),  and  Shu  (6.8%)  raion.  In  2004,  18.3%  of  the  Zhambyl \npopulation  was  below  the  minimum  subsistence  level,  14.6%  in  urban  areas  and  21.2%  in  rural  areas.  Household \nexpenditures averaged 46% for food, 31% for nonfood items, and 23% for services.5 Monthly average wages in the \noblast region are 66% of the national average, and household consumption is 71% of the national average.3 \n \nProject 1 includes two distinct types of terrain and settlement. Section 3 (Km 404 \u2013 483) goes east from Taraz, the \noblast center and a former stop on the Silk Road, passing through a desert area with little inhabitation and wide vistas \nof the mountains to the south and the steppes to the north. The terrain is flat and occasionally rolling segment of the \nroad near Taraz has a double carriageway; the remainder is a two-lane road. There are no visible encroachments on \nthe  right  of  way  (ROW)  and  the  road  traverses  few  villages.  In  contrast,  section  6  (Km  214  \u2013  260)  is  in  a  more \ndensely populated area and characterized by more intensive and varied agriculture. Compared to section 3, section 6 \nhas  large  tracts  lined  with  trees  that  were  undoubtedly  planted  as  windbreak.  The  terrain  is  flat  and  the  road  is \nstraight, with gentle curves as it winds through the countryside.  \n \nProject  1  will  transform  the  segment  into  a  category  1  highway  staying  within  the  existing  ROW,  with  little  visible \nimpact.  Reconstruction  of  section  3  will  not  change  local  transportation  access  or  traffic  patterns,  although  it  is \nexpected  to  increase  transit  traffic  significantly  once  work  on  the  whole  corridor  is  completed.  Small  villages  are \nfrequent in section 6, especially compared to section 3, all of which are typical of collective and state farm settlements \nin southern Kazakhstan. Also consistent with other areas, village settlements respect the highway ROWs and there \nare no visible signs of encroachment by permanent structures. The reconstruction in section 6 will leave the road as a \ncategory  2  highway,  fully  within  the  existing  ROW,  so  there  should  be  no  need  for  permanent  land  acquisition  or \nrelocation  on  temporary  structures.  Highway  improvement  will  not  materially  change  local  transportation  access  or \ntraffic patterns. \n \nThe investment does not raise any social issues that require additional investigation prior to program implementation. \nThe challenges and opportunities are clear and simple, and no new social risks are likely to emerge. Consequently, \nrather  than  recommend  more  in-depth  analysis  during  program  preparation,  this  poverty  and  social  analysis \nrecommends  that  a  social  assessment  be  undertaken  and  used  for  three  purposes:  (i)  inform  people  about  the \nInvestment Program and expected schedule, (ii) identify local concerns that have not emerged, and (iii) establish a \nsocioeconomic baseline for eventual use in program monitoring and impact evaluation.   \n \nHighway construction and the development of long-term transit routes have promoted the transmission and spread of \nHIV  in  many  areas.  In  Kazakhstan  overall,  the  HIV  infection  rate  of  women  is  increasing  and  the  prevalence  of \ninfection  among  drug  users  is  declining,4  suggesting  that  attention  should  be  given  to  transit  routes  as  points  of \ntransmission.  The  Investment  Program  will  conduct  public  information  on  HIV  transmission  and  initiate  a  needle \nexchange program at one site. The Investment Program is not likely to affect current trafficking patterns materially, as \nthe  investments  will  not  remove  any  significant  transit  barriers.  However,  once  work  on  the  full  corridor  including \nZhambyl  Oblast  is  completed.  ,  the  improved  corridor  may  be  seen  by  both  human  and  drug  traffickers  as  an \nattractive alternative to the prevailing south\u2013north route.   \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultation  was  conducted  with  stakeholders,  including  the  local  population  and  the  Oblast  Administration  of  the \nCommittee of Roads.

Gender and Development \n \n1.  Key Issues \n \nThe  Investment  Program  is  not  expected  to  exacerbate  gender  inequities.  It  does  offer  the  possibility  of  increasing \nfemale  participation  in  the  paid  labor  force.  Employment  opportunities  are  to  be  expected  along  much  of  the \nalignment  in  sections  3  and  6,  although  female  participation  may  be  limited  where  worker  camps  are  established, \nunless the contractors make special provisions available to attract women to the sites. \n \n \n2.

ADB \nfinancing will be through a multitranche financial facility (MFF). The Investment Program will be \ndivided  in  three  tranches,  each  entailing  projects  aiming  at  the  construction,  improvement,  or \nrehabilitation of one or more legs of the Zhambyl Oblast Section of the Western China\u2013Western \nEurope  Transportation  Corridor  Highway.  Other  sections  of  the  highway  will  be  financed  by \nEuropean  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  World  Bank,  private  sector,  and  the \nGovernment.. \n \nAppraisal has been undertaken for the first MFF tranche, which does not include projects \n2.  \nwith  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  and  thus  does  not  require  the  preparation  and \nimplementation of LAR plans (LARPs). The subsequent tranches, however, will include projects \nwith  LAR,  for  which  the  preparation/implementation  of  LARPs  will  be  necessary.  Based  on \nADB\u2019s  processing  requirement  for  MFFs,  MOTC  prepared  a  LAR  framework  (LARF)  reflecting \nKazakhstan\u2019s law, ADB\u2019s processing mechanisms, and shared compensation and rehabilitation \nprovisions mandated by the relevant policies of the four concerned IFIs.1    \n \nB. \n\nGeneral Procedures \n\nThe MFF/each tranche appraisal will require the preparation of the following documents:  \n\na  LARF  for  the  whole  MFF  to  be  reviewed,  updated,  and  reapproved  by  ADB \nannually and before the preparation of each tranche; \nan  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  for  each  tranche  indicating  whether \nLARP impacts are expected, and if so their type and magnitude; and \nLARPs  for  each  project  with  detailed  design/impact  figures  and  compensation \nbudgets and schedules.2 \n\nThe appraisal of the MFF and of each project and the approval/implementation of each \n\n4.  \nproject under a tranche will have to meet the following LAR-related conditions. \n \n\nMFF/tranche  1  appraisal:  preparation  of  LARF  for  the  MFF  and  LARPs  for  all \nprojects with LAR impacts;3  \nsubsequent tranche appraisals: LARF review/update and preparation of LARP for \nall projects with LAR impacts; and \nstart of project civil works: full LARP implementation. \n\n                                                 \n1  In accordance with ADB, processing mechanisms and compensation/rehabilitation provisions are based on ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  the  LARF,  and  ADB.  2003.  Operations  Manual.  Section  F2:  Involuntary \nResettlement. Manila. \n\n2  ADB.  2006.  Operations  Manual.  Section  F2/OP:  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  Section  BP  Involuntary \nResettlement.  Manila,  a  resettlement  plan\u2019s  complexity  rests  on  impact  severity.  If  impacts  are  severe  (>  200 \npeople  resettled  or  with  >10%  income  losses),  a  project  is  classified  category  A  and  a  full  LARP  is  prepared.  If \nimpacts are not severe (<200 people resettled or with <10% income losses), a project is classified category B and \nonly a short LARP is prepared. \n\n3  A LARF has been prepared for the MFF. LARPs are not required for tranche 1. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n3.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n77\n\nC. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement Framework \n\n5.  \nThe Government has agreed to apply the following principles in the acquisition of private \nland and resettlement of households for investments on the corridor, which reflect the principles \nincorporated  in  the  resettlement  policies  of  ADB  and  the  other  IFIs.  The  principles  apply  to \ntemporary  or  permanent  impacts  resulting  from  loss  of  land,  structures,  or  other  fixed  assets; \nchanges  in  land  use  or  business;  and  restrictions  on  the  use  of  land,  housing,  or  businesses. \nThe principles apply to affected persons experiencing impacts caused by LAR for state needs.   \n \n6.  \nimplementing the investments: \n \n\nThe  policies  have  a  number  of  principles  that  must  be  adhered  to  in  designing  and \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nAvoid or minimize LAR. \nAffected persons are entitled to be compensated at full replacement cost for their \nlost  assets,  incomes,  and  businesses,  including  temporary  losses  or  impacts, \nwithout adjustments for depreciation. \nCompensation  should  enable  affected  persons  to  restore  their  pre-project \nincomes and standard of living by the end of the project. \nAffected persons must be consulted and participate in resettlement planning. \nAffected persons must be fully informed of their compensation options. \nLand-for-land swap is the preferred compensation for lost agricultural land, if it is \navailable, unless the affected person chooses cash compensation. \n\n(vii)  Costs  of  transfer  of  property\u2014purchase  or  swap\u2014are  waived  or  borne  by  the \n\n(x) \n\ninvestor, including taxes, fees, documentation, and court appeals. \n(viii)  Compensation will be made giving equal consideration to women and men. \n(ix) \n\nLack  of  formal  title  or  use  agreement  does  not  bar  affected  persons  from \nentitlements or assistance required to achieve the objectives of the policy. \nRelocated  affected  persons  receive  relocation  and  transition  subsistence \nallowances. \nSpecial  attention  should  be  given  to  households  headed  by  women  and  other \nvulnerable  persons,  and  appropriate  assistance  provided  to  assure  that  their \nliving standards are maintained or improved. \nLAR is executed as part of the project and fully funded. \n\n(xii) \n(xiii)  Compensation  will  be  fully  provided  before  land  is  entered  for  civil  works  or \n\n(xi) \n\ndemolition. \n\n \nEntitlements  and  Compensation.  Compensation  and  entitlements  must  assure  that \n7.  \naffected persons maintain or improve their standard of living after the project.

The Committee of Roads through a project director has \nthe overall responsibility for LAR preparation, implementation, and financing with the assistance \nof a project management consultant (PMC). At the PMC, LAR tasks will be handled by a LAR \nconsultant. The PMC will be assisted by a construction supervision team and by nongovernment \norganizations  or  impact  assessment/valuation  consultants  hired  for  impact  surveys/monitoring \nassistance.  The  PMC  will  coordinate  with  raion  governments  that  have  jurisdiction  over  land \nadministration/valuation.  \n \n9.  \nThe  LARPs  will  be  mostly  implemented  by  raion-level  officials,  with  the  support  of  the \noblast  administration,  civil  works  contractors,  and  officials  of  local  self-government.  Evaluation \nand  compensation  are  managed  by  a  raion-level  commission  established  for  the  purpose, \nincluding  staff  of  the  raion  administration  and  officials  representing  different  relevant  offices, \nsuch as agriculture, forestry, roads, land resource management, and registration.   \n \n10.   Disclosure/Public  Consultation.  The  consultation  process  begins  when  the  akimat \nnotifies  potential  affected  persons  that  their  lands  may  be  subject  to  being  reserved.  The \nvaluation  process  also  involves  direct  consultation  with  affected  persons  and  is  expected  to \nresult in satisfactory agreements. Affected persons can discuss their concerns with officials and, \nif dissatisfied, can appeal to the court for a binding valuation. \n \nThe LARF has been uploaded on the ADB website and LARPs in English will be posted \n11.  \non  the  ADB  website  after  EA  endorsement.  LARFs  and  LARPs  in  Russian  and  Kazakh \nlanguages will be disclosed on the project website, MOTC website, at the offices of the Oblast \nCommittee  of  Roads  and  respective  raion  akimats.  Finally,  a  primer  in  local  language \nsummarizing compensation provisions will be sent to all affected persons.  \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f80 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n12.   Grievance  Procedures.  All  project-related  complaints  will  be  handled  through  LAR \ngrievance  mechanisms  that  follow  the  existing  pattern  and  will  be  described  in  the  project\u2019s \ninformation  brochures  and  posted  in  local  offices:  (i)  affected  persons  take  their  complaints  to \nthe head of local self-government, who registers the complaint and attempts to resolve it. If the \ncomplaint is not resolved in 1 week, it is passed to the raion level; (ii) a designated person in the \nraion administration receives the complaint, registers it, and attempts to resolve it. If there is no \nresolution in 2 weeks, it is passed to the oblast level; and (iii) a designated person in the oblast \nadministration receives the complaint and attempts to resolve it. If there is no resolution within \n2 weeks, it is passed to project management for resolution on a priority basis.4 If again after this \nlast step, no solution is found, the affected persons can bring their case to the appropriate court \nof law.  \n \n13.   Alternatively,  persons  who  feel  that  their  grievances  are  not  given  adequate  attention \ncan  contact  project  management.  The  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer  will  acknowledge  and \nregister such complaints and seek resolution, reporting to the complainant on a weekly basis.  \n \n14.   Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  LAR  will  be  monitored  internally  and  externally.  Internal \nmonitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  the  raion  administration,  which  will  report  to  the  EA  on  a \nmonthly basis. The work will be overseen by the project management team LAR specialist.    \n \nThe Investment Program will hire an external monitoring agency, which will carry out an \n15.  \nindependent  assessment  of  the  resettlement  process  and  outcomes  to  be  submitted  every \n6 months  to  the  EA  and  ADB.  The  external  monitoring  agency  will  assess  whether \nimplementation  complies  with  provisions  of  the  resettlement  plan,  if  the  livelihoods  of  affected \npeoples have been restored, and whether or not any unintended or unanticipated resettlement \nimpacts have occurred. \n \n16.  \nevaluation activities will be included in the project budget and reflected in the LARP budget. \n \n\nFinances  and  Schedules.  The  cost  of  administrative  oversight  and  monitoring  and \n\n                                                 \n4  This procedure differs from standard practice in that each of the designated officials at the self-government, raion, \nor oblast levels will be required to register the complaints and keep track of their status, reporting monthly to project \nmanagement.  Reports  and  grievance  resolution  will  be  subject  to  follow-up  by  the  external  monitoring  and \nevaluation team, and by project management. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 October 2008) \n", "Currency Unit\nT1.00\n$1.00\n", "tenge (T) \n$0.008342 \nT119.88 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Accelerated Cofinancing Scheme with ADB \nAsian Development Bank \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nexecuting agency \nenvironmental assessment and review framework \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nEuropean Union \nframework financing agreement \nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des Ing\u00e9nieurs Conseils  \n(International Federation of Consulting Engineers) \ngross domestic product \n\u2013 \ninternational competitive bidding \n\u2013 \nIslamic Development Bank \n\u2013 \ninitial environmental examination \n\u2013 \ninternational financial institution \n\u2013 \nintelligent transport system \n\u2013 \nJapan International Cooperation Agency \n\u2013 \nland acquisition and resettlement \n\u2013 \nland acquisition and resettlement framework \n\u2013 \nland acquisition and resettlement plan \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \nLondon interbank offered rate \n\u2013  multitranche financing facility \n\u2013  Ministry of Transport and Communications \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "national competitive bidding \nordinary capital resources \nperiodic financing request \nproject management consultant \npublic\u2013private partnership \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \nRoad Development Program  \nright-of-way \nsummary initial environmental examination \nvehicle operating cost \nvehicles per day \n", " \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "ACFA \nADB \nCAREC \nEA \nEARF \nEBRD \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nEU \nFFA \nFIDIC \n", "GDP \nICB \nIDB \nIEE \nIFI \nITS \nJICA \nLAR \nLARF \nLARP \nLIBOR \nMFF \nMOTC \nNCB \nOCR \nPFR \nPMC \nPPP \nPRC \nRDP \nROW \nSIEE \nVOC \nvpd \n", " \n", "GLOSSARY \n \n", "CAREC \nTransport \nCorridor 1 \n", "Facility \n", "\u2013  Western Europe\u2013Western People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \n", "International Transit Corridor running from Khorgos at the border \nwith the PRC, through Almaty and Shymkent, to the western border \nwith the Russian Federation \n", "\u2013  Multitranche financing facility provided by ADB to the Borrower for \npurposes of financing projects under the Investment Program \n", "Investment \nProgram \noblast \n", "raion \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "\u2013 \n", "Borrower\u2019s Investment Program for the Zhambyl Oblast Section of \nthe CAREC Transport Corridor 1 \nAn administrative unit of the Borrower \n", "An administrative subdivision of the oblast \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nFY  before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends, \ne.g., FY2008 ends on 31 December 2008. \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars unless otherwise stated. \n", "Vice-President \nDirector General \nDirector \n \nTeam leader \nTeam members \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "X.
