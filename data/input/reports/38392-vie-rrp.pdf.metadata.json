Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no \nadverse environmental impacts identified. \n \nThe  program  loan  will  support  implementation  of  the  Poverty \nReduction  Program  outlined  under  the  Fourth  Poverty  Reduction \nSupport  Credit  (PRSC  4),  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  overall \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \n(CPRGS).  This  annual  PRSC  is  part  of  the  current  PRSC  cycle, \nwhich  covers  5-years,  the  same  as  the  CPRGS.  The  CPRGS \nprovides  a  medium-term  framework  (2002-2006)  for  poverty \nreduction policies, programs, and actions with specific targets for \ndevelopment outcomes by 2006. \n \nOver  the  last  decade  the  Government  has  quickly  reduced \npoverty  and  achieved  a  high  level  of  economic  growth.  Poverty \nreduction  largely  resulted  from  economic  growth,  which  created \njobs  and  provided  better  livelihoods.  To  maintain  this  trend,  the \nGovernment must continue its program of effective policy reform, \nto  remove  remaining  structural  weaknesses,  promote  socially \ninclusive  development,  and  modernize  governance  and  public \nadministration.  The \nsupports \nimplementation  of  the  CPRGS,  which  is  designed  to  reduce \npoverty  and  realize  other  Viet  Nam  Development  Goals.  As  part \nof  the  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  community,  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has adopted the CPRGS as the \nreference  document \nfor  planning  external  assistance.  The \nCPRGS  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy, \ncountry  strategy  and  program,  and  the  poverty  partnership \nagreement with Viet Nam. \n \nWorld  Bank  support  includes  four  PRSCs,  approved  in  2002 \n(US$250  million),  2003 (US$100  million),  2004 (US$100  million), \nand  2005  (US$100  million).  The  focus  of  these  operations  has \ngradually  shifted  from  reform  of  state-owned  commercial  banks \n(SOCBs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to a broader policy \nagenda,  covering  a  number  of  sectors  and  issues  affecting \npoverty reduction and growth. \n \n\nproposed \n\nprogram \n\nloan \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n \nProgram Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\nthe  PRSC  an \n\nimportant \nThe  ODA  community  considers \ninstrument  for  supporting  CPRGS  implementation.  In  2005,  10 \nmajor  ODA  partners,  namely  ADB,  Canada,  Denmark,  European \nCommission,  France,  Ireland,  Japan,  Netherlands,  Spain,  and \nUnited Kingdom, are cofinancing PRSC 4 with the World Bank. \n \nADB has been actively involved in formulating PRSC 4. ADB has \npromoted  policy  dialogue  on  similar  issues  through  its  program \nlending activities and sector policy reforms. PRSC 4 complements \nADB  support  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  As  a \nmultisector  instrument  covering  a  range  of  issues  related  to \npoverty  reduction,  the  PRSC  framework  provides  ADB  with  an \nopportunity to (i) advance and widen national policy dialogue in a \nwell-coordinated  and comprehensive  manner,  (ii)  provide  lending \nand  nonlending  assistance  in  coordination  with  other  ODA \npartners,  and  (iii)  ensure  that  key  policy  issues  affecting  ADB \noperations  in  Viet  Nam  are  addressed  in  the  policy  dialogue \nbetween  the  Government  and  the  ODA  community  to  help \nachieve the common goals of poverty reduction and growth. \n \nThe  proposed  program  loan  adheres  to  ADB\u2019s  recent  endeavors \nto  adopt  program-based  and  sector  approaches  in  its  lending \noperations to reduce transaction costs for its developing member \ncountries  as  well  as  for  its  own  operations.  The  approach  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  reform  agenda,  Long-Term  Strategic \nFramework,  and  Medium-Term  Strategy,  and  will  directly  help \nfulfill  ADB\u2019s  obligations  to  the  Rome  Declaration  on  harmonizing \nprocedures  of  multilateral  development  banks  (February  2003) \nand the recent Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (February\u2013\nMarch 2005). \n \nThe  expected  impact  of  the  proposed  program  loan  is  to  reduce \npoverty and sustain high economic growth in Viet Nam. The loan \nwill  help  fund  PRSC  4  and  thereby  produce  the  following \noutcomes:  (i)  reduced  structural  weaknesses  and  improved \nbusiness  environment,  (ii)  promotion  of  socially  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  development,  and  (iii)  modernized \ngovernance. \n \nPolicy  measures  supported  by  PRSC  operations,  such  as  the \nsafety net for redundant SOE workers, restructuring of SOCBs, or \ncreation  of  provincial  health  care  for  the  poor  require  additional \nspending.  These  are  costly  and  PRSC-specific  programs.  The \nPRSC  cost  of  adjustment  is  therefore  greater  than  the  cost  of \nthese  four  items.  The  external  financing  needs  for  the  2005 \nbudget (including grants) is estimated at US$1.4 billion, calculated \nas  financing  needs  less  revenue  carried  over  from  2004  and \ndomestic borrowing. \n \n\n\f \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\niii\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nto \n\nincreased  spending  on  education  proportional \n\nThe  estimated  cost  of  some  specific  PRSC-related  programs  for \nthe  2005  budget  is  approximately  US$770  million,  i.e.,  (i)  health \nfunds  for  the  poor\u2014about  US$90  million  due  to  expanded \ncoverage of beneficiaries according to the new poverty definition; \nthe \n(ii) \nGovernment budget\u2014about US$400 million; and (iii) social safety \nnet  program  for  retrenched  SOE  workers,  covering  more  than \n50,000  workers\u2014at  least  US$80  million;  and  (iv)  resolution  of \nnonperforming  loans  and  other  related  costs\u2014about  US$200 \nmillion.  \n \nA total of approximately US$225 million is expected to be funded \nfor PRSC 4 operations through ODA resources. The World Bank \nhas  already  approved  a  US$100  million  credit \nthe \nInternational Development Association to support PRSC 4. Three \nother  cofinanciers  will  provide  concessional  loans,  namely  ADB \nInternational  Cooperation \n(US$15  million),  Japan  Bank \n(US$22.8  million  equivalent),  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement  (\u20ac10  million).  The  remaining  seven  cofinanciers \nwill  provide  grants,  i.e.,  Agencia  Espa\u00f1ola  de  Cooperaci\u00f3n \nInternacional  (\u20ac2  million),  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency  (Can$6  million),  Denmark  (US$10.8  million  equivalent), \nEuropean  Commission \n(\u20ac1.5  million), \n(\u20ac8  million), \nNetherlands  (\u20ac8  million),  and  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for \nInternational Development (\u20a420 million). \n \n\nIreland \n\nfrom \n\nfor \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of US$15 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will \nbe provided. The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period \nand  1.5%  during  the  amortization  period,  and  such  other  terms \nand  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The  loan \nproceeds may be used to finance eligible imports incurred within \n180 days prior to the date of loan effectiveness. The loan reflects \nADB\u2019s  support  for  implementation  of  the  CPRGS  following  the \npolicy framework of the PRSC 4 program. The loan will contribute \nto financing adjustment costs resulting from implementation of the \npolicy  matrix,  particularly  prior  actions  for  PRSC  4,  and  will \nsupport and facilitate the Government\u2019s continued and deepened \nreform program for poverty reduction. \n \nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n \nThe loan will be fully utilized by 31 December 2006. \n \nThe State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) will be the Executing Agency; \nit works in close collaboration with the World Bank to prepare and \nimplement the PRSCs. \n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nDisbursement \n\n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nhas \n\nsteering \n\ncommittee \n\nchairman.  The \n\nThree  main  arrangements  have  been  made  to  implement  this \nprogram. First, the National Steering Committee was established \nin  May  2002  to  implement  the  CPRGS  and  PRSCs.  It  is  chaired \nby the deputy prime minister in charge of economic reforms, and \ncomprises  representatives  from  24  relevant  line  ministries  and \ngovernment agencies. An SBV deputy governor acts as standing \nvice \nseveral \nrepresentatives  from  key  economic  ministries,  such  as  the \nministries  of  agriculture  and  rural  development;  education  and \ntraining;  finance;  justice;  labor,  invalids,  and  social  affairs;  and \ntrade;  as  well  as  the  Office  of  the  Government;  the  Party's \nEconomic  Commission;  and  SBV;  representing  PRSC  4\u2019s  policy \nreform areas. \n \nSecond,  an  interministerial  working group  was  established in  the \nMinistry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  comprising  representatives \nfrom key ministries responsible for the policy reform areas under \nthe  PRSCs.  Its  goal  is  to  help  implement  the  CPRGS  at \nsubnational  levels.  Third,  also  established  with  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning  and  Investment  is  the  CPRGS  Secretariat,  which \nsupports  provincial  governments  in  adapting  the  CPRGS  to  their \nown  context,  and  reformulating  plans  and  budgets  accordingly. \nSBV  is  assigned  as  the  agency  responsible  for  preparing  and \nimplementing the PRSCs.  \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loans,  the  proceeds  of  the  program \nloan will be disbursed to Viet Nam as the Borrower.  \n \nNo  supporting  import  documentation  will  be  required,  if  during \neach  year  that  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the \nvalue of Viet Nam\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other \nODA is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected \nto be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its \ncompliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will \nbe  required.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan \nproceeds  and  verify \nthe  Government\u2019s \ncertification. \n \n\nthe  accuracy  of \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nv\n\n \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nthe \n\nbanking \n\nreforms, \n\nimproving \n\nforests  and \n\nThe program loan will benefit Vietnamese people and businesses \non three fronts. First, through policy actions designed to facilitate \nViet Nam\u2019s transition to a market economy, the loan will increase \nefficiency,  accelerate  economic  growth,  and  create  jobs.  These \npolicy  actions  include  preparing  for  World  Trade  Organization \naccession,  accelerating  the  divestiture  of  SOEs  and  SOCBs, \nintensifying \nbusiness \nenvironment,  and  introducing  a  regulatory  body  for  infrastructure \nthrough  policy  actions  addressing  social \nservices.  Second, \ninclusion  and  environmental  sustainability,  the  benefits  include \nimproved  quality  of  education  (especially \nin  poor  areas), \navailability  of  medicines  at  affordable  prices,  secured  asset \nownership  through  the  implementation  of  a  new  land  law,  and \nmore  sustainable  management  of \nimproved \nenvironmental  quality.  Third,  through  policy  actions  addressing \nmodern governance, the benefits are increased transparency and \naccountability of public finances, and improved legal transparency \nand accessibility. These will be achieved through, among others, \nfinancial  disclosure  of  all  state  budget  entities,  piloting  of  the \nMedium-Term  Expenditure  Framework,  and  decentralizing  public \ninvestment decisions to lower governments.  \n \nThree  potential  risks  are  associated  with  the  program  loan: \ncontainment  of  contingent \ninclusion  and \nenvironment  sustainability,  and  a  fiduciary  risk  related  to  public \nfinancial management.  \n \nFirst, the ambitious economic growth target could be a source of \npressure to expand commercial and policy loans for infrastructure \ndevelopment  especially  at  local  levels,  without  proper  appraisal. \nThe  overall  quality  of  lending  may  be  undermined  by  such \npressure,  thereby  undermining  the  banking  reform  agenda  and \nleading  to  a  build-up  of  contingent  liabilities.  This  risk  could  be \naddressed  by  enhancing  the  credibility  of  government  policies \nregarding nonperforming loans and strengthening the commercial \norientation and autonomy of SOCBs with decisive policy actions. \nThrough the PRSC process, the Government has already decided \nto  adopt  loan  classification  based  on  international  accounting \nstandards. \n \n\nliability,  social \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nthrough \n\nimprovements \n\nimplementation  are  still  needed \n\nSecond,  some  key  service  delivery  programs  are  underfunded \neven  though  policies  in  health  and  education  aim  to  target  the \npoor  and  improve  the  quality  of  service  delivery.  While  service \nproviders  were  given  incentives  to  charge  fees,  they  are  not \naccountable  to  provide  basic  services  at  a  low  or  no  fee.  To \nprotect the environment, increasingly sophisticated legislation and \nits \nto  ensure  effective \nadministrative, economic, and information tools. This risk could be \nin  data  availability  and \naddressed \nanalytical  work  on  issues  arising  from  rural-urban  disparities \nincluded  as  part  of  the  PRSC  process.  Regarding  environmental \nsustainability,  the  country  environmental  assessment  and  the \nPRSC policy actions on land, water, and environmental protection \nshould help mitigate risks. \n \nThird,  while  gains  have  been  made  in  budget  transparency  and \nexecution, the management of state assets and liabilities will need \nmuch  improvement.  Concerns  have  been  raised  regarding  the \nrapidly  emerging  and  fast-growing  provincial  investment  funds, \nwhich  suffer  limited  transparency  and  accountability.  While  the \nGovernment is working toward effective anticorruption measures, \na  rapidly  growing  economy  and  the  opportunities  for  graft  could \noutpace  improvements  and  efforts  in  anticorruption  policies.  This \nrisk  could  be  addressed  by  initiatives  that  provide  effective \ncounter  mechanisms.  A  comprehensive  diagnostic  of  corruption \nand  its  modality  will  be  finalized  and  publicly  disclosed.  An \nanticorruption  law,  to  be  passed  by  the  National  Assembly  in \nNovember \naccountability \nintroduce \nrequirements  for  heads  of  agencies,  monitoring  of  assets  of \nsenior government officials and their families, and introduction of \na  more  effective  whistle-blowing  mechanism.  The  Government \nhas  also  encouraged  the  media  to  apply  a  more  proactive \napproach in detecting and reporting corruption.  \n \nThe  Government  is  aware  of  the  potential  risks.  Through \nappropriate  measures  and  proactive  programs  during  program \nimplementation, the Government will take into consideration risk-\nmitigating  measures.  ADB  along  with  other  PRSC  cofinanciers \nhave  provided  technical  assistance  and  conducted  analytical \nstudies to help policymakers formulate and execute mitigating and \ncorrective measures in anticipation of these potential risks. \n\n2005,  will \n\nstronger \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  to  Support  the  Implementation  of  the  Poverty  Reduction \nProgram  II.  The  loan  follows  a  program-based  approach  and  is  part  of  the  Fourth  Poverty \nReduction  Support  Credit  (PRSC  4),  jointly  processed  by  several  development  partners,  in \nsupport  of  the  Government\u2019s  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \n(CPRGS).1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nThe Government is committed to poverty reduction. Poverty reduction is an overarching \n2. \nobjective  in  its  national  socioeconomic  development  process  and  is  addressed  in  the  2002 \nPoverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement2  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  a \nseries  of  strategic  plans  and  documents,  including  the  CPRGS,  the  5-Year  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Plan  (SEDP)  (2001-2005),3  and  the  10-Year  Socioeconomic  Development \nStrategy  (2001-2010).4  The  CPRGS  is  unique  and  widely  recognized  as  a  blueprint  for \ndevelopment.  Based  on  empirical  analysis  and  broad  consultation, \nidentifies  clear \ndevelopment  goals,  specifies  policies  to  attain  the  goals,  and  aligns  public  resources  to \nimplement these policies.     \n \nA. \n\nDevelopment Objectives, Strategies, and Plans \n\nit \n\nViet  Nam\u2019s  development  strategy  is  embodied  in  the  CPRGS.  The  CPRGS  embraces \n3. \nthree  broad  pillars:  Pillar  I\u2014High  growth  through  the  transition  to  a  market  economy,  which \nrequires  implementation  of  an  ambitious structural  reform  agenda;  Pillar  II\u2014Equitable,  socially \ninclusive, and environmentally sustainable growth, which requires appropriate sector and social \npolicies and programs; and Pillar III\u2014Adoption of a modern public administration, and legal and \ngovernance  system,  which  is  essential  for  the  first  two  goals  to  be  attainable.  The  CPRGS \npillars  are  intertwined  with  crosscutting  themes  such  as  employment  generation  for  poverty \nreduction,  and  the  link  between  public  financial  management  and  effective  delivery  of  social \nservices to the poor. Details on the CPRGS are given in Appendix 2.  \n \n4. \nThe Government is currently preparing a new 5-year SEDP (2006\u20132010), to be issued in \n2006.  The  new  SEDP  is  expected  to  provide  Viet  Nam\u2019s  new  national  strategy  for  poverty \nreduction and growth, incorporating the fundamentals of the CPRGS, 2002 development goals, \nand Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement with ADB. The SEDP has a target of 7.5\u20138.0% \nannual  average  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth,  elimination  of  hunger  by  2010,  and \nhalving  of  poverty  from  29%  in  2002.  In  response  to  public  health  scares,  the  Government  is \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired \ncontrolling  public  health  outbreaks, \nimmunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  and  avian  influenza,  with  special  strategies  and \nprograms supported by official development assistance (ODA) partners.   \n \n\nincluding  human \n\n                                                 \n1  Inter-Ministerial Group of the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. 2002.

During  2003-\n5. \n2004,  the  National  Assembly  approved,  among  others,  laws  on  land,  bankruptcy,  competition, \nand  electricity.  In  2005,  it  passed  15  laws  in  the  first  session,  and  plans  to  consider  14  other \nlaws  for  approval,  including  a  law  on  anticorruption  and  unified  laws  on  enterprises  and \ninvestments.  In  addition,  the  Civil  Code  amendment  is  expected  to  be  approved  in  2005.  The \ncode  will  clarify  rights  and  obligations  of  citizens,  and  facilitate  private  sector  transactions.  In \nApril  2005,  the  Government  hosted  the  Sixth  Steering  Committee  meeting  of  the  ADB\u2013\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development Anticorruption Initiative in Hanoi. It is \nimplementing  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  Free  Trade  Agreement;  and  it  has \nbeen  active  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Economic  Cooperation  Program  activities  with \nPrime Minister Phan Van Khai participating in the second Greater Mekong Subregion Leaders \nSummit  in  Kunming  in  July  2005.  Viet  Nam  has  advanced  negotiations  for  its  planned  World \nTrade  Organization  (WTO)  accession  at  the  end  of  2005.  It  is  also  actively  pursuing \nimplementation  of  the  Development  Assistance  Committee  (Organization  for  Economic \nCooperation  and  Development)  Paris  Declaration  2005.  Preparations  for  holding  the  10th \nNational Party congress in the first quarter of 2006 are under way.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nIn  the  past  decade,  Viet  Nam  has  experienced  both  high  economic  growth  and \nimpressive poverty reduction. This trend continues in spite of recent adverse shocks, including \nan  outbreak  of  avian  influenza;  severe  flood  and  droughts;  a  sharp  rise  in  key  imported \ncommodity prices; and the introduction of market barriers in textile, garments, and other export \nproducts.  In  spite  of  those  adverse  conditions,  GDP  has  grown  by  more  than  7%  for  the  third \nconsecutive year (Table 1). The strong economic performance reflects the increasing strength \nand buoyancy of the private sector, as evident in buoyant private consumption and investment, \nand  fast  export  growth.  While  the  number  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  is  steadily \ndeclining,  an  additional  35,000  new  businesses  were  registered  in  2004,  representing  a  year-\non-year  increase  of  26%  in  number  and  24%  in  registered  capital.  Private  sector  industrial \nproduction rose 23% in 2004, compared with 12% for the state sector. Foreign direct investment \ncommitments reached a 7-year high of US$4.2 billion in 2004, or nearly 10% of GDP. Overall, \nhelped by high oil prices, exports grew by 29%, reaching 57% of GDP. Being a net oil exporter, \nViet  Nam  has  benefited  from  high  crude  oil  prices  in  the  past  couple  of  years.  With  its  stable \npolitical  regime  and  robust  macroeconomic  fundamentals,  Viet  Nam  has  been  among  the \nworld\u2019s  fastest  growing  economies  in  recent  years.  Along  with  the  broad-based  growth,  the \nVietnamese  population  has  enjoyed  widespread  improved  living  conditions.  Results  from  the \n2004 Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey indicate that the number of people living in \npoverty  has  substantially  declined  since  the  2002  survey.  While  a  poverty  rate  cannot  yet  be \nreported  with  confidence,  sustained  progress  toward  the  attainment  of  the  Viet  Nam \nDevelopment Goals (VDGs) and other key development outcomes is expected.  \n \n7. \nThe  sectors  that  contributed  most  to  overall  economic  growth  were  industry  and \nservices,  together  accounting  for  nearly  80%  of  GDP.  Industry  expanded  by  10.2%  and  the \nservices sectors by 7.4%, while agriculture grew at 2.8%, marking the slowest growing sector. \nThe  consumer  price  index  rose  by  9.5%  in  December  2004  and  annual  average  inflation  was \nestimated  at  7.7%,  up  from  3.2%  in  2003.  Broad  money  supply  rose  by  28%  in  2004.  Credit \ngrowth  also  accelerated  to  42%  in  2004,  mainly  after  the  inflationary  peak.  The  credit  growth \nraised concerns over the quality of lending. Since then, the Government has taken measures, \nincluding  raising  the  reserve  ratio  and  discount  rate  on  refinancing  of  commercial  banks,  to \nreduce the credit growth rate in 2005 to 25-30%. The fiscal deficit, estimated at 3.8% of GDP, is \nbelow the Government\u2019s target of 5.0%. GDP growth is projected at around 7.6% for 2005, 7.6% \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3  \n\n \n\nin  2006,  and  7.5%  in  2007,  supported  by  strong  domestic  demand  and  export  growth.5  The \nfiscal position is expected to remain expansionary but manageable to cover the cost of reforms \nand infrastructure. Inflation (average for the period) will likely moderate to 6% in 2005 and 5.2% \nin 2006.  \n \n\nTable 1: Major Economic Indicators, 2002\u20132006  \n(%) \n \n\n \n2002 \n\n \n2003 \n\n \n2004 \n\n \n2005 \n\n \n2006 \n\nItem \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP growth \nGross domestic investment/GDP \nInflation rate (average for the year)\nMoney supply (M2) growth \nFiscal balance/GDP \nMerchandise export growth \nMerchandise import growth \n \nCurrent account balance/GDP \nDebt service ratio \nGDP = gross national product. \nSources: Asian Development Bank. 2005.

The  achievements  should  be  seen  in  the  context  of  the  experience  of \nsome  other  transition  economies  where  poverty  reduced  and  social  indicators  deteriorated  in \nthe  initial  stage  of  transition.  Viet  Nam  halved  poverty  in  about  10  years.  The  poverty  rate \ndropped from 58.1% in 1993 to 37.4% in 1998, 28.9% in 2002, and 24.1% in 2004. However, \nthe  rate  of  poverty  reduction  slowed  in  recent  years,  i.e.,  4.8  percentage  points  during  2002\u2013\n2004  compared  with  9  percentage  points  during  1998\u20132002.6  Poverty  reduction  is  slow  or \nunchanged  in  the  northern  mountains  and  in  pockets  of  the  Red  River  delta  region  and  north \ncoastal  region,  contributing  to  regional  disparities.  The  VDGs  show  a  steady  improvement  in \nsocial  indicators,  such  as  school  enrollment  and  infant  mortality,  and  improvements  in  other \nhuman development indicators. Viet Nam ranks 112th of 177 countries in terms  of the human \ndevelopment index, i.e., 0.691 in 2004,7 which is much lower than other countries in the region, \nbut ranks much higher at 41 in terms of the human poverty index.  \n \n\n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

With  US$600  annual  per  capita  income,  Viet \nNam  is  still  categorized  as  a  \u201cleast  income\u201d  country.8  With  around  24%  of  the  population  still \nliving  below  the  poverty  line,  poverty  remains  a  major  concern  for  the  Government.  Social \ntension, lack of access to social services, demographic reasons like migration, land ownership, \ngender  and  ethnic  constraints,  and  environment-affected  risks  are  additional  obstacles  for \neconomic growth and the main reasons for people to return to poverty. Support for these people \nshould  come  on  time  and  be  delivered  effectively.  Thus,  a  careful  approach  (in  terms  of \nplanning  and  delivery)  will  be  required  to  reduce  poverty  and  to  prevent  the  return  to  poverty. \nThis is reflected in CPRGS implementation.  \n \n10. \nPoverty reduction efforts must (i) focus on high impact and sustainable poverty reduction \nprograms and projects (i.e., asset creating, infrastructure, and/or income-generating activities); \nand  (ii)  improve  opportunities  for  the  poor  to  access  market  facilities  and  social  services \nespecially  targeting  to  women,  children,  and  ethnic  groups  (i.e.,  creating  an  investment \nenvironment  and  strengthening  market  institutions,  improving  quality  of  services  with  effective \npolicies, decentralizing, and strengthening local public administration). Forests, water resources, \nand  tourism/ecotourism  should  and  can  play  an  important  role  in  moving  and  keeping  these \ncommunities out of poverty. \n \n \n \n11. \nIn  May  2002,  Viet  Nam  embarked  on  CPRGS  implementation.  The  CPRGS  was \nprepared  with  support  of  the  development  assistance  community,  including  ADB,  and  in \nconsultation with stakeholders and civil society (Appendix 2 provides details). Implementation of \nthe policy reform agenda as stipulated in the CPRGS, has been largely through pooling of ODA \nresources,  both  grant  and  lending,  under  the  PRSC  framework,  prepared  by  the  development \npartners in close consultation with government agencies, and the Government\u2019s own resources. \nWith  these  supports,  incorporation  of  the  CPRGS  into  socioeconomic  development  plans  has \nbeen  conducted  in  more  than  20  provinces  to  ensure  the  planning  process  captures  CPRGS \nprinciples, which focus on poverty and social inclusion, results-based planning and monitoring, \nand  broad  consultation.  This  planning  reform  is  important  to  ensure  all  policy  actions  are \ncaptured  into  the  long-  and  medium-term  strategies  at  all  levels  and  sectors.  In  addition, \ndevelopment  partners  must  align  their  country  strategic  plans  with  Government  plans  while \nmoving  toward  policy-based  lending.  Several  development  partners  have  jointly  and  actively \nconducted  the  formulation  and  review  of  PRSCs.  The  PRSC  framework  has  gradually  shifted \nfrom  narrowly  defined  structural  reform,  such  as  the  reform  of  state-owned  commercial  banks \n(SOCBs)  and  SOE  sector  to  a  broader  and  deeper  policy  reform  agenda,  encompassing  the \nthree pillars of the CPRGS (para. 3). \n \nThe  Government  has  well-established  coordinating,  monitoring,  and  oversight \n12. \narrangements for poverty reduction programs funded by various ODA resources. The National \nSteering Committee, established in September 2002, is chaired by a deputy prime minister, with \na deputy governor of the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) as standing deputy chair. Its members \ncome from  all concerned government ministries and agencies. The steering committee guides \nimplementation  of  CPRGS  poverty  reduction  programs  within  the  PRSC  framework.  The \nGovernment  undertakes  detailed  reviews  of  implementation  progress  of  the  CPRGS  reform \nagenda, and discusses findings and emerging issues with its development assistance partners, \nusually at the annual Consultative Group meeting. The Poverty Task Force meetings provide a \n\n                                                 \n8 The World Bank criterion for a least income country is US$765 annual per capita income for 2005. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5  \n\n \n\nforum  to  review  and  discuss  emerging  issues  in  line  with  CPRGS  implementation.  These \nmeetings  are  usually  cochaired  by  one  aid  representative  and  the  Government.  ADB,  World \nBank, and Department for International Development (DFID) cochair the meetings on a rotating \nbasis.  \n \nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1.  \n\nProblem and Constraints Analysis \n\n \n \n13. \nOverall, CPRGS progress has been significant, but important structural issues and social \nchallenges  need  to  be  addressed.  Regarding  the  transition  to  a  market  economy,  the  reform \nagenda  has  relied  on  restructuring  the  state  sector,  and  not  on  massive  divestiture.  Important \nsteps have been undertaken, especially in terms of liberalizing trade and fostering competition. \nBut  addressing  hard  budget  constraints  faced  by  the  SOEs  has  proved  more  difficult.  On  the \nsocial side, regional disparities may widen as Viet Nam integrates with the world economy. Also, \nethnic minorities have benefited less from economic growth than the majority of the population. \nThe  effective  delivery  of  social  services  to  the  poor,  especially  for  disadvantaged  regions  and \nethnic  minorities,  is  essential  to  keep  development  inclusive.  But  reform  of  the  social  sectors \nrequires changes in their financing, and needs to be carefully sequenced and aligned with the \ndecentralization  process.  As  for  governance,  institutional  reform  lags  the  rapid  economic \ntransition,  creating  opportunities  for  abuse.  The  Government  has  recently  taken  measures  to \nstrengthen  the  State  Inspectorate  and  State  Audit.  An  ambitious  initiative  to  strengthen  public \nfinancial  management  is  under  way.  But  considerable  weaknesses  persist  in  the  selection  of \npublic  investment  projects;  in  the  integration  of  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures;  and  in  the \nsupervision of project implementation, especially at the local level. Weak financial management \nsystems  and  insufficient  transparency  create  the  risk  of  inefficiency  in  the  allocation  of \nresources, mismanagement, and corruption. \n \nIn 2003, major movements and initiatives were undertaken on a broad range of reforms, \n14. \nespecially in relation to integrating with the world economy, permitting public investment in large \nSOEs  and  SOCBs,  and  designing  a  new  approach  to  fight  corruption.  The  Government  is \ncommitted  to  following  these  activities  through  as  they  promise  to  solidify  and  accelerate  the \nneeded  reforms.  The  Government  is  also  committed  to  adopting  a  more  decisive  stance  on \nbanking reform. As part of this, the Government will outline a clear separation of the functions of \nSBV  as  owner  of  commercial  banks  and  supervisor  of  the  system,  and  take  actions  to \nrestructure the SOCBs and improve their credit culture. The Government recognizes that for it to \nincrease lending from the ODA community, it will need to expedite implementation of its recent \ndecision on accession to WTO; increase private sector investment in large SOEs and SOCBs; \ntackle  directed  lending;  and  make  progress  on  governance  and  public  administration  reforms, \nthe anticorruption agenda, as well as financial sector reform.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCountry Strategy and Program of the Asian Development Bank \n\n \n15. \nADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is based on three pillars: (i) pro-poor economic growth, \n(ii) social development, and (iii) good governance. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (2002-\n2004)9 emphasizes (i) generating economic growth and new employment through private sector \ndevelopment;  (ii)  improving  governance  and  public  administration;  and  (iii)  paying  attention  to \nsocially  inclusive  development  and  focusing  on  the  central  region,  where  the  incidence  of \npoverty remains high.  \n\n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2001.

At the same time, to deal successfully with the accelerating pace of \ninternational economic integration, Viet Nam needs to modernize its economy and institutions, \nand  accelerate  investment  (to  an  estimated  35%  of  GDP).  Faster  growth,  which  is  likely  to \nbenefit  the  more  advanced  areas,  will  need  to  be  accompanied  by  measures  to  distribute  the \nbenefits of growth, including targeting of poor areas and groups. \n \n \n \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n \n3. \n\na. \n\nMultiple-Tranche Program Loan \n\nA special evaluation on program lending11 reported that since 1987 program loans have \n17. \ngenerally  been  limited  to  two  tranches.  The  report  suggested  that  uniform  adherence  to  two-\ntranche program loans should be abandoned; and that multiple and floating tranches could be \neffective  in  providing  flexibility  in  meeting  policy  change,  preserving  an  incentive  for  policy \nchanges, and maintaining continuous engagement with a longer term outlook. \n \nThe proposed program loan uses an innovative approach of a single-tranche loan that is \n18. \nactually  part  of  a  continuum  multiple-tranche  program  loan.  Since  all  of  the  15  policy  actions \nincluded in the proposed program loan have already been achieved prior to loan approval, the \nloan proceeds will be disbursed as soon as the loan becomes effective. While this arrangement \nmay  on  the  surface  seem  overly  flexible,  the  PRSC  operation  is  outcome  oriented  with \nambitious but specific outcomes/targets set to be achieved in 5 years after the inception of the \nCPRGS.  To  identify  the  prior  conditions  for  each  annual  PRSC,  the  Government  and \ncofinanciers  undergo  several  rounds  of  policy  dialogue  to  discuss  and  select  effective  but \nfeasible  prior  actions  from  a  pool  of  many  more  policy  measures.  The  identification  and \nsequencing  of  a  comprehensive  medium-term  reform  agenda  require  strong  analytical  work. \nLessons  learned  from  similar  World  Bank  programs  note  the  importance  of  conducting  joint \nanalytical work between development partners and the Government, with wide consultation with \nacademia, and civil society. The development partners and academia can help the Government \nin terms of analytical tools and sharing of international experiences.  \n \n19. \nThe flexibility of the PRSC operations is evident in the expanding reform areas covered \nunder the last few PRSCs. In addition, the PRSC operations promote coordinated aid effort in \nassisting  Viet  Nam  under  an  overall  development  framework  as  evident  by  an  increasing \nnumber  of  PRSC  cofinanciers.  The  identification  and  sequencing  of  a  comprehensive  reform \nagenda  that  covers  a  medium-term  period  requires  strong  analytical  work.  It  is  important  to \nconduct joint analytical work between donors with wide consultation with academia and the civil \nsociety with the Government.  \n \n20. \nThe assessment of the first three PRSC programs showed that progress was achieved \nwithin  most  sectors,  but  with  room  for  improvement,  particularly  for  SOE  and  financial  sector \nreform.  However,  Government  leaders  are  committed  to  accelerating  banking  reform.  This \nincludes a partial equitization of SOCBs and movement for SBV to focus entirely on monetary \n\n                                                 \n10  World  Bank.  2003.

The  National  Assembly  has  been  considering  a  large  backlog  of  laws  and \nregulations  necessary  for  WTO  accession.  The  acceleration  in  considering  and  passing  those \nlaws and regulations would limit progress in passing laws in other areas.  \n \n \n \n21. \nLessons from the experience of previous program loans and postevaluation studies are \nthat  (i)  continued  ownership  and  commitment  of  government  are  fundamental  to  achieving \ndevelopment outcomes; (ii) monitoring and evaluation should be based on both process (inputs \nand outputs) and outcome indicators; (iii) outcome indicators will depend on successful follow-\non actions, as passage of a decree or law alone will not produce any meaningful results if the \nlaw  is  not  brought  into  effect  (which  will  require  regulations,  circulars,  etc.),  and  proper \nenforcement  (which  will  require  institutional  capabilities);  and  (iv)  sector  or  subsector-based \nprogram loans have limited scope to address economywide policy and institutional issues. \n \n\n4. \n\nJustification for the Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Credit  \n\nthe  business  environment,  (ii)  making  development  socially \n\n \n22. \nPRSC 4 aims to address three key areas of macro policy and institutional reforms for (i) \nsupporting  the  transition  to  a  market  economy  by  removing  structural  weaknesses  and \nimproving \ninclusive  and \nenvironment  friendly,  and  (iii)  modernizing  governance  and  the  public  administration  system. \nPRSC  4  preparation  was  expected  to  build  on  the  foundations  of  the  existing  strong  ODA \ncommunity\u2019s  commitment  to  support  Viet  Nam\u2019s  reform  agenda  through  nationwide  CPRGS \nimplementation and galvanize interest for the reform program among stakeholders. Increasingly \ndevelopment partners have united around the PRSC as an instrument for policy dialogue. They \nhave already been actively involved in supporting implementation of the reform agenda, through \nanalytical  work,  technical  assistance,  project  lending,  and  direct  budget  support.  The  PRSCs, \nincluding PRSC 4, fall in the last category. The rationale for direct budget support comes from \nthe external financing needs under the state budget. The policy actions supported by the PRSC \nprocess entail a substantial additional burden on the budget. Among these are recapitalization \nof  SOCBs,  operation  of  a  safety  net  for  workers  who  become  redundant  as  a  result  of  SOE \nrestructuring,  expansion  of  budget  appropriations  for  the  education  sector,  and  creation  of \nprovincial health care funds for the poor.  \n \n23. \nThe  justification  for  PRSC  4  is  grounded  on  three  criteria:  (i)  prudent  macroeconomic \nmanagement to ensure that progress with the long-term reform agenda will not be undermined \nby short-term instability; (ii) the Government\u2019s own assessment of the progress accomplished in \nCPRGS implementation; and (iii) the need to meet the reform triggers (measures and actions) \nfor PRSC 4 (established with PRSC 3), except for unforeseen circumstances.   \n \nThe  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  assessment  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  performance12 \n24. \nconfirms the country\u2019s solid macroeconomic performance in 2004, despite the adverse effects of \ndroughts and the outbreak of avian influenza. The Governments\u2019 progress report13 on CPRGS \nimplementation  was  presented  to  the  Consultative  Group  meeting  in  December  2004.  The \nreport highlights the accomplishments in reform implementation (e.g., opening of the economy, \nmore  favorable  investment  climate,  better  public  financial  management,  substantial  poverty \nreduction,  and  attainment  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals),  but  it  also  identifies \n\n                                                 \n12  Letter of assessment prepared by the International Monetary Fund to accompany PRSC 4, available on request. \n13  Government of Viet Nam. 2004.

It identifies \nactions to support the unfinished reform agenda, including the preparations for WTO accession, \nopening  of  the  equity  capital  of  large  SOEs  and  SOCBs  to  private  investors,  progress  in \nplanning  processes  and  public  financial  management,  and  the  move  to  a  more  systemic \napproach  to  addressing  corruption.  In  addition,  the  PRSC  4  policy  agenda  includes  several \nmeasures  to  promote  socially  inclusive  economic  development.  These  are  consistent  with \nADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy,  country  strategy  and  program  for  Viet  Nam,  and  poverty \nreduction agreement with Viet Nam. \n\n \n26. \nCPRGS  implementation  supported  by  the  PRSC  programs  is  expected  to  lead  to \nsubstantial  improvements  in  development  outcomes.  The  current  PRSC-cycle  covers  5  years, \nmuch the same as the CPRGS. While the reform program focuses on a set of strategic policy \nactions, its implementation should translate into improved economic and social indicators. The \npreparatory work for PRSC 4 commenced in late 2004. The identification of the policy actions \nneeded  to  attain  the  development  outcomes  spelled  out  in  the  CPRGS  has  been  strongly \ninfluenced by analytical work. ADB and other development partners, including the International \nMonetary Fund14 are instrumental in providing factual information and analysis, thus contributing \nto the monitoring of progress in implementing reforms and sharing international good practices. \nThe  PRSC  process  has  been  supported  by  a  series  of  comprehensive  analytical  reports \ncovering  the  CPRGS\u2019s  three  pillars.  The  analytical  work  also  helps  the  development  partners \nand  the  Government  identify  the  PRSC  policy  actions  needed  to  attain  the  development \noutcomes  outlined  in  the  CPRGS.  The  annual  Viet  Nam  development  reports  (VDRs),  a  joint \ndonor  report  to  the  Viet  Nam  Consultative  Group  meeting,  provide  crucial  information  and \nanalyses  on  focal  issues  relevant  to  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda.  VDR  2004,  entitled \nPoverty,15  examined  issues  regarding  social  inclusion.  VDR  2005,  entitled  Governance,16 \n\n                                                 \n14  The  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  3-year  loan  arrangement  with  Viet  Nam  under  the  Poverty  Reduction  and \nGrowth  Facility  expired  in  April  2004.  However,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  remains  fully  committed  to \ncontinuing a partnership with the Government to support CPRGS implementation. It has contributed actively to the \nbroader dialogue between the Government and its development partners, and also provides the required letter of \nassessment for the PRSCs.  \n\n15 ADB, Australian\u2019s Government\u2019s Overseas Aid Program, DFID, German Agency for Technical Cooperation, JICA, \nSave the Children UK, United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. 2003.

And the forthcoming VDR 2006, entitled Business, will \nmainly deal with structural reforms. VDRs are prepared in partnership with PRSC cofinanciers \nincluding ADB, with substantive inputs from Vietnamese policymakers and academics.  \n \nThe ODA community has adopted the CPRGS as their reference document for planning \n27. \nexternal assistance for the country. The focus of these operations has gradually broadened to \ninclude  all  the  essential  pillars  of  poverty  reduction  and  sustainable  economic  growth,  and  is \nincorporated in PRSC programs. The ODA community in Viet Nam considers the PRSC a useful \ninstrument in support of CPRGS implementation. In 2005, 10 major ODA partners, namely ADB, \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency,  Denmark,  European  Commission,  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, Ireland, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Netherlands, \nAgencia  Espa\u00f1ola  de  Cooperaci\u00f3n  Internacional,  and  United  Kingdom\u2019s  DFID  are  cofinancing \nPRSC 4 with the World Bank. All cofinanciers have participated in the preparation of PRSC 4, \nand  have  been  actively  involved  in  the  policy  areas  where  they  are  strong.  Because  many \ndevelopment  agencies  are  active  in  Viet  Nam,  several  cofinanciers  are  involved  in  the  same \nreform  sectors.  However,  when  considering  subsectors,  certain  cofinanciers  may  have  more \ncomparative advantage than others. For example, for the financial sector, while the World Bank \nand Japan Bank for International Cooperation specialize on banking reform, ADB is specialized \non nonbanking reform. Through the ongoing Financial Sector Program loans I and II, ADB has \nassisted  the  Government  in  developing  the  capital  market,  insurance  market,  leasing  sector, \nmoney  market,  secured  transactions,  and  accounting  and  auditing  system,  and  anti-money-\nlaundering regulation. ADB has participated in policy dialogue related to many reform sectors as \nit has a large portfolio of about US$2.0 billion, compared with the World Bank\u2019s portfolio of about \nUS$2.7 billion. Appendix 3 provides the aid coordination matrix. \n \n28. \nADB  has  promoted  policy  dialogue  in  Viet  Nam  on  similar  sector  issues  through  its \nprogram  lending  activities  (such  as  loans  for  the  Agriculture  Sector  Program,  Financial  Sector \nProgram I, Public Administration Reform Program Cluster in 2003; and the Small- and Medium-\nSized Enterprise Development and Financial Sector Program II in 2004). PRSC 4, which has a \nnational economywide reform agenda, complements these ADB-assisted activities (Appendix 2, \nFigure  A2.2).  In  addition,  ADB  staff  have  actively  participated  in  PRSC  policy  dialogue  with \nother  cofinanciers,  thus  ensuring  synergy  between  the  PRSC\u2019s  multisector  policy  actions  and \nADB sector-based programs/projects. This allows ADB to verify that PRSC 4 conditions do not \nconflict with policy conditions under ADB\u2019s ongoing sector loans. In fact, ADB\u2019s participation in \nthis  dialogue  enables  it  to  influence  the  reform  agenda  to  complement  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  sector \nloans.  In  other  words,  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  PRSC  operations  complements  ADB\u2019s  own \nsector  programs,  because  the  PRSC  provides  a  clear  picture  of  ADB\u2019s  intervention  as  part  of \nand in relation to the aggregated efforts of all Viet Nam\u2019s development partners. The proposed \nloan  therefore  would  provide  great  leverage  in  aid  coordination  and  formulation  of  the  results-\nbased country strategy and program for Viet Nam.  \n       \n29. \nAs a multisector instrument covering a range of issues related to poverty reduction, the \nPRSC will provide ADB with an opportunity to (i) advance policy dialogue in a well-coordinated \nmanner with other relevant ODA partners of Viet Nam, and (ii) ensure that key policy issues for \nimplementation of ADB operations in Viet Nam are adequately considered and addressed in the \npolicy dialogue between the Government and the ODA community.

Hanoi: \nPrinting and Cultural Product Company.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n    \n\nprovides strategic crosscutting coverage that sector- or subsector-based program loans cannot \nprovide. By participating in this multilateral cross-sector loan, ADB gained insight to permit fine-\ntuning of the sector-based loan. \n \nTo  reduce  transaction  costs  for  the  Government  and  the  participating  development \n30. \npartners in a rather complex operation, the proposed loan pursues a program-based approach. \nThis  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  recent  move  and  practices  to  adopting  program-based  and  sector \napproaches  in  its  lending  operations  to  reduce  transaction  costs  for  its  developing  member \ncountries  as  well  as  for  its  own  operations.  The  approach  is  not  only  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \nreform agenda,17 Long-Term Strategic Framework,18 and Medium-Term Strategy,19 but also will \ndirectly  help  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  obligations  to  the  Rome  Declaration  on  harmonizing  procedures  of \nmultilateral  development  banks  (February  2003)  and  the  recent  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid \nEffectiveness (February\u2013March 2005). \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n31. \nThe  program  loan  aims  to  help  Viet  Nam  reduce  poverty  and  sustain  high-level \neconomic  growth,  as  envisaged  in  the  CPRGS.  The  outcome  envisaged  is  to  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Program  under  the  policy  framework  of  PRSC  4,  together \nwith  other  development  partners,  with  a  focus  on  reducing  structural  weaknesses,  promoting \nsocially  inclusive  development,  and  modernizing  governance  and  public  administration.  To \nreduce poverty and sustain rapid economic growth, the program loan will strengthen Viet Nam\u2019s \nreform program on three main fronts: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPromote  growth  and  create  employment  by  increasing  internal  and  external \ncompetition;  accelerating  the  divestiture  of  SOEs  and  SOCBs;  and  improving \ntransparency  and  accountability  in  SOE  operations,  banking,  and  the  financial \nsector. \nAdvance  human  development  by  increasing  the  budget  appropriation  for \neducation and increasing education standards; providing resources to cover the \nhealth care costs of the poor; developing mechanisms to complete the transfer of \nland-use  rights  to  households,  especially  in  upland  and  ethnic  minority  areas; \nand  providing  support  measures  to  improve  environmental  and  water  resource \nmanagement.  \nIncrease  transparency  and  accountability  of  public  finances;  promote  simplified \nadministrative procedures, and work to decrease corruption as part of a broader \neffort  to  build  modern  governance;  and  revamp  the  planning  processes  by \nmoving away from a command approach to aligning policies and resources with \nthe  attainment  of  well-specified  development  goals  based  on  empirical  analysis \nand wider consultations.  \n\n \nPolicy Framework and Actions\n\nB. \n\n32. \nPreparatory work to formulate PRSC 4, aiming to support the Government with CPRGS \nimplementation,  was  initiated  in  September  2004  with  the  participation  of  key  development \n                                                 \n17  President Chino\u2019s memo of 25 August 2004 entitled Today: Achieving Results Together.  \n18  Asian Development Bank. 2001.

SBV \ncoordinated  the  overall  processing  of  PRSC  4  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  while  the  World \nBank took the lead for the development partners (Appendix 2 provides summary details of the \nformulation of the program loan).  \n \nThe PRSC 4 policy framework includes both deepening and broadening reforms under \n33. \nthree  pillars:  (i)  transition  to  a  market  economy,  (ii)  social  inclusion  and  environmental \nsustainability, and (iii) modern governance. The policy matrix is presented in Appendix 4 and the \ndevelopment policy letter in Appendix 5.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPillar I: Transition to a Market Economy  \n\n \n34. \nUnder  this  pillar,  PRSC  4  supports  reform  actions  in  areas  such  as  trade  integration, \nSOE reform, financial sector reform, and improving the business environment. Such reforms are \ncritical to maintain the momentum of high economic growth. The key thrusts in trade integration \nare  Viet  Nam\u2019s  accession  to  WTO  and  harmonization  of  the  legal  environment  pertaining  to \ntrade  and  investments  in  the  integration  process.  Under  previous  PRSCs,  quantitative \nrestrictions  on  a  number  of  imports  were  removed  and  a  strategy  for  lowering  tariffs  adopted. \nViet  Nam  continues  to  make  significant  progress  in  the  negotiations  for  WTO  accession.  In \nparallel with the negotiation process, related legislation is being formulated or revised. In March \n2005, the Prime Minister issued Decision 41 on regulations of import licensing consistent with \nWTO requirements. The Government also revised the Decree on Foreign Investment to abolish \nthe requirement that foreign invested companies must export as least 80% of their outputs.  \n \n35. \nViet Nam also committed to comply with WTO\u2019s Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement \nfrom  the  date  of  accession.  As  part  of  the  commitment,  a  national  phytosanitary  notification \nbody  and  enquiry  point  was  established  under  Decision  99  in  May  2005.  This  is  to  facilitate \ncommunication both between Viet Nam and other countries and among government agencies. \nThe Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is the focal agency in this process. An action \nplan is being developed to address phytosanitation, food safety, and agriculture health issues. \nThis aims to support the exploitation of new export opportunities in agriculture and fisheries, as \nwell as protect Viet Nam from cross-border, disease-related threats.   \n \nThe  revised  Customs  Law,  passed  in  May  2005,  shifts  the  approach  of  the  customs \n36. \nadministration from control to trade facilitation. In the past, customs documents were manually \nfilled  and  processed  while  goods  were  subject  to  physical  inspection.  This  delayed  goods \nclearance and raised the transaction cost. The new law introduces an electronic environment for \ninteractions  between  traders  and  customs,  allows  self-assessment  of  traders\u2019  liabilities,  and \nfacilitates risk management techniques to minimize physical inspections.  \n \n37. \nRestructuring  and  ownership  transformation  of  SOEs  constitute  a  major  component \nunder the PRSCs. The agenda for SOE reform is evolving with some progress. Equitization of \nSOEs  is  accelerating.  Positive  developments  include  the  Government\u2019s  determination  to \ndecrease  government  ownership  in  certain  sectors  and  to  facilitate  the  divestiture  or \nrestructuring  of  large  enterprises.  Decision  155/2004/QD-TTg  reduced  the  list  of  sectors  in \nwhich  full  state  control  is  justified:  100%  state  ownership  is  now  stipulated  only  for  strategic \n\n                                                 \n20  Adapted from the jointly processed PRSC 4 report. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n    \n\nsectors such as explosives, national defense, printing of banknotes, national electricity grid, rail \nnetwork, and major ports. Decision 155 provides for equitization of electricity generation units, \nan  area  previously  deemed  strategic.  A  hydropower  plant  was  equitized  through  auction  in \nMarch 2005. An action plan for the equitization of another seven power plants was approved.  \n\n38. \nThe significance of Decision 155 extends beyond the equitization of large SOEs. In 2003 \nevery  line  ministry,  government  agency,  province,  and  general  corporation  drew  up  an \nequitization list defined according to the criteria in Decision 58.21 These were the so-called 104 \nrestructuring  plans  approved  by  the  Prime  Minister  to  serve  as  the  basis  for  the  equitization \nprocess over the following 3 years. The necessary revision of all these plans in light of Decision \n155  will  lead  to  the  divestiture  of  many  more  SOEs,  including  large  ones.  A  preliminary  count \nindicates  that  736  SOEs  will  be  added  to  the  2,400  already  identified  for  equitization,  sale,  or \nliquidation  in  the  so-called  104  restructuring  plans.  Also  SOEs  whose  equitization  plans  have \nbeen approved are being reexamined as the proportion of shares to be sold may now increase. \n\n39. \nThe Government also issued Decree 153 in August 2004 to convert large groupings of \nSOEs, currently organized under the form of a general corporation, into holding companies. The \nholding company model was recommended by a series of operational reviews, and promises to \nimprove corporate governance of general corporations. The conversion of general corporations \ninto holding companies should greatly strengthen their management. As defined in Decree 153, \na  holding  company  in  Viet  Nam  is  not  a  large  entity  involved  in  a  wide  variety  of  industries. \nConverting into a holding company  involves the corporatization of entities whose activities are \nlargely  restricted  to  one  sector.  The  general  corporation  structure  of  Viet  Nam  is  unique. \nGeneral corporations do not control the SOEs in their clusters through ownership of equity in the \nmanner that conventional limited liability companies own their subsidiaries. This has resulted in \nsuboptimal  performance  of  general  corporations  in  terms  of  their  ability  to  drive  sector  growth \nand  competitiveness.  Decree  153  is  designed  so  that  a  \u201cmother\u201d  general  corporation  can \nexercise  appropriate  management  control  over  its  \u201cchildren\u201d  companies.  In  the  future,  this \nstructure rationalization should make equitization of whole general corporations, including their \nchildren companies, easier.  \n\n40. \nDecree  187  also  introduced  key  changes  on  conversion  of  SOEs  into  joint  stock \ncompanies, as of 16 November 2004, to facilitate the equitization process, whereby valuations \nmust be conducted by outside agencies, the ability of strategic investors and other outsiders to \nbuy  shares  has  been  extended,  the  shares  themselves  are  to  be  sold  through  auctions,  and \nincentives  for  linkage  between  equitization  and  listing  are  enhanced.  Decree  187  defines  the \nresponsibilities  of  SOE  managers  in  financial  settlement,  and  stipulates  the  transfer  of  assets \nand  debts  not  included  in  enterprise  valuation  to  the  Debt  and  Assets  Trading  Company.  The \ntwo  sources  of  subsidies  for  retrenched  SOE  workers  include  (i)  the  redundant  workers  fund, \nand  (ii)  the  SOE  equitization  support  fund.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  manages  both  funds.  The \ndecree  stipulates  that  a  proportion  of  equitization  proceeds  must  be  contributed  to  the  funds. \nThe redundant workers are eligible for retraining and the redundancy allowances.22 The decree \nmandates  the  employment  of  outside  agencies  to  carry  out  valuations,  and  makes  land \nvaluation  consistent  with  the  new  Land  Law.  It  extends  the  ability  of  strategic  investors  and \nother outsiders to buy shares, and links share prices to market value  determined  by auctions. \n\n                                                 \n21  On  26  April  2002  the  Prime  Minister  issued  Decision  58/2002/QD-TTg  issuing  criteria  for  classifying  SOEs  and \ngeneral  corporations  and  a  list  of  sectors  where  the  state  must  retain  100%  ownership  or  more  than  50% \nownership.  Based  on  the  list  of  sectors  and  the  criteria,  line  ministries  and  local  authorities  formulated  a  list  of \nSOEs to be equitized that do not fall into the categories in Decision 58. \n\n22  The  redundant  workers\u2019  pension  fund  is  managed  by  an  independent  agency,  namely  the  Viet  Nam  Social \n\nSecurity. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n13  \n\n \n\nThe  decree  also  provides  clearer  guidelines  on  how  sales  proceeds  are  to  be  used:  for \nseverance benefits, to support retraining, and transfer of the remaining funds to the Ministry of \nFinance.  \n\nThe  PRSC  includes  banking  reform  as  a  core  component.  Restructuring  SOCBs  to \n41. \nimprove  their  financial  health  and  operational  efficiency  is  imperative  to  sustain  economic \ngrowth especially as the financial sector is mostly bank-based, through which most investments \nare  financed.  As  the  sector  is  more  liberalized  in  light  of  WTO  accession,  strengthening  bank \nsupervision  should  be  on  the  top  of  the  banking  reform  agenda.  Under  PRSC  4,  SBV \nannounced  separation  of  SBV\u2019s  management  of  SOCBs  from  its  supervision  functions.  This \nannouncement is based on inputs prepared for the Banking Development Strategy up to 2010. \nThe strategy was submitted to the Government, which is expected to endorse most if not all of \nit. Through a separate document, the Government has confirmed the noncontroversial aspects \nof this submission. They include the development of new laws on SBV and credit institutions, to \nbe passed in 2008 based on WTO requirements and Basel core principles. This document also \nenvisages the transformation of the SBV into a modern central bank, charged with the conduct \nof  market-based  monetary  policy  and  financial  sector  supervision.  The  commercial  orientation \nand autonomy of SOCBs is another key objective of the reform. The equitization of all SOCBs is \nseen as an important step in that direction.  \n\nAs the banking reform proceeds, an assessment of the asset quality of banks is needed. \n42. \nThis  is  important  to  provide  for  substandard  assets  and  to  develop  a  realistic  plan  to  address \nnonperforming  loans  (NPLs).  In  April  2005,  SBV  promulgated  Decision  492  on  asset \nclassification  and  loan-loss  provisioning  for  banks  in  line  with  international  practices.  The \nregulation  includes  a  mandatory  classification  of  debt  based  on  repayment  status  into  five \ncategories,  with  associated  specific  provisioning  ratios.  Banks  will  also  have  to  apply  a \nqualitative risk-based classification of debts using internal credit-rating systems, which need to \nbe  approved  by  SBV.  Initially  banks  will  have  the  option  to  defer  the  qualitative  risk-based \nclassification,  but  they  must  have  implemented  it  after  3  years.  The  regulation  represents  a \nsignificant improvement over the use of Vietnamese accounting standards and will enhance the \noverall  evaluation  of  asset  quality  in  the  banks,  as  well  as  ensure  appropriate  provisioning  for \npotential losses. All banks will have to produce their first reports based on the new classification \nby June 2005, and submit the corresponding NPL resolution plans shortly after. SBV provided a \npreliminary  estimate  of  NPLs,  based  on  the  new  regulation.  The  estimate  is  in  line  with \nindependent audits of the SOCBs using international accounting standards.   \n\nAlong  with  the  measures  to  address  financial  aspects  of  the  banking  reform,  PRSC  4 \n43. \nalso  supported  the  strengthening  of  banking  practices  and  operations.  Adoption  of  the  credit \nmanual  and  loan  computerization  are  among  the  measures  taken.  This  helps  banks  to \nstandardize their credit policy and procedures, and to enhance the efficiency of lending activities \nand  portfolio  monitoring.  Banks  are  also  required  to  establish  internal  audit  committees  to \nimprove accountability and governance.  \n\n44. \nThe Government, for the first time, established an anti-money-laundering regime through \nissuance  of  Decree  74  on  June  2005.  The  decree  requires  suspicious  transactions  to  be \nrecorded  and  tracked.  Financial  institutions  are  obligated  to  set  an  internal  procedure  for  the \nprevention  of  money  laundering.  An  information  center  for  anti-money  laundering  will  be \nestablished  within  SBV  to  receive  and  process  information  and  reports  on  individuals  and \norganizations that perform suspicious financial transactions. Interim measures to combat money \nlaundering  include  suspension  of  transactions, freezing  the  account,  and  temporary  seizure  of \nassets.  The  decree  specifies  the  responsibilities  of  the  SBV,  Ministry  of  Public  Security,  and \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n    \n\nother relevant ministries in tracking and dealing with money-laundering activities. It also defines \nthe mechanism for international cooperation to fight money laundering. The Government is also \nproceeding to become a member of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering. \n \nDecree 28, issued on 9 March 2005, sets out a framework for establishment, operation, \n45. \nand regulation of microfinance institutions. Despite some restrictions with regard to geographic \noperation  coverage  and  range  of  services,  the  decree  represents  a  significant  step  forward  in \nrecognizing microfinance operations and improving their outreach and governance. To date, this \narea has not had any formal regulation despite the existence of a wide variety of organizations \nthat provide financial services. Decree 28 defines microfinance institutions and licensing criteria; \nand provides for supervision of the institutions based on specific parameters in areas such as \ncapital,  corporate  governance,  and  business  plans.  The  supervision  of  the  microfinance \ninstitutions  is  not  as  strict  as  for  banks  as  the  institutions  are  much  smaller  in  scale  and \ntherefore should not have to contend with the relatively complex regulations that apply to banks. \n \n46. \nImproving  the  business  environment  for  the  private  sector  has  presented  the  most \nremarkable  and  persistent  achievement  of  Viet  Nam  over  the  last  5  years.  The  streamlined \nbusiness  registration  procedures  have  led  to  a  significantly  increased  number  of  new \nenterprises\u201427,700  enterprises  with  the  registered  capital  of  D58  trillion  in  2003  and  37,230 \nenterprises with the registered capital of D76 trillion in 2004. Under PRSC 4, progress is being \nmade  to  enhance  the  environment  for  private  sector  development.  The  National  Assembly \npassed the Competition Law in December 2004, which serves as a governing framework for fair \ncompetition. Open competition will apply to all sectors and types of enterprises including SOEs. \nUnder the open competition policy, private enterprises will be protected against anticompetition \nacts  from  dominant  public  sector  competitors,  and  enterprise  monopolies  are  discouraged.  A \ncompetition commission will be established under the law. Effective implementation of the law \nand  independent  operation  of  the  competition  commission  are  critical  to  ensure  fair  market \naccess and competition \n \n47. \nIn infrastructure, the Electricity Law passed by the National Assembly in November 2004 \nwill  facilitate  restructuring  of  the  power  sector,  including  the  separation  of  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution.  It  will  allow  for  greater  diversity  of  ownership  and  financing  of \npower  sector  assets,  as  well  as  create  the  conditions  for  greater  competition  in  power  sector \ngeneration  and  supply  markets  in  the  longer  term.  The  law  foresees  the  establishment  of  an \nelectricity  regulator  to  ensure  more  transparent  oversight  of  existing  operators  and  new \noperators; as well as to evaluate electricity tariffs, investment, quality of service, and operation. \n \n\nPillar II: Social Inclusion and Environmental Sustainability \n\n2. \n \n48. \nIssues related to social inclusion and environmental sustainability include policy actions \nin  education,  health,  water,  and  environment.  For  education,  concern  for  quality  has  taken \npriority as strategies to improve access and equity are being implemented. A standards-based \napproach  is  being  employed  to  upgrade  quality.  The  fundamental  school  quality  standards  for \nprimary schools have been adopted nationwide. They refer to physical infrastructure, teaching \nstaff,  school  organization  and  management,  social  participation  in  education,  educational \nactivities  and  quality,  and  expected  educational  outcomes.  A  survey  covering  all  districts  was \nconducted  to  audit  the  current  situation  relative  to  the  standards.  Typically,  schools  in  poorer \nzones fall far short. To ensure equity, poorer zones are given priority in upgrading quality. \n \n49. \nLow teaching skills and content knowledge are major constraints for enhancing student \nachievement,  as  demonstrated  by  a  recent  study  of  academic  performance  at  the  end  of  the \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n15  \n\n \n\nprimary school cycle. These constraints are being addressed through the introduction of a clear \nteacher profile as an assessment tool to improve teaching competencies, to guide professional \ndevelopment, and to set up a remuneration-related grading system. The teacher profile consists \nof three dimensions (attitudes, knowledge, and pedagogical skill) defined through four levels of \ncompetency  (beginning,  regular,  senior,  and  lead).  The  profile  has  been  refined  through \nstakeholder  consultation  and  a  trial  application  with  2,200  teachers.  By  now  25,000  primary \nschool teachers (or 7% of the total) have been evaluated against the new profile. \n\nRecent  legal  changes  will  promote  and  safeguard  poor  people\u2019s  access  to  forestland \n50. \nand forest resources as a source of livelihood. State forestry enterprises currently control 40% \nof the 11 million hectares of land classified as forested, which are often located in the poorest \nparts  of  the  country.  State  forestry  enterprises  generally  have  contracted  out  all  forest \nmanagement  activities  to  local  households.  But  because  tenure  security  is  weak  and \narrangements lack clarity, the local population benefits only marginally from forestry activities. A \nclear separation between the public service provision role of state forestry enterprises and their \nbusiness  activities  is  needed  to  improve  the  well-being  of  those  whose  livelihoods  depend  on \nforestland and to enhance conservation. Decree 200/2004/ND-CP on the restructuring of state \nforestry  enterprises  provides  criteria  for  their  transformation  into  either  commercially  viable \nwood  businesses  or  effective  public  service  entities,  in  particular,  for  forest  protection.  In  the \nprocess, land use certificates (LUCs) for the remaining underused land and scattered forestland \nwill  be  transferred  to  households,  communities,  and  other  users,  including  private  sector \nenterprises. \n\n51. \nThe  revised  Law  on  Forest  Protection  and  Development,  approved  by  the  National \nAssembly in November 2004, provides the overall framework for the move to more social and \ncommunity-based  forestry.  For  the  first  time,  it  recognizes  the  forest  use  right  of  households, \ncommunities,  and  other  sectors,  as  well  as  their  ownership  of  plantation  forest.  It  provides  a \nframework for multiple uses of the vast areas of protection forest in the uplands, and exploitation \nrights in these areas, which could lead to new management systems combining protection with \nproduction.  The  law  provides  terms  and  conditions  for  the  leasing  of  production  forest  to \neconomic units including farm households, and proposes to assign an economic value to each \nforest production area as the basis for its allocation or lease. In parallel, key stakeholders have \nstarted  the  consultation  process  to  revise  the  Forest  Sector  Strategy,  which  is  expected  to \nproduce a long-term broad positive impact not only on poverty reduction but also on sustainable \nmanagement of forest, land, water, and environment in upland areas. \n\nThe  foundations  for  an  effective  set  of  policies,  tools  and  incentives  for  environmental \n52. \nprotection  are  being  laid  out.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  development  over  the  last  decade  has  created \nsustainability  challenges  that  are  not  appropriately  addressed  by  the  existing  legislation.  The \namendments  to  the  Law  on  Environmental  Protection,  submitted  to  the  National  Assembly  in \nMay  2005,  should  lead  to  improvements  in  two  main  areas.  First,  they  clarify  line  ministries\u2019 \nresponsibilities for environmental protection, and decentralize responsibilities within the Ministry \nof  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  to  its  local  and  regional  departments.  Second,  they \nenable  new  policy  tools  and  remedies  for  various  environmental  issues  such  as  pollution \nprevention  and  cleanup,  adjustments  to  cover  the  private  sector,  improvements  in  financial \nmechanisms  for  environmental  protection,  and  initiatives  for  raising  public  awareness  and \nsupport for environmental protection. \n\nGuidelines for the implementation of the Land Law represent a key step in strengthening \n53. \nland registration and land valuation. Under the  new law, the limitations previously imposed on \ndistricts and provincial governments for their authorities to issue LUCs have been abolished. A \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n    \n\nunified  system  of  land  administration  agencies  is  also  to  be  set  up.  Decree  181/2004/ND-CP \ncovers  these  aspects.  It  also  addresses  zoning  issues,  with  the  requirement  that  provinces \nsubmit their complete land-use plans in 2005. The recalling of unused or inappropriately used \nland  is  assigned  to  provincial  People's  Committees.  Decree  188/2004/ND-CP  provides \nguidelines  in  the  crucial  area  of  valuation,  serving  as  the  basis  to  calculate  taxes  on  LUC \ntransfers,  and  to  set  the  value  of  LUCs  and  rents  when  the  government  decides  to  lease  or \nallocate  land  to  businesses.  The  system  will  also  be  used  to  define  the  value  of  LUCs  for \ncompensation claims when the government withdraws land. The new valuation system is much \nmore  flexible  than  the  previous  one  and  will  be  adjusted  in  accordance  with  changing  market \nvalues. The previous mechanism often fixed land prices at much lower rates than their market \nvalue,  resulting  in  residents  being  reluctant  to  move  out  of  construction  areas  because  of  low \nresettlement packages. \n\n3. \n\nPillar III: Modern Governance \n\n \n \n54. \nThe  focus  of  this  reform  pillar  is  on  improving  the  planning  process,  public  financial \nmanagement,  delivery  of  public  administration  services  to  people  and  businesses,  and \nanticorruption  initiatives.  The  CPRGS  approach  is  more  integrated  into  the  5-year  SEDP  at \nnational and local levels. The Prime Minister recently issued Directive 33/2004/CT-TTg to guide \nthe  preparation  of  the  5-year  SEDP  for  2006\u20132010.  The  last  planning  period  (2001\u20132005) \ninvolved  the  production  of  both  a  SEDP  and  the  CRPGS.  The  CPRGS  was  described  as  an \naction plan for the SEDP by the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) and accepted as a \npoverty  reduction  strategy  by  the  international  development  community.  The  Prime  Minister\u2019s \ninstructions  state  that  these  two  planning  instruments\u2014which  have  differed  in  both  approach \nand substance\u2014will be merged in the coming plan period. The CPRGS has not had the same \ncentral  role  in  directing  government  activities  but  has  pioneered  some  new  approaches  to \nsocioeconomic planning, both in terms of process and substance. The SEDP takes most of the \nCPRGS  important  principles,  with  a  result  that  consultations  for  planning  this  SEDP  were \nbroader,  involving  groups  outside  of  government  including  local  organizations  and  some  poor \ncommunities. The process has involved three main activities: (i) regional workshops to discuss \nthe  approach  and  its  implications  for  sector  and  local  planning  processes,  (ii)  community  and \nlocal  consultation,  (iii)  other  stakeholder  workshops,  and  (iv)  an  international  consultation \nworkshop. The SEDP also has a stronger analytical framework for growth and poverty reduction \nuses of a wider range of credible data mechanisms to monitor progress, framed around VDGs \n(localized versions of the Millennium Development Goals); some of the participatory approaches \nto  planning  were  emulated;  and  achievement  of  strategic  outcomes\u2014rather  than  production \ntargets\u2014motivates the policy measures and public actions identified for the SEDP.  \n \n55. \nImplementation  of  the  CPRGS  over  the  past  2  years  has  been  \u2019rolled  out,\u2019  i.e., \ndecentralized,  with  more  ownership  of  MPI  and  local  government  line  ministries.  The  roll-out \nwas  started  with  32  subnational  governments.  With  collaborative  MPI-province-aid  activities \nunder  way  in  18  provinces,  supported  by  10  funding  agencies,  skills  are  being  built  to  enable \nnational and subnational governments to adjust to a more bottom-up style of planning. This will \nbe important over the next year as provincial authorities seek to implement the Prime Minister\u2019s \ndirective  for  a  more  participatory,  evidence-based,  and  bottom-up  planning  process.  These \nchanges  locate  the  responsibility  for  identifying  strategic  actions  for  growth  and  poverty \nreduction  where  much  of  the  responsibilities  for  allocating  public  resources  are  provincial. \nExperience  with  the  CPRGS  implementation  has  been  mixed.  At  a  recent  meeting  of  the \nPoverty Task Force,23 representatives from the more advanced provinces described a planning \n\n                                                 \n23  Poverty Task Force meeting in Hanoi, October 2004 and April 2005. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n17  \n\n \n\nrenovation process that incorporates a more strategic thinking, results-oriented and participatory \napproach. Some provinces have already organized training courses to prepare officials in those \nareas.  However,  planning  reform  that  changes  the  whole  mindset,  skills,  and  approach  away \nfrom more centrally directed approaches is challenging. Thus, MPI proposed to expand the roll-\nout  process  in  all  provinces  and  cities  based  on  the  experience  and  lessons  learned,  which \nidentified the need for more attention to capacity building. This will be important and essential \nfor maintaining momentum. \n\n \nThe preparation of the 2006\u20132010 SEDP provides an opportunity to strengthen national \n56. \nand  provincial  planning.  Directive  33  instructs  that  CPRGS  principles  be  incorporated  into  the \nSEDP. Not only does this bode well for modernizing national planning, but it holds promise for \nprovincial plans. Over the last 2 years, 20 provinces have experimented with preparing strategic \nplans,  in  the  context  of  an  aid-supported  initiative  to  implement  the  CPRGS  at  subnational \nlevels.  Based  on  the  experience  and  lessons  learned  from  the  ongoing  process,  MPI  has \nproposed to scale up the roll-out process in all provinces and cities in Viet Nam. Because of the \nongoing decentralization process, local governments will play an increasingly important role in \nattaining national development goals. Roughly half of budget spending is now under the control \nof provinces, districts, and communes. The success of decentralization, and the ability to keep \ndevelopment  inclusive,  will  crucially  depend  on  the  ability  of  local  governments  to  embrace \nstrategic  planning,  leading  to  sound  policy  choices,  supported  by  commensurate  budget \nallocations, and monitored through an appropriate set of provincial development indicators. \n\n57. \nDisclosure  requirements  for  the  state  budget  at  all  levels,  as  well  as  for  entities  using \nstate  budget  resources,  have  been  considerably  strengthened.  The  regulation  is  applicable  to \nfunds financed by state budget resources, such as the Development Assistance Fund, Viet Nam \nSocial Security, provincial investment funds, SOEs, and organizations financed by contributions \nfrom the public. Under the regulation, allocation norms approved by the National Assembly and \nthe People\u2019s Councils must be publicized at each budget level. Organizations funded from the \nstate  budget  must  disclose  their  state  budget  support,  budget  plans  and  final  accounts,  and \nmethods  used  to  determine  their  state  budget  support.  For  state  capital  investment  projects, \nannual  budget  allocations,  budget  plans,  final  accounts,  and  bidding  results  for  procurement \nmust  be  disclosed.  Funds  financed  by  the  state  budget  must  make  public  their  charters, \nfinancial  arrangements,  annual  financial  plan,  and  operational  performance.  For  SOEs, \nmandatory  disclosure  includes  their  financial  position,  operational  performance,  provision  for \nand use of welfare funds, remittances to the state budget, per employee income, and return on \nstate  equity.  Methods  of  disclosure  include  announcements  at  public  meetings,  printed \ndocuments,  posting  at  offices  and  websites,  and  publicity  through  the  mass  media.  Ministries \nand  provincial  People\u2019s  Committees  are  responsible  for  monitoring  compliance  of  their \nsubordinate bodies. The normal requirement for responses to questions regarding disclosures is \nwithin 10 days. \n\n58. \nThe launching of a comprehensive assessment of the fiscal risks associated with SOEs, \nSOCBs,  and  the  Development  Assistance  Fund  signals  the  Government\u2019s  intention  to  venture \ninto more active management of assets and liabilities. Much of the focus has been on estimating \nthe  share  of  NPLs  in  the  portfolios  of  commercial  banks  and  policy-lending  institutions.  A \nsomewhat implicit assumption is that the delinquent debtors, most of them SOEs, do not have \nthe ability to repay their debts. However, not servicing the debts is not the same as not making \nprofits. More importantly, most of the delinquent SOEs are occupying prime land, whose sale or \nlease could be an important source of revenue. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n    \n\nThe newly acquired independence of the State Audit of Viet Nam (SAV), which is now an \n59. \nagency established under the National Assembly, is a milestone for transparency. The SAV law \napproved in May 2005, gives the National Assembly the authority to appoint, and if necessary to \ndismiss,  the  auditor  general.  SAV  reports  that  have  been  approved  by  the  National  Assembly \nwill  be  publicly  disclosed  through  several  channels,  including  the  official  gazette,  the  SAV \nwebsite, and mass media. This is in sharp contrast with the situation that prevailed previously, \nwhen audit findings were not made public except with government authorization. In this context \nof increased transparency, the audit of SBV financial statements for 2003 was launched in April \n2004,  and  the  Government  intends  to  submit  a  copy  of  the  audit  report  to  the  National \nAssembly. \n\n60. \nThe  move  to  increase  transparency  is  reflected  in  the  emerging  approach  to  fighting \ncorruption.  The  appointment  of  the  Government  Inspectorate  as  the  leading  agency  for  the \npreparation  of  a  new  anticorruption  strategy  has  been  associated  with  an  invitation  to \ndevelopment agencies to cooperate with its implementation. Previous efforts to curb corruption \nfocused  on  punitive  measures,  rather  than  on  rigorous  diagnoses  and  systemic  remedies. \nLaunching the first comprehensive study on the modalities and mechanisms of corruption in Viet \nNam  took  years,  with  little  information  about  this  study  being  filtered  to  outsiders.  In  sharp \ncontrast, the findings of pilot surveys in seven cities are being brought to the mid-2005 informal \nConsultative Group meeting for discussion with development partners, jointly with a framework \nto ask for support with key components of the emerging anticorruption approach. A call to the \nmedia  to  be  more  proactive  in  the  investigation  and  reporting  of  corrupt  acts  suggests  that \ntransparency is seen as an important component of the new approach. \n\nThe  criteria  for  measuring  poverty  have  been  brought  into  line  with  international \n61. \nstandards. Based on the recommendations of a task force led by the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, \nand  Social  Affairs  and  the  General  Statistics  Office  (GSO),  an  expenditure-based  poverty  line \nwill  be  estimated  using  GSO\u2019s  Viet  Nam  household  living  standards  survey.  The  poverty  line \ncomprises a food component, which is the value of a typical basket of food items in Viet Nam \nproviding 2,100 calories per person per day, and a nonfood component. The latter is the value \nof a set of basic nonfood items that are typically consumed by people whose food expenditures \nare around the food poverty line. The earlier method combined a participatory approach with a \nrudimentary  survey  to  estimate  household  incomes  of  those  generally  considered  poor.  The \nparticipatory approach consists of village consultations to classify households according to their \npoverty status. While this method accurately identified the poorest of the poor households it did \nnot  necessarily  identify  all  the  poor.  The  methodology  was  inconsistently  applied  across \nprovinces and was subject to manipulation by provinces who wished to report faster progress. \n\nC. \n\nImportant Features \n\nA social and poverty impact assessment was undertaken in relation to the program loan \n62. \n(a  summary  is  in  Appendix  6  and  additional  details  in  Supplementary  Appendix  A).  The \nassessment concludes that the activities will have no adverse impacts on indigenous people or \nhave gender implications. The loan will not involve land acquisition and/or resettlement.  \n\n63. \nAn  environmental  assessment  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with \nthe  program  loan  policy  matrix  is  available  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  The  assessment \nreveals that most policy reforms will produce positive impacts on urban and rural environments. \nMost  reforms  aimed  to  improve  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency.  While  not \nspecifically  designed  for  environmental  protection,  these  reforms  tend  to  promote  optimal  and \nefficient  use  of  resources,  including  natural  resources.  Some  reforms  aim  to  improve \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n19  \n\n \n\nenvironmental  protection  and  management;  and  some  aim  to  improve  health  and  education, \nwhich  tend  to  have  indirect  positive  impacts  on  environmental  sustainability.  These  reforms  fit \nwell  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  environmental  policy  needs,  and  are  therefore  considered  practical  and \nnecessary next steps for the nation\u2019s environmental management framework.  \n\n64. \nSome  policy  reforms  will  likely  have  no  impact  on  the  environment.  These  include \nreforms related to public financial management and financial sector reform. These could have a \npositive  \u201ctrickle-down\u201d  effect.  The  reforms  related \nintegration,  private  sector \ndevelopment, and SOE reform may cause indirect negative impacts if they lead to pressure on \nthe environment and natural resources due to increased economic activities. The links between \nsuch  indirect  positive  and  negative  impacts  cannot  easily  be  evaluated  or  monitored.  No \nenvironmental impact assessment has been conduced to evaluate the policy implications of the \nViet Nam\u2019s WTO accession and the CPRGS.  \n\ntrade \n\nto \n\n \n\nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\nPolicy  measures  supported  by  PRSC  4,  such  as  the  safety  net  for  redundant  SOE \n65. \nworkers, restructuring of SOCBs, or the creation of provincial program Health Care for the Poor, \nrequire  additional  spending.  These  are  costly  and  PRSC-specific  programs.  The  cost  of \nadjustment  of  the  PRSC  is  therefore  greater  than  the  cost  of  these  four  items.  While  total \ngovernment revenue is increasing from US$10.5 billion in 2004 to US$11.3 billion in 2005, the \ntotal  budget  expenditure  is  increasing  even  faster  from  US$13.3  billion  in  2004  to  US$15.2 \nbillion in 2005. The financing needs are increased from US$1.5 billion in 2004 to US$2.1 billion \nin 2005. The external financing needs for 2005 (including grants) is estimated at US$1.4 billion, \nresulted from the financing needs less revenue carried over from 2004 and domestic borrowing. \nThe  cost  estimate  for  financing  requirements  for  PRSC  activities  includes  the  cost  of  some \nspecific  PRSC-related  programs  and  the  external  financing  need  of  US$1.4  billion.  The \nestimated costs of some specific PRSC-related programs for the 2005 budget add up to about \nUS$770  million,  i.e.,  (i)  health  funds  for  the  poor\u2014about  US$90  million  due  to  expanded \ncoverage  of  beneficiaries  according  to  the  new  poverty  definition;  (ii)  increased  spending  on \neducation proportional to the Government budget\u2014about US$400 million; and (iii) social safety \nnet  program  for  the  retrenched  SOE  workers  that  covers  more  than  50,000  workers\u2014at  least \nUS$80  million;  and  (iv)  resolution  of  nonperforming  loans  and  other  related  costs\u2014about \nUS$200 million. \n \nE.  \n \n66. \nODA  resources  of  approximately  US$225  million  are  expected  to  fund  PRSC  4 \noperations, led by the World Bank, which has already approved a US$100 million credit from the \nInternational Development Association to support PRSC 4. Three other cofinanciers will provide \nsupport in the form of concessional loans in parallel, namely ADB (US$15 million), Japan Bank \nfor  International  Cooperation  (US$22.8  million  equivalent  loan),  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (\u20ac10 million). The remaining seven cofinanciers will contribute financial support \nas  grants,  channeling  the  fund  to  the  multi-aid  trust  fund.  These  donors  include  Agencia \nEspa\u00f1ola  de  Cooperaci\u00f3n  Internacional  (\u20ac2  million),  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency  (Can$6.0  million),  Denmark  (US$10.8  million  equivalent),  European  Commission  (\u20ac8 \nmillion), Ireland (\u20ac1.5 million), Netherlands (\u20ac8 million), and DFID (\u20a420 million). \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n67. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  US$15  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources  as  ADB\u2019s  support  to  CPRGS  implementation  of  the  following  policy  framework  of \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n    \n\nPRSC  4  program.  The  program  loan  would  contribute  to  financing  the  cost  of  adjustment \nresulting from implementing the policy matrix, particularly the prior actions for PRSC 4, and to \nsupporting  and  facilitating  the  Government\u2019s  continued  and  deepened  reform  program  for \npoverty reduction. The loan will be disbursed upon declaration of loan effectiveness. \n \n68. \nThe loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The loan proceeds may be used to finance \neligible imports incurred within 180 days prior to the date of loan effectiveness. The loan closing \ndate will be 31 December 2006. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n69. \nSBV  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  program  is  being  implemented  through  24  line \nministries  and  government  agencies  in  accordance  with  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  ODA  fund \nraised through the PRSC process and providing resources to the state budget to implement the \nreforms,  and  the  PRSC  operations  serve  as  effective  coordination  devices  between  the \nGovernment and large number of cofinancers. On behalf of the Government, SBV coordinated \nthe  overall  processing  of  PRSC  4,  while  the  World  Bank  coordinated  the  process  for  the \ndevelopment partners. The number of cofinanciers has been continuously increasing\u2014from four \nin the case of PRSC 1 approved in 2002 to 10 for PRSC 4. The cofinancers have participated in \nthe PRSC process by forming working groups with the Government, which cover all economic \npolicy  areas.  ADB,  DFID,  and  World  Bank  rotate  as  cochairs  of  the  Poverty  Working \nGroup/Poverty  Task  Force  with  MPI.  Staff  of  the  ADB  resident  mission  actively  participate  in \nseveral other working groups including Partnership to Support the National Target Program, Viet \nNam Business Forum, People\u2019s Participation Working Group, and Public Administrative Reform \nPartnership.  Given  the  comprehensive  nature  of  the  PRSC  reform  process  and  the  ever-\ngrowing  number  of  cofinanciers,  in  January  2005  SBV  established  the  Program  Coordination \nUnit,  which  is  comprised  of  competent  staff.  It  deals  with  the  program  agenda,  including \nmonitoring  and  reporting,  awareness  raising,  capacity  building,  and  reform  outcome \ndissemination.  The  unit  has  frequently  interacted  with  the  World  Bank  and  the  cofinanciers  of \nPRSC 4, including ADB. \n \n70. \nThe  National  Steering  Committee  for  implementation  of  the  CPRGS  and  PRSCs  is  led \nby  the  deputy  prime  minister  in  charge  of  economic  reforms,  and  consists  of  representatives \nfrom  relevant  line  ministries  and  government  agencies.  SBV  is  assigned  as  the  agency \nresponsible,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  World  Bank,  for  preparing  and  implementing  the \nPRSCs.  An  SBV  deputy  governor  acts  as  standing  vice  chair  of  the  National  Steering \nCommittee.  This  quasi-advisory  body  has  several  representatives  from  key  ministries \nrepresenting the policy reform areas under PRSC 4 and subsequent PRSCs. Among the goals \nof the interministerial working group is subnational implementation of the CPRGS. The CPRGS \nSecretariat  at  MPI  supports  provincial  governments  in  adapting  the  CPRGS  to  their  own \ncontext,  and  reformulating  plans  and  budgets  accordingly.  Several  provinces24  have  already \nstarted  implementing  pilot  projects  to  (i)  build  capacity  of  provincial  officials  on  new  planning \nmethods,  and  (ii)  form  working  groups  to  carry  out  policy  dialogue.  At  present,  more  than  20 \nprovinces are going through this process, with financial support from development partners.  \n\n                                                 \n24  Ten pilot projects are being implemented in 10 provinces, of which 5 projects are administered by the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural Development and the other five by the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment.   \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n21  \n\n \n\n \n71. \nPRSC  operations  have  been  cofinanced  by  several  bilateral  and  multilateral  agencies, \neither  through  grants  or  parallel  lending.  The  role  of  cofinanciers  has  been  transformed  from \nproviders of finance to reform partners. Cofinanciers have collectively and substantially engaged \nin  the  preparation  of  the  operations  and  the  policy  dialogue  with  government.  The  dialogue  is \norganized  by  policy  areas,  in  which  development  partners  engage  selectively,  based  on  their \ninterests and technical capacity.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n72.  The program period will be from 30 June 2005 to 31 December 2006. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n73. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \nlocal  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loan,  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  disbursed  to  Viet \nNam as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, if during each year \nthat  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be  disbursed,  the  value  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  total  imports  minus \nimports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official \ndevelopment  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be \ndisbursed  during  such  year.  The  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with \neach  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be \nrequired. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification \n \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n74. \nThe loan will be disbursed in a single tranche, contingent upon loan effectiveness. The \nloan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  for  a  broad  range  of  imports,  subject  to  a  negative  list  of \nineligible  items  (Appendix  7).  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  on  the  basis  of  a  certification \nprovided by the Government that the value of total imports minus (i) imports from nonmember \ncountries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed under other ODA, is equal to or greater \nthan the amount expected to be disbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Borrower's  certification.  As  such,  the \nprocedures for procurement and disbursement of funds, and the user of counterpart funds are \nfelt to be satisfactory.   \n \nVarious  measures  have  been  taken  to  ensure  that  the  overall  fiduciary  policies  and \n75. \ninstitutions  are  adequate  to  proceed  with  support  from  the  proposed  program  lending.  The \nanalytical underpinnings for the operation are largely complete: (i) the crosscutting assessment \nof  the  country\u2019s  development  policies  (social,  structural,  and  sectoral)  covering  the  policy \nreforms and institutional development priorities for sustainable growth and poverty reduction has \nbeen discussed with the Government in a number of recent joint reports; (ii) an assessment of \nthe country financial accountability arrangements has been made in the World Bank\u2019s following \nassessments:  Public  Expenditure  Review-Integrated  Fiduciary  Assessment  (PER-IFA),  the \nCountry  Financial  Accountability  Assessment,  and  the  Country  Procurement  Assessment \nReview. In addition, the implementation arrangements adopted for the loan have been effective. \nThe  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment  (5  October  2001)  concluded  that  the  public \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n    \n\nfinancial  management  system  then  represented  some  level  of  fiduciary  risk.  However,  since \n2001  many  Country  Financial  Accountability  Assessment  recommendations  have  been \nimplemented, or are in the process of being implemented. The PER-IFA (May 2005) reviewed \nthe accounting and reporting process in the public sector, the oversight functions in the public \nsector, and financial reporting and auditing in SOEs. The PER-IFA recognizes recent changes \nto improve transparency and accountability, including the new Audit Law passed by the National \nAssembly in May 2005. This law will significantly enhance oversight by the National Assembly \nand  the  provincial  People\u2019s  Councils  over  public  finances  and  substantially  increase  public \naccess  to  information  on  government  finances.  SBV\u2019s  data  management,  financial  reporting, \nand  internal  control  system  are  also  expected  to  be  improved  through  a  planned  World  Bank \nInternational Development Association credit in 2006. The implementation of the Treasury and \nBudget  Management  Information  System  to  support  establishment  of  an  integrated  financial \nmanagement  system  is  expected  to  improve  financial  management  in  the  public  sector.  The \nPER-IFA  identifies,  however,  a  large  agenda  for  improvement.  The  key  areas  include \nstrengthening  SAV  effectiveness,  streamlining  the  internal  control  framework,  and  adopting \ninternational  public  sector  accounting  standards. \nthe  PER-IFA \nrecommendations is being supported by the PRSC program and other World Bank grant funds. \n\nImplementation  of \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nThe Government will prepare and provide semiannual progress reports on the program \n76. \nloan. ADB will participate in all joint assessments by the Government and development partners \non  the  outcomes  of  PRSC  4  and  PRSC  5  triggers  (measures  and  actions).  Details  are \npresented the program framework in Appendix 1. \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n77. \nViet  Nam  continues  to  make  good  use  of  information  and  analysis  in  its  policy  making \nand development of individual components of the PRSC program. PRSC 4 continues to build on \nthis  experience,  streamlining  the  numerous  ongoing  monitoring  and  evaluation  initiatives.  Key \nsources  of  monitoring  information  for  poverty  and  program  outcomes  include  the  proposed \nbiannual  household  living  standard  survey,  periodic  participatory  poverty  assessments,  small \nbusiness  registration  survey,  public  expenditure  tracking  survey,  as  well  as  quarterly  progress \nreports from the relevant sector ministries and committees implementing the reform program.  \n \n78. \nEfforts for national and provincial implementation of the CPRGS rely on the development \nof  appropriate  monitoring  indicators.  Gradually,  the  number  of  indicators  for  monitoring  the \nCPRGS, including monitoring development outcomes for VDGs, has been narrowed to around \n140,  of  which  40  were  proposed  to  provinces  to  choose.  These  narrower  indicators  were \nmerged with 285 indicators of the national statistical system collected by GSO, which are partly \ngenerated  by  the  household  living  standard  surveys.  The  recent  survey  in  2004  by  GSO  will \nprovide information for many indicators in the system. However, despite the efforts to refine the \nindicator system, line ministries do not agree on about 47 indicators and GSO considers 16 as \nunknown.25 The indicators for monitoring the SEDP have not been specified as integration of the \nCPRGS into the SEDP is in progress. In that context, for monitoring arrangements, ADB, World \nBank,  and  UNDP  are  doing  some  joint  work  to  strengthen  monitoring  system  for  the  CPRGS \nand SEDP, which will give definite results to monitor outcomes of the PRSCs.  \n\n                                                 \n25  TA  4612-VIE  (ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  Results-based \nMonitoring of Poverty Reduction and Growth. Manila) UNDP has also been implementing a US$1.6-million project \nfor strengthening capacity of statistical system. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n23  \n\n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nthrough \n\n79. \nThe  proposed  program  loan  will  benefit  Vietnamese  people  and  businesses  in  three \nfronts.  First,  through  policy  actions  addressing  transition  to  a  market  economy,  the  benefits \ninclude  increased  efficiency,  rapid  economic  growth,  and  job  creation.  The  reforms  under  this \npillar aim to move the economy toward greater competition and faster integration with the world \neconomy.  This  entails  policy  actions  aimed  at  gaining  accession  to  WTO,  accelerating  the \ndivestiture  of  SOEs  and  SOCBs,  adopting  a  more  determined  approach  to  banking  reform, \nimproving  the  business  environment,  and  introducing  the  regulatory  bodies  for  infrastructure \nservices.  Second,  through  policy  actions  addressing  social  inclusion  and  environmental \nsustainability,  the  benefits  include  improved  quality  of  education  (especially  in  poor  areas), \nthe \navailability  of  medicines  at  affordable  prices,  secured  asset  ownership \nimplementation  of  the  new  Land  Law,  and  more  sustainable  management  of  forests  and \nimproved  environmental  quality.  Third,  through  policy  actions  addressing  modern  governance, \nthe  benefits  are  increased  transparency  and  accountability  of  public  finances,  and  improved \nlegal  transparency  and  accessibility.  These  were  to  be  achieved  through,  among  others, \nfinancial  disclosure  of  all  state  budget  entities,  independence  of  the  State  Audit,  increased \neffectiveness of anticorruption actions, and improved information systems especially in relation \nto  poverty  measurement  and  targeting,  piloting  of  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework, \nand decentralized public investment decisions to lower levels of government.  \n \n80. \nThree  potential  risks  are  associated  with  the  proposed  program  loan:  containment  of \ncontingent liability, social inclusion and environment sustainability, and a fiduciary risk related to \npublic financial management. First, the ambitious economic growth target could be a source of \npressure to expand commercial and policy loans for infrastructure development especially in the \nlocal levels, without proper appraisal. The overall quality of lending may be undermined by such \npressure,  thereby  undermining  the  banking  reform  agenda  and  leading  to  a  build-up  of \ncontingent liabilities. Second, some key service delivery programs are underfunded even though \npolicies  in  health  and  education  aim  to  target  the  poor  and  improve  the  quality  of  service \ndelivery. While service providers were given incentives to charge fees, they are not accountable \nto provide basic services at low or no fee. To protect the environment, increasingly sophisticated \nlegislation and its implementation are needed to ensure effective administrative, economic, and \ninformation tools. Third, while gains have been made in budget transparency and execution, the \nmanagement  of  state  assets  and  liabilities  will  need  much  improvement.  Concerns have  been \nraised regarding the rapidly emerging and fast-growing provincial investment funds, which suffer \nlimited  transparency  and  accountability.  While  the  Government  is  working  toward  effective \nanticorruption measures, a rapid growing economy and the opportunities for graft could outpace \nimprovements and efforts in anticorruption policies. \n \nThe  Government  is  aware  of  the  potential  risks.  Through  appropriate  measures  and \n81. \nproactive  programs  during  the  program  implementation,  the  Government  will  take  into \nconsideration risk-mitigating measures. ADB along with other PRSC cofinanciers have provided \ntechnical  assistance  and  conducted  analytical  studies  to  help  policymakers  formulate  and \nexecute  mitigating  and  corrective  measures  in  anticipation  of  these  potential  risks.  The  risk \nrelated  to  growing  contingent  liabilities  could  be  addressed  by  enhancing  the  credibility  of \ngovernment  policies  regarding  nonperforming  loans,  and  strengthening  the  commercial \norientation and  autonomy  of  SOCBs  with  decisive  policy  actions.  Through  the  PRSC  process, \nthe  Government  decided  to  adopt  a  loan  classification  based  on  international  accounting \nstandards. The second risk related to social inclusion and environmental sustainability could be \naddressed through improvements in data availability and analytical work on issues arising from \n\n \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n    \n\nrural-urban  disparities  included  as  part  of  the  PRSC  process.  Regarding  environment \nsustainability,  the  country  environmental  assessment  and  the  PRSC  policy  actions  on  land, \nwater,  and  environmental  protection  should  help  mitigate  the  risk.  Finally,  the  fiduciary  risk \nrelated to public financial management caused by uncontrollable corruption could be addressed \nby  initiatives  that  provide  effective  counter  mechanisms.  A  comprehensive  diagnostic  of \ncorruption and its modality will be finalized and publicly disclosed. An anticorruption law, to be \npassed  by  the  National  Assembly  in  November  2005,  will  introduce  stronger  accountability \nrequirements  for  heads  of  agencies,  monitoring  of  assets  of  senior  government  officials  and \ntheir families, and introduction of a more effective whistle-blowing mechanism. The Government \nhas also encouraged the media to apply more proactive approaches in detecting and reporting \non corruption issues.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the State Bank of Viet Nam \n\n82. \nhave given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  measures  and  actions  included  in  the  program  and  specified  in  the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and the policy matrices will continue to be in effect for \nthe sustainability of the poverty reduction program under the CPRGS and PRSC \nframeworks; and \nAdequate and timely counterpart funds will be available for the implementation of \nthe poverty reduction program under PRSC 4. \n\n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n83. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights  10,349,000  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  to  Support  the \nImplementation of the Poverty Reduction Program II from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter;

The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS)1 is the outcome of \nextensive  discussions,  stakeholder  consultations,  and  review  work  undertaken  by  the \nGovernment, working closely with development agencies through the Poverty Task Force. The \nformulation of the CPRGS was coordinated by the CPRGS Secretariat based in the Ministry of \nPlanning  and  Investment  and  supported  by  several  official  development  assistance  (ODA) \npartners, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n2.  The CPRGS, approved by the Prime Minister in May 2002, translated the vision of a market \neconomy  with  a  socialist  orientation  presented  in  the  Ten-Year  Socioeconomic  Development \nStrategy  for  2001\u20132010  into  concrete  public  actions.  Unlike  previous  planning  documents,  the \nCPRGS  is  focused  and  clearly  defines  development  targets,  identifies  appropriate  policies  to \nattain  those  targets,  and  aligns  resources  to  those  policies.  The  country\u2019s  development  goals, \nwhich  are  a  local  version  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  are  among  the  key  targets \npursued  in  the  CPRGS  (Table  A2).  In  2003,  the  CPRGS  was  expanded,  with  a  thorough \ndiscussion of the role of large infrastructure in promoting economic and social development. \n \n3.  The  CPRGS  provides  a  framework  for  poverty  reduction  policies,  programs,  and  actions \n(Figure  A2.1).  The  ODA  community  has  adopted  the  CPRGS  as  the  reference  document  for \nplanning and formulating external assistance.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Inter-Ministerial  Working  Group  of  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy.  2002.

The  policy  actions  supported  through  the  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Credit  (PRSC) \nprocess  can  be  seen  as  a  distillation  of  the  CPRGS  and  other  development  strategies  and \nplans. The PRSC policy actions aimed to identify a coherent sequence of key measures in each \narea  over  the  medium  term.  The  identification  of  the  policy  actions  needed  to  attain  the \ndevelopment  outcomes  spelled  out  in  the  CPRGS  is  strongly  influenced  by  the  CPRSG \nprogress reports, funding agencies\u2019 analytical work carried out in recent years. The annual Viet \nNam Development Reports have played a very important role in this respect. These reports are \nprepared in partnership by the World Bank and other development partners, including ADB. In \naddition  to  these  CPRGS-PRSC-related  studies  and  reports,  sector  work  reports  and \nassessments done under sector-based programs/projects of each development partner provide \ninput  to  ensure  the  complementary  and  efficiency  of  the  PRSC  reform  agenda.  Figure  A2.2 \nbelow  illustrates  the  timing  and  relation  of  the  strategy,  implementation,  analyses,  and  sector \nwork.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation and Monitoring  \n\n \n5.  Formulation  of  policy  reforms  and  programs  under  the  CPRGS  involves  many  ministries \nand  is  coordinated  by  the  National  Steering  Committee.  The  committee  is  led  by  the  deputy \nprime minister in charge of economic reforms, and comprises representatives from relevant line \nministries  and  government  agencies.  The  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV)  is  assigned  as  the \nagency  responsible,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  World  Bank,  for  preparation  and \nimplementation of PRSCs. A deputy governor of SBV acts as standing vice chair of the National \nSteering Committee. This quasi-advisory body has several representatives from key ministries \nrepresenting the policy reform areas under PRSC 4 and subsequent PRSCs. Among the goals \nof the interministerial working group is subnational implementation of the CPRGS. The CPRGS \nSecretariat at Ministry of Planning and Investment supports provincial governments in adapting \nthe  CPRGS  to  their  own  context,  and  reformulating  plans  and  budgets  accordingly.  Several \nprovinces2  have  already  started  implementing  pilot  projects  to  (i)  build  capacity  of  provincial \nofficials on new planning methods, and (ii) form working groups to carry out policy dialogue. At \npresent,  more  than  20  provinces  are  going  through  this  process,  with  financial  support  from \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n6.  SBV is responsible for formulating and implementing the PRSCs. To improve consultation \nand coordination with all stakeholders and to promote public discussion of the PRSCs, given the \ncomprehensive  nature  of  the  PRSC  reform  process  and  the  ever-growing  number  of \ncofinanciers,  in  January  2005  SBV  established  a  program  coordination  unit,  comprising \ncompetent  staff.  This  unit  deals  with  program  agenda,  including  monitoring  and  reporting, \nawareness  raising,  capacity  building,  and  reform  outcome  dissemination.  The  unit  has \nfrequently interacted with the World Bank and the cofinanciers of PRSC 4, including ADB. The \ndevelopment  partners  have  participated  in  the  PRSC  process  by  forming  working  groups  with \nthe  Government,  including  all  economic  policy  areas.  ADB,  Department  for  International \nDevelopment,  and  the  World  Bank  rotate  to  cochair  the  Poverty  Working  Group/Poverty  Task \nForce with the Ministry of Planning and Investment.

Key  monitoring  programs  for  measuring  impact  on  poverty  include  the  household \nliving  standard  survey,  periodic  participatory  poverty  assessments,  small  business  registration \nsurvey,  public  expenditure  tracking  survey,  as  well  as  quarterly  progress  reports  from  the \nrelevant  sector  ministries  and  committees  implementing  the  reform  program.  The  Government \npresents its annual CPRGS progress report in December at the Consultative Group meeting. \n\n \n4. \n\nFinancing \n\n \n7.  ODA resources of approximately US$225 million are expected to fund PRSC 4 operations. \nLed  by  the  World  Bank,  which  has  already  approved  a  US$100  million  credit  from  the \nInternational  Development  Association  to  support  PRSC  4,  the  other  three  cofinanciers  will \nprovide support in the form of concessional loans, namely ADB (US$15 million), Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  (US$22.8  million  equivalent  loan),  and  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (\u20ac10 million). The remaining seven cofinanciers will contribute financial support \nas grants. They include Agencia Espa\u00f1ole de Cooperaci\u00f3n International (\u20ac2 million), Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency  (Can$6.0  million),  Denmark  (US$10.8  million  equivalent), \nEuropean  Commission  (\u20ac8  million),  Ireland  (\u20ac1.5  million),  Netherlands  (\u20ac8  million),  and  the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (\u20a420 million). \n \n\n5. \n\nProgress with Implementation \n\n \n8.  The  Government  has  steadily  pursued  its  reform  agenda.  It  recently  completed  the  first \nannual  progress  report  on  growth  and  reduction  of  poverty  for  2003\u20132004.  The  CPRGS \nprogress  report  was  presented  at  the  midterm  Consultative  Group  meeting  in  June  2005  and \nindicated  that  implementation  of  the  reform  agenda  was  on  schedule.  Although  considerable \nprogress in the transition to a market economy has been achieved, the Government recognizes \nthat to keep development inclusive and to modernize governance, important challenges remain. \nKey  recommendations  of  the  CPRGS  progress  report  include  (i)  improving  the  coordination \nbetween  the  ministries,  agencies,  and  provincial  governments  for  CPRGS  implementation;  (ii) \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  the  ministries,  agencies,  and  provincial  governments  in  the \npreparation  of  their  respective  5-year  plans  (2006\u20132010)  linking  with  the  CPRGS;  (iii) \nstrengthening data collection and analysis for plan implementation, monitoring, and evaluation; \n(iv) continuing to integrate the targets and policies of the strategy in the 5-year socioeconomic \nthe  annual  development  plan  2006;  (v) \ndevelopment  plan  (SEDP)  (2006\u20132010)  and \nstrengthening  the  participation  of  the  community/population  in  the  planning,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation  of  the  SEDP;  (vi)  designing  the  handbook  on  integrating  the  CPRGS  in  the  SEDP; \nand (vii) strengthening resource mobilization for implementing the objectives and targets of the \ndevelopment plan. The Government presented the Viet Nam Report 2005 on Implementation of \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals  and  Vietnam  development  goals.  This  report  is  still  in  the \nprocess of generating comments from various stakeholders, including development partners. In \nSeptember 2005 this report will be presented at the United Nations in New York. It is a laudable \neffort of the Government to finalize this specific report. \n \n9.  Over  the  last  12  months,  the  Government  has  adopted  many  substantive  actions  for \nimplementing  its  socioeconomic  reform  agenda.  It  has  taken  steps  for  trade  liberalization  in \npursuit of World Trade Organization (WTO) accession and integration with the world economy. \nThe  Government  has  substantially  accelerated  the  pace  of  ownership  transformation  of  state-\nowned  enterprises,  improved  the  transparency  and  accountability  in  the  financial  sector, \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nstrengthened  the  regulatory  framework  for  policy  lending  by  the  Government,  encouraged \ncompetition  in  telecommunications,  and  unified  corporate  tax  rates.  Several  initiatives  are \ncurrently under way to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Finance to exercise the state\u2019s \nshareholders rights. A production of more reliable data on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and \nstate-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) is much needed. \n \n10.  In  respect  of  social  inclusion  and  environmental  sustainability,  Viet  Nam  has  ensured \nappropriate budget allocation for education and for contribution to the provincial health funds for \nthe  poor;  raised  the  quality  standards  of  primary  education,  and  adopted  a  multisector  action \nprogram \nsyndrome/acquired \nimmunodeficiency  virus  (HIV/AIDS)  strategy.  To  improve  environmental  management,  the \nGovernment has implemented the polluter pays principle, issued regulations to handle the worst \npollution  offenders,  and  strengthened  the  environmental  assessment  capacity  of  local \nadministrations.  The  new  Land  Law\u2014effective  1  July  2004\u2014supports  access  to  land  for  all \nsectors  and  recognizes  community  land-use  practices\u2014an  important  issue  for  upland  and \nethnic minority areas.  \n\nits  national  human \n\nimmunodeficiency \n\nimplement \n\nto \n\n \n\nto \n\ntaken  measures \n\nthe  Government  has \n\n11.  To  build  modern  governance, \nincrease \ntransparency in public finances, improve financial accountability, and ensure dissemination of its \nlegal  documents  and  consultation  with  stakeholders.  It  continues  to  move  forward  on  public \nadministration reform by simplifying administrative procedures using the one-stop shop model. It \nhas taken steps to strengthen the public procurement process, and to curb abuses in business \ntransactions. The Government intends to integrate the CPRGS approach into future 5-year and \n1-year planning processes. A series of consultations on the SEDP (2006\u20132010) was conducted \nin  more  than  10  provinces  (ongoing  and  planned  including  Ben  Tre,  Cao  Bang,  Gia  Lai,  Hoa \nBinh,  Ninh  Binh,  Ninh  Thuan,  Quang  Tri,  and  Thua  Thien-Hue).  Preliminary  results  are \nencouraging since the quality of inputs/community feedbacks as well as the sense of ownership \nis  highly  appreciated  by  the  different  stakeholders  (i.e.,  provincial  governments,  agencies, \nprivate sector, and especially different groups of the communities). \n\n \n\nSocioeconomic Performance and Key Policy Issues  \n\nB. \n \n12.  The  overall  assessment  of  the  Government  shows  that  economic  growth  has  only  nearly \nreached  the  planned  targets  but  productivity  is  still  low.  Contribution  to  growth  mainly  comes \nfrom  capital  and  labor.  Though  scientific  and  technological  factors  have  been  promoted,  they \nonly  account  for  a  small  proportion.  The  current  quality  of  development  is  shown  in  three \naspects:  economically,  the  competitiveness  of  products  as  well  as  the  whole  economy  is  still \nlimited and weak; socially, social advances are not parallel to economic growth, social evils still \nprevail,  social  morality  worsens,  corruption  has  become  more  serious;  environmentally,  the \nenvironment has been badly polluted and ruined, as no effective solution has been found. \n \n13.  While  the  Government  has  had  great  success  in  reducing  poverty,  regional  income \ndisparity remains a concern. The recent DFID Vietnam Inequality Report 2005: Assessment and \nPolicy  Choices  (June  2005)  provides  new  insights  and  directions  for  pro-poor  and  pro-equity \ngrowth.  Key  \u201cdrivers  of  inequality\u201d  such  as  state-sector  bias,  urban  bias,  secondary  education \nbottleneck,  limited  access  to  safety  nets,  gender  bias,  multiple  reinforcing  vulnerabilities  of \nethnic  minorities,  and  corruption  will  provide  inputs  for  the  formulation  process  of  the  SEDP \n(2006\u20132010).  Coastal  development  and  further  urbanization  should  cater  to  the  employment \nneeds of the surplus labor coming from rural areas. This should also take into account possible \nrestructuring and modernization of the agriculture sector. \n \n\n\fAppendix 2                39 \n\n14.  Agriculture  continues  to  develop.  The  production  value  of  agriculture,  forestry,  and \nfisheries,  on  average,  has  increased  by  5.4%  for  the  past  5  years,  higher  than  the  planned \ntarget  of  4.8%.  The  production  value  of  agriculture  increased  by  4.0%,  forestry  by  1.3%, \nfisheries by 10.7%. The average added value of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries is 3.6% (the \ntarget  is  from  4.0%  to  4.3%).  Agricultural  production  has  moved  in  the  direction  of  producing \ngoods with higher quality and value, which is responsive to market demands. However as in the \npast,  agriculture  sector  growth  resulted  from  (i)  reliance  on  higher  input  use  (labor,  land, \nfertilizer,  tractors,  and  irrigation);  (ii)  policy  reforms  for  land,  markets,  and  trade;  and  (iii)  high \npublic investment, mainly in irrigation and roads. This strategy will not likely be able to sustain \ngrowth in the future because (i) the potential for expanding the rural labor force and land under \ncultivation is limited; (ii) new investment in irrigation exhibits decreasing marginal returns, as the \nstock of irrigation capital is already very high and requires increased operation and maintenance \nrather  than  new  expansion;  and  (iii)  net  revenue  from  rice  export  is  declining.  Viet  Nam  is \nalready  experiencing  overproduction  of  rice,  coffee,  and  other  commodities,  and  declining \nexport revenues from unprocessed primary commodities. \n  \n15.  The Government has made a good progress in specializing in a number of agriculture and \nfishery  products  (e.g.,  coffee,  shrimps,  catfish)  and  by  taking  advantage  of  increased  market \naccess to regional and international high-income countries. However, predominantly traditional \nfarming  practices  that  produce  relatively  low-value  crops  are  holding  back  further  success. \nAdvanced agriculture technology needs to be developed and disseminated. Agribusinesses and \nsmall-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  need  to  be  developed  for  agroprocessing  to  increase \nadded value. Credit delivery to farmers needs to be improved, with consideration for introducing \ncrop and livestock insurance schemes in collaboration with the private sector or by promoting a \nfull-fledged microfinance system. \n \n16.  Carefully  planned  and  efficiently  managed  large  infrastructure  projects  such  as  seaports, \nairports,  power  plants,  and  national  railways  and  roads  properly  linked  with  feeder  roads  can \nactively contribute to national socioeconomic development, as well as regional and international \neconomic  integration.  Nationally  and  subregionally  they  help  (i)  strengthen  linkages  between \npoor  and  developed  regions;  (ii)  provide  access  to  socioeconomic  opportunities  as  well  as \npublic  services;  (iii)  create  conditions  for  exploiting  local  resources  for  meeting  national, \nregional, and international demands; (iv) improve connectivity between people and businesses; \nand (v) eventually facilitate transformation of economic structures toward industrialization.  \n \n17.  The Government has emphasized the importance of large infrastructure development in the \ncontext  of  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  Infrastructure  development  also  has  a \nsubregional  dimension,  whereby  the  potential  demand  from  neighboring  countries/subregions \nshould  be  taken  into  account.  Development  of  large  infrastructure  will  require  large  capital \ninvestments.  Preliminary  estimates  suggest  that  in  total  the  Government  will  need  to  invest \nabout 35% of gross domestic product over the next 15 years to achieve the planned growth rate \nof  7.5%  per  year.3  Better  project  planning,  implementation,  and  management,  following \ninternationally accepted good practices, coupled with necessary policy and institutional reforms \nto facilitate trade (including customs- and immigration-related reforms) will be required to ensure \nthe expected net economic benefits are fully realized.   \n \n\n \n18.  In  the  country  the  realization  is  growing  that  serious  environmental  degradation  and \ninsufficient  investment  in  environmental  protection  and  management  are  beginning  to  impinge \n\n                                                 \n3   Based on the preliminary results of a recent joint study by the Government and ADB. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nreform \n\non the country\u2019s economic productivity. This could adversely affect economic competitiveness, \nresult  in  productivity  losses  due  to  pollution-related  health  problems  in  the  workforce,  and \nreduce the welfare and quality of life of the people. The Prime Minister approved the National \nStrategy for Environmental Protection until 2010 and Vision towards 2020 on 2 December 2003. \nThe strategy outlines the rapid deterioration of the environment and offers 36 priority programs \nto  strengthen  environmental  protection  through  the  expected  future  of  continued  rapid \nindustrialization and modernization. Viet Nam\u2019s Agenda 21 was approved in August 2004, and a \nnew, expanded environmental protection law is expected to be approved in 2005.  \n \n19.  To  achieve  efficient  management  of  its  development  process  and  poverty  reduction,  the \nGovernment  should  ensure  (i)  transparency  and  accountability  of  central  as  well  as  local \nbudget/spending;  (ii)  proper  accounting  and  auditing  of  public  revenue  and  expenditure;  (iii) \nsimplification  and  harmonization  of  internal  central  and  provincial  procedures;  (iv)  accelerated \nimplementation  of  public  administration \n(including  computerization  of  state \nadministration, and training of civil servants to build local capacity/capabilities); and (v) regular \nmonitoring and evaluation of development projects, involving beneficiaries and civil society.   \n \n20.  The  Government  is  preparing  a  new  5-year  SEDP  (2006\u20132010).  The  plan  will  be \nfundamentally different from the past 5-year plans. The next plan will anticipate further opening \nof the economy through implementation of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nFree Trade Area; bilateral agreements with the European Union, Japan, and the United States; \nand WTO commitments. This will result in increased access to regional and global markets, and \nincreased  external  competitive  pressure  (through  imports)  for  domestic  suppliers,  which  may \nresult  in  short-term  adjustment  costs  affecting  mainly  poor  households.  A  major  thrust  of  the \nnext 5-year plan should be on removing development weaknesses and exploiting the country\u2019s \nopportunities and strengths. \n  \n21.  On  the  macroeconomic  front,  prudence  is  required  to  ensure  stability  and  sustain  high \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Government  should  aim  to  achieve  economic \ngrowth \nimproving \ncompetitiveness  by  removing  inefficiencies,  and  maximizing  capacity  utilization  in  productive \nsectors);  and  (ii)  efficient  allocation  and  use  of  new  capital  investments  (i.e.,  health  and \neducation, infrastructure development, modernization and restructuring of agriculture, industry, \nand  service  sectors).  New  investments  should  ideally  be  maintained  around  35%  of  the  gross \ndomestic product, above this level may mean excess money supply leading to high inflation and \nother  associated  problems  as  the  economy  may  have  difficulty  absorbing  that  extent  of \nadditional capital deployment. \n \n22.  On  the  social  front,  income  disparity,  both  geographic  and  demographic,  will  increase  if \neconomic growth is not socially inclusive, and policy loopholes and weak governance continue. \nReducing  poverty  for  the  remaining  29%  of  the  population  will  become  increasingly  difficult. \nODA (i.e., grants and soft loans) should be targeted at developing remote areas and reducing \nchronic  poverty.  The  implementation  of  the  ASEAN  Free  Trade  Area  and  WTO  commitments \n(assuming  successful  WTO  accession  in  2005)  should  be  carefully  planned  and  monitored  to \nmitigate likely social costs. \n \n23.  The Government has indicated that the next 5-year plan will be integrated with the CPRGS \nand  the  master  program  for  public  administration  reform  (2001\u20132010).  This  would  mean  (i) \nintegrating CPRGS strategic and process elements into socioeconomic development planning, \nand  (ii)  strengthening  public  administration  to  efficiently  implement  Government  policies  and \nprovide public services to people and businesses.  \n\nfrom  (i)  more  efficient  utilization  of  existing  stock  of  capital  (i.e., \n\n\fAppendix 2                41 \n\n \n\n \n\nC.  \n\nChronology \n\nBackground \n\n1. \n \n\n24.  During the Country Programming Mission of ADB (15 April\u20134 May 2005), the Government \nformally  asked  ADB  to  provide  financing  for  implementation  of  the  CPRGS,4  under  the  multi-\ndevelopment  partner  assisted  PRSC  4  led  by  the  World  Bank.5  ADB,  recognizing  the \nimportance of this request and the Government\u2019s commitment to poverty reduction, responded \npositively.  Subsequently,  the  proposed  program  loan  was  considered  \u201cfirm\u201d  for  2004  in  the \nCountry Strategy and Program Update 2005,6 and endorsed by the ADB Board of Directors on \n30 August 2004.   \n\n \n\n25.  Preparatory  work  to  formulate  PRSC  4  was  initiated  in  September  2004  with  the \ninvolvement  of  key  development  partners  and  government  agencies.  ADB  was  invited  to \nparticipate  in  the  formulation  of  PRSC  4,  including  in  the  policy  discussions  and  negotiations \nwith the Government. On behalf of the Government, SBV coordinated the overall processing of \nPRSC 4. For the development partners, the formulation process was led by the World Bank. \n\n2. \n\nThe Program Loan Proposal Formulation Process \n\n \n26.  From the outset, the Government and the ADB mission recognized the very tight timetable \nwithin  which  the  ADB  loan  proposal  had  to  be  prepared,  and  the  need  to  ensure  that  the \nprogram  loan  proposal  be  conceived  as  substantive,  credible,  and  defensible.  From  the  ADB \nperspective, for a program loan proposal, the Government had to (i) demonstrate commitment \nand support at all government levels, and (ii) facilitate the fullest possible participation by all key \nstakeholders during the formulation and implementation of the program loan. These two crucial \nconditions were accomplished during PRSC 4 processing. \n   \n27.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  from  15  April\u20134  May  2005,  used  the  diagnostic  work  on  the \nissues and challenges that the Government is seeking to address in PRSC 4 under the CPRGS \nframework.  The  mission  identified  the  policy  and  institutional  measures,  actions,  and \nimplementation  arrangements  necessary  to  ensure  effective  CPRGS  implementation  utilizing \nODA  funding.  The  mission  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  and  other \ndevelopment partners on the objectives, scope, financing, and implementation arrangements for \nthe proposed loan. The Government proposed that the processing of the loan follow simplified \nprocedures  since  ADB  was  one  of  the  key  development  partners  that  had  participated  in  the \npreparation of the CPRGS and formulation of PRSC 4; PRSC 4 has already been approved by \nthe Government and the World Bank, and the Government would follow simplified procedures \nfor its internal processing and approval.  \n \n28.  To  reduce  transaction  costs  for  the  Government  and  ADB,  the  mission  pursued  the \npossibility of applying a program-based approach in close consultation with ADB\u2019s Strategy and \nPolicy  Department.  This  approach  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  recent  move  to  adopt  program-based \n\n                                                 \n4   Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2003.

The Borrower has made strong \nprogress in multilateral and bilateral \nnegotiations toward its World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) accession by \nreaching the stage for a full draft working \nparty report and completing bilateral \nnegotiations with six partners. \n \n \n \n\n2. The Borrower, through Prime \nMinister\u2019s Decision 155/2004/QD-Ttg of \n24 August 2004, has narrowed the list of \nsectors in which exclusive state \nownership is to be maintained. \n\nAccession to WTO requires agreements from all WTO \nmembers. In 1995 28 WTO members had not decided to \nsupport Viet Nam\u2019s bid for WTO accession. The Working Party \nwas established by the WTO in 1995 to support and monitor \nViet Nam\u2019s membership negotiation. The meetings between the \nWorking Party and Viet Nam\u2019s Negotiation Team (led by the \ninterministerial National Committee on International Economic \nCooperation) are held semiannually to address emerging issues \nand agree on specific points for Viet Nam\u2019s accession. The \nsemiannual meeting held in June 2004 marked a milestone that \nallowed Viet Nam to proceed and accelerate bilateral \nnegotiations with the 28 WTO members. Subsequent to the \nJune 2004 meeting, the Working Party released the Report of \nthe Working Party on the Accession of Viet Nam \n(WT/ACC/SPEC/VNN/5 22 November 2004), which captured \nthe general agreement between the multilateral Working Party \nand Viet Nam\u2019s Negotiation Team. As of end 2004, Viet Nam \ncompleted negotiations with 6 WTO members, including \nArgentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, European Union, and Singapore. \nOn 7 April 2005, the Working Party released a supplementary \ndocument, Additional Questions and Replies \n(WT/ACC/VNM/36). As of June 2005 when the World Bank \napproved Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) 4, Viet \nNam had completed bilateral negotiations with 11 more partners \nand as of mid-September 2005, 3 more, for a total of 20 \npartners. \n\nDecision 155/2004/QD-Ttg was issued to replace Decision \n58/2002/QD-Ttg issued by the Prime Minister on 26 April 2002. \nDecision 58 (i) specified criteria for classifying state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) and general corporations, and (ii) issued a \nlist of sectors where the state must retain 100% ownership or \nmore than 50% ownership. Decision 155 reduced the list of \nsectors to which full state control is justified. More and larger \nSOEs are now in the equitization category.   \n \n\n3. The Borrower, through Decree \n187/2004/ND-CP of 16 November 2004, \nhas strengthened mechanisms for \nequitization of SOEs, including by \nauctioning shares and requiring that \nvaluations be carried out by outside \nagencies. \n\nOn 16 November 2004, the Government issued Decree \n187/2004/ND-CP on the transformation of SOEs to joint stock \ncompanies, which eases the participation of outsiders, and \nimproves the valuation of SOE assets. Subsequently on 24 \nDecember 2004, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) issued Circular \n126/2004/TT-BTC giving the guidelines on the implementation \nof Decree 187.  \n\n4. SBV has confirmed the principle of \nseparation of its SOCB management \nfunctions from its supervisory functions.  \n\n \n\n \n\nOn 20 May 2005, the SBV governor sent the World Bank\u2019s \ncountry director a letter on the main orientation of banking \nreform in the next 5 years. The letter announced separation of \nSBV\u2019s management of SOCBs from its supervision functions. \nThis letter envisages the transformation of SBV into a modern \ncentral bank, charged with the conduct of monetary policy in \ncompliance with market principle and financial sector \nsupervision. The commercial orientation and autonomy of \nSOCBs is another key objective of this reform.  \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n  Appendix 4 \n\nAction/Condition \n\nProgress \n\n5. SBV has issued regulations applicable \nto all SOCBs requiring them to classify \nloans on the basis of international \naccounting standards \n\nOn 22 April 2005, the SBV Governor issued Decision \n493/2005/QD-NHNN on the regulations on loan classification, \nmaking of provisions, and utilization to address credit risks in \nbanking activities of credit institutions. In fact, these regulations \nare applicable to all commercial banks including SOCBs. \n\n6. The Electricity Law has been enacted \n(i) allowing equitization of Electricity of \nViet Nam subsidiaries, and (ii) \nestablishing an electricity regulatory \nagency. \n\nThe National Assembly passed the Electricity Law on 3 \nDecember 2004. The law became effective on 1 July 2005.  \n\n7. The Borrower, through the Ministry of \nEducation and Training, has completed \nthe evaluation of 7% of all teachers \nbased on the new Primary Teacher \nProfile for career development. \n\nThrough the World Bank\u2019s Primary Teacher Development \nProject, Ministry of Education and Training officials and World \nBank staff completed a preliminary assessment report, including \nan evaluation of all teachers based on the new Primary Teacher \nProfile (25,000 of 360,000 primary teachers) in May 2005. \n\n8. The Law on Forest Protection and \nDevelopment has been enacted. \n\nThe National Assembly passed the Law on Forest Protection \nand Development on 3 January 2005. The law became effective \non 1 April 2005.  \n\n9. The draft Amended Law on \nEnvironmental Protection has been \nsubmitted to the National Assembly for \napproval, and the draft implementing \ndecree has been submitted to the \nGovernment. \n\nThe draft Amended Law on Environment Protection was \nsubmitted to the National Assembly at the first session in May \n2005. It will be resubmitted for approval at the second session \nin November 2005. The draft decree guiding implementation of \nthe law and the draft decree on violation settlement were also \nsubmitted to the Government. Subsequent to the passage of \nthe amended law envisaged in November 2005, the two \ndecrees are expected to be issued in early 2006. \n\n10. The Borrower is integrating the \nComprehensive Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth Strategy (CPRGS) approach into \nthe preparation of the Socioeconomic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010, \nnamely the principles of strategic \nplanning, consultation, outcome \norientation, and monitoring. \n\nThe CPRGS approach: The SEDP has been prepared using the \nsame approach used for the preparation of the CPRGS: (i) \noutcome-oriented and results-based by setting specific Viet \nNam Development Goals to be achieved by the end of the 5-\nyear cycle, (ii) based on good analysis and background to \ngenerate good analytical documents, (iii) includes monitoring \nand evaluation mechanisms, and (iv) involves wide consultation \nwith all stakeholders.  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe progress: The results are evident in good quality of the \ndraft SEDP, completed in August 2005. The draft SEDP has \nbeen reviewed and commended by all the stakeholders, \nincluding the development community, civil society, and \ngrassroots communities. Consultation with the grassroots \ncommunities was conducted in nine provinces or more and in \nthree regional workshops. Most importantly, a results-policy \nframework was developed for the SEDP.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4                49 \n\nAction/Condition \n\nProgress \n\n11. The Borrower, through the Ministry of \nFinance, has issued regulations to \nimprove financial disclosure of all state \nbudget entities, including SOEs, requiring \namong other information, disclosure of \ntheir annual budget allocations, budget \nplans, and final accounts. \n\n1. On 16 November 2004, the Prime Minister issued Decision \n192/2004/QD-TTg on regulations on financial disclosure of all \nlevels of state budgets, state budgetary entities, state budget \nsupported organizations, basic construction projects using state \nbudget, state-owned enterprises and funds from state and \npeople\u2019s contribution sources.  \n \n \n2. On 6 January 2005, MOF issued Circular 03/2005/TT-BTC \nguiding the regulations on financial disclosure of all levels of \nstate budgets.  \n \n3. On 11 March 2005, MOF issued Circular 19/2005/TT-BTC \nissuing guidelines for financial disclosure of funds from state \nand people\u2019s contribution sources.   \n \n4. On 22 March 2005, MOF issued Circular 21/2005/TT-BTC \nguiding the implementation of regulations on financial \ndisclosure of state budgetary entities and state budget \nsupported organizations. \n \n5. On 14 April 2005, MOF issued Circular 29/2005/TT- BTC \nguiding the regulations on financial disclosure of SOEs. \n\nThe Government and the World Bank organized the Public \nExpenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment \n(PER-IFA) workshop (13\u201314 April 2005) in Danang City, Viet \nNam, to launch the assessment. On 4 May 2005, the joint \nGovernment-World Bank report on PER-IFA was published. \nThe PER-IFA recommended an assessment of fiscal risks \nassociated with SOEs, SOCBs, and the Development \nAssistance Fund.  \n\nOn 25 May 2005, the National Assembly passed the State Audit \nLaw, which transformed the State Audit into an independent \nspecialized agency established by the National Assembly. \n\nThe Research Institute of the Government Inspectorate \nformulated and completed an overview of the program to \nstrengthen comprehensive capacity of the Inspectorate system. \nIn addition, the Government Inspectorate completed an \nindicative action plan for the first year of the program (Quarter \n4, 2005 to Quarter 4, 2006). This overview program framework \nincludes a framework for government-aid cooperation on key \ncomponents of its emerging anticorruption approach. Results \nfrom the first comprehensive study on the modalities and \nmechanisms of corruption were presented to the development \npartners. \n\nOn 5 July 2005, the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs \nissued Document 2128/LDTBXH on the new poverty line for \n2006\u20132010. On 8 July 2005, the Prime Minister issued Decision \n170/2005/QD-TTg, which approved the new poverty line to be \napplied for 2006\u20132010. The criteria for measuring poverty and \ntargeting the poor were strengthened. The new poverty line is \nmore in line with international standards of poverty \nmeasurement. As a result, more people will be classified as \npoor and more people will be eligible to benefit from the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty targeted programs.   \n\n \n\n12. The Borrower has launched an \nassessment of the fiscal risks associated \nwith SOEs, SOCBs, and the \nDevelopment Assistance Fund. \n\n13.

The \nGovernment has been continuously formulating and implementing this economic reform agenda \nas  described  in  a  series  of  Government  strategies  and  plans.  The  most  comprehensive \nsummary  of  the  reform  agenda  is  presented  in  the  Ten-Year  Socio-Economic  Development \nStrategy (2001-2010). Key planning documents for the period covered by the ongoing cycle of \nPoverty  Reduction  Support  Credits  (PRSCs)  are  the  Five-Year  Socio-Economic  Development \nPlan  (SEDP)  2001-2005  and  the  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy \n(CPRGS).  The  CPRGS  was  formulated  and  adopted  in  2002  to  concretize  the  reform  agenda \nand reaffirm its commitment to poverty reduction; this was the same year that the Government \nsigned  a  poverty  reduction  partnership  agreement  with  ADB.  In  2003,  the  CPRGS  was  also \nexpanded to include a development policy for large-scale infrastructure. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  reform  program  envisions  a  path  of  transition  towards  a  market  economy \nwith  socialist  orientation,  while  achieving  the  twin  goals  of  high  economic  growth  and \nsubstantive  poverty  reduction.  The  CPRGS  was  prepared  with  the  assistance  of  the  donor \ncommunity,  including  the  ADB,  and  in  consultation  with  stakeholders  and  civil  society.  The \nCPRGS has been used as an action plan for achieving the envisioned goals. The CPRGS spells \nout clear development targets, identifies appropriate policies to attain those targets, and seeks \nto  align  resources  to  those  policies.  The  Viet  Nam  Development  Goals,  which  are  Vietnam's \nversion  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  are  among  the  targets  of  the  CPRGS.  The \npolicies  considered  encompass  three  main  areas:  high  growth  through  completion  of  the \ntransition to a market economy; an equitable, socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable \npattern of growth; and the modernization of governance systems.  \n \nWe view this ADB assistance (the program loan) as being supportive of the Government\u2019s entire \npoverty  reduction  and  growth  strategy  and  ensuing  PRSC  reform  agenda,  which  is  consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy,  and  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  with \nViet  Nam.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  contribute  towards  financing  the  cost  of  adjustment  resulting \nfrom  PRSC  4  policy  matrix.  To  date  this  program  has  been  supported  by  Poverty  Reduction \nSupport Credits (PRSCs) from the International Development Association with co-financing from \nother  bilateral  and  multilateral  donors.  The  policy  actions  under  the  proposed  program  loan \nreflect the reform directions set out in our planning documents and in the CPRGS in particular. \n\n\fAppendix 5                51 \n\nThe actions supported by the proposed program loan also reflect the emerging reform agenda \nfor the next planning cycle, when the CPRGS approach will be fully integrated in the five-year \nSEDP 2006-2010. The integration will require a broad consultation with stakeholders within the \nGovernment agencies as well as civil and donor communities. Key agendas of the consultation \nwill include both the attainment of development outcomes such as the Viet Nam Development \nGoals  and  the  strengthening  of  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanisms.  The  integration  of  the \nCPRGS approach into the SEDP, together with its previous expansion to address infrastructure \npolicies, eliminates the need for two separate planning documents.  \n \nAs we are approaching the end of one planning period and defining the directions for the next \none, we have formulated many policy actions based on both existing strategies and emerging \ndirections.  All  of  these  emerging  directions,  jointly  with  the  CPRGS  and  other  planning \ndocuments  of  the  Government,  have  shaped  the  policy  actions  supported  by  this  proposed \nprogram loan. The opening speech of Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung to the seventh \nsession  of  the  National  Assembly  on  5  May  2005  articulated  the  same  themes  and  reviewed \nsome of the same actions covered by PRSC 4. Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung is also \nthe  Chairman  of  the  Steering  Committee  for  the  PRSC  process.  His  speech  to  the  National \nAssembly  confirms  that  the  proposed  program  loan  is  fully  aligned  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  reform \nagenda. \n \nWith respect to the first reform area of our development strategy, we have made a great effort to \nsteer the transition to a market economy. In fact, the past two years have been characterized by \nintense efforts to accelerate Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the WTO and to integrate with the world \neconomy,  which  in  turn  has  influenced  policy  actions  related  to  international  trade  and  legal \nframework. Over the past twelve months we have made significant progress in multilateral and \nbilateral negotiations towards WTO accession. We have also reduced substantially the number \nof  activities  where  full  state-ownership  is  to  be  retained,  especially  through  the  auctioning  of \nshares. Regarding banking reform, an ambitious strategy has been prepared for the coming five \nyears  with  some  important  steps  undertaken  recently.  Actions  undertaken  to  improve \ntransparency  and  accountability  in  the  financial  sector  include  the  issuance  of  an  anti-money \nlaundering  decree  and  a  microfinance  institution  decree,  both  of  which  benefited  from  ADB \nadvisory  technical  assistance  projects.  We  have  also  continued  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  private  sector  development,  especially  through  the  issuance  of  a  new \nCompetition  Law  limiting  the  dominant  market  position  of  SOEs;  and  a  strengthened  legal \nframework  that  allows  private  participation  in  the  electricity  and  telecommunication  sectors. \nThese actions can be traced to Part III sections I and II, and Part IV of the CPRGS. \n \nWith respect to the second reform area, we have taken a number of important steps to ensure \nsocial inclusion and environmental sustainability through education, health, land and forest and \nenvironment policies. In line with the National Education for All Action Plan 2003-2015 and our \nEducation  Development  Strategy  2001-2010,  we  have  taken  steps  to  improve  the  quality  of \nprimary education and to open up tertiary education to private providers. Through health policy, \nwe  issued  an  action  plan  for  tuberculosis  prevention,  accounting  for  its  interaction  with \nHIV/AIDS  and  strengthened  the  regulation  and  pricing  of  pharmaceuticals.  To  improve \nenvironmental  management,  we  have  passed  a  new  Law  on  Forest  Protection  and \nDevelopment,  improvements  in  the  implementation  of  the  revised  Land  Law  and  the \ndevelopment  of  guidelines  to  govern  the  transfer  of  land  from  State  Forestry  Enterprises  to \nhouseholds  and  communities.  Actions  in  these  areas  are  related  to  Part  V  section  I,  Part  III \nsections I and III, and Part IV section IV of the CPRGS.  \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nWith respect to the third reform area, we have instituted a number of measures to build modern \ngovernance.  In  November  2004,  the  Government  described  the  progress  it  had  made  in \nimplementing  the  CPRGS  in  the  second  Annual  Progress  Report.  This  report  explains  the \nreforms we are introducing to the overall planning framework. The new direction is reflected in \nthe decision to base the SEDP on robust data and evidence and to link the proposed policies to \nboth a monitoring framework and resource needs. We have also taken a number of actions to \nstrengthen  public  financial  management  and  increase  transparency.  Increased  financial \ndisclosure for all state budget entities, and the transformation of the State Audit of Viet Nam into \nan independent specialized agency, are among those actions. As you are aware of our strong \ncommitments  and  partnership  with  ADB  in  implementing  the  Public  Administration  Reform \nMaster Program, we also continue to move forward on public administration reform under this \nproposed  program  loan  by  aligning  civil  servants\u2019  salaries  with  the  market.  These  actions \ncorrespond  to  Part  VII  Section  I,  and  Part  III  sections  I  and  II  in  the  CPRGS.  Our  intention  to \nintegrate  the  CPRGS  approach  into  future  five-year  and  one-year  planning  processes  is \ndescribed in the CPRGS Progress Report. \n \nTackling corruption is also part of the third reform area, which is also discussed in Part II of the \nCPRGS.  The  Government  has  maintained  a  strong  commitment  to  fighting  corruption.  The \nResolution  of  the  6th  Central  Committee  plenum  in  December  2003  set  the  framework  for \ndeveloping  a  comprehensive  anticorruption  program.  The  building  blocks  of  this  program  are \nreducing  opportunities  for  corrupt  behavior  and  increasing  the  probability  that  those  abusing \nsuch opportunities get caught. The Prime Minister has instructed the Government Inspectorate \nto  take  the  lead  in  designing  anticorruption  policies.  This  instruction  came  at  a  time  when  the \nfirst comprehensive diagnostic of corruption, relying on an internationally organized approach, is \nnear completion. In addition the anticorruption law has been drafted and debated openly in the \nparliament. The debates were also disseminated to the public. The draft law was envisaged to \nbe passed by the National Assembly in November 2005.  \n      \nWe have noted gratefully the increasing number of co-financiers, which has increased from four \nin  the  case  of  PRSC  1,  to  ten,  including  ADB,  for  the  current  PRSC  4.  The  Government \nrecognizes that the support of donors goes beyond filling the gap for external financing needs. \nDonors  also  participate  in  partnership  groups  with  the  Government,  which  cover  all  economic \npolicy  areas,  and  are  instrumental  in  providing  factual  information  and  analysis,  thus \ncontributing to the monitoring of progress in reform implementation, sharing international good \npractices.  Given  the  intensive  and  complex  coordination  that  is  required  to  manage  this  very \ncomprehensive  reform  program,  SBV  created  a  Program  Coordination  Unit  (PCU)  with \ndedicated staff in January 2005. This PCU deals with the program agenda, including monitoring \nand  reporting  types  of  work  to  awareness  raising,  capacity  building  and  reform  outcome \ndissemination. The PCU has engaged in frequent interactions with the World Bank and the co-\nfinanciers of the PRSC, including ADB.  \n \nWe  are  vigorously  committed  to  pursuing  the  PRSC  process  to  create  momentum  to  promote \nand  sustain  national  growth  and  development.  We  assure  you  that  the  measures  and  actions \noutlined  in  this  Development  Policy  Letter  and  specified  in  the  Policy  Matrix  of  PRSC  4 \ndocument  and  subsequent  ADB  loan  documents  will  be  adopted  in  a  timely  and  sustainable \nmanner.  \n \n \n \n \n\n\fAppendix 5                53 \n\nWe are thankful for the active and valuable support, which the ADB has been providing for its \nCPRGS and SEDP implementation and especially for ADB\u2019s commitment to support the PRSC \n4.  We certainly look forward to continuing this strong partnership with the ADB.  \n \n \n \nYours sincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLe Duc Thuy \nGovernor  \nState Bank of Viet Nam \n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\n   Appendix 6 \n\n SUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY AND SUMMARY POVERTY \nIMPACT ASSESSMENT OF THE PROGRAM \n \nTable A6.1: Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \n\nA. \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nfinancial  management, \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam:  \nThe  program  loan  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  supporting  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS).  As  a  multisector  instrument  covering  a  range  of \nissues related to poverty reduction, the Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) and the program loan provide an \nopportunity  to  advance  restructuring  of  the  economy  to  achieve  equitable  economic  growth  and  well-being.  The \nCPRGS is an important vehicle to reduce poverty and improve social service delivery and other social indicators in a \nsustainable manner. This will be achieved by implementing a broad-based reform agenda, which has its foundation on \nthree  key  pillars:  (i)  transition  to  a  market  economy,  (ii)  social  inclusion  and  environmental  sustainability,  and  (iii) \nmodern  governance.  The  Government  is  developing  its  5-year  socioeconomic  development  plan  (SEDP),  which \nintegrates  the  principles  of  the  CPRGS:  (i)  growth,  (ii)  social  development  and  poverty  reduction,  and  (iii) \nenvironmental sustainability. The integrated agenda of the SEDP and CPRGS requires major policy reform involving \ntrade  integration,  and  reforms  for  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  financial  sector,  infrastructure,  education,  health, \nfinancial  accountability,  public \nland,  water,  environment,  planning  process,  public \nadministration, and anticorruption. These reforms are valuable essential contributors for achieving poverty reduction, \ngrowth,  and  social  development  in  a  sustainable,  equitable,  and  cost-effective  manner.  The  planning  renovation \nprocess, initiated by the Decree 2215/TH-BKHDT and the Circular 33/ Ttg dated 24 Aug 2005, is helping improve the \npolicymaking  process.  The  program  loan,  which  follows  the  PRSC  4  framework,  calls  for  accelerating  the  policy \nchanges  and  reforms  that  increase  efficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability;  and  stimulate  growth,  thereby \nreducing poverty and improving social services to poor people. The CPRGS and thus the program loan are consistent \nwith  the  poverty  reduction  strategy;  the  country  strategy  and  program  for  Viet  Nam  (2006\u20132008);  the  Poverty \nReduction Partnership Agreement (2002) with Viet Nam of the Asian Development Bank (ADB); and the attainment of \nthe Viet Nam Development Goals, the country version of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n \nB. \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? A comprehensive poverty analysis was jointly carried out as background \nto the preparation of PRSC 4.1 Viet Nam\u2019s achievements in terms of social development and poverty reduction have \nbeen  remarkable.  Almost  one  third  of  the  total  population  was  lifted  out  of  poverty  in  less  then  10  years.  Poverty \nincidence  was halved during 1993\u20132002 and from 28.9% in 2002 to 24.1% in 2004.2 Economic growth underpinned \nthe rapid poverty reduction. The elasticity of poverty reduction to economic growth was higher than one. The decline in \npoverty  was  widespread as the increase in inequality has been modest so far. Social indicators improved markedly, \npositioning  Viet  Nam  well  to  attain  key  MDGs,  which  is  shown  remarkably  in  access  to  education,  health  care  for \nchildren  and  the  poor,  and  gender  equality.  The  last  decade  was  thus  characterized  by  undeniable  progress  in  the \nlives of the Vietnamese population.  \n \nPoverty incidence is high in remote mountain and highland areas and in the pockets of densely populated deltas and \nriver basins. Living standards in these areas are much lower than other regions. Ethnic people account for 14% of the \npopulation but 30% of the poor. The share of poverty in these regions increased during 2002\u20132004.3  \n \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB, Australian\u2019s Government\u2019s Overseas Aid Program, DFID, German Agency for Technical Cooperation, JICA, \nSave the Children UK, United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. 2003.

(Joint research report, p.10). \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6           55 \n\n \nWhile decentralization has many advantages, the trend to decentralized government could amplify disparities between \nrich and poor regions, because rich regions have higher local resources and revenues, and thus will be able to spend \nsubstantially  more  on  development  and  social  services  than  poorer  regions,  which  are  dependent  on  central \nGovernment  transfers.  Conscious  of  this  phenomenon,  the  Government  has  prepared  the  explicit  session  on  ethnic \nsupport  in  the  draft  SEDP  2006\u20132010,  which  means  poverty  reduction  interventions  have  been  integrated  in  the \noverall socioeconomic development strategy. Also the Government has preferential and special programs for the poor \nand  special  programs  for  ethnic  people  in  these  regions  like  the  comprehensive  Hunger  Eradication  and  Poverty \nReduction  Program  2001\u20132005  and  other  targeted  programs,  such  as  Program  135,  which  are  in  place  and  have \ngenerally benefited the poor. The recent overall evaluation of the two programs4 proposed that the two programs be \nextended  to  the  second  phase  up  to  2010  and  that  they  should  be  integrated  into  the  government  development \nprograms and be further decentralized, focus on capacity building, and include the participation of people in planning, \nmonitoring, and evaluation to increase the programs\u2019 effectiveness.  \n \nTo  further  reduce  poverty  and  sustain  the  high  level  of  economic  growth,  Viet  Nam  needs  to  remove  structural \nweaknesses, promote socially and environmentally inclusive development, and modernize governance and the public \nadministration system. Viet Nam needs to develop policy solutions for sustainable poverty reduction such as creating \nan environment for sustainable growth, effective implementation of the social safety net, and \u2018socialization\u2019 (i.e., have \nthe  private  sector  and  community  make  decisions  on  and  financially  contribute  to  social  services)  of  the  poverty \nreduction programs. \n \n\nC. \n\nParticipation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nThe formulation of the CPRGS and the PRSCs (and thus the program loan) has involved comprehensive consultations \nand  discussions  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders.  It  included  stakeholder  consultations  with  beneficiaries,  national \nand  local  officials,  development  agencies,  and  nongovernment  organizations.  The  international  development \ncommunity has supported this process by financing studies, participatory poverty assessments, surveys, and analysis \nunder a number of  activities. The Government, during 2005, has made  effort to integrate the CPRGS into its SEDP \n2006\u20132010.  They  have  adopted  the  approach  of  developing  plans  by  organizing  wide  stakeholder  consultation \nincluding  grassroots  communities.  With  the  commitment  and  proactivity  of  the  Government,  ODA  partners,  and \nnongovernment organizations have provided support to MPI in technical and financial matters. The results out of this \nprocess will be very useful for ODA partners to align their strategy with the Government\u2019s SEDP. The comprehensive \nVietnam Development Report 2005 involved seven major development agencies, including ADB and with the Vietnam \nAcademy of Social Science (VASS) in studies and data analysis such as on poverty and social impact assessment of \nWTO accession. Besides, ADB, the World Bank, in collaboration with the Development Strategy Institute prepared the \nreports  on  regional  perspectives  on  poverty  and  growth  for  the  central  region,  Mekong  Delta  and  northern \nmountainous regions. These reports provided an input for PRSC 4 and the program loan. The Government\u2019s report on \nthe progress of MDGs, which has comments from stakeholders, has been prepared and the annual CPRGS progress \nreports continue to be a good monitoring and evaluation document for the Consultative Group meeting. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n4   Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs, and United Nations Development Programme. 2004.

Hanoi \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\n   Appendix 6 \n\n  No \n\n  Yes   \n\n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nParticipatory  processes  were  followed  during  the  formulation  of  the  CPGRS.  It  continued  with  implementing  the \nCPRGS in more than 20 provinces. Development agencies, including ADB, financed the initial implementation and the \ncapacity building for local governments to conduct studies such as participatory poverty assessments and participatory \nplanning,  and  strategic  planning  of  key  programs  for  the  poor.  During  2005,  ODA  partners  and  nongovernment \norganizations  have  committed  to  conduct  participatory  community  consultation,  together  with  a  series  of  regional \nworkshops  with  local  governments,  workshops  with  ministries,  and  workshops  with  business  groups  and  ODA \ncommunities  on  the  SEDP.  This  represents  good  implementation  of  the  CPRGS  in  the  context  of  pillar  III  reforms, \nwhich  aims  to  encourage  greater  participation  of  the  poor,  ethnic  minorities,  and  other  marginalized  groups  in \ncommune  decision  making.  These  are  envisaged  in  the  new  Budget  Law  and  the  Grassroots  Democracy  Decree. \nTraining support, career development, and mechanisms to increase participation of these groups (large and small) in \nlocal  authorities,  management  boards,  and  service  delivery  are  being  promoted  by  the  Government  working  jointly \nwith development agencies, including ADB. To prepare for PRSC 4 and future PRSCs, ADB and the World Bank will \njointly organize a consultation workshop among all development partners including the Government, funding agencies, \nand civil society.  \n \n\nD. \n\nGender Development \n\n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe CPRGS and PRSC 4 support actions to benefit women. The Government is committed to gender equality through \npolicies  and  actions  that  will  warrant  a  gender  sensitive  implementation  of  the  program  loan.  The  Government  has \nsigned the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; the National Committee for \nthe Advancement of Women has been established and comprises 18 members at the deputy-minister level from key \nministries  and  central  organizations;  a  National  Strategy  for  the  Advancement  of  Women  in  Viet  Nam  by  2010  is  in \nplace (This strategy includes discrete targets for 2010, which relate to equal rights for women in labor, employment, \neducation, and health care; an increase in the number of woman candidates for leadership positions at all levels and \nin  all  sectors;  and  strengthening  of  the  machinery  for  the  advancement  of  women.  The  2001\u20132005  National  Plan  of \nAction  for  Advancement  of  Women  guides  the  first  5  years  of  implementation  of  the  National  Strategy;  the  National \nAssembly in 2003 adopted a resolution to draft and promulgate a law on gender equality, and an 11-member drafting \ncommittee  has  been  appointed,  headed  by  the  president  of  the  Viet  Nam  Women\u2019s  Union.  The  Government  asked \nADB to provide advisory technical assistance to support the preparation of this law. ADB has also supported gender \nmainstreaming in the agriculture sector. Gender mainstreaming has been implemented into the national SEDP; ADB \nsupported  the  Government  in  organizing  the  gender  mainstreaming  workshop  during  August  2005.  Gender \nmainstreaming  also  has  been  conducted  in  several  ministries  like  Ministry  of  Education  and  Training,  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development, Ministry of Labor Invalids and Social Affairs, etc.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \nA social and poverty impact assessment of the program loan has been prepared and is presented as Supplementary \nAppendix A).

The  program \nwill  be  in  compliance  with  the  national  labor  legislation. \nTherefore, no further plan is required. \nOverall, a positive impact is expected on ethnic minorities, \ngiven the Government\u2019s commitment to advance the well-\nbeing  of  this  group,  public  awareness,  and  incorporation \nof  needs  and  interests  of  ethnic  minorities  in  plans  and \nprograms through their active involvement.

First,  it  will  promote  growth  and  create \nemployment  through  greater  internal  and  external  competition,  accelerate  the  divestiture  of  SOEs  and  SOCBs, \nestablish  a  sound  regulatory  framework,  and  improve  transparency  and  accountability  in SOE  operations  and in the \nfinancial  sector.  Second,  it  will  advance  human  development  and  economic  growth  through  expanded  budget \nappropriation  and  higher  quality  standards  for  education;  resources  to  cover  the  health  care  costs  of  the  poor; \nmechanisms to complete the transfer of land-use rights to households, more secure asset ownership in the form of a \nnew  land  law  especially  in  upland  and  ethnic  minority  areas;  and  measures  to  improve  environmental  and  water \nresource  management.  Third,  the  program  loan  will  increase  transparency  and  accountability  of  public  finances, \npromote  simplified  administrative  procedures,  reduce  corruption,  and  revamp  the  planning  processes  as  part  of  a \nbroader effort to build modern governance. The reforms will pursue the attainment of well-specified development goals \nbased on empirical analysis and wider consultations. \n \nThe reforms will result in increased private investment and exports, which will lead to additional job creation. Further \ndecentralization of public administration leading to better service delivery to the poor and increased local beneficiary \nparticipation are other expected benefits. Through appropriate measures and proactive programs, the Government will \nneed  to  mitigate  the  potential  adverse  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impacts  of  increased  trade  openness, \nreduction in state enterprises, and liberalization in land transactions. \n \nStrong  direct  and  indirect  benefits  are  expected  to  reach  the  poor  in  terms  of  increased  and  more  rewarding \nemployment  opportunities,  improved  service  delivery,  decentralized  planning,  and  promotion  of  beneficiary \nparticipation.  Any  increase  in  employment  opportunity  and  efficiency  gain  in  service  delivery  will  directly  benefit  the \npoor. The Government has special programs and policies in place to ensure that women and the poor have access to \njobs, basic health services, education, and infrastructure, especially in the mountainous regions and poor urban areas, \nand  have  priority.  Its  commitment  to  enhancing  the  well-being  of  ethnic  minorities  is  reflected  in  the  country\u2019s \nconstitution and the creation in 1983 of the Committee for Ethnic Minorities with ministry status. \n \nGreater exposure to world markets could lead to higher risk/variability in prices and hence the income of wage earners \nand farmers, but its overall impact is likely to be positive for the rural sector. Analytical work is ongoing for the coffee \nsector. Further commercialization of the economy may increase inequality, unless rectifying measures are taken early. \nAn assessment of the poverty and social impact of WTO accession is being undertaken, and includes a combination \nof  analyses  at  three  levels  (a  computable  general  equilibrium  model  to  predict  changes  in  prices  of  goods  and \nservices; regional models to determine changes in prices of factors of production that are not mobile, such as land and \nlabor;  and  estimated  impact  on  consumption  at  the  household  level).  The  regions  of  Hanoi,  Ho  Chi  Minh  City,  Hai \nPhong, and Danang City are expected to benefit most from WTO accession, while the poverty reduction effect for the \nmountainous areas could be more modest.  \n \nRestructuring and divesting of SOEs will cause labor retrenchment. To offset the adverse impact of retrenchment, the \nGovernment has established a fund for retrenched SOE workers. This fund has been in place since mid-2002 and an \nevaluation rates the fund as highly effective. \n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\n   Appendix 6 \n\nEffects on the Poor \n \n\nEffects on Other \nStakeholders \n \n\nMitigation or \nEnhancement Measures \n \n\nPossible \nChannels \nof Effect \nReliance on market forces and private sector involvement in providing basic services could help expand the availability \nof services and create new employment opportunities, but prices of services may increase. To minimize such impacts, \nbasic services for low-income groups are provided free of charge or at reduced costs and as part of safety nets. These \nprograms already exist but may need to be expanded depending on the scope and pace of privatization/cost recovery. \nCareful  consideration  must  be  given  to  interregional  equity  when  reforming  service  delivery,  particularly  for  health, \neducation, transportation, and communication infrastructure. \n \nDecentralization  should  make  local  government  more  accountable  to  the  poorest  and  include  their  participation  in \ndecision  making  on  development  programs  and  delivery  of  services.  The  current  participation  of  the  poor  in  the \nplanning  and  decision-making  process  is  low,  but  ongoing  efforts  to  increase  the  participatory  process  will  have \npositive  impacts.  These  efforts  include  community  consultations  on  the  5-year  SEDP  (2006\u20132010)  and  participatory \nsmall  infrastructure  planning  in  selected  projects  such  as  CBRIP,  NMPRP  (World  Bank).  The  experiences  on \ncommunity  participation for these  projects  will give substantial  inputs for the design of the \u201cnew  135\u201d  program. Poor \nhouseholds  are  usually  physically  remote  and  socially  marginalized.  The  Government  has  programs  to  accelerate \naccess  to  social  services  and  education  for  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities  in  remote  areas.  The  recent  Viet  Nam \nInequality Report 2005 (Department for International Development) provides insights for better inclusion of the poor, \nthus ensuring the access of the poor to basic social services. \n \nThe new land law is expected to benefit poor and vulnerable people. As the land market develops in the medium term, \npotential adverse social impacts may have to be addressed. Two studies on the potential implications of a land market \nhave been undertaken as part of preparation of PRSC 4. Studies on land markets were also completed as part of the \nongoing Making Markets Work Better for the Poor Project being implemented by ADB. \n \nIncomplete structural reform could jeopardize growth and stability in the longer term. A fiduciary risk is associated with \ninadequate  progress  on  enhancing  budget  transparency  and  tackling  corruption.  Haphazard  introduction  of  market \nforces in the social sectors, and the trend toward decentralization have put service delivery under strain. At the same \ntime,  fast  integration  with  the  world  economy  may  lead  to  increased  inequality,  at  least  temporarily,  as  the  benefits \naccrue to specific regions and skills disproportionately. Growth in Viet Nam could become less inclusive in the years to \ncome.  These  issues  are  well  understood  and  several  programs  are  already  well  established  to  offset  the  adverse \neffects. \n \nFurther details are presented in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6           63 \n\nLIST OF INELIGIBLE ITEMS \n \n\nimported  goods  (excluding  any  duties  or \n\nThe proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance foreign exchange expenditures for the \n1. \nreasonable  cost  of \ntaxes)  required  during \nimplementation  of  the  program  loan  for  Support  to  Implementation  of  Poverty  Reduction \nProgram.
