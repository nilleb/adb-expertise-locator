The  program  is  consistent  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Strategy  2030 \noperational  priorities  of  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity  (including  SOE \nreforms to improve service delivery) and accelerating progress in gender equality. 2 The program \naligns with priorities of the PNG country partnership strategy, under which ADB will support SOE \nreform, business environment improvement, and greater competition. 3 The program also aligns \nwith the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) staff-monitored program for PNG. 4 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \nMacroeconomic  context.  PNG  is  a  small  and  fragile  economy,  heavily  reliant  on \n3. \ncommodity exports. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 7.7% annually during 2013\u20132016, \ndriven by liquefied natural gas investment and exports. Growth fell to 1.3% during 2017\u20132018 due \nto softer commodity prices and disasters caused by natural hazards. After expansionary policies \nled  to  fiscal  deficits  averaging  5.6%  of  GDP  during  2013\u20122016,  expenditure  controls  (largely \nthrough cuts in capital spending and the accumulation of substantial arrears, including in utility \npayments) reduced the deficit to 2.6% during 2017\u20122018. 5 The economy rebounded in 2019 as \nGDP  grew  5.0%,  underpinned  by  recovery  in  energy  and  mineral  production  following  an \nearthquake in 2018. With low global commodity  prices, payments on arrears, and low revenue \ncollection, the fiscal deficit reached  4.9% of GDP in 2019. Sustained  deficits contributed to an \nincrease in public debt from 17.4% of GDP in 2011 to 39.8% of GDP in 2019. 6 \n \nThe  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  hit  PNG  as  the  government  was \n4. \nembarking on significant fiscal consolidation to achieve a primary surplus and reduce public debt \nto  below  40%  of  GDP  in  the  medium  term.  7  PNG  has  been  affected  by  export  losses  and \nrestrictions to mitigate COVID-19 transmission. Pre\u2012COVID-19 growth was projected at 2.1% for \n2020 but the economy is now projected to contract by 2.9%. Dampened revenues and stimulus \nexpenditures will lead to a financing gap of 8.2% of GDP in 2020, higher than the pre\u2012COVID-19 \n\n \n\n1  This lending proposal was not included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: \nPapua New Guinea (2020\u20132022). Manila. The government requested financial assistance through a letter dated 24 \nJuly 2019 as an addition to the country operations business plan. ADB\u2019s Pacific Department confirmed that the 2020 \nresource envelope could accommodate such assistance. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nThe concept paper for the program was circulated to the ADB Board of Directors on 5 March 2020. \n\n2  ADB.  2018.

IMF Country Report. No. \n20/95. Washington, DC. \n\n5  Macroeconomic Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  A recalibration exercise in 2019 brought substantial contingent liabilities into official debt figures. \n7  As of 1 November 2020, PNG had 589 confirmed cases and 7 reported deaths because of COVID-19. \n\n\fprojection of 5.0%. Public debt is expected to rise to 49.8% of GDP in 2020. The IMF assesses \nPNG to be at high risk of external and overall debt distress after COVID-19. 8 The medium-term \nmacroeconomic framework is considered adequate, with the IMF projecting the fiscal deficit to fall \nto 3.2% of GDP in 2024 and public debt to 42.6% of GDP in 2025, as measures to curb recurrent \nspending resume and revenue recovers. Public debt is assessed as sustainable based on PNG\u2019s \ncommitment to fiscal consolidation under the IMF\u2019s staff-monitored program. 9 \n \n5. \nState-owned  enterprise  performance.  Most  essential  services  in  PNG\u2014including \nenergy,  water  supply,  telecommunications,  ports,  and  air  transport\u2014are  provided  through \nSOEs.10 Kumul Consolidated Holdings (KCH) is the holding company for the government\u2019s non-\nmineral,  oil,  and  gas  assets  through  the  General  Business  Trust  (GBT).  The  GBT  owns \ngovernment shares in nine SOEs, regulated by the Independent Public Business Corporation of \nPapua New Guinea (Kumul Consolidated Holdings) (Amendment) Act 2015 (KCH Act). 11 KCH is \nthe trustee of the GBT and oversees SOE performance. KCH reports to the National Executive \nCouncil  (NEC)  (comprising  all  ministers)  through  the  Minister  for  State  Enterprises,  who  is \nresponsible for all policy matters related to the SOE portfolio. The government is also the majority \nshareholder in two resource companies: Kumul Petroleum Holdings and Kumul Mineral Holdings. \n \n6. \nSOEs consistently demonstrate poor operational and financial performance. Incomplete \nfinancial  data  indicate  that  the  overall  profitability  of  SOEs  has  declined  since  2015. \nTheir consolidated  losses  increased  to  K142.7  million  in  2018  from  K54.3  million  in  2017. \nThe consolidated SOE debt was estimated to be K5.8 billion  as of  March 2019, of which K2.1 \nbillion was commercial debt. Given the important (and often monopolistic) role that SOEs have in \ndelivering services, their continued weak performance results in expensive, inefficient, and low-\nquality service provision and makes the economy less competitive. Part of SOE debt represents \na contingent liability and exposes the government to fiscal risk. 12 \n \n7. \nKey constraints. A weak overarching policy and legal framework undermines commercial \nprinciples,  contributing  to  poor  operational  performance.  The  KCH  Act  provides  considerable \nscope  for  political  considerations  to  override  commercial  imperatives,  including  in  board \ncomposition of government majority\u2013owned SOEs. Performance evaluation procedures for SOE \nboard members are unclear. Efficiency and profitability are not emphasized as SOE objectives.  \n \n8. \nSeveral  earlier  policy  initiatives  stalled  due  to  inadequate  political  and  administrative \nsupport. 13  The  government  did  not  implement  its  community  service  obligation  (CSO)  policy \n\n \n\n8  IMF.  2020.  Papua  New  Guinea:  Request  for  Disbursement  under  the  Rapid  Credit  Facility\u2014Press  Release;  Staff \nReport;  and  Statement  by  the  Executive  Director  for  Papua  New  Guinea.  IMF  Country  Report  No.  20/211. \nWashington, DC. The downgrade in debt distress risk is caused by the impacts of COVID-19. \n\n9  The  staff-monitored  program  includes  measures  and  targets  to  tighten  expenditure  controls,  reinvigorate  revenue \n\nreforms, restore exchange rate flexibility, initiate SOE reforms, and deal with corruption (footnote 4). \n\n10 Sector  Assessment  (Summary):  Public  Sector  Management  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n11 Independent  State  of  PNG.  2015.  Independent  Public  Business  Corporation  of  Papua  New  Guinea  (Kumul \nConsolidated Holdings) (Amendment) Act 2015. Port Moresby. The government owns the majority of nine SOEs in \nthe GBT: Air Niugini Limited, Kumul Agriculture Limited, Kumul Telikom Holdings Limited, Motor Vehicle Insurance \nLimited, National Development Bank, PNG Power Limited, PNG Ports Corporation, Post PNG Limited, and Water \nPNG Limited. \n\n12 Not all SOE debt is recorded in the consolidated debt figures in the budget. Several SOE loans have been contracted \n\nwithout NEC approval, more than half without adequate economic and financial viability assessments. \n\n13 Assistance  for  these  efforts  was  provided  by  ADB  through  the  Private  Sector  Development  Initiative.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n(approved by NEC in 2012), which  provides a framework  for the identification and financing of \nnoncommercial services rather than the current practice of opaque cross-subsidization. A Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership Act 2014 (PPP Act) was gazetted in 2018. 14 However, it was not implemented, \nand the few public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) that have been negotiated in PNG were on an ad \nhoc basis. A draft national competition policy, prepared in 2018 and calling for all SOEs to adhere \nto the principles of competitive neutrality, remained unapproved in mid-2020. \n \n9. \nThe  absence  of  an  effective  SOE  oversight  mechanism  inhibits  timely  reporting  and \ndisclosure and reduces accountability. Most SOEs do not produce annual financial statements in \na timely manner and have a major accounting backlog. Audited annual financial statements are \nnot publicly available. Planning processes are weak and annual operating plans often delayed or \nnot prepared. Most SOEs do not prepare statements of corporate intent or systematically develop \nkey  performance  indicators.  Boards  and  management  in  many  SOEs  lack  qualified  and \nexperienced  personnel,  and  some  directors  have  been  appointed  through  nontransparent \nprocesses.  As  a  result,  corporate  governance  does  not  receive  adequate  emphasis,  and  the \nperformance of SOE board members is not systematically monitored and assessed. Women are \nunderrepresented in SOE boards; only 2 of 48 SOE directors were women in 2019. \n \n10.  Many SOEs face specific financial constraints that affect their performance. PNG Power \nLimited (PPL) has high debt exposure, estimated at K1.21 billion in 2019. It works with several \nsole-sourced  independent  power  producers  and  has  not  systematically  pursued  commercially \nattractive opportunities. Financial management and procurement systems are improving but still \nweak.  Air  Niugini  Limited  (ANL)  undertook  major  reforms  in  2018  to  eliminate  loss-making \ninternational routes and turned a net operating loss after tax of K115 million in 2018 into a profit \nof K8 million in 2019. However, on account of flight restrictions and lack of traveler confidence \nbecause  of  COVID-19,  ANL  projects  a  net  operating  loss  after  tax  of  K198  million  in  2020. \nLarge unpaid bills from government clients  make it difficult for PPL and ANL to  reduce losses. \nANL and KCH have noncore assets that could be monetized to generate cash flows, and a few \nrelatively well-performing SOEs (such as Motor Vehicle Insurance Limited and Post PNG Limited) \ncould be partially privatized, but capacity and institutional weaknesses constrain progress.  The \ntwo water utilities, Eda Ranu (serving the national capital district) and Water PNG Limited (serving \nthe rest of PNG), are being merged to reduce overheads and increase efficiency, but progress \nhas been delayed by low institutional capacity. \n \n11. \nADB  contributions.  ADB  has  long  been  engaged  in  SOE  reforms  in  PNG  through \nregional technical  assistance (TA)  (para.  8). The same TA has supported benchmarking SOE \nperformance since 2012 and conducted feasibility assessments for PPPs for the National Airports \nCorporation, PPL, PNG Ports Corporation, and Eda Ranu. Results have been mixed, depending \non  political  commitment  and  administrative  support  (footnote  10).  ADB  has  built  strong \nrelationships with SOEs through engagement in water and energy projects. 15 ADB has supported \nfinancial management of SOEs, including occasional direct assistance to finalize annual accounts. \nWhile earlier reform progress was slow (para. 8), the current administration\u2019s commitment to SOE \nreforms at the highest level and ADB\u2019s support through a medium-term program to advance SOE \nreforms in PNG provide a more enabling environment for the first time. \n\n \n\n14 Government  of  PNG.  2014.

The government aims to improve the operational performance of \nSOEs, with the broader objective of delivering services across PNG at high quality and affordable \nprices. 16  The  current  administration  emphasizes  the  need  for  SOEs  to  be  accountable  and \nfinancially sustainable and to return dividends to consolidated revenue. NEC approved an SOE \nreform blueprint in November 2019, laying out reforms to be undertaken across SOEs in 2019\u2013\n2022,  to  strengthen  overarching  corporate  governance  and  policies  and  tackle  SOE-specific \nchallenges  (footnote 10). The pace of progress has been interrupted  by COVID-19, which has \nforced the government to divert attention to managing the pandemic\u2019s impacts. The government, \nhowever, has made good progress and remains committed to SOE reforms. \n \nProgram description. The government has requested a programmatic policy-based loan \n13. \n(PBL) series with three subprograms (in 2020, 2021, and 2022) to support implementation of its \nSOE reform blueprint. A PBL is a suitable modality to expedite and accelerate the government\u2019s \nongoing  SOE  reforms.  A  programmatic  approach  meets  urgent  budget  support  needs  while \nallowing  time  for  sustained  implementation  of  complex  and  politically  sensitive  reforms. \nThe approach permits prioritization of reform areas to account for low implementation capacity \nand provides flexibility to respond to emerging opportunities and constraints. \n \nADB\u2019s  program  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  SOE  reform  blueprint.  All  the \n14. \nsubprograms will support reforms in three areas: (i) legislative and policy framework strengthened, \n(ii)  governance  and  transparency  enhanced,  and  (iii)  financial  sustainability  of  specific  SOEs \nincreased (Appendix 4). Subprogram 1  provides the  direction for subsequent subprograms by \nframing  key  policies,  starting  implementation  of  reforms,  and  initiating  specific  transactions \n(paras. 16,  18,  and  20).  Subprograms  2  and  3  build  on  this  base  by  strengthening  legal \nframeworks to institutionalize reforms, continuing implementation of more complex reforms, and \nadvancing and/or concluding transactions (paras. 17, 19, and 21). The program includes some \nadministrative  actions  considered  critical  in  view  of  implementation  constraints,  to  ensure  that \ninstituted policies and legislation translate into changes in practices and lead to desired outcomes. \nReform targets take into account capacity limitations and initial conditions. \n \nUnder subprogram 1, ADB supports 17 policy actions, all of which have been completed. \n15. \nAlso, 18 indicative triggers have been identified for each of subprograms 2 and 3, to be refined \nand  developed  based  on  government  priorities  and  capacity,  considering  possible  continued \nCOVID-19 disruptions.  \n \n16. \nReform  area  1:  Legislative  and  policy  framework  strengthened.  Policy  actions  will \nstrengthen the framework to enable all SOEs to operate effectively and efficiently. ADB has added \nvalue by supporting all five subprogram 1 actions in this area through regional TA. 17 \n\n(i) \n\nOverarching policy and legislation. NEC has approved the SOE Ownership and \nReform  Policy,  clarifying  key  principles  of  SOE  ownership,  governance,  and \nperformance. NEC has approved the draft KCH (Amendment) Bill to amend  the \nKCH Act for submission to Parliament. Amendments will institutionalize reforms to \n(a) reduce political influence on commercial decision-making; (b) focus KCH\u2019s role \non  monitoring  SOE  performance; 18  (c)  reinforce  timely  preparation  and  public \nrelease of corporate plans and audited annual financial statements; (d) establish \n\n16 Government of Papua New Guinea. 2018.

NEC has approved the National Competition Policy (para. \n8), which supports removal of barriers to the participation of women\u2019s businesses \nand  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  in  public  procurement,  through \nappropriate structuring of tenders and advertisements. \nPublic\u2013private partnerships. The NEC has directed the Office of the Legislative \nCounsel to draft PPP regulations for the implementation of the PPP Act (para. 8). 19 \nThe  Department  of  Finance  has  established  a  multiagency  working  group  and \noutlined the group\u2019s responsibilities to support operationalization of the PPP Act, \nincluding preparation of regulations and the establishment of the PPP Center. \n\n \n17. \nSubsequent  subprograms  will  continue  reforms  with  ADB  value  addition  through  TA \n(footnote 17). PNG\u2019s Parliament will approve the KCH (Amendment) Bill to formally institutionalize \nits  provisions.  Regulations  on  identifying  and  costing  CSOs  will  be  piloted  and  developed,  in \naccordance with the KCH (Amendment) Act as approved by Parliament. Consumer  protection \nand competition will be further improved. The PPP Act will be fully operationalized through NEC \napproval of the required regulations, with the PPP Center established, budgeted, and operational. \n \nReform  area  2:  Governance  and  transparency  enhanced.  Subprogram  1  initiates \n18. \nimplementation of key reforms, including provisions in the draft KCH (Amendment) Bill (para. 16). \nADB has added value to all six actions through TA (footnote 17) and staff advisory support. \n\nDirector selection and performance. The KCH board has approved processes \nand guidelines for the transparent and merit-based selection of directors for KCH \nand  SOEs  in  the  GBT,  including  processes  for  developing  terms  of  reference, \nadvertising, short-listing, interviewing, and selecting candidates. 20 The processes \nand  guidelines  include  provisions  to  short-list  at  least  one  qualified  female \ncandidate (in a minimum short list of three candidates) for consideration for each \ndirector vacancy. The government has begun implementing the  guidelines, with \nfive directors (including two women) appointed to the boards of KCH, Post PNG \nLimited, and PPL following approved processes in June 2020. \nFinancial management and procurement. To reduce the significant backlog of \naudited annual financial statements, KCH has adopted a phased approach to bring \naccounts of KCH and SOEs in the GBT up  to date. Five SOEs have completed \ntheir  2018  accounts  and  three  their  2019  accounts,  and  auditors  have  been \nappointed to clear the backlog for 2018 and 2019. 21 The PPL board has approved \nthe  Procurement  Policy  (Financial  Delegations),  clarifying  financial  delegation \nauthorities and limits, and processes to commit PPL funds. \nCorporate planning. NEC has approved annual operating plans, which are often \nbehind schedule or not prepared, for seven SOEs. To improve corporate planning, \nthe KCH board has approved guidelines for SOEs to prepare corporate plans and \nstatements  of  corporate  intent  annually.  22 This  will  allow  the  Ministry  of  State \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n19 The PPP Act provides for the establishment of (i) the PPP Center to promote, coordinate, and analyze PPPs; and \n(ii)  the  PPP  Steering  Group  comprising  heads  of  the  Department  of  the  Treasury  (DOT)  and  the  Department  of \nNational Planning and Monitoring, and the State Solicitor to supervise PPP arrangements. \n\n20 These  processes  will  reduce  political  appointments  (para.  9)  and  are  expected  to  promote  commercial  decision-\n\nmaking by SOEs. \n\n21 ANL is completing its audited financial statements for 2016\u20122018, after which 2019 auditors will be appointed. \n22 The  corporate  plan  outlines  the  objectives  and  business  goals  of  the  SOE,  assesses  its  performance,  lays  out  a \n \n\n \n\n\fEnterprises and KCH to assess SOEs\u2019 strategies and monitor their performance. \nThe guidelines include reporting on the gender diversity of SOE staff. Corporate \nplans will incorporate a 3-year outlook for SOEs. The KCH board has approved a \ndecision  to  publicly  disclose  KCH  annual  reviews  on  its  website  for  greater \ntransparency and accountability, 23 and disclosed the 2018 Annual Review. \n\n \n19. \nSubsequent subprograms will continue reforms, with ADB adding value through regional \n(footnote 17) and country-specific TA. 24 All director appointments under KCH will follow approved \nguidelines, with escalating targets for women\u2019s representation. KCH will establish a database of \nqualified  women  applicants  and  provide  director  training.  KCH  will  develop  performance \nmanagement  processes for  directors, linked to corporate planning. Financial management  and \nprocurement will continue to be improved, and SOE accounts largely brought up to date by the \nend  of  the  program.  Timely  preparation  of  audited  annual  financial  statements  and  corporate \nplans will continue, as  mandated by the KCH (Amendment) Bill to be approved by Parliament. \nThe KCH annual reviews will be improved to publicly disclose more information. \n \nReform area 3: Financial  sustainability  of specific SOEs increased. Subprogram 1 \n20. \nactions focus on specific SOEs in line with government priorities, taking into account development \npartner  support.  ADB  has  added  value  by  assisting  on  private  sector  participation.  Particular \nattention is paid to SOEs where there are synergies with ADB projects performance (para. 11).  \nRestructuring of specific SOEs. The KCH board has approved a strategic plan \nto  improve  ANL\u2019s  performance,  considering  COVID-19  impacts  and  including \nshort-term  stabilization  measures  and  long-term  structural  reforms.  NEC  has \napproved a decision to divest noncore assets owned by ANL to improve its cash \nflow position and pay down overdue creditors. 25 Having two water utilities\u2014Water \nPNG  Limited  and  Eda  Ranu\u2014results  in  high  overhead  costs,  and  NEC  has \napproved draft legislation for submission to Parliament to facilitate their merger. \nPrivate  sector  participation  in  specific  SOEs.  While  appetite  for  wholesale \nprivatization  remains  limited,  the  government  plans  to  improve  private  sector \nparticipation in SOEs to upgrade performance and bring in private capital, based \non  careful  analysis  and  assessment.  NEC  has  approved  decisions  (a)  for  Post \nPNG to create a third-party logistics company with  a reputable strategic private \npartner, and (b) to redevelop Jacksons International Airport under a PPP model.26 \nFinancial health of specific SOEs. The Department of the Treasury (DOT) has \nsettled K21 million in arrears to ANL to support it during COVID-19 restrictions. \n\n(iii) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n \nSubsequent  programs  will  advance  specific  transactions  and  restructuring  approved \n21. \nunder  subprogram  1,  with  ADB  value  addition  through  staff  advice  and  TA  (footnote  17). \nThe government plans to introduce additional transactions to boost private sector participation in \nSOEs,  with  careful  consideration  to  pros  and  cons.  The  DOT  will  avoid  buildup  of  arrears  to \nspecific SOEs to improve their financial sustainability. \n\n \n\nstrategy to achieve its goals, and details key business decisions. The statement of corporate intent is extracted from \nthe corporate plan and should be publicly disclosed. \n\n23 KCH annual reviews include summary unaudited financial reports, description of key projects, and investment outlook \n\nfor all SOEs in the GBT. \n\n24 ADB. 2019. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Supporting State-Owned Enterprise Reforms. Manila. \n\nThe TA will support improvements in procurement, accounting, and performance management in SOEs. \n\n25 The  strengthening  of  ANL  has  synergies  with  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  engagement  to  improve  civil  aviation.  ADB.  2018. \n\nTechnical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Preparing the Civil Aviation Investment Program. Manila. \n\n26  The scope of redevelopment may include, among others, construction of the taxiway, expansion of the domestic and \ninternational terminals and aprons, modification of parking lots, and development of commercial real estate. ADB, \nthrough the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership, is providing advisory support. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nPartner  coordination.  ADB  has  coordinated  with  key  development  partners  on  the \n22. \nprogram.  Regional  TA  (footnote  17)  is  cofinanced  by  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New \nZealand,  and  the  European  Union.  Ongoing  and  planned  partner  TA,  including  from  the \ngovernments of Australia and New Zealand, and the World Bank was considered in identifying \nreforms. 27 The IMF\u2019s staff-monitored program (para. 1) supports transparency, accountability, and \ngovernance in SOEs. The government is leading partner coordination on SOE reform. \n \n23. \nLessons. The key lesson from the mixed success of ADB\u2019s prior engagement in SOE \nreform in PNG is that capitalizing on political support for reform is crucial (para. 11). 28 ADB seeks \nto make the most of the current administration\u2019s commitment to reform, and to lock it in through a \nmultiyear program that  gradually builds in complexity and strength  (para.  14). Where feasible, \nlegislation and capacity building will help institutionalize reforms. ADB recognizes that extensive \nTA,  coordinated  with  development  partners  and  provided  parallel  to  budget  support,  can  help \npush  the  reform  agenda  and  supplement  government  capacity.  The  program  recognizes  that \nstronger  oversight  mechanisms  and  resolving  board  issues  can  improve  SOE  performance. 29 \nOther  lessons  include:  (i)  backloading  ADB\u2019s  disbursements  across  three  subprograms  and \nrecognizing that implementation of complex reforms may take longer, based on ADB\u2019s experience \nin Fiji (para. 27); 30 and (ii) establishing a technical working group to coordinate reforms, including \nstaff from the Ministries of State Enterprises, and Transport and Infrastructure; the Departments \nof Finance, National Planning and Monitoring, and the  Treasury; and KCH and relevant SOEs, \nbased on ADB\u2019s experience in the health sector program. 31 \n \nC. \n \nThe program is aligned with the following impact: delivery of services across PNG at high \n24. \nquality  and  affordable  prices  (footnote  16).  The  effect  of  the  reforms  will  be:  operational \nperformance of SOEs improved. 32 The reforms under the three subprograms will contribute to this \nend through sequenced policy actions (para. 14). A better policy, legal, and institutional framework \nfor SOEs will strengthen governance, diversity, and accountability, which is expected to improve \nthe operational performance of the SOE portfolio. 33 More transparent and merit-based selection \nand  clearer  performance  evaluation  processes  are  expected  to  contribute  to  more  qualified \npersonnel  on  SOE  boards.  Some  reforms  target  specific  SOEs  and  will  tackle  their  particular \nconstraints.  These  measures  will  help  avoid  unsustainable  borrowing;  reduce  contingent \nliabilities;  encourage  private  investment;  and  improve  reliability,  efficiency,  and  affordability  of \npublic services. In the medium term, the improved financial position and operational performance \nof SOEs can support greater investment in and attention to service delivery. Reforms can build \nfiscal space to respond to shocks and promote long-term growth. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n \n\n27 The Government of Australia\u2019s TA is supporting capacity-building measures in KCH and telecommunications reforms. \nThe Government of New Zealand and the World Bank are supporting PPL. The Government of New Zealand expects \nto  provide  support  for  transparent  appointment  of  SOE  board  members.  ADB  is  supporting  telecommunications \nreforms through regional TA (footnote 17) and PPL through program actions and country-specific TA (footnote 24). \n28 The political economy of SOE reform in PNG is largely driven by shifts in political power, ministerial responsibilities, \n\nand performance of officials. \n\n29 ADB. 2018.

Escalating amounts for the subprograms reflect \nthe expected growing complexity of reforms. The loan will have a 15-year term, a grace period of \n3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)\u2013based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 9.25 years and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. \n \nE. \n \nThe  DOT  is  the  executing  agency. 36  The  DOT,  the  Department  of  Finance,  and  the \n27. \nMinistry of State Enterprises are the implementing agencies.

ADB will provide extensive TA to support program implementation and address \ngovernment capacity constraints (paras. 16\u201321). The proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \nGovernance.  PNG  is  classified  as  a  fragile  and  conflict-affected  situation. 38 Promoting \n28. \ngovernance and strengthening public financial management are government priorities (footnote \n16). The current administration has pledged to combat corruption, although much remains to be \ndone. 39 A 2015 public expenditure and financial accountability assessment identified substantial \ngaps,  which  are  gradually  being  addressed  through  reforms  (footnote  5).  The  National \nProcurement  Act  2018  has  come  into  force  and  will  help  boost  fairness  and  transparency  in \nprocurement. 40  Despite  significant  public  financial  management  weaknesses  and  systemic \nfragility, the government is able to implement its budget. The program, complemented by parallel \ndevelopment  partner  support,  will  help  gradually  reduce  fiduciary  risks,  including  through \nprocurement reforms and efforts to bring SOE accounts up to date. Program reforms to increase \naccountability  and  transparency  will  directly  support  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  promoting  good \ngovernance  (paras.  18\u201319).  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, the DOT, the Department of Finance, and the \nMinistry of State Enterprises. \n \nPoverty and social. The public sector is an important provider of services to low-income \n29. \nhouseholds.  The  program  will  help  SOEs  strengthen  public  service  delivery.  Better  financial \nsustainability of SOEs will improve their cash flow position and allow them to invest in sounder \nservices. The program will reduce potential pressure on the consolidated budget to the extent that \nSOE  debt  represents  a  contingent  liability  for  the  government.  This  will  help  ensure  that  the \ngovernment has resources to respond to future economic shocks, which can have adverse effects \non the poor, while maintaining critical public services. Private sector participation will increase \ncompetition and make basic goods and services more affordable. \n \n30. \nGender.  Subprogram  1  is  classified  as  some  gender  elements  and  includes  proactive \nactions  to  support  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  and  decision-making.  The  SOE  policy \nendorses  increasing  women\u2019s  representation  on  SOE  boards,  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  empower  women  (footnote  16).  The  draft  KCH  (Amendment)  Bill  introduces  a \nprovision to include at least one woman on the short list for each director appointment, subject to \nqualifications  (para.  16).  Under  subprogram  1,  KCH  approved  guidelines  for  the  transparent, \nmerit-based  selection  of  SOE  directors,  requiring  that  the  appointment  process  systematically \nshort-list at least one qualified female applicant for each director opening. The government has \nagreed that, under subsequent subprograms, it will escalate targets for women on boards and set \nup a database of qualified women to provide training and tap into for future director vacancies. \nThe  KCH  board  has  approved  corporate  planning  guidelines,  requiring  SOEs  to  report  on  the \ngender diversity of staff  at various levels. NEC has approved the National Competition Policy, \nwhich  supports  the  removal  of  barriers  to  the  participation  of  women\u2019s  businesses  in  public \nprocurement through appropriate structuring of tenders and advertisements.
