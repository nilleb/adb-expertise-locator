Uzbekistan\u2019s  education  system  must  also  be  reoriented \nin a cost-effective and sustainable manner. The ESDP will support \nselected  policy  interventions,  adjustment  measures,  and  critical \ninvestments  that  may  otherwise  be  hampered  by  resistance  to \nchange in the education system or adversely affected by budgetary \nconstraints.  \n\nPoverty Intervention \nThematic: Human Development \n\n \n \nClassification \n \n \nThe Sector Development Program \n \n \n \n \n\nObjectives and  \nScope \n\nPolicy \nFramework and \nActions \n\nfour  major  sector-wide  challenges:  namely \n\nThe ESDP will support the implementation of Uzbekistan\u2019s medium-\nterm  education  and \ntraining  development  plan,  commonly \ndesignated  as  the  National  Program  for  Personnel  Training,  by \naddressing \n(i) \nmodernizing the structure, content, and processes of education; (ii)  \nimproving  sector  sustainability  and  efficiency;  (iii)  reforming \ngovernance of education; (iv) providing protection for the poor.  \n \nThe Program Loan will facilitate the implementation of urgent reform \nmeasures  affecting  the  entire  sector,  while  the  Project  Loan  will \nfund  key  investments  aimed  at  improving  the  quality  of  basic \neducation and sector management practices.  \n\nThe  medium-term  education  policy  framework  and  the  associated \npolicy  actions  of  the  ESDP  collectively  address  the  four  major \nsector challenges.  \n \nModernizing  the  content  and  structure  of  education  will  involve  (i) \npursuing ongoing efforts to streamline and simplify the structure of \neducation;  (ii)  developing  modern  curricula  and  educational  quality \nmonitoring  mechanisms;  and  (iii)  strengthening \nteacher \neducation system, in particular through the introduction of distance \neducation.  \n \nThe  sustainability  and  efficiency  of  the  education  sector  will  be \nenhanced  by  (i)  redeploying  and  retraining  administrative  staff  in \nline  with  the  decentralization  process;  (ii)  reviewing  the  service \nconditions  of  education  personnel,  paying  particular  attention  to \nthose categories working in difficult conditions; and (iii) rationalizing \nthe network of schools and institutions.  \n\nthe \n\n\fCapacity \nBuilding \n\nThe Investment \nProject \n\n \nii\n\nThe governance and management systems of education should be \nreformed with a view to (i) developing national capacities in the area \nof  policy  formulation,  planning,  and  financial  management;  (ii) \nencouraging  community  participation  in  school  management;  and \n(iii)  supporting  the  emergence  of  a  nongovernment  education \nsector. \n \nAccess  of  the  poor  to  quality  education  will  be  protected  by  (i)  an \nimproved targeting of public resources towards deprived areas, and \n(ii) special assistance schemes for vulnerable population groups. \n\nsupport \n\nparticipatory \n\ncapacities\u2014will \n\nThe  ESDP  will  address  capacity-building  concerns  through  staff \ntraining  (both  in-country  and  abroad),  on-the-job  support,  and \nparticipatory policy studies. These activities will be concentrated on \nthree  main  areas:  (i)  decentralization  of  school  management,  (ii) \nteacher education, and (iii) overall sector policy analysis and reform \nmanagement. \n \nThe  Investment  Project  will  support  government  efforts  to  improve \nthe quality of basic education (with priority given to poor and remote \nrural areas) and to modernize sector management. It will comprise \nthree main components with several subcomponents. \n \nThe \nfirst  component\u2014strengthening  sector  planning  and \npolicy \nmanagement \nformulation  processes  and  develop  national  capacities  to  manage \nthe  education  reforms.  It  will  involve  (i)  an  organizational  audit  of \nthe  education  administration  with  a  training  needs  assessment  of \nthe  administrative  personnel;  (ii)  a  nationwide  school  mapping \nexercise  combined  with  a  community  survey;  (iii)  policy  studies  in \nthe  areas  of  (a)  staff  development,  (b)  education  finance  and \nbudgeting,  and  (c)  nongovernment  provision  of  education;  and  (iv) \ntraining of school principals and district administrators. \n \nComponent  2\u2014improving  and  extending  teacher  education\u2014will \nprincipally  establish  a  distance  education  capacity  to  conduct \ntraining  and  retraining  activities.  Teacher  education \nteacher \nprograms  will  be  developed  and  delivered  in  the  areas  of  (i) \nmultigrade instruction, (ii) primary school teaching, (iii) field-specific \nteaching  methods,  and  (iv)  selected  junior  secondary  school \nsubjects.  \n \nComponent  3\u2014strengthening  community  involvement  in  schooling \nand improving learning conditions\u2014will comprise (i) rehabilitation of \nthe physical infrastructure and provision of equipment for the most \nresource-poor schools of the country, (ii) assistance to communities \nin  establishing  autonomous  and  effective  school  boards,  and  (iii) \nprovision  of  grant  funds  accessible  to  schools  on  a  competitive \nbasis through a School Initiatives Fund (SIF). \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \niii \n\nSocial and \nEnvironmental  \nMeasures \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nThe Program Loan \n \n \n \n \n\nLoan Amount \nand Terms \n\n \n\n \n\nProgram \nMonitoring and \nTranching \n\nto \n\ntransfers \n\nThe  ESDP  policy  framework  specifically  includes  protection  of  the \npoor  as  one  of  its  pillars.  Policy  changes  supported  by  the  ESDP \nwill improve equity in the allocation of education resources (human, \nphysical,  and  financial)  and  will  facilitate  a  cost-effective  and  pro-\npoor  restructuring  of  education  budgets.  Direct  student  support \nmechanisms  such  as  scholarships  and  living  allowances  will  be \nbetter  targeted  towards needy students. Regional discrepancies in \neducation  finance  will  be  partially  offset  through  supplementary \nthe  poorest  districts.  Teacher \ncentral  budget \nperformance  and  teaching  quality  in  disadvantaged  areas  are \nexpected  to  be  enhanced  through  the  provision  of  supplementary \nincentives for teachers serving in particularly difficult conditions.  \n \nPoverty  reduction  mechanisms  are  also  largely  integrated  in  the \nthe \ndesign \nInvestment  Project.  School-based \nthe \nschool  rehabilitation  program  and  the  SIF  to  support  community \ninitiatives for education, will be targeted towards the poorest areas \nof the country. Augmenting teacher opportunities for further training \nand  career  development  will  principally  benefit  rural  teachers, \nespecially  women,  who  have  little  access  to  the  formal  in-service \ntraining system.  \n\nimplementation  arrangements  of \nincluding \ninterventions, \n\nfeatures  and \n\nIt is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s education reform \npackage by providing a loan of $70 million from its ordinary capital \nresources.  The  borrower  will  be  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan.  The \nloan will have an amortization period of 15 years, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, with interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based loan facility, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreement.  \n\nThe  Government,  through  an  Inter-Agency  Steering  Committee \n(IASC),  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  policy,  legal,  and \ninstitutional reforms envisaged under the Program. The IASC will be \nassisted  by  the  Education  Reform  Implementation  Monitoring  Unit \nof  the  COM.  A  program  monitoring  system  will  be  developed, \nbuilding upon the existing reform monitoring capacity established by \nthe Government with ADB support. \n \nThe Program will be carried out over a period of 36 months from the \ndate of loan effectiveness (expected December 2002). The loan will \nbe released in three tranches. To obtain the release of the tranches \nof  the  loan,  the  Government  will  be  required  to  carry  out  actions \nspecifically identified as conditions for tranche release in the policy \nmatrix,  and \nthe \nimplementation  of  other  actions  in  the  policy  matrix.  The  first \ntranche,  in  an  amount  of  $30  million,  will  be  released  upon  loan \n\nto  demonstrate  satisfactory  progress \n\nin \n\n\f \niv\n\ntranche,  in  an  amount  of  $30  million,  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness.

The  National  Program  for  Personnel  Training  (NPPT)  was  enacted  in  August  1997  to \nguide  long-term  education  reforms  in  three  phases:  1997-2001,  2001-2005,  and  2005  and \nbeyond.  In  support  of  the  NPPT,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  approved  two \nprojects:  the  Basic  Education  Textbook  Development  (BETD)  Project1  and  the  Senior \nSecondary  Education  (SSE)  Project\u2019.2  In  June  2000,  the  Government  requested  ADB  to \nconsider  the  preparation  of  the  ESDP  in  lieu  of  the  envisaged  Basic  Education  Staff \nDevelopment Project,3 to provide broad-based support to the overall education reform process.  \n \n3. \nSubsequently,  a  Loan  Reconnaissance  Mission  visited  Uzbekistan  between  1  and  17 \nJuly 2000 to assess the feasibility and the appropriateness of the sector development program \napproach  in  the  education  sector,  and  to  discuss  key  sector  policy  reforms  with  the \nGovernment.  A  Loan  Fact-Finding  Mission,  fielded  between  23  November  and  11  December \n2000,  worked  together  with  counterpart  agencies  to  develop  an  education  sector  policy  matrix \nand refine the design and implementation arrangements of the Project. Two follow-up missions \nwere  fielded  in  May-June  2001  and  November  2001,  respectively,  to  pursue  technical \ndiscussions  with  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  to  firm  up  conditions  for \nappraisal and subsequent ESDP processing steps. The Loan Appraisal Mission, fielded from 24 \nJanuary  to  4  February  2002,  updated  certain  components  of  the  policy  matrix  and  carried  out \nthe final reviews and analyses of the ESDP. The ESDP framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n4. \nThe  principal  Government  agencies  that  contributed  to  the  preparation  of  the  ESDP \ninclude the Office of the President, Secretariat of the Social Complex of the Cabinet of Ministers \n(COM), Department for Coordination of External Economic Activities of COM, Ministry of Public \nEducation  (MOPE),  Ministry  of  Higher  and  Secondary  Specialized  Education  (MOHSSE), \nCenter  for  Senior  Secondary  Education  (CSSE),  Central  Institute  for  Education  Staff \nDevelopment  (CIESD)  under  MOPE,  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Macroeconomics \nand Statistics (MOMES), and Ministry of Labor (MOL). Overall, ADB loan processing missions \nvisited  six  regions 4\u2014namely  Khorezm,  Samarkhand,  Djizzak,  the  Autonomous  Republic  of \nKarakalpakstan, Ferghana, and Andijan\u2014to consult with local stakeholders and potential direct \nbeneficiaries of the ESDP.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Loans 1594/95(SF) for $20 million and $20 million equivalent, respectively, approved on 17 December 1997. \n2   Loan 1737-UZB for $57 million equivalent, approved on 8 February 2000. \n3   This project was included in the Country Assistance Plan for Uzbekistan as a firm loan for 2001 for an amount of \n$40  million  and  then  removed  once  agreement  on  processing  of  the  ESDP  was  confirmed.  The  project  proposal \ndeveloped under the project preparatory technical assistance (TA 3187-UZB: Preparing the Basic Education Staff \nDevelopment  Project,  for  $350,000  approved  on  23  April  1999)  was  largely  used  to  formulate  the  investment \nproject of the ESDP.  \n\n4   Unless otherwise noted, the term \u201cregion\u201d is used hereafter to denote any of the 14 regional administrative units of \n\nUzbekistan, viz., 12 oblasts, Tashkent City oblast, and the Autonomous Republic of Karakalpakstan.  \n\n\f \n\n2\n\nIII. \n\nTHE SECTOR \n\nlargely \n\nMacroeconomic Context \n\n \nA. \n \nSince  its  independence  in  1991,  Uzbekistan  has  adopted  a  gradual  approach  to \n5. \nstructural  adjustment  and  macroeconomic  stabilization  as  well  as  to  sector  reforms.  The \ncountry\u2019s  rich  endowment  in  natural  resources\u2014Uzbekistan  is  one  of  the  world\u2019s  largest \nproducers of cotton, gold, and natural gas\u2014and the Government\u2019s ability to earn hard currency \nfrom exports allowed some degree of freedom with respect to the pace of institutional change \nand  structural  adjustment.  Unlike  the  other  Central  Asian  republics  of  the  former  Soviet  Union \n(FSU), Uzbekistan avoided a dramatic economic downturn in the post-independence years, and \nwas  able  to  minimize  short-term  social  unrest  associated  with  the  transition  to  a  market \neconomy.  \n \n6. \nAs  part  of  this  gradualist  approach,  the  institutional  framework  necessary  for  a  market \neconomy to operate is progressively being put in place. Prices of consumer goods have been \nliberalized,  privatization  of  small  enterprises  and  housing  has  been  completed,  and \ncorporatization of medium- and large-scale state-owned enterprises has been initiated under a \nvast privatization program. Fiscal and public sector management has improved, although good \ngovernance  remains  undermined  by  a  system  of  excessive  control  and  regulation.  The \nGovernment  took  significant  steps  to  augment  revenues  by  introducing  a  value-added tax by \nand  increasing  land  and  excise  taxes.  On  the  expenditure  side,  administrative  expenses  were \ncut \nfoodstuffs, \nthrough  administrative  downsizing,  while  direct  subsidies  on \ntransportation, and housing were largely removed.  \n \n7. \nAgriculture remains the key sector for Uzbekistan\u2019s economic development, accounting \nfor  roughly  35%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  60%  of  exports,  and  35%  of  employment. \nState and collective farms are progressively being transformed into private family-owned farms \nin an attempt to improve market responsiveness and increase agricultural yields. New policies in \nthe  rural  sector  promote  self-sufficiency  in  food  production  and  export  expansion,  essentially \nthrough  shifting  from  cotton  monoculture  to  food  crops.  At  the  same  time,  state  agricultural \nrevenues  are  being  largely  redistributed  to  finance  investments  in  other sectors, especially in \nimport-substitution industries.  \n \n8. \nDespite  the  Government\u2019s  attempts  to  boost  investment  in  domestic  industry,  industrial \ngrowth  since  independence  has  been  very  modest,  and  industry\u2019s  share  of  GDP  actually \ndeclined from 22% in 1993 to 15% in 2000. This weak performance reflects structural rigidities \nin  the  economy,  distortions  in  factor  markets,  and  import  restrictions.  In  contrast,  the  service \nsector expanded considerably with the relative stable macroeconomic environment. Wholesale \nand  retail  activities  thrived,  especially  in  the  capital,  Tashkent,  and  the  tourism  sector  has \ndeveloped  rapidly.  The  sector  distribution  of  economic  output  and  the  rapid  changes  affecting \neconomic  activity  have  important  implications  for  labor  market  requirements  and  hence  for \neducation  and  training  reforms.  Most  importantly,  there  is  a  need  to  strengthen  the  general \ncontent  of  instruction,  as  opposed  to  highly  specialized  training,  thereby  promoting  the \nacquisition of skills and knowledge applicable to a large number of industries and enhancing the \nflexibility of the workforce. \n \n9. \nRegarding  macroeconomic  policies  and  stabilization,  the  Government  performed \nrelatively  well  in  maintaining  both  internal  and  external  balance  in  the  face  of  successive \nexternal shocks in the 1990s, including the loss of budgetary and trade transfers from Moscow, \nthe  Russian  financial  crisis,  and  declining  prices  in  international  commodity  markets.  In  the \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nperiod 1991-95, GDP fell by 20%, a sizeable shock, but less dramatic than that experienced by \nother CARs. Positive growth resumed in 1996 at an average rate of 4.5%. According to official \nstatistics,  in  2000,  GDP  growth  was  4.0%,  the  inflation  rate  was  28%,  and  the  trade  surplus \nexceeded 0.8% of GDP. The country has thus been able to combine relatively steady economic \ngrowth with acceptable inflation levels and current account deficits since the mid-1990s. These \npositive indicators, however, largely reflect the Government\u2019s tight control over the economy.  \n \n10. \nIndeed,  the  most  challenging  task  within  macroeconomic  adjustments  remains  the \nliberalization  of  foreign  trade  and  exchange  regimes.  The  Government  initially  stated  that  it \nwould not seek International Monetary Fund (IMF) assistance in completing the macroeconomic \nstabilization, as it wanted to implement the reforms at its own pace to minimize the social costs \nto  the  population  at  large.  A  series  of  moderate  steps  were  introduced  in  2000  and  2001  to \nliberalize  access  to  and  sale  of  foreign  exchange  and  to  expand  foreign  trade  in  consumer \ngoods. However, uncertainty about the Government\u2019s commitment to achieve full liberalization \nof the currency, trade, and investment markets led to the de facto closure of the IMF Resident \nMission in April 2001. In parallel, Uzbekistan experienced a severe deterioration in its terms of \ntrade, caused by a drop in cotton and gold prices. Recently, the Government encountered rising \ndebt-service payments, and balance of payments pressures.  \n \n11. \nIn  this  macroeconomic  context,  and  in  the  aftermath  of  the  events  of  11  September \n2001,  which  raised  increased  international  attention  regarding  Uzbekistan\u2019s  security  and \nstability, negotiations with IMF resumed. An IMF mission visited Uzbekistan in December 2001 \nfor  discussions  with  the  Government  on  a  comprehensive  program  of  macroeconomic \nstabilization and structural reform to be monitored through a staff monitored program. The staff \nmonitored  program  was  declared  effective  in  February  2002.  Its  key  elements  include\u2014inter \nalia\u2014(i)  elimination  of  all  restrictions  on  access  to  foreign  exchange  for  current  account \ntransactions, (ii) reform of the state procurement system for raw cotton and grain, (iii) measures \nto  reduce  the  number  of  state  monopolies  and  monopoly  products,  and  (iv)  preparation  of  a \nstatistics  law  leading  to  the  establishment  of  an  independent  statistical  agency.  Based  on  the \nIMF\u2019s  positive  assessment  of  the  status  of  reforms,  the  monitoring  period  under  the  SMP  was \nextended until 31 August 2002 and preliminary discussions for an economic program that could \nbe supported by the IMF were initiated. \n \n12. \nThe  Government  continues  to  place  high  priority  on  human  development  and  social \nprotection, and is conscious that acceleration of the liberalization process may be painful for the \npopulation at large in the short term if it is not well managed and mitigated by appropriate safety \nnets. Some reform measures will result in the erosion of real income for pensioners and other \nvulnerable groups of society, as well as layoffs due to the restructuring of collective farms and \nindustrial state-owned enterprises. This, in turn, may jeopardize access to basic social services \nincluding  health,  education,  and  housing.  In  discussing  the  ESDP,  and  more  generally  the \nprogram  lending  approach,  the  Government  stressed  the  high  and  increasing  level  of  social \nspending, especially for the education sector, required to ease the social cost of the adjustment.  \n \nB. \n \n\nSector Description  \n\n1. \n\nStructure of Education  \n\n \n13. \nThe  Soviet  model  of  education,  which  emphasized  a  high  number  of  compulsory \nsubjects  in  general  education  and  highly  specialized  programs  in  technical  and  higher \neducation,  is  no  longer  consistent  with  the  need  for  greater  flexibility  required  in  a  modern \nmarket  economy.  Moving  away  from  such  a  model,  the  NPPT  foresees  major  changes  in  the \n\n\f \n\n4\n\nstructure of Uzbekistan\u2019s education system during the period from school year (SY) 1999 until \nSY2005.  \n \n14. \nFirst,  compulsory  education  is  being  extended  to  12  years,  maintaining  age  6  as  the \nminimum  school-starting  age  and  adopting  a  4-5-3  pattern.  As  shown  in  Appendix  2,  this \nsequence  will  consist  of  4  years  of  primary,  5  years  of  junior  secondary,  and  3  years  of  SSE. \nThe  previous  4-5-2  structure  will  thus  be  progressively  phased  out,  with  SSE  extended  to  a \nthree-year program by adding grade 12.  \n \n15. \nSecond, while the previous system was highly fragmented  \u2013 characterized by numerous \ntracks  and  types  of  institutions\u2014the  education  structure  is  being  streamlined  and  simplified. \nBasic education, referring to the nine years of instruction covering primary and junior secondary \neducation,  will  be  delivered  in  general  schools  only.  SSE  will  comprise  only  two  types  of \ninstitutions:  academic  lyceums  (ALs)  and  professional  colleges  (PCs).  ALs  have  a  general \nacademic  focus  and  prepare  students  for  tertiary  education,  while  PCs  emphasize  technical \nskills  and  prepare  students  for  entry  into  the  workforce.  All  technical  and  vocational \nestablishments  will  be  gradually  closed  or  converted  into  professional  colleges.  In  higher \neducation,  numerous  courses  and  diploma  programs  will  be  progressively  eliminated  and \nreplaced by four-year bachelor\u2019s programs, followed by two-year master\u2019s programs.  \n \nThird,  the  orientation  of  compulsory  education  will  undergo  a  fundamental  shift  away \n16. \nfrom  general  education  towards  technical  and  vocational  education  (TVE),  with  the  network  of \nPCs  expected  to  account  for  as  much  as  90  %  of  SSE  enrolments.  In  parallel,  education  in \ngeneral (i.e., academic) subjects will be included in a strengthened core curriculum introduced \nin PCs, and the number of specializations offered will be adjusted to demand.  \n \n17. \nAs  indicated  in  Appendix  3,  basic  education  currently  accounts  for  approximately 5.7 \nmillion students (2.6 million enrolled in grades 1-4 and 3.1 million in grades 5-9), 9,600 schools, \nand  410,000  teachers.  Although  the  implementation  of  the  new  structure  will  have  no  major \nimpact on total quantities of teacher personnel in basic education, friction is likely to arise from \nsubstantial internal reallocations. In view of demographic trends (which show a slight diminution \nof the school age population), and given the fact that grades 10 and 11 will no longer be offered \nin basic schools, there may be an overall surplus of facilities, enrollment capacity, and teachers \nin  the  subsector.  At  the  same  time,  there  is  an  emerging  qualitative  or  field-by-field mismatch \nbetween the supply of and demand for teachers. A significant number of vacancies cannot be \nfilled or must be filled by unqualified personnel, and there are persistent shortages of teachers \nfor certain subjects and in remote rural areas. \n \n18. \nIn terms of raw enrolments, the NPPT will mark the most dramatic change for the SSE \nsubsector. Current Government plans call for the establishment of 1,611 PCs with an enrollment \ncapacity of 1,020,000 students and 181 ALs with an enrollment capacity of 80,000 by the year \n2010. SSE expansion will involve the construction of new campuses and  boarding facilities as \nwell  as  the  conversion  of  former  technical  secondary  schools  into  PCs.  The  Government \nforesees that the new SSE system will require a total of about 120,000 teachers, whereas only \n75,000 are currently teaching in corresponding grades. Most teachers serving in technical and \nvocational  institutions  in  grades  10  and  11  in  general  schools  will  be  retrained  to  assume \npositions in the new type of institution. The Government also intends to attract young graduates \nas well as professionals from outside the education sphere to fill vacancies in ALs and PCs.  \n \n19. \nThe  higher  education  subsector  consists  of  over  60  institutions  (specialized  institutes \nand  universities,  usually  composed  of  several  faculties)  enrolling  roughly  196,000  students, \n\n\f \n\n5\n\ndown from 230,000 in 1994. The Government does not expect any increase in higher education \nenrollments due to the vocationalization of SSE. A rationalization of the subsector, by grouping \nhigher  education  institutions  and  reducing  courses  and  programs  offered  in  line  with  actual \ndemand, is under way.  \n \n\n2. \n\nAccess to and Participation in Education \n\n \n20. \nThe uninterrupted political commitment of both the FSU and the independent Republic of \nUzbekistan to support and adequately finance education resulted in considerable achievements \nin  terms  of  the  population\u2019s  access  to  and  participation  in  education.  The  adult  literacy  rate  of \nthe  national  population  is  estimated  at  99%.5  The  labor  force  is  well  educated  and  qualified: \n82%  of  workers  have  completed  basic  education,  of  whom  34%  have  completed  senior \nsecondary or higher education. As a result, Uzbekistan\u2019s well-developed human resource base \nis considered a major asset for its future economic development. \n \n21.  While  official  statistics  often  report  comprehensive  basic  education  coverage  with  only \nsmall disparities between rural and urban areas or between genders, there are indications that \naccess  to  education  declined  in  the  past  decade.  According  to  UNICEF  (Trans  MONEE  2001 \nDatabase) gross enrollment ratios decreased significantly between 1989 and 1999 at all levels \nof  education:  (i)  from  26%  to  16%  in  pre-primary  education,  (ii)  from  92%  to  88%  in  basic \neducation,  (iii)  from  67%  to  52%  in  senior  secondary  education,  and  (iv)  from  15%  to  6%  in \nhigher education. To a certain extent, the decline in participation in education reflects the surge \nin  school  dropouts  that  occurred  in  the  years  following  independence,  especially  in  the  rural \nareas.  Dropout  is  attributable  to  both  economic  reasons  (rising  direct  and  indirect  costs  of \nschooling),  and  poor  preparedness  for  primary  education  due  to  a  sharp  fall  in  preschool \nattendance.6   \n \n22. \nOther  important  problems  need  to  be  addressed  in  terms  of  equity  in  access  to \neducation,  in  particular  with  respect  to  the  situation  of  girls  and  ethnic  minorities.  Gender \ndisparities become more prominent as one moves upwards in educational levels. Women make \nup 39% of the total enrollment in higher education, declining to 25% for master\u2019s courses and \n12% for doctoral courses. Females\u2019 access to technical education remains restricted, especially \nin the scientific fields. As a result of these disparities, women tend to be employed in relatively \nfew  sectors  (e.g.,  education,  health,  food  processing)  and  have  far  fewer  opportunities  for \ncareer  advancement.  The  education  of  children  from  ethnic  and  linguistic  minorities  is  an \nimportant and sensitive policy issue. At present, over 10% of the schools of the country provide \ninstruction  in  the  languages  of  ethnic  minorities  (Russian, Kazak, Tajik, Karakalpak, Turkmen, \nand  Kyrgyz),  accounting  for  about  15%  of  total  enrolments  in  basic  education.  So  far,  the \nGovernment  has  maintained  its  political  commitment  to  provide  basic  education  in  the  seven \nnational  languages  (including  Uzbek).  However,  schools  for  minority  children  are  at  a \ndisadvantage  in  terms  of  availability  of  instructional  materials  and  textbooks  in  national \nlanguages,  as  well  as  teacher  qualifications.  Opportunities  for  further  education  are  also \nreduced for these children, who are not well equipped to enter the mainstream of Uzbekistan\u2019s \nSSE, conducted exclusively in the Uzbek language. \n \n \n                                                 \n5   The  decision  of  the  Government  to  switch  from  the  Cyrillic  to  the  Latin  script  will  effectively  lower  the  literacy  of \nmuch of the adult population. The adoption of the new alphabet is a particular concern for a majority of teachers \nwho may not master the new Uzbek script and hence may not be able to teach effectively. \n\n6   Preschool services used to be provided by employers, mainly state enterprises and farms. The corporatization and \n\nprivatization of public entities has resulted in closures of preschools and a dramatic fall in enrollment levels.  \n\n\f \n\n6\n\n3. \n\nManagement of Education \n\n \n23. \nUzbekistan\u2019s education sector does not perform well in terms of cost-effectiveness as a \nresult of rigidities from inherited central planning and budgeting systems. The education system \nis characterized by suboptimal utilization of public resources, reflected in small class and school \nsizes,  plus  low  efficiency  ratios  and  teaching  loads.  Structural and institutional changes in the \nsystem  are  necessary  to  modernize  sector  management  practices,  support  community \nparticipation  and  nongovernmental  funding  of  education,  and  improve  overall  efficiency  and \nequity in the utilization of educational resources  (physical, human, and financial). \n \n24. \nPolicymaking in education is the domain of the Social Complex of COM and the Office of \nthe  President.  In  spite  of  recent  and  rather  modest  changes,  management  of  the  education \nsector still rests on planning and budgeting methods inherited from the FSU. Centrally defined \nnorms and standards regulate the allocation of resources, leaving little flexibility for adjustment \nto  particular  situations.  Long-term  planning  of  capital  investment  and  projections  of  student \nnumbers and staff requirements are undertaken by MOMES. Projections of enrollments in SSE \nand  higher  education  institutions  are  determined  on  the  basis  of  a  rigid  manpower  planning \napproach and static regional labor market analysis. MOMES is also the  agency responsible for \npreparing  and  releasing  official  education  statistics,  while  other  central  agencies,  including \nMOPE, MOHSSE, MOF, and MOL, maintain their own data collection and processing systems. \nExisting information systems appear fragmented, and statistics produced often lack consistency \nand relevance to policy. \n \n25.  MOPE  and  MOHSSE  are  responsible  for  implementing  national  policies  in  their \nrespective  education  subsectors.  A  number  of  central  or  Republican  institutes  have  also  been \nestablished  with  varying  degrees  of  autonomy  vis-\u00e0-vis  the  two  ministries  to  oversee  the \nimplementation of policies and programs in certain reform areas and subsectors. These include \nthe  CSSE,  the  Republican  Testing  Center  (examinations  and  standard  setting),  Republican \nEducation  Center  (development  of  curriculum  and  textbooks),  CIESD  (in-service  training  of \nschool  teachers  and  administrators),  Central  Institute  for  Pedagogical  Research  (teaching \nmethods and processes), and Institute for Problems of Higher Education.  \n \n26.  With  the  NPPT,  the  Government  clearly  announced  its  intention  to  move  towards  a \nmanagement system that promotes administrative decentralization and encourages community \nparticipation  and  local  initiative.  Financing  and  management  responsibilities  of  the  school \nsystem  are  being  increasingly  devolved  to  local  governments.  The  administration  of  preschool \nand  basic  education  institutions  is  under  the  dual  responsibility  of  the  regional  governments \n(hokimiyat) and MOPE through its 14 regional (oblast-level) and 214 district (raion-level) offices \nthroughout  the  country.  Professional  colleges  are  administered  by  SSE  regional  offices \nreporting  to  both  CSSE  and  the  regional  governments.  With  a  few  exceptions,7  all  higher \neducation  institutions  and  AL  (usually  attached  to  or  established  under  the  auspices  of  a \nuniversity) are administered by MOHSSE. \n \n27.  Managerial procedures are being progressively overhauled, and educational institutions \nhave  now  acquired  some  autonomy  in  making  decisions  on the allocation of resources. Most \nsignificant advances include the abolition of norms regulating the recruitment of school support \n\n                                                 \n7  Pedagogical institutes, which train teachers for the basic education subsector, are a noticeable exception, as they \n\nreport to MOPE. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nstaff, the reduction in the number of budget categories,8 and the establishment of a new legal \nframework  conducive  to  community  involvement  in  schooling  and  mobilization  of  extra-\nbudgetary  resources  for  education.  Important  features  of  this  legal  framework  are  the \nauthorization given to schools to open special bank accounts to manage their extra-budgetary \nfunds,  and  the  creation  of  school  boards  to  express  community  views  on  decisions  affecting \nschool  affairs.  As  part  of  the  policy  to  encourage  community  involvement  in  education, \nmahallas9  are  expected  to  become  major  school  partners.  Many  of  them  have  already \nestablished commissions for education.  \n \n\n4. \n\nContent and Processes of Education  \n\n \n28. \nThe extent to which the knowledge, attitudes, and skills imparted by the education and \ntraining system are mastered by learners and contribute to the country\u2019s economic development  \nremains  largely  unknown  because  of  the  lack  of  pertinent  information  regarding  learning \noutcomes,  graduate  placement  in  the  job  market,  and  worker  productivity.  There  is,  however, \nevidence  that,  as  in  other  countries  of  the  FSU,  the  content,  processes,  and organization of \nUzbekistan\u2019s  education  system  should  be  revamped  to  better  serve  the  needs  of  changing \neconomic,  social,  and  political  conditions.  The  NPPT  acknowledges  the  need  for  fundamental \nreorientation of the education system towards one that is more suited to the requirements of a \nmarket economy and, at the same time, can further national identity and democracy.  \n \n29. \nEducational quality improvement, more particularly through the revision of curricula and \ntextbook content, has been the overarching priority of education authorities since independence.  \nThe perceived low quality and insufficient relevance of education are attributable to a number of \nfactors including outdated and ideologically biased curricula, non-interactive teaching methods, \nand poor quality instructional materials. In basic education, priority must be given to focusing the \ncontent  of  instruction  towards  core  competencies  and  to  better  preparing  students  for  lifelong \ntrainability.  A  new  emphasis  on  inculcating  problem-solving ability and creativity is especially  \nneeded  in  this  respect.10  In  technical  and  higher  education,  broad-based  skills  acquisition \nshould be emphasized to encourage graduates\u2019 employability and flexibility in the context of an \nevolving market economy, where labor market demand cannot be predicted well. \n \nGovernment efforts in the area of quality improvement culminated with the preparation of \n30. \neducational  standards  for  basic  education,  SSE,  and,  more  recently,  higher  education. \nStandards  encompas s  all  aspects  related  to  the  organization  and  the  content  of  educational \nprograms. The new basic education curriculum better reflects Uzbekistan\u2019s history and culture, \nand integrates subjects such as economics, computer, and environmental education. In parallel, \nthe new generation of latin-script textbooks is being introduced in a phased manner, a process \nthat started in 1996 and is expected to be completed in SY2003. At the SSE level, the variety of \ncourses requires larger efforts to develop new curricula and instructional materials. Curricula are \nstill in an experimental phase, and the translation of foreign textbooks into Uzbek is the favored \napproach in the short run. A significant achievement in the TVE subsector is the streamlining of \nprograms offered in PCs in around seven major fields: industry, transport and communications, \n\n                                                 \n8   School  budgets  now  includes  only  seven  categories:  (i)  salaries,  (ii)  staff  allowances,  (iii)  minor  civil  works  and \n\nmaintenance, (iv) utilities, (v) furniture and equipment, (vi) materials and supplies, and (vii) others. \n\n9   The mahallas\u2014traditional community organizations \u2014are already utilized by the Government as the principal body \n\nin charge of the administration of targeted social assistance and child allowance programs. \n\n10  International students\u2019 achievement tests have demonstrated that while students of the FSU tend to perform very \nwell  in  knowledge  of  facts,  their  capacity  to  apply  knowledge  or  to  use  it  in  unanticipated  circumstances  is  well \nbelow that of students from countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \n\n\f \n\n8\n\nconstruction and municipal services, agriculture and forestry, health, education, and economics. \nALs offer three major streams: natural sciences, humanities, and economics.  \n \n31. \nEfforts aimed at improving educational quality have been hampered by two factors: lack \nof  national  capacity  and  lack  of  financial  resources.  The  vast  majority  of  Uzbek  educators, \ncurriculum  specialists,  and  textbook  authors  have  never  been  exposed  to  alternative \napproaches to teaching and international experiences in curriculum reform. Educational quality \nmonitoring  systems  based  on  assessments  of  teaching  processes  and  learning  outcomes, \nrather than solely on input levels, should be developed. At the school level, resource constraints \nhave  aggravated  common  problems  such  as  shortages  of  instructional  equipment  and \nmaterials,  as  well  as  the  distressed  physical  conditions  of  classrooms  and  school  buildings. \nSchool  environments  must  become  more  conductive  to  effective  learning,  especially  in \neconomically disadvantaged areas.  \n \n\n5. \n\nTeacher Education \n\n \nBoth  pre-service  and  in-service  teacher  education  are  being  reformed  in  their  content \n32. \nand organization. As part of the new NPPT standards, all teachers are now required to obtain a \nBachelor\u2019s  level  degree  through  four  years  of  higher  education  and  must  receive  periodic \nrecertification.  At  the  primary  level,  approximately  66,000  teachers  (equivalent  to  54%  of  the \ntotal  number  of  primary  school  teachers), most of them serving in rural schools, are presently \nconsidered to be underqualified by the Government. Only a limited proportion of these teachers, \nabout 15%, have begun upgrading by means of correspondence studies with higher education \ninstitutions.  The  Government  considers  that  all  underqualified  teachers  should  receive  special \nupgrading  courses.  Moreover,  virtually  all  teachers  need  to  be  retrained  to  master  the  revised \nsubject contents under the new curricula, and to gain experience in modern teaching methods.  \n \n33. \nPreservice  teacher  education  comprises  a  variety  of  institutions  whose  roles  are  being \nredefined  in  line  with  the  new  educational  structure.  Pedagogical  colleges,  which  in  the  past \ntrained the majority of primary school teachers,  will now be exclusively responsible for training \nteachers  of  preschool  and  \u201cspecial  subjects\u201d  (music,  gymnastics,  drawing,  and  labor).  The \nnumber  of  pedagogical  colleges  will  accordingly  be  reduced  from  38  to  25  by  2005. \nPostsecondary  teacher  education  institutions  comprise  the  5  institutes  of  pedagogy  (IPs),  the \nTashkent  Pedagogical  University  and  16  faculties  of  pedagogy  (FPs).  In  general,  graduates \nfrom the IPs and the Tashkent Pedagogical University are employed mainly in basic education, \nwhile  those  from  the  FPs  usually  serve  in  SSE.  Pedagogical  colleges  and  institutes  report  to \nMOPE,  whereas  the  FPs  are  administered  by  MOHSSE.  A  priority  of  the  Government  is  to \nexpand the enrolment capacity of the FPs to respond to the need for additional teachers in the \nSSE  subsector.  Another  priority  is  to  revise  the  content  of  teacher  education  programs, \nadjusting  them  to  the  new  curricula  and  giving  more  emphasis  to  pedagogy  and  teaching \npractice.  \n \n34. \nIn-service  teacher  training  is  conducted  at  the  14  regional  in-service  teacher  training \ninstitutes (RITTIs). At the national level, CIESD provides pedagogical support for the staff of the \nRITTIs  as  well  as  in-service  training  for  education  managers  and  school  principals.  Present \nstandards require all staff categories to receive at least 156 hours of in-service training every 3-\n5  years  (depending  on  category).  RITTIs  are  functioning  at  about  only  60%  of  their  training \ncapacity,  reflecting  low  participation  in  training  courses.  Access  to  in-service  training  is \nparticularly  limited  for  teachers  serving  in  remote  areas,  especially  for  female  teachers,  who \nexperience difficulties attending courses for a variety of reasons including cost, travel time, and \nfamily obligations. MOPE\u2019s priority is to expand opportunities for in-service training by improving \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nthe  flexibility  of  the  current  system  and  introducing  new  delivery  modes  such  as  distance \neducation (DE). Insufficient duration of training, inadequate qualification of instructors, and the \nlack  of  educational  equipment  and  instructional  resources  are  other  critical  issues  to  be \naddressed for improvement of in-service teacher training.  \n \n35. \nSchool  supervision  and  teacher  support  functions  are  performed  by  district  inspectors \nand  methodologists  and  by  school  principals. In principle, inspectors effect school control and \nsupervision  and  are  responsible  for  verifying  schools\u2019  adherence  to  national  standards  and \nregulations; methodologists, specialized by subject, have a teacher support and advisory role, \nand should evaluate teachers\u2019 ability to deliver the new educational contents; principals provide \nprofessional guidance and coaching to teachers and monitor their job performance. In practice, \nhowever,  the  responsibilities  of  inspectors,  methodologists,  and  principals  are  not  clearly \ndelineated. Recent cuts in the number of district inspectors have left methodologists unprepared \nto  take  up  duties  formerly  assumed  by  inspectors.  Most  methodologists  and  principals  cannot \neffectively play their teacher support role, as they have not mastered new subject content and \nhave never been exposed to new methods of teaching. A new system for training of district staff \nthat  clearly  demarcates  responsibilities  by  position  is  becoming  urgent  to  restore  the  school \ninspection system and improve teacher support. \n \n\n6. \n\nService Conditions of Education Staff \n\n \n36. \nTeacher morale and motivation declined seriously after independence, but seem to have \nimproved  in  recent  years  thanks  to  the  efforts  made  by  the  Government  to  improve  the \nconditions  of  teachers.  Unlike  in  many  other  countries  of  the  FSU,  teachers  in  Uzbekistan \ngenerally  enjoy  stable  on-time payment of salaries; regular salary increases compensating for \nprice  inflation;  and  a  generous  system  of  incentives  and  benefits,  including  discounted use of \nutilities  services,  free  housing  in  rural  areas,  free  medical  service,  and  three  months  of  paid \nholiday.  However,  the  recruitment  of  teachers  for  remote  areas  remains  problematic,  which \nsuggests  that  the  package  of  incentives  and  benefits  should  be  reviewed  for  particular \ncategories of staff. More than low pay, poor teaching environments, lack of materials, and, for \nmany  teachers,  difficulties  in  coping  with  multigrade  classes  have  been  the  critical  factors \nimpeding their motivation. \n \nGiven that current norms of teaching loads 11 are very low, teachers commonly engage in \n37. \nother  activities  to  earn  additional  income.  These  often  include  second  jobs  outside  education, \nsuch as small plot cultivation and tutoring for a fee. The necessary augmentation of the teaching \nload will require many teachers to abandon one of their jobs and thus is likely to change teacher \nperspectives  regarding  their  employment  conditions  to  refocus  their  attention  on  salaries.  The \nGovernment is willing to reexamine teaching loads in connection with curricular changes and a \ncomprehensive review of service conditions of teachers. As part of this reflection, new career \ndevelopment  procedures  and  incentive  mechanisms  should  be  developed  with  a  view  to \nenhancing  teacher  motivation  and  performance.  While  seniority  remains  de  facto  the  principal \nfactor for professional advancement, the introduction of a performance-based promotion system \nconcurrent  with  the  adoption  of  more  flexible  salary  structures  allowing  for  larger  wage \ndifferentials  would  contribute  improving  staff  motivation.  Changes  in  the  remuneration  and \npromotion  system  should  also  reward  further  training  and  professional  development  of \npersonnel.  \n \n\n                                                 \n11  The  official  teacher  workload  is  14  hours  per  week  in  primary  education  and  16  hours  at  junior  and  senior \n\nsecondary levels.  \n\n\f \n\n10\n\n38.  Women make up the vast majority of education personnel, accounting for about 75% of \nschoolteachers, but remain largely underrepresented among upper-level staff categories. Their \naccess  to  in-service  training  and  further  education  is  limited,  restricting  their  career  prospects. \nTo a large extent, the characteristics of service conditions mirror the position of women in Uzbek \nsociety.  Low  salaries  combined  with  reduced  workload  and  generous  benefits  (in  particular \nmaternity leaves) encourage women to prioritize their family obligations vis-\u00e0-vis their careers. \nIn the long run, the improvement of teachers\u2019 status is expected to encourage a more balanced \ngender representation in the profession. \n \nC. \n \n\nGovernment Expenditure \n\n1. \n\nFunding Sources and Budget Allocations \n\n \n39. \nSince  independence  and  despite  tight  budgetary  conditions,  the  education  sector  has \naccounted  for  roughly  8%  of  GDP,  a  high  level  by  international  standards,  indicating  a \nsubstantial  effort  to  support  education.  The  share  of  education  in  total  public  recurrent \nexpenditures  has  remained  at  or  above  21%  since  1995.  Almost  90%  of  total  education \nexpenditure  comes  from  the  central  (Republican)  budget,  either  directly  (for  financing  higher \neducation  institutions  and  ALs),  or  through  transfers  to  regional  governments  (for  primary  and \nsecondary schools, and PCs). The remaining 10% is financed through tax revenues generated \nby local governments. Funding for noncompulsory levels of education (i.e., preschool and higher \neducation)  relies  in  part  on  extrabudgetary  sources,  namely  payments  made  directly  to \ninstitutions  by  students,  families,  companies,  etc.  Extrabudgetary  revenues  account  for  about \none  third  of  total  expenditures  by  higher  education  institutions,  and  are  comprised  primarily  of \nuniversity fees paid by employers for \u201ccontract students\u201d (distinguished from \u201cbudget students\u201d \nwho receive scholarships and in some instances stipends from MOHSSE) .12 \n \n40. \nAs  shown  in  Appendix  4,  the  subsector  distribution  of  public  recurrent  expenditure  on \neducation changed significantly beginning in 1998. With the phase-in of NPPT implementation, \nthe  share  allocated  to  SSE  increased  substantially  at  the  expense  of  basic  education.  SSE \naccounted  for  20.2%  of  total  education  spending  in  2001  against  13.6%  in  1997.  Another \nmarked  feature  of  education  budgets  is  the  relatively  low  share  allocated  to  personnel  costs \n(between  55-61%  since  1998)  and  to  materials  and  equipment.  In  contrast,  social  transfers \n(such  as  scholarships,  stipends,  and  food)  have  commanded  fairly  large  shares,  especially  at \nnoncompulsory education levels, putting a heavy burden on educational budgets. Stipends still \naccount  for  about  30%  of  public  spending  on  both  higher  education  and  TVE,  and  meals \nrepresent  almost  one  half  of  public  spending  on  preschool.  This  pattern,  which  reflects  the \nSoviet  era  legacy  of  generous  subsidies  to  students,  should  also  be  reconsidered  on  equity \ngrounds, as it tends tend to disproportionately benefit the more affluent parts of the population \nliving  in  urban  areas.  The  structure  of  education  budgets  by  cost  category  is  due  to  change \nsignificantly with the anticipated increases in teacher salaries, the elimination of stipends in the \nnew SSE system, and the progressive reduction in the number of budget students.  \n \n\n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n12  The share of contract students in the total number of students increased dramatically, from 10% in SY1997 to 54% \nin SY2002. This apparent large share of private funding of higher education must be interpreted with caution, as \nthe  bulk  of  extrabudgetary  revenues  still  comes  from  the  public  sector,  i.e.,  state  and  parastatal  enterprises  that \nfinance tuition fees and allowances for contract students.  \n\n\f \n\n11\n\n2. \n\nEfficiency and Equity in the Utilization of Resources \n\n \n41. \nAs noted in para. 23, budget allocations and personnel deployment are based on central \nnorms  inherited  from  the  Soviet  era.  Small  institutional  size,  and  low  teaching  loads,  \npupil:teacher  ratios,13    and  pupil:nonteaching  staff  ratios  suggest  that  savings  and  efficiency   \ngains can be realized without affecting educational access or quality. Conscious about the need \nfor improving cost efficiency in education, the Government has made some attempts to review \nstaffing and budgeting norms. The maximum class size was increased from 30 to 35 students, \nand  teachers  were  allowed  to  work  up  to  1.5  times  the  normal  workload.  Several  resolutions \nimposing  downsizing  of  the  apparatus  of  the  public  administration  were  issued  since  1999.  In \n2001, a government decree called for a further 16% reduction in the number of civil servants. In \ngeneral, such staff cuts in the education sector have been allocated without any assessment of \nthe  relative  shortages  or  surpluses  of  personnel,  by  category  and  level  of  administration, and \nthis  has  weakened  the  capacity  of  the  administration  to  deliver  services  and  manage  the \nreforms.  \n \nBoth  MOPE  and  MOHSSE  have  experienced  drastic  cuts  in  personnel.  In  contrast, \n42. \ncentral or Republican institutes and the RITTIs were protected. In regional and district offices, a \nlarge number of positions funded by the central budget were eliminated, and local governments \nhad  to  fill  some  vacancies  using  their  own  resources.  Reviewing  the  functions  of  the  central \ninstitutes  and  rationalizing  their  personnel,  streamlining  the  in-service teacher training system, \nand  strengthening  the  two  education  ministries  and  regional  administration  seem  to  be \nappropriate directions for future redeployment of administrative personnel. These assumptions,  \nhowever, will need to be confirmed in a comprehensive review, performed at the various levels \nof the administration covering staff numbers, status, functions, and tasks.  \n \n43. \nThere is also some scope for rationalizing the school network by  exploring the potential \nfor  developing  multigrade  teaching,  multiple  subject  teaching,  double  shifting,  and  school \ngrouping.  Teaching  and  nonteaching  staff  requirements  should  be  determined  in  light  of  new \nnorms and the preparation of a new school map. At  the SSE level, simple projections suggest \nthat  considerable  savings  and  efficiency  gains  can  be  achieved  by  increasing  the  envisaged \nsize of ALs and PCs, and adjusting the boarding capacity to current and foreseen needs. \n \n44. \nAnother  important  equity  concern  in  the  distribution  of  financial  resources  is  that  all \nregions  of  Uzbekistan  do  not  have  the  same  resource  base  to  deliver  basic  education  as  the \nresult of differences in local level tax revenues. Per pupil expenditure varies considerably across \nregions, from about SUM11,000 in Namangan Region to SUM19,000 in Navoiy Region. This is \nlikely to result in variations in the quality of the education provided. Budget transfers from central \nto  local  governments  are  needed  to  compensate  for  poorer  regions\u2019  lower  potential  to  raise \nprivate funds and mobilize community support. Greater regional autonomy in managing budget \nallocations (flexibility vis-\u00e0-vis central norms) would also likely result in an improved utilization of \nresources. Another equity issue relates to the current system of direct student support, which is \nboth  excessively  expensive  and  ineffective  in  reaching  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  of  the \npopulation. Improved targeting of beneficiaries in stipend and scholarship programs, based on \nobjective socioeconomic criteria, is particularly important in this respect. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n13  The average pupil:teacher ratios are estimated at 20-1 and 11-1, respectively, at the primary and junior secondary \nlevels. Such figures are comparable to those of countries in transition (19-1 and 12-1, respectively), but very much  \nat odds with countries with a similar level of GDP per capita. \n\n\f \n\n12\n\n3. \n\nFinancial Sustainability \n\n \n45. \nThe  capital  investment  costs  of  the  NPPT  are  considerable.  The  Government  initially \nplanned to invest about $3 billion equivalent in the expansion of the SSE system, accounting for \nan  estimated  40%  of  the  public  investment  plan  during  1999-2005.  Recently,  however,  the \nGovernment  decided  to  extend  the  time  frame  for  the  construction  of  the  network  of  new  PCs \nand ALs to 2009. Most of this funding is expected to come from local taxes raised by regional \ngovernments.  This  represents  a  considerable  effort  on  the  part  of  the  regions  and  a  drastic \nrestructuring  of  their  budgets.  On  the  recurrent  expenditure  side,  the  anticipated  increases  in \npersonnel  costs  (additional  teachers  for  the  SSE  subsector  and  payroll  increases)  will  put \nadditional  pressure  on  education  budgets.  In  addition  to  the  aforementioned  adjustment  in  the \nscale  and  time  frame  of  SSE  expansion  plans,  key  revisions  must  be  made  in  system wide \nnorms to enhance the financial sustainability of the NPPT.  \n \n46.  Mobilizing new sources of finance for education and improving efficiency in the utilization \nof public resources are two challenges to be addressed to enhance the viability of the reform. In \nthe first place, areas where substantial savings and efficiency gains could be made should be \nidentified. Cost savings should be sought in almost all budget categories, including (i) salaries \nand  related  expenses  (by  reviewing  norms  regarding  class  size,  staffing  levels,  and  teaching \nloads),  (ii)  social  transfers  (by  better  targeting  direct  subsidies  such  as  stipends),  (iii) \nconstruction and maintenance costs (by reviewing the school map, upgrading existing buildings, \nand reducing boarding facilities).  \n \n47. \nIn addition, appropriate strategies aimed at diversifying sources of finance for education \nhave to be worked out. Private-public partnerships have been successfully encouraged with the \nnew  law  on  the  financing  of  education  institutions,  allowing  schools  to  raise  and  manage \nextrabudgetary funds. The corporatization of the textbook publishing and printing industry is also \nunder  way  as  the  Government  abolished  the  system  of  free  textbook  provision  and  central \nprocurement. Nongovernment initiatives in the provision of educational services at the preschool \nand  higher  education  levels  should  be  further  encouraged.  Cost-sharing  or  cost-recovery \nmechanisms  in  the  public  education  system  should  be  developed  at  the  SSE  and  university \nlevels, with appropriate measures to offset any possible detrimental effect on access.  \n \nD. \n \n48. \nThe principal constraint and risk facing the reform is social support. Measures required \nto  improve  system  efficiency  frequently  entail  short-term  losses  for  certain  stakeholders,  and \nthus  may  face  resistance  from  within  the  education  system  (e.g.,  staff  retrenchment  and \nredeployment,  increased  teacher  workload,  reduced  budget  allocations  for  stipends  and \nscholarships,  closing  of  schools,  abolition  of  the  system  of  free  textbook  provision).  In  light  of \nthese risks, the Government has adopted a gradual and phased approach to reform. Particular \nattention has been given to mitigating the impact of introducing user charges upon the poor (for \ninstance, free textbook provision was continued for certain categories of pupils), while teacher \nsalaries and benefits have been protected.  \n \n49. \nInstitutional  development  and  capacity-building  needs  pose  a  second  set  of  sector \nconstraints.  At  the  central  level,  strengthening  national  capacities  in  policy  formulation  and \nstrategic  planning  is  critical  to  the  successful  implementation  of  the  reform.  In  particular,  \nimplementation  modalities  for  reform  must  be  further  refined  to  become  viable  (financially \nsustainable, technically and pedagogically sound) as well as better integrated into a full-fledged \ndevelopment  strategy  for  education.  Coordination  among  agencies  responsible  for  reform \n\nConstraints and Issues \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nGovernment Objectives and Strategy  \n\nimplementation  must  be  improved.  At  local  levels,  the  decentralization  process  should  be \nsupported  by  an  adequate  transfer  of  resources  combined  with  skills  development  programs. \nMoves towards decentralization constitute a radical change of management processes and face \na  number  of  constraints,  as  well  as  resistance  from  within the administration. Key partners of \ndecentralization,  including  school  principals  and  district  education  authorities,  should  be  better \nequipped in view of their anticipated expanding functions.  \n \n50. \nFinancial  management  issues  constitute  a  third  set  of  constraints  impeding  the \nimplementation of education reform. Current systems of budgeting and central norms cannot be \nsustained, and seriously threaten the reform\u2019s financial viability. Further revision of these norms \nis required to make resources available for critical investments in education quality improvement \nand  SSE  expansion.  To  further  alleviate  financial  constraints,  the  government  should  promote \nthe  introduction  of  cost-sharing  through  user  charges  where  possible,  and  establish  a  legal \nframework conducive to private sector involvement in education.  \n \nE. \n \n51. \nSince independence, education has maintained a prominent place in the Government\u2019s \nreform  agenda.  As  in  other  economic  and  social  spheres,  a legal and centralized approach to \nreform  was  adopted,  culminating  in  1997  with  the  adoption  of  a  new  Education  Act  and  the \nendorsement of the NPPT by parliament. The reform process has been characterized by a top-\ndown approach, which may have weakened the sense of ownership and understanding of the \nreform,  even  within  the  administration.  A  large  number  of  presidential  decrees  and  ministerial \norders  have  been  issued  since  the  adoption  of  the  NPPT  in  order  to  provide  guidance  to \nagencies  on  the  implementation  of  specific  reform  measures.  Evidently,  however,  the \nproliferation of legal measures, very often too narrowly focused on specific tasks or clienteles, \ncannot substitute for a well-prepared sector development strategy. The reform process could be \nenhanced  by  promoting  more  systemic,  technical,  and  participatory  approaches  based  on \ndialogue and consultation with educational stakeholders and civil society.  \n \n52. \nThe  Government  views  the  NPPT  as  a  unique  model  aimed  at  establishing  a  modern \nnational  education  system  meeting  both  international  standards  and  the  requirements  of  a \nmarket  economy  in  a  democratic  society.  Fifteen  strategic  directions  or  broad  principles  are \nstipulated in the NPPT, among which 7 are directly linked to the thrusts of the ESDP: (i) reform \nof educational content, (ii) integration of industry and education, (iii) development of interaction \nbetween  science  and  education,  (iv)  training  and  retraining  of  education  personnel,  (v) \nautonomy  and  self-sufficiency  of  educational  institutions,  (vi)  promotion  of  private  funding  and \nforeign  assistance  to  education,  and  (vii)  development  of  new  educational  technologies  and \nmethods.  \n \n53.  Most  decrees  elaborate  on  specific  actions  required  in  key  reform  areas  such  as  (i) \nquality  improvement  (e.g.,  preparation  of  new  basic  education  standards,  plans  for  the \nintroduction of the new generation of latin-script textbooks, norms on sanitation and hygiene in \nschools,  creation  of  the  Ustoz  Foundation  to  promote  teacher  retraining  abroad);  (ii)  SSE \nexpansion (e.g., plans for the construction of new PCs and ALs, norms on equipment, allocation \nof  plots  of  land  to  agricultural  PCs);  (iii)  modernization  and  decentralization  of  management \nsystems (e.g., establishment of monitoring units in agencies, financing of education institutions, \nuse  of  extrabudgetary  resources,  establishment  of  school  boards);  (iv)  budget  rationalization \n(e.g.,  instructions  on  staff  reductions,  abolition  of  the  system  of  free  provision  of  textbooks, \nelimination of stipends for SSE students); and (v) protection of special groups, the poor, and the \nvulnerable  (e.g.,  salary  increases  of  education  personnel,  free  provision  of  textbooks  and \n\n\f \n\n14\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector \n\nclothing  for  children  from  low  income  families,  introduction  of  a  student  loan  scheme,  free \naccommodation in SSE hostels for rural females).  \n \nF. \n \n54. \nOverall,  external  assistance  to  education  is  rather  modest  in  Uzbekistan,  involving  a \nlimited  number  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies.  ADB  is  by  far  the  principal development \npartner  of  the  education  sector  in  terms  of  scope  of  intervention,  funding,  as  well  as  policy \nadvice.  \n \n55. \nAs  shown  in  Appendix  5,  much  of  the  external  assistance  to  the  Uzbekistan  education \nsystem has been directed towards higher education and TVE. Major bilateral partners, including \nUS,  Japan,  and  Germany,  have  supported  domestic  and  overseas  training  programs  for  post-\nsecondary  students,  in  technical  fields  as  well  as  in  management  and  accounting.  The \nGovernment  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  have \nprovided loans on concessional terms to support expansion of the SSE system. The European \nUnion  is  an  important  external  partner  with  two  programs:  Technical  Assistance  for  the \nCommonwealth  of  Independent  States  (TACIS)  and  Trans-European  Mobility  Programme  for \nUniversity  Studies  (TEMPUS).  TACIS  projects  have  focused  on  management  training,  market \nskills  development,  and  agricultural  education.  TEMPUS  promotes  exchanges  between \nuniversities.  \n \n56. \nAssistance  to  basic  education  is  piecemeal  and  narrowly  focused.  The  United  Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund have \nbeen  active  in  this  subsector,  providing  support  to  schools  in  the  Aral  Sea  area.  The  British \nCouncil  has  supported  the  development  of  English  textbooks  and  related  teacher  training \nactivities. Other externally-assisted projects that involve basic education staff or may otherwise \nindirectly  benefit  that  subsector  inc lude  initiatives  in  democracy  and  civic  education  (Soros \nFoundation and US) and school management and legislation (TACIS).  \n \n57. \nClose  coordination  among  ADB  and  other  development  partners  has  taken  place  in \npreparing and implementing loans and technical assistance (TA) activities. The SSE project and \nthe  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation-supported  project  are  implemented  in  parallel, \nsharing a common project implementation unit (PIU) and employing coordinated implementation \nstrategies. While  at  the  project  level,  coordination  of  external  assistance  can  work  effectively, \nthere are no regular mechanisms for dialogue among development partners, nor a platform for \nconsultation  with  the  Government.  This  has  been  detrimental  to  planning  and  integrating \nexternal  assistance  to  education  into  a  coherent  strategic  framework.  The  Government  has \ntaken  several  initiatives  to  gather  and  mobilize  development  partners  in  support  of  the  NPPT, \nbut these have remained ad hoc consultations largely oriented towards fund-raising rather than \npolicy dialogue and long-term planning. \n \nG. \n \nEducation,  together  with  agriculture  and  transport,  has  been  a  priority  sector  for  ADB \n58. \nsince it began operations in Uzbekistan.  The country operational strategy identifies \u201cincreasing \nhuman  development\u201d  as  one  of  its  pillars.  ADB  is  currently  the  sole  external  agency  providing \nbroad  support  to  education  with  a  strategy  aimed  at  improving  the  quality  of  education  and \nstrengthening national capacities for sector reform management. \n \n\nADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy in the Sector \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nBoth the BETD and the SSE projects focus on educational quality concerns and respond \n59. \nto  urgent  needs  in  the  areas  of  curriculum  and  textbook  development,  as  well  as  teacher \neducation.  More  specifically,  the  BETD  Project  contributes  to  (i)  strengthening  national \ncapacities for curriculum and textbook development, (ii) modernizing and enhancing competition \nin  the  textbook  publishing  and  printing  industry,  (iii)  supporting  the  introduction  of  the  new \ngeneration of latin-script textbooks, and (iv) promoting student-centered teaching methods. The \nSSE Project is assisting the Government in piloting new foundations for development of the new \nSSE system. A total of 45 pilot SSE institutions are targeted for support, with attention focused \non external efficiency (i.e., linkages and relevance of the curriculum to students\u2019 learning needs \nand improvement of employment and higher education opportunities).  \n \n60. \nThrough  TA,  ADB  aims  at  strengthening  national  capacities  to  design,  manage,  and \nmonitor  educational  reforms,  with  an  emphasis  on  staff  development,  organizational  change, \nand  improvements  in  information  systems.  Two  TAs  accompanying  the  BETD  Project  have \nassisted  the  Government  in  (i)  establishing  an  education  reform  monitoring  capacity,  and  (ii) \nconducting a review of the costs and financing of education.14  A third major TA, accompanying \nthe  SSE  Project,  has  supported  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  SSE  subsector  development \nstrategy.15  ADB  TA  has  been  an  important  vehicle  of  sector  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment,  and  has  contributed  greatly  to  developing  the  information  base  in  the  education \nsector.  At  the  same  time,  TAs  have  helped  disseminate  modern  educational  planning \ntechniques and sector analysis concepts, laying the foundation for further policy developments \nand an improved quality of policy dialogue.  \n \n61. \nLessons learned from ADB operations in the education sector in Uzbekistan point to the \nnecessity  to  provide  adequate  backstopping  to  executing  agencies  in  all  areas  of  project \nmanagement.  The  absorptive  capacity  of  executing  agencies  (notably  understaffed)  and  their \nexperience with the procedures of external development partners remain weak. The capacity of \ngovernment agencies to recruit and retain project staff is also limited, given both the scarcity of \npersonnel  with  the  necessary  skills  mix  (in  particular,  good  command  of  English)  and  the  low \nlevel  of  salary  offered  in  the  administration.  Excessively  bureaucratic  decision-making \nprocesses, absence of delegation of authority to the level of project implementors, and deficient \nintra-Government coordination are other features of the administrative system that can cause \nimportant delays in routine project activities such as recruitment of consultants, procurement of \ngoods,  and  disbursements.  Access  to  information  also  follows  strict  procedures,  remaining  de \nfacto  restricted  and  difficult.  Essential  data  and  statistics,  often  readily  available  and  widely \ndisseminated in other countries, can be considered confidential in Uzbekistan. This peculiarity, \ncombined  with  the  opacity  and  complexity  of  information  (especially  financial),  has  rendered \nmore challenging the policy advisory role of ADB. Paras. 146-150 provide details on how these \nlessons were integrated into the design and implementation arrangements of the ESDP.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  \n\nRationale  \n\n \nA. \n \nImprovements  in  the  relevance  and  the  quality  of  education  are  critical  to  Uzbekistan\u2019s \n62. \ndemocratization  and  transition  to  a  market  economy.  A  better  educated  population  is  more \n\n                                                 \n14 TA 2947-UZB: Monitoring Implementation of Education Reform , for $900,000; and TA 2948-UZB: Capacity Building \n\nin Education Finance, for $500,000, both approved on 17 December 1997.  \n\n15  TA  3399-UZB:  Interim  Review  of  Senior  Secondary  Education  System , for $1,000,000, approved on 8 February \n\n2000. \n\n\f \n\n16\n\nproductive,  has  more  chances  for  engaging  in  lifelong  learning,  and  can  participate  more \neffectively  in  the  economic  and  social  spheres  of  the  country.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  education  system \nmust  also  be  reoriented  in  a  cost-effective and financially sustainable manner. The ESDP will \ncontribute  to  the  two  long-term  sector  objectives  of  quality  improvement  and  efficiency \nimprovement.  It  will  also  contribute  to  the  attainment  of  the  millennium  development  goals \n(MDGs)16 by improving the school environment and learning conditions in the poorest regions, \nthereby  combating  school  dropout  among  vulnerable  population  groups  and  promoting  equal \neducational opportunities.  \n \n63. \nSince the adoption of the NPPT in 1997, major achievements have been realized by the \nGovernment in reforming the education sector. Many of these achievements have resulted from \ndialogue with ADB through TA and have been implemented with support from loan projects. As \ndetailed  in  the  sector  description  chapter,  the  most  significant  developments  include  (i) \nimplementation of a new education structure, extending compulsory education to 12 years with \nthe addition of 3 years of SSE, (ii) streamlining of the types of institution and redefinition of their \nmandates,  (iii)  complete  revision  of  educational  content  at  all  levels  of  education,  and  (iv) \nintroduction of new textbooks. The first three years of radical reforms clearly prioritized activities \nnecessary  to  improve  the  relevance  of  education,  as  well  as  funding  of  the  expanded  SSE \nsubsector.  ADB  provides  selective  support  to  these  reform  areas,  more  specifically  by \ndeveloping  curriculum  development  capacities,  funding  the  preparation  and  dissemination  of \ntextbooks  in  core  subjects,  and  testing  new  curricula  and  management  practices  in  pilot  SSE \ninstitutions. \n \n64. \nFaced  with  growing  budget  constraints,  the  Government  has  increasingly  realized  that \nthe financial sustainability of the reform depends on sector efficiency gains and budget savings \nas well as on resource mobilization. In the past two years, the Government has been prompted \nto  accelerate  the  pace  of  sector  reforms  and  redirect  their  emphasis  towards  efficiency \nimprovements  and  protection  of  vulnerable  population  groups.  This  process  is  in  part  the \noutcome of the intensive policy dialogue maintained with ADB and supported through TAs and \nESDP  preparation  missions  since  mid-2000.  Recent  steps  taken  by  the  Government  along \nthese  lines  include  (i)  rephasing  of  SSE  expansion  plans  until  2010,  (ii)  measures  aimed  at \nreducing  the  direct  cost  of  schooling  for  the  poor  (e.g.,  free  provision  of  textbooks  and  winter \nclothing to students from low-income families, introduction of a student loan scheme), (iii) a legal \nframework  encouraging  the  autonomy  (management,  financial,  pedagogical)  of  education \ninstitutions  (e.g.,  authorization  given  to  schools  to  open  bank  accounts,  and  to  raise  and \nmanage  extrabudgetary  funding,  constitution  of  school  boards,  increased  flexibility  vis-\u00e0-vis \ncentral  norms),  (iv)  establishment  of  a  reform  monitoring  capacity  (units  established  in  the \ncabinet of ministers, in line ministries, as well as in regional governments), (v) more restrictive \npolicies  on  direct  support  to  higher  education  students  (reduction  in  the  proportion  of \ngovernment-assisted \u201cbudget\u201d students to 40 % of new entrants, differentiated rates of stipend), \nand (vi) further reductions of staffing levels (16 % as part of a global civil service retrenchment \nprogram).  \n \n65. \nThese  government  efforts  to  reorient  the  reform  process  will  be  further  extended  and \nsupported  through  the  ESDP  policy  framework.  The  ESDP\u2019s  combination  of  policy-based and \ninvestment  lending  is  considered  appropriate  and  timely  at  the  present  stage  of  education \nreform  in  Uzbekistan  in  view  of  (i)  the  strong  commitment  of  the  Government  to  accelerate \npolicy and institutional changes in the education sector, (ii) the magnitude of adjustment costs \n\n                                                 \n16 The two main education-related targets are (i) universal primary education by 2015, and (ii) elimination of gender \n\ndisparity in primary and secondary education by 2005. \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nObjectives and Scope  \n\nand  compensatory  measures  to  be  taken  in  relation  to  the  implementation  of the reforms, (iii) \nthe  high  level  of  investments  required  to  meet  the  challenges  of  educational  quality \nimprovement and SSE expansion, and (iv) the need for enhancing national capacities to design \nand implement sector reforms. \n \n66.  While  the  education  sector  has  benefited  from  both  high  political  priority  and \nconsiderable  budget  allocations  since  the  adoption  of  the  NPPT,  the  necessary  policy \ninterventions, adjustment measures, and investments must be carried out in a general context \nof fiscal constraints and possible resistance to change from education stakeholders. The ESDP \nwill help the government meet part of the adjustment costs involved in the implementation of the \nsector  reforms,  thereby  relieving  pressure  on  scarce  public  resources.  By  initiating  a  gradual \nand realistic process of policy development, involving stakeholder consultation and institutional \ncapacity  development,  the  ESDP  will  ensure  both  the  technical  soundness  and  social  support \nnecessary  to  implement  the  reform  measures.  It  will  thereby  promote  a  participatory  and \nsustainable  approach  to  change,  moving  away  from  a  top-down,  project-based  and  short-term \nvision that tends to characterize education reform processes in Central Asian countries.  \n \n67. \nThe  ESDP  represents  a  major  step  in  the  long-term  partnership  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB,  sanctioning  an  intensive  policy  dialogue  and  building  upon  past \ncollaboration experience. A particular merit of the ESDP is to integrate and enhance other ADB \neducation operations in an  articulated  manner,  building  upon  past  experience  and  maintaining \nthe  emphasis  of  support  towards  quality  and  efficiency  improvements  as  a  part  of  a  global \npoverty reduction agenda.  \n \nB. \n \n68. \nThe ESDP will contribute to the overall long-term goal of Uzbekistan\u2019s education reform: \nto  establish  an  education  system  responsive  to  the  needs  of  a  modern-market economy and \ndemocratic society. The objective of the ESDP is to support the implementation of the NPPT by \naddressing four major education challenges, namely (i) modernizing the structure, contents, and \nprocesses  of  education;  (ii)  improving  sector  sustainability  and  efficiency;  (iii)  reforming \ngovernance of education; and (iv) providing protection for the poor. The Program loan and the \nProject loan will complement each other to further progress towards those four challenges. \n \n69. \nThe Program loan will support policy interventions aimed at (i) allocating resources (i.e., \npersonnel and infrastructure) in a more efficient and equitable way, (ii) restructuring education \nbudgets in a pro-poor manner, (iii) enhancing the performance of teachers, and (iv) promoting \nequal education opportunities among population groups. \n \n70. \nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  enhance  the  quality  of  basic  education  and  to \nimprove  sector  management  practices.  To  this  end,  the  Project  will  (i)  support  policy \ndevelopments  in  critical  reform  areas,  (ii)  establish  a  distance  education  capacity  for  teacher \neducation,  (iii)  develop  training  modules and retrain school teachers in teaching methods and \nselected  subject  contents,  (iv)  train  rural  teachers  in  multigrade  teaching  techniques,  (v) \nenhance school management and supervision skills of principals and local level administrators, \n(vi) improve the physical conditions and resource base of schools in poverty-affected areas, (vii) \nassist  communities  in  establishing  school  boards,  and  (viii)  provide  grant  funds  accessible  to \nschools on a competitive basis.  \n \n \n \n\n\f18\n\n \n\n \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions \n\nC. \n \n71. \nThe  medium-term  policy  framework  of  the  ESDP  is  described in narrative terms in the \nDevelopment Policy Letter prepared by the Government (Appendix 6). The related set of critical \npolicy  actions  listed  in  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  7)  span  11  principal  policy  areas  grouped \nunder the four major sector challenges. For each action/measure, the policy matrix specifies (i) \nmonitoring  arrangements  or  implementation  modalities,  (ii)  time  frame  for  implementation,  (iii) \nintegration with other ADB-supported activities, and (iv) responsible government agencies. The \nimplementation  of  actions  to  be  carried  out  under  the  policy  matrix  will  be  carefully  phased, \nreflecting  the  preferred  gradual  approach  to  change,  and  acknowledging  the  constraints  and \nrisks associated with the implementation of adjustment measures. \n \nSalient features of the policy matrix include, inter alia (i) a staff redeployment plan based \n72. \non  an  organizational  audit  of  educational  administration,  (ii)  a  redefined  school  map  for  basic \neducation  and  SSE  institutions,  (iii)  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  service  conditions  of \neducation  staff  (workload,  salary,  incentives,  career  development),  (iv)  adjustment  of  the \nboarding  capacity  in  SSE  institutions  in  line  with  actual  demand,  (v)  monitoring  the  quality  of \nbasic  education  and  SSE,  (vi)  augmentation  of  the  weekly  workload  of  teachers  to  at  least  20 \nhours, (vii) improvements in the legal basis for the financial autonomy of education institutions \nand  the  generation  of  extra-budgetary resources,  (viii)  adoption  of  measures  to  support  the \nemergence  of  nongovernment  schools,  (ix)  supplementary  education  budget  allocations  for \nneedy  areas,  (x)  improved  targeting  mechanisms  for  granting  scholarships  and  stipends  to \nprotect  access  of  the  poor  to  higher  education,  and  (xi)  piloting  of  cost-recovery schemes in \nSSE and higher education.  The  policy  developments  supported  by  the  ESDP,  grouped  under \nthe four sector challenges and 11 policy areas, are summarized hereinafter. \n\n \n1. \n\nModernizing Structure, Contents, and Processes of Education  \n\na. \n\nStreamlining of the Education Structure  \n\n \n73. \nAs part of the overall education restructuring effort, the SSE system must become more \nflexible and better articulated, with basic education on the one hand and higher education on the \nother. The main concern is to improve the short-term employability of SSE graduates as well as \ntheir trainability and capacity to adjust to changing technologies and labor market conditions. To \nthis  end,  overspecialization  of  SSE  establishments  must  be  avoided  and  instructional  content \nshould prioritize knowledge and skills that can be applied in a variety of contexts and industries. \nA  more  flexible  and  cost-effective  concept  of  TVE  and  training  must  be  developed  to \ncomplement the formal SSE system. SSE flexibility and external efficiency will be enhanced by \n(i) reviewing the projected balance between the general stream and the vocational stream, i.e., \nthe balance between AL and PC graduates; (ii) strengthening the general education content  of \nthe three-year programs delivered in PCs; (iii) developing specialized short-term courses in PCs \n(in  particular  apprenticeship  programs  run  in  collaboration  with  local  businesses);  (iv)  granting \nmore pedagogical autonomy to institutions so as to allow them to better tailor their programs to \nlocal  contexts  and  employment  situations;  and  (v)  facilitating  access  of  PC  graduates  to \nuniversity education. The Government will review SSE expansion plans and strategies along the \nabove lines.  \n \n74. \nThe  Government  will  also  prepare  a  master  plan  for  reforming  higher  education, \nacknowledging  the  need  to  (i)  reorganize  the  subsector  in  a  less  fragmented  way  by \nencouraging grouping of institutions as well as cooperation for teaching and research, (ii) review \n\n\f \n\n19\n\ncourse  offerings  in  line  with  actual  needs  and  demand,  (iii)  develop  fair  and  transparent \nadmission mechanisms and procedures, and (iv) enhance teaching quality.  \n \n\nb. \n\nCurriculum Review and Educational Quality Monitoring  \n\n \n75. \nThe  Government  has  granted considerable priority to setting new education standards, \nrevising curricula, and introducing a new generation of latin-script textbooks. Yet, it recognizes \nthat curriculum and textbook development reforms are long-term processes and that continued \nefforts are necessary to further modernize educational content and method. A comprehensive \nreview  of  the  basic  education  curriculum  will  be  carried  out,  the  objective  being  to  further \nstrengthen the acquisition of fundamental knowledge and the development of aptitudes such as \ncritical thinking, problem solving, and creativity.  \n \n76. \nAt the same time, efforts will be pursued to increase the availability and affordability of \ntextbooks in basic education. To this end, MOPE will (i) continue to encourage competition and \nmodernization  in  the  textbook  publishing  industry,  (ii)  reduce  the  number  of  textbook  titles \nrequired in basic education, and (iii) implement a textbook rental system. At the SSE level, the \nimplementation  of  the  new  standards  and  curricula  will  be  gradually  completed,  and  new \ninstructional materials and textbooks will be developed. \n \nCurrent  systems  for  assessing  education  quality  need  to  be  reoriented  towards \n77. \noutcomes  and  achievements,  rather  than  inputs  and  norms.  A  study  on  monitoring of learning \nachievements  will  be  carried  out  by  MOPE.  This  study  will  also  help  identify  adjustments \nrequired  in  the  basic  education  curriculum.  In  parallel,  the  school  inspection  and  supervision \nsystem must be strengthened and reoriented towards teaching support. District level education \nadministrators,  including  inspectors  and  methodologists  as  well  as  school  principals,  will  be \nretrained in academic supervision and coaching. \n\n \nc. \n\nTeacher Education  \n\n \n78. \nUpgrading  teacher  education  to  support  the  implementation  of  new  curricula  and  the \ndissemination of modern teaching methods remains a high priority for the Government. Access \nof schoolteachers to in-service training will be expanded with the development of facilities, and \nprovision of equipment and materials for a newly established DE system. New modules will be \njointly  developed  by  in-service  and  preservice  teacher  training  institutions  and  integrated  into \ntheir  regular  programs.  The  Government  also  agreed  to  reward  teachers  receiving  DE \ncertificates with supplementary allowances. \n \n\n2. \n\nImproving Sector Sustainability and Efficiency  \n \na. \n\nStaff Redeployment  \n\n \n79. \nAn  organizational  audit  of  education  administration  combined  with  a  training  needs \nassessment will be carried out by the Government. The exercise will aim at informing decisions \nregarding  staff  redeployment  and  identifying  the  principal  areas  of  training  to  support  the \nmanagement  decentralization  process.  Upon  completion  of  the  audit,  the  Government  will \nsubmit  a  comprehensive  administrative  staff  redeployment  plan  providing  the  details  of  costs \nassociated with retraining, reassignment, and compensation of redundant staff.  \n \n80. \nThe Government will also increase the official workload of teachers, accompanied by at \nleast a proportional salary increase. A minimum norm for workload week will be reached. This \n\n\f20\n\n \n\n \n\nmeasure will align regulation with actual practice, and will contribute to better use of teachers in \nschools.  It  is  also  expected  to  play  a  screening  role,  acting  as  a  deterrent  to  multiple \noccupations  (which  detracts  from  teaching  quality)  and  encouraging  those  teachers  willing  to \nleave the education sector, to resign.  \n \n\nb. \n\nService Conditions of Education Personnel  \n\n \n81. \nTo raise the attractiveness of the teaching profession and improve teacher performance, \nthe  Government  will  develop  new  promotion  mechanisms  linking  salary  with  performance  and \ntraining.  The  introduction  of  incentives  for  special  categories  of  teachers?   including  those \nserving  in  disadvantaged  remote  areas  and  in  environmentally  depleted  areas,  and  those \nteaching  multigrade  classes? will  be  piloted  in  at  least  15  districts,  representative  of  the  four \nsocioeconomic regions of Uzbekistan. The details of these measures and their implementation \nmodalities will be defined through participatory policy studies.  \n \n82. \nThe Government is also conscious of the need to improve career prospects for women \nin the education sector and to facilitate their access to decision-making levels. By encouraging \ntheir  participation  in  management  training  programs,  the  proportion  of  women  occupying \nmanagerial positions in education administration is expected to be significantly raised during the \nprogram period, with specific numerical targets to be set.  \n \n\nc. \n\nRationalization of Facilities  \n\n \n83. \nA nationwide school and community survey, covering both basic education and SSE, will \nbe carried out to assess the conditions of education establishments and their environment, and \nto  make  recommendations  for  improving  efficiency  in  the  utilization  of  physical  and  human \nresources. The exercise will lead to the elaboration of a new school map in basic education and \na review of SSE expansion plans. The anticipated rationalization of the network of schools and \nSSE  institutions  should  result  in  an  increase  in  the  average  class  size  to  30  pupils  in  basic \nschools and 28 students in SSE institutions.  \n \n84. \nTaking  into  consideration  the  high  capital  and  recurrent  costs  of  boarding,  the \nGovernment will adjust boarding facilities in SSE and higher education according to their actual \noccupancy rates. The current projected level of 30% of total SSE enrollment accommodated in \nhostels is expected to be significantly reviewed downwards. \n \n\n3. \n\nReforming Governance of Education  \n\na. \n\nPolicy Formulation, Planning, and Financial Management \n\n \nNPPT implementation requires a radical overhaul of management processes, along with \n85. \nconsiderable strengthening of capacities for designing, managing, and implementing education \nreforms. Priority actions in the area of management improvement include (i) enhancing strategic \nplanning  and  policy  formulation  skills  at  the  national  and  provincial  levels,  (ii)  reviewing \nbudgetary  processes  and  norms,  (iii)  integrating  existing  information  systems  into  a  unified \neducation management information system, and (iv) improving accessibility and reliability of the \ninformation system. The Government will experiment with program budgeting in pilot institutions \nand  administrative  units,  preparing  for  a  more  general  shift  from  a  normative,  input-based \nbudgeting system to a more flexible and output-oriented budget process.  \n \n \n\n\f21\n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nSchool Management and Community Participation  \n\n \n86. \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  support  moves  towards  self-management  and \nautonomy of educational institutions at all levels. Further adjustments in the legal framework will \nbe  achieved  with  a  view  to  (i)  encouraging  the  mobilization  of  extra-budgetary resources, (ii) \ngranting  school  autonomy  in  managing  extra-budgetary  funds,  and  (iii)  supporting  the \nestablishment  of  school  boards.  A  school  initiatives  fund  (SIF)  will  be  established,  providing \nincreased access of disadvantaged schools to extra-budgetary resources while also constituting \na mechanism for strengthening community involvement in schooling.  \n \n87. \nAs part of a pilot project, modalities for introducing user charges for boarding services in \nSSE  institutions  will  be  determined  and  tested  in  15  districts  and  five  higher  education \ninstitutions. \n \n\nc. \n\nNongovernment Provision of Education  \n\n \nDeveloping nongovernment provision of education at noncompulsory levels is necessary \n88. \nto  enhance  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  entire  sector.  Communities  should  be  assisted  in \nestablishing and operating kindergartens in order to meet the demand for affordable pre-school \nservices.  At  the  university  level,  the  emergence  of  private  partners  will  be  facilitated  by  the \nestablishment of a legal framework defining accreditation modalities as well as fiscal incentives. \nOn  the  basis  of  policy  studies,  the  Government  will  identify  existing  constraints  hindering \nnongovernment  provision  of  education,  and  will  devise  legal  and  institutional  measures  to \novercome them.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProviding Protection for the Poor \n\na. \n\nTargeting of Deprived Areas \n\n \n89. \nTo  offset  regional  imbalances  in  educational  access  and  quality,  the  Government  has \nagreed  to  introduce  new  budget  mechanisms  aimed  at  increasing  central  resource  transfers \ntoward  deprived  areas.  A  policy  study  will  be  carried  out  to  define  such  mechanisms. The \nGovernment  will  also  implement  a  school  rehabilitation  program,  targeting  500  schools  in \nparticularly poor conditions, selected on the basis of the school and community survey. \n \n\nb. \n\nAssistance Schemes for the Poor and Vulnerable  \n\n \n90. \nThe Government is conscious about the need to mitigate the impact on the poor of the \nintroduction of cost-recovery measures and user charges. Several measures have already been \ntaken  to  reduce  the  direct  costs  of  schooling.  These  include  free  provision  of  textbooks for all \ngrade  1  students,  handicapped,  and  pupils  from  low-income  families.  The  Government  will \ncontinue  to  monitor  the  availability  and  affordability  of  textbooks  and  will  implement  a  school-\nmanaged textbook lending system.  \n \nDirect  student  support  mechanisms  must  be  reformed  to  better  reach  their  intended \n91. \nbeneficiaries,  i.e.,  those  who  cannot  afford  the  cost  of  education.  At  the  university  level,  the \nGovernment  will  pursue  its  efforts  to  rationalize  expenses  on  scholarships  and  stipends  by \nsetting  strict  criteria  for  attribution  aimed  at  targeting  high  achievers  from  poor  families.  The \nrecently  introduced  student  loan  scheme  will  be  assessed,  especially  as  regards  its  potential \nuse by poor students and its contribution to improving access to higher education. At the SSE \n\n\f \n\n22\n\nin \n\nCapacity Building \n\nThe  ESDP  will  address  capacity  building  concerns \n\nlevel,  the  Government  will  implement  a  pilot  project  aimed  at  assessing  the  impact  of  the \nintroduction of student allowances targeted towards the poorest.  \n \nD. \n \n92. \nthree  main  areas:  (i) \ndecentralization  of  management,  (ii)  teacher  education,  and  (iii)  policy  analysis.  In  the  area  of \nmanagement,  the  emphasis  will  be  put  on  the  implementation  of  job-related training programs \nfor  school  principals,  inspectors,  and  methodologists.  Support  will  also  be  provided  to  the \nconstitution  and  functioning  of  school  boards  to  facilitate  their  effective  involvement  in  the \nadministration  of  schools.  Capacity  building  for  delivering  teacher  education  will  cover  a  large \nnumber of preservice and in-service institutions and a wide range of activities including external \nand  in-country  training  of  teaching  staff  and  on-the-job  support  for  managers,  and  will  be \naccompanied  by  modernization  of  educational  equipment  and  replenishment  of  teaching \nmaterials.  Policy  studies  and  other  related  works,  including  the  school  and  community  survey \nand the organizational audit, will be carried out as participatory research to strengthen skills in \nareas such as financial management, strategic planning, functional analysis, microplanning, and \nschool  mapping.  Focused  teams  of  education  policy  makers  will  gain  awareness  of  foreign \nreform experiences in specific policy areas through study visits.  \n \nE. \n \n93. \nThe  investment  project  of  the  ESDP  will  concentrate  on  improving  the  quality  of \ninstruction  at  the  basic  education  level,  prioritizing  poor  and  remote  rural  areas,  and \nmodernizing  sector  management.  It  will  comprise  three  main  components:  (i)  strengthening \nsector planning and management capacities, (ii) improving and extending teacher education, (iii) \nstrengthening community involvement in schooling and improving learning conditions.  \n \n\nThe Investment Project  \n\n1. \n\nStrengthening Sector Planning and Management Capacities  \n\n \n94. \nThis component will support sector-wide restructuring and decentralization processes by \nimproving  the  information  base  for  policy-making  and  augmenting  local-level  management \ncapacities.  In  addition  to  supporting  project  implementation  capacities  and  establishment of a \nPIU,  the  component  will  comprise  three  subcomponents,  denominated  respectively  (i) \nevaluation  of  capacity  and  needs,  (ii)  policy  development,  and  (iii)  support  to  academic \nsupervision and school management.  \n \n95. \nAs part of the first subcomponent and at the earliest stage of the Project, a school and \ncommunity survey exercise will be conducted with the objective of guiding the rationalization of \nthe school network and personnel. In concert, an organizational audit and an assessment of the \ntraining  needs  of  administrative  staff  will  be  carried  out  as  inputs  to  future  decisions  on  staff \ndeployment and organizational changes in the educational administration. These exercises will \nlead to the elaboration of (i) a new school map for basic education, (ii) updated SSE institutional \nmapping, and (iii) an administrative staff redeployment plan. The Government will implement the \nnew school map and the staff redeployment plan as part of the ESDP policy framework. \n \n96. \nThe second set of activities will further policy developments by combining policy-focused \nresearch  studies  and  overseas  study  visits  of  national  decision-makers. Three working groups \nof  senior  officials  will  be  established  to  oversee  research  and  guide  policy  development \nprocesses in three critical areas: (i) staff development, (ii) education finance and budgeting, (iii) \nnongovernment  provision  of  education.  Focused  policy  studies  will  be  conducted  in  relation  to \n\n\f \n\n23\n\nthe implementation of selected measures to be undertaken by the Government under the ESDP \npolicy framework.  \n \n97. \nThe third subcomponent will strengthen the school inspection and management system \nin  support  of  the  decentralization  policy.  Drawing  on  the  findings  of  the  training  needs \nassessment  and  the  organizational  audit  carried  out  under  the  first  subcomponent,  job-related \ntraining  programs  for  school  principals  and  district-level  management  staff  will  be  developed, \ntested,  and  integrated  into  the  regular  course  of  CIESD.  Roughly  5,000  school  principals  and \n3,000  district-level  administrators  will  be  trained  in  the  areas  of  academic  supervision  and \nschool management with the support of the Project.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImproving and Extending Teacher Education  \n\n \n98. \nThis component will spearhead efforts to implement the new basic education curriculum \nand modern teaching methods. It will essentially consist of establishing a new, DE-based mode \nof  in-service  training  to  expand  access  to  training  for  school  teachers  poorly  served  by  the \ncurrent  system.  Four  subcomponents  have  been  identified:  (i)  DE  capacity  development,  (ii) \nupgrading  teaching  in  primary  schools,  (iii)  dissemination  of  new  teaching  methods,  and  (iv) \nupgrading teaching in junior secondary schools. \n \nThe first subcomponent will establish and develop a  national capacity for retraining and \n99. \nupgrading  teachers  through  a  system  combining  self-instruction  and  face-to-face  instruction \ndelivered  in  school-based  learning  resource  centers.  The  new  DE  system  will  follow  a  three-\ntiered  satellite  structure.  The  Development  Center  (DC)  located  in  CIESD  will  maintain  the \nprincipal responsibility for DE materials development, training of instructors, and coordination of \nprogram  delivery.  In  the  second  tier,  14  regional  coordinating  units,  located  in  the  RITTIs,  will \nsupport  program  delivery  and  the  dissemination  of  DE  materials  within  the  region.  Finally,  70 \npilot learning resource centers (LRCs), based in selected schools, will constitute the main venue \nfor  training  and  contact  sessions  between  instructors  and  teachers.  This  subcomponent  will \nprovide overseas and in-country training of managers and course designers of the DE system at \nthe national and regional levels as well as training of LRC instructors. All DE units (DC, regional \ncoordinating  units,  LRCs)  will  be  provided  with  modern  equipment  for  running  computer, \nscience,  and  language  classes  as  well  as  with  library  facilities  and  reference  materials. \nEquipment  and  materials  will  be  related  to  the  contents  of  the  DE  modules  and  can  be  also \nused by the recipient institution or school, integrated into regular teaching programs. \n \n100.  The second subcomponent will aim at upgrading teaching in primary schools, targeting \nmore particularly teachers from rural schools areas who serve under difficult conditions and are \nconsidered  as  underqualified  under  current  standards.  It  will  involve  (i)  the  development  of \nmultigrade  teaching  modules  and  the  implementation  of  a  cascade  training  program  aimed  at \n3,500 rural teachers; and (ii) the development of a trial DE course (Trial 1) on both the methods \nand  subject  contents  of  primary  instruction,  for  delivery  to  roughly  10,000  primary  school \nteachers during the project period. \n \n101.  The  purpose  of  the  third  sub-component  is  to  encourage  the  use  and  dissemination  of \nmodern  teaching  methods,  though  both  the  in-service  and  preservice  teacher  education \nsystems. Teaching staff from the 14 RITTIs, the 5 IPs, and 8 selected FPs will be jointly trained \nabroad, and upon their return will prepare teaching methodology modules in four  fields: (i) math \nand information technology, (ii) language, (iii) natural sciences, and (iv) social sciences. Modern \nequipment  will  be  provided  to  the  five  IPs  and  eight  selected  FPs,  for  the  purpose  of \ndemonstrating  teaching  methods.  A  trial  DE  course  (Trial 2) on new teaching methods will be \n\n\f \n\n24\n\ndeveloped,  with  some  contents  adapted  for  incorporation  into  regular  in-service or preservice \ntraining courses in the FPs and IPs. Roughly 180,000 basic education teachers are expected to \nbe  introduced  to  modern  teaching  methodologies  through  both  the  new  DE  courses  and  the \nregular in and preservice training.  \n \n102.  The  fourth  subcomponent  aims  at  facilitating  the  retraining  of  teachers  in  five  subjects \nwhere  shortages  of  experienced  teachers  are  most  marked,  namely (i) computer science, (ii) \nEnglish,  (iii)  history  and  law,  (iv)  physics,  and  (v)  economics.  Subject  content-based modules \nwill be developed to constitute the Trial 3 DE course. An estimated 7,000 teachers are expected \nto  obtain  certification  in  teaching  these  subjects.  Priority  will  be  given  to  teachers  required  to \nteach these subjects who lack any proper training.  \n \n\n3. \n\nStrengthening Community Involvement in Schooling and Improving  \nLearning Conditions  \n\n \n103.  This  component  will  further  efforts  to  enhance  the  autonomy  of  schools  and  reduce \nregional  and  urban-rural  disparities  in  the  teaching  environment.  It  will  comprise  two \nsubcomponents,  namely:    (i)  support  to  community  mobilization,  and  (ii)  school  upgrading  in \npoor areas.  \n \n104.  The first subcomponent will encourage the active involvement of communities in school \naffairs  by  assisting  communities  in  establishing  their  school  boards.  An  awareness  campaign \nwill  be  conducted  to  disseminate  information  regarding  opportunities  offered  under  the  new \nlegislation  on  the  financing  of  education  institutions  and  more  specifically  the  possibility  for \nschool  boards  to  open  their  own  bank  accounts  and  manage  extra-budgetary  resources. \nMahalla and school leaders will be the main audience for the sensitization program; those from \nselected communities will receive training and briefing. This subcomponent will also feature the \nestablishment of the SIF to support resource mobilization for schools located in deprived areas. \nThrough the SIF mechanism, an estimated 1,000 schools are expected to obtain block grants to \nfinance  school  improvement  initiatives  formulated  by  the  community.  Supported  by  a  national-\nlevel  SIF  Coordinator,  SIF  officers  will  be  appointed  in  each  region,  working  closely  with  local \nMahalla foundation authorities to support communities in preparing their applications.  \n \n105.  The  second  subcomponent  consists  of  an  upgrading  program  for  the  500  poorest \nschools,  incorporating  findings  from  the  school  and  community  survey.  It  will  comprise \nrehabilitation of facilities (heating, sanitation, safety hazards, etc.) combined with the provision \nof basic instructional equipment, furniture, and materials.  \n \n\n4. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n106.  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $97.1  million,  consisting  of  $28.8  million \n(29.7%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $68.3  million  equivalent  (70.3%)  in  local  currency  cost. \nTable  1  shows  project  costs  by  component.  Details  of  the  costs  estimates  and  financing  plan \nare provided in Appendix 8.  \n \n107.  The indicative financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2. ADB will finance \nroughly  39.6%  of  the  Project,  including  100%  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  14.2%  of  the \nlocal currency cost. \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\n25\n\nTable 1: Indicative Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n \n\nComponent  \n\nA.

The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  5  years.  A  quarterly  project \nimplementation schedule is provided in Appendix 9. The first 21 months will involve project start-\nup  activities,  including  the  conduct  of  the  organizational  audit  and  the  school  survey,  the \nestablishment of the DE system (including staffing and training of personnel), the development \nof  trial  DE  programs,  appointment  and  training  of  SIF  facilitators  in  each  region,  and \nidentification of target schools and project areas. \n \nF. \n \n\nSocial and Environmental Measures \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction Mechanisms and Social Concerns \n\n \n109.  Mitigating the potential negative impact of education reform on the poor and vulnerable \npopulation  groups  is  a  major  concern  of  the  Government.  The  ESDP  policy  framework \nspecifically  includes  protection  of  the  poor  as  one  of  its  four  pillars.  Several  measures  of  the \npolicy  matrix  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  promoting  pro-poor resource allocations in \nthe education sector. Social equity and poverty  reduction concerns are largely integrated in the \ndesign  features  of  the  investment  project,  in  particular  through  a  geographical  focus  of \ninterventions  on  remote  rural  areas,  careful  targeting  of  beneficiaries,  and  partnership  with \nmahallas. The poverty reduction impact of the ESDP is summarized in Appendix 10. The main \nsocial issues are addressed in the ESDP the following way:  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n26\n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nPlans for downsizing the administration and rationalizing the school networks will \nbe  better  informed  thanks  to  preliminary  feasibility  studies  (organizational  audit, \nschool  survey),  while  possible  negative  social  and  educational  impacts  will  be \nmitigated. \n\nIn cases where the new school map indicates the need for merging and closing \nschools, particular attention will be paid to maintaining access for rural students \nto basic education. \n\nDirect student assistance schemes will be better targeted towards needy higher \neducation  students  by  integrating  social  criteria  in  the  allocation  of  scholarships \nand stipends.  \n\nSSE student allowances, based on socioeconomic criteria, will be introduced as \npart of a pilot experimental project. \n\nRegional  imbalances  in  the  provision  and  quality  of  education  will  be  alleviated \nby introducing funding mechanisms favoring the poorest districts.  \n\nSchool-based project interventions, in particular the school rehabilitation program \nand  the  SIF  grants,  will  be  targeted  towards  poor  and  remote  areas  where  the \ncapacity of the community to support education is relatively low.  \n\nThe primary beneficiaries of the expansion of teacher upgrading programs will be \nthose  teaching  in  more  remote  areas  or  otherwise  considered  vulnerable \n(redundant, underqualified, or de facto excluded from training opportunities). \n\n2. \n\nEnvironment \n\n \n110.  The ESDP will have no adverse environmental consequences. Physical works planned \nunder  the  Project  are  minimal,  consisting  essentially  of  facilities  upgrading  and  rehabilitation. \nRepair work will be carried with due regard for the use of appropriate and safe materials, energy \nand heating efficiency, and the natural and learning environment to be established. Health and \nhygiene standards will be improved in beneficiary institutions, especially in the 500 poor schools \nto be rehabilitated, thanks to the upgrading of sanitation facilities. \n \n\n3. \n\nGender Issues \n\n \n111.  As  women  make  up  the  vast  majority  of  teachers,  they  will  largely  benefit  from  ESDP \nactivities  aimed  at  improving  teacher  service  conditions,  reforming  the  career  development \nsystem,  and  expanding  in-service  training  opportunities.  It  is  expected  that  the  proportion  of \nwomen  trained  under  the  Project  will  exceed  70%.  The  low  representation  of  women  in \neducation  administration  and  especially  at  senior  managerial  levels  is  also  addressed  in  the \npolicy matrix. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \nA. \n \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n27\n\nV. \n\nTHE LOANS \n\n1. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds \n\n \n112. \nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  education  reform  package  by \nproviding a loan of $70 million from its ordinary capital resources (OCR). The borrower will be \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan. The loan will have an amortization period of 15 years, including a \ngrace period of 3 years, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London Inter-\nBank  Offered  Rate  (LIBOR)-based  loan  facility,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \nThe  loan  is  expected  to  be  utilized  over  a  period  of  four  years  and  will  be  disbursed  in  three \ntranches of respectively $30 million, $20 million, and $20 million.  \n \n113.  Factors that have been considered in determining the amount of the Program loan are (i) \nthe relative importance of the education sector (in terms of public spending and number of civil \nservants) and the rising trend of public spending on education following adoption of the NPPT; \n(ii) the scope and strength of the reform package in the education sector, and in particular the \nacceleration  of  reforms  in  2001;  and  (iii)  the  estimated  short-  and  medium-term adjustment \ncosts of the reforms.  \n \n114.  The  loan  amount  is  roughly  equivalent  to  the  adjustment  costs  of  the  sole  measures \nincluded in the policy matrix during the program period and not yet initiated by the Government.  \nThe breakdown of the estimated adjustment costs  of the principal policy measures comprises (i) \ncompensation, retraining, and relocation of redundant staff ($13.1 million); (ii) salary increases, \nallowances,  and  incentive  schemes  for  particular  categories  of  teachers  ($17.6  million);  (iii) \nbudget  transfers  to  poor  regions  ($27.2  million);  and  (iv)  direct  support  to  students  from  poor \nfamilies ($4.6 million). Costs of other measures of the policy matrix, including research, studies \nand consultations related to policy developments, education quality monitoring, and curriculum \nevaluation are estimated at roughly $10 million. \n \n\n2. \n\nExecuting Agency \n\n \n115.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  Program  loan.  MOF  will  be  responsible  for \ninitiating  withdrawals  under  the  loan,  and  for  allocating  and  monitoring  the  use  of  counterpart \nfunds.  COM  will  remain  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  policy  measures  under  the \nProgram loan. An inter-agency steering committee (IASC), chaired by the deputy prime minister \nin  charge  of  the  social  sectors,  has  been  established  by  the  Government  to  oversee  the \nimplementation  of  the  ESDP  and  facilitate  inter-agency  coordination.  IASC  comprises \nrepresentatives  of  COM,  MOF,  MOMES,  MOPE,  MOHSSE,  and  MOL.  The  head  of  the \nSecretariat of the Social Complex of COM will act as director of the ESDP and secretary of the \nIASC,  with  particular  responsibility  for  ESDP  implementation  monitoring,  including  both  the \nProgram  and  the  Project  loans.  The  overall  ESDP  management  structure  is  depicted  in \nAppendix 11. \n \n\n\f \n\n28\n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disburseme nt \n\n \n116.  The proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the foreign exchange costs of items \nproduced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member  countries.  The  loan  will  not  finance  items \nspecified  in  Appendix  12  or  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources. \nDisbursement of loan proceeds will be permitted on the basis of a certification provided by the \nBorrower. Procurement of eligible items financed under the Program loan will be carried out in \naccordance with standard public sector procedures of the Government or normal private sector \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB.  \n \n117.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  standard \ndisbursement procedures. Prior to submitting the first application to ADB for withdrawal from the \nloan  account,  the  Borrower  will  open  a  deposit  account  at  the  National  Bank  for  Foreign \nEconomic  Activity  of  Uzbekistan  (NBU)  or  another  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  into  which  all \nwithdrawals  from  the  loan  account  will  be  deposited.  The deposit account will be established, \nmanaged, and liquidated in accordance with terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. Separate \naccounts and records with respect to the deposit account will be maintained in accordance with \nconsistently  maintained  sound  accounting  principles.  Upon  ADB\u2019s  request,  the  Borrower  will \nhave  the  deposit  account  audited  by  independent  auditors  in  accordance  with  appropriate \nauditing  standards.  Promptly  after  their  preparation,  certified  copies  of  such  audited  accounts \nand records will be furnished to ADB.  \n \n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n118.  The Borrower will establish, in a manner satisfactory to ADB, a special account, at NBU \nor  another  bank  acceptable  to  ADB,    for  the  specific  purpose  of  depositing  and  utilizing  the \ncounterpart  funds.  Whenever  the  Borrower  withdraws  proceeds  of  the  loan  from  the  loan \naccount,  the  Borrower  will  promptly  deposit  into  the  special  account  the  equivalent  amount  in \nsum. Separate accounts and records with respect to the special account will be maintained in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards.  Certified  copies  of \nsuch audited accounts and records will be furnished to ADB promptly after their preparation. \n \n119.  The counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the loan will be used by the \nGovernment  to  finance  the  costs  associated  with  the  implementation  of  the  education  reform \npackage  under  the  ESDP.  These  include  essentially (i) compensation and retraining costs for \nredundant,  relocated,  and  transferred  staff;  (ii)  payroll  increases  in  connection  with  the \naugmentation  of  the  teacher  workload,  the  introduction  of  a  performance-based  promotion \nsystem,  and  new  incentives  for  certain  categories  of  personnel;  (iii)  costs  for  implementing \nmechanisms  to  support  needy  students  and  pupils;  (iv)  supplementary  budget  allocations  for \neducation in poor areas; (v) costs incurred for monitoring the quality of education; and (vi) costs \nof research, surveys, policy studies, and consultations.  \n \n\n5. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n \n120.  Since 1998, ADB has assisted the Government in establishing a capacity to monitor the \nimplementation of education reform. The present structure and organization of the Government \nmonitoring  system  were  established  with  the  support  of  TA  2947-UZB (footnote 14). The TA \nalso  identified  information  needs,  conducted  staff  training,  and  set  up  data  collection \n\n\f \n\n29\n\nmechanisms,  laying  the  foundation  for  a  sound  information  system.  Structures,  information \nflows, databases, tools, and staff capacities that have been developed with ADB support will be \nutilized  for  the  purpose  of  the  ESDP.  Program  monitoring  arrangements  will  thus  draw \nessentially  on  existing  government  capacity  so  as  to  ensure  full  integration  into  the  broader \neducation reform monitoring system. In parallel,  further  support  will  be  extended  by  the  TA  to \nensure proper monitoring and evaluation of policy developments supported by the ESDP. Such \nsupport will include staff skills upgrading (particularly in the area of policy analysis and strategic \nplanning),  further  improvements  in  the  reliability  and  transparency  of  information  flows,  and \nmechanisms for collecting policy-relevant indicators.  \n \n121.  Through IASC, the Government will monitor the implementation of policy and institutional \nreforms envisaged under the ESDP. IASC, meeting on a quarterly basis, will draw upon work of \nthe Education Reform Implementation Monitoring Unit (ERIMU) of COM. ERIMU comprises one \nhead,  two  professional  staff,  and  two  support  staff.  Its  main  functions  are  to  provide  policy \nadvice on the directions of education reform and to report to COM on the implementation of the \nNPTT.  ERIMU  is  responsible  for  maintaining  and  updating  the monitoring information system \nalready established with ADB support, coordinating the work of monitoring departments of line \nministries  (MOPE,  MOHSSE,  CSSE),  and  monitoring  the  working  groups  of  regional \ngovernments. As part of this information system, ERIMU will collect and analyze relevant data \nfor the specific purpose of monitoring the implementation of the ESDP.  \n \n122.  ERIMU will prepare and submit to ADB and IASC quarterly progress reports in a format \nacceptable  to  ADB.  Quarterly  reports  will  analyze  institutional  and  legal  developments  in  the \neducation  sector  as  well  as  the  evolution  of  key  indicators,  with  an  emphasis  on  areas  and \nmeasures  of  the  policy  matrix.  Appendix  13  provides  an  indicative  list  of  core  performance \nindicators  of  the  ESDP,  specifying  benchmarks  to  be  achieved  by  its  end,  and  the  expected \nimpact on education outcomes.  \n \n123. \nIn  cooperation  with  COM,  ADB  will  carry  out  semiannual  review  missions  to  assess \nprogress in the implementation of the Program and discuss major policy development with IASC \nand concerned agencies. Two of such missions will be fielded to assess whether conditions for \nthe release of the second and third tranches of the loan have been fulfilled.  \n \n124.  The first tranche will be released upon loan effectiveness, expected in December 2002. \nThe  second  tranche  is  expected  to  be  released  by  March  2004  (or  about  15  months  after  the \nfirst  tranche),  and  the  third  tranche  by  March  2005  (or  about  12  months  after  the  second \ntranche). To obtain the release of the tranches of the loan, the Government will be required to \ncarry out actions specifically identified in the policy matrix as conditions for tranche release, and \nto demonstrate satisfactory progress in the implementation of other actions listed. \n \nB. \n\nAmount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds \n\n \n125. \nIt is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $38.5 million, financed from its ordinary capital \nresources,  as  part  of  the  investment  project  of  the  ESDP.  The  loan  will  have  an  amortization \nperiod of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, with interest determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n\nThe Project Loan \n \n1. \n\n\f \n\n30\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Arrangements and Executing and Implementing Agencies \n\n \n126.  COM, under the supervision of IASC, will act as Executing Agency of the Project and will \ncoordinate  the  work  of  the  implementing  agencies.  A  PIU,  reporting  to  the  Social  Complex  of \nCOM,  will  be  responsible  for  all  day-to-day  aspects  of  project  management  and  coordination \namong  implementing  agencies.  The  PIU  will  work  under  the  guidance  of  MOPE\u2019s  first  deputy \nminister,  acting  as  project  director.  The  PIU  will  comprise  five  full-time  professional  staff  (a \nproject  manager,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer/deputy  manager,  a  finance  officer,  a \nprocurement  officer,  and  a  consulting  services  and  training  officer)  and  two  support  staff. \nAdditional staff support may be provided to the PIU in the course of the implementation of the \nProject as needs arise. \n \n127.  For  each  of  the  three  project  components,  implementation  responsibilities  will  be \ndevolved to implementing agencies according to their mandates and capacities. COM will be the \nimplementing  agency  for  component  1  (strengthening  sector  planning  and  management \ncapacities), with ERIMU as the principal responsible body. MOPE and MOHSSE will jointly be \nthe implementing agencies for component 2 (improving and extending teacher education), with \nCIESD, RITTIs, and the pilot schools selected as LRCs as the principal responsible bodies. The \nMahalla Foundation will be the implementing agency for component 3 (strengthening community \ninvolvement in schooling and improving learning conditions), with its training center as principal \nresponsible body.  \n\n \n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n \na. \n\nConsultant Services and Research Studies \n\n \n128.  The  project  will  provide  145  person-months  of  international  and  948  person-months of \ndomestic consulting services. Details of the distribution of consultants by project subcomponent \nare  shown  in  Appendix  14.  Consultants\u2019  services  will  be  grouped  into  four  main  packages  as \nfollows:  (i)  package  1.1  (for  component  1  of  the  Project):  organizational  audit,  school  and \ncommunity  survey  and  policy  studies;    (ii)  Package  1.2  (also  for  component  1  of  the  Project): \nproject  management  and  implementation  support;  (iii)  Package  2  (for  component  2  of  the \nProject):  DE  system  development;  and  (iv)  Package  3  (for  component  3  of  the  Project): \ncommunity participation and SIF establishment. The international and domestic consultants for \npackages  1.1,  2,  and  3  will  be  engaged  through  consulting  firms  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. To provide \non-the-job support to the PIU staff at an early stage, the international consultants for package \n1.2 will be recruited as individuals.  \n\n \nb. \n\nFellowships and Training \n\n \n129.  The  Project  will  finance  a  total  of  78  person-months  of  overseas  study  visits  for  78 \npersons,  and  672  person-months  of  short-term  courses  abroad  for  224  persons.  The \norganization  and  management  of  out-of-country  training  activities  (study  visits  and  short-term \ncourses  abroad)  will  be  part  of  contracted  consulting  firms\u2019  responsibilities.  For  out-of-country \ntraining,  the  Government  will  follow  criteria  agreed  upon  with  ADB  for  the  identification  of \ntrainees. The Government will implement a bonding system to ensure that fellowship recipients \ncontribute  to  the  preparation  of  training  modules  supported  by  the  Project  and  remain  in  the \neducation service for at least two years after completion of overseas training. \n\n\f \n\n31\n\n \n130.  The  Project  will  also  finance  approximately  800  person-months  of  in-country training in \nthe  form  of  workshops  for  about  2,400  participants,  comprising  principally  staff  of  the  DE \nsystem,  trainers  of  teachers,  and  school  and  mahallah  leaders.  The  Government  will  also \nensure that staff are released from duties as necessary in order to participate in these activities. \nAll  in-service  and  preservice  teacher  training  activities  will  be  organized  and  funded  by  the \nGovernment,  comprising  the  full-time  equivalent  of  roughly  165,000  person-months. Appendix \n15 provides the list of staff development activities. \n\n \nc. \n\nCivil Works \n\n \n131.  Civil works for the Project institutions will be fully financed by the Government, and will \nbe  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  procurement  procedures \nacceptable to the ADB.  The project institutions where civil works will be required include (i) 500 \npoor schools, (ii) 5 PIs and 8 FPs, (iii) CIESD and the 14 RITTIs, and (iv) 70 schools (5 in each \nof the 14 regions selected by regional authorities and MOPE) hosting LRCs.  \n \n132.  Civil  works  will  consist  essentially  of  upgrading  and  rehabilitating  facilities,  including \nschool  buildings,  but  also  sanitation  and  communications  infrastructure  as  deemed  necessary \nfor the implementation of the Project. As a general  rule, prior to the procurement of equipment \nfor the project institutions, the Government must demonstrate that the required civil works have \nbeen carried out and sites adequately prepared for the purpose of the Project. \n\n \nd. \n\nEquipment and Furniture  \n\n \n133.  The  Project  will  finance  the  procurement  of  educational  and  office  equipment  and \nfurniture  for  traditional  and  DE-based  teacher  training  institutions.  Equipment  packages  will \ncomprise essentially computer hardware and software, audiovisuals, duplicating machines, and \nlanguage  and  science  laboratories.  The  Project  will  also  provide  basic  educational  equipment \nand furniture to the 500 targeted poor schools.  \n \n134.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  managing  procurement  of  all  equipment,  furniture,  and \ninstructional  materials  required  for  project  implementation.  Procurement  of  goods  financed \nunder the ADB loan will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nItems of similar types will be grouped together as far as possible to permit bulk procurement and \nto encourage international competitive bidding. Prior ADB approval of lists and specifications of \nequipment,  furniture,  and  instructional  materials  will  be  required.  Appendix  16  gives  the \nindicative values and modes of procurement for different types of equipment.  \n\n \ne. \n\nInstructional Materials \n\n \n135.  The Project will finance the procurement of instructional materials for the teacher training \ninstitutions.  These  will  be  procured  through  international  shopping  or  direct  purchase \nprocedures as applicable. The Project will also finance the production of the printed DE modules \ndeveloped as well as supporting multimedia materials. In view of the limited financial amounts of \nindividual  packages,  all  printing  jobs  will  be  awarded  to  local  firms  selected  through  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n\n\f \n\n32\n\nf. \n\nSchool Initiatives Fund \n\n \n136.  The  Project  will  establish  a  SIF  in  an  amount  of  $2  million  to  support  community \ninitiatives  in  education.  Roughly  1,000  schools  are  expected  to  receive  grants  (each  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $3,000) directly deposited into their bank accounts through the SIF \nmechanism.  Grants  are  to  be  used  for  locally  available  and  inexpensive  items  (such  as \ninstructional  materials,  consumables,  basic  furniture,  and  limited  maintenance  of  equipment) \nand for direct support to needy students. Appendix 17 describes the objectives, scope, school \neligibility criteria, approval procedures, and monitoring mechanisms for the SIF. \n \n\ng. \n\nAdvance Action and Retroactive Financing \n\n \n137.  Advance  action  may  be  started  from  the  date  of  beginning  of  appraisal  (24  January \n2002)  using  government  funds,  which  will  be  reimbursed  out  of  the  project  loan  retroactively \nafter  loan  effectiveness.  Retroactive  financing  under  the  loan  may  not  exceed  the  amount  of \n$200,000  equivalent.  Advance  action  will  be  required  for  (i)  establishment  of  the  PIU  office \nfacilities  and  procurement  of  the  necessary  equipment,  (ii)  appointment  of  PIU  staff,  (iii) \nselection and engagement of individual consultants, (iv) preparation of tender specifications for \nprocurement,  and  (v)  preparation  of  detailed  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  and \ninvitation documents for the consulting firms.  \n\n \nh. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n \n138.  To  facilitate  project  implementation,  the  Government  will  channel  part  of  the  loan \nproceeds  into  an  imprest  account  to  be  used  for  financing  eligible  small  expenditures.  The \nimprest account will be solely for the Project\u2019s purposes and will be established at the NBU. The \nimprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with \nthe ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, January 2001 and with detailed arrangements agreed \nupon by the Government and ADB. The ceiling of the imprest account will be $250,000.  \n \n139.  A second Imprest account will be established at the NBU for the purpose of the SIF, also \nwith a ceiling of $250,000. SIF grants will be disbursed directly from the imprest account to the \nbank  accounts  of  individual  beneficiary  schools  upon  approval  of  their  SIF  application.  The \nimprest fund will be replenished every quarter on the basis of actual disbursements made under \nthe  SIF  in  the  preceding  quarter.  Statement  of  expenditure  procedures  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  January  2001  will  be  used  for  the  reimbursement  and \nliquidation of the imprest account. Statements of expenditures will be prepared by the PIU and \nsubmitted to the project director for transmission to ADB. \n\n \n4. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n \na. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Auditing  \n\n \n140.  The  Government  will  ensure  the  maintenance  of  records  and  accounts  to  adequately \nidentify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the loans. Separate accounts of the \nProject  will  be  maintained,  and  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by \nindependent  auditors  whose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable \n\n\f \n\n33\n\nto ADB. Certified copies of such accounts will be submitted to ADB within six months after the \nclose of each fiscal year. All such reports and statements will be submitted in English.  \n \n141.  The PIU will prepare quarterly progress reports in English in a format acceptable to ADB \non  the  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  reports  will  indicate, among other things, progress \nmade  against  established  targets,  problems  encountered  during  the  quarter,  steps  taken  and \nsteps proposed to resolve the problems, compliance with loan covenants, and proposed project \nactivities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  following  quarter.  A  project  completion  report  will  be \nprepared within three months of project completion.  \n\n \nb. \n\nReviews \n\n \n142.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake annual reviews of the Project to assess \nprogress, identify constraints, and agree on strategies for resolving constraints. During the first \ntwo years of implementation, semiannual reviews are recommended. A comprehensive midterm \nreview of the Project will be undertaken by the Government and ADB in the second half of the \nthird  year  of  its  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation  arrangements  of  the  Project;  (ii)  identify  changes  needed  since  the  time  of \nproject  appraisal;  (iii)  assess  progress  of  the  project  implementation  against  performance \nindicators;  (iv)  establish  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (v)  if  necessary,  recommend \nchanges in the design or implementation arrangements.  \n\n \nc. \n\nInformation System  \n\n \n143.  The PIU, in collaboration with the implementing agencies, will develop a monitoring and \nevaluation information system to assess the Project impact and its effectiveness in reaching the \nintended beneficiaries. The monitoring and evaluation officer of the PIU will be responsible for \nmaintaining  the  system  and  for  collecting  and  analyzing  data  in  cooperation  with  the  project \nimplementing agencies. Key indicators of the system will also be used in the quarterly progress \nreports prepared by the PIU and ERIMU. The monitoring and evaluation system will endeavor to \ninclude participation by beneficiary communities and individuals. In addition, the PIU will prepare \nand  submit  to  IASC  and  ADB  (i)  an  interim  evaluation  report  on  the  DE  courses  developed \nunder the Project, (ii) an interim evaluation report on the SIF mechanism, and (iii) an evaluation \nreport on the out-of-country training activities. \n \n\nVI. \n\nBENEFITS AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \n144.  The  policy  reforms  supported  by  the  ESDP  will  generate  economic  and  social  benefits \nby improving efficiency and equity in the distribution of educational resources (financial, human, \nand  physical),  quality  of  instruction,  and  institutional  development.  The  ESDP  benefits  will \naccrue primarily from (i) reduction of operating costs following rationalization of the network of \nschools;  (ii)  savings  in  total  payroll  through  downsizing  and  redeployment  measures;  (iii) \nsavings  on  expenses  on  scholarships  and  stipends  in  higher  education  through  improved \ntargeting; (iv) improved performance of teachers, who will be better trained and motivated with \nnew  incentives;  (v)  improved  teaching-learning  environments,  especially  in  poverty-affected \nareas, resulting in higher student achievements and improved retention; (vi) improved capacities \n\n\f \n\n34\n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\nto  manage  education  reforms  at  the  central,  local,  and  school  levels;  (vii)  improved  capacity \nutilization  of  existing  in-service  teacher  training  institutions;  and  (viii)  augmentation  of  teacher \ntraining capacity and reduction in the cost per trainee through the adoption of DE modalities. An \neconomic analysis of the ESDP is presented in Appendix 18.  \n \n145.  The immediate beneficiaries of the ESDP will be (i) roughly 250,000 school teachers, (ii) \nstaffs  of  the  RITTIs  and  of  the  IP  and  FPs,  (iii)  roughly  10,000  school  principals  and  district \neducation administrators; (iv) staff and pupils of 500 rehabilitated schools (over 5 % of schools \nnationwide) located in the most deprived areas, and (v) staffs and pupils of about 1,000 schools \naccessing  SIF  resources.  The  ultimate  beneficiaries  of  the  ESDP  will  be  the  6  million children \nenrolled  in  basic  education,  whose  schooling  will  become  more  relevant  and  whose  learning \nenvironment will become more stimulating.  \n \nB. \n \n146.  Low  government  commitment  to  reform,  weak  ownership  of  the  policy  package, \ninsufficient  consultation  with  the  Government,  and  overly  complex  and  ambitious  policy \nconditionalities  are  considered  the  major  risks  of  policy-based  lending.  There  have  been \ninstances where the Government suddenly shifted policies and made decisions of a legal nature \nwithout  proper  feasibility  assessment  and  implementation  capacity.  The  ESDP  formulation \nprocess  attempted  to  minimize  these  risks  in  several  ways:  (i)  the  ESDP  policy  framework  is \nwell articulated with the NPPT, which received political commitment at the highest level; (ii) the \nduration of the Program, the number of tranches, and the phasing policy actions conform with \nthe  gradual  approach  to  change  adopted  in  Uzbekistan;  and  (iii)  consultation  on  a  detailed \npolicy matrix started at an early stage of ESDP preparation; concentrated on a few core reforms \n(building  upon  the  findings  of  other  ADB-supported  TAs);  and  involved  IASC,  whose \ncomposition remained stable. The articulation between policy actions and project interventions \nof the ESDP gives additional safeguards as regards the implementability of the reform package. \nMeasures  of  an  institutional  or  legal  nature  indispensable  to  the  implementation  of  the  Project \nhave  been  inserted  in  the  policy  matrix.  Conversely,  the  Project  will  support  policy studies to \nensure that policy changes are appropriately designed and their feasibility fully assessed from \nthe financial, institutional, and educational perspectives. The policy matrix also articulates ESDP \nreform actions with interventions supported by other ongoing ADB operations.  \n \n147.  The  provision  of  counterpart  funds  and  staff  in  a  timely  manner  is  another  major  risk \ninherent to ADB operations in Uzbekistan. This risk has been minimized by the requirement of \nupfront  actions  by  the  Government  regarding  establishment  of  the  project  management  and \nmonitoring  structure  (establishment  of  IASC,  PIU,  and  ERIMU).  The  DE  expert  positions, \nalready endorsed by the Government, are expected to be filled by qualified education personnel \n(reassigned primarily from the RITTIs) so that the additional burden on the government budget \nwill be kept minimal (reflecting only the salary differential). The recurrent cost implications of the \nProject have been carefully identified and reviewed by the Government. \n \n148.  Transparency  and  accuracy  of  data  (in  particular  for  monitoring  purpose)  constitute \nanother major problem resulting from both the noted deficiencies in existing information systems \nand  low  analytical  capacities.  Poor  quality  and  low  policy  relevance of indicators may lead to \ninaccurate analyses and possible mistargeting of interventions. This risk is considered limited in \nview  of  the  assistance  that  TA  2947-UZB  has  already  extended  and  will  further  provide  in  the \nareas of monitoring of education sector reforms in general and ESDP monitoring in particular.  \n\n\f35\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn  spite  of  recent  progress,  the  project  implementation  capacities  of  central  agencies \n149. \nremain weak, potentially causing important implementation delays. Staffs of executing agencies \nneed  to  be  adequately  trained  in  all  areas  of  project  management  and  particular  guidance  is \nrequired  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  procedures.  The  upfront  appointment  and  training  of \nPIU and ERIMU staff, the engagement of international individual consultants to assist the PIU in \nproject administration, and the support provided to ERIMU by TA 2947-UZB constitute essential \nsafeguards of the ESDP.  \n \n150.  Deficient intragovernmental coordination and decision-making processes are other noted \nproject implementation risks. The characteristics of the ESDP management structure contribute \nto  minimizing  these  risks  by  facilitating  concerted  action  and  information  sharing  among \nagencies  while  respecting  the  existing  hierarchical  lines  and  delineation  of  responsibilities. \nImplementation  arrangements  and  responsibilities  are  shared  among  several  agencies \naccording  to  their  respective  mandates  and  to  avoid  overloading  any  single  agency.  Both  the \nPIU and ERIMU are placed under COM, the organ overseeing line ministries. IASC, composed \nof  high-level  government  officials  representing  the  main  NPPT  implementation  agencies,  will \nensure  interagency  coordination  and  facilitate  the  resolution  of  important  project  and  program \nimplementation  issues.  Senior  officials  have  been  entrusted  with  the  functions  of  ESDP \ndirector/IASC secretary and project director. \n\n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n151.  The Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents:  \n \n\nThe  Government  will  fulfill  conditions  agreed  upon  and  specified  in  the  policy \nmatrix for the release of the second and third tranches of the Program loan, and \nwill promptly adopt other policies and actions included in the  ESDP as described \nin the Development Policy Letter and the policy matrix. \n\nThe Government will ensure that IASC meets on a quarterly basis throughout the \nESDP  implementation  period  for  the  purpose  of  ESDP  monitoring,  and  that  ad \nhoc  IASC  meetings  are  convened  promptly  where  deemed  necessary  to  settle \nproject implementation issues requiring high-level decisions. \n\nThe  Government  will  carry  out  rehabilitation  and  other  civil  works  in  the  project \ninstitutions  to  ensure  that  adequate  conditions  are  met  for  the  establishment of \nthe  DE  facilities.  All  civil  works  should  be  completed  at  CIESD,  the  14  RITTIs, \nand 35 LRCs within 6 months after the project loan becomes effective; civil works \nat the 5 PIs, 8 FPs, and remaining 35 LRCs will be completed within 18 months \nafter loan effectiveness. \n\n(iv) \n\nThe Government will make appropriate budget allocations for the rehabilitation of \nat least 200 schools in 2003, 150 schools in 2004, and 150 schools in 2005, and \nwill furnish to ADB, on a semiannual basis, the list of schools rehabilitated, as per \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n\f \n\n36\n\nthe  poor  school  rehabilitation  program,  demonstrating  convergence  with  those \nsites identified in the school and community survey supported by the Project.  \n\nThe Government will ensure that civil servants to be trained under the Project\u2014 \nprimarily teachers, school principals, and district administrators\u2014will be selected \naccording  to  criteria  agreed  upon  with  ADB  and  will  be  released  from  regular \nduties  as  necessary  to  permit  their  participation  in  training  activities  and  (as \nrequired) the development of teacher education modules.  \n\nThe  Government  will  implement  a  bonding  system  to  ensure  that  staff  trained \noverseas  under  the  Project  remain  in  the  education  service  for  at  least  two  full \nacademic years. \n\n \n(vii)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness, staff of the DE system based at CIESD, \nthe  14  RITTIs,  and  35  LRCs  will  be  appointed;  personnel  of  the  remaining  35 \nLRCs will be appointed within 18 months after loan effectiveness. \n\n \n(viii)  The  Government  will  bear  all  recurrent  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  the \nestablishment  of  the  DE  system,  including  staff  salaries  and  related  payments, \ntransportation, \nmaintenance  of  equipment  and \nsupplies and materials, and other operating expenses.  \n\nfacilities,  communications, \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  throughout  the  duration  of  the  Project,  all \npersonnel contributing to its implementation receive remuneration commensurate \nwith their responsibilities and workload.  \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  appropriate  education  authorities  (including \nMOPE,  MOHSSE,  and  the  Republican  Testing  Center)  oversee  the  preparation \nof  the  DE  modules  developed  under  the  Project  to  facilitate  the  accreditation  of \nthe three trial DE programs developed.  \n\n \n(xi)  Within  one  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  complete  the \n\nestablishment of a monitoring and evaluation system for the Project.  \n\nConditions of Loan Effectiveness \n\n \nB. \n \n152.  Prior  to  effectiveness  of  the  Program  loan,  the  Government  will  establish  the  deposit \naccount at the NBU.  \n \n153. \neffective upon fulfillment of the following conditions: \n \n\nIn  addition  to  standard  conditions  for  effectiveness,  the  project  loan  will  be  declared \n\nrecruitment  of,  and  signing  of  contracts  with,  the  individual  international \nconsultants to support the PIU as foreseen under package 1.2; \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n \n(x) \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n37\n\nsubmission of a document specifying implementation arrangements between the \nExecuting Agency (Cabinet of Ministers) and the Mahalla Republican Foundation \nfor component 3 of the Project; and \n\nthe  Program  Loan  Agreement  will  have  been  duly  executed  and  delivered  on \nbehalf  of  the  Borrower,  and  all  conditions  precedent  to  its  effectiveness  shall \nhave been fulfilled. \n\n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n \n154. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loans  for  the  Education  Sector  Development  Program \n(ESDP)  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove \n \n(i) \n\nthe  loan  of  $70,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Program \nComponent  of  the  ESDP  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  with  interest  to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based loan facility and with an \namortization  period  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  and  such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; and  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nthe loan of $38,500,000 to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Project Component \nof the ESDP from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with interest to be determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  loan  facility  and  with  an  amortization \nperiod of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board. \n\n \n \n \n \nTADAO CHINO  \n    President \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n22 October 2002 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 1, page 1  \n\nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Target \n\nAssumptions and risks \n\nMonitoring \nMechanism \n\n \n\u2022  National legislation \nand policies on \neducation \n\u2022  Educational \nbudgets and \nstatistics \n\u2022  Reports of the \n\neducation reform \nimplementation \nmonitoring unit \n(ERIMU) and \nmonitoring units of \nthe various \nagencies  \n\n\u2022  Education Sector \nDevelopment \nProject (ESDP) \npolicy matrix and \nefficiency indicators \n\n \n\u2022  Government \n\n\u2022 \n\ncommitment and \npolitical will to reform \neducation  \n\u2022  Sustained budget \nallocations to \neducation consistent \nwith the reform \nagenda \nTechnical and \nmanagerial capacity \nto design and \nmanage the reform \n\u2022  Coordination among \nministries and \ninstitutions; \nindividual incentives \naligned with overall \npriorities \n\n \n\n \n\u2022  Educational \nbudgets and \nstatistics \n\n\u2022  New sector reform \n\ndecrees \n\n\u2022  Reports of ERIMU \nand monitoring \nunits of the various \nagencies  \n\n\u2022  Midterm and final \n\nproject reviews and \nevaluations \n\u2022  Reports of the SIF \nregional facilitators \nand national \ncoordinator  \n\n\u2022  ESDP policy matrix \nand efficiency \nindicators \n\n \n\u2022  Government \n\ncommitment to \nimprove system \nefficiency  \n\n\u2022  Consensus on new \nnorms (staffing, \nworkload, salaries, \netc)  \n\n\u2022  Availability of \n\ncounterpart \nfinancing and staff \nfor establishment of \nthe distance \neducation (DE) \nsystem \n\u2022  Access to and \n\nreliability of statistics \nand data  \n\n \nDesign Summary \n\n1.

Outcomes\nof the  first  phase  of  education  reforms  were  evaluated,  and  objectives  for  the  second  phase were\nidentified.\n\nDuring  the  past  four  years,  a  new  system  of  continuous  education  and  training  was\nintroduced  in Uzbekistan.  It encompasses  preschool,  basic education,  senior  secondary  education\n(SSE),  including  technical  and  vocational  education  (TVE),  higher  education  and  post-graduate\neducation.  A  new  foundation  for  lifelong  learning  has  been  laid,  espousing  self-upgrading  through\neducation  and  training  as  a  basic  human  right  and  a  key  to  societal  progress.  The  legal,\ninstitutional,  pedagogical,  financial,  and material conditions for further  development  of the education\nsystem are being established.\n\nin  particular.  has  provided  key  assistance  to  education \n\nInternational  cooperation  and external  assistance  are  of  particular  importance  to  support\nthe  momentum  of  sector  reforms.  The  international community,  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) \nframework  of  the\nimplementation  of  the  NPPT.  Two  ADB  projects,  the  \"Basic  Education  Textbook  Development\nProject\"  and  \"Senior  Secondary  Education  Project\"  contribute  to  enhance  education  quality  by\nproviding  critical  assistance  in  the  area  of  curriculum  development  and  textbook  preparation.  To\naugment these  efforts,  the  Government  requested ADB support  in formulating  an  Education  Sector\nDevelopment  Program  (ESOP).  The ESOP, through its policy component.  will  contribute  to re-orient\nthe  education  system  in a  more  effective and sustainable way  and  will  strengthen  pro-poor  budget\nallocations.  Four  major  sector-wide  challenges  are  being  addressed \nin  the  education  policy\nframework:  (i) modernizing  the  structure, contents, and processes  of education;  (ii) improving  sector\nsustainability and efficiency;  (iii)  ~eforming governance of education;  and (iv)  providing  protection for\nthe poor.  Progress achieved  and further developments foreseen  in each  of these  interrelated  areas\n\nin  the \n\nare discussed below.\n\nI.\n\nDuring the  first  four  years  of  NPPT reforms, new  education  standards \n\nfor  basic,  SSE,  and\nhigher  education  were  developed.  The  standards  were  tested  on  a  pilot  basis  in  selected\n\n,\n\n,\n\n..\n\nr\n\n.\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix  6,  page  2\n\neducational  institutions.  New\ndeveloped, dedicated to democratic  principles, highly professional, and independent.\n\nstandards  are  directed  to  nurturing  individuals  who  are  harmoniously\n\nTo  advance  the  capability  of  students  to  acquire  knowledge,  creative  ability,  and  critical\nthinking skills, the  Government  will  thoroughly  review  the  curriculum  of  basic  education.  Priority\nwill also be given to assessing  standards  for SSE given the anticipated expansion  of this  sub-sector\nand  its  role  as  channel  between  basic  and  higher  education.  The  ultimate  objective  is  to  provide\nSSE  graduates  with  good  job  prospects,  adaptability  to  changing  market  conditions  and  new\ntechnologies,  and  opportunities  to  pursue  further  education.  Special  attention  will  be  given  to\ndefining instructional  contents  at each  level in the framework  of the continuous  educational  system,\nand  to  emphasize  generic  skills  and  basic  knowledge  rather  than  narrow  specialization.  New\ntextbook  and  curricular  content  will  focus  on  skills  that  can  be  applied  in  different  areas  and\nindustries.\n\nThe  Government  intends  to  improve  SSE flexibility  and efficiency  in several  ways.  In the\nfirst place,  plans and strategies  for  the SSE expansion  will be regularly reviewed  and assessed. An\nappropriate  balance  between  the  two  types  of  institutions,  e.g.  academic  lyceums  (ALs)  and\nprofessional  colleges  (PCs).  should  be  achieved.  Institutions  should  be  given  more  autonomy  in\ndeveloping courses that are relevant  to local conditions and responsive to the  demand for education\nand training services.\n\nAs pari of the  overall  review  of the education  structure, the Government  will  prepare a long-\nterm  plan  for  reforming  higher  education.  Priority  areas  for  improvement  are  management\nprocesses,  adjustment  of  courses  and  programs  to  actual  needs  and  demand,  modernization  of\nteaching  methods,  and  efficiency  and  transparency  of  mechanisms  governing  access  to  higher\neducation.\n\nAn  important  aspect  of  the  reform  has  been  the  development  of  a  new  generation  of\ntextbooks  and  teachers'  guides.  Despite  progress  achieved,  developing  new  teaching  materials\nand  increasing  the  supply  of  textbooks  in school  libraries  remain  priorities  of  education  authorities\nas there  is still  important  shortages  of textbooks  and methodology  literature.  The  Resolution  of the\nCabinet of Ministers of the  Republic  of Uzbekistan of August  16, 2001 # 341 (\"On the  Development\nof  a  New  Generation  of  Textbooks  and  Training  Literature  for  SSE\")  approves  the  schedule  of\ndeveloping  and  publishing  new  textbooks  until  the  year  2005.  Textbook  development  and\ndistribution  is the  most  labor-intensive  and  costly  activity  of  NPPT,  requiring  substantial  financing,\nexpertise,  and  time.  The  Government  will  further  efforts  to  develop  a  sustainable,  affordable  and\nefficient textbook  development  system,  in particular by promoting competition  in and  modernization\nof the  publishing  and  printing  industry,  implementing  a textbook  rental  scheme  for  basic education\n(and possibly other educationalleveJs),  and reviewing the number and volume of textbooks  required\nto effectively support the curriculum.\n\nTraining  and  retraining  of  teaching  staff  must be carried out in line with  the  new methods\nand  contents  of  education.  New  standards  and  structures  of  teacher  education  have  been\nestablished  for  basic  education\"  SSE,  and  higher  education.  The  Cabinet  of  Ministers  issued  the\nResolution #400 (\"On Measures for  Improvement of Training of Teachers for Specialized  Secondary\nand Professional Education\"),  developing  a program for training and retraining teachers  and visiting\nteachers in SSE institutions  for the  period 2002-2010. The ESOP will contribute  to reforming  current\npractices  and  methods  of  teacher  education,  more  specifically  through  the  establishment  of  a\ndistance learning capacity,  and  development  and dissemination of modern teaching  methods  at the\nbasic education  level. In an important  step, a MOPE Order issued in June 2001 ratified the structure\n(DE)  system  to  be  supported  under  the  ESOP.  New  training\nof  the  new  distance  education \nmodules and approaches will be integrated into the regular teacher training  programs  and additional\n\n2\n\n.A I JIJ7\n\n-\n\n:0'\"\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix  6,  page  3\n\nincentives  will  be  granted  to  DE  certificate  holders.  These  measures  shall  result  in  expanded\naccess of teachers, especially  those  serving  in remote areas, to further training  and  hence improved\nperformance  of teaching  staff.\n\nIn the above-described  context  of  rapid  change  and radical reform,  monitoring \n\nthe  quality\nof  education  and measuring  progress  towards  newly  set objectives is of  critical  importance.  At  all\nlevels, a dramatic reorganization  is needed to improve the functionality of education  monitoring,  and\nsome  key  steps  have  already  been  taken.  The  Education  Reform Implementation  Monitoring  Unit\n(ERIMU)  has  been  established  within  the  Social  Complex of the  Cabinet  of  Ministers;  monitoring\nin  charge  of  NPPT\nunits  and  working  groups  have  been  established \nimplementation  as well  as  in regional  governments.  School  inspection  and  supervision  systems\nwill  be strengthened  and  reoriented  towards  teacher  support. To this end, the  Government  intends\ninspectors  and  experts  of  methodical  departments  -\nto  retrain  district  administration \nand school directors, in the field of academic  supervision.\n\nin  line  ministries \n\nstaff  - including \n\nII. \n\nImproving  sector  sustain  ability  and  efficiency\n\nIn  line  with  structural  changes,  steps  were  introduced  to  rationalize  and  modernize\nfacilities \nin  the  education  sector.  At  present,  the  system  of  continuous  education  covers  6704\npreschools,  9672  basic education  schools  and  584  non-school education institutions,  47  academic\nlyceums,  787  professional  colleges  and  63  higher  educational  institutions.  In order  to  evaluate  the\nconditions  and state of educational  institutions,  and to work out recommendations  for  improvements\nof  sustainability  and  efficiency  of  the  network  of  institutions,  a  nation-wide  school  and  community\nsurvey will be carried out. This will  lead to the elaboration and phased implementation  new maps of\neducational \ninstitutions.  The  expected  optimization  of  the  network  of  schools  and  SSE\ninstitutions  should result in an increase  in average sizes of institutions and classes.\n\nIn  view  of  the  high  level  of  capital  and  recurrent  costs  involved  in  maintaining  boarding\n\ninstitutions,  the  Government  will  also  rationalize  SSE  and  higher  education  boarding \naccording  to actual and projected  demand  (i.e.\n\nfacilities\n\nTo  support  the  management  decentralization  policy  and  in  accordance  with  principles  of\nefficiency  and  equity  in  the  distribution  of  staff,  the  Government  will  review  the  current\ndeployment of education  personnel.  This  process  will  be informed by an  organizational  audit  of\nthe education administration  and an assessment  of training needs of administrative  staff.\n\nImproving \n\nthe  service  conditions  of  the  education  personnel  so  as  to  enhance  staff\nperformance  has  been  a  long-standing  priority  of  the  Government. Teachers'  salaries  (in  nominal\nterms)  were  increased  by 40  percent  in 2001 (50 percent for SSE teachers).  The  Government  now\nintends  to  augment  the  official \nin  teachers'  hourly\nremuneration \nincentive  schemes  and  career  development\nrate \nopportunities  for certain categories  of staff will accompany  reforms in the teacher  education  system.\nThe  Government will  improve  the  career  development  system alongside a transition  to  a system  of\ndifferential  remuneration  and  benefits  based  not  only  on  teachers'  qualifications  and  experience\nlevel,  but  also  on  actual  classroom  teaching  performance.  Mechanisms  for  providing  additional\nsupport to teachers assigned  in remote,  deprived,  and ecologically unsafe areas  will  be piloted  and\nassessed  under the ESOP.\n\nteaching \nterms.  Enhanced \n\nloads  with  parallel  increases \n\nin  real \n\nThe  Government  also  recognizes  the  necessity  of  improving  opportunities \n\nfor  career\ndevelopment  of  women  working \nin  the  education  sector.  Certain  measures,  taken  by  the\nGovernment  as  part  of  global  programs  (e.g.  \"Women's  Year\",  \"Healthy  Generation\",  \"Year  of\nMother and Child\", etc.)  have  helped to address  gender issues, allowing women  to  be more  heavily\n\n~\n\nc\n\n3\n\n;1/;AIil\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 6,  page  4\n\ninvolved  in  their  professional  activity.  The  Government  intends  to  encourage  the  professional\ndevelopment  of  qualified  women,  which  will  be  reflected  in  an  increased  proportion  of  women\nassuming  leadership  and management  positions throughout the education sector.\n\nIII. \n\nReforming  governance  of  education\n\nBuilding  private-public  partnerships  and  facilitating  private  initiative  in the  education  sector\nare important  areas  of education  governance. The Government  realizes that the development  of  a\nnon-government  education  sector  is  needed  to  improve  access  to  non-compulsory  educational\nlevels.  Joint  \"kindergarten-school  complexes\"  run by communities  and  non-government  preschools\nwere  recently  established.  The  Government  will  provide  the  required  legal  rights  and  support  to\ncommunities  and  non-governmental  organizations  (NGOs)  in  managing  and  funding  preschool\ninstitutions.  On  the  basis  of  studies,  the  Government  will  identify  restrictions  and  obstacles  that\nprevent  non-government  provision  of  education,  and  will  enact  legal  and  institutional  measures  to\neliminate  these  constraints.  To  encourage the active and effective  participation of the  community  in\nschool  activities,  a  School  Initiatives  Fund  (SIF)  will  be  established,  providing  select  resource-\npoor schools  with  new access to extra-budgetary funds.\n\nCost-sharing \n\nand  cost-recovery  mechanisms  must  be  designed \n\ntogether  with\ncompensatory  measures  for the  poor with a view  to strengthening  the financial  sustainability  of the\nentire  education  system. As  a firs  step, the  Government will  pilot schemes combining  user charges\nfor  boarding  services  in  SSE  and  higher  education  with  the  provision  of  targeted  support  for\nvulnerable  students.\n\nCurrent  efforts will  be  accelerated  to  modernize  management  systems,  in  particular  by\nreviewing  the  budget  preparation  and  execution  processes  (including  current  norms  for  allocating\nresources),  and  integrating  existing  information  systems  into  a  unified  educational  management\ninformation  system \ntransparent,  and  policy-relevant  data.  The\nGovernment  will test  new  budgeting techniques  in the education  sector according to the concept  of\nprogram  budgets  that will be applied in pilot institutions and regions.\n\n(EM IS)  providing \n\nreliable, \n\nfor the poor\n\nIV.\n\nProviding protection\nThe  Government  recognizes  the  need to  mitigate financial  loads on the  poor  by introducing\nmechanisms  of  partial compensation  for the costs of education.  Rising  direct  costs  of  education,\nespecially  in relation  with  textbook  expenses,  has become an important  concern.  Under  Resolution\n33 of the  Cabinet  of Ministers  of the  Republic of Uzbekistan of January 25, 2002 (\"On Measures  for\nImplementation  of  Targeted  Programs to  Support  Socially Vulnerable  Populations  for  2002-2003\"),\nschool  pupils  from  low-income  families  will  be  provided  with  winter  clothes  and  textbooks  using\nstate  and  local  budgets.  This  measure,  as  well  as  other  ones  enacted  in  the  past  years,\ncomplements  the social protection system managed by the Mahalia community organizations\n\nTo  promote  an  equitable  access  to  post-basic  education  levels,  further  improvement  of\nmechanisms  for  direct  support  of  pupils  that  cannot  bear  expenses  associated  with  education  is\nrequired.  In SSE,  the  Government  will  develop  and  implement  a  mechanism  for  material  support\nfrom  poor  families  with  good  academic  achievement.  The  Government  will  also\nto  students \nsetting  strict\nfurther  rationalize  expenses \ntargeting  criteria  to  allocate  such  funds  to  students  from  poor  families.  The  new  student  loan\nscheme  recently  established  under Decree 318 of July 2001 will also  be part of this  effort to ensure\nequal access  to higher education.\n\nfor  higher  education  grants  and  scholarships. \n\n-\n\n\"'\n\n.c\n\n~~~\n\n4\n\nIII 1/1\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix  6,  page  5\n\nThere  are  also  imbalances  in the  provision  and  quality  of  basic  education  that  need  to  be\naddressed.  These  are  primarily  linked  to  unequal  access  to  resources  by  educational  institutions\nand  communities.  In  an  attempt  to  correct  these  imbalances,  the  Government  will  devise  new\nfunding  mechanisms'  providing  additional  support from the republican budget to districts  where  per\ncapita expenditure  is below  the  national  average.  In an effort to improve teaching  conditions  in rural\nremote  areas,  the  Government  will  implement  a  school rehabilitation  program  targeting  500  of  the\nmost  deprived  schools  of  the  country.  These  measures  will  supplement  the  support  to  equity-\nenhancing schoof-level initiatives  under the SIF.\n\nConclusion\n\nReforms in the  education  sector  have  received priority attention from  the  Government  of the\nRepublic  of  Uzbekistan.  A  considerable  budget  effort  has  been  made  to  implement  NPPT  since\n1997  and  the  Government \nfully  acknowledges  the  scale  of  new  costs  associated  with  the\nimplementation  of  the  ESOP.  By  supporting  the  implementation  of  the  new  education  policy\ninitiatives outlined above,  the  ESOP is expected  to have a lasting impact on management  practices,\nbudget allocations,  and  overall  efficiency  of the  education system. The  ESOP will  play an  important\nrole  in  furthering  the  sector  reform  process,  thereby  contributing  to  the  long-term  national\ndevelopment  of Uzbekistan.  The financial  and technical support of the Asian  Development  Bank will\nbe  of  strategic  importance  to  implement  this  important  national  Program  and  the  Republic  of\nUzbekistan  looks  forward \nthe  long-term  partnership  established  with  your\ninstitution.\n\nto  strengthening \n\nYours sincerely\n\na/At;\nK~~:/\n\nDeputy Prime Minister\n\n--\n\n~\n\n;;\n\n-\n\n5\n\n\fPOLICY MATRIX \n\nPolicy Areas \n\nPolicy Measures / \nActions \n\nMonitoring Arrangements / \nImplementation Modality \n \n\nTime Frame \n\nIntegration \nwith Other \nADB Projects \n\nResponsible \nAgencies \n\n \nOBJECTIVE 1: MODERNIZE STRUCTURE, CONTENTS AND PROCESSES OF EDUCATION \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1 Streamlining \nof the education \nstructure \n\n1.1.1 Develop a \nstrategic framework for \nreforming higher \neducation. \n \n\n1.1.2 Review SSE \nexpansion modalities, \nspecialties; and \nstructures.  \n\n1.2 Curriculum \nreview and \neducation quality \nmonitoring \n\n1.2.1 Strengthen core \ncompetencies in the \nbasic education \ncurriculum. \n \n\n1.2.2 Strengthen school \nsupervision and \nacademic guidance. \n\n1.1.1.1 State standards for higher education approved \n \n \n1.1.1.2 Strategic directions for higher education reform \ndefined; policy statement submitted to ADB \n \n1.1.2.1 State standards for SSE approved  \n \n \n1.1.2.2 Proposals for improving SSE flexibility and \nefficiency submitted to ADB  \n \n1.1.2.3 Tracer study of SSE graduates submitted to \nADB \n \n1.1.2.4 SSE expansion plans revised annually and \nsubmitted to ADB, providing the list of present and \nplanned institutions broken down by specialties and \nregion  \n \n \n1.2.3.1 Monitoring of Learning Achievements study \nsubmitted to ADB together with curriculum evaluation \nstudies \n \n1.2.3.2 Proposal for adjusting the curricular load and \ntextbook titles in basic education submitted to ADB \n \n1.2.4.1 Workplans of the 15 regional teacher training \ninstitutes submitted to ADB showing training programs \nfor school directors and district staff \n \n1.2.4.2 Management courses for school principals and \ndistrict administrators accredited and integrated into the \nformal in-service training system; appropriate MOPE \nresolution submitted to ADB \n \n\nCOM \nMOHSSE \n\nTA 3399 \nLoan 1737-\nUZB \n\nCOM \nMOHSSE \nMOMES \n \n\nDecree 343 issued in August \n2001 \n \nDecember 2003 \n \n\n \n\nDecree 400 issued in \nOctober 2000 \n \nDecember 2002 \n \n \nJune 2003 and June 2004 \n \n \nDecree 338 issued in August \n2001.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE SCHOOL INITIATIVES FUND \n\n \n\n \nObjectives  \n\n\u2022  To  improve  the  quality  of  education  and  the  learning  environment  in  disadvantaged \n\nareas through the provision of block grants to schools \n\n\u2022  To facilitate the process of decentralization of education management and to encourage \n\ncommunity participation in education \n\n\u2022  About 1,000 beneficiary schools by the end of the Project \n\n \nRationale and legal basis \n\n\u2022  The School Initiatives Fund (SIF) mechanism will facilitate the effective implementation \nof  the  new  decree  on  the  financing  of  education  institutions,  which  allows  schools  to \nestablish  school  boards  and  confers  schools  with  autonomy  in  managing  extra-\nbudgetary resources.  \n\n\u2022  School boards will identify their own priorities and needs, and make decisions on the use \nof extra-budgetary resources generated by the school (including SIF grants received). \n\n \nSchool eligibility criteria \n\n\u2022  Only  schools  ranked  in  the  last  quintile  of  their  region  (oblast)  in  terms  of  educational \nachievements (according to the monitoring system maintained by the oblast department \nof education) are eligible to apply for block grants under the SIF. \n\n\u2022  Eligible schools should also demonstrate favorable local conditions\u2013including openness \nof  local  authorities  and  interaction  between  school  leaders  and  communities\u2013as \nassessed by the SIF regional facilitators. \n\n \nScope of SIF proposals \n\n \n\n\u2022  Flexibility in the scope of the proposals should be ensured so as to cover a diversity of \nneeds. The amount of individual grants may vary between the equivalent of $1,000 and \n$3,000.  \n\nProposals could include\u2014inter alia\u2014the following items: (i) instructional materials (such \nas textbooks, teacher guides, maps, dictionaries, supplementary reading materials, and \nscience  kits,  (ii)  consumable  materials  (such  as  notebooks,  exercise  books,  paper, \nchalk,  pens,  and  supplies  for  practical  subjects),  (iii)  basic  furniture  (such  as \nblackboards,  simple  tools  for  practical  subjects,  basic  sports  equipment,  tables,  and \nchairs), (iv) limited maintenance and repair of equipment, (v) direct non-cash support for \npupils  from  poor  and  vulnerable  families  (such  as  clothes,  meals,  and  medicines),  and \n(vi) support for teacher training activities (such as expenses for attendance at in-service \ntraining). Excluded from the scope of the SIF are: civil works, equipment, honoraria and \nother allowances for staff, stipends and other allowances for students. \n \n\nCriteria for assessing SIF proposals \n\nImpact on the teaching-learning process  \nImpact on school attendance, especially of disadvantaged pupils \n\n\u2022  Adherence to a standard format, including a budget and financing plan \n\u2022 \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Level of involvement and participation of the community \n \n \n \n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 17, page 2 \n\nProcedure for processing SIF proposals \n\n\u2022 \n\nIdentification of potential beneficiary school by the SIF facilitator in coordination with \nMinistry  of  Public  Education  (MOPE)  and  mahalla  authorities  and  according  to  the \neligibility criteria \n\n\u2022  Preparation  of  SIF  proposals  by  the  school  boards  with  possible  assistance  of  the \nSIF  facilitator  to  ensure  quality  and  relevance  of  proposals,  as  well  as  community \nparticipation  \n\n\u2022  Submission  of  the  SIF  proposals  to  a  regional  screening  committee  (composed  of \nrepresentatives of the regional MOPE and mahalla authorities) to ensure compliance \nwith school eligibility, scope, and review criteria  \n\n\u2022  Review of the proposal on a quarterly basis by the regional screening committee \n\u2022  Submission  of  the  SIF  applications  to  the  Project  Implementation  Unit  (PIU)  on  a \n\nquarterly basis for final review and processing \n\n\u2022  Allocation of the SIF as block grants provided to schools \n\u2022 \n\u2022  Monitoring and evaluation of the SIF project \n\nImplementation of the SIF project by the community and the school  \n\n \nTechnical support and coordination \n\n\u2022  One  SIF  facilitator  will  be  appointed  in  each  region,  based  in  the  regional  mahalla \nfund office.

Different  scenarios  or  sets  of  assumptions  on  the  values  of  key  parameters \nwere tested and discussed with the Inter-Agency Steering Committee.  \n \n2. \nOverall, the implementation of the principal policy measures will result in the addition of \nnew  costs  totaling  $62.5  million  during  the  program  period  and  roughly  $230  million  in  2006-\n2015. The benefits under the form of cost savings and earnings are estimated at a total of $31.9 \nmillion during the program period and roughly $393 million in 2006-2015. In annual terms, the \nnet  impact  during  the  whole  period  2002-2015  is  equivalent  to  $9.5  million  saved  per  year  (a \nfigure  to  be  compared  with  the  2001  recurrent  education  budget,  which  was  on  the  order  of \n$450 million).  \n \n3. \nThe  budget  impact  of  the  eight  individual  policy  measures  is  provided  in  Table  1.  The \ncosts  of  other  measures  of  the  policy  matrix,  and  those  of  surveys  and  policy  consultations, \nhave not been estimated. Their inclusion would raise the total cost of the ESDP by at least $10 \nmillion during the program period. While the program costs can be considered as rather firm and \nreal,  some  benefits  are  contingent  upon  effective  and  timely  action  by  the  Government \nregarding  (i)  closing/merging  of  schools  and  boarding  facilities,  (ii)  adoption  of  multigrade \nclasses,  (iii)  reduction  in  the  number  of  budget  students,  and  (iv)  implementation  of  cost-\nrecovery schemes. Slippage of benefits beyond the program period is thus a risk. Beyond the \nprogram period, it has been assumed that measures introduced on a pilot scale\u2013allowances for \npoor  Senior  Secondary  Education  (SSE)  students  and  cost-recovery  on  boarding\u2013will  be \nadopted  and  extended  nationwide.  A  large  portion  of  benefits  depend  upon  the  pursuit  of \npolicies adopted by the Government during the program period.  \n\nTable 1: Budget Impact of the Principal Policy Measures  \n\n \nPolicy Measure \n \n\nEstimated Budget Impact \nduring the Program Period \n(2002-2005) \n\nEstimated Budget Impact \nafter the Program Period \n(2006-2015) \n\nCosts \n\nBenefits\n\nBenefits\n\nin  SSE  and  Higher \n\nfor  boarding \n\nAdministrative staff redeployment plan \nRationalization of the school network  \nAdjustment of boarding facilities in SSEs \nCost  recovery \nEducation (HE) \nImprovement of teachers\u2019 service conditions \nBudget transfers to poor regions \nIntroduction of SSE student allowances for the poor  \nTargeting  of  scholarships  and  stipends \neducation \n \n                              TOTAL \nSSE = Senior Secondary Education. \n \n \n\nin  higher \n\n5,410\n7,678\n0\n0\n\n17,596\n27,210\n4,620\n0\n\n2,361\n12,832\n2,520\n7,124\n\n0\n0\n0\n7,095\n\n62,516\n\n31,934\n\nCosts \n \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n82,533 \n81,632 \n66,000 \n0 \n\n \n230,166 \n\n \n\n \n\n29,520\n155,345\n50,400\n101,783\n\n0\n0\n0\n56,765\n\n393,815\n\n \n\n \n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 18, page 2  \n\nWith  the  Program,  efficiency  of  education  spending  will  be  improved  through  two \n4. \nprincipal mechanisms: Fewer staff will be necessary to operate the system as a result of revised \nnorms  (class  size,  pupil:teacher  ratios,  teaching  load)  and  expansion  of  multigrade  teaching; \nand operating costs per institution (heating, electricity, maintenance, repair, etc.) will decrease \nwith  a  concomitant  increase  in  the  number  of  pupils  per  school,  and  the  improved  occupancy \nrate of boarding facilities in SSE institutions.  \n \n5. \nThe  Program  will  also  encourage  a  pro-poor  restructuring  of  education  budgets  in \nseveral  ways.  Scholarships  and  stipends,  which  currently  tend  to  benefit  mostly  those  affluent \nparts  of  society  that  have  access  to  higher  education,  will  be  better  targeted  towards  needy \nstudents.  Public  resources  will  better  reach  the  poorest  areas  and  schools.  Teacher  incentive \nmechanisms will benefit principally teachers serving in rural poor areas.  \n \n6. \nThe  distribution  of  total  costs  by  category  indicates  that  the  share  allotted  for \ncompensation,  retraining,  and  relocation  cost  of  redundant  or  redeployed  staff  is  rather  small \n(accounting for less than 5% of total). Most downsizing of education administration already took \nplace in 1999-2001, and the remaining adjustment to be carried out during the program period \nwill  be  achieved  essentially  through  natural  attrition  (i.e.,  staff  attaining  normal  retirement  age \nand teachers leaving service voluntarily). In contrast, the analysis reveals the large share of pro-\npoor spending under the form of (i) transfers from the Republican budget to local budgets aimed \nat reducing regional disparities in per pupil spending across regions (37%), and (ii) allowances \nand  other  schemes  in  favor  disadvantaged  students  in  SSE  (24%).  The  introduction  of  new \npromotion  schemes  and  other  incentives  aimed  at  enhancing  staff  motivation  accounts  for  an \nimportant share of total costs (34%). \n \n7. \nThe  distribution  of  benefits  by  category  shows  that  payroll  reductions,  occurring  as  a \nresult of new cuts in staffing levels, will account for the largest portion of benefits (42%) as their \neffect  will  last  throughout  the  period  under  consideration.  Cost  recovery  mechanisms,  in  the \nform  of  payments  for  boarding  services  in  SSE  and  higher  education,  will  generate  important \nresources if expanded nationwide after the program period (accounting for roughly 25% of total \nbenefits). Benefits will also take the form of (i) reductions in school operating costs following the \nimplementation of a new school map and the adjustments of boarding facilities at the SSE level \n(18%), and (ii) savings on stipends and scholarships with the improved targeting of beneficiaries \nof state support (15%).  \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe  ESDP  is  expected  to  have  a  major  impact  on  educational  quality  by  positively \naffecting  teacher  characteristics  (i.e.,  qualifications  and  motivation)  and  increasing  the  level  of \ninputs  critical  to  quality  improvement.  Resulting  improvements  in  teacher  performance  and \nteaching  processes  will  be  reflected  in  higher  student  achievement.  The  revision  of  promotion \nsystems (allowing performance-based remuneration) and the introduction of special allowances \nfor  certain  categories  of  teachers  are  expected  to  benefit  a  total  of  250,000  teachers  (roughly \n40% of all teachers). Staff motivation will be enhanced through (i) new promotion systems better \nlinking  remuneration  with  career  development  and  training,  (ii)  additional  incentives  for  staff \nserving in disadvantaged areas, (iii) allowances for multigrade teachers, and (iv) allowances for \nteachers  receiving  Distance  Education  (DE)  certificates.  Teacher  qualifications  and  class \nmanagement ability will be positively affected  through teacher training  programs in the  areas \nof    multigrade  teaching,  new  teaching  methods,  and  subject  content.  Teacher  access  to \ncontinuous learning will be enhanced through the establishment of the DE system. A majority of \nbeneficiaries will be schoolteachers serving in rural areas. \n\nOther Benefits of the Program  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f75\n\nAppendix 18, page 3  \n\nEfficiency of the In-Service Teacher Training (INSET) System1  \n\n \n9. \nThe teaching environment (i.e., conditions of facilities and the availability of instructional \nequipment  and  materials)  will  be  improved  through  (i)  supplementary  budget  transfers  to  poor \ndistricts,   (ii) rehabilitation of buildings and sanitation facilities in poor schools together with the \nprovision  of  basic  instructional  equipment  (500  schools),  and  (iii)  block  grants  to  support \ncommunity  initiatives  under  the  School  Initiatives  Fund  (SIF)  (1,000  schools).  To  varying \ndegrees, ESDP initiatives aimed at improving educational quality will benefit an estimated 80% \nof all schools in the country, representing over 4 million pupils. Schools located in the poorest \nareas will reap most of the benefits. \n \n10. \nTo  support  the  administrative  decentralization  process,  an  estimated  total  of  about \n34,000  administrative  staff  will  undergo  formal  training,  allowing  them  to  take  up  their  new \nassignments  in  the  administrative  apparatus.  Of  these,  about  10,000  school  directors  and \ndistrict  officers  will  be  retrained  by  the  Project.  The  Project  will  also  conduct  a  sensitization \ncampaign  targeted  towards  mahalla  leaders,  and  assist  communities  in  establishing  school \nboards. The reform management capacity will be improved through participatory policy studies, \nstudy  visits  and  external  training  of  key  staff,  and  the  establishment  of  ESDP  monitoring \nsystems. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nAt  present,  the  INSET  capacity  is  largely  unutilized  due  to  low  participation  rates  and \ninflexible organization.2 The introduction of DE modalities will substantially improve the internal \nefficiency  of  the  system.  Overall,  the  Project  will  expand  the  total  INSET  capacity  by  roughly \n10%  and  bring  an  important  shift  towards  DE,  which  will  account  for  about  34%  of  the  total \ntraining capacity. Unit costs (expressed in dollars per person per week of training) will decrease \nin  the  formal  INSET  system,  principally  as  a  result  of  the  more  intensive  utilization  of  staff \nresources.3 The flexibility inherent in DE will permit a response to teacher demand for training at \nmuch lower cost. The analysis suggests that training can be provided through DE at about 60%  \nof the cost of the formal system. This is essentially explained by the fact that DE consumes far \nfewer staff resources than conventional training, as it relies largely on home study by the learner \n(the Project assumes that a course of a duration of 90 hours would require only 12-16 hours of \ncontact session, but that these have lower learner:instructor ratios compared with conventional \ntraining programs). \n \n12. \nThe  DE  system  consists  of  a  network  of  85  centers,  including  70  learning  resource \ncenters, 14 regional coordinating units, and a development center. The annual recurrent costs \nof  a  DE  center  have  been  estimated  at  the  equivalent  of  $16,500,  consisting  primarily  of  staff \ncosts,  communications,  office  supplies  and  materials,  maintenance  of  equipment,  and  travel. \nThe  DE units are conceived  to  provide  roughly 360 person-months of training through contact  \n \n\n                                                           \n1  This  section  provides  a  cost-effectiveness  analysis  of  the  new  DE  system  supported  under  component  2  of  the \n\nProject and representing roughly 60% of its total base costs.  \n\n2  A  survey  carried  out  during  project  preparation  showed  that  the  14  regional  in-service  teacher  training  institutes \n(RITTIs) delivered the equivalent of 195,449 person-weeks of training compared with a stated capacity of 306,720. \n3  Project preparatory work suggested substantial overstaffing of the in-service teacher training system. DE positions \nare expected to be filled by reassignments of staff of the 14 regional in-service teacher training institutes (RITTIs) \nto the new learning resource centers (based in schools) and the regional coordinating units (based in the RITTIs). \nOf  1184  positions  (687  teaching  and  497  nonteaching)  of  the  INSET,  328  (226  professional  /  technical  and  102 \nclerical) will be transferred to DE. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 18, page 4  \n\nsessions  between  learners  and  instructors.4  The  three  trial  distance  education  courses \ndeveloped under the Project are predicted to absorb about 75% of this capacity. At the end of \nthe Project, the new distance education units will account for about 30% of all in-service training \nprovided.  \n \n13. \nIn parallel, the demand for training in the formal or traditional INSET system will increase \nin  conjunction  with  two  main  factors:  (i)  the  improved  quality  of  programs  delivered \n(modernization  of  equipment  of  the  central  in-service  teacher  training  institutes  (CITTI)  and \nregional  in-service  teacher  training  institutes  (RITTIs)  and  better  trained  staff),  and  (ii)  the \nestablishment  of  new  promotion  mechanisms  linking  salaries  with  training.  It  is  estimated  that \nthis  additional  teacher  demand  for  formal  INSET  would  translate  into  a  10%  increase  in \nattendance  of  training  courses  (with  a  parallel  increase  in  operating  costs).  As  a  result,  the \nformal  system  is  expected  to  operate  at  full  capacity  by  the  end  of  the  project;  further \nestablishment of DE facilities may be considered as a low cost expansion of the system. \n \n14. \n\nTable 2 summarizes the main outcomes of the project for the INSET system. \n\n \nTable 2: Impact of the Project on the Inset System \n\nItem \n\n \n\nTraining capacity (person-weeks) \nActual output (person-weeks) \nCapacity utilization \nUnit cost ($ per person-week) \nTotal recurrent cost ($\u2018000) \n \n \n\nCurrent Situation\n\nFormal  \nIn-Service \n323,520\n205,070\n63%\n36\n7,314\n\nAfter the Project \n \nDistance \nEducation \n122,400 \n91,800 \n75% \n15 \n1,407 \n\nTotal \n\n  356,296\n  317,377\n89%\n \n \n25\n8,028\n \n\nFormal  \nIn-Service \n233,896\n225,577\n96%\n29\n6,621\n\n                                                           \n4 This takes into account the fact that DE facilities and equipment will also be used for the normal teaching operations \nof  the  schools  where  LRCs  will  be  based  as  well  as  other  schools  in  the  vicinity.  It  is  assumed  that  a  standard \nMinistry  of  Public  Education  (MOPE)  course  of  a  duration  of  three  weeks  would  require  20  hours  of  contact \nsessions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", "ADB \nAL \nBETD \nCIESD \nCOM \nCSSE \nDC \nDE \nERIMU \nESDP \nFP \nFSU \nGDP \nIASC \nIDG \nIMF \nINSET \nIP \nLIBOR \nLRC \nMOF \nMOHSSE \nMOL \nMOMES \nMOPE \nNBU \nNPPT \nPC \nPIU \nRCU \nRITTI \nSIF \nSSE \nSY \nTA \nTACIS \nTEMPUS \nTVE \n \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of  23 October 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \nSUM1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "sum (SUM) \n$0.00120 \nSUM 831 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "inter-agency steering committee \ninternational development goal \nInternational Monetary Fund \nIn-Service Teachers\u2019 Training \ninstitute of pedagogy \n", "-  Asian Development Bank \n-  academic lyceum  \n-  Basic Education Textbook Development Project \n-  Central Institute for Education Staff Development \n-  Cabinet of Ministers \n-  Center for Senior Secondary Education \n-  development center \n-  distance education \n-  Education Reform Implementation Unit \n-  Education Sector Development Program \nfaculty of pedagogy \n- \n- \nformer Soviet Union \n-  gross domestic product \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n-  London Inter-Bank Offered Rate \n- \n-  Ministry of Finance \n-  Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education \n-  Ministry of Labor \n-  Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics \n-  Ministry of Public Education \n-  National Bank for Foreign Economic Activity of Uzbekistan \n-  National Program for Personnel Training \n-  professional college \n-  project implementation unit \n-  Regional Coordinating Unit \n- \n- \n- \n- \n- \n-  European Union Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States \n-  European Union Trans-European Mobility Programme for University Studies \n- \n", "regional in-service teacher training institute \nschool initiatives fund \nsenior secondary education  \nschool year \ntechnical assistance \n", "technical and vocational education \n", "learning resource center \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n", "The year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December. \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \nThe school year (SY) runs from September to June.
