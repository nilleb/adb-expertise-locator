It  builds  on  and  complements  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  Upper  Secondary \nEducation Sector Development Program (USESDP 1).1 The Second Upper Secondary Education \nSector Development Program (USESDP 2) will (i) improve teacher quality and boost the quality \nand labor market relevance of USE; and (ii) strengthen institutional capacity for USE planning, \nmanagement, and delivery. While the policy reforms will apply nationwide, the project activities \nwill cover only selected areas. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nADB\u2019s  sequenced  approach  to  reform.  ADB  has  supported  education  and  skills \ndevelopment in Cambodia since 2001 through sector development programs, investment loans, \ntechnical  assistance  grants,  policy  and  advisory  support,  and  knowledge  products  (figure). 2 \nADB\u2019s  USE  engagement  builds  upon  critical  lessons  from  its  extensive  engagement  in  the \neducation sector. This highlights the importance of strategically sequencing medium- to long-term \nsupport to build the foundation for the reforms, allow these to take root, and show results. \n \n\nADB\u2019s Engagement in Cambodia\u2019s Education Sector \n\n \n\n2016\u20132021  \nUpper \nSecondary \nESDP \n\n2018\u20132023  \nProposed \nSecond Upper \nSecondary \nESDP \n\n2015\u20132020 \nTVET Sector \nDevelopment \nProgram \n\n2019\u20132024 \nProposed Skills for \nCompetitiveness \nProject \n\n2001\u20132005 \nESDP \n\n2012\u20132018 \nThird ESDP \n\n2008\u20132014 \nEnhancing \nEducation \nQuality \nProject \n\n2008\u20132015 \nStrengthening \nTVET Project \n\n2004\u20132008 \nSecond ESDP \n\nSupport for MOEYS \n\nSupport for MOEYS and MLVT \nSupport for MLVT \n\n  \n\n \n \n \n\n \nESDP = Education Sector Development Program; MLVT = Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training; MOEYS = Ministry \nof Education, Youth and Sport; TVET = technical and vocational education and training. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n4. \nTransition from first to second phase of support. This second program builds on the \nfirst phase of targeted ADB assistance to USE. The first program supports government efforts to \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. Cambodia: Upper Secondary Education Sector Development Program. \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Education (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\novercome key  constraints  to  increasing  access to  USE  through  policy  reforms  and  investment \nactivities.  USESDP  1  financially  supports  poor  USE  students  through  scholarships;  provides \nhardship allowance and teacher housing for USE teachers in remote and disadvantaged areas; \nand constructs upper secondary schools (USSs) in seven disadvantaged provinces, of which five \nhave a significant indigenous peoples\u2019 population. USESDP 1 also introduced reforms to improve \nUSE  quality,  including  developing  a  curriculum  framework;  strengthening  science,  technology, \nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) education; and issuing a comprehensive teacher policy. \nFollowing these policy reforms and the progress of USESDP 1, this second phase focuses on \nremoving the remaining constraints and deepening quality, relevance, and management capacity \nreforms. USESDP 2 therefore adopts a holistic approach, establishing required inputs, policies, \nand systems (i.e., well-equipped schools, highly qualified teachers, curriculum and assessment \nreforms,  and  strong  school  leadership  and  support)  before  nationwide  expansion  to  allow  for \nstronger  and measurable  learning  outcomes  in the future. The  overall  program  aligns  with  the \nsecond strategic pillar of the ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia.3 \n \n5. \nThe  development  problem.  Cambodia\u2019s  economic  growth  in  2017  remained  strong, \nestimated at 7.0% and fueled by increases in foreign direct investment and export diversification.4 \nHowever,  sustaining  high  growth  requires  economic  diversification  and  higher  value-added \nproduction. New industries require a skilled workforce for a modern and industrialized economy. \nEconomic integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations adds a sense of urgency to \nintensify industry-linked skills development for a nationally and regionally competitive workforce. \nUSE plays a crucial role in equipping youth with the skills, competencies, and knowledge to benefit \nfrom and contribute to Cambodia\u2019s socioeconomic development. Persistent performance gaps in \nUSE, however, constrain the education sector and the economy\u2019s medium-term growth. \n \n6. \nCambodia\u2019s upper secondary education system. USE in Cambodia comprises the last \n3 years of general secondary education (grades 10\u201312) and includes both academic and technical \ntracks. In school year 2016\u20132017, only one of four upper secondary-aged youths were enrolled \nin USE.5 The 21% national completion rate was worse in rural areas, where the completion rate \nwas at a very low 15%.6 The 18% national dropout rate was higher in ethnic minority communities \nas well, and boys dropped out at a rate almost 3 percentage points higher than the girls\u2019 17% \ndropout rate.7 The grade 12 passing rate was only 62%.8 Education and economic opportunities \nfor the rural poor and those in remote areas, where indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities are \npredominant,  remain  constrained.  Given  low  enrollment  and  completion  rates  among  ethnic \nminority  USE  students,  the  requirement  to  complete  grade  12  for  the  new  bachelor\u2019s  degree \nteacher qualification is an additional barrier. A challenge for the secondary education system is \nto produce skilled graduates in science who can also critically analyze, and problem solve. \n \n7. \nBinding constraints. The government has identified the following binding constraints: (i) \nlow access to USE; (ii) limited USE quality and labor market relevance; and (iii) weak capacity to \nplan, manage, and deliver USE. \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2014.

Phnom Penh. \n \n\n\fLow access to upper secondary education. The high opportunity cost of schooling for \n8. \npoor students remains a major constraint to USE enrollment and completion. Corrective measures \nare already underway. Since 2016, the government has been addressing access issues through \npolicy  reforms  and  budget  commitments.  USESDP  1  has  provided  complementary  support \nthrough key policy reforms and a 5-year investment project that runs until 2021.9 \n \n9. \nLack of qualified teachers. A shortage in qualified teachers\u2014including specialized USE \nsubject teachers\u2014impedes improvements in USE outcomes. Despite notable preservice teacher \ntraining improvements, gaps persist in USE teachers\u2019 content mastery and knowledge of effective \npedagogy to improve student learning. The teaching profession attracts few top graduates, which \npartly explains the lack of qualified teachers and particularly disadvantages USSs. Teachers and \nteacher  educators  have  limited  opportunities  to  upgrade  their  pedagogical  content  knowledge. \nTeacher deployment is a challenge and has resulted in few qualified teachers, especially women, \nin disadvantaged areas. The proportion of women teachers in USE remains low at 39% overall, \nwith 43% in urban areas, 37% in rural areas, and 31% in secondary resource schools.10 Even \nfewer  women  teach  physics,  mathematics,  and  information  and  communication  technology \n(ICT).11 Few trained ethnic minority teachers are deployed to their home communities. USESDP \n1 supported a comprehensive teacher policy that directed reforms in teacher recruitment, training, \nand  development.  However,  key  reforms  on  continuous  professional  development  and  a  well-\ndefined teacher career pathway system that links professional development and experience to \npromotion have yet to be developed and implemented. \n \n10. \nLow quality and relevance of standards, curriculum, and assessment. Teaching and \nlearning specialized USE subjects require minimum service standards for basic inputs such as \nlaboratories,  workshops,  and  equipment.  Lacking  these  standards  exacerbates  inequities  in \nteaching and learning quality across Cambodia\u2019s USSs. Limited innovative teaching strategies, \npoor organization of resources, and infrequent review and alignment of curriculum content to the \nskills  needs  of  students  and  the  labor  market  hamper  the  full  implementation  of  the  revised \ncurriculum  supported  under  USESDP  1.  The  absence  of  a  learner  assessment  framework  to \nmeasure student learning, identify least learned skills, and analyze underlying factors affecting \npoor learning outcomes precludes improvements in content and pedagogy. The USE system has \nno strong links to private sector partners that could improve labor market relevance. Additionally, \nUSE students have limited access to opportunities for experiential learning, career guidance, and \nadditional learning resources. The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS) recognizes \nthe  need  to  use  ICT  in  teaching  and  learning,  but  the  government  has  yet  to  prepare  a  clear \nimplementation plan to inform related investment and training. \n \n11.  Weak  capacity  to  plan,  manage,  and  deliver  services.  USS  directors  have  weak \ncapacity to provide instructional support to teachers and regularly assess and give feedback on \ntheir performance, impeding student learning and achievement potential. USS directors\u2019 limited \nengagement  with  stakeholders  hampers  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  school \nimprovement plans, and limited monitoring of plan implementation precludes the efficient use and \nallocation of resources. Inadequate USE budgets lead to a lack of critical resources for upgrading \nstudents\u2019  proficiency  in  specialized  USE  subjects.  Schools  generally  have  limited  capacity  to \n\n                                                \n9  USESDP 1 includes construction of additional upper secondary schools in seven disadvantaged provinces. \n10 Secondary resource schools are secondary schools that have a secondary resource center equipped with science \nlaboratories, computer laboratories, a library, meeting rooms, and other facilities. ADB\u2019s previous education programs \nestablished 36 secondary resource schools. \n\n11 MoEYS Education Management Information System data for school year 2016\u20132017 for grades 10\u201312 is included \n\nin the Social and Poverty Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\neffectively mainstream gender in education as well. A clear human resource development plan \nthat  improves  secondary  school  teachers\u2019  qualifications  can  improve  resource  allocation  and \nmanagement accountability. \n \nValue added by  ADB assistance. ADB has directly supported developing Cambodia\u2019s \n12. \nUSE program and its reforms. Through technical assistance to the MoEYS, ADB helped identify \npolicy  and  operational  gaps  and  formulated  policies  to  improve  USE  quality  and  relevance. 12 \nThese  policies  covered  ICT  in  education,  teachers\u2019  professional  development  and  career \npathways,  and  minimum  service  standards  for  quality  assurance.  ADB  has  also  provided \nanalytical  and  advisory  inputs  on  key  policy  reforms,  including  curriculum  and  assessment, \nschool-based  management,  expansion  of  high-quality  secondary  schools,  and  resource \nallocation. These were achieved through ADB\u2019s extensive engagement in its ongoing education \nprograms  (footnote  2)  and  policy  dialogue  on  medium-term  directions  and  strategies  with  the \ngovernment through the Education Sector Working Group. \n \n13. \nSector  development  program.  Lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  first  three  education  sector \ndevelopment  programs  in  Cambodia  highlight  the  effectiveness  of  combining  a  policy-based \nprogram with an investment component for a comprehensive and integrated response to sector \nissues,  gaps,  and  priorities. 13 The  policy  component  will  set  the  national  policy  framework  to \nunderpin  the  implementation  of  key  reforms  to  improve  teacher  quality,  expand  high-quality \nsecondary  schools,  and  improve  sector  management.  The  investment  component  will  support \nconcrete  interventions  to  implement  these  policy  reforms,  many  of  which  entail  substantial \nfinancial  costs.  The  government  was  extensively  engaged  in  identifying  policy  reforms  and \ninvestments for USESDP 2. It is also committed to include expenditure related to the reforms in \nfuture budgets to sustain the impact of the reforms beyond the program\u2019s completion. \n \nB. \n \nThe  program  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  high-quality  human  resources \n14. \ndeveloped. 14 The  program  will  have  the  following  outcome:  effectiveness  of  the  USE  system \nimproved.15 \n \nC. \n \n15. \nOutput  1:  Quality  of  teachers  in  upper  secondary  schools  improved.  This  policy-\nbased loan output operationalized the Teacher Policy Action Plan to improve the competency and \nupgrade the status of teachers. The government approved the establishment of teacher education \ncolleges in Phnom Penh and Battambang province, to increase access to quality teacher training. \nThe  MoEYS  strengthened  the  continuous  professional  development  of  teachers  to  improve \ncontent  knowledge  and  teaching  methodologies.  The  MoEYS  approved  the  Framework  on \nTeacher Career Pathways to incentivize qualified individuals into the teaching profession, and link \nteachers\u2019 career progression to professional development to retain quality teachers. Underpinned \nby the Cambodian Qualifications Framework,16 the MoEYS approved the recognition of teachers\u2019 \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 2016.

The project will assess the \nNIE\u2019s  organization  structure,  governance,  leadership,  human  resources  staffing,  and  fiduciary \ncapacity.  It  will  upgrade  classrooms  and  science  laboratories  and  will  build  a  new  library  to \nprofessional standards. The library will have new equipment, teaching and learning resources, \nand separate water and sanitation facilities for women and men. The project will revise preservice \nand in-service curriculum, instruction, and assessment for USE teachers, school directors, and \ninspectors.  It  will  conduct  in-service  training  for  STEM  and  USE  teachers  from  50  secondary \nresource schools and 81 upper secondary network schools.17 This training will cover the revised \ncurriculum, content knowledge, instruction, and assessment; and will include culturally inclusive \nand gender-responsive STEM  teaching  and  learning methods. The  program  will  provide  equal \nopportunity scholarships for NIE lecturers for advanced education programs. NIE librarians will \nreceive training on creating an effective print and e-library environment for students and teachers \nto  support  learning.  The  project  will  also  establish  a  sex-disaggregated  teachers\u2019  professional \ndevelopment database to improve planning. \n \n17. \nOutput  2:  Quality  and  labor  market  relevance  of  upper  secondary  education \nimproved. This output of the policy-based loan established implementation arrangements, review \nand  monitoring  structures,  and  standards  to  review  and  improve  USE  outcomes.  The  MoEYS \nimplemented  the  Curriculum  Framework  for  General  and  Technical  Education.  MoEYS \nestablished  a  kindergarten  to  grade  12  student  learning  assessment  framework  to  guide  the \nmeasurement  of  learning  and  inform  improvements  to  the  teaching  and  learning  process. \nMinimum  service  standards  were  set  for  school  infrastructure,  personnel,  and  teaching  and \nlearning  resources  for  secondary  resource  schools.  These  standards  define  key  indicators  on \nmajor  inputs  and  processes  to  improve  education  performance  and  inform  expansion  and \nresource allocation. Teaching and learning processes have integrated digital education strategies \nthrough the Policy and Strategies on Information and Communication Technology in Education in \nCambodia, which also guides resource allocation for infrastructure, technical support to schools \nand teachers, and teacher training. \n \n18. \nThe project will expand high-quality USSs by (i) upgrading ICT and science classrooms in \n36  secondary  resource  schools;  (ii)  converting  two  classrooms  in  each  of  these  schools  into \nscience  classrooms;  and  two  classrooms  in  81  upper  secondary  network  schools  into  science \nclassrooms and libraries with equipment, teaching materials, books, and furnishings; (iii) installing \nproject-based, life skills classrooms for activity-based learning in 25 secondary resource schools \nand upgrading 50 school libraries through professional development for librarians; (iv) upgrading \nwater  and  sanitation  facilities  in  18  secondary  resource  schools,  including  providing  separate \ntoilets for girls and boys; and (v) supplying solar power in selected USSs. The project will establish \ngender-responsive and culturally inclusive career guidance programs in 50 secondary resource \nschools, seven in provinces with a significant indigenous peoples\u2019 population. The program will \nestablish  partnerships  between  schools,  local  businesses,  and  industry  to  help  students \nunderstand  working  environments,  and  further  their  studies.  This  includes  site  visits,  work \nexperience  programs,  career  counseling,  and  guest  speakers  in  secondary  resource  school \nnetworks. The project will pilot test an extracurricular STEM skills program for upper secondary \nstudents, which will be delivered by external service providers, in 20 secondary resource schools. \n \n\n                                                \n17 Network schools refer to a cluster of secondary schools that are close to a secondary resource school. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n19. \nOutput  3:  Institutional  capacity  for  planning,  management,  and  delivery  of \neducation  strengthened.  This  policy-based  loan  output  improved  education  efficiency  and \neffectiveness  through  improved  management,  planning,  and  resource  allocation.  The  MoEYS \napproved school director standards to guide hiring, training, capacity building, and performance \nevaluation  of  school  directors.  The  MoEYS  approved  a  10-year  human  resource  development \nplan  for  secondary  education,  focusing  on  improving  the  qualifications  of  secondary  school \nteachers.  It  also  operationalized  the  3-year  budget  strategic  plan  that  aligns  with  education \nreforms  in  the  Education  Strategic  Plan  (footnote  12).  The  MoEYS  implemented  the  Gender \nMainstreaming Strategic Plan in Education, 2016\u20132020 and integrated budget and staff resources \nwith its departments\u2019 budget and staff allocation.18 \n \n20. \nThe  project  will  provide  in-service  training  on  school-based  management  and  the  new \ncurriculum  framework  to  some  secondary  resource  school  directors,  deputy  directors,  and \nadministration  and  finance  staff.  In-service  training  on  school-based  finance  will  reach \nadministrators  and  finance  staff  from  81  upper  secondary  network  schools,  7  of  which  are  in \nprovinces with a substantial indigenous peoples\u2019 population. The project will provide training to \nstaff  from  25  provincial  offices  of  education  on  the  new  regional  inspection  system  and  24 \npersonnel  from  the  General  Secondary  Education  Department  on  secondary  resource  school \nsupervision and mentoring. The project will improve the grade 12 examination design, delivery, \nprocessing, and analysis procedures through needs assessment and professional development \nprograms  for  Department  of  Examination  Affairs  staff.  It  will  improve  teacher  deployment, \nespecially in rural and indigenous people and/or ethnic minority areas, with increased attention to \ngender  gaps.  It  will  also  develop  multimedia  resources  for  pre-  and  in-service  training  and \ndisseminate USE success stories to encourage youth of all backgrounds to participate in USE. \n \nD. \n \n21. \nOverall program financing. The overall program is estimated to cost $53.5 million (Table \n1).  ADB  will  provide  a  policy-based  loan  of  $15.0  million  and  a  project  loan  of  $35.0  million \nequivalent. The government will provide counterpart funding of $3.5 million from its central budget. \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n \n15.0 \n35.0 \n3.5 \n53.5 \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n \n28.0 \n65.5 \n6.5 \n100.0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nOrdinary capital resources (concessional policy-based loan) \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional project loan) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n \n \nGovernment \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nProgram  financing  plan.

The \nprogram will (i) increase the number of USS graduates; (ii) improve the skills and competencies \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nof USE graduates in the labor market, leading to increased earnings; and (iii) reduce the unit cost \nof  schooling  per  student  with  the  increased  USE  participation,  retention,  and  promotion  rates. \nOverall,  the  program  is  expected  to  generate  net  benefits  with  a  present  value  of  $66  million. \nBenefits of $506 million will accrue through improved incomes of graduates and the increased \nefficiencies  of  USE  administration.  Economic  costs  total  $440  million  and  consist  primarily  of \ndirect budget expenditures and opportunity costs. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \nis 14.4%, well above the 9.0% economic opportunity cost of investment. 20 \n \nB. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s financial management assessment of the MoEYS concluded that the overall pre-\nmitigation financial management risk is substantial. Internal controls are weak because capacity \ndevelopment activities are often paid in cash. The MoEYS also has limited capacity to conduct \ninternal  audit  of  the  project\u2019s  internal  controls.  To  mitigate  against  weak  internal  controls,  the \nproject financial management manual will include procedures and mechanisms that reduce the \nuse of cash. The project will hire a national finance specialist to train the MoEYS Internal Audit \nDepartment staff on internal audit. Five trained staff will conduct the project\u2019s internal audit. ADB\u2019s \nprocurement  capacity  and  risk  assessments  showed  that  the  MoEYS  procurement  unit  can \nhandle the procurement of works, goods, and services for the project with the additional, full-time \nsupport of a national procurement specialist. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MoEYS. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nC. \n \n28. \nThe program aims to improve the quality of public USSs, which most poor youths attend. \nHigh-quality education programs improve the youth\u2019s economic potential and the country\u2019s future \ncompetitiveness. ADB assessed the program\u2019s poverty impact based on incremental benefits and \ncosts  generated  by  program  reforms.  Incremental  benefits  result  from  the  improved  future \nincome-generating  capacity  of  USE  graduates  and  the  improved  efficiency  in  the  delivery  of \neducational services in secondary schools. The calculated poverty impact ratio is 0.23, implying \nthat about 23% of net economic benefits accrue to the poor.21 \n \n29. \nThe  program  is  classified  gender  equity  as  a  theme.  The  policy  matrix  reflects  the \ngovernment\u2019s  adoption  and  implementation  of  the  Gender  Mainstreaming  Strategic  Plan  in \nEducation, 2016\u20132020 (footnote 18). For the project, the MoEYS developed a gender action plan \n(GAP) based on gender analysis and building on USESDP 1\u2019s GAP.22 It will support (i) gender \nmainstreaming  in  teaching  and  learning  (gender-responsive  pedagogy  and  materials  free  of \ngender  bias);  (ii)  a  gender-responsive  school  environment;  and  (iii)  professional  development \ntargeted to female staff. The GAP will ensure female students equally benefit from STEM-related \nactivities. The PCU will be responsible for its implementation, monitoring, and at least semiannual \nreporting to ADB. The MoEYS gender working group will also support regular monitoring. \n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n                                                \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nD. \n \n30. \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n31. \nEnvironment (category C). The proposed upgrade and renovation of facilities within the \nNIE, secondary resource schools, and selected upper secondary network schools is anticipated \nto have minimal impacts. The upgrade and renovation of classrooms and libraries and the repair \nof degraded water pipes in toilets will be limited to the confines of the existing school compounds. \nThe environmental impacts of construction and renovation works are expected to be temporary \nand localized and can be mitigated by good construction practices. The MoEYS developed an \nenvironmental  code  of  conduct  (a  simplified  environmental  management  plan)  to  address  the \nidentified  health  and  safety,  temporary  nuisance,  and  waste  management  impacts  that  it  will \ninclude in all civil works contracts. The MoEYS\u2019s quality control guidelines for works in schools \nhave  detailed  specifications  for  managing  the  environment,  safety,  security,  and  labor  during \nplanning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  school  construction  activities.  The  MoEYS\u2019s \nDepartment of Construction has experience in implementing numerous foreign-assisted projects \nand will be supported by project implementation consultants. A grievance redress mechanism will \naddress project-related complaints. None of the policy actions have environmental impacts. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement (category C). ADB\u2019s due diligence confirms there will be no \n32. \nland acquisition and resettlement impacts, as all works will be located within the boundaries of \nexisting  facilities  on  fenced  state-owned  land  and  will  not  restrict  access  to  lands  or  people\u2019s \nlivelihoods.  The  18  in-depth  interviews  in  13  sample  facilities  confirmed  the  project  can \naccommodate the upgrade of facilities within school sites. The PCU will carry out consultations \nthroughout  the  project.  It  will  establish  a  gender-inclusive,  project-specific  grievance  redress \nmechanism  to  receive,  record,  and  resolve  communities\u2019  concerns  on  project-related  impacts, \nwith  attention  to  vulnerable  people.  The  policy  actions  will  not  have  any  impact  on  involuntary \nresettlement. \n \n33. \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Educational  outcomes  for  the  five  northeastern \nprovinces  that  will  be  covered  by  the  program,  specifically  in  indigenous  people  and/or  ethnic \nminority communities, are below the national average. Students in these areas face obstacles in \ngaining  access  to  quality  and  relevant  education,  such  as  teacher  shortages,  high  levels  of \nteacher absenteeism, and insufficient relevant teacher training on a culturally inclusive curriculum. \nAlthough the  project  will  be  implemented  countrywide,  the features  that were  integrated  in the \noutputs in lieu of an indigenous peoples plan will provide enhanced benefits to indigenous people \nand/or  ethnic  minority  communities  and  learners.  Design  features  include  culturally  relevant \ntraining,  equal  access  to  enhanced  ICT  and  science  classrooms,  culturally  inclusive  career \nguidance, and improved school management in disadvantaged provinces. The policy actions will \nnot have a negative impact on indigenous peoples. The program is expected to have a positive \nimpact on indigenous peoples as defined in the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n\n \nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nE. \n \n34. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n                                                \n23 ADB.
