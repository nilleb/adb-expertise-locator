THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the COVID-19 Vaccine Support Project under the Asia Pacific \nVaccine Access Facility (APVAX).1 \n \n2.  The project will provide the Government of Pakistan, through the APVAX, with financing \nfor the procurement of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines, and for associated logistics \nand capacity strengthening activities.2 The rapid response component under the APVAX will be \nused to procure COVID-19 vaccines, and to cover international transport and port clearance \ncosts.  The  project  investment  component  under  the  APVAX  will  be  used  for  capacity \nstrengthening. Pakistan has met all APVAX access criteria (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility  \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nDemonstrated adverse   COVID-19 adversely impacted the economy in 2020, prompting a revision of the GDP \nimpact of COVID-19   forecast from a pre-COVID-19 growth projection of 2.6% to a contraction of 0.4% in \n   FY2020. For FY2021, GDP growth is expected to be 2.0%.a Without COVID-19, the \npoverty incidence (below the poverty line of $3.20 a day) was estimated at 36.4% in 2020 \nbut is expected to increase to 39.1% under the with-COVID-19 scenario.b \nCompleted needs   Assessment  of  readiness,  using  WHO\u2019s  COVID-19  Vaccine  Introduction  Readiness \nassessment   Assessment Tool and the World Bank\u2019s Vaccination Readiness Assessment Framework, \nis updated periodically with support from UNICEF, WHO, and other development partners. \nNational vaccination   MONHSR&C developed the NDVP in consultation with ministries, provincial governments, \nallocation plan   institutions, and partners. The NDVP is aligned with the global COVID-19 policies and \nstrategies of WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE). It \nprioritizes frontline health care workers, other health care workers, and vulnerable groups \n(older people and those with pre-existing conditions). \nIncremental medical  Federal EPI, in collaboration with the World Bank, prepared an ESMP for the safe \nwaste management  collection of EPI waste. Another ESMP\u2014PREP-ESMP\u2014was prepared in accordance with \nplan   the Hospital Waste Management Rules, 2005 for the safe collection, storage, transport, \nand environment-friendly disposal of COVID-19 medical waste. The PREP-ESMP is well \ndrafted and provides details on waste collection, segregation, and disposal, as well as on \ninstitutional  structure,  capacity  building,  and  monitoring.  Federal  and  provincial \ngovernments have committed to implement the PREP-ESMP. \nGovernor\u2019s letter   ADB has received the Governor\u2019s letter confirming the government\u2019s commitment to \nimplement its NDVP, including its prioritization plan, and compliance with the APVAX \nvaccine eligibility criteria.  \nEstablished effective  An effective development partner coordination mechanism is in place. The DPCC for \ndevelopment partner  COVID-19 Vaccine was officially established on 8 February 2021, and ADB participates in \ncoordination mechanism  and  contributes  to  it.

THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  The COVID-19 Pandemic \n \n4.  Status of the pandemic. Pakistan reported its first COVID-19 case on 26 February 2020. \nAs of 24 June 2021, it had 951,865 confirmed cases with 22,108 reported deaths, 5 and a national \ncase fatality ratio of 4.19%. 6 The surge since March 2021, the third wave, represents 39% of the \ntotal number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 42% of reported deaths. Some cities and districts \nstill show positivity rates over 11.5%, which is higher than the 5% benchmark of the World Health \nOrganization (WHO).7 This indicates significant under-testing and suggests that many infections \nmay have gone undetected. \n \n5.  Country context. Pakistan is a lower middle-income country and the world\u2019s fifth-most \npopulous country. Health care was devolved to the provinces in 2010 under the 18th Amendment \nof the Constitution and is under-invested. Current health expenditure per capita was $43 in 2018, \nhalf the average of $86 for lower middle-income countries.8 Out-of-pocket payments account for \n56.2% of the current health expenditure, far above WHO's recommended threshold of 20%,9 \nshowing weak protection against a financial catastrophe caused by health expenses. The country \nhas some of the highest maternal and child mortality rates in the Central and West Asia region, \nand the overall quality of its health services remains poor. Health infrastructure is extremely \nlimited. In 2017, Pakistan had 0.6 hospital beds per 1,000 people, compared with an average of \n2.0 beds for lower middle-income countries. In 2020, before the onset of COVID-19, it had 3,124 \nintensive care unit beds, about 1.5 per 100,000 people.10  \n \n2.  Impact of the Pandemic \n \n6.  Cost for the economy. Pakistan's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 1.9% in fiscal \nyear (FY) 2019, but in 2020, the impact of COVID-19 turned a pre-pandemic projection of 2.6% \nGDP growth into a contraction of 0.4% for FY2020.11 For FY2021, GDP growth is expected to be \n2.0%, but the estimate does not take into account the third wave of COVID-19 infections that \n \n3  Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). 2021.

On 24 March 2020, it announced \na PRs1.2 trillion relief package to provide support to low-income groups. From March\u2013June 2020, \nmore than 5 million people were provided a monthly stipend of PRs3,000 through the current \nsocial protection program. Multilateral and bilateral development partners increased their support \nconsiderably to bolster the government\u2019s stabilization efforts, with about $3.4 billion in financing \nfrom ADB, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the \nWorld Bank for the COVID-19 response.  \n \n7.  Impact  on poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  Even  before  the  outbreak  of  COVID-19, \nPakistan's poverty incidence was quite high. Measured at $3.2/day, it was 33.9% in 2017, \nincreasing to 34.3% in 2018, and to 35.4% in 2019. The pandemic exacerbated the situation with \na spike to 39.1% in 2020.15 The unemployment rate is expected to rise because of the reduced \neconomic activity, since more than 70% of the country's non-agricultural labor force is employed \nby small and medium-sized enterprises which have been especially hit hard. Pakistan has one of \nthe highest numbers of overseas workers in the Central and West Asia region\u2013\u2013almost 11 million \nPakistanis are working in other countries. The contraction of economies worldwide may reduce \nthe overseas employment options and further drive up the unemployment rates when these \nmigrants return. Even remittances through formal channels are expected to decline drastically \nafter the initial uptick (para. 6), thereby increasing the poverty rate.  \n \n8.  Impact on gender. While women account for about 36% of the confirmed COVID-19 \ncases and 37% of the reported deaths, fewer economic opportunities in the country and a rise in \npoverty levels may disproportionately affect them. Women have a smaller share in waged \nemployment than men, and more than 70% of those women work in the informal sector, mostly \nhome-based, unpaid, or associated with vulnerable sectors. The World Bank found that more than \n25% of women in Pakistan have lost their jobs because of the pandemic.16 Another study shows \nthat a fall in job postings resulting from COVID-19 disproportionately affected industries in which \nfemale employment is concentrated.17 Phone surveys conducted in Pakistan reveal that women \nare less likely to receive important information related to COVID-19, and women\u2019s time spent on \nunpaid domestic and care work has increased.18 Furthermore, a study of microfinance clients \nconcludes that businesses run by women were more likely to experience a 100% decrease in \nbusiness revenue during the pandemic.19  \n \n9.  Impact  on  the  health  system.  COVID-19  has  disrupted  essential  health  services, \nincluding immunizations, particularly in the first half of 2020.20 Health systems, which were \n \n12 ADB. 2021.

Initial  government  measures  to  control  the  pandemic.  The  National  Security \nCommittee of the Government of Pakistan constituted the National Coordination Committee on \n13 March 2020, chaired by the Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health, to formulate and \nimplement a comprehensive strategy to stop the transmission of the virus and mitigate its \nconsequences.  The  coordination  committee  includes  federal  ministers,  chief  ministers,  and \nprovincial health departments, who named the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) \nas  the  leading  operational  agency.  The  government  (i)  enhanced  the  existing  Disease \nSurveillance and Response System for use as the central database for COVID-19, into which all \npoints of entry, quarantine sites, hospitals, and laboratories would feed real-time information; and \n(ii) designated 2,942 isolation ward beds in 215 medical facilities, 25,949 hospital beds, and \nallocated 1,885 out of 3,989 ventilators in health facilities for COVID-19 patients. A partial \nlockdown, imposed in March 2020, was gradually eased from May 2020 and replaced with \nlocalized lockdowns.  \n   \n11.  Lessons  learned.  During  the  initial  lockdown  and  COVID-19  restrictions,  the  child \nimmunization programs were severely affected.  To prevent future disruptions of the ongoing \npediatric  immunization  programs  at  the  sites  of  Pakistan's  Expanded  Programme  on \nImmunization (Federal EPI), vaccination takes place at 2,823 COVID-19 vaccination counters, \nincluding 24 mass vaccination centers. It involves 4,000 nurses and medical personnel (40%\u2013\n50% of them women) who were trained to safely administer the vaccines and safely dispose of \nthe used needles. To address the threat to the health care workforce, the health care workers \nare prioritized for vaccination, and over 60% of were fully vaccinated by 15 June 2021, in line \nwith the NDVP prioritization. According to the experience to date, the availability of vaccines in \nPakistan determines the progress in vaccination.  \n \n3.  Government\u2019s Response  \n \n12.  Needs assessment. An ADB-funded study, using an agent-based model to estimate \nSARS-CoV-2  infections22  over  a  two-year  intervention  duration  and  assuming  moderate \nrestrictions only with no lockdowns, found that a 12-month vaccination rollout to 70% of adults \nwould result in 76 million fewer COVID-19 infections and about 108,700 fewer deaths than would \nbe the case in a theoretical situation with no (further) vaccination.23 To reduce the infection rate \nand lower the number of hospital admissions of the more severe cases, vaccination against \nCOVID-19 is needed.  \n \n13.  National deployment and vaccination plan. The Ministry of National Health Services, \nRegulations  and  Coordination  (MONHSR&C)  and  Federal  EPI  developed  the  NDVP  in \nconsultation with other ministries, institutions, provinces, and partners (footnote 3).

It is a phased approach, prioritizing \nfrontline health care workers before other health workers; the elderly, including marginalized \ngroups  such  as  refugees  and  internally  displaced  persons;  and  younger  people  with \ncomorbidities. The cost for implementing the NDVP for 2021 is estimated at $1,950 million. \n \n14.  Four avenues for procuring vaccines exist at present. Pakistan is a member of the COVID-\n19 Vaccines Global Access Advanced Market Commitment (COVAX AMC),24 one of the four \npillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator25 under WHO.26 Pakistan is eligible for \nreceiving free vaccines through COVAX AMC for up to 20% of its population. The second avenue \nis  to  procure  additional  COVID-19  vaccines  via  the  COVAX  Facility.27  The  third  is  direct \nprocurement from manufacturers, and the fourth is by allowing the private sector to import and \nadminister vaccines approved by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP). As of \n24 June 2021, the private sector had imported 50,000 doses of the DRAP-approved Sputnik V \nvaccine and administered them at a price of PRs12,268 for a pack of two doses, set by the \nHonorable Sindh High Court.28  \n \n15.  As of 26 June 2021, 14.2 million persons had been vaccinated, 2.7 million of them fully. \nAs of 16 June 2021, among those not engaged as health care workers, women constitute 35% \nof the partially vaccinated and 36% of the fully vaccinated people. The NDVP includes a \ncommunity engagement and communication plan. An operational plan outline was developed \nwith the assistance of the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) to help overcome vaccine \nhesitancy and create demand for vaccination; this includes engaging religious and community \nleaders to take ownership of the pandemic and promote vaccine acceptance; and involving \ncivil society and nongovernment organizations, and local health and social staff (footnote 3).  \n \n16.  To distribute the vaccines throughout Pakistan, the tested and proven EPI framework and \nsystem is used.29 Vaccination takes place at 2,823 COVID-19 vaccination counters, including 24 \nmass vaccination centers, in health facilities. The capacities for storage, transportation, and \nquality control of vaccines were assessed and are being upgraded. For instance, funded by ADB, \n23 units of ultracold chain equipment needed for the Pfizer vaccines were added.30 Federal EPI\u2019s \nCOVID-19 inventory management system tracks the distribution of vaccines, while the national \n \n24  Gavi launched COVAX-AMC in June 2020. It is an innovative financing instrument that aims to support the \nparticipation of 92 low- and middle-income economies in COVAX, which enables them to access donor-funded doses \nof safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. Together with support for country readiness and delivery, COVAX AMC \nwill ensure that the most vulnerable in all countries can be protected in the short term, regardless of income level (S. \nBerkley. The Gavi COVAX AMC Explained. Gavi). \n25  Launched in April 2020, the ACT Accelerator, is a groundbreaking global collaboration to accelerate development, \nproduction, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It is organized into four pillars: \ndiagnostics, treatment (therapeutics), vaccines, and health system strengthening (WHO. COVAX). Each pillar is vital \nto the overall effort and involves innovation and collaboration (WHO. The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) \nAccelerator). \n26  The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Gavi, WHO, and the World Bank.  \n27  COVID-19 vaccines procured through the COVAX Facility are not free of charge, but because of the nature of the \npooled procurement, a global fair allocation plan may be cheaper than direct procurement from manufacturers.  \n28  S.

To improve access for mobility-challenged persons, those aged 80 years \nand older may avail of home vaccination. Adverse events following immunization are monitored \nvigilantly, and major ones will be investigated by a committee. \n \n4.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n17.  The MONHSR&C, with support from Federal EPI, is coordinating the health sector \nresponse, including the NDVP, with all partners involved. UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank \nhave co-leading roles. A development partners coordination committee comprising ADB; Federal \nEPI; the United Kingdom's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office; Gavi, the Vaccine \nAlliance (Gavi); UNICEF; United States Agency for International Development; WHO; the World \nBank; and other partners was formed to ensure wider participation of all national and international \nstakeholders and vaccine experts in support of the MONHSR&C. ADB\u2019s work will complement \nthe assistance of other development partners for the procurement and transport of vaccines, and \nto strengthen the capacity of the MONHSR&C and Federal EPI. As a beneficiary of COVAX AMC, \nPakistan  is  eligible  to  receive  vaccines  for  20%  of  its  population.  A  World  Bank  loan  of \n$153 million has been restructured for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines, and operational \ncosts. The Islamic Development Bank offered to restructure the allocated $70 million loan for the \nprocurement and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. The three institutions\u2019 COVID-19 vaccine \nprocurement projects complement each other and will be coordinated from a single project \nmanagement unit (PMU). \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n18.  Impact and outcome. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) vulnerable \ngroups protected from COVID-19 (footnote 3); and (ii) spread, morbidity, and mortality of SARS-\nCoV-2 reduced, and confidence of citizens restored (footnote 1). It is an integral part of the \ndevelopment partner package and will assist the government\u2019s efforts to mitigate the health, \nsocial, and economic impacts of the pandemic and strengthen the country\u2019s immunization system.  \n \n19.  Output 1: COVID-19 vaccines procured and delivered to designated points. The \nproject will provide financing to procure vaccines. The government may procure them through \ndirect contracting with manufacturers and/or via the COVAX Facility and/or directly engaging \nUNICEF. An estimated 39.83 million doses for COVID-19 vaccines will be delivered to provincial \nEPI warehouses.33 The expenditure items will include: (i) under the rapid response component, \nvaccines that meet any of the eligibility requirements in the APVAX policy (footnote 1), including \nadvance payments, and international logistics and related services required for the transportation \nof vaccines from the place of purchase to the warehouse of Federal EPI; and (ii) under the project \ninvestment component, safety boxes, syringes, and other items required for the administration of \nthe vaccines, and national logistics and related services required for the transportation of vaccines \nfrom the warehouse of Federal EPI to designated delivery points in Pakistan (footnote 31).  \n \n \n31 Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 2021.

Output 2: Vaccine program implementation capacity strengthened. Under the project \ninvestment component, the project will strengthen the capacity of the MONHSR&C and Federal \nEPI through a PMU to help them implement the COVID-19 vaccine program effectively and \nefficiently. The PMU will receive essential support from consultants funded by the project, \ncovering project management and coordination, procurement and supply chain management, \nincluding  distribution;  gender  mainstreaming;  monitoring  and  evaluation;  performance  and \ninformation systems audits; and waste management. Additional international expertise may be \norganized through existing technical assistance.34 \n \n21.  ADB value addition. The proposed project is part of ADB's holistic support for Pakistan's \nresponse to the COVID-19 crisis, and will help mitigate the adverse health, social, and economic \nimpacts while targeting vulnerable population segments and ensuring gender mainstreaming. The \nsupport  for  the  procurement,  deployment,  and  administration  of  vaccines  is  coupled  with \n(i) upgraded  and  expanded  medical  treatment  of  COVID-19  cases  through  an  emergency \nassistance loan,35 of which $103 million (including cofinancing of $20 million from Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement) is for the health sector; (ii) the $500 million COVID-19 Active \nResponse and Expenditure Support program, which helps alleviate the negative economic and \nsocial impacts of the pandemic through government budget support and cash transfers to poor \nfamilies,36 and (iii) a quick response to the need for medical supplies, which was provided through \na $2 million grant under the Asia Pacific Disaster Relief Fund.37 Capacity building and due \ndiligence are organized through technical assistance.38 To further enhance Pakistan's future \nresilience to epidemics and pandemics, ADB is exploring support for quality vaccine production \nby the country\u2019s private sector. As for the proposed project, ADB will ensure that internationally \nreputed and medically certified vaccine(s) eligible under APVAX policy will be made available to \nthe population of Pakistan. It will also ensure gender mainstreaming, such as through tailored \ninformation for women, access to vaccine, and gender-sensitive vaccination processes. ADB\u2019s \ndue  diligence  on  financial  management,  medical  waste  management,  and  cold  chain \nmanagement will add to efficiencies in line with international best practices. \n \nC.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n22.  The project is estimated to cost $581.0 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).39  \nThe major expenditure items that constitute the project are the purchase and delivery of COVID-\n19 vaccines that meet APVAX eligibility criteria, ancillary goods and services, and consulting \nservices for developing the capacity of the MONHSR&C and Federal EPI. \n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Debt sustainability analysis. The debt sustainability analysis suggests that under the \nprogram\u2019s baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline gradually from \n92.9% in FY2020 to 69.2% by FY2026. 40 While total public debt remains sustainable, during \nFY2020\u2013FY2025 the public debt-to-GDP ratio remains higher than the debt threshold of 70%, \nbefore declining to 69.2% in FY2026. Despite improvement in the maturity structure of the public \ndebt, macro-fiscal shocks continue to pose threat to debt sustainability. The government has so \nfar been successful to secure external financing to meet the financing gap, yet lower-than-\nexpected economic growth, rise in primary deficit, increase in real interest rate, the surge in \ncontingent liabilities, and exchange rate depreciation, have the potential in widening the financing \ngap and thereby undermining debt sustainability. Although financial assistance from ADB and \nother development partners will not impair debt sustainability, the government will need to monitor \nthe fiscal risks and remain committed to fiscal consolidation to maintain macroeconomic stability \nto ensure debt sustainability.  \n \n24.  The government has requested a concessional loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n25.  The summary financing plan is in Table 3. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \nthe procurement and delivery of the COVID-19 vaccines and of ancillary goods to the designated \npoints, consulting services, and project management costs. The government provided assurance \nthat it will cover any shortfall of the required finances. The government will contribute $55.7 million \nto cover taxes and duties through exemption, and provide office space and counterpart staff, as \nagreed with the government. Moreover, the government will contribute $25.3 million from the state \nbudget for interest payments during project implementation.  \n \nTable 3: Summary Financing Plan  \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nOverall program     \nADB ordinary capital resources (concessional, APVAX)     \nRapid response component   491.7  84.6 \nProject investment component   8.3  1.4 \nGovernment contribution       \nTax and duty exemptions, project management, and contingency  55.7  9.6 \n        Interest during implementation  25.3  4.4 \nTotal  581.0   100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, APVAX = Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility. \nSources: Asian Development Bank; and Government of Pakistan. \n \n \n40 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n26.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 39). The MONHSR&C will be the executing agency, and Federal EPI will be \nthe implementing agency. Only Federal EPI shall be responsible for the pooled procurement of \nlogistical and transportation services, and the recruitment of consulting services. A joint PMU will \nbe established for the project with funding from ADB, the Islamic Development Bank, and the \nWorld Bank. The PMU project director will be located at Federal EPI, reporting to the National \nProgram  Manager  of  Federal  EPI,  who  in  turn  will  report  to  the  Director  General  of  the \nMONHSR&C. Project oversight will be provided through the deputy director (P-IV) and supply \nchain and procurement advisor of MONHSR&C. The National Vaccine Task Force is supported \nby an inter-ministerial and a technical subcommittee, whose guidance and support will be solicited \nfor the coordination with provinces and the timely implementation of project activities across the \ncountry. The Development Partners Coordination Committee will provide technical support to the \nMONHSR&C for the timely implementation of project activities.  \n \n27.  Value for money in procurement will be achieved by securing multiple types of vaccines \neither through several bilateral deals or through COVAX on reasonable commercial terms, \nincluding  timely  procurement  under  the  project  investment  component  and  through  close \nmonitoring for timely vaccine delivery and rollout. \n \n28.  Governance structure. The National Coordination Committee on COVID-19 supervises \nthe  COVID-19  vaccine  deployment  and  takes  all  the  necessary  decisions  relating  to \nadministration and management under direct guidance from the Prime Minister. To ensure \nconsensus-based national decision-making and deployment, the government established the \nNational Command and Operation Center (NCOC) to spearhead the overall COVID-19 response \nand take immediate decisions, including on the vaccine rollout. The NCOC is chaired by the \nMinister  of  Planning,  Development  and  Special  Initiatives;  and  attended  by  the  Minister, \nSecretary, and Director General of MONHSR&C; Federal EPI; and representatives from the \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the Drug \nRegulatory Authority of Pakistan, and the National Database and Registration Authority. National \ndecision-making  is  supported  by  provincial  officials,  health  ministers,  chief  secretaries, \nsecretaries and directors general of health, as well as provincial EPI teams. A performance auditor \nshall also be recruited to monitor the performance of the project from procurement to distribution \nof the COVID-19 vaccines in accordance with the National Plan for COVID-19 Vaccination, and \nto conduct a performance audit on an annual basis. \n  \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  August 2021\u2013June 2023 \nEstimated completion  30 June 2023 \ndate \nEstimated loan closing  31 December 2023 \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Cabinet Procurement Committee, NCOC, National Vaccine Task Force, and Procurement \nCommittee headed by NDMA \n(ii)  Executing agency  MONHSR&C \nThe Office of the Director General Health of MONHSR&C will coordinate the overall \nvaccine procurement and vaccination rollout and help coordinate project activities with all \nstakeholders. \n(iii)  Key implementing  Federal EPI will coordinate the overall vaccination, procurement of all activities under \nagencies  output 2, and vaccination rollout and help coordinate project activities with all stakeholders  \n ", "10 \nAspects  Arrangements \n(iv)  Implementation  A combined project management unit will be established for the project with funding from \nunit  ADB, Islamic Development Bank, and World Bank.  \nDirect contracting to manufacturers,  Multiple contracts  $482.05 million \nUNICEF or COVAX Facility for vaccine \nsupply \nProcurement \nSafety boxes and syringes  1 contract  $2.28 million \nAEFI kits, cotton rolls and vaccine  Multiple contracts  $2.41 million \ncarriers   \nInternational transportation and  Multiple contracts  $9.50 million \n \ndistribution including port clearance  \n  Printing of forms for vaccine process  Multiple contracts  $0.24 million \nIndividual consultants, (support to  Multiple contracts  $0.50 million \nConsulting Services  \nMONHSR&C and EPI)   \n  CQS (performance audit and  1 contract  $0.12 million \ninformation systems audit firms) \nRetroactive financing  Retroactive financing is envisaged to reimburse eligible expenditures on COVID-19 \nand/or advance  vaccines, national consultants, logistics, and transportation of vaccines to designated \nfinancing /contracting  points, subject to a maximum of 30% of the loan amount, provided that expenditures are \nincurred prior to loan effectiveness but after the declaration of the COVID-19 emergency \nor the allocation of resources for it, and not earlier than 12 months before the date of the \nloan agreement; and provided that disbursement conditions are met.

The \ncombined outstanding balance of advance financing and retroactive financing should not, \nat any time, exceed 60% of the RRC loan amount, while the advance financing and \nretroactive financing remain within their respective ceilings. Any advance financing and \nretroactive financing will be subject to the vaccine eligibility criteria and other requirements \nunder the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility policy being fully met. \nThe issuance of invitations to bid and of consulting services recruitment notices under \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing will be subject to ADB approval. The \ngovernment, and executing and implementing agencies, were advised that approval of \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \nDisbursementa  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; AEFI = adverse event following immunization; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; \nCQS = consultants\u2019 qualification selection; EPI = Expanded Programme on Immunization; MONHSR&C = Ministry of \nHealth Services, Regulations and Coordination; NCOC = National Command and Operation Center; NDMA = National \nDisaster Management Authority; RRC = rapid response component; UNICEF = United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. \nNote: Estimated costs of contracts are exclusive of taxes. \na  For guidance, refer to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Analysis \n \n29.  The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis, generating loss of lives \nand a major economic downturn arising from (i) the introduction of containment measures that \nrestrict  economic  activities  and  (ii)  a  wider  economy-wide  slowdown  in  investment  and \ninternational  trade.  Averting  further  loss  and  paving  the  way  for  recovery  from  economic \nstagnation  will  require  a  comprehensive  vaccination  effort  combined  with  other  effective \nsuppression measures. The vaccination program will result in substantially reduced mortality and \nmorbidity, and contribute to bringing the economy back on track by encouraging the resumption \nof economic activities, including production, investment, and trade. A project financial viability \nassessment was not undertaken, since the project outputs are not meant to produce direct \nrevenue for cost recovery. The country\u2019s vaccination program is financially sustainable. The \n ", "11 \nCOVID-19 vaccine agenda is part of the normal activities of Federal EPI; hence, the government \nis committed to providing funding in the future. As of 24 June 2021, the government used $178.81 \nmillion from its budget resources to support vaccine procurement. The MONHSR&C will need to \ngive budget assurance that it is committed to providing full future funding for the operation and \nmanagement costs, to maintain the cold chain equipment being procured under ADB financing. \n \nB.  Governance and Anticorruption \n \n30.  Governance.  Pakistan  has  extensive  centralized  legislative  and  institutional  public \nfinancial management structures, but their effective and efficient implementation is challenged by \na decentralized service delivery system. As a government ministry and national program, the  \nMONHSR&C and Federal EPI are subject to external audits by the constitutionally independent \noffice of the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP), the supreme audit institution of the country \nbestowed with powers given by the Constitution of Pakistan to  conduct external audits of \ngovernment entities. External audits performed by the AGP continue to face delays in the \nexecution and settlement of audit observations. In addition to the statutory external audits by the \nAGP, the MONHSR&C and Federal EPI have established internal audit units to strengthen the \ngovernance and control environments. The latest assessment of the country\u2019s public financial \nmanagement system concluded that the federal internal audit function requires improvement.41 \n \n31.  The ADB project financial statements will be subject to annual external audits by the AGP \nin line with the financial reporting requirements specified in the loan agreement. ADB project \naudits are being conducted in timely fashion by the AGP\u2019s foreign-aided project audits wing. The \nproject will also be subject to regular internal audits by the respective MONHSR&C and Federal \nEPI units. The PAM includes specific actions that govern the conduct of periodic internal audits \nand the reporting of results. A further layer of accountability is introduced by the constitutionally \nindependent National Accountability Bureau, which is mandated to investigate public sector \nprocurement beyond a threshold of PRs50 million.  \n \n32.  Pakistan  has  adequate  anticorruption  legislation,  institutions,  and  systems  in  place; \nhowever, ineffective implementation and poor enforcement of the anticorruption measures make \nthe country vulnerable to corruption. Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index \ncontinues to place Pakistan in the bottom third of the assessed countries, with a score of 31 out \nof 100 in 2020. The World Bank\u2019s Control of Corruption indicator for Pakistan has been low for \nthe last 5 years, and in 2019 stood at 21.2. In addition, Pakistan remains on the Financial Action \nTask Force\u2019s grey list, which denotes weaknesses in the laws, rules, and regulations to combat \nmoney laundering and terrorism financing, and weakness in the efforts to mitigate financial crime. \nThe Financial Action Task Force predicated offenses include corruption and bribery. Pakistan's \nintegrity  and  corruption  risks  have  also  been  considered  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date)42 was explained to \nand discussed with the government, the MONHSR&C, and Federal EPI. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n41 Government of Pakistan. 2012.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.43  \n \n34.  Environment (category C). The proposed services (relating to the procurement and \ndistribution of vaccines only) will have minor environmental impacts during the implementation \nphase, involving mainly the generation of COVID-19 immunization waste, such as used syringes, \nneedles, and personal protective equipment. It is also confirmed that Federal EPI's environmental \nand social management plan and the recent update (Pandemic Response Effectiveness in \nPakistan)44 are adequate to deal with such type of waste.  \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). The project does not \nentail any physical intervention that could cause any involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeople impacts, and thus is classified as category C. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n36.  Poverty  and  social  considerations.  The  project  supports  poverty  alleviation  with \nmeasures to safeguard the health of citizens and to bring the economy back on track by \nencouraging the resumption of economic activities.45 To increase accessibility and reduce cost \nentry barriers, the vaccines are made available free of charge and administered through 2,823 \nCOVID-19 vaccination counters covering Pakistan, thereby helping to reduce transport cost and \nfinancial barriers to access.  \n \n37.  Gender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming.46 The gender \naction plan has the following key gender actions: (i) collection of sex- and age-disaggregated data \non all government priority target groups to be vaccinated; (ii) implementation of a comprehensive \ncommunication and outreach plan for hard-to-reach communities and vulnerable groups; (iii) \nsupport mechanisms to facilitate the vaccination of women and vulnerable segments with no \nidentity papers and mobile services; (iv) inclusion of women and vulnerable groups in satisfaction \nsurveys; (v) provision of a mechanism for women and vulnerable groups to seek advice and \nguidance on access to vaccination counters, side effects of vaccination, and related information; \nand (vi) capacity building for the MONHSR&C and Federal EPI that includes at least 40% of \nfemale staff and consultants. \n \nE.  Financial Due Diligence \n \n38.  Financial management. The financial management assessment concluded that the \noverall pre-mitigated financial management risk of the project is substantial given the risks \nassociated with accountability arrangements, potential inventory management issues because of \nthe high-volume and geographically dispersed vaccine distribution and administration process, \nand  lack  of  experience  by  the  executing  and/or  implementing  agencies  in  the  financial \nmanagement  of  ADB-funded  projects.  Mitigation  measures  are  discussed  in  the  financial \nmanagement assessment,47 and are described in Table 5.  \n \n \n43 ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement . Manila. \n44 World Bank. 2020.

Procurement \n \n39.  Procurement will be undertaken in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient \nprocedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).48 \nFollowing the APVAX policy (footnote 1), universal procurement will apply. The Cabinet has \nexempted the COVID-19 vaccine procurement from the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority \nrules 2004. The Cabinet constituted a sub-committee of cabinet for the procurement of COVID-\n19 vaccines in terms of Rule 17 (2), of Rules of Business 1973. Under the direction of the NCOC, \na dedicated National Vaccine Task Force was set up with two sub-committees: (i) Inter-Ministerial \nCommittee for COVID-19 Vaccine and (ii) Technical Committee for COVID-19 Vaccine. The \ntechnical committee is responsible for evaluating the vaccines, reviewing the development of the \nglobal vaccine situation, and formulating Pakistan-specific guidelines for COVID-19 vaccines \nbased on global best practices. The task force is further supported by a vaccine negotiating team. \nDirect negotiations for bilateral deals with vaccine manufacturers are led by NDMA as part of the \nprocurement committee. Procurement of vaccine through COVAX Facility and/or through UNICEF \nwill be led by MONHSR&C. Fiduciary responsibility for the procurement of eligible vaccines will \nremain with MONHSR&C. ADB will provide financing for the vaccine procurement only once the \nAPVAX vaccine eligibility criteria have been met.49 To be eligible for financing under the loan, the \nMONHSR&C and Federal EPI shall submit vaccine procurement contracts for ADB\u2019s prior review \nto ensure compliance with the APVAX policy requirements.  \n \n40.  A strategic procurement planning exercise was carried out for the MONHSR&C and \nFederal EPI. Notwithstanding the special arrangements put in place for the vaccine procurement, \nthe procurement risk under the proposed project is rated high because of the limited capacity of \nthe MONHSR&C and Federal EPI, a severely constrained vaccine market, the large bargaining \npower of the vaccine manufacturers, and the government's reliance on bilateral deals.
