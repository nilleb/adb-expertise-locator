The  program \nsupports the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational priority on strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity, particularly in small island developing states.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment  context.  Fiji  has  had  a  stable  government  and  policy  direction  for  more \nthan  a  decade,  with  uninterrupted  economic  growth  since  2010.  Fiji  has  become  a  hub  for \nneighboring  South  Pacific  countries,  but  growth  remains  constrained  by  its  remote  location, \ndispersed islands, and small population. Fiji is also vulnerable to disasters triggered by natural \nhazards,  including  cyclones  and  floods.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  has  estimated \nsuch  events  may  reduce  Fiji\u2019s  potential  annual  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  by  2 \npercentage points.3 Historically, real GDP growth has been low and volatile, averaging 2.5% per \nyear from 1980 to 2018. \n \n4. \nEconomic  performance.  The  government  has  driven  growth  performance  since  2010 \nthrough expansionary fiscal policy, including by cutting taxes and increasing public investment, \nand  accommodative  monetary  policy  with  relatively  low  interest  rates.  Efforts  to  improve  SOE \nprofitability are working, but SOE productivity remains low, and they contributed just 4.0% to GDP \nin 2014 despite controlling up to 17% of the economy\u2019s total fixed assets.4 The potential gain from \nopening areas of the economy to the private sector is considerable. Economic growth averaged \n4.5% per year from 2014 to 2018. Growth is forecast at 2.9% in 2019 and 3.2% in 2020, based \non expectations of steady tourism expansion and sustained public and private enterprise growth. \n \nFiscal  situation.  Reliance  on  public  sector-led  growth  has  resulted  in  an  average  net \n5. \nfiscal deficit of 3.1% of GDP from FY2014 to FY2018 (Table 1). In FY2019, public expenditure is \nestimated at 28.9% of GDP, with a net fiscal deficit of 3.3% financed by external and domestic \nborrowings. The estimated FY2020 deficit is 2.6%, with debt equivalent to 44.8% of GDP. There \nis room for additional government borrowing, but the public debt ceiling is 50% of GDP. Given the \nlimited fiscal space, and the need to build fiscal buffers to ensure adequate resources for disaster \nresponse, the government needs to carefully balance fiscal consolidation and the resultant impact \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

Fiscal \nindicators are calculated using available GDP data and  Asian Development Bank forward estimates, and they differ \nfrom data in the FY2019 national budget (released in June 2018) as well as from that presented in subprogram 1. \nSource: Government of Fiji and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nMacroeconomic challenges. Fiji\u2019s small size, remoteness, and susceptibility to disasters \n6. \nresult  in  a  high-cost  business  environment  that  discourages  private  sector  activity,  especially \noutside tourism and construction.6 From 2010 to 2017, total investment averaged 18.9% of GDP. \nPublic investment increased from 3.3% of GDP in 2010\u20132013 to 5.8% of GDP in 2014\u20132017, but \nprivate and SOE investments declined from 13.9% of GDP to 11.4% of GDP during this period.7 \nFiji is seeking to stimulate a sustained increase in private investment to reduce reliance on public \ninvestment  to  drive  economic  growth.  This  will  enable  more  rapid,  broad-based  growth,  while \nensuring  the  government  retains  sufficient  fiscal  room  to  respond  to  shocks.  The  government \nacknowledges the need for more private investment to meet its long-term 5% growth target, which \nis estimated to require an investment\u2013GDP ratio of 25%. In 2018, the IMF advised the government \nthat sustaining high growth will require continuity in structural reforms that lower the cost of doing \nbusiness and improve the overall business climate.8 \n \n7. \nADB engagement. ADB has engaged in public sector management and private sector \ndevelopment through regional and country-specific technical assistance (TA) projects to support \npublic financial management (PFM),  SOE reform, and business climate reform.9 Lessons from \nADB\u2019s  engagement  in  these  areas  in  Fiji  and  across  the  Pacific,  including  from  implementing \nsubprogram  1,  are  to  (i)  identify  champions  to  strengthen  reform  commitment  and  lead \nimplementation,  particularly  for  SOE  reform  and  divestment;  (ii)  obtain  endorsement  so  that \nreforms  are  not  derailed  if  leadership  changes;  (iii)  pursue  moderate,  sequenced  reforms, \nespecially  if  institutional capacity  is  limited; (iv)  provide  sufficient time to develop  capacity  and \ninstitutionalize  reforms;  (v)  meet  with  the  government  specialists  responsible  for  undertaking \n\n                                                \n5  ADB  has  recognized  the  important  role  policy-based  lending  can  play  in  these  circumstances  (Independent \nEvaluation  Department.  2018.

The program has identified \nchampions  in  each  ministry  and  meets  regularly  with  permanent  secretaries  to  ensure \ncommitment  will  withstand  staff  changes.  Improved  coordination  of  TA  support  from  ADB  and \nother  development  partners  has  increased  government  capacity  to  complete  reforms  while \nreinforcing the program\u2019s analytical underpinning (footnote 9). \n \nB. \n \n8. \nGovernment strategy. The government\u2019s National Development Plan, 2017\u20132036 (NDP) \nenvisions inclusive socioeconomic development through a strategy to become a regional South \nPacific hub for business, transport, communications, and other services; and targets a fourfold \nincrease in per capita income by 2036.10 To achieve this goal, the government recognizes the \nneed for greater private investment and participation by accelerating structural reforms. \n \n9. \nStructural reform program. Since 2007, the government has introduced substantive and \nprogressive structural reforms to improve the business environment and opportunities for private \nsector-driven growth. With support from ADB and other development partners, the government is \naccelerating  efforts  to  increase  private  investment.  Priority  areas  for  implementation  of  NDP \nreforms  are  (i)  fiscal  management,  particularly  PFM;  (ii)  the  policy,  legal,  and  institutional \nframework  for  SOEs  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs);  and  (iii)  the  business  and \ninvestment climate.11 \n \n10. \nAssistance modality. The government has requested a programmatic policy-based loan \nseries  with  three  subprograms  (2018,  2019,  and  2020)  to  support  NDP  implementation.  The \ngovernment, ADB, and the World Bank have agreed on substantive policy actions that require \nsufficient  time  for  preparation  and  constituency  building  to  garner  political  support.  The \nsequencing of reforms over three subprograms (i) accommodated the financing need for FY2018, \nthrough subprogram 1, approved in June 2018 for $15 million; and (ii) matches further program \nfinancing  to  anticipated  budget  needs,  while  allowing  time  for  effective  and  sustained \nimplementation. The programmatic approach allows for prioritization across multiple reform areas \nto account for limited implementation capacity, while providing flexibility to respond to emerging \nopportunities and constraints. \n \n11. \nAlignment.  The  program  (i)  will  help  the  government  achieve  inclusive  socioeconomic \ndevelopment (para. 8); (ii) is fully aligned with the government\u2019s policy priorities in national budget \ndocuments and the NDP; (iii) is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023 \nfor  Fiji  and  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u20132019  in  its  focus  on  reducing  the  cost  of  doing  business, \nmanaging  risks  from  natural  and  economic  shocks,  and  enabling  value  creation  by  supporting \nprivate sector growth;12 and (iv) with regards to Strategy 2030, (a) directly supports the operational \npriority  of  strengthening  institutional  capacity  for  governance  by  strengthening  the  quality  and \ncapacity of public institutions to undertake reforms and promote private sector development; and \n\n                                                \n10 Government  of  Fiji,  Ministry  of  Economy.  2017.  5-Year  &  20-Year  National  Development  Plan:  Transforming  Fiji. \n\n11 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2); and ADB. 2018.

Implementation of the government\u2019s structural reform agenda underpins \nthe provision of policy-based lending from ADB and the World Bank.13 Subprogram 2 actions build \non  reforms  undertaken  through  subprogram  1  and  provide  direction  for  subsequent  indicative \ntriggers for subprogram 3, ensuring that formal policy underpinnings are in place and reforms are \ncredible, consistent, and predictable. Under subprogram 2, ADB supports 21 policy actions across \nthree reform areas contained in the policy matrix (Appendix 4) and described in paras. 13\u201319.  \n \n13. \nSome indicative actions for subprogram 2 presented in the documentation for subprogram \n1 were adjusted.14 Nonetheless, the overall strength of subprogram 2 has been maintained given \nearly  and  overachievement  of  some  policy  actions,  addition  of  new  policy  actions,  changes  to \nincrease the efficiency of policy actions in supporting program outcomes, and the relatively less \ncentral nature of delayed actions.15 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nOne  indicative  subprogram  3  action  was  brought  forward  to  subprogram  2:  the \ncirculation  of  a  draft  investment  bill  to  stakeholders  upon  the  approval  of  an \ninvestment policy statement. The subprogram 2 policy action on divestments and \nPPPs was surpassed, with two transactions (only one was required). \nTwo substantial actions were added to subprogram 2:(a) reforms to the recruitment \nmethod  for  SOE  directors,  which  supported  merit-based  appointments  and \nincreased  representation  of  women  on  SOE  boards;  and  (b)  passage  of  the \nEmployment Relations (Budget Amendment) Act 2018, which includes reforms to \nmaternity and family leave policies to enhance the ability of women to remain in \nthe paid workforce and to provide men with parental leave. \nTwo actions in subprogram 2 were changed to more directly support the outputs: \n(a)  the  Ministry  of  Economy  (MOE)  will  not  conduct  a  diagnostic  study  for  the \nmedium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) given that MTEF impediments are \nunderstood at the working level, and instead created new budget templates for use \nby ministries for the FY2020 budget, resulting in more immediate benefits through \nincreased  accuracy  of  forward  estimates,  and  thereby  supporting  an  effective \nMTEF;  and  (b)  regarding  the  competition  and  consumer  policy  framework,  the \ngovernment  will  consult  government  stakeholders  and  the  private  sector  more \nwidely before drafting a new policy framework, which is expected to improve the \nquality  of  draft  legislation  and  its  acceptance  by  the  private  sector.  The  change \ndoes not impact the indicative action for subprogram 3. \nTwo actions have been delayed from subprogram 2 to subprogram 3. Because of \ntheir interrelated nature, the privatization guidelines will come into force with the \nPublic Enterprises Act 2019 during subprogram 3. Action to strengthen regulations \nand processes regarding building permits will now include the streamlining of all \nforms and their access though a new online portal, which will substantially reduce \nthe compliance burden for applicants. \n\nFollowing these changes, the government has completed all 21 actions that form subprogram 2. \n\n                                                \n13 The NDP forms the basis for reforms contained in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). The World Bank policy matrix for \nits  parallel program  contains  seven prior  actions,  of  which three  are  common  to  ADB\u2019s subprogram  2.  The  three \ncommon actions relate to ADB actions 2.1.6 (policy framework for granting government guarantees), 3.1.2 (approved \ninvestment policy statement), and 3.2.1 (regulations under the Personal Property Securities Act 2017). \n\n14 Approved Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Sustained Private Sector-Led \n\nGrowth Reform Program Subprogram 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n15 Further details and reasons for the  changes are summarized  in in Changes from Subprogram 2 Indicative Policy \n\nActions to Final Policy Actions (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fFiscal  management.  The  government  recognizes  that  sound  PFM  systems  and \n14. \nprocesses that  promote fiscal  discipline,  strategic  allocation  of  resources,  and  efficient  service \ndelivery provide the private sector with policy certainty and business confidence as well as more \ncost-effective public services. The following subprogram 2 policy actions support this outcome: \n\n5 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nPublic  financial  management  framework.  Building  on  subprogram  1  reform \nactions, the MOE completed several reforms to improve the PFM framework as \npart  of  subprogram  2  and  has  continued  to  implement  the  Public  Financial \nManagement Improvement Programme, 2016\u20132019 approved in subprogram 1 by \n(a) holding consultations with stakeholders as part of the review of the Financial \nManagement Act 2004;16 the review will strengthen accountability and clarify the \nfinancial  authority  of  the  permanent  secretaries,  a  key  first  step  toward  the \ndevolution  of  decision-making  authority;  and  (b)  improving  the  recording  and \nmonitoring  of  revenue  arrears,  including  preparing  an  aging  debtors  report  with \nrevenue  summaries  published  in  the  FY2019  national  budget  supplement.17  In \naddition,  updated  budget  templates  were  developed  for  use  in  preparing  the \nFY2020  national  budget,18  which  will  help  improve  the  accuracy  of  forward \nestimates.  Improved  national  budgets  will  provide  the  private  sector  with  better \neconomic  data  upon  which  to  base  private  investment  decisions.  Finally,  the \nMinistry of Education, Heritage and the Arts;  the Ministry of Health and Medical \nServices; and the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation (MOWCPA) \nhave participated in an operational plan framework pilot that combines and aligns \nservice delivery, staffing, and corporate planning requirements. \nDebt management. In subprogram 1 the government approved the FY2018 Debt \nManagement Strategy, a rolling debt management strategy to be adjusted with the \ngovernment\u2019s annual financing needs while minimizing financing costs. Ongoing \ncommitment to improved debt management was evidenced in subprogram 2 with \nthe  inclusion  of  the  FY2019  Debt  Management  Strategy  in  the  national  budget \nsupplement, and increased transparency by publishing quarterly debt reports on \nthe  MOE  website,  including  updates  on  domestic  and  external  debt  levels  and \ncontingent liabilities. The strategy includes risk management strategies to maintain \nstable debt servicing costs while considering exchange rate risks, and to maintain \na stable and affordable debt maturity structure to reduce the burden of resettlement \nand minimize exposure. The strategy is key to the government\u2019s medium-term debt \npolicy, which focuses on maintaining debt sustainability by reducing fiscal deficits \nand adopting sound risk management strategies. \nFinancial management. ADB TA enabled the government to commission a review \n(finalized in early 2019) of the financial management information system to assess \nwhether this software is user-friendly and fit-for-purpose. The report was presented \nto  the  Minister  for  Economy  in  May  2019  and  recommends  a  new  system  be \nintroduced. Following the subprogram 1 focus on making payments more efficient, \nthe  government  now  makes  75%  of  payments  digitally,  including  for  private \nbusinesses that supply the government with goods and services. \n\n                                                \n16 Government  of  Fiji.  2016.

Reform progress \nwill  be  assessed  and  the  findings  will  guide  the  updating  of  the  Public  Financial  Management  Improvement \nProgramme, 2016\u20132019. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nSubprogram 3 will build on these reforms through Cabinet approval of the revised Public \n15. \nFinancial  Management  Bill.  Government  public  expenditure  reviews  will  help  evaluate  public \nexpenditure in terms of effectiveness, consistency with priorities, and results; and explore gender-\nresponsive budgeting activities. Following the pilot of the new operational plan framework, it will \nbe implemented by three additional line ministries. The MOE will begin implementing decisions \nfrom  the  financial  management  information  system  review  by  developing  clear  business  and \ntechnical requirements and issuing a public tender. The government will continue  implementing \nelectronic  payments  through  digital  platforms.  ADB  (footnote  9)  and  development  partners\u2014\nincluding  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  Pacific \nFinancial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC)\u2014are supporting these reforms. \n \n16. \nPolicy, legal, and institutional framework for state-owned enterprises and public\u2013\nprivate partnerships. The profitability of Fiji\u2019s SOE portfolio has improved markedly since 2010, \nbut  productivity  remains  low  in  many  SOEs,  and  the  government  is  seeking  to  improve  their \nperformance (para. 4),19 including through SOE divestment, outsourcing, and PPPs to increase \nprivate sector investment, innovation, and expertise. However, progress has been hindered by a \nlack  of  consistent  and  predictable  policies  and  processes. With  ADB  support  (footnote  9),  the \nDepartment  of  Public  Enterprises  has  progressively  implemented  the  following  subprogram  2 \npolicy actions to address these issues:20 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nState-owned enterprises reform. A Public Enterprises Bill 2019 was tabled and \npassed by Parliament, with validation by the Parliament Standing Committee on \nJustice,  Law  and  Human  Rights  for  review  and  consultation,  including  gender \nanalysis.  The  act  is  expected  to  come  into  force  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2019, \nestablishes a clear framework to strengthen SOE governance, transparency, and \naccountability;  and  improve  performance  and  service  delivery.21  Recruitment \nmethods for SOE directors have been improved, including by widening the search \nfor eligible candidates; the percentage of female directors has increased from 8.4% \nin 2017 to 16.4% in 2018.22 To better monitor the fiscal risks associated with SOEs, \na new fiscal risk assessment framework has been approved for use by the MOE, \nand the Cabinet has approved a new policy framework for government guarantees \nfor  SOEs\u2019 \nto  Parliamentary \nauthorization and written guarantee agreements with the government. \nDivestment and public\u2013private partnerships. The government has completed \ntwo  transactions  between  March  2018  and  May  2019,  with  a  concession \nagreement signed for the upgrade and operation of the Lautoka and Ba hospitals, \nand  the  sale  of  the  Government  Printing  and  Stationery  Department.  The  PPP \npolicy approved under subprogram 1 has come into force, and the government has \nappointed  the  International  Finance  Corporation  as  a  transaction  advisor  to \ndevelop a PPP for affordable and climate-resilient housing. \n\nliabilities,  with  guarantees  subject \n\nfinancial \n\n \nSubprogram  3  provides  for  the  Department  of  Public  Enterprises  to  conduct  training \n17. \nprograms on the compliance requirements of the Public Enterprises Act 2019 for 75% of directors \n\n                                                \n19 The portfolio\u2019s average return on equity for 2011\u20132017 was 8.4%, with a return on assets of 3.6%. For 2002\u20132010, \n\nthe average return on equity was \u20130.2% and the return on assets was 0.0%. \n\n20 The Ministry of Public Enterprises merged with the MOE in 2019 and is now the Department of Public Enterprises \n\nwithin the MOE. \n\n21 Among other key features, the bill (i) harmonizes different forms of SOEs under a single framework; (ii) establishes \na framework for the identification, costing, contracting, and financing of community-service obligations that applies \nto  all  SOEs;  (iii)  makes  the  minister  for  public  enterprises  solely  responsible  for  SOEs,  with  clear  duties  and \nresponsibilities; and (iv) strengthens the director appointment processes and directors\u2019 duties and responsibilities. \n22 As of 31 December 2017, 9 of 107 directors were female (8.4%); by 31 December 2018, 20 of 122 directors were \n\nfemale (16.4%). \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nand senior management of SOEs.23 To strengthen financial oversight of SOEs, the government \nwill  develop  and  implement  a  new  policy  framework  for  onlending.  Privatization  guidelines  will \ncome  into force  and  be made  available  to  the  public.  The government will  reform  at  least  one \nmore  SOE  (through  corporatization,  partial  privatization,  divestment,  liquidation,  or  substantial \nrestructuring; or formation of a PPP). It will develop PPP implementation guidelines, including on \nthe  PPP  procurement  process,  and  appoint  transaction  advisors  to  support  potential  PPP \ntransactions. ADB will continue to support these actions (footnote 9). \n \nBusiness and investment climate. Foreign direct investment in Fiji averaged 7.1% of \n18. \nGDP from 2012 to 2017 and is inadequate to support the targeted economic growth rates (para. \n6). This reflects a weak investment climate affected by policy uncertainty, delays in addressing \nunderlying structural constraints, and gaps in the commercial legal framework. The government \nhas introduced progressive structural reforms since 2007 (para. 9), and (supported by ADB and \nother development partners) has taken steps to improve the business and investment climate in \nconsultation with the private sector through the following subprogram 2 policy actions: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  Ministry  of \n\nForeign  investment  and  trade.  To  boost  investor  confidence  and  reduce \nuncertainty  regarding  the  resolution  of  international  commercial  disputes,  the \nInternational Arbitration Act 2017 (which provides for arbitrations seated in Fiji and \nthe enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in Fiji) has come into force.24 To comply \nwith  its  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement  (TFA) \ncommitments, the government has completed four category B commitments.25 In \naddition, \nIndustry,  Trade  and  Tourism  (MITT)  consulted \nstakeholders  on  a  draft  investment  bill,  following  Cabinet  approval  of  the \ninvestment  policy  statement.  Collectively  these  reforms  support  an  improved \nbusiness environment and specifically assist trade across borders. \nAccess to finance. Regulations under the Personal Property Securities Act 2017 \nappoint the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) as the registrar. The act will enable lenders \nto accept movable assets as security for loans more easily, cheaply, and securely. \nThis is of particular benefit to businesses owned by women, who are less likely to \nhave fixed assets, such as land. \nEase  of  doing business. The government  has circulated  draft  bills  to  enhance \nthe  legal  framework  for  trademarks,  designs,  and  patents  for  stakeholder \ncomments,  and  consultations  have  been  held  regarding  the  review  of  the  Fijian \nCompetition and Consumer Commission Act 2010, both of which are fundamental \nfor  private  sector  development  and  entrepreneurship.  A  new  action  under \nsubprogram 2 seeks to make it easier for mothers to enter and remain in the paid \nworkforce. The government has increased paid maternity leave from 84 to 98 days, \nand introduced paternity leave and family care leave through an amendment of the \nEmployment Relations Act 2007, which was passed by Parliament.26 \n\n                                                \n23 A significant improvement over 2017, when less than 25% of directors and senior managers were trained. \n24 International arbitration provides an alternative, cost-effective, and time-efficient means of dispute resolution between \nparties. It is recognized in 160 countries, including Fiji\u2019s major sources of foreign direct investment. Fiji\u2019s International \nArbitration Act 2017 implements Fiji\u2019s treaty obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and \nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, known as the New York Convention, which it acceded to in 2010. Fiji\u2019s chief \njustice has also established high court rules on international arbitration proceedings defining the court\u2019s powers and \nresponsibilities. \n\n25 Category B commitments are provisions that the WTO member will implement after a transitional period following \nthe entry into force of the TFA. The four category B commitments implemented are: Article 6.1 on General Disciplines \non Fees and Charges Imposed on or in Connection with Importation and Exportation; Article 8 on Border Agency \nCooperation; Article 10.6 on Use of Customs Brokers; and Article 12 on Customs Cooperation. \n\n26 To ease the extra cost to businesses related to these changes, the government introduced a 150% tax deduction for \nall businesses for salaries and wages paid to employees during paternity and family care leave. According to ADB. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nUnder Subprogram 3 Cabinet will approve legislation for tabling in Parliament, including \n19. \nbills related to investment, trademarks, designs, and patents. Four additional WTO TFA category \nB commitments will be achieved. The Regulation of Building Permits Act 2017 will come into force, \nmembers will be appointed to the Building Permits Evaluation Committee, regulations will be put \nin place that include standardized forms, and an online information portal will be launched. The \ngovernment will establish the personal property securities registry, which will coincide with coming \ninto force of the Personal Property Securities Act 2017, thus completing the reform. The Cabinet \nwill also approve a new policy framework relating to competition and consumer law. \n \n20. \nGender.  Subprogram  2  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  improves \nwomen\u2019s  access  to  services,  opportunities,  and  decision-making  by:  (i)  including  open \nconsultation  and  gender  analysis  (validated  by  the  Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and \nHuman  Rights)  of  all  legislation  (the  Public  Enterprises  Act  2019,  International  Arbitration  Act \n2017,  and  Personal  Property  Securities  Act  2017);  (ii)  when  reviewing  fiscal  management \nsystems, consulting  with the MOWCPA, and prioritizing the trialing of new planning frameworks \nby  the  MOWCPA  to  aid  with  service  delivery,  staffing,  and  planning  requirements;  (iii) \nstrengthening recruitment methods and merit-based appointments for SOE directors, leading to \nwomen\u2019s increased representation on SOE boards (para. 16(i)); (iv) improving women\u2019s economic \nempowerment and access to finance through the Personal Property Securities Act 2017, which \nenables  lenders  to  more  easily,  cheaply,  and  securely  accept  movable  assets  as  security  for \nloans,  which  will  particularly  benefit  businesses  owned  by  women;  and  (v)  enacting  new \nprovisions  in  Fiji\u2019s  Employment  Relations  Act  2007  to  support  women  in  the  workforce  by \nextending maternity leave and introducing paternity and family leave. \n \nADB engagement. ADB has a long-standing engagement with the government on SOE \n21. \nand business climate reforms. Support for fiscal management and PFM reforms increased during \n2018 and 2019. ADB\u2019s strong relationship with the government has helped ADB play an important \nrole  in  identifying  and  implementing  critical  structural  reforms.  Specifically,  ADB  has  directly \nsupported drafting of policy or legislation on PPPs, SOEs, international arbitration, and personal \nproperty securities; and ADB has provided implementation support. The programmatic approach \nhas  enabled  the  sequencing  of  complex  reforms,  with  ADB  TA  involvement  across  all  reform \nareas in support of all subprograms, aligned with development partners. \n \n22. \nDevelopment partner coordination. The program is part of a multi-development partner \npackage of support for structural reform. It is aligned with the World Bank\u2019s development policy \noperation, also planned for approval in 2019, and the Government of New Zealand\u2019s grants for \n2019 and 2020. The World Bank aligned three of its seven actions to ADB actions (footnote 13), \nand the Government of New Zealand disbursed in August 2019 based on the completion of the \nADB policy actions. ADB is working closely with the World Bank, the governments of Australia \nand New Zealand, and PFTAC to support implementation.27 \n \nC. \n \n23. \nImplementation of the policy actions for the overall reform program will improve the quality \nof budget systems and institutions; improve the productivity and competitiveness of SOEs; and \nhelp create new businesses and formal job growth, including for women.28 Research indicates \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n                                                \n\n2018. Women and Business in the Pacific. Manila,  maternity leave provisions are important for women\u2019s continued \nparticipation in the workforce. Women were recognized to be underrepresented in the Pacific workforce. \n\n27 The IMF confirmed on 9 May 2019 that the Staff Report for the 2018 Article IV Consultation (footnote 8) may serve \nas the International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n28 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f9 \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\nthat strong budget institutions help improve fiscal balances and public external debt outcomes, \nsupporting  expectations  that  fiscal  management  reforms  will  improve  the  fiscal  balance.29 \nImproving  the  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  framework  for  SOEs  will  strengthen  governance, \ntransparency, and accountability; improve performance and service delivery; reduce contingent \nliabilities;  create  room  for  private  investment;  and  improve  the  reliability,  efficiency,  and \naffordability of public services. Fiji\u2019s business environment reforms are expected to increase its \nease of doing business score from 60.71 in 2017 to at least 64.0 by 2020,30 which would bring Fiji \nclose to the performance of Malta (65.43) and South Africa (66.03) in 2018. An analysis of whether \nbusiness regulatory changes are linked to economic outcomes found that a 10-point improvement \nin the ease of doing business score is linked to a 0.5\u20130.6 increase in new businesses per 1,000 \nworking-age adults.31 When applied to Fiji, this suggests a 3-point improvement in the ease of \ndoing business score can be expected to create about 95\u2013114 additional businesses per year. \nThis  would  create  jobs  and  income-earning  opportunities  and  thereby  help  address  remaining \npoverty and achieve inclusive socioeconomic development. \n \nD. \n \n24. \nThe government has requested a regular loan of $65 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 2.32 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n25. \nParallel collaborative partner cofinancing from the World Bank consists of up to $64 million \nfor subprogram 2, and the Government of New Zealand will provide a grant of $1.7 million (NZ$2.5 \nmillion).33  The  subprogram  2  financing  will  help  meet  the  government\u2019s  total  financing \nrequirements  for  FY2020  and  FY2021,  projected  at  F$1.6  billion.  The  gap  will  be  filled  by \nconcessional project loans and domestic bonds. The program has considered the government\u2019s \nfinancing  needs,  its  ability  to  rebuild  fiscal  buffers  to  respond  to  disasters  triggered  by  natural \nhazards,  the  availability  of  alternative  financing  and  estimated  financial  support  from  other \npartners, and debt sustainability. \n \n\n                                                \n29 E.

Washington, DC: \nIMF. \n\n30 Reforms under the program are expected to improve scores for the following Doing Business topics: (i) getting credit \n(personal  property  securities  reform);  (ii)  enforcing  contracts  (international  arbitration  reform);  (iii)  trading  across \nborders (WTO TFA implementation); and (iv) dealing with construction permits (building permits reform). The name \n\u201cdistance to frontier\u201d was changed to the \u201cease of doing business\u201d in 2019. The process for calculating the score is \nunchanged (World Bank. Doing Business). \n\n31 The analysis of 2003\u20132013 panel data for more than 180 countries used the \u201cdistance to frontier\u201d score (footnote \n30). R. Divanbeigi and R. Ramalho. 2015. Business Regulations and Growth. Policy Research Working Paper. 7299. \nWashington, DC: World Bank. \n\n32 Before its 7 June 2019 FY2020 budget announcement, the government requested that ADB financing be rebalanced \nbetween subprograms 2 and 3, with $10 million brought forward from subprogram 3 to subprogram 2 to reflect revised \nforecasts of financing needs. \n\n33 At the time of approval of the programmatic approach and subprogram 1, the World Bank was expected to provide \ncofinancing of $35 million for subprogram 2. The government requested that the World Bank add its International \nDevelopment Assistance allocation to the operation. The Government of New Zealand is a new cofinancing partner. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n26. \nThe implementation period for subprogram 2 is March 2018\u2013March 2020, which covers \nthe preparation and completion of the policy actions for subprogram 2 that was carried out from \nMarch 2018 to May 2019. The corresponding period for subprogram 3 is expected to be from May \n2019 to March 2020. The MOE will continue to be the executing agency for subprogram 2. The \nMOE  has  taken  the  lead  in  coordinating  subprogram  2  action  implementation,  engaging  in \nprogress meetings with the MITT and the RBF as implementing agencies, and providing updates \nto ADB. The MOE has also actively coordinated policy dialogue and needed technical support for \nthe  program  reforms  with  partners,  including  ADB,  the  governments  of  Australia  and  New \nZealand, IMF\u2019s PFTAC, and the World Bank. Proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).34 \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n27. \nFollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), subprogram 2 is classified category \nC for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Program activities will \nbe  confined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  No  activity  will  result  in  or  lead  to  involuntary \nresettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. \n \nThe program is expected to have positive social outcomes (para. 23). The public sector is \n28. \na  key  provider  of  infrastructure  and  services  to  low-income  households.  Improved  fiscal \nmanagement  will  help  ensure  that  the  government  has  the  resources  to  respond  to  economic \nshocks and disasters triggered by natural hazards (which tend to have an adverse effect on the \npoor) while maintaining critical public services. Improving policies and institutions for SOE reforms \nand  private  sector  participation  will  increase  competition  and  make  basic  goods  and  services \nmore affordable, while creating more jobs and opportunities in Fiji. The government also agreed \nto comply with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements. \n \n29. \nRisks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35 PFM systems are assessed as capable \nof supporting reliable service provision. Policy reforms and TA support will address other fiduciary \nrisks. The  overall  risk  of  the  operation  is  moderate. To mitigate  risks, the  program focuses  on \nareas where the government has a strong record, selects options for policy actions in subprogram \n3 that will continue to maintain reform momentum, and facilitates strong coordination with other \ndevelopment partners to ensure timely provision of TA to support implementation. \n \n\nTable 2: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nThe government cannot \nimplement the policy reform \nactions because of inadequate  \ninstitutional capacity. \nProgress and commitment to \nperformance improvements \nand ongoing public enterprise \nreforms are halted or reversed. \n\nMitigation Measures \nThe  FY2018  budget  included  civil  service  reforms,  such  as  an  adjustment  to  civil \nservice  wages,  and  some  improvements  in  retention  are  being  seen.  Technical \nassistance  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners  will  build  capacity  in  the \nministries engaged in the proposed program. \nReforms to further commercialize SOEs will be supported by the government through \nintroduction  of  the  Public  Enterprises  Bill  2019,  supported  by  new  policies  on \ngovernment  guarantees  and  monitoring  of  fiscal  risks  associated  with  SOEs.
