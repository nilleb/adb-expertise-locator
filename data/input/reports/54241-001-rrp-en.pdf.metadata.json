Project identification. India is the world\u2019s third largest electricity producer after the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the United States,1 with an installed capacity of 371.1 gigawatts \n(GW) as of June 2020.2 India\u2019s electricity generation capacity increased by 121.5 GW during fiscal \nyear  (FY)2014\u2013FY2020.  Although  thermal  power  accounts  for  62.2%  of  installed  capacity, \nrenewable energy has been a key driver of growth. India ranks fifth in installed renewable energy \ncapacity globally,3 and added 52 GW of renewable power generation capacity during FY2014\u2013\nFY2020. Despite these achievements in increasing installed capacity, India\u2019s average per capita \nenergy consumption of 1,181 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in FY2019 was estimated to be one-third of \nthe global average. India\u2019s installed renewable energy generation capacity is expected to increase \nto 450 GW by 2030,4 equal to 40% of total generation capacity.5 India has a shorter-term interim \ntarget of adding 175 GW of installed renewable capacity by FY2022, including 100 GW of solar \nand 60 GW of wind energy capacity.6  \n \n4.

APIPL, incorporated in February 2008, develops grid-connected as well as \nrooftop solar photovoltaic power projects in India. APIPL was one of the early entrants in the solar \npower development sector in India and now has 1,718 megawatts (MW) of operational solar \npower capacity spread across 11 states.7 APIPL\u2019s operational capacity has increased at a \ncompound  annual  growth rate  of  84.8%  from 2 MW  in  FY2009 to  1,718 MW  in  FY2020. \n(Confidential information redacted.) The projects owned and under implementation by APIPL are \nbacked by PPAs with central or state government off-takers, with predefined tariffs.

Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n10.  Impact. The project is aligned with the Government of India\u2019s COVID-19 Response \nStimulus Package for the power sector,13 which aims to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 \npandemic on economic activity. \n \n11.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: continued delivery of renewable \npower to the domestic grid ensured. The ADB assistance will help APIPL sustain the delivery of \n2,870 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year to its off-takers.  \n \n12.  Outputs. The outputs of the project will be: (i) continuity of APIPL operation ensured and \n(ii) gender equality of APIPL\u2019s work environment enhanced. \n \nC.

(Confidential information redacted.) \n \n14.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project, through its support \nfor  sustaining  renewable  energy  operations,  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030: \n(i) operational priority 2: accelerating progress in gender equality; and (ii) operational priority 3: \ntackling  climate  change,  building  disaster  resilience,  and  reinforcing  environmental \nsustainability.14 The project will help boost APIPL\u2019s gender inclusiveness. The project qualifies for \nclimate mitigation as it supports the operations of renewable energy projects, which is an eligible \nactivity  under  the  multilateral  development  banks\u2019  climate  finance  tracking  methodology.15 \nHowever, no direct emission reduction effect can be attributed to the project as the renewable \nenergy generation by APIPL does not increase as a result of this investment. The project is \naligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, which calls for higher \nefficiency and carbon mitigation through power generation from renewable sources.16  \n \n15.  Lessons from previous operations. Previous renewable energy projects have improved \nADB\u2019s understanding of the sector in India and the challenges faced by developers. The two key \nchallenges are construction delays resulting from delays in land acquisition, and delays in receipt \nof payments from DISCOMs during the operations phase. These challenges can be resolved by \nacquiring most of the land required for the project before starting construction of the project, and \nhaving an adequate liquidity buffer so that the developer can provide any short-term liquidity \nsupport  needed  for  its  projects.  The  project  design  acknowledges  lessons  from  previous \nrenewable energy projects. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n16.  (Confidential information redacted.) \n \nE.

ADB\u2019s assistance will add value to APIPL by helping address its short-term liquidity \nconstraints caused by COVID-19\u2014particularly at a time when local commercial banks have \nbecome risk averse17 and have reduced their lending activity.18 ADB\u2019s engagement will thus help \nminimize business disruptions resulting from COVID-19 and enable APIPL, which is an essential \nservices business (expected to contribute to about 1.5% of the government\u2019s national renewable \nenergy generation target by 2022 19), to continue its operations and deliver a reliable supply of \nclean  power  to  the  domestic  grid  during  the  crisis.  The  project  will  also  complement  the \ngovernment\u2019s $12.3 billion financial package to provide liquidity to DISCOMs to enable them to \npartly clear their payment obligations. Adoption of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) by \nAPIPL and consequent ADB oversight will further strengthen APIPL\u2019s environmental and social \n(E&S) standards. The ADB assistance also incorporates meaningful gender elements that will \nstrengthen the gender inclusiveness of APIPL\u2019s operations.  \n \nC.  Risks \n \n21.

APIPL commits to implement measures to promote gender \nequality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender \nand Development (1998). These measures include (i) an increase in the number of female \ntechnical staff members, and (ii) women\u2019s networking events either virtually or in-person for \nwomen staff members including an external speaker or skills development opportunity.
