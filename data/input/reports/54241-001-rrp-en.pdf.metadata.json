India  is  the  world\u2019s  third  largest  electricity  producer  after  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the United States,1 with an installed capacity of 371.1 gigawatts \n(GW) as of June 2020.2 India\u2019s electricity generation capacity increased by 121.5 GW during fiscal \nyear  (FY)2014\u2013FY2020.  Although  thermal  power  accounts  for  62.2%  of  installed  capacity, \nrenewable energy has been a key driver of growth. India ranks fifth in installed renewable energy \ncapacity globally,3 and added 52 GW of renewable power generation capacity during FY2014\u2013\nFY2020. Despite these achievements in increasing installed capacity, India\u2019s average per capita \nenergy consumption of 1,181 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in FY2019 was estimated to be one-third of \nthe global average. India\u2019s installed renewable energy generation capacity is expected to increase \nto 450 GW by 2030,4 equal to 40% of total generation capacity.5 India has a shorter-term interim \ntarget of adding 175 GW of installed renewable capacity by FY2022, including 100 GW of solar \nand 60 GW of wind energy capacity.6  \n \n4. \n \n5. \n \n6. \n \n7. \nBorrower.  APIPL,  incorporated  in  February  2008,  develops  grid-connected  as  well  as \nrooftop solar photovoltaic power projects in India. APIPL was one of the early entrants in the solar \npower  development  sector  in  India  and  now  has  1,718  megawatts  (MW)  of  operational  solar \npower  capacity  spread  across  11  states. 7  APIPL\u2019s  operational  capacity  has  increased  at  a \ncompound  annual  growth  rate  of  84.8%  from  2  MW  in  FY2009  to  1,718  MW  in  FY2020. \n(Confidential information redacted.)

(Confidential information redacted.) \n \n14. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project, through its support \nfor  sustaining  renewable  energy  operations,  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030: \n(i) operational priority 2: accelerating progress in gender equality; and (ii) operational priority 3: \ntackling  climate  change,  building  disaster \nreinforcing  environmental \nsustainability.14 The project will help boost APIPL\u2019s gender inclusiveness. The project qualifies for \nclimate mitigation as it supports the operations of renewable energy projects, which is an eligible \nactivity  under  the  multilateral  development  banks\u2019  climate  finance  tracking  methodology. 15 \nHowever, no direct emission reduction effect can be attributed to the project as the renewable \nenergy  generation  by  APIPL  does  not  increase  as  a  result  of  this  investment.  The  project  is \naligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  India,  2018\u20132022,  which  calls  for  higher \nefficiency and carbon mitigation through power generation from renewable sources.16  \n \n15. \nLessons from previous operations. Previous renewable energy projects have improved \nADB\u2019s understanding of the sector in India and the challenges faced by developers. The two key \nchallenges are construction delays resulting from delays in land acquisition, and delays in receipt \nof payments from DISCOMs during the operations phase. These challenges can be resolved by \nacquiring most of the land required for the project before starting construction of the project, and \nhaving  an  adequate  liquidity  buffer  so  that  the  developer  can  provide  any  short-term  liquidity \nsupport  needed  for  its  projects.  The  project  design  acknowledges  lessons  from  previous \nrenewable energy projects. \n \nD. \n \n16. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\n(Confidential information redacted.) \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n(Confidential information redacted.)  \n\nE. \n \n17. \n \nF. \n \n18. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nADB will provide debt financing of up to $22 million in Indian rupee through unsecured and \n19. \nunlisted non-convertible debentures issued by APIPL.

The  project  will  also  complement  the \ngovernment\u2019s $12.3 billion financial package to provide liquidity to DISCOMs to enable them to \npartly clear their payment obligations. Adoption of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) by \nAPIPL and consequent ADB oversight will further strengthen APIPL\u2019s environmental and social \n(E&S)  standards.
