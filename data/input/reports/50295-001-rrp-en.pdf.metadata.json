The \nproject  will  enhance  the  institutional  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  to  effectively \nimplement PFM and state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms. \n \nA. \n\nRationale \n\nKey challenges. The RMI faces natural disadvantages, exposure to shocks, and internal \n3. \nbottlenecks that limit growth prospects. It is classified as a fragile and conflict-affected situation \nby  ADB.2 The  RMI  depends heavily  on  external  development  assistance.  A major  challenge  is \nachieving fiscal sustainability when grants under the Compact of Free Association with the United \nStates  expire  in  2023. 3 Weak  management  of  public  finances  and  SOEs  are  critical  factors \nconstraining  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  strengthen  its  fiscal  position,  and  improve  financial \nplanning and resource allocation for sectoral priorities.4 However, the RMI lacks the institutional \ncapacity to effectively implement PFM and SOE reforms. \n \n4. \nWeak public financial management framework. A 2012 public expenditure and financial \naccountability  (PEFA)  assessment  of    the  RMI\u2019s  PFM  framework  highlighted  significant \nweaknesses, 5 including  (i)  budgets  that  are  not  executed  as  planned  across  line  ministries, \nundermining strategic resource allocation; (ii) significant government spending that is not reflected \nin budget documents; (iii)  weak links between planning and budgeting processes; (iv) frequent \nbudget reallocations that further delink policy priorities from sectoral allocations; (v) accounting \nand  reporting  limitations  that  hamper  budget  execution  monitoring;  (vi)  weaknesses  in  tax \nadministration and management;  and (vii) the absence of effective external scrutiny and audit, \nand limited follow-up of audit findings. The absence of a dedicated MOF website makes it difficult \nto effectively communicate PFM reforms to stakeholders (including the public). \n \nA  2016  assessment  further  found  that,  over  the  last  several  years,  the  MOF  has \n5. \nexperienced high turnover and loss of senior staff, and has received diminished support for 4Gov, \ninformation  system  (FMIS). 6  The  report \nthe  Marshall \nrecommended  that  technical  assistance  (TA)  be  mobilized  to  (i)  strengthen  professional \naccounting  capacity; 7  (ii)  improve  human  resource  development,  training,  and  processes  to \naddress staff turnover and vacancies, and low staff morale; and (iii) ensure an FMIS acquisition \nprocess to replace 4Gov that with an appropriate system software solution. \n\nfinancial  management \n\nIslands\u2019 \n\n                                                \n1  The  project  was  prepared  under  Asian  Development  Bank.  2013.

Manila (TA 8581-REG). \n\n2  ADB Fragile Situations Resource Center (http://fragilesituations.adb.org). \n3  Fiscal balances (including grants) show only a small deficit, averaging 1.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) during \nFY2012\u2013FY2016. However, budgetary grants total about a third of GDP; when grants are excluded the fiscal deficit \nover FY2012\u2013FY2016 was almost 31% of GDP. \n\n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n\n5  Government of the Marshall Islands. 2012.

Majuro. \n7  The MOF relies on their external auditor to prepare annual financial statements. Although the financial statements \nhave  received  a  clean  opinion,  they  have  not  met  audit  completion  deadlines  since  2011.  Questionable  costs \nidentified  by  the  auditors  remain  a  concern.  The  most  common  observations  are  the  lack  of  documentation  and \noutstanding reconciliation among various records. ADB has supported the government to improve documentation. \n\n2). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nPublic Financial Management Reform Roadmap. Based on the PEFA, the government \n6. \ndeveloped  the  PFM  Reform  Roadmap  2014\u20132016  consisting  of  30  reform  components.8 The \nRoadmap  calls  for  a  governance  structure  to  guide  reform  implementation,  and  nonsystem \nmeasures  for  strengthening  coordination  and  oversight,  and  capacity  building.  Key  reform \ncomponents  include  enhancing  aid  coordination  for  PFM  reforms,  improving  the  budgeting \nframework, strengthening accounting systems and cash management, augmenting internal and \nexternal audit capacity, upgrading human resources (including payroll systems), promoting better \nfiscal  management,  and  monitoring  SOEs.  The  Roadmap  recognizes  the  importance  of \ncommunication and training in PFM reform for greater transparency and sustainability. \n \n7. \nPublic  financial  management  reform  implementation.  In  December  2015,  following \ngeneral  elections,  the  Roadmap  was  endorsed  by  the  Cabinet.  A  PFM  Reform  Steering \nCommittee chaired by the chief secretary was established in March 2016 to provide high-level \nmanagement.  The  MOF  leads  efforts  to  implement  the  Roadmap.  While  the  authorities  are \ncommitted to reforms, the Roadmap lacks systematic prioritization. Together with high turnover \nof staff and insufficient capacity in the MOF, this has meant that the Roadmap remains a wish list, \nwith  limited  progress  in  implementation.  Senior  MOF  staff  are  overloaded  with  multiple \nresponsibilities.  Lower-level  MOF  staff  are  largely  either  high  school  graduates  or  college \ngraduates with liberal arts backgrounds, with inadequate knowledge of economics or accounting.9 \nUnderstanding  of  the  FMIS  is  weak,  except  among  staff  trained  in  information  technology\u2014\nalthough able to operate 4Gov, they often lack the nonsystems financial knowledge required to \ngenerate appropriate reports. \n \n8. \nInsufficient capacity constrains the ability of the MOF to effectively coordinate Roadmap \nimplementation.  Internal  coordination  on  PFM  issues  among  agencies  such  as  the  MOF,  the \nEconomic Policy Planning and Statistics Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and line ministries \nis weak\u2014agencies outside the MOF have insufficient understanding of their financial  reporting \nresponsibilities, and are often unable to comply with core financial regulations. There is also a \nneed for better development partner coordination. Key partners supporting PFM reforms include \nADB, the World Bank, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC), the European \nUnion,  and the governments  of  Australia and the  United  States.10 The  MOF must  establish  an \neffective coordination mechanism among them to ensure that PFM reform efforts achieve timely \nresults, while avoiding duplication or contradictory advice. \n \n9. \nFiscal burden of state-owned enterprises. The RMI\u2019s SOE sector is one of the weakest \nperformers  in  the  Pacific.11 There  are  11  active  SOEs  involved  in  utilities,  transport,  banking, \ntelecommunication, and hotels. In FY2014, these SOEs represented 17%\u201320% of the total capital \nstock of the country, but contributed only 5.3% to gross domestic product (GDP).12 SOEs provide \na range  of  public  services with non-commercial objectives,  and  receive  significant government \ntransfers and access to discounted debt subsidized to fund their community service obligations \n(CSOs). Annual government transfers to SOEs during FY2004\u2013FY2015 averaged 4.1% of GDP, \nand the gap between commercial loan rates and the concessional rates SOEs paid on their debt \naveraged  more  than  7.7%.  The  negative  rates  of  return  and  high  ongoing  government \ncontributions  pose  a  fiscal  burden  that  diverts  money  from  much-needed  social  services. \n                                                \n8  Government of the Marshall Islands. 2014.

Finding  Balance:  Benchmarking  the  Performance  of  State-Owned  Enterprises  in  Island  Countries. \n\n12 The RMI\u2019s overall SOE portfolio generated losses each year from 2002 to 2014, with an average return on assets of \n\n\u20135.0% and return on equity of \u201311.1%. \n\n\f3 \n\nStemming the requirement for substantial fiscal transfers to SOEs is a critical part of overall PFM \nreforms. However, because the costs of delivering legitimate CSOs has not been estimated, the \ngovernment is unable to determine whether the subsidies to SOEs are funding CSOs or covering \ninefficiencies.  The  absence  of  a  centralized  monitoring  unit  for  SOEs  within  the  MOF  diffuses \nresponsibility and makes it difficult to enforce fiscal discipline. \n \n10. \nState-Owned  Enterprises  Act  implementation.  The  RMI  adopted  the  State-Owned \nEnterprises Act13 in October 2015 to strengthen corporate governance and monitoring of SOEs, \nwith support from ADB through its Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI).14 The SOE Act \nenables  the  commercialization  of  the  SOEs  and  contains  a  sound  corporate  governance \nframework, but has been weakened somewhat by a 2016 amendment that allows elected officials \nto remain on SOE boards. The PSDI TA is assisting in implementation of the SOE Act, including \nthrough  measures  for  greater  transparency,  accountability,  and  disclosure  among  SOEs. 15 \nAlthough  the  MOF  is  responsible  for  implementing  the  SOE  Act,  capacity  limitations  and \ninsufficient understanding within the MOF of their SOE monitoring role have constrained effective \nimplementation. Line ministries and senior managers from SOEs are also often unable to meet \nthe reporting and accountability requirements under the SOE Act. \n \n11. \nProposed  solutions.  ADB  proposes  to  support  the  government  through  an  Asian \nDevelopment Fund project grant to address the low institutional capacity of the MOF to effectively \nimplement PFM and SOE reforms, as requested by the government in 2016. The project is aligned \nwith a crosscutting theme of the RMI National Strategic Plan 2015\u20132017, of ensuring and applying \ngood governance  principles to  achieve effective governance.16 PFM  and SOE reforms  are two \nstrategic areas under the Plan. The project is consistent with the ADB Pacific Approach 2016\u2013\n2020, which serves as the overall ADB country partnership strategy for the Marshall Islands, and \nsupports the following outcomes: (i) PFM improvements to achieve greater resilience to external \neconomic and financial shocks, and (ii) increased financial efficiency of SOEs to create a more \nconducive environment for business.17 ADB\u2019s approach towards engaging in fragile and conflict-\naffected situations, such as the RMI, recognizes the importance of institutional strengthening and \ncapacity building.18 The project grant is included in ADB\u2019s lending pipeline for 2017.19 The project \nhas been developed in coordination with other development partners (footnote 10). \n \nADB contributions and lessons. This project builds on prior ADB support to the RMI for \n12. \nPFM  and  SOE  reforms.  Through  two  subprograms  under  the  Public  Sector  Program,20 ADB \nassisted the RMI to adopt and implement reform plans to improve the performance of selected \nSOEs,  complete  a  workforce  audit  exercise  for  selected  government  agencies,  and  achieve \nvarious  expenditure  targets.  ADB  regional  TA  has  helped  the  RMI  improve  governance  within \nSOEs  and  develop  SOE  policy  and  legislation  (para.  10).  ADB  has  helped  the  government \ndevelop a financial management model, periodically clear its audit backlogs, and\u2014through the \n                                                \n13 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2015.

TA  has  also  been  provided  to  assess  ways  to  improve  aid  coordination.  ADB \nengagement has demonstrated the importance of taking into account the slow pace of reforms in \nthe RMI, having realistic targets in the design and monitoring framework, and providing on-the-\nground support for development partner coordination (footnote 10). Accordingly, the project has \nbeen designed to provide locally based support and allow flexibility in reform implementation. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe Asian Development Fund project grant will (i) help the MOF to prioritize and implement \nthe  RMI\u2019s  PFM  Reform  Roadmap,  and  (ii)  provide  operational  support  to  SOE  reforms, \ncomplementing  the  policy  and  legislative  support  being  provided  by  the  PSDI.  The  project  is \naligned with the following impact: more effective governance achieved in the Marshall Islands, in \nline with the National Strategic Plan (para. 11). The project outcome will be improved PFM.21 \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n14. \nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  the  MOF\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  implement  the  PFM  Reform \nRoadmap  strengthened,  and  (ii)  the  MOF\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  implement  SOE  reforms \nstrengthened. \n \n15. \nRoad map implementation. To achieve the first output, a reform coordination unit (RCU) \nwill be established, consisting of five long-term individual consultants reporting to the secretary \nfor finance. The RCU will be largely based in Majuro, to enable provision of on-the-ground support. \nThe RCU will strengthen MOF capacity to implement the PFM Reform Roadmap through advice, \ninputs, and training in close coordination with development partners.22 \n \n16. \nThe PFM Reform Roadmap consists of 30 reform components. A key reform is improving \ncoordination of development partner assistance (para. 6). Under the oversight of the secretary, \nthe RCU will prepare a sequenced action plan based on the Roadmap. The action plan will form \nthe  basis  for  identifying  the  specific  reform  actions  to  be  prioritized  and  implemented,  around \nwhich  development  partner  technical  and  financial  assistance  can  be  mobilized.  The  RCU  will \nsupport the secretary to coordinate internally across government agencies, and externally among \npartners. Although the RCU will not directly support all 30 Roadmap reform components, it will \nadvise the MOF to channel development partner support appropriately.23 \n \nThe RCU consultants will directly build MOF capacity to implement reforms under other \n17. \nkey Roadmap components described below, identified in consultation with development partners. \nThey will also help improve PFM data quality through process improvements. Because the reform \nsequence will depend on the action plan to be prepared and the timely availability of development \npartner  assistance,  in  order  to  allow  flexibility,  details  on  the  specific  reform  actions  to  be \nundertaken within various components will be worked out under the project. \n\n \n\n                                                \n21 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n22 The World Bank expects to provide a $5 million grant in 2018 that seeks to replace 4Gov, update related processes, \nand improve procurement systems. Australian Volunteers International will field a short-term consultant in 2017 to \nhelp develop a human resource upgradation plan for the MOF, and the World Bank expects to fund capacity building \ncourses  and  programs  for  MOF  staff.  PFTAC  provides  TA  in  selected  areas  (e.g.,  revenue  forecasting,  national \nincome calculations, and medium-term budgeting), although they have no long-term consultants based in Majuro. \n23 The RCU consultants will take the lead in coordinating reforms in their respective areas of expertise. It is not expected \nthat they will personally undertake all relevant Roadmap reforms, but will seek to achieve results through a mix of \ntheir  own  expertise,  MOF  expertise,  and,  where  available,  supplementary  external  expertise  using  development \npartner resources. \n\n\f5 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nBudget framework. The RCU will support the MOF to introduce a medium-term \nbudgeting  framework,  and  improve  the  link  between  budget  documents  and \ncorporate  and  sector  planning  processes.  The  RCU  will  guide  the  MOF  in \npreparing  better  budget  analyses  and  documentation,  reviewing  existing \noperational  budgetary  processes,  identifying  gaps,  and  recommending  and \nimplementing improvements, thus improving quality of budgetary data. \nAccounting  and  auditing.  The  RCU  will  help  improve  the  application  of \naccounting  principles  in  routine  government  processes,  work  with  the  MOF  and \nline  ministries  to  improve  cash  and  asset  management,  and  build  a  system  to \nperform a daily consolidation and reporting of the government\u2019s cash position, all \nof which will improve quality of financial management data. They will recommend \ncore  PFM  functionalities  to  serve  as  minimum  requirements  in  a  potential  new \nFMIS,  and  advise  on  FMIS  guidelines  and  manuals.  They  will  help  the \ngovernment\u2019s  newly  appointed \nimplement  audit \nrecommendations,  review  financial  reports,  and  make  recommendations  as \nnecessary.24 They will also support external audit.  \nHuman resources. The RCU will work with development partners to advise on a \nplan to upgrade the MOF\u2019s human resources, which is slated to be prepared by a \nAustralian Volunteers International (AVI) consultant. The RCU will ensure that the \nplan  contains  appropriate  provisions  for  training,  recruitment,  and  promotion  of \nqualified  women.  The  RCU  will  work  to  implement  the  plan,  coordinate \ndevelopment  partner  support  to  prepare  job  descriptions,  fund  suitable  training \nprograms and courses, and strengthen performance management. The RCU will \nadvise on payroll management, and the development and implementation of a new \nhuman resource management information system. \n\ninternal  auditor \n\nto \n\n \n18. \nThe  RCU  will  organize  at  least  three  structured  training  sessions  per  year  for  MOF \nemployees to strengthen skills required to perform day-to-day PFM functions; the sessions will be \nidentified in the RCU\u2019s annual work plans (para. 25). The RCU will also work closely with the MOF \nand line ministries (through functional hands-on training) to build their capacity to undertake core \nPFM  tasks  under  their  areas  of  expertise. The  RCU  will  support  implementation  of the  human \nresources upgradation plan, and mobilize partner funding for formal training courses (footnote 9). \n \n19. \nState-owned enterprise reform implementation. Under the second output, the MOF\u2019s \ncapacity to identify, assess the cost of, and monitor legitimate CSOs will be enhanced. The project \ngrant will support the appointment of two SOE reform experts, who will work closely with the PSDI \nand be part of the RCU for the duration of their recruitment. One expert will help identify legitimate \nCSOs and assess their costs, with a focus on those SOEs that receive the largest government \nsubsidies. 25 This will allow the government to evaluate whether subsidies are funding legitimate \nCSOs  or  SOE  inefficiencies,  which  will  be  the first step towards  reforming  inefficient  SOEs  by \nstreamlining subsidies to match public service delivery costs. A second expert will help establish \nan SOE monitoring unit within the MOF, drawing on existing MOF staff. The expert will help build \ncapacity within the unit to monitor SOE performance and ensure the government gets value-for-\nmoney  from  its  fiscal  support  to  SOEs.  Limiting  SOE  subsidies  to  CSOs  will  strengthen  the \ndiscipline on SOEs, help equalize competition with commercially viable businesses, and improve \nthe environment for private sector growth.26 \n\n                                                \n24 The MOF has recruited an internal auditor in 2017. \n25 Five  SOEs accounted  for 83%  of  all  government subsidies  to  SOEs during  FY2004\u2013FY2015:  the  Kwajalein  Atoll \nJoint  Utility  Resources,  the  Tobolar  Copra  Processing  Authority,  the  Marshall  Islands  Shipping  Corporation,  Air \nMarshall Islands, and the Marshalls Energy Company. \n\n26 The  International  Monetary  Fund  has  also  highlighted  that  clarifying  SOE  CSOs  and  establishing  a  centralized \n\n\f6 \n\nD. \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n20. \nThe total cost of the project is estimated to be $2.3 million (Table 1).

The government will provide counterpart support in \nthe form  of  staff time,  office  space and  supplies,  taxes and duties,  secretarial  assistance,  and \nother  in-kind  contributions  estimated  at  $0.3  million  (Table  2).  The  project  will  act  to  improve \ndevelopment  partner  coordination,  as  the  RCU  (once  established)  can  help  to  channel \ndevelopment  funds  towards  appropriate  PFM  activities  and  coordinate  with  parallel  financed \ninitiatives.  Therefore,  although  there  is  no  immediate  partner  cofinancing,  parallel  financing  is \nexpected to be mobilized during project implementation (footnote 22). \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \n     Special Funds (Asian Development Fund) resources (grant) \nGovernment of the Marshall Islands (in-kind contributions) \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nAmount ($) \n\nShare of Total (%) \n\n \n\n2,000,000 \n300,000 \n2,300,000 \n\n \n87.0 \n13.0 \n100.0 \n\n22. \nThe MOF will be the executing agency, and the RCU (once established) the implementing \nagency.

The  RCU  will  be  required  to  submit  biannual  progress  reports \n(including on gender actions) against their work plans to the MOF for their performance review. \nEvaluation  of  their  performance  will  also  consider  the  findings  of  assessments  by  ADB  and \ndevelopment  partners.31 The  RCU  will  provide  biannual  updates  to  the  PFM  Reform  Steering \nCommittee on reform progress and outstanding issues requiring high-level intervention. \n \n26. \nCapacity  will  be  built  within  the  government  to  implement  Roadmap  and  SOE  reforms, \nwhich will help to sustain reforms (para. 18). The two national RCU consultants can potentially be \nabsorbed within the MOF at the end of the project. However, given the shortage of qualified staff \nin the RMI, it is possible that further support in the form of an RCU will be needed. If the project \nis judged to be performing well, ADB will make efforts to involve development partners in funding \nthe RCU. Additional financing by ADB may also be considered. \n                                                \n29 The MOF requested two financial management specialists with expertise in accounting, as capacity in this field is \nparticularly weak. This is in line with external analysis (para. 5). The human resource assessment undertaken under \nproject preparatory TA confirmed that, of 78 MOF staff in position in June 2017, only 4 had university degrees in \naccounting. The MOF, unusually, often relies on external auditors to prepare annual financial statements. \n\n30 The remuneration of the national consultants will be benchmarked to the MOF salary scales, taking into account their \n\nexperience and qualifications.  \n\n31 This includes ADB\u2019s country performance assessments for the Marshall Islands and the next PEFA study. \n\n\f8 \n\nADB will continue close coordination with development partners to ensure that respective \n27. \nreform efforts are complementary. The World Bank is also expected to provide support for RMI \nPFM  activities,  with  an  initial  focus  on  the  FMIS  and  reporting  processes  (footnote  22).  Once \nestablished  and  functional,  the  RCU  can  provide  advice  and  inputs  on  adoption  of  the  most \nappropriate FMIS solution, and help to identify and implement the core nonsystems improvements \nneeded  to  ensure  a  timely,  user-friendly  replacement  for  4Gov.  PFTAC  is  also  assisting  the \ngovernment to develop a medium-term fiscal framework. The RCU can work with PFTAC to build \nthe  MOF\u2019s  capacity  to  undertake  fiscal  work,  providing  continuity  to  the  intermittent  PFTAC \nsupport  from  experts  who  visit  Majuro  periodically.  The  RCU  human  resource  specialist  will \ncoordinate with the AVI consultant to support the development and implementation of a plan to \nupgrade the MOF\u2019s human resources, and help mobilize partner support to fund formal training \nprograms to strengthen MOF capacity. \n \n\nII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe project is expected to generate substantial economic benefits.32 Direct benefits will \n28. \ncome from a reduction in SOE subsidies\u2014CSOs will be identified and their costs determined, and \nfinancing  for  SOE  inefficiencies  reduced.  Scope  exists  to  reduce  the  fiscal  burden  of  SOE \nsubsidies, which totaled 6.4% of the RMI GDP in FY2015, significantly higher than in comparator \nNorth  Pacific  economies. 33 Under  a  conservative  scenario,  if  SOE  subsidies  in  the  RMI  are \ngradually  reduced  to  5.9%  of  GDP  by  FY2020  and  maintained  until  FY2022  through  reforms, \nproject  benefits  can  reach  $5.1  million.  The  project-related  benefit-to-cost  ratio  is  estimated  at \n2.2:1.0.  This  excludes  other  efficiency  gains  in  government  expenditure  through  PFM \nimprovements  that  are  more  difficult  to  quantify.  The  project  is  thus  considered  economically \nbeneficial, particularly given potentially large second-order effects on broader economic growth \nand social welfare from improvements in the quality and efficiency of public expenditure. Ensuring \nreforms are sustainable may require further development partner assistance after project closure \n(para. 26). \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n29. \nFinancial management. A project financial management assessment was prepared for \nthe  MOF,  which  indicated  that  the  overall  pre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  was \nsubstantial. Various weaknesses were identified that could affect project implementation (para. \n4). Once the RCU is established, qualified consultants will work closely with the MOF to implement \nPFM reforms and provide institutional support to the MOF, thus helping to mitigate inherent risks. \nTo mitigate control risks, ADB will generally pay international consultants using direct payment \nprocedures. The RCU will prepare invoices and withdrawal applications for MOF review prior to \nADB endorsement. An advance account will be set up, and administered by the MOF with RCU \nassistance. The advance account ceiling will not exceed $100,000, and will generally be used for \nsmall  payments  (e.g.,  training  materials,  workshops,  project  operational  expenses,  and \nremuneration of national consultants). The MOF will cause detailed consolidated project financial \nstatements to be audited by an independent auditor acceptable to ADB, and in accordance with \nInternational Standards on Auditing and the government\u2019s audit regulations. The audited project \nfinancial statements together with the auditors\u2019 opinion will be submitted to ADB within 6 months \nof  the  end  of the fiscal  year  by  the  MOF. With  these mitigation  measures  in  place, the  project \nfinancial management inherent and control risks are assessed to be moderate. \n\n                                                \n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 SOE subsidies average only 0.4% of GDP in the Federated States of Micronesia, and 0.8% of GDP in Palau. \n\n\f9 \n\nProcurement.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  the  MOF  was  undertaken,  and \n30. \nfound substantial overall pre-mitigation procurement risk. The following issues could affect project \nprocurement: (i) weak external aid coordination, (ii) inadequate prior experience with international \nprocurement  of  consultants,  (iii)  absence  of  reliable  data  on  procurement  contracts,  (iv) \ninsufficient  capacity  of  staff  to  carry  out  procurement,  and  (v)  inadequate  documentation  and \nmonitoring on procurement. To mitigate risks, consultant recruitment will be delegated to ADB by \nthe RMI authorities. Further, only individual consultants will be procured under the project, and \ncontracts  are  not  complex  or  high  value.  All  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas  amended from  time to  time). With these mitigation  measures  in  place,  the  project  financial \nmanagement inherent and control risks are assessed to be low. \n \nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n31. \nto, and discussed with, the government. ADB will conduct integrity due diligence for consultants. \nAnticorruption issues will be built into the training sessions provided by the RCU, as appropriate. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n32. \nThe project will contribute to poverty reduction through (i) better PFM systems, which  will \nalign budget  allocations with sectoral  priorities, reduce fiscal  deficits,  and  improve government \ncapacity to deal with external shocks; (ii) increased efficiency of SOEs, which will reduce the fiscal \nburden of transfers, and free resources for development; and (iii) more transparent identification \nand funding of CSOs, which will help the government minimize the costs of inefficiencies, adjust \nsubsidies, and contract out CSOs. Additional development resources will enable the government \nto meet the poverty- and access-related objectives in the National Strategic Plan, and improve \nthe quality of education and health care, which currently absorb about half the budget. Greater \nresilience to shocks will benefit the poor.34 \n \nThe  project  is  classified  as  having  some  gender  elements  as  it  promotes  women\u2019s \n33. \nempowerment through targets for women\u2019s participation in project training activities and in MOF \nmanagement  positions.  Of  78  staff  working  in  the  MOF  as  of  June  2017,  39.7%  are  women. \nHowever, women are underrepresented in MOF management, with only 3 women (including the \nsecretary) among the 16 occupied management positions (secretary, assistant secretary, division \nand/or section head) in the Majuro and Ebeye finance offices. The RCU will work with the AVI \nconsultant on a plan to upgrade the MOF\u2019s human resources, and propose positive discrimination \nmeasures in recruitment and promotions to be discussed with the Public Services Commission \n(para. 17). The MOF is committed to raising the proportion of women in management above the \nbaseline, subject to qualifications. In the hiring of RCU consultants, the project will encourage the \nselection of qualified women. The RCU will be tasked with ensuring and monitoring that women \nmake up at least 35% of trainees in training sessions they organize for the MOF and relevant line \nministries and/or agencies (para. 18). Biannual progress reports prepared by the RCU will include \ngender-disaggregated data and report on gender actions. \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n34. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory C for the environment, indigenous peoples, and involuntary resettlement, because the \nproject proposes only advisory inputs.35 No civil works are planned, and there is no potential for \n                                                \n34 The National Strategic Plan themes include empowering people and communities to reduce the incidence of \u201caccess \nrelated\u201d poverty through social, economic environment, governance, and infrastructure improvements, and provision \nof necessary services to outer island residents to enable all RMI citizens to enjoy a high quality of life. \n\n35 ADB.

The  dominant \npopulation of the RMI is indigenous to the islands, and project activities are designed for the entire \neconomy,  with  no  differentiation  in  benefits  accruing  to  any  group.  In the  absence  of  any  civil \nworks, there will be no environmental impacts. \n \nE. \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\n35. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.36 \n \n\nKey Processing Issues \nExternal shocks divert \npolitical and administrative \nattention and capacity \naway from reforms. \nNon-availability of good \nconsultants on time for the \nRCU undermines reform \nefforts. \nLack of or delays in partner \nTA delivery impede reform \nimplementation. \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nProposed Approaches and/or Mitigation Measures \nThe project supports the government to build fiscal resilience. However, large \nexternal shocks can disrupt reforms. ADB will respond in a timely manner and in \ncoordination with partners to government requests for assistance if unforeseen \nevents occur. \nThe government has delegated consultant selection to ADB, and suitable \ncandidates with appropriate experience will be encouraged to apply for RCU \npositions. RCU remuneration under the project will be set to attract good quality \nconsultants. Advance contracting will be undertaken. \nTimely TA from development partners is critical to support the government in \nreform identification, design, and implementation. Regular TA coordination \nmeetings will be organized through the RCU to mobilize and deploy resources. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; RCU = reform coordination unit; TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n36. \nThe government and the MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and draft grant agreement. \n \n37. \nwhich are set forth in the draft grant agreement.  \n \n\nThe government and the MOF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \n\nIV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n38. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the grant not exceeding \n$2,000,000 to the Republic of the Marshall Islands from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian \nDevelopment Fund) for the Public Financial Management Project, on terms and conditions that \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n\n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n21 September 2017 \n\n                                                \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n\nMore effective governance achieveda \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \n\n \n\nPublic financial \nmanagement \nimproved \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nPerformance Indicators with \nTargets and Baselines \n\nBy the end of 2021: \na.
