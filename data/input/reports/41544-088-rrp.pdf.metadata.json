It  will  provide  budget  support  to  implement reforms to  (i) \nincrease and diversify financial products and services that better mobilize domestic savings; (ii) \nincrease  efficient  private  sector  participation  in  physical  and  social  infrastructure;  (iii)  diversify \nexports  and  export  markets,  and  foreign  direct  investment;  and  (iv)  increase  the  transparency \nand  efficiency  of  public  procurement,  and  reduce  the  costs  of  doing  business. 2  The \nprogrammatic approach will comprise three subprograms to be implemented during 2015\u20132018. \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n \n3. \nSince  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  made  significant \nprogress in adopting market-based reforms, with private sector development as the key engine \nof  growth.  Nonetheless,  growth  has  occurred  largely  from  natural  resource  exploitation  and \nremittances-backed  private  consumption.  To  stabilize  economic  growth,  the  government  plans \nto  diversify  the  economy.  The  National  Sustainable  Development  Strategy,  2013\u20132017  of  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  aims  to  (i)  create  an  environment  conducive  for  domestic  and  foreign \ninvestment that will increase domestic productive capabilities and create jobs, and (ii) improve \nthe  efficiency  of  public  sector  management  and  administration  and  the  employability  of  the \ncountry\u2019s human capital.3  \n \n4. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  the  government  to  address \ndevelopment constraints on business regulation, access to finance, workers\u2019 skills development, \nand  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs). 4  From  2008  to  2014,  the  first  ICIP  and  attached \ntechnical assistance helped reduce the costs of doing business by eliminating 75% of business \nlicenses  required,  implementing  a  one-stop  shop  business  registration  system,  and  creating  a \nsingle  window  for  pre-customs  clearance.  Access  to finance,  particularly  through  leasing,  was \nimproved  through  enabling  legislation.  The  average  volume  of  leasing  transactions  increased \nfrom $2.3 million per year during 2008\u20132011 to $10.0 million during 2012\u20132013.5 The enabling \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided program preparatory technical assistance for the Second Investment \n\nClimate Improvement Program (TA 8721-KGZ). \n\n3   Government of  the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013.

(In \naddition,  on  18  March  2015  the  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  approved  the  Private  Sector  Development \nProgram for 2015\u20132017 [Government Resolution No. 129]). \n\n4  ADB. 2008.

Kyrgyz  Republic:  Investment  Climate  Improvement  Program  (Project  Number: \n\n941544-022,41544-082,41544-084; Grant Numbers: 0120-KGZ (SF), 0319-KGZ (SF),0393-KGZ (SF). Manila. \n\n\finternational  benchmarks);  clearly  defined  coordination, \n\nenvironment  for  PPPs  was  strengthened.6 Improvements  include  the  PPP  law  (largely  in  line \nwith \nrisk  management,  and \ndevelopment  roles  among  the  Ministry  of  Economy  (MOE),  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  line \nministries;  and  project  preparation  support  through  the  Project  Development  Support  Facility \n(PDSF).  Overall,  progress  has  been  made  in  enabling  the  private  sector  to  contribute  more \neffectively to growth. \n \n5. \nDespite the progress made under ADB\u2019s past assistance there are still policy distortions, \nincluding  policy  and  institutional  shortcomings,  and  market  failures  in  five  areas,  constraining \nthe private sector from contributing more effectively to stable and sustainable economic growth.7 \n \n6. \nLimited  access  to  finance  and  financial  services.  The  financial  sector  has  grown \nsteadily,  with  assets,  loans,  and  deposits  all  increasing  faster  than  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP)  since  2011.  However,  a  low  level  of  financial  intermediation  persists,  and  savings \nmobilization is particularly small (financial sector assets were 38% of GDP in 2013).8 Financial \nproducts  are  not  diversified.  Financial  services  and  access  to  finance,  including  long-term \nfinance for  small  and medium-sized  enterprises (SMEs),  are  still  restricted.  High  interest  rates \nand  collateral  requirements  also  make  it  difficult  for  SMEs  to  borrow.  Small  agricultural \nproducers  and  SMEs  owned  and  operated  by  women  are  particularly  disadvantaged  due to  a \nlack  of  (i)  supply  chain  finance  instruments  (e.g.,  warehouse  receipts),  (ii)  an  effective \ncommodities exchange, and (iii) mechanisms to reduce the perceived risk of lending under low \ncollateral conditions. Microfinance organizations, with assets over 6% of GDP, provide one-third \nof the economy\u2019s total credit, but are constrained in their ability to grow due to absence of laws \nthat  allow  deposit-taking  and  related  prudential  regulation.  Regulations  and  laws  expanding \naccess  to  Islamic  banking  services  were  approved  in  2013,  but  a  prudential  regulatory \nframework for Islamic finance does not yet exist.  \n \n7. \nThe  economy  remains  heavily  cash-based,  imposing  large  costs  on  the  day-to-day \ntransactions  of  government,  businesses,  and  consumers.  New  technologies  that  promote \nmobile  financial  services  have  the  potential  to  lower  the  costs  of  providing  financial  services, \nreach  new  customers,  increase  transparency,  and  expand  lending  capacity  by  increasing  the \nvolume  of  money  in  the  formal  financial  system.  A  robust  regulatory  framework  is  required  to \nenable these technologies to be deployed in a structured manner and to enable the industry to \nmake the necessary investments. \n\n \n8. \nNascent  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  development.  The  legal, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  framework  has  been  created  for  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure development, including through PPPs. Strengthening the enabling environment for \nPPPs  under  the  first  ICIP  has  resulted  in  a  pipeline  of  14  projects  at  various  stages  of \npreparation.  However,  operational  knowledge  and  technical  capacity  of  key  government \nministries and agencies that select, develop, coordinate, and promote PPPs needs to be further \nstrengthened.  In  addition,  standardized  PPP  documentation  (e.g.,  concession  agreements) \nneeds  to  be  developed  to  reduce  transaction  costs.  Support  needs  to  continue  to  ensure  that \nprojects  progress  to  the  implementation  stage  and  an  overall  credible  PPP  program  is \ndeveloped, which selects the most viable projects that are anchored in robust public investment \nprogramming  and  are  properly  structured,  complemented  with  pilot  projects  to  develop \n\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2014.

Manila (TA 8688-KGZ). \n\n7  Sector Assessment (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013. Financial Sector Stability Assessment Report. Bishkek. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\foperational  experience.9 The  banking  sector  and  capital  markets  are  not  yet  able  to  provide \nlong-term finance for infrastructure. Government financial support mechanisms (e.g. guarantees, \nviability gap funds, and mechanisms facilitating long-term debt), especially needed in the early \nstages of PPP market development, are in early stages of development.  \n\n \n9. \nUndiversified  trade  and  investment.  Trade  and  investment  remain  undiversified \ndespite generally open policies.10 International trade has become an increasingly important part \nof the economy, with the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s trade-to-GDP ratio rising from 95% in 2005 to over \n143% in 2013. However, exports remain concentrated on a low number of value-added products \nsent to a few destinations.11 This puts exporters at risk when any export markets experience an \neconomic  downturn,  as  is  currently  happening  in  the  region.12 The  country  is  open  to  foreign \ndirect investment (FDI), but FDI is forthcoming mostly for capital-intensive, extractive industries \nlike  mining  and  energy,  and  from  a  limited  number  of  investors.13 Therefore,  FDI  has  minimal \nlinkages with the local economy and generates limited employment. Investment-related disputes \nare inevitable in any country, but repeated renegotiation of contractual obligations has occurred \non one major mining operation. This carries serious reputational risks, undermining other efforts \nto promote investment.14  \n \n10. \nIndustry\u2013labor  market  skills  mismatch.  The  curricula  and  training  being  provided \nunder the general education and technical and vocational education systems are not compatible \nwith  the  current  and  future  needs  of  the  labor  market.  As  a  result,  there  is  an  oversupply  of \nunskilled workers and professionals with law, economics, and management degrees, and there \nis  a  shortage  of  graduates  in  scientific,  technical,  and  engineering  fields,  and  of  workers \nqualified for mid-level positions requiring technical and other industry-specific skills.  \n\n \n\n11.  Weak governance. Lack of transparency and real and perceived corruption continue to \nadversely affect the investment climate. The country\u2019s corruption perception index is ranked 136 \nout  of  175  countries,  improved  from  154  in  2013.15 Progress  is  being  made,  but  challenges \nremain.  A reduction from  370  to  98  in  the  number  of  activities requiring  licenses, tax  payment \nautomation, and risk-based business inspections (all introduced under the first ICIP) has helped \nreduce corruption. E-procurement, which accounted for about 5% of GDP and about 20% of the \nbudget in 2014, can increase transparency and reduce corruption.  \n\n \n12. \nGovernment  efforts  and  development  coordination.  The  government  has  been \nproviding subsidies through six commercial banks to facilitate lending to the agricultural sector \nat  lower  interest  rates.16 In  addition,  the  State  Economic  Development  Fund  provides  direct \n                                                \n9   Although  the  PPP  program needs  to  be  accelerated, even  in  countries  with  the  most developed  PPP markets,  it \n\ntook 3 to 7 years after a government decision to pursue PPP for the first PPP contracts to be awarded. \n\n \n\n10 World Trade Organization. 2013. Trade Policy Review: Kyrgyz Republic. \n11 World Bank. Trade (% of GDP). http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS (accessed 08 May 2015).  \n12 Switzerland, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, the United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan account for over 80% \nof all exports.  Exports are concentrated in gold (the Kumtor Gold Company alone accounted for 7.4% of GDP in \n2014 and for over 40% of total exports), minerals, textiles, and agriculture products, with little value added. \n\n13  The  Foreign  Direct  Investment  Regulatory  Restrictiveness  Index  places  the  country  roughly  in  line  with  the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. OECD. 2013. Promoting Investments \nand Job Creation in Central Asia through Business Linkage Programs. Paris.  The  majority  of  FDI  in  2014  (88%), \nas  in  2013,  was  in  extractive  industries.  FDI  in  the  first  9  months  of  2014  fell  by  35.4%  compared  to  the  same \nperiod  in  2013  due  to  the  falling  prices  of  oil  and  gold  and  the  strengthening  of  the  US  dollar.  This  adversely \naffected Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation, the main investors in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n\n14  The terms of operation of the Kumtor Gold mine (accounting for 7.4% of GDP in 2014) are still under renegotiation. \n\nAlso see List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n15 Transparency International. 2014. http://www.transparency.org/country#KGZ. \n16  According to the State Economic Development Fund, these subsidies amounted to about $9 million in 2013.  \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nloans to selected commercial banks for on-lending to agriculture. The Fund is also considering \nadditional financial support to existing loan guarantee schemes. An interagency task force has \nbeen set up to explore warehouse receipt financing.17 The strategic move to increase the share \nof  noncash  payments  and  settlements  from  paper-based  to  electronic  financial  payments  is \nbeing  supported  at  the  highest  levels  of  government.  The  Pensioner  Card  allows  pension \npayments to be transferred  to  a  bank  account,  with  reduced  banking fees for accessing these \nfunds.18 The  State  Benefits  Program  enables  benefits  to  be  transferred  directly  to  the  bank \naccounts  of  recipients,  with  withdrawal  enabled  through  debit  cards.  An  initiative  for  payroll \ncards  for  public  sector  employees  has  also  been  implemented.19 Given  the  opportunities  and \nchallenges  of  joining  the  Eurasian  Economic  Union  (EEU),  the  government  is  also  pursuing \nother markets and other sources of foreign capital, including through hosting visits and leading \ntrade  and  investment  missions  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  the  European  Union  (EU), \nand North and Southeast Asia.20  The recently approved Private Sector Development Program \n(footnote 3) will help simplify and automate trade and customs procedures, and rationalize the \nincentive system for investors. Amendments made to the Law on Investment in February 2015 \nprotect  investors  from  arbitrary  changes  in  their  contracts  and  enables  the  government  and \nforeign investors to negotiate contracts directly and expeditiously. \n \n13. \nThe  government\u2019s  efforts  to  remove  constraints  to  growth  are  supported  by  various \ndevelopment  partners. 21 The  International  Monetary  Fund\u2019s  Extended  Credit  Facility  (2011\u2013\n2014)  supported  efforts  to  consolidate  the  country\u2019s  fiscal  position  and  develop  the  financial \nsector. The credit facility approved in April 2015 will support fiscal sustainability and reforms to \nboost  the  economy\u2019s  potential.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Development  Policy  Operations  1  and  2 \nconcentrated  on  public  finance  management,  corruption,  and  increasing  competitiveness.  The \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  is  working  on  risk-based  inspections,  agricultural  export \npotential,  and  the  investment  policy  framework.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, Japan International Cooperation Agency, European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment,  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  and  GIZ,  and  the  Swiss  State \nSecretariat for Economic Affairs also support various aspects of private sector development. \n\n \n14. \nReform program and budget support. Through the Second ICIP, ADB will continue to \nsupport  the  National  Sustainable Development  Strategy,  2013\u20132017  in removing  development \nconstraints (paras. 6\u201311) detailed in the development policy letter. 22 Reforms listed in the policy \nmatrix  (Appendix  4)  will  facilitate  the  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s  transition  to  a  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment  path.  Budget  support  is  necessary  to  finance  part  of  the  development  financing \nneeds,  particularly  covering  the  period  between  the  introduction  of  reforms  and  the  fiscal \nbenefits resulting from the reforms.23 Although not used as a  determinant  of  the  program  size, \nADB\u2019s  support  is  also  expected  to    help  the  government  finance  the  direct  and  indirect  fiscal \ncosts of implementing and monitoring the reforms. The government has the ability to implement \nthe reforms effectively, demonstrated by its experience under the first ICIP and with the policy-\nbased programs of other development partners. \n \n\n                                                \n17  State-owned Ayil Bank has piloted a few warehouse receipt financing transactions. \n18  This initiative is currently being rolled out and will reach about 191,000 pensioners when complete. \n19  At the end of 2014, 117,000 accounts had been opened and over 21,000 cards had been issued. \n20  The  EEU  is  the  economic  bloc  currently  comprising  Armenia,  Belarus,  Kazakhstan,  and  the  Russian  Federation. \nOn 8 May 2015, the EEU countries signed a series of protocols on the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s accession to the EEU. On \n20 May 2015, these protocols were ratified by the parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n21  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Development Policy Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Justification of Policy-Based Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fProgrammatic  approach.  The Second ICIP is a programmatic approach with a results \n15. \norientation,  with  upstream  reforms  followed  by  downstream  implementation  and  monitoring. \nFour  outputs  will  be  delivered  through  a  package  of  policy  reforms  phased  over  three \nsubprograms. The subprograms are chronologically sequenced to ensure that each subprogram \nbuilds  on  the  satisfactory  performance  of  the  previous  one,  and  that  there  is  flexibility  to \nincorporate  experience  and  changes  in  the  external  environment  in  subsequent  subprograms. \nThe  approach  helps  ensure  that  the  reforms  are  effectively  implemented,  and  not  confined  to \namendments in laws and regulations.24 The policy actions completed under subprogram 1, and \nthe indicative policy actions under subprograms 2 and 3, are in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n16. \nADB\u2019s value additions and lessons. ADB\u2019s long-term partnership with the government \nduring the first ICIP enabled ADB to motivate the government  to undertake reforms that might \nnot have been addressed otherwise. For example, ADB advised the government to avail of the \nGeneralized System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) of the European Union (EU)25 in parallel with \naccession to the EEU, and to fund an annual review of the sovereign rating to help open access \nto international capital markets.26 Lessons from ADB\u2019s PPP advisory experience in Bangladesh, \nIndia, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines has helped shape the country\u2019s PPP program in \nline  with  international  good  practice,  and  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  other  countries  will  also  be \nutilized as appropriate. A key lesson from the first ICIP\u2014that results-based and activity-oriented \npolicy  actions  are  more  likely  to  yield  results  than  process-oriented  actions\u2014has  been \nincorporated into this program (footnote 5). \n\n \n17. \nAlignment  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy.  The  Second  ICIP  is  aligned  with  the  development \npriorities  set  out  in  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017  and  the  Midterm  Review  of \nStrategy  2020,  and  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2015\u20132017.27 Public \nsector  management  to  improve  the  investment  climate  is  an  operational  priority  under  the \ncountry  partnership  strategy.  The  constraints \nto  private  sector  development  are \nmultidimensional and complex, and therefore require a multisector approach (footnote 7). \n \n18. \nAreas  outside  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017.  Although  not  explicitly \ncovered as a sector in the country partnership strategy, the Second ICIP addresses trade and \ninvestment  issues.  Diversifying  trade  and  investment  has  become  imperative  because  the \nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s accession to the EEU is likely to add a considerable layer of uncertainty to its \nmedium-term growth prospects. Accession to the EEU could result in increased trade in goods \nand services (the enlarged EEU market is estimated at 170 million people), more efficient labor \nand capital flows, and a decline in nontariff barriers. However, increasing the current tariff levels, \nto  align  them  with  the  common  external  tariff  of  the  EEU,  could  deter  trade  with  non-EEU \nmember  countries  and  may  have  financial  implications  due  to  tariff  renegotiations  with  World \nTrade Organization members. \n \nB. \n \n19. \nwill be an improved business and investment climate in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n\nThe impact of the Second ICIP will be increased private sector investment.

The  objective  of \nthis output is to increase access to finance and financial services by (i) reducing the costs and \nrisks  of  lending  to  SMEs  and  expanding  the  range  of  lending  products,  including  through  (a) \nrisk-sharing  mechanisms  particularly  for  SMEs  owned  or  managed  by  women, 28 (b)  Islamic \nfinance, (c) climate finance, and (d) the development of a commodities exchange; (ii) developing \nmobile  financial  services;  and  (iii)  strengthening  microfinance  sector  supervision  to  ensure \nsound growth of the sector, including allowing deposit-taking microfinance organizations. \n \n22. \nSubprogram  1  supported  the  (i)  establishment  of  the  enabling  legal  environment  for \nmobile financial services through approval of the law on payment system; (ii) development and \napproval  of  a  strategic  plan  for  the  retail  payment  system,  with  regulatory  and  oversight \nframework;  (iii)  development  and  approval  of  the  draft  concept  for  a  risk-sharing  facility  for \nSMEs  owned  or  managed  by  women  and  a  commodities  exchange  to  support  warehouse \nreceipt  financing;  and  (iv)  development  and  approval  of  the  coordination  mechanism  between \nthe  off-  and  on-site  supervision  departments  of  the  central  bank  to  strengthen  risk-based \nsupervision of the microfinance sector. \n \n23. \nOutput  2:  Comprehensive  public\u2013private  partnership  program  fostered.  The \nobjective  of  this  output  is  to  improve  the  enabling  environment  for  PPPs,  including  through \ngovernment  financial  support  mechanisms,  and  to  build  greater  government  operational \nknowledge and capacity. The legal and regulatory framework will be strengthened, and rigorous \nand  well-documented  project  preparation,  appraisal  and  approval  processes,  and  supporting \ntool kits will be developed. Investment programming and public finance management of PPPs, \ni.e.  fiscal  risk  assessment  and  management,  will  be  supported.  Government  capacity  will  be \nbuilt for each stage of the project development and implementation process through learning by \ndoing on pilot projects. Pilot projects will also help test the robustness of the enabling framework. \n \nSubprogram  1  supported  (i)  the  approval  of  the  government\u2019s  PPP  development \n24. \nprogram, including a capacity-building program, for 2015\u20132020; (ii) the approval of amendments \nto the  PPP  law  to  provide  a more  structured  approach to  procurement;  (iii)  PDSF  start-up,  by \napproving  funds  for  the  pre-feasibility  study  of  a  computer  tomography  (health)  project,  which \nhas  undergone  gateway  reviews  required  by  the  PPP  project  preparation  process;  (iv)  the \napproval of fiscal risk guidelines for PPPs, including guidance on contingent liabilities, to ensure \ntransparent  budgeting  of  PPP  fiscal  costs;  (v)  proposals  for  financial  schemes  to  support  the \ncommercial  viability  of,  and  enable  availability  of  long-term  finance  for,  PPP  projects;  and  (vi) \nthe development of a draft health sector strategy and multiyear investment plan including PPPs \nprioritizing  women\u2019s  projects.  A  comprehensive  website  (ppp.gov.kg)  and  communication  plan \nhave been launched to increase awareness about and credibility of the PPP program. \n \nOutput  3:  Trade  and  investment  diversification  facilitated.  The  objective  of  this \n25. \noutput  is to  help the government  implement the country\u2019s  liberal trade  and  investment  policies \neffectively. This will be done through policy and institutional support, including for the key areas \nidentified  in  the  national  Export  Development  Program:  trade  promotion,  access  to  finance, \n\n                                                \n28  The facility will create synergies with the Development of Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Project (Grant 9170-KGZ).  \n\n\fnational quality infrastructure, and trade facilitation infrastructure.29 Since trade and investment \nfacilitation also requires a service-oriented approach, reforms will also cover conveying market \nintelligence  to  exporters  on  new  markets,  developing  workers\u2019  skills  in  line  with  current  and \nfuture  market  requirements,  and  making  trade  finance  available  to  SMEs.  An  investment \ngrievance  redress  mechanism,  based  on  international  good  practice,  will  be  established.  A \nsovereign  credit  rating  will  be  obtained  to  enable  prospective  lenders  and  investors  to  assess \nand price country risk.30 \n \nSubprogram 1 supported the (i) approval of the national Export Development Program; \n26. \n(ii)  implementation  of the Investment  Promotion Agency (IPA) strategic  plan,  including through \nadequate  staffing,  establishing  the  IPA  website  (in  English  and  Russian)  as  the  primary  and \ncomprehensive  source  of  information  for  potential  foreign  investors,  and  starting  the  customer \nrelationship  management  system  to  manage  information  flow  with  prospective  investors;  (iii) \napproval  of  a  draft  concept  paper  on  the  modernization  of  national  product  quality  assurance \ninfrastructure  for  public  and  private  sector  stakeholder  consultation;31 (iv)  preparation  of  the \nGSP+  application  and  its  submission  to  the  EU;  (v)  preparation  of  a  draft  proposal,  with \norganizational  chart,  operational  plan,  and  budget,  for  establishing  an  EEU  help  desk;  (vi) \nestablishment  of  an  inter-ministerial  working  committee  under  the  Center  for  Judicial \nRepresentation,  with  an  action  plan  and  budget  to  set  up  an  investment  redress  mechanism, \nwhich  will  identify  and  review  prospective  investment  disputes  before  their  escalation  to \nlitigation;  (vii)  designation  of  the  IPA  as  the  MOE  representative  on  the  National  Skills \nDevelopment  Council  of  the  Agency  for  Vocational  Education  to  help  identify  and  develop \nmarket-responsive  vocational  skills  training  and  curriculum,  including  attracting  women  to \ntraditionally male occupations such as engineering and finance;32 and (viii) the engagement of a \nrating agency to start the sovereign rating process.  \n \n27. \nOutput 4: Transparency and efficiency of doing business increased. The objective \nof this output is to increase transparency and reduce corruption in government operations and \nto further reduce the costs of doing business, especially for SMEs. This output will mainstream \ne-procurement in government agencies and enhance the integrated tax administration system. \n \n28. \nSubprogram  1  supported  (i)  start-up  of  key  modules  to  enable  central  government \nagencies to use the full e-procurement system,33 and (ii) approval of the law on amendments to \nthe tax code to reduce the frequency of tax filing for businesses from monthly to quarterly. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  Second  ICIP  is  estimated  to  cost  $63  million  equivalent  for  2015\u20132018,  to  help \nsupport a part of the development financing needs from the perspective of the overall projected \nbudgetary  financing  requirements  of  the  country  (para.  14).  The  development  financing  needs \nare projected at approximately $600 million (2015), $517 million (2016), and $424 million (2017) \n(footnote  23).  The  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $20  million  from  ADB's \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs  \n\n                                                \n29  The  Export  Development  Program  outlines  the  country's  export  strategy  and  specific  courses  of  action  to \n\nimplement it. It also takes into account the implications for the Kyrgyz Republic of joining the EEU. \n\n30  This will catalyze reforms to improve country risk and enable access to international capital markets in the future.  \n31  This  will  help  assess  the  infrastructure  upgrades  and  investments  needed  to  comply  with  product  quality \n(assurance) requirements of the EEU and other possible markets. ADB findings on the existing infrastructure and \ninstitutional capacity to comply with sanitary and phytosanitary standards will be included. \n\n32  The identification and development of market-responsive vocational skills training and curriculum will also leverage \n\nthe Second Vocational Education and Skills Development Project (Loan 2902-KGZ and Grant 0307-KGZ). \n33  ADB. 2012.

Subprogram 2 (with an estimated loan \namount  of  $23  million)  and  subprogram  3  (with  an  estimated  loan  amount  of  $20  million)  are \nsubject to further discussion between ADB and the government. \n \nE. \n \n30.  MOE  is  the  executing  agency.  MOE,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  National  Bank  of  the \nKyrgyz  Republic  are  the  key  implementing  agencies.  The  program  will  be  implemented  from \nJuly  2014  to  October  2018,  with  subprogram  1  implemented  from  July  2014  to  June  2015. \nSubprogram 2 is expected to be implemented from July 2015 to October 2017 and subprogram \n3 from July 2017 to October 2018. The subprogram 1 grant will be provided in a single tranche \nand funds may be withdrawn upon fulfillment of the policy actions (Appendix 4). The subsequent \nsubprograms  will  be  submitted  for  ADB  Board  consideration  upon  completion  of  the  policy \nactions. The proceeds of the grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of \ndisbursement procedures and related requirements for policy-based loans.34 The proceeds will \nbe used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member \ncountries,  excluding  items  included  in  a  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral  and multilateral sources.35 Local  currency generated from the grant  will  be  directed to \nthe government\u2019s bank account to cover a part of the development financing needs for 2015.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE  \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nGrowth is expected to be positive for 2015 but is projected to decline to 1.7%, reflecting \n31. \nrecession in the Russian Federation, sluggish performance in Kazakhstan, and a further decline \nin  gold  production.  The  fiscal  deficit  increased  to  4.3%  of  GDP  in  2014  as  slowing  growth \ncontributed to a shortfall in revenue. The fiscal deficit is projected at around 5.0%\u20138.0% of GDP \nin  2015\u20132016.  Reduced  revenues  will  have  negative  implications  on  sustaining  reforms  to \nensure  a  stable  growth  path.  Remittances,  constituting  about  25%  of  GDP  in  2014,  are \nprojected  to  decline  by  about  15%  in  2015  (having  declined  by  5%-7%  in  the  first  quarter  of \n2015).  The  growing  fiscal  and  current  account  deficits,  along  with  the  already  limited  fiscal \nspace,  will  also  constrain  the  ability  of  the  government  to  mitigate  the  negative  impact  of  any \nadditional external shock. The Second ICIP injection will not result in a surfeit of capital inflows \nand foreign exchange, nor will it undermine the money supply and exchange rate.36    \n \nThe reforms supported by the  Second ICIP entail net negative direct and indirect fiscal \n32. \ncosts  to the government  i.e.,  costs  of adjustment  of  implementing  and  monitoring the reforms. \nHowever, these reforms will, in time, generate a positive fiscal feedback by creating a wider and \nmore  diversified  economic  and  tax  base.  This  improved  tax  base,  combined  with  effective  tax \nadministration,  will  help  generate  increased  revenues  for  the  government.  Key  economic \nbenefits include a more formal economy and an increase in the volume of money in the financial \nsystem  from  increased  use  of  noncash  payments.  Access  to  credit  for  the  private  sector, \nparticularly  SMEs,  will  be  increased,  including  through  risk-sharing  facilities  for  women \n\n                                                \n34 ADB. 1998.

Based  on  the  experiences  of  other  countries,  implementing  the \nrequirements of GSP+ alone could raise substantial additional revenues for the government.37  \n \nB. \n \n33. \nRisks  in  public  finance  management  are  high,  but  reforms  are  advancing  including \nbudget  automation  and  improved  management  information  systems.  Necessary  key  reforms \ninclude  strengthening  of  budget  processes  and  the  link  between  a  medium-term  budget \nframework  and  the  annual  budget,  and  improving  budget  transparency.  Development  of  the \ntreasury  system  in  line  with  international  accounting  standards  is  being  introduced  with \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  support.  High  procurement  and  corruption  risks  are  being \nmitigated through mainstreaming e-procurement in government, supported under the proposed \nprogram.  Automation  of  tax  and  other  services  is  also  helping  to  reduce  rent-seeking \nopportunities.  The  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  is \nhelping  implement  the  government\u2019s  National  Anti-Corruption  Program  and  Action  Plan \n(approved  2012).38 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to \nand discussed with the government and MOE. \n \nC. \n \nAn  improved  business  climate  will  help  create  new  enterprises  and  support  existing \n34. \nbusinesses  to  grow  and  innovate.  This  will  create  more  jobs,  including  for  the  poor  and  rural \nworkers.  Improved  public  infrastructure  and  services,  such  as  for  health,  district  heating,  and \ntransport, will also benefit the poor and vulnerable. The Second ICIP is categorized as effective \ngender  mainstreaming,  since  it  helps  address  some  key  issues  facing  women  in  accessing \nfinance; receiving technical support for business development; and participating in policy, trade, \nand  investment  bodies.  Specific  gender  actions  include  (i)  establishing  a  financial  risk-sharing \nfacility for women-owned or operated SMEs; (ii) ensuring gender balance in the staffing of the \nPPP Unit and the IPA, including gender sensitization training; (iii) prioritizing PPP projects with \npoverty  and  gender  impacts  and  ensuring  social  and  gender  impact  assessments  in  the \nevaluation  of  PPP  projects;  (iv)  developing  market-responsive  courses  and  training,  including \nthose  that  promote  women's  access  to  nontraditional  occupations;  and  (v)  providing  technical \nsupport services to women SMEs to cope with increased export options expected under GSP+.  \n \nD. \n \n35. \nActivities  under  the  Second  ICIP  are  confined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms.
