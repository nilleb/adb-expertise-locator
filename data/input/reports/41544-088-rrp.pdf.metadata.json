THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Second Investment Climate Improvement Program (Second \nICIP), and (ii) a proposed policy-based grant to the Kyrgyz Republic for subprogram 1 of the \nSecond ICIP.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  program  aims  to  create  a  more  attractive  climate  for  private  sector \ndevelopment in the Kyrgyz Republic. It will provide budget support to implement reforms to (i) \nincrease and diversify financial products and services that better mobilize domestic savings; (ii) \nincrease efficient private sector participation in physical and social infrastructure; (iii) diversify \nexports and export markets, and foreign direct investment; and (iv) increase the transparency \nand  efficiency  of  public  procurement,  and  reduce  the  costs  of  doing  business. 2  The \nprogrammatic approach will comprise three subprograms to be implemented during 2015\u20132018. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Since  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  made  significant \nprogress in adopting market-based reforms, with private sector development as the key engine \nof growth. Nonetheless, growth has occurred largely from natural resource exploitation and \nremittances-backed private consumption. To stabilize economic growth, the government plans \nto diversify the economy. The National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013\u20132017 of the \nKyrgyz  Republic  aims  to  (i)  create  an  environment  conducive  for  domestic  and  foreign \ninvestment that will increase domestic productive capabilities and create jobs, and (ii) improve \nthe efficiency of public sector management and administration and the employability of the \ncountry\u2019s human capital.3  \n \n4.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  the  government  to  address \ndevelopment constraints on business regulation, access to finance, workers\u2019 skills development, \nand  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs).4 From  2008  to  2014,  the  first  ICIP  and  attached \ntechnical assistance helped reduce the costs of doing business by eliminating 75% of business \nlicenses required, implementing a one-stop shop business registration system, and creating a \nsingle window for pre-customs clearance. Access to finance, particularly through leasing, was \nimproved through enabling legislation. The average volume of leasing transactions increased \nfrom $2.3 million per year during 2008\u20132011 to $10.0 million during 2012\u20132013.5 The enabling \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided program preparatory technical assistance for the Second Investment \nClimate Improvement Program (TA 8721-KGZ). \n3  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013.

Kyrgyz Republic: Investment Climate Improvement Program (Project Number: \n941544-022,41544-082,41544-084; Grant Numbers: 0120-KGZ (SF), 0319-KGZ (SF),0393-KGZ (SF). Manila. ", "2 \nenvironment for PPPs was strengthened.6 Improvements include the PPP law (largely in line \nwith  international  benchmarks);  clearly  defined  coordination,  risk  management,  and \ndevelopment roles among the Ministry of Economy (MOE), the Ministry of Finance, and line \nministries; and project preparation support through the Project Development Support Facility \n(PDSF). Overall, progress has been made in enabling the private sector to contribute more \neffectively to growth. \n \n5.  Despite the progress made under ADB\u2019s past assistance there are still policy distortions, \nincluding policy and institutional shortcomings, and market failures in five areas, constraining \nthe private sector from contributing more effectively to stable and sustainable economic growth.7 \n \n6.  Limited access to finance and financial services. The financial sector has grown \nsteadily, with assets, loans, and deposits all increasing faster than gross domestic product \n(GDP)  since  2011.  However,  a  low  level  of  financial  intermediation  persists,  and  savings \nmobilization is particularly small (financial sector assets were 38% of GDP in 2013).8 Financial \nproducts  are  not  diversified.  Financial  services  and  access  to  finance,  including  long-term \nfinance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are still restricted. High interest rates \nand  collateral  requirements  also  make  it  difficult  for  SMEs  to  borrow.  Small  agricultural \nproducers and SMEs owned and operated by women are particularly disadvantaged due to a \nlack  of  (i)  supply  chain  finance  instruments  (e.g.,  warehouse  receipts),  (ii)  an  effective \ncommodities exchange, and (iii) mechanisms to reduce the perceived risk of lending under low \ncollateral conditions. Microfinance organizations, with assets over 6% of GDP, provide one-third \nof the economy\u2019s total credit, but are constrained in their ability to grow due to absence of laws \nthat allow deposit-taking and related prudential regulation. Regulations and laws expanding \naccess  to  Islamic  banking  services  were  approved  in  2013,  but  a  prudential  regulatory \nframework for Islamic finance does not yet exist.  \n \n7.  The  economy  remains  heavily  cash-based,  imposing  large  costs  on  the  day-to-day \ntransactions  of  government,  businesses,  and  consumers.  New  technologies  that  promote \nmobile financial services have the potential to lower the costs of providing financial services, \nreach new customers, increase transparency, and expand lending capacity by increasing the \nvolume of money in the formal financial system. A robust regulatory framework is required to \nenable these technologies to be deployed in a structured manner and to enable the industry to \nmake the necessary investments. \n \n8.  Nascent  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  development.  The  legal, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  framework  has  been  created  for  private  sector  participation  in \ninfrastructure development, including through PPPs. Strengthening the enabling environment for \nPPPs  under  the  first  ICIP  has  resulted  in  a  pipeline  of  14  projects  at  various  stages  of \npreparation.  However,  operational  knowledge  and  technical  capacity  of  key  government \nministries and agencies that select, develop, coordinate, and promote PPPs needs to be further \nstrengthened.  In  addition,  standardized  PPP  documentation  (e.g.,  concession  agreements) \nneeds to be developed to reduce transaction costs. Support needs to continue to ensure that \nprojects  progress  to  the  implementation  stage  and  an  overall  credible  PPP  program  is \ndeveloped, which selects the most viable projects that are anchored in robust public investment \nprogramming  and  are  properly  structured,  complemented  with  pilot  projects  to  develop \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2014.

Manila (TA 8688-KGZ). \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013. Financial Sector Stability Assessment Report. Bishkek. \n ", "3 \noperational experience.9 The banking sector and capital markets are not yet able to provide \nlong-term finance for infrastructure. Government financial support mechanisms (e.g. guarantees, \nviability gap funds, and mechanisms facilitating long-term debt), especially needed in the early \nstages of PPP market development, are in early stages of development.  \n \n9.  Undiversified  trade  and  investment.  Trade  and  investment  remain  undiversified \ndespite generally open policies.10 International trade has become an increasingly important part \nof the economy, with the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s trade-to-GDP ratio rising from 95% in 2005 to over \n143% in 2013. However, exports remain concentrated on a low number of value-added products \nsent to a few destinations.11 This puts exporters at risk when any export markets experience an \neconomic downturn, as is currently happening in the region.12 The country is open to foreign \ndirect investment (FDI), but FDI is forthcoming mostly for capital-intensive, extractive industries \nlike mining and energy, and from a limited number of investors.13 Therefore, FDI has minimal \nlinkages with the local economy and generates limited employment. Investment-related disputes \nare inevitable in any country, but repeated renegotiation of contractual obligations has occurred \non one major mining operation. This carries serious reputational risks, undermining other efforts \nto promote investment.14  \n \n10.  Industry\u2013labor  market  skills  mismatch. The curricula and training being provided \nunder the general education and technical and vocational education systems are not compatible \nwith the current and future needs of the labor market. As a result, there is an oversupply of \nunskilled workers and professionals with law, economics, and management degrees, and there \nis  a  shortage  of  graduates  in  scientific,  technical,  and  engineering  fields,  and  of  workers \nqualified for mid-level positions requiring technical and other industry-specific skills.  \n \n11.  Weak governance. Lack of transparency and real and perceived corruption continue to \nadversely affect the investment climate. The country\u2019s corruption perception index is ranked 136 \nout of 175 countries, improved from 154 in 2013.15 Progress is being made, but challenges \nremain. A reduction from 370 to 98 in the number of activities requiring licenses, tax payment \nautomation, and risk-based business inspections (all introduced under the first ICIP) has helped \nreduce corruption. E-procurement, which accounted for about 5% of GDP and about 20% of the \nbudget in 2014, can increase transparency and reduce corruption.  \n \n12.  Government  efforts  and  development  coordination.  The  government  has  been \nproviding subsidies through six commercial banks to facilitate lending to the agricultural sector \nat lower interest rates.16 In addition, the State Economic Development Fund provides direct \n                                                \n9  Although the PPP program needs to be accelerated, even in countries with the most developed PPP markets, it \ntook 3 to 7 years after a government decision to pursue PPP for the first PPP contracts to be awarded. \n10 World Trade Organization. 2013. Trade Policy Review: Kyrgyz Republic.   \n11 World Bank. Trade (% of GDP). http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.TRD.GNFS.ZS (accessed 08 May 2015).  \n12 Switzerland, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, the United Arab Emirates, and Uzbekistan account for over 80% \nof all exports. Exports are concentrated in gold (the Kumtor Gold Company alone accounted for 7.4% of GDP in \n2014 and for over 40% of total exports), minerals, textiles, and agriculture products, with little value added. \n13 The Foreign Direct Investment Regulatory Restrictiveness Index places the country roughly in line with the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average. OECD. 2013. Promoting Investments \nand Job Creation in Central Asia through Business Linkage Programs. Paris.  The majority of FDI in 2014 (88%), \nas in 2013, was in extractive industries. FDI in the first 9 months of 2014 fell by 35.4% compared to the same \nperiod in 2013 due to the falling prices of oil and gold and the strengthening of the US dollar. This adversely \naffected Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation, the main investors in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n14  The terms of operation of the Kumtor Gold mine (accounting for 7.4% of GDP in 2014) are still under renegotiation. \nAlso see List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Transparency International. 2014. http://www.transparency.org/country#KGZ. \n16  According to the State Economic Development Fund, these subsidies amounted to about $9 million in 2013.  \n ", "4 \nloans to selected commercial banks for on-lending to agriculture. The Fund is also considering \nadditional financial support to existing loan guarantee schemes. An interagency task force has \nbeen set up to explore warehouse receipt financing.17 The strategic move to increase the share \nof noncash payments and settlements from paper-based to electronic financial payments is \nbeing supported  at  the  highest  levels  of government. The  Pensioner  Card  allows  pension \npayments to be transferred to a bank account, with reduced banking fees for accessing these \nfunds.18 The State Benefits Program enables benefits to be transferred directly to the bank \naccounts of recipients, with withdrawal enabled through debit cards. An initiative for payroll \ncards for public sector employees has also been implemented.19 Given the opportunities and \nchallenges of joining the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), the government is also pursuing \nother markets and other sources of foreign capital, including through hosting visits and leading \ntrade and investment missions to the People\u2019s Republic of China, the European Union (EU), \nand North and Southeast Asia.20  The recently approved Private Sector Development Program \n(footnote 3) will help simplify and automate trade and customs procedures, and rationalize the \nincentive system for investors. Amendments made to the Law on Investment in February 2015 \nprotect investors from arbitrary changes in their contracts and enables the government and \nforeign investors to negotiate contracts directly and expeditiously. \n \n13.  The government\u2019s efforts to remove constraints to growth are supported by various \ndevelopment partners.21 The International Monetary Fund\u2019s Extended Credit Facility (2011\u2013\n2014) supported efforts to consolidate the country\u2019s fiscal position and develop the financial \nsector. The credit facility approved in April 2015 will support fiscal sustainability and reforms to \nboost the economy\u2019s potential. The World Bank\u2019s Development Policy Operations 1 and 2 \nconcentrated on public finance management, corruption, and increasing competitiveness. The \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  is  working  on  risk-based  inspections,  agricultural  export \npotential, and the investment policy framework. The United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, Japan International Cooperation Agency, European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, German development cooperation through KfW and GIZ, and the Swiss State \nSecretariat for Economic Affairs also support various aspects of private sector development. \n \n14.  Reform program and budget support. Through the Second ICIP, ADB will continue to \nsupport the National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013\u20132017 in removing development \nconstraints (paras. 6\u201311) detailed in the development policy letter. 22 Reforms listed in the policy \nmatrix (Appendix 4) will facilitate the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s transition to a sustainable economic \ndevelopment path. Budget support is necessary to finance part of the development financing \nneeds,  particularly  covering  the  period  between  the  introduction  of  reforms  and  the  fiscal \nbenefits resulting from the reforms.23 Although not used as a determinant of the program size, \nADB\u2019s support is also expected to  help the government finance the direct and indirect fiscal \ncosts of implementing and monitoring the reforms. The government has the ability to implement \nthe reforms effectively, demonstrated by its experience under the first ICIP and with the policy-\nbased programs of other development partners. \n \n                                                \n17  State-owned Ayil Bank has piloted a few warehouse receipt financing transactions. \n18  This initiative is currently being rolled out and will reach about 191,000 pensioners when complete. \n19  At the end of 2014, 117,000 accounts had been opened and over 21,000 cards had been issued. \n20  The EEU is the economic bloc currently comprising Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and the Russian Federation. \nOn 8 May 2015, the EEU countries signed a series of protocols on the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s accession to the EEU. On \n20 May 2015, these protocols were ratified by the parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic. \n21  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Development Policy Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Justification of Policy-Based Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \n15.  Programmatic approach. The Second ICIP is a programmatic approach with a results \norientation, with upstream reforms followed by downstream implementation and monitoring. \nFour  outputs  will  be  delivered  through  a  package  of  policy  reforms  phased  over  three \nsubprograms. The subprograms are chronologically sequenced to ensure that each subprogram \nbuilds  on  the  satisfactory  performance  of  the  previous  one,  and  that  there  is  flexibility  to \nincorporate experience and changes in the external environment in subsequent subprograms. \nThe approach helps ensure that the reforms are effectively implemented, and not confined to \namendments in laws and regulations.24 The policy actions completed under subprogram 1, and \nthe indicative policy actions under subprograms 2 and 3, are in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s value additions and lessons. ADB\u2019s long-term partnership with the government \nduring the first ICIP enabled ADB to motivate the government to undertake reforms that might \nnot have been addressed otherwise. For example, ADB advised the government to avail of the \nGeneralized System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) of the European Union (EU)25 in parallel with \naccession to the EEU, and to fund an annual review of the sovereign rating to help open access \nto international capital markets.26 Lessons from ADB\u2019s PPP advisory experience in Bangladesh, \nIndia, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines has helped shape the country\u2019s PPP program in \nline with international good practice, and ADB\u2019s experience in other countries will also be \nutilized as appropriate. A key lesson from the first ICIP\u2014that results-based and activity-oriented \npolicy  actions  are  more  likely  to  yield  results  than  process-oriented  actions\u2014has  been \nincorporated into this program (footnote 5). \n \n17.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategy. The Second ICIP is aligned with the development \npriorities set out in the country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 and the Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020, and is included in the country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017.27 Public \nsector management to improve the investment climate is an operational priority under the \ncountry  partnership  strategy.  The  constraints  to  private  sector  development  are \nmultidimensional and complex, and therefore require a multisector approach (footnote 7). \n \n18.  Areas outside the country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017. Although not explicitly \ncovered as a sector in the country partnership strategy, the Second ICIP addresses trade and \ninvestment  issues.  Diversifying  trade  and  investment  has  become  imperative  because  the \nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s accession to the EEU is likely to add a considerable layer of uncertainty to its \nmedium-term growth prospects. Accession to the EEU could result in increased trade in goods \nand services (the enlarged EEU market is estimated at 170 million people), more efficient labor \nand capital flows, and a decline in nontariff barriers. However, increasing the current tariff levels, \nto align them with the common external tariff of the EEU, could deter trade with non-EEU \nmember countries and may have financial implications due to tariff renegotiations with World \nTrade Organization members. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n19.  The impact of the Second ICIP will be increased private sector investment. The outcome \nwill be an improved business and investment climate in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n                                                \n24  Programmatic Approach Concept (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  GSP+ is a trade privilege that grants zero or preferential tariffs for over 7,000 products from certain countries, \nincluding the Kyrgyz Republic, which ratify and implement international conventions related to human and labor \nrights, environment, and good governance.  \n26  ADB is also supporting the government to obtain the first sovereign credit rating for the Kyrgyz Republic. \n27  ADB. 2013.

The Second ICIP will deliver four outputs through 21, 30 and 20 policy actions under \nsubprograms 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  \n \n21.  Output 1: Financial deepening and access to finance increased. The objective of \nthis output is to increase access to finance and financial services by (i) reducing the costs and \nrisks of lending to SMEs and expanding the range of lending products, including through (a) \nrisk-sharing mechanisms particularly for SMEs owned or managed by women,28 (b) Islamic \nfinance, (c) climate finance, and (d) the development of a commodities exchange; (ii) developing \nmobile  financial  services;  and  (iii)  strengthening  microfinance  sector  supervision  to  ensure \nsound growth of the sector, including allowing deposit-taking microfinance organizations. \n \n22.  Subprogram 1 supported the (i) establishment of the enabling legal environment for \nmobile financial services through approval of the law on payment system; (ii) development and \napproval  of  a  strategic  plan  for  the  retail  payment  system,  with  regulatory  and  oversight \nframework; (iii) development and approval of the draft concept for a risk-sharing facility for \nSMEs owned or managed by women and a commodities exchange to support warehouse \nreceipt financing; and (iv) development and approval of the coordination mechanism between \nthe  off-  and  on-site  supervision  departments  of  the  central  bank  to  strengthen  risk-based \nsupervision of the microfinance sector. \n \n23.

The \nobjective of this output is to improve the enabling environment for PPPs, including through \ngovernment  financial  support  mechanisms,  and  to  build  greater  government  operational \nknowledge and capacity. The legal and regulatory framework will be strengthened, and rigorous \nand well-documented project preparation, appraisal and approval processes, and supporting \ntool kits will be developed. Investment programming and public finance management of PPPs, \ni.e. fiscal risk assessment and management, will be supported. Government capacity will be \nbuilt for each stage of the project development and implementation process through learning by \ndoing on pilot projects. Pilot projects will also help test the robustness of the enabling framework. \n \n24.  Subprogram  1  supported  (i)  the  approval  of  the  government\u2019s  PPP  development \nprogram, including a capacity-building program, for 2015\u20132020; (ii) the approval of amendments \nto the PPP law to provide a more structured approach to procurement; (iii) PDSF start-up, by \napproving funds for the pre-feasibility study of a computer tomography (health) project, which \nhas undergone gateway reviews required by the PPP project preparation process;  (iv) the \napproval of fiscal risk guidelines for PPPs, including guidance on contingent liabilities, to ensure \ntransparent budgeting of PPP fiscal costs; (v) proposals for financial schemes to support the \ncommercial viability of, and enable availability of long-term finance for, PPP projects; and (vi) \nthe development of a draft health sector strategy and multiyear investment plan including PPPs \nprioritizing women\u2019s projects. A comprehensive website (ppp.gov.kg) and communication plan \nhave been launched to increase awareness about and credibility of the PPP program. \n \n25.  Output  3:  Trade  and  investment  diversification  facilitated. The objective of this \noutput is to help the government implement the country\u2019s liberal trade and investment policies \neffectively. This will be done through policy and institutional support, including for the key areas \nidentified in the national Export Development Program: trade promotion, access to finance, \n                                                \n28  The facility will create synergies with the Development of Women\u2019s Entrepreneurship Project (Grant 9170-KGZ).  \n ", "7 \nnational quality infrastructure, and trade facilitation infrastructure.29 Since trade and investment \nfacilitation also requires a service-oriented approach, reforms will also cover conveying market \nintelligence to exporters on new markets, developing workers\u2019 skills in line with current and \nfuture  market  requirements,  and  making  trade  finance  available  to  SMEs.  An  investment \ngrievance redress mechanism, based on international good practice, will be established. A \nsovereign credit rating will be obtained to enable prospective lenders and investors to assess \nand price country risk.30 \n \n26.  Subprogram 1 supported the (i) approval of the national Export Development Program; \n(ii) implementation of the Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) strategic plan, including through \nadequate staffing, establishing the IPA website (in English and Russian) as the primary and \ncomprehensive source of information for potential foreign investors, and starting the customer \nrelationship management system to manage information flow with prospective investors; (iii) \napproval of a draft concept paper on the modernization of national product quality assurance \ninfrastructure for public and private sector stakeholder consultation;31 (iv) preparation of the \nGSP+  application  and  its  submission  to  the  EU;  (v)  preparation  of  a  draft  proposal,  with \norganizational chart, operational plan, and budget, for establishing an EEU help desk; (vi) \nestablishment  of  an  inter-ministerial  working  committee  under  the  Center  for  Judicial \nRepresentation, with an action plan and budget to set up an investment redress mechanism, \nwhich  will  identify  and  review  prospective  investment  disputes  before  their  escalation  to \nlitigation;  (vii)  designation  of  the  IPA  as  the  MOE  representative  on  the  National  Skills \nDevelopment Council of the Agency for Vocational Education to help identify and develop \nmarket-responsive  vocational  skills  training  and  curriculum,  including  attracting  women  to \ntraditionally male occupations such as engineering and finance;32 and (viii) the engagement of a \nrating agency to start the sovereign rating process.  \n \n27.  Output 4: Transparency and efficiency of doing business increased. The objective \nof this output is to increase transparency and reduce corruption in government operations and \nto further reduce the costs of doing business, especially for SMEs. This output will mainstream \ne-procurement in government agencies and enhance the integrated tax administration system. \n \n28.  Subprogram  1  supported  (i)  start-up  of  key  modules  to  enable  central  government \nagencies to use the full e-procurement system,33 and (ii) approval of the law on amendments to \nthe tax code to reduce the frequency of tax filing for businesses from monthly to quarterly. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs  \n \n29.  The Second ICIP is estimated to cost $63 million equivalent for 2015\u20132018, to help \nsupport a part of the development financing needs from the perspective of the overall projected \nbudgetary financing requirements of the country (para. 14). The development financing needs \nare projected at approximately $600 million (2015), $517 million (2016), and $424 million (2017) \n(footnote 23). The government has requested a grant not exceeding $20 million from ADB's \n                                                \n29  The  Export  Development  Program  outlines  the  country's  export  strategy  and  specific  courses  of  action  to \nimplement it. It also takes into account the implications for the Kyrgyz Republic of joining the EEU. \n30  This will catalyze reforms to improve country risk and enable access to international capital markets in the future.  \n31  This  will  help  assess  the  infrastructure  upgrades  and  investments  needed  to  comply  with  product  quality \n(assurance) requirements of the EEU and other possible markets. ADB findings on the existing infrastructure and \ninstitutional capacity to comply with sanitary and phytosanitary standards will be included. \n32  The identification and development of market-responsive vocational skills training and curriculum will also leverage \nthe Second Vocational Education and Skills Development Project (Loan 2902-KGZ and Grant 0307-KGZ). \n33  ADB. 2012.

Subprogram 2 (with an estimated loan \namount of $23 million) and subprogram 3 (with an estimated loan amount of $20 million) are \nsubject to further discussion between ADB and the government. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  MOE is the executing agency. MOE, Ministry of Finance and National Bank of the \nKyrgyz Republic are the key implementing agencies. The program will be implemented from \nJuly 2014 to October 2018, with subprogram 1 implemented from July 2014 to June 2015. \nSubprogram 2 is expected to be implemented from July 2015 to October 2017 and subprogram \n3 from July 2017 to October 2018. The subprogram 1 grant will be provided in a single tranche \nand funds may be withdrawn upon fulfillment of the policy actions (Appendix 4). The subsequent \nsubprograms will be submitted for ADB Board consideration upon completion of the policy \nactions. The proceeds of the grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of \ndisbursement procedures and related requirements for policy-based loans.34 The proceeds will \nbe used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member \ncountries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible items and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources.35 Local currency generated from the grant will be directed to \nthe government\u2019s bank account to cover a part of the development financing needs for 2015.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE  \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n31.  Growth is expected to be positive for 2015 but is projected to decline to 1.7%, reflecting \nrecession in the Russian Federation, sluggish performance in Kazakhstan, and a further decline \nin gold production. The fiscal deficit increased to 4.3% of GDP in 2014 as slowing growth \ncontributed to a shortfall in revenue. The fiscal deficit is projected at around 5.0%\u20138.0% of GDP \nin 2015\u20132016. Reduced revenues will have  negative implications on sustaining reforms to \nensure  a  stable  growth  path.  Remittances,  constituting  about  25%  of  GDP  in  2014,  are \nprojected to decline by about 15% in 2015 (having declined by 5%-7% in the first quarter of \n2015). The growing fiscal and current account deficits, along with the already limited fiscal \nspace, will also constrain the ability of the government to mitigate the negative impact of any \nadditional external shock. The Second ICIP injection will not result in a surfeit of capital inflows \nand foreign exchange, nor will it undermine the money supply and exchange rate.36    \n \n32.  The reforms supported by the Second ICIP entail net negative direct and indirect fiscal \ncosts to the government i.e., costs of adjustment of implementing and monitoring the reforms. \nHowever, these reforms will, in time, generate a positive fiscal feedback by creating a wider and \nmore diversified economic and tax base. This improved tax base, combined with effective tax \nadministration,  will  help  generate  increased  revenues  for  the  government.  Key  economic \nbenefits include a more formal economy and an increase in the volume of money in the financial \nsystem from  increased use  of  noncash  payments.  Access to  credit for the  private  sector, \nparticularly  SMEs,  will  be  increased,  including  through  risk-sharing  facilities  for  women \n                                                \n34 ADB. 1998.

Grant proceeds disbursed \nagainst imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value of the total imports of Kyrgyz \nRepublic minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official \ndevelopment assistance, is greater than the amount of the grant expected to be disbursed in 2015. ADB will have \nthe right to audit the use of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n36 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nentrepreneurs,  innovative  products  (such  as  warehouse  receipts),  and  the  development  of \nIslamic finance and Islamic financial products. Improved public investment planning and PPP \nprojects  will  create  priority  infrastructure  assets  with  efficient  public  service  delivery  and \nincreased transparency in government transactions.  Government e-procurement will  enable \nsubstantial cost savings and efficiency improvements. Effective implementation of trade and \ninvestment policies will help diversify the economic base, create more job opportunities, and \nincrease  avenues  for  revenue  generation.  Tax  administration  reforms  can  increase \ntransparency, in addition to raising revenues. The investment grievance redress mechanism will \nimprove investor confidence. Based on the experiences of other countries, implementing the \nrequirements of GSP+ alone could raise substantial additional revenues for the government.37  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n33.  Risks  in  public finance  management  are  high,  but reforms  are  advancing  including \nbudget automation and improved management information systems. Necessary key reforms \ninclude  strengthening  of  budget  processes  and  the  link  between  a  medium-term  budget \nframework and the annual budget, and improving budget transparency. Development of the \ntreasury  system  in  line  with  international  accounting  standards  is  being  introduced  with \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) support. High procurement and corruption risks are being \nmitigated through mainstreaming e-procurement in government, supported under the proposed \nprogram.  Automation  of  tax  and  other  services  is  also  helping  to  reduce  rent-seeking \nopportunities.  The  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  is \nhelping  implement  the  government\u2019s  National  Anti-Corruption  Program  and  Action  Plan \n(approved 2012).38 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government and MOE. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social  \n \n34.  An improved business climate will help create new enterprises and support existing \nbusinesses to grow and innovate. This will create more jobs, including for the poor and rural \nworkers. Improved public infrastructure and services, such as for health, district heating, and \ntransport, will also benefit the poor and vulnerable. The Second ICIP is categorized as effective \ngender mainstreaming, since it helps address some key issues facing women in accessing \nfinance; receiving technical support for business development; and participating in policy, trade, \nand investment bodies. Specific gender actions include (i) establishing a financial risk-sharing \nfacility for women-owned or operated SMEs; (ii) ensuring gender balance in the staffing of the \nPPP Unit and the IPA, including gender sensitization training; (iii) prioritizing PPP projects with \npoverty  and  gender  impacts  and  ensuring  social  and  gender  impact  assessments  in  the \nevaluation of PPP projects; (iv) developing market-responsive courses and training, including \nthose that promote women's access to nontraditional occupations; and (v) providing technical \nsupport services to women SMEs to cope with increased export options expected under GSP+.  \n \nD.  Safeguards  \n \n35.  Activities under the Second ICIP are confined to policy and institutional reforms. The \nprogram  is  unlikely  to  have  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment,  require  involuntary \nresettlement,  or  affect  indigenous  peoples.  Safeguards  categorization  for  environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples are all C. \n                                                \n37 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 OECD. 2014.
