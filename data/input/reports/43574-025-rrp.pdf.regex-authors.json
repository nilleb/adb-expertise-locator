THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Uttar Pradesh Major District Roads Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve about 430 kilometers (km) of major district roads (MDRs) in the \nstate of Uttar Pradesh, in line with the Strategic Core Road Network Master Plan for Uttar \nPradesh. It will involve upgrading of MDRs depending on traffic requirements; reconstruction, \nwidening, and strengthening of culverts and bridges; and maintenance of the improved road \nassets for 5 years after construction.2 The project will also conduct a road safety audit of the \nMDRs on the core road network (CRN) and initiate remedial measures at identified critical \nlocations. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Despite accounting for just 7% of India\u2019s geographic area, Uttar Pradesh is home to \nabout 200 million, or 16% of the national population, making it the country\u2019s most populous state. \nIt is also amongst the poorer states in the country. Although Uttar Pradesh contributes about \n8.5% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product, its per capita income is less than half the national \naverage. Uttar Pradesh also has the largest rural population in the country. Almost 80% of its \npopulation lives in rural areas, where agriculture is the main economic activity and contributes \n46% to the state\u2019s income. Given the dispersed nature of industrial development, the road \nnetwork  is  a  critical  economic  infrastructure.  Uttar  Pradesh\u2019s  total  road  network  is  about \n300,000 km, and the road density per 100,000 people is 104 km against a national average of \n142 km. About 40% of its road network is rated poor to very poor, and only 13% is rated good. \nAbout 58% of this network has road width of less than 5.5 meters and barely 5% is wider than \ntwo lanes. If appropriate road capacity metrics are used, only 35% of national highways and \n60%  of  state  highways  have  comfortable  capacity  utilization,  while  the  rest  need  capacity \naugmentation such as widening.3 \n \n4.  To address the problems of road connectivity and capacity in the state, the Public Works \nDepartment  of  the  Government  of  Uttar  Pradesh  (UPPWD)  engaged  reputable  national \nconsulting firms to provide inputs for a study on the Strategic Core Road Network Master Plan. \nIn addition to preparing a vision statement and master plan, the study aimed to (i) identify the \nCRN and the requirements to upgrade it; (ii) establish the requirements to augment and improve \nstate highways, MDRs, and other district roads; (iii) plan the connectivity to all habitations by all-\nweather roads; and (iv) prepare an implementation and financing plan to achieve the above \ntargets, including an assessment of potential private sector participation. The CRN study of \nUPPWD estimates a total investment of $16 billion spread over four phases from 2014 to 2031 \n(the horizon year for the plan). This investment rate of $1 billion per year is proposed to be met \nmainly through a combination of government budget (about 60%), public\u2013private partnership \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Preparing the Uttar \nPradesh Major District Roads Investment Program (TA 8427) for $700,000. \n3  Government of India. 2011.

Lucknow. ", "2 \n(about 30%), and multilateral borrowing (about 10%). A sector assessment  summary is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n5.  The Government of Uttar Pradesh (GOUP) has requested ADB\u2019s financial assistance for \naddressing improvements to MDRs. This will be ADB\u2019s first road sector assistance to the state.4 \nMDRs form the key linkage between rural roads and state highways, connect peri-urban and \nurban areas, and have to be developed to complete state road connectivity. Developing this \nnetwork will foster inclusiveness by enabling larger segments of the state\u2019s population to better \naccess markets and basic services. This is aligned with the objective of ADB\u2019s transport sector \ninterventions in India\u2014to increase the movement of people and goods in a safer and more \nefficient and sustainable manner. The project involves (i) rehabilitating and upgrading about 430 \nkm of MDRs; (ii) improving road maintenance and asset management; and (iii) conducting a \nroad  safety  audit  of  MDRs  in  the  CRN,  and  implementing  remedial  measures.  UPPWD \nconsultants have prepared detailed project reports (DPRs) for eight road subprojects, and ADB \nhas provided project preparatory technical assistance to review and supplement the DPRs. \n \n6.  Sustainable  maintenance.  To  ensure  better  construction  quality  and  improved \nmaintenance of the road assets after construction, the project will include a 5-year performance-\nbased maintenance period included in the construction contract. This will transfer part of the \nconstruction quality risk and maintenance risk to the private sector, and yield better value for \nmoney to the users. \n   \n7.  Road safety. According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways report of 2013, \nthe country\u2019s road safety record is not very good, although it has shown signs of improvement \nsince 2010.5 Uttar Pradesh has one of the poorest road accident records among the states, and \nhas the country\u2019s seventh-highest number of accidents of registered vehicles. It also has the \nhighest proportion of fatal accidents in the country, with over 11% in 2013. In this context, Uttar \nPradesh became one of the first states in the country to establish a road safety policy in 2014. \nEstablished in partnership with the World Bank and the Government of New Zealand, the policy \ncovers (i) building awareness of road safety, (ii) strengthening institutional arrangements, (iii) \nestablishing a road safety database, (iv) ensuring safer road infrastructure, (v) promoting safer \nvehicles, (vi) training drivers for safety, (vii) enforcing traffic laws, and (viii) providing emergency \nmedical assistance to accident victims. Projects under consideration by the World Bank and \nADB will facilitate UPPWD\u2019s actions to improve road safety. The road safety policy of the state \nis in Supplementary Appendix C.6 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome  \n8.  The impact will be improved mobility and accessibility, aligned with the Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan of the Government of India.7 The outcome will be improved efficiency and safety of the \ncore road network in Uttar Pradesh. \n \n                                                \n4 In parallel, the World Bank is appraising a $400 million loan to the Government of Uttar Pradesh for the Core Road \nNetwork Development Project, which aims to improve state highways. \n5 Government of India, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. 2013.

The project outputs will be (i) MDRs, designed to all-weather standards and road safety, \nreconstructed and rehabilitated; (ii) road maintenance and asset management improved; and \n(iii) road safety of MDRs in the CRN audited and safety features installed. About 430 km of \nMDRs will be reconstructed and rehabilitated to two-lane width of 7 meters. The roads will be \ndesigned for all-weather use and with road safety features. The construction contracts will \ninclude 5-year performance-based maintenance obligations to ensure better asset quality and \nimproved maintenance. A road safety audit will be carried out for all MDRs in the CRN, and \nappropriate and cost-efficient measures will be implemented to address accident-prone spots. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n10.  The project is estimated to cost $428,000,000 (Table 1).

The amount of taxes and duties to be financed by ADB are (i) within the reasonable threshold identified \nduring the CPS preparation process; (ii) represent only 5% of the investment plan; and (iii) apply only to ADB-\nfinanced expenditures. The financing of taxes and duties is considered material and relevant to the success of the \nproject. \nb  In June 2015 prices. \nc  Physical contingencies computed at 2% for civil works.

The government has requested a loan of $300,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \ngovernment has requested that repayment follow the straight-line repayment option. Based on \nthe above loan terms and this repayment option, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years and \nthe maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. \n \n                                                \n8 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \n12.

Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The executing agency for the project will be Public Works Department, Government of \nUttar Pradesh, which will implement the project through its project implementation unit (PIU) \nbased in the state\u2019s capital city, Lucknow. Headed by the chief engineer for externally aided \nprojects, the PIU will have field offices in key locations, be responsible for day-to-day project \nimplementation  and  management,  and  assign  staff  to  work  on  the  project.  One  executive \nengineer will be assigned as project manager for two or three contract packages. The project \nmanagers will be delegated adequate technical and administrative authority for expeditious \nproject  implementation.  The  PIU  will  engage  construction  supervision  consultants  as  the \nengineers for the construction contracts. All procurement of goods and works will be undertaken \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All \nconsultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). \n \n14.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2016\u2013March 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2021  Loan closing date  30 September 2021 \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency  Public Works Department, Government of Uttar Pradesh \n(ii)  Implementation unit  One PIU at the UPPWD headquarters in Lucknow, headed by the \nchief engineer for externally aided projects, and field units in Aligarh, \nKanpur, Lucknow, and Moradabad.

About \n35 full-time staff will be assigned to the project, plus oversight and \ncontrol from the UPPWD principal secretary at Lucknow. \nProcurement  National competitive  10 contracts  $20,000,000 to \nbidding  $40,000,000 each \n ", "5 \nAspects   Arrangements \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- About 2,200 person- $10,000,000 (total, in \nbased selection; full  months for  three packages) \ntechnical proposal  supervision \nconsultants, \n120 person-months \nfor road safety audit, \nand 192 person-\nmonths for \nimplementation \nsupport consultants \nRetroactive financing and/or  Works and consulting services \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PIU = project implementation unit, UPPWD = Public Works Department of the \nGovernment of Uttar Pradesh. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n   \n15.  ADB approved advance contracting of civil works in September 2013. UPPWD has \ncompleted the  preparation  of  DPRs for  all  project roads,  including  safeguard  assessment. \nUPPWD has prepared the master bidding documents and commenced bidding for civil works. \nBased on this, the national and state governments requested retroactive financing for all project \ncomponents. Up to 20% of the loan proceeds will be eligible for retroactive financing, provided \nthat expenditures are incurred on works and consulting services for the project in accordance \nwith agreed procedures and before loan effectiveness, but not more than 12 months before the \nsigning of the loan agreement. The national and state governments and UPPWD have been \ninformed that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not in any way \ncommit ADB to finance the project. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n16.  The project was prepared by UPPWD, which has experience with a previous World Bank \nloan and technical assistance.9 UPPWD engaged consultants with its own funds to prepare \nDPRs for the roads proposed for ADB financing, incorporating ADB requirements of economic, \nsocial, and environmental studies into the consultants\u2019 terms of reference. ADB engaged a \nconsulting firm under a project preparatory technical assistance to conduct due diligence and \nsupplement  the  DPRs  to  ensure  the  due  diligence  complies  with  ADB  requirements.  The \nengineering design was prepared to avoid land acquisition as well as social and environmental \nimpacts, and to take road safety into account. In addition, advance actions have been taken to \nensure  the  construction  can  commence  early.  All  these  measures  have  improved  project \nreadiness and will mitigate the risk of delay. \n \n                                                \n9  World Bank. India: Uttar Pradesh State Roads Project.  http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P067606/uttar-pradesh-\nstate-roads-project?lang=en&tab=overview. This project provided for technical assistance. \n ", "6 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.  Economic  assessment.  Economic  evaluation  of  the  project  followed  the  standard \npractice of comparing life cycle road and user costs with and without the project, using the net \npresent value with a 12% discount rate and economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision \ncriteria. The highway development and management system was used in the analysis, which \nfocused on transport cost savings. \n \n18.  The EIRRs for the project roads are assessed as 16.9%\u201321.2% in the base case, and \nremain above 13.8% in sensitivity scenarios. Overall, the economic returns for roads are robust, \nsatisfying the economic efficiency criteria. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate the \nrobustness of the economic viability of the project to cost overruns and benefit reductions. The \nfollowing cases were analyzed: (i) base cost and base benefits, (ii) capital cost increased by \n10% and base benefits, (iii) benefits reduced by 10% and capital cost, (iv) capital cost increased \nby 10% and benefits reduced by 10%, and (v) a 1-year delay in construction. The results of the \nsensitivity analysis are in Table 11. In all cases, all project roads have EIRRs above 12%. The \nanalysis result of adverse scenarios shows the project is economically viable. \n \n19.  Financial sustainability. Annual average incremental recurrent costs associated with \nthe project are estimated to be 0.1% of UPPWD\u2019s current maintenance budget and a marginal \nproportion of UPPWD\u2019s overall maintenance budget on an annual basis. Funds allocated for \nroad maintenance have been rising by about 19% per year from FY2004 to FY2015. The 5-year \nmaintenance obligation will be part of the project, so it is included in the legal agreements and \nwill be part of the contracts. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that funds will be available to meet \nthe maintenance costs.   \n     \nC.  Governance \n20.  Institutional  capacity.  UPPWD,  the  executing  agency,  is  a  department  of  the \nGovernment of Uttar Pradesh. Established in the 1850s, UPPWD has also managed railways, \nirrigation,  and  local  government  infrastructure  projects.  It  currently  manages  roads  and \ngovernment buildings in Uttar Pradesh. UPPWD has over 50,000 employees, about 14% of \nwhom are technical staff. It is headed by an engineer-in-chief and head of department, two \nengineers-in-chief, and 25 chief engineers. While UPPWD has extensive experience (technical, \ncontracting,  and  implementation)  in  public  works,  its  experience  working  with  multilateral \nagencies is limited to one World Bank loan (footnote 9). ADB and the World Bank are each \nappraising a road sector loan for UPPWD at present. \n \n21.  Financial management. An assessment of UPPWD\u2019s accounting systems and financial \nreporting  and  audit  procedures  concluded  that  the  department  conducts  its  accounts  in \naccordance with standard single-entry, cash-based government systems and by its budget \nallocation. UPPWD has experience in project financial accounting and disbursement procedures \nbased on its prior experience with a World Bank-funded project. The assessment has concluded \nthat the overall risk is moderate. Key risk and mitigation measures have been identified as part \nof the assessment. UPPWD will retain an accounting firm under this project to assist in project \naccounts and train the concerned staff. UPPWD will maintain separate project accounts and \nrecords by funding source for all expenditures incurred on the project. Project accounts will be \ncomputerized and follow accounting principles and practices prescribed by the government\u2019s \naccounting  laws  and  regulations.  Internal  audit  is  carried  out  by  the  Audit  and  Accounts \nDepartment of GOUP, and is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India in \naccordance with the Accounts and Audit Standards issued by the Government of India. With the \n ", "7 \nabove  proposed  actions,  the  overall  financial  management  arrangements  are  considered \nsatisfactory for the project. \n \n22.  Procurement. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants using quality- and cost-based selection. All civil works will be procured \nthrough national competitive bidding. E-procurement is essential for all works contracts in Uttar \nPradesh, and will be used in this project. Goods and works will be procured following ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. UPPWD has extensive experience in procurement and consultant \nrecruitment for public sector projects, although experience with multilateral agency procurement \nis  limited  to  one World  Bank  project.  Project  preparatory  technical  assistance  consultants \nsupported UPPWD in preparing procurement documents for all project roads. Recruitment of \nconstruction supervision consultants is already under way. The procurement plan for the project \nis appended in the PAM. \n     \n23.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and UPPWD. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n    \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  Uttar Pradesh is one of the poorer and less developed states in India, with per capita \nincome less than half the national average and about 30% of population below the poverty \nline.10 Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for 80% of the state\u2019s population; trade and \nnonagricultural labor are its other sources of income (footnote 3). This also applies to the project \narea of influence, which covers 12 districts with a total population of 34.8 million. 11 Infrastructure \nservices  along  the  road  corridor  are  basic,  with  drinking  water  mostly  accessed  through \ngovernment-provided hand pumps. While rural areas are not connected to the grid, most urban \nsettlements have electricity. \n \n25.  Project beneficiaries will be roadside residents, road users, shop owners, and farmers. \nAccording to the survey data, roadside residents\u2019 most frequent motorized journey patterns are \nfrom their residence to bigger market towns, district hospitals, and administrative services, as \nwell as secondary schools and colleges. Few (3%\u201310%) residents own private vehicles, and \nmost  of  them  use  collective  transport  to  move  around.  Consultations,  which  involved \n1,665 participants, indicated that poor road conditions were preventing safe and reliable travel, \nespecially at night and during the rainy season. The project will provide improved access to \nsocial services and facilitate stronger links between rural regions and urban hubs. \n     \n26.  Gender. Uttar Pradesh has very poor gender indicators and has one of the lowest sex \nratios in the country at 912 females per 1,000 males (footnote 3). Local customs in many of the \nproject roads have limited women\u2019s participation in consultation activities.  ADB consultants \norganized 23 women-specific focus group discussions with 312 female participants to ensure \ntheir views were integrated into the project design. According to the focus group discussions \nand baseline survey, walking is women\u2019s predominant means of transportation, and the use of \nbicycles by schoolgirls is common only in a minority of project roads. The majority of women \nwere reported to use collective transport, although many perceived it to be unsafe.

Other social considerations. Uttar Pradesh has 0.10% HIV prevalence, lower than the \nnational average of 0.27%.12 Given that the project involves improving existing corridors, it is not \nexpected to increase HIV incidence. Nevertheless, contractors will carry out HIV and AIDS \nawareness programs for their laborers at work sites. As for human trafficking, the prevalence in \nthe project area is low.13 As part of the project, community awareness campaigns for road \nresidents on HIV and AIDS, human trafficking, and personal and road safety will be conducted \nby the nongovernment organization implementing the resettlement plan in coordination with \nexisting local initiatives. Moreover, UPPWD will ensure that all contracts include provisions to \nsafeguard labor standards. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environmental impact. The scope of works under the project involves the improvement \nand maintenance of existing MDRs. Adequate right-of-way is available for all project roads, and \nno significant, long-term, or irreversible environmental impacts are expected. None of the roads \nfall inside environmentally sensitive areas. Therefore, the project has been classified category B \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). A single initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  report  has  been  prepared  containing  road-specific  environmental \nmanagement plans (EMPs), in accordance with the safeguard policy, and is disclosed on the \nADB  website.  Anticipated  environmental  impacts  under  the  project  entail  typical  road \nconstruction-related issues, such as generation of dust, noise, exhaust, waste from construction \nand worker camps, water contamination, occupational health and safety, erosion, and siltation.  \n \n29.  Environmental Measures. The EMPs include mitigation measures to address these \nimpacts, such as dust suppression along active construction fronts and camp sites; use of \nmobile noise barriers; and strict implementation of road safety-related Indian Road Congress \nand  contract-specific  safety,  health,  and  environment  guidelines.  The  mandatory  1:2 \ncompensatory plantation for the loss of avenue trees along UPPWD roads will be done. In \naddition, UPPWD will obtain consent from land owners and jurisdictional district forest offices to \ninstall  additional  plantation  and  permanent  noise  barriers  near  the  locations  of  sensitive \nreceptors\u2014such as schools, hospitals, and other areas identified in the IEE\u2014to minimize noise \nand dust levels during project operation. The costs of these measures are included in the civil \nworks contract. The road-specific EMPs will form part of the bidding documents. Meaningful \nconsultations have been conducted during project preparation, and all the concerns of the \naffected  persons  and  stakeholders  have  been  incorporated  in  the  IEE  and  EMPs.  These \nconsultations included representatives from key environmental agencies, roadside communities, \nand nongovernment organizations. An integrated social and environmental grievance redress \nmechanism  has  been  formed  to  continue  receiving  feedback  and  complaints,  if  any,  from \naffected parties, and addressing them during the construction stage and operation stage. \n  \n                                                \n12 Government of India, Department of Health and Family Welfare.

Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement.  It  is  expected  to  affect  976  non-titled  households  totaling \n7,103 people. UPPWD\u2019s right-of-way ownership of all road corridors has been verified with the \nlocal  Land  Revenue  Records  Department,  and  the  project  does  not  require  private  land \nacquisition. Road designs have been modified to avoid resettlement impacts to the extent \npossible. Overall, impacts will be limited to external sections of residential and commercial \nstructures  (i.e.,  verandas,  stairs,  and  balconies)  without  affecting  their  viability. 14  Only \n27 households will be fully displaced, most of them losing their commercial structures. Impacts \nhave been adequately addressed through the seven resettlement plans and one due diligence \nreport prepared for the project.15 These documents are disclosed on the ADB and executing \nagency websites. 16 Affected persons will be compensated at replacement cost and provided \nwith relocation, reconstruction, and income restoration assistance. Special measures have been \nintegrated for vulnerable households. Grievance redress committees have been set up in the \nfield  offices  and  headquarters.  The  executing  agency  will  implement  and  finance  the \nresettlement plans. All mitigation measures follow the guidelines of the resettlement framework \napproved by ADB and UPPWD.17 \n \n31.  Indigenous  people. The project is classified category C in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. Uttar Pradesh has a low tribal population, representing only 1.1% \nof its total population (footnote 3). The census survey confirmed that the project will not affect \nscheduled tribe households. \n \n32.  Safeguards  implementation  arrangements.  Although  UPPWD  is  familiar  with \nmultilateral development bank safeguards requirements, having recently implemented a World \nBank project, it did not originally have staff dedicated to safeguard implementation. This project \nwill build on UPPWD\u2019s experience and strengthen its implementation capacity by including \ndedicated safeguards staff. At the central level, UPPWD\u2019s capacity will be increased by adding \none social and one environmental safeguard officer fully dedicated to safeguards. They will be \nsupported by two outsourced environmental and social consultants. At the field level, each PIU \nwill appoint a focal person dedicated to the management of environment and social safeguards \nas well as grievances (safeguards focal officer). The field-level PIU safeguards focal officer will \nbe supported by the environmental and resettlement specialists of the construction supervision \nconsultants, who will guide and monitor the implementation of EMPs and resettlement plans, as \nwell as the awareness campaign, labor standard, and gender activities. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 Based on the overall assessment, the \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n                                                \n14 Understood as affecting a structure\u2019s main walls. \n15 Bulandshahr\u2013Anoopshahr\u2013Dibai Chowk road (58W) is the only project road where no resettlement impacts have \nbeen identified, so a due diligence report has been prepared in lieu of a resettlement plan. \n16 ADB.

ADB Projects. http://uppwd.up.nic.in/ADB.html. \n17 ADB and UPPWD approved a resettlement framework in April 2015 to guide the preparation of the resettlement \nplan and meet the legislative requirements for the implementing agencies to conduct the resettlement activities \nunder the project. At the time of writing, the framework is being examined by Uttar Pradesh\u2019s cabinet. \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInitial delays in  UPPWD has prepared the detailed design for all eight project roads, and completed \nproject  safeguards-related surveys and reviews. Consultant recruitment for construction \nimplementation  supervision has been initiated, and procurement documents have been prepared. \nProcurement actions have been initiated in January 2016. Project designs have been \nprepared to avoid land acquisition. However, given UPPWD\u2019s limited experience with \nmultilateral agency projects, the risk after mitigation is retained as medium. \nInadequate  Engineers and construction supervision consultants will be engaged for quality checks \nquality checking  in accordance with contracts. ADB will undertake frequent review missions to ensure \nand monitoring  timely undertaking and quality of contracts. Four project implementation field units are \n  being envisaged, distributed around the state in proximity to work sites. These units \nwill be supported by firms of construction supervision consultants. The introduction of \n5-year, performance-based maintenance in works contracts will substantially increase \ncontractor accountability for construction quality. Despite these steps, quality control \nwill remain as a task that is best addressed by field staff. The roads are dispersed \ngeographically throughout this large state. Therefore, the level of risk after mitigation is \nbeing retained as medium. \nInsufficient  Five-year performance-based contracts will be adopted and included in the works \nfunds available  contracts.
