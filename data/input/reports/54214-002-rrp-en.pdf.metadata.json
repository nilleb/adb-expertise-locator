THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed loans \nto Mongolia for the Second Shock-Responsive Social Protection Project. \n \n2.  With a worsening coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation unfolding in the fourth quarter \nof 2020, the Government of Mongolia has requested urgent additional support for social protection \nmeasures to mitigate the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic on poor and vulnerable \ngroups.1 The proposed project will (i) apply shock-responsive social protection principles to \ncontinue support for pro-poor child grant top-ups on a temporary basis through an established \nnational social assistance program, and (ii) strengthen social welfare programs and systems for \nimproved household resilience and government response to future crises. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Impact of the pandemic. Mongolia took early and decisive action starting in January 2020 \nto prevent the outbreak of COVID-19. However, while the direct health impact was initially limited, \neconomic data and several rapid assessments confirm that the socioeconomic consequences of \nthe virus containment efforts\u2014including border closures, trade disruptions, and school and \nbusiness closures\u2014have been substantial.2 The economy contracted by 5.3% in 2020, indicating \nthe worst economic recession since 1992.3 The contraction has been driven by a significant \ndecline in mining, transport, trade, and construction. The resulting household-level shocks can be \nsevere and long-lasting, particularly on the poor and vulnerable. As early as May 2020, (i) nearly \nthree-quarters of all Mongolian households and 85% of poor households reported experiencing \nsome sort of economic shock, (ii) nearly two-thirds (64%) of all households reported an increase \nin food prices, (iii) nearly three-quarters (73%) of self-employed workers experienced income loss, \nand (iv) 70% of farmers and herder households reported a decline in income compared with the \nprevious year.4 The impact of the pandemic became more acute in Mongolia with the first \ncommunity transmission recorded in November 2020, causing the government to issue strict \nlockdown orders from 12 November 2020 to 11 January 2021 and again from 11 to 23 February \n2021. \n \n4.  Pre-crisis poverty. The pre-crisis poverty rate was already high at 28.4% in a population \nof 3.24 million, but this national average conceals important differences by location, sex, and age. \nThe poverty rate is significantly higher among urban households headed by women (32.4%), \nhouseholds living in the country's eastern region (37.4%), and among very young children aged \n0\u20134 (38.0%).5 Childhood poverty is widespread: children under the age of 15 comprise 42% of \nthe country's nearly 905,000 poor people, while 52% live in households with more than three \nchildren. A large share of Mongolians who are technically nonpoor live precariously close to the \n \n1  The project is included in ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2021. Manila.

Increasing the poverty line by half (from MNT166,580 to MNT249,870 per capita per \nmonth) nearly doubles the poverty rate to 55.7% (footnote 5). Mongolia's experience of both past \ncrises and the COVID-19 pandemic confirms the risk of negative coping strategies. These include \nselling productive assets, reducing consumption levels, or making harmful choices regarding \ninvestment in education, health, and livelihoods, all of which can impact long-term well-being.6 In \nMay  2020,  27%  of  households  reported  that  their  food  consumption  had  declined,  with \nhouseholds headed by women being much more likely to report decreased food consumption \n(41.0%) than those headed by men (22.5%).7 \n \n5.  Mongolia's  effective  social  protection  response.  To  mitigate  the  impact  of  the \npandemic, the government issued a robust package of measures worth about 1.5% of gross \ndomestic product to stimulate the economy and extend social protection. The first set of measures \nimplemented from April to September 2020 included five key interventions: (i) exempting all \nbusiness entities from social insurance contributions for 6 months, which benefitted employers as \nwell  as  paid  employees  and  self-employed  people  who  make  voluntary  contributions; \n(ii) exempting  citizens  from  personal  income  tax  on  salaries  for  6  months  (excluding  civil \nservants); (iii)  exempting  smaller  companies (with  income  lower  than  MNT1.5  billion) from \ncorporate income tax for 6 months; (iv) paying entities that kept employees on the payroll despite \nweakening  operations  a  monthly  allowance  of  MNT200,000  per  employee  from  April  to \nJune 2020; and (v) increasing monthly child grants under the universal child money program \n(CMP) to MNT100,000 (from the basic benefit of MNT20,000). From May 2020, added measures \nincluded doubling the monthly food stamps targeted at the poorest households and increasing \nsocial welfare pensions by MNT100,000 for highly vulnerable groups (persons with disabilities, \nolder persons without other pensions, orphans, and single parents with many children). A \nsubsequent set of measures covering October\u2013December 2020 continued some of these policies \nand measures and suspended others.8 \n \n6.  A microsimulation analysis shows that both inequality and poverty would have increased \nsignificantly without these measures (footnote 2), which appear to have not only counteracted the \nnegative effects but may also have reduced poverty from the pre-pandemic baseline level. \nBecause of the high rate of child poverty and the large number of children in poor households, \nthe child grants alone reduced both poverty and inequality (para. 18), reaching 64% of the \ncountry's households, comprising 80% of the population. On the strength of this result, and with \nthe crisis worsening as of November 2020 and prolonged socioeconomic impacts expected, the \ngovernment approved the extension of the child grant top-ups from January to June 2021. \n \n7.  Global social protection lessons. Mongolia's emphasis on social assistance in its \nCOVID-19 response is in keeping with global practice. As of September 2020, virtually all \ncountries and territories (212) had planned, introduced, or adapted 1,179 social protection \nprograms in response to COVID-19; the majority were social assistance transfers (724 measures, \nor 61.4% of the total).9 About 51% of these safety net measures (and 31% of global measures) \nwere cash-based transfers in 158 countries, as in Mongolia. During a crisis, expanding support \nusing existing programs and their infrastructure, such as targeting and delivery systems, is more \n \n6  ADB. 2018.

Social \ninsurance contributions were no longer waived, but paid at a reduced rate of 5% by both employers and employees. \nSmaller companies continued to be exempted from corporate income tax until the end of 2020. \n9  U.

Mongolia's Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) \nused its food stamp program in this way during the financial crisis in 2017, as well as both food \nstamps and child grants in the initial response to the pandemic in 2020, supported by ADB under \nthe first Shock-Responsive Social Protection Project (para. 13).10 International lessons include \nthe importance of strengthening poverty targeting and social welfare delivery systems to be ready \nto respond when crises hit. Poverty is dynamic, but Mongolia's poverty targeting database is \nseveral years out of date. Timely data updating, operational capacity, and limited use across \nprograms are challenges for the system's sustainability and effectiveness. COVID-19 has also \nunderscored the need to develop shock-responsive systems and programs that help address \nmultidimensional poverty, support the longer-term recovery process, and increase resilience to \nfuture shocks. Global impact evaluation evidence confirms that an innovative approach to social \nprotection that combines cash support with a more holistic set of livelihood and coaching \ninterventions can address multiple facets of deprivation and help poor people diversify their \nincome sources sustainably, and ultimately become more resilient in the context of shocks (para. \n21).11  \n \n8.  Strategic alignment. The project is aligned with the April 2020 ADB policy paper, which \nemphasizes that the scope and scale of the ongoing crisis make it imperative for ADB to step up \nsupport to developing member countries to combat the effects of the pandemic.12 Strengthening \nsocial  protection  systems  and  service  delivery  is  a  fundamental  element  of  both  ADB's          \nCOVID-19 response and ADB's Strategy 2030 operational priority 1 (addressing remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities). The project also addresses operational priority 2 (accelerating \nprogress in gender equality) and is aligned with several Sustainable Development Goals that \ninclude social protection targets.13 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n9.  The project is aligned with the following impact: adverse socioeconomic impacts of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic reduced (footnote 12). The project will have the following outcome: social \nwelfare support for the poor and vulnerable, especially women and children, enhanced.14 \n \n10.  Output 1: Pro-poor child grant top-ups delivered. Output 1 will finance a share of the \nextended shock-responsive increase in the monthly child grant benefits for an additional 6 months \n(January\u2013June 2021), following on from the earlier top-ups supported under the emergency \nassistance loan from April to September 2020. The CMP provides universal cash grants to all \nchildren aged 0\u201317 as long as the children are registered in the Integrated Household Database \n(IHD). Payments are made electronically, directly to accounts set up in children's names, with \nmothers as the account custodians in 85.6% of households. Before the top-ups, in March 2020, \n1,107,130 children (about 93% of all children) received child grants of MNT20,000 per month. A \nmother of three children under 18 would have received about $21.50 (about 7.2% of the monthly \npoverty line for a family of five) to support her children's needs. As of November 2020, 1,184,158 \nchildren (comprising 48.2% girls, and 97.6% of all children) received the topped-up child grants \n \n10 An ADB emergency assistance loan of $26.4 million supported the first round of Mongolia\u2019s food stamp and child \ngrant top-ups from April to September 2020, with 99.05% disbursement as of December 2020.

Output 2: Social welfare programs and systems strengthened. To improve household \nresilience and the government\u2019s response to future crises, output 2 will finance activities in three \nkey areas: (i) updating the poverty targeting system and the IHD with more accurate data to be \nbetter able to reach people in need through support for the next round of the proxy means test \nsurvey based on a new methodology, (ii) supporting the digitization of social welfare programs \ninto the \"e-welfare\" system to streamline benefit and service delivery, and (iii) pilot testing and \nevaluating the graduation approach as an innovative type of social protection program that builds \non cash transfers with a holistic set of livelihood and coaching interventions. Also described as \neconomic  inclusion  or  \"big  push\"  programs,16  the  pilot  test  covering  at  least  1,500  poor \nhouseholds (participants in the food stamp program and/or CMP) will include rigorous impact \nevaluation to strengthen the evidence base on what works for lasting poverty reduction in \nMongolia.17 New impact evaluation evidence confirms that graduation programs have made \nhouseholds more resilient in the context of the COVID-19 shock (para. 21). \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n12.  ADB  will  leverage  sector  experience,  expertise,  partner  resources,  and  technical \nassistance (TA) to deliver shock-responsive social protection. ADB has been a leading partner in \nthe development of Mongolia\u2019s social protection system since 1994, through a series of loans, \ngrants, and TA projects.18 ADB supported the introduction of the poverty targeting system        \n(para. 19) and the design and rollout of the food stamp program as part of the government's \neffective response to the 2009 food and fuel crisis. Based on this experience, ADB was able to \nrespond swiftly with the emergency assistance loan to support the child grant and food stamp top-\nups in June 2020. The proposed project will access the resources and experts from ongoing TA \nto strengthen the social welfare system.19 The TA outputs include (i) improving the capacity of \nsocial workers and social welfare policy and decision makers; and (ii) supporting social welfare \nresearch, policy dialogue, and advocacy. The TA team produced a well-received assessment of \nMongolia's social protection response to COVID-19 (footnote 2) and has coordinated with the \nUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on a forthcoming assessment of the vertical expansion \nof child grants and food stamps, including a gender impact assessment. A series of planned \nknowledge  products  will  contribute  to  the  dialogue  on  improving  targeting,  consolidating \nprograms, building more permanent shock-responsive mechanisms, and strengthening social \nprotection to promote resilience, thus contributing to the longer-term reform objectives that ADB \nhas been supporting. \n \n \n15 This broadly matches the sex ratio of Mongolian children confirmed by the National Statistics Office of Mongolia data \nfor 2019, showing children aged 0\u201319 as 51.1% boys and 48.9% girls. The imbalance is more pronounced among \nchildren aged 0\u20134, at 51.3% boys and 48.7% girls.  \n16 A. Bannerjee, E. Duflo, and G. Sharma. 2020.

The project forms part of ADB's holistic and \ncomprehensive package of support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in Mongolia.20 This \npackage includes rapid pandemic response measures in the health sector, such as procuring \nemergency health equipment and TA for emergency response systems, as well as short- and \nmedium-term responses such as (i) the first Shock-Responsive Social Protection Project (footnote \n10), (ii) a $30.0 million loan to support health security, (iii) a $24.0 million reallocation to support \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, and (iv) a $100.0 million countercyclical support program to \nhelp the government manage the economic impact of COVID-19 and respond to public health \nand social protection needs.21 Achievements under the emergency assistance loan include \nincreasing  food  security  through  food  stamp  benefit  top-ups  for  241,962  of  the  poorest \nMongolians, and significantly mitigating the poverty effect of the pandemic-induced recession \nthrough timely child grant top-ups reaching 1.18 million children from April to September 2020 \n(para. 18). \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $259.64 million (Table 1). This includes the total cost of \nthe current increased child grant benefit amount of MNT100,000 per month for 6 months, for \n1.2 million children, budgeted at $254.45 million, for which the ADB-financed share is proposed \nto be $68.13 million.

As the executing agency, the MLSP will ensure timely monthly \nchild grant transfers based on the beneficiary roster provided by the implementing agency, the \nGeneral Office of Labor and Welfare Services, generated from the IHD. To maximize project \nreadiness and continuity, the project implementation unit (PIU) will comprise five staff (a project \ncoordinator, a finance officer, a procurement specialist, an information technology [IT] specialist, \nand an administration officer) who supported prior ADB-financed social protection projects with \nthe same executing agency.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  Social transfers as a driver of poverty reduction. Before the pandemic, social transfers \nreduced poverty in Mongolia by 1.3 percentage points from 2016 to 2018, more than any other \nfactor including farm income (footnote 5). Evidence confirms the effectiveness of the CMP in \nreducing poverty. Analysis of the 2016 household socioeconomic survey revealed that, in the \nabsence of the child grants, the child poverty rate would have been 5 percentage points higher.23 \nAssessing the impact of the government's 2020 pandemic response, ADB's microsimulation \nreport estimates that the pandemic-induced economic recession could have increased poverty to \n36.7%, but social protection measures reduced poverty to 17.6% (footnote 2). The two measures \nwith the largest budgets are the social insurance contribution and income tax waivers and the \nchild grant top-ups. Comparing their effects, if the only policy response were the waivers, the \nshare of people falling below the poverty line would be 30.5%. This is lower than the poverty rate \nunder the pandemic effect, but higher than the pre-pandemic scenario. However, the effect of \nonly the child grant top-ups is a drop in poverty to 24.9%. In other words, the child grant top-ups \nalone could compensate for the poverty effect of the pandemic. Because they disproportionally \nreach  poorer  households,  child  grants  also  reduce  inequality  (unlike  the  waivers,  which \ndisproportionally benefit better off households). With the child grant top-up alone, it is estimated \nthat the Gini coefficient would decrease to 0.307, while the waivers alone would increase the Gini \ncoefficient to 0.342 (against a pre-pandemic baseline of 0.327). \n \n19.  Poverty targeting. Eligibility for some social welfare programs is means-tested. The proxy \nmeans test methodology was initially developed with ADB support,24 and the World Bank has \nbeen closely involved in updating the methodology and building capacity in an attempt to reduce \nerrors of exclusion and inclusion. Child grants are targeted at all children aged 0\u201317. The benefits \nare universal, but conditional on being registered in the IHD. Child grants have been targeted in \nvarious ways and at various times in the past. During the 2017 financial crisis, ADB and \ndevelopment partners recommended that they be targeted at the poorest 60% of children in the \nIHD. This was done for several months, but as the poverty situation worsened, the government \nproposed to extend the grants to target 80% of children. The International Monetary Fund and \ndevelopment partners agreed that the fiscal implications of this change were minimal, increasing \n \n23 International Labour Organization (ILO) and UNICEF. 2019.

Mongolia: Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project. \n ", "8 \nfiscal expenditure by $22.8 million, or 0.58% of total fiscal expenditure in 2017.25 In the present \ncontext of high vulnerability, the potential gains from targeting are likely reduced because so many \npeople are in danger of falling into poverty as a result of the pandemic.26 A universal crisis such \nas COVID-19 calls for a universal response, but the government recognizes that, in the future, it \nwill be necessary to consider how to better target benefits for maximum poverty reduction impact. \n \n20.  Building resilience through shock-responsive social protection. Social protection by \ndefinition has the objective of reducing vulnerability. Social assistance (non-contributory transfers) \nis particularly effective at protecting poor people's income from both idiosyncratic shocks that \naffect individual households (illness and job loss), and covariate shocks that affect almost \neveryone  (financial  crisis,  pandemic,  and  natural  disaster).  Increasing  cash  transfers  in \nanticipation of, during, or after a shock helps poor and vulnerable households meet their basic \nneeds, cushions the impact of shocks, and reduces the pressure to engage in coping strategies \nthat weaken long-term adaptive capacity. Support before an event reduces risk while support after \nan event facilitates effective recovery (footnote 6). The project will help ensure that the population \nis not rendered more vulnerable to future disasters, including the dzud (a severe winter resulting \nin livestock deaths) or other shocks as a consequence of adverse coping mechanisms adopted \nin response to COVID-19. Evidence from the food and fuel crisis regarding the time required for \nrecovery demonstrates that lower-income groups took significantly longer to recover. Shock-\nresponsive transfers act as bridging assistance to help maintain development gains. \n \n21.  Effectiveness of the graduation approach. ADB has supported the design, testing, and \nrigorous  evaluation  of  the  graduation  approach  since  2016,  collaborating  with  BRAC  and \nInnovations for Poverty Action. A November 2020 impact evaluation of ADB's program in the \nPhilippines  confirms  a  range  of  positive  impacts  in  the  context  of  coping  with  COVID-19: \ncompared with a control group of households that only received cash transfers, the graduation \nprogram  participants  had  diversified  livelihoods  and  increased  household  resilience  across \nseveral dimensions including financial security, food security, and mental health during the \nquarantine period.27 In addition, graduation program households were less likely than those in the \ncontrol group to reduce food consumption, skip health care visits, or send children to work in \nresponse to the pandemic-induced economic disruption. These initial results contribute to the \nglobal evidence base that the holistic graduation approach has the potential to support poor and \nvulnerable households in diverse settings and challenging circumstances to build resilience and \nembark on a pathway out of poverty. Diversification is one of the major challenges in Mongolia \nand an underlying cause of vulnerability, particularly for poor households. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n22.  Assessing the economic viability of the program requires establishing the economic \ncosts.28 A cash transfer is an economic transfer within society, and thus has no direct economic \ncosts. Only the administrative costs of transfer payments are considered economic costs. Since \nthe project will utilize existing child grant delivery infrastructure (e.g., the targeting system and the \n100% electronic payment system directly to bank accounts) and provide only a top-up to existing \nbenefits, the marginal costs for distributing the child grants will be negligible. A standard cost\u2013\n \n25 ADB. 2020. Completion Report: Social Welfare Support Program Phase 2 in Mongolia. Manila.

For this project, the most \nimportant benefits are not directly quantifiable in economic terms. However, it is clear that these \nunconditional transfers will help the recipients maintain adequate consumption. Since poor \nhouseholds have a higher consumption propensity than the general population, this redistributive \nmeasure will help cushion the decline in consumption and gross domestic product growth. Based \non  the  government's  commitment  to  providing  a  temporary  shock-responsive  top-up  until          \nJune 2021, and a return to the base payment on an ongoing basis thereafter, and the relatively \nimmaterial impact on the government's budget, the project is considered financially sustainable. \nThe Government Action Plan, 2020\u20132024 and the update to the Social Welfare Law, 2012 for \napproval by Parliament in 2021 both confirm that social protection remains a priority, and there is \nstrong government commitment to improving poverty targeting in the future. To ensure that social \nwelfare is continuously allocated with a budget, an assurance is included in the project legal \nagreements. \nC.  Sustainability \n \n23.  Output 1 is sustainable because the child grant top-ups will augment the current child \ngrant budget, and it is anticipated that the government will continuously provide social protection \nthrough the government\u2019s annual budget allocations. To ensure the sustainability of IT systems \nunder output 2, the loan agreement will include an assurance that the MLSP will propose in its \nbudget submission, and the government will allocate, adequate budgetary resources to cover the \nrecurrent costs associated with operation and maintenance of the IT systems to be financed under \nthe project. An impact evaluation of the graduation approach across multiple country contexts \nconfirms  the  sustainability  of  impacts  long  after  program  interventions  end  (footnote  16). \nContinued policy dialogue on social welfare system development, including the targeting and \nconsolidation of programs, will take place through the ongoing ADB TA (footnote 19), working \nclosely with development partners including UNICEF and the World Bank. The high capacity and \ncommitment  of  the  executing  agency,  demonstrated  in  previous  ADB  social  protection \ninvestments, will also ensure sustainability. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n24.  A financial management assessment evaluated the capacity of the MLSP and the PIU, \nwhich handles the project financial management arrangements. The review considered recent \ngovernance assessments and the implementation experience of the MLSP\u2019s current projects. The \nassessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate mainly because the MLSP and \nthe PIU have adequate financial management systems in place and experience in implementing \nADB-funded projects. Detailed mitigation measures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \n25.  Procurement. The procurement of goods, non-consulting, and consulting services will \nfollow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The MLSP and the PIU \nhave procurement experience in ADB projects, following ADB requirements and government \nregulations, and have demonstrated their capacity under previous projects. Advance action will \nbe applied. \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MLSP.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \n ", "10 \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  Extensive poverty, social, and gender benefits. About 80% of the population and 64% \nof Mongolia\u2019s households will immediately benefit from the project, through the top-up of the \nmonthly cash grants for 1.2 million children. In the medium term, poor and vulnerable households \nwill benefit from being accurately identified in the updated poverty targeting system. All social \nwelfare program beneficiaries will benefit from streamlined processes to apply for and receive \nbenefits through the expanded \u201ce-welfare\u201d system. The graduation program, pilot-tested with \nabout 1,520 poor beneficiaries (at least 50% of whom will be women), will (i) deliver a holistic set \nof interventions to promote economic inclusion, strengthen resilience, and reduce poverty; and \n(ii) contribute to the evidence base for policy makers on new approaches to social protection \nsystem strengthening. \n \n28.  Gender analysis during project preparation identified several key gender issues related to \nthe impact of the pandemic. The United Nations Development Programme survey (footnote 7) \nrevealed that the average monthly income per person in households headed by women was lower \nthan in households headed by men, and declined significantly after the government declared a \nstate of heightened alert and preparedness. Women have been more exposed to a loss of \nemployment and a decrease in wages. The survey also found that, because of the additional \nburden of taking care of children not in school, income loss, and worry about the risk of an \noutbreak, women were more likely to experience psychological stress related to COVID-19 \ncompared with men. Physical distancing and quarantine measures have clear implications on the \ndistribution and intensity of unpaid care work, which was already disproportionately done by \nwomen and girls. UNICEF technical guidance on gender-responsive social protection during \nCOVID-19 confirms that child grants are an effective measure to help address this growing unpaid \ncare crisis,29 which makes the project inherently gender-responsive. ADB collaborated with \nUNICEF on a November 2020 survey that found that mothers are the custodians of children\u2019s \ngrant accounts in 85.6% of households and are the primary decision makers when it comes to \nspending the child grants in 76.6% of households, making joint decisions with their husbands in \na further 7.7% of households.30 Women\u2019s decision-making power over the use of the grants has \nincreased slightly since the top-ups were introduced. The project is categorized effective gender \nmainstreaming, and includes gender targets and indicators that comprise (i) maintaining women\u2019s \ncontrol over the increased child grants to meet their families\u2019 needs, and (ii) ensuring that 50% of \nthe graduation pilot beneficiaries are women. A gender action plan is included to monitor gender \ntargets.  \n \nF.  Safeguards  \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.31 \n \n30.  Environment (category C). The project activities do not include civil works and will have \nno adverse environmental impacts. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C).
