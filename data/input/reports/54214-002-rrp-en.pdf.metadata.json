Mongolia took early and decisive action starting in January 2020 \nto prevent the outbreak of COVID-19. However, while the direct health impact was initially limited, \neconomic data and several rapid assessments confirm that the socioeconomic consequences of \nthe  virus  containment  efforts\u2014including  border  closures,  trade  disruptions,  and  school  and \nbusiness closures\u2014have been substantial.2 The economy contracted by 5.3% in 2020, indicating \nthe  worst  economic  recession  since  1992.3  The  contraction  has  been  driven  by  a  significant \ndecline in mining, transport, trade, and construction. The resulting household-level shocks can be \nsevere and long-lasting, particularly on the poor and vulnerable. As early as May 2020, (i) nearly \nthree-quarters of all Mongolian households and 85% of poor households reported experiencing \nsome sort of economic shock, (ii) nearly two-thirds (64%) of all households reported an increase \nin food prices, (iii) nearly three-quarters (73%) of self-employed workers experienced income loss, \nand (iv) 70% of farmers and herder households reported a decline in income compared with the \nprevious  year.4  The  impact  of  the  pandemic  became  more  acute  in  Mongolia  with  the  first \ncommunity  transmission  recorded  in  November  2020,  causing  the  government  to  issue  strict \nlockdown orders from 12 November 2020 to 11 January 2021 and again from 11 to 23 February \n2021. \n \n4. \nPre-crisis poverty. The pre-crisis poverty rate was already high at 28.4% in a population \nof 3.24 million, but this national average conceals important differences by location, sex, and age. \nThe  poverty  rate  is  significantly  higher  among  urban  households  headed  by  women  (32.4%), \nhouseholds living in the country's eastern region (37.4%), and among very young children aged \n0\u20134 (38.0%).5 Childhood poverty is widespread: children under the age of 15 comprise 42% of \nthe  country's  nearly  905,000  poor  people,  while  52%  live  in  households  with  more  than  three \nchildren. A large share of Mongolians who are technically nonpoor live precariously close to the \n\n \n\n1  The project is included in ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2021. Manila.

Increasing the poverty line by half (from MNT166,580 to MNT249,870 per capita per \nmonth) nearly doubles the poverty rate to 55.7% (footnote 5). Mongolia's experience of both past \ncrises and the COVID-19 pandemic confirms the risk of negative coping strategies. These include \nselling  productive  assets,  reducing  consumption  levels,  or  making  harmful  choices  regarding \ninvestment in education, health, and livelihoods, all of which can impact long-term well-being.6 In \nMay  2020,  27%  of  households  reported  that  their  food  consumption  had  declined,  with \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  being  much  more  likely  to  report  decreased  food  consumption \n(41.0%) than those headed by men (22.5%).7 \n \n5. \nMongolia's  effective  social  protection  response.  To  mitigate  the  impact  of  the \npandemic,  the  government  issued  a  robust  package  of  measures  worth  about  1.5%  of  gross \ndomestic product to stimulate the economy and extend social protection. The first set of measures \nimplemented  from  April  to  September  2020  included  five  key  interventions:  (i)  exempting  all \nbusiness entities from social insurance contributions for 6 months, which benefitted employers as \nwell  as  paid  employees  and  self-employed  people  who  make  voluntary  contributions; \n(ii) exempting  citizens  from  personal  income  tax  on  salaries  for  6  months  (excluding  civil \nservants);  (iii)  exempting  smaller  companies  (with  income  lower  than  MNT1.5  billion)  from \ncorporate income tax for 6 months; (iv) paying entities that kept employees on the payroll despite \nweakening  operations  a  monthly  allowance  of  MNT200,000  per  employee  from  April  to \nJune 2020;  and  (v)  increasing  monthly  child  grants  under  the  universal  child  money  program \n(CMP) to MNT100,000 (from the basic benefit of MNT20,000). From May 2020, added measures \nincluded doubling the monthly food stamps targeted at the poorest households and increasing \nsocial welfare pensions by MNT100,000 for highly vulnerable groups (persons with disabilities, \nolder  persons  without  other  pensions,  orphans,  and  single  parents  with  many  children).  A \nsubsequent set of measures covering October\u2013December 2020 continued some of these policies \nand measures and suspended others.8 \n \n6. \nA microsimulation analysis shows that both inequality and poverty would have increased \nsignificantly without these measures (footnote 2), which appear to have not only counteracted the \nnegative  effects  but  may  also  have  reduced  poverty  from  the  pre-pandemic  baseline  level. \nBecause of the high rate of child poverty and the large number of children in poor households, \nthe  child  grants  alone  reduced  both  poverty  and  inequality  (para.  18),  reaching  64%  of  the \ncountry's households, comprising 80% of the population. On the strength of this result, and with \nthe crisis worsening as of November 2020 and prolonged socioeconomic impacts expected, the \ngovernment approved the extension of the child grant top-ups from January to June 2021. \n \nGlobal  social  protection  lessons.  Mongolia's  emphasis  on  social  assistance  in  its \n7. \nCOVID-19  response  is  in  keeping  with  global  practice.  As  of  September  2020,  virtually  all \ncountries  and  territories  (212)  had  planned,  introduced,  or  adapted  1,179  social  protection \nprograms in response to COVID-19; the majority were social assistance transfers (724 measures, \nor 61.4% of the total).9 About 51% of these safety net measures (and 31% of global measures) \nwere cash-based transfers in 158 countries, as in Mongolia. During a crisis, expanding support \nusing existing programs and their infrastructure, such as targeting and delivery systems, is more \n\n \n\n6  ADB. 2018.

Social \ninsurance contributions were no longer waived, but paid at a reduced rate of 5% by both employers and employees. \nSmaller companies continued to be exempted from corporate income tax until the end of 2020. \n\n9  U.

Mongolia's Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) \nused its food stamp program in this way during the financial crisis in 2017, as well as both food \nstamps and child grants in the initial response to the pandemic in 2020, supported by ADB under \nthe  first  Shock-Responsive  Social  Protection  Project (para.  13).10  International  lessons  include \nthe importance of strengthening poverty targeting and social welfare delivery systems to be ready \nto  respond  when  crises  hit.  Poverty  is  dynamic,  but  Mongolia's  poverty  targeting  database  is \nseveral  years  out  of  date.  Timely  data  updating,  operational  capacity,  and  limited  use  across \nprograms  are  challenges  for  the  system's  sustainability  and  effectiveness.  COVID-19  has  also \nunderscored  the  need  to  develop  shock-responsive  systems  and  programs  that  help  address \nmultidimensional poverty, support the longer-term recovery process, and increase resilience to \nfuture shocks. Global impact evaluation evidence confirms that an innovative approach to social \nprotection  that  combines  cash  support  with  a  more  holistic  set  of  livelihood  and  coaching \ninterventions  can  address  multiple  facets  of  deprivation  and  help  poor  people  diversify  their \nincome sources sustainably, and ultimately become more resilient in the context of shocks (para. \n21).11  \n \nStrategic alignment. The project is aligned with the April 2020 ADB policy paper, which \n8. \nemphasizes that the scope and scale of the ongoing crisis make it imperative for ADB to step up \nsupport to developing member countries to combat the effects of the pandemic.12 Strengthening \nsocial  protection  systems  and  service  delivery  is  a  fundamental  element  of  both  ADB's          \nCOVID-19  response  and  ADB's  Strategy  2030  operational  priority  1  (addressing  remaining \npoverty and reducing inequalities). The project also addresses operational priority 2 (accelerating \nprogress  in  gender  equality)  and  is  aligned  with  several  Sustainable  Development  Goals  that \ninclude social protection targets.13 \n \nB. \n \n9. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with the  following  impact: adverse  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic reduced (footnote 12). The project will have the following outcome: social \nwelfare support for the poor and vulnerable, especially women and children, enhanced.14 \n \n10. \nOutput 1: Pro-poor child grant top-ups delivered. Output 1 will finance a share of the \nextended shock-responsive increase in the monthly child grant benefits for an additional 6 months \n(January\u2013June  2021),  following  on  from  the  earlier  top-ups  supported  under  the  emergency \nassistance  loan  from  April  to  September  2020.  The  CMP  provides  universal  cash  grants to  all \nchildren aged 0\u201317 as long as the children are registered in the Integrated Household Database \n(IHD).  Payments  are  made  electronically,  directly  to  accounts  set  up  in  children's  names,  with \nmothers as the account custodians in 85.6% of households. Before the top-ups, in March 2020, \n1,107,130 children (about 93% of all children) received child grants of MNT20,000 per month. A \nmother of three children under 18 would have received about $21.50 (about 7.2% of the monthly \npoverty line for a family of five) to support her children's needs. As of November 2020, 1,184,158 \nchildren (comprising 48.2% girls, and 97.6% of all children) received the topped-up child grants \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n10 An ADB emergency assistance loan of $26.4 million supported the first round of Mongolia\u2019s food stamp and child \ngrant  top-ups  from  April  to  September  2020,  with  99.05%  disbursement  as  of  December  2020.

To improve household \nresilience and the government\u2019s response to future crises, output 2 will finance activities in three \nkey areas: (i) updating the poverty targeting system and the IHD with more accurate data to be \nbetter able to reach people in need through support for the next round of the proxy means test \nsurvey based on a new methodology, (ii) supporting the digitization of social welfare programs \ninto the \"e-welfare\" system to streamline benefit and service delivery, and (iii) pilot testing and \nevaluating the graduation approach as an innovative type of social protection program that builds \non cash transfers with a holistic set of livelihood and coaching interventions. Also described as \neconomic  inclusion  or  \"big  push\"  programs,16  the  pilot  test  covering  at  least  1,500  poor \nhouseholds  (participants  in  the  food  stamp  program  and/or  CMP)  will  include  rigorous  impact \nevaluation  to  strengthen  the  evidence  base  on  what  works  for  lasting  poverty  reduction  in \nMongolia.17  New  impact  evaluation  evidence  confirms  that  graduation  programs  have  made \nhouseholds more resilient in the context of the COVID-19 shock (para. 21). \n \nC. \n \n12. \nADB  will  leverage  sector  experience,  expertise,  partner  resources,  and  technical \nassistance (TA) to deliver shock-responsive social protection. ADB has been a leading partner in \nthe development of Mongolia\u2019s social protection system since 1994, through a series of loans, \ngrants,  and  TA  projects.18  ADB  supported  the  introduction  of  the  poverty  targeting  system        \n(para.  19)  and  the  design  and  rollout  of  the  food  stamp  program  as  part  of  the  government's \neffective response to the 2009 food and fuel crisis. Based on this experience, ADB was able to \nrespond swiftly with the emergency assistance loan to support the child grant and food stamp top-\nups in June 2020. The proposed project will access the resources and experts from ongoing TA \nto strengthen the social welfare system.19 The TA outputs include (i) improving the capacity of \nsocial workers and social welfare policy and decision makers; and (ii) supporting social welfare \nresearch, policy dialogue, and advocacy. The TA team produced a well-received assessment of \nMongolia's  social  protection  response  to  COVID-19 (footnote  2)  and  has  coordinated  with  the \nUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on a forthcoming assessment of the vertical expansion \nof  child  grants  and  food  stamps,  including  a  gender  impact  assessment.  A  series  of  planned \nknowledge  products  will  contribute  to  the  dialogue  on  improving  targeting,  consolidating \nprograms,  building  more  permanent  shock-responsive  mechanisms,  and  strengthening  social \nprotection to promote resilience, thus contributing to the longer-term reform objectives that ADB \nhas been supporting. \n \n\n \n\n15 This broadly matches the sex ratio of Mongolian children confirmed by the National Statistics Office of Mongolia data \nfor 2019, showing children aged 0\u201319 as 51.1% boys and 48.9% girls. The imbalance is more pronounced among \nchildren aged 0\u20134, at 51.3% boys and 48.7% girls.  \n\n16 A. Bannerjee, E. Duflo, and G. Sharma. 2020.

Before the pandemic, social transfers \nreduced poverty in Mongolia by 1.3 percentage points from 2016 to 2018, more than any other \nfactor  including  farm  income  (footnote  5).  Evidence  confirms  the  effectiveness  of  the  CMP  in \nreducing  poverty.  Analysis  of  the  2016  household  socioeconomic  survey  revealed  that,  in  the \nabsence of the child grants, the child poverty rate would have been 5 percentage points higher.23 \nAssessing  the  impact  of  the  government's  2020  pandemic  response,  ADB's  microsimulation \nreport estimates that the pandemic-induced economic recession could have increased poverty to \n36.7%, but social protection measures reduced poverty to 17.6% (footnote 2). The two measures \nwith  the  largest  budgets  are  the  social  insurance  contribution  and  income tax  waivers  and the \nchild  grant  top-ups.  Comparing  their  effects,  if  the  only  policy  response  were  the  waivers,  the \nshare of people falling below the poverty line would be 30.5%. This is lower than the poverty rate \nunder  the  pandemic  effect,  but  higher  than  the  pre-pandemic  scenario.  However,  the  effect  of \nonly the child grant top-ups is a drop in poverty to 24.9%. In other words, the child grant top-ups \nalone could compensate for the poverty effect of the pandemic. Because they disproportionally \nreach  poorer  households,  child  grants  also  reduce  inequality  (unlike  the  waivers,  which \ndisproportionally benefit better off households). With the child grant top-up alone, it is estimated \nthat the Gini coefficient would decrease to 0.307, while the waivers alone would increase the Gini \ncoefficient to 0.342 (against a pre-pandemic baseline of 0.327). \n \n19. \nPoverty targeting. Eligibility for some social welfare programs is means-tested. The proxy \nmeans  test  methodology  was  initially  developed  with  ADB  support,24  and  the  World  Bank  has \nbeen closely involved in updating the methodology and building capacity in an attempt to reduce \nerrors of exclusion and inclusion. Child grants are targeted at all children aged 0\u201317. The benefits \nare universal, but conditional on being registered in the IHD. Child grants have been targeted in \nvarious  ways  and  at  various  times  in  the  past.  During  the  2017  financial  crisis,  ADB  and \ndevelopment partners recommended that they be targeted at the poorest 60% of children in the \nIHD. This was done for several months, but as the poverty situation worsened, the government \nproposed to extend the grants to target 80% of children. The International Monetary Fund and \ndevelopment partners agreed that the fiscal implications of this change were minimal, increasing \n\n23 International  Labour  Organization  (ILO)  and  UNICEF.  2019.

Mongolia: Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Program and Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\ffiscal expenditure by $22.8 million, or 0.58% of total fiscal expenditure in 2017.25 In the present \ncontext of high vulnerability, the potential gains from targeting are likely reduced because so many \npeople are in danger of falling into poverty as a result of the pandemic.26 A universal crisis such \nas COVID-19 calls for a universal response, but the government recognizes that, in the future, it \nwill be necessary to consider how to better target benefits for maximum poverty reduction impact. \n \n20. \nBuilding resilience through shock-responsive social protection. Social protection by \ndefinition has the objective of reducing vulnerability. Social assistance (non-contributory transfers) \nis  particularly  effective  at  protecting  poor  people's  income  from  both  idiosyncratic  shocks  that \naffect  individual  households  (illness  and  job  loss),  and  covariate  shocks  that  affect  almost \neveryone  (financial  crisis,  pandemic,  and  natural  disaster).  Increasing  cash  transfers  in \nanticipation of, during, or after a shock helps poor and vulnerable households meet their basic \nneeds, cushions the impact of shocks, and reduces the pressure to engage in coping strategies \nthat weaken long-term adaptive capacity. Support before an event reduces risk while support after \nan event facilitates effective recovery (footnote 6). The project will help ensure that the population \nis not rendered more vulnerable to future disasters, including the dzud (a severe winter resulting \nin livestock deaths) or other shocks as a consequence of adverse coping mechanisms adopted \nin response to COVID-19. Evidence from the food and fuel crisis regarding the time required for \nrecovery  demonstrates  that  lower-income  groups  took  significantly  longer  to  recover.  Shock-\nresponsive transfers act as bridging assistance to help maintain development gains. \n \n21. \nEffectiveness of the graduation approach. ADB has supported the design, testing, and \nrigorous  evaluation  of  the  graduation  approach  since  2016,  collaborating  with  BRAC  and \nInnovations  for  Poverty  Action.  A  November  2020  impact  evaluation  of  ADB's  program  in  the \nPhilippines  confirms  a  range  of  positive  impacts  in  the  context  of  coping  with  COVID-19: \ncompared with a control group of households that only received cash transfers, the graduation \nprogram  participants  had  diversified  livelihoods  and  increased  household  resilience  across \nseveral  dimensions  including  financial  security,  food  security,  and  mental  health  during  the \nquarantine period.27 In addition, graduation program households were less likely than those in the \ncontrol  group  to  reduce  food  consumption,  skip  health  care  visits,  or  send  children  to  work  in \nresponse  to  the  pandemic-induced  economic  disruption.  These  initial  results  contribute  to  the \nglobal evidence base that the holistic graduation approach has the potential to support poor and \nvulnerable households in diverse settings and challenging circumstances to build resilience and \nembark on a pathway out of poverty. Diversification is one of the major challenges in Mongolia \nand an underlying cause of vulnerability, particularly for poor households. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n22. \nAssessing  the  economic  viability  of  the  program  requires  establishing  the  economic \ncosts.28 A cash transfer is an economic transfer within society, and thus has no direct economic \ncosts. Only the administrative costs of transfer payments are considered economic costs. Since \nthe project will utilize existing child grant delivery infrastructure (e.g., the targeting system and the \n100% electronic payment system directly to bank accounts) and provide only a top-up to existing \nbenefits, the marginal costs for distributing the child grants will be negligible. A standard cost\u2013\n\n \n\n25 ADB. 2020. Completion Report: Social Welfare Support Program Phase 2 in Mongolia. Manila.

For  this  project,  the  most \nimportant benefits are not directly quantifiable in economic terms. However, it is clear that these \nunconditional  transfers  will  help  the  recipients  maintain  adequate  consumption.  Since  poor \nhouseholds have a higher consumption propensity than the general population, this redistributive \nmeasure will help cushion the decline in consumption and gross domestic product growth. Based \non  the  government's  commitment  to  providing  a  temporary  shock-responsive  top-up  until          \nJune 2021, and a return to the base payment on an ongoing basis thereafter, and the relatively \nimmaterial impact on the government's budget, the project is considered financially sustainable. \nThe  Government  Action Plan,  2020\u20132024  and the  update to the  Social Welfare  Law,  2012  for \napproval by Parliament in 2021 both confirm that social protection remains a priority, and there is \nstrong government commitment to improving poverty targeting in the future. To ensure that social \nwelfare  is  continuously  allocated  with  a  budget,  an  assurance  is  included  in  the  project  legal \nagreements. \n\nSustainability \n\nC. \n \nOutput  1  is  sustainable  because  the  child  grant  top-ups  will  augment  the  current  child \n23. \ngrant budget, and it is anticipated that the government will continuously provide social protection \nthrough the government\u2019s annual budget allocations. To ensure the sustainability of IT systems \nunder output 2, the loan agreement will include an assurance that the MLSP will propose in its \nbudget submission, and the government will allocate, adequate budgetary resources to cover the \nrecurrent costs associated with operation and maintenance of the IT systems to be financed under \nthe  project.  An  impact  evaluation  of  the  graduation  approach  across  multiple  country  contexts \nconfirms  the  sustainability  of  impacts  long  after  program  interventions  end  (footnote  16). \nContinued  policy  dialogue  on  social  welfare  system  development,  including  the  targeting  and \nconsolidation  of  programs,  will  take  place through  the  ongoing  ADB  TA (footnote  19),  working \nclosely with development partners including UNICEF and the World Bank. The high capacity and \ncommitment  of  the  executing  agency,  demonstrated  in  previous  ADB  social  protection \ninvestments, will also ensure sustainability. \n \nD. \n \nA financial management assessment evaluated the capacity of the MLSP and the PIU, \n24. \nwhich  handles  the  project  financial  management  arrangements.  The  review  considered  recent \ngovernance assessments and the implementation experience of the MLSP\u2019s current projects. The \nassessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate mainly because the MLSP and \nthe PIU have adequate financial management systems in place and experience in implementing \nADB-funded projects. Detailed mitigation measures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \nProcurement.

The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nE. \n \n27. \nExtensive poverty, social, and gender benefits. About 80% of the population and 64% \nof  Mongolia\u2019s  households  will  immediately  benefit  from  the  project,  through  the  top-up  of  the \nmonthly cash grants for 1.2 million children. In the medium term, poor and vulnerable households \nwill  benefit  from  being  accurately  identified  in  the  updated  poverty  targeting  system.  All  social \nwelfare  program  beneficiaries  will  benefit  from  streamlined  processes  to  apply  for  and  receive \nbenefits  through  the  expanded  \u201ce-welfare\u201d  system.  The  graduation  program,  pilot-tested  with \nabout 1,520 poor beneficiaries (at least 50% of whom will be women), will (i) deliver a holistic set \nof interventions to promote economic inclusion, strengthen resilience, and reduce poverty; and \n(ii) contribute  to  the  evidence  base  for  policy  makers  on  new  approaches  to  social  protection \nsystem strengthening. \n \n28. \nGender analysis during project preparation identified several key gender issues related to \nthe  impact  of  the  pandemic.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  survey (footnote  7) \nrevealed that the average monthly income per person in households headed by women was lower \nthan in households headed by men, and declined significantly after the government declared a \nstate  of  heightened  alert  and  preparedness.  Women  have  been  more  exposed  to  a  loss  of \nemployment  and  a  decrease  in  wages.  The  survey  also  found  that,  because  of  the  additional \nburden  of  taking  care  of  children  not  in  school,  income  loss,  and  worry  about  the  risk  of  an \noutbreak,  women  were  more  likely  to  experience  psychological  stress  related  to  COVID-19 \ncompared with men. Physical distancing and quarantine measures have clear implications on the \ndistribution  and  intensity  of  unpaid  care  work,  which  was  already  disproportionately  done  by \nwomen  and  girls.  UNICEF  technical  guidance  on  gender-responsive  social  protection  during \nCOVID-19 confirms that child grants are an effective measure to help address this growing unpaid \ncare  crisis,29  which  makes  the  project  inherently  gender-responsive.  ADB  collaborated  with \nUNICEF  on  a  November  2020 survey that  found  that mothers  are the  custodians  of children\u2019s \ngrant accounts in 85.6% of households and are the primary decision makers when it comes to \nspending the child grants in 76.6% of households, making joint decisions with their husbands in \na further 7.7% of households.30 Women\u2019s decision-making power over the use of the grants has \nincreased slightly since the top-ups were introduced. The project is categorized effective gender \nmainstreaming, and includes gender targets and indicators that comprise (i) maintaining women\u2019s \ncontrol over the increased child grants to meet their families\u2019 needs, and (ii) ensuring that 50% of \nthe graduation pilot beneficiaries are women.
