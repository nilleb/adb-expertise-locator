The  capacity\nbuilding  components  of  the  Project  will  build  the  capability\nof the Executing Agency, Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC) to\nprovide  an  efficient  service  to  its  customers,  and  create  a\ncreditworthy utility attractive to private investors.\n\nPrimary Objective:  Economic Growth\nEnvironmental  Category  B:  An \ninitial  environmental\nexamination  was  undertaken;  the  summary  is  a  core\nappendix.\n\nThe  Project  forms  part  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s\n(ADB)  strategy  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  objective  to\nreduce  poverty,  which  predominates  in  semi-urban  and\nrural  areas.  Rural  development  is  correlated  with  the\nabsorptive capacity of urban economies for increased rural\nproduce.  Economic  growth  in  the  provincial  towns  is\nconstrained  by \ninadequate  and  high-priced  electricity\nsystems. The Project will reduce one of those constraints in\nselected  areas  and  spur  investment  in  more  productive\ncapacity in small and medium-size enterprises. While there\nare a number of private electricity suppliers in the country,\nthey are of an extremely low caliber, very small scale, and\nuse second-hand equipment. Without external intervention,\nthe  needed  improvements  in  electricity  supply  are  unlikely\nto materialize.\n\nThe  objectives  are  to  (i)  expand  the  availability  of  reliable\npower supplies in eight provincial towns at an average tariff\nlower  than  that  presently  being  charged;  (ii)  build  capacity\nby  creating  suitable  management,  operation,  and\nmaintenance  organizations  in  the  provincial  centers  so  the\nnew  systems  are  efficient  and  financially  viable,  and\ntherefore attractive to private investors for future expansion;\n(iii) strengthen  the  skills  in  EDC\u2019s  head  office  (which  will\nremain  responsible  for  about  90  percent  of  EDC  sales);\n(iv) improve  the  training  available  at  EDC's  ADB-funded\nTraining  Center  in  Phnom  Penh;  and  (v)  gather  data  on\nwhich to base future hydropower development.\n\n\fiii\n\nThe Project has two components.\n\nPart  A,  Infrastructure.  Replacement  and  extension  of  the\nelectricity  distribution  systems  in  eight  provincial  towns;  in\nfive  of  these,  new  diesel  generators  will  be  provided  to\nmeet  forecast  demand  up  to  the  end  of  2006.  Two  other\nto  existing  or  proposed\ntowns  will  be  connected \ntransmission lines.\n\nthe  provincial  power  systems, \n\nPart B, Capacity Building. The capacity building component\nwill (i) establish and make operational, through provision of\nequipment  and  training,  the  organizations  that  will  operate\nand  manage \ninitially\nbranches  of  EDC;  and  (ii) strengthen  the  capability  of  the\nEDC  head  office  by  providing \nfinancial\nmanagement  and  contract  preparation  for  private  sector\nparticipation; and providing trainers and facilities for EDC\u2019s\ntraining  center  in  Phnom  Penh,  and  for  the  Hydropower\nDepartment  of  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy\n(MIME).\n\ntraining \n\nin \n\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $24.2  million  equivalent,\ncomprising  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $12.1  million  and\nlocal currency costs of $12.1 million equivalent.\n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  of  up  to  $18.6  million  equivalent\nwill  finance  77  percent  of  the  total  project  cost  including\n$6.5  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The\nGovernment  is  seeking  parallel  cofinancing  from  Agence\nFrancaise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  of  about  $2.5  million\non  a  grant  basis  to  cover  $1.7  million  of  the  foreign\nexchange cost plus $0.8 million equivalent of local currency\ncosts.  If  AFD  financing  materializes  within  six  months  of\nloan  effectiveness,  the  Borrower  will  request  ADB  to\nreallocate  or  cancel  a  corresponding  portion  of  the  loan\nfunds.\n\nSource\n\nADB\nEDC and Government\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n12.1\n0.0\n12.1\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n6.5\n5.6\n12.1\n\nTotal\nCost\n18.6\n5.6\n24.2\n\nPercent\n\n77\n23\n100\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, EDC = Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nLoan Amount\nand Terms\n\nADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  up  to  SDR14.379  million\n(equivalent \nits  Special  Funds\nresources, on standard terms.\n\nto  $18.6  million) \n\nfrom \n\nPeriod of Utilization\n\nUntil 31 December 2004.\n\nExecuting Agency\n\nElectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge\n\n\fImplementation\nArrangements\n\nProcurement\n\nConsulting Services\n\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date\n\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries\n\niv\n\nEDC will set up a project implementation unit (PIU) headed\nby  a  senior  staff  member  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PIU  will\ncoordinate  project  implementation  within  EDC  and  MIME,\nand  will  be  the  channel  of  communication  with  ADB.  The\nPIU will be based at EDC headquarters in Phnom Penh, but\nuse  will  be  made  of  MIME  provincial  offices  during  design\nand implementation phases as required.\n\nAll  procurement  financed  by  ADB  will  be  undertaken  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  Each\ncontract  for  supply  of  goods  and  services  and  civil  works\ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  and\n$1 million  equivalent  respectively  will  be  awarded  on  the\nturnkey\nbasis  of \ncontract will be used to procure the diesel generating sets,\nand a supply of goods and related services contract will be\nused for the distribution systems.\n\ninternational  competitive  bidding.  A \n\nConsultants  will  be  recruited  and  supervised  by  EDC  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for\nthe  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  consultants\nwill be required to design the facilities in the selected towns,\nassist  with  tender  evaluation,  supervise  construction,  and\nassist with planning and monitoring of the capacity building\ncomponents  of  the  Project.  A  total  of  23  person-months  of\ninternational and 25 person-months of domestic consultants\nwill be required.\n\n30 June 2004.\n\nOver  100,000  persons  in  21,000  households  will  receive  a\nmuch  improved  electricity  service.  In  addition,  from  2004-\n2010,  about  70,000  persons  in  13,000  households  will\nreceive  a  power  supply  for  the  first  time.  The  average\nplanned  tariff  three  years  after  project  commissioning  will\nbe  about  24  percent  lower  than  the  existing  average  tariff.\nAbout 30 percent of the direct beneficiaries are living below\nthe  poverty  line  (according  to  the  Cambodian  definition),\nwhich  is  about  the  same  proportion  as  in  the  population\nnationally.  Over  100  staff  will  be  recruited  and  trained  in\nEnglish,  computing,  and  financial  and  management  skills;\nand  employed  to  operate  the  new  systems.  In addition  to\nthe direct beneficiaries, the rural population surrounding the\nproject  towns  will  benefit  by  having  access  to  a  growing\nmarket  for  their  produce.  The  estimated  economic  internal\nrate  of  return  for  the  Project  is  17.8  percent  and  the\nfinancial rate of return is 4.2 percent.\n\n\fv\n\n\fI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  a  proposed\n\n1.\nloan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Power Supply Project.\n\nI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  recommenced  lending  to  Cambodia  in  1992,  and\ninitially  focused  on  the  provision  of  emergency  generating  and  distribution  facilities  in  Phnom\nPenh.1 This was followed by rehabilitation of the electricity systems in Phnom Penh and the two\nimportant  provincial  towns  of  Sihanoukville  and  Siem  Reap.2  The  Project  will  (i)  expand  and\nreplace  the  inadequate  electricity  generation  and  distribution  systems  in  eight  additional\nprovincial  capital  towns,  thereby  removing  a  constraint  on  economic  growth  in  the  towns  and\nrural hinterlands; and (ii) build the capacity of the Executing Agency, Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge\n(EDC),  to  provide  efficient  service  to  its  customers.  The  Project  is  included in  ADB\u2019s  lending\nprogram  for  2000  and  was  prepared  under  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)3  completed  in\nApril 1998. Due to changes in political and economic circumstances in 1997 and 1998, the study\nfindings were updated under a small-scale TA.4 Loan appraisal5 was carried out from 20 July to\n4 August 2000. This report is based on the findings of the TA reports and information provided\nby the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) and EDC. The project framework is given\nin Appendix 1.\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1. \n\nThe Energy Sector\n\nCambodia is a predominately rural society emerging from a long period of conflict. With\n3.\nrenewed  stability  and  steady  progress  on  reforms  to  gain  the  confidence  of  international  aid\nagencies,  public  investment  should  be  sustained  at  levels  sufficient  to  stimulate  annual\neconomic growth of about 6.0\u20137.0 percent, which with population growth of about 2.5 percent,\ntranslates into 3.5\u20134.5 percent per capita income growth. Agricultural productivity should begin\nto  rise  with  priority  public  investments  in  rural  infrastructure,  and  growth  in  tourism  can  be\nexpected  in  selected  areas.  The  greatest  uncertainty  pertains  to  the  level  of  industrial  growth,\nwhich depends largely on foreign investment. Gross value added in industry has grown robustly\nin  the  last  three  years  (averaging  13.5  percent  per  year)  but  may  slow  in  the  short  term  as\ngarment  quotas  take  hold.  In  the  provincial  towns,  as  agricultural  productivity  and  per  capita\nincomes  rise,  demand  for  electricity  from  residential  customers  and  small  enterprises  will\nsteadily increase.\n\n                                                          \n1  Loan 1199-CAM(SF):  Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project, for $67.7 million, approved on 26 November 1992.\n2 Loan 1345-CAM(SF):  Power Rehabilitation Project, for $28.2 million, approved on 15 December 1994.\n3  TA 2629-CAM:  Power Rehabilitation II Project, for $450,000, approved on 20 August 1996.\n4  TA  3256-CAM:  Update  of  Power  Rehabilitation  II  Project  Preparation  Study,  for  $150,000,  approved  on\n\n17 September 1999.\n\n5 The  Appraisal  Mission  comprised  M.  Bristol,  Project  Engineer  and  Mission  Leader;  C.S.  Chung,  Environmental\nSpecialist;  E.  Fischer,  Counsel;  S.H.  Kho,  Financial  Analyst;  J.  Kuiper,  Senior  Project  Economist;  I.  Simbolon,\nSocial Development Specialist; and P. Cordukes, Financial Analyst/Consultant.\n\n\f2\n\nThe  country  has  two  indigenous  sources  of  energy,  i.e.,  biomass,  which  provides\n4.\n85 percent  of  the  present  energy  consumption,  and  hydropower,  which  has  hardly  been\ndeveloped.  There  is  a  1  megawatt  (MW)  hydropower  plant  serving  Banlung,  the  capital  of\nRattanakiri Province, and a dam at Kirirom, which is all that remains serviceable of an 11 MW\nhydropower  project  located  about  120  kilometers  (km)  west  of  Phnom  Penh.  The  balance  of\nenergy  demand  is  supplied  by  imported  petroleum  products.6  The  consumption  of  primary\nenergy  for  domestic  and  light  industry,  transport,  and  electricity  production  is  87  percent,\n9 percent, and 4 percent.\n\n5.\nImports  of  petroleum  products  in  1999  were  valued  at  approximately  $150  million  or\n16 percent of total imports. This makes petroleum products the single largest import by value.\nFor  the  first  quarter  of  2000,  petroleum  product  imports  were  estimated  at  $45  million,\n27 percent higher than the first quarter of 1999 and 19 percent of total imports. Clearly, rising oil\nprices are increasing the burden of energy costs on the economy. However, this is not likely to\npresent  a  serious  balance  of  payments  problem  in  the  foreseeable  future.  Even  as  oil  prices\nwere  increasing,  international  reserves  have  been  rising  in  2000,  and  are  currently  over\n$450 million  or  about  3.5  months  of  imports.  Moreover,  the  Government  has  had  a  quite\nconservative macroeconomic policy over the last few years. The International Monetary Fund is\nwatching  the  balance  of  payments  position  closely  and  is  sufficiently  satisfied  with  its\nmanagement by Government to have recently released the second tranche of the facility under\na Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program.\n\n6.\nThe major energy source nationwide is fuelwood, which is used for cooking by most of\nthe  population,  and  almost  exclusively  by  the  rural  population.  Kerosene  is  used  by\nnonelectrified  households  for  lighting,  mainly  in  the  countryside,  and  cooking  in  urban  areas.\nThe number of liquefied petroleum gas stoves is believed to be increasing in Phnom Penh, but\nthe  cost  of  gas  cylinders  and  new  stoves  is  an  impediment  to  widespread  proliferation  of  this\nrelatively  clean  fuel.  Liquefied  petroleum  gas  represents  only  about  0.2  percent  of  national\nenergy requirements.\n\n2. \n\nThe Electricity Subsector\n\na. \n\nGeneral Structure\n\n7.\nThe  electricity  sector,  never  more  than  rudimentary,  and  completely  destroyed  by  20\nyears  of  war,  is  making  progress  on  the  path  to  normality.  However,  the  obstacles  are\nformidable. Responsibility for coordination of electricity sector policy and planning rests with the\nEnergy  General  Directorate  of  MIME.  Three  of  the  Energy  Departments  have  direct\nresponsibility  for  electricity  sector  planning,  i.e.,  the  Hydropower,  Solar  Photovoltaics,  and\nProvincial Electricity departments. The latter formerly had operational responsibility for provision\nof electricity in 17 provinces.\n\n8.\nUntil recently, MIME has not had the resources to carry out its responsibilities to provide\nan adequate electricity supply, with the result that its small (usually less than 200 kilowatt [kW]\ngenerating  units)  are  often  inoperable  because  of  lack  of  spares.  Also  the  mismatched\ndistribution  components  are  overloaded,  and  fuel  is  not  always  available  due  to  payment\narrears. Private systems, which have grown on an ad hoc basis in many of the provincial towns,\n\n                                                          \n6  Cambodia has no known reserves of oil in spite of concerted exploration efforts. One company has a concession to\ndrill, at greater depths, areas already unsuccessfully explored, and gas, in undetermined quantities, has recently\nbeen discovered.\n\n\f3\n\nsuffer  the  same  problems  as  those  in  public  ownership.  As  there  are  no  administrative\nrestrictions for the private sector to participate in the supply of provincial power, entrepreneurs\nwho could provide a good quality of service are obviously not attracted to participate under the\npresent  circumstances.  Reasons  for  this  include  (i)  the  present  distribution  systems  are\noverloaded so considerable investment is required to serve new customers, (ii) no transparent\ntariff setting mechanism exists, and (iii) skilled operating staff are not available.\n\n9.\nCambodia  has  no  national  grid  system;  electricity  supplies  that  do  exist  are  provided\neither  by  self-generation  or  small  isolated  systems.  The  sector  can  be  divided  into  two  parts:\n(i) Phnom Penh and seven towns supplied by EDC, and (ii) the remainder of the country.\n\nb. \n\nThe EDC Service Area\n\n10.\nAs a result of dialogue with ADB and other development agencies, EDC was established\nby  Royal  Decree  in  March  1996,  as  a  limited  liability  company  owned  jointly  by  MIME  and\nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF). EDC has its own board of directors and operates with\nconsiderable  independence  except  in  the  field  of  tariff  setting.  Its  charter  empowers  EDC  to\nprovide  a  nonexclusive,  full  electricity  service  for  the  whole  country.  Until  recently,  EDC  only\noperated the isolated systems in Phnom Penh, and the urban areas of Kandal, Kompong Cham,\nSiem  Reap,  and  Sihanoukville  but  during  2000,  it  took  over  the  operation  of  Takeo  and\nBattambang  and  EDC  intends  to  gradually  fulfill  its  charter  obligations.  Meanwhile,  MIME\ncontinues  to  be  responsible  for  all  other  areas.  EDC\u2019s  organizational  structure  is  given  in\nAppendix 2.\n\nEDC\u2019s  largest  system  is  in  Phnom  Penh,  which  has  a  population  of  about  1  million\n11.\npersons  in  168,000  households,  of  which  about  85,000  (51  percent)  have  an  electricity\nconnection.  The  system  in  Phnom  Penh  has  a  peak  demand  of  64  MW  and  a  generating\ncapacity of 90 MW, of which 35 MW is provided by a private power producer (PPP). A contract\nwith a second PPP was signed in 1996 under which 60 MW of additional capacity for the capital\nwas scheduled to come online at the end of 1998. After several delays, the World Bank group\u2019s\nInternational Finance Corporation withdrew its support for the Project in mid-2000; and it is now\ndoubtful  if  the  Project  will  proceed.  Therefore,  EDC  has  recently  entered  into  a  short-term\ncontract with a second PPP for 15 MW of diesel-fired generating capacity as an interim measure\nto  meet  Phnom  Penh\u2019s  demand  and  provide  sufficient  reserve  capacity.  Siem  Reap  and\nSihanoukville  have  about  3  MW  and  8  MW  respectively,  of  operational  diesel  generating\ncapacity, and the other areas served by EDC have a total capacity of about 6 MW.\n\n12.\nPartly, as a result of ADB loans and TA, the systems in Phnom Penh and the four other\ntowns  controlled  by  EDC  since  its  independence  are  well  managed,  and  customers  receive  a\nmuch improved standard of service at an average tariff about 40 percent below those in most\nprovincial centers. Factors contributing to the improved performance are  (i) salaries have risen\nwith  the  result  that  qualified  staff  can  be  recruited  and  retained;  (ii)  tariffs  were  raised  by\n40 percent  in  1999  (although  this  was  not  sufficient  to  produce  a  positive  operating  income);\n(iii) sales growth has been strong, at least until the 1999 tariff increase; (iv) accounts are being\nindependently  audited;  and  (v)  EDC  has  recently  been  successful  in  breaking  an  electricity-\nstealing racket that involved senior EDC staff.\n\n13.\nHowever,  EDC\u2019s  financial  situation  remains  precarious  for  reasons  that  are  largely\noutside  its  control.  For  instance,  its  loads  are  small,  and  can  only  reasonably  be  served  by\n\n\f4\n\ndiesel generating units that are inherently expensive to operate.7 With no economies of scale,\nand with the necessity of maintaining a distribution system to serve a largely domestic market,\nEDC\u2019s average cost of supply is higher than the cost of self-generation by large and medium-\nsize  enterprises.  The  tariff  structure  provides  a  cross-subsidy  to  the  domestic  sector  from  the\ncommercial  and  industrial  sector  with  the  result  that  many  of  EDC\u2019s  best  potential  customers\nhave turned to self generation (although the extent of the cross-subsidy has been reduced in the\ncurrent  schedule  of  tariffs).  Fifty  percent  of  EDC\u2019s  costs  relate  to  fuel,  either  directly  or  as  a\npass-through  item  by  its  PPP  suppliers.  The  Government,  which  sets  tariffs,  has  not  allowed\ntariffs  to  increase  sufficiently  to  keep  pace  with  rising  fuel  prices.  The  world  price  of  crude  oil\naveraged about $13 per barrel in 1998, increased to an average of $18 per barrel in 1999, and\nhas  now  increased  to  over  $30  per  barrel.  In  Phnom Penh  and  Sihanoukville,  franchise  areas\nformerly held by wholesalers8 have now been largely assumed by EDC, so that retail consumers\nnow  pay  for  their  consumption  at  EDC\u2019s  scheduled  rates.  The  number  of  EDC\u2019s  customers  in\nPhnom Penh has increased from 21,000 in 1997 to 85,000 in 1999 due largely to its takeover of\nwholesalers.  EDC  has  not  been  able  to  adequately  provide  meters  for  all  of  these  new\ncustomers  or  to  include  them  in  its  billing  system,  thus  contributing  to  its  nontechnical  losses.\nWith  the  help  of  TA  from  Agence  Francaise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  of  France,  these\nproblems are currently being tackled.\n\nc.\n\nOutside EDC\u2019s Service Area\n\n14.\nNo  public  electricity  system  exists  for  most  of  the  country.  Wealthy  households  have\ntheir  own  generators,  and  some  households  avail  of  battery  charging  services,  from  which\nenergy costs up to KR3,800 ($1) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Most provincial capitals have a central\nelectricity system but all are inadequate in terms of capacity, safety, level of service, and cost.\nThe  distribution  systems,  which  generally  cover  only  the  central  parts  of  the  provincial  towns,\nwhose  populations  range  from  10,000  to  100,000,  are  mainly  owned  and  operated  by  MIME,\nwhich either generates power or purchases power from private operators. Private operators with\ncapacity greater than 125 kilovolt-ampere (kVA) are required to be licensed by MIME, which has\noffices  in  each  provincial  capital.  The  total  generating  capacity  nationwide  in  the  provincial\ntowns (other than those operated by EDC) is about 10 MW. Some towns have more than one\nprivate generator, some of which also have a small, low voltage distribution system for up to a\nfew  hundred  households.  In  the  provincial  towns,  tariffs  are  controlled  by  an  arrangement\nbetween MIME and the provincial governments. In each town, a single tariff is generally applied\nto  all  consumers,  ranging  typically  between  KR960  ($0.25)  per  kWh  and  KR1,350  ($0.35)  per\nkWh, with tariffs for some private power supplies up to KR1,600 ($0.41) per kWh. Losses in the\nprovincial  towns  are  typically  35  to  50  percent  of  units  generated.  These  figures  include\nnonpayment  for  consumption  by  local  influential  people,  and  are  probably  not  sensitive  to\nchanges in electricity price. In spite of their present high tariffs, private producers have suffered\nfrom  rising  fuel  prices,  and  where  further  tariff  increases  have  been  disallowed  by  the\nauthorities, a number of operators have ceased production.\n\n                                                          \n7 The larger units are fueled by heavy fuel oil, which is cheaper than diesel but requires more out-of-service time for\n\nmaintenance, and is more polluting.\n\n8  In 1995, wholesalers were allowed to buy electricity from EDC at KR300 ($0.077) per kWh and sell to consumers\nat KR350 ($0.091) per kWh. However, these wholesalers tended to charge residential consumers between KR400\n($0.103)  per  kWh  to  KR800  ($0.208)  per  kWh  as  there  was  no  control.  In  1999,  EDC  started  taking  over  the\nwholesalers and at present there are only about 20 wholesalers in Phnom Penh. It is envisaged that the franchises\nof the remaining wholesalers will be taken over by EDC by early 2001.\n\n\f5\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n1. \n\nScope\n\nIn  October  1994,  Cambodia  formulated  an  energy  sector  development  policy  with\n15.\nobjectives to (i) provide an adequate supply of energy throughout Cambodia at reasonable and\naffordable  prices,  (ii)  ensure  a  reliable,  secure  electricity  supply  at  prices  that  facilitate\ninvestment  in  Cambodia  and  develop  the  national  economy,  (iii) encourage  exploration  of\nindigenous energy resources leading to environmentally and socially acceptable development of\nresources needed to supply all sectors of the Cambodian economy, and (iv) encourage efficient\nuse of energy and minimize detrimental environmental effects resulting from energy supply and\nuse. To implement the policy as it relates to the power sector, in January 1999, the Government\npublished its Power Sector Strategy for the period up to 2016. The strategy is described under\nthe headings of generation and transmission, private sector participation, regulatory framework,\ncommercialization,  provincial  and  rural  electrification,  and  the  environment.  As  such,  it\nrepresents a road map of how to achieve the sector objectives. However, the strategy does not\nmention  the  constraints  that  must  be  addressed  in  other  areas  if  the  objectives  are  to  be\nachieved, such as governance and a weak legal and judicial system.\n\n2. \n\nGeneration and Transmission\n\n16.\nIn terms of infrastructure, the goal of the policy is to construct a high-voltage grid in the\narea west of Phnom Penh and Tonle Sap, connecting to Viet Nam in the south and Thailand in\nthe  northwest.  The  grid  would  connect  the  main  towns  in  the  area,  including  the  port  of\nSihanoukville and the tourist center of Siem Reap, and also future hydropower projects on the\nBattambang River and Stung Metoek. The remaining 60 percent of the country would be served\nby  isolated  grids  of  medium  voltage,  since  load  demands  will  be  too  low,  and  distances  too\ngreat for economical interconnection for at least the next decade.\n\n17.\nIn the early years, supply of power will be achieved by a move away from dependence\non imported fuel to importation of cheaper power from Viet Nam and Thailand, and as demand\ngrows,  by  construction  of  a  combined-cycle  thermal  plant  located  at  Sihanoukville  fueled  by\nindigenous  or  imported  natural  gas.  Funding  for  feasibility  studies  for  the  first  phases  of  the\ngeneration and transmission expansion plans has been secured, and studies commenced.\n\nin \n\nIncluded \n\nthe  Government\u2019s  energy  sector  policy \n\n18.\nthe\ncountry\u2019s hydropower  potential,  in  the  mini  (less  than  5  MW),  small  (less  than  50  MW),  and\nmedium (50-200 MW) power ranges. A constraint to development of the hydropower potential is\nthe  lack  of  adequate  hydrological  data.  At  present,  very  few  river  flow  gauges  in  the  country\nfunction,  and  previous  records  have  been  almost  entirely  lost.  A  modest  network  of  gauges\nstrategically  placed  on  rivers  throughout  the  country  is  essential  to  provide  the  necessary\ndatabase for the study of hydropower potential. The Project will address this shortcoming.\n\nis  development  of \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation in Power Projects\n\n19.\nRecent Government involvement in the sector was dictated by the desperate situation of\nthe Cambodian electricity system in 1993. Because the Government could not afford the power\nsupply  infrastructure  required  to  meet  even  the  most  urgent  needs  of  the  country,  the\nGovernment  accepted  proposals  from  investors  who  approached  with  turnkey  projects.\nAccordingly,  four  power  purchase  agreements  (PPAs)  were  negotiated  to  meet  the  country\u2019s\nurgent power demand, although only two projects have been brought to commercial operation,\n\n\f6\n\ni.e.,  35  MW  in  Phnom  Penh  in  1996  and  2  MW  in  Kompong  Cham  in  1996.  Since  1998,  the\ninvestment climate has improved in a number of ways, e.g., security has improved; laws have\nbeen  promulgated  in  many  fields,  especially  regarding  investments;  and  the  democratic\nframework  is  stronger.  At  the  international  level,  major  positive  signals  have  been  delivered\nsuch  as  the  award  of  most  favored  trading  nation  status  to  the  Kingdom  by  the  United  States\nand  admission  to  the  Association  of  South  East  Asian  Nations.  At  the  provincial  level,  the\nProject\u2019s capacity building components will improve the market environment in the provinces so\nthat private investors will be attracted to provide future system expansion.\n\n20.\nUnder  the  energy  sector  policy,  the  Government  will  follow  a  new  approach  for  the\ndevelopment and approval of private investment projects in the power sector, including (i) use of\na  transparent  process  to  select  independent  power  producer  (IPP)  developers,  using\ncompetitive  tendering  procedures  for  all  significant  power  projects;  (ii)  use  of  a  termination\nclause  in  PPAs  for  possible  transfer  of  assets  to  EDC  provided  the  utility  is  able  to  provide\nsupply at lower cost through the national grid, when it is established; (iii) introduction of a two-\npart  tariff  for  the  purchase  of  electricity  from  IPPs;  and  (iv)  evaluation  of  all  private  sector\nfunding and ownership of significant power projects against public funding and ownership, and\njoint ventures between the public and private sector. Contrary to the energy sector policy, both\nthe  rehabilitation  of  the  Kirirom  Hydropower  Project  and  a  small  franchise  to  import  and\ndistribute power in the province of Koh Kong were awarded by direct negotiation. Guidelines on\nprivate investment and procedures for negotiating PPAs are the subject of policy dialogue with\nADB  and  other  development  partners.  ADB  agrees  with  the  Government  that  no  economies\nwould be gained by restructuring and privatizing EDC at the present time since its systems are\nso small (90 MW in Phnom Penh and a total of 17 MW elsewhere).\n\n4. \n\nRegulatory Framework\n\n21.\nThrough  Royal  Decree  in  March  1996,  the  Government  announced  a  decision  to\nestablish an independent regulatory agency to improve the efficiency and availability of electric\npower services in Cambodia by increasing private ownership and competition in electric power\ngeneration.  MIME,  supported  by  World  Bank  assistance,  drafted  an  electricity  law  that  is\ncurrently  being  considered  by  the  National  Assembly.9  The  law  will  create  the  electricity\nauthority  of  Cambodia  (EAC)  as  an  independent  regulatory  authority  and  also  establish  the\nprinciples  on  which  all  operators  will  be  licensed  to  undertake  various  activities  in  the  electric\npower  industry.  The  law  will  provide  the  basis  for  the  regulation  of  supply  of  electric  power\nservices  to  the  extent  such  services  are  monopolistic,  and  the  basis  for  the  protection  of  the\nrights  of  consumers.  From  the  time  of  enactment  of  the  electricity  law,  the  EAC  will  be\nresponsible  for  approving  all  tariffs  and  charges  for  the  supply  of  electricity.  The  EAC  will\nregularly  review  the  tariffs  and  charges  to  ensure  an  electricity  supply  at  reasonable  prices\nconsistent  with  providing  an  adequate  return  to  investors.  The  EAC  will  be  responsible  for\nregulation of both private and public suppliers of electricity, including EDC.\n\n5. \n\nCommercialization\n\nEDC was converted to a limited liability company in 1996 with equal ownership by MIME\n22.\nand MEF. With an independent board of directors, EDC has widespread powers in many areas\nexcept  tariff  setting.  After  passage  of  the  electricity  law,  MIME  will  divest  itself  of  direct\ninvolvement in the provincial power systems, and become the sector policymaker. The optimal\n\n                                                          \n9  The remaining stages are ratification by the Senate, adoption by the Council of Constitution, and promulgation by\n\nthe King.\n\n\f7\n\nreplacement  structure  to  own  and  operate  the  provincial  systems  is  being  investigated  under\nTA 3453.10\n\n6. \n\nProvincial and Rural Electrification\n\n23.\nEfforts have concentrated on bringing the electricity supply up to a reasonable standard\nin the capital and two important commercial towns. To a large extent, this has been achieved,\nand  the  Government  has  a  program  to  rehabilitate  the  electricity  systems  in  the  remaining\nprovincial capitals. Approximately, $90 million will be required in the medium term to rehabilitate\nthe remaining provincial capitals. The Government plans to seek concessional funds and private\nsector participation, including public-private partnerships. Rehabilitation of the provincial power\nsystems  is  essential  for  the  proper  functioning  of  local  government,  and  to  stimulate  the  local\neconomies with positive impacts on the urban poor and the rural hinterland, thereby slowing the\nmigration of people to Phnom Penh.\n\n24.\nThe  Government  also  has  a  strategy  for  rural  electrification  for  which  $10  million  per\nyear  for  10  years  has  been  estimated  as  the  minimum  capital  requirement.  Although  stand-\nalone systems, particularly renewable generation such as microhydro, may be options in some\nlocations,  generally  the  most  viable  method  will  be  grid  extensions  either  from  suitable\nsubstations  close  to  the  border  in  neighboring  countries,  or  from  the  grids  in  the  newly\nrehabilitated  provincial  towns.  The  World  Bank  is  currently  providing  TA  to  prepare  a  staged\nrural  electrification  strategy  and  a  10-year  program  to  increase  electricity  access  to  rural\ncommunities.  Preliminary  findings  indicate  that  grid  extension  from  provincial  towns  will  prove\ncompetitive compared with new generation facilities. The Project will therefore be a catalyst for\nelectrification of the surrounding rural areas.\n\n7. \n\nEnvironmental Policy and Legislation in Cambodia\n\nThe Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Management Law, 1996, provides\n25.\nfor all projects to be subject to an environmental examination. The law provides for the Ministry\nof Environment to establish an environmental steering committee and project review teams for\ndifferent  sectors.  MIME  and  EDC  participate  in  both  the  steering  committee  and  also  the\nrelevant  review  team.  Government  policy  provides  for  sound  environmental  management  of\npower  projects  through  a  systematic  approach  to  protection  against  pollution  of  air,  soil,  and\nwater;  protection  against  noise,  vibration,  and  radiation;  and  protection  of  flora  and  fauna  in\nrelation  to  power  sector  operations.  As  a  result  of  ADB  TA  2723,11  a  subdecree  on\nenvironmental  impact  assessment  was  approved  by  the  Government  in  August  1999.\nGuidelines for environmental impact assessments for thermal power and transmission projects\nwere also drawn up. The environmental requirements will be integrated into the development of\nall power projects.\n\n8. \n\nPolicy Implementation\n\n26.\nThe  Government  through  MIME  has  taken  two  significant  steps  that  demonstrate  its\ncommitment to the policy, i.e., corporatization of EDC and substantial progress towards passing\nthe electricity law. Expansion of the electricity system is following the proposed strategy in terms\n\n                                                          \n10 TA 3453-CAM:  Development of a Strategy for Management of Provincial Power Supplies, for $150,000, approved\n\non 8 June 2000.\n\n11 TA  2723-CAM: Institutional Strengthening and Expanding Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Capacity,  for\n\n$1,000,000, approved on 19 December 1996.\n\n\f8\n\nof  studying  the  feasibility  of  a  high-voltage  transmission  system  in  parts  of  the  country  and\nseeking  funding  for  provincial  and  rural  electrification.  The  Government  has  accepted\nparticipation of the private sector in generation (IPPs in Phnom Penh); transmission (115 kilovolt\n[kV]  line  from  Kirirom  Hydropower  Project  to  Phnom  Penh);  and  distribution  (22  kV  and  low-\nvoltage systems in Koh Kong Province and Poipet town). However, none of these contracts has\nbeen  awarded  on  the  basis  of  competition.  The  electricity  law  will  require  contracts  to  be\nawarded as a result of competitive bidding.\n\nC. \n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n1. \n\nLoan Assistance\n\nThe  international  community  recommenced  assistance  to  Cambodia  in  1992  with\n27.\nemergency aid to the power sector from the governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, France,\nIreland,  Japan,  Sweden,  and  the  United  States.  Additional  assistance  came  from  the  United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) and World Bank. ADB\u2019s first assistance to the sector\nwas delivered as a component (completed in 1995) of an emergency relief loan used in Phnom\nPenh to rehabilitate a number of diesel generators totaling 8.4 MW that were inoperable due to\nlack of spare parts, to provide 18 MW of new plant and reequip 18 substations. Also under an\nemergency assistance program, UNDP and World Bank implemented a multifaceted project that\nincluded  management  support,  human  resource  training,  and  development  of  regulatory  and\nhuman  resource  investment  programs.  Other  power  infrastructure  rehabilitation  included\nrefurbishment  of  medium-voltage  substations  and  connections  between  the  power  stations\nwithin  Phnom  Penh  to  increase  the  reliability  of  supplies.  Subsequent  to  the  emergency\nprogram, the thrust of ADB loan 1345 (footnote 2) and other development partners12 is to bring\nthe  distribution  system  in  Phnom  Penh  up  to  a  reasonable  standard  to  reduce  losses,  meet\nincreasing demand, attract private sector generators, and improve the reliability of supply. When\nthe  ongoing  transmission-ring  project  around  Phnom  Penh  is  completed  in  2000,  these\nobjectives will largely have been achieved for the central part of the city. A distribution system\nexpansion project, financed by Japan, will be implemented during 2000-2001 covering outlying\nareas of Phnom Penh to bring a grid supply to a further 270,000 people. If only 50 percent of\nhouseholds initially avail of a supply, this would represent an increase in EDC\u2019s customer base\nof 20 percent. ADB assistance under loan 1345 (footnote 2) also provided 5.4 MW of generating\ncapacity  to  Sihanoukville,  and  rehabilitated  the  distribution  systems  there  and  in  Siem  Reap,\nwhere  the  above  objectives  were  also  largely  achieved.  The  loan  also  supported  construction\nand equipping of a training center for EDC in Phnom Penh.\n\n28.\nADB loan 1345 extended by 12 months the services of three international management\nadvisers  to  EDC,  originally  funded  by  UNDP.  In  1996,  these  consultants  were  instrumental  in\nsetting up the planning, finance, and projects departments of EDC and assisting in the crucial\nstages  of  sector  restructuring,  which  culminated  in  converting  EDC  to  an  autonomous  public\nutility in 1996. Also computers and software were provided together with training for accountants\nin  their  use.  In  1999  and  2000,  loan  proceeds  were  used  to  update  the  software,  expand  the\nhardware in EDC\u2019s provincial centers, and train EDC staff in international accounting standards.\nThis  resulted  in  EDC  producing,  for  the  first  time  since  its  corporatization,  audited  financial\nstatements for 1998. However, EDC\u2019s financial management and forecasting skills remain weak\nand additional assistance is required. Details of major aid assistance are given in Appendix 3.\n\n                                                          \n12 Primarily World Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and France.\n\n\f9\n\n2. \n\nTechnical Assistance\n\n29.\nThe  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  TA  has  been  human  resource  development  and  training.  In\nparticular,  TA  224313  determined  training  requirements  and  prepared  appropriate  training\nprograms for EDC staff. MIME has benefited from the services of an energy policy adviser for\n18  months,  funded  by  the  World  Bank;  simultaneously,  a  project  management  adviser  to  the\ngeneral  manager  was  assigned  to  EDC,  funded  at  first  by  UNDP  and  subsequently  by  ADB.\nMore  recently,  considerable  TA  has  been  provided  to  MIME  primarily  by  the  World  Bank  to\nassist with drafting of the electricity law.\n\nAn advisory TA14 designed to investigate ADB\u2019s future role and involvement in the sector\n30.\ncommenced  in  March  2000.  It  will  identify  the  capacity  building  and  investment  needs  of  the\nsector over the medium term, and develop a financing plan to address these needs, including\ncofinancing and private capital support. The TA will identify potential areas for ADB support, and\nidentify the reforms that could be achieved by ADB involvement.\n\nADB  is  conducting  advisory  TA  3453  (footnote  10)  to  consider  options  for  future\n31.\nownership  and  management  of  provincial  power  systems,  make  a  recommendation  for\nGovernment  consideration,  and  commence  staff  training.  Options  under  consideration  include\n(i) implement EDC\u2019s charter to operate all provincial electricity systems; (ii) establish a provincial\npower  utility,  leaving  EDC  to  operate  only  in  Phnom  Penh;  (iii)  offer  franchises  to  the  private\nsector;  or  (iv)  let  the  provinces  operate  and  own  their  own  systems  perhaps  on  a  cooperative\nbasis. This TA will be completed early in 2001.\n\nThe  AFD  is  currently  funding  assistance  to  EDC  in  an  attempt  to  increase  sales  in  the\n32.\nindustry sector of Phnom Penh, which, under the present tariff system is one of the few sectors\nthat covers its supply costs. The assistance is therefore focused on identifying an optimal tariff\nstructure  for  the  sector  and  developing  a  marketing  strategy  designed  to  attract  these\nconsumers back to a grid supply and away from self-generation.\n\n33.\nIn early 2000, Japan agreed to sponsor a 3-year study into the feasibility of establishing,\nin  Sihanoukville,  phased  construction  of  a  180  MW  power  plant  to  feed  into  the  proposed\nnational  grid.  The  study  will  also  review  the  feasibility  of  an  offshore  gas  supply.  The  World\nBank with Japan Bank for International Cooperation fielded consultants in March 2000 to assess\nthe  feasibility  of  constructing  a  high-voltage  transmission  line  from  the  Vietnamese  border,\nnorthward  to  Phnom  Penh;  and/or  from  a  powerstation  at  Sihanoukville  to  Phnom  Penh.  This\nstudy  will  also  address  rural  electrification  policies  and  propose  a  10-year  rural  electrification\nprogram.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n34.\nThe  electricity  sector  component  of  ADB\u2019s  emergency  loan  to  Cambodia  has  achieved\nits  objectives  of  reinstating  basic  power  supply  to  the  capital.  This  project  component  was\ncompleted a few months later than planned, due primarily to the weak capacity of the executing\nagency  (MIME)  after  a  long  period  of  civil  war.  All  components  of  the  second  ADB  loan,\nloan 1345  (footnote  2)  were  completed  on  time  and  within  budget  (except  for  completion  of  a\n\n                                                          \n13 TA  2243-CAM:  Power  Sector  Manpower  Development  and  Training, \n\nfor  $500,000,  approved  on\n\n14 TA  3298-CAM:  Developing the  Strategy for ADB\u2019s Involvement in Cambodia\u2019s Power Sector,  for  $150,000,\n\n15 December 1994.\n\napproved on 16 November 1999.\n\n\f10\n\nnew  training  center  for  EDC,  which  was  six  months  late  and  not  completed  until  June  2000).\nThe capacity building elements, which included EDC commercialization have strengthened EDC\nin many areas. ADB\u2019s support for the electricity sector can be regarded as generally successful,\nalthough with some shortcomings as described below.\n\n35.\nElectricity rehabilitation and expansion projects depend for their success on an accurate\nforecast of load demand. Plans for growth should reflect demand higher than the most likely rate\nbecause (i) projects have a tendency to be delayed, and (ii) slowing down a project is usually\nless expensive than accelerating it. However, the new generating capacity of 5.4 MW installed\nin  Sihanoukville  in  1998  under  ADB  loan  1345,  based  on  load  forecasts  prepared  in  1994,  is\nwell in excess of the current demand because the rate of economic growth has been below the\npredicted  level.  For  the  Project,  the  scope  has  been  updated  by  means  of  an  additional  TA\n(footnote 4),  resulting  in  a  reduced  forecast  demand  and  required  infrastructure  up  to  2014,\ncompared to the estimate made in 1998.\n\n36.\nBecause data on existing generation, sales, and consumers held by MIME and private\ngenerators  is  often  unreliable,  baseline  data  for  the  project  towns  will  be  collected  using  a\nsurvey  and  reclassification  of  existing  and  potential  new  customers  by  EDC,  assisted  by  the\nimplementation consultant, prior to commencement of construction work. Future EDC statistics\non  customer  growth  in  the  various  categories,  growth  in  individual  consumption,  electrification\nrates  of  poor  areas,  etc.  will  allow  the  success  of  the  Project  to  be  determined  with  greater\nreliability  than  would  be  the  case  if  the  feasibility  study  data  alone  were  to  form  the  baseline.\nThis follows the procedure adopted for provincial town electrical rehabilitation in Viet Nam.15\n\nOne component of loan 1345 that did not yield the anticipated benefits was the training\n37.\nof accountants in the two provincial EDC offices on the use of hardware and software provided\nunder  the  project.  The  training  was  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  accountants  were\nsufficiently  familiar  with  accounting  principles  to  be  able  to  use  the  software  after  a  period  of\ntraining and familiarization. In fact, the level of accounting skills was so low that the full potential\nof the software could not be utilized. Under the Project, in which the skill levels in the provincial\ntowns  are  even  lower,  basic  skills  training  will  form  a  significant  component  of  the  capacity\nbuilding effort. Compounding the problem of producing timely realistic accounts is the fact that\nthe  Government  requires  accounts  to  be  produced  to  its  own  standard,  whereas  the  major\ndevelopment  agencies  require  accounts  to  international  standards.  This  is  unnecessarily\nburdensome and should be tackled at the national level.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n38.\nThe  country  operational  strategy  for  Cambodia  identifies  support  for  energy  sector\ndevelopment as a key component of an overall strategy to enhance the enabling environment\nfor private sector participation in the economy leading to growth and poverty reduction. Private\ninvestors identify high energy costs as one of the constraints inhibiting exploitation of business\nopportunities  in  Cambodia.  Having  provided  emergency  aid  to  electrify  Phnom  Penh,  ADB\u2019s\nstrategy has been to help the Government implement its power sector policy to satisfy demand\nfor  power  where  and  when  required.  Due  to  constraints  on  financial  and  human  resources,\npriorities  have  been  set  for  which  areas  will  benefit,  starting  with  Phnom  Penh;  then\nSihanoukville,  the  main  port;  Siem  Reap,  the  main  tourist  destination;  followed  by  provincial\ntowns  and  rural  electrification.  ADB  has  made  a  major  contribution  to  rehabilitate  and  expand\nservices  in  Phnom  Penh,  Siem  Reap,  and  Sihanoukville  with  resulting  improvements  in\n\n                                                          \n15 Loan 1358-VIE(SF):  Power Distribution Rehabilitation Project, for $79,978 million, approved on 8 June 1995.\n\n\f11\n\nstandard  of  service  and  lower  tariffs.16  The  electrical  systems  in  the  remainder  of  the  country\nremain  neglected  and  provide  a  severe  obstacle  to  growth  of  even  small-scale  enterprises.\nADB\u2019s  strategy  is  to  first  of  all  establish  reliable  and  efficient  systems  in  selected  provincial\ntowns,  and  at  the  same  time  to  improve  management  skills  so  that  the  private  sector  will  be\nattracted to finance the orderly expansion of the systems on a competitive basis. Otherwise, a\ndanger  exists  that  development  will  concentrate  in  the  towns  presently  served  by  EDC,  which\nwill  prosper  and  expand,  leaving  other  areas  in  a  continually  depressed  state.  ADB\u2019s  strategy\nincludes  measures  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  supply  and  lower  the  costs  of  services  to\nconsumers.  The  strategy  will  be  more  effective  if  rural  infrastructure  is  improved  on  a\ncoordinated basis, through which the benefits are greater than the sum of those from individual\ncomponents. Therefore, where possible, provincial towns selected for electrification are also the\nsubject of complementary ADB assistance in the fields of water supply and roads (e.g., Kampot,\nSihanoukville, and Svay Rieng).\n\n39.\nOther development agencies, notably the World Bank and Japan Bank for International\nCooperation, are focusing on rural electrification and future high-voltage transmission systems.\nThe  result  of  these  strategies  will  be  to  distribute  the  benefits  of  aid  support  to  diverse  social\nand  geographic  groups  in  the  interests  of  national  harmony,  equity,  and  efficiency.  Therefore,\nADB\u2019s  strategy  is  to  concentrate  on  provincial  towns,  and  to  coordinate  with  its  development\npartners to maximize the benefits to be gained by interaction between the transmission system,\nprovincial power supplies, and rural electrification.\n\n40.\nIn  addition  to  funding  physical  infrastructure,  ADB\u2019s  strategy  is  to  promote  human\nresource development. Two areas of weakness have been identified: (i) in EDC, where financial\nmanagement,  forecasting,  and  system  planning  skills  need  strengthening;  and  (ii)  in  the\nprovinces, where trained and educated staff are in very short supply.\n\nF. \n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n41.\nThe  Government  requested  the  World  Bank  to  be  lead  development  agency  in  the\nenergy  sector,  and  the  World  Bank  has  therefore  initiated  the  main  policy  dialogue  in  recent\nyears supported by ADB. Dialogue has focused on drafting the electricity law, which will lead to\nestablishment  of  an  electricity  regulator,  the  EAC,  to  oversee  all  aspects  of  the  sector.  The\nelectricity  law  proposes  that  all  future  private  contracts  be  awarded  following  a  transparent\nprocess  of  competitive  bidding.  The  regulations  envisioned  by  the  law,  and  ADB\u2019s  work  to\nstrengthen  EDC\u2019s  capacity  are  expected  to  increase  private  investor  interest  in  helping  meet\nCambodia\u2019s power requirements.\n\n42.\nAs  part  of  loan  processing,  ADB  has  led  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  in  two\ncritical areas, i.e., tariff reform in EDC\u2019s Phnom Penh area, and improvement of EDC\u2019s financial\nstatus.  Prior  to  August  2000,  the  tariff  structure  was  characterized  by  three  weaknesses:\n(i) tariffs  for  hotels  and  large  industrial  consumers  were  so  high  that  they  encouraged  many\nlarge  customers  to  turn  to  self-generation;  (ii)  the  domestic  tariff  was  well  below  the  cost  of\nsupply,  and  some  commercial  consumers  seemed  to  abuse  the  system,  pretending  to  be\ndomestic in order to obtain lower tariffs; and (iii) no incentives were given to reduce peak load.\nAs  a  result  of  the  dialogue,  a  required  substantial  tariff  increase  effective  from  1  August  2000\nhas (i) raised average tariffs by 16 percent, including an average 57 percent increase to tariffs in\nthe  domestic  sector,  and  (ii)  reduced  average  tariffs  by  about  10  percent  for  industrial\n\n                                                          \n16 Current  tariffs  in  Phnom  Penh,  which  were  close  to  the  required  level  for  1999,  are  about  40  percent  below\n\nprevailing tariffs in the provincial towns.\n\n\f12\n\nconsumers.  This  has  substantially  reduced  the  extent  of  cross-subsidies  and  should  prevent\npresent  industrial  customers  from  turning  to  self-generation.  The  Government  has  agreed  to\nreduce its arrears to EDC to at most two months of sales and to put in place a mechanism for\nGovernment ministries and departments to become and remain current with their payments to\nEDC.\n\n43.\nThe  Government  has  approved  a  lifeline  tariff  of  KR350  ($0.09)  per  kWh  for  the  first\n50 kWh  of  domestic  consumption.  The  financial  deficit  resulting  from  the  lifeline  tariff  is  to  be\nfunded by cross-subsidy from other (commercial and industrial) consumers. While this creates\nthe problem of high tariffs for the latter groups, the alternative of direct Government subsidies if\napplied  should  be  governed  by  the  following  principles,  which  are  reflected  in  the  loan\ndocuments.  To  measure  and  monitor  EDC\u2019s  satisfactory  financial  performance,  ADB  will  only\naccept subsidies to be included in EDC\u2019s income if the following conditions are met: (i) subsidy\npayments  are  reasonably  justified  by  documentation  in  an  official  Government  policy  paper;\n(ii) subsidies  must  be  focused  on  low-income  consumers;  (iii)  average  subsidies  for  EDC\u2019s\nurban  consumers  in  Phnom  Penh  should  not  exceed  average  subsidies  for  provincial  or  rural\nconsumers; and (iv) subsidies must be paid in a regular manner (not ad hoc), through a special\naccount, approved in advance, in the Government\u2019s annual budget.\n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n44.\nThe country needs a reliable, affordable, and efficient electricity supply as a fundamental\ninput  for  economic  growth  leading  to  poverty  reduction.  Substantial  improvement  of  the  living\nstandards of the rural poor is closely linked with economic development in urban centers. The\nexpected  benefits  of  rural  development  can  be  realized  only  if  farmers  are  able  to  sell  their\nincreased agricultural produce in the urban economy in exchange for such items as new farming\nequipment,  fertilizer,  seeds,  technology,  and  better  consumer  goods.  Rural  development,\ntherefore,  is  correlated  to  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the  urban  economy  for  increased  rural\nproduce.  The  provincial  towns  in  the  country  serve  as  the  economic  centers  for  the  rural\nhinterland.  In  the  provinces,  these  towns  are  the  immediate  markets,  transport  depots,  and\nprocessing  centers  for  provincial  agricultural  products.  Improving  urban  services,  including\nelectricity  supplies  in  the  provincial  towns  will  therefore  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  both\nrural  and  urban  areas.  Adequate  electricity  systems  are  absent  from  the  whole  of  the  country\nwith the exceptions of Kompong Cham, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville.\n\n45.\nIn  the  other  provinces,  the  owners,  both  MIME  and  the  private  sector  operators,  have\nneither the capital nor the creditworthiness to fund rehabilitation, expansion, or upgrading of the\nsystems. The existing high tariffs demonstrate a willingness to pay for even an inferior supply,\nand  surveys  conducted  under  the  project  preparatory  TA  show  that  improved  and  extended\nservices  will  attract  new  customers.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  expand  the  electricity\ngenerating  and  distribution  systems  in  selected  provincial  capitals,  and  train  staff  in  their\noperation, maintenance, and management. The resulting systems will (i) provide a 24-hour per\nday supply of high reliability and acceptable loss levels,17 (ii) reduce average tariffs in the project\ntowns, and (iii) allow for future system expansion. Two of the selected towns, Kampot and Svay\nRieng,  are  included  in  ADB\u2019s  Provincial  Towns  Improvement  Project,18  which  will  also  provide\n\n                                                          \n17 The target transmission and distribution loss level under the new systems is 18 percent.\n18 Loan 1725-CAM(SF):  Provincial Towns Improvement Project, for $20 million, approved on 17 December 1999.\n\n\f13\n\nrenewed  sewerage  and  water  supply  systems  for  Sihanoukville  whose  electricity  system  was\nrehabilitated under ADB loan 1345 (footnote 2).\n\n46.\nNo legal or administrative barriers exist for private sector participation in public electricity\nsupply, but virtually all private producers to date are extremely low caliber, very small scale, and\nusing  second-hand  equipment.  Public  safety  is  an  issue  in  power  supply  and  internationally\nacceptable  standards  should  be  maintained.  Without  external  intervention,  the  needed\nimprovements in electricity supply are unlikely to materialize. At this early stage of Cambodia\u2019s\ndevelopment,  provision  of  basic  infrastructure  (even  revenue  generating)  cannot  be  left  to  the\nprivate sector alone. Therefore, concessional funding is required. The Project will be owned and\noperated,  at  least  initially  by  EDC,  which  will  receive  sufficient  help  with  human  resource\ndevelopment to enable efficient operation of the systems. EDC has a record of taking over and\nmanaging  systems  of  similar  size  and  larger,  decreasing  losses,  and  improving  accounts\nreceivable and customer service. ADB is aware that public ownership may not be the best long-\nterm  situation,  and  ongoing  TA  3453  (footnote  10)  will  identify  a  wide  range  of  possible\nalternatives for Government consideration.\n\nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n47.\nThe  long-term  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  stimulate  economic  growth  and  thereby\nreduce  urban  poverty  in  the  selected  provincial  towns  and  the  surrounding  rural  populations,\nwith the longer term goal of creating the enabling environment for private sector participation in\nfuture  power  system  expansion.  Appendix  4  gives  information  on  the  selected  towns.  The\nimmediate purposes of the Project are to (i) expand the availability of reliable power supplies in\neight  provincial  towns;  (ii)  build  capacity  by  creating  suitable  management,  operation,  and\nmaintenance  organizations  in  the  provincial  centers  so  the  new  systems  are  efficient  and\nfinancially viable; (iii) strengthen the skills in the EDC head office (which will remain responsible\nfor  over  90  percent  of  EDC  sales);  (iv)  expand  the  scope  of  training  available  at  EDC\u2019s  ADB-\nfunded training center in Phnom Penh; and (v) setup a data-gathering system on which to base\nfuture  hydropower  development.  The  scope  comprises  two  parts:    Part  A,  Infrastructure;  and\nPart B, Capacity Building.\n\n1. \n\nPart A:  Infrastructure\n\n48.\nThe  Project  will  improve  the  electricity  systems  in  the  capital  towns  of  eight  provinces.\nThe  distribution  systems  will  be  replaced  and/or  expanded  in  the  towns  of  Banlung,  Kampot,\nKompong  Speu,  Prey  Veng,  Sisophon,  Stung  Treng,  Svay  Rieng,  and  Takeo.  In  addition,  the\nsource  of  electricity  will  be  expanded  by  providing  new  generator  sets  in  Kampot,  Prey  Veng,\nSisophon, Stung Treng, and Takeo. In Kampot, new generating equipment will supplement the\nexisting 1.3 MW of privately operated generating equipment which will remain in service. EDC\nwill  purchase  energy  from  the  private  operator.  Svay  Rieng  will  be  supplied  via  a  new  22  kV\nconnection from Viet Nam. The route has been selected to supply power to a number of villages\nand an irrigation system along the way. Kompong Speu will be served by a short 22 kV line from\na  substation  on  the  proposed  new  transmission  line  to  be  constructed  as  part  of  the  build-\noperate-transfer rehabilitation of Kirirom hydropower plant.19 Banlung in Rattanakiri Province is\nserved by a 1 MW hydropower plant, commissioned in 1993, with adequate generating capacity.\n\n                                                          \n19 MIME recently signed an implementation agreement, and EDC a PPA, with a private developer to reconstruct the\n12 MW Kirirom hydropowerplant project and build a 115 kV transmission line from the plant to Phnom Penh, on a\nbuild-operate-transfer basis. The agreements provide for construction of a 115/22 kV substation at Kompong Speu.\n\n\f14\n\nKompong Speu, Sisophon, and Stung Treng do not have a medium-voltage distribution\n49.\nsystem,  only  0.4  kV  lines  from  the  generators  to  consumers.  Where  medium-voltage  systems\nexist, they comprise 4.5, 6.3, 10, and 15 kV sections, all of inadequate size and condition, with\nthe  exceptions  of  (i)  Banlung  where  the  10  kV  line  from  the  hydropower  project  is  in  good\ncondition and will be retained; and (ii) Prey Veng where some 15 kV underground cables and\nsubstations  were  installed  in  1997  and  will  be  retained.  The  feeders  and  low-voltage\nconnections,  substations,  and  meters  (where  they  exist)  will  be  replaced  with  22  kV  (except\nBanlung  and  Prey  Veng)  and  0.4  kV  systems  will  be  replaced  and  extended  using  readily\navailable standard components designed to acceptable levels of cost-effectiveness and safety.\nPresently,  only  the  town\u2019s  central  areas  have  a  grid  supply.  Under  the  Project,  the  medium-\nvoltage  systems  will  be  extended  along  the  peripheral  roads  into  the  semi-urban  areas  and\nvillages  close  to  the  towns  where  there  is  a  greater  proportion  of  low-income  households.  At\nsome  locations,  e.g.,  between  Angtassom  and  Takeo,  a  few  existing  support  poles  can  be\nretained.\n\n50.\nThe new generators will be diesel-engined generating sets of sizes 250 kW and 500 kW\nand of standard design. The generators will be skid-mounted and housed in purpose-designed\nsimple buildings. Fuel will be stored in tanks at each power station with adequate measures to\nprevent  spilt  fuel  from  leaking  into  the  soil.  Moats  will  be  built  around  each  tank  with\nimpermeable membranes. The moat will have sufficient capacity to contain the total contents of\nthe tank in case of rupture. All the systems will be designed to supply load growth up to the end\nof  2006  and  provide  a  solid  base  for  system  development  thereafter.  Beyond  2006,  relatively\nsmaller  additions  will  be  required  for  distribution  system  expansion  and  new  generating\ncapacity. The new project works will be brought into service between mid-2003 and mid-2004.\nKampot, Kompong Speu, Svay Rieng, and Takeo have sufficient land available in the existing\npower plant areas, which are owned by MIME, for the new equipment and facilities that will be\nrequired.  In  the  other  towns,  new  sites,  which  have  minimal  social  impacts,  have  also  been\nidentified.\n\n2. \n\nPart B: Capacity Building\n\na. \n\nProvincial Power Systems\n\n51.\nThe  objective  of  this  project  component  is  to  fully  establish  and  make  operational,  the\norganization  that  will  operate  and  manage  the  provincial  power  supplies.  This  component  will\nbuild on the work achieved under TA 3453 (footnote 10) for the most appropriate structure for\nownership,  management,  and  operation  of  future  provincial  power  supplies.  Whatever\norganizational  structure  is  adopted,  the  physical  and  human  resources  necessary  to  make  it\nfunction  do  not  exist;  this  project  component  will  address  this  deficiency  by  staff  training  and\nequipping of offices.\n\n(i) \n\nUp  to  100  staff  mainly  from  the  provincial  offices  of  MIME,  or  newly\nrecruited,  will  receive  training  in  English  and  computer  skills.  Selected\nstaff  will  receive  training  in  general  business  management,  financial\nmonitoring  and  control,  and  accounting  at  the  National  Institute  of\nManagement in Phnom Penh. Others will receive technical training at the\nexisting  ADB-funded  EDC  Training  Center  in  Phnom  Penh.  A  similar\ntraining program financed by the World Bank successfully trained a wide\nrange of EDC and MIME staff.\n\n\f15\n\n(ii) \n\nUtility offices will be required in each provincial town for billing, collection,\ncustomer  services,  financial  accounting  and  projections,  procurement,\nand other management and reporting functions. Some of these functions\nare  presently  carried  out,  in  a  rudimentary  way,  by  either  private\noperators  or  MIME  from  poorly  equipped  premises.  This  subcomponent\nwill  include  refurbishment  and  purchase  of  equipment  for  eight  regional\noffices  to  enable  these  functions  to  be  carried  out  efficiently.  Equipment\nwill include furniture, computers, and software programs.\n\nb. \n\nStrengthening of Head Office Facilities\n\ni. \n\nFinancial Management Adviser to EDC\n\nfinancial  systems  are  computerized  and  provide  relatively \n\n52. While  EDC\u2019s \ntimely\ninformation,  EDC\u2019s  accounting  policies  are  not  well  documented  in  its  accounting  manual.\nExternal  auditors  are  assisting  EDC  to  improve  its  accounting  and  reporting  capabilities.\nHowever,  EDC  lacks  experienced  in-house  capacity  for  preparing  financial  forecasts  beyond\none  year.  As  part  of  the  Project,  ADB  will  fund  a  financial  adviser  to  train  staff  and  help  EDC\nstrengthen its financial and accounting functions, implement its financial recovery plan, improve\nits  financial  forecasting  capability,  upgrade  its  financial  management  information  systems,  and\nstrengthen  its  internal  audit  capability.  Intermittent  inputs  by  an  international  expert  over  three\nyears will be provided.\n\nii. \n\nPlanning Adviser to EDC\n\n53.\nThe World Bank funded the services of an international adviser to EDC for two years up\nto  31  December  1999  under  its  Phnom  Penh  Power  Rehabilitation  Project.  ADB  continued  to\nfund these services for six months to the end of June 2000 under loan 1345 (footnote 2). This\nadviser has played a key role in providing assistance to EDC in developing and implementing\ngeneration  and  distribution  projects  constructed  with  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  bilateral  aid\nassistance.  Under  the  Project,  the  services  of  an  adviser  will  be  continued  for  two  years,\nworking  principally  in  the  Corporate  Planning  and  Projects  Department,  to  help  prepare\ndocumentation  for  contracts  with  private  service  suppliers,  evaluate  bids,  and  coordinate  and\nmonitor EDC\u2019s loss reduction action plan and the capacity building components of the Project.\n\niii. \n\nTrainers for EDC Training Center\n\n54.\nEDC staff are currently undertaking technical training at the ADB-funded training center\nin  Phnom  Penh.  French  (AFD)  grant  assistance  has  been  provided  to  fund  training  on  the\ninstallation and maintenance of low and medium voltage equipment as used in the EDC system.\nBy  2004,  the  first  interconnection  with  Viet  Nam  at  230 kV  will  be  commissioned.  Under  the\nProject,  trainers  will  be  recruited  to  teach  skills  related  to  high  voltage  transmission  systems\ntogether with power utility management and system planning.\n\niv. \n\nTraining Center Facilities\n\n55.\nThe original design for the EDC training center included two dormitory blocks for use by\nout-of-town  students  and  the  academic  staff;  the  site  has  sufficient  space  for  construction  of\nthese  buildings.  Due  to  lack  of  funds,  this  item  was  deleted  from  the  scope  of  work  under\nloan 1345  (footnote  2)  and  will  be  included  under  the  Project.  The  Project  will  also  include\n\n\f16\n\npurchase  of  a  bus  to  transport  students  from  their  residences  to  the  training  center,  which  is\nlocated in the outskirts of Phnom Penh.\n\nv. \n\nHydrological Network\n\n56.\nCambodia  has  significant  hydroelectric  potential,  with  almost  none  exploited  to  date.\nPotential exists for micro, mini, small, and medium-size plants. MIME\u2019s Hydropower Department\nhas conducted several desk studies whose use is limited by a lack of hydrological data on which\nto  estimate  firm  power  and  total  energy  outputs.  There  are  areas  of  the  country  such  as  the\nKravanh Mountains in the west where microhydro projects may be feasible for village supplies\nand,  for  example,  on  the  Battambang  River  where  larger  projects,  e.g.,  of  24  MW  and  larger\ncould serve the future needs of the town and province. A small component of the loan will be\nallocated to establishing a number of flow gauges in these areas as an essential prerequisite for\nfeasibility studies. The services of a hydropower engineer-hydrologist will be provided initially to\nidentify  suitable  gauging  sites,  to  instruct  staff  of  the  Hydropower  Department  on  gauge\ninstallation  and  operation  and  on  data  collection  and  interpretation.  The  necessary  equipment\nfor two gauges on each of three rivers is included in the Project. MIME staff should be capable\nof expanding the gauging network thereafter without further assistance.\n\nC. \n\nTechnical Justification\n\n57. With  the  exception  of  Banlung  and  Kampot,  the  generating  equipment  is  in  a  state  of\nsevere  disrepair,  kept  in  operation  only  by  the  mechanical  ingenuity  of  the  operators.  In  the\ninterests of safety and economy, it must be replaced. Banlung is served by a 1 MW hydropower\nplant consisting of 2x500 kW turbine generators, with a storage reservoir to ensure dry season\nfirm capacity of 300 kW. This plant provides the sole supply for the town, although the two main\nindustries (rubber processing and wood products) have their own standby generators. The study\ncompleted  under  the  project  preparation  TA,  found  no  economic  method  to  enhance  the  firm\ncapacity of the hydropower plant.\n\n58.\nFor  the  study  towns,  no  realistic  alternatives  to  diesel  power  stations  currently  exist.\nTheoretically,  a  number  of  other  forms  of  power  generation  are  possible,  but  they  are  more\nexpensive  than  diesel  engines.  Alternative  generating  options  investigated  include  the  use  of\nrenewable  energies  such  as  biomass-fired  power  plants,  wind  energy  converters,  solar  power\ngeneration,  and  minihydro.  All  other  types  of  power  generation  conceivable  for  Cambodia\ninvolve  central  power  stations  from  which  electricity  would  be  supplied  to  the  various  towns\nthrough  transmission  lines.  Due  to  the  comparatively  low  electricity  consumption  in  the  towns\nstudied, the high capital costs of the necessary transmission lines cannot be justified.\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n59.\nThe project cost estimate is based on the TA (footnote 3), updated in June 2000, using\nMarch 2000 price levels. Costs are based on similar items of equipment supplied and installed\nrecently in Cambodia. The project cost includes all investments required in distribution and new\ngeneration  to  serve  all  new  load  growth  up  to  the  end  of  2006,  and  provide  a  solid  base  for\nfuture development. After 2006, additional but relatively smaller investments will still be required\nfor  distribution  system  expansion  and  new  generating  capacity.  These  can  be  financed  by  a\ncombination of future retained earnings, foreign aid, commercial borrowing, and/or investments\nby  local  private  power  producers  in  new  diesel  generating  capacity.  The  total  project  cost  is\nestimated to be $24.2 million equivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost is $12.1 million and\n\n\f17\n\nthe  local  currency  cost  is  $12.1  million.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  given  in  Appendix  5  and\nsummarized in Table 1.\n\nTable 1:  Project Cost Estimate\n($ million)\n\nItem\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrencyd\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nBase Costs (March 2000 prices)\nPart A:  Infrastructurea\nPart B:  Capacity Building\nSubtotal (Base Cost)\n\nContingencies\nPhysicalb\nPrice Escalationc\n\nSubtotal (Contingencies)\nInterest During Construction\n\nTotal\nPercent\n\n8.2\n1.8\n10.0\n\n1.0\n0.8\n1.8\n0.3\n12.1\n50\n\n9.1\n0.8\n9.9\n\n1.0\n0.8\n1.8\n0.4\n12.1\n50\n\n17.3\n2.6\n19.9\n\n2.0\n1.6\n3.6\n0.7\n24.2\n\n100\n\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\nIncluding land and compensation costs.\nPhysical contingencies: 10 percent.\nPrice contingencies:  2.4 percent per annum.\nIncluding duties and taxes amounting to $3.5 million (14 percent of total project cost).\n\nSource:  Staff estimates.\n\nE.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nProposed ADB financing is for a loan of up to $18.6 million equivalent (77 percent of the\n60.\ntotal  project  cost)  including  $6.5  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost  (Table  2).  ADB\nfinancing of the local currency cost is justified on the basis of the low level of national income\n($256 per capita estimated for 1999) and savings (8 percent of the national income in 1999) as\nwell as Government fiscal deficit (4 percent of gross domestic product in 1999).20 The balance\nof  $5.6 million  equivalent  will  be  financed  by  EDC  and  the  Government.  The  Government  is\nseeking parallel cofinancing from AFD of about $2.5 million equivalent on a grant basis to cover\n$1.7 million of foreign exchange costs plus $0.8 million equivalent of local currency costs. AFD\nfinancing is expected to cover the infrastructure in Stung Treng, partial provision of trainers at\nthe  EDC  training  center  and  advisers  for  EDC.  Should  the  loan  negotiations  between  the\nGovernment and AFD be successfully concluded within six months of the effectiveness date of\nthe ADB loan for the Project, and on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB, the Borrower will\nrequest that ADB reallocate or cancel the relevant portion of the loan funds. The ADB loan will\nbe  from  the  Special  Funds  resources  with  a  term  of  32  years  including  a  grace  period  of\n8 years. The annual service charge will be 1.0 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent\nthereafter.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia.  The  Government  will  relend\n$17.5 million equivalent to EDC at an interest rate of 3.5 percent per annum with a repayment\nperiod  of  20  years,  including  a  5-year  grace  period.  EDC  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk.\nThe  balance  of  the  loan  proceeds  plus  the  Government\u2019s  contribution,  will  be  passed  on  to\nEDC/MIME on a grant basis.\n\n                                                          \n20 ADB.

Two  ADB-funded  projects  (footnotes  1  and  2)  have  been  completed  in  the  power\nsector.  For  both  loans,  the  project  implementing  agency  (for  the  power  component)  was\nElectricit\u00e9 du Phnom Penh, the forerunner of EDC. EDC has shown that it has the capability to\nsuccessfully  implement  similar  projects  in  the  fields  of  power  generation  and  distribution.  The\ntechnical  aspects  of  the  Project  are  relatively  simple,  although  monitoring  and  coordinating\nactivities at the eight towns will require careful planning.\n\n62.\nEDC  will  set  up  a  project  implementation  unit  headed  by  a  senior  staff  member\nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  unit  will  be  based  at  EDC  headquarters  in  Phnom  Penh  due  to  its\ncentral  location,  but  use  will  be  made  of  MIME  provincial  offices  during  the  design  and\nconstruction  phases.  Staff  from  EDC  and  MIME  will  be  assigned  as  counterparts  to  the\nconsultants.  The \nloan  approval.  The\nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 6.\n\nimplementation  period  will  be  42  months \n\nfrom \n\n2. \n\nProcurement\n\nADB-financed procurement will be in accordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement.\n63.\nMaterials, equipment, and their installation and erection for rehabilitation and expansion of the\ndistribution systems (i.e., the medium and low voltage equipment) will be procured using ADB\nprocedures  for  procurement  of  goods  and  related  services  under  international  competitive\nbidding.  A  single  contract  will  be  awarded  for  the  distribution  systems  covering  the  work\nfinanced by ADB, this will allow the greatest flexibility during implementation and the least stock\nof spares during the operation phase. Generating sets, together with necessary spare parts for\nthe work financed by ADB, will be supplied and installed under a single, turnkey contract under\ninternational competitive bidding. This contract will include design and construction of the small-\nscale powerhouse, control building, associated facilities, and training of operators. Bids will be\nevaluated  on  the  basis  of  lifetime  costs  with  penalties  imposed  on  contractors  for  equipment\nwhose  performance  is  below  the  tendered  value.  Preference  will  be  given  to  domestic\ncontractors  and  domestically  manufactured  goods  procured  under  international  competitive\nbidding. Civil works contracts with an estimated value of more than $1 million, and contracts for\nsupply  of  goods  and  services  estimated  at  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  using\ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Other  equipment  will  be  procured  under\n\n\f19\n\ninternational shopping procedures. The works are not complex and postqualification procedures\nfor  all  contracts,  as  successfully  adopted  for  loan  1345  (footnote  2)  will  be  used.  Indicative\nprocurement  packages  are  shown  in  Appendix  7.  Procurement  of  any  project  goods  and\nservices financed by AFD will be undertaken in accordance with its own procedures.\n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n64.\nThe consulting services package will cover (i) design of the facilities in the eight selected\ntowns; (ii) assistance with tender evaluation; (iii) supervision of construction; and (iv) assistance\nwith planning, implementing, controlling, and monitoring the capacity building components of the\nproject.  These  activities  will  be  included  in  a  consulting  services  package  with  a  total  of\n48 person-months  (23 person-months  of  international  and  25  person-months  of  domestic\nconsultants). ADB approved action will be taken for advance procurement of the consultants, so\nthat  survey  and  design  work  can  commence  soon  after  loan  effectivity.  Outline  terms  of\nreference for consulting services are given in Appendix 8. Consulting services will be procured\nin  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The Government has advised\nthat a tax of 15 percent will be applied to consulting services.\n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements\n\n65.\nDisbursements of ADB funds under the Project will be mainly for supply and installation\nof goods, including turnkey contracts. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook,\ncommitment  procedures  will  be  used.  Direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for  consulting\nservices. Eligible local currency cost purchases will be reimbursed.\n\n5. \n\nMidterm Review\n\n66.\nA midterm review, to be carried out 15 months after loan effectiveness, will focus on the\ncapacity  building,  environmental,  and  training  aspects  of  the  Project  with  the  aim  of  ensuring\nthat  the  provincial  power  utilities  have  adequate  human  and  other  resources  necessary  to\nmanage the completed facilities.\n\n6.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\nOperation  and  maintenance  of  the  completed  works  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the\n67.\nprovincial  power  utility  (initially  EDC).  Staff  will  be  given  suitable  training  under  the  Project.\nA suitable provision to cover the fixed and variable costs of operation and maintenance of the\nProject  has  been  included  in  the  tariff  in  the  calculation  of  the  project  financial  internal  rate  of\nreturn, and in the preparation of financial forecasts.\n\n7. \n\nReports, Accounts, and Audits\n\nRegular  progress  reports  will  be  prepared  for  the  Project  and  submitted  to  ADB  on  a\n68.\nquarterly basis. The reports will include a description of the physical progress and a summary of\nfinancial accounts for the Project, including project expenditures during the period, year-to-date,\nand total expenditure to date. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB within three\nmonths after project completion.\n\n\f20\n\nSeparate  accounts  will  be  maintained  for  the  Project  by  EDC  in  accordance  with\n69.\ninternational  accounting  standards.  Within  six  months  of  the  close  of  the  fiscal  year,  detailed\nannual  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  of  EDC  consisting  of  an  income  statement,\nbalance sheet, and a sources and application of funds statement for each system operated by\nEDC will be submitted to ADB. These financial statements audited by an auditor acceptable to\nADB, will be submitted to ADB within twelve months of the close of the fiscal year.\n\n8. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n70.\nA  number  of  easily  measured  performance  targets  have  been  selected  to  monitor  the\nsuccess  of  the  completed  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  project  performance  monitoring\nsystem. To measure the impact on economic growth, the number of new electricity customers in\nvarious categories will be monitored by comparing baseline data with future billing records of the\nutilities,  i.e.,  number  of  new  industrial  and  commercial  customers,  and  number  of  new  social\nfacilities such as schools and clinics. The direct financial impact on the domestic sector will be\nmeasured  by  means  of  the  number  of  consumers  in  each  new  tariff  block  compared  with  the\npresent tariff. The number of consumers in the lowest consumption tariff block will indicate the\nextent to which electricity is being adopted by the low-income sectors of society. Efficiencies in\nthe  utility  operations  will  be  measured  by  data  on  electrical  losses,  sales  lost  through\nbreakdowns, employee-customer ratios, and average cost of service. The degree of compliance\nwith  financial  covenants  will  be  an  indication  of  the  performance  of  EDC  throughout  the\nimplementation period.\n\nG. \n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n1.\n\nRecent Developments\n\n71.\nAt  the  beginning  of  2000,  EDC  was  in  a  precarious  financial  position  and  unable  to\ncomply  with  its  financial  covenants.  After  ADB\u2019s  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  February  2000,  EDC\nprepared  and  started  to  implement  a  financial  recovery  action  plan  with  full  MEF  support  and\nADB agreement. The plan includes the following key elements:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe tariff structure was revised to reduce the undesirable cross-subsidies to the\ndomestic sector from industrial and commercial customers.\n\nIn  July  2000,  ADB  responded  to  a  Government  request  and  agreed  to  convert\nloan 1345 (footnote 2) to equity in order to ease EDC\u2019s debt service burden. This\nconcession  will  benefit  EDC\u2019s  branches  at  Sihanoukville  and  Siem  Reap,  the\nprincipal beneficiaries under the Provincial Power Project.\n\nThe Government has reduced its overdue electricity bills (from KR49.4 billion at\nthe end of 1999) by KR31.9 billion to less than three-months of sales. A portion\nof this amount (about KR21 billion) has been used to offset current taxes due to\nthe Government. By the end of 2000, the Government has committed to further\nreduce  overdue  accounts  by  KR7.8  billion.  For  2001,  the  receivables  of\nGovernment  ministries  and  agencies  will  be  reduced  to  the  equivalent  of  two\nmonths of sales.\n\n(iv) \n\nSpecial  measures  are  being  introduced  to  ensure  future  timely  payments  of\nelectricity bills by Government ministries and agencies:\n\n\f21\n\n(a)  Each  annual  national  budget  (approved  by  the  National  Assembly)  will\ncontain  an  allocation  for  electricity  consumption  for  each  month,  for  each\ngovernment  ministry,  agency,  or  organization.  All  ministers  and\norganization heads will be responsible for adhering to the budget.\n\n(b)  Each  organization  will  enter  into  a  contract  with  EDC  for  supply  and\n\npayment of the budgeted monthly electricity consumption.\n\n(c)  Within an agreed period after receipt of the electricity bill, the organization\nrepresentative will certify to EDC that the bill is correct or query it with EDC.\nIf  EDC  is  not  notified  within  a  specified  period,  it  may  temporarily\ndisconnect the supply to that organization.\n\n(d)  Each  certified  bill  will  be  passed  to  MEF  for  payment  to  EDC  within  two\n\nmonths of issuance of the bill.\n\n(e)  Unless  MEF  approves  reallocation  of  an  organization\u2019s  budget,  EDC  may\n\ndisconnect the supply when the budget allocation is reached.\n\n(f)  MEF\u2019s  existing  financial  controllers  will  review  consumption  on  a  monthly\nbasis and report the need for corrective action to the high level committee\n(presently the EDC Board).\n\n(v) \n\nEDC has implemented a program with AFD assistance to reduce its transmission\nand distribution losses to 20 percent in 2000, 19 percent in 2001, 18 percent in\n2002, and 17 percent thereafter.\n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  has  agreed  to  restructure  electricity  tariffs  to  enable  EDC  to\nachieve the covenanted financial targets.\n\n72.\nADB views the actions taken by EDC and Government to implement EDC\u2019s action plan\nfor financial recovery as an effective response to EDC\u2019s financial crisis. Tariffs will still need to\nbe increased in 2001 if fuel prices do not fall below forecast levels. However, the Government\nhas  raised  tariffs  over  the  last  two  years  by  over  50  percent.  These  increases  have  been  as\nmuch as could be reasonably expected politically for domestic consumers.\n\n2.\n\nEDC\u2019s Past Financial Performance\n\n73.\nEDC\u2019s  historical  financial  performance,  since  its  commercialization  in  1996  is  shown  in\nTable  3.  Figures  for  1997  and  1998  refer  to  Phnom  Penh  service  area  only.  Commencing  in\n1998, EDC produced accounts consolidating its operations in Kompong Cham, Siem Reap, and\nSihanoukville.  However,  EDC\u2019s  performance  is  dominated  by  its  operators  in  Phnom  Penh,\nwhich accounted for 93 percent of sales in 1999.\n\n\fTable 3:  EDC\u2019s (Phnom Penh) Historical Financial Performance\n\n22\n\n(KR billion)\n\nAudited 1997\n218\n29\n79\n90\n354\n\n3.5\n\n(11)\n(14)\n0\n\n0\n\u2014\n31/69\n5.3\n\nAudited 1998\n266\n22\n104\n150\n371\n\nAudited 1999\n264\n(1)\n146\n145\n504\n\n4.8\n\n(47)\n(50)\n0\n\n0\n\u2014\n65/35\n5.4\n\n35.8\n1\n(4)\n5\n\n12\n\u2014\n77/23\n5.7\n\nIndicator\nEnergy Sales (GWh)\nSales Growth (%)\nOperating Revenue\nOperating Expenditure\nAverage Revenue (KR/kWh)\nAverage Tariff Increase (%)\nOperating Income\nNet Income\nDebt Service\n\nFinancial Ratios:\nSelf Financing Ratio (%)\nDebt Service Ratio (times)a\nDebt Equity Ratio\nReceivables \u2013months\n\nGWh = gigawatt-hour; kWh = kilowatt-hour.\n\na Debt  service  ratios  were  not  calculated  since  no  debt  service  payments  were  made  on\n\nADB/World Bank loans and there was no other debt being serviced.\n\nNet  losses  of  KR14  billion  ($3.7  million)  and  KR50  billion  ($13.2  million)  in  1997  and\n74.\n1998  were  reduced  to  KR4  billion  ($1.05  million)  in  1999,  following  a  40  percent  increase  in\ntariffs in April 1999. EDC\u2019s cost of fuel and power purchases from IPPs represented 71 percent\nof  its  total  revenues  in  1999.  All  EDC\u2019s  fuel  is  imported,  and  all  its  payments  for  bulk  power\nsupply from IPPs are in dollars so that about 70 percent of its operational costs are incurred in\ndollars. Inadequate domestic tariffs, sharply rising fuel costs and high system losses were the\ncause  of  these  financial  losses.  System  losses  exceeded  30  percent  in  1997  but  have  been\nprogressively reduced to close to 20 percent in 2000. These losses together with a high level of\nunpaid  Government  electricity  bills  have  led  to  very  weak  financial  performance.  The  rate  of\nsales growth dropped sharply following the large tariff increases in early 1999.\n\n3.\n\nCompliance with Financial and Operating Covenants\n\n75.\nThe principal financial covenants agreed with EDC under the first Power Rehabilitation\nProject,  and  applied  following  its  incorporation  in  1996,  have  not  been  met.  These  principal\nfinancial  covenants  include  (i)  30  percent  minimum  level  of  self-financing  of  EDC\u2019s  average\nannual  capital  expenditure;  (ii)  a  minimum  debt  service  cover  of  1.3  times;  (iii)  a  debt-equity\nratio not  exceeding  60/40;  and  (iv)  accounts  receivable  not  exceeding  three  months  electricity\nsales. Self-financing has been less than 12 percent per annum in each of the last three years\n(1997-1999). The debt service covenant has not been relevant since the debt service payments\nunder the existing World Bank and ADB loans have not yet commenced.\n\n76.\nElectricity  sales  accounts  receivable  have  been  consistently  higher  than  five  months\nbillings,  and  well  above  the  three  months  average  electricity  sales  level  agreed  with  ADB.\nNoncompliance  has  been  almost  entirely  due  to  the  level  of  accounts  receivable  from  the\nGovernment.  Nongovernment  arrears  amount  to  less  than  one  month  of  sales,  as  a  result  of\nstrict  compliance  with  the  disconnection  policy.  The  high  levels  of  receivables  and  the\n\n\f23\n\nsuccession  of  operating  losses  has  placed  EDC  in  a  severe  liquidity  crisis  that  has  led  to  the\nneed for short-term borrowing.\n\n4.\n\nElectricity Tariffs\n\n77.\nCambodia does not have a policy of uniform tariffs; each town has a tariff based on the\ncost of supply. EDC's average tariff increase for Phnom Penh of about 40 percent in April 1999\nplaced  the  entire  burden  of  that  tariff  increase  on  commercial  and  industrial  consumers,  while\nleaving  domestic  tariffs  unchanged.  As  a  result  of  this  large  tariff  increase,  many  of  the  larger\ncommercial and industrial consumers began to generate their own power, which was less costly\nthan  the  EDC  tariff  rate.  For  the  last  tariff  adjustment  in  August  2000,  EDC  recognized  that\ndomestic tariffs, which had remained unchanged at KR350 ($0.091) per kWh since 1995, would\nalso have to increase significantly (footnote 8). A lifeline tariff of KR350 per kWh was retained\nfor domestic consumption up to 50 kWh per month, to protect smaller, low-income consumers.\nFor  domestic  consumption  from  50  to  100  kWh  per  month,  the  tariff  increased  to  KR550\n($0.143)  per  kWh,  and  for  consumption  in  excess  of  100  kWh  the  tariff  increased  to  KR650\n($0.169)  per  kWh.  Although  the  percentage  increase  for  this  last  group  is  high,  most\nconsumption  by  large  domestic  accounts  was  actually  being  used  by  commercial  enterprises\ntaking  advantage  of  the  low  domestic  tariff.  Now  any  domestic  consumption  in  excess  of\n100 kWh  per  month  is  charged  at  the  same  tariff  as  small  commercial  consumers.  EDC's\ncurrent  tariff  structure,  and  the  estimated  cross-subsidies  in  this  structure,  are  summarized  in\nTable 4.\n\nTable 4:  EDC Tariff Structure and Cross Subsidies in Phnom Penh\n\nShare of\nEnergy\nSold (%)\n\nUp to 31\nJuly 2000\n\nAverage Tariff\n\nFrom 1 Aug. 2000\n\nEstimated\nCost\nof Supply\n\nKR/kWh\n\nKR/kWh\n\n$/kWh\n\nKR/kWh\n\nEstimated\nCross\nSubsidy\n(% cost of\nsupply)\n59\n27\n4\n(27)\n(19)\n(42)\n(51)\n(45)\n(33)\n\n350\n550\n650\n700\n800\n641\n640\n582\n480\n604\n\n0.091\n0.143\n0.169\n0.182\n0.208\n0.166\n0.166\n0.151\n0.125\n0.157\n\n850\n750\n675\n550\n675\n450\n425\n400\n360\n604\n\nCategory\n\nDomestic, <50 kWh/month\nDomestic, 50-100 kWh/month\nDomestic, >100 kWh/month\nGovernment\nForeigners\nHotels\nCommercial\nIndustrial\nMedium Voltage\nAverage Tariff\n\n12.9\n10.3\n24.3\n16.3\n7.3\n2.2\n10.4\n12.4\n4.0\n\n350\n350\n350\n700\n800\n787\n640\n632\n540\n521\n\n5.\n\nEDC\u2019s Financial Projections\n\n78.\nFinancial projections for 2004 to 2010 were prepared for the project towns, and for 2000\nto  2007  for  the  consolidated  accounts  of  EDC  including  its  branches  at  Kompong  Cham,\nSiem Reap,  and  Sihanoukville,  and  the  project  towns.  A  summary  of  EDC\u2019s  projected\nconsolidated  financial  performance  based  on  EDC\u2019s  planned  investments  and  electricity  sales\nforecasts  is  provided  in  Table  5.

For example, in mid-2000, EDC converted its diesel generators at the C6 power station\nfrom  diesel  fuel  to  cheaper  heavy  fuel  oil.  In  2004,  when  the  Viet  Nam-Phnom  Penh\ninterconnection  is  built,  economies  should  also  be  achieved  from  the  purchase  of  lower  cost\npower from Viet Nam.\n\n80.\nAlthough  EDC  and  Government  have  taken  several  steps  to  effect  EDC\u2019s  financial\nrecovery, these are not sufficient to offset continuing high prices for fuel based on international\nprices for crude oil, currently above $30 a barrel. The financial projections incorporate the tariffs\napplicable from 1 August 2000, and conversion of ADB\u2019s earlier loan to equity. The projections\nassume fuel costs are based on international crude oil prices of $28 in 2000, $25 in 2001, $21 in\n2002,  and  $20  thereafter  (based  on  World  Bank  estimates).  With  these  assumptions,  the\nfinancial forecasts show that EDC will continue to incur a loss of nearly KR50 billion in 2000 and\nover  KR30  billion  in  2001.  Therefore,  tariff  increases  of  about  13 percent,  7  percent,  and  8\npercent per year are needed in 2001, 2002, and 2003, to meet the covenanted financial targets.\nTo meet the projected cash shortfall in 2000, EDC will need to seek additional working capital\nfunds of about KR44 billion to meet its commitments for fuel, power purchases, and finances of\nother current assets.\n\nIn  the  case  of  the  provincial  towns  being  financed  under  the  Project,  the  Government\n81.\nhas agreed to set tariffs for each town at levels to achieve cash breakeven every full financial\nyear  after  project  commissioning  and  3  percent  rate  of  return  on  net  revalued  fixed  assets  in\nservice in the first full year after commissioning and 4 percent thereafter. The current weighted\naverage  tariff  in  the  eight  provincial  towns  is  about  $0.26  per  kWh.  With  the  Project  and  to\nachieve the targeted covenants, the weighted average tariffs in 2004 could be reduced by about\n7 percent for a far superior and sustainable service. Between 2004 and 2010, the average tariffs\nin the project towns are forecast to fall by over 20 percent in real terms. The project towns will\nneed  working  capital  for  start-up  to  pay  for  fuel,  power  purchases,  salaries,  and  for  financing\nreceivables,  etc.  EDC  will  accordingly  be  expected  to  provide  working  capital  from  its  own\nsources of funds for the provincial towns.\n\n\f25\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1. \n\nEnvironment\n\nThe  major  physical  component  of  the  Project  is  to  rehabilitate  electricity  facilities  in\n82.\nselected  provincial  towns.  The  rehabilitation  will  include  replacement  of  old  distribution\nequipment  and  facilities  such  as  transformers,  installation  of  small-size  diesel  generating  sets\n(250-500 kW range), and improvement of medium and low voltage distribution systems. These\nmajor  components  are  expected  to  have  only  small  environmental  impacts,  and  the  other\ncomponents of the Project, i.e., those related to capacity building, have no or minimal adverse\nimpacts on the environment. Consultants for the ADB-financed TAs 2629 (footnote 3) and 3256\n(footnote  4)  conducted  an  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  the  Government  and\nexecuting  agency.  Based  on  the  IEE,  no  environmental  impact  assessment  is  needed  for  the\nProject. The Project is classified as Environment Category B, and the summary IEE is attached\nas Appendix 10.\n\nEnvironmental impacts associated with the construction of access roads, power stations,\n83.\nsubstations,  etc.  are  expected  to  be  small,  and  consist  of  dust  and  noise  during  construction,\nand a risk of fuel oil spillage during operation. The new generators will be equipped with exhaust\ngas  silencers  to  reduce  noise  levels  to  below  100  decibels  at  the  plant  and  40  decibels  at  a\ndistance  of  200  meters.  Provided  maintenance  schedules  are  adhered  to,  this  level  will  be\nmaintained for the life of the plant. Concerning air pollution, the diesel engines will be specified\nto  conform  to  accepted  international  standards  for  maximum  concentrations  of  carbon\nmonoxide,  nitrogen  oxide,  and  particulates.  As  part  of  the  turnkey  contract,  operators  will\nreceive training by the manufacturers on monitoring emissions and taking corrective measures,\nif  they  are  required.  Noise  and  air  pollution  caused  by  the  new  generators  will  remain\nsubstantially  below  the  levels  from  the  existing  plants.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  distribution\nfacilities  may  cause  minor  environmental  impacts.  However,  sufficient  precautions  and\nmitigation measures will be taken. In particular, when old transformers are replaced, the oil will\nbe  tested  for  the  presence  of  toxic  polychlorinated  biphenyl  (PCB).  If  PCBs  are  present,\ndisposal will be done in a strictly controlled and acceptable way such as incineration at a very\nhigh  temperature.  Transformer  oil  containing  PCBs  must  be  thermally  destroyed  at  a\ntemperature above 1,300 degrees Celsius. As such an incinerator is not available in Cambodia,\nPCB-contaminated  transformer  oil  will  be  transported  in  appropriate  containers,  either  to  a\ncement factory in Cambodia where it can be burned in the kiln or to a neighboring country with\nsuitable  facilities.  In  the  former  case,  the  kiln  temperature  should  be  maintained  above  1,300\ndegrees Celsius at all times while the oil is being burned, and in the latter case, the oil should be\nexported  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Basel  Convention.  Provided  that  all  the\nmitigation measures are implemented as specified in the IEE report, the adverse environmental\nimpacts  will  be  reduced  to  a  minimal  level.  An  environment  unit  established  in  EDC  will  be\nresponsible for implementing and monitoring the environmental management plan.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\nThe  Project  will  improve  access  to  a  reliable  electricity  supply  to  residents  in  the  eight\n84.\nprovincial capital towns and nearby villages. The beneficiaries will include over 100,000 persons\nin 21,000 households who will receive a superior electricity service for a cost less than the cost\nof supply prevailing at the time of connection.21 Further details of projected tariffs in the project\ntowns  are  given  in  Appendix  9.  In  addition,  from  2004-2010,  about  70,000  persons  in  13,000\n\n                                                          \n21 Except in Banlung and Prey Veng where current tariffs are below the average for the project towns.\n\n\f26\n\nhouseholds  will  receive  a  power  supply  for  the  first  time.  About  30  percent  of  the  direct\nbeneficiaries  are  living  below  the  poverty  line.  The  benefits  will  accrue  to  the  consumers  not\nonly in terms of increased opportunity for study and livelihood activities, resulting in increased\ndisposable  income,  but  the  towns  will  become  a  greater  market  for  products  from  the  rural\nhinterland where living standards will consequently increase. Various sectors of society in each\nof the provincial towns covered by the Project will benefit. For households and businesses that\nare  already  connected  to  a  central  supply,  the  service  will  be  much  improved,  i.e.,  to  24-hour\ncoverage,  improved  voltage  levels,  and  reduced  interruptions  in  supply.  These  improvements\nwill increase the life of household appliances and hence reduce the cost of replacements. These\nfactors will also be an incentive for businesses to invest in more productive equipment and spur\neconomic growth.\n\nBased  on  site  visits  and  interviews,  only  minimal  resettlement  impacts  are  expected  to\n85.\nresult  from  the  Project.  The  installation  of  a  new  power  plant  in  Sisophon  will  require  the\nresettlement  of  four  households  (26  people).  The  compensation  for  loss  of  land  and  buildings\nwill  follow  the  resettlement  plan  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB  (para.  108[xii]).  New\npower plants and substations in the other seven provincial towns will not result in resettlement\nimpacts.  Generator  noise  and  pollution  are  not  expected  to  cause  resettlement  impacts,  or\nhealth or nuisance problems due to the (i) adequate distance between households in the area\nand the proposed sites for power plants; (ii) installation of lower noise, less-polluting generators;\nand (iii) appropriate construction or rehabilitation of power plant buildings.\n\n86.\nThe  installation  of  small  indoor  distribution  substations  (5  meters  by  5  meters),  pole-\nmounted distribution substations, and transmission lines is not expected to cause resettlement\nimpacts at any of the sites, as this infrastructure will be located in the right-of-way along existing\nroads. The precise location along roads for the small indoor distribution substations has not yet\nbeen  determined,  but  site  visit  findings  suggest  that  ample  areas  exist  for  installing  these\nsubstations without affecting households or businesses.\n\n87.\nPrivate  operators  who  are  licensed  by  MIME  are  aware  that  their  licenses  will  not  be\nrenewed when the project facilities are installed. Suppliers operating without a license will close\nas their customers avail of the new improved service. These operators will be given about two\nyears  notice  of  the  coming  Project,  ample  time  for  them  to  relocate  or  close  their  operations.\nTheir  current  investments  in  generation  are  likely  to  be  fully  depreciated  by  2003,  if  not  well\nbefore  that  time.  Finally,  as  indicated  by  the  largest  producer  in  Stung  Treng,  some  suppliers\nare looking to leave the business due to profitability problems associated with the current high\nprice of diesel fuel. Staff of these operators will be given preference in employment by EDC at\nthe project power plants (para. 108[xii]).\n\n88.\nIndigenous  people  and  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  areas  will  not  be  adversely\naffected  by  the  Project.  Mainstream  Khmer  and  Chinese,  Vietnamese,  Lao,  and  Cham\nminorities  live  in  the  project  areas.  Banlung  and  Stung  Treng  urban  districts  also  have  a\nsubstantial  proportion  of  hill  tribe  ethnic  minorities.  Among  the  five  ethnic  minority  groups\nidentified, the Chinese, who are heavily concentrated in urban centers, hold a controlling share\nof  Cambodian  business  activities  and  are  expected  to  benefit  more  substantially  from  the\nelectricity supply than the mainstream Khmer population. The Moslem Cham constitute a small\nminority (2-6 percent) in most of the eight urban districts with a relatively strong concentration\nalong  the  coast  near  Kampot.  In  the  province  of  Rattanakiri,  hill  tribes  include  the  Tum  Boun,\nKarchak, Proeuv, and Lunn who are seminomadic; many are among the poorest in Cambodia.\nSince  the  Project  will  not  adversely  affect  the  ethnic  minorities,  an  indigenous  people\u2019s\ndevelopment plan is not necessary.\n\n\f27\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\n1. \n\nSubproject Selection\n\n89.\nThe  eight  project  towns  were  selected  from  a  longer  list  of  candidates  based  on\nquantitative  and  qualitative  criteria.  The  criteria  were  accessibility  and  the  prevailing  security\nsituation,  existence  of  conditions  favorable  to  economic  growth  and  job  creation,  proportion  of\nexisting  population  engaged  in  nonagricultural  employment,  cost  per  kW  of  new  installed\ncapacity,  cost  per  consumer  connection,  environmental  impact,  comments  of  potential\nstakeholders,  and  benefits  for  ethnic  minorities.  In  terms  of  development  potential,  the  towns\nwere ranked in descending order as follows: Sisophon, Kampong Speu, Kampot, Svay Rieng,\nTakeo, Prey Veng, Banlung, and Stung Treng.\n\n2. \n\nLoad Forecast\n\n90.\nThe  load  forecast  is  fundamental  to  project  planning.  The  load  growth  in  the  project\ntowns  is  one  of  the  major  decisive  factors  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution\nplanning,  and  therefore  has  a  decisive  impact  on  the  investment  costs  required  for  the\nrehabilitation of the power systems in each town. Load forecast also has a major impact on the\neconomic  and  financial  feasibility  of  these  investments.  Details  of  the  load  forecast  are\ndescribed in Appendix 11, and are summarized in this section. The load forecast is based on a\nmodel that forecasts sales in three consumer categories: residential, commercial and industrial,\nand public offices and schools.\n\n91.\nThe residential consumer group is the largest, and accounts for about 70 percent of total\nsales in most towns. The Project will replace the distribution systems in the towns and extend\nservice  to  outlying  communities  around  each  town  within  1  or  2  km.  The  total  number  of\nresidential  consumers  will  increase  by  about  20  percent  as  a  result  of  rehabilitation  and\nextension of the distribution systems. In addition, the number of customers will increase due to\npopulation growth; and  sales per customer will increase due to income growth and to relief of\nsupply-side constraints, currently a problem in many towns. Separate forecasts were prepared\nfor  each town. Commercial  and industrial sales are typically about 20 percent of total sales in\nthe  provincial  towns,  and  are  forecast  to  grow  about  9-10  percent  annually  due  to  general\neconomic  growth.  Sales  for  public  sector  offices,  buildings,  and  street  lighting  constitute  the\nbalance of about 10 percent of sales. Sales will grow with general economic growth, and a one-\ntime increase when the Project is commissioned due to improved street lighting. Total electricity\nsales are expected to increase by about 133 percent from 1999 until 2004, the first full year of\nproject operation, and by about 10.7 percent annually thereafter.\n\n92.\nThe increase in total generation required when the Project is commissioned will be less,\ndue to the sharp reduction in distribution losses, from an average 46 percent at present to about\n18 percent after rehabilitation. The high current levels of losses are based on statistics on total\ngeneration  and  sales  in  1999.  The  forecast  losses  after  rehabilitation  are  based  on  actual\nexperience in the towns of Sihanoukville and Siem Riep, which were rehabilitated in 1998 under\nthe  first  ADB-financed  Power  Rehabilitation  Project,  and  where  average  losses  in  1999  after\nrehabilitation were reduced to about 18 percent. In 2004, when the Project begins operation, the\ntotal  generation  demand  in  the  eight  towns  covered  by  the  Project  is  expected  to  be  about\n18,100 MWh, with a peak annual load of about 5.6 MW. This is about 54 percent higher than\ntotal generation in 1999.\n\n\f28\n\n3. \n\nLeast Cost Analysis\n\n93.\nThe plans for development and expansion of power supplies under this Project include\ncomplete  replacement  of  the  distribution  systems  in  seven  of  the  eight  towns,  and  the\nconstruction of new diesel power plants or transmission interconnections to larger grid systems.\nAt present all of these towns are isolated from any interconnected grid. The distribution systems\nare generally in very poor condition. Voltage levels of the medium voltage distribution lines are\ntoo  low  for  modern  utility  designs,  and  will  all  be  upgraded  and  standardized  at  22  kV  for  the\nnew systems. Distribution losses are very high, typically about 35-50 percent. The only practical\nway  to  reduce  losses  and  to  serve  future  growth  is  to  replace  these  old  distribution  systems\ncompletely  and  implement  new  management  systems.  Only  Banlung  has  a  satisfactory\ndistribution system, which just needs expansion.\n\n94.\nFor isolated power systems of this size, the least costly form of independent bulk power\nsupply  is  diesel  power  generation.  Transmission  interconnections  with  larger  power  systems\nwere  also  considered  wherever  feasible.  Kompong  Speu  will  be  interconnected  with  Phnom\nPenh. For Takeo, a transmission interconnection with Phnom Penh was considered but it would\nbe  too  costly.  For  Svay  Rieng,  a  22  kV  transmission  interconnection  to  Viet  Nam  is  the  least\ncost source of bulk power supply. For Sisophon, the recommended least cost plan is to supply\nload  growth  with  diesel  generation  initially,  and  then  to  connect  this  town  later  to  a  planned\n115 kV transmission interconnection with Thailand. After this interconnection is commissioned,\nthe diesel generating units can be moved to another town.\n\n4. \n\nEconomic and Financial Evaluation\n\n95.\nFor the economic analysis, the economic benefits of the Project are divided into two parts.\nThe first is the cost saving due to replacing the old and inefficient current power supply systems in\nthe  towns.  The  second  is  the  benefit  of  additional  electricity  sales  arising  from  the  Project.  The\ncost saving due to replacing the current power systems is based on the tariffs that are currently\ncharged  in  each  town.  These  tariffs  are  just  adequate  to  cover  their  operating  costs,  but\ndepreciation is either neglected or very minimal, and interest charges are always ignored.\n\nResidential  consumers  use  electricity  primarily  for  lighting,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  for\n96.\ntelevision,  radios,  fans,  and  other  electrical  appliances.  However,  electricity  is  not  used  for\ncooking,  since  it  is  much  more  costly  than  firewood  or  kerosene.  The  additional  electricity\nconsumption for residential consumers is valued on the basis of the average willingness to pay for\nelectricity based on a demand versus price curve that was derived from data for various towns in\nCambodia. The resulting average economic benefit of residential consumption is estimated to be\n$0.35 per kWh.\n\nCommercial and small industrial consumers, and public buildings, which account for about\n97.\n30 percent of total energy sales in provincial towns, use electricity for lighting, refrigeration and air-\nconditioning, mechanical drives, and other applications. In the absence of public electricity supply,\nsmall diesel generator sets are used to meet their power requirements. The weighted average of\ncurrent tariffs and alternative economic costs of self-generation is estimated to be $0.26 per kWh\nin economic prices.\n\n98.\nThe economic evaluation of each of the eight towns included in the Project is described in\nAppendix  11.  The  overall  Project  has  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of\n17.8 percent for the base case. However, the economic evaluation of benefits is conservative, as\nno attempt was made to evaluate the benefits of improved reliability and quality of power supply,\n\n\f29\n\nand cost savings to many individual consumers who require standby private generating sets now\nto ensure reliable power.\n\n99.\nSensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  economic  performance  of  the  Project  is  robust  for\nmoderate  increases  in  fuel  costs  or  capital  costs.  The  Project  can  tolerate  a  large  increase  in\ncrude  oil  price  up  to  $44  per  barrel,  at  which  point  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)\nreduces  to  a  marginal  12  percent.  The  project  economics  are  most  sensitive  to  reductions  in\nestimated unit benefits or in total energy sales. The Project would switch to becoming uneconomic\nif average benefit rates for new sales were reduced more than 30 percent, based on a minimum\n12 percent EIRR.\n\n100.\nThe financial evaluation is based on the financial revenues from electricity sales from the\nProject, starting in 2004. It is assumed that tariffs will be adjusted as shown in Appendix 11. The\naverage planned tariff, three years after project commissioning, will be about 24 percent lower\nthan the existing average tariff, at year 2000 price levels. The average financial internal rate of\nreturn  (FIRR)  for  the  overall  Project  is  estimated  to  be  4.2  percent,  just  enough  to  meet  the\nweighted average cost of capital to EDC for the project financing of 4.1 percent. Therefore, the\nFIRR for this Project is satisfactory.\n\nB. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n101. After  two  decades  of  civil  unrest  and  conflict  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  poverty  is\npervasive  in  Cambodia.  In  1999,  the  Government  estimated  the  poverty  line  at  KR240,000\n($62.52)  per  month  per  household  (consisting  of  an  average  of  5.3  persons),  i.e.,  $0.39  per\nperson per day for the urban areas other than Phnom Penh. This was the income required to\nbuy food of an average energy intake of 2,100 calories per person per day and a minimum of\nnonfood items, and is well below the international standard of $1 per person per day. According\nto  the  1999  national  census,  the  average  monthly  household  income  in  Cambodia  was\nKR484,000,  equivalent  to  $126.  Appendix  12  (Table  A12.1)  shows  the  average  household\nincome by sector of employment in the project areas.\n\n102.\nThe  average  monthly  household  income  in  the  eight  towns  ranges  from  KR322,000  to\nKR597,000  (equivalent  to  $0.51  to  $0.97  per  person  per  day).  Within  each  town  and\nemployment  sector,  income  levels  vary  widely  but  about  30  percent  of  the  population  in  the\nproject  towns  are  living  below  the  poverty  line.  This  is  not  significantly  different  from  the\nproportion nationally. However, Table A12.2 in Appendix 12 shows that the incidence of poverty\nin Sisophon and Prey Veng is significantly higher than the national average, so that the Project\nwill have a poverty reduction impact in these towns.\n\n103.\nIn the project towns, the present electricity tariffs range from KR800 ($0.21) to KR1,600\n($0.41)  per  kWh  apart  from  Banlung  where  the  tariff  is  between  KR200  ($0.05)  and  KR400\n($0.10)  per  kWh  (footnote  21).  Given  an  average  monthly  household  income  of  KR450,000  in\nthe  project  urban  districts  and  an  average  residential  household  consumption  of  25  kWh,  the\naffordability ratio, i.e., the proportion of household income spent on electricity as a percentage\nof  total  income  is  5.6  percent,  which  is  comparable  to  other  countries  at  a  similar  level  of\ndevelopment. However, the many households living close to the poverty line are clearly unable\nto  afford  even  the  average  consumption  level.  Nevertheless,  the  quality  of  light  from  a  10  W\nfluorescent lamp is so superior to alternative wicklamps, that even poor people are anxious to\nbe  connected.  If  a  supply  is  not  available,  many  are  prepared  to  use  car  batteries  from  which\nenergy costs up to $1 per kWh. Poor people are just able to afford one or two 10 W lamps plus\na small black and white television set, which in total consume 8-10 kWh per month. Even at the\n\n\f30\n\nvery  high  prices  being  charged  in  many  areas  and  with  an  affordability  ratio  of  5  percent,\nhouseholds  with  an  income  as  low  as  KR150,000  per  month  ($40),  i.e.,  $0.24  per  person  per\nday, and well below the poverty line could obtain the benefits of an electricity supply if it were\navailable.  Extended  coverage  and  average  lower  tariffs  resulting  from  the  Project  will  make\nelectricity  more  affordable  to  a  greater  number  of  poor  households.  To  assist  new  customers\nwith the initial cost of connection, EDC will offer to construct and own the meter and the service\nconnection line for new residential consumers, and will recover this cost through an additional\nmonthly charge.\n\n104. Without  doubt,  almost  every  household  strives  for  an  electricity  supply  to  facilitate\nchildren\u2019s  study,  and  via  television,  reduce  people\u2019s  isolation  and  make  them  aware  of\nopportunities  and  their  own  potential,  as  well  as  directly  lengthening  the  productive  hours  of\ncottage  industries.  An  affordable,  reliable,  electricity  supply  has  an  almost  direct  impact  on\npoverty,  as  defined  by  ADB,22  by  providing  a  direct  means  to  enable  users  to  sustain\nthemselves by their labor, and through information services become empowered to participate\nin making the decisions that shape their lives.\n\nC. \n\nRisks\n\n105.\nThe  Project  is  technically  simple  and  straightforward,  and  given  EDC\u2019s  record  on\nprevious  loans,  the  risk  of  serious  cost  overruns  or  implementation  delays  on  the  physical\ninfrastructure are considered small. There are risks with the economic outcome of the Project if\nload  demand  does  not  increase  as  forecast  due  to  such  factors  as  political  instability  or\neconomic  recession.  This  risk  has  been  reduced  by  designing  the  Project  to  provide  new\ngenerating  capacity  to  meet  anticipated  load  growth  for  three  years  after  commissioning,  i.e,\n2004-2006,  at  which  time,  further  investment  will  be  required.  This  approach  has  limited  the\nvalue of assets that will not be fully utilized if demand does not increase as rapidly as expected.\nEconomic viability could also be compromised if loss reductions and efficiency improvements do\nnot  materialize  as  expected.  Anticipated  improvements  are  based  on  actual  performance  of\nEDC's  systems  at  Sihanoukville  and  Siem  Reap.  With  the  additional  years  of  operating\nexperience  by  the  date  of  commissioning,  EDC  should  exceed  the  expected  improvement\nlevels.\n\n106.\nThe economic analysis has been based on an estimated crude oil price of $20 per barrel\nin  2004,  which  is  slightly  higher  than  the  latest  World  Bank  forecast.  With  higher  fuel  prices,\ntariffs  can  be  raised  to  maintain  EDC\u2019s  income  at  a  level  to  meet  the  financial  covenants,  but\nwith  the  risk  that  tariffs  become  unaffordable  to  poorer  consumers  and  that  demand  in  all\nsectors  will  be  reduced.  However,  the  Project  will  become  uneconomic  if  crude  oil  prices  rise\nabove about $44 per barrel.\n\nThere  is  a  risk  that  the  capacity  building  components  will  not  fully  achieve  their\n107.\nobjectives.  Their  success  depends  on  recruiting  suitable  staff,  motivating  them  to  learn  new\nskills, and retaining them within the organization for a suitable period after training. EDC, as an\nindependent company, is able to set attractive remuneration levels that up to now have enabled\nit  to  retain  suitable  staff.  If  suitable  candidates  are  not  available  from  within  the  country,  then\nrecruitment from outside is possible.\n\n                                                          \n22 ADB. 1999.

Information  is  also\nprovided on the potential beneficiaries of the Project; beneficiaries include the population of the\nprovincial towns who will gain access to electricity, or will benefit from a more reliable electricity\nsupply.  By  improving  the  reliability  of,  and  access  to,  electricity,  the  Project  will  play  an\nimportant  role  in  increasing  economic  growth  and  the  standard  of  living  in  each  of  the  eight\ntowns. Data on the existing electricity systems is given in Table A4.\n\nA.\n\nBanlung\n\nBanlung, the capital of Rattanakiri province, is located in northeastern Cambodia about\n2.\n400  kilometers  (km)  from  Phnom  Penh.  The  province\u2019s  economy  is  highly  dependent  on  the\nagriculture  sector,  including  cash  crops  such  as  rubber  and  wood  processing  for  flooring  and\nwall cladding. Plans for additional cash crop plantations, such as palm oil, are being considered\nfor the future.\n\n3.\nBanlung has a population of 11,256 (2,095 households), compared with a total of 94,243\npeople living in Rattanakiri province. About 60 percent of Banlung households have access to\nelectricity, while 40 percent of households depend on kerosene, batteries, and other sources to\nserve lighting and electrical needs. Banlung is served by a 1 megawatt (MW) hydropower plant,\nfinanced  by  grant  aid  and  commissioned  in  1993.  Of  the  provincial  towns  under  consideration\nfor the Project, Banlung has the largest population of ethnic minorities, primarily hill tribes such\nas  the  Kachak,  Tum  Boun,  and  Lunn.  Although  the  census  does  not  collect  information  on\nethnicity, census information on religion can serve as a useful proxy since most Khmer people\nare  Buddhist,  most  Cham  people  are  Muslim,  and  most  hill  tribe  people\u2019s  religion  would  fall\nunder  the  census  category  of  \u201cother.\u201d    In  Banlung,  about  70  percent  of  the  population  is\nBuddhist, 26 percent is \u201cother,\u201d and 3 percent is Muslim.\n\nIn  Banlung \n\n4.\ntelecommunication office, one health center, 32 workshops, about 50 shops, and three hotels.\n\nthere  are  11  schools,  18  administrative  offices,  one  post  and\n\nB.\n\nKampot\n\nfrom  Phnom  Penh \n\n5.\nThe  city  of  Kampot  is  the  capital  of  Kampot  province  and  is  located  about  150  km\nsouthwest of Phnom Penh on the banks of the river Chhou. The city is located on the railway\nline \ntown  has  a  population  of  32,200\n(6,060 households),  compared  with  the  province\u2019s  total  population  of  528,405  people.  The\nelectrification  ratio  is  estimated  by  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy  (MIME)  to  be\nabout 60 percent.\n\nto  Sihanoukville.  Kampot \n\n6.\nKampot is considered as an important tourist center being close to the seaside town of\nKep and to Bokor village, which is located near the Phnom Popok Mountain (with an altitude of\n1,080 meters). During the weekends, the town is frequented by people from Phnom Penh who\nseek relaxation from the capital. This has led to new investment during the last couple of years\nin the commercial sector and has improved the supply in the service sector considerably.\n\nOn  the  commercial  side,  Kampot  has  seven  hotels,  some  with  more  than  40  rooms,\n7.\naround  10  guest-houses,  and  about  50  restaurants.  The  town  has  three  petrol  stations  and\nmore than 40 workshops and manufacturing establishments, among them four ice factories and\n\n\f42\n\nAppendix 4, page 2\n\nabout 10 wood workshops. There are about 600 handicraft centers and cottage industries in and\naround the city. Along the river, some shipyards build wooden ships. In the public sector, there\nare  more \nthem  a  post  and\ntelecommunication  office  and  a  police  station.  There  are,  in  addition,  nine  schools  and  five\nhospitals/health centres.\n\nthan  30  government  and  administrative  offices,  among \n\n8.\nKampot  town  is  known  to  be  home  to  a  significant  number  of  Cham  people.  This  is\nsupported by census information, which estimates that 11 percent of the people in Kampot town\nare  Muslim,  the  religion  of  the  Cham  people.  The  remainder  of  Kampot  town\u2019s  population  are\npracticing Buddhists.\n\n9.\nThe  city  of  Kep  is  located  about  20  km  southeast  of  Kampot  and  prior  to  the  civil  war\nwas  an  important  tourist  area.  The  intention  of  the  authorities  is  to  promote  Kep  as  a\ntourist resort.  The  population  in  1997  was  around  10,000  people.  Future  development  in  this\ntown is likely to lie mainly in the tourism sector. At present, not much economic development is\nto be observed in Kep. A transmission line existed between the two towns before the civil war\n(1970-1975). Some of the old transmission poles are still in place, but there are no connectors\nand  insulators.  The  Project  will  include  a  check  on  the  feasibility  of  extending  the  new\ndistribution system to supply Kep.\n\nC.\n\nKompong Speu\n\n10.\nKompong  Speu  is  the  capital  of  Kompong  Speu  province  and  is  located  about  48  km\nsouthwest of Phnom Penh on National Road No. 4 on the route to the city of Sihanoukville. The\ncity has a population of 30,250 in 5,500 households. The river Prek Thnot divides the city in two\nparts, the northern part is less populated. Altogether there are five communities, of which four\nhave  about  the  same  population  (around  5,000)  and  one  is  larger.  The  city  was  almost\ncompletely destroyed during the civil war, and approximately 90 percent of the original town has\nbeen reconstructed. The population of the whole province of Kompong Speu is just above half a\nmillion.\n\n11.\nKompong Speu town is the only one of the selected towns that currently has no public\npower supply system. The old power station had existed before the civil war stopped operation\nduring  the  war;  none  of  the  remaining  equipment  is  serviceable.  The  installed  capacity  before\nthe war was in the range of 1 MW. Before the war the majority of the houses were connected to\nthe  electric  grid.  Today  power  generation  and  distribution  is  organized  by  seven  private\nsuppliers  who  operate  their  systems  completely  independently  of  the  Provincial  Cabinet  of\nIndustry, Mines and Energy.\n\n12.\nThe town has a busy market in the center; two hotels; a number of restaurants, amongst\nthem  four  larger  ones;  and  nine  petrol  stations  (as  a  pass-through  place  on  the  main  road  to\nSihanoukville).  Kompong  Speu  has  about  200  manufacturing  establishments  (including\nhandicrafts),  including  73  rice  mills  and  two  ice  factories.  Kompong  Speu  town  has  about  10\nschools,  a  post-telecommunication  office,  a  police  station,  and  two  health  centers.  For  local\ndevelopment  and  social  projects  about  10  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  offices  are\nlocated  in  the  town.  According  to  census  data,  about  half  of  the  town\u2019s  economically  active\npopulation  is  engaged  in  the  agriculture  sector,  while  the  other  half  is  employed  in\nmanufacturing, construction, retail, and services. MIME estimates indicate that about 40 percent\nof households have access to electricity. Lighting for the remaining 60 percent is produced by\nkerosene or batteries.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 4, page 3\n\nD.\n\nPrey Veng\n\n13.\nPrey Veng town, the capital of Prey Veng province, is located on a floodplain east of the\nMekong River in southeastern Cambodia about 90 km east of Phnom Penh. Prey Veng town\u2019s\nfloodplain  location  is  suitable  for  rice  production,  on  which  the  economy  is  highly  dependent.\nCensus  findings  bear  this  out;  about  94  percent  of  Prey  Veng  town\u2019s  economically  active\npopulation is employed in agriculture and/or fisheries.\n\nPrey Veng urban area has a population of 55,050 (10,918 households), compared with\n14.\nthe  overall  population  in  the  province  of  946,042.  According  to  MIME  data,  only  about\n17 percent of Prey Veng town\u2019s population has access to electricity, with the remainder of the\npopulation  depending  on  kerosene  and  batteries  to  power  light  sources  and  other  electrical\nappliances  (e.g.,  fans,  televisions).  About  35  percent  of  Prey  Veng  town\u2019s  households  are\nheaded by women, the highest proportion in the eight project towns.\n\n15.\nThe commercial and industrial base in Prey Veng is more limited than in other towns at\nsimilar distances from Phnom Penh. There are 20 rice mills in the town, which process the rice\ngrown in the area. Other manufacturing establishments comprise three ice factories and about\n30  workshops  (metal,  wood,  etc.).  There  are  four  petrol  stations  in  Prey  Veng,  one  hotel,  two\nguest-houses, and a handful of restaurants. The establishment of food processing plants can be\nseen as an option for the future.\n\n16.\nIn the public sector, there are six schools, two hospitals, a police station, and a post and\ntelecommunication  office.  There  is  also  an  army  camp  in  the  town.  Moreover,  Prey  Veng  has\nsome 25 government and administrative offices plus a small number of NGOs and international\naid  agencies,  among  them  the  European  Union  and  the  German  Agency  for  Technical\nCooperation. Both these organizations operate projects outside Prey Veng town.\n\nE.\n\nSisophon\n\n17.\nSisophon  is  the  provincial  capital  of  Banteay  Meanchey  province.  The  town  is  located\nabout 400 km northwest of Phnom Penh and can be reached via National Road No. 5 or by air\nvia  the  town  of  Battambang  and  then  the  remaining  part  via  National  Road  No.  5.  Sisophon\u2019s\neconomy is mainly dependent on agriculture; census data indicate that 55 percent of the town\u2019s\neconomically active population is employed in agriculture. However, it's location at the junction\nof national roads No. 5 and No. 6, and it's close proximity to the cities of Battambang (80 km)\nand  Siem  Reap  (100  km),  make  it  an  important  center  for  trade  between  Cambodia  and\nThailand. Indeed, much of the commerce in Sisophon is conducted in Thai baht.\n\n18.\nSisophon  has  a  population  of  98,848  (18,374  households),  compared  with  a  total\npopulation in Banteay Meanchey province of 577,772. According to census statistics, only about\n18  percent  of  Sisophon\u2019s  households  have  access  to  electricity.  Lighting  for  the  remainder  of\nhouseholds  is  generated  using  kerosene  or  batteries.  The  commercial  sector  consists  of  nine\nhotels, five restaurants, 156 workshops, five ice factories, seven petrol stations, 10 carpenters,\nand about 50 smaller shops. The public sector consists of 23 schools, 26 administrative offices,\none post office, one health center, 15 temples, and 15 NGOs.\n\n19.\nPower is provided the whole day partly by a public power station and to a greater extent\nby  some  private  power  producers.  All  consumers  have  electric  meters.  Virtually  all  larger\ncommercial  establishments  have  their  own  diesel  generator  sets.  The  health  center  is  the\ndistrict hospital with a staff of 70 and about 50 beds. At present, no electricity is provided to the\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 4, page 4\n\nhospital  due  to  nonpayment  of  bills.  Sometimes,  friends  and  relatives  of  patients  bring  small\nquantities,  e.g.,  10  litres,  of  diesel  fuel  to  enable  the  hospital  to  operate  the  35  kVA  stand-by\ndiesel generator.\n\nF.\n\nStung Treng\n\n20.\nStung Treng town, the capital of Stung Treng province, is located on the Mekong River\nin northeastern Cambodia about 250 km northeast of Phnom Penh. The province\u2019s economy is\nhighly  dependent  on  agriculture  and  (until  a  recent  logging  ban)  logging.  Stung  Treng  town\u2019s\nelectricity is currently supplied by a private producer and tariffs are exceptionally high\u2014KR1,500\nper kW for all consumers compared with KR350 per kWh in Phnom Penh for low-use domestic\ncustomers.  According  to  government  officials  in  Stung  Treng,  nearly  all  of  the  town\u2019s  1,350\nelectricity customers are domestic users.\n\n21.\nThe  total  population  of  the  province  is  in  the  range  of  70,000.  The  commercial  and\nindustrial basis of Stung Treng is agriculture and timber. There are five petrol stations and two\nice  making  factories.  In  the  public  sector  there  are  35  administrative  offices,  a  post  and\ntelecommunication  office,  two  health  centers,  nine  schools,  and  a  large  market.  Most\nbusinesses  and  hotels  have  their  own  generators  because  it  is  currently  more  economical.  If\nelectricity tariffs decreased, these businesses would begin using power from the grid rather than\ntheir own generators.\n\nG.\n\nSvay Rieng\n\nSvay Rieng, the capital of the province Svay Rieng, is located about 125 km southeast\n22.\nof Phnom Penh and 45 km from the Vietnamese border along national road No. 1. Svay Rieng\nhas  a  population  of  21,205  with  4,112  households.  The  province  has  a  total  population  of\napproximately  478,000  and  an  area  of  4,883  square  kilometers;  2,156  consumers  (houses,\noffices, workshops, and restaurants) are connected to the public electricity grid and all of them\nhave electricity meters.\n\n23.\nDue to its proximity to the Vietnamese border and therefore its status as a transit town,\nSvay Rieng has a slightly more developed commercial sector than other towns of similar size.\nThere are, for example, two big hotels; in addition, there are three guest-houses and a number\nof  restaurants.  Svay  Rieng  has  six  petrol  stations.  The  town  hosts  about  40  manufacturing\nestablishments, among which are 11 rice mills and four ice factories. The development of food\nprocessing plants can be seen as an option for the future.\n\n24.\nIn  the  public  sector,  there  are  seven  schools,  one  post  and  telecommunication  office,\none police station, a large hospital with a staff of more than 300, a health center and an army\ncamp.  There  are  more  than  60  government  and  other  administrative  offices,  and  a  number  of\nNGOs.\n\n25.\nAccording  to  census  information,  about  75  percent  of  the  town\u2019s  economically  active\npopulation is employed in manufacturing, construction, retail, and services, while 25 percent of\nthe population is involved in agriculture. Trade activity in Svay Rieng town is likely to increase in\nthe near future following completion of national road No. 1 improvement, which will increase the\nspeed  and  reliability  of  transport.  MIME  data  indicate  that  52  percent  of  Svay  Rieng  town\u2019s\nhouseholds have access to electricity, while the remainder depends on kerosene and batteries\nto power lighting sources and other electrical appliances. Although a significant number of Svay\nRieng town\u2019s population are likely to be of Vietnamese descent, it is not possible to estimate the\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 4, page 5\n\nproportion  of  Vietnamese  in  the  population  using  the  religion  proxy  method  because  the  main\nreligion practiced by both Vietnamese and Khmer people is Buddhism.\n\nH.\n\nTakeo\n\n26.\nTakeo is the capital of Takeo province and is located about 70 km south of Phnom Penh:\nit  can  be  reached  via  National  Road  No.  2.  The  city  has  a  population  of  25,437  in  4,799\nhouseholds. The population of the entire province is about 700,000. Takeo town has an area of\n135 square kilometres. Takeo town\u2019s economy depends on agriculture, but perhaps due to its\nclose  proximity  to  Phnom  Penh,  Takeo  has  five  hotels,  a  number  of  public  guesthouses  and\neight  restaurants.  There  are  four  petrol  stations  in  town.  There  are  17  manufacturing\nestablishments  in  Takeo,  including  ice  factories  and  rice  mills.  Future  development  plans\ninclude a slaughterhouse, a new hotel, and another rice mill. Takeo has nine primary schools, a\nsecondary  school,  and  four  other  schools.  There  are  two  hospitals/health  centers,  a  post  and\ntelecommunication  office,  two  police  stations,  and  an  army  camp.  There  are  more  than  30  of\ngovernment  and  other  administrative  offices.  Recently,  Electricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  took  over  the\nelectricity system, which serves about 300 consumers.\n\n27.\nThe  town  of  Angtassom  is  a  significant  population  center  about  12  km  to  the  east  of\nTakeo. It is located at the junction of national roads No. 2 and No. 3. Angtassom has a total of\n581  households.  As  Angtassom  is  served  by  a  private  generator  that  provides  the  distribution\nsystem  to  local  premises,  the  approach  of  the  MIME  is  to  connect  Angtassom  from  Takeo\nthrough an overhead line. This was the case before the civil war, and around 70 to 80 percent of\nthe old concrete towers between the two towns could still be used for a new transmission line.\nHowever, all the conductors and the insulators are missing.\n\n\fTable A4:  Existing Electricity Systems in the Project Towns\n\nItem\n\nBanlung\n\nKampot\n\nPrey Veng\n\nSisophon\n\nSvay Rieng\n\nPopulation\nHouseholds\nAverage income\nElectrification Ratio\n\nDistribution  System\n\nMIME/EDC\nPrivate\nMV system\nCondition\n\nGenerating System\nInstalled\n\nMIME/EDC\nPrivate\n\nAvailable\n\nMIME\nPrivate\n\nEstimated Peak Demand\nGeneration (1999)\nLosses\n\nTariffs\n\nResidential \nCommercial\nIndustrial\n\nUnit\n\nNo\nNo\n$/p/d\n%\n\nkW\nkW\n\nkW\nkW\nkW\nMWh\n%\n\n$/kwh\n$/kwh\n$/kwh\n\n11,256\n2,095\n0.85\n60\n\n34,200\n6,230\n1.06\n59\n\nKompong\nSpeu\n30,250\n5,500\n0.73\n41\n\nhousehold\nhousehold\n\n1,200\n60\n\n3,700\nNone\n10 kV 6.3 and 15\nVery poor\nGood\n\n400\n1,850\nLV only\nPoor\n\n1,020\n0\n\n102\n0\n<300b\n1,293\n73\n\n0.052\n0.104\n0.160\n\n240\n1,320\n\n0\n1,320\n910\n2,793\n45\n\n0.270\n0.270\n0.270\n\n0\n585\n\n0\n435\n466\n1,632\n35\n\n0.315\n0.315\n0.315\n\n55,050\n10,918\n0.55\n17\n\n1,822\nNone\n15\nPoor\n\n584\n0\n\n460\n0\n340\n757\n44\n\n0.235\n0.235\n0.235\n\n98,800\n18,374\n0.53\n18\n\n1,300\n1,950\nLV only\nN/A\n\n0\n2,275\n\n0\n?\n565\n1,145\n45\n\n0.410\n0.310\n0.360\n\nStung\nTreng\n24,093\n4,426\n0.93\n30\n\n0\n1,350\nLV only\nPoor\n\n0\n700\n\n0\n560\n114\n318\n46\n\n0.390\n0.390\n0.390\n\n21,205\n4,112\n1.01\n52\n\n2,156\nNone\n15\nOK\n\n1,000\n650\n\n0\n500\n500\n1,603\n50\n\nTakeo &\nAngtassom\n27,750\n5,380\n0.67\n42\n\n2,240\n0\n6.3 and 15\nS/S are poor\n\n4\n6\n\n900a\n0\n\n600\n0\n540\n1,155\n42\n\n0.234\n0.234\n0.234\n\nTak:0.226    AT:0.415\nTak:0.226    AT:0.415\nTak:0.226    AT:0.415\n\n      MIME = Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy.\n        a Private producers shut down in early 2000.

The consolidated statements reflect EDC\u2019s main\noperation in Phnom Penh, its branches in Kompong Cham, Siem Reap, Sihanoukville, and the\neight  provincial  towns  under  the  proposed  Project.  The  projected  financial  statements  are  in\ncurrent  terms.  Domestic  inflation  is  assumed  at  7  percent,  and  international  inflation  at\n2.4 percent.  The  exchange  rate  being  used  as  the  base  for  2000  is  KR3,800  to  $1.00,  which\nwas  adjusted  during  the  forecast  period  based  on  the  differential  between  the  assumed\ndomestic and international inflation rates.\n\nB.\n\nIncome Statement (Table A9.1)\n\n1. \n\nElectricity Sales\n\n2.\nElectricity  sales  are  expected  to  increase  from  284  gigawatt-hour  (GWh)  in  1999  to\n840 GWh  by  2007.  Sales  are  forecast  to  grow  at  19  percent  in  2000,  16  percent  in  2001  and\n2002, 13 percent in 2003, 15 percent in 2004, and 12 percent from 2005 onward. Out of the total\nsales,  the  Phnom  Penh  operation  accounts  for  more  than  90  percent.  The  Project  for  the  eight\nprovincial  towns  will  be  largely  completed  by  2003  and  it  is  assumed  that  the  first  full  year  of\noperation will start in 2004. Sales from the 8 provincial towns account for less than 4.0 percent of\nEDC\u2019s total sales.\n\nThe level of system losses used to derive sales for each year was 20 percent in 2000, 19\n3.\npercent  in  2001,  18  percent  in  2002,  and  17  percent  in  2003  thereafter.  For  each  of  the  eight\nprovincial towns, system losses were assumed at 18 percent per annum throughout the projected\nperiod.\n\n2.\n\nSystem Losses\n\n3.\n\nFuel Cost\n\n4.\nDepending on its generators, EDC uses either light diesel oil or heavy fuel oil, the costs of\nwhich  were  assumed  at  $446.7  per  ton  and  $263.5  per  ton  respectively  for  2000.  These  costs\ninclude 10 percent VAT and were estimated based on the assumed international crude oil price of\n$28  per  barrel  (bbl)  in  2000.  In  accordance  with  Government  instructions,  VAT  is  not  added  to\nelectricity bills. The resulting cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) generated for each of EDC generators\nin  2000  is:    C2\u2013$0.091/kWh,  C3\u2013$0.0956/kWh,  C5\u2013$0.0951/kWh,  and  C6\u2013$0.0725/kWh  (Note:\nC2 is a steam plant using heavy fuel oil and C6 has combustion engines that use heavy fuel oil).\nThe fuel costs for subsequent years are projected to move in line with the international crude oil\nprice, which was projected at $28/bbl in 2000, $25/bbl in 2001, $21/bbl in 2002, and at $20/bbl\nfrom 2003 onwards.\n\n4. \n\nPurchased Power\n\nEDC  purchases  power  from  two  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  now  and  will\n5.\npurchase  power  from  the  Kirirom  Hydroplant  and  from  Viet  Nam  from  2004  and  thereafter  as\ndetailed here:\n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nIPP-1,  37.1  megawatt  (MW)  burning  heavy  fuel  oil.  A  joint  venture  of\nLeader Universal Holdings Bhd./Delcom Service/Intercore signed a power\npurchase  agreement  (PPA)  for  18  years  on  September  15,  1994.\nCommercial operations commenced in 1997. The capacity charge is $4.83\nper kW per month based on an 83 percent plant factor. Energy costs are\nfixed  at  $0.0427/kWh  plus  fuel  costs.  For  2000,  EDC  was  being  charged\nabout $0.1233/kWh.\n\nIPP-2,  diesel  plant.  A  short-term  PPA  has  been  negotiated  with  Jupiter\nPower Cambodia Co. Ltd. The cost of power from this plant, which varies\nwith  fuel  cost,  is  currently  estimated  at  $0.1398  based  on  fuel  price  of\n$446.7 per ton.\n\nKirirom  Hydro  Plant:  the  purchase  price  will  be  $0.07/kWh  for  the  first\n12 years.\n\nImported power from Viet Nam, up to 200 MW, will be at an average cost\nof $0.06/kWh plus $0.01/kWh as transmission cost.\n\n5. \n\nOperating and Other Expenses.\n\n6. \nOperation  and  maintenance  has  three  components:    (i)  variable  costs  (lube  oil  and\nspares) at KR48 per kWh of EDC generation, (ii) a fixed cost of 2 percent of revalued gross fixed\nassets in service, and (iii) a provision for unusual expenditure.\n\n7. \nProvision for bad debt was estimated at 2 percent of total electricity sales per year. Salary\nand wages for 2000 are based on their 1999 level, and increased by the assumed inflation rate.\nAll these costs are assumed to increase in line with domestic inflation.\n\nGross  fixed  assets  have  been  depreciated  based  on  an  average  20  year  economic  life\n\n8.\n(i.e., at the rate of 5 percent per annum).\n\n6. \n\nDepreciation\n\n7.\n\nForeign Exchange Losses\n\n9.\nLosses  due  to  devaluation  of  the  Riel  are  expensed  each  year  based  on  the  difference\nbetween the international and domestic inflation rates at 2.4 percent and 7.0 percent respectively.\n\nIncome  tax  on  profit  has  been  assessed  at  4  percent  of  net  profits.  Where  there  are  no\n\n10.\nprofits, a minimum tax of 1 percent of sales is applied.\n\n8.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n9.\n\nDividends\n\nIt has been assumed that EDC will pay as much dividend as possible while maintaining a\n\n11.\nself-financing ratio of at least 30 percent.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nC.\n\nBalance Sheet (Table A9.2)\n\n1.\n\nAssets Revaluation\n\nRevaluation  of  fixed  assets  and  provision  for  depreciation  are  based  on  the\n12.\nmanufacturers\u2019 unit value (MUV) price index for foreign costs and domestic inflation of 7 percent\nper annum. The annual revaluation factor applied being 6.8 percent per annum\n\n2. \n\nAccounts Receivable and Accounts Payable\n\n13.\nAccounts receivable are forecast at three months of sales for 2001 onward. The targets\nindicated for the accounts receivable collection period are set as covenants for the ADB loan.\nAccounts payable are forecast at three months of total fuel and power purchases.\n\n3. \n\nInventories and other current assets\n\nThe forecast is based on 2.5 percent of net fixed assets in operation and cash operating\n\n14.\nexpenses.\n\n4. \n\nDebt Service and Borrowings\n\nThe  Government  has  an  existing  loan  from  the  World  Bank  ($21.5  million),  which  was\n15.\nrelent  to  EDC  at  6.5  percent  per  annum,  repayable  over  12  years  after  the  five-year  grace\nperiod.  Repayment  will  commence  in  2002.  EDC  has  another  existing  loan  from  the  Foreign\nTrade Bank, with a current outstanding balance of $3 million and an interest rate of 15 percent\nper annum. This loan will be fully repaid in 2001. EDC is responsible for the foreign exchange\nrisk  of  all  the  foreign  currency  borrowings.  The  ADB  project  loan  will  be  relent  to  EDC  at  an\ninterest  rate  of  3.5  percent,  and  with  EDC  carrying  the  foreign  exchange  risk.  The  loan  has  a\n20-year  repayment  period  including  a  5-year  grace  period.  It  is  assumed  that  the  proposed\nWorld Bank loan for the rural electrification project will be relent to EDC on the same terms and\nconditions as the existing loan. The World Bank loan will have a 12-year repayment period with\nloan repayment to start in 2007. A working capital loan was assumed to be obtained as needed\nfrom the Foreign Trade Bank at 15 percent annual interest rate.\n\nD. \n\nCash Flow Statement (Table A9.3)\n\n1. \n\nCapital Expenditure\n\nPhnom Penh distribution expansion for 2001-2003 for a total cost of $29 million is being\n16.\nfinanced  by  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  as  a  grant.  The  World  Bank  rural\nelectrification project to be implemented during 2001-2003 was estimated at $32.4 million. The\nproposed Project, which will be implemented during 2001-2004, has a cost for the infrastructure\ncomponent of about $21 million including taxes, duties, contingencies, and consulting services.\nOther capital expenditures after the completion of all of these projects are for the expansion of\nEDC\u2019s transmission and distribution system.\n\n2. \n\nGrant and Equity Contribution\n\n17.\nUnder  the  World  Bank  project,  the  Government  is  expected  to  inject  some  new  equity\ninto  EDC,  to  cover  the  costs  not  financed  under  the  World  Bank  loan.  For  the  Project,  the\nGovernment  will  provide  EDC,  as  a  capital  contribution,  the  costs  not  financed  by  ADB  and\nEDC. (Note: Agence Francaise de Developpement is interested in providing partial financing, on\na grant basis for the proposed ADB project, at an amount to be determined.\n\n\fTable A9.1: EDC Projected Income Statement - Consolidated Accounts\n(KR billions)\n\n \nFiscal Year ending 31 December\n\nGeneration (GWh)\nT&D losses \nSales (GWh)\nSales Growth\nAverage Revenue (KR/kWh)\nIncrease (Decrease) in Average Revenue (%) a \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           \n\n            \n\n         \n\n1999\naudited\n374\n24%\n284\nn/a\n521\nn/a\n\n          \n\n2000\nforecast\n422\n20%\n337\n19%\n577\n11\n\n2001\nforecast\n483\n19%\n391\n16%\n652\n13\n\n2002\nforecast\n555\n18%\n455\n16%\n700\n7\n\n2003\nforecast\n621\n17%\n515\n13%\n752\n8\n\n2004\nforecast\n716\n17%\n594\n15%\n728\n(3)\n\n2005\nforecast\n803\n17%\n667\n12%\n730\n0\n\n2006\nforecast\n902\n17%\n748\n12%\n746\n2\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           \n\n            \n\n            \n\n2007\nforecast\n1,012\n17%\n840\n12%\n778\n4\n\n \n\nOperating Revenues\nElectricity Sales\nAdd: Connection Fees\n        Other Revenues\nNet Revenue\n\nOperating Costs\nFuel Cost\nPower Purchase\nOperation and Maintenance\nSalaries & Wages\nProvision For Maintenance\nProvision For Bad Debts\nDepreciation\nTotal Operating.

The major component of\nthe  Project,  which  involves  expansion  and  rehabilitation  of  old  electricity  facilities  in  eight\nprovincial  towns,  has  some  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  capacity  building  component\nhas  no  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment.  An  environment  specialist  from  ADB  visited\nCambodia from 22 to 28 July 2000 and inspected a selection of the project sites and the central\nworkshop  of  EDC  with  the  officials  concerned.  The  Project  as  a  whole  is  classified  as\nEnvironment Category B.\n\nB. \n\nDescription of the Project\n\n2.\nThe Project consists of two components: (i) power system expansion and rehabilitation\nin  eight  provincial  towns,  and  (ii)  capacity  building.  The  detailed  description  of  the  Project  is\ngiven in Chapter IV of the main text.\n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1. \n\nPhysical and Ecological Resources\n\n3.\nThe Cambodian plain, where six of the eight project sites are located, is entirely flat in\nthe  areas  drained  by  the  Tonle  Sap  and  Mekong  rivers,  changing  only  in  the  north  eastern,\nnorth western, and south western fringes to gently rolling to mountainous country. Sisophon is\nlocated  in  the  hill  country  to  the  west  of  Tonle  Sap  Lake.  The  Tonle  Sap  River  fills  the  lake\nduring  the  rainy  season  and  drains  it  in  dry  season.  The  Cambodian  central  plain  is  mostly\ninundated during the rainy season. The soil in the central plain consists mainly of highly fertile\nsilts,  and  clay  loams  in  some  areas,  which  are  suitable  for  low  land  rice  production.  In  the\nhighlands around Banlung, rice production is supplemented by upland crops such as maize and\na variety of vegetables.\n\n4.\nAs the distribution, transmission, and generation sites are either in urban or semi-urban\nareas or along roads with mainly rice fields on either side, the Project's impacts on ecological\nresources,  such  as  forest  biodiversity,  habitat,  and  vulnerable  species,  are  found  to  be\nnegligible.\n\nAlthough  urban  administrations  in  the  eight  project  areas  are  making  great  efforts  to\n5.\nimprove  sewage  disposal  and  treatment  facilities,  their  efforts  are  hampered  by  budgetary\nconstraints, and sewage disposal remains critical. Drinking water supply is particularly critical in\nmost of the urban centers, as piped water is in short supply and most households rely on dug\nwells and surface water as their main source of drinking water.\n\n2.\n\nHuman and Economic Development\n\nThe population in the project areas is estimated at about 300,000 or 2.5 percent of the\n6.\ntotal population of Cambodia. In the provincial centers, a household comprises on average 5.3\npersons.  The  population  pyramid  in  the  eight  urban  centers,  as  a  reflection  of  the  war,  shows\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nthat the number of those aged 20-30 years has been greatly diminished. Also as a result of the\nwar,  the  proportion  of  displaced  persons  continues  to  be  high  causing  a  number  of  problems\nboth for provincial budgets and the labor market.\n\nThe economic infrastructure in all eight urban centers has been greatly affected by the\n7.\nwar, and economic recovery is hampered by a lack of investment. After a period of slow growth\nin the two previous years, the Cambodian economy grew by about 4 percent in 1999. According\nto  the  population  census,  agriculture  is  the  most  important  sector  of  employment  in  all  of  the\neight  urban  centers.  Most  households  in  the  eight  towns  use  kerosene  for  lighting,  with  the\nexception of Banlung, Kampot, and Svay Rieng, where electricity is the main source of lighting,\nwhile  batteries  and  other  sources  account  for  3-5  percent  of  household  energy  supply.\nA majority of households in the project areas use firewood as their main fuel for cooking and a\nsmall percentage use charcoal.\n\n8.\nIn  the  project  area,  health  and  sanitation  conditions  are  generally  poor  and,  therefore,\nvery  sensitive  to  adverse  environmental  impacts.  In  all  of  the  eight  urban  centers,  need  to\nrehabilitate  not  only  the  electric  power  system  but  also  all  other  public  services  is  urgent,  as\nprogress in rehabilitating the sewage, water supply, education, transport, and health systems is\nvery slow. Reliable and affordable electricity supplies are essential for attracting business to the\nprovincial  centers,  which  in  turn  would  improve  the  employment  situation  and  strengthen  the\nimpetus for economic recovery.\n\nD. \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1. \n\nPreconstruction Stage\n\n9.\nEnvironmental  impacts  related  to  project  layout,  land  use,  construction,  operation  and\nmaintenance  are  considered  as  insignificant.  The  standard  layout  for  a  power  plant  with  a\nmaximum  capacity  of  500  kilowatt  (kW)  involves  a  power  house  with  a  control  room  and\nworkshop, a fuel storage and water storage facility, a 22 kilovolt (kV) substation, a warehouse,\nan  office,  and  an  extension  area,  altogether  requiring  a  total  area  of  0.8-1.2  hectares  (ha).\nProject  design  will  include  the  replacement  of  existing  transformers.  A  major  environmental\nimpact  can  be  expected  if  the  transformers  contain  polychlorinated  bi-phenyl  (PCB),  which  is\nhazardous  to  human  health.  As the  existing  transformers  were  originally  supplied  from  the\nformer Soviet Union, they likely contain PCBs, and special handling procedures are, therefore,\nrequired. Part A of the Project should be carefully designed and thoroughly examined to ensure\nadverse environmental impacts are minimized.\n\n10. \nThe  sites  for  the  new  power  stations  and  substations  have  mostly  been  selected.\nIn some cases such as Kompong Speu and Takeo, the existing power stations will be sites for\nnew  facilities,  which  do  not  require  any  acquisition  of  land.  In  other  cases,  land  has  to  be\nacquired. The land requirement for the diesel power plants varies from 12,000 square meters for\nSisophon to about 8,000 square meters for the smaller plants.\n\nAppropriate measures should be taken to mitigate adverse impacts on land use, water\n11.\nresources, and the ecology. To mitigate the impact on land use, compensation payments will be\nneeded.  The  draft  electricity  law,  which  is  before  the  Council  of  Ministers  and  remains  to  be\nratified by Parliament, stipulates in Article 51 that a licensee may install, over any land, electrical\nfacilities and equipment necessary to satisfy electrical power supply. The draft law also requires\nthat the licensee take reasonable commercial effort to acquire rights of entry, rights of way, and\neasements  through  negotiations  with  the  landowners  by  paying  appropriate  compensation.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nShould  the  licensee  fail  to  obtain  such  rights  the  Electricity  Authority  of  Cambodia  (EAC)  may\ncertify the acquisition to be in the public interest to enable the relevant Government authority to\nproceed with the compulsory acquisition of the easement or land for the licensee.\n\n2.\n\nConstruction Stage\n\n12.\nThe  main  problem  related  to  the  construction  of  access  roads,  power  stations,  poles,\nand  substations  is  the  clearing  of  vegetation.  There  may  also  be  temporary  interference  with\nexisting  electricity  supply  or  traffic  flow  during  construction.  Other  impacts  such  as  dust  and\nnoise during construction will be minimal.\n\n13.\nTransport  and  storage  of  fuel  involves  several  potentially  adverse  environmental\nimpacts,  as  oil  can  leak  or  spill  into  the  subsoil  due  to  accident  or  mere  neglect.  Without\nappropriate  safeguards  during  construction  as  well  as  operation,  oil  spills  or  leakages  may\npollute surface and groundwater resources.\n\nEnvironmental  protection  standards  require  that  used  oils  with  PCB  content  exceeding\n14.\n20 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) and halogen content exceeding 2 grams/kilogram (g/kg) cannot\nbe processed but must be thermally destroyed in a suitably equipped incinerator. Normally only\nhazardous  waste  incinerators  would  be  considered  as  suitable  for  destruction  of  PCB-\ncontaminated  transformer  oil,  and  since  there  are  no  such  incinerators  in  Cambodia,  PCB-\ncontaminated  transformer  oil  may  have  to  be  transported  to  a  neighboring  country  with\nappropriate  facilities.  Another  option,  which  would  not  necessitate  the  transportation  of  PCB\ncontaminated oil to a neighboring country, would require directing contaminated transformer oil\nto  energy  utilization  as  a  secondary  fuel  in  Cambodian  cement  works.  However,  this  option\nwould only be feasible if the cement work could guarantee the destruction of the PCB pollutants\nby combustion at temperatures over 1,300 degrees Celsius. Due to its potential hazard for the\nenvironment, other processing methods of PCB-contaminated transformer oil are discouraged,\neven though they may be cheaper than the options discussed.\n\n3.\n\nOperation Stage\n\nThe main problems due to project operation are noise from diesel generators, emission\n15.\nof  air  pollutants,  and  hazards  associated  with  fuel  handling  and  power  distribution.  The  noise\nimpact from operating diesel generators will be reduced to acceptable levels by an appropriate\ndesign of the powerhouse and by introducing exhaust gas silencers. Therefore, even if a school\nis  in  close  proximity  of  the  power  station,  as  in  the  case  of  Sisophon,  the  noise  level  of  the\ndiesel  generator  is  not  expected  to  exceed  40  decibels  (dB)  at  200  m  distance,  assuming  a\nstandard  noise  emission  of  100  dB.  Since  the  noise  emissions  in  existing  power  stations  are\nconsiderable,  introducing  new  generation  units  that  comply  with  international  noise  standards\nwill be a major improvement. The noise impact from operating diesel generators will be reduced\nto acceptable levels by appropriate specifications for noise level and power house design.\n\n16.\nAir  pollution  due  to  generator  operation  mainly  involves  the  emission  of  carbon\nmonoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulates. Emission intensity varies according to the make,\nage  and  maintenance  level  of  the  generator.  Nitrogen  dioxide  and  dust  pollutants  represent  a\nhealth hazard, as they can cause irritations of the respiratory tract that can be dangerous if the\nexposure is prolonged.\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\nConcerning air pollution, the new power stations should correspond to the state of the art\n17.\nand meet international emission standards. It is recommended that emission standards required\nfor standard compression ignition engines of a maximum concentration of 0.65 g/m3 for carbon\nmonoxide, 2-4 g/m3 for nitrogen dioxide and 0.13 g/m3 for particulates be kept. Operators at the\npower plants need to be trained to ensure that emissions are regularly measured and emission\nstandards are complied with. In this way it can be ensured that air pollution caused by operation\nof  the  new  generators  remains  below  critical  levels.  If  operators  are  properly  trained,  air\npollution  caused  by  the  new  generators  can  be  expected  to  remain  substantially  below  the\npresently applicable level.\n\n18.\nProtecting  water  sources  from  uncontrolled  oil  spills  and  leakages  are  of  crucial\nimportance,  and  taking  appropriate  measures  can  be  expected  to  greatly  improve  the  existing\nsituation.  Measures  designed  to  minimize  adverse  effects  from  oil  spills  and  leakages  should\ninvolve  (i)  designing  storage  facilities  according  to  international  standards,  (ii)  setting  proper\nmaintenance standards, and (iii) introducing a system for recycling or disposing of used oil.\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n19.\nThe draft electricity law does not propose new environmental protection measures and\nrefrains from listing environmental provisions for either generation, transmission, distribution or\nretailing licenses. Instead, the draft law states, in Article 35 (a), that the licensee must comply\nwith the laws of the Kingdom of Cambodia, including laws regarding environmental protection,\nand in Article 8 (m) that the electricity authority of Cambodia is to give careful consideration to\nenvironmental policies of the Government.\n\n20.\nThe  implementation  of  mitigating  measures  should  be  formalized  in  an  environmental\nmanagement plan or its equivalent. The plan should define the mechanism and responsibilities\nfor  implementing  the  proposed  mitigating  measures  and  for  monitoring  their  effectiveness.\nTo ensure that environmental considerations are included in project design, provisions need to\nbe made to clearly define environmental performance targets or milestones for each one of the\nproposed mitigating measures.\n\nThe  monitoring  mechanism  should  also \n\ninvolve  periodic  ADB  project  review\n21.\nmissions, quarterly  reports  of  the  environmental  management  unit  or  group,  as  well  as  both\nquarterly  and  annual  reports.  Concerning  critical  mitigating  measures,  such  as  the  disposal  of\nPCB-contaminated  transformer  oil,  should  its  existence  eventually  be  proven,  periodic  audits\nshould  be  carried  out  by  independent  consultants,  to  monitor  progress  and  measure  the\neffectiveness of the recommended measures.\n\nF. \n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n22.\nPart A of the Project is expected to cause a number of adverse environmental impacts,\nwhich  include  environmental  hazards  related  to  land  use,  noise,  air  pollution,  water  pollution,\nand ecological hazards. However, these impacts are considered insignificant if they are properly\nmitigated in accordance with the environment management plan.\n\n23. \nThe recommended mitigation measures should become the basis for an environmental\nmanagement  plan  to  be  implemented  by  EDC  in  consultation  with  MIME  and  the  Ministry  of\nif  properly\nEnvironment  (MOE),  as  necessary.  The  environmental  management  plan, \nimplemented, is expected not only to reduce the environmental impacts to an acceptable level\nbut also to bring about a major improvement in the overall environmental situation as compared\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\nwith the prevailing situation, as the existing power supply facilities and practices will be phased\nout  and  replaced  by  new  ones.  The  recommended  mitigating  measures  are  not  expected  to\nsignificantly affect the Project\u2019s financial and economic viability.\n\nThe  existence  of  PCB-contaminated  transformer  oil,  if  it  should  be  proven,  would\n24. \nconstitute  a  critical  problem  for  the  environment  and  needs  to  be  mitigated.  The  Central\nWorkshop of EDC does not have any information on the existence of PCBs nor testing facilities\nfor  detecting  them.  A  short  study  should  be  conducted  to  identify  appropriate  disposal\nprocesses,  and  to  provide  conclusive  answers  as  to  availability  of  appropriate  incineration\nfacilities  in  Cambodia  and  cost  effectiveness  of  incineration  in  Cambodia  compared  with  the\nalternative  of  disposing  of  PCB  contaminants  in  neighboring  countries  where  they  can  be\neffectively destroyed.\n\n25. \nProvided  EDC\u2019s  management  information  systems  are  significantly  upgraded,  EDC  is\nexpected to be able to implement and monitor the recommended measures. The IEE confirms\nthe findings of the 1998 environmental examination that the Project is environmentally sensitive\nbut  that  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  minimal.  The  proposed  mitigating  measures  and\nmonitoring program should be adequate to mitigate those adverse impacts.\n\nG. \n\nConclusions\n\n26. \nThe  IEE  confirms  that  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  considered  insignificant  and\ncan  be  mitigated  under  the  environmental  management  plan,  and  that  the  Project  is\nenvironmentally  acceptable.  The  mitigation  measures  need  to  be  closely  monitored  and\nevaluated  by  EDC.  An  additional  study  concerning  the  disposal  of  PCB  contaminants  is\nrequired,  should \nthe  recommended\nenvironmental  management  plan  and  appropriate  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanisms  is\nsufficient for the evaluation of the environmental aspects of the Project, and any additional study\non environmental impact assessment is not needed.\n\nits  existence  be  proven.

The load growth in\n1.\nthe  different  provincial  towns  is  one  of  the  major  decisive  factors  for  the  generation,\ntransmission,  and  distribution  expansion  planning,  and  therefore  has  a  decisive  impact  on  the\ninvestment  costs  required  to  rehabilitate  the  power  systems  in  the  project  areas.  It  also  has  a\nmajor impact on the economic and financial feasibility of these investments.\n\n2.\nThe preparation of a reliable load forecast for each of the eight provincial towns in this\nProject  was  difficult  in  several  cases,  due  to  the  impact  of  supply-side  constraints  on  historic\nrecords  of  power  generation  and  sales,  and  the  unreliable  nature  and  limited  period  of  these\nrecords. However, historic data on sales and generation was available for several towns, such\nas  Kampot  and  Takeo,  where  supply-side  constraints  and  self-generation  are  not  significant.\nThe  sales  records  in  these  towns  were  used  as  a  basis  for  estimating  average  consumption\nrates in other towns that have had supply-side constraints.\n\n3.\nThe  revised  final  forecast  is  based  on  a  model  that  forecasts  sales  in  three  consumer\ncategories: residential, commercial and industrial, and public offices and schools. Table A11.1\nshows  the  detailed  load  forecast  for  the  town  of  Kampot  as  an  example.  The  residential\nconsumer  group  is  the  largest,  and  accounts  for  about  70  to  80  percent  of  total  sales  in  most\ntowns.  The  Project  will  replace  the  complete  distribution  systems  in  the  towns,  and  extend\nservice  to  outlying  communities  around  each  town  (these  extensions  could  be  up  to  two\nkilometers).  The  total  number  of  residential  consumers  is  estimated  to  increase  by  15  to\n20 percent as a result of the rehabilitation and extension of the distribution systems. In addition,\nthe number of customers will increase due to urban population growth of about 2.8 to 3 percent\nannually; and sales per customer will increase about 6 percent annually due to income growth.\nCommercial  and  industrial  sales  are  typically  about  15  to  20  percent  of  total  sales  in  the\nprovincial towns. Sales to commercial and industrial consumers are forecast to increase about\n9 to  10  percent  annually,  based  on  a  forecast  growth  rate  in  economic  activities  of  about\n7 percent  annually,  and  an  energy  (electricity  demand)  elasticity  factor  of  1.3  to  1.4  against\neconomic  growth.  Sales  for  public  sector  offices,  buildings,  and  street  lighting  constitute  the\nbalance of about 10 percent of sales. Total sales will increase sharply by about 25 percent when\nthe  Project  is  commissioned  in  2003-2004,  due  to  the  increase  in  number  of  residential\nconsumers  and  improved  street  lighting,  and  thereafter  are  forecast  to  increase  at  about\n10.5 percent annually.\n\n4.\nHowever, the increase in total generation required when the Project is commissioned will\nbe much less due to the sharp reduction in losses from 45 percent at present, to a rate of about\n18  percent  after  rehabilitation.  This  will  actually  result  in  a  net  annual  reduction  in  total\ngeneration  required  when  the  Project  is  commissioned.  The  high  current  levels  of  losses  are\nbased  on  statistics  on  actual  total  generation  and  sales  in  1999.  The  forecast  losses  after\nrehabilitation  are  based  on  actual  experience  in  the  towns  of  Siem  Riep  and  Sihanoukville,\nwhich were rehabilitated in 1998 under the first Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed power\nproject,1  and  where  average  losses  in  1999  after  rehabilitation  were  reduced  to  about\n18 percent. The forecast growth rate of peak loads after 2004 is slightly lower than the forecast\ngrowth rate in energy sales, due to a gradual increase in system load factors from 35 percent at\npresent, to about 40 percent by 2013.\n\n1  Loan 1345-CAM(SF):  Power Rehabilitation Project, for $28.2 million, approved on 15 December 1994.\n\n                  \n\n\fYear\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\nTable A11.1:  Load Forecast for Kampot\n\nResidential Sector\nPopulation growth (%)\nPopulation\nPersons per household / house\nNo. of households / houses\nConnection rate (%)\nNo. of households / houses electrified\nAverage consumption per household (kWh/a)\nTotal residential consumption (kWh)\n\nCommercial and Industrial Sector\nGrowth rate of economic activities (%)\nEnergy elasticity\nTotal commercial consumption (kWh)\n\nPublic Sector\nPublic facilities (kWh)\nStreet lighting (kWh)\nTotal public consumption (kWh)\n\n3.1\n34,140\n5.5\n6,230\n59\n3,700\n260\n\n2.7\n46,444\n5.3\n8,830\n80\n7,020\n494\n962,000 1,054,415 1,155,302 1,265,399 1,385,501 1,819,765 2,029,452 2,261,698 2,518,770 2,803,147 3,117,540 3,464,906\n\n2.7\n45,245\n5.3\n8,569\n78\n6,695\n466\n\n2.7\n44,061\n5.3\n8,313\n77\n6,381\n439\n\n2.8\n42,892\n5.3\n8,062\n75\n6,078\n414\n\n2.8\n41,739\n5.3\n7,816\n74\n5,785\n391\n\n2.8\n40,602\n5.4\n7,575\n73\n5,503\n369\n\n2.9\n39,482\n5.4\n7,339\n71\n5,230\n348\n\n2.9\n38,379\n5.4\n7,107\n59\n4,221\n328\n\n3.0\n37,293\n5.4\n6,881\n59\n4,086\n310\n\n3.0\n36,224\n5.4\n6,659\n59\n3,955\n292\n\n3.0\n35,173\n5.5\n6,442\n59\n3,826\n276\n\nGrowth rate of residential consumption\n\n9.6\n\n9.6\n\n9.5\n\n9.5\n\n31.3\n\n11.5\n\n11.4\n\n11.4\n\n11.3\n\n11.2\n\n11.1\n\nGrowth rate of commercial consumption\n\n9.8\n\n9.8\n\n9.8\n\n9.8\n\n9.5\n\n9.5\n\n9.5\n\n9.5\n\n9.1\n\n9.1\n\n9.1\n\n6.0\n1.4\n361,680\n\n7.0\n1.4\n397,125\n\n7.0\n1.4\n436,043\n\n7.0\n1.4\n478,775\n\n7.0\n1.4\n525,695\n\n7.0\n1.35\n575,373\n\n7.0\n1.35\n629,746\n\n7.0\n1.35\n689,257\n\n7.0\n1.35\n754,392\n\n7.0\n1.3\n823,041\n\n7.0\n1.3\n897,938\n\n7.0\n1.3\n979,651\n\n198,528\n0\n198,528\n\n212,425\n0\n212,425\n\n227,295\n0\n227,295\n\n243,205\n0\n243,205\n\n260,230\n0\n260,230\n\n278,446\n30,000\n308,446\n\n297,937\n31,500\n329,437\n\n318,793\n33,075\n351,868\n\n341,108\n34,729\n375,837\n\n364,986\n36,465\n401,451\n\n390,535\n38,288\n428,823\n\n417,872\n40,203\n458,075\n\nGrowth rate of public consumption (%)\n\n7.0\n\n7.0\n\n7.0\n\n7.0\n\n18.5\n\n6.8\n\n6.8\n\n6.8\n\n6.8\n\n6.8\n\n6.8\n\nTotal Electricity Consumption (kWh)\nGrowth rate of electricity consumption (%)\n\n1,522,208 1,663,964 1,818,640 1,987,379 2,171,426 2,703,584 2,988,635 3,302,822 3,648,999 4,027,640 4,444,301 4,902,631\n10.3\n\n10.5\n\n10.3\n\n10.4\n\n10.5\n\n24.5\n\n10.5\n\n9.3\n\n9.3\n\n9.3\n\n9.3\n\nTechnical and non-technical distribution losses (%\n\n45.5\n\n45.5\n\n45.5\n\n45.5\n\n45.5\n\n18.0\n\n18.0\n\n18.0\n\n18.0\n\n18.0\n\n18.0\n\n18.0\n\nElectricity sent out from power station (kWh)\n\n2,793,042 3,053,146 3,336,954 3,646,567 3,984,268 3,297,054 3,644,677 4,027,832 4,449,998 4,911,756 5,419,879 5,978,819\n\nLoad factor\n\n0.35\n\n0.35\n\n0.35\n\n0.35\n\n0.35\n\n0.35\n\n0.355\n\n0.36\n\n0.365\n\n0.37\n\n0.375\n\n0.38\n\n911\n\n996\n9.3\n\n1,088\n9.3\n\n1,189\n9.3\n\n1,300\n9.3\n\n1,075\n(17.2)\n\n1,172\n9.0\n\n1,277\n9.0\n\n1,392\n9.0\n\n1,515\n8.9\n\n1,650\n8.9\n\n1,796\n8.9\n\nPEAK LOAD (net) (kW)\nGrowth rate of peak load (%)\n\nkW = kilowatt\nkWH = kilowatt-hours\n\n7\n0\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n1\n1\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n2\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nThe  load  forecasts  for  other  towns  are  similar  to  that  described  for  Kampot.

For all\neight towns, the total energy sales in 2004 are forecast to be 133 percent higher than in 1999.\nThis  increase  is  due  to  a  combination  of  normal  load  growth  over  this  five-year  period,  the\nimproved  supply  and  an  end  to  supply-side  constraints  when  the  Project  is  commissioned,  an\nincrease  in  the  total  number  of  residential  consumers  serviced,  some  extensions  of  service\nareas,  and  the  conversion  of  some  nontechnical  electricity  losses  to  sales.

At present all of these towns are isolated\nfrom any interconnected grid.\n\n3.\nDistribution  systems  are  generally  in  very  poor  condition,  having  been  almost  entirely\ndestroyed during the war and replaced on an ad hoc basis since. Voltage levels of the medium\nvoltage (MV) distribution lines are often too low, such as 6 kilovolt kV) for modern utility designs,\nand  these  will  all  be  upgraded  and  standardized  at  22  kV  for  the  new  systems.  Distribution\nlosses  are  very  high;  the  total  losses  are  typically  about  35  to  50  percent,  with  an  average  of\n46 percent,  of  which  most  (probably  two  thirds)  are  technical  losses  and  the  balance  are\nnontechnical. The only practical way to reduce losses and to supply future growth is to replace\nthese old distribution systems completely, which will be done under the Project.\n\nFor  Banlung,  however,  the  existing  distribution  system  was  constructed  in  1993  and  is\n4.\nstill in relatively good condition, and only expansion of this system is required. The high losses\nin  Banlung  are  due  mostly  to  nontechnical  losses,  and  a  change  in  local  management  is\nrequired to solve this problem.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\nFor isolated power systems of this size, the least costly form of independent bulk power\n5.\nsupply is diesel power generation. Other forms of power generation, such as combined cycle or\nsteam  thermal  generation,  are  not  economic  or  practical  for  the  small  generating  units  sizes\nrequired  by  these  towns.  Renewable  energy  generation  from  photovoltaic  solar  is  much  more\ncostly  than  diesel  generation,  except  on  a  very  small  scale  of  only  a  few  households  to  be\nserved.  Two  diesel  unit  sizes  of  250  kilowatt  (kW)  and  500  kW  have  been  chosen  as  a  cost\neffective  and  standard  size  unit  to  be  used  for  the  towns  in  this  Project  that  require  their  own\ngeneration.\n\n6.\nSmall hydro sites of proven feasibility are not close enough to these towns to be feasible\nalternatives, except for Kampong Speu, which will be supplied by a transmission interconnection\nto the Kirirom hydro project nearby, which will be rehabilitated primarily to supply Phnom Penh.\n\n7.\nTransmission interconnections with the Phnom Penh power system, or with larger power\ngrid  systems  in  Viet  Nam  and  Thailand,  were  also  considered  wherever  feasible.  For  Takeo,\nsuch a transmission interconnection would be too costly. For Svay Rieng, a 22 kV transmission\ninterconnection  to  Viet  Nam  is  the  least  cost  source  of  bulk  power  supply.  For  Sisophon,  the\nrecommended least cost plan is to supply load growth with diesel generation initially for a few\nyears,  and  then  to  connect  this  town  to  a  planned  115  kV  transmission  interconnection  with\nThailand.\n\nC.\n\nEconomic Benefits of Electricity Consumption\n\n8.\nFor the economic analysis, the economic benefits of the Project are divided into two parts.\nThe first is the cost saving due to replacing the old and inefficient current power supply systems in\nthese towns. The second is the benefit of additional electricity sales arising from the Project.\n\n9.\nThe  cost  saving  due  to  replacing  the  current  power  systems  is  based  on  the  tariffs\ncurrently  charged  in  each  town.  These  tariffs  are  established  separately  for  each  town  and  are\nquite  high,  ranging  from  $0.23  to  $0.39  per  kWh,  with  the  exception  of  Banlung.  The  weighted\naverage tariff is $0.26 per kWh. Part of the reason for the high tariffs is the high distribution losses.\nFinancial accounts for these provincial power operations indicate that the tariffs are just adequate\nto  cover  their  operating  costs;  depreciation  is  either  neglected  or  very  minimal;  and  interest\ncharges are always ignored. Consequently, the savings in operating costs by closing down the old\npower supply systems are equal to their total annual expenses, which approximately equal their\nannual revenues.\n\nThe  Project  will  (i)  improve  the  quality  of  electricity  supply  for  about  21,000  households\n10.\nwhich  will  already  be  connected  in  the  eight  towns  in  2003  before  project  commissioning,  and\n(ii) provide  new  service  connections  to  about  13,000  more  households  from  2004  to  2010.\nResidential  consumers,  who  account  for  most  electric  energy  sales,  use  electricity  primarily  for\nlighting,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  for  television,  radios,  fans,  and  other  electrical  appliances.\nHowever,  electricity  is  not  used  for  cooking  in  Cambodia,  since  it  is  much  more  costly  than\nfirewood or kerosene. The additional or induced electricity consumption for residential consumers\nis valued on the basis of the average willingness to pay for electricity based on a demand versus\nprice  curve  that  was  derived  from  data  for  various  towns  in  Cambodia.  A  large  data  set  was\ncollected  for  towns  in  the  Project  and  elsewhere  in  Cambodia  with  tariffs  that  vary  over  a  wide\nrange, and average household consumption rates in these towns. This formed an excellent basis\nfor  plotting  a  demand  curve  for  residential  electricity  consumption  in  provincial  towns,  which  is\nshown in Figure A11.1.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix \n\n11 , page  5\n\nFigure  A11.1  -Domestic  Electricity  Demands  in  Cambodian  Towns\n\n6000\n\n5000\n\n4000\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n~ \n-\n\n~\n'-=\nCG\n...\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15 \n\n20 \n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nTotal \n\nConsumption \n\n(kilowatt-hour/month)\n\nThe  average  willingness \n\nto  pay  under  this  demand  curve,  with  an  average  household\n15. \nconsumption \nrate  of  35  kWh  per  month,  is  about  KR1,640  per  kWh,  or  $0.43  per  kWh.  This  is\nreduced  by  10 percent  to  reflect  the  fact  that  the  survey  sample  includes  only  limited  connection\nrates  (typically  50- 75  percent)  at  the  very  high  tariff  end  of  the  sample  for  small  private  power\ndistributors,  which  indicates  that  many  households  are  not  willing  to  pay  very  high  tariffs.  The\nvalues  are  also  adjusted  bya  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9  to  convert  local  financial  prices  to\neconomic  border  prices.

The  benchmark  cost  of  crude  oil  is  assumed  to  be  $20  per\nbarrel,  free-on-board  Singapore,  at  year  2000  price  levels.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return\n(EIRR) for rehabilitation of power supply to Kampot is estimated to be 19.8 percent.\n\n1.\nThe economic evaluation of each of the eight towns included in the Project is summarized\nin Table A11.4. The overall Project has an estimated EIRR of 17.8 percent for the base case.\nHowever, this economic evaluation of benefits is probably conservative for several reasons. In the\nevaluation of the cost saving of replacing the existing distribution systems and power plants, only\nthe  savings  in  direct  out-of-pocket  operating  expenses  to  the  local  power  companies  has  been\nconsidered.  The improvement in quality and reliability of power supply is not considered, except\nfor  the  simple  increase  in  kWh  sold.  There  are  other  benefits  to  improved  reliability  however,\nincluding improved voltage levels, avoiding the social costs and inconveniences of power outages,\nand in the longer term, avoiding the need for many consumers to maintain rather costly standby\ncaptive power gensets for emergency use in case of an interruption of public supply. These costs\nand  benefits  are  difficult  to  evaluate  and  have  consequently  been  ignored,  but  they  are\nnevertheless real and probably substantial.\n\nTable A11.4  Summary of Project Economics\n\nTown\n\nProject\nInvestment\n($ million)\n\nCurrent\nTariffs\n($/kWh)\n\nBanlung\nKampot\nKompong Speu (tran.)\nPrey Veng\nSisophon\nStung Treng\nSvay Rieng (tran.)\nTakeo & Angtassom\nTotals\n Project Average\n\n0.230\n3.000\n2.340\n1.930\n4.850\n2.060\n3.440\n3.870\n21.720\n\n0.072\n0.270\n0.315\n0.235\n0.360\n0.390\n0.234\n0.278\n\nPlanned\nFuture\nTariffs\n($/kWh)\n\n0.090\n0.216\n0.158\n0.247\n0.242\n0.295\n0.173\n0.226\n\nNet Present\nEconomic\nValue\n($ million)\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n\nFIRR\n(%)\n\n\u2014\n19.8\n20.3\n14.6\n17.1\n12.2\n22.0\n14.6\n\n4.1\n4.1\n4.6\n4.6\n3.2\n4.3\n5.4\n3.9\n\n4.2\n\n1.0\n1.1\n0.2\n0.9\n0.0\n1.3\n0.3\n4.7\n\n0.260\n\n0.197\n\n17.8\n\n\u2014  = not available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return;\nkWh = kilowatt-hour.\n\nNotes:\n(tran.) means future supplies will be via a transmission connection.\nProject  investment  is  total  capital  cost  required  up  to  and  including  2006,  including  physical  and  price\ncontingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  consulting  services  for  the  engineering  implementation,  and  interest\nduring construction.\nCurrent tariffs are those in place for 2000.\n\nPlanned future tariffs are required tariffs in 2007, adjusted to year 2000 prices.\n\nThe FIRR is based on planned tariffs.\n\n2.\nPart A of the Project (infrastructure) is estimated to cost $21.7 million total for distribution\nand  diesel  generation  investments  up  to  2006,  including  consumer  connection  costs,  price\ncontingencies, duties and taxes. With an estimated 32,000 households connected in 2006, this\ncorresponds  to  an  average  cost  of  $680  per  consumer  in  2006.  In  later  years,  the  average\n\n\f76\n\nAppendix 11, page 8\n\ninvestment in distribution per customer will decline, since the distribution system is designed for\nhigher future loads, but further investments in generation will still be required as loads grow.\n\n3.\nSensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  scenarios  shown  in  Table  A11.5.  This\nindicates that the economic performance of the Project is robust for moderate increases in fuel\ncosts or in capital costs. Future crude oil prices are rather uncertain,1 nevertheless, the Project\ncan  tolerate  a  large  increase  of  oil  prices  up  to  $44  per  barrel,  at  which  point  it  switches  to  a\nmarginal (i.e., 12 percent) rate of return. The project economics are most sensitive to reductions\nin  estimated  unit  benefits  or  in  total  energy  sales.  The  Project  will  switch  to  becoming\nuneconomic if average benefit rates for new sales were reduced more than 30 percent, based\non a minimum 12 percent EIRR.\n\nTable A11.5:  Sensitivity Analysis\n\nSensitivity Scenario\n\nBase Case\nCrude Oil Costs Increased by 20%\nAll Capital Costs Increased by 10%\nAverage Benefits Reduced by 10%\nEnergy Sales Reduced by 10%\n\nEIRR\n(%)\n\n17.79\n16.87\n16.14\n15.92\n15.58\n\nSIa\n\n\u2014\n.05\n.16\n.19\n.22\n\nFIRR\n (%)\n\n4.18\n2.86\n3.20\n1.61\n2.80\n\nSI\n\n\u2014\n.07\n.10\n.26\n.14\n\n\u2014 = not available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return,\nSI = sensitivity indicator.\n\n a   SI is the ratio of percentage change in the EIRR to the percentage change in the given parameter\n\nE. \n\nFinancial Evaluation of the Project\n\n4.\nThe financial evaluation differs from the economic in that financial prices are used for all\nproject costs, which include duties and taxes on capital costs and fuel costs. Project benefits are\nbased  on  the  financial  revenues  from  electricity  sales  from  the  Project,  starting  in  2004.  It  is\nassumed that electricity tariffs will be adjusted,2 as shown in Table A11.4. The resulting financial\ninternal rate of return (FIRR) for each town is shown in the same table. The average FIRR for\nthe overall Project is estimated to be 4.2 percent. This FIRR is just enough to meet the weighted\naverage cost of capital to EDC for the Project financing, which is estimated to be 4.1 percent.3\nThe planned real tariffs at year 2000 prices after Project commissioning will be lower than the\ncurrent tariffs in most towns, as shown in Table A11.4. The average real tariff by 2007 will be\nabout 24 percent lower than now as shown in Appendix 9, Figure A9.\n\n5.\nThe  sensitivity  analysis  for  the  FIRR  is  somewhat  academic,  since  in  the  event  of  an\nunexpected  increase  in  project  capital  costs  or  fuel  costs,  or  change  in  forecast  sales,  the\naverage tariff could be adjusted to achieve the agreed financial performance targets. In case of\ncrude  oil  prices  higher  than  $20  per  barrel,  EDC\u2019s  tariffs  would  have  to  increase  about  one\nquarter of one cent for each $1 per barrel increase in oil costs.\n\n                  \n\n1  Crude oil prices have fluctuated widely in the last two years. Current prices (Sept 2000) are about $32 per barrel,\nbut the World Bank\u2019s most recent commodity price forecast (May 2000) forecasts future crude oil prices of only $18\nper barrel at current prices in 2005, which is equivalent to about $16 per barrel at year 2000 price levels. Thus, $20\nper barrel assumed for this study is still considered a conservative estimate.\n\n2 The  practice  of  EDC  and  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy  is  to  establish  separate  tariffs  in  each  town,\ndepending on actual costs of service there. Consequently, tariffs in the project towns will be different from EDC's\naverage tariff in Phnom Penh.\n\n3  This cost is based on financing 75 percent of the total project costs for power infrastructure through the ADB loan\nat a relending interest rate of 3.5 percent, and 25 percent through equity investment with a required rate of return of\n6 percent.\n\n\f77\n\nAppendix 12\n\nEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY STATISTICS OF THE PROJECT TOWNS\n\nTable A12.1:  Average Monthly Household Income By Sector\n\n     Of Employment In Project Areas\n\n           (KR\u2019000)\n\nSector\n\nBanlung Kampot\n\nKompong\nSpeu\n\nPrey\nVeng\n\nSisophon\n\nStung\nTreng\n\nSvay\nRieng\n\nTakeo\n\nAgriculture\nFishing\nMining\nManufacture\nConstruction\nTrade/Repair\nCatering/Business\nTransport\nAdministration\nCommunity\nPrivate/NGO\nUnemployed\n  Weighted Ave.a\n\n523\n0\n0\n0\n350\n528\n560\n351\n578\n620\n0\n610\n\n544\n\na Based on number of households in each sector.\n\n371\n338\n970\n420\n430\n486\n315\n325\n756\n421\n0\n410\n\n503\n\n9\n4\n1\n1\n0\n3\n1\n1\n3\n0\n0\n4\n\n329\n0\n0\n612\n602\n821\n0\n568\n580\n443\n0\n415\n\n447\n\n19\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n2\n1\n0\n4\n\n30\n\n306\n0\n0\n536\n672\n396\n0\n351\n424\n508\n0\n368\n\n338\n\n29\n0\n0\n1\n0\n2\n0\n1\n2\n0\n0\n3\n\n38\n\n326\n0\n690\n234\n247\n260\n625\n288\n440\n729\n0\n290\n\n322\n\n21\n0\n0\n1\n4\n9\n0\n6\n2\n0\n0\n4\n\n47\n\n640\n491\n0\n970\n580\n456\n502\n347\n563\n0\n0\n620\n\n546\n\n2\n2\n0\n0\n2\n3\n0\n4\n6\n0\n0\n1\n\n20\n\n368\n0\n0\n895\n0\n761\n539\n357\n670\n781\n850\n630\n\n597\n\n11\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n3\n3\n0\n0\n5\n\n24\n\n414\n    0\n    0\n321\n350\n548\n402\n460\n408\n410\n    0\n402\n\n416\n\n25\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n4\n0\n0\n0\n\n32\n\nTable A12.2:  Poverty Share By Sector Of Employment\n(Percentage of Households)\n\nSector\n\nBanlung Kampot\n\nKompong\nSpeu\n\nPrey\nVeng\n\nSisophon\n\nStung\nTreng\n\nSvay\nRieng\n\nTakeo\n\nAgriculture\nFishing\nMining\nManufacture\nConstruction\nTrade/Repair\nCatering/Business\nTransport\nAdministration\nCommunity\nPrivate/NGO\nUnemployed\n\n8\n0\n0\n0\n1\n2\n0\n1\n9\n0\n0\n2\n\n  Total Poverty\n\n23\n\n27\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 1 November 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nKR1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013\n=\n=\n", "Riel (KR)\n$0.000261\nKR3,835\n", "For the calculations in this report, an exchange rate of KR3,800 = $1.00 is used.\nThis was the rate prevailing at the time of appraisal.\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "Asian Development Bank\nAgence Francaise de Developpement\nElectricity Authority of Cambodia\nElectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge\ninitial environmental examination\nindependent power producer\nMinistry of Economy and Finance\nMinistry of Industry, Mines and Energy\npolychlorinated biphenyl\npower purchase agreement\ntechnical assistance\nUnited Nations Development Programme\n", "ADB\nAFD\nEAC\nEDC\nIEE\nIPP\nMEF\nMIME\nPCB\nPPA\nTA\nUNDP\n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES\n", "(volt)\n(kilovolt)\n(kilovolt-ampere)\n(watt)\n", "V\nkV\nkVA\nW\nkW (kilowatt)\nMW (megawatt)\n(watt-hour)\nWh\nkWh\n(kilowatt-hour)\nMWh (megawatt-hour)\nGWh (gigawatt-hour)\n(decibel)\nDb\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "unit of electrical voltage\n1,000 V\n1,000 volt-amperes\nunit of active power\n1,000 W\n1,000,000 W\nunit of Energy\n1,000 Wh\n1,000,000 Wh\n1,000,000 kWh\nunit of sound intensity\n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.\nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.\n", "CONTENTS\n", "LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY\n", "MAP\n", "I. \n", "II. \n", "THE PROPOSAL\n", "INTRODUCTION\n", "III. \n", "BACKGROUND\n", "IV. \n", "THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n", "A. \nB. \nC. \nD. \nE. \nF. \n", "A.\nB.\nC.\nD.\nE.\nF.\nG. \nH.\n", "Sector Description\nGovernment Policies and Plans\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\nLessons Learned\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\nPolicy Dialogue\n", "Rationale\nObjectives and Scope\nTechnical Justification\nCost Estimates\nFinancing Plan\nImplementation Arrangements\nThe Executing Agency\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n", "V. \n", "PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n", "A. \nB. \nC. \n", "Economic and Financial Analyses\nImpact on Poverty\nRisks\n", "VI. \n", "ASSURANCES\n", "A.\nB.\n", "Specific Assurances\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n", "VII.\n", "RECOMMENDATION\n", "APPENDIXES\n", "  \n", "  \n", "Page\n", "    ii\n", "   v\n", "   1\n", "   1\n", "   1\n", "   1\n   5\n   8\n   9\n 10\n 11\n", " 12\n", " 12\n 13\n 16\n 16\n 17\n 18\n 20\n 25\n", " 27\n", " 27\n 29\n 30\n", " 31\n", " 31\n 33\n", " 33\n", " 34\n"]}
