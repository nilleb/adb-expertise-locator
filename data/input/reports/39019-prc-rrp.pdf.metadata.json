An  initial  environmental  examination  was \nundertaken.  The  summary  initial  environmental  examination  was \ncirculated to the Board in February 2006. \n \nThe  Project  covers  the  municipalities  of  Wuhan  and  Bayannur    in \nInner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region  (IMAR)  and  consists  of  the \nfollowing:  (i)  improvement  of  central  heating  supply  in  Dengkou, \nHangjinhouqi,  Linhe,  Wuhai,  Wulatehouqi,  Wulateqianqi, \nWulatezhongqi,  and  Wuyuan;  (ii)  gas  transmission/distribution \nimprovement  in  these  eight  areas;  (iii)  wastewater  treatment  in \nWulatehouqi  and  Wulateqianqi;  and  (iv)  institutional  reforms  and \ncorporate  governance  improvement  for  all  project  implementing \nagencies  (PIAs).  Policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  during \nproject processing focused on (i) maximizing benefits to the poor \nand ensuring that the poor have sufficient heating by establishing \nspecific  gas  and  heating  assistance  programs,  (ii)  implementing \nmarket-based  tariff  reforms  and  improving  billing  collection,  and \n(iii) promoting private sector participation. \n \nRecent  rapid  economic  growth  has  led  to  worsening  trends  of \nenvironmental  pollution  and  ecosystem  degradation,  particularly \nair and water quality in all major areas (including the eight project \nareas).  The \nimproved  economic  performance  will  not  be \nsustainable if the government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion (GIMAR) does not immediately respond to the worsening \ntrend of air and water pollution. Urban environmental improvement \nrequires a comprehensive approach including addressing air and \nwater  pollution,  providing  clean  and  cheaper  fuel,  promoting \nprivate  sector  participation  and  institutional  strengthening  to \nimprove  operational  efficiency  of  public  utilities,  and  encouraging \nenergy  conservation.  GIMAR\u2019s  willingness  to  improve  the  urban \nenvironment  will  provide  a  supportive  environment \nfor \nimplementing an environmental improvement project in IMAR.  \n \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nPeriod of Utilization \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\nto \n\nregulatory \n\nimplement \n\ntariff  and \n\ntreatment  plants  and  a  sewage  network \n\nThe Project will improve the environment by reducing atmospheric \nand water pollution in IMAR. This will be achieved by establishing \nan  efficient,  safe,  and  reliable  gas  and  heating  supply  and \nwastewater  treatment  facilities  to  protect  water  resources,  which \nwill conserve energy and water resources in the project areas. \n \nThe Project will have four outputs or components. Component \nA will improve the central heating systems in the project areas \nby installing efficient and large boilers to facilitate the closure of \n396 existing small coal-fired boilers. Component B will provide gas \ntransmission  and  distribution  systems  in  these  areas  to  supply \nclean  and  cheaper  gas  to  replace  liquefied  petroleum  gas  and \ncoal  consumption.  Component  C  will  protect  water  resources  by \nenhancing wastewater treatment capacity through construction of \nwastewater \nin \nWulateqianqi  and  Wulatehouqi.  Component  D  comprises \n(i) institutional  strengthening  and  training  for  implementing  the \ninstitutional and financial reform action plans, (ii) assistance to the \nPIAs \nreforms,  and \n(iii) development of options for private sector participation. Overall, \nthe Project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \noperational strategy in the PRC \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $330.4  million \nequivalent including contingencies  \n \nA loan of $120.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility  to  cover  36%  of  the  project  cost  including \ninterest  and  commitment  charge  during  construction  on  the  ADB \nloan. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of \n5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the \ndraft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  The  balance  of  the  project \ncost  will  be  financed  by  equity  of  $175.4  million  (53%)  from  the \nPIAs and domestic loans of $35.0 million (11%).  \n \nThe ADB loan proceeds will be made available by the Borrower to \nGIMAR through a subsidiary loan agreement. These proceeds will \nin  turn  be  onlent,  in  succession,  to  the  municipalities  and/or \ncounties  and  PIAs.  All  subsidiary  and  onlending  agreements  will \nbe made on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. \n \nUntil 31 December 2011 \n \n30 June 2011 \n \nGovernment of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region \n \n\n\f \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 4.5 years. GIMAR will be the \nExecuting  Agency.  The  subcomponents  will  be  implemented  by \neight  PIAs.  A  project  management  office  will  be  responsible  for \nmanaging,  coordinating,  and  supervising \nimplementation  of \nproject  subcomponents.  Each  PIA  will  establish  a  project \nimplementation office to undertake direct responsibility for design, \nconstruction, and operation of subprojects. Project implementation \nstarted in August 2006 with the preparation of bidding documents. \n \nEquipment, materials, and services financed from the proceeds of \nthe  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. Items financed with local currency funds \nby  GIMAR  will  be  procured  following  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Advance procurement action and \nretroactive  financing  was  requested  by  GIMAR  and  approved  by \nADB. \n \nTwelve  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n85 person-months of national consulting services will be provided \nto  assist  GIMAR  with  project  implementation,  including  project \nsupervision  and \nmanagement,  procurement, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  project  impacts.  An  additional \n8 person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services  and \n38 person-months of national consulting services will be provided \nfacilitating \nfor \nimplementation  of  heating  tariff  reforms.  All  consultants  will  be \nselected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nthe Use of Consultants. \n \nBy  addressing  air  and  water  pollution,  the  Project  will  indirectly \nbenefit the entire urban population of about 2.2 million residing in \nthe eight project areas.  An estimated 71,324 or 7.5% of the total \nurban  beneficiaries  are  poor  as  measured  by  the  various  city \npoverty lines. The increased use of gas and better central heating \nsupplies  will  reduce  the  use  of  conventional  fuels  such  as  raw \ncoal, wood, and coal briquettes to mitigate adverse environmental \nand  health  impacts,  particularly  on  the  poor.  Approximately \n0.96 million  urban  residents  will  benefit  from  the  natural  gas  and \ncentral heating supply with the Project. The wastewater treatment \nprograms \nreduce \nwastewater pollution and improve the living conditions and social \neconomic environment in the two counties.  \n \n \n\nin  Wulateqianqi  and  Wulatehouqi  will \n\nimplementing \n\nconstruction \n\ninstitutional \n\nreforms \n\nand \n\niii\n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  energy  efficiency  of  gas  and  heating \nsupply  by  22%  and  conserve  energy  annually  equivalent  to \n540,000  tons  (t)  of  standard  coal.  The  Project  will  provide \nsubstantial  environmental  and  health  benefits,  including  annual \nemission reduction of total suspended particulates, sulfur dioxide, \nnitrogen  oxides,  and  greenhouse  gas  of  carbon  dioxide.  The \nwastewater  treatment  component  will  lead  to  annual  discharge \nreduction of chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand, \nsuspended  solids,  ammonia  nitrogen,  total  nitrogen,  and  total \nphosphorus.  The  quantifiable  local  and  global  environmental \nbenefits  over  the  project  life  are  expected  to  be  about  CNY52.2 \nmillion  and  CNY43  million,  respectively,  in  net  present  value  at \n2004  prices.  Unquantifiable  environmental  benefits,  such  as \nreduced  damage  from  the  wastewater  of  small  boilers  and  gas \nleaks, are also expected to be significant. \n \nThe  economic  and  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  whole \nProject  are  satisfactory  at  21.4%  (with  local  environmental \nbenefits)  and  7.7%,  respectively.  The  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact \nratio  is  estimated  at  13.5%,  higher  than  the  ratio  of  poverty \npopulation  to  total  population  in  the  project  areas  (7.5%).  The \nProject will create about 10,240 person-years of job opportunities \nduring  construction  and  1,412 \njobs  during  project \noperation. Of the total, 4,090 person-years of job opportunities will \nbe  filled  by  the  poor,  women,  and  minorities  with  an  estimated \ntotal of CNY44.2 million in wage payments during construction. In \naddition,  565  employment  opportunities  with  CNY6.1  million  of \nannual  wage  payments  are  expected  to  go  to  the  poor,  women, \nand  minorities  during  project  operation.  A  total  of  52,337  poor \nhouseholds will benefit from a discount on gas and heating supply \nconnection  fees  (22,971  poor  households)  and  gas  and  heating \nbills  (29,366  poor  households),  resulting  in  estimated  annual \nfees  and \nsavings  of  CNY10.2  million \nCNY26.84 million in discounts on gas and heating bills. \n \nThe risk of insufficient gas and heating demand for the Project is \nminimal as the gas and central heating supply under the Project is \nmainly \nfraction  of \nincremental  demand.  Macroeconomic  conditions  are  expected  to \ncontinue to be sound with continuing political stability in the PRC \nand strong economic performance in IMAR. GIMAR will issue and \nenforce  stricter  air  and  water  quality  standards.  The  gas  and \ncentral  heating  supply,  and  wastewater  treatment  under  the \nProject  are  based  on  proven  designs  and  conventional \ntechnologies that have been successfully used in the PRC; no \n\nto  meet  existing  demand  and  a  small \n\nconnection \n\nfull-time \n\nin \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n \n\nsupervision  under \n\ntimely  submission  of \n\nsignificant technical risks are anticipated. The risk of the delay in \nloan  effectiveness  and  construction  due  to  late  internal  approval \nand procurement are addressed by early preparation of all related \nreports, \nrelevant  documents,  and \nprocurement training for all PIAs. The PIAs will be subject to good \ngovernance \nthe  project  performance \nmanagement  system.  ADB\u2019s  close  involvement  will  ensure  that \ncompetent  consultants  will  be  recruited  on  time.  To  fully  assess \nthe  potential  project  risks,  a  probabilistic  risk  analysis  was \nperformed  using  the  Monte  Carlo  simulation  technique  based  on \n3,000 simulations for the economic and financial internal rates of \nreturn  and  the  poverty  impact  ratio.  The  risk  analysis  concludes \nthat the Project is robust under future uncertainties, that the risks \nassociated  with  it  are  minimal  and  acceptable,  and  that  the \nprobability of negative outcomes for the poor is also minimal.  \n \n\nv\n\n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region \nEnvironment Improvement Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  PRC  has  severe  environmental  problems  associated  with  rapid  economic  growth, \nheavy reliance on coal as the primary fuel, and use of obsolete technology in some industries. \nThe State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) estimates that since the early 1990s \npollution  has  resulted  in  a  loss  to  the  PRC  economy  of  approximately  4%  of  gross  domestic \nproduct (GDP), with air pollution accounting for 59%, water pollution 36%, and solid waste 5%.1 \nIn particular, the SEPA estimates that damage from sulfur dioxide (SO2) and acid rain costs the \ncountry CNY110 billion annually. Of the PRC\u2019s 342 major areas, only 132 met the national class \nII air quality standard in 2004. By 2005, only 30% of the rivers met their designated water quality \nstandards,  or  about  half  the  Government\u2019s  target  in  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005).  In \nseven  major  river  basins,  52%  of  river  courses  do  not  meet  the  class  III  standard.  The \nGovernment\u2019s efforts in environmental improvement have resulted in a steady decline of major \nair  emissions  since  the  mid-1990s.  However,  during  2002\u20132004,  PRC  energy  consumption \nincreased by 40%, with the consumption of coal, oil, natural gas, and hydropower increasing by \n45%,  33%,  37%,  and  30%,  respectively.  Since  2002,  emissions  have  resumed  the  upward \ntrend. Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) is one of the PRC provinces with severe air \npollution problems in areas due to its heavy reliance on coal as the primary fuel for industry and \nresidential  consumption.  In  2004,  only  7  of  21  areas  in  IMAR  met  the  national  air  quality \nstandards. A sector and subsector analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n \nIn  2004,  90%  of  SO2 and  85%  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  emitted  into  the  air  in  the  PRC \n3. \nresulted  from  burning  coal.  The  PRC  is  now  the  world\u2019s  largest  coal  producer  and  consumer. \nProduction  of  raw  coal  nearly  doubled  in  4  years,  from  1,000  million  tons  (t)  in  2000  to \n1,956 million t in 2004\u2014about 35% of global production in 2004. Coal accounted for 67.7% of \nthe  nation\u2019s  total  energy  consumption  in  2004  and  will  continue  to  be  the  primary  energy \nresource  for  the  foreseeable  future.  In  2003  and  2004,  the  PRC\u2019s  GDP  grew  at  9.5%,  but \nprimary  energy  consumption  grew  at  15.3%.  To  meet  the  increasing  energy  demand,  coal \nproduction  increased  by  20.8%  in  2003  and  17.3%  in  2004.  Natural  gas  production  increased \nfrom  27.2  billion  cubic  meters  (m3)  in  2000  to  41.5  billion  m3  in  2004,  representing  a  52.5% \nincrease.  In  IMAR,  coal  production  was  203.3 million  t  in  2004  with  over  78  active  coal  mines \nwith capacity greater than 30,000 t per year. State-owned coal mines account for 80% of coal \nproduction  capacity.  In  2004,  the  per  capita  reserves  of  coal,  oil,  and  natural  gas  in  the  PRC \nwere 56%, 11%, and 0.4%, respectively, of the world\u2019s average. \n \n4. \nUrban gas and heating demands have grown rapidly due to rising incomes, privatization \nof residential housing, and housing sector growth. As incomes increase, people living in the cold \nnorthern provinces have demanded more and better heating. Central heating in terms of square \nmeters  (m2)  recorded  an  annual  growth  rate  of  16%  between  1992  and  2004.  Nationwide, \nresidential  buildings  account  for  about  70%  of  the  total  space  heating,  with  commercial  and \npublic  buildings  accounting  for  the  remaining  30%.  Heating  demand  in  IMAR  has  also  grown \nrapidly  during  the  past  decade.  In  the  PRC,  over  60 million  t  of  coal  are  burned  by  500,000 \n                                                 \n1  Based  on  a  study  by  the  Policy  Research  Center  for  Environment  and  Economy  of  the  State  Environmental \n\nProtection Administration. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nsmall,  inefficient,  coal-fired  heating  boilers  every  year,  resulting  in  the  emission  of  substantial \namounts  of  SO2,  CO2,  nitrogen  oxide  (NOx),  and  total  suspended  particulates  (TSP).  The \nmajority  of  urban  heating  supply  in  IMAR  comes  from  5,000  of  these  small  boilers,  creating \nsevere air pollution problems in urban areas. \n \nMunicipal  wastewater  is  a  major  contributor  to  pollution  of  the  PRC\u2019s  rivers  and  lakes. \n5. \nFor  many  PRC  areas,  in  the  absence  of  a  centralized  municipal  wastewater  treatment  plant, \nmixtures of raw municipal wastewater and partially treated industrial wastewater are discharged \ndirectly  to  the  nearest  body  of  water.  According  to  water  quality  standards,  surface  water \nsources  serving  municipal  water  supply  systems  are  polluted  to  unacceptable  levels.  In  2004, \nmunicipal  sources  generated  65%  of  the  country\u2019s  estimated  46  billion  m3  of  wastewater; \nindustrial  sources  generated  35%. Effective  municipal  wastewater  treatment  is  still  in  its  early \nstages, with only about 40% of municipal wastewater treated. Although about 90% of industrial \nwastewater is treated, much of it meets only low effluent standards before discharge. Similarly, \nabout  44%  of  wastewater  in  IMAR  was  treated  in  2004;  the  rest  was  discharged  untreated, \nmainly into the Yellow River and Wuliangsuhai Lake, affecting downstream water quality. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nKey Problems and Constraints \n\nIMAR has a population of about 24 million, with 26% living in urban areas. As one of the \n6. \n12 western provinces, its economic development has been relatively slow. In 2004, the average \nper  capita  GDP  in  IMAR  was  CNY11,305,  slightly  higher  than  the  national  average  of \nCNY10,561.  Of  IMAR's  101  counties,  31  are  national  poverty  counties  and  29  are  provincial \npoverty  counties.  IMAR\u2019s  GDP  increased  8%  annually  in  real  terms  between  1990  and  1995, \nand  12%  between  1996  and  2004.  Recent  rapid  economic  growth  has  led  to  the  worsening \ntrend of environmental pollution and ecosystem degradation, particularly air and water quality in \nall  major  areas  (including  the  eight  project  areas).  Water  shortage  has  become  a  major \nconstraint  of  IMAR\u2019s  economic  development.  Recent  improved  economic  performance  will  not \nbe sustainable if the government of IMAR (GIMAR) does not immediately react to the worsening \ntrend of air and water pollution. \n \nContinued  strong  economic  growth  in  IMAR,  combined  with  a  significant  increase  in \n7. \nurban housing construction, has resulted in gas, heating, and water demand outpacing supply. \nConcerns  are  growing  about  ensuring  sufficient  gas,  heating,  and  water  supply  for  the  urban \npoor.  The  adverse  effects  of  urban  poverty  are  often  compounded  by  environmental  pollution \nfrom energy and water sources at the household level. The gas, heating, and water distribution \nsystems are usually badly functioning or absent in the poorer sections of the city. The poor do \nnot  have  the  information,  access,  or  funds  for  more  efficient  (less-polluting)  equipment  and \nfuels. Poorly maintained gas, heating, and water distribution systems increase the exposure of \nthe  poor  to  daily  doses  of  pollutants,  as  well  as  to  the  risk  of  accidents.  Indoor  air  pollution \nparticularly puts women and children at risk. \n \n8. \nIn IMAR, SOEs have provided public utilities. They have low efficiency, low profitability \nand liquidity, and partly rely on local government support for their operations. The low efficiency \nof  public  utilities  has  resulted  in  substantial  waste  of  energy  and  water  resources,  and \nenvironmental pollution and ecosystem degradation. The experience in IMAR and elsewhere in \nthe PRC indicates that SOE supply of public utilities is not sustainable. The private sector needs \nto  participate  in  public  utilities  to  set  benchmarks  and  improve  efficiency.  So  far,  the  private \nsector has only very limited involvement in urban gas, heating, and water supply in IMAR. The \npresent business environment and conditions of public utilities do not provide enough incentives \nto  attract  private  investors  because  of  (i) technical  and/or  institutional  uncertainties  involving \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nlocal  government  control  over  gas  and  heating  distribution,  (ii) poor  fee  collection  because \nheating has traditionally been considered as part of the welfare system, (iii) lower profit margins \ndue  to  the  Government\u2019s  policy  for  public  utilities,  (iv) difficulties  in  obtaining  long-term  loans \ndue  to  low  profitability  and  discrimination  of  the  private  sector  by  state-owned  banks,  and \n(v)  lack of clear and transparent tariff setting and approval criteria and procedures. \n \n\n2. \n\nStrategies of the Government and Asian Development Bank \n\n9. \nOne  of  GIMAR\u2019s  main  development  objectives  is  to  contain  the  worsening  trend  of \nenvironmental pollution and ecosystem degradation, and to improve the environment in areas. \nGIMAR\u2019s environmental strategy will focus on strengthening its control of pollutant discharge by \nissuing regulations and water standards, and improving monitoring and enforcement. Air quality \nin  areas  will  be  improved  by  substituting  coal  with  gas  where  feasible,  closing  polluting  small \nboilers  for  heating,  and  increasing  the  use  of  efficient  technologies  and  management  that \nminimize urban pollution. Wastewater treatment will be another area of GIMAR\u2019s development \nfocus to provide clean water to its residents and alleviate water shortage. \n \nThe operational strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the PRC aims to help \n10. \nthe country achieve economic growth in an efficient, equitable, and sustainable manner. ADB\u2019s \nenergy  sector  strategy  includes  (i) developing  cleaner  energy  sources,  (ii) renovating  and \nretrofitting  existing  facilities  to  improve  efficiency  and  reduce  emissions,  (iii) promoting  the \ncorporatization  and  commercialization  of  energy  utilities,  and  (iv)  supporting  tariff  reforms. \nThis is complemented by ADB's strategy for the environment sector, which supports the use of \neconomic,  supply-side,  and  other  measures  to  (i) ensure  sustainable  utilization  of  natural \nresources  and  promotion  of  market-based  pricing,  and  (ii) encourage  cost  recovery  and  better \nenvironmental  information  disclosure.  For  wastewater  treatment  and  the  protection  of  water \nresources,  ADB  is  focusing  on  (i)  improving  wastewater  treatment  and  water  supply  services \nthrough  investment  on  physical  infrastructure,  (ii)  promoting  improved  corporate  governance \nand  commercial  management  to  enhance  the  potential  for  future  private  sector  involvement, \n(iii) improving  cost  recovery  by  strengthening  tariff  systems  and  structures,  and  (iv)  ensuring \nwater resource conservation and environmental protection by continuing support for legislative \nand  regulatory  provisions.  By  working  to  reduce  emissions  and  protect  water  resources,  the \nProject is consistent with and provides support for GIMAR\u2019s development objectives and ADB\u2019s \nenergy, water, and environmental strategy. \n \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities \n\nIMAR  has  air  pollution  problems  due  to  heavy  reliance  on  coal  as  the  primary  fuel  for \n11. \nindustry  and  residential  consumption,  particularly  urban  heating  supply  provided  by  small  and \ninefficient  coal-fired  heating  boilers.  In  2004,  IMAR  generated  0.75  billion  m3  of  wastewater\u2014\n31% from industrial sources\u2014only 44% of the total was treated. Demand for gas, heating, and \nwater  supply  for  domestic  and  industrial  use  in  IMAR  has  been  increasing,  imposing  great \npressure  on  its  limited  resources.  GIMAR  considers  that  proper  treatment  of  wastewater,  and \nadequate gas and heating supply are essential to enhance the living standards and productivity \nof  urban  residents,  protect  energy  and  water  resources,  and  sustain  the  current  level  of \neconomic  growth.  GIMAR  will  improve  air  and  water  quality  in  all  major  areas  (including  the \neight  project  areas)  to  meet  the  national  air  and  water  quality  standards  by  2010.  To  achieve \nthis, GIMAR will issue and enforce stricter air and water quality standards. By addressing both \nair and water pollution, the Project will be a major part of this effort. The Project, by improving \nthe  efficiency  and  capacity  of  gas  and  heating  supply  systems,  closing  the  existing  396  small \nheating boilers in the project area, providing wastewater treatment facilities to collect and treat \nmore  than  80%  of  urban  wastewater  in  two  project  areas,  and  implementing  tariff  reforms  to \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nencourage  demand-side  management,  will  help  reduce  air  and  water  pollution  in  IMAR  and \nconserve energy. \n \n12. \nThe  affordability  of  the poor  for  gas,  heating,  and  water  services  is  a major  concern  in \nIMAR. For example, the average heating bill for a poor household living in a 40 m2 apartment \nunit  in  IMAR  is  about  CNY160/month  during  the  5-month  heating  season.  In  a  typical  poor \nhousehold of four, the income at the poverty line is CNY520/household/month in Linhe, CNY600 \nin  Wuhai,  and  CNY912  in  Wulateqianqi.  Thus,  the  heating  bill  represents  a  large  portion  of  a \npoor  household\u2019s  monthly  income  (30.7%  in  Linhe,  26.7%  in  Wuhai,  and  17.5%  in \nWulateqianqi). This creates a serious affordability problem for poor households with income at \nor below the city poverty lines. In the project area where the temperature in the winter can go as \nlow  as  minus  250  Celsius,  insufficient  heating  supply  will  severely  affect  the  quality  of  life  and \nhealth  of  the  poor.  GIMAR  is  willing  to  make  efforts  to  provide  a  certain  level  of  urban  living \nstandards to address the growing concern of urban poverty, including improving infrastructure of \npublic  utilities  and  establishing  social  assistance  programs.  Cost  savings  resulting  from  the \nefficiency improvements of the Project will be passed on to the poor in the form  of lower gas, \nheating,  and  water  bills,  and  connection  fee  discounts.  Other  assistance  programs  will  be \ndesigned to alleviate affordability problems. \n \n13. \nAlthough private sector participation is a new phenomenon in public utilities in IMAR, it \nhas  demonstrated  positive  impacts  in  terms  of  better  management  and  operational  efficiency. \nBetween  now  and  2020,  IMAR  will  need  substantial  capital  investments  to  meet  rising  gas, \nheating,  and  water  demand.  The  resources  of  local  governments  and  those  provided  by  the \ncentral  Government  can  only  meet  20%  to  25%  of  the  investment  requirement.  GIMAR \nrecognizes  the  importance  of  private  sector  participation  in  sustaining  supply  of  public  utilities \nand  is  willing  to  support  private  sector  involvement  by  providing  a  guarantee  for  lower  cost \nfunding and by carrying out necessary reforms. With GIMAR support, the Project, by selecting \nBayannur  Municipality  as  a  pilot,  will  directly  support  private  sector  participation  by  providing \nbetter  project  facilities,  and  removing  barriers  and  creating  an  enabling  environment  through \npolicy  dialogue  in  tariff  reform  and  institutional  strengthening.  The  Project\u2019s  institutional \nstrengthening  will  address  the  issues  of  implementing  capacity,  full-cost  recovery,  and \nimprovement of corporate governance. \n \nThe  urban  environmental  improvement  requires  a  comprehensive  approach  and \n14. \nGIMAR\u2019s willingness to make efforts to improve the urban environment will provide a supportive \nenvironment  for  implementing  an  environmental  improvement  project  in  IMAR.  The  project \ndesign  takes  into  consideration  problem  and  constraints  analysis,  lessons  learned,  and \nassessment of alternative approaches. The focus of policy dialogue was based on the findings \nof  ADB  missions, \nthe  Government,  beneficiary  consultations, \ndiscussions  with  other  funding  agencies,  and  recommendations  of  the  feasibility  reports  and \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA) consultants. \n \n\ninformation  provided  by \n\n4. \n\nLessons Learned \n\n15. \nADB\u2019s experience in the PRC\u2019s energy sector has shown that projects are generally well \nplanned and implemented smoothly. The overall implementation performance of ADB\u2019s energy \nportfolio  is  satisfactory.  Compliance  with  covenants  is  generally  acceptable,  although  greater \nefforts  are  required  to  implement  policy-related  covenants.  Rigorous  government  screening  of \nprojects  has  had  a  positive  impact.  The  project  completion  and  project  performance  audit \nreports  for  energy  projects  indicate  that  overall  they  were  implemented  smoothly,  and  assess \nthem  all  as  generally  successful.  Recently,  some  ongoing  energy  projects  in  the  PRC  have \nexperienced  implementation  delays  relating  to  long  internal  approval  processes,  procurement \nissues, and large cost savings. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n \nThe  project  completion  reports  prepared  for  three  ADB  environment  projects  and  the \n16. \nproject  performance  evaluation  reports  for  one  of  the  environment  projects  revealed  that  the \nactual  achievements  of  some  heating  supply  components  were  lower  than  estimated  at \nappraisal. This was due to several factors, such as lower demand for heating, insufficient heat \nsource,  unsuitable  design  for  switching  from  coal  to  natural  gas,  and  lower  heat  and  power \ntariffs  than  anticipated  at  appraisal.  Some  projected  industrial  establishments  either  did  not \nmaterialize  or  lacked  the  financial  capacity  to  pay  for  heating  services.  Some  heating \ncomponents  were  canceled  when  no  noticeable  progress  was  made  and  after \nthe \nimplementation  agencies  realized  that  the  projected  market  for  steam  and  heat  usage  was \noverly  optimistic.  In  addition,  the  design  to  switch  these  heating  companies\u2019  fuel  source  from \ncoal  to  natural  gas  would  have  seriously  affected  their  financial  viability  and  required  large \ngovernment  subsidies.  The  lower  heat  and  power  tariffs  coupled  with  lower  achievements \nprevented the project entities from achieving good financial performance. Lessons learned from \nADB\u2019s  post-evaluation  experience  in  wastewater  treatment  indicate  that  both  supply  and \ndemand-side concerns must be integrated into project design. Encouraging broad reforms such \nas  commercial  management  and  introducing  competition  will  promote  efficient  and  responsive \ndelivery  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  services.  The  Project  will  ensure  the  viability  and \nsustainability of gas, heating, and water supply by incorporating these lessons in project design, \npreparation, risk assessment, and implementation. Appendix 3 presents a summary of external \nassistance and lessons learned.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n17. \nThe Project will improve the environment by reducing atmospheric and water pollution in \nIMAR.  This  will  be  achieved  by  establishing  an  efficient,  safe,  and  reliable  gas  and  heating \nsupply to facilitate the closure of small coal-fired boilers, and wastewater treatment facilities to \nprotect water resources, which will conserve energy and water resources in the project areas. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe Project has four components: urban central heating supply; natural gas transmission \n18. \nand distribution; urban wastewater treatment; and institutional reform and corporate governance \nimprovement.  The  feasibility  studies  and  engineering  design  for  the  subcomponents  were \nprepared  by  several  design  and  engineering  institutes  in  the  PRC  with  experience  and \nqualifications acceptable to ADB. The project preparatory TA consultants reviewed the feasibility \nstudy  reports  and  other  supplementary  documents.  They  noted  that  their  previous  comments \nwere reflected in the project design and were satisfied with the quality of the feasibility studies \nand engineering design. \n \n19. \nComponent  A:  Urban  Central  Heating  Supply.  Component  A  comprises  eight \nsubcomponents and will involve the installation of 21 large efficient coal-fired boilers, 138 heat \nexchange  stations,  and  87.6  kilometers  (km)  of  heat  supply  pipelines  to  facilitate  closure  of \n396 small inefficient coal-fired boilers. The subcomponents are listed in Table 1. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nCity \n\n \n\n \nDengkou \nA.1 \nHangjinhouqi \nA.2 \nLinhe \nA.3 \nA.4  Wuhai \nA.5  Wulatehouqi \nA.6  Wulateqianqi \nA.7  Wulatezhongqi \nA.8  Wuyuan \n\nTable 1: Subcomponents under Component A \n\nNew Boilers \n\nNo. \n3a \n3 \n \n4 \n2 \n3 \n2 \n4a \n\n(MW) \n29x3 \n58x3 \n \n64x2+29x2 \n29x2 \n29x3 \n29x2 \n29x4 \n\nHeat Exchange \nStations \nNo. \n11 \n31 \n31 \n22 \n14 \n9 \n8 \n12 \n\nHeat Supply \nPipelines \nkm \n3.0 \n10.6 \n36.2 \n10.7 \n9.0 \n9.8 \n3.0 \n5.3 \n\nOld Boilers \nClosure \nNo. \n39 \n11 \n58 \n112 \n35 \n64 \n20 \n57 \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n21 \n\n766 \n\n138 \n\n87.6 \n\n396 \n\nNo. = number; MW = megawatt; km = kilometer. \na  Circulating fluidized bed (CFB)-type boilers. \nSource: Project Management Office. \n \n20. \nComponent B: Natural Gas Transmission and Distribution. Component B comprises \ntwo  subcomponents:  (i)  the  Changqing\u2013Wuhai\u2013Linhe  natural  gas  transmission  pipeline \nsubcomponent  will  construct  a  401  km  pipeline  across  the  region  of  Erdos,  Wuhai,  and \nBayannur;  and  (ii)  the  natural  gas  distribution  subcomponent  will  construct  (a)  natural  gas \ndistribution  networks  in  eight  areas  (same  as  component  A),  and  (b)  one  master  compressed \nnatural gas station in Linhe to supply compressed natural gas. \n \n21. \nComponent  C:  City  Wastewater  Treatment.  Component  C  has  two  subcomponents: \n(i) the  Wulatehouqi  wastewater  treatment  plant  and  sewage  network  subcomponent  will \nconstruct (a) a 6,000 t/day wastewater treatment plant, and (b) 13.2 km sewage piping network; \nand  (ii) the  Wulateqianqi  wastewater  treatment  plant  and  sewage  network  subcomponent  will \nconstruct  (a)  a  80,000  t/day  wastewater  plant  to  treat  the  city\u2019s  wastewater  and  industrial \nwastewater, and (b) a 40.0 km sewage piping network and five pumping stations.  \n \nComponent  D:  Institutional  Reform  and  Corporate  Governance  Improvement. \n22. \nInstitutional  capacity  and  corporate  governance  aspects  were  assessed  by  the  project \npreparatory  TA  consultants  for  each  project  implementing  agency  (PIA).  Based  on  the \nassessment, the TA consultants developed an institutional reform action plan for each PIA, and \na financial reform action plan to address cost reduction, bill collection, and financial capacity of \nthe PIAs. Both institutional and financial action plans were discussed with and supported by the \nPIAs.  To  strengthen  the  PIAs\u2019  institutional  and  financial  management  capacity,  component  D \ncomprises  (i) institutional  strengthening  and  training  for  implementing  the  institutional  and \nfinancial  reform  action  plans,  (ii) assistance  to  the  PIAs  to  implement  the  tariff  and  regulatory \nreforms, and (iii) development of options for private sector participation. The institutional reform \nwill require separation of government functions from commercial management of the PIAs, and \ntransforming  the  noncorporate  PIAs  into  new  corporate  structures  according  to  the  PRC\u2019s \nCompany Law. The financial reforms will assist all the PIAs to build capacity in cost reduction, \nbill  collection,  efficient  accounting,  and  commercial  management.  The  consultants  under \ncomponent  D  will  also  help  the  PIAs  prepare  tariff  reform  action  plans  in  accordance  with \nrecommendations  made  by  ADB\u2019s  TA2 for  Pro-Poor  Urban  Heating  Tariff  Reforms.3 The  TA \nformulated  national  pro-poor  heating  tariff  guidelines  and  established  the  principles  of  an \neffective heating tariff collection mechanism. The consultants under component D will also study \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Pro-Poor  Urban  Heating  Tariff  Reforms. \n\n3  The Ministry of Construction was the executing agency for the TA. The TA\u2019s objective was to help the Government \nreform the urban heating sector and promote sustainable urban heating supply in the PRC by (i) formulating pro-\npoor national heating tariff guidelines, and (ii) establishing an effective heating tariff collection mechanism. The TA \nwas completed in 2005. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\noptions for private sector participation in the PIAs. The options developed and implemented will \ndemonstrate  how  public  utilities  can  be  privatized  without  lowering  the  quality  of  utility  supply. \nThe  Project  will  provide  additional  opportunities  for  ADB  to  address  policy  concerns  and  help \ncreate a supportive environment for private sector participation. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n23. \nEnergy Efficiency Improvement and Energy Conservation. Energy conservation and \nefficient  use  of  energy  are  of  high  priority  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010).  ADB  is \nactively supporting the PRC in both these areas. The Project will build large and efficient (above \n80%  combustion  efficiency)  heat  boilers  equipped  with  modern  pollution  control  devices  to \nfacilitate the closure of 396 small coal-fired boilers. These existing small coal-fired boilers have \nlow thermal efficiency in the range of 55% to 65%, and do not have adequate pollution control \ndevices.  In  addition,  the  natural  gas  pipelines  and  urban  gas  distribution  networks  under  the \nProject will provide cleaner fuel that has 25% higher efficiency than coal. Overall, the Project\u2019s \ngas and central heating supply components are expected to improve energy efficiency by 22%. \nThe  improvement  will  annually  conserve  energy  equivalent  to  340,000  t  of  standard  coal  from \nthe central heating supply and 200,000 t from the gas supply. \n \n24. \nUrban  Heating  Tariff  Reforms.  Heating  tariff  reforms  are  required  to  improve  and \nsustain urban heating supply in IMAR. The current average heating tariff of about CNY15/m2 for \nthe heating season in IMAR is still lower than that of other provinces, but reflects supply cost in \nthe  project  areas.4 Tariff  reforms  need  to  focus  on  the  tariff  structure  and  bill  collection.  At \npresent,  all  of  the  urban  heating  tariffs  are  based  on  a  simple  fixed  rate  per  square  meter \n(e.g., CNY/m2)  of  the  living  area  or  floor  area  of  buildings.  Problems  with  the  current  heating \ntariff  structure,  payment,  and  collection  systems  include  (i) the  tariff  structure  does  not \nencourage  efficient  use  of  heat;  (ii) the  enterprise-based  tariff  payment  system  is  not  market-\noriented and causes difficulty in tariff collection and (iii)  transparent criteria and methodologies \nfor  tariff  setting  and  adjustment  are  lacking.  In  addition,  the  layout  of  the  piping  system  in \nexisting  buildings  makes  disconnecting  supply  to  delinquent  customers  difficult  for  the  heating \ncompany. All new buildings in IMAR are required to follow new building codes and use energy-\nefficient building materials. Traditionally in IMAR, heating bills were paid by employers for their \nemployees.  In  the  mid-1990s,  many  SOEs  became  financially  unviable  and  could  not  pay  the \nheating  bills  for  their  employees.  This  caused  tariff  collection  to  drop  to  50%,  creating  severe \nfinancial difficulties for the heating companies. Tariff collection improved to 70% in 2004 in the \nproject areas and a further improvement to 95% is expected with the Project. To address these \nissues,  GIMAR  will  implement  the  agreed  heating  tariff  reforms  in  the  project  areas.  The \nconsultants  under  component  D  will  help  develop  specific  reform  action  plans  for  (i) installing \nradiator  control  valves  in  apartment  units  to  encourage  heat  conservation,  (ii) implementing  a \ntwo-part  heating  tariff  so  that  the  variable  charge  will  be  based  on  actual  heat  consumption, \n(iii) installing  heat-measuring  devices  in  apartment  units  to  support  consumption-based  billing \nsystems,  and  (iv) training  heating  company  staff  on  implementation  of  reform  measures.  After \nthe reforms, consumers will have the ability to regulate the amount of heat that they consume, \nwhich is essential if tariff-based incentives for heat conservation, insulation installation, and heat \nloss reduction are to work. \n \n25. \nPrivate Sector Participation. With the combined efforts of GIMAR and the ADB project \nteam,  the  Project  will  establish  private  sector  participation  in  central  heating  and  wastewater \ntreatment subsectors in IMAR. Bayannur municipality was selected as the pilot area to involve \nthe  private  sector  in  public  utilities.  The  Project  will  directly  support  five  privately  owned \n\n                                                 \n4  The  heating  tariff  of  CNY15/m2  in  IMAR  is  lower  than  about  CNY19.5/m2 in  Xinjiang,  CNY20/m2  in  Heilongjiang, \n\nand CNY24/m2 in Beijing. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ncompanies in central heating supply and wastewater treatment to upgrade and expand heating \nsupply services and provide wastewater treatment facilities. Through policy dialogue and other \nreform  measures,  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector  participation  will  be  created  by \nreducing  institutional  uncertainties,  improving  fee  collection,  and  promoting  transparent  tariff \nsetting.  The  five  private  heating  companies  involved  expect  to  benefit  from  the  Project  in  the \nareas of technology upgrade, institutional strengthening, and heating tariff reforms. For the local \ngovernments, the efficiency gains of the heating supply companies with the Project will be used \nto reduce the financial burden in subsidizing the poor and proper treatment of wastewater that \nwas  discharged  untreated  into  the  Yellow  River.  Further,  a  better  managed  heating  subsector \nwill reduce the efforts of local governments to ensure that their urban residents have sufficient \nheating.  The  Project  will  demonstrate  that  private  sector  participation  in  public  utilities  can  be \nbeneficial  to  all  parties,  and  will  catalyze  private  sector  involvement  in  the  heating  and  water \nsubsectors in IMAR. The consultants under component D will identify options for future private \nsector participation in the rest of the project implementing companies. \n \n26. \nBenefits for the Poor. In the project areas, heating bills currently account for 17.5% to \n30.7%  of  the  average  monthly  incomes  of  poor  households.  Although  improving  facilities  and \nsupply  efficiency  will  preclude  tariff  increases,  measures  need  to  be  taken  to  make  gas  and \nheating more affordable to the poor. GIMAR agreed to include two specific programs. The first \nwill  require  the  PIAs  to  provide  gas  and  heating  connection,  and  tariff  discounts  to  the  poor, \nbased  on  the  benefits  of  the  cost  savings  arising  from  the  22%  efficiency  improvement  and \nincreasing bill collection to 95%. Each PIA has committed to share the benefits and extend the \ndiscount  to  the  poor  after  satisfying  the  loan  conditions.  They  estimate  that  52,337  poor \nhouseholds  will  benefit:  22,971  from  the  discount  on  gas  and  heating  supply  connection  fees, \nand  29,366  from  the  discount  on  gas  and  heating  bills.  This  will  result  in  an  annual  benefit  of \nCNY10.2 million in connection fees, and CNY26.8 million in discounts on gas and heating bills; \nrepresenting about 1.8% of the total revenue of the gas and heating companies after the Project \nis  completed.  The  second  program  requires  the  county  governments  to  establish  a  heating \nassistance  fund  for  the  poor.  It  will  be  included  in  the  annual  county  budget  and  the  funding \nlevel will not be dependent on budget availability. The county government subsidies through the \nheating assistance fund will be designed so that average heating expenses do not exceed 5% \nof a poor household\u2019s monthly expenditure.  \n \nThe  experience  from  the  ongoing  TA,  Heating  Supply  for  Urban  Poor  in  Liaoning \n27. \nProvince, 5  will  also  help  GIMAR  implement  pro-poor  national  heating  tariff  guidelines  and \nimprove  tariff  collection;  design  heating  assistance  programs  for  the  poor;  and  develop  an \neffective provincial and local monitoring, supervision, and evaluation systems. To make heating \naffordable,  about  CNY13.4 million  will  be  provided  through  the  heating  assistance  fund.  If  the \nfirst program from the  PIAs has a shortfall due to a delay in realizing project benefits, the city \ngovernments  will  increase  the  contribution  to  cover  the  gap.  These  assistance  programs  are \nconsistent  with  ADB  policy  that  tariff  subsidies  to  the  poor  be  transparent  and  explicit,  and \nfunded  by  the  government  budget;  separating  the  welfare  objective  from  the  commercial \nmanagement of public utilities. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n28. \nThe project investment cost is estimated at $330.4 million equivalent, including physical \nand price contingencies, and financial charges during development (Table 2 and Appendix 4). \nThe foreign exchange costs are $135.3 million, or about 41%. \n \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2004.

The loan will have a 25-year \nterm including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75% \nper  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements.  These  finance  charges  during  construction  will  be  financed  from  ADB  loan.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The balance of the project cost will be financed by the PIAs \nthrough  equity  of  $175.44  million  (53.1%)  and  domestic  loans  of  $34.97  million  (10.6%).  The \nloan from local banks will have a repayment period of 5 to 10 years, including a grace period of \n1 to 2 years, and an interest rate of 6.5%. The Borrower will be the PRC, which will make the \nproceeds of the loan available to GIMAR on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB \nloan. These proceeds will in turn be onlent, in succession and on the same terms and conditions \nas the ADB loan, to the municipalities of Bayannur and Wuhai; the counties of Linhe, Dengkou, \nHangjinhouqi, Wuyuan, Wulatehouqi, Wulateqianqi , and Wulatezhongqi; and to the PIAs. The \nPIAs  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest  variation  risks  of  the  loan.  The  Borrower \nand GIMAR have assured that counterpart funding will be provided to meet the requirements of \nthe Project.

GIMAR  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  The \n30. \nsubcomponents will be implemented by various PIAs. A project management office (PMO) will \nbe  responsible  for  managing,  coordinating,  and  supervising  implementation  of  all  project \nsubcomponents.  Each  PIA  will  establish  a  project  implementation  office  to  be  directly \nresponsible for design, construction, and operation of subprojects. Based on an assessment of \nGIMAR\u2019s management expertise and its extensive experience in World Bank and other bilateral \nprojects,  GIMAR  shows  the  capability  to  implement  this  Project  and  demonstrates  strong \ncommitment for the Project.  \n \n31. \nImplementation  Period. Construction of the project facilities is expected to take place \nover 4.5 years beginning in August 2006, and project components to be completed by 30 June \n2011.  Site  preparation  for  some  heating  facilities  has  been  completed;  the  routing  of  the \ntransmission  and  distribution  pipelines  and  the  location  of  the  related  facilities  has  been \nfinalized. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n32. \nProcurement. All goods and works under the Project to be wholly or partly financed by \nADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines.  Based  on  the \nimplementation  schedule,  a  procurement  plan  was  prepared.  Civil  works  contracts  costing \n$10 million or more and each supply contract costing $1 million or more financed by ADB will be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  using  ADB\u2019s  standard \nbidding documents. Other supply contract packages costing less than $1 million will be procured \neither using national competitive bidding (NCB), or in exceptional circumstances with the prior \napproval  of  ADB,  limited  international  bidding  (LIB)  procedures.  Supply  contract  packages \ncosting  less  than  $100,000  will  be  procured  using  shopping  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts \ncosting  less  than  $10 million  will  be  procured  through  NCB.  All  locally  financed  items  will  be \nprocured using procedures acceptable to ADB.  Project design, construction supervision, quality \ncontrol,  and  contract  management  will  be  performed  in  accordance  with  national  standards \nacceptable  to  ADB  and  internationally  accepted  practices.    Bidding  documents  will  require \ndisclosure of the risks of sexually transmitted diseases in health and safety programs. Equal job \nopportunities will be accorded to men and women. The procurement plan listing the packages \nand their modes of procurement is in Appendix 6.  \n \n\n \n\n\f11 \n\nfor \n\nthe \n\ninstitutional  reform  and \n\nthe  corporate  governance \n\n33. \nConsulting Services. International and national consultants financed under the loan will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality \nand cost-based selection method with simplified technical proposal. For project implementation \nsupervision,  about  12 person-months  of  international  and  76  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services6  will be engaged to assist GIMAR and the PIAs with (i) project design and \nengineering,  (ii) procurement,  (iii) construction  supervision  related  to  equipment  and  materials \nprocured under ADB financing, (iv) project management, (v) impact monitoring and assistance to \nprepare all required reports to ADB and GIMAR.  International and national consultants will also \nbe  recruited \nimprovement \nsubcomponent,  which  includes  institutional  and  tariff  reforms,  and  corporate  governance \nimprovement  and  related  training.  About  9  person-months  of  international  consulting  services \nand  53 person-months  of  national  consulting  services  are  expected  to  be  required.  Some \nnational consultants will be engaged by the PMO and the project implementation offices for site \nsupervision  and  various  tasks  relating  to  project  implementation.  They  will  have  qualifications \nand  experience  acceptable  to  ADB.  GIMAR  was  informed  of  the  selection  procedures  of  the \nquality and cost-based selection method. \n \nDisbursement Arrangements. The loan proceeds will be withdrawn in accordance with \n34. \nADB's  standard  disbursement  procedures.  To  facilitate  disbursement  of  numerous  small \nexpenditures, GIMAR will set up an imprest account after loan effectiveness in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). Disbursements from the imprest account \nwill  be  supported  by  appropriate  withdrawal  applications  and  related  documentation.  Such \ndocumentation  will  demonstrate,  among  other  things,  that  the  goods  and/or  services  are \nproduced  in  and  procured  from  ADB  members,  and  eligible  for  ADB  financing.  The  initial \namount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  6  months  of  estimated \nexpenditures, or $5.0 million, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures procedure may \nbe  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures.  Individual  payments  to  be  reimbursed  or \nliquidated under the procedure will not exceed $200,000. \n \nAdvance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing. In January 2006, the PMO \n35. \nstarted  recruitment  of  the  implementation  consultants  and  procurement  agents  to  prepare  bid \ndocuments. In view of the advanced stage of project preparation, ADB management approved \nGIMAR\u2019s  request  for  advance  procurement  action,  which  includes  recruitment  of  consultants \nand procurement of goods and civil works, and the request for retroactive financing of eligible \nexpenditures  up  to  $12.0  million  (equivalent  to  10%  of  the  ADB  loan)  incurred  prior  to  loan \neffectiveness but not earlier than 1 June 2006, or a maximum of 12 months prior to the date of \nthe  loan  agreement,  whichever  is  later.  The  Government  was  advised  that  ADB  approval  of \nadvance  procurement  action7 and  retroactive  financing  does  not  in  any  way  commit  ADB  to \napprove  the  proposed  loan.  Contracts  proposed  for  retroactive  financing  will  be  undertaken  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  accounting,  auditing,  and  reporting \n36. \nsystems  and  procedures  for  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  the \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by ADB. Each PIA will \nmaintain separate accounts of their operations and of the Project, and submit through the PMO \nto  ADB  audited  project  accounts  and  agency  financial  statements  in  English  not  later  than \n6 months after the end of the financial year. The Government, GIMAR, and the PIAs have been \ninformed  about  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited  financial  statements  and  possible \npenalties for delays in submission. The submitted audited project accounts and agency financial \nstatements should be of acceptable quality and be prepared in accordance with internationally \n                                                 \n6  About 20 person-months of national consulting services under the implementation supervision  will be provided to \n\ndevelop benchmarks and indicators for the economic, social, and environmental impact of the Project. \n\n7   The advance action was published in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 March 2006. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\naccepted accounting standards. Financial statements with adverse opinions or disclaimers from \nauditors are considered unacceptable and cannot be submitted for this purpose. GIMAR and the \nPIAs, through the PMO, will also submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use of \nthe  loan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  and  the  performance  of  each  PIA.  The  reports  will \ninclude  (i) quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation,  and  (ii) a  project  completion \nreport  not  later  than  3  months  after  completion  of  the  project  facilities.  The  PIAs  will  engage \nauditing  firms  with  experience  and  qualifications  acceptable  to  ADB  to  carry  out  the  annual \naudits. \n \nAnticorruption Measures. ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy8 was explained to and discussed \n37. \nwith  the  PRC  Government  and  GIMAR.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  GIMAR  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants, \nand  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption  policy  will  be  included  in  all  documents  and  contracts  during  bidding  and \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  Items  financed  by  the  PIAs  with  local  currency  funds  will  be \nprocured following bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. For the Project, GIMAR will take the \nfollowing anticorruption actions: (i) involve full-time officials from the Finance Bureau of IMAR in \nthe supervision of bidding, construction, and operations; and (ii) carry out periodic inspections of \nthe contractors\u2019 activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements. \n \nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. A project performance management \n38. \nsystem  (PPMS)  was  developed  by  the  project  preparatory  TA  consultants  and  agreed  to  by \nGIMAR.  The  PPMS  includes  a  set  of  measurable  indicators  based  on  the  project  design, \nimpacts,  and  risks.  The  macroeconomic  and  sector  performance,  institutional  capacity,  and \nreforms  were  taken  into  account  in  designing  the  monitoring  indicators.  The  indicators  cover \nenvironmental impacts, and social and poverty impacts. The major indicators are presented in \nthe  design  and  monitoring  framework.  In  addition,  a  feedback  and  reporting  mechanism  for \neffective project implementation and initial startup activities, including a baseline survey based \non  a  random  household  sample  to  be  monitored  with  follow-up  surveys,  was  included  in  the \nPPMS.  Each  PIA  will  establish  an  environmental  and  resettlement  management  unit  to \ncoordinate  environmental  and  resettlement  management  issues  associated  with  the  contract \npackages, and during construction and operation. GIMAR will engage an independent domestic \nagency to monitor implementation of the resettlement plan and prepare evaluation reports. The \nimplementation  supervision  consultants  will  include  an  impact  monitoring  unit  (an independent \ndomestic agency) with 20 person-months of national consulting services to develop benchmarks \nand  indicators  for  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  impact  of  the  Project.  During \nimplementation, the implementation consultants and the impact monitoring unit will help GIMAR \nto monitor project impacts, and GIMAR and the PIAs will keep ADB informed of implementation \nprogress  with  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  resettlement  plan  through \nquarterly progress reports. Annual reports on achievement of resettlement, environmental, and \nsocial objectives will be submitted to ADB during project implementation and on completion. A \nlonger  term  monitoring  plan  after  project  completion,  including  an  effective  monitoring  and \nevaluation system, will be developed by the impact monitoring unit and implemented by GIMAR. \nThe monitoring and evaluation system will include specific and measurable targets, and identify \nimplementation \nkey  risks  and \nconsultants will also provide the necessary training on monitoring. \n\nfor  effective  monitoring.

Two  years  after  loan  effectiveness,  ADB,  GIMAR,  and  the \nPIAs  will  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative, \norganizational,  technical,  environmental,  social,  poverty  reduction,  resettlement,  economic, \nfinancial, and other relevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project \nand  its  continuing  viability.  The  review  will  examine  progress  in  sector  reforms,  and  evaluate \ndevelopment and poverty impact, and compliance with assurances in the loan agreement. The \nreview shall also undertake a comprehensive review of potential Loan savings, identify areas for \nreallocation of Loan proceeds, and change disbursement percentages, as appropriate. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nProject  preparation \n\n40. \nassessments. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nA. \n\nincluded  economic, \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nfinancial,  environmental,  and  social \n\nRisks  associated  with  the  demand  forecasts  for  the  Project  are  minimal  as  the  Project \n41. \nwill provide gas, heating, and wastewater treatment mainly to meet the existing demand and a \nsmall  share  of  incremental  demand.  The  gas  distribution  component  will  meet  only  a  small \nshare  of  the  total  incremental  demand  for  gas  in  the  project  areas.  The  city  central  heating \nsupply  component  will  replace  small  boilers  to  meet  the  existing  heating  demand  and  a  small \nportion  of  incremental  demand.  A  least-cost  analysis  was  performed  for  each  of  the  three \ncategories  of  outputs  by  the  Project,  including  (i)  utilization  of  natural  gas  for  industrial  and \nresidential  consumption,  (ii)  central heating  supply,  and  (iii) wastewater  treatment.  For  specific \nindustries and household cooking and water heating in the project areas, the analysis indicates \nthat natural gas is the least-cost option. The large-size centralized boilers proposed under the \nProject for central heating supplies are the least-cost options. For wastewater treatment plants, \nconsidering the technical infeasibility of small-scale, individually installed wastewater treatment \nequipment, and the nonexistence of sewer systems between project areas and central sewage \ntreatment plants, the analysis concluded that on-site sewage treatment plants provide the least \ncost option. \n \nfor  each  project \n42. \nsubcomponent  and  for  the  whole  Project  (Appendix  7).  As  in  the  least-cost  analysis,  the \neconomic analysis applied the conversion factors to investment cost for land,9 cost of equipment \nfuel, and operation and maintenance costs where applicable. The benefits of output were valued \nbased  on  the  cost  saving  of  alternative  fuels  and  efficiency  improvement.  The  cost-saving \nbenefits were valued as the cost differences of the supply options with and without the Project. \nA  survey  was  carried  out  to  determine  the  appropriate  supply  options  for  each  category  of \nconsumer.  Local  environmental  benefits  were  taken  into  account  in  the  EIRR  calculation.  Line \nlosses are based on the statistics of historical line-loss rates in each project area. \n \n43. \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  is  based  on  the \nbenefits transfer method. The evaluation used (i) the methodology adopted in ADB\u2019s Economic \nEvaluation of Environmental Impacts: A Workbook (1996) to determine the adjusted estimate of \nthe monetary damages caused by air pollution during the study period, taking into account the \nlocation  of  the  pollution  sources,  emission  level,  and  population  affected;  and  (ii) estimates  of \naverage annual climate change for carbon emissions to evaluate the monetary damage caused \nby  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the \n\ninternal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated \n\nThe  economic \n\n                                                 \n9  Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization). \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nwastewater  projects  is  based  on  the  criterion  of  collecting  fees  for  wastewater  in  IMAR.10 The \nEIRRs  presented  in  Table  4  include  only  the  local  environmental  benefits.  If  the  global \nenvironmental benefits are added to the project benefits, the EIRR for the whole Project would \nincrease to 22.6%. \n \nThe  summary  results  of  the  EIRR  calculation  presented  in  Table  4  reflect  all  project-\n44. \nrelated costs, the benefits from cost savings of alternative fuels and efficiency improvement, and \nlocal environmental benefits. The EIRR calculation is a conservative approach, as it takes into \naccount  only  the  main  benefits  of  different  components  but  includes  all  project-related  costs. \nThis approach yields EIRRs ranging from 10.0% to 25.9% without and 14.0% to 40.0% with the \nlocal environmental benefits for the project subcomponents. For the whole Project, the EIRR will \nbe  17.6%  without  and  21.4%  with  the  local  environmental  benefits.  Sensitivity  analyses  were \nperformed for each subcomponent. For the EIRR of the whole Project, sensitivity analyses show \nthe  EIRR  (with  local  environmental  benefits)  would  decrease  to  (i)  17.6%  if  the  Project \nexperiences a cost overrun of 20%; (ii) 12.5% if the benefits are reduced by 20%; (iii) 15.0% if \nthe  Project  experiences  a  commissioning  delay  of  1  year;  and  (iv) 6.4%  if  (i),  (ii),  and  (iii)  all \nwere to happen. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n(%) \n\n \nSubcomponent \nDengkou Central Heating Supply \nHangjinhouqi Central Heating Supply \nLinhe Central Heating Supply \nWuhai Central Heating Supply \nWulatehouqi Central Heating Supply \nWulateqianqi Central Heating Supply \nWulatezhongqiCentral Heating Supply \nWuyuan Central Heating Supply \nChang-Wu-Lin Gas Transmission \nGas Distribution and Station \nWulatehouqi Wastewater Treatment \nWulateqianqi Wastewater Treatment \nThe Whole Project \n\nEIRR without \nEnvironment Benefits \n22.1 \n12.8 \n10.0 \n11.0 \n16.5 \n17.9 \n14.3 \n15.8 \n20.4 \n15.4 \n25.9 \n12.5 \n17.6 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEIRR with Local \nEnvironment Benefits \n26.4 \n17.9 \n14.0 \n15.0 \n21.8 \n23.7 \n20.1 \n19.3 \n20.4 \n16.8 \n40.0 \n21.2 \n21.4 \n\n EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis and Projections \n\nThe natural gas component will be implemented by Inner Mongolia Western Natural Gas \n45. \nLtd, a limited liability shareholding SOE.

Two  SOEs,  Wuhai  Thermal  Power  Company,  Wulatehouqi  Water \nCompany,  currently  have  low  profitability  and  liquidity,  and  partly  rely  on  local  government \nsupport  for  their  operations.  These  enterprises  will  have  to  take  measures  to  reduce \nadministrative  costs  and  inefficiencies,  and  seek  opportunities  for  privatization.  Commercial \noperations of the gas pipeline of Inner Mongolia Western Natural Gas Ltd. only started in 2005; \nits  financial  performance  is  expected  to  be  good  based  on  its  financial  projections.  Inner \nMongolia Haosheng Thermal Company Ltd., Wulatehouqi Huibao Thermal Company Ltd., and \nWulatezhongqi  Dagong  Thermal  Company  Ltd.,  are  newly  formed  companies  to  implement \ncentral  heating  subcomponents.  ADB's  investment  and  institutional  strengthening  in  gas  and \ncentral  heating  supply  will  address  concerns  regarding  high  distribution  losses,  closure  of \ninefficient small boilers, and poor bill collection. The PIAs must pay close attention to problems \nrelating  to  productivity,  operational  inefficiencies,  and  improvement  in  bill  collection  to  ensure \nproject  sustainability.  The  local  governments  have  been  supportive  of  tariff  adjustments \nbecause of concerns for inefficient small boilers that pollute the environment, and for security of \nfuel  supply.  The  PIAs  will  implement  the  financial  reform  action  plans  developed  by  the  TA \nconsultants with the help of the consultants under component D. Regular ADB review missions \nwill closely monitor financial performance of the PIAs. \n \nThe  financial  viability  of  the  subcomponents  will  be  ensured  by  revenue  enhancement \n47. \nand cost reduction measures, including implementation of a two-part heating tariff. The financial \ninternal rates of return (FIRRs) of the subcomponents range from 6.7% to 8.4% (Table 5) and \ncompare favorably with the respective estimated weighted average costs of capital ranging from \n3.3% to 4.0% (Appendix 9). The FIRR (Table A9.2) for the whole Project is estimated at 7.7%, \nwhich also compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital for the entire Project \ncalculated  on  an  after-tax  basis  at  3.9%.  The  Project  is  considered  both  financially  viable  and \nsustainable.  Sensitivity  analysis  (Tables  A9.1  and  A9.3)  shows  that  the  FIRR  for  the  whole \nProject  would  decrease  to  (i)  6.6%  if  the  Project  experiences  a  capital  cost  overrun  of  10%, \n(ii) 6.7%  with  a  10%  operating  cost  overrun,  (iii)  5.2%  if  the  benefits  are  reduced  by  10%, \n(iv) 7.3%  if  the  Project  experiences  a  commissioning  delay  of  1  year,  and  (v)  2.9%  if  all  four \nhappen. \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Financial Internal Rates of Return and \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital  \n(%) \n\nSubcomponent \nDengkou Central Heating Supply  \nHangjinhouqi Heating Supply \nLinhe Central Heating Supply \nWuhai Central Heating Supply \nWulatehouqi Heating Supply \nWulateqianqi Heating Supply \nWulatezhongqi Heating Supply \nWuyuan Heating Supply \nChang-Wu-Lin Gas Transmission \nGas Distribution and Station \nWulatehouqi Wastewater Treatment \nWulateqianqi Wastewater Treatment \nThe Overall Project \n\nFIRR \n6.7 \n7.3 \n7.1 \n8.4 \n8.2 \n7.6 \n7.5 \n7.6 \n7.9 \n7.9 \n6.7 \n7.3 \n7.7 \n\nWACC \n4.0 \n3.6 \n4.0 \n4.4 \n4.0 \n4.0 \n3.5 \n4.0 \n3.7 \n3.6 \n4.0 \n3.3 \n3.9 \n\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n16 \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Benefits and Impacts \n\n48. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B  (sensitive).  The  methodology  and \nresults of quantifying project environmental benefits are presented in Appendix 10. The Project \nhas substantial environmental benefits resulting from energy efficiency improvements, reduction \nin emissions from coal burning, and reduction of pollutant discharge into the Yellow River and \nWuliangsuhai  Lake.  Potential  adverse  impacts  assessed  during  project  preparation  are \ntemporary  and  localized  during  construction.  According  to  the  EMP,  the  PIAs  will  implement \nprudent construction management practices to minimize any construction impacts. The PIAs will \nbe  responsible  for  environmental  management  during  project  operation.  The  ADB  review \nmissions and the project implementation consultants will monitor and ensure implementation of \nthese mitigating measures to minimize impacts during construction. \n \nProvincial and local environmental protection bureaus are expanding public information \n49. \nprograms,  mainly  via  websites,  newspapers,  television,  and  radio.11 Improved  environmental \ndisclosure  is  expected  to  facilitate  environmental  management  measures  included  in  the \nProject.  In  principle,  ADB  supports  the  expanded  public  information  programs,  including  the \nenvironmental performance rating pilot project tested in Nanjing and other PRC areas during the \npast 3 years. Local environmental protection bureaus in IMAR will expand their public disclosure \nactivities.  GIMAR  will  ensure  that  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  project  facilities  will  be  minimized  by  implementing  the \nmitigation  measures  as  identified  in  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  and  summary \nIEE.12 The  EMP  prepared  by  GIMAR  is  summarized  in  the IEE;  it  covers  all  phases  of  project \nimplementation from construction to operation. \n \nThe IEE concludes that the Project will provide significant benefits for the environment in \n50. \nthe project area. Regional air quality will improve with closure of small coal-fired boilers, more \nefficient  gas  distribution  systems,  and  reduction  in  coal  use  because  of  more  efficient  boilers. \nThe  environmental  benefits  from  the  Project  include  annual  coal  savings  of  540,000  t,  and  an \nannual emission reduction of total suspended particulates of 19,136 t, SO2 of 15,105 t, NOx of \n2,272  t,  and  greenhouse  gas  of  CO2  equivalent  of  787,243  t.  The  wastewater  treatment \ncomponent  will  lead  to  annual  discharge  reduction  of  14,126  t  of  chemical  oxygen  demand, \n5,738 t of biological oxygen demand, 7,600 t of suspended solids, 898 t of ammonia nitrogen, \n1,234 t of total nitrogen, and 88 t of total phosphorus. Water and soil pollution will be indirectly \nreduced due to lower rates of pollutant transfer from air to water, with reduced stress on local \necosystems. The quantifiable local environmental benefits over the project life are expected to \nbe about CNY52.2 million in net present value at 2004 prices. The global environmental benefits \nof  greenhouse  gas  reduction  (CO2)  are  expected  to  be  about  CNY43 million  in  net  present \nvalues  at  2004  prices.  Unquantifiable  environmental  benefits,  such  as  damage  from  the \nwastewater  of  small  boilers  and  leaking  gas,  are  also  significant.  The  subcomponents  will \ncontribute to the water pollution control for the Yellow River and Wuliangsuhai Lake. \n \nD. \n\nSocial Benefits and Poverty Reduction \n\n51. \nADB  commissioned  a  social  and  poverty  impact  assessment  that  included  field \ninterviews  of  the  poor.  Consultations  were  also  held  to  gain  an  understanding  of  gender \ndifferences  in  the  consumption  pattern,  needs,  and  priorities.  During  preparation  of  the \nassessment,  various  participatory  techniques,  such  as  household  interviews,  focus  group \n\n                                                 \n11 The  State  Environmental  Protection  Agency  has  directed  all  areas  to  begin  public  awareness  and  disclosure \nprograms by the end of 2004. Most areas in the PRC have mature public awareness programs; many have already \ninitiated some type of expanded environmental information disclosure program. \n\n12 ADB. 2006. Summary Initial Environmental Examination of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Environmental \n\nImprovement Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\ndiscussions,  socioeconomic  survey  of  households,  meetings  with  enterprises,  and  site \nreconnaissance,  were  used. 13 Many  government  organizations  were  consulted  as  well.  The \npoverty  impacts  of  the  Project  are  assessed  by  evaluating  the  expected  distribution  of  net \neconomic  benefits  to  different  groups.  A  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy, \npresented  in  Appendix  11,  summarizes  measures  to  mitigate  and  enhance  the  impacts  of  the \nProject for the poor population. The approach only takes the direct project benefits into account \nin assessing poverty impact. The direct project benefits include (i) lower gas and heating tariffs \ndue to more efficient supply, (ii) environmental benefits, and (iii) job creation associated with the \nProject. \n \n52. \nAn  impact  assessment  for  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB's policy on indigenous peoples.14 The assessment indicates that most of \nthe affected minorities are Mongolians. The people of Mongolian origin are equal with the Hans \nin  land  distribution,  children\u2019s  education,  and  politics  where  the  two  groups  live  together. \nMongolians  have  their  own  special  customs  in  religion,  festivals,  and  house  styles.  The  two \nethnic groups have lived together peacefully for a long time. The social survey shows almost no \ndifference in income level between Mongolians and Hans who are affected by the Project (net \nincome per capita of Han and Mongolian nationality is CNY3,300 and CNY3,200, respectively). \n \n53. \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  an  urban  population  of  about  2.2 million  in  the  eight \nproject beneficiary areas. Among these people, 0.96 million urban residents will benefit from the \nnatural gas and central heating supply with the Project. An estimated 71,324 or 7.5% of the total \nurban beneficiaries are poor as measured by the various city poverty lines. The increased use \nof gas and better central heating supplies will reduce the use of conventional fuels such as raw \ncoal, wood, and coal briquettes to mitigate environmental and health impacts, particularly on the \npoor.  \n \n54. \nThe  Project  will  create  about  10,240  person-years  of  employment  opportunities  during \nconstruction  and  1,412  full-time  jobs  during  operation.  Of  the  total,  4,090  person-years  of \nemployment  opportunities  will  be  filled  by  the  poor,  women,  and  minorities,  with  an  estimated \ntotal  of  CNY44.2  million \nIn  addition, \n565 employment  opportunities  with  CNY6.1  million  of  annual  wage  payments  are  expected  to \ngo  to  the  poor,  women,  and  minorities  during  project  operation.  Local  procurement  of  the \nmaterials  required  for  the  Project  is  expected  to  create  additional  jobs.  The  improved  urban \nenvironment  should  enhance  the  local  investment  climate  to  attract  more  investment  to  the \nregion and act as a catalyst for future development. \n \nThe improvement of air quality will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of air-related \n55. \ndiseases and associated medical costs, loss of working days, as well as human suffering in the \nproject  beneficiary  areas.  The  poor,  elderly,  children,  and  women,  who  have  less  coping \nresources and are more vulnerable, will benefit greatly from the replacement of domestic use of \ncoal  and  wood  with  gas  and  central  heating.  The  wastewater  treatment  programs  in \nWulateqianqi  and  Wulatehouqi  will  reduce  wastewater  pollution  and  result  in  improved  living \nconditions and socioeconomic environment in the two areas. A benefit distribution and poverty \nimpact ratio analysis computed the poverty impact ratio of the Project (Appendix 12). The share \nof net project economic benefits directly accruing to the poor is estimated at 13.5%. Since the \npoverty impact ratio is substantially higher than the ratio of poverty population to total population \nin the project areas (7.5%), the Project is considered to be pro-poor. \n \n \n\nin  wage  payments  during  project  construction. \n\n                                                 \n13  A stratified random sampling based on income for 600 beneficiary households was conducted. \n14  ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n18 \n\nE. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n56. \nPermanent  land  acquisition  for  the  Project  includes  10.2  ha  for  gas  transportation \nsubcomponents,  33.36  ha  for  central  heating  subcomponents,  and  7.69  ha  for  wastewater \ntreatment  subcomponents.  The  other  subcomponents  will  result  in  a  temporary  disturbance  to \nroads,  and  thus  require  compensation  payments  to  government  agencies  for  necessary \narrangements and support during project implementation. A total of 133 farmers will be affected \nby  permanent \nland  acquisition:  20  by  gas  subcomponents,  102  by  central  heating \nsubcomponents, and 11 by wastewater treatment subcomponents. An additional 175 people are \nestimated to be affected by temporary land occupation for an average of 90 days during project \nimplementation.  A  socioeconomic  survey  of  all affected  households  was  conducted  in \nSeptember 2005. The impacts are minor and all those affected will receive cash compensation. \nTo mitigate the impacts, compensation standards and a rehabilitation plan are proposed in the \nresettlement  plan.  A  resettlement  information  booklet  will  be  distributed  to  all  affected \nhouseholds.  A  summary  of  the  resettlement  plan  is  presented  in  Appendix  13.  GIMAR,  the \nPMO, and the PIAs will ensure that all those affected are compensated in a timely manner and \nresettled  in  accordance  with  the  plan.  The  PIAs  will  have  additional  consultations  with  those \naffected  during  project  implementation.  The  estimated  budget  for  resettlement  compensation \nand  rehabilitation  is  CNY26.95  million.  GIMAR  and  the  PIAs  will  ensure  that  all  784  workers \naffected by the closure of the small coal-fired boilers are reemployed in a timely manner and in \naccordance with the reemployment action plan prepared by the PIAs. \n \nF. \n\nAssessment of Project Risks \n\n57. \nA  demand  analysis  was  conducted  to  ensure  sufficient  demand  for  the  gas,  central \nheating,  and  water  supplies  generated  by  the  Project.  The  risk  of  insufficient  demand  for  the \nProject  is  minimal.  The  heating  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  and  gas  transmission  and \ndistribution  improvement  are  to  meet  the  existing  demand  and  a  small  fraction  of  incremental \ndemand  in  the  project  areas.  The  Project  does  not  require  a  higher  gas  tariff  as  the  current \nalternatives  (mainly  liquefied  petroleum  gas)  have  higher  prices.  The  average  heating  tariff  of \nCNY15/m2  in  IMAR  reflects  economic  supply  cost  and  is  expected  to  increase  mildly  due  to \nhigher  coal  prices.  The  expected  improvement  in  facility  efficiency  by  about  22%  and  billing \ncollection  to  95%  under  the  Project  will  improve  the  PIAs\u2019  financial  performance  without \nimmediate heating tariff adjustments. Strong economic performance is expected in IMAR, based \non the PRC\u2019s emphasis on the economic development of western regions and its large energy \nreserve. \n \nThe gas transmission and distribution, central heating supply systems, and wastewater \n58. \ntreatment  under  the  Project  are  based  on  proven  designs  and  conventional  technologies  that \nhave  been  used  successfully  in  the  PRC.  No  significant  technical  risks  are  anticipated. \nPrecautions will be taken to minimize potential risks during project construction and operation. \nThe  risk  of  delay  to  loan  effectiveness  and  construction  due  to  late  internal  approvals  and \nprocurement \nfor  all \nsubcomponents  in  April  2006,  starting  recruitment  of  implementation  consultants  in  January \n2006,  early  preparation  of  bid  documents  in  June  2006,  and  procurement  training  for  all  the \nPIAs  in  July  2006.  The  chance  of  large  project  cost  savings  will  be  minimal  because  of  the \nrecent upward trend in the prices of construction materials and a prudent cost estimate. GIMAR \nwill mitigate the risk of inadequate project management by setting up the PMO with experienced \nprofessional  staff  who  have  had  previous  experience  in  design,  construction  supervision,  and \nprocurement. International and national consultants will also provide assistance in these areas. \nIn addition, all of the PIAs will be subject to good governance supervision under the PPMS. \n \n\nis  being  addressed  by  GIMAR\u2019s  approval  of \n\nfeasibility  reports \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\n59. \nTo  fully  assess  the  potential  project  risks,  a  probabilistic  risk  analysis  was  performed \nusing the Monte Carlo simulation technique based on 3,000 simulations for both the EIRR and \nFIRR analyses.15 The crucial risk variables were selected because of their significant impact on \nthe  Project\u2019s  economic  and  financial  viability.  The  results  indicate  that  the  expected  EIRR, \nbased  on  the  weighted  average  of  all  simulated  combinations,  is  17.8%  or  about  3.6%  lower \nthan  the  base-case  value,  without  consideration  of  project  risks.  The  probability  of  the  EIRR \nfalling below the cut-off rate of 12% is 7%. The economic risk is very low because the Project \nrelies on existing demand, and benefits from efficiency improvements. The results indicate that \nthe expected FIRR is 6.9%, about 0.8% lower than the base-case value, without consideration \nof project risks. The probability of the FIRR falling below the weighted average costs of capital \nfor the Project of 3.9% is 11%. \n \n60. \nPoverty is associated with vulnerability. The dimension of risk in poverty assessment is \nof  significance  since  the  poor  are  the  most  vulnerable  to  unexpected  unfavorable  events.  The \nexpected  poverty  impact  ratio  is  12.9%,  0.6%  lower  than  the  base-case  value,  without \nconsideration of project risks, and still higher than the share of the poor in the project area. Even \nwith  pessimistic  assumptions,  the  probability  of  a  negative  outcome  for  the  poor  is  4.3%.  The \nrisk analysis of the poverty impact ratio calculation, together with the analysis of the probability \nof overall project failure (risk analysis of the EIRRs and FIRRs), concludes that the probability of \nnegative outcomes for the poor is minimal. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  GIMAR  have  given  the \n\n61. \nfollowing assurances, which are included in the legal documents: \n \n\nClosure  of  small  coal-fired  heat  boilers.  GIMAR  will  ensure  that  the  PIAs \ncomplete  the  closure  of  396  small  coal-fired  heat  boilers  in  the  project  areas  in \nIMAR  by  31  December  2009.  GIMAR  and  the  PIAs  will  ensure  that  all \n784 workers affected by the closure of the small coal-fired heat boilers under the \nProject  are  reemployed  in  a  timely  manner  and  in  accordance  with  the \nreemployment action plan so that they will be at least as well off as they would \nhave been in the absence of the Project. \n\nImplementation  of  heating  tariff  reforms.  GIMAR  will  cause  the  PIAs  to \nprogressively  implement,  at  the  city  level,  key  heating  tariff  reforms  including \n(a) installation of lock valves in individual apartment units in buildings to improve \ntariff  collection;  (b)  installation  of  radiator  control  valves  in  apartment  units  in \nbuildings  to  encourage  heat  conservation;  (c)  implementation  of  a  two-part \nheating  tariff  structure  that  the  variable  charge  shall  be  based  on  heat \nconsumption; the overall heating tariff level should be cost-reflective and promote \neconomic  efficiency;  (d)  installation  of  heat  measuring  devices,  at  apartment \nlevel,  to  support  consumption-based  billing  systems;  and  (e)  conversion  from \nenterprise-based tariff payment system to individual-based payment system. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nHeating assistance to the poor. GIMAR will ensure the PIAs will implement the \npro-poor programs that provide heating tariff discounts to the poor based on the \n\n                                                 \n15 The simulation was carried out using Risk Master computer software. Monte Carlo simulation works by generating \na series of random numbers following the distribution of probability of each risk variable. For each simulation, which \nrepresents  a  combination  of  different  states  of  risk  variables,  the  EIRRs  and  FIRRs  and  poverty  impact  ratio  are \ncalculated and recorded. The results of 3,000 simulations are averaged. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\n \n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\ncost savings from efficiency improvement under the Project. GIMAR will ensure \nthe project areas will establish government-funded heating assistance programs \nto  assist  the  poor  and  those  with  incomes  marginally  higher  than  the  poverty \nlevel to pay heating bills. \n\nGas,  heating,  and  water  supply  agreements.    GIMAR  will  cause  the  PIAs  to \nsign and execute long-term gas, heating and water supply agreements with large \nprospective customers to ensure the demand of the gas and heating services. \n\nFinancial performance of the PIAs. In each fiscal year commencing from fiscal \nyear 2007, the PIAs will be expected to maintain a debt-service coverage ratio of \nat  least  1.4  times;  and  a  current  ratio  of  more  than  1:1  by  2010  and  thereafter, \nand a debt-equity ratio of not more than 70:30. \n\nChange  in  ownership  and  operation.  In  the  event  (a)  of  any  change  in \nownership  of  the  Project  facilities  or  (b)  any  sale,  transfer  or  assignment  of \nshares or interest or other change of control in any PIA is anticipated, the PIAs, \nthrough  GIMAR,  will  consult  with  ADB  at  least  six  months  prior  to  the \nimplementation of such change. Such change will be carried out in a lawful and \ntransparent matter. \n\nInstitutional strengthening. GIMAR will ensure that the PIAs will implement, in \naccordance  with  the  implementation  plan  agreed  upon  between  GIMAR  and \nADB, \ninstitutional \nstrengthening made by the consultants under component D of the Project.  \n\nthe  agreed  upon  recommendations \n\nfinancial  and \n\nfor \n\n \n(viii)  Environment. GIMAR and the PIAs will ensure that the Project is constructed in \naccordance with national and local government environmental laws, regulations, \nprocedures,  and  guidelines,  as  well  as  the  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  environment,16 and \nthe environmental impact assessment. GIMAR and the PIAs will ensure that any \nadverse environmental impacts arising from the construction and operation of the \nproject facilities will be minimized by implementing the mitigation measures in the \nEMP  and  the  environmental  monitoring  plan.  Environmental  monitoring  reports \nwill  be  submitted  to  ADB  twice  annually  for  2  years  during  the  implementation \nperiod.  The  EMP  (mitigation  measures,  monitoring  plan,  and  institutional \narrangements)  will  be  updated  during  the  engineering  design  stage,  and  be \nincorporated in the bidding documents and civil works contracts. \n\nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement.  GIMAR  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition \nand  resettlement  are  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently \nthe \nresettlement plan agreed with ADB, in line with applicable laws and ADB\u2019s policy \non  involuntary  resettlement. 17  GIMAR  will  ensure  that  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan is monitored and evaluated and reported to ADB as required in \nthe plan. \n\nfollowing \n\nMonitoring  and  evaluation.  GIMAR  will  monitor  and  evaluate  project  impacts, \nwith the assistance of consultants, as specified in the PPMS, to ensure that the \nproject facilities are managed effectively and the benefits, particularly to the poor, \nare maximized. GIMAR will (i) engage consultants for monitoring and evaluation \nby  December  2006;  (ii)  facilitate  the  data  collection  from  local  governments, \n\n  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2002.

Estimates of economic losses caused by pollution range from 3.5% to 8.3% of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP).  Pollution  in  the  early  1990s  resulted  in  annual  economic  losses  of \nCNY99 billion  (about  4%  of  GDP  at  the  time),  with  air  pollution  accounting  for  59%,  water \npollution 36%, and solid waste 5%.1 The high economic losses reflect waste and inefficiency in \nthe  utilization  of  energy,  raw  materials,  and  water  resources  in  the  production  of  goods  and \nservices.  This  is  partly  a  legacy  of  the  past  practice  of  locating  industrial  enterprises  in  urban \ncenters,  inappropriate  regulatory  measures,  and  pricing  policies  that  did  not  provide  adequate \nincentives for conservation and environment-friendly behavior. With rapid economic growth, the \nuse  of  energy,  raw  materials,  and  water  will  continue  to  increase.  Without  introducing  better \ntechnology, encouraging use of cleaner fuels, and increasing use of renewable energy, air and \nwater  quality  will  deteriorate  and  related  economic  losses  will  increase.  The  PRC's  heavy \nreliance on coal as its primary fuel for industrial production, power generation, and commercial \nand residential applications\u2014mainly heating and cooking, contributes significantly to emissions \nof  sulfur  dioxide  (SO2)  and  total  suspended  particulates  (TSP),  and  high  levels  of  urban  air \npollution.  Air  and  water  quality  is  poor  in  most  of  the  PRC\u2019s  industrial  areas.  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region (IMAR) has air and water pollution problems due to heavy reliance on coal \nas the primary fuel for industries and residential consumption. Most urban heating is provided by \nsmall, inefficient, coal-fired heating boilers. These small boilers typically are not equipped with \nadequate  pollution  control  devices,  and  are  the  major  sources  of  air  pollution  in  urban  areas. \nSupplementary Appendix A provides additional information. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer with 2004 production of 1,950 million tons \n(t) of raw coal accounting for 34% of the world\u2019s total coal production. Coal provides more than \n75% of the energy for power generation, 65% of chemical raw materials, and more than 50% of \ncommercial  and  civilian  energy.  Coal  accounts  for  95%  of  the  nation\u2019s  primary  fossil  energy \nresources.  Coal  will  continue  to  be  the  primary  energy  fuel  for  the  PRC,  partly  because  of \nincreasing  thermal  power  capacity.  Coal  production  was  1,400 million t  in  1996.  Gradually,  as \nenergy efficiency improved and other sources of energy developed, coal production declined to \n1,000 million t  in  2000. However  it  has  been  rapidly  increasing  since  2001.  Coal  production  in \nIMAR  totaled  72.5 million t  in  2000,  and  increased  to  203.3  million t  in  2004.  IMAR  has  over \n1,258 active coal mines. State-owned coal mines account for 65% of coal production capacity. \n \nC. \n\nCoal Subsector \n\nGas Utilization \n\n3. \nIn the PRC, three types of gas are distributed: manufactured town gas, natural gas, and \nliquefied petroleum gas. The development of the natural gas industry and city gas utilization has \nbeen rapid in recent years. In 2004, the reserve of natural gas was estimated at 47,000 billion \ncubic  meters  (m3).  The  proven  reserve  was  4,900  billion  m3,  and  recoverable  reserve \n2,200 billion  m3.  Natural  gas  production  and  consumption  were  40.8  billion  m3 and  41.5  billion \nm3 respectively in 2004, which accounted for only about 3% of total primary energy production \n\n                                                 \n1  Based  on  a  study  by  the  Policy  Research  Center  for  Environment  and  Economy  of  the  State  Environmental \n\nProtection Administration. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nand consumption in the PRC. Natural gas consumption in the PRC was substantially lower than \nthe  average  level  of  24.7%  in  the  world  in  2004.  Most  of  the  existing  gas  distribution  systems \nare  owned  and  operated  by  municipal  gas  companies  controlled  by  city  governments,  and \nsupervised  by  the  national  Ministry  of  Construction.  Gas  prices  for  end-use  consumers  were \nsubsidized as a basic human need under the centrally planned system, but have recently been \nadjusted  nearer  to  market  prices.  IMAR  has  994 kilometers  (km)  of  town  gas  distribution \npipelines and 464 km of natural gas distribution pipelines. The most important end uses for gas \nare  cooking,  water  heating,  and  to  a  lesser  degree,  space  heating.  The  average  gas  price  in \nIMAR,  about  CNY1.50/cubic  meter  (m3)  (heat  value  of  5,000  kilocalorie/m3),  is  comparable  to \nthe average of CNY2.10/m3 (heat value of 8,000 kilocalorie/m3) for other provinces in the PRC. \nThe growing demand for city gas has been outpacing supply. \n \nD. \n\nUrban Heating \n\n4. \nUrban heating demand in the PRC has grown rapidly due to rising incomes, privatization \nof  housing,  and  housing  sector  growth.  In  heated  areas,  demand  increased  by  an  annual \naverage rate of 19.4% from 1996 to 2004. Urban heating demand grew rapidly during the past \ndecade  because  of  economic  and  housing  growth,  and  housing  reforms  that  promote  private \nownership. The total heated area of buildings in the PRC was only 734.3 million square meters \n(m2)  in  1996,  but  increased  to  2,166.6 million  m2  in  2004.  Residential  buildings  account  for \nabout 70% of the total space heating demand, and commercial and public buildings account for \nthe remaining 30%. Only about 35% of total residential buildings were served by combined heat \nand  power  generation  and/or  urban  central  heating  supply.  The  market  penetration  of  central \nheating is relatively low, compared to the 55% to 60% range in developed European countries \nsuch as Denmark and Finland. About 500,000 small coal-fired heating boilers still operate in the \nPRC.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  promotes  urban  central  heating  supply  systems  using  heat \nsupplied from efficient, large, combined heat and power generation plants and/or large heating \nboilers.  Similar  to  the  national  trend,  heating  demand  in  IMAR  grew  rapidly  during  the  past \n10 years.  The  total  heated  space  grew  at  18.7% per  year,  increasing  from  32.18 million  m2  in \n1996  to  92.15 million  m2  in  2004.  IMAR\u2019s  current  average  heating  tariff  of  CNY15/m2 is  lower \nthan  the  CNY19.5 /m2  in  Xinjiang,  CNY20/m2  in  Heilongjiang,  and  CNY24/m2  in  Beijing,  but \nreflects IMAR supply cost. \n \nE. \n \nIn  2004,  municipal  sources  generated  65%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  estimated  46  billion  m3  of \n5. \nwastewater;  the  industry  sector  generated  35%  of  the  total.  As  the  development  of  municipal \nwastewater  treatment  is  still  in  the  early  stages,  only  40%  is  treated.  The  rest  is  discharged \nuntreated into rivers and lakes. Although about 90% of industrial wastewater is treated, much of \nit is only pretreated to a low effluent standard before discharge into a municipal sewer and to the \nnearest  body  of  water.  Municipal  and  industrial  wastewaters  are  the  major  contributors  to \npollution  of  IMAR\u2019s  rivers  and  lakes,  affecting  downstream  water  quality.  IMAR  generated \n0.75 billion  m3  of  wastewater  in  2004,  31%  of  which  were  generated  from  industrial  sources. \nSimilar to the PRC\u2019s overall situation, only 44% of the total wastewater is treated in IMAR. The \nrest  is  discharged  untreated  into  the  Yellow  River  and  Wuliangsu  Lake.  Wulateqianqi  and \nWulatehouqi  have  no  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  and  discharge  about  86,000  m3/day  of \nwastewater.  Recent  regulations  issued  by  the  local  governments  restrict  discharge  of \nwastewater to the Yellow River. \n \n \n\nWastewater Treatment \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE AND LESSONS LEARNED \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n \nA. \n \nExternal  sources,  including  foreign  direct  investment,  are  increasingly  being  promoted \n1. \nand  now  finance  about  20%  of  total  annual  investment  in  the  energy  sector  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), mainly in the power sector. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \napproved about $3.4 billion to the PRC energy sector to finance 27 projects in the public sector, \nand 2 private sector power projects. Of the power projects, thermal power projects account for \n41% in terms of loan amount, with hydropower projects accounting for about 36%, followed by \ntransmission  and  distribution  (about  17%),  and  renewable  energy  (about  6%).  ADB  has  also \nprovided  100  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  for  the  energy  sector  for  about  $50 million  to \nhelp prepare projects, provide policy advice, and build institutional capabilities of power utilities \nthat  are  the  executing  agencies  of  ADB  loans.  ADB  has  extended  nine  loans  amounting  to \n$1.5 billion for urban environmental improvement projects in the PRC, including district heating \ndistribution,  and  combined  heat  and  power  cogeneration  plants.  Four  projects  have  been \ncompleted and are in commercial operation resulting in improved overall ambient air quality in \nthe assisted areas. \n \nADB  is  providing  TA  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  reform  of  heating  tariffs.1 The  TA\u2019s \n2. \nobjective  is  to  help  the  Government  reform  the  urban  heating  sector  and  promote  sustainable \nurban  heating  supply  in  the  PRC  by  (i) formulating  pro-poor  national  heating  tariff  guidelines, \nand (ii) establishing an effective heating tariff collection mechanism. The World Bank is also an \nimportant  source  of  external  funding  for  urban  district  heating.  Since  the  early  1990s,  it  has \nprovided  over  $600 million  to  finance  environment  improvement  projects.  The  central  heating \nsystem  components  of  these  projects  helped  reduce  polluting  emissions  from  small  inefficient \ncoal-fired  heating  boilers.  In  recent  years,  the  World  Bank  has  provided  TA  to  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s heating sector reforms. \n \n3. \nAmong  bilateral  sources,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  is  the \nlargest source of external assistance for the PRC\u2019s power sector. It has provided concessional \nloans  totaling  CNY438  billion  ($3.6  billion  at  the  current  exchange  rate)  for  14 power  sector \nprojects  through  its  official  development  assistance  window.  JBIC  has  also  provided  special \ncredits  to  major  areas  to  improve  their  environment  by  installing  emission  control  devices  and \nequipment in power plants and factories, and through building water treatment facilities. JBIC is \nconsidering shifting its traditional focus of assistance in the power sector from hydropower and \nthermal  power  generation  to  energy  conservation  and  renewable  energy,  particularly  in  the \nwestern  region.  German  development  cooperation,  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau \n(KfW),  has  provided  approximately  $400 million  in  mixed  credits,  mostly  for  power  plants  and \nturbine  modernization  projects.  KfW  also  supported  the  Government  in  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable energy development. Other bilateral sources providing export credits or mixed credits \nin the energy sector include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, \nand United States. \n \nADB  has  established  a  working  relationship  with  the  World  Bank  in  addressing  policy \n4. \nissues and coordinating lending and TA operations, and exchanges views with bilateral sources \nand the private sector. Both ADB and the World Bank emphasize the importance of improving \nthe management of power utilities, tariff reform, energy efficiency improvement,  environmental \nprotection,  and  a  greater  role  for  the  private  sector.  During  the  processing  of  the  Project, \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2000.

For \n\ndiscussions  were  held  with  the  World  Bank,  JBIC,  and  KfW  to  ensure  that  their  respective \nactivities  are  complementary  and  to  maintain  consistency  in  policy  advice.  Some  additional \ninformation is presented in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nADB\u2019s overall experience with energy and environment sector projects in the PRC has \nbeen  positive.  Projects  are  generally  well  designed  and  smoothly  implemented,  although \nsubstantial  difficulties  have  emerged  in  some  projects.  Success  is  attributed  to  extensive \npreparation  prior  to  ADB  intervention,  high  degree  of  local  ownership,  effective  leadership  in \nproject  management  offices,  timely  policy  and  enterprise  reforms,  and  fortunate  market \nconditions. Delays in mobilizing counterpart funds are not uncommon, but in most cases have \nnot resulted in unsatisfactory performance. \n \n6. \nSome  problems  in  energy  projects  have  arisen  from  inappropriate  policies  on  energy \npricing,  especially  coal  versus  natural  gas  (and  urban  heating),  and  enforcement  of \nthe  Xi\u2019an-Xianyang-Tongchuan  \nenvironmental  protection \nEnvironment Improvement Project, in general, was successfully implemented, but experienced \nthe  cancellation  of  two  cogeneration  subprojects  due  to  fuel  pricing  considerations,  i.e.,  while \nnatural  gas  was  the  environmentally  favored  alternative,  existing  gas  pricing  would  have \nrequired subsidies of 30\u201350% to achieve a positive financial internal rate of return.2 \n \n7. \nPersistent  regulatory  loopholes  and  weak  enforcement  of  key  provisions  pose  some \nproject risk: emissions fees for sulfur dioxide and other waste gas emissions are still set below \nthe  marginal  cost  of  abatement,  making  it  cheaper  for  large  coal-fired  power  plants  and \nsynthetic  gas  producers  to  pay  the  pollution  discharge  fees  than  to  implement  desulfurization \nmethods. Waste coal power plants are given some regulatory exemption from stack emissions \nstandards,  based  on  the  comprehensive  reutilization  principle.  Sustained  enforcement  of  total \nemissions quotas on a provincial and air-shed basis was at least partially successful in the late \n1990s, but construction and operation of large  coal-fired power plants in the project area may \njeopardize the long-range emissions control plan. \n \nOngoing  market  reforms  in  gas  and  heating  subsectors  pose  uncertainties  in  financial \n8. \nviability  of  project  enterprises,  particularly  state-owned  enterprises  in  the  early  stages  of \ncorporatization  and  commercialization.  Ongoing  environmental  improvement  projects3 illustrate \nthat  market  reforms  and  material  price  volatility  can  outpace  project  implementation  with  two \nextreme outcomes: (i) they may constrain enterprise profitability, or (ii) enterprise mergers and \nacquisitions  may  accelerate  management  and  ownership  reforms  to  the  point  that  external \nsupport  is  not  critical.  A  recent  completed  project  performance  audit  report  of  a  similar \nenvironmental  project,  the  Tangshan  and  Chengde  Environmental  Improvement  Project, \nidentified  several  important  lessons  including  choosing  suitable  (not  the  most  advanced) \ntechnology, integrated environmental and financial impacts, and emphasis on implementation.4 \n                                                 \n2   ADB.  1997.

Willingness-to-pay analysis indicates \nthat consumers are willing to pay substantially higher prices for water, and to a certain extent, \nare  willing  to  pay  for  wastewater  treatment.  Under  the  Anhui  Environmental  Improvement \nProject, tariffs were increased to levels commensurate with full cost recovery of operation and \nmaintenance costs.5 Capital costs were also being partially recovered through connection fees. \nUnder  the  Fuzhou  Water  Supply  and  Wastewater  Treatment  Project,  loan  covenants  require \nwastewater  tariffs  to  be  increased  to  cover  all  operation  and  maintenance  and  financial  costs \nassociated  with  treating  wastewater.6 Lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  post  evaluation  experience \nin  wastewater,  water  supply,  and  water  resources  management  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region \nindicate  that  both  supply  and  demand-side  concerns  must  be  integrated  into  project  design. \nEncouraging  broad  reforms  such as  commercial  management  and  introducing  competition  will \npromote efficient and responsive delivery of water supply and wastewater services. Appropriate \npricing  policies  for  water  and  sanitation  services  are  also  required.  Therefore,  in  particular, \nissues  related  to  tariff  levels,  cost  recovery,  and  commercialization  of  water  utilities  were \ncarefully addressed during project preparation. \n \n10. \nThese lessons were taken into account in project design and preparation. During project \npreparation,  lessons  of  experience  were  addressed  by  (i)  thoroughly  evaluating  the  technical \ndesigns  and  technologies;  (ii)  ensuring  an  adequate  debt-equity  ratio  for  the  implementing \nagencies; (iii) undertaking rigorous sensitivity analysis of cash flows, and financial and economic \nanalysis; (iv) incorporating institutional strengthening measures to improve the level of corporate \ngovernance;  and  (v)  securing  autonomy  in  operations  and  for  procurement  decisions  by  the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  project  management  office  was  given  proper  trainings  in \nprocurement  and  project  administration.  Institutional  strengthening  of  the  project  implementing \nagencies  will  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  loan-funded  investments.  Coordination  with  the \nWorld Bank and JBIC is active and ongoing, eliminating any overlap in assistance. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  1996.

\n\nAppendix 7 \n\n37 \n\n \nA. \n\nDemand Forecast \n\nPROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nA  demand  forecast  for  each  project  component  was  carried  out  by  the  Government  of \n1. \nInner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region  with  assistance  from  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  (TA)  consultants.  The  demand  forecasts  concluded  that  the  risk  associated  with \ndemand forecast is minimal (Supplementary Appendix K) because the Project will provide gas, \nheating  and  water  supply  to  meet  the  existing  demand  and  a  small  share  of  incremental \ndemand in the project areas. The Project will supply natural gas to replace liquefied petroleum \ngas  (LPG)  and  coal  for  residential  use  (cooking  and  water  heating),  and  a  small  portion  of \nindustrial  consumption.  The  urban  central  heating  supply  will  replace  the  existing  small \ninefficient  boilers.  Water  is  in  short  supply  in  project  areas  and  the  demand  for  treated  water \nunder  the  Project  is  larger  than  supply.  The  risks  associated  with  the  demand  forecast  in  the \neconomic and financial viability analyses are minimal. \n \nB. \n\nLeast Cost Analysis \n\ntreatment.  All \n\n(iii)  wastewater \n\n(ii)  central  heating  supply,  and \n\n2. \nA least-cost analysis was performed for the three categories of end use to be served by \nthe  Project,  including  (i)  natural  gas  for  industrial  use  and  for  household  cooking  and  water \nthe  project \nheating, \nsubcomponents are parts of their area development master plans. The least cost analysis used \n2004  constant  prices  and  a  discount  rate  of  12%.  Tradable  commodities  were  valued  at  border \nprices at the prevailing exchange rate (CNY8.11/$1.0). Non-tradable commodities were valued at \nshadow prices, using a mix of standard and specific conversion factors.1 The current alternatives \n(mainly LPG and coal) for some industrial use and household cooking and water heating in the \nproject areas are either more expensive or more polluted and the analysis indicates that natural \ngas is the least-cost option. For the central heating supply component, several options including \na  gas-fired  instead  of  coal-fired  centralized  heating  system,  coal-fired  household  heating \nsystems,  and  gas-fired  household  furnaces  were  evaluated.  Based  on  an  analysis  of  main \nfactors  such  as  the  coal  and  gas  resources  and  their  prices  in  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous \nRegion, and the local environmental benefits using gas, the least-cost analysis concludes that \nthe large-size centralized boilers for central heating supplies proposed for the project areas are \nthe least-cost option. The optimal size of the hot water boilers was assessed based on a market \nanalysis  of  present  and  future  heating  demands.  The  least  cost  analysis  for  the  wastewater \ntreatment component was carried out to determine the lowest supply alternative that will meet \nenvironmental  standards.  Considering  the  technical  feasibility  of  small-scale,  individually \ninstalled  wastewater  treatment  equipment  and  that  there  is  no  sewer  system  between  the \nproject areas to the major areas with central sewage treatment plants, the analysis concluded \nthat the on-site sewage treatment plants are the least cost options. Equalized discount rates of \nthe  lowest  cost  options  and  the  \"without  Project\"  scenario  were  applied  to  all  components  to \njustify the economic viability of the Project. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nEconomic internal rates of return (EIRR) were calculated for each project subcomponent \nand for the whole Project. Consistent with the least cost analysis, the economic analysis applies \n\n \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n\n                                                 \n1   A standard conversion factor of 0.93 is used in the current project.  Border prices were used for all imported items. \nLocal  costs  were  shadow  priced  using  group  and  specific  conversion  factors:  1.0  for  equipment,  0.95  for  steel, \n0.74 for cement, 1.1 for timber, 1.25 for skilled labor, and 1 for unskilled labor. Taxes and duties were excluded.  \nAll these conversion factors were based on ADB project in the PRC (ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of \nthe President to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Liaoning Environmental Improvement Project. Manila.) \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nthe conversion factors for investment costs for land,2 equipment costs, fuel costs, and operation \nand maintenance costs, where applicable. The input data and assumptions were reviewed by the \nproject preparatory TA consultants and found appropriate. For the EIRR calculations, the benefits \nof output were based on (i) cost savings on alternative fuels, and (ii) incremental demand. The \ncost-saving benefits were the cost differences of the alternative energy supply options with and \nwithout  the  Project.  A  survey  was  carried  out  to  determine  the  appropriate  energy  supply \noptions  for  each  category  of  consumers.  The  local  environmental  benefits  were  taken  into \naccount  in  the  EIRR  calculations.  Transmission  and  distribution  losses  were  based  on  the \nstatistics of historical line loss rates in each city. For the central heating supply and natural gas \ntransmission and distribution components, the benefits were based on the incremental benefits \nfrom  resource  cost  savings,  revenue,  consumer  surplus,  and  the  local  environmental  benefits \nfrom  reducing  pollutant  emissions.  The  main  benefits  of  the  wastewater  treatment  component \nwere  the  amount  of  wastewater  treated  and  utilization  of  treated  wastewater  in  the  cooling-\nsystem of nearby coal-fired thermal plant and for irrigation. In calculating the project\u2019s EIRR, the \nincremental  economic  benefit  of  treated  wastewater  was  assumed  at  50%  of  the  economic \nvalue of clean water. \n \n4. \nThe  details  of  the  economic  analysis  are  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  L.  The \nEIRR calculation takes a conservative approach, as it takes into account only the main benefits \nof  different  components  but  includes  all  project-related  costs.  This  approach  yields  EIRRs \nranging  from  (i)  10.0%  to  25.9%  without  and  14.0%  to  40.0%  with  the  local  environmental \nbenefits  for  the  project  subcomponents,  and  (ii)  17.6%  without  and  21.4%  with  the  local \nenvironmental  benefits  for  the  whole  Project.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  performed  for  each \nsubcomponent.  For  the  Project  EIRR,  sensitivity  analysis  showed  the  EIRR  (with  local \nenvironmental  benefits)  would  decrease  to  (i)  17.6%  if  the  Project  was  to  experience  a  cost \noverrun of 20%, (ii) 12.5% if the benefits were reduced by 20%, (iii) 15.0% if the Project was to \nexperience a commissioning delay of 1 year, and (iv) 6.4% if (i), (ii), and (iii) all happened. \n\n \nTable A7.1: Summary of Economic Internal Rates of Return (%) \n\nWithout Environmental \nBenefits \n\nWith Local Environmental \nBenefits \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSubcomponent \n \nWuhai Central Heating Supply \nDengkou Central Heating Supply \nLinhe Central Heating Supply \nHangjinhouqi Central Heating Supply \nWuyuan Central Heating Supply \nWulateqianqi Central Heating Supply \nWulatezhongqi Central Heating Supply \nWulatehouqi Central Heating Supply \nChang-Wu-Lin Gas Transmission \nGas Distribution and Station \nWulateqianqi Wastewater Treatment \nWulatehouqi Wastewater Treatment \nThe Whole Project \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n22.1 \n12.8 \n10.0 \n11.0 \n16.5 \n17.9 \n14.3 \n15.8 \n20.4 \n15.4 \n25.9 \n12.5 \n17.6 \n\n26.4 \n17.9 \n14.0 \n15.0 \n21.8 \n23.7 \n20.1 \n19.3 \n20.4 \n16.8 \n40.0 \n21.2 \n21.4 \n\n                                                 \n2   Land is valued at the economic opportunity cost (the estimated value of the best alternative utilization). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n39 \n\nD. \n\nEnvironmental Benefits \n\n \n\nRisk Analysis \n\n5. \nAn  economic  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  was  carried  out \nbased on the benefits transfer method. The evaluation used (i) the methodology adopted in the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Economic Evaluation of Environmental Impacts: A Workbook (1996) \nto determine the adjusted estimate of the monetary damages caused by air pollution during the \nstudy  period,  taking  into  account  the  location  of  the  pollution  sources,  emission  level,  and \npopulation affected; and (ii) estimates of average annual climate change for carbon emissions to \nevaluate the monetary damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions. The economic evaluation \nof  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  wastewater  component  was  calculated  based  on  the \ncriterion  of  collecting  fees  of  wastewater  in  the  project  areas.3 The  EIRRs  presented  in  Table \nA7.1  have  included  only  the  local  environmental  benefits.  If  the  global  environmental  benefits \nwere added to the project benefits, the Project EIRR would increase to 22.6%. \n \nE. \n \nA risk analysis, using the Monte Carlo simulation technique, was carried out for the EIRR \n6. \nto ensure the Project\u2019s viability. Based on the foregoing considerations and sensitivity analyses, \ncrucial  risk  variables  have  been  selected  because  of  their  significant  impact  on  the  Project\u2019s \nviability. The inputs for the risk analysis are taken from the base case benefit analysis over cost. \nThe  correlation  between  risk  variables  is  explicitly  considered  before  the  simulation  to  avoid \ngenerating  unrealistic  project  scenarios.  The  risk  analysis  for  EIRR  selected  six  variables: \nenergy sales, capital cost, input (coal, gas, and water) prices, implementation delay, exchange \nrate,  and  local  environmental  benefits.  The  results  were  based  on  3,000  simulations.  The \nexpected  EIRR  (without  environmental  considerations),  based  on  the  weighted  average  of  all \nsimulated  combinations,  is  17.8%  (with  a  standard  deviation  of  5.1%),  about  3.6%  lower  than \nthe base case value without considering project risks. The probability for the EIRR to be below \nthe considered discount rate of 12% is 7%. The very low economic risk is expected because the \nProject mainly relies on existing demand and benefits from efficiency improvement. \n \n\n                                                 \n3   This methodology was used in the past ADB wastewater treatment project. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS \n \nSummary of Past and Projected Financial Performance of Project Enterprises \n\nThe  detailed  historical  and  projected  financial  statements  of  the  project  enterprises  for \n\nA. \n \n1. \n2003\u20132011 are shown in Supplementary Appendix K and summarized here. \n \n2. \nInner Mongolia Saiwaixing Huazhang Paper Limited Company. A private enterprise \nengaged in paper manufacturing, the company has its own heating system providing heat to its \nemployees'  housing  area.  The  company  will  implement  the  heating  and  wastewater  treatment \nsubcomponents in Wulateqianqi. Wastewater from its paper mill has brought serious pollution to \nthe Yellow River, and its participation in the Project is in response to the provincial government's \nrequirement that it treat its wastewater. The company is structured into functional divisions and \nhas a board that meets regularly. Its finance division has 21 staff, and financial statements are \ncomputerized and comply with national and international accounting standards. Internal controls \nwithin  the  company  appear  to  be  adequate.  The  company  has  reported  profits  in  the  last  2 \nyears. It maintained a current ratio of 1.0 for 2003 and 2004, and the proportion of debt to equity \nwas 35% in 2003 and 28.8% in 2004. \n \n3. \nBayannur  Fuyuan  Shiye  Group  Limited  Company.  This  company,  a  former  state-\nowned  enterprise,  was  privatized  in  2003.  It  currently  operates  central  heating  facilities  in \nDengkou, Linhe and Wuyuan and expects to rehabilitate and augment these facilities under the \nProject. In addition to central heating, the company has business interests in the construction of \nboilers,  real  estate,  and  food  processing.  It  has  1,007 staff,  and  is  organized  by  operational \ndivisions with support from functional divisions. Its board of directors is appointed for a 4-year \nterm. The accounting system is computerized and financial statements comply with national and \ninternational  standards.  Internal  controls  within  the  company  appear  to  be  adequate.  The \ncompany\u2019s audit committee reports to the board. Its current ratios were 1.1 in 2003 and 0.8 in \n2004. Debt as a proportion to equity in 2004 was 35%.  \n \n4. \nWuhai  Thermal  Company.  This  fully  state-owned  enterprise,  established  in  1993,  will \nundertake the Wuhai municipality central heating scheme under the Project. The company has \n170  full-time  and  some  300 seasonal  employees.  It  is  organized  on  a  functional  basis  with \nfunctional managers reporting to the general manager. The company uses a manual accounting \nsystem.  Although  traditional  recording  of  transactions  is  being  done;  strategic  planning, \nforecasting, and decision-making roles of the finance function need to be strengthened. Internal \ncontrols and accounting procedures within the company need improvement. The company has \nbeen  reporting  losses  for  some  years  due  to  the  low  tariffs.  As  a  government  entity,  the \ncompany  does  not  have  any  debt.  Its  financial  performance  is  weak  with  inadequate  current \nassets to meet its current liabilities. The company will continue to need government assistance \nin its operations unless tariffs are raised to meet the cost of operations. Assistance will be given \nto strengthen the company\u2019s financial management under component D of the Project. \n \n5. \nWulatezhongqi Dagong Thermal Limited Company. This state-owned enterprise was \nprivatized in 2004, and will undertake the central heating subproject in Wulatezhongqi under the \nProject. As a new company, it does not yet have a board of directors. The company is run by a \npresident and chief executive officer; its finance division is headed by an experienced qualified \nnational assistant accountant. While the company\u2019s financial management effectiveness cannot \nyet be assessed, it is expected to adopt adequate internal controls in its operations. Assistance \nwill be given to strengthen corporate governance and financial management under component \nD of the Project. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n41 \n\n \n6. \nWulatehouqi Huibao Thermal Limited Company. This limited liability corporation was \nestablished in August 2005 with two main shareholders; Jianxin Group and Dong Sheng Miao \nMining  Company.  The  main  activity  of  the  business  is  heating  supply.  The  company  will \nundertake  the  Wulatehouqi  central  heating  subproject  under  the  Project.  The  company  has  a \nfunctional structure with deputy general managers reporting to the general manager, who in turn \nreports to the president. The company is in the process of setting up its finance division and has \nbeen informed that it should be headed by a qualified accountant. \n \n7. \nInner  Mongolia  Haosheng  Thermal  Limited  Company.  This  new  privately  owned \nlimited liability company was formed as a subsidiary of the Cashmere Wool Company, with its \nmain business in heat supply. It will undertake the central heating project in Hangjinhouqi. The \ncompany  is  headed  by  a  president  and  is  organized  functionally.  A  chart  of  accounts  and \nmanual of accounting is available, and the company is in the process of setting up its finance \ndivision. It is expected to adopt national accounting standards in the preparation of its financial \naccounts. \n \n8. \nInner  Mongolia  Western  Natural  Gas  Limited  Company.  This  limited  liability \nshareholding  company  was  established  in  2002.  Its  shareholders  are  principally  state-owned \nentities. Since its establishment, the company has been involved in the construction of the first \nphase  of  the  natural  gas  pipeline  of  501  kilometers.  Its  participation  in  the  Project  is  to \nimplement  the  second  phase  of  the  gas  pipeline  of  approximately  400 kilometers  and  expand \nthe  distribution  network.  The  company  commenced  commercial  operations  only  in  2005  after \ncompletion of phase 1. The finance division is headed by a qualified accountant and its financial \nstatements  comply  with  national  accounting  standards.  It  has  a  computerized  accounting \nsystem and internal controls appear to be adequate. It also has an audit committee reporting to \nthe board. Due to the construction of the gas pipeline, it has a significant amount of debt, hence, \na  high  gearing  ratio  of  77%  in  2004.  Its  financial  performance  is  expected  to  improve  as \ncommercial operations begin. \n \n9. \nWulatehouqi Water Company. This state-owned enterprise was established in 1981 to \nsupply  water  to  Sai  and  Bayin  townships.  It  will  implement  the  Wulatehouqi  wastewater  plant \nunder  the  Project.  The organization  is  structured  according  to  two  geographical  regions  under \nits control, each headed by a deputy general manager. Standard bookkeeping requirements in \nrespect  of  reconciliations  and  registers  were  carried  out.  Its  financial  statements  comply  with \nnational  accounting  standards.  Its  financial  performance  is  rather  weak  and  is  supported  by \ngovernment subsidy. Its revenue is mainly from water supply; this is expected to increase when \nit  is  able  to  charge  for  wastewater  when  the  Project  is  complete.  If  the  company  is  to  be \nsustainable in the future, the tariff must be set at an amount to at least cover cost. Assistance \nunder Component D of the Project will provide the institutional strengthening it requires. \n \nAssumptions Used for Financial Projections \nB. \n \n \n10. \nThe financial operations of the project companies were projected for 2006\u20132020 based \non major assumptions described in the following paragraphs. Projections were prepared for the \nincome statement, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement for all the companies participating in \nthe Project. \n \nThe  projected  financial  performance  included  the  implementation  and  operation  of  the \n11. \nProject, which will be under construction between 2006 and 2009. Under the proposed loan, the \nproject companies will be required to maintain a debt-service coverage ratio of at least 1.4 times, \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\na  current  ratio  of  at  least  1:1  by  2010  and  thereafter,  accounts  receivable  not  to  exceed  the \nequivalent of 3 months of sales by 2010, and a debt-equity ratio at a maximum of 70:30. The \nfinancial covenants of ADB are expected to be satisfied during the life of the Project. The debt-\nservice coverage ratio is forecast to be adequate throughout. The debt-equity ratio will also be \nwithin the prescribed maximum limit. Other financial ratios are expected to remain satisfactory. \n \n12. \nFor the central heating projects, a 4-year  construction period is assumed from 2006 to \n2009. Project costs were estimated by design engineers and reviewed by technical assistance \n(TA)  engineers.  The  main  raw  material  is  coal; the  use  of  more  efficient  boilers  is  factored  in. \nThe  Linhe  and  Wuhai  facilities  also  use  heat  generated  from  the  power  plant.  The  other \nmaterials  required  are  electricity  and  water,  where  the  requirement  was  reviewed  by  the  TA \nengineers. The current prices for these materials are used as the basis for financial projections \nand  prices  are  assumed  to  increase  by  0.8%  per  annum  in  real  terms.  The  TA  engineers \nestimated  the  direct  and  indirect  staff  costs  and  other  operational  overhead.  Replacement  of \nequipment is assumed to take place at regular intervals. Working capital increases are assumed \nbased on a 1 month inventory, 1.5 month average for receivables, and 2 months for payables. \nThe heating tariffs are segregated by domestic, industrial, and commercial tariffs; ranges vary in \nthe project areas. Regular tariff reviews are assumed to occur to ensure full cost recovery. \n \n13. \nBoth the city gas pipelines and the Chang-Wu-Lin transmission pipeline are assumed to \nbe  constructed  over  4  years  from  2006  to  2009.  Project  costs  were  estimated  by  design \nengineers and reviewed by the TA engineers. The main raw material is the gas itself, which will \nbe  sourced  from  the  Changqing  gas  field  where  the  company  has  entered  into  a  long-term \npurchase  contract  at  CNY0.66/cubic  meter  (m3).  The  other  materials  are  electricity  and  water, \nwhich are at current prices. The TA engineers estimated the direct and indirect staff costs and \nother  operational  overhead.  Working  capital  increases  are  assumed  based  on  0.5  month  for \nreceivables  and  1  month  for  payables.  The  tariff  is  agreed  at  CNY1.45/m3, which  is  used  for \nprojections. Technical and non technical losses are assumed at 3%. \n \n14. \nThe wastewater treatment subcomponents are assumed to be constructed over 4 years \nfrom 2006 to 2009. Project costs were estimated by design engineers and reviewed by the TA \nengineers. The main material requirements are in terms of electricity and chemicals, which are \nat  current  prices.  The  TA  engineers  estimated  the  direct  and  indirect  staff  costs  and  other \noperational  overhead.  Working  capital  increases  are  assumed  based  on  0.5  month  for \nchemicals, 1 month for receivables, and 1 month for payables. No wastewater tariff is currently \nin place and an assumed tariff is used to ensure full cost recovery. \n \n15. \nThese  subcomponents  were  aggregated  with  the  relevant  companies  to  provide \ncompany  financial  projections  from  2006\u20132020.  The  projections  assume  that  the  proportion  of \nthe  subprojects  financed  by  ADB,  domestic  banks,  and  equity  is  as  given  by  the  companies. \nThe cost of finance before tax by the ADB loan, domestic loans, and equity is assumed to be \n5.42%, 6.5%, and 8% respectively. The ADB loan is assumed to have a grace period of 5 years \nand be repaid in 25 years, while the domestic loans will have a grace period of 1 year and be \nrepaid in 5 years. Corporate taxation is assumed at the rate of 33% of the profit before tax and \ndepreciation  over  25  years  with  no  residual  value.  The  owners  are  expected  to  provide \nadequate equity at the required intervals to maintain a positive cash position. Working capital is \nprojected on the assumption that improvements in its management will take place so that they \nare brought down to acceptable commercial levels. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n43 \n\nTable A8: Summary Financial Performance and Projections\n(CNY million)\n\nYear Ending December 31\nA8.1: IM Saiwaixing Huazhang Paper Ltd.

All \nthe  costs  and  prices  are  expressed  in  constant  2005  prices.  The  economic  lives  of  the \nsubprojects  are  estimated  at  25  years  with  no  residual  value.  The  financial  operations  of  the \nindividual  project  implementing  agencies  (PIAs)  for  the  Project  are  projected  based  on  the \nassumptions described in Appendix 8. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe benefits from the Project will be derived from the sales of output from the individual \nsubprojects  based  on  the  projected  production  levels  and  applicable  tariffs.  The  capital  costs \ninclude  physical  contingencies,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  financial  charges  during \nconstruction. The agreed transfer prices or projected purchase costs of inputs were considered. \nOther operating costs include personnel, distribution, administration, and other expenses. \n \nC. \n \nThe financial internal rate of return of each subproject was calculated after income tax. \n3. \nThe financial viability of the Project was subjected to sensitivity analysis under various adverse \nconditions. The sensitivity analysis results for the overall project are shown in Table A9.1. \n \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\nTable A9.1: Sensitivity Analysis of FIRR for the Overall Project \n\n \n\nProject Group \n \nItem \n \nBase Case \n(i)   Capital Cost Overrun \n(ii)  O&M Cost Overrun \n(iii)  Benefit Reduction  \n(iv)  Implementation Delay \n(v)  Combination of \n \n(i),(ii),(iii)&(iv) \nAfter-Tax WACC \n\n \nChange \nVariable \n\nAll Projects  Natural Gas  Wastewater \nFIRR \n(%) \n\nFIRR \n(%) \n\nFIRR \n(%) \n\nCentral Heating \nFIRR \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n10% \n10% \n10% \n1 Year \n \n\n \n\n7.7 \n6.6 \n6.7 \n5.2 \n7.3 \n2.9 \n\n3.9 \n\n7.9 \n6.8 \n7.4 \n5.3 \n7.7 \n3.3 \n\n3.7 \n\n7.1 \n6.1 \n4.7 \n6.6 \n6.1 \n1.3 \n\n3.5 \n\n7.6 \n6.6 \n6.5 \n4.9 \n7.3 \n2.8 \n\n4.0 \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital \n\nFIRR  =  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  O&M  =  operation  and  maintenance,  WACC  =  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nThe weighted average cost of capital was calculated after tax in real terms, following the \nmethodology  in  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment \nProjects Financed by the Asian Development Bank1 using actual capital mix and costs of funds. \nActual  interest  rates  of  local  loan  funds  were  considered.  For  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  loan,  the  interest  rate  is  based  on  the  current  London  interbank  offered  rate  on  5-year \nfixed-interest swap (currently at 5.48%) plus the ADB loan spread of 0.4%. The cost of equity is \nassumed to be 8.0%, and the cost of domestic borrowing 6.5%. The average domestic inflation \nrate is 3.0% per year. The income tax is 33%. The weighted average cost of capital is calculated \nto be 3.9%. \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2001.

\n1. \nenvironmental  costs  of  the  Project,  which  are  taken  as  environmental  benefits/costs  of  the \nProject.  For  each  subcomponent,  the  emissions  from  the  Project  and  its  alternative  supply \noptions  are  studied  to  identify  its  environmental  benefits  (costs).  The  environmental  impact \nanalysis  is  carried  out  in  four  steps:  (i)  major  stressors  or  polluters  are  identified;  (ii) impact \nscreening is carried out for each stressor; (iii) if the impacts are major, efforts are made to place \nmonetary  valuation;  and  (iv)  the  benefits  (costs)  flows  are  quantified  for  integration  with  the \neconomic  analysis  of  the  Project.  Details  of  the  methodology  are  presented  in  Supplementary \nAppendix L. Table A10.1 describes the typical coal contents used by residents and industry in \nthe Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Based on analysis in Table A10.2, the annual avoided \nemissions of the major environmental stresses were estimated, including 1,792.3 ton of carbon \ndioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter (PM10), sulfur oxide and total suspended particulates \n(TSP)  which  were  calculated  as  the  emission  difference  of  the  project  component  and \nalternative \nfor  consumers.  These \nenvironmental  stressors  are  screened  for  their potential  impacts  on  four  major  groups:  human \nhealth, human welfare, environmental resources, and global systems. \n \n\nfuels  (liquefied  petroleum  gas,  propane,  and  coal) \n\nTable A10.1: Coal Quality Analysis \n\nItem \n\nValue \n\nHeat value \nTotal moisture \nInherent moisture \nAsh content \nVolatile meter \nCarbon \nHydrogen \nOxygen \nNitrogen \nSulfur \n\n \nItem \n \n \nIndustrial Analysis \n \n \n \n \nElement Analysis \n \n \n\u2014 = not applicable., Kcal/kg = kilocalorie per kilogram.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2. \nIn modeling the effects of waterborne discharges, various factors need to be considered, \nthe most obvious being whether the receiving water system is a stream, estuary, lake, ocean, or \ngroundwater table.

Then  the  emissions  from \nthe  central  heating  systems  (large  boilers)  were  estimated  using  the  same  method.  The  total \nemission reductions from project components were computed by comparing the emission levels \n\ntotal  emissions  were  computed  by \n\nfirst  multiplying \n\nthe  emission \n\nThe \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f50 \n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nbetween  the  reference  case  and  the  Project  components.  For  natural  gas  transmission  and \ndistribution, the environmental benefits are the environmental cost differences of the alternative \nenergy  supply  options  with  and  without  the  Project.  Based  on  the  externality  cost  of  different \nfuels and the amount of air pollutant emissions, the environmental benefit due to the natural gas \ntransmission  and  distribution  can  be  calculated.  However,  calculating  the  incremental \nenvironmental  benefit  of  wastewater  treated  by  the  Project  is  difficult.  Considering  the \nexperience of the Asian Development Bank in wastewater projects in general and the country\u2019s \ncircumstances  in  particular,  the  economic  evaluation  of  the  environmental  impacts  of  the \nwastewater projects were calculated based on the criterion of collecting fees for wastewater in \nthe  PRC.  The  total  economic  values  of  the  reduced  wastewater  from  the  subprojects  are \nestimated in Table A10.6. \n \n\nTable A10.6: Environmental Benefits for the Project \n(CNY million) \n \n\nItem \nCentral Heating \nNatural Gas  \nWastewater \n\n2006 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n2007 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n\n2008 \n24.0 \n0 \n0 \n\n2009\n33.0\n0\n35.0\n\n2010\n38.0\n8.4\n42.0\n\n2020 \n58.0 \n9.4 \n59.0 \n\n2030 \n58.0 \n10.6 \n59.0 \n\nNPV\n298.0\n44.4\n290.6\n\nNPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n51 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\nthe  sector \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nIs \nidentified  as  a \nnational priority in country poverty \npartnership agreement?   \n\n \nA. \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?  \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nIn line with the Government\u2019s energy sector strategy to promote socioeconomic development and to meet \nthe basic needs of the poor, increased clean gas and central heating supplies are needed to support the \nnational poverty reduction program. Adequate and reliable gas and central heating supplies are essential \nto human well-being in the cold Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Gas and central heating supply will \nreduce  coal  and  wood  burning  that  cause  serious  environmental  and  air-related  diseases  in  the  project \nareas.  The  poor,  women,  and  children  can  be  particularly  vulnerable  as  they  tend  to  be  exposed  more \nextensively to urban pollution than other population classes. A better urban environment can improve the \nlocal  investment  climate  to  attract  more  investment  to  the  region  and  promote  the  development  of  the \nindustry and service sectors. Through careful design of project subcomponents and active policy dialogue, \nthis Project provides specific gas and central heating assistance programs to the poor so they can have \nreliable gas and central heating supplies in the winter. The Project will improve the quality of life for the \nlocal  people.  Overall,  the  gas  and  central  heating  supplies  of  the  Project  will  complement  the  PRC\u2019s \npoverty reduction efforts. \n \nB. \nPoverty analysis has been treated as an integral part of project design, and is based on quantitative and \nqualitative methodologies. Project planning and design have made use of national, provincial, municipal, \nand  subproject  poverty  data;  and  involved  field  poverty  assessments,  questionnaire  surveys,  and \nstakeholder consultations, including with project beneficiaries. Participatory methods were used to identify \nthe  local  poor  population  and  the  provisions  that  would  help  to  improve  the  quality  of  their  lives.  The \nProject  will  directly  benefit  a  total  population  of  about  2.2  million  in  the  eight  project  areas.  Of  the  total \nbeneficiaries,  about  0.96  million  urban  residents  will  benefit  from  the  gas  supply  and  central  heating \nsupply.  About  71,324  or  about  7.5%  of  the  total  beneficiaries  are  poor  as  measured  by  the  various  city \npoverty lines. The increased use of gas and heating supplies (including the closure of 396 small inefficient \ncoal-fired  boilers)  will  reduce  the  use  of  coal  and  coal  briquettes  that  cause  environmental  and  health \nimpacts, particularly for the poor. The Project will indirectly benefit the entire urban population residing in \nthe eight project areas. The benefits for the poor from the Project include the following:  \n\nPoverty Classification: General Intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n(i)  Job  creation:  The  Project  will  create  about  10,240  person-years  of  employment  opportunities  during \nproject  construction  and  1,412  full-time  jobs  during  operation.  Of  the  total,  4,090  person-years  of \nemployment opportunities will be filled by the poor, women, and minorities with an estimated total of \nCNY44.2  million  in  wage  payments  during  project  construction.  In  addition,  565  employment \nopportunities with CNY6.1 million of annual wage payments are expected to go to the poor, women, \nand minorities during project operation. Local procurement of the materials required for the Project is \nexpected to create additional jobs. \n\n(ii)  Reduced  environmental  (outside  and  indoor)  impacts:  Through  the  development  of  methane  gas \nsupply; improved and increased gas and central heating supplies; and closure of 396 small, inefficient, \nand polluting coal-fired boilers, the Project will reduce air emissions of sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide, \nnitrogen  oxide,  total  suspended  particulate,  and  solid  wastes  in  the  project  areas.  This  will  result  in \ntremendous  socioeconomic  and  environmental  benefits  to  the  local  communities  and  populations. \nImproved air quality will reduce the morbidity and mortality rate of air-related diseases and associated \nmedical costs, and loss of healthy working days in  the project area. The poor, elderly, children, and \nwomen,  who  have  fewer  coping  resources  and  are  more  vulnerable,  will  benefit  disproportionately \nfrom the reduction in air emissions. Because women usually spend more time than men cooking; the \nlength of their exposure to smoke is higher. As such the Project will benefit women more than men. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(iii)  Enhanced  quality  of  life  for  the  poor:  Survey  results  show  that  majority  of  the  urban  residents \nbelieve  that  the  supply  of  gas  and  central  heating  and  the  disposal  of  wastewater  will  improve  the \noverall quality of life, reduce housework for women, decrease health problems, increase comfort and \nentertainment activities, and facilitate longer study periods during the winter. \n\n \n(iv)  Connection  fee  and  tariff  discount: The  average heating  expenditure  burden  (the  ratio  of  heating \nexpenditure and the household\u2019s monthly income) of the poor in the project areas is high, ranging from \n17.5%  to  30.7%  of  their  total  household  expenditure.  Through  policy  dialogue,  the  project  city \ngovernments and the project implementing agencies (PIAs) have agreed to specific programs to help \nthe poor to pay for gas supply and winter heating. These programs will ensure the amount for gas or \ncentral heating that a poor household, as defined by the city poverty line, will pay is about 5% of the \nhousehold\u2019s  monthly  income.  The  PIAs  will  provide  connection  fee  and  tariff  discounts  to  the  poor. \nThese discounts will come from the cost savings from the efficiency improvement of the Project and \nfinancial profits of investment under the Project. If the household\u2019s payment plus the discounts given \nby  the  PIAs  is  less  than  the  total  gas  or  heating  bill,  the  remainder  of  the  gas  or  heating  bill  will  be \ncovered by local governments. This approach is consistent with ADB policy that tariff subsidies should \nbe  transparent  and  explicit,  and  that  the  government  social  objective  should  be  separated  from \ncommercial management of enterprises. A summary of the discounts to the poor planned by the PIAs \nand preliminary cost savings follows: \n\n \nA total of 52,337 poor households living under the city poverty lines classified for those with incomes under \nthe  minimum  living  guarantee  in  the  project  areas  will  benefit  from  the  gas  and  central  heating  supply \nconnection and tariff discounts offered by the PIAs. Of these, 22,971 poor households receiving the gas \nand  heating  supply  connection  will  have  annual  savings  of  CNY10.2  million  for  the  connection  fees  and \nCNY26.84  million  for  tariff  reductions  for  the  beneficiaries.  The  Project\u2019s  city  government-funded  gas \nsupply and central heating assistance program should supplement the tariff discounts offered by the PIAs \nso that the poor households can have sufficient gas and heating supply.  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nParticipation Process \n\nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nA stakeholder consultation and analysis was done during the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) \nand roles of each stakeholder were defined. The local governments and communities will assist the PIAs \nwith  land  acquisition,  implementation  of  a  short  resettlement  plan,  and  organization  of  local  labor  for \nproject construction. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region government (the Executing Agency), PIAs, \nand  TA  team  undertook  socioeconomic  surveys  and  public  meetings  to  raise  awareness  and  gain  local \nsupport.  These  processes  enabled  local  stakeholders  to  express  their  opinions  and  to  make  relevant \nsuggestions. Specifically, intensive consultation of village leaders, rural poor, and women were conducted \nduring the TA socioeconomic survey on project impact and resettlement issues. The participatory activities \nare  an  ongoing  process  that  will  continue  during  project  implementation.  The  poor  and  women  will  be \ngiven additional consideration during project implementation. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nA  resettlement  information  booklet  for  the  central  heating  subcomponent  will  be  distributed  to  those \naffected  by  the  Project.  Further  consultation  with  those  affected  will  continue  throughout  the  land \nacquisition  process.  Ongoing  consultations  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PIAs  to  understand  and  meet  the \nevolving needs and expectations of the users; increase awareness of the public about the benefits of the \nProject;  and  encourage  the  active  involvement  of  local  communities  to  maximize  their  support  for  the \nProject, promote gas and heating consumption and saving, and raise the social acceptance of user fees. \nThe  consultations can  take  the  forms  of  annual  questionnaire  surveys  by  consumer  category,  combined \nwith ad hoc community forums. Women\u2019s organizations and schools usually have extensive networks that \ncan be used for the distribution of information materials and survey questionnaires. To maximize project \nbenefits  to  community  members  in  the  project  area,  the  PIAs  will  ensure  that  the  contractors  maximize \nhiring  laborers  for  project  construction  from  local  communities  and  provide  necessary  training.  A  social \ndevelopment  action  plan  was  prepared  to  address  mitigation  and  enhancement  measures  to  maximize \nproject benefits to the communities in the project area. \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f \n\nD. \n\nGender Development  \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\n \n\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nTo  maximize  the  project  benefits  to  women,  preferential  policies  will  be  given  to  women  for  the \nemployment  and  training  opportunities  generated  from  the  construction  and  operation  phases,  and  the \nproposed  poverty  reduction  programs  of  the  Project.  Women\u2019s  needs  and  interests  will  be  represented \nduring project implementation. The PIAs will adopt a proactive employment system and targeted training \nprograms  for  women.  The  implementation  of  gender  equity  policies  will  encourage  filling  employment \nopportunities  with  women  and  the  poor.  Particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  women  during  the  land \nacquisition and resettlement process.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \n \nE. \n \n  \n \nItem \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n \n \nPlan Required \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nResettlement \n  \n\n \nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nNone \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nAffordability  \n \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None \n\n \n \nLabor \n \n\n \n\nis \n\nthe \n\nfarmland.

A total \nof  51.56  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be  acquired,  of  which \n32%  (16.36  ha) \nis \nwasteland  and  sandy  land  (35.19  ha).  A  total  of  133 \npeople (60 households) will be affected by the permanent \nfarmland  acquisition.  An  additional  175  are  estimated  to \nbe  affected  by  the  temporary  land  occupation  for  an \nthe  entire  project \naverage  of  90  days  during \nimplementation.  Foreseen \nimpacts  will  be  minimal; \nhowever  a  short  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  and  will \nbe updated once a detailed measurement survey is made. \nConsultation  was  carried  out  during  the  TA  and  further \nconsultation  will  be  carried  out  between \nlocal \ngovernment land committee and affected households. \nThe  affordability  of  the  poor  has  been  assessed.  In  the \nproject areas, heating bills account for 17.5% to 30.7% of \nthe  average  monthly  incomes  of  the  poor  households \nliving  under  the  city  poverty  lines.  Through  active  policy \ndialogue,  the  PIAs  and  project  areas  have  agreed  to \nestablish  a  city  government-funded  heating  assistance \nfund  of  about  CNY13.4  million  for  tariff  discounts  and \nconnection \nthe  eligible  poor \nhouseholds  will  not  pay  generally  more  than  5%  of  their \nmonthly income for gas and/or central heating supply. The \nannual savings will be CNY10.2 million for the connection \nfees and CNY26.84 million for tariff reductions for the poor \nhousehold. \n  \nThe  Project  will  create  about  10,240  person-years  of \nemployment  opportunities  during  construction  and  1,412 \nfull-time  jobs  during  operation.  The  closure  of  396  small \nboilers will affect about 784 workers. Reemployment plans \nwere prepared by the PIAs to ensure that all the affected \nworkers will be reassigned to similar jobs or retrained.

The  approach  takes  only  the  direct  project \nbenefits into account in assessing poverty impact. The direct project benefits include resource \ncost  savings,  revenue,  consumer  surplus,  and  the  local  environmental  benefits  from  reducing \npollutant emissions and water pollution. The methodology involves three steps: (i) estimate the \npresent value of net financial and economic benefits by participating group; (ii) for each group, \ndeduct the financial benefits from the economic benefits to give the distribution of net economic \nbenefits; and (iii) assign the net economic benefits (NEB), accruing to the poor, according to the \nproportion of each group that is poor. A poverty impact ratio expressing the proportion of NEB \naccruing to the poor can be calculated by comparing the NEB to the poor with the NEB of the \nProject  as  a  whole.1 The  analysis  used  constant  2004  prices,  a  standard  conversion  factor  of \n0.93,  and  a  discount  rate  of  12%.  Tradable  commodities  were  valued  at  border  prices  at  the \nprevailing exchange rate. Nontradable commodities were valued at shadow prices, using a mix \nof  standard  and  specific  conversion  factors.  Net  financial  benefits  (NFB)  and  NEB  are \nexpressed in yuan (CNY). \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  NFB  are  equal  to  sales  revenue  of  CNY5.926  million  minus  capital  costs  of \nCNY1.682  million,  operating  costs  of  CNY3.594  million,  labor  costs  of  CNY449  million,  and \nincome taxes of CNY309 million. The NFB of the Project shows a loss of CNY108 million in net \npresent  value  at  a  12%  discount  rate  (Table  A12).  The  NEB  of  the  Project  expressed  at  the \ndomestic price level are CNY866 million. They are equal to gross benefits of CNY6,771 million \n(including  consumer  surplus  and  environmental  benefits)  minus  capital  costs  of  CNY1.723 \nmillion, operating costs of CNY3.745 million, and labor costs of CNY437 million (wages valued \nat  the  shadow  price  of  labor  for  both  skilled  and  unskilled  labor).  The  difference  between  the \nNEB  and  NFB  is  distributed  by  groups.  The  difference  of  CNY974  million  is  made  up  of  (i) \nconsumer  surplus  of  CNY302  million  (mainly  in  terms  of  the  difference  between  the  without-\nproject cost of gas and heating supply and the with-project expenditure on gas and heating plus \nthe value of gas and heating supply consumed but not paid for; (ii) the environmental benefits of \nCNY543 million from efficiency improvement, closure of small coal-fired boilers, and disposal of \nwastewater;  (iii)  the  difference  between  financial  and  economic  cost  of  capital  investment  and \noperating costs of CNY41 million and CNY151 million, respectively (mainly due to government \ntaxes  and  duties,  overvaluation  of  the  exchange  rate,  and  other  price  distortions);  (iv)  loss  to \nskilled labor of CNY49 million (current wages less opportunity cost of labor); (v) gain of unskilled \nlabor of CNY61 million; and (vi) income taxes of CNY309 million. \n \n3. \nThe  differences  between  the  NEB  and  NFB  give  rise  to  losses  and  gains  among  the \nproject participants. Considering the overall result of NFB of negative CNY108 million and NEB \nof CNY866 million for the Project, the NEB exceeds the NFB by CNY974 million. Skilled labor \nwill lose CNY49 million and unskilled labor gain CNY61 million at the project wage levels, which \nare  lower  (higher)  than  the  opportunity  costs,  while  consumers  will  gain  from  their  consumer \nsurplus  of  CNY302  million.  The  investor  (project  companies)  of  the  Project  will  lose  CNY108 \nmillion at a discount rate of 12%. Since this is a public sector loan and project companies are \nstate-owned enterprises or guaranteed by the Government, the CNY108 million losses could be \n\n                                                 \n1  The  poverty  impact  ratio  is  based  on  the  distribution  of  project  net  benefits.  This  differs  from  the  project \nclassification criterion of the Asian Development Bank, which is expressed in terms of the number of beneficiaries. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n \n\nPoverty Impact Ratio \n\nconsidered as the Government's financial loss from investing in the Project (unable to invest in a \nproject  with  12%  financial  return).  The  environmental  benefits  of  CNY543  million  and  income \ntaxes  of  CNY309  million  will  be  considered  as  the  gains  to  the  Government  from  a  national \nperspective. Subtracting the gains of CNY41 million from capital costs and CNY151 million from \noperating costs results in a net economic gain to the Government of CNY660 million. \n \nC. \n \nThe differences between the financial and economic values, and the consequent gains \n4. \nand losses for different project participants, provide the basis for considering the impact of the \nProject  on  the  poor.  The  poor  account  for  7.5%  of  the  people  living  in  the  project  area.2 The \nincremental  gas  and  better  heating  supply  could  benefit  the  urban  poor  more  as  their \nconsumption  is  projected  to  increase  faster  because  of  their  current  low  consumption  levels. \nThe  government  of  the  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region  (GIMAR)  agreed  to  ensure  that \nproject  areas  consider  establishing  heating  assistance  programs  for  the  poor  with  adequate \nannual  government  budget.  Cost  savings  resulting  from  the  efficiency  improvement  of  the \nProject will be passed on to the poor in the form of heating bill discounts. These programs will \nbe designed to alleviate the affordability problems in the project areas. Based on the projected \nshare  of  urban  consumers,  their  consumption  pattern,  number  of  the  poor  living  below  the \npoverty  line,  projected  cost  savings,  and  the  estimated  tariff  reduction,  the  share  of  the \nconsumer surplus going to the poor is estimated at 7.0%. \n\n5. \nFrom a national perspective, the gains of CNY660 million (the gains of the Government) \nare  mainly  the  environmental  benefits  and  income  taxes  with  the  Project.  Some  Government \nlosses  are  from  capital  investment  and  operating  costs  (CNY41  million  and  CNY151  million, \nrespectively).  The  loss  is  further  offset  by  the  financial  losses  of  CNY108  million  (at  12% \ndiscount  rate).  A  2001  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  publication indicates  that  the  poor  are \ndisproportionately affected by environmental degradation and benefit more from environmental \nimprovement.3 Without the Project, the poor would not have information about and access to, or \ncould not afford more efficient (less-polluting) equipment and fuels. The water, gas distribution, \nand heating supply networks are usually less well functioning or absent in the poorer sections of \nthe areas. Based on the household survey, most non-poor have access to existing water, gas, \nand heating supplies. The inadequate water, gas, and heating supply to the poor increase the \nexposure of the poor to daily doses of pollutants because of using coal and poor quality water \nfor  domestic  consumption,  as  well  as  the  risk  of  accidents.  Therefore,  the  reduction  of  local \nenvironmental pollution will benefit the poor substantially more. Based on the household survey, \ndemand forecast, and discussions with the Executing Agency\u2014GIMAR, the local environmental \nprotection  agency,  and  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  consultants,  this \nanalysis  estimates  that  the  share  of  the  government\u2019s  net  benefits  (environmental  benefits) \ngoing to the poor living below the poverty line will be 17%. \n \n \n6. \nThe  direct  employment  effect  of  the  Project  during  construction  is  an  important  project \nbenefit. The local currency portion of the Project is about 58% of the project cost. Of the 58%, \nthe nonequipment portion is substantial. Part of that will benefit the rural poor in the project area \nby direct employment. Since the poor are normally unskilled labors, they will be the beneficiaries \nof the Project as the current wages would be higher than their opportunity costs. Based on the \nprojected  labor  employed  in  the  Project  through  a  special  employment  program  for  the  poor, \nparticularly in gas distribution and central heating supply subcomponents, 15% of the surplus for \nunskilled labor will go to the urban poor. \n\n                                                 \n2  The poverty lines used in the poverty analysis are the official urban poverty lines in the project areas. \n3  ADB. 2001. Moving the Poverty Reduction Agenda Forward in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe requirement of a project disproportionately benefiting the poor translates into (i) an \n7. \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  of  12%  or  above,  and  (ii)  a  poverty  impact  ratio  significantly \ngreater  than  the  poor's  share  in  GDP,  which  is  usually  lower  than  the  number  of  poor  in  the \nproject areas. Table A12 shows that the NEB directly accruing to the poor are CNY117 million. \nThe  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  ratio,  which  expresses  the  proportion  of  NEB  of  the  Project \naccruing  to  the  poor,  is  13.5%;  this  is  higher  than  the  ratio  of  the  poverty  population  in  the \nproject area of 7.5%. The calculation of poverty impact ratio is based on the direct benefits of \nthe Project. All other indirect benefits are not captured in the poverty impact ratio. \n \nD. \n\nConclusion \n\n8. \nThe analysis concludes that the Project will support pro-poor economic growth. The risk \nanalysis on the poverty impact ratio calculation, together with the analysis on the probability of \noverall  project  failure,  concludes  that  the  probability  of  a  negative  outcome  for  the  poor  is \nminimal. \n\n \nTable A12: Benefit Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n(Present values at 12%, in CNY million) \n\nAccounts \nFinancial Economic \nAccounts Accounts  Difference   Consumers Economy  Labor \n \n \n \n \n\nBeneficiaries \nGovernment \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nTotal \n\n \n  \nItem \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nA.

The  resettlement  plan  covers  all  three \ncomponents  and  is  based  on  the  project  feasibility  study.  Since  relatively  few  people  will  be \naffected by the Project, the Executing Agency, the government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion  (GIMAR),  and  project  implementation  agencies  (PIAs)  conducted  detailed  village-level \nimpact assessments. The resettlement plan will be revised after the completion of the detailed \nmeasurement survey and submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for approval prior to \ncommencement of land acquisition. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  affect  18  townships  and  23  administrative  villages  in  12 counties,  in \nWuhai, Erdos, and Bayannur municipalities. According to the impact survey during the feasibility \nstudy, a total 51.56 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired, of which 32% (16.36 ha) is farmland. \nSixty-eight percent is wasteland and sandy land (35.19 ha). A total of 10.21 ha will be occupied \nby  the  gas  transportation  system,  33.36  ha  by  the  central  heating  system,  and  7.69  ha  by \nwastewater  treatment  plant.  Another  653.45  ha  will  be  occupied  temporarily  for  an  average \nperiod  of  90  days  during  construction.  Based  on  per  capita  farmland  in  affected  villages, \n133 people (30 households) will be affected by the permanent land acquisition and an additional \n175  are  estimated  to  be  affected  by  the  temporary  land  occupation.  As  well  as  the  land \nacquisition, other affected assets include trees and electricity poles that have to be removed. No \nhousing relocation is expected under the Project. All land and other assets will be compensated \nat replacement value. \n \nC. \n \nFor people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \n3. \nincome  and  living  standards  in  line  with  the  PRC  Land  Administration  Law  (1998)  and  ADB\u2019s \npolicy  on  involuntary  resettlement.1 The  project  management  office  (PMO)  under  GIMAR  will \nensure that any people losing land, housing, other assets, or income sources will be assisted to \nfully  restore  their  income  and  living  standards.  In  2000,  GIMAR  issued  a  land  administration \ndecree  to  implement  the  1998  Land  Administration  Law,  and  in  2004  issued  a  special  decree \nconcerning  land  compensation,  which  stipulates  the  regulations  for  land  compensation, \nresettlement  subsidies,  young  crop  compensation,  and  other  measures \nto  carry  out \nresettlement.  According  to  the  policy  and  basic  socioeconomic  conditions  among  project \ncounties,  detailed  compensation  rates  will  be  agreed  upon  for  each  affected  county.  For  the \nresettlement plan, a comprehensive compensation rate for land compensation including young \ncrops has been estimated at ranging from CNY1,531 per ha to CNY2,459 per ha for cultivated \nland; and from CNY306 per ha to CNY699 per ha for wasteland. People losing land temporarily \nduring construction will receive a payment equivalent to production value foregone for the period \nof loss, which is expected to be 1 year. The Project will arrange construction work occupying the \nfarm  land  to  take  place  during  the  winter  so  as  to  reduce  the  impact  on  production.  The  land \nused temporarily will also be restored by the contractor to the original condition. \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n59 \n\nResettlement Strategy \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\n \nD. \n \n4. \nEfforts  to  minimize  resettlement  effects  have  been  made  after  consultations  with  local \nofficials during the setting of the alignment for the feasibility study. The selected alignment will \navoid towns, villages, and high-yield crop and fruit gardens. Heating source sites are arranged \nas much as possible on land not in use in urban planned areas or established heating source \nplants.  Heating  stations  are  arranged  in  established  boilers  or  reserved  land  in  urban  plans. \nPipe will be laid along the established roads in areas. Therefore, no houses will be demolished. \nEfforts  have  been  made  to  place  wastewater  treatment  subprojects  to  minimize  the  use  of \ncultivated land. The wastewater treatment subproject will occupy collective wasteland. For those \nunavoidably  affected,  the  resettlement  strategy  is  to  replace  losses  of  land,  other  assets, \ninfrastructure, and income. \n  \n5. \nHigher  than  average  compensation  rates  and  various  rehabilitation  measures  are \nproposed. GIMAR will ensure that the resettlement entitlements are provided to those affected \nbefore ground clearance. A land compensation and resettlement subsidy will be paid directly to \nthe  affected  individuals.  Compensation  for  young  crops  and  other  assets  will  be  provided \ndirectly  to  people  losing  those  assets.  Compensation  for  infrastructure  such  as  electrical  and \ncommunication fixtures will be paid to the government departments concerned, for restoration. \n \nE. \n \n6. \nGIMAR will assume overall responsibility for implementing resettlement according to the \napproved resettlement plan. A project leading group for resettlement within the PMO and PIAs \nwill  be  directly  responsible  for  coordination  of  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and \nreporting  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  for  the  Project.  Both  leading  group  and \nresettlement  offices,  each  comprising  three  staff  members  will  be  established  in  three  areas, \nwith two staff members for 12 affected counties (districts). The county resettlement offices will \ntake primary responsibility for the resettlement consultation, implementation, and timely delivery \nof entitlements, with assistance from concerned townships and villages. \n \nF. \n \n7. \nA total of 133 people (30 households) will be affected by the permanent land acquisition \nand an additional 175 are estimated to be affected by temporary land occupation. Among those \naffected  by  the  permanent  land  acquisition,  16 Mongolians  will  be  affected  by  the  Project.  No \nMongolian village is located in the project area. Since Mongolians have been closely integrated \nin  the  current  social  system  with  no  distinctive  isolation  or  barriers,  the  compensation  and \nrehabilitation  adopted  for  affected  Mongolians  will  be  the  same  as  those  for  Hans.  The  social \nsurvey shows that almost no difference of income between Mongolians and Hans among those \naffected  by  the  permanent  land  acquisition  (net  income  per  capita  of  Hans  and  Mongolians  is \nCNY3,300 and CNY3,200, respectively). \n \nNo  economically  vulnerable  people,  including  elderly  living  alone,  disabled,  and \n8. \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  are  among  those  affected  by  permanent  land  acquisition. \nAverage annual net income per capita of those affected is CNY3,549 or $438 as compared to \nthe  national  poverty  line  of  CNY637  or  $78.55  per  capita  per  year.  All  those  affected  have \nincome sources from nonagricultural activities, which range from 6% to 72% of their total gross \nincome.  \n \n\nPeople Affected by the Project  \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nMonitoring and Reporting \n\nConsultation and Grievance Redress \n\nG. \n \n9. \nThe  1998  Land  Law  and  document  28,  2004  requires  disclosure  and  consultation  with \npeople affected by a project. The people affected have been notified about the key elements of \nthe  resettlement  plan  during  meetings  and  interviews.  During  detailed  resettlement  planning, \nfurther  consultations  arranged  by  township  and  village  officials  will  discuss  specific  impacts  in \neach village and how they will be addressed.  \n \nIn  February  2006,  GIMAR  and  relevant  county  resettlement  offices  distributed  a \n10. \nresettlement information booklet to all affected townships and villages. The information booklet \ncontains  the  resettlement  scope,  expected  time  frame,  compensation  rates  for  land  and  other \nassets, other assistance to replace assets, and the grievance redress mechanisms. The county, \ntownship,  and  village  officials  will  ensure  that  any  concerns  raised  by  the  people  affected  are \nquickly addressed. \n \n11. \nIn case of grievances, all complaints will be processed based on Government Regulation \nNumber 431 on Grievance and Redress effective 1 May 2005. Affected people will submit their \noral or written complaint first to the village committee or the township resettlement office. If their \ncomplaint  is  not  settled  in  2  weeks,  they  can  seek  redress  at  the  county  resettlement  office \nwithin 1 month. If still unresolved within 2 weeks, a project leading group for resettlement within \nthe PMO/PIAs will try to achieve a solution. The final redress will be sought, if necessary, in the \ncivil courts, in accordance with the Civil Procedures Act. \n \nH. \n \n12. \nThe  plan  for  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  included  in  the \nresettlement plan. The GIMAR and PIAs will engage a qualified domestic monitoring agency to \ncarry  out  independent  resettlement  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  independent  monitoring \nagency  will  ascertain  the  extent  to  which  the  affected  people  have  (i)  received  their  full \nentitlements on time; and (ii) fully restored their livelihoods, income levels, and living standards. \nIt  will  also  conduct  a  baseline  survey  prior  to  resettlement,  semiannual  monitoring  and \nevaluation during resettlement, and evaluation 1 year after completion of land acquisition. The \nhousehold survey will include a representative number of those severely affected by loss of land \nand  those  classified  as  a  minority  and  economically  vulnerable.  The  independent  external \nmonitoring  agency  will  provide  ADB  and  GIMAR  with  copies  of  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \nreports to be prepared  twice a year during resettlement implementation and once a  year after \nresettlement completion. \n \n13. \nA  quarterly  reporting  system  will  be  established  in  the  project  resettlement  office  in \nGIMAR  and  PIAs.
