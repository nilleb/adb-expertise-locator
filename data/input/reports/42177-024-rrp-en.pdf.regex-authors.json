THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the additional financing of the Urban Primary Health \nCare Services Delivery Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant \nto be provided by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund1 under the Urban Financing \nPartnership Facility, for the additional financing of the Urban Primary Health Care Services \nDelivery Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant.  \n \n2.  The project supports improving the accessibility, quality, and use of urban primary health \ncare  (PHC)  services  through  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP). 2 The  proposed  additional \nfinancing will (i) strengthen institutions and capacity for sustainable delivery of urban PHC; \n(ii) scale up successful provision of PHC services, especially for the poor, vulnerable, women, \nand children; and (iii) provide effective support to decentralized project management. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  On 18 July 2012, Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the project in the amount of \n$50 million loan and cofinancing of $20 million equivalent, which covers 10 cities and four \nmunicipalities (9.5 million population), representing about 17% of the total 57 million urban \npopulation. The project is one of the largest PPP projects in the delivery of PHC in South Asia \nand is recognized for its longstanding innovative model of partnership between the government \ncontracting  out  health  service  delivery  and  service  providers  (mainly  nongovernment \norganizations [NGOs]).3 Although ADB has supported PHC in urban areas through the first and \nsecond Urban Primary Health Care Projects, significant investment is still needed to enhance \nservice delivery, reduce health inequalities, and strengthen institutional sustainability.4 \n \n4.  The project has been filling a vacuum created by the lack of urban public primary health \ninfrastructure  and  limited  primary  health  services  by  (i)  increasing  the  access  of  target \nbeneficiaries, especially from poor households, to the essential service package5 provided by \nservice providers; (ii) providing 25.5 million services to some 23.5 million client contacts, of which \n74% were female and 26% male at midterm review in November 2015; (iii) constructing a network \nof over 180 health facilities and 224 satellite clinics nationwide run by about 3,000 health workers; \n(iv) building experience in the management and contracting of health service delivery by service \n                                                \n1  Financing partners: The Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan, Technical Assistance Grant, and Administration of Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for \nthe Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project. Manila. \n3  PPP exists where the urban local government enters into a long-term contract with a service provider selected after \na competitive bidding process, for providing a specified set of health services in a public health facility and achieving \na specified income generation target, in which the service provider bears significant risk and management \nresponsibility.  \n4  ADB. 1996.

", "2 \nproviders;  and  (v) strengthening  procurement,  financial  management,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation systems.  \n \n5.  Experience and lessons learned from the current project. The project is demonstrating \ngood results. The independent midterm review in November 2015 observed that through the \nproject,  the  Local  Government  Division  (LGD),  the  executing  agency,  effectively  provides \nleadership to the country\u2019s efforts in finding scalable models for urban PHC delivery through urban \nlocal bodies (ULBs). The review also stated that the project merits continuation and expansion to \n(i) meet growing demand for health care in urban areas and (ii) contribute significantly to continue \nproviding leadership to support the country\u2019s plans to deliver urban PHC sustainably. A study has \nshown that the project\u2019s modality of contracting service delivery is an effective and efficient means \nto extend service coverage.6 An impact evaluation analysis identified positive effects of the \nsecond phase project on key health outcomes such as antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, \nand diarrhea and acute respiratory infection in children.7 Apart from the partnership model, the \ncurrent project has incorporated several innovative features such as (i) pilot testing of green \nclinics with solar panel renewable energy; (ii) establishing a health and demographic surveillance \nsystem to improve health information on the urban poor;8 (iii) being highly inclusive, where 80% \nof curative services are for women and girls, and 30% of services are provided free for the poor; \nand (iv) communities actively leading urban health coordination committees (UHCCs). \n \n6.  Despite this progress, further measures are needed to enhance the existing setup by \nharnessing the project\u2019s momentum. The proposed additional financing will cover the cost of the \n5-year extension to assist the government to (i) strengthen local health systems and capacities \nwith an integrated and long-term perspective toward a sustainable urban primary health sector, \n(ii) continue and scale up the PPP modality of contracting service providers, and (iii) provide \neffective support to decentralized project management. It will also expand on previous efforts in \nclimate change mitigation through solar panels for \u201cgreen clinics\u201d to include both climate change \nmitigation  and  adaptation  measures  such  as  (i)  conducting  climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessments;  (ii)  adopting  climate-resilient  infrastructure  including  solar  panels,  rain-water \nharvesting system, and flood protection drain system; (iii) training on medical waste management \nand disposal; and (iv) building capacity on climate change resilience (water and electricity \nconservation, disaster and emergency response, disease surveillance, and outbreak response).9 \n \n7.  Sustainability. The sustainability of health services will be ensured by strengthening the \nLGD\u2019s Urban Development Wing into a functional, fully staffed permanent institutional body; and \nestablishing a dedicated revenue budget head for urban primary health under the Ministry of Local \nGovernment, Rural Development and Cooperatives (MOLGRDC) from which government budget \nallocations will supplement city and municipal health financing. The ULBs will also ensure \nfinancing,  staff,  and  institutional  arrangements  to  be  sustained  accordingly.  After  project \ncompletion, health services will mainly continue to be contracted out, and where the capacity \nexists, selected local governments may deliver services by themselves. Government commitment \nand prioritization at all levels is required to ensure that adequate financing and institutions will be \nin place.  \n                                                \n6  A.

Government priorities. The additional financing will support the sector framework, the \nNational  Urban  Health  Strategy  (NUHS),  and  its  forthcoming  action  plan.10 The  continued \nassistance of ADB reflects the priorities of the government\u2019s Seventh Five-Year Plan, FY2016\u2013\nFY2020, which emphasizes the need for PHC of urban residents, including slum and street \ndwellers.11 The plan highlights the need to manage urban health and build a coalition of interests \naround one harmonized approach for greater coordination between the MOLGRDC and the \nMinistry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW). City and municipal ward level committees and \nthe development partners\u2019 forum are progressively improving coordination. Local government \nhealth officials will play a larger stewardship role for all actors in the health space (public, private, \nNGOs, charitable providers, and development partners). \n \n9.  Alignment with ADB priorities. The project will contribute to Sustainable Development \nGoals 3 and 11;12 and is aligned with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020 and country \npartnership  strategy  for  Bangladesh,  2016\u20132020,  which  identify  urban  health  as  a  specific \npriority.13 The proposed ADB support is also aligned with Strategy 2030, which emphasizes the \nneed for ADB to expand health operations to support developing member countries to achieve \nuniversal health coverage as well as facilitate PPPs and engagement with the NGOs and civil \nsociety organizations to leverage and improve results.14 \n \n10.  Additional financing eligibility criteria. The additional financing meets ADB\u2019s eligibility \ncriteria. The overall project (i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially \nsound; (ii) is accorded high priority by the government; and (iii) is consistent with the current \nproject\u2019s development objectives, the government\u2019s priorities, and ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, which prioritizes urban PHC, governance improvement, and climate- and disaster-\nresilient infrastructure and services. The current project has been rated on track since it started, \nand implementation progress and results are satisfactory. As of 6 July 2018, cumulative contract \nawards are $64.1 million (96% achieved) and disbursements are $60.2 million (90% achieved) \nagainst the net loan and grant amount of $66.9 million. Overall physical progress is 95%. The \ncurrent project has complied with all safeguard requirements and adequately managed risks. \nProject readiness for additional financing is high. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: improved health, nutrition, and family \nplanning status of the urban population, particularly the poor, women, and children, aligned with \nthe government\u2019s NUHS. The project will have the following outcome: sustainable good quality \nurban PHC services are provided in the project areas and target the poor and the needs of women \nand children.15 \n \n                                                \n10 Government of Bangladesh, MOLGRDC, Local Government Division (LGD). 2014.

Outputs \n \n12.  The project outcome will be supported through the following outputs: (i) institutional \ngovernance  and  local  government  capacity  to  deliver  urban  PHC  services  sustainably \nstrengthened; (ii) accessibility, quality, and utilization of urban PHC services (with a focus on the \npoor, women, and children) improved through PPP; and (iii) effective support for decentralized \nproject management provided. \n \n13.  Output 1: Institutional governance and local government capacity to deliver urban \nprimary  health  care  services  sustainably  strengthened.  The  additional  financing  will \n(i) strengthen the LGD\u2019s Urban Development Wing to effectively coordinate urban health; (ii) \nestablish a revenue budget head in the MOLGRDC to manage PHC and operate and maintain \nPHC facilities  sustainably;  (iii) facilitate revenue  budget  allocations  to  supplement  city  and \nmunicipal health financing; (iv) facilitate coordination among the LGD, MOHFW, and development \npartners under one harmonized approach as detailed in the NUHS; and (v) support city and \nmunicipality health departments to develop organograms and reorganization plans and integrate \nwith other determinants of health and related climate-sensitive subsectors (e.g., water, sanitation, \nand waste management) in a holistic manner to improve public health. Improved coordination will \nenhance the governance and stewardship roles of the LGD and MOHFW in key strategic areas \n(quality assurance, referral linkages, human resources, and information systems). The additional \nfinancing will continue to support mapping of all health facilities in the project areas, including \nthose under the MOHFW and private service providers, to help develop effective referral systems \nand identify gaps in coverage, particularly for the poor, slum, and floating populations. Information \nsystems will be improved by developing a real-time patient management system that will be linked \nto the national health management information system and automatically generate routine reports \nto support performance monitoring and management.  \n \n14.  Output 2: Accessibility, quality, and utilization of urban primary health care services \n(with  a  focus  on  the  poor,  women,  and  children)  improved  through  public\u2013private \npartnership. The additional financing will (i) expand coverage to additional one city and 10 \nmunicipalities;16 (ii) continue provision of PHC through contracting out to service providers; and \n(iii) construct additional eight comprehensive reproductive health care centers and 24 PHC \ncenters where such facilities do not exist in the project areas, and modernize existing facilities. \nPartnership agreements will be further refined to give greater emphasis on the quality of the \nservice provider compared to the cost proposed. The service providers will deliver essential health \nservices in the partnership areas where females use about 80% of the services.17 New medical \nequipment and in-service training for health care personnel will be provided to enhance the quality \nof services. The additional financing will continue to support semiannual independent monitoring \nof service providers\u2019 performance and quality improvement, using an Integrated Supervisory \nInstrument  covering  health  service  delivery  and  quality,  coverage  of  the  poor,  as  well  as \nmanagement  and  accounting  practices.  A  behavior  change  communication  and  marketing \nprogram aligned with an updated behavior change communication strategy will engage audiences \nthrough an innovative, interactive, multi-platform campaign;18 empower and build capacity of \nservice providers, through participatory approaches, to develop and implement local media plans; \n                                                \n16 As well as the existing 10 city corporations and four municipalities covering about 9.5 million people, the additional \nfinancing will include Chattogram City Corporation and 10 selected municipalities that have a large poor and \nvulnerable  population  and  no  medical  colleges  or  300  bed  hospitals.  In  total,  11  city  corporations  and \n14 municipalities (16.7 million people) will be covered by the project. These are listed in Annex 4 of the PAM. \n17 Additional focus on child and maternal nutrition, neonatal health, adolescent health, and noncommunicable diseases. \n18 Television, radio, newspaper, mobile, social media, website, and interpersonal communication through door-to-door, \nclinic, community theater, and community events. \n ", "5 \nand sustain the project by strengthening transition advocacy with the LGD and ULBs. To assess \nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the project, including across various geographical areas, \ncommunities, and interventions, baseline and end line surveys will be conducted. \n  \n15.  Output 3: Effective support for decentralized project management provided. The \nadditional financing will provide (i) policy support (planning and coordination) for institutional \nstrengthening actions at central and ULB levels; (ii) technical support to the project management \nunit (PMU) and ULBs in procurement, monitoring, financial management, implementing the \ngender action plan, and monitoring environmental and social safeguards; and (iii) training and \ncapacity development for the LGD, city and municipal health departments, and service providers. \nTo empower the ULBs and ensure more ownership and sustainability of urban PHC, the project \nwill further devolve the management and implementation responsibilities of the PMU in the LGD \nto project implementing units in the health departments of selected ULBs, which will receive \nfocused guidance and technical support. \n \nD.

An interministerial national \nproject steering committee, chaired by the secretary of the LGD, will continue to oversee the \noverall project implementation. In addition to the existing 14 project implementing units in ULB \nhealth departments, 11 additional units will be created to oversee implementation in project cities \nand municipalities. The UHCCs will be set up in each project city or municipality to coordinate \nfield activities and stakeholder participation, and will be chaired by ULB chief executive officers. \nCities and municipalities are divided into wards for administrative purposes, so ward UHCCs co-\nchaired  by  ward  commissioners  and  zonal  health  officers  will  be  created  and  include \nrepresentation from local stakeholders. Where standing committees with similar responsibilities \nalready exist\u2014dealing with health and water and sanitation, for example\u2014the role envisaged for \nthe UHCCs may be assigned to these committees so that parallel structures are not established. \n \n                                                \n20 Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Grant \nactivities are described in the PAM. \n21 The United Nations Population Fund will provide support in family planning and adolescent sexual reproductive \nhealth. \n ", "7 \n21.  Procurement of civil works, goods, and related services will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Packages  using  national \ncompetitive bidding may follow the government\u2019s Public Procurement Act, 2006 and Public \nProcurement Rules, 2008, with modifications agreed between the government and ADB, as set \nout in the procurement plan. Consulting services will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM, which includes an \nindicative procurement plan (footnote 19). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 April 2018\u201331 March 2023 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2023 (closing date for concessional loan: 30 September 2023; \nUCCRTF grant closing date: 31 December 2021; loan and grant closing \ndate for original financing: 30 September 2018) \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  National Project Steering Committee \nSecretary, LGD (chair)  \nRepresentatives of MOHFW, project ULBs, MOF, and Planning \nCommission (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  LGD, MOLGRDC \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  City corporations, municipal governments \n(iv)  Implementation unit  PMU under the LGD  \nProcurementa  ICB  45 contracts  $80.44 million \nNCB  40 contracts  $27.69 million \nShopping  4 contracts  $0.62 million \nConsulting services  QCBS  240 person-months  $7.99 million \nCQS  99 person-months  $0.82 million \nSSS  36 person-months  $0.32 million \nICS  296 person-months  $2.00 million \nRetroactive financing and/or advance  ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on request \ncontracting  advance contracting of procurement and consulting services, and may \nfinance up to 20% of the loan and the grant amounts for eligible \nexpenditures for operational costs incurred in the 12-month period before \nsigning of the loan and grant agreements.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n  \n22.  Economic viability. The economic rationale for investing in the additional financing lies \nin improved health outcomes through improved access to effective, efficient, and sustainable PHC \nservices. The project is pro-poor in its focus on addressing the health care needs of the urban \npoor. The economic benefits accrue from (i) savings from reduced household out-of-pocket \n ", "8 \nexpenditures and (ii) benefits from disability-adjusted life years averted. The economic internal \nrate of return on the project investment is estimated to be 9.5%, with a net present value of \n$8.5 million over a 20-year (2018\u20132037) benefit stream. The economic internal rate of return was \ntested  through  sensitivity  analysis,  which  showed  that  even  under  adverse  changes  to \nassumptions, the additional financing remains economically viable. \n \n23.  Financial sustainability. The government needs to allocate additional funds after the \nproject to sustain the current level of service coverage. A total of Tk1.3 billion per year will be \nrequired as recurrent expenditure from 2023. The financial sustainability of the project and the \nsector will be ensured through specific interventions, including the implementation of the NUHS \nand revitalizing the Urban Primary Health Care Sustainability Fund.22 The LGD is committed to \nsustaining urban PHC activities. In this regard, the LGD will develop a revenue (nondevelopment) \nbudget line for urban PHC and provide supplementary financing for PHC (salaries, administration, \noverhead, and service delivery) from block grant allocations of its budget to the ULBs. This will \nstrengthen the financial capacity of the ULBs and encourage the ULBs to improve the provision \nof PHC services. The ULBs are encouraged to raise revenue to match block grants, which will \nenable them to continue PHC services after the end of the project as well as create an incentive \nfor them to enhance PHC services. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n24.  Project-related governance risks have been assessed as part of the midterm review and \nadditional financing processing in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement and financial management \nrequirements. The assessments found that an adequate management system and staff capacity \nwere established in the PMU under the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project.23 \nIn terms of procurement rules and procedures, the proposed additional financing is rated low risk \nsince the PMU has extensive experience in procuring goods, works, and consulting services in \naccordance  with  ADB  procedures  and  requirements.  On  procurement  capacity  and \nimplementation, the risk rating is moderate due to the volume of procurement. The financial \nmanagement risk rating is moderate and remains manageable because of the measures provided \nin the financial management manual, the proposed engagement of additional staff in the PMU, \nand  conducting  independent  biennial  fiduciary  reviews,  supported  by  targeted  technical \nassistance to provide capacity development and to enhance financial monitoring and reporting \nusing accounting software. \n \n25.  Since the additional financing will expand geographic coverage and aims to develop \nsustainable capacity in ULBs for delivering basic health services, the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan makes several recommendations to strengthen capacity both in the executing \nand implementing agencies and to improve procedures for efficient management and effective \ncontrol in financial management and procurement.24  \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  LGD,  MOLGRDC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \n                                                \n22 Government of Bangladesh, MOLGRDC, LGD.

Poverty and Social \n \n27.  The project will continue to ensure that all urban citizens have access to quality and \nequitable health care in a healthy and safe environment. In addition to the essential services \nprovided, the additional financing will focus more on strengthening the present service delivery \nsystem, building on the good results of the current project, meeting unmet demands, and \ndeveloping institutional self-reliance. Counseling for women, adolescents, and couples\u2014as well \nas pre-marriage counseling, addressing noncommunicable diseases, reducing climate-induced \nailments, and building and promoting gender-friendly structures\u2014will receive special attention. \nThe  capacity  building,  behavior  change,  and  outreach  project  components  will  focus  on \nstrengthening the abilities of government and partner service providers to improve access to \nquality health services in slums and impoverished areas with a focus on the poor, women, and \nchildren. The gender action plan of this gender equity-categorized project has been enhanced to \npromote gender equity and respond effectively to the needs voiced by women in underserved \nurban areas.25 \n \nD.  Safeguards  \n \n28.  Environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  current \nproject\u2019s compliance with the safeguard requirements has been satisfactory and risks have been \nwell-managed. The project remains category B for environment, and will continue to construct \nnew health care centers, improve existing facilities, and enhance climate change resilience and \nmedical  waste  management. It  is  not  expected  to  have  significant  or  irreversible  negative \nenvironmental impacts during construction or operation. Any environmental risks will be effectively \naddressed through proper mitigation measures with the updated environmental assessment and \nreview framework that has been prepared and disclosed because land and sites for project civil \nworks will be identified by the time implementation begins. The project remains category C for \nboth involuntary resettlement and tribes, minor races, ethnic sects, and community peoples.26 No \nland acquisition will be involved because land required will be either government-owned or \ndonated voluntarily. Existing project areas do not overlap with any areas inhabited by tribes, minor \nraces, ethnic sects, and community peoples. The project will screen new health care center sites \nto ensure social safeguard impacts do not occur.27 \n  \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  The overall risk assessment is moderate without mitigation and low with mitigation. \nSignificant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 24). The integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nSome city corporations and municipalities  The project will sensitize the importance of urban health and provide \nhave insufficient funds, human resources,  guidance and capacity building to enhance ownership by the ULBs \nand leadership to implement programs and  and their commitments to increase resources for urban health. \nstrategies for strengthening pro-poor urban \nprimary health care delivery services. \n                                                \n25 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Groups or population identified as indigenous peoples within the context of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nwill be referred to in this document as tribes, minor races, ethnic sects, and community peoples (following the request \nof the Government of Bangladesh). \n27 Resettlement, Tribes, Minor Races, Ethnic Sects, and Community Peoples Planning Framework set out in the PAM. \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCompeting needs and politically driven  Implementation of the NUHS Action Plan and the establishment of a \ninterests in allocating resources to the ULBs.  dedicated revenue budget will create fiscal space for urban health. \nHigh turnover of service providers\u2019  (i) The PMU will have additional staff and technical specialists to \nmanagement, clinical, and counterpart staff.  responsively administer service providers\u2019 contracts.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n30.  The government and the LGD, MOLGRDC have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n31.  The government and the LGD, MOLGRDC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement, grant agreement, and project agreement. \nTo ensure institutional and financial sustainability for urban PHC, disbursement of a total of \n$20,000,000 of the concessional loan (approximately 18% of the loan amount) allocated for works \nfor constructing or upgrading of health care centers under output 2 will be subject to disbursement \nconditions with respect to the completion of six institutional actions.28 \n \nV.
