An initial environmental examination was undertaken.  \n   \nProject  The  Project  will  provide  credit  and  training  to  about  66,000  farm \nDescription                households in 26 counties of five municipalities in central and southern \n  Shanxi. Of these, 11 are poverty counties and 12 are on the priority list \n  for  treatment  of  accelerated  soil  erosion  in  the  PRC.  The  Project \n  comprises four components (i) transition to high-value farm production by \n  adopting  technologies  and  practices  that  ensure  environmental \n  sustainability and increase farm income; (ii) strengthening of farm\u2013market \n  linkages  by  supporting  on-farm  and  industrial  agroprocessing  and \n  marketing of high-value products; (iii) capacity-building and training of \n  farmers, farmer associations, and technical support agencies to support \n  high-value production and processing of farm products; and (iv) project \n  management to support efficient project implementation. To keep project \n  implementation manageable, each participating county will take up two of \n  the three activities in the first component\u2014perennial crops, annual crops, \n  and livestock. Structured criteria were used to select project counties, \n  sites, and activities. \n   \n  Most project counties have a variety of marketing channels with varying \n  degrees of efficiency. Under the Project, the participating farmers will \n  make the transition to high-value production systems and connect to the \n  value chain for the first time. By involving 24 agro-enterprises, the Project \n  will  support  beneficiary  households  to  establish  production  bases, \n  expand  their  on-farm  processing  capacity,  and  connect  with  agro-\n  enterprises through formal contractual arrangements. Participating agro-\n  enterprises will provide subloan guarantees to contracted farmers. To \n  minimize postharvest losses and improve storage-life, the Project will \n  support  on-farm  processing  and  farmer-managed  drying  rooms.  Five \n  agro-enterprises  will  receive  credit  to  increase  storage  capacity  and \n  processing operations.   \n   \n  The Project will build the capacity of farmers, their associations, and staff \nof  technical  support  agencies  (TSAs)  to  adopt  high-value  and \nenvironmentally sustainable production systems that will increase farmer \nincomes  and  farm  productivity,  and  improve  food  safety  and  quality. \nADB's Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility (WFPF) and the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund \n(GDCF) will provide grants to pilot-test creative interventions. The WFPF-\nfunded activities will demonstrate the viability of more productive and \n ", "ii   \nefficient irrigation techniques, and support farmers to adapt to climate \nchange impacts. Poor farmers will be provided with subsidies to adopt \nwater-saving  technologies  to  showcase  the  efficiency  and  economic \nbenefits of such interventions. Skills training will help farmers reduce \ndependence on increasingly scarce water resources. The GDCF grant \nwill  facilitate  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  by  (i)  setting  up  a \nrevolving fund for microfinance; (ii) organizing self-help groups linked to \nexisting farmer associations to access markets; (iii) providing training on \ntechnical,  marketing,  alternative  income-generation  activities,  and \nleadership; and (iv) building capacity to ensure sustainability of these \nactivities. \n   \nRationale  Shanxi has only about 3.8 million hectares of dependable arable land\u2014of \n  modest quality and productivity\u2014for its 23 million rural population. Low \n  rainfall, high evaporation, frequent natural disasters, and soil erosion lead \n  to instability in agricultural production. After about 30 years of reforms, \n  the agricultural service system, farmers' technical capacity, and women\u2019s \n  economic participation have improved. However, the nature of extensive \n  and scattered small-scale agriculture has not changed significantly. Most \n  farmers continue to practice traditional agriculture mainly growing wheat \n  and maize that generate low incomes and require extensive use of water \n  and agrochemicals. Similarly, the patterns of free-range livestock grazing \n  and untreated disposal of animal waste adds to soil and water pollution. \n  This  agricultural  system  is  unsustainable  and  damaging  to  the \n  environment,  and  keeps  most  farmers  in  poverty.  Most  farmers  also \n  remain largely unorganized and cannot take full advantage of market and \n  rural finance opportunities. In addition, women\u2019s participation remains \n  marginal, and their social and economic rights are usually ignored.  \n   \n  One of the main constraints to converting traditional farming to high-value \n  farming is access to formal credit. The agricultural lending institutions \n  have (i) a limited range of products, (ii) inadequate experience with long-\n  term  lending,  and  (iii)  weak  capacity  to  assess  credit  risk.  These \n  constraints, coupled with the absence of market-led interest rates, lead to \n  market failure, and the inability of agro-enterprises and farmers to access \n  formal financial services. \n   \n  The Project will address these constraints and provide financing for high-\nvalue  farming,  agroprocessing,  product  quality  and  safety, \nenvironmentally  sustainable  farm  practices  by  adopting  water-saving \nirrigation  techniques,  microfinance  to  poor  women,  and  improved \ncapacity of farmers and TSAs. These initiatives are consistent with the \nGovernment's 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) and ADB's PRC country \npartnership strategy, 2008\u20132010. \n   \nImpact and  The  anticipated  project  impact  is  reduced  rural  poverty  and  the \nOutcome  development of sustainable agriculture sector in 26 counties of Shanxi. \n  The  project  outcome  will  be  increased  farm  productivity  and  higher \n  household income resulting from high-value agricultural production by \n  adopting  appropriate  and  environmentally  sound  technologies  and \n  practices, value addition through processing, efficient market access, and \n  improved food quality and safety in the project area. \n   \n ", "    iii\nProject Investment  The  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $189.3  million, \nPlan   including  taxes  and  duties  of  $17.6  million,  contingencies  of \n$0.8  million,  and  financial  charges  during  implementation  of \n$1.3 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A  loan  of  $100,000,000,  about  52.8%  of  the  total  cost,  from  ADB\u2019s \n  ordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \n  offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 26-year \n  term, including a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in \n  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment \n  charge  of  0.15%  on  undisbursed  funds,  and  such  other  terms  and \n  conditions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The WFPF will provide a \n  grant  of  $500,000  equivalent,  0.3%  of  the  total  project  cost,  to \ndemonstrate  the  viability  of  more  efficient  water-saving  irrigation \ntechniques and strengthen capacity of farmers and TSAs. The GDCF will \nprovide a grant of $195,000 equivalent, 0.1% of the total project cost, to \nset  up  a  revolving  fund  for  microfinance  for  poor  women  and  build \ncapacity of beneficiaries and implementing agencies.

SPG  through  its  Shanxi  Finance \nDepartment (SFD) will provide loan proceeds to five municipal finance \nbureaus (MFBs) in the participating municipalities. The MFBs will make \nloan proceeds available to the respective county finance bureaus (CFBs). \nThe CFBs in participating counties will extend subloans, from  the ADB \nloan  funds,  to  final  borrowers,  subject  to  approvals  by  appropriate \nauthorities under subloan agreements. The terms and conditions for the \nloan proceeds transferred from the Government to SFD and the MFBs \nand CFBs will be the same as those applied to ADB loan, with SPG and \nCFBs bearing the foreign exchange and credit risks, respectively, for the \nloan  proceeds  made  available  to  them.  Terms  and  conditions  of  the \nsubloans  will  include  (i)  the  interest  rate  will  not  be  lower  than  the \nprevailing commercial rate of interest for equivalent types of loans; (ii) the \nrepayment period will be based on the cash flow of the subborrower's \nprojected future revenue, including a grace period not exceeding that of \n ", "iv   \nthe  ADB  loan;  and  (iii)  if  the  subborrower  is  an  agro-enterprise,  the \nsubborrower will bear the foreign exchange and interest rate variation \nrisks. The margin between the cost of funds from ADB and subloan \nborrowers will be retained by the MFB or CFB responsible for the subloan \nto cover administrative costs and credit risks.  \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2016 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  31 December 2015 \n   \nImplementation  SPG, the Executing Agency for the Project, will coordinate and supervise \nArrangements  all implementation activities through a project leading group. SPG will set \nup the project management office (PMO) at the Poverty Alleviation and \nDevelopment Office in Taiyuan. The PMO will coordinate and oversee \nimplementation of all activities on a day-to-day basis. The PMO will (i) \norganize,  coordinate,  and  guide  related  departments  in  project \nmunicipalities and counties for effective implementation of the Project; (ii) \nprepare an annual work program and budget; (iii) organize procurement; \n(iv)  maintain  consolidated  accounts,  including  developing  a  project \nperformance management system to track all financial transactions with \nsubborrowers; (v) prepare and submit to ADB withdrawal applications \nand statements of expenditure through SFD; (vi) monitor physical and \nfinancial progress, including benefits flow to intended beneficiaries, and \nsubmit reports to SPG and ADB; and (vii) liaise with SPG through SFD \nfor reporting to the Ministry of Finance and ADB.  \n \nThe municipal and county project implementation units (PIUs), one in \neach of the five municipalities and 26 counties, will assist the PMO. The \nunits  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  all  project \nactivities  under  the  overall  guidance  of  the  PMO.  The  provincial \nenvironmental  protection  bureaus  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring \ncompliance with national environmental standards, rules, and regulations. \nThe CFBs, as implementing agencies for the five agro-enterprises, will \nsupervise  the  financing  and  monitoring  activities.  The  PMO  will \ncoordinate capacity-building activities of the TSAs, which will, in turn, \nprovide  technical  support  and  training  to  beneficiary  farmers. \nEnvironmental monitoring of soil and water resources, and agrochemicals \nwill be undertaken by the relevant provincial environmental protection \nand water resources bureaus. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement of goods and works will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Contracts and mode of procurement envisaged under the Project are \nindicated in the procurement plan. National competitive bidding procedures \nwill be in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), \nsubject to modifications agreed with ADB. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all \nprocurement documents and contracts. \n   \n ", "    v\nConsulting  The  Project  will  provide  120  person-months  of  national  consulting \nServices  services  for  project  management  and  training.  SPG  will  finance  and \n  engage  five  individual  consultants  to  (i)  introduce  national  good \n  agriculture practices (ChinaGAP) to promote product quality and safety; \n  (ii) build capacity of farmers and their associations to adopt improved \n  production  and  marketing  practices;  (iii)  train  TSAs  in  gender \n  development, monitoring of soil and water quality, safe disposal of animal \n  waste, and environmental impact assessment; and (iv) support the PMO \n  and PIUs to prepare and implement project monitoring and supervision, \n  bidding  and  procurement  documents,  midterm  review,  and  project \n  completion  report.  To  implement  WFPF  activities,  three  individual \n  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  25  person-months\u2014one  international \n  (water resources specialist, 5 person-months) and two national (irrigation \n  specialist for 12 person-months and hydrogeologist for 8 person-months). \n  A local nongovernment organization will be engaged using the single-\n  source  selection  procedure  to  implement  GDCF  activities;  a  national \n  individual consultant will be engaged for 2.5 person-months to monitor \n  and evaluate GDCF activities. All recruitment financed under the WFPF \n  and GDCF grants will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \n  on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction,  increased  farm \nand Beneficiaries  productivity  and  incomes,  employment  generation,  sustainable \n  environmental management of soil and water resources, expansion in \nhigh-value  agricultural  production,  development  of  rural  finance  and \nmicrofinance initiatives, and improved capacity of participating farmers \nand staff of TSAs. Of the 26 project counties, 11 are classified as poor, \nand  6  of  the  11  are  national  priority  poverty  counties.  In  all  project \ncounties,  households  considered  as  poor  by  national  and  provincial \nstandards  will  participate  in  the  Project.  Over  66,000  beneficiaries, \nincluding  about  40,000  \u201cabsolute  poor\u201d  and  26,000  \u201clow-income\u201d \nhouseholds,  will  be  supported  by  the  Project.  The  Project  will  pay \nparticular  attention  to  households  headed  by  women,  identified  as \nvulnerable.  The  average  annual  household  incomes  is  expected  to \nincrease by 30%, or about CNY6,000. The \u201cabsolute poor\u201d households \n(with a per capita annual income of less than CNY1,000) can expect to \ndouble their income. Higher incomes coupled with increased production \ncapacity  and  enhanced  technical  skills  will  allow  vulnerable  poor \nhouseholds to move and stay out of poverty. \n \nFinancial internal rates of return for all types of investments range from \n15% to 20%, and are above the estimated weighted average cost of \ncapital which is about 5.1%. The overall economic internal rate of return \nof the Project is estimated to be 19.5%. The sensitivity analysis indicates \nthat the Project is robust with respect to declines in net incremental \nbenefits and rise in costs from individual activities. \n   \n ", "vi   \nRisks and  At the macro level, the principal risks to attaining project objectives relate \nAssumptions  to  stable  policies  for  private  sector  agricultural  production  and \n  processing, sustainable agricultural development, and poverty reduction \nin rural areas. The financial sector's failure to provide investment capital \nto farmers and agro-enterprises is being addressed in the short-term \nthrough  the  Project.  In  the  long-term,  sustainable  agricultural \ndevelopment  will  be  constrained  unless  requisite  policy  and  financial \nsector  reforms  are  carried  out.  At  the  project  level,  the  ability  and \nwillingness  of  beneficiaries  to  respond  to  market  signals  and \nopportunities will be critical to its success. This risk will be mitigated \nthrough farmer training, particularly to develop effective farmer\u2013market \nlinkages. The involvement of 24 agro-enterprises in the Project will be \ninstrumental in mitigating market risk. Risks relating to the marketing of \nfresh and processed products are minimal, given the strong domestic and \nglobal  demand  and  price  competitiveness  of  the  PRC's  agricultural \nproducts.  The  technical  risk  in  production  activities  is  limited,  as  the \nparticipating farmers have some prior experience in growing/raising the \nplanned  crops/livestock.  Farmers  will  also  be  able  to  adopt  new \ntechnologies and cropping practices with support from advisory services \nand training. \n \n \n \n ", "111o  00'E 114o  00'E\nSHANXI INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL\nDEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nYanggao\nDatong\n40 o 00'N I N N E R     M O N G O L I A 40 o 00'N\nYouyu Qiaocun\nShuozhou Sanggan River\nLingqiu\nShenchi\nFanshi\nRiver) Baode\nw \nYello Kelan Yuanping\n(\nHe H E B E I\nHuang  Xinghou\nJingle\nS H A N X I\nShouyang\nGujiao\nTAIYUAN Yangquan\nJIAOCHENG Yuchi\nLishi YUCHI\nLIULIN LISHI\nS H A A N X I Taigu\nFenyang WENSHUI TAIGU\nMucun\nQi Xian\nZHONGYANG\nXiaoyi PINGYAOQI XIAN\nPingyao\nWutong\nYushe Zuoquan\nJIAOKOU\nQin Xian\nYONGHE XIXIAN\nFENXI Huozhou LICHENG\nQIN XIAN Licheng\nDANING Pu Xian River Qinyuan Lucheng\nFen  HONGDONG Tunilu PINGSHUN\nPingshun\n36 o 00'N Linfen Changzhi 36 o 00'N\nXIANGFEN N\nJinshanJINSHAN\n0 50 100\nHouma\nJincheng\nWANRONG Kilometers\nLINYI YANHU Project County\nYunchen Provincial Capital\nYONGJI City/Town\nYongji National Road\nH E N A N\nProvincial Road\nRailway\nRiver\nCounty Boundary\nProvincial Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n111o  00'E 114o  00'E\n09-0989 HR", "         \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of grants to be provided by the Multi-Donor Trust Funds \nunder the Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF)1 and the Gender and Development \nCooperation Fund (GDCF)2 to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shanxi Integrated \nAgricultural Development Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  In August 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a project preparatory \ntechnical assistance to formulate the Project.3 This report is based on the analysis of the \ntechnical assistance, feasibility study reports of the Government, findings of ADB missions, and \ndiscussions with officials and stakeholders.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  Shanxi province is located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River and the eastern part \nof the Loess Plateau.4 In the east of Shanxi are the Taihang mountains where the Loess \nPlateau and the North China Plain meet. The Yellow River forms the western and southern \nborders of the province. The fertile Fen River valley, centrally located in the Taiyuan basin, is \nthe economic hub of the province. Shanxi products have ready access to markets due to the \nprovince\u2019s location in the PRC. Shanxi has an area of about 156,000 square kilometers (km2) \nand a population of about 34 million (2006 estimate). It has 119 counties, 57 of which are \nclassified as poor. Of these 57 poverty counties, 35 are national priority poverty counties as \ndetermined  by  the  State  Council.5  In  2008,  the  average  annual  per  capita  income  was \nCNY2,164 in 35 counties and CNY2,552 in 57 counties; the provincial average was CNY3,666. \nThe disparity between urban and rural incomes is wide. In 2008, the average annual per capita \nurban income was more than triple (CNY13,119) that of rural income (CNY4,097).  \n \n4.  Shanxi is richly endowed with natural resources, especially coal, coal-bed methane, \nbauxite, refractory clay, pearlite, and gallium. It is the largest coal-producing province in the \nPRC, mining over 25% of the country's annual total of 2.5 billion tons. Despite limited cultivable \nland, the agriculture sector has retained its place as the major source of employment, engaging \nabout 6.4 million people in 2006, the highest among all sectors.6 In about 30 years of reform, \nsignificant progress has been made in agricultural input supply, processing, transportation, \nindustrial production, and production bases. The agricultural service system, farmers\u2019 production \ncapacity, and women\u2019s economic participation have also improved. However, the nature of \n                                                 \n1  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. \n2  Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n3\n ADB. 2007.

Manila.  \n4\n  The loess plateau is the highland area in north-central PRC, covering much of Shanxi, northern Henan, Shaanxi, \nand eastern Gansu provinces (the middle part of the Yellow River basin). Averaging about 1,200 meters in \nelevation and covering some 400,000 square kilometers, it is the world's largest loess plateau. The loess plateau is \nparticularly susceptible to erosion by water. \n5  In 2007, the PRC\u2019s national priority poverty county list was based on a standard that identified a person as \n\u201cabsolute poor\u201d if annual per capita income was below CNY786, and as \u201clow-income\u201d if less than CNY1,067. In \n2008, these two categories were merged to have a unified poverty line set at CNY1,196/capita/year. These poverty \nlines are much lower than the international standard of $1.25/capita/day, which is currently equivalent to about \nCNY3,200/capita/year.    \n6  National Bureau of Statistics. 2008. China Statistical Yearbook. Beijing. \n ", "2            \nextensive and scattered small-scale agriculture has not changed significantly. The majority of \nfarmers practice traditional agriculture mainly growing wheat and maize, which generate low \nincomes per unit of land and require extensive use of agrochemicals and irrigation water. \nSimilarly, the practice of free-range livestock grazing and untreated disposal of animal waste \nadds to soil and water pollution. This agricultural system has almost no potential to help most \nfarmers out of the poverty trap. Most farmers also remain largely unorganized and cannot take \nfull  advantage  of  market  and  rural  finance  opportunities.  Some  farmer  cooperatives, \nassociations, and other rural economic organizations have recently emerged.7 However, these \ndevelopments are inadequate for building modern agriculture. In addition, women\u2019s participation \nremains marginal, and their social and economic rights are usually ignored.  \n \n5.  During 2007\u20132008, surging inflation in the PRC was due mainly to rising food prices. In \nFebruary 2008, according to the Bureau of Statistics, inflation was 8.7%\u2014the highest since May \n1996. The price of pork rose 63%, fresh vegetables 46%, and cooking oil 41% compared with \nFebruary 2007. Rising urban incomes and international commodity prices, severe weather, and \nconversion of food crops to biofuel significantly increased demand for food in the PRC and the \nrest of the world. The world\u2019s food stocks were the lowest they had been in the last 30 years \nand international food commodity prices rose 40%\u201380% within 2 years culminating in the food \ncrisis in 2008. As the global financial crisis accelerated in late 2008, the inflationary pressure \neased but large-scale industrial layoffs in the southern provinces sent over 20 million migrant \nworkers back to the rural areas. Many of Shanxi's migrant workers returned home in late 2008. \nAll these factors have put added pressure on agricultural production systems to ensure food \nsecurity and environmental sustainability in the PRC and especially in Shanxi where land and \nwater resources are scarce. \n \n6.  To address the widening income gap between rural and urban areas, and between the \neastern, central, and western regions of the country, the Government has planned significant \ninvestments including replacing grain production with high-value crops and livestock to increase \nrural incomes, reduce poverty, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts on soil and water \nresources. Along with promoting the transition to modern and high-value production systems, \ntechnical services, processing, and marketing will be carried out by private agro-enterprises. \nThis approach is fully consistent with the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), which calls \nfor sustainable crop production, diversification, water conservation, environmental management, \nand economic growth. To mitigate the effects of lost jobs in the industry sector and stimulate the \nslowing  economy  due  to  the  global  financial  crisis,  the  Government  has  embarked  on  an \nambitious $585 billion stimulus plan. In part, this plan will generate demand in rural areas and \ncreate jobs, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises, including agro-enterprises.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  Limited and Deteriorating Resource Base. Shanxi has only 3.8 million hectares (ha) \nof arable land\u2014of modest quality and productivity\u2014for its 23 million rural population. Located on \nthe Loess Plateau, more than 60% of the total land area is vulnerable to erosion. On average, \nthe erosion rate is 3,000 ton/km2. In addition to the inherent low fertility of loess soils, other \nenvironmental problems are caused by (i) the declining organic matter content of soils because \nof  inappropriate  cultivation  practices  leaving  soils  susceptible  to  rain  and  wind  erosion, \n(ii) overuse  of  fertilizers  and  pesticides,  (iii)  alkaline  wastelands,  and  (iv)  damage  from \nwindborne dust from coal mining. Low rainfall, high evaporation, and frequent natural disasters \n                                                 \n7  The Government promulgated a law on farmers' specialized cooperatives in July 2007. The law is one of several \npolicies related to agriculture sector development that stipulate requirements and support instruments for the \ncreation and development of farmer associations.  \n ", "    3\nlead to instability in agricultural production. From 1997 to 2007, arable land was reduced by \nmore than 604,000 ha due to rapid infrastructure developments and conversion of land from \nfarming to forestry, grassland, and orchards. About 241,000 ha are on slopes with gradients \nmore than 25 degrees, where only perennial crops, soil-binding trees, and shrubs are permitted. \n \n8.  Across the province, shortages of water (13% of the PRC average) arise from low \naverage  annual  rainfall  (400\u2013650  millimeters)  concentrated  in  July\u2013September  and  high \nevaporation rates. Water resources in Shanxi have been declining since 1956. From 2000 to \n2007, water availability decreased by 5% annually; from 8.2 billion cubic meters (m3) to about \n7.0 billion m3. The proportion of water available for irrigation decreased from 95% in the 1950s \nto 59% in 2007. A low water utilization rate, due to severe waste, is another factor contributing \nto  reduced  water  availability.  Flood  irrigation  is  the  most  common  practice.  On  average,  \n3,500 m3 of water is used to irrigate 1 ha, which is 3\u20137 times more water than used in drip \nirrigation and other water-saving methods. Water pollution is another source of land degradation \ncaused by discharge of contaminants, indiscriminate use of agrochemicals, and nondegradable \nagricultural waste such as plastic mulch. The utilization ratio of nitrogenous fertilizers is around \n30%, which is 20% lower than most industrialized countries. Water quality in rivers is severely \npolluted, and more than 1,000 villages have difficulty securing good quality water. Groundwater \ncontamination has been exacerbated by the extensive use of chemical fertilizers and leaching of \nanimal waste. The potential climate change impact can further aggravate the already precarious \navailability of water resources in Shanxi. \n \n9.  High-density coal mining is another major cause of land degradation. Coal waste cover \nhas reduced average crop productivity by about 250 kilograms/ha, causing a production loss of \nmore than 6.7 million tons/year. Coal mining is also rapidly reducing water resources in the \nprovince. It takes 2.48 m3 of water to process 1 ton of coal. To maintain current coal mining at \nabout 600 million tons/year, about 1.5 billion m3 of water, or one fifth of the total water resources \nin the province, are required. Since 1999, more than 26,000 ha of potentially irrigable land have \nbecome dry because of coal mining. The consequent annual economic loss caused by coal \nmining is estimated to be $675 million (CNY4.6 billion); about 2.8% of Shanxi's gross domestic \nproduct. A detailed sector analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n10.  Agricultural and Environmental Sustainability. In Shanxi, the environment places \nserious  limitations  on  agricultural  development  due  to  low  rainfall,  variable  elevation,  soil \nerosion, and degradation caused in part by overuse and poor management. Recent attempts at \nimproving environmental conditions have led to significant and visible development, i.e., tree \nand  vegetation  cover  on  hills,  along  roadsides,  and  in  urban  areas.  Improvement  in  coal \nproduction technology and closure of older mines has led to reduced pollution at many sites. \n \n11.  The topography and consequent climatic variability in Shanxi provide an appropriate \nenvironment for diversified agricultural production, using modern and environmentally neutral \ntechnologies. These include cultivation of perennial crops on terraced slopes over 25 degrees, \ndecreasing the use of chemical fertilizers with organic manure and of pesticides with integrated \npest management (IPM), water conservation, adoption of cleaner production technologies in \ncoal mining to reduce water pollution, rotational grazing, stall feeding for livestock production, \nand similar practices. Many farmers and agro-enterprises, through collaboration in production \nbases, already have some experience in environmentally sustainable production of livestock, \ncrops, and vegetables. Some agro-enterprises either have in-house capacity or engage skilled \nstaff from qualified institutions to assist farmers in producing high-value vegetables safe from \nresidual effects of pesticides as well as certified livestock products. Since higher quality farm \nproducts  are  priced  at  a  premium,  potential  exists  for  expansion  of  these  production \n ", "4            \ntechnologies and practices to farmers on a wider scale. This requires technical support from \nvarious government institutions and agencies, many of which require capacity-building to fully \nrespond to the needs of farmers.  \n \n12.  Realization  of  Market  Opportunities.  The  PRC  is  the  world\u2019s  largest  producer  of \ncereals, vegetables, fruits, eggs, meat, and aquatic products. It is also one of the world\u2019s largest \nconsumers of food, including meat products. The PRC's annual consumption accounts for 51% \nof the global production of pork, 33% of rice, 19% of poultry, and 12% of beef. Though just 30% \nof the food consumed is currently processed, compared with 80% in industrialized countries, the \nmarket for processed foods is growing rapidly, especially in urban areas. Urbanization and rising \ndisposable  incomes  have  brought  about  significant  increases  in  demand  for  agricultural \nproducts, and a shift in demand to a wider range of higher quality and safer produce and \nprocessed products.  \n \n13.  For many food products (particularly processed fruits, vegetables, and meat products), \nShanxi is a net importer from other provinces. However, the province has outperformed the \nPRC as a whole in export growth in a number of niche markets. Exports of apple products from \nShanxi have grown dramatically, increasing from 32,540 tons in 2003 to more than 85,000 tons \nin 2007, an average annual growth rate of 36%. By comparison, PRC exports of fresh apples \n(the predominant fruit export) grew by 9.7% from 609,045 tons to 804,226 tons in the same \nperiod. The PRC's apple exports are projected to grow to over 943,000 tons by 2015 (an annual \naverage growth rate of 3.8%). With the development of rural infrastructure, and production of \nhigh-quality apples, the international competitiveness of the PRC's fresh and processed apple \nproducts will be strengthened, providing an opportunity for continued expansion in production \nand export.  \n \n14.  The realization of these opportunities will depend to a large extent on the ability of \nShanxi farmers to make the transition to producing high-value and safe food products. The \ninappropriate use of agrochemicals can adversely affect the quality of produce sold to agro-\nenterprises for processing and export to international markets, where demand for raw material \ntraceability is gaining momentum both to ensure food safety and reduce adverse environmental \nimpacts. A number of food shipments from the PRC were refused entry into the United States in \nthe first half of 2007, and several frozen foodstuffs were removed from supermarket shelves in \nJapan in January 2008 following the discovery of traces of banned insecticides. In August 2008, \nmelamine-tainted  milk  made  thousands  of  Chinese  infants  sick  and  several  died  of \ncomplications.  Later,  melamine  was  also  traced  to  animal  feed  and  eggs.  As  a  result, \nindustrialized countries are paying greater attention to the quality and safety of food imports \nfrom the PRC. The Government has declared food safety its high priority. To address these \nconcerns and promote good agricultural practices (GAP), the PRC has initiated the ChinaGAP \nprogram,  which  will  eventually  match  standards  set  for  certified  producers  supplying \ninternational  markets  (GlobalGAP).  For  export  markets,  compliance  with  the  World  Trade \nOrganization standards is critical.8 While higher costs are associated with meeting the needs of \nincreasingly discerning domestic and international consumers, an equally significant potential \nprice premium can be earned by Shanxi farmers and agro-enterprises prepared to make the \nrequisite investments in upgrading their processing technology. More detailed farm investment \nand income analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix B. \n15.  Limited Access to Rural Finance. One of the main constraints to the transition from \ntraditional agriculture to high-value farming in the PRC generally, and in Shanxi particularly, is \n                                                 \n8  This will also comply with international standards already achieved by agro-enterprises through hazard analysis \nand critical control point and International Standards Organization (ISO) certification. \n ", "    5\naccess  to  credit.  The  agricultural  lending  institutions  have  (i)  a  limited  range  of  financial \nproducts, (ii) inadequate experience with long-term lending, (iii) weak capacity to effectively \nassess credit risk and adjust products and services accordingly, and (iv) issues with land tenure \nand fixed asset valuation that prevent effective loan collateralization. These constraints, coupled \nwith the absence of market-led interest rates, have led to market failure. \n \n16.  Farmers (especially women) and small businesses have limited access to formal credit. \nMost farm expenditures are financed by farmers' savings, and most loans are obtained from \ninformal sources (e.g., relatives, friends, money lenders, and pawnbrokers). The small size and \nshort-term nature of these loans precludes investment in assets that have a long payback \nperiod. Also, lending by state-owned commercial banks and credit cooperatives is still largely \nguided by government policy that fixes the interest rate financial institutions can charge. On \naverage, only a third of rural households have access to formal sources of credit. The failure of \nthe financial sector to support agriculture and agribusiness development means that market \nopportunities\u2014and the associated adoption of economically and environmentally sustainable \nagricultural production systems\u2014are not being realized. Unless this financing gap is filled, \nfarmers and agro-enterprises risk losing their share in international markets in the face of \nincreasing competition from other fruit- and vegetable-producing and -processing countries.  \n \n17.  The problem is compounded for agro-enterprises, which are mostly small and medium-\nsized enterprises. Agro-enterprises generally have to mobilize their own capital, which is far \nmore  difficult  in  rural  areas.  They  face  similar  borrowing  problems  as  farmers,  including \ninadequate collateral and short loan repayment periods. In addition, agro-enterprises often have \nto provide inputs and technical support to farmers in order to purchase produce of sufficient \nquality for processing. Therefore, agro-enterprises are squeezed at both ends of the value \nchain. Agro-enterprises experience difficulty justifying financing due to their uneven accounting \npractices  and  weak  management  capacity.  Projects  that  are  able  to  bridge  this  gap  and \ndemonstrate to financial institutions that both farmers and agro-enterprises are creditworthy\u2014\neven for long-term and unsecured loans\u2014build system confidence and capacity to broaden \naccess to financial services in rural areas. The rural finance sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n18.  To address the income gap between rural and urban areas and between the eastern, \ncentral, and western regions of the country, investments to promote high-value crops and \nlivestock are effective means of increasing rural incomes and reducing poverty. Processing and \nmarketing of increased production, and product quality and safety can be carried out by private \nsector enterprises with access to favorable financing to expand processing capacity. For poor \nfarmers, local government agencies will be required to provide credit for planting materials, \nirrigation  infrastructure,  and  breeding  stock.  In  the  absence  of  effective  rural  financial \ninstitutions, the finance bureaus will need to provide investment finance for these inputs. A \ntransition  to  high-value  crops  and  more  sustainable  production  practices\u2014water-saving \nirrigation, IPM, appropriate use of agrochemicals, and safe disposal of animal waste\u2014can \nincrease household incomes and preserve arable land and water resources. Therefore, an \nintegrated agricultural development approach is required to optimize Shanxi's land and water \nresources, reduce poverty, and improve farm productivity and incomes. \n \n19.  Government Policies and ADB\u2019s Country Strategy. In the PRC's 11th Five-Year Plan \n(2006\u20132010), the objective is to achieve greater balance between (i) urban and rural incomes, \n(ii) geographic regions, (iii) economic and social development, (iv) increasingly market-oriented \neconomy, and (v) economic growth with environmental sustainability. To highlight the emphasis \non sustainable agricultural development, the Government published its Policy Document on \n ", "6            \nModern Agriculture in January 2007.9 This initiated the New Socialist Countryside Policy to \nredress the slow rate of rural income growth and poor socioeconomic conditions of the PRC's \n750 million rural population. The document recognizes that the persistent decline in the quality \nof natural resources and the deteriorating environment need to be addressed by changing the \nnature of agricultural development. The Government's plan and policy are in line with ADB's \nexisting  strategic  objectives  and  operations  in  the  PRC  outlined  in  its  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2008\u20132010.10 ADB\u2019s future operations in the PRC will focus on rural development, \nenvironmental  sustainability,  energy  conservation,  urban  development,  and  regional \ncooperation. ADB will mobilize more resources and develop diversified instruments to meet the \ndemand for balanced development among regions, and between rural and urban areas. ADB \nwill contribute to strengthen knowledge in policy, law, and governance reforms. \n \n20.  External Assistance. Among the development partners, the World Bank has provided \nthe most support to the agriculture and natural resources sector in the PRC, followed by ADB, \nwith total financing of $1.48 billion for 19 projects. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation \nhas provided assistance to the sector for seven projects, focusing on environment, education, \npublic  health,  infrastructure,  and  forestry.  The  World  Bank  assistance  to  Shanxi  province \nincludes  support  for  poverty  reduction,  agricultural  and  natural  resources  development, \nsmallholder  cattle  development,  river  basin  development,  watershed  rehabilitation, \nenvironmental management, health and sanitation, transport and communications, and social \ninfrastructure.  ADB  assistance  to  the  province  has  included  projects  in  environmental \nimprovement, thermal power, and transport and communication. Germany has provided grant \nassistance for two projects in the sector in Shanxi. Major projects in the sector supported by \nexternal  assistance  are  listed  in  Appendix  3.  In  the  PRC,  all  the  external  assistance  is \nharmonized through the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). The Government coordinates the \nexternal  assistance  through  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  and  the \nrelevant ministries. ADB and other organizations meet and work together formally and informally \nthrough conferences and workshops along with the Government to share experiences and \nlessons. During preparation and implementation of agriculture and natural resources sector \nprojects, ADB staff regularly interact with counterpart staff of the World Bank, United Nations \nand bilateral agencies, and nongovernment organizations. \n \n21.  Lessons. The majority of ADB-assisted agricultural development projects in the PRC \nare rated successful but some agro-enterprise-related operations require improvement. The \nmain lessons indicate that project implementation quality can be strengthened by (i) provincial \nand local governments providing adequate and timely financial and staff resources; (ii) effective \nsupervision, monitoring, and cost control; (iii) allowing flexibility in project design to respond to \nchanges as implementation progresses; (iv) properly administering the bidding process; and  \n(v) setting up a robust project performance monitoring system (PPMS) at the outset to obtain \nadequate information needed for taking timely corrective measures.  \n \n22.  ADB's country assistance program evaluation11 identifies a number of agro-enterprise-\nrelated issues that are relevant to the Project. These include (i) agroprocessing projects have \nhad to rely on the untested capacity of private agro-enterprises, (ii) due to insufficient financial \nrates of return and difficulties in servicing the debt, the Government is reluctant to borrow for \nsuch projects on ordinary capital resources terms, and (iii) the failure of onlending through \n                                                 \n9  Communist Party of China Central Committee. 2007.

Manila. \n ", "    7\nfinancial institutions required channeling of funds through agro-enterprises. While the country \nassistance  program  evaluation  does  not  provide  reasons  for  the  less-than-satisfactory \nperformance of agroprocessing projects, the project completion report (PCR) for the Fujian Soil \nConservation and Agriculture Development Project12 refers to a number of problems common to \nsuch projects, including (i) changing market trends, (ii) location in relation to raw material \nsupply, (iii) weak financial position, and (iv) inappropriate financing terms, which (a) failed to \nreflect cash flow and required loan repayments to start immediately (prior to full operation of the \nfacilities installed with project loan funds), (b) included an interest spread for the finance bureau, \nwhich drove the resulting end-borrower\u2019s interest rate above domestic market rates, and (c) \nrequired  the  arrangement  of  complementary  working  capital.  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance \nreport13 identifies similar lessons, specifically that agro-enterprises with viable business plans \nand good management capacity can succeed by using ordinary capital resources or other \ncommercial  financing.  However,  where  financial  markets  fail,  development  partners  and \ngovernments can address this gap by providing specific financial products (loans, equity, and \nguarantees) that assist small and medium-sized enterprises, or more specifically private agro-\nenterprises. Agro-enterprises often need long-term financing because of the lead time required \nto attain full production capacity. But the long-term financing should not be subsidized. Instead, \nthe terms and conditions of financing should reflect a realistic repayment schedule.  \n \n23.  The recently completed PCR on the West Henan Agricultural Development Project14 \nfound that the horticulture and livestock components were successfully implemented and helped \nsignificantly reduce poverty among the participating households. More than 33,000 households \nwere  provided  with  subloans  and  the  average  repayment  rate  was  96%.  The  main \nrecommendations of the PCR include (i) the financial management system of subloans should \nbe computerized and integrated with the relevant government accounting systems; (ii) subloans \nto farmers should be disbursed rather than reimbursed as poor households do not have cash \noutlays for up-front investment; (iii) to make project management more inclusive, the Poverty \nAlleviation and Development Office (PADO) should be closely involved; and (iv) a PPMS should \nbe set up at an early stage and be computerized. The World Bank's implementation completion \nreport on the Shanxi Poverty Alleviation Project15 rates almost all of its components\u2014river \nbeach development, village water supply, rural roads, soil and water conservation, horticulture, \nlivestock, revolving fund for microfinance, and project management\u2014as satisfactory or highly \nsatisfactory. But the agroprocessing component is rated unsatisfactory because many of the \nagro-enterprises had been state-owned enterprises with \"poorly trained managers.\" However, \none agro-enterprise is rated as \"exceptionally successful\" because it was privately owned and \nhad outstanding management that understood the markets well and managed its operations \nefficiently. Overall, the project was rated successful. The rate of recovery of subloans from farm \nhouseholds is also highly satisfactory. More details on experiences and lessons from past \nprojects is presented in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n24.  The recommendations outlined in the PCR on the West Henan Agricultural Development \nProject have been an integral part of the Project's design from the outset. Where appropriate, \nseveral other lessons were incorporated in the design; these include (i) establish strict criteria \nfor  selecting  project  components  and  agro-enterprises  that  satisfy  financial,  economic, \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2003.

Moreover, in-depth discussions of various aspects of project \nimplementation, financing, disbursement procedures, and the PPMS were held with the PMO \nand concerned finance bureaus. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n25.  The  anticipated  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  rural  poverty  and  develop  a \nsustainable agriculture sector in 26 counties of Shanxi. The outcome of the Project will be \nincreased  farm  productivity  and  household  income  resulting  from  high-value  agricultural \nproduction by  adopting  appropriate  and  environmentally  sound  technologies  and  practices, \nvalue addition through processing, and efficient market access; and improved food quality and \nsafety in the project counties. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n26.  The  Project will directly benefit  more than 66,000 farm households (about 264,000 \npeople) by providing them with credit and indirectly benefit another 16,000 household in 26 \ncounties of five municipalities in central and southern Shanxi, where the per capita land area is \nless than 0.17 ha. Of these, 11 are poverty counties and 12 are on the priority list for treatment \nof accelerated soil erosion in the PRC. The Project comprises four components: (i) transition to \nhigh-value  production  by  adopting  technologies  and  practices  that  ensure  environmental \nsustainability and increase farmers' incomes; (ii) strengthening of farm\u2013market linkages by \nsupporting on-farm and industrial agroprocessing and marketing of high-value products; (iii) \ncapacity-building and training of farmers, farmer associations, and TSAs to support high-value \nproduction and processing of farm products; and (iv) project management to support efficient \nimplementation of the Project. The first component includes three activities\u2014perennial crops, \nannual crops, and livestock. To keep project implementation manageable, each participating \ncounty will take up any two of these. The criteria to select project counties, sites, and activities \nare in Appendix 4; and the distribution of project activities by municipalities and counties is \ndescribed in Appendix 5.  \n \n1.   Transition to High-Value Production \n \n27.  Growing  traditional  cereal  crops  (wheat  and  maize),  in  the  project  area,  requires \nextensive and excessive use of soil, irrigation water, fertilizers, and pesticides. Generally, the \nLoess Plateau is not suitable for this type of extensive agriculture. Given the structural design, 4 \nmu (about 0.25 ha) are needed to build a 1-mu greenhouse (about 0.07 ha or 667 m2). Such \ngreenhouses can produce high-value vegetables that can more than double the annual income \n ", "    9\nof a household. This operation will also provide much higher employment and use far less water \nand fertilizers, thus improving the soil condition and ensuring food safety. Planting of perennial \nfruit trees, i.e., walnuts, pears, and apples, on sloping lands will preserve soils from erosion and \nincrease household incomes by about 30%. Pig raising is traditionally carried out by building \nsheds inside the homes. This practice is unhealthy for farm households and animals, and does \nnot allow for proper disposal of animal wastes. Under the Project, combined pig sheds will be \nbuilt for 5\u20136 households separate from homes with proper infrastructure to dispose of animal \nwastes safely, either by turning it into compost or biogas, a source of rural clean energy \ngeneration. Other livestock, i.e., goats, sheep, and cattle, mostly graze free on the range, \nlittering it with animal waste and causing extensive damage to grasslands that become prone to \nerosion and land degradation. The Project will assist these households to adopt pen-feeding to \nimprove  livestock  productivity  through  proper  feeding,  guarding  against  infectious  animal \ndiseases, and safe and productive disposal of animal waste. \n \n28.  High-Value Perennial Crop Production. This subcomponent will focus on perennial \ncrops such as fruits, nuts, and selected Chinese herbs. The Project will provide credit to farm \nhouseholds to access planting material and technology to plant high-value crops, increase \nproduction, and achieve value-addition. To support poor households in rain-fed areas, hardy, \nhigh-value dryland crops such as Chinese medicinal herbs and walnuts will be promoted. The \nproject activities include planting of walnut, apple, pear, red jujube (Chinese date), prickly ash, \nasparagus, fast-growing poplar trees, and Chinese herbs. The estimated planted area will be \nabout 13,850 ha, benefiting about 46,000 households in 20 counties in five municipalities.  \n \n29.  High-Value Annual Crop Production. This subcomponent will support the production \nof high-value vegetables and yellow millet. The credit to participating households will finance \ninfrastructure  such  as  establishment  of  greenhouses,  improved  water  use  efficiency,  and \nterracing. The vegetables\u2014cucumber, vegetable marrow, and tomato\u2014will be produced in two \ntypes of greenhouses, whereas yellow millet will be field grown. About 1,240 \u201csunshine\u201d (on flat \nland)  and  4,650  \u201carchcanopy\u201d  greenhouses  will  be  established.  Another  1,530  sunshine \ngreenhouses will be established on hilly land. Each greenhouse occupies an area of about 667 \nm2 (1 mu) and will be established by a single household. Qinzhou yellow millet variety will be \nproduced in dryland areas of Qin county\u2014the place of origin of the nationally famous yellow \nmillet brand\u2014on about 600 ha. A total of 9,700 households will benefit from this activity. \n \n30.  Improving Livestock Production. This subcomponent will promote high-value small-\nscale livestock production by extending credit to eligible farmers. In line with the Project\u2019s \npoverty focus, limits will be placed on the size of livestock herds to ensure that benefits go to \npoor farmers in a wide area. It includes pig breeding and fattening, beef cattle breeding and \nfattening, broiler and layer chicken production, and sheep breeding for meat and goats for \ncashmere. Livestock production bases will support about 9,400 households, of which about \n5,000 are poor households in 20 counties of five municipalities.  \n \n2.   Strengthening Farmer\u2013Market Linkages \n \n31.  In most project counties, a variety of marketing channels exist with varying degrees of \nefficiency.  Rapid  development  of  expressways  and  rural  roads  and  extensive  coverage  of \ncellular  phone  networks  in  recent  years  have  made  input  and  output  markets  and  price \ninformation readily accessible to farmers.16 Under the Project, the participating farmers will \nmake the transition to high-value production systems and connect to the value chain for the first \n                                                 \n16  The loan fact-finding mission interviewed farmers in remote counties who carried cell phones, demonstrating easy \naccess to brokers and farmer associations to receive the latest information on prices and market trends.   \n ", "10           \ntime. Establishing high-value production bases, expanding on-farm processing capacity, and \nconnecting farmers to agro-enterprises\u2014through formal contractual arrangements\u2014are among \nthe  most  effective  ways  to  strengthen  farmer\u2013market  linkages.  Of  the  24  agro-enterprises \ninvolved in the Project, five will borrow from the Project to expand their storage capacity. Their \nincreased  procurement  of  farm  produce  will  indirectly  benefit  16,000  nonborrowing  farm \nhouseholds. Another 19 will not borrow from the Project but will sign buy-back contracts and \nprovide credit guarantees to about 30% (or about 20,000) of the 66,000 borrowing households.  \n \n32.  Expanding On-Farm Processing. On-farm processing investments include drying of \nChinese dates in temperature-controlled warehouses within households. Red jujubes are dried \njust  before  full  ripening  to  prevent  splitting  soon  after  harvesting.  Drying  ensures  quality, \nprolongs  storage  life,  and  increases  value.  To  facilitate  the  drying  process  of  additional \nproduction of about 4,000 tons annually from about 400 ha, construction of about 100 drying-\nrooms, each with a capacity of 24 tons, will be supported. Each drying room will be managed by \none  household  and  cater  to  a  group  of  10  households.  Another  four  150-ton  capacity \natmosphere-controlled warehouses will be built to store other types of fruit. These warehouses \nwill address farmers\u2019 storage problems during harvesting and prolong fruits' storage life, and \nresult in better prices during off-season sales. Each of these warehouses will benefit a group of \n10  households,  and  be  managed  by  one  household.  These  100  drying  rooms  and  four \nwarehouses will benefit a total of 1,040 households. \n \n33.  Expanding Agroprocessing Operations. About 150 agro-enterprises in the project \narea are engaged in processing fruit, vegetable, and livestock products. These agro-enterprises \nare linked to farmers through a variety of formal, contract-farming, and informal arrangements, \nand  provide  an  important  market  outlet.  However,  for  many,  the  ability  to  expand  market \nopportunities is constrained by inadequate storage and processing facilities because of lack of \nlong-term investment financing. The Project will support five privately owned agro-enterprises to \nexpand cold storage capacity in fruit (two), millet, meat, and vegetable pickling. This will expand \n(i)  the  production  of  current  contract  farmers  with  whom  agro-enterprises  have  buy-back \narrangements, and (ii) the number of farmers supplying to agro-enterprises. The five agro-\nenterprises were identified according to the eligibility criteria set up during project preparation \nand have financially viable investment proposals (Appendix 6). More than 16,000 nonborrowing \nhouseholds will indirectly benefit from these investments. \n \n34.  Enhancing Product Quality and Providing Credit Guarantees. To improve product \nquality and safety, the Project will introduce ChinaGAP standards both at the farm and for \nagroprocessing. Compliance with ChinaGAP will eventually lead to certification by GlobalGAP. \nThese practices will improve raw material traceability and reassure importers about the quality \nand safety of agricultural exports from Shanxi. The Project will provide specialized training to \nagro-enterprises and participating farmers to be able to comply with ChinaGAP standards.17 The \nProject will also help establish formal linkages between the beneficiary (borrowing) farmers and \n19 agro-enterprises by signing contract-farming agreements. Through these agreements, the \nfarmers will get access to stable markets and receive premium prices for their produce, and \nagro-enterprises will provide credit guarantees for farmers' subloan repayments. These agro-\nenterprises will benefit by ensuring access to stable and quality farm produce and fully utilizing \ntheir installed processing capacity.   \n \n                                                 \n17 Depending on the readiness to meet standards, the certification process takes a few months and requires \nadditional costs\u2014on average about $50\u2013$70 per hectare\u2014to enroll in the program for quality audits. The farmers' \nand agro-enterprises' participation in ChinaGAP initiatives will be voluntary. The project training will help them \nassess the long-term benefits of certification and to make their own decision to participate in the program.  \n ", "    11\n35.  Nineteen  privately  owned  agro-enterprises  were  selected  from  a  long-list  of  138  to \nparticipate in the Project for the ChinaGAP and credit guarantee initiatives. They will not receive \nany financing from the Project but will work closely with the project beneficiaries. They were \nselected\u2014jointly by provincial, municipal, and county finance and agriculture bureaus, and \npoverty  alleviation  and  development  offices  (PADOs)\u2014based  on  the  following  criteria:  (i) \nvoluntary participation, (ii) profitable operation with good market access, (iii) potential to expand \nprocessing capacity, (iv) debt\u2013equity ratio not exceeding 1.5 or 60:40, and (v) total net assets \nexceeding outstanding loan amounts. The 19 agro-enterprises, in 14 project counties, will work \nwith about 30% of the 66,000 beneficiary households by providing them with credit guarantee \nand  technical  services,  and  signing  buy-back  contracts.  Through  these  arrangements,  the \nProject  will  help  these  agro-enterprises  fully  utilize  their  installed  capacity,  expand  their \nproduction  bases,  improve  product  quality  and  safety,  and  decrease  transaction  costs. \nTherefore, these arrangements will be mutually beneficial for participating households and the \nagro-enterprises. The selected agro-enterprises have expressed willingness to participate in the \nProject in writing to the county finance bureaus (CFBs).  \n \n36.  All 24 agro-enterprises will participate in the project activities, demonstrating effective \nfarmer\u2013market linkages and showing how such linkages can improve value-addition for farms \nby improving product quality to satisfy the demands of international and, especially, increasingly \ndiscerning domestic consumers. During project preparation, a detailed due diligence review was \nundertaken showing that all 24 agro-enterprises are financially sound; have viable business \nplans, adequate processing capacity, and a good outreach program; and have well-trained and \nexperienced management, and a good reputation in dealing with farmers. The financial due \ndiligence review report is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n3.  Capacity Building and Training \n37.  Farmer Training and Demonstration Activities. Successful adoption of high-value \nproduction systems will require a well-developed farmer training program and demonstration \nactivities. Initially, \"trainer farmers\" will be trained to, in turn, provide training for other farmers in \ntownships and villages. Training will be provided in modern farm production technologies and \npractices, water-saving irrigation practices, IPM, animal waste disposal, and marketing. Training \nwill  be  spread  over  the  project  implementation  period  in  accordance  with  the  phasing  of \ninvestment activities. Given that training will be held in villages and communities, it will not be \nlimited to farmers participating in the Project, but will be provided to all interested farmers to \nraise awareness about new technologies and practices. Farmers will attend refresher courses \nfrom time to time. Training will be provided to 280,000 farmers in the project area over 5 years. \nOn the assumption that each farm household participating in the Project (66,000) attends two \nrounds of training, 150,000 nonparticipating farm households will also benefit from the Project's \nfarmer  training  program.  To  ensure  women\u2019s  and  poor  households'  access  to  these \ntechnologies, training will specifically target members of their households. \n \n38.  The Project will introduce technologies and practices to encourage sustainable use of \nland and water resources, and improve poor women's access to modern production technology \nand microfinance. Excessive use of groundwater in many project counties is causing a rapid \ndrawdown  of  aquifers;  this  coupled  with  climate  change  impacts  means  the  situation  will \nexacerbate  in  the  coming  years.  The  transition  from  grain  crops  to  high-value  vegetable \nproduction in greenhouses will result in significant water saving. But the flood-irrigation practices \nin  the  existing  greenhouses  are  also  wasteful.  To  demonstrate  the  benefits  of  improved \ngroundwater management, WFPF will provide a grant. Under the WFPF-supported activities, \nabout 300 poor farmers, in five project counties, will receive subsidies to install drip irrigation \n ", "12           \ninfrastructure in their greenhouses and receive training. Staff of the water resources bureaus will \nalso receive training and monitoring equipment for sustainable groundwater management. A \nsummary of activities of this demonstration project and its implementation arrangements is in \nAppendix 7, and a more detailed concept paper is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n39.  Rural finance is particularly inaccessible to poor women in Shanxi as they mostly (i) live \nin remote villages, (ii) need loans in small amounts, (iii) cannot provide collateral, and (iv) have \nfew skills in modern production and marketing practices. ADB's GDCF has provided a grant to \npilot-test the viability of microfinance cooperatives and revolving funds in four villages of two \npoverty counties.18 Selected poor women will get access to microfinance from revolving funds \nand receive training to improve production and marketing skills, and to increase household \nincomes. A summary of GDCF activities and implementation arrangements is in Appendix 8 and \na detailed concept paper is in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n40.  Capacity  Building  of  Farmer  Associations.  Shanxi  has  about  1,900  officially \nregistered farmer associations; of these 1,220 are in the project area. Despite their widespread \nproliferation, many of the associations have inadequate capacity and sometimes are too small \nto be effective. To demonstrate the role such associations play in marketing farm produce and \ndisseminating farm technologies and practices, the Project will support five associations in key \ncrop  and  livestock  activities.  The  Shanxi  provincial  government  (SPG)  identified  these \nassociations during project preparation as having the potential for a significant demonstration \neffect within the project area as a whole. These include the Xinnong Science and Technology \nAssociation in Qin county, the Prickly Ash Association and Walnut Association in Pingshun \ncounty, and the vegetable and livestock associations in Liulin county. The Project will provide \ntraining to enhance their organizational skills, support study tours to learn from better organized \nassociations within and outside the province, and provide equipment and furniture. They will \nalso receive training in farmer mobilization and group management to make them more effective \nas a conduit for information transfer. \n \n41.  Capacity Building of Technical Service Agencies. The Project will support TSAs to \nenhance their capacity for providing better services to beneficiary households. This will include \nsupport to provincial, municipal, and county TSAs to (i) prepare and publish farm manuals;  \n(ii)  demonstrate  sustainable  farming  practices,  i.e.,  producing  high-value  outputs  ensuring \nquality and safety, water-saving irrigation systems, and stall-feeding livestock practices; and  \n(iii) monitor environmental parameters, including water quality and balance, and soil conditions. \nA detailed institutional analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n4.   Project Management  \n \n42.  The PMO and project implementation units (PIUs) will be strengthened through staff \ntraining, workshops, and study tours, and the provision of vehicles and equipment. Relevant \nstaff from the implementing agencies as well as from the provincial, municipal, and county \nfinance bureaus will receive training at the start of the Project in financial management and \nreporting, and ADB disbursement and procurement procedures. The PMO will establish and \nmaintain a PPMS to monitor project implementation progress and performance in meeting its \nobjectives and output targets. Project components and activities are discussed in greater detail \nin Supplementary Appendix H. \n \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2003. Promoting Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment (RETA 6143). Manila. The GDCF is currently \nfinanced by Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n ", "    13\nC.  Special Features \n43.  The transition to high-value crops is taking place in many parts of Shanxi but its pace is \nslow and not well-coordinated to optimize the impact on farmers' income, access to markets, \nproduct quality and safety, and the environment. Poor farmers, especially poor women, have \nlimited or no access to rural finance. The Project will introduce technologies and practices, \nsome for the first time, in Shanxi for integrated agricultural development. \n \n44.  Sustainable  Production  Processes.  The  Project  will  promote  integrated  and \nsustainable farm production and processing technologies and practices to significantly improve \nenvironmental management of land and water resources. This will include efficient groundwater \nuse for irrigation, reduced use of agrochemicals, increased use of compost, wider practice of \nIPM, as well as safe disposal of livestock waste.  \n \n45.  Enhanced Food Quality and Safety. The Project will improve farmer\u2013market linkages \nby connecting agro-enterprises with production bases and establishing a series of best practices \nto  improve  product  quality  and  safety  by  introducing  ChinaGAP.  Improving  farmer\u2013market \nlinkages will (i) enhance farmers\u2019 awareness about food safety, (ii) improve farmers' access to \nstable markets, (iii) enhance product quality to attain premium prices, (iv) reduce price volatility, \nand (v) increase farm incomes. Farmers, agro-enterprises, and consumers will benefit from \nreduced transaction costs. \n \n46.  Climate Change Adaptation. The WFPF-funded activities will demonstrate viability of \nmore productive and efficient irrigation techniques, and support the participating farmers in \nadapting to climate change impacts. Skills training will directly and indirectly help an estimated  \n5,000  farmers  to  reduce  their  dependence  on  the  already  scarce  water  resources.  Poor \nhouseholds will be given subsidies to adopt water-saving irrigation technology. These initiatives \nwill provide examples of good practices that are replicable in non-project counties of Shanxi and \nin  other  provinces.  The  capacity  of  water  resources  bureaus  will  also  be  strengthened  to \nimprove sustainable management of groundwater resources. \n  \n47.  Women's Economic Empowerment. In many participating counties, the majority of \nfarm  households  are  headed  by  women  as  men  migrate  to  seek  off-farm  employment. \nTherefore, the Project will pay special attention to households headed by women to provide \ntraining and to ensure they receive proportionate assistance from project activities, especially \nloan funds.19 Due to variability in databases on households, the percentage of households \nactually headed by women is difficult to quantify. Therefore, targeting will be done in villages \nduring project implementation. To ensure women's access to loan funds, they will be allowed to \nsign the credit agreement without needing a male cosignatory, which is currently not a common \npractice.  The  GDCF-funded  pilot  will  introduce  revolving  funds  for  poor  women  to  access \nmicrofinance in four poverty villages for the first time in Shanxi. Poor women will be organized in \nproduction groups and allowed access to microfinance through group guarantees and without \nrequiring collateral. If this pilot is successful, it may be replicated in other project counties. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19  If the households in a project village or county are headed by women, the same proportion of project assistance, \ni.e., number and amount of subloans and training will be provided to women. But women in general will have equal \naccess to project activities including training.   \n ", "14           \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n48.  The project investment cost is estimated at $189.3 million, including taxes and duties of \n$17.6 million, contingencies of $0.8 million, and financial charges during implementation of  \n$1.3 million.

The commitment charge is computed at 0.15% on undisbursed funds. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n49.  The Government has requested a loan of $100,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 26 year-term, including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% on undisbursed \nfunds, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. The Government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \n ", "    15\nadvice  from  ADB.  In  addition,  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  WFPF20  will  provide \n$500,000  (0.3%  of  the  total  project  cost)  and  the  GDCF21  will  provide  grant  cofinancing \nequivalent to $195,000 (0.1% of the total project cost), both to be administered by ADB.

The ADB loan will finance 52.8% of the total project costs. The remaining cost will be \nfinanced as follows (i) SPG, through its finance bureaus, $26.5 million; (ii) farmer associations, \n$0.3 million; (iii) participating farmers, $59.3 million; and (iv) participating agro-enterprises,  \n$2.5 million. SPG has agreed that interest during implementation and commitment charges will \nbe financed by the end users of the ADB loan. SPG has also agreed that all contingencies \nrelating to expenditures under the Project will be financed by local governments and end users. \n \n51.  The PRC will be the borrower of the ADB loan. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will make \nthe proceeds of the ADB loan available to SPG. The Shanxi Finance Department (SFD), on \nbehalf of SPG, will make the loan proceeds available in agreed amounts through the five \nparticipating municipal finance bureaus (MFBs) to the 26 participating county finance bureaus \n(CFBs).22 The CFBs will provide subloans to final borrowers (farmers and agro-enterprises) \nunder  subloan  agreements  subject  to  approval  by  appropriate  authorities.  The  terms  and \nconditions for the loan proceeds transferred from MOF through SFD and MFBs to CFBs will be \nthe same as those applied to the ADB loan. The terms and conditions of the subloans will \ninclude (i) the interest rate will not be lower than the prevailing commercial rate of interest for \n                                                 \n20  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. \n21 Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n22 During project preparation, a financial management assessment of SFD, including a sample of one of the five \nMFBs (Jinzhong municipality), a sample of five of the 26 CFBs (Yuchi district, Lishi district, Houma city, Wanrong \ncounty, and Qin county) and a sample of five of the 185 township finance stations (Fengcun, Yuebe, Jinjiazhuang, \nLicheng, and Xujiaduo) was carried out (Supplementary Appendix I). It concludes that these entities satisfy ADB\u2019s \nminimum  financial  management  requirements  for  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  All  of  these  are \ngovernment offices in the hierarchy under MOF and have satisfactory financial management capability to (i) record \nrequired financial transactions and balances, (ii) provide regular and reliable financial statements and monitoring \nreports, and (iii) safeguard financial assets. These offices are adequately staffed and some staff have prior \nexperience with the World Bank- or ADB-financed projects. However, additional training on relevant ADB policies \nand procedures will be provided to enhance their capacity prior to or at the start of the Project.  \n ", "16           \nequivalent types of loans;23 (ii) a repayment period to be determined based on the cash flow of \nthe subloan borrower's projection of future revenue, including a grace period not exceeding that \nof the ADB loan; (iii) SFD bearing the foreign exchange risk for all subloans; (iv) the CFBs \nbearing the credit risk for all subloans. Currently, the Government has a policy that requires \nhousehold borrowers to apply for a subloan to reimburse their capital expenditures.24 Under this \nProject, the Government has agreed to pilot-test the advance disbursement of subloans to the \nqualified borrowers. Based on the assessment of financial management capacity, SPG will \nselect up to five qualified participating counties where the second-generation imprest accounts \nwill  be  set  up  to  pilot-test  the  subloan  disbursement  procedure.  Based  on  successful \nperformance  of  such  arrangements,  the  same  procedure  may  be  expanded  to  other \nparticipating  counties.  The  subloan  disbursement,  financial  management  and  monitoring \nprocedures, and the flow of funds are described in Appendix 10. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n52.  SPG,  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project,  will  coordinate  and  supervise  all \nimplementation  activities  through  a  project  leading  group  chaired  by  the  vice  governor  of \nShanxi, with the deputy director of the Provincial Development and Reform Commission, deputy \ndirector  of  SFD,  and  director  of  PADO  as  vice  chairpersons.  The  deputy  directors  of  the \nprovincial departments of water resources, agriculture, land and resources, forests, audit, and \nenvironmental  protection,  and  of  the  All  China  Women's  Federation  (ACWF)  will  be  the \nmembers. Similar municipal and county leading groups will be constituted.  \n \n53.  SPG will set up the PMO at PADO in Taiyuan. The PMO, together with the Fund \nAdministration Unit (Division of International Capital Management) of SFD will coordinate and \noversee  implementation  of  all  activities  on  a  day-to-day  basis.  The  PMO  will  (i)  organize, \ncoordinate, and guide related departments in project municipalities and counties for effective \nimplementation of the Project; (ii) prepare an annual work program and budget; (iii) organize \nprocurement; (iv) maintain consolidated accounts, including developing a PPMS to track all \nfinancial transactions with subborrowers; (v) prepare and submit to ADB withdrawal applications \nand  statements  of  expenditure  through  SFD;  (vi)  monitor  physical  and  financial  progress, \nincluding  benefits  flow  to  intended  beneficiaries,  and  submit  reports  to  the  provincial \ngovernment and ADB; and (vii) liaise with SPG through SFD for reporting to MOF and ADB. The \nmunicipal and county PIUs, one in each of the five municipalities and 26 counties, will assist the \nPMO. The PIUs will be responsible for day-to-day implementation of all project activities under \nthe overall guidance of the PMO. The provincial Environmental Protection Department will be \nresponsible  for  monitoring  compliance  with  national  environmental  standards,  rules,  and \nregulations. The CFBs, as implementing agencies for the five agro-enterprises, will supervise \nthe financing and monitoring activities in Yuchi district, and Taigui, Pingyao, Qin Xian, and \nWanrong counties. The relevant environmental protection bureaus and water resources bureaus \nwill undertake environmental monitoring of soil and water resources, and agrochemicals.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n23  The benchmark is the People's Bank of China's lending rate over 5 years. The prevailing rate is around 7.75% per \nannum. http://www.pbc.gov.cn/english/detail.asp?col=6400&id=1159. \n24 While this policy improves financial management and lowers the risk of subloan misappropriation, it increases the \nprobability of excluding many poor borrowers who cannot arrange for upfront financing from family and friends.   \n ", "    17\n2.  Implementation Period \n \n54.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years from 2010 to 2015. The implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n3.  Procurement  \n \n55.  Of the $100.0 million loan, about $98.7 million will be disbursed in cash as farm credit to \nfarmers and agro-enterprises. The remaining $1.3 million will be used to procure office and farm \nequipment, vehicles, and to conduct workshops and training by the PMO and PIUs. The detailed \nprocurement plan is in Appendix 12. All procurement of goods and works will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts for works estimated to exceed or equal $10.0 million and those for goods estimated to \nexceed or equal $1.0 million will be procured using international competitive bidding procedures. \nContracts  for  works  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $10.0  million  but  more  than  or  equal  to \n$200,000, and contracts for goods estimated to cost less than $1.0 million but more than or \nequal  to  $100,000  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding  procedures  in \naccordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999), subject to modifications agreed \nwith ADB. Contracts for works estimated to cost less than $200,000 and for goods estimated to \ncost less than $100,000 will be procured using shopping procedures. All procurements and \nexpenditures by farmers and agro-enterprises\u2014undertaken or incurred using the subloans\u2014will \nbe supported with receipts provided to the PIUs and kept on the PIU and/or PMO record for \naudit. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be \nincluded in all procurement documents and contracts.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n56.  The Project will provide 120 person-months of national consulting services for project \nmanagement  and  training.  SPG  will  finance  and  engage  five  individual  consultants  to  \n(i) introduce ChinaGAP to promote best practices in product quality and safety; (ii) build capacity \nof  farmers  and  their  associations  to  adopt  improved  production  and  marketing  practices;  \n(iii) train TSAs in gender development, monitoring of soil and water quality, safe disposal of \nanimal waste, and environmental impact assessment; and (iv) support the PMO and PIUs to \nundertake  and  prepare  project  monitoring  and  supervision,  bidding  and  procurement \ndocuments, midterm review, and a project completion report. Specific consulting inputs are \noutlined in Appendix 13. To implement WFPF activities, three individual consultants will be \nengaged  for  25  person-months\u2014one  international  (water  resources  specialist,  5  person-\nmonths) and two national (irrigation specialist 12 person-months and hydrogeologist 8 person-\nmonths). To implement GDCF activities, a local nongovernment organization will be engaged \nfollowing the single-source selection procedure (Appendix 8). A national individual consultant \nwill be engaged for 2.5 person-months to monitor and evaluate GDCF activities. All recruitment \nfinanced under the WFPF and GDCF grants will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n57.  SPG has requested advance contracting action and retroactive financing to procure \noffice and farm equipment, vehicles, and civil works. This request is justified to make timely \npreparations  for  the  upcoming  cropping  season.  ADB  has  advised  SPG  that  retroactive \nfinancing  could  apply  for  up  to  20%  of  the  loan  for  expenditures  incurred  before  loan \neffectiveness and within 12 months prior to the signing of the loan agreement. All contracts \nproposed for advance action and retroactive financing will be undertaken in accordance with \n ", "18           \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The Government and \nSPG have been advised that approval of the advance action and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to financing the Project. PADO and municipal and county agencies have adequate \ncapacity to manage requisite procurement as demonstrated under similar projects in the recent \npast. PADO is engaging an independent design institute to prepare the bidding documents. The \nADB\u2019s resident mission in the PRC provided training to PMO and PIU staff in July 2009 to \nfamiliarize them with ADB's procurement and disbursement policies and procedures. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy  \n58.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with SPG. Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and bidding documents of the Project. \nIn particular, all contracts financed by ADB under the Project will include provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the PMO, PIUs, and all \ncontractors,  suppliers, consultants,  and  other  service  providers  related  to  the  Project.  The \nproject design and implementation arrangements provide for mitigating corruption risks. Risks \nassociated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated \nby (i) engaging a national consultant to advise and assist in the procurement of goods and \nservices, and the engagement of other consultants; (ii) introducing a dual signing system in \nwhich the contractor awarded the contract will also sign an anticorruption contract with the \nemployer; and (iii) periodic inspection by the PMO of the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund \nwithdrawals and settlements. In furtherance of the principles of transparency and accountability, \nSPG will cause the PMO to set up and develop a project website to provide the public with \ninformation on the Project, including (i) a summary of the audited financial statements of the \nProject, and (ii) tracking of procurement contract awards in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines. SPG will ensure that each implementing agency establishes financial control and \nmanagement arrangements compatible with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Financial Governance and \nManagement  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  ADB  and  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n59.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. Because some of the payments will be made for large contracts, \nfunds  will  be  withdrawn  from  the  loan  account  using  direct  payment,  reimbursement,  and \ncommitment  procedures.  SFD  will  set  up  and  maintain  three  separate  project  imprest \naccounts\u2014one for the loan and one each for the WFPF and GDCF grants\u2014in commercial \nbank(s) acceptable to ADB. To expedite the flow of funds and simplify document processing, the \nstatement of expenditure procedure may be used to reimburse, replenish, and liquidate eligible \nexpenditures  to  be  financed  from  the  loan  and  grant  imprest  accounts  for  any  individual \npayment not exceeding $200,000 for the loan, and $50,000 for WFPF and $30,000 for GDCF \ngrants  at  CFBs  and  township  finance  stations.  Payments  exceeding  this  ceiling  will  be \nreimbursed based on the full documentation process. The financial management assessment \nconcludes that SFD and a sample of the five municipalities, 26 counties, and their township \nfinance  stations  satisfy  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements  for  municipalities  and \ncounties. They are all government offices in the hierarchy under MOF and have satisfactory \nfinancial management capability. Disbursements from the imprest account will be supported by \nan appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. The initial amounts to be \n ", "    19\ndeposited in the loan and grant imprest accounts will not exceed the estimated expenditures to \nbe financed from each of the imprest accounts for the following 6 months of implementation or \n10% of the loan and respective grant amounts, whichever is lower. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n60.  Five  borrowing  agro-enterprises  and  other  government  agencies  involved  in  project \nimplementation will maintain separate accounts for the loan and grant funds. These accounts \nand  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by  an  independent  auditor  in \naccordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB, i.e., those set in the China National \nAccounting Law.25 The PMO will verify the subproject accounts and consolidate for the entire \nProject. Within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, the PMO will submit to ADB certified \ncopies (in English) of such audited project accounts and financial statements and auditor's \nreports. The participating agro-enterprises will also submit annual audited financial statements \nfor their operations, including income statements, balance sheets, and cash-flow statements to \nADB through the PMO within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. The audit of such \nfinancial statements will include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal \ncontrol systems with respect to project expenditures and other financial transactions, (ii) an \nassessment  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants  and  ADB's  requirements  for  project \nmanagement, (iii) an opinion on the operation of the imprest account and on the use of the \nstatement of expenditure procedure, and (iv) a review of the execution of commitments between \nthe participating five agro-enterprises and their farm production bases. The PMO will prepare \nbrief quarterly and detailed semiannual reports. The quarterly reports will provide a summary of \nprogress and problems encountered based on the outputs of the PPMS and computerized \nsubloan  management  system,  and  activities  planned  for  the  next  quarter.  The  detailed  \nsemiannual  reports  will  provide  analysis  of  the  issues  encountered  and  steps  taken  to \nameliorate the situation. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMO will \nsubmit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  that  describes  achievements  in  relation  to  the \nProject\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and outputs. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n61.  To monitor the progress of the Project in achieving the planned outcome and outputs, \nthe PMO will establish and maintain a computerized PPMS, which will be designed to permit \nadequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, schedules, activities, and \ndevelopment impacts. The PPMS will be based on targets outlined in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). Considering baseline data in the feasibility study reports, the PPMS \nwill adopt the following agreed indicators: (i) progress in crop and livestock production by \nfarmers, and processing and marketing by agro-enterprises; (ii) changes in perennial crop \nvarieties and yields; (iii) changes in application methods and volume of water used in various \nactivities;  (iv)  changes  in  type  and  application  rates  of  agrochemicals;  (v)  progress  in \nenvironmental management activities such as animal waste disposal; (vi) progress in capacity-\nbuilding in extension, training delivery, and outreach; (vii) strengthening of farmer organizations \nand  their  role  in  agricultural  products  supply  chains;  (viii)  increases  in  farm  incomes;  \n(ix)  reduction  in  poverty  incidence,  and  progress  in  gender  and  social  development;  \n(x) improvement in soil nutrient content and water quality; and (xi) track record of interest \npayment and recovery of subloans. The PMO, with support from consultants and in consultation \nwith  each  implementing  agency  and  agro-enterprise,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS \n                                                 \n25  These standards are comparable to those of International Financial Reporting Standards. The China National Audit \nOffice is an active member of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions. \n \n ", "20           \nprocedures to systematically generate data on inputs and outputs of project activities, and the \nphysical, socioeconomic, and environmental indicators to measure project impacts. Within the \nPPMS framework, the PMO will confirm achievable targets, refine monitoring and recording \narrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later than 6 months after the start of \nthe Project. Baseline and progress data will be reported to the PMO at the requisite time \nintervals by the implementing agencies and concerned bureaus. The PMO will also collect oral \nhistories from a sample of beneficiary farmers and agro-enterprises and take photographs of \ninteresting activities. It will analyze and consolidate data and report the outcome to ADB through \nquarterly progress reports.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n62.  In addition to regular monitoring, ADB and the Government will jointly review project \nperformance at least once a year. The review will assess achievement of project outcomes and \noutputs, financial progress, and issues and constraints affecting implementation. If need be, a \ntime-bound action plan for resolution of issues will be developed. ADB and the Government will \nundertake a midterm review during year 3 of the Project to assess implementation status and \ntake appropriate measures\u2014including modification of scope and implementation arrangements, \nand reallocation of loan proceeds, as appropriate\u2014to achieve the Project\u2019s outcomes and \nimpact. During the midterm review, the subloan portfolio performance will be assessed, and the \noption of bundling and selling the loan portfolio in a bidding process to one or more commercial \nbanks will be considered. All subborrowers with on-time repayment history may also choose to \nhave their records disclosed to local financial institutions to improve their access to credit. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \n \nA.  Farm Investments and Incomes \n63.  The Project will support a range of investments by establishing perennial and annual \ncrops, livestock rearing, and agroprocessing. The investments will range from CNY4,300 for \nimproved millet production per household (average farm size of 0.26 ha), to CNY528,000 for \nestablishing on-farm cold storage by farmer associations. The increase in farm household \nincome will range from about CNY5,300 to CNY16,000 per annum depending on the type of \noperation; on average about a 30% increase in household income. Financial internal rates of \nreturn for all types of investments range from 15% to 20%, well above the estimated weighted \naverage costs of capital for each investment, which is around 5.1%.  \nB.  Financial Analysis of Agro-Enterprises \n64.  The Project will support investments in expanding production capacity of five agro-\nenterprises (two engaged in fruit, and one each in millet, pork, and vegetable processing). Due \ndiligence of these agro-enterprises was undertaken to determine their eligibility to participate in \nthe  Project  based  on  socioeconomic,  environmental,  and  financial  criteria.  All  these  agro-\nenterprises (i) have been in operation for at least 4 years; (ii) are financially sound (based on an \nassessment of their last 3 years' audited financial statements); (iii) are privately owned; (iv) have \nprofessional management and qualified staff; and (v) have well-established markets both at \nhome and in Europe and South-East Asia. The one for yellow millet products, supplies 40% of \nthe PRC market. Such investments will be financed by a mix of debt (from project loan funds) \nand equity. Loan financing will not exceed 50% of the total cost of each investment. Each agro-\nenterprise has confirmed availability of its equity to complement loan financing. The estimated \nfinancial internal rate of return of all five agro-enterprises ranges from 18% to more than 25%.  \n ", "    21\nC.  Economic Benefits \n65.  Considering economic net incremental benefits and establishment costs over 20 years, \nthe Project's economic internal rate of return is estimated to be 19.5%. The sensitivity analysis \nindicates that the Project is robust with respect to decline in the net incremental benefits and \nrise in costs from individual activities. The economic and financial analyses is described in \nAppendix 14 and more details are in Supplementary Appendix J. \nD.  Environmental Benefits and Impacts \n66.  The Project will generate significant environmental benefits by helping farmers to adopt \nmodern technologies and practices. The expansion of high-value perennial and annual crops \nwill  reduce  soil  erosion  in  sloped  areas,  improve  water-use  efficiency,  reduce  use  of \nagrochemicals,  and  produce  high-quality  and  safer  products.  The  estimated  annual  water \nsavings will be approximately 3.8 million m3. Fertilizer use is expected to be reduced by about \n2,300 tons/per annum. Environmental benefits will not be even across all project counties. \nDepending on the nature and/or number of activities, a net increase may result in the use of \nwater and agrochemicals in certain counties. Net annual savings from reduced use of water and \nagrochemicals is expected to be around CNY15 million. Livestock activities will provide health \nbenefits by encouraging farmers to collectively manage their herds in larger facilities, improving \nhygienic conditions in living areas, and reducing soil degradation by limiting free-range grazing. \nLivestock waste, a major source of nonpoint source pollution in soil and water, will be disposed \noff safely either by composting and/or through biogas digesters to produce clean energy for \ndomestic use.26 \n \n67.  Due to increased fruit-tree production, net annual pesticide use will increase by about \n5.4 tons. Other potential adverse environmental impacts may stem from increased generation of \nagricultural  waste  and  construction  of  cold  storage  and  processing  capacity  for  five  agro-\nenterprises. The increase in waste production will be mitigated by adopting adequate treatment \nand disposal procedures. Construction impacts will be mitigated by applying a code of practice \nfor all construction works, as outlined in the environmental management plan. \n \n68.  The Project is classified as a category B environment project. During project preparation, \ninitial environmental examination and summary initial environmental examination reports were \nprepared in accordance with the PRC regulations and ADB guidelines. A summary of findings \nand recommendations of expected benefits and impacts are presented in Appendix 15. The \nsummary initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix K. Due diligence \nreview of environmental management practices by the participating 24 agro-enterprises was \nalso  undertaken  (Supplementary  Appendix  L).  The  review  shows  that  the  agro-enterprises \ncomply with all national regulations and apply adequate environmental management procedures \nacceptable to ADB.  \nE.  Employment Generation \n69.  Based on incremental labor requirements for each activity and assuming 300 working \ndays per year, approximately 10,900 person-years of employment will be generated annually at \nfull development. Of these, 7,600 are expected to be generated by perennial crop cultivation, \n630 by greenhouse vegetables and annual crops, 40 by on-farm processing, and 2,700 by \nlivestock activities. In addition to this full-time employment, approximately 23,000 person-years \n                                                 \n26  There is an active market for compost (average price CNY50\u2013CNY80/m3 depending on the type) in the project \narea, which ensures that it has well-managed processing, application, and/or marketing. \n ", "22           \nof part-time or seasonal employment will be generated. Of this, 20,000 person-years will be \nrequired for establishing perennial crops as these investments will require labor inputs over a \nnumber  of  years.  Much  of  the  labor  generated  will  be  provided  by  the  participating  farm \nhouseholds. Some unskilled agricultural work will be available to nonparticipating households. \nWith the return of migrant workers to farms, as a result of the ongoing financial crisis in the \nindustry and mining sectors, employment generated by the Project will have a significant social \nand economic impact on the project area.   \nF.  Poverty Impact  \n70.  Of the 26 project counties, 11 are classified as poor, and 6 of the 11 are national priority \npoverty counties. As the PMO will be established at PADO, it will pay close attention to poverty \nreduction in the project area. The Project will support about 40,000 absolute poor and another \n25,000 low-income households. The Project will pay special attention to households headed by \nwomen,  identified  as  particularly  vulnerable.  The  annual  household  income  is  expected  to \nincrease by 30%, by about CNY6,000. A beneficiary absolute poor household (with a per-capita \nannual income of less than CNY1,000) can expect to double its income. And a low-income \nhousehold can expect its annual per-capita income to increase from CNY1,600 to more than \nCNY2,200. Higher income coupled with increased production capacity and enhanced technical \nskills will help vulnerable poor households to move out and remain out of poverty. The summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 16.  \n \nG.  Gender and Development \n71.  To increase gender awareness, training will be provided to the PMO, PIUs, and TSA \nstaff and the leaders of township and village committees. Women's participation in project-\nrelated meetings and decision making will be actively encouraged. Women will elect their own \nrepresentatives for village councils to facilitate consultation and participation in project activities. \nACWF  will  monitor  project  benefits  for  women,  in  particular  poor  women  and  households \nheaded by women. ACWF will be included in the project leading group, and its county and \nvillage chapters will receive training to improve mobilization and support to women.  \n \n72.  The Project will provide women with (i) needs-based training to adopt modern farm \nproduction  technology  and  access  markets;  and  (ii)  proportionate  assistance  from  project \nactivities, especially from subloans. The Project will create about 18,000 job opportunities for a \ntotal of 10,900 person-years; women are expected to take up about 12,000 jobs. Of the 300,000 \nperson-days of training to enhance farmers\u2019 technical knowledge, more than half are expected \nto be provided to women.27 A gender action plan is in Appendix 17.  \n \n73.  The GDCF grant will facilitate women\u2019s economic empowerment in four villages of two \npoverty counties by (i) setting up revolving funds for microfinance; (ii) organizing self-help \ngroups linked to existing farmer associations to ensure their access to markets, and modern \nfarm  production  technology,  (iii)  providing  training  on  technical,  marketing,  and  alternative \nincome generation activities, and leadership at times and venues convenient for women; and \n(iv) capacity-building of county and village ACWF chapters to ensure sustainability of women\u2019s \nempowerment activities. For the first cycle of the GDCF pilot, 140 women will be organized in  \n20 production groups and given access to microfinance through a group guarantee without \nrequiring collateral. This initiative, if successful, will be replicated in the Project.  \n \n                                                 \n27  The Government's Chinese Women Development Program (2001\u20132010), approved on 22 May 2001, stipulates \nthat the proportion of women's share in training and job opportunities should remain at more than 40%. \n ", "    23\nH.  Resettlement \n74.  The Project does not require land acquisition or involuntary resettlement. The expansion \nof production systems and agroprocessing will be on existing land.  \n \nI.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n75.  At the macro level, the major risks to attaining project objectives relate to stable policies \ngoverning  private  sector  agricultural  production  and  processing,  sustainable  agricultural \ndevelopment, and poverty reduction in rural areas. The financial sector's failure to provide \ninvestment capital to farmers and agro-enterprises is being addressed by the Project in the \nshort term. In the long term, sustainable agricultural development will be constrained unless \nrequisite policy and financial sector reforms are carried out. At the project level, the ability and \nwillingness of beneficiaries to respond to market opportunities will be critical to its success. This \nrisk  will  be  mitigated  through  farmer  training  to  strengthen  farmer\u2013market  linkages.  The \ninvolvement of 24 agro-enterprises in the Project will be instrumental in mitigating market risk. \nGiven  the  strong  domestic  and  global  demand  and  price  competitiveness  of  the  PRC's \nagricultural products, risks relating to the marketing of fresh and processed products are limited. \nProduction activities entail only limited technical risk, as both the project area farmers and agro-\nenterprises have experience in cultivating and processing related products. Farmers will also be \nable to adopt new technologies and practices through advisory service and training. \n76.  Finally, the success of the Project will also, to a large degree, depend on its effective \nimplementation by the PMO and PIUs and monitoring by ADB to identify potential problems and \ninitiate remedial measures at an early stage. This risk is largely mitigated as the PMO and PIUs \nare already established at each level of government, and have gained experience from previous \nintegrated agricultural development projects. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n \n77.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  SPG  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.28 SPG will ensure that  \n \n(i)  Involuntary resettlement. SPG, PIUs, and participating enterprises will ensure \nthat the activities do not result in involuntary resettlement. \n \n(ii)  Gender development. Women have equal access to project benefits and they \n(a) receive proportionate assistance from project activities, especially access to \nproject  subloans,  (b)  get  at  least  a  40%  share  in  employment  and  training \nopportunities, (c) sign subloan agreements, and (d) are consulted in all project-\nrelated  events  and  minutes  are  recorded  to  monitor  their  participation  in \nmeetings.  Moreover,  ACWF  is  a  member  of  the  project  leading  group  and \ninvolved  in  project  implementation  in  villages  and  the  PMO  collects  data  to \nmonitor gender targets set to ensure women's participation in project activities. \n \n(iii)  Environment. All project activities are constructed, maintained, and operated in \nstrict  conformity  with  (a)  all  applicable  national  and  local  government \nenvironmental laws, regulations, and procedures; (b) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002)  and  guidelines;  and  (c)  the  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring \nmeasures set out in the respective environmental assessment reports.

Agriculture in the People's Republic of China \n1.  The agriculture sector in the People's Republic of China (PRC) is characterized by \nscarce land, abundant labor, and small-scale production using little mechanization. The majority \nof crop production originates from small farms averaging 0.65 hectares (ha). While a large part \nof  livestock  production  also  comes  from  small,  part-time  \u201cbackyard\u201d  operations,  full-time \n\u201cspecialized\u201d household and commercial operations have grown rapidly. While the contribution \nof agriculture to gross domestic product decreased to about 11% in 2008, from 27% in 1990, it \ncontinues to be the major source of employment for about 725 million rural population.   \n2.  The economic policy reforms, started in 1978, brought about remarkable progress in \nagriculture. The annual average agricultural growth rate over the first 20 years was about 6.5%. \nBy 1999, agricultural production showed significant improvement with the output of grain at  \n508 million tons (67% increase), cotton 4 million tons (77%), and oilseeds 26 million tons \n(400%) over 1978. Similarly, the output of meat (60 million tons) increased sevenfold and \naquatic products (41 million tons) ninefold from 1978. As a result, the chronic shortage of major \nagricultural  products  was  finally  overcome.  The  policy  reforms  consisted  of  (i)  increasing \nprocurement prices for grains, (ii) allowing farmers to sell above quota production at market \nprices,  (iii)  lowering  grain  quotas,  (iv)  increasing  grain  imports,  and  (v)  expanding  private \ninterprovincial trade. But the most important feature of the reforms has been the \u201chousehold \nresponsibility system,\u201d in which collective land was contracted to households for up to 30 years \nand  the  local  governments  took  strong  initiatives  to  transfer  production  decisions  from \ncommunes  to  households.  Economic  reforms  also  encouraged  the  establishment  of \ndragonheads1 that are now a major source of nonfarm employment for off-season rural labor. \nB.  Agriculture in Shanxi Province \n3.  Agricultural Development Policies and Plans. The 11th Five-Year Development Plan \nfor Provincial Economy and Social Development calls to strengthen agricultural infrastructure, \nand develop fruit, forest, vegetable, and livestock industries. In accordance with the Principles \non Further Enhancing Agricultural Restructuring formulated by the Shanxi provincial government \n(SPG) in 2000, strategic guidelines were formulated to promote steady development of pork and \npoultry production, and accelerate development of beef and mutton production. In line with the \n11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) of the PRC, SPG has supported 59 counties in two economic \nzones (north Shanxi and central and southern Shanxi) to promote socioeconomic development \nin rural areas and to improve farmer incomes particularly in poverty counties. The plan includes \nthe following targets: (i) defining agricultural production zones, (ii) maintaining production bases \nof essential commodities, (iii) fast-tracking the introduction of high-value annual and perennial \ncrops and breeding livestock, (iv) improving irrigation efficiency, (v) upgrading technical services \nto support transition to high-value production, and (vi) improving environmental management.  \n4.  Climate, Soil, and Water. Shanxi is situated in the northwest of the country and in the \nmiddle reaches of the Yellow River and eastern part of the Loess Plateau. Shanxi consists of \nmountains in the east, plateaus in the west, and basins in the middle. The mountains account \nfor 35% of the land area, hills 45%, and plateaus 20%. The capital, Taiyuan, is the largest city \nand the main industrial center. The province has short and mild winters. The mean annual \ntemperature  ranges  from  3.60C  to  13.80C.  The  annual  rainfall  in  the  province  is  between  \n                                                 \n1 Dragonheads are contract-farming agroprocessing firms set up with the technical and financial assistance of the \ngovernment.  These  firms  are  designated  by  different  levels  of  government\u2014national,  provincial,  municipal  or \ncounty\u2014based on their financial strength, scale of operations, level of technology, management, and potential to \nimprove farm incomes. Dragonheads at national or provincial level normally receive government support or subsidy, \nparticularly financing from the Agricultural Development Bank of China. \n \n ", "30          Appendix 2   \n400 and 650 millimeters. But it is not evenly distributed; about 60% of the total rainfall is \nreceived from July to September. Shanxi has an area of about 156,000 square kilometers (km2) \nand population of about 33 million. It only has about 3.8 million ha of arable land\u2014of modest \nquality and productivity\u2014for its 23 million rural population. The majority of farmers practice \ntraditional agriculture mostly growing staple crops, i.e., wheat and maize, that generate low \nincome  per  unit  of  land  and  require  extensive  use  of  agrochemicals  and  irrigation  water. \nTransition to high-value production will increase farm productivity and household incomes, and \nimprove environmental management. \n1.  High-Value Agricultural Products \n5.  Walnuts. Shanxi ranks first in exports and second in total walnut production in the \ncounty. Production increased from less than 47,000 tons in 2000 to about 70,000 tons in 2008. \nHowever, processing has lagged the growth in production because of variability in quality of raw \nwalnuts. The PRC has a long tradition of walnut exports and accounted for 40%\u201350% of world \ntrade in the 1960s. The growth in the United States (US) production in the 1970s negatively \naffected PRC exports and its share declined to 20%\u201330%. However, by 2005, the PRC's \nposition in export markets recovered and exceeded that of the US when the PRC exported \n60,000 tons (20% of its production) and the US exported 50,000 tons (30% of its production). \nShanxi accounted for 60% of PRC exports. With the rise in disposable incomes in the PRC, \ndomestic  demand  is  expected  to  grow.  The  United  Nations  forecasts  that  over  the  next  \n10 years, world demand for walnuts will grow by 10% annually. Therefore, Shanxi is well placed \nto take advantage of these opportunities by expanding walnut production and processing, and \nensuring high quality and safety of its products. \n6.  Fresh and Processed Apples and Fruits. The demand for fresh apples and apple \nproducts resulted in an almost six-fold increase in production in the PRC over the last 15 years; \nan average annual growth rate of over 12%. In the same period, apple production in the rest of \nthe world remained almost unchanged. Growth in the PRC apple production is expected to \ncontinue to 2015 contributing to more than a 60% increase in world apple production. Most of \nthe future growth in production in the PRC is expected to result from increases in productivity \nrather than expansion in the area. Similarly, world demand for apple concentrate is expected to \ncontinue growing. With infrastructure development in rural areas and increasing product quality, \ninternational competitiveness of the PRC's processed apple products will be strengthened. PRC \napple exports are projected to grow to over 943,000 tons by 2015. Exports of fruit products, \nincluding apples, from Shanxi have grown dramatically in recent years, increasing from about \n33,000 tons in 2003 to more than 90,000 tons in 2008, an average annual growth rate of 36%, \nexceeding that of the PRC, which was 9.7% in the same period. \n7.  Chinese Date (red jujube). This is a traditional product with medicinal and nutritional \nqualities that add to its popularity. Although other countries such as the Republic of Korea have \ntried to develop Chinese date production, 98% of the world's total cultivated area is in the PRC. \nWhile the fruit is exported to more than 20 countries in Europe, North America, Australasia, and \nthe  Middle  East,  Chinese  dates  are  largely  consumed  by  Chinese  communities  in  these \ncountries. By far, the largest market is domestic, which accounts for 98% of Chinese date sales. \nIn spite of a doubling of output in recent years, there is no indication of oversupply. In Shanxi, \nfor many years, date production was mainly of low quality varieties that did not provide much \nprofit for farmers. Government initiatives for the last few years have promoted diversification into \nhigh-quality varieties for which demand is strong and expected to grow. Shanxi also has a \nmodern date-processing industry accounting for 50% of national production. Shanxi plans to \nincrease the area from about 370,000 ha in 2006 to 540,000 ha by 2010.  \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                                 Appendix 2            3  1                         \n8.  Livestock Products. Although the PRC is a major exporter of live pigs and processed \npork products, more than 300,000 tons in 2008, it also imports about the same volume of pork \nproducts. In recent years, Shanxi has been a net importer of pigs and pork products from other \nprovinces;  especially  after  the  2006\u20132007  blue-ear  epidemic  (also  known  as  Porcine \nReproductive and Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, which resulted in significant market and \nprice instability. SPG took immediate steps to contain the outbreak and provided longer-term \nstability to support the local pig industry. With increasing urbanization and disposable incomes, \ndemand for pork, poultry, and beef products is expected to grow significantly. Environmentally \nsafe and hygienic production practices, product safety and quality at processing, and efficient \nmarketing practices will be the key to future development of the livestock industry in Shanxi. \n  2.  Farm\u2013Market Linkages  \n9.  A survey of marketing systems in the project area conducted during project preparation \nindicates a wide range of marketing channels for agricultural products. The main channels are \neither brokers or farmer associations. The project area has about 270,000 brokers or farmer \nagents; a majority run small-scale operations in specific locations or for a particular product or \nmarket niche. Only around 4,500 brokers are of a larger scale, with annual turnover in excess of \nCNY100,000, and with an average customer base of around 30,000 farmers. About 1,220 \nregistered  intermediary  agencies,  such  as  farmer  associations,  deal  with  a  variety  of \ncommodities\u2014their coverage and effectiveness varies. In some areas, associations are well \ndeveloped and about half of local farmers are members. For others, coverage is lower with only \nabout 10% of area farmers as members. In addition, the area has 18,000 farmer cooperatives \n(with 220,000 members), 611 registered technical associations, 92 wholesale markets, and 146 \nrural markets. \n10.  A small but significant marketing channel for project area farmers is through 575 agro-\nenterprises that process produce for sale in local, national, and international markets. Of these, \n195 have established production bases. About 250 have turnovers in excess of CNY1.0 million \n($130,000).  The  province  has  a  general  shortage  of  storage  capacity.  The  Department  of \nAgriculture estimates that for fruit, total storage capacity is 150 million tons while the annual \noutput is around 500 million tons. The project area survey identifies key marketing constraints \nfaced by farmers, including (i) need for improved linkages with agro-enterprises to provide \nalternative outlets, (ii) more effective role by farmer associations, (iii) improved access to market \nand price information, and (iv) improved access to advice on marketing. \n3.  Rural Finance \n11.  Financial markets in Shanxi are going through similar developments as those in the rest \nof the country since 2005. Financial institutions in the PRC include four large state-owned \nbanks, a postal savings bank, urban commercial banks, and rural cooperative banks. Others \ninclude  microcredit  companies,  nongovernment  organization  microfinance  institutions,  rural \ncredit cooperatives (RCCs), and lending companies. In addition, credit to the rural sector is \nprovided by the municipal and county finance bureaus from funds provided by the provincial \nbudget, Poverty Alleviation and Development Office, and international projects. \n12.  The main rural financial institutions are the Agriculture Bank of China, the Agricultural \nDevelopment Bank of China, the RCCs, and the Postal Savings Bank. For the last 4 years, the \nAgriculture Bank of China has been consolidating its services and focusing on profitability and \nefficiency of loan operations. Accordingly, it has closed numerous rural branches and restricted \nlending operations to a centralized system, including lending only 50%\u201360% of deposit bases in \nrural areas in Shanxi. The Agricultural Development Bank of China currently has insufficient \nfunds or offices to expand services for agricultural transformation of the type proposed under \nthe Project. RCCs in Shanxi are in the early stages of transformation to become more efficient \ninstitutions. These reforms have been completed in only four counties. Other county RCCs are \n ", "32          Appendix 2   \nunable to mobilize sufficient liquidity or staff capacity to provide new lending services of the type \nproposed  under  the  Project\u2014long-term  loans  to  support  farmers'  transition  to  high-value \nproduction bases and expand agro-enterprise operations. These financial institutions lend for \nshort periods, generally require significant collateral, and lend largely to state-owned enterprises \nand large firms. Studies in the PRC show that small urban and rural enterprises are able to \nfinance only about 20% of their needs from formal financial institutions. Loans are provided \nmainly to big firms and those in urban areas with large fixed assets. In the PRC, firms are still \nborrowing largely from the informal market, almost 43% overall compared with about 9% in \ncomparable countries.  \n13.  Three key issues that have affected access to rural finance in Shanxi and elsewhere in \nthe  PRC  are  (i)  interest  rate  control,  (ii)  methods  to  assess  and  manage  credit  risk,  and  \n(iii) availability of collateral or security. The Government has employed the interest rate control \npolicy as a means to prevent usurious practices and protect farmers and rural households. \nHowever, it has also had the unintended impact of limiting the development of loan products \nthat are more suitable to farmers' needs. Recently, additional flexibility was provided to banks \nand  nonbank  financial  institutions  in  the  application  of  interest  rate  rules.  However,  the \nintroduction of new products has been slow. \n14.  The availability of collateral is a significant problem for agro-enterprises and farmers who \nwish to undertake substantial capital investment. Financial institutions are innovating by using \ngroup guarantee arrangements and cash flow analysis of firms. In rural areas, land is not \nindividually owned and cannot be used as collateral by households. The province does not have \na system of fixed asset valuations operating in rural areas; many agro-enterprises are new, and \nno history of comparable developments and sales is available to help banks realistically assess \nthe collateral value. Accordingly, smaller agro-enterprises have difficulty securing loans. \n15.  The Project will fill financial product gaps in rural lending by taking five initiatives. First, \nmedium to long-term loans (1.5\u20138 years) will be provided to households to make a transition to \nproducing high-value products. Such long-term financing is currently not available to farmers or \nagro-enterprises from financial institutions, and will enable them to make significant investments \nand increase household incomes over time. Second, loan security will be provided using group \nguarantees. The 24 participating agro-enterprises will buy back farm outputs and provide a \nguarantee  for  beneficiary  farmers.  The  village  leaders  will  provide  guarantee  for  poor \nhouseholds that have not borrowed previously but have capacity and character to borrow. Fixed \nassets will be pledged for loans to agro-enterprises. The borrower selection process will be \nsimilar to that of risk assessments by financial institutions, except that the local finance bureaus \nwill manage the process and take the risk. The loan portfolio will be managed the same way as \nby financial institutions, demonstrating the creditworthiness of borrowers. Third, the proposed \nloans  to  five  agro-enterprises  will  enable  them  to  increase  their  capital  base  and  expand \noperations. The due diligence review has been completed, confirming that they have the interest \nand capacity to use funds appropriately and repay on time and in full. Data shows that these \nagro-enterprises have accessed funds from informal sources and (for two) from the Agriculture \nBank of China in smaller amounts and have a good credit history. Fourth, the loans to farmers \nwill be disbursed rather than reimbursed. Poor farmers, who do not have cash at hand to make \nthe initial purchases, can receive funds and use them to make the necessary input payments. \nFifth, if borrowers wish, tracking and reporting data will be provided to financial institutions. This \nwill help borrowers develop a credit history that can be shared with formal financial institutions. \nWith a good credit history, both agro-enterprises and farm households can go to financial \ninstitutions to seek credit to expand their operations in the future.  \n ", "Appendix 3  33\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nAmount\nDonor Project Title  Year ($ million)\nAsian Development Bank\nHexian Pulp Mill  1988            49.60\nAgricultural Bank of China 1990            50.00\nGuangdong Tropical Crops Development 1992            55.00\nYunnan-Simao Forestation and Sustainable Wood Utilization 1994            77.00\nSecond Agricultural Bank of China 1995          100.00\nHainan Agriculture and Natural Resources Development 1995            53.00\nFujian Soil Conservation and Rural Development 1995            65.00\nZhejiang-Shanxi Water Supply Project (Phase I) 1997          100.00\nNortheast Flood Damage Rehabilitation: Inner\nMongolia Autonomous Region 1999          110.00\nNortheast Flood Damage Rehabilitation: Heilongjiang Province 1999          110.00\nNortheast Flood Damage Rehabilitation: Jilin Province 1999          110.00\nWest Henan Agriculture Development  2001            69.23\nYellow River Flood Management  2001          150.00\nSonghua River Flood Control Management Sector  2002          150.00\nEfficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes Project  2002            33.12\nFujian Soil Conservation and Rural Development II 2004            80.00\nSanjiang Plain Wetlands Protection 2005            15.00\nHunan Flood Management Sector 2006          200.00\nHenan Sustainable Agriculture and Productivity Improvement 2007            66.70\nWorld Bank\nHenan Agriculture Development 1991          110.00\nHenan Highway  1993          120.00\nLoess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation    1994          100.00\nYangtze Basin Water Resources  1995          210.00\nHenan Provincial Highway   1996          210.00\nShanxi Poverty Alleviation   1996          100.00\nSeed Sector Commercialization  1996            80.00\nAnning Valley Agricultural Development  1999          120.00\nSmallholder Cattle Development  1999            93.50\nSecond Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation   1999          100.00\nForestry Development Project in Poor Area 1999              4.90\nThird Henan Provincial Highway  2000          150.00\nWater Conservation  2000            78.00\nHenan Towns Water Supply and Sanitation 2006          150.00\nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (\u00a5 million)\n  Huai River Henan Water Pollution Control  1997       4,945.00\nHenan Panshitou Reservoir Construction  1998       6,734.00\nXinxiang\u2013Zhengzhou Highway Construction 2000     23,491.00\nHenan Environment Protection  2003     19,295.00\nInland Henan Higher Education 2003       4,699.00\nPublic Health Project (Henan Province)  2004       5,016.00\nHenan Province Afforestation  2006       7,343.00\nKfW Sino-Germany Finance Cooperation ($ million)\nHenan Province Small Household Afforestation  2004              3.43\nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n ", "34          Appendix 4   \nCRITERIA TO SELECT PROJECT COUNTIES, SITES, AND ACTIVITIES \n \n1.

The total cost of this demonstration project is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. The \nMulti-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF)1 will provide \ngrant cofinancing equivalent to $500,000. The Government will provide the remaining $100,000 \nequivalent  to  cover  in-kind  counterpart  costs  and  services.  The  WFPF  grant  will  support \nconsulting services, water-saving equipment for irrigation and groundwater monitoring, training \nand workshops, and contingencies and reporting. Three individual consultants will be engaged \nto implement the demonstration project: an irrigation specialist and team leader (national), a \nhydrogeologist  (national),  and  a  water  resources  specialist  (international).  A  more  detailed \nconcept note is provided in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n2.  The demonstration project will be implemented over 2 years from January 2010 to \nDecember 2011. The project management office in Taiyuan will be responsible for the day-to-\nday operations and coordination with the participating municipal and county water resources \nbureaus (WRBs). The activities will assist farmers to cope with dwindling groundwater resources \nresulting  from  overuse  and  climate  change,  while  maintaining  or  increasing  their  farm \nproductivity and income. The impact will be sustainable use of groundwater resources in the 26 \nproject  counties.  The  outcome  will  be  the  sustainable  application  of  water  conservation \ntechniques  and  improved  water  resources  management  in  five  project  counties  where \ngroundwater scarcity is acute. \n \n3.  The outputs will include (i) demonstration of more productive, efficient, and economical \nirrigation  techniques;  and  (ii)  improved  groundwater  governance  through  effective \nimplementation of national and provincial regulations and capacity building. These initiatives will \nprovide examples\u2014replicable in other project and nonproject counties of Shanxi and other \nprovinces\u2014of improved groundwater management to adapt to climate change impacts. The \nexperience and findings will be presented in a national workshop in Shanxi and summarized in \nan Asian Development Bank knowledge product. \n \n4.  The  participating  farmers  will  be  supported  to  adopt  water-saving  technologies, \nespecially drip irrigation. Activities include support for purchasing and installing water-saving \nand monitoring equipment. Support will focus on poor households that will borrow from the \nProject to make a transition to high-value and less water-demanding crops. About 150 poor \nhouseholds will be provided with a subsidy to purchase water-saving irrigation equipment to \ndefray the marginal cost that may be over and above the cost of their traditional irrigation \nsystem.  The  subsidy  will  encourage  them  to  adopt  modern  irrigation  technology  without \nadditional cost, and show-case the benefits of this technology to other farm households. The \ncapacity-building  activity  will  implement  a  training  program  for  WRBs  to  learn  improved \nirrigation, surveying, and monitoring techniques. The program will also develop and conduct \ndirect  and  indirect  skills  training  of  an  estimated  5,000  farmers  to  adopt  modern  and \nenvironmentally sound water-saving techniques.   \n \n5.  Most farmers involved in the Project will use groundwater for irrigation. To improve \ngroundwater management, the demonstration project will strengthen the provincial groundwater \nmonitoring system, including support to update the inventory of current groundwater usage and \ndemand  estimates.  WRBs  will  develop  groundwater  management  alternatives  based  on \ngroundwater  supply  and  demand;  and  support  for  implementing  the  regulatory  framework, \nincluding the preparation of a strategy to address water-related climate change adaptation in the \nprovince and a study on possible economic incentives to promote water savings. \n                                                 \n1 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, and Spain. \n ", "40          Appendix 8   \nWOMEN\u2019S ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PILOT PROJECT \n \n1.  In rural areas of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), women are increasingly taking \ncharge of agriculture. Shanxi is no exception. More than 35% of men migrate seasonally or \npermanently  to  urban  centers  or  coal  mines,  leaving  women  to  manage  agricultural  and \nlivestock production and marketing, as well as household and family responsibilities. Despite \ntheir considerable contribution, women are not getting sufficient economic benefits. Women \naccount for 44% of the total labor force in the 26 project counties. However, in 13 counties, the \npercentage of women engaged in paid labor activities is only 11%\u201321%.1 This implies that \nwomen are primarily engaged in household chores and small-scale backyard animal rearing or \nsporadic crop farming that does not generate significant cash income. Supporting rural women \nto  realize  higher  income  contributes  to  improved  overall  social  welfare.  Moreover,  greater \neconomic  power  shifts  the  gender  dynamics,  helping  women  exert  their  rights,  voice  their \nneeds, and play a greater role in planning and decision-making.  \n \n2.  A pilot project to enhance economic empowerment of poor rural women was prepared \nfor  estimated  $285,000  equivalent.  The  Gender  and  Development  Cooperation  Fund2  will \nprovide grant cofinancing equivalent to $195,000. The Government will provide the remaining \n$90,000 equivalent to cover in-kind counterpart costs and services. The proposed pilot aims to \nenhance women\u2019s access to economic opportunities through a modified village banking model \nthat combines microfinance and collective purchase and sale of agricultural products. The pilot \nproject will be implemented over 2 years, from January 2010 to December 2011, in four villages \nof Daning and Liulin counties where poverty and male out-migration rates are high.  \n \n3.  The impact of the pilot project is the advancement of gender equality through women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment in Shanxi. The outcome is women\u2019s enhanced access to economic \nopportunities in target villages through support to women\u2019s production groups and capacity \nbuilding. The pilot has three components (i) building capacity for women\u2019s production and village \nbanking  groups;  (ii)  providing  microfinance  to  women\u2019s  production  groups,  and  \n(iii) strengthening the capacity of local government agencies including the All China Women's \nFederation and the project management office to support women's economic empowerment.  \n \n4.  Under the pilot project, in the first cycle, about 20 women's production groups (five \ngroups in each of the four villages, seven women in each group) will be organized and trained. \nA revolving fund, for about $100,000 equivalent, will be set up to extend microfinance (about \nCNY5,000 or $730 per women), to individuals but guaranteed by the group. Loan delivery, \napproval, and repayment processes will be managed by setting up microfinance cooperatives. A \nnongovernment organization will be engaged to provide (i) technical training to beneficiary \nwomen, (ii) support to form microfinance cooperatives, and (iii) appropriate training to project \nmanagement  office  and  local  government  officials.  A  nongovernment  organization  will  be \nengaged following the single-source selection procedure because this is a specialized task and \nthe engagement will be undertaken through direct negotiations. Upon completion of the pilot, an \nevaluation will examine the efficacy of the model and ways to improve, sustain, and scale it up \nwithin the Project. A national individual consultant will be engaged for monitoring and evaluation \nactivities.  An  indicative  implementation  schedule  and  more  details  of  the  pilot  project  are \nprovided in the concept note in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n                                                 \n1  Source: Socioeconomic household survey conducted by the project management office in May 2007.

The indicative loan and grant funds flow is laid out in Figure A10. Subloan approval \nauthority will be delegated to the municipal or county finance bureaus (MFBs, CFBs). Subloan \nterms are set out in the Project Agreement. Subloans to farmers will be made in cash by the \nrespective CFBs. Priority will be given to those who are designated by the Poverty Alleviation \nand Development Office (PADO) as poverty households if they also meet the Project's selection \ncriteria (Appendix 4). Individual farmers will submit subloan applications to their local township \nfinance  station  (TFS),  which  will  undertake  an  initial  assessment  of  eligibility.  Eligible \napplications will be reviewed by the relevant Project Implementation Units and forwarded to \nCFBs for approved. Subloans in excess of the CFB's lending authority will be reviewed, and \nwhere applicable, forwarded to the relevant MFB with a recommendation for approval. \n \n2.  Once a subloan is approved, the CFB will enter into a subloan agreement with the \napplicant, which will include the method of disbursement. For farmers, the applicable subloan \narrangements  will  include  (i)  a  subloan  agreement  between  the  farmer  and  CFB;  (ii)  as \nappropriate, an agreement between each farmer and the concerned agro-enterprise as buyer of \nfarm output and loan guarantor; and (iii) as appropriate, an agreement between the agro-\nenterprise  and  CFB  regarding  the  agro-enterprise's  guarantee  of  the  concerned  subloan \nrepayment. Draft model subloan agreements are in Supplementary Appendix D. Disbursement \nof subloans will be channeled from the CFB to the TFS, then directly to the farmer in cash but \ndrawn through a bank debit card.1 Subloan principal repayments for all farmers will be required \nin accordance with the expected cash flow from the specific investment being made, inclusive of \nan appropriate grace period for principal repayments and subject to the grace period limitations \nof the Asian Development Bank loan. Farmers will be required to pay the interest payments on a \nsemiannual basis with a maximum of 1-year grace period. The TFS and CFB will monitor \nimplementation  of  the  borrower's  investment,  accept  repayments  in  accordance  with  the \nagreement, and initiate any remedial action necessary to ensure proper implementation of the \ninvestment, utilization, and recovery of the subloan funds.  \n \n3.  For  subloans  to  agro-enterprises,  the  concerned  CFB  will  enter  into  a  subloan \nagreement and be responsible for disbursement, recovery, and monitoring of the utilization of \ninvestment funds. To ensure proper utilization, all subloans will be disbursed according to a \nschedule specified in the agreement that reflects the phasing of the investment and its cash \nflow. Where previous disbursements are not utilized in accordance with the subloan agreement, \nthe subloan borrowers will be required to take remedial action before further disbursements are \nmade. The MFB will also monitor implementation of the borrower's investment; recover the \nsubloan in accordance with the agreement; and initiate any remedial action necessary to ensure \nproper implementation of the investment, utilization, and recovery of the subloan funds.  \n \n4.  Municipal and county project implementation units, supervised by the MFB, CFB, and \nTFS, will monitor investment implementation to ensure compliance with government regulations \nand project eligibility and criteria. The MFB and CFB (with links to the TFS) portfolios of loans \nand subloans will be computerized\u2014with software consistent with that in use by other financial \ninstitutions lending to farmers and agro-enterprises\u2014integrated into other relevant accounting \nsystems  in  the  Shanxi  Finance  Department,  and  the  status  of  lending  and  repayment  of \nprincipal and interest reported monthly to the project management office.

Each borrowing farmer will \nbe issued a debit card to withdraw the subloan to defray investment costs. Similarly, the CFB and/or TFS will set \nup separate designated accounts, in the same local bank, for farmers to deposit subloan repayments.  \n ", "                                                                                                                    Appendix 10  43\ntake immediate action and document all steps to recover subloan repayments overdue beyond \n30 days and report to the project management office and Shanxi Finance Department on a \nmonthly basis.

Financial Analysis of Farm Investments \n1.  Methodology. Farm budget analysis was undertaken for each of the farm investments \nproposed under the Project to determine potential incremental returns to farmers. Based on field \nsurveys with farmers and of markets, technical, and price parameters were estimated for each \ninvestment. Input and output quantities and prices are based on 2008 values, adjusted where \nappropriate to reflect any seasonal or cyclical fluctuations observed over the preceding 3 years. \nResulting input and output values were used to prepare 20-year farm cash flows from which \nfinancial internal rates of return (FIRRs) were estimated. All farm investments involve farmers \nforegoing  existing  farming  operations  or  off-farm  income  earning  opportunities  in  order  to \nundertake the proposed activities. Current farm operations and related incomes and costs were \nestimated to determine current net income. These were deducted from the net income deriving \nfrom  the  proposed  investment  to  determine  incremental  FIRRs  and  incremental  returns  to \nhousehold labor. Current net income is assumed to represent future without-project net income \non the basis that scope for improving farm productivity is limited. In fact, the continued use of \ntraditional farming practices is likely to result in a decline in productivity and, therefore, incomes. \nThe use of current net incomes to determine incremental net incomes under the Project may be \nconsidered conservative, as incremental returns are actually likely to rise over time. Actual \nincremental returns to farmers will be greater since the cost of their labor is included in the \noperating  cost  of  each  investment.  However,  not  all  of  the  labor  cost  included  relates  to \nhousehold labor, as some will be hired from outside the household. \n2.  Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to determine the risk to rates of return and net \nincomes of adverse movements in revenues and costs, which may result from changes in input \nand output quantities and/or prices. Switching values were calculated to determine the extent to \nwhich  costs  can  increase  or  revenues  decrease  before  an  investment's  FIRR  falls  to  the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC), indicating that larger increases in costs or falls in \nrevenue would make the investment nonviable. The WACC of each investment was estimated \nin  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank,using the relative proportions of \n \neach source used in financing each investment and their relative costs, and an estimate of \ninflation rates applicable to the various sources. The three sources of investment are (i) loan \nfinance under the Project; (ii) a household's own equity contribution that principally comprises \nin-kind household labor for which an imputed value equal to the prevailing wage for agricultural \nlabor was applied; and (iii) where appropriate, a contribution from the local government budget. \nA single WACC was used for all on-farm investments, based on weighted average contributions \nfor project loans of 53%, government 10%, and farmers 37%. \n3.  The analysis of the investments of five agro-enterprises is based on the estimate of input \nand  output,  technical,  and  financial  parameters  derived  from  discussions  with  each  agro-\nenterprise and a market analysis for each output. FIRRs and switching values are calculated for \n20-year cash flow. Agro-enterprise investments will be financed only by a loan from the Project \nand equity. No government contribution is proposed for the five private sector agro-enterprises. \nA separate WACC was calculated for each agro-enterprise. Although each of the five agro-\nenterprise investments represent an expansion in storage capacity or the introduction of a new \nproduct line rather than completely new ventures, the analysis assumes that the build-up to full \ncapacity utilization, which will only be reached in the third year after the investment is made, will \nbe phased. The agro-enterprises could reach full capacity utilization before the third year, in \nwhich case actual FIRRs will be higher than those estimated. The analysis also assumes that \nno existing production will be foregone to make the proposed investment.

Perennial Crops. The FIRRs indicate the viability of all investments in perennial crops. \nInvestments in Chinese herbs, both rainfed and irrigated, have relatively low FIRRs but they \nremain above the WACC of 5.1%. With the exception of rainfed Chinese herbs, none of the \ninvestments in perennial crops are sensitive to negative changes in revenue or investment and \noperating costs. In the case of rainfed Chinese herbs, the switching value for revenue is 12% \nand for operating costs 17%. This indicates a higher degree of risk but is considered to be well \nwithin limits that are manageable by farmers who have experience in the cultivation of herbs. \nIncremental  annual  net  incomes  range  from  CNY2,480  for  prickly  ash  investments  to \n ", "52         Appendix 14   \nCNY18,270 for the investment in fast-growing poplar trees. These compare favorably with the \ncurrent estimated income for poor and low-income households. \n5.  Annual  Crops.  All  greenhouse  investments  have  FIRRs  of  about  17%  or  above, \nindicating their viability. None of the greenhouse investments are sensitive to adverse changes \nin revenue or cost. Incremental annual net incomes from greenhouse investments show a \nsignificant  increase  over  current  poverty  income  levels,  with  the  exception  of  the  tunnel \ngreenhouse for which the incremental annual net income is relatively low at CNY1,500. The \nproduction of vegetables in greenhouses lends itself well to the introduction of improved farming \npractices.  Linking  greenhouse  growers  to  the  Project's  initiative  to  create  linkages  to  the \nChinaGAP certification program offers the potential for higher income through improved product \nquality and marketability and related price premiums. The investment in millet production has an \nacceptable FIRR of 17.4% and is robust with respect to adverse changes in revenue and costs. \nThe incremental annual net income of CNY1,270, is low compared with other project-supported \nfarm investments.  \n6.  Livestock. With the exception of pig breeding, all the proposed livestock investments \nare viable with incremental FIRRs above 12%. The incremental FIRR for pig breeding is 9.6%, \nwhich is relatively low but remains well above the WACC. Sensitivity analysis suggests that a \nnumber of the livestock investments are sensitive to changes in revenue and operating costs. \nThe  pig  investments,  cattle  fattening,  and  chicken  investments  show  switching  values  for \nrevenue and operating costs between 4% and 8%. This suggests the need for effective cost \ncontrol and proactive marketing on the part of livestock farmers to maintain the volume and \nquality of product sales. These risks are mitigated to an extent by the strong demand and \nupward trend in market prices for livestock products in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nthough livestock product markets are often subject to shocks resulting from the outbreak of \ndisease. Risks may be further mitigated with support from technical service agencies to assist \nfarmers in arranging supply contracts with agro-enterprises. Nonetheless, careful appraisal of \nthese investments will need to be undertaken at the time of subloan application to review and \nupdate investment assumptions. \n7.  On-Farm Processing. Both on-farm processing investments are viable. The investment \nin household storage is also robust in relation to negative movements in revenues and costs. \nThe investment in household storage would be undertaken by 10 households, which would \nresult in a relatively high investment cost per household of CNY53,000. However, incremental \nannual net income per household is also high at CNY9,400. \n8.  The investment in date drying is sensitive to adverse changes in revenue and operating \ncosts with switching values of 8.4% and 9.7%, respectively, indicating the need for both careful \ncost control and effective marketing. The high demand for Chinese dates and existing network \nof brokers competing for product should mitigate the risk. However, the sensitivity analysis \npoints to the need for detailed appraisal at the time of loan application to reassess prevailing \nmarket conditions and financial and technical parameters. Under the Project, a number of \nhouseholds would jointly invest in the date-drying facility, mainly to process their own crop. The \nrelatively low incremental annual net income of CNY8,000 suggests returns per household \nwould be low if more than 3\u20134 households invested in the drying unit. However, the investment \ncost is also relatively low, and with 3\u20134 households combining to make the investment, the \ninvestment per household would be in line with other on-farm investments. For both on-farm \nprocessing investments where a number of households collaborate in the activity, support from \nproject agencies will be required to ensure that operating and financial modalities are effective, \nfully supported, and adhered to by all participating households. Interhousehold disputes could \n ", "                                                                                                          Appendix 14   53\nundermine the viability of the investments, especially in the case of date drying, which appears \nsensitive to adverse revenue and cost movements. \nB.  Financial Analysis of Agro-Enterprises \n9.  All  five  agro-enterprises  are  assessed  to  be  eligible  according  to  socioeconomic, \nenvironmental, and financial criteria (Appendix 6). An analysis of the historical performance of \neach agro-enterprise, based on a review of the last 3 years' financial statements, and the \nprojected performance with the proposed investment, indicates that they are financially sound \nand their investment proposals financially viable.  \n10.  Huarong Fruit Production Company was established in April 2002 with registered \ncapital of CNY5 million. It is located in Wanrong County and operates temperature-controlled  \nstorage  with  a  capacity  of  2,000  tons  mainly  for  apples.  It  has  160  staff,  including  \n10 management and 5 experienced technicians. More than 90% of the company's apple output \nis  exported  to  Germany,  United  Kingdom,  Netherlands,  Singapore,  India,  and  Thailand. \nHuarong\u2019s total assets have risen steadily in the last 3 years to reach CNY19.2 million. Over the \nsame period, equity increased to CNY12.0 million. Sales revenue increased by 6% in 2007, \nreaching  CNY11.5  million  and  increased  by  35%  in  2008,  reaching  CNY10.3  million.  The \ncompany proposes to expand storage capacity by 2,000 tons at a cost of CNY6.6 million, of \nwhich  CNY3.0  million  will  be  financed  from  project  loan  funds,  and  the  balance  from  the \ncompany's own sources. Financial analysis shows that the FIRR for the investment is 22.9%, \nand the investment is marginally sensitive to adverse changes in revenue and operating costs \nwith switching values of 9% and 11%, respectively.  \n11.  Longlang Fruit Company was founded by local farmers in 2004 with registered capital \nof CNY0.5 million. It operates a cold store facility of 1,750-ton capacity for local pear farmers. It \nhas more than 80 staff, including 60 women. Longlang has state green-food certification and \nexports two-thirds of its output to the European Union, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. \nLonglang\u2019s total assets increased by 7% in 2007, and in 2008 were CNY7.0 million by the end \nof July 2008. Equity increased significantly in the last 3 years to CNY5.6 million by the end of \nJuly 2008. Sales revenue increased by 67% in 2006, but fell by 53% in 2007 as a result of \nreduced production of pears due to severe weather in the spring of 2006. Sales in 2007 \namounted to CNY15.4 million and had reached CNY15 million by the end of July 2008. The \ncompany's investment proposal includes expanding cold storage capacity for fruit by 600 tons, \nfor a proposed total investment of CNY2.4 million, of which CNY1.0 million will be financed from \nproject loan funds, and the remainder from the enterprise\u2019s own sources. Financial analysis \nshows  that  the  FIRR  for  the  investment  is  16.1%.  Sensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  it  is \nmoderately sensitive to reduced revenue and increased operating costs, with switching values \nof 7% and 8%, respectively. \n12.  Qinzhou Yellow Millet Company was established in 1992 as a state-owned enterprise. \nIt was bought from the state in 2000 by four persons (with a combined shareholding of 83%, \nwith one person holding 74%) and an investment management company, which owns 2% of the \nshares. Other small shareholders account for the remaining equity. The registered capital is \nCNY0.5 million. The company has 150 staff, including 110 women. The company packs and \nsells high-quality millet products with sales of around 7,500 tons per year, representing more \nthan 40% of the total PRC market. Total assets increased over the last 3 years reaching \nCNY103.3 million in 2008. Equity also increased to CNY90.8 million to 2008. Sales revenue \namounted to CNY48.2 million and net profit after tax to CNY4.3 million in 2008. The company's \ninvestment proposal includes establishing 2,000-ton capacity cold storage for millet at a cost of \nCNY7.6 million, of which CNY3.5 million is to be financed from project loan funds, and the \n ", "54         Appendix 14   \nbalance from the company's own resources. The FIRR of the proposed investment is 22.6%. \nSensitivity analysis suggests that the investment is slightly sensitive to negative changes in \nrevenue with a switching value of 9%, and operating costs with a switching value of 10%.  \n13.  Xintai Food Company is a joint stock company founded by a single individual who \nowns 55% of the equity and is the company manager. The remaining shares are held by three \nstate investment companies at provincial (25% equity), municipal (15% equity) and county (2% \nequity) levels. The company was established in December 1998 with registered capital of \nCNY13.0 million. It has 390 staff including 310 women. The company produces dried fruit (in \nparticular Chinese dates and walnuts) and vegetables using five processing lines, with an output \nof 6,000\u20137,500 tons per year. Xintai\u2019s total assets rose to CNY60.1 million in 2008, and equity \nremained steady at around CNY33.0 million. Sales revenue rose by 23% in 2006, and by 2% in \n2007 to CNY78.6 million, then fell to CNY51.0 million in 2008. Net profit after tax followed the \nsame trend, rising by 78% in 2006, but falling by 4% in 2007 to CNY3.6 million and again falling \nby 33% to CNY2.4 million in 2008. The fall in sales in 2007 resulted from reduced Chinese date \nproduction  following  rain  during  harvest  and  in  2008  reflected  the  cyclical  nature  of  fresh \nvegetable marketing. The proposed investment is to establish a 2,000-ton per year processing \nline  for  pickled  vegetables,  and  to  increase  storage  for  fresh  produce  raw  materials.  The \nproposed total investment is CNY8.5 million, of which CNY4.0 million is to be financed from the \nproject loan. Financial analysis shows that the FIRR of the proposed investment is 16.3%. \nSensitivity analysis indicates that the investment is relatively sensitive to revenue and operating \ncosts with switching values of only 4% and 5%, respectively.  \n14.  Zeyu Livestock Development Company was founded in 2003 with registered capital of \nCNY5.5 million. It has 82 staff including 38 women. The company slaughters pigs and produces \npork products, with a capacity of 1,500 head per day, and operates refrigerated storage with a \ncapacity of 500 tons. Pork products are sold to large retail outlets in Jinzhong municipality and \nTaiyuan city. Due to widespread disease in pigs in 2006, capacity utilization fell dramatically to \naround 400 head per day. The disease problem is no longer an issue, and with a combination of \nGovernment policy aimed at preventing similar outbreaks and/or mitigating their effects, and the \npromotional efforts of the company itself, the situation is improving. Zeyu\u2019s total assets have \nrisen significantly over the last 3 years, reaching CNY23.2 million in 2007 and CNY27.7 million \nin 2008. Equity also increased significantly, rising to CNY16.2 million in 2007. Sales revenue \nincreased by 508% in 2007 due to both increased production and significantly higher pork prices \nfollowing the disease problem in 2006. Revenue in 2007 was CNY116.6 million. Net profit after \ntax rose in 2007 to CNY4.4 million, an increase of almost 200%, reflecting the increased prices \nachieved for pork products. Net profit after tax fell to CNY1.0 million in 2008 due to rapid \nexpansion, increased liabilities, and consequently higher interest repayments. The company's \ninvestment proposal includes establishing additional refrigerated storage for meat products of \n500 tons. The cost of the investment is CNY8.1 million, of which CNY3.5 million will be financed \nfrom  project  loan  funds,  and  the  remainder  from  Zeyu's  own  sources.  The  FIRR  for  the \nproposed investment is 17.8%. It is, however, highly sensitive to a fall in revenue or an increase \nin operating costs, with switching values of 2% for both. \nC.  Economic Analysis of Project Investments \n15.  Methodology. The economic analysis was carried out using the world price numeraire.1 \nTraded  goods  and  services  were  converted  to  their  border  price  equivalent  values  and \nnontraded goods and services at their financial market prices. Three outputs (walnuts, apples, \nand asparagus) and two inputs (fertilizers and pesticides) were treated as traded. The economic \n                                                 \n1  A detailed discussion of the methodology and results of the analysis are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n ", "                                                                                                          Appendix 14   55\nconversion factors derived for walnuts and apples are also used for pears and Chinese dates. \nWhile the PRC has a significant trade in livestock products, none of the livestock output from the \nProject is expected to be traded outside of Shanxi, which is a net importer of livestock products. \nIncremental  net  economic  benefits,  based  on  the  derivation  of  financial  cash  flows,  were \nestimated for each of the activities to be supported under the Project. Without-project returns \nare based on existing cropping activity in areas to be converted to new, largely perennial crops. \nGiven the expected continued degradation and decline in the productivity of land, especially in \nmarginal areas, the analysis assumes no increase in without-project benefits over time. For \ninvestments that do not involve converting existing agricultural activities, without-project benefits \nare estimated on the basis of the nominal income foregone calculated from the number of days \nthat need to be diverted to new activities and an imputed wage rate. The wage rate used is \nbased on the market wage rate and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.84. Incremental net benefits \nof individual investments are aggregated for the Project as a whole based on the number and \nphasing of activities over the life of the Project. Project establishment costs\u2014not related to farm \nor agro-enterprise investments including farmer training, capacity building in technical support \nservices, and project management\u2014were converted to economic values by deducting taxes and \nduties, and converting domestic value added components using a standard conversion factor of \n0.93. The resulting project net incremental cash flow is used to derive an economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) over a 20-year period. \n16.  Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis. The estimated EIRR of \nthe Project is 19.5%. This relatively high rate of return reflects the fact that incremental returns \nare  high,  especially  as  farmers  convert  lower  value  field  crops  to  perennial  crops.  Also, \nincremental  returns  from  on-farm  processing  and  livestock  activities  are  based  upon  the \nopportunity cost of labor income forgone from current off-farm employment for which wage rates \nare low given the oversupply of labor in rural areas, especially during off-peak periods, which is \nreflected in high out-migration of labor. \n17.  Because of the wide range of activities to be supported under the Project, only four \nactivities account for more than 5% of the total net incremental benefit of the Project. Pork \nproducts production, which accounts for 15.3% of the total, is the major contributor. The other \nmajor contributors to total net incremental benefit are walnut production in hilly areas (9.2%), \ncattle fattening (7.5%), and table apples (6.0%). In terms of groups of activities, perennial crops \ncontribute 33.9% of total net incremental benefit, livestock 29.6%, and agroprocessing 24.7%, \ntogether accounting for 88.2%. The spread of benefits across multiple activities indicates that \nthe Project is not sensitive to potential negative changes in respect of the proposed activities. If \nno benefit is realized from pork products, the EIRR would only fall to 19.3%. Similarly, if the \nentire net incremental benefit from perennial crops is not realized, the EIRR would fall to 12.3%, \nstill above the assumed opportunity cost of capital of 12%. Sensitivity to negative changes in the \nincremental returns from all other individual activities is negligible. A failure to achieve any \nbenefit from the Project's productive investments is highly unlikely. This also does not allow for \nany reduction in project costs for such activities as capacity building in technical services, \nfarmer training, and project management related to these activities, which would inevitably occur \nif a whole subcomponent or activity is dropped from the Project. That equates to the improbable \nsituation in which the Project provides all necessary capacity-building support for these activities \nbut results in no take-up in terms of productive activity.  \n18.  In economic prices, total project establishment, administration, and management costs \nover the 6 years of project implementation amount to CNY60.5 million. These costs must \nincrease almost 15 fold before the EIRR falls below the opportunity cost of capital Project \nmanagement  costs  account  for  60%  of  total  project  establishment,  administration,  and \nmanagement costs, and would have to increase almost 25 times to reduce the EIRR to the \n ", "56         Appendix 14   \nopportunity  cost  of  capital.  These  are  both  highly  improbable  scenarios.  Delays  in \nimplementation have the potential to adversely impact the Project. However, assuming that all \nproject capacity building and management activities proceed as planned but that there is a \ndelay of 1 year in the take-up of all productive activities the EIRR would only be reduced to \n19.1%.  A  delay  of  all  productive  activities  is  extremely  unlikely.  Therefore,  the  project \ninvestment is considered economically viable and robust to potential negative changes in key \nproject parameters. A detailed economic analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix J. \n19.  Indirect Economic Benefits. The persistence of traditional, extensive farming systems, \ncombined  with  a  large  population,  presents  a  major  threat  to  the  project  area's  natural \nresources, especially soil and water. Degradation of forests continues in spite of government \nefforts to restrict agricultural encroachment through programs such as the Land Conversion \nProject, which provides incentives to rural communities to conserve natural resources. The \nforested area in Shanxi declined from 405,000 hectares (ha) in 2000 to 140,000 ha in 2007. The \narea of fruit orchards declined by 3% over the same period from 289,000 ha to 280,000 ha.2 \nProtection and conservation of the remaining natural forests to protect natural resources, reduce \nsoil erosion, and maintain biodiversity are key government policies. The area of land cultivated \ndeclined by 14% between 2000 and 2007, from 4.34 million ha to 3.79 million ha. In 2007, the \narea of land under regular cultivation was 3.26 million ha (86% of the total). Of the land under \ntemporary cultivation, 241,800 ha was land with a slope of 25 degrees or more. The decline in \narea cultivated resulted in a decrease in the average area cultivated per person from 0.14 ha to \n0.11 ha. In spite of government efforts to promote diversification into more sustainable crops, \nthe area under grain has remained stable at around 80% of the area under regular cultivation \nsince 2000. Grain production represents a greater environmental risk than fruit tree crops due to \nhigher  water  requirement  and  soil  retention  characteristics.  Currently,  farmers  over  exploit \nfragile soils with little or no fallow period to allow soil fertility to recover. The Project will address \nthis by converting grain-producing land to fruit tree production, which will conserve water and \nsoil resources, increase forest cover and agricultural value added, and provide income and \nemployment opportunities in local communities that will act as an incentive to more sustainable, \nenvironmentally sound agricultural practices. This will be reinforced by collaboration with the \nChinaGAP initiative and certification of project farmers' adoption of improved farming practices. \nAnimal waste from the Project's livestock activities, having been properly composted, will offer a \nsafer and low-cost alternative to chemical fertilizers, decreasing their use in the long-run. The \nlinking of pig and cattle investments to complementary investments in biogas digesters offers \nthe  advantage  of  both  improving  the  quality  of  animal  compost  and  providing  a  cheap, \nrenewable source of energy for participating households.3  \n20.  The  savings  from  improved  irrigation,  from  adopting  water-saving  technologies  and \ntechniques and integrated pest management, and more effective application of fertilizers and \npesticides are significant; though the savings will not be universal across all project counties. \nDepending on the nature and number of activities to be established, specific counties may have \na net increase in water, fertilizer, and pesticide usage. Over the whole project area, annual \nwater  savings  are  estimated  at  approximately  3.8  million  cubic  meters  (CNY7.6  million). \nReduction in fertilizer usage is expected to be 2,300 tons, with an approximate economic value \nof CNY7.8 million. However, a net increase in the use of pesticides of 5.4 tons is expected with \nan estimated incremental cost of CNY0.6 million. The increase will result from their use with \nperennial crops compared with currently usage on annual crops. The net annual savings from \nreduced water, fertilizer, and pesticide uses are expected to be around CNY15 million. \n                                                 \n2  Shanxi Bureau of Statistics. 2008.

Taiyan: China Statistics Press (Tables 7\u201312). \n3  A qualitative assessment of the potential indirect, environmental benefits that may be expected to derive from the \nProject is presented in Supplementary Appendix K. \n ", " Appendix 15           5  7                          \n \nENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n \n1.  Environmental  analysis  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  national  environmental \nregulations  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The  Shanxi  provincial  government  (SPG) \nengaged China Agricultural University to conduct the environmental assessment and prepared \nthe environmental impact assessment reports and a summary initial environmental examination. \nThese  documents  were  reviewed  by  ADB  and  approved  by  the  provincial  Environmental \nProtection Department. Due diligence of the management practices of the 24 agro-enterprises \nshows that they are complying with the environmental regulations. These agro-enterprises will \nprovide support and credit guarantees for participating farmers. \n \nA.  Project Description \n \n2.  The Project will reduce resource degradation by promoting, adopting, and expanding \nenvironmentally  sound  modern  technologies  and  practices  in  the  production  of  high-value \nagricultural products. These products will be of high quality and safe for consumers, and ensure \nbetter returns for poor farmers and agro-enterprises. The Project will be implemented in the \ncentral and southern part of Shanxi, covering 26 counties and districts in five municipalities,  \n11 of which are poverty counties. The Project comprises four components (i) transition to high-\nvalue  production  by  adopting  technologies  and  practices  that  ensure  environmental \nsustainability  and  increase  farmers  income;  (ii)  strengthening  of  farm\u2013market  linkages  by \nsupporting  on-farm  and  industrial  agroprocessing  and  marketing  of  high-value  products;  \n(iii)  capacity  building  and  training  of  farmers,  farmer  associations,  and  technical  support \nagencies to support high-value production and processing of farm products; and (iv) project \nmanagement to support efficient implementation of the Project. The specific project outputs are \noutlined in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).   \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  The project area is mostly hilly where water pollution, soil erosion, and the loss of \nnitrogen and phosphorus in the soils are key concerns. Agrochemical use has resulted in \nincreased  residues  in  water,  soil,  agricultural  products.  Excessive  application  of  pesticides \nthreatens health of producers and consumers, and damages diversity in the agro-ecological \nsystem. The chemical pollution in water bodies and soil has adversely affected quantity and \nquality of agricultural products. Moreover, an increased amount of undecomposed waste-plastic \nmulch  is  left  in  the  soil  year  after  year,  having  a  negative  impact  on  the  soil's  physical \ncharacteristics and the growth of crops.  \n \n4.  Water scarcity and poor water quality hinder rural development. Unsustainable livestock \nproduction practices are gradually increasing in the province, resulting in the accumulation of \nlarge volumes of livestock waste; a major source of pollution in water, air, and soil; and spread \nof mosquitoes and flies. Unregulated and overuse of groundwater is a common practice. The \nprovince has a program to close deep wells in areas considered to be overexploited, while the \ncounties still insist on drilling and extracting more groundwater. Surface water is also overused \nand controlled through dams and reservoirs, and pollution is visible.  \n \n5.  The province has good plant diversity with more than 1,500 species of wild plants, which \ninclude over 500 species of woody plants, forming complex and diversified forest types. The \nprovince has preserved 17 wild species of plants. It has more than 439 terrestrial species of \nanimals; about 19% of the total number of such species in the country. The fruit and vegetable \n ", "58         Appendix 15   \nspecies included in the Project are not listed in the \u201cBiological List of Quarantine Harmful \nImported Plants in PRC\u201d (No. 862 Order issued by the Ministry of Agriculture). The main crops \nin the project areas are wheat, cotton, vegetables, potato, and perennial plants such as apple, \npear, walnut, Chinese dates, and herbs. Three harvests occur over every 2 year period in the \nmiddle south, two harvests in 1 year in the middle south of Shanxi, and one harvest per year in \nthe  north.  In  terms  of  their  regional  distribution,  agro-enterprises  play  an  effective  role  in \nextending value chain to the farms and markets.  \n \nC.  Screening of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n6.  The Project is expected to generate significant environmental benefits for Shanxi. The \nProject will support farmers to replace environmentally unsustainable practices by adopting \nmodern  and  appropriate  technologies  and  practices.  Support  for  transition  to  high-value \nperennial and annual crops will reduce erosion in higher sloped areas, improve efficiency in \nwater use, reduce application of agrochemicals, and help produce safer agriculture products.  \n \n7.  The increase in fruit area, over 11,000 ha, will have a positive impact on local ecology. \nCultivation of fruit trees will conserve water (prevent floods, increase flow during low water \nperiods, and improve water quality), maintain air balance, improve soil structure and fertility, and \npreserve biodiversity. Other environmental benefits are (i) reduced use of chemical fertilizers \nand increased use of organic manure; (ii) reduced wind speed due to increased tree cover over \n11,000 ha; (iii) about 35% saving in water through increased infiltration; and (iv) increased \nvegetative  cover  resulting  in  carbon  sequestration,  reduced  rainwater  run-off,  increased \nrecharge of groundwater, and reduced soil erosion.  \n \n8.  The project interventions will annually conserve about 3.8 million m3 of water and reduce \nfertilizer use by about 2,300 tons. The annual net savings from reduced water, fertilizer, and \npesticides will amount to around CNY15.0 million. But these savings will not be similar across all \nproject counties. Livestock interventions will provide health benefits by encouraging farmers to \ncollectively manage their herds in larger facilities and improving hygienic conditions in living \nareas, and reduce soil degradation by limiting free-grazing practices. The increased fruit and \nvegetable production will result in a net increase in pesticide use by 5.4 tons, with an estimated \nincremental cost of CNY0.6 million. Other potential adverse environmental impacts include \nincreased agricultural waste and standard construction impacts. The increased waste will be \nmitigated by adopting adequate waste treatment and disposal procedures, in accordance with \nPRC regulations and ADB guidelines. Livestock waste will be safely disposed of by composting \nand/or converting it into gas for home consumption using biogas digesters. During construction, \nthe main adverse impacts on the surrounding environment include waste gas emission, dust, \nnoise,  solid  wastes,  and  wastewater,  among  which  dust  and  construction  noise  are  most \nsignificant. Construction impacts will be mitigated to acceptable levels by applying a code of \npractice for all construction works.  \n \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n9.  SPG\u2019s project management office and project implementation units will be responsible \nfor  ensuring  compliance  with  environmental  safeguards  during  project  implementation. \nMonitoring will be jointly organized with the provincial and county environmental protection \nbureaus, which were involved in project preparation. Skills training will be provided to farmers to \nadopt  modern  and  environmentally  sound  technologies.  Provincial,  municipal,  and  county \ntechnical agency staff will receive training in workshops focusing on (i) improved crops and \nlivestock  production,  (ii)  efficient  irrigation  systems,  (iii)  integrated  pest  management,  \n ", "                                                                                                                  Appendix 15    59\n(iv) environmental monitoring, and (v) water balance monitoring. Training costs are included in \nthe project costs. \n \nE.  Public Consultations and Disclosure \n \n10.  Public participation in the environmental assessment was undertaken through public \nmeetings, interviews, and surveys during July and August in 2007. Survey questionnaires on \npublic participation for environmental protection of the Project were distributed to 2,400 village \nresidents. The respondents comprised people older than 50 years of age (13%), 40\u201350 years \n(40%), and 30\u201340 years (47%). The respondents included those with high school education \n(20%) and less than middle school education (80%). Interviews were also conducted with \nindividuals from rural households in the project area. All residents affected or living in the project \narea support the Project. A consultation meeting was also held with experts on 2 August 2007, \nhosted by the Center of Environmental Impact Appraisal, China Agriculture University, and the \nproject  management  office.  The  meeting  supported  project  interventions  and  proposed  an \nenvironmental management plan and mitigations measures. \n \nF.  Findings and Conclusions \n \n11.  The Project will have significant positive environmental impacts in the area, including \nreduced soil erosion and air pollution, increased forestation, and conservation of biodiversity. No \nsignificant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated  from  other  activities. Appropriate \nmitigation  measures  will  be  taken  against  any  adverse  impacts  resulting  from  livestock \nproduction, including conversion of animal waste to compost (reducing the use of chemical \nfertilizers),  and  biogas  (reducing  the  use  of  fossil  fuels).  Adoption  of  integrated  pest \nmanagement practices will reduce the use of pesticides and make vegetables and fruits safe. \nAppropriate mitigation measures and budget for environmental management and monitoring are \nprovided. Therefore, a full-scale environmental impact assessment was not required. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "60  Appendix 16 \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Shanxi Integrated Agricultural Development Project \n \nEast Asia Department/Agriculture, \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nLoan  Environment, and Natural Resources \nModality:  Division: \nDivision \nI.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: \nThe agriculture sector has played a major role in reducing poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Since the 1978 \nreforms, annual agricultural gross output has grown by 6.5% per annum. Rural income has increased more than three-fold since \n1980, reaching CNY4,800 in 2007. The overall rise in rural incomes has led to a dramatic fall in poverty. However, the pace of rural \nincome growth has lagged that of urban income resulting in widening inequity between rural and urban areas and between the \neastern region, and the central and western regions of the country. Poverty reduction in rural areas is one of the major objectives of \nthe Government. In the 11th Five-Year Plan 2006\u20132010, the Government shifted its overemphasis on growth to sustainable, more \ninclusive rural development, and social programs. One of the main objectives of the plan is to decrease income inequality between \nrural and urban areas, and between geographic regions. To highlight emphasis on sustainable agricultural development, the \nGovernment published its Policy Document on Modern Agriculture in January 2007. This initiated the New Socialist Countryside \nPolicy to redress the slow rate of growth of rural incomes and development and poor socioeconomic conditions of the PRC's 750 \nmillion farmers. The policy recognizes the persistent decline in natural resources and deteriorating environment, and places priority \non investments to (i) support sustainable rural growth, (ii) increase farm productivity, and (iii) raise rural incomes.    \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n1.    Key Issues \nProject interventions target 26 counties including 11 poverty counties. The key issues with poverty implications are (i) water scarcity \nand inefficient irrigation systems, (ii) land scarcity and declining soil fertility, (iii) inadequate access to finance, and (iv) limited \naccess to technical knowledge.  \n \n2.    Design Features \nThe Project will reduce rural poverty, increase farm incomes, support sustainable environmental management, and reduce out-\nmigration. The Project will target poor households to reduce their vulnerability to environmental degradation and improve their \naccess to employment, financing, and market opportunities. The poor will get support to make the transition to high-value farm \nproduction systems through introduction of modern technologies, capacity-building, more efficient use of irrigation water, reduced \nuse of agrochemicals, and access to long-term credit.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nPoor households account for 15.7% of the population in the project counties. Farmers\u2019 perspectives, noted from wealth ranking \ndone during the feasibility study survey, show that poor and extremely poor often account for 60%\u201380% of the population in the \nmountain and hilly areas. During the survey, households expressed a strong desire to participate in the Project, and willingness to \nborrow for investments in production systems and repay on time. They also wish to participate in training to learn modern \nagricultural techniques to sustainably manage soil and water resources.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nDuring the social and poverty assessment undertaken in April 2007, eight county stakeholder meetings were held. For the feasibility \nstudy, municipal and county agencies conducted an in-depth survey; with more than 13,000 farm households participating. \n \n1.

Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. \nThe project preparation surveys identified the following gender issues: \n\uf0b7  Women\u2019s participation in farm labor was only 44%, and  much less in the mountain and poverty counties.  \n\uf0b7  Borrowing from a rural credit cooperative generally requires the signature of a husband on the agreement. Therefore, \nhouseholds headed by women do not have access to credit.  \n\uf0b7  Training to women is not provided to suit calendar of household activities, and not adapted to their lower education.  \n\uf0b7  Women's employment is in general limited to agriculture, while out-migration and nonfarm jobs are mainly for men. \n\uf0b7  All China Women Federation (ACWF) branches are located in every village, but have limited operating capacity. \n \n2.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n \nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development activities and/or \nsocial impacts during project implementation?      Yes           No \n      \n \n ", "62         Appendix 17   \nGENDER ACTION PLAN \n \nOver the last 20 years, the People's Republic of China has achieved a significant reduction in \noverall poverty. Women, however, have not benefited equally due to social barriers. In the \nproject areas, women have less employment both in on-farm and off-farm activities. They also \nhave lower education and less access to technical training and services, which might prevent \nthem from participating in, and benefiting from, the Project. Generally, women have lower status \nin decision-making both at home and in the community, which might also prevent them from \nparticipating  in  the  consultation  and  participation,  leaving  their  needs  and  concerns  not \nadequately addressed during project implementation. Due to inadequate resources, the All \nChina Women Federation has not functioned well in each village to mobilize women and protect \ntheir interests. Finally, in many project counties, more than half of all farm households in a \nvillage are headed by women as men migrate to seek off-farm employment. The gender action \nplan is developed to protect women\u2019s rights, interests, and participation while maximizing their \ncontribution  to  the  Project.  The  project  management  office  will  ensure  that  all  project \nimplementation units effectively implement and monitor gender-related activities and actions. It \nwill engage a gender specialist to provide relevant training to all staff of implementing agencies. \nA more detailed gender action plan will be provided in project administration manual. \n \nTable A17: Gender Equality Activities and Targets \nComponent  Activities and Targets \n1. Provision of project loans, technical advice, training, and employment \nOverall  Training will be provided to the PMO and PIUs, financial and technical service agencies, leaders \npromotion of  of township governments and village committees to increase gender awareness. Women will be \ngender  informed  about  opportunities  to  access  project  loan  funds,  technical  advice  and  training, \nawareness  information, and employment opportunities. \n   \nEmployment  Women will have equal access to project subloans, and will be able to sign subloan agreements \nand loan  without a male cosignatory. Employment opportunities will be made equally accessible to both \nopportunities  women and men, but women will receive at least a 40% share of total employment. This is one \n  of  the  conditions  for  the  agro-enterprises  to  receive  a  project  loan.  The  Gender  and \n  Development Cooperation Fund will set up revolving funds to provide microfinance to women \n  groups in four villages of two poverty counties. \n   \nTechnical  The training programs will have gender-sensitive curriculum, and women will have equal access \nadvice and  to all training programs. Qualified women will be encouraged to become farmer trainers and \ntraining  participate in demonstration activities. At least 40% of the training opportunities will be provided \nto women.  \n2. Institutional development for women\u2019s participation \nIncreased  Women will elect their own representatives for village councils to ensure C&P with women \nrepresentation  during project implementation. The PMO will monitor women\u2019s participation in C&P. Women will \nof women  represent and participate in all project-relevant decision-making processes. \n   \nIncreased role  ACWF will be part of the project leading group. ACWF chapters in participating villages and \nof ACWF in  counties will receive training in mobilization, facilitation, and monitoring. ACWF will monitor \nvillages  representation, C&P, and accrual of project benefits to women, especially to poor households \nand those headed by women. \n3. Project Management and Implementation Support \nSex- (i) Gender-sensitive indicators will be included in the project M&E system, especially in areas \ndisaggregated  such as access to technical advice and  training, employment and income, and women\u2019s \nbaseline  representation in decision making. \nsurvey, and  (ii) The PMO will periodically monitor the indicators, and ACWF and women\u2019s representatives in \nM&E   the villages will undertake participatory M&E annually. \nACWF = All China Women's Federation, C&P = consultation and participation, M&E = monitoring and evaluation, PIU \n= project implementation unit, PMO = project management office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20091125140017+08'00'", "Author": "rs3", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 9.0.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091222124722+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RRP Shanxi _for printing_ 25 Nov 09.doc"}, "author_page": "   \n \nVice President  C.
