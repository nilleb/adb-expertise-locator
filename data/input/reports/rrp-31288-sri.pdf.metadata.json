It  will  support  the  implementation  of\npolicy and institutional reforms that the Government has recently\napproved,  which  include  setting  up  a  new  apex  body,  the\nNational  Water  Resource  Authority  (NWRA).  The  Project  will\nbuild capacity in the NWRA to fulfil its mandate of managing the\ncountry\u2019s  water  resources  and  establishing  working  linkages\nwith key partner agencies1 in the water sector. Capacity will be\ndeveloped \nto  resolve  existing\nconflicts  in  three  river  basins.  Infrastructure  to  improve  water\nresource  management  will  also  be  constructed  under  the\nProject.\n\nthrough  practical  exercises \n\nCategory  B\nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken, and\nthe summary IEE is an appendix.\n\nRapid  industrial  growth,  urbanization,  and  increasing  water\ndemands  in  the  agriculture  sector  in  recent  years  have  caused\nincreasing  stress  on  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  water  resources  and  highlight\nthe importance of more efficient and holistic management of the\nresource. Inefficiencies have been exacerbated by the fact that\na  number  of  agencies  exploit  the  water  resource  but  operate\nmore or less independently of each other, with no single agency\nhaving  a  mandate \nthe\nGovernment  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  place  a\nhigh priority on establishing the NWRA and ensuring it functions\neffectively  with  existing  water  resources  agencies  so  as  to\nrectify the current inadequacies.\n\nfor  overall  management.  Both \n\ninvestments \n\nthe  water  supply \n\nDuring  project  preparation,  appropriate \nin\ninfrastructure  to  improve  water  resource  management  were\nidentified.  Construction  of  the  Kelani  Conservation  Barrage  will\nprotect \nis\nthreatened by increasing salinity intrusion into the mouth of the\nKelani  River  and  lowered  river  levels  at  the  pump  intakes.  To\naccurately quantify the available river flows at critical times, it is\nalso  proposed  that  low-flow  weirs  be  constructed  at  strategic\nlocations in the key rivers.\n\nto  Greater  Colombo,  which \n\nUndertaking \nfor\nsustainable and equitable management of its water resources in\n\nthese  activities  will  prepare \n\nthe  country \n\n                                                \n1\n\nThe  partner  agencies  are  existing  agencies  currently  involved  to  some  extent  in  water  resource  management.\nThey include the Irrigation Department, Ceylon Electricity Board, Water Resources Board, National Water Supply\nand Drainage Board, Central Environmental Authority, Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka, and provincial and district\nauthorities in the project area.\n\n\fObjective and Scope\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\niii\n\nthe  future.  It  will  meet  the  development  objectives  of  both  the\nGovernment and ADB by furthering the potential for rational and\nsustainable  economic  development  and  improving  the  well-\nbeing  of  a  significant  number  of  the  poorer  citizens  of  the\ncountry.\n\nThe  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  strengthen  the  Government's\ncapacity  to  manage  its  water  resources  in  a  sustainable,\nparticipatory, and transparent way.  It will be implemented in two\nparts:  (i)  capacity  building  to  assist  in  establishing  NWRA  and\nstrengthening existing agencies in the water sector (part A), and\n(ii) construction of urgently needed infrastructure for control and\nmeasurement of water resources (part B).\n\nresource  management \n\nPart  A  will  have  three  components:  (i)  establishment  of  NWRA\nand  its  operational  links  to  other  water  agencies,  including\nprovision  of  office  facilities,  transport,  specialized  technical\ntechnical  assistance;  (ii) database\nequipment,  and  related \nimprovement for water resource data collection and information\nmanagement by modernizing and expanding the monitoring and\ndata  management  and  sharing  facilities;  and  (iii) strengthening\nthe\nof  water \nimplementation  of  plans  in  three  pilot  river  basins.  Part  A  will\nbuild  capacity  by  providing  practical  exercises  in  the  resolution\nof  real  water  use  problems  and  covering  the  activities  that\nfull-fledged\nNWRA  will  be  expected \noperational  agency.

Equipment\npackages  costing  $100,000  -  $500,000  may  be  purchased  by\ninternational  shopping,  except \nin  cases  when  specialized\nproprietary equipment is required and off-the-shelf purchase will\nbe permitted with prior approval from ADB. Equipment packages\ncosting  less  than  $100,000  may  be  procured  through  off-the-\nshelf purchase.\n\nThe  procurement  method  for  the  training  and  demonstration\nprogram will vary, depending on the type of training. For short-\ncourse  and  academic  degree \ntraining,  reimbursement  of\nexpenses  will  apply.  For  twinning  arrangements,  a  list  of\nprequalified  twinning  organizations  will  be  prepared  by  the\ntraining  consultants  at  the  inception  of  the  Project,  and  the\nappropriate  one  will  be  selected  according  to  the  training\nproposal.  All  training  will  be  carried  out  in  ADB  member\ncountries.\n\nThe  Kelani  Conservation  Barrage  will  be  constructed  under  a\nsingle  civil  works  contract  to  be  procured  through  international\ncompetitive  bidding.

It  is\nproposed  that  the  civil  works  for  the  weirs  will  be  procured\nthrough  local  competitive  bidding,  using  procedures  acceptable\nto ADB.\n\nis  expected \n\nThe  Project \nto  use  111  person-months  of\ninternational  and  240  person-months  of  domestic  consulting\nservices.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of\ndomestic consultants.\n\nDecember 2005\n\nThe  long-term  social  impact  of  improved  water  resource\nmanagement will be significant, since most conflicts in water use\nare  ultimately  social  issues.  Planning  water  use  entails,  to  a\nlarge extent, the resolution of conflicting or competing uses of a\nlimited  resource  among  various  social  groups.  Having  a\nmechanism  to  do  this  through  NWRA,  river  basin  planning\ncommittees,  and  the  Water  Resources  Tribunal  ensures  that\neach  social  group  will  be  able,  through  a  consultative  process,\nto  obtain  maximum  access  to  water  in  a  way  that  is  consistent\nwith  the  overall  social  good.  Both  agency  staff  and  concerned\ncommunity  groups  working  in  the  pilot  river  basins  will  benefit\nthrough  the  proposed  training  program.  It  is  expected  that  at\nleast about a quarter of the participants will be women.\n\nresources  apex  body  will  provide \n\nFrom  a  poverty  point  of  view,  the  existence  of  a  functioning\nfor\nwater \nparticipatory  and  transparent  consultations  in  water  allocation.\nThe  poorer  segments  of  society  will  especially  benefit  from  the\nopportunity  to  enunciate  their  water  resource  needs  and  the\nassurance that, to some extent, they will be met. In real terms,\nthis  means  that  both  the  rural  and  the  urban  poor  will  have  a\nvoice in determining their access to a resource that is essential\nto their physical and economic well-being and advancement.\n\nforum \n\nthe \n\nFor  part  B,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  Kelani\nConservation  Barrage  has  been  estimated  at  about  22.1\npercent.

Preliminary work in cooperation with other aid agencies began with\nadvisory  technical  assistance  (TA)1  under  which  an  Action  Plan  for  Comprehensive  Water\nResources Management was prepared. The formulation of the action plan was followed up in 1995\nwith  another  advisory  TA,2  which  provided  assistance  in  the  preparation  of  a  National  Water\nResources  Policy,  and  in  1998  with  project  preparatory  TA3 designed  to  operationalize  the  policy\nand initiate integrated water resource management investment. All three TAs have been successful\nand as a result, the National Water Resources Act is being prepared for submission to Parliament\nfor  approval,  the  Government  is  taking  steps  to  establish  an  apex  water  resources  management\nbody, and a high-priority water conservation investment project has been identified.\n\n3.\nFollowing up on these activities and in support of the enhanced management of the country's\nwater  resources,  the  Government  has  requested  further  assistance  to  help  set  up  the  apex  water\nmanagement body recommended in the policy, and also to initiate investment in high-priority water\nmanagement infrastructure. In response to this request, ADB Fact-Finding and Appraisal Missions4\n(fielded  in  January  and  April  2000,  respectively)  assessed  the  nature  of  the  support  that  could  be\nprovided. The institutional needs that a newly organized water resources apex body would face were\nreviewed and the scope, urgency, and viability of a proposed investment project were assessed. A\nloan  project  proposal  was  formulated  in  cooperation  with  the  Government.  It  was  extensively\ndiscussed with stakeholders in the water resources sector as well as with potential beneficiaries and\nrepresentatives of other aid organizations. This report is based on the results of the three preceding\nTAs, field visits to typical areas of water resource stress, discussions with all concerned parties, and\nrefinements  made  during  Mission  wrap-up  discussions  with  Government  representatives.  The\nproject framework is presented in Appendix 1.\n\nA.\n\nThe Water Resources Management Sector\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n4.\nSri Lanka is an island nation with limited water resources and an ever-increasing demand on\nthem.  From 1971 to 1998, the country's population increased from 12.6 million to 18.8 million, with\nno  concomitant  increase  in  the  water  resource.  Indeed,  gross  water  availability  declined  over  the\nsame  period  due  to  pollution,  watershed  degradation,  increasing  seasonal  variability,  seawater\nintrusion into rivers, and the unsustainable extraction of groundwater.\n\n5.\nDuring the same period, urban areas as well as industrial growth expanded dramatically and\ntourism  became  an  important  earner  of  foreign  exchange  so  that  the  locational  and  geographic\ndemand for water changed as significantly as the overall quantum demand.  In other words, water\n                                                \n1\n\nTA 1918-SRI: Institutional Assessment for Comprehensive Water Resources Management, for $188,000, approved on\n30 July 1993.\nTA  2422-SRI:  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Comprehensive  Water  Resources  Management,  for  $1.57  million,\napproved on 12 October 1995.\nTA 3030-SRI: Western River Basins Sector Project,  for $1.5 million, approved on 11 June 1998.\nThe  Mission  comprised  P.  Logan,  Mission  Leader;  S.  Sahni,  Financial  Specialist;  S.B  Koh,  Programs  Officer;\nI. Simbolon, Social Development Specialist; R. Dobias, Sr. Environment Specialist; and R. O\u2019Sullivan, Counsel.\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nwas needed at places and in quantities deviating from past historical trends, when water was mainly\nfor irrigation and rural domestic use.\n\n6.\nMost sectors of the Sri Lankan economy are heavily dependent on water. Among them are\nagriculture, industry, power, fisheries, the commercial sector and tourism. None of them can perform\nto optimum efficiency in an environment of uncertain and restricted water use. Indeed, in the past 30\nyears  almost  all  sectors  of  the  economy  in  Sri  Lanka  rapidly  expanded.  Without  water  resources,\nthat expansion would not have been possible.  Expansion in agriculture has been achieved through\nmajor increases in the use of water for irrigation.  Increased use of hydropower has been the basis\nof growth in manufacturing and the service sectors. A major increase in the use of river water and\ngroundwater  has  allowed  an  expansion  of  urban  areas  and  growth  in  manufacturing  and  tourism.\nThe country's rivers have supplied the sand required in large quantities as a construction material for\nthe country's recent building boom.\n\n7.\nAlthough Sri Lanka's total water supplies are abundant compared with those in some more\narid  countries,5  water  stress  is  now  being  experienced,  and  regional  and  seasonal  variations  in\nsupply and demand already create problems. One reason is that the country has a very high  year-\nto-year  rainfall  variability  as  well  as  high  locational  and  seasonal  variation.  Another  is  the  fact  that\nthe quantum growth in water use over the past 30 years has been far greater than that envisaged\nduring the planning of each individual water development project or scheme.\n\n8.\nThe country's vulnerability was seen in 1996 when drought conditions caused a substantial\nshortfall  in  paddy  production;  disrupted  hydropower  production,  leading  to  island-wide  power  cuts;\nand forced several urban water supply systems to shut down. Stress on the country's water supplies\nis also seen in the increasing salinity intrusion into rivers emptying into the sea; the number of urban\nwater supply systems suffering from chronic, and occasionally acute, water shortages; and delays in\nnew domestic water supply investments because of uncertain water availability.\n\nA  major  reason  for  the  worsening  water  supply  situation  despite  the  rather  plentiful  overall\n9.\nsupplies is the fact that, traditionally, water was considered an abundant resource readily available\nfor  all,  and  was  always  exploited  as  such.  Irrigation  accounts  for  some  80  percent  of  water\nconsumption and has always been provided free of any significant charge. The overuse of irrigation\nwater  is  common  and  paddy  is  sometimes  grown  on  unsuitable,  sandy  soils,  while  downstream\nusers  may  not  have  sufficient  water  for  their  own  irrigation  or  domestic  use  requirements.\nHydropower reservoirs now provide a major part of the country's electricity needs, yet the timing of\nhydropower  releases  does  not  necessarily  coincide  with  the  peak  requirements  for  agriculture  or\ndomestic  use.  Groundwater  has  been  considered  a  resource  available  for  anyone  who  has  the\nwherewithal  to  pump  it.  As  a  result,  urban  water  supply  schemes  and  new  industries  extract\ngroundwater  without  any  control  or  consideration  of  the  recharge  capacity.    Moreover,  any  water\nbody is liable to be used as a convenient conveyance for factory or domestic sewage discharge, so\nthere is little restraint on the release of effluents into drainage ditches and water bodies. Even the\nsand in riverbeds is considered free for all and has been extensively mined in recent years to supply\nthe construction needs of a building boom.  This use has altered river morphology to such an extent\nthat  high  and  low  flow  patterns  completely  differ  from  historical  patterns,  and  saline  water\nincreasingly  intrudes  into  river  mouths.  Consequently,  domestic  water  supply  facilities  are\nendangered, while reduced flows and pollution are endangering sensitive wildlife habitats.\n\n                                                \n5 Mean  annual  rainfall  in  the  southwestern  quarter  of  the  country,  known  as  the  wet  zone,  is  2,300  millimeters  (mm)\nwhile in the more extensive dry zone to the east, north, and southeast it is 1,300 mm.  However, many rivers rise in\nthe wet zone and flow through the dry zone, providing a source of irrigation and domestic water. The overall variation\nis between 5,500 mm per annum in the wettest areas to 900 mm per annum in the driest.  A mean annual rainfall of\naround 1,700 mm is necessary to grow a wet season paddy crop without irrigation.\n\n\f (i)\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v)\n\n(i)\n\n3\n\n10.\nThe  inefficient  use  of  water  resources  has  been  exacerbated  by  the  fact  that  the  resource\nhas been exploited by a variety of agencies, each pursuing its own mandate, with no single agency\nhaving  stewardship  over  the  country's  water  resources  per  se.  The  ADB-financed  TA  Institutional\nStrengthening for Comprehensive Water Resources Development (footnote 2) identified 28 agencies\nin  10  ministries  responsible  for  one  or  more  aspects  of  water  resources  management.    The  major\nones are:\n\nthe  Irrigation  Department  (ID),  the  Water  Resources  Board  (WRB),  and  the  Ceylon\nElectricity  Board  (CEB)  of  the  Ministry  of  Irrigation  and  Power,  responsible  for\nirrigation  development,  flood  control,  groundwater  development,  and  hydropower\ndevelopment (outside of the Mahaweli area);\n\nthe Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) in the Ministry of Mahaweli Development\nwhich  is  responsible  for  the  overall  development  of  the  Mahaweli  River,  the  longest\nriver in the country, and its surrounding basin areas;6\n\nthe  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB)  and  the  Sri  Lanka  Land\nand  Reclamation  Corporation  in  the  Ministry  of  Urban  Development,  Housing  and\nConstruction,  which  is  responsible  for  major  urban  water  supply  projects  and  flood\ncontrol and drainage projects, respectively;\n\nthe  Central  Environmental  Authority  (CEA) \nEnvironment, responsible for water quality; and\n\nin \n\nthe  Ministry  of  Forestry  and\n\nthe  provincial  councils  and  local  authorities,  which  are  also  responsible  for  water\nresources management issues at a local level.\n\n11.\nThis  multiplicity  of  agencies  operating  in  the  water  management  sector  more  or  less\nindependently  of  each  other  has  resulted  in  the  following  distortions  and  inefficiencies  in  water\nmanagement.\n\nlarge  water  users, \n\nSome \nto\nthemselves  and  thus  play  the  role  of  both  regulator  and  user  of  the  resource.\nAlthough  they  may  take  other  users  into  account,  they  have  no  legal  obligation  to\nallocate water in an impartial manner.\n\nincluding  government  agencies,  allocate  water \n\n(ii)  Water required for environmental and social needs may not be protected since these\nuses  are  not  recognized  in  policy  and  no  mechanisms  exist  to  legally  safeguard\nminimum in-stream flows or reservoir levels for these requirements.\n\n(iii) \n\nThe supply of water for existing users is vulnerable where new water use continues to\nbe  allowed.  This  lack  of  control  on  water  demand  increases  the  risk  of  water\nshortages and reduces the value of downstream water-related investment.\n\n(iv)   Water  allocation  is  not  flexible  and  therefore  new  users  cannot  be  supplied  by\nvoluntary transfer of water from existing users.  This lack of flexibility also means that\nexisting  users  do  not  have  the  incentive  to  make  more  efficient  use  of  their  water\nsupply and to recognize the value of water.\n\n                                                \n6\n\nThe Mahaweli River flows out of the Central Highlands in the wet zone in the southwest of the country through much\nof  the  dry  zone.  It  has  been  the  source  of  most  of  the  irrigation  water  for  new  settlements  and  agricultural  and\nhydropower development sponsored by the Government. A large amount of funding for these developments has been\nprovided by the World Bank and bilateral aid agencies.\n\n\f4\n\n(v) \n\nThere  is  no  planning  system  that  would  allocate  water  to  priority  uses  either  in  the\nlong run or during critical drought periods that are likely to occur in the near term.\n\n12.\nTo  remedy  the  situation  and  to  begin  managing  Sri  Lanka's  water  as  a  scarce  resource\nrather than a freely available public commodity, there is an overriding need for an agency or body\nwith  the  authority  to  manage  the  country's  water  resources  on  a  global  or  holistic  basis.  The\nestablishment of such an apex agency and the passage of legislation to provide it with meaningful\npowers are the major recommendations of the TA for Institutional Strengthening for Comprehensive\nWater  Management  (footnote  2).  This  is  spelled  out  in  a  document  entitled  National  Water\nResources  Policy  and  Institutional  Arrangements  (summary  in  Appendix  2)  which  was  prepared\nunder the TA. The TA findings and the policy have been endorsed by ADB and also by all concerned\nagencies in the water management sector in the country. Legislation establishing the National Water\nResources Authority (NWRA), and giving it the mandate to manage the country's water resources is\nbeing processed. It is expected to be introduced in Parliament in early 2001 and to become effective\nnot later than December 2001 (Appendix 3, Table A3.1).\n\n13.\nThe  consequences  of  poor  water  management  are  felt  most  severely  by  the  poorer\nsegments  of  the  country's  population.  As  the  competition  for  water  increases,  reduced  availability\ncombined  with  deteriorating  quality  is  posing  serious  problems  to  public  health  and  further\ndevelopment  activities.  The  poor  have  the  least  ready  access  to  safe,  potable  water  for  domestic\nuse. They can least afford medical care after becoming ill from contaminated water, suffer most from\nreduced  incomes  due  to  deficient  irrigation  water  supplies,  and  suffer  most  from  lost  employment\nopportunities when industries cannot be established due to inadequate water supplies or unresolved\nwater use conflicts.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\nAs noted in paras. 10 and 11, current Government policies have traditionally focused on the\n14.\nmanagement of water resources on an agency-by-agency basis and have been generally designed\nto  maximize  the  operational  benefits  of  a  particular  agency  within  its  particular  mandate.  For\nexample, the ID focuses on maximizing water use for irrigation, while NWSDB focuses on providing\nthe  maximum  domestic  water  supply  possible  to  the  largest  possible  number  of  users.  In  some\ncases,  the  different  emphasis  may  entail  policies  aimed  at  water  conservation  or  efficient  use,  but\ngenerally the aim is to make available greater supplies within the same sector. Thus, programs for\nmore efficient use of irrigation water are generally focused on making more water available for other\nirrigators, and programs aimed at reducing leakage and increasing cost recovery in domestic water\nsupply schemes are primarily focused on conserving water so as to expand coverage.\n\n15.\nIn  other  cases,  policies  being  pursued  by  Government  agencies  are  even  potentially  (or\nactively) inimical to the conservation and rational use of water resources.  Agriculture development\nprograms  and  preferential  credit  schemes  that  promote  the  use  of  tubewells  or  low-lift  pumps  for\nirrigation are being undertaken without regard for the availability or sustainability of groundwater or\nriver  water  resources.  Industrial  estate  developments  are  being  pursued  without  adequate\nconsideration  of  the  need  for  freshwater  nor  the  need  to  dispose  of  effluents.  Some  government\ncontracts require the use of clean, sorted river sand for construction projects. The result is excessive\nsand mining in the country\u2019s rivers.\n\nIntegrated water resource management is, however, not completely unknown or unpracticed\n16.\nin  the  country.  MASL,  having  full  powers  over  the  water  resources  within  its  mandated  area,  does\nbalance  the  demand  and  supply  between  such  conflicting  uses  as  power  generation  and  irrigation\nwater  supply,  and  actively  encourages  water  conservation  measures  among  the  farmers  in  its\n\n\f5\n\nirrigation  areas.  However,  its  management  does  not  extend  to  domestic  and  industrial  water\nrequirements, inland fisheries, groundwater, or the environmental aspects of water use.\n\n17.\nInteragency cooperation in water resources management is also not unknown. The CEB and\nNWSDB,  for  example,  do  consult  on  hydropower  reservoir  releases  to  prevent  crises  in  domestic\nwater  supply  schemes,  and  local  level  officials  do  have  the  authority  to  bring  agencies  together  to\nwork  out  water  use  conflicts.  However,  any  interagency  agreement  is  nonbinding  and  depends  on\nthe goodwill of one agency toward another.\n\nIn the case of sand mining, the Government has acknowledged its major adverse effect on\n18.\nthe  country\u2019s  rivers  and  recently  initiated  action  to  address  it.  A  task  force  appointed  by  the\nPresident\u2019s  secretariat  is  in  the  process  of  finalizing  recommendations  for  control;  however,  the\nrecommendations  are  essentially  administrative  in  nature.  A  study  to  review  sand  mining\nalternatives,  including  cost  recovery  options,  will  be  undertaken  as  part  of  the  Coastal  Resource\nManagement Project.7\n\nThe  approach  to  management  of  water  resources  will  change  with  the  enactment  of\n19.\nlegislation to establish NWRA (para. 12), together with an advisory Water Resources Council8 and a\nWater Resources Tribunal. NWRA, the council, and the Tribunal will together form the water sector\napex  body  responsible  for  coordinating,  planning,  regulating,  and  monitoring  national  water\nresources  and  resolving  disputes  in  the  sector.  They  will  be  parallel  bodies,  each  reporting  to  the\nhead of state. The Council will advise NWRA on coordination at the national level and on resolution\nof interprovincial and interagency water disputes. With respect to draft policies and river basin plans,\nthe Council will guide NWRA and endorse its recommendations before submission to the Cabinet for\napproval. However, in all other matters NWRA will be directly responsible to the head of state. The\nTribunal  will  be  an  independent  appeal  tribunal,  which  will  meet  on  an  as-needed  basis.  It  will  be\nresponsible  to  the  head  of  state  for  administrative  purposes,  but  will  have  statutory  independence\nand  be  free  of  political  interference.  In  their  areas  of  responsibility,  the  three  bodies  will  have  a\nhigher  level  of  authority  over  the  other  national  water  agencies,  which  will  be  subject  to  their\noversight and direction (Appendix 4, Figure A4.1), and will thus be in a position to ensure that water\nresources are rationally and fairly developed and exploited.\n\nThe role of NWRA as set out in the National Water Resources Policy will be to address the\n\n20.\nfollowing aspects:\n\n (i) \n\nthe formulation of national water resources policies;\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nlong-term  national  and  river  basin  planning  of  water  resource  use,  including  the\ncoordination of local input;\n\ncoordination  and  collection  of  water  resource  data  and  information  management,\nwater monitoring, and the commissioning of research;\n\n(iv) \n\nbulk water allocation through the issuance of water entitlements;\n\n(v) \n\nprovision of advice to the government regarding drought and flood management;\n\n                                                \n7 \n8 \n\nLoan 1716-SRI: Coastal Resource Management Project, for $40,000,000 approved on 7 December 1999.\nAn interim Water Resources Council was set up in 1995; it will become permanent under the legislation. The council is\na senior-level consultative body representing the public and private sectors. It has 16 members: 7 are secretaries and\n2  are  directors  general  of  ministries  involved  in  water  resources  management;  the  7  others  represent  the  private\nsector, farmers, nongovernment organizations, academia, and women\u2019s interest.\n\n\f6\n\n(vi) \n\nformulation  of  policy  for  the  use  of  the  nations  water  resources  and  monitoring  its\nimplementation; and\n\n(vii) \n\npublic information and awareness of  water resource management issues.\n\nIn addition to NWRA, the policy envisages the establishment at the local and provincial levels\n21.\nof  river  basin  or  groundwater  committees  to  monitor  the  use  of  water  resources,  identify  water\nmanagement issues, prepare development plans, recommend water allocations, and act as a forum\nfor the resolution of water conflicts.\n\n22.\nThese  plans  are  expected  to  be  implemented  gradually.  Their  success  depends  on\nacceptance by all parties of the value and use of NWRA and its proven efficacy in resolving water\nresource  conflicts  and  issues.  For  this  reason,  its  initial  operations  will  be  on  a  limited  scale  in  a\nlimited number of pilot basins, expanding eventually nationwide.\n\n23.\nIt is noteworthy that, even prior to the establishment of NWRA, provincial governments have\nalready  approached  the  Water  Resources  Secretariat  (WRS),9  requesting  assistance  in  resolving\ntheir water resource management problems.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n24.\nADB  has  taken  the  lead  among  funding  agencies  in  providing  external  assistance  to  Sri\nLanka  for  integrated  water  resources  management.    The  core  of  this  assistance  has  been  two\nadvisory  TAs    (Institutional  Assessment  for  Comprehensive  Water  Resources  Development and\nInstitutional  Strengthening  for  Comprehensive  Water  Resources  Management)  and  one  project\npreparatory TA (Western River Basins Sector Project). In addition, Sri Lanka is one of the countries\nparticipating  in  an  ongoing  regional  TA  for  the  development  of  effective  water  management\ninstitutions.10  ADB  assistance  has  been  supplemented  by  assistance  from  other  aid  agencies,\nnotably  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  which  provided  parallel\nfunding for TA on institutional assessment; Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), together with\nthe  Netherlands  Government,  which  provided  assistance  through  the  Interregional  Water  Law  and\nPolicy Advisory Program; and Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), which financed\nthe project Environmental and Socio-Cultural Dimensions of Water Resources Planning in Sri Lanka.\n\nFurther  assistance \n\nis  currently  provided,  with  Norwegian  Agency \n\n25.\nInternational\nCooperation (NORAD) parallel financing as part of the technical assistance package provided under\nthe ADB loan-financed Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. 11 This project consists of\nassistance in resolving existing water use conflicts in the Anuradhapura area and the preparation of\na strategy and action plan to improve water resources monitoring and data management.\n\nfor \n\nPlanned future assistance for water resources management (besides the proposed Project)\n26.\nconsists of the project Integrated Water Resource Management Planning and Implementation to be\nfinanced  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  and  a  follow-on  of  the\nFAO  project  Implementation  of  a  Water  Rights  System.  The  AusAID  project  will  cover  the\npreparation  of  a  national  water  resources  plan,  the  preparation  of  three  river  basin  plans,  and  a\ntwinning arrangement to assist NWRA in its initial operations.  The FAO project, on the other hand,\nwill  constitute  a  second  phase  of  the  Water  Law  and  Policy  Advisory  Programme  and  will  support\n\n                                                \n9\n10  TA 5812-REG: Third Agriculture and Natural Resources Research at CGIAR Center, Development of Effective Water\n\nAn interim body set up to implement the water resources management TAs and is the precursor of NWRA.\n\nManagement Institutions, for $1,250,000, approved on 22 October 1998.\n\n11  Loan 1575-SRI: Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, for $75,000,000, approved on 6 November 1997.\n\n\f7\n\nthe  implementation  of  the  water  rights  and  allocation  component  of  the  National  Water  Resources\nPolicy. External assistance to the water sector is summarized in Appendix 5.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\nADB  has  had  extensive  experience  in  the  water  resources  sector  in  Sri  Lanka  with  the\n27.\nimplementation of water resources infrastructure projects. These range from irrigation development\nand  irrigation  improvement,  to  aquaculture  development  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects.\nProject  Completion  Reports  (PCRs)12  have  been  completed  for  five  of  these  projects  and  Project\nPerformance  Audit  Reports  (PPARs)13  for  three  of  them.  The  relevant  conclusions  from  these\nreports follow:\n\n(i)  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthere  is  a  need  for  an  integrated  approach  to  water  resource  assessment  before\ncommencing water resources infrastructure projects;\n\nprojects  should  not  be  too  ambitious  and  should  take  into  account  local-level\ninstitutional and technical capacity limitations;\n\nprojects  can  generally  be  completed  to  adequate  standards,  but  delays  due  to\ngovernment  procedures,  contracting  disputes,  unexpected  political  events,  and  at\ntimes,  ADB's  own  procedures  often  result  in  later  than  expected  completion  and\nbenefit generation;\n\n(iv) \n\nit is possible to encourage more efficient water use practices at the field level;\n\n(v) \n\nthe  establishment  of  sustainable  participatory  approaches  to  water  management  is\ntime-consuming  and  not  well-suited  to  short-term  TA  inputs.  Moreover,  adequate\ninstitutional capacity in this aspect is essential at all levels;14 and\n\n(vi)   NWSDB  has  developed  into  a  technically  competent  agency  whose  capacity  has\nbeen proved through implementation of various water supply and sanitation projects\nto the point where it can implement projects on time and within the budget.\n\n28.\nThe  proposed  Project  will  be  the  first  in  the  water  resources  management  sector.  The\nlessons learned that are directly related to this aspect are derived from the results of the three TAs\nalready  provided  in  that  sector  (para.  2).  The  lessons  are  in  fact  significant  and  to  a  large  extent\npositive, and the Project has been designed to take them into consideration.\n\n29.\nThe  first  and  most  important  lesson  is  that,  despite  a  wide  range  of  vested  interests  and\nconflicting  mandates,  through  a  process  of  consultation  and  participation  it  is  possible  to  reach\nconsensus among the stakeholders for improved governance in the water sector. At the outset of the\nTA  support,  many  key  agencies  were  uninterested  in,  or  even  hostile  to,  the  concept  of\ncomprehensive  water  resources  management,  with  concerns  that  their  mandate  or  very  existence\nwas threatened. Some were reluctant to accept that another agency will have ultimate control of the\ncountry's water. Ultimately, it was possible to convince each agency that reforms were essential for\n\n                                                \n12 PCR:  SRI  IN  170-79:  Walawe Development Project,  December  1979;  PCR:  SRI  19025:  Kirindi Oya Irrigation and\nSettlement Project,  September  1995;  PCR:  SRI  16025: Aquaculture Development Project,  January  1993;  PCR:  SRI\n16051:  Walawe Irrigation Improvement Project,  June  1996;  and  PCR:  SRI  18057:  Water Supply Sector Project,\nSeptember 1997.\n\n13 PPA:  SRI  0070:  Walawe Development Project,  August  1982;  PPA:  SRI  16051:  Walawe Irrigation Improvement\n\nProject, December 1999; and PPA: SRI 16025: Aquaculture Development Project, August 1995.\n\n14  Note that the concept of NWRA has been developed through an extensive process of participation and consultation by\n\nthe Water Resources Council and Water Resources Secretariat with assistance of the ADB TAs (para. 2).\n\n\f8\n\nlong-term security of water allocations and were in the best interests of that agency and the country.\nParticularly significant is that the existing agencies agreed to the establishment of an apex body that\nwould have authority over all of them.\n\n30.\nThe second lesson learned is that, in view of the diverse range of sector interests and social\ngroups  involved,  the  problems  facing  the  water  resources  sector  are  highly  complex.  Not  only  is\nthere competition for water between sectors, but there are also conflicts within sectors, and for some\nimportant  uses  such  as  environmental  sustainability  there  is  no  advocate  or  agency  mandated  to\nlobby, monitor, or protect water availability or quality. There are already clear signs that stakeholders\nare  seeking  guidance  and  assistance  in  resolving  conflicts  between  water  users  in  river  basins.\nRelated to this, it is notable that provincial administrations have already contacted WRS directly for\nassistance in resolving water management problems, thus preempting the role of NWRA (para. 23).\nThis highlights the urgent need for comprehensive water resources management and the need for a\nneutral entity to arbitrate among existing agencies and other stakeholders.\n\n31.\nA third significant lesson is that, to improve water resources management, there is a need to\nchange attitudes at the grassroots level to encourage efficient and optimal use of water. The concept\nof efficient water use is gradually being adopted at the field level in several parts of the country. In\nsome areas, farmers have been convinced to switch from growing paddy to raising other crops with\nlower water demand on unsuitable soils. Other programs are aimed at farmers' groups taking over\nthe  management  and  operation  of  the  distributory  canal  networks,  including  the  allocation  and\nmanagement  of  water.  Experiments  are  also  being  conducted  where  farmers  form  agriculture\ncompanies  to  manage  their  land  and  water  resources  in  return  for  guaranteed  access  to  land  and\nwater rights.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\nADB's draft water policy15 aims to foster an integrated approach to water service delivery and\n32.\nwater  resources  management  in  ADB\u2019s  operations  and  in  the  operations  of  its  member  countries.\nAmong the elements of this policy are:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii) \n\nthe promotion of effective national water policies and action programs;\n\nimproved management of water resources based on comprehensive water resource\nassessments;\n\n(iii) \n\nfostering the efficient and sustainable use and conservation of water;\n\n(iv) \n\ninvestment in water resource management in priority river basins; and\n\n(v) \n\nimproved  governance  in  the  water  sector  through  investments  in  capacity  building,\nmonitoring, evaluation, and research.\n\nThe  1998  Sri  Lanka  Country  Operational  Strategy  translates  these  goals  into  the  following\n\n33.\nspecific elements of the country program:16\n\n\"Support  for  comprehensive  water  resource  management  will  consolidate  recent\ninstitutional  changes  in  the  sector,  strengthen  the  capability  of  the  recently\n\n                                                \n15    Asian Development Bank. 2000.

An  integrated\napproach  to  water  resources  management  will  be  the  guiding  principle  for  Bank\noperations in this sector during the strategy period, and any assistance to the water\nsector  will  be  provided  in  this  framework.  Bank  assistance  will  aim  at  translating\nnational  policy  and  institutional  arrangements  into  practice  through  river  basin  level\nplanning  and  implementation,  the  resolution  of  conflicts  in  water  use,  and/or\ninnovative management arrangements.\"\n\n34.\nIn  relation  to  ADB\u2019s  overarching  goal  of  poverty  reduction,  comprehensive  water  resources\nmanagement will have a particularly positive impact. As noted in para. 6, almost every sector in the\nSri  Lanka  economy  is  dependent  on  access  to  water.  Assured  access  to  water,  which  can  come\nabout  only  through  comprehensive  water  resources  management,  is  required  to  strengthen  the\nenabling  environment  for  several  of  the  country's  productive  sectors,  including  agriculture,\nmanufacturing,  commercial  services,  and \nin\ntourism, \nemployment and household incomes and a reduction in poverty levels. On a more direct basis, often\nthe poorer sectors of society are the first to suffer from restricted access to water resources, both as\ndomestic  supply  and  use  for  productive  purposes  such  as  agriculture  or  fisheries.  Ensuring  that\naccess to basic water needs for the whole of the country's population is maintained will thus have its\nstrongest impact on the poorer sectors of society.\n\nthus  bringing  concomitant \n\nincreases \n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nADB's  involvement  in  integrated  water  resource  management  in  Sri  Lanka  represents  a\n35.\nsignificant achievement in policy dialogue and will lead to greatly improved governance in the water\nresources  sector.  A  number  of  issues  thus  have  been  or  need  to  be  addressed.  They  include\n(i) establishing a suitable institutional framework, (ii) developing an appropriate policy, (iii) preparing\nlegislation  based  on  the  policy,  and  (iv)  building  the  capacity  within  the  relevant  institutions  to\nimplement sustainable water resource management in accordance with the legislation.\n\n36.\nThe  major  vehicle  so  far  for  addressing  these  issues  has  been  the  three  TAs  provided  for\nintegrated  water  resources  management  since  1993  (para.  2).  At  the  beginning  of  the  first  TA\n(Institutional  Assessment  for  Comprehensive  Water  Resources  Management),  the  concept  of\nmanaging water resources on an integrated basis and as a scarce resource was new and not readily\nacceptable to many government agencies in the water sector.  Nonetheless, by the end of the TA in\n1995,  an  action  plan  for  comprehensive  water  resources  management,  designed  to  initiate  policy\nand  legal  reform  and  institutional  strengthening,  had  been  formulated  and  accepted  by  the\nGovernment. As a direct result, interim arrangements were put in place to strengthen the institutional\nframework.  Two  important  bodies  were  set  up:  the  Water  Resources  Council  and  the  associated\nWater Resources Secretariat. The Council is a senior-level consultative body representing both the\npublic and private sectors (para. 19). The WRS acts as the day-to-day secretariat to the Council and\nis staffed mainly through secondments from agencies active in water resources management such\nas  ID,  MASL,  NWSDB,  and  the  CEB.  It  also  acts  as  a  counterpart  agency  for  externally  assisted\nprojects focusing on water resources management.\n\n37.\nAfter its establishment, the WRS became the Executing Agency (EA) for ADB's second water\nresources  management  TA,  Institutional  Strengthening  for  Comprehensive  Water  Resources\nManagement. Under this TA, the Government made great progress in advancing policy, institutional\nand  legislative  reforms  in  the  water  sector.  The  broad  representation  of  the  Council  (para.  19)\nprovided an effective forum for a participatory and consultative approach, making it possible to reach\nconsensus on future reform measures. The culmination of this work was the publication of a National\n\n\f10\n\nWater  Resources  Policy  and  Institutional  Arrangements,  which  was  approved  by  the  Cabinet  in\nMarch  2000.  This  is  a  key  milestone  in  the  process  for  permanent  institutional  and  legislative\nreforms for the comprehensive management of the country's water resources. It clears the way for\nthe  establishment  of  a  permanent  apex  body,  comprising  NWRA,  working  in  conjunction  with  the\nCouncil and the Water Resources Tribunal (paras. 19 and 20).\n\n38. With the expected passage through Parliament of the National Water Resources Act, which\nembodies  the  National  Water  Resources  Policy  and  Institutional  Arrangements,  ADB  will  have\ncontributed  significantly  to  a  major  aspect  of  policy  and  institutional  reform  for  the  management  of\none  of  the  country's  key  natural  resources.  The  Project  will  provide  further  support  by  building  the\ncapacity  to  implement  the  reforms.  The  policy  principles  cover  the  key  aspects  for  sustainable\nmanagement,  including  pricing  of  water  and  sharing  of  costs  among  beneficiaries  in  an  equitable\nmanner.  The  priority  aspects \ninclude\n(i) establishment  of  water  rights  whereby  water  is  allocated  on  the  basis  of  agreed-upon  priorities\nand/or  in  accordance  with  principles  of  economic  efficiency;  (ii)  demand  management\u2014which  will\nallow water entitlements to be transferable\u2014and control of unauthorized water use; (iii) introduction\nof  the  management  of  groundwater  resources,  which  has  been  unregulated  in  the  past;  and\n(iv) improved  information  management  through  establishment  of  a  comprehensive  centralized\ndatabase  with  proper  arrangements  for  data  sharing  and  access.  Further  details  of  the  Policy  are\noutlined in Appendix 2.\n\nthe  policy  reforms \n\nintroduced  under \n\nthat  will  be \n\n39.\nThe  establishment  of  NWRA  cannot  be  formalized  until  after  passage  of  the  Act  in\nParliament. Although it is evident that the Government is committed to finalizing the process as soon\nas possible, it is also recognized that it is not realistic to fast-track the process, given the ongoing\nneed for consultations and consensus at all levels. The elections scheduled for late 2000 are also\nexpected  to cause delays.  Nevertheless, assurances under the Project commit the Government to\nthe  establishment  of  NWRA.  The  Cabinet  is  to  approve  the  draft  legislation  by  31  May  2001  and\nNWRA is to be established and functioning by 31 December 2001 (Appendix 3, Table A3.1). In the\nmeantime, it has also been agreed to build the WRS in advance of the passage of the Act according\nto a time-bound action plan (Appendix 3, Table A3.2) so that it will commence functioning more or\nless in the same way it would if it were formally NWRA. However, the WRS will not have the backing\nof legislation to formally implement basin plans and water allocation. In the first year or two, that will\nnot constrain operations since it will be the period of assessment, consultation, and plan preparation.\n\n40.\nEstablishment  of  NWRA  and  the  related  policy  principles  is  considered  a  prerequisite  for\ncontinuing policy dialogue on key issues related to water resource management and further building\non the achievements that have been made over the last seven years or so. It is intended that NWRA\nwill  actively  promote  public  consultation  and  participation  in  policy  issues  at  all  levels,  from  bulk\nwater  allocations  to  the  major  stakeholders  down  to  the  individual  beneficiaries.  Cost  recovery  for\nsustainable  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  aimed  at  more  efficient  use  of  water  will  be\naddressed. Through linkages to existing ADB water supply projects, it has been possible to obtain\nagreement with the Government on a policy paper for tariff revisions, which was approved in June\n2000.\n\nIn  the  longer  term,  it  is  envisaged  that  the  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  the  water\n41.\nresources  management  sector  will  lead  to  strategies  for  cost  recovery  of  O&M  in  the  irrigation\nsector. Despite the failure in 1984 of attempts to introduce fees for irrigation O&M, the Government\nrecognizes the need to work toward future reforms in that area. NWRA\u2019s role will include conducting\npublic information and education campaigns to develop a community-wide understanding of the real\ncosts of water. This will be linked to fostering farmer organizations and working toward handing over\nO&M responsibilities to  these organizations. The Project will support a Government pilot project in\nwhich farmers form agriculture companies to manage their land and water resources responsibly as\n\n\f11\n\na  cohesive  unit,  in  return  for  guaranteed  access  to  land  and  water  rights.17  Other  programs  are\naimed  at  farmers  groups  taking  over  the  management  and  operation  of  the  distributory  canal\nnetwork, including the allocation and management of water.\n\nA.     Rationale\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\n42. When Sri Lanka had a predominantly rural, agrobased economy with few industries and only\na limited urban population, integrated water resource management was not a pressing issue. Water\nwas  used  primarily  for  irrigation  or  domestic  rural  supply,  and  competing  demands  for  other  uses\nwere  easily  accommodated.  In  the  more  recent  past,  however,  this  picture  has  changed\ndramatically.  Rapid industrial growth has led to major additional demands, and the growth of urban\nareas throughout the country has raised the water requirements in areas and locations where they\nwere  traditionally  much  more  modest.  Moreover,  the  development  of  intensive  cropping  has  led  to\nincreased water demand in the agriculture sector.\n\n43.\nAs  a  result,  while  the  country  does  not  face  a  water  management  crisis,  there  are  signs  of\nincreasing stress on  the water resource and competition between users. The increasing degree of\ncompetition and stress are occurring while climatic variability, watershed degradation, and pollution\nare  threatening  the  water  resource  itself.  In  some  areas,  the  combination  of  low  water  availability\nand  poor  quality  of  the  supply  is  a  constraint  to  further  development  and  is  causing  public  health\nproblems. As pointed out in para. 13, the impact is most severe on the poor.\n\nOver  the  past  three  years,  the  Water  Resources  Council  and  the  WRS  have,  with  a\n44.\nsubstantial  amount  of  effort  and  a  high  degree  of  cooperation  from  other  water  sector  agencies,\nbeen  able  to  produce  the  National  Water  Resources  Policy  and  Institutional  Arrangements.    This\ndocument  sets  out  fundamental  water  resources  policies  and  an  institutional  structure  for  water\nresources  management  in  the  country.  Central  to  the  institutional  arrangements  (and  the\nimplementation  of  the  policies)  is  the  establishment  of  NWRA,  together  with  a  permanent  Water\nResources  Council  and  Water  Resources  Tribunal,  as  the  apex  body  (para.  19).  NWRA  will  guide\nthe implementation of the National Water Resources Act, coordinate the activities of agencies active\nin water planning and water use, and be the ultimate authority responsible for bulk allocations and\ndispute resolution in the water sector.\n\n45.\nBoth the Government and ADB place a high priority on establishing NWRA and its functional\nlinks with existing water resources agencies.  The Project thus aims to support the establishment of\nNWRA  and  to  help  develop  its  capacity,  and  that  of  its  partner  agencies,18  to  carry  out  effective\nwater resource management in the country.\n\nDuring  project  preparation,  it  was  possible  to  identify  one  clear  source  of  stress  on  the\n46.\ncountry\u2019s water resources, resulting from competing uses, and a solution to it was designed. Lower\nriver levels and increasing salinity intrusion into the mouth of the Kelani River threaten the whole of\nthe  water  supply  to  Greater  Colombo,  an  area  of  730  square  kilometers  with  a  population  of  1.6\nmillion. The construction of a control structure near the existing water supply intake will provide an\nenvironmentally sound, cost-effective, and technically feasible means of protecting Colombo\u2019s water\nsupply.\n\n                                                \n17 \n\n18\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  Project  provide  training  and  demonstrations  in  the  Ridi  Bendi  Ela  Irrigation  Scheme  in  the\nDeduru Oya Basin. It is a high-profile pilot scheme, which has attention at the highest level of Government.\nThe  partner  agencies  are  Irrigation  Department,  Ceylon  Electricity  Board,  Water  Resources  Board,  National  Water\nSupply and Drainage Board, Central Environmental Authority, the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka, and provincial and\ndistrict authorities in the project area.\n\n\f12\n\nUndertaking these activities will prepare the country for future, meaningful management of its\n47.\nwater  resources  and  also  address  one  of  the  immediate  and  urgent  consequences  of  the  lack  of\nadequate  integrated  water  resource  management  planning  in  the  past.  The  Project  will  meet  the\ndevelopment  objectives  of  both  the  Government  and  ADB  by  furthering  the  potential  for  rational,\nsustainable  economic  development  and  improving  the  well-being  of  a  significant  number  of  the\npoorer citizens of the country.\n\nB.  \n\nObjective and Scope\n\n48.\nThe objective of the Project is to strengthen the Government's capacity to manage its water\nresources  in  a  sustainable,  transparent,  and  participatory  way,  and  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  past\nuncoordinated  water  resource  use.  This  objective  will  contribute  to  the  overall  sector  goal  of  the\nProject to establish the sustainable management of water resources through the implementation of a\nnational water policy under adequate institutional arrangements. The Project will comprise two parts:\n(i)  capacity  building  designed  to  assist  in  the  establishment  of  NWRA  and  the  strengthening  of\nexisting  agencies  in  the  water  sector  (part  A),  and  (ii)  the  construction  of  urgently  needed  water\nresource control and measuring infrastructure, specifically, a control structure on the Kelani River to\nprotect  the  water  supply  to  the  Greater  Colombo  area  and  the  construction  of  low-flow  measuring\nweirs on the Kelani and other critical rivers (part B).\n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Development (Part A)\n\n49.\nPart  A  will  have  three  components:  (i)  establishment  of  NWRA  and  its  operational  links  to\nother water agencies, (ii) strengthening water resource data collection and information management\nand sharing, and (iii) capacity building in preparation of water resource management plans.\n\na.\n\nEstablishment of the National Water Resources Authority\n\n50.\nIt is envisaged that a fully staffed and operational NWRA will have 51 full-time staff, of whom\n34 will be at a professional level.  Bringing such an agency into being requires capital costs in the\nprovision of office space, office equipment, transport facilities, and specialized technical equipment.\nThat  will  be  provided  by  the  Project.  International  and  national  consulting  services  will  be  made\navailable  to  provide  guidance  in  policy  formulation,  river  basin  planning,  water  resource\nadministration;  and  also  advise  partner  agencies  (para.  45)  on  the  restructuring  required  to  fulfill\ntheir mandates as water resource managers in cooperation with NWRA. Domestic and international\nproject  coordinators  and  training  specialists  will  be  financed  under  this  component.  A  national\nfinance and administration specialist will be provided to build NWRA\u2019s capacity to administer loan-\nfinanced projects.\n\nb.\n\nDatabase Improvement\n\n51.\nData  on  the  water  resource  in  Sri  Lanka  is  patchy,  often  outdated,  and  unreliable  due  to\nrecent  environmental  changes  from  activities  such  as  sand  mining.  It  is  also  difficult  to  assemble\nsince  it  is  collected  and  held  by  a  number  of  separate  agencies.  Under  these  circumstances,  any\nmeaningful management and planning activities are difficult to carry out.\n\n52.\nData for surface water is the most readily available, but may be unreliable due to the age of\nthe monitoring system and the great number of environmental changes that have taken place in the\npast  few  decades.    Data  for  groundwater  is  sparse,  except  in  certain  well-defined  and  restricted\nareas, so that little is known about the overall groundwater resource of the country. Similarly, except\nin certain specific locations, data on water quality as a time series is almost nonexistent.\n\n\f13\n\n53. Without  a  comprehensive  knowledge  of  the  water  resource  that  they  will  be  mandated  to\nmanage, NWRA and its partner agencies will find it very difficult to assess the size and extent of the\nresource,  the  potential  for  future  development,  and  the  dangers  inherent  in  unregulated  use.  In\nparticular,  it  will  be  difficult  to  determine  the  amount  of  water  that  can  safely  be  allocated  to\ncompeting users.\n\n54.\nThrough  the  database  component,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the  collection,  storage,\nmanagement, and sharing of data and information for surface water, groundwater, and water quality.\nFor  surface  water  the  activities  will  consist  of  (i)  the  provision  and  establishment  of  modernized\ngauging  stations,  (ii)  the  provision  of  hydrometric  equipment,  and  (iii)  the  provision  of  data\nmanagement equipment as well as transport facilities for the data collection staff.19 For groundwater\nthe activities involve (i) the sinking of measurement wells, (ii) the provision of measuring instruments\nand data management equipment, and (iii) training in their installation and use. For water quality the\nactivities will consist of upgrading laboratories and equipment for water quality testing. A centralized\ndatabase will be established in WRS/NWRA, using modern software and information technology to\nfacilitate data sharing.\n\nc.\n\nStrengthening of Water Resource Management\n\nThis  component  will  consist  of  two  distinct,  but  interrelated  activities:  pilot  water  resource\n\n55.\nmanagement activities, and capacity building through training and demonstrations.\n\ni.\n\nPilot Water Resource Management\n\n56.\nTo develop the newly established NWRA into an effective agency with strong links with other\npartner  agencies,  the  Project  will  initially  support  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  water\nresource  management  plans  in  two  specific  river  basins.  The  work,  to  be  done  by  NWRA  staff  in\ncooperation with all concerned parties will entail practical exercises in the type of activity that NWRA\nwill  be  expected  to  undertake  as  a  full-fledged,  operational  agency.  The  activities  will  be  both  a\ntraining  exercise  and  a  practical  exercise  in  the  resolution  of  real  water  use  problems.  They  will\nconsist  of  resource  inventories  (including  fisheries  and  wildlife  aspects);  institutional  analysis;\nproblem and conflict identification; consultations among and between major involved agencies and\nusers; analysis of future use and demand projections, with special attention to long-term demand for\nan  urban  water  supply;  the  setting  up  of  an  institutional  framework  to  resolve  water  issues;  public\nawareness campaigns and public consultations. The work  will eventually result in conflict resolution\nand agreement between water users on the amount and timing of allocations, and other steps that\nmay be identified to resolve water management issues.\n\n57.\nThe river basins of the Menik Ganga and the Deduru Oya have been chosen as sites for the\nfirst two pilot studies. It is expected that plans setting out water allocation and sharing arrangements\nwill be agreed-upon within three years of commencing the Project (by December 2003), followed by\nimplementation. A third basin, Attanagalu Oya, will be studied at a later stage after additional water\nresources data has been collected.\n\n58.\nThe  resources  required  to  undertake  the  planning  studies  will  be  modest.  The  Project  will\nprovide  costs  for  traveling  and  field  visits,  workshops,  public  information  campaigns,  and  a  river\nbasin  planning  specialist  to  advise  and  guide  the  study  teams.  These  activities  will,  however  be\nintimately connected to the training and demonstration activities for institution building (paras. 59-62)\ninasmuch  as  it  will  allow  for  the  identification  of  the  training  needs  of  NWRA  and  partner  agency\n                                                \n19  One  component  of  part  B,  the  construction  of  low-flow  measuring  weirs,  will  also  be  closely  connected  to  this\n\ncomponent.\n\n\f14\n\nstaff,  and  installation  of  small  facilities  to  demonstrate  pilot  implementation  of  water  resource\nmanagement and planning.\n\nii.\n\nTraining and Demonstrations for Institution Building\n\nIntegrated  water  resources  management,  based  on  the  concept  that  water  is  a  limited\n59.\nresource that must be conserved and shared, is a relatively new concept in Sri Lanka.  The country\nis seriously short of the expertise needed to ensure that effective water resources planning can be\ncarried out. There is need for people with skills in resource inventory, interdisciplinary coordination\nand  planning,  long-term  monitoring,  social  impact  assessment,  conflict  resolution  and  negotiation,\npublic awareness campaigns, resource management legislation, environmental impact assessment,\nadministration of water law and entitlements, and economics of resource management.\n\nTraining and skills upgrading in all those areas will be needed at all levels if NWRA and its\n60.\npartner  agencies  are  to  function  effectively.  Training  will  be  focused  on  the  functional  aspects  of\nwater  resource  management,  which  have  been  identified  through  previous  technical  assistance,\nand, in particular, on those functions that will be activated through the Project. A significant portion of\ntraining  will  be  directed  to  the  partner  agencies  that  will  work  with  NWRA  through  agreed-upon\nsharing  of  functional  responsibilities.  The  final  details  of  the  training  program  will  depend  on\ncompletion  of  a  training  needs  assessment  and  a  survey  of  training  opportunities  and  modalities.\nThe  training  program  must  be  flexible  to  accommodate  emerging  issues  and  needs  and  to  allow\nagencies and other stakeholders (universities, water user groups, etc.) to identify training needs in\nresponse to their priorities. For example, the training needs assessment for NWRA will have to be\ncoordinated with its staff recruitment plan.\n\n61.\nThe  Project  will  provide  funding  for  a  demand-driven  training  program,  based  on  the\nsubmission  of  training  proposals  by  NWRA  and  its  partner  agencies,  and  other  involved\nstakeholders20 on a continuing basis over the life of the Project. Small-scale physical demonstrations\nto  implement  basin  plans,  such  as  installation  of  measuring  devices  or  modifications  to  existing\nstructures  to  calibrate  them  for  measuring  flows,  will  also  be  funded.  Training  and  demonstration\nproposals  and  their  justification  will  be  prepared  by  NWRA  and  its  partner  agencies  with  the\nassistance  of  training  and  other  specialists  financed  by  the  Project.  The  proposals  will  then  be\nsubmitted  to  a  technical  evaluation  committee  within  NWRA  for  examination  and  then,  if  deemed\nworthwhile,  to  a  senior  panel  for  final  approval.21  Components  of  the  training  and  demonstration\nprogram  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  as  they  are  developed.  Following  training,  the  staff\nwill  be  assigned  to  relevant  positions  or  tasks  wherever  possible.  The  proposed  training  program,\nincluding  a  list  of  suggested  selection  criteria  for  training,  is  described  in  Appendix  6.  The  criteria\nprovide for gender balance in the selection of participants.\n\n62.\nTraining is envisaged to cover both international and national long- and short-term academic\ncourses,  tailor-made  courses  (both  local  and  international),  on-the-job  training  by  international  and\ndomestic  experts  or  approved  NGO  groups,  and  secondment  of  selected  personnel  to  relevant\noperational agencies such as functioning water management authorities in developed and regional\ncountries.  Some  of  this  training  and  related  technical  advice  will  be  provided  through  a  long-term\ntwinning relationship between NWRA and a parallel water management agency in another country.\nThis  twinning  relationship  will  facilitate  the  provision  of  very  practical,  targeted  training  relating  to\nspecific water management functions and tasks. It will also allow greater flexibility in responding to\nemerging technical issues and training needs on a rapid-response and well-informed basis.\n\n                                                \n20  Note  that  while  the  training  opportunities  will  be  available  to  all  related  stakeholders  (NGOs,  community  groups,\n\nacademic institutions, etc.), training proposals will be submitted in consultation with the related agency.\n\n21  A suitable panel being considered by the Government is the NWRA Board.\n\n\f15\n\n2.\n\nInfrastructure for Water Resource Management (Part B)\n\n63.\nPart B will be of the construction of the Kelani Conservation Barrage for water level control\nnear  the  intake  for  the  Colombo  water  supply  treatment  plant  at  Ambatale  together  with  the\nconstruction of low-flow measuring weirs, including one on the Kelani River to guide the operation of\nthe barrage.\n\na.\n\nKelani Conservation Barrage\n\nThe barrage will have an adjustable crest that can be raised and lowered to control the water\n64.\nlevel at the treatment plant intake.  This need arises because the progressive lowering of the river\nlevels due to excessive sand mining and the decline of river discharges in recent times has caused\nthe  intake  of  saline  water  by  the  plant  and  reduced  the  extraction  rates  due  to  lower  pumping\nefficiency.  The  barrage  will  enable  water  levels  to  be  raised  and  maintained  at  the  original  design\nlevels during the dry season. It will thus restore the original pumping capacity and also prevent the\nintake of saline water. In practice, the crest of the barrage will be raised only at critical times of the\nyear, when low flows in the months between February and May could otherwise mean disruption in\nthe  water  supply  due  to  low  water  levels  and  saline  intrusion.  As  an  adjustable  structure  used\nsparingly and at critical times when contamination of the city's water supply looks imminent, it will not\nnormally interfere with either the flows or the use of the river. Without the barrage, the ever-present\ndanger  is  that  the  water  supply  to  the  whole  of  Greater  Colombo  (nearly  2  million  persons,\nthousands  of  businesses,  and  hundreds  of  industries)  could  be  severely  reduced  or  cut  off  for\nseveral days at a time. The only viable alternatives that could be completed within the urgent time\nframe  are  (i)  to  move  the  intake  and  water  treatment  plant  further  upstream;  (ii)  to  pump  from  a\nneighboring basin, at considerable expense; or (iii) to operate upstream hydropower reservoirs and\nconsumptive  water  diversions  to  significantly  increase  flows  in  the  lower  river.  All  of  these\nalternatives would involve significantly higher costs.\n\nb.\n\nLow-Flow Weirs\n\n65.\nThis component will finance the installation of small, fixed-crest weirs to allow accurate and\nreliable  measurement  of  low  flows  in  critical  rivers  at  critical  times.  This  is  essential  for  effective\nmanagement  of  the  water  resources,  and  for  the  effective  operation  of  the  Kelani  Conservation\nBarrage during the dry season. Provision is made for the installation of six low-flow weirs at various\nlocations  in  the  western  rivers  around  Colombo.  Although  they  are  relatively  expensive,  the  weirs\nprovide a definite and secure solution for achieving accurate measurement of low flows by stabilizing\notherwise  variable  river  conditions.  It  is  recognized  that  cheaper  nonstructural  solutions  requiring\nregular flow measurements at short intervals may be appropriate at some sites instead of the weirs,\nor  there  may  be  more  efficient  sites  for  the  weirs.  Hence  the  program  will  be  reviewed  in  further\ndetail during implementation and the Executing Agency and ADB will agree on modifications prior to\nimplementation.\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $28.2 million equivalent. The foreign exchange\n66.\ncost is estimated at $14.8 million, or about 52 percent of the total, including $0.5 million for interest\nduring construction (IDC) under the ADB loan. The local currency cost is $13.4 million equivalent, or\nabout 48 percent of the total, including $1.2 million for IDC on the amount onlent to NWSDB (para.\n68). The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1. Further details and the scheduling are shown in\nAppendix 7.\n\n\f16\n\nTable 1:  Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nComponent\n\nA.

The  loan  will  finance  $14.8\nmillion of the foreign exchange cost (including IDC of $0.5 million), and $4.9 million equivalent of the\nlocal  currency  cost.  The  financing  of  local  costs  would  cover  the  costs  relating  to  equipment  and\nmaterials,  consulting  services,  and  part  of  the  civil  works,  all  excluding  duties  and  taxes,  and  the\ncosts  of  project  management.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  costs  of  $8.5  million\nequivalent (Table 2). The Government has indicated that it wishes to arrange cofinancing through a\nbilateral grant to cover at least some of the services under the twinning arrangements (para. 62).22\n\n                                                \n22  A proposal for the cofinancing has been prepared and potential sources have been approached. For the purpose of\nappraisal, the financing plan assumes no cofinancing since no firm cofinancing has been identified, and is unlikely to\nbe for some time.\n\n\f17\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\n\nSource\nAsian Development Bank\nGovernment\nTotal\n\nForeign\nExchange\n14.8\n-\n14.8\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n4.9\n8.5\n13.4\n\nTotal\nCost\n19.7\n8.5\n28.2\n\nPercent\n\n70\n30\n100\n\n68.\nThe proposed ADB loan will have a repayment period of 32 years, including an 8-year grace\nperiod, and will carry an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent thereafter.

Through a\nsubsidiary  financing  agreement  for  onlending,  the  Government  will  make  available  to  NWSDB  the\nADB  loan  proceeds  relating  to  the  construction  of  the  Kelani  Conservation  Barrage.

The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk, which\nis covered by the interest rate for onlending.\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Management\n\n69.\nPart A will be implemented under the direct supervision and guidance of the director general\nof the WRS (subsequently NWRA once established).  The director general will be given appropriate\nauthority to implement the Project and will set up and head a core implementation team comprising\nthe senior NWRA staff and long-term consultants to (i) supervise the implementation of the physical\nestablishment  of  WRS/NWRA,  (ii)  supervise  the  provision  of  funds  to  partner  agencies  for  the\nimplementation of the database improvement component,  (iii) supervise the implementation of the\npilot  studies  to  prepare  water  resources  management  plans,  and  (iv)  supervise  the  training  and\ndemonstration  program.  In  addition,  interagency  working  groups  will  be  set  up  to  oversee  and\ncoordinate  project  activities  for  each  component.  To  implement  the  training  program,  a  technical\nteam  will  also  be  appointed  to  review  training  proposals  and  a  senior-level  committee  will  be\nappointed  to  finalize  their  approval.    Specific  details  on  the  operation  of  the  training  program  are\nspelled out in Appendix 6.  For database improvement, each Implementing Agency (IA) - (ID, WRB,\nand  NWSDB)  will  designate  a  senior  officer  to  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  their\nrespective  subcomponents.  Cooperation  agreements  between  WRS/NWRA  and  the  three  IAs  will\nalso be finalized by 31 May 2001 in advance of key implementation activities.\n\n70.\nPart  B  will  be  implemented  through  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  to  be  established  in\nNWSDB. A project manager will be appointed prior to loan effectiveness to head this unit, and will be\nprovided  with  appropriate  technical  and  supporting  staff  and  an  operating  budget.  The  design  and\nconstruction supervision of the low flow weirs will be undertaken under the guidance of the director\nof the Hydrology Branch of ID. The flow of funds for the low-flow weirs component has been spelled\nout as part of the cooperation agreement between NWSDB and ID.\n\n                                                \n23  The rationale for giving part of the financing to NWSDB as a grant is the Government\u2019s existing policy to subsidize the\n\nrural water supply.\n\n\f2.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n18\n\n71.\nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years  from  December  2000  to  December  2005,\nallowing for the full completion of the construction and one year of operation of the barrage, and a\nfive-year  operation  of  the  training  and  demonstrations  program.  Within  this  period,  it  should  be\npossible  to  commence  pilot  studies  on  another  river  basin  (Attanagalu  Oya)  once  the  first  two,\nstarted at the inception of the Project, are successfully under way. An implementation schedule for\nthe Project is presented in Appendix 8.\n\n3.\n\nProcurement\n\nADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for\n72.\nProcurement. Equipment and vehicles on a list prepared by WRS/NWRA and the partner agencies\nwill be procured directly by the WRS/NWRA. Equipment for the database improvement component\nwill  be  procured  by  WRS/NWRA,  from  a  list  of  requirements  provided  by  the  IAs  (ID,  WRB,\nNWSDB).  Equipment  packages  costing  $100,000-$500,000  may  be  procured  by  international\nshopping,  except  that  direct  purchase  with  prior  approval  from  the  ADB  may  be  permitted  for\nspecialized  proprietary  equipment.  Equipment  packages  costing  less  than  $100,000  may  be\nprocured through direct purchase. Indicative procurement packaging is shown in Appendix 9.\n\nConsumables for part A (travel costs, workshop expenses, etc. especially for the pilot water\n73.\nbasin studies) will be purchased by NWRA on a reimbursable basis. The contracts for minor amount\nof civil works will be undertaken through local competitive bidding with ADB\u2019s prior approval of the\nprocedures.\n\n74.\nProcurement  for  the  training  program  will  vary,  depending  on  the  type  of  training  to  be\nprovided.  Prior  ADB  approval  will  be  obtained  for  expenditures.  For  short-course  and  academic\ndegree training, reimbursement of expenses will apply. Twinning arrangements with water resources\nagencies  will  be  based  on  selection  within  the  training  proposal  from  a  list  of  prequalified  twinning\nagencies, prepared by the training consultants at the inception of the Project. Resource experts for\non-the-job  training  not  covered  by  twinning  arrangements  (Appendix  6)  will  be  recruited  following\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  All  training  will  be  carried  out  in  ADB  member\ncountries.\n\n75.\nConstruction of the barrage in part B will be awarded under a single civil works contract. The\ncontractor will be responsible for construction and the supply of all related equipment and materials.\nThis contract will be procured through international competitive bidding.  Minor equipment needed by\nPMU  may  be  procured  by  direct  purchase  if  it  costs  less  than  $100,000  and  by  international\nshopping where the procurement package exceeds $100,000.\n\nEach of the low-flow weirs will be constructed under separate civil works packages. The size\n76.\nof  the  packages  will  range  from  about  $200,000  to  $400,000  each,  and  will  be  scattered\ngeographically, with implementation spread over about two years. These packages are unlikely to be\nof interest to international firms. Hence, it is proposed that the civil works for the weirs be procured\nthrough  local  competitive  bidding,  using  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  There  is  a  strong  local\nconstruction  industry  in  Sri  Lanka,  hence  there  will  be  adequate  competition  among  many  local\ncontractors considered capable of undertaking this type of work.\n\n\f4.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n19\n\n77.\nThe  Project  will  require  351  person-months  of  quantified  consulting  services:  111  of\ninternational  and  240  domestic.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  use  of\ndomestic  consultants. Part  A  will  require  78  person-months  of  international  and  174  of  domestic\nexpertise for project coordination and implementation assistance, training, institutional reform, policy\nsupport,  finance  and  administration,  instrumentation,  data  and  informatics,  hydrogeology  and  river\nbasin planning. The consultants are to be recruited on an individual basis, given that most positions\ncover a broad and diversified range of disciplines. For part B, consulting services will consist of 99\nperson-months\u201433 \ninternational  and  66  domestic\u2014for  engineering  design,  construction\nsupervision,  geotechnical  investigations,  contract  administration,  hydrology,  social  and  public\nparticipation,  and  the  environment.  A  domestic  firm  in  association  with  an  international  firm  will\nprovide the consulting services. The consultants\u2019 outline terms of reference are in Appendix 10.\n\n78.\nIn  addition,  it  is  estimated  that  about  40  person-months  of  international  and  about  50  of\ndomestic  expertise  will  be  required  for  on-the-job  training  purposes,  depending  on  the  design  and\ncontent of the training proposals to be received during project implementation. They will be recruited\non an individual basis.\n\nADB  has  approved  the  Government  request  that  consultant  recruitment  procedures\n79.\n(including  shortlisting,  inviting  proposals,  evaluation,  ADB  concurrence,  and  contract  negotiations),\nmay  be  done  prior  to  loan  effectiveness.  This  advance  action  will  allow  contracts  for  consulting\nservices to be signed immediately after the proposed loan becomes effective. The Government has\nbeen informed that this approval will not commit ADB to financing the Project.\n\n5.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\nThe facilities built under part A as well as the low-flow weirs in part B will be maintained and\n80.\nused by the agencies for which they are intended, i.e., the building and equipment for NWRA will be\noperated  and  maintained  by  NWRA;  the  surface  water  data  collection  network  (including  the  low-\nflow weirs) will be operated and maintained by the Hydrology Branch of ID; and the equipment and\nmonitoring  wells  for  groundwater  monitoring  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by  WRB.  The\nGovernment has given assurances that the recurrent budget of these agencies will be augmented in\npace with the implementation of the Project to allow for efficient O&M. During the project period, the\nprovision of an adequate O&M budget will be monitored by ADB.\n\n81.\nThe barrage will be operated and maintained by NWSDB since the structure is designed to\nprotect its water intake facilities at Ambatale. NWSDB will establish a permanent line in the annual\nrecurrent  budget  (estimated  at  about  $56,000)  for  this  expense  and  appropriate  funds  will  be\nallocated annually.\n\n6.\n\nDisbursement Procedures\n\nTo  ensure  the  timely  release  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  counterpart  funds  and  expedite\n82.\nproject  implementation,  the  Government  will  open  and  maintain  imprest  accounts  for  both\nWRS/NWRA  and  NWSDB.  These  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in\naccordance  with  ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the\nimprest  accounts  will  be  based  on  the  estimated  expenditure  for  the  first  four  months  of  project\nimplementation,  but  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of  $0.5  million  for  each.  Payments  to  the\ninternational  contractor  for  the  barrage  civil  works  will  be  by  direct  payment  procedures.  The\nstatement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  all  small  payments  and  contracts  under\n\n\f20\n\n$100,000 equivalent (in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook) except that full detailed\naccounting will be required for expenses for the training program.\n\n7.\n\nAccounts, Audits, and Reports\n\nThe director general of WRS/NWRA and the PMU project manager of NWSDB will establish\n83.\nand maintain the accounts and records of project progress and expenditures in such a manner as to\nfacilitate the identification of income and expenditures related to the Project. Each will be assisted by\nan adequate number of qualified accounting staff, including one accountant each dedicated solely to\nmonitoring project expenses, reimbursement, and accounts.\n\n84. WRS/NWRA  and  NWSDB  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project  and  ensure  that\naccounts  and  financial  statements  are  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  and\nauditing  principles  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Audited  accounts  and  financial  statements,\ntogether with the report of the auditor, will be submitted to ADB within 12 months of the close of the\nrelated  financial  year,  as  per  NWSDB  present  practice  in  the  Third  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation\nSector Project (footnote 11). The audited report should include a separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the\nuse of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures.\n\n85.\nEach  agency  involved  in  the  project  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports.  For  part  A,  the\nreports will be collated within WRS/NWRA and submitted to ADB. For part B, the project manager of\nPMU  will  submit  the  reports  directly  to  ADB.  The  reports  will  detail  the  achievements  to  date  as\nrelated  to  the  implementation  schedule,  targets,  and  plans  for  the  next  reporting  period,  and\nproblems requiring resolution and the steps being taken to resolve them.\n\n8.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n\n86.\nThe  impact  of  a  project  for  institution  building  and  resource  conservation  is  expected  to  be\nbroad  and  long  term  and  identifying  specific  project  beneficiaries  will  be  difficult.  For  Part  A,\nhowever, the recipients of training can give general assessments of performance outputs including\ntheir effectiveness to carry out their assigned tasks once they return to their regular duties.  For the\ndatabase  improvement  component,  the  quality  and  quantity  of  available  data  will  be  a  useful\nmonitoring indicator. In  assessing  the benefits of the Kelani Conservation Barrage, the impact can\nbe monitored by measuring salinity and water levels below the barrage while it is in operation (during\nlow flow periods), and comparing those with records at the intake. The quality and quantity of water\nreaching domestic users would be a meaningful measuring tool.\n\n87.\nSpecific benefit monitoring activities will thus include an annual review and evaluation of the\nimplementation and results of the training program, annual reviews of the data collected through the\ndatabase improvement component, and regular monitoring of the quantity and quality of water being\nsupplied  to  Greater  Colombo  through  the  Ambatale  pumping  station.  The  training  program  review\nand an annual review of the database improvement component will be carried out by the Policy and\nPlanning Division of NWRA, while NWSDB will measure water quality and quantity at Ambatale plant\nand at selected consumer sites.\n\n9.\n\nPeriodic Reviews\n\n88.\nRegular  project  implementation  reviews  will  be  required,  and  will  be  supplemented  by  a\ncomprehensive midterm review of progress within three years of loan effectiveness. That will enable\nthe Government and ADB to make appropriate adjustments to the project design, if necessary. The\nmidterm  review  will  cover  the  overall  status  of  implementation,  with  particular  emphasis  on\nassessing the effectiveness of the basin plans and the training and demonstration program, and the\n\n\f21\n\nsustainability  of  benefits.  It  will  also  look  at  how  the  linkages  between  NWRA  and  its  partner\nagencies  have  developed,  and,  where  applicable,  the  progress  of  institutional  reforms  and\nstrengthening  in  the  partner  agencies.  There  will  be  a  final  evaluation  of  project  performance.  The\nneed for and scope of the reviews have been discussed and agreed upon with the Government.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agencies\n\n89.\nBecause  of  the  nature  of  the  Project\u2014it  entails  both  institution  and  sector-wide  capacity\nbuilding  (part  A)  and  specific  project  investments  (part  B)\u2014there  will  be  two  Executing  Agencies\n(EAs). The EAs and the IAs that will work with them are described in the following paragraphs.\n\n1.\n\nInstitutional Development (Part A)\n\nThe  EA  for  part  A  will  eventually  be  NWRA  to  be  established  under  the  National  Water\n90.\nResources  Act.  NWRA  is  expected  to  be  formally  established  and  functioning  not  later  than  31\nDecember 2001 (Appendix 3, Table A3.1). Until then, the WRS, as the existing precursor of NWRA,\nwill be the EA.\n\n91.\nThe  institutional  structure  of  NWRA  is  spelled  out  in  the  National  Water  Resources  Policy\n(Appendix  2).  It  is  envisaged  that  NWRA  will  have  a  staff  of  34  professionals  and  17  support\npersonnel.  It  will  be  under  the  direction  of  a  board  consisting  of  seven  senior  officers  with  sound\nprofessional qualifications and experience related to water resources management. The chairman of\nthe  board  will  report  directly  to  the  head  of  state.  Functional  divisions  of  NWRA  will  consist  of  a\npolicy  and  planning  division  responsible  for  policy,  information  management,  and  planning;  a  field\nservices division responsible for water entitlements, and community and institutional services; and a\nlegal and administrative division. The proposed organization chart for NWRA is in Appendix 4.\n\n92.\nThe  WRS  currently  has  12  staff\u20149  professionals  and  3  support  staff\u2014and  is  headed  by  a\ndirector.  In  its  present  form,  the  WRS  has,  with  the  assistance  of  consultants,  prepared  the  policy\nand institutional reform packages. An important function has been to lead the consultation process\nwith  all  concerned  stakeholders,  including  other  agencies,  NGOs,  and  community  groups.  In  the\nprocess, the staff have gained a sound understanding of the objectives of the proposed NWRA. As\nsuch, the current WRS will be able to adequately handle activities during the lead up to the Project\nand  also  during  the  initial  stages.24  Prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  the  WRS  will  be  strengthened  with\nthe appointment of an interim board (chairman and three board members), the director general, and\nthree directors (all positions as proposed for NWRA). Subsequently, staff at the other levels will be\nquickly increased at the commencement of the Project so as to respond to the scheduled activities.\nThe current director of the WRS is likely to be appointed to the position of director general. Subject\nto their satisfactory performance, other WRS staff are expected to be absorbed as permanent staff\nof  NWRA  once  NWRA  becomes  a  legal  entity.  A  NWRA  Establishment  Committee  has  been\nestablished to facilitate staff recruitment and budget provision. A time-bound action plan for staffing\nthe  WRS/NWRA  has  been  agreed  upon  with  the  Government  (Appendix  3,  Table  A3.2).  This\nadequately facilitates the project start-up under the WRS and a smooth transfer of responsibilities to\nNWRA.\n\n93.\nRegarding the ability of the WRS and NWRA to act as EAs, it may be noted that WRS has\nalready  functioned  as  EA  for  two  major  ADB-financed  TAs  of  over  $1.0  million  each.  Current  staff\nare therefore familiar with ADB procurement and operational procedures. In addition, it can be safely\nassumed  that  many  NWRA  staff  will  come  from  existing  water  resources  agencies  (e.g.,  NWSDB,\nMASL, ID, and CEB), which have extensive experience in implementing projects financed by either\n\n                                                \n24  There is ongoing assistance under TA 2422-SRI and TA 3030-SRI (para. 2)  to aid the WRS with this task.\n\n\f22\n\nADB  or  the  World  Bank.  They  too  will  be  experienced  in  the  operational  aspects  of  the\nimplementation of multilaterally funded projects.\n\n94.\nThese implementation arrangements contain the inherent risk that, for one reason or another\nand  despite  the  best  intentions  of  the  Government,  NWRA  will  not  be  established  or  its\nestablishment  will  be  inordinately  delayed.  As  a  contingency  against  this  eventuality,  the\nGovernment  has  agreed  that  if  NWRA  is  not  functioning  by  31  December  2001,  disbursements\nunder the loan may be suspended. The Government has also agreed that, prior to establishment of\nNWRA,  no  contracts  will  be  awarded  without  ADB  approval  (Appendix  9).  In  particular,  civil  works\ncontracts under part B will not be awarded, and expenditure and/or commitments under the training\nand  demonstration  component  in  part  A  will  not  exceed  $100,000.  The  contracts  for  consulting\nservices will also provide for their automatic termination by the Government within 90 days after the\nagreed-upon deadline for the establishment and functioning of NWRA (31 December 2001) fails to\nmaterialize (Appendix 8).\n\n95.\nSeveral  partner  agencies  will  be  involved  in  part  A:  ID,  MASL,  WRB,  NWSDB,  CEA,  CEB,\nprovincial  councils  and  district  authorities  in  selected  pilot  basins,  and  others.  All  are  expected  to\nplay a role, to varying extents, in implementing the database improvement component, participate in\nthe  pilot  water  resources  planning  studies,  and  participate  in  the  demand-driven  training  and\ndemonstration program. Three of the partner agencies will be IAs, responsible for implementing the\ndatabase improvement component. The ID will be the major IA for the surface water aspects of the\ncomponent, WRB will be the IA for the groundwater aspects of (including groundwater quality) and\nNWSDB  will  be  the  IA  for  the  surface  water  quality  aspects.  MASL  will  be  a  major  contributor  in\ndeveloping a centralized database.\n\n2.  \n\nInfrastructure for Water Resource Management (Part B)\n\n96.\nThe  EA  for  part  B  will  be  NWSDB,  a  competent  EA  as  demonstrated  in  the  course  of\nimplementation of earlier ADB-financed projects. NWSDB is the national water utility and has about\n8,000 employees. Its headquarters are in Colombo, and it has five regional resource centers and a\nnumber of district offices throughout the country. It has a board of directors with a full-time chairman\nand a general manager. The daily water production of NWSDB is about 800,000 cubic meters (m3),\nIts  annual  development\nserving  320,000  domestic  and  45,000  nondomestic  connections. \nexpenditure  is  around  SLRs3  billion  ($51  million),  and  operational  expenditures,  met  from  its  own\nrevenues,  are  around  SLRs2  billion  ($34  million).  Twenty  percent  of  its  staff  are  involved  in\ndevelopment and 80 percent in operations.\n\n97.\nNWSDB will be directly responsible for the design, construction and operation of the Kelani\nConservation Barrage, which falls well within the board\u2019s mandate as an agency supplying water to\nthe  urban  area  of  Greater  Colombo.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  to  take  responsibility  for  design\nand construction supervision of the barrage. In addition, NWSDB will have overall responsibility for\nthe construction of the low-flow weirs. In some cases, the use of the weirs is directly related to the\noperation of NWSDB infrastructure. For example, the low-flow weir at Glencorse on the Kelani River\nwill be necessary for the effective operation of the barrage. In other cases, the data obtained from\nthe weirs will be used by NWSDB for future operational planning. However, the design, construction\nsupervision, and operation of the weirs for data collection will be the responsibility of the ID as IA.\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Management of Executing Agencies\n\n98.\nSince  NWRA  is  a  new  agency,  its  establishment  will  be  supported  through  the  Project.  To\nensure that financial management capacity is established from the start of the Project, provision has\nbeen made for a domestic finance and administration specialist to work for 30 months with the newly\n\n\f23\n\nrecruited NWRA staff to establish financial systems and procedures, including information systems.\nCurrently,  the  budgeting  and  accounting  requirements  of  the  WRS  are  being  met  by  the  National\nPlanning Department (NPD) in the  Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP). This arrangement is\nexpected  to  continue  until  NWRA  is  fully  established.  ADB  recently  funded  the  Financial\nManagement  Training  Project,25  which  sought  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  financial  management\nsystems in the public sector. The training infrastructure created under that Project will be available\nfor training the NWRA staff.\n\n99.\nThe need for NWSDB to improve its financial management has also been recognized and is\nbeing  supported  through  the  ongoing  Third  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (footnote\n11).  Over  the  past  three  years,  NWSDB  has  recruited  professionally  qualified  accountants  to\nstrengthen  its  financial  management  capacity,  and  proposes  to  train  its  own  partially  qualified\naccountants through the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. It is also proposed that a\nspecial review of NWSDB accounting systems be conducted, by an international accounting firm, in\nconsultation with the auditor general of Sri Lanka, under a small-scale TA.26\n\n100. Some  delays  have  been  noted  in  the  compliance  with  some  loan  covenants  of  the  Third\nWater  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project.  Covenants  that  require  adoption  of  a  national  water\npolicy  and  related  legislation  are  being  pursued  under  the  Project.  The  National  Water  Resources\nPolicy  was  adopted  in  March  2000,  one  year  behind  schedule.  Preparation  of  legislation  is  now  in\nprogress  and  will  be  supported  by  the  Project.  Compliance  with  other  covenants  requiring  the\nintroduction of private sector participation in the operation of the Greater Colombo water supply has\nalso been delayed. The compliance dates have been rescheduled to allow prior establishment of a\nregulatory body. ADB is assisting the Government with this through a study by ADB staff27 to look at\noptions  for  private  sector  participation.  In  addition,  TA  3434  (footnote  26)  will  provide  baseline\ninformation  by  December  2000  for  developing  the  options.  This  TA  will  also  strengthen  NWSDB\u2019s\nfinancial management to ensure timely compilation and auditing of annual accounts.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n101. An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  for  the  Project  and  a  summary\nIEE is in Appendix 11. The IEE concluded that only minor potential impacts can be expected, and\nthat the required mitigation measures are readily available. A full environmental impact assessment\nis not required. The main environmental concern was the potential impact of the construction of the\nbarrage  and  the  low-flow  weirs  on  the  aquatic  life  in  the  rivers  where  the  structures  will  be  built.\nSince migratory species are only at risk if their passage is blocked during periods of high flows, at\nwhich time the crest of the barrage will be fully lowered and the low-flow weirs will be submerged,\nsignificant impacts are not expected. Other minor impacts will occur during construction, but they will\nbe  minor  and  temporary  disturbances  for  which  mitigation  measures  are  readily  available.\nConstruction methods for the barrage will use best practices to avoid or minimize disturbance.\n\n102.\nThe low-flow weirs are meant primarily as a water-monitoring tool. They will be of low profile\nand  require  only  minimal  construction  activity.  Since  they  cause  only  small  height  differential,\nsignificant  impacts  are  not  expected.  An  assessment  of  one  potential  location  concluded  that  the\nimpacts would not be significant. However, because the precise locations and designs for the weirs\n\n                                                \n25  Loan 1275-SRI: Financial Management Training Project, for $13,000,000, approved on 29 November 1993.\n26  TA    3434-SRI:  Accounting Review of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board,  for  $100,000,  approved  on\n\n27  McIntosh,  A.  C.,  Y\u00f1iguez,  C.  E.  2000.  A  Study  on  Privatization  of  Water  Supplies  in  Ten  Asian  Cities.  Asian\n\n10 May 2000.\n\nDevelopment Bank, Manila.\n\n\f24\n\nwill  not  be  known  until  project  implementation,  IEEs  will  need  to  be  carried  out  at  that  time.  The\nGovernment has provided assurances that an IEE will be undertaken and approved by ADB prior to\nthe construction of each individual weir, once its site is finalized. Consulting services included under\nthe Project will carry out that task.\n\n2.\n\nSocial Concerns\n\n103. Only  very  minor  negative  social  impacts  are  expected  from  the  Project  and  measures  to\nmitigate are available. Some minor river traffic passing the site of the barrage (mainly log and sand\ntransport) will potentially be disrupted by the construction. To mitigate that, a log transport passage\nhas been built into the barrage design, and construction will be phased so that the river is seldom, if\never, fully blocked to river traffic.  An alternative site for the unloading of sand mining barges will be\nidentified upstream of the barrage.\n\n104.\nThe  Project  will  require  minor  temporary  land  acquisition  for  use  during  construction  of  the\nbarrage (approximately 0.5 ha of privately owned land). There is no settlement on the land, thus no\nhouseholds  will  be  relocated.  It  is  estimated  that  5-7  households  will  be  affected  through  loss  of\ncoconut  and  banana  trees.  Losses  can  be  minimized  by  careful  siting  of  the  construction  works.\nCompensation will be paid according to market price as per the Land Law in Sri Lanka and ADB\u2019s\nHandbook on Resettlement.  A  Short  Resettlement  Plan  has  been  prepared,  which  includes  the\nproposed  compensation  for  the  losses  and  procedures  for  compensation.  The  EA  will  settle  all\ncompensation  prior  to  construction  work.  An  adequate  budget  has  been  provided  in  the  Project  to\ncover the cost of temporary land acquisition and loss of other assets.\n\nA.\n\nEconomic and Financial Analyses\n\nV. \n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\n105. A  summary  of  the  financial  and  economic  analyses  is  presented  in  this  section;  further\ndetails, \nin\nAppendix 12.\n\nincluding  assumptions,  quantification  of  benefits,  and  sensitivity  analysis,  are \n\n1.\n\nEconomic Justification\n\n106.\nThe  institutional  strengthening  of  water  resource  management  under  part  A  will  bring  a\nnumber  of  nonquantifiable  benefits  arising  from  the  conservation  of  scarce  water  resources.  The\nassistance  will  support  the  policy  objective  of  safeguarding  investments  in  water  resources\ndevelopment  and  other  sectors  of  the  economy  by  providing  water  rights  and  entitlements.\nDeveloping  a  comprehensive,  river  basin-oriented  approach  through  the  pilot  studies  will  ensure  a\nhealthy environment and sustainable use of both surface water and groundwater resources.\n\n107.\nThe  economic  benefits  of  the  Kelani  Conservation  Barrage  arise  from  (i)  cost  savings  it\nprovides  compared  to  supplying  equivalent  raw  water  volumes  from  alternative  sources  in  the  dry\nseason  when  saline  intrusion  is  probable  without  the  barrage;  (ii)  cost  savings  accruing  from  the\nimproved efficiency of the existing pumping facilities due to higher river levels in the dry season at\nAmbatale; and (iii) reduced raw water extraction losses at Ambatale in the dry season.\n\n108.\nThe results of the economic evaluation are presented in terms of (i) the average incremental\neconomic  cost  (AIEC),  and  (ii)  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  The  AIEC  measures  the\nmarginal  economic  cost  of  the  incremental  volume  of  raw  water  provided  by  the  barrage,  and  has\nbeen calculated as a function of the incremental raw water in the dry season. At a discount rate of\n12  percent,  the  AIEC  has  been  estimated  to  be  SLRs10.5  per  m3,  which  compares  favorably  with\nNWSDB\u2019s  1998  average  unit  cost  of  SLRs14.6  per  m3  for  every  unit  billed.  Three  future  demand\n\n\f25\n\nscenarios were considered in the analysis; low, medium, and high.28 The medium-demand scenario\nis considered most likely. Its base case EIRR was 22.1 percent (ranging from 16.0 percent for the\nlow-  to  22.1  percent  for  the  high-demand  scenarios).  Sensitivity  analysis  found  the  EIRRs  to  be\nrobust: in the worst case for the medium-demand scenario, the EIRR dropped to 12.8 percent when\ncosts increased by 10 percent and benefits lagged by two years, and ranged from 14.5 percent to\n19.3 percent in other cases.\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Justification\n\nThe financial implications of the proposed investment in the barrage have been assessed in\n109.\nterms of the estimated capital costs, financing requirements, and the potential impact on NWSDB\u2019s\nfinancial operations. As the barrage will not be a profit center in its own right, key cost parameters\nthat will have a direct impact on NWSDB\u2019s future financial projections and commitments have been\nassessed.  The  financial  impact  on  NWSDB\u2019s  performance  has  been  measured  in  terms  of  the\npercentage increase in (i) the annual O&M costs (0.1 percent); (ii) depreciation charges (2.1 percent\nper annum); and (iii) interest charges (4.7 percent per annum). To incorporate the cost impact of the\ninvestment, it is estimated that NWSDB\u2019s projected water tariff of SLRs22.6 per m3 in 2005 will need\nto be increased by only SLRs0.3 per m3 (1.3 percent), which is not a significant increase.\n\nB.\n\nEnvironment\n\n110.\nIn  the  long  term,  the  Project  will  have  a  distinctly  positive  environmental  impact.  The  main\nlong-term intent of the Project, particularly part A, is to provide the Government with the capacity to\neffectively  manage  the  country's  water  resources.  This  means  that  in  planning  future  use  of  water\nresources,  environmental  considerations  will  be  fully  taken  into  consideration.  More  specifically,\nduring river basin planning all uses and requirements for water will be taken into account and special\nallocations  can  be  made  for  such  purposes  as  fisheries  or  wildlife  and  to  protect  unique\nenvironmental areas such as wetlands. Furthermore, by taking an integrated and holistic approach\nto planning, it will be possible to ensure the siting of potentially polluting industries in areas where\nthey  will  do  the  least  amount  of  environmental  damage  and  to  identify  where  specific  mitigation\nmeasures are required.\n\nC.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n111.\nThe social impact of the project will, in the short term, be either neutral or very minor (para.\n103).  The  long-term  social  impact  will,  however,  be  significant.  Most  issues  in  water  use  are\nultimately social. Conflicts in water use are primarily conflicts between the use of water by one group\nof  people  and  the  use  of  water  by  another  (or  even  the  demand  for  different  uses  by  the  same\ngroup).  The  conflicts  may  be  manifested  in  the  need  for  domestic  water  versus  the  need  for\nirrigation; the need for watershed protection versus the need for upland dwellers to grow food crops\nand make a living; and the need for garbage and sewage disposal versus the need for fresh drinking\nwater. Planning water use thus entails, to a large extent, the resolution of conflicting or competing\nuses of a limited resource among social groups. Having a mechanism to do that (NWRA, river basin\nplanning  committees,  the  Water  Resources  Tribunal)  ensures  that,  to  the  extent  possible,  each\nsocial  group  will  be  able,  through  a  consultative  process,  to  obtain  maximum  access  to  water  in  a\nway that is consistent with the overall social good.\n\n                                                \n28  The low, medium, and high future demand scenarios assume total raw water extraction will increase by 40, 57, and 75\npercent,  respectively,  by  the  year  2025  from  the  1999  levels.  Incremental  extraction  per  year  has  been  projected\naccordingly.\n\n\fD. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n26\n\n112.\nThe existence of a functioning water resources apex group, along with a mechanism to allow\nconsultation in water allocation, will provide the poorer segments of society with the forum needed to\nenunciate their water resource needs and to ensure that, to some extent, these needs are met.  In\nreal  terms,  both  the  rural  and  the  urban  poor  will  have  a  voice  in  determining  their  access  to  a\nresource essential to their physical and economic well-being and advancement.\n\n113. About  one  fifth  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  population  is  categorized  as  poor  on  the  basis  of  an  income\nthreshold of about SLRs720 or $10.1 per person per month. The income is still highly skewed, with\nthe bottom 20 percent of the income earners receiving less than 4 percent, while the top 20 percent\nreceive about 55 percent of the total income. While unemployment in the country is relatively high\n(8.5 percent in 1999), underemployment is more closely linked with poverty. The majority of the poor\nare working in low-productivity occupations in agriculture and fisheries, and 80 percent of them are\nto  be  found  in  the  rural  areas.  Poverty  is  prevalent  in  the  three  pilot  river  basins:  Menik  Ganga,\nDeduru Oya, and Attanagalu Oya. Since water-related problems are limiting the productivity of the\nrural dwellers, the Project is likely to have an indirect poverty reduction impact in providing water of\nadequate quality and a reliable supply, especially for small farmers.\n\n114.\nThe  Kelani  Conservation  Barrage  will  improve  water  supply  in  the  Greater  Colombo  area\nwhere  problems  of  supply  interruption  and  low  pressure  exist  mostly  in  areas  of  low-income\nhouseholds in the shantytowns and slums. The socioeconomic profiles of the benefited areas show\nthat almost half of the population are beneficiaries of the Government\u2019s Samurdhi Social Safety Net\nprogram, which targets people below the poverty line. Most of the residents rely on communal stand\nposts  for  water,  with  40-200  households  sharing  one  stand  post.  After  the  construction  of  the\nbarrage,  NWSDB  will  be  able  to  extend  and  enhance  the  water  supply  service  in  these  areas.\nCommunal  stand  posts  will  provide  more  reliable  supplies,  and  there  will  be  an  option  for  private\nconnections. Hence, the quality of life will be enhanced for some 330,000 beneficiaries, and almost\nhalf of them are below the poverty line. The barrage will particularly benefit the poorer women in the\ntarget area who walk and carry water from a distance ranging from 60 to 900 meters. In addition, the\nconstruction of the barrage and the low-flow weirs will create temporary employment for more than\n100 persons.\n\nE.\n\nRisks\n\n115.\nThe  greatest  potential  risk  for  the  Project  is  the  possibility  of  a  long  delay  in  establishing\nNWRA. This has been assessed, and safeguards have been put in place to ensure that NWRA is\nfully established and functioning effectively not later than the end of 2001. A major milestone in the\nprocess was achieved in March 2000 with Cabinet approval of the National Water Resources Policy\nand Institutional Arrangements. This is considered the first of two crucial steps in the process (the\nsecond  being  passage  of  the  legislation  in  Parliament).  That  approval  demonstrates  the\nGovernment\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  the  reform  process  and  will  substantially  reduce  the  risk  of\nmajor  delays  in  further  processing  of  the  legislation  needed  to  formally  establish  NWRA.  The  risk\nhas been further mitigated by providing a phased action plan with distinct milestones and a phased\nbuildup  of  WRS/NWRA  staff  in  line  with  the  project  activities.  There  is  also  the  risk  that  the\nlegislation  will  not  be  passed  by  Parliament.  However,  this  is  considered  unlikely,  since  a  process\ninitiated  in  1993  of  developing  participation,  ownership,  and  consensus  of  the  reform  package\namong all stakeholders has ensured that the related legislation is no longer politically sensitive.\n\n116.\nFor  implementation  activities,  the  risks  associated  with  the  Project  are  few.  Consulting\nservices  have  been  provided  in  critical  areas  of  project  coordination,  institutional  reform,  water\nlegislation,  basin  planning,  data  and  informatics,  and  finance  and  administration.  They  will  support\nthe  existing  and  newly  appointed  staff  of  WRS/NWRA  to  implement  project  activities  on  schedule.\n\n\fNWSDB has a good record as EA. In the area of financial management, improvements are already\nbeing comprehensively addressed (paras. 98-100).\n\n27\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nThe Government has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard assurances,\n\n117.\nwhich have been incorporated in the legal documents.\n\n(i) \n\nNWRA will be formally established and functioning not later than 31 December 2001.\nIn the event that it is not established by then, the Government acknowledges that the\nloan may be suspended.\n\n(ii) \n\nThe Cabinet will approve the draft National Water Resources Act by 31 May 2001.\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nCooperation  agreements,  acceptable  to  ADB,  between  the  WRS  and  the  three\nimplementing  agencies  (ID,  WRB,  and  NWSDB)  for  the  database  improvement\ncomponent of part A of the Project will be finalized by 31 May 2001.\n\nThe director general, three directors, and other staff recruited under the action plan in\nAppendix 3, will be permanently appointed to NWRA within three months of its formal\nestablishment. Subject to satisfactory performance, staff appointed to positions at the\nWRS will be appointed to equivalent positions at NWRA.\n\nThe  NWRA  Board  will  be  permanently  appointed  within  three  months  of  the\nestablishment  of  NWRA  and  the  interim  board  will  be  properly  constituted  until  that\ntime.\n\nNo project contracts will be awarded prior to the establishment of NWRA without prior\nADB  approval.  Provision  will  be  made  in  contracts  for  consulting  services,  where\nnecessary, for their automatic termination within 90 days if NWRA is not established\nby 31 December 2001.\n\n(vii) \n\nTraining  and  demonstration  proposals  will  be  prepared,  approved  by  ADB,  and\nimplemented in accordance with agreed-upon criteria. Following training, the staff will\nbe assigned to relevant project-related positions or tasks where possible.\n\n(viii)  The  Water  Resources  Council  will  establish  working  groups,  composed  of\nrepresentatives  of  the  relevant  departments  and  agencies,  not  later  than  31\nDecember 2001.\n\nFor consulting services and civil works in part B, Borrower-owned entities or entities\ncomprising a joint venture or a partnership between a private sector company and a\nBorrower-owned entity will not be eligible to bid for contracts.\n\nOnlending to NWSDB will be on the basis of a 50:50 mix of loan and grant where the\nloan will be for a term of 24 years with a grace period of 2 years and an interest rate\nof 12 percent per annum.\n\n(xi) \n\nThe PMU at NWSDB will be adequately staffed to undertake project implementation\nin accordance with the schedule.\n\n\f28\n\n(xii) \n\nEvery year, adequate annual budgetary provisions will be made for O&M costs under\nthe Project, which will be monitored by ADB.\n\n(xiii)  Plans  for  the  first  two  pilot  water  basins  (Menik  Ganga  and  Deduru  Oya),  including\nappropriate  guidelines  for  the  water  allocations  and  sharing  agreements,  will  have\nbeen prepared and approved by 31 December 2003.\n\n(xiv)  The  institutional  reform  and  strengthening  plan  for  ID  will  be  completed  by  31\n\nDecember 2003.\n\n(xv) \n\nIEEs will be undertaken for the low-flow weirs once their exact locations and designs\nare  known.  The  IEEs  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  No\nconstruction-related activities will be undertaken prior to notification from ADB that the\nIEEs have been approved.\n\n(xvi)  Resettlement  and  compensation  procedures  will  be  fully  implemented  on  a  timely\n\nbasis according to plans agreed upon with ADB.\n\nB.  \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness\n\n118.\n\nThe  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances  as  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness,\nwhich have been incorporated into the legal documents.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Water Resources Council will ratify the draft National Water Resources Act.\n\nThe interim NWRA board, the director general, and three directors to the WRS will be\nappointed according to the action plan in Appendix 3, and appropriate authority and\npowers  will  be  delegated  to  the  director  general  to  facilitate  advance  consultant\nselection and expedite implementation of part A of the Project.\n\nA manager will be appointed to the PMU within NWSDB with adequate technical and\nadministration experience and qualifications acceptable to ADB, to undertake part B\nof the project. Appropriate authority and powers will be delegated to him to expedite\nimplementation of the Project.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n119.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB\nand recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing\nRights  14,923,000  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Water  Resources\nManagement Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest\ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set\nforth in the draft

Resources Policy Foundation\n\n1.\nA  number  of  warning  signs  point  to  increasing  water  resource  problems  in  Sri  Lanka.\nCompetition  and  water  shortages  will  increase  as  a  result  of  a  highly  variable  rainfall  and  a\ngrowing  demand  for  water.  The  degradation  of  watersheds  is  resulting  in  sedimentation  of\nreservoirs and more serious floods and droughts.  Water pollution from domestic, agricultural, and\nindustrial  sources  is  contaminating  surface  water  and  groundwater  and  affecting  public  health.\nGroundwater  is  being  overextracted  in  some  areas,  affecting  its  availability  to  others  and  for\nenvironmental values.\n\n2.\nPolicy objective. The objective of water resources management is to ensure the use of\nwater  resources  in  an  effective,  efficient,  and  equitable  manner,  consistent  with  the  social,\neconomic, and environmental needs of present and future generations. Additional objectives are\nto\n\nfacilitate national development;\n\n(cid:1) \n(cid:1)  conserve scarce water resources and recognize their value;\n(cid:1)  ensure  equitable  sharing  of  water  resources  to  meet  current  and  future  demands  of\n\n(cid:1) \n\nthe population through an efficient allocation system;\nrecognize the national importance of water allocation to the irrigation sector in terms of\nsuch  things  as  the  amount  of  water  allocated,  number  of  users,  and  potential  for\nimproved water conservation;\n\n(cid:1)  ensure  the  flexibility  of  water  allocation  in  a  way  that  promotes  social  harmony  and\n\nindividual decision making;\n\n(cid:1)  safeguard  investments  in  water  resources  development  and  other  sectors  of  the\n\n(cid:1) \n\neconomy by providing water rights and entitlements;\nimprove standards in the maintenance of the safe quality of sources for various water\nuses; and\n\n(cid:1)  ensure  a  healthy  environment  and  sustainable  use  of  both  surface  water  and\ngroundwater resources through a comprehensive, river basin-oriented approach.\n\n3.\nScope and policy principles. The National Water Resources Policy applies to all fresh\nand  brackish  water  in  Sri  Lanka.  It  does  not  apply  to  marine  water.  All  surface  water  and\ngroundwater are owned by the State and managed by the government in partnership with water\nusers  on  behalf  of  all  Sri  Lankans.  Water  will  be  managed  in  a  sustainable  manner  while\nobserving  efficiency,  equity,  and  environmental  objectives.  Sri  Lanka  will  take  an  open  and\nparticipatory  approach  to  water  resources  management  and  will  base  decisions  on  strong  and\ncoordinated resource information.\n\nB.\n\nWater Rights and Allocation\n\n4.\nUntil  now  Sri  Lanka  has  not  had  a  formal  or  adequate  water  allocation  system.  To  a\ncertain  extent,  conflicts  have  been  resolved  through  interagency  agreement.  However,  the\nallocation mechanisms have failed to ensure water allocation that recognizes the rights of existing\nusers and flexibility to meet the needs of new users. Under the policy, water is allocated on the\n\n                                                          \na      This summary is a condensed version of the summary as it appears in the official policy document approved by the\n\nCabinet in March 2000.\n\n\f34\n\nAppendix 2, page 2\n\nbasis  of  agreed-upon  priorities,  and  in  accordance  with  principles  of  economic  efficiency.\nEnvironmental and small-scale social users will not suffer at the expense of larger, consumptive\nusers.\n\nEntitlements.  The  right  to  use  water  will  be  granted  through  water  entitlements.  Small-\n5.\nscale users and individual water users supplied through group schemes will be exempt from the\nrequirement to hold an entitlement. Entitlements will be granted for a fixed period of time, based\non  the  specific  water  use.  Water  user  compliance  with  the  terms  of  their  entitlements  will  be\nmonitored and enforced.\n\n6.\nEnvironmental and social water requirements. Minimum flows and storage volumes of\nwater will be specified to ensure a supply for environmental, social, and cultural water uses. The\nreservation will be made before water entitlements are issued.\n\n7.\nWater allocation priorities. Water will be reserved to protect small-scale water users, for\nother  social  and  cultural  purposes,  and  for  environmental  values.  Water  entitlements  will  be\nissued to existing water users and, to the extent that further water is available, to new applicants.\nDuring periods of drought, the first priority will be domestic use. Other water users will share the\navailable supply in proportion to their normal entitlements.\n\nTransfers. Voluntary transfers of water entitlements will be allowed between entitlements\n8.\nholders or from entitlement holders to those seeking to acquire water use rights. Transfers will be\nsubject  to  approval  under  approved  guidelines  so  as  to  protect  third  parties  and  environmental\nvalues.  Transfers will normally involve compensation paid by the new entitlement holder.\n\nC.\n\nDemand Management\n\nTransferable  water  entitlements.  Making  water  entitlements  transferable  will  promote\n\n9.\nwater conservation and improved water allocation.\n\n10. Water  management  cost  sharing.  Basin  water  resource  management  costs  will  be\nshared with water users in a transparent manner. The bases for cost sharing are the entitlement\nholder\u2019s quantity of water use, ability to pay, and the consumptive or nonconsumptive nature of\nthe holder\u2019s water use. Information on the value of water for different types of use will be reflected\nin the basin plans. The government will pay the current share of water management costs for the\nirrigation  sector  through  a  transparent  subsidy,  in  recognition  of  the  low  level  of  returns  in  this\nsector.  As  returns  for  irrigated  agriculture  grow  in  the  future  with  improved  irrigation  system\ncontrol and maintenance and more reliable water delivery, it is expected that the irrigation sector\nwill have a greater ability to share in the cost of water resource management.\n\n11.\nRegulatory  control,  water  saving,  and  education.  Water  entitlements  will  be  an\nimportant  tool  in  demand  management  since  unauthorized  water  use  will  be  controlled.\nEntitlements  may  also  contain  terms  and  conditions  regarding  water  conservation  measures,\nwhich  entitlement  holders  must  implement.  Water  conservation  agreements  may  also  be\ndeveloped to specify more general water conservation activities or those falling outside the scope\nof  water  entitlements.  Water-measuring  devices  will  be  required  as  a  condition  for  water\nentitlements.  Water-saving  technology  and  research  will  be  promoted.  Public  education  and\nawareness programs will be used to develop awareness of the value of water resources and of\nactivities  that  can  be  taken  to  conserve  water.  Water  resource  managers  will  be  trained  to\nimprove  water  use  efficiency  through  their  own  actions  and  in  cooperation  with  water  users.\nTechnical assistance on water conservation will be given to users on request.\n\n\f35\n\nAppendix 2, page 3\n\nD.\n\nGroundwater Management\n\n12.\nGroundwater  is  widely  used  for  domestic,  small-scale  irrigation,  industrial,  and  other\npurposes  in  Sri  Lanka.  There  are  many  types  of  shallow  and  deep  groundwater  aquifers;  each\nhas  its  own  characteristics  and  management  needs.  In  addition  to  providing  a  ready  source  of\nwater for consumptive purposes, shallow aquifers play an important role in discharging water to\nrivers  and  other  water  bodies  during  low  flow  periods.  They  also  support  wetlands  and  native\nvegetation.\n\n13.\nThe  major  groundwater  issues  relate  to  the  fact  that  groundwater  is  essentially  an\nunregulated resource. Ownership and management responsibilities for it are not clearly defined.\nAlthough  studies  have  been  conducted  and  well-drilling  data  collected,  there  have  been  no\nongoing  monitoring  and  coordinated  information  system  for  groundwater.  Intensive  urban,\nindustrial,  tourism,  and  other  developments  have  contributed  to  over-use  and  contamination  of\nsome aquifers. Subsidy programs to promote the development of shallow \u201cagro-wells\u201d have also\nresulted  in  heavy  use  of  shallow  groundwater  in  parts  of  North  Central  and  North  Western\nProvinces.\n\n14.\nThe  rate  of  groundwater  replenishment  and  other  distinctive  features  of  aquifers  will  be\ntaken into account in groundwater planning and management. Its management will take a long-\nterm  perspective.  Surface  water  and  groundwater,  particularly  in  shallow  aquifers,  are  closely\nrelated resources. They must therefore be managed in an integrated manner. All policies applied\nto  surface  water  will  also  apply  to  groundwater  management.  In  areas  where  there  are  special,\nurgent groundwater issues, planning and management of groundwater may go ahead without full\nriver  basin  planning.  Small  users  will  be  exempt  from  the  requirement  to  hold  entitlements,  but\nlocal  governments  will  be  encouraged  to  register  small  wells  and  to  apply  guidelines  on  well\ndensity in groundwater management areas. Information on groundwater and water conservation\nwill be disseminated to groundwater users.\n\nE.\n\nInformation Management\n\n15. Water  resources  data  and  information  are  needed  for  effective  water  resource\nmanagement.  The  essential  information  includes  policy  development  and  planning,  water\nmanagement operations, project planning, public awareness and education, and the investment\nplanning.  However,  the  data  and  the  current  information  system  are  inadequate  in  terms  of\nconsistent data standards, accuracy, and accessibility of data and information.\n\n16. Water resources data collected by national government agencies are the property of the\nstate. Data and information exchange and sharing will be ensured through a series of agreements\nbetween  data  collection  agencies  (custodian  agencies)  and  the  National  Water  Resources\nAuthority (NWRA). The agreements will specify data collection and management standards, data\nand information access and pricing and compilation of data sets by NWRA. In exchange for data\nfrom  the  custodian  agencies,  NWRA  will  undertake  a  coordinated  and  mutually  beneficial\napproach  to  strengthening  the  overall  data  and  information  system.  Overall  priorities  will  be\nidentified in a cooperative manner, and funds accumulated by NWRA through charges for water\ninformation  will  be  used  to  strengthen  the  capacities  of  the  custodian  agencies.  Cooperating\ncustodian agencies will have free access to data from NWRA. Data and information will be made\navailable  to  water  agencies  through  data  sharing  arrangements  and  to  the  public  through  both\nactive  awareness  and  educational  programs  and  in  response  to  requests.  Consistent  pricing  of\nwater data and processed water information will be encouraged.\n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 2, page 4\n\nF.\n\nInstitutional Structure for Water Resources Management\n\n17.\nA  new  and  permanent  National  Water  Resources  Authority,  a  permanent  Water\nResources  Council  (WRC),  and  a  Water  Resources  Tribunal  (WRT)  will  be  established  at  the\nnational  level.  These  bodies  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  water  resource\nmanagement and for a number of specified functions. The functions of NWRA will be to\n\n(cid:1)  prepare a national water resources policy;\n(cid:1)  undertake long-term national and river basin planning, including coordination of local\n\ninput;\n\n(cid:1)  coordinate the collection of water resource data and information management, water\n\nmonitoring and commissioning of research;\n\n(cid:1)  allocate water through the issuance of water entitlements;\n(cid:1)  advise the government regarding drought and flood management;\n(cid:1) \n(cid:1)  conduct public information and awareness campaigns.\n\nformulate a policy on and monitor riverine activities; and\n\n18.\nReporting relationship and structure. To make them effective in policy development, in\nwater resource planning and regulation, and in dispute resolution, NWRA, WRC, and WRT will be\nneutral  with  respect  to  sector  interests  and  will  have  a  strong  and  authoritative  position  in\ngovernment. These bodies will be parallel in terms of reporting directly to the chief executive of\nthe  government  (the  President  of  Sri  Lanka).  Together,  the  three  form  the  water  sector  apex\nbody.  As  such,  and  in  their  areas  of  responsibility,  they  will  be  considered  to  have  a  level  of\nauthority higher than that of other national water agencies.\n\n19.\nNWRA will report to a board, which will consist of seven members selected on the basis of\nclearly  specified  professional  qualifications  covering  a  range  of  water-related  specialities.  The\nchief  executive  of  NWRA  will  be  the  director  general.  Its  internal  divisions  are  expected  to  be\n(i) policy  and  planning,  (ii)  operations  (water  allocation,  riverine  control,  information),  and\n(iii) corporate  services  (administration  and  finance).  NWRA  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating,\nplanning,  regulating  and  monitoring  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  water  resources,  but  will  not  be  responsible  for\nplanning,  operating,  and  maintaining  infrastructure;  sectoral  water  delivery;  or  implementing\ncapital projects.\n\n20.\nDelegation  and  contracting  out.  NWRA  will  delegate  to,  or  work  in  partnership  with,\nvarious  national,  provincial,  and  other  government  agencies  in  carrying  out  technical  and\ndecentralized functions. Policy development will be the responsibility of NWRA, but an open and\nconsultative approach will be used. The technical aspects of national and river basin planning will\nbe largely delegated or undertaken in partnership with agencies with parallel responsibilities. Data\nand  information  will  be  managed  in  a  decentralized  system  in  which  NWRA  will  serve  as\ncoordinator. NWRA will establish and coordinate the proposed system of bulk water entitlements,\nwith appropriate responsibilities to the provincial, district, or divisional level and with appropriate\ncapacity  building  and  supervision.    Where  NWRA  lacks  technical  capacity  or  staff,  it  may  also\ncontract out tasks to other government agencies or private or nongovernment groups.\n\n21. Water  Resources  Council.  The  Water  Resources  Council  will  advise  the  Minister  of\nwater resource issues and on the resolution of interprovincial and interagency water disputes. It\nwill coordinate activities in water resource management at the national level and will review and\nendorse draft policies and national and river basin plans. The membership of WRC will consist of\nthe following:\n\n\f  37\n\nAppendix 2, page 5\n\n(cid:1)  seven  secretaries  of  national  ministries  responsible  for  subjects  such  as  water  supply,\nirrigation, agriculture, and hydropower and (on a rotational basis) the subjects of fisheries,\nlands,  plantations,  industry,  environment,  finance  and  planning,  provincial  councils,  and\nsocial issues such as health, education and poverty reduction;\n\n(cid:1)  heads  of  the  Irrigation  Department,  Mahaweli  Authority  of  Sri  Lanka  (MASL),  Ceylon\n\nElectricity Board, and National Water Supply and Drainage Board;\n\n(cid:1)  nine  nongovernment  representatives:  two  of  private  water  users,  two  of  farmer\norganizations, two of nongovernment organizations active in water resource management,\ntwo  of  academic  institutions  concerned  with  water  resources  (including  their  social\naspects), and one gender representative.\n\n22. Water  Resources  Tribunal.  The  Water  Resources  Tribunal  (WRT)  will  be  an\nindependent  appeal  tribunal  that  will  resolve  issues  relating  to  the  administration  of  water\nentitlements by NWRA. WRT will be responsible to the Minister for administrative purposes, but\nwill have statutory independence. Its judgments will be final, aside from appeal to the courts on\nmatters  of  law.  WRT  will  comprise  a  legally  trained  chairman  assisted  by  a  panel  of  technically\nqualified persons. Three or more members of the panel will be summoned on an ad hoc basis by\nthe  chairman  to  hear  appeals.  WRT  will  face  time  limits  on  rendering  decisions  and  will  have\nadministrative procedures designed to ensure its efficiency.\n\n23.\nRelationship of NWRA, WRC, and WRT to other national agencies. NWRA, WRC, and\nWRT  will  together  form  the  water  sector  apex  body  responsible  for  coordinating,  planning,\nregulating and monitoring national water resources and resolving disputes in the water sector. In\ntheir areas of responsibility, they will be considered to have a level of authority higher than that of\nother national water agencies. The other agencies will all be subject to the oversight and direction\nof NWRA, WRC, and WRT.\n\n24.\nProvincial  and  river  basin  water  resources  administration.  River  basin  and  major\naquifer  planning  will  be  coordinated  and  technically  supported  by  NWRA  and  partner  agencies.\nPriority river basins and aquifers will be identified for planning and management on the basis of\nissues  and  officially  declared  as  \u201cwater  management  areas\u201d  and\nwater  management \n\u201cgroundwater sensitive areas.\u201d\n\n25.\nRiver basin committees or groundwater committees will be established in declared areas.\nThe committees will be responsible for identifying water management issues and preparing terms\nof  reference  for  plans.  They  will  review  draft  plans  prepared  by  NWRA,  conduct  public\nconsultation  with  the  basin  or  aquifer  area,  recommend  changes  to  NWRA,  and  monitor  the\nimplementation  of  plans.  They  will  also  review  the  implementation  of  river  basin  plans  annually\nand  will  report  to  WRC.  River  basin  and  groundwater  committees  will  be  composed  of\nrepresentatives of national water resources agencies, provincial and other levels of government,\nand water users.\n\nMASL,  like  other  water  management  agencies,  will  be  subject  to  the  national  water\n26.\nresources policy and river basin plans approved by WRC and the government, and to guidance,\ncoordination,  and  dispute  resolution  by  NWRA,  WRC,  and  WRT.  NWRA  will  delegate\nresponsibilities  and  powers  to  MASL,  or  utilize  the  capabilities  of  MASL  through  partnership\narrangements.  Delegation of regulatory responsibilities will be subject to the clear separation of\nregulatory and water use functions within MASL.\n\n\f  38\n\nAppendix 3, page 1\n\nESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES AUTHORITY\n\nTable A3.1: Milestones in the Legal Establishment of\nNational Water Resources Authority\n\nEstimated\nTime\nRequired\n\nEstimated Date\n\nEarliest\n\nLatest\n\nOctober 1999\n\nMilestone\n\nProcess\n\nApproval of\nNational Water\nResources Policy\nby the Water\nResources\nCouncil (WRC)\n\nCabinet approval\nof Policy\n\nLaw drafted and\nratified by WRC\n\nConsultation on\ndraft Law\n\nCabinet approval\nto table law in\nParliament\n\nLaw tabled in\nParliament\n\nDebate and\npassage by\nParliament\nLaw becomes\neffective \u2013\nNWRA is\nofficially formed\n\nCompleted and\nsubmitted through the\nMinistry of Finance and\nPlanning for Cabinet\nconsideration\n\nCompleted, including\napproval to forward the\nPolicy to legal draftsman\n\nPolicy will be converted\nto legislation, based on\ndraft Water Resources\nAct already prepared.\nProcess will involve\ndrafting by legal\ndraftsman, constitutional\nreview, and translation.\n\nConsultation with\naffected ministries and\nother major\nstakeholders\nCabinet approves draft\nlegislation before being\ntabled in Parliament.\nMinistry comments will\nalready be incorporated.\nParliamentary agenda\nwill be considered\n(Parliamentary\nelections, timing of\ndebate on national\nbudget).

For  the  National  Water  Resources  Authority  (NWRA)  to  function\neffectively, it will need expertise and training in water resources planning and management and in\nthe  management,  duties,  and  operation  of  an  apex  water  authority,  not  just  for  its  personnel,  but\nalso  for  the  personnel  of  partner  agencies  and  the  local  government  departments  with  which\nNWRA is likely to work and interact.\n\nSome  of  the  training  needs  in  this  respect,  particularly  within  NWRA  itself,  will  be  readily\n2.\nidentifiable and it will be possible to formulate some part of a training program at the outset of loan\nimplementation  or  even  prior  to  commencement  of  the  Project.  However,  determining  and\nprioritizing  the  training  needs  of  eight  partner  agencies,  plus  local  government  agencies,  in  a\ndiscipline that is not as yet fully understood in Sri Lanka will be very difficult over a four- to five-year\ntime  horizon.  It  is  thus  desirable  to  have  a  maximum  amount  of  flexibility  within  the  training\nprogram to (i) allow training needs to be prioritized and addressed as and when they are identified,\nand (ii) to give agencies time to identify and formulate their training needs as their responsibilities\nbecome clear during the initial years of operation of NWRA.\n\n3.\nA demand-driven training component has been designed. It will allow each agency involved\nin  the  Project  to  bid  for  training  funds  through  a  series  of  training  proposals  prepared  with  the\nassistance  of  training  specialists  and  evaluated  on  technical  merit  by  a  neutral  body  of  experts.\nAppropriate  safeguards  and  monitoring  mechanisms  will  be  put  in  place  to  ensure  that  the  funds\nare  effectively  utilized  and  accounted  for.  The  scope,  cost  and  implementation  arrangements  for\nsuch a training program are in the following sections.\n\nB. \n\nScope and Cost\n\n4.\nThe training program will focus on building up long-term expertise in the agencies involved\nin  the  implementation  of  the  National  Water  Resources  Act.  It  will  require  expertise  in  water\nresource  inventory  and  assessment,  water  management  policy,  water  quality,  social  impact\nassessment,  social  mobilization,  interdisciplinary  coordination,  conflict  resolution  and  negotiation,\ncreation  of  public  awareness,  resources  management \nimpact\nassessment, the economics of resource management, planning skills, resource monitoring, and the\nmanagement of a water resource authority.\n\nlegislation,  environmental \n\nThe training program will take the form of a whole range of activities including\n\nshort-term  international  courses  at  relevant  institutes  for  junior  and  middle-level\npersonnel  of  NWRA  ,  its  partner  agencies,  and  selected  personnel  from  local\ngovernment agencies;\n\nsecondment  to  twinning  agencies  (primarily  water  resources  agencies  overseas,\nwhich are willing to take on and train candidates from Sri Lankan  water resources\nagencies);\n\n5.\n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii)\n\n\f44\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n \n\n(v) \n \n\nacademic training overseas and in-country, on-the-job training by international and\ndomestic experts, and especially formulated courses given locally;\n\nsupport  to  local  academic  institutions  to  orient  their  training  programs  toward\nsustainable, long-term training of water resource managers; and\n\nto  water  users  and\npublic  awareness  and  community  education \nstakeholders  to  enable  them  to  participate  more  effectively  in  enhanced  water\nmanagement activities.\n\ntargeted \n\nSome  training  in  areas  related  to  water  resource  management  is  already  offered  in  Sri\n6.\nLanka.  The  University  of  Moratuwa  has  initiated  a  postgraduate  engineering  program  in  water\nresource  management,  and  several  universities  offer  undergraduate  programs  in  water-related\ndisciplines.  However,  there  are  gaps  in  the  current  training  programs  and  the  major  need  \u2013\npractical  training  in  the  various  water  management  functions  \u2013  has  not  been  addressed.    The\nimportant  water  management  functions  have  been  identified  under  the  Western  River  Basin\nProject1 and agency responsibilities and partnerships have been outlined.  However, training needs\nhave not been assessed, nor has a plan for local and international training been developed. The\nWater  Resource  Management  Project  will  address  these  needs  and  implement  the  training\nactivities, while at the same time responding to emerging water resource management and related\ntraining needs.\n\nTraining  is  anticipated  to  take  place  in  two  waves.  At  the  inception  of  the  Project,  the\n7.\nimmediate  and  already  evident  training  needs  will  be  inventoried  and  suitable  training  proposals\nwill be prepared and funded. The proposals are likely to entail short- and medium-term academic\ntraining in-country and overseas. Then, as NWRA begins to operate and the pilot water resources\nmanagement studies get under way, new and more specific training requirements will be identified.\nThese  requirements  will  be  met  through  new  proposals,  which  are  envisaged  to  entail  a  greater\ndegree of secondment to twinning agencies and on-the-job training, and purpose-designed training\ncourses to meet specific needs.  This second wave of training will most likely take place in years 3\n- 5 of project implementation.\n\n8.\nConsultants will be recruited (i) to assist the participating agencies to identify and quantify\ntheir training needs, identify training opportunities, prepare training proposals; and (ii) to assist in\nmonitoring training effectiveness. There will be one international training specialist for 14 person-\nmonths and two domestic training specialists for a total of 36 person-months.\n\n9.\nIn addition to training, the program will include a range of demonstrations in water resource\nmanagement. These are intended to provide for small physical works that relate to implementation\nof basin plans in the pilot river basins, demonstrating how they can bring about improvements in\ncertain aspects of water management. Demonstration projects may cover the introduction of flow-\nmeasuring  structures  at  off-takes  to  demand  points  such  as  irrigation  schemes;  modification  to\nexisting  structures  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  water  use  or  calibration  of  flow  measurement;\nremoval  of  minor  structures  that  are  causing  constraints,  etc.  An  important  aim  of  these\ndemonstrations  will  be  to  develop  the  credibility  of  the  basin  plans  by  showing  stakeholders\nphysical improvements, rather than just a set of recommendations in a report.\n\n10.\nThe demonstrations are envisaged to be limited to minor physical works valued at not more\nthan about $50,000, and generally much less. They would be identified in the course of the Project,\nand  it  is  not  possible  to  accurately  predict  their  exact  nature.  An  international  river  basin  planner\n                                                     \n1 \n\nTA 3030-SRI: Western River Basins Sector Project, for $1.5 million, approved on 11 June 1998.\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 6, page 3\n\nwill  assist  to  identify  appropriate  demonstrations,  which  will  then  be  subject  to  vetting  and\nevaluation under the same process as the training proposals.\n\n11.\nIt has been estimated that a meaningful and effective training and demonstration program\ncan be undertaken at a cost of $4.5 million. This cost estimate is based on an indicative training\nprogram as shown in Table A6 below.\n\nTable A6: Cost Estimates for an Indicative Training and Demonstration Program\n\nDescription\n1.

Each  participating  agency  will\nassess  its  own  needs  and  prepare  proposals  with  the  assistance  of  the  consultants.  A  technical\ncommittee  comprising  four  senior  officers  selected  on  a  rotational  basis  from  among  the  eight\npartner agencies, plus one officer from NWRA, will then evaluate the proposals. The proposals will\nmeet the selection criteria (para. 17) and be presented in a consistent format. Once approved by\nthe technical committee, final approval will be by the NWRA board or another appropriate approval\ncommittee.\n\n13.\nTo ensure timely implementation of the program, the approval period will be limited to one\nmonth  after  proposal  submission,  after  which  period  a  written  letter  will  be  sent  to  the  applying\nagency to explain why its proposal has not yet been approved or disapproved.\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 6, page 4\n\n14.\nAny  agency  receiving  funds  will  be  required  to  administer  them  in  a  responsible  manner.\nThis will involve full financial reporting and accounting at the end of the implementation period as\nwell  as  the  submission  of  a  report  upon  completion.  Noncompliance  with  the  financial  monitoring\nand  reporting  requirements  will  be  grounds  for  disapproval  of  future  proposal  submissions.\nCompliance will be monitored periodically by the consultants and reported to the Water Resources\nCouncil and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).\n\nD.\n\nTwinning Arrangements\n\n15.\nIt is anticipated that some of the project training activities will be implemented through the\nmodality  of  a  long-term  twinning  relationship  between  NWRA  and  a  parallel  agency  in  another\ncountry.  The  objective  of  this  relationship  will  be  to  provide  access  to  very  practical,  applied\ntraining  and  advisory  services  that  cannot  be  located  through  normal  academic  or  commercial\nconsulting channels. Water resource management involves a number of specialized planning and\nadministrative  responsibilities,  with  accompanying  legal  and  public  administration  aspects  (for\nexample,  implementation  of  a  water  licensing  and  allocation  system).  Therefore,  a  parallel\noperational water management agency, which also has the capability to provide on-the-job training\nand consulting support, should be identified and arrangements developed to access these services\nfor the benefit of NWRA and its partners.\n\n16.\nNWRA,  with  the  support  of  the  training  consultants,  will  be  responsible  for  identifying\nsuitable  foreign  water  management  agencies  and  the  training  and  advisory  services  that  can  be\nprovided  through  a  twinning  relationship.  NWRA  will  also  develop  an  agreement,  to  be  approved\nby the Government and ADB, for the provision of services under the twinning arrangements over\nthe course of the project.\n\nE.\n\nSelection Criteria\n\n17.\nthe following criteria.\n\nIn  assessing  and  prioritizing  the  training  proposals,  the  technical  committee  will  consider\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(v)\n\n(vi)\n\nTo limit the training proposals to a manageable number, the minimal proposal size\nwill be $50,000 (this will mean a maximum of about 100 proposals over the project\nperiod.).  Pilot  demonstrations  should  normally  cost  less  than  $50,000  each  since\nthey are not meant for sizable infrastructure work.\n\nGovernment officers who are candidates for training should normally be permanent\nstaff  and  selected  in  accordance  with  Government  guidelines,  including  the  age\nlimits set in the guidelines. Other participants (community representatives, etc.) will\nbe eligible provided they are directly associated with the Project.\n\n(iii)\n\nAs  much  as  possible,  a  balance  will  be  maintained  in  the  amount  of  funding\nprovided to each participating agency.\n\n(iv)\n\nPreference in training will be given to middle- and junior-level officers.\n\nThe training program must be well-defined, targeting specific task requirements, and\nnot of a general nature, e.g., candidates to be sent for training must be assigned to\ndesignated, legitimate courses, not just to an institution.\n\nStudy tours must be designed and supervised by a legitimate training, development,\nor water management agency.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 6, page 5\n\nAll  proposals  must  be  directly  related  to  water  resources  management,  and  the\ntraining should be at a recognized institution.\n\nThe expertise developed during training should, as much as possible, be of a nature\nthat can be utilized for further project implementation once the training is completed.\n\nCandidates for training should have a direct link with the project or with NWRA and\nits work.\n\nTraining proposals should aim to have at least about 25 percent women candidates.\nProposals  related  to  activities  that  will  further  women's  concerns  will  receive\nadditional favorable consideration.\n\nGovernment  staff  will  be  required  to  remain  in  the  positions  for  which  they  are\ntrained  for  a  minimum  time  after  the  training,  according  to  arrangements  to  be\ndecided by the Government.\n\nF. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n18.\nTraining  is  a  critical  part  of  the  reform  process  in  the  water  resource  sector  and  its\neffectiveness  should  be  optimized.  As  much  as  possible,  training  should  be  in  skills  and\ninformation  directly  applicable  to  water  resource  management  activities  and  to  implementation  of\nthe  government\u2019s  water  resource  policy  through  approved  institutional  arrangements.  Loss  of\nbenefits through poor design of training activities or poor utilization of trained personnel should be\navoided.  It  will  therefore  be  necessary  to  design  and  implement  a  training  monitoring  and\nevaluation  program  as  part  of  the  overall  training  initiative.  NWRA  and  the  training  consultants\nshould undertake the development of this monitoring and evaluation program jointly. The results of\nthe  evaluation  should  be  reported  to  the  Water  Resources  Council  and  to  ADB.  The  following\nindicators are recommended, with additional ones to be developed during the early stages of the\nproject:\n\nSelection  of  trainees.  Has  selection  of  trainees  been  based  on  clear  and  well-\nfounded criteria? Is the training activity based on an approved response to a training\nneeds assessment?\n\nSelection and design of training activity. Have training opportunities and modalities\nbeen  adequately  surveyed?  Where  appropriate,  has  training  been  suitably  tailored\nto trainee needs?\n\nIncentives/opportunities  provided  for  trainees  to  implement  results.  Was  a  plan\nprepared  before  training  for  utilization  of  the  training  results?  Are  adequate\nincentives  and  opportunities  given  to  trainees  to  implement  their  new  skills  and\nknowledge? What training results have been implemented?\n\nEvaluation  of  training  benefits  by  trainees  and  their  agencies.  Have  trainees  and\ntheir  agencies  evaluated  the  training  benefits?  Have  these  evaluations  been\nforwarded as appropriate?\n\n(vii)\n\n(viii)\n\n(ix)\n\n(x)\n\n(xi) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n\fPart A.  Institutional Development\n\n2.

It will\nbe  implemented  in  two  parts.  Part  A  will  support  the  implementation  of  policy  and  institutional\nreforms that the Government has recently approved, which include setting up a new apex body, the\nNational Water Resource Authority (NWRA). Capacity will be build in the NWRA to undertake its day\nto day operations and fulfil its mandate of managing the country\u2019s water resources. This will include\nestablishing  linkages  with  other  relevant  agencies  in  the  water  sector.  This  will  be  done  through\npractical exercises to resolve existing conflicts in three pilot river basins (para 6), thus demonstrating\nprocedures  for  integrated  river  basin  management.  Part  B  will  construct  infrastructure  to  improve\nwater resource management. The major component will be the Kelani Conservation Barrage to be\nlocated in the lower reaches of the Kelani Ganga. It is designed to protect against disruptions to the\nwater  supply  for  Greater  Colombo  by  preventing  saline  intrusions  to  the  intakes  and  maintaining\nacceptable levels in the river to avoid pumping operations being interrupted. A smaller component of\npart  B  will  the  installation  of  low-flow  weirs  at  various  points  along  the  main  rivers  to  facilitate\naccurate measurement of low flows needed by NWRA for proper management of water allocations,\nas well as water quality parameters.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n3.\nThe SIEE places emphasis on the Kelani Ganga, the site of the Project\u2019s major infrastructure\ncomponent. It is the third largest watershed in Sri Lanka and plays an important role with respect to\nthe country\u2019s overall economy, since it drains the most fertile land in the wet zone and intercepts the\nmost populated and economically important part of the country including the capital Colombo. Flows\nin Kelani Ganga vary widely, according to the season. Annual flood discharges are typically in the\nrange of 800-1500 cubic meters (m3) per second. Dry season flows are dominated by hydroelectric\npower releases from two reservoirs located near the headwaters of the river. The 1-in-50 year low-\nflow in the lower reaches is estimated to average less than 10 m3 per second over a 7-day period.\n\n4.\nThe water supply intake for Greater Colombo is located at Ambatale, 15 km from the mouth\nof  the  Kelani  Ganga.  Although  tidal  amplitudes  at  the  mouth  are  low  (0.8  metres  at  spring  tide),\nunacceptably  high  salinity  has  been  detected  at  the  intake.  The  situation  becomes  most  critical\nduring the dry season months (January to March). In 1992, a prolonged drought meant that regular\nreleases  from  the  reservoirs  could  not  be  maintained,  and  salinity  levels  at  the  intake  reached\nunacceptable levels. A temporary sandbag barrier had to be constructed downstream of the intake\nto relieve the situation. Excessive sand mining has also reduced the normal river levels causing the\nintake  pumps  for  the  water  supply  to  operate  well  below  optimum  range,  with  total  shut  down\nrequired at times. Although water quality at Ambatale is still well within the standards specified for\ndrinking water with conventional treatment, data shows a trend of increasing pollutant levels over the\nlast two decades. These problems will require a comprehensive and long-term solution.\n\n5.\nFishing in the Kelani Ganga is not a major economic activity of the people living adjacent to\nthe  river.  About  20\u201325  families  fish  as  a  full  time  income-generating  activity  during  the  first  six\nmonths  of  the  year  in  the  river  estuary.  No  fish  species  that  move  up  the  river  for  spawning  are\nfound  in  the  Kelani  Ganga,  although  the  giant  fresh  water  prawn  (Macrobrachium rosenbergii)\n\n\f62\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nmoves downstream into brackish water for spawning. The spawning season for this species is from\nJune  to  August  (with  peak  spawning  activity  within  the  two  first  months)  with  some  low  intensity\nspawning activity in November and December.\n\nThe three pilot river basins that will be targeted under the Project (the Menik Ganga, Deduru\n6.\nOya,  and  Attanagalu  Oya)  are  medium-sized  basins.  All  these  rivers  are  the  main  source  of\ndomestic  water  supply  for  the  basins\u2019  population  and  support  major  economic  activities  such  as\nagriculture,  industry,  wildlife  reserves,  and  tourism.  In  the  Menik  Ganga,  there  is  a  major  religious\nand  cultural  site  that  relies  on  river  flows  during  August  each  year,  a  low-flow  period  in  the  river,\nwhen large numbers of tourists come to bathe in the river. All these basins are experiencing stress\non  the  available  water  resources  due  to  uncontrolled  and  competing  uses.  Comprehensive\nmanagement plans are required in each of these basins to resolve the issues.\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n1.\n\nKelani Conservation Barrage\n\nImpacts during the construction stage will largely be temporary in nature. These impacts and\n\n7.\nthe related mitigation measures apply to the following:\n\n(i)\n\nWater  quality.  Downstream  water  quality  may  be  somewhat  affected  by  additional\npollution directly from the site, such as from excavation. However, the overall load of transportable\nsolids is not likely to increase significantly as a result of the works. Other sources of potential water\nquality  problems  could  arise  from  washing  of  vehicles,  equipment,  and  general  cleaning  of  hard\nsurfaces; the use of chemicals, fuels, and other hazardous materials or toxic liquids; and runoff from\nimproperly controlled latrines, pits, and so on.\n\n8.\nThe implementation of best practices for site management and monitoring is the single most\nimportant form of mitigation of negative impacts during the construction phase, and would address\npotential  water  quality  impacts  in  particular.  The  siting  and  control  of  supplies  of  sand,  aggregate,\nand  other  materials  will  be  properly  managed.  All  piles  and  stores  will  be  located  well  clear  of  the\nriver. Wastewater will be treated prior to disposal. Hazardous wastes such as fuels will be stored in\nproper containers and the containers within bunkered enclosures. On completion of the works, the\ncontractor\u2019s  site  will  be  leveled  and  rehabilitated.  To  ensure  that  the  contractor  complies  with\nstandard best practices, payments will be keyed to the proper implementation of these practices in\nthe contract documents.\n\n(ii)\n\nFisheries and other biological resources. The biological/ecological aspects of the\n\nproject area are not expected to change in any significant way from the without-project situation\n\n(iii)\n\nHealth and safety. No significant impacts due to the presence of the workforce are\nenvisaged. The movement of heavy vehicles during construction may cause some traffic nuisance.\nSimilarly, there will be noise nuisance from the construction site. Worker health and safety could be\naffected  if  standard  practices  are  not  followed.  The  workforce  will  be  small,  and  many  unskilled\npositions will be filled by local people.\n\n9.\nStandard mitigation measures will be employed to minimize or avoid potential impacts. The\ncontractor\u2019s labor force will be required to maintain safe speeds. Noise-generating equipment will be\nfitted with mufflers and other sound insulation devices. Working hours will be set so as to minimize\nor avoid noise disturbance during evenings. The contractor will prepare and implement a health and\nsafety plan.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\n(iv)\n\nSite  access.  A  new,  small  road  spur  will  be  required  on  the  right  bank  to  allow\nvehicles  direct  access  to  the  site.  This  may  involve  minor  compensation  requirements  (see  [v]).  In\naddition  to  the  safety  requirements  earlier  noted,  road  construction  will  employ  best  practices  to\navoid erosion and drainage problems.\n\n(v)\n\nResettlement  and  compensation.  Resettlement  and  compensation  requirements\nwill  be  small.  The  major  construction  lay-down  area  will  be  within  the  existing  compound  of  the\nNational Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) on the left bank. A smaller area of less than\none half of a hectare will be required on the right bank, and will involve temporary acquisition of land\nand  other  assets,  including  minor  losses  of  coconut,  banana,  and  cassava.  Approximately  5-7\nhouseholds will be affected, but no permanent relocation is expected. Procedures for compensation\nhave been identified and described in a separate, brief resettlement plan.\n\nImpacts and mitigation measures during the implementation stage are expected to cover the\n\n10.\nfollowing:\n\n(i)\n\nWater quality. Implementation and operation of the barrage will not pose a problem\nto  the  intake  water  quality  from  the  impoundment  for  low-flows  with  a  return  period  of  10  years  or\nless.  However,  in  extreme  low-flow  events,  there  may  be  a  risk  to  the  intake  water  quality  due  to\nconcentration  of  pollutants,  and  the  \u2018first  flush\u2019  condition  after  an  extended  period  of  low  flow  may\ntemporarily  pollute  the  immediate  downstream  stretches  of  the  river.  Low-flow  retention  by  the\nbarrage  will  mean  that  downstream  of  Ambatale,  dilution  and  dispersion  of  pollutants  will  be  more\ndependent on tidal movement, and the influence of the river flow will be reduced. Longer retention\ntimes in the estuary may permit bio-accumulation of toxins to a somewhat greater extent than may\nexist  at  present.  To  prevent  and/or  mitigate  these  impacts,  water  quality  will  be  monitored  at  the\nbarrage. In addition, a low-flow weir will be constructed upstream to monitor stream flows, which will\nserve as a kind of early warning system of impending water quality problems. If it is determined that\nproblems  with  the  water  quality  may  be  emerging,  during  these  extreme  cases,  there  are  two\nmanagement  options:  (a)  increased  water  releases  from  the  upstream  reservoirs,  or  (b)  lower  the\ninflatable top of the barrage for short periods to flush out high concentrations of pollutants.\n\n(ii)\n\nFisheries.  In  considering  the  overall  ecology  of  the  river,  no  major  changes  in  the\nbenthic populations are expected, except in the immediate vicinity of the barrage. Under normal low-\nflow conditions (with a continuous spill over the crest), evidence considered during IEE preparation\nand  follow-up  interviews  with  fisheries  experts  suggest  that  fish  migration  would  not  be  adversely\naffected because migration generally occurs during times when the weir will be submerged. It is not\nlikely that any downstream migration of the giant freshwater prawn will be hindered and so affect the\nspawning  activity  of  this  species,  as  the  barrier  will  be  in  operation  only  during  the  dry  period  of\nJanuary-March, which is outside the spawning season.\n\n(iii)\n\nTransportation.  The  free  movement  of  sand  barges  and  logging  rafts  will  be\nrestricted  to  some  extent  by  the  barrier  when  in  operation.  The  design  of  the  inflatable  barrier\ninvolves  a  sluice  gate  of  a  width  of  10  meters  that  can  be  operated  to  allow  river  crafts  to  go\ndownstream when the rubber dam is inflated during the dry period. Adverse impacts may therefore\nbe restricted to additional waiting time that may have to occur during low flows (coinciding with daily\nsupply  pumping  times),  and  to  possible  longer  delays  during  very  low  flows  when  lowering  of  the\nsluice gate may be more restricted. Access to one or more of the existing sand-mining landing sites\nmay be affected, and alternative sites may need to be located.\n\n(iv)\n\nOthers. The main solids transport in the river occurs during the wet season with high\nflows.  Under  these  circumstances  it  is  not  expected  that  the  downstream  river  transport  will  be\naffected. Some deposition may initially occur along the upstream barrage sill, but most solids will be\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\ntransported  with  the  spill  flow.  During  low  flows,  an  increase  in  elevation  of  about  1  meter  can  be\nexpected in the upstream water level of the river, resulting in slightly raised groundwater levels in the\nriparian  areas.  This  is  not  expected  to  cause  any  significant  negative  impacts  on  human  activities\nnear the river.\n\n2.\n\nLow-Flow Weirs\n\n11.\nThe precise locations and designs of the low-flow weirs are not known at this time. However,\nan assessment was made of one possible location above the proposed Kelani barrage. The impacts\nare  expected  to  be  similar  to,  but  smaller  in  scale  and  magnitude  than,  those  described  for  the\nKelani barrage. The weirs will be built to measure low flows, and so will be of low profile and minimal\nimpact. Provision has been made in the Project for the recruitment of an environment specialist and\nsociologist/public  participation  specialist  to  undertake  IEEs  for  the  weirs  once  their  location  and\ndesign are known. The IEEs will be submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for review and\napproval prior to the initiation of any construction activities.\n\n3.\n\nInstitutional Development\n\nThis  will  involve  capacity  building  assistance  to  improve  the  sustainable  management  of\n\n12.\nwater resources. Therefore, impacts of this component are expected to be positive.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\n13.\nNWSDB will be the Executing Agency for the Kelani Conservation Barrage, and the Irrigation\nDepartment will be the Implementing Agency for the low-flow weirs. A resident engineer will control\nand supervise the construction at each site, seeing to it that environmental conditions are complied\nwith.  Necessary  environmental  monitoring  activities  will  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  resident\nengineer\u2019s  responsibilities.  NWSDB  and  Irrigation  Department  units  that  are  currently  undertaking\nroutine water quality surveys will carry out environmental monitoring during the operation phase.\n\n14.\nAn environmental specialist will be tasked with preparing clauses in the tender documents for\nthe civil engineers, reflecting the recommendations made in the IEE and subsequent assessments.\nThese  will  clearly  specify  the  contractor\u2019s  environmental  management  responsibilities,  including\npreparation of an environmental management plan and health and safety plan to be approved by the\nresident  engineer.  Coordination  with  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  will  be  initiated  and\nmaintained.\n\nMajor  monitoring  activities  will  cover  (i)  implementation  of  health  and  safety  measures,\n\n15.\n(ii) water quality, and (iii) erosion.\n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n16.\nThe  most  significant  potential  impacts  will  be  associated  with  part  B  of  the  Project,  and\nspecifically  with  construction  and  operation  of  the  Kelani  barrage.  They  include  potential  water\nquality  impacts  from  excavation  during  river  profiling  and  operation  at  the  work  site,  and  possible\npolluted  conditions  in  the  vicinity  of  the  barrage  during  extreme  low  flows.  These  impacts  will  be\navoided or adequately mitigated by following standard best practices for construction and operation\nof the barrage.\n\n17.\nResettlement will be mostly temporary and compensation requirements small. Approximately\n5-7  households  are expected to be affected. No relocation of households is expected. Procedures\nfor compensation have been identified and described.\n\n\f 65\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\nMajor  impacts  on  the  overall  ecology  of  the  river  are  not  expected.  The  barrage  is  not\n\n18.\nexpected to impede the migration of fish because it will be submerged during migratory events.\n\nThe  movement  of  river  traffic  will  be  accommodated  through  the  design  of  the  inflatable\n19.\nbarrier,  which  has  a  sluice  gate  that  can  be  operated  to  allow  passage  by  river  craft.  Minor\ninconveniences may be experienced during periods of extremely low flow.\n\nImpacts and mitigation measures related to the low-flow weirs are expected to be similar to\n20.\nthose identified for the Kelani barrage, but of smaller scope and magnitude. Part B, which involves\ncapacity building activities, is expected to result in positive impacts.\n\nAdequate  provisions  have  been  made  in  the  project  budget  to  cover  all  environmental\n\n21.\nmitigation costs and costs of compensation.\n\nG.\n\nConclusions\n\n22.\nOverall, the Project is expected to be environmentally beneficial, especially as concerns the\ncapacity  building  component  for  water  resources  management  and  the  low-flow  weirs,  which  will\nprovide  for  more  rational  allocation  of  water  and  for  water  quality  monitoring.  No  major\nenvironmental,  occupational,  health,  safety,  or  socioeconomic  impacts  are  expected  to  occur.  The\nrequired  mitigation  measures  are  well  known  and  available,  and  will  largely  depend  on\nimplementation of standard best practices.\n\nThe  locations  and  designs  of  the  low-flow  weirs  are  not  yet  known.  Assessment  of  one\n23.\npossible  site  indicated  that  there  would  be  no  major  impacts.  Rather  the  impacts  and  mitigation\nmeasures  will  be similar in nature to, but smaller and of less magnitude than, those for the Kelani\nbarrage.  Provision  has  been  made  under  the  Project  for  environmental  assessment  of  the\nmultipurpose weirs once the locations and designs are known, and for securing approval from ADB\nbefore construction begins.\n\n24. With the exception of the additional IEE work to be carried out for the low-flow weirs, the IEE\nfor the Project is considered to represent the full environmental impact assessment.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\n\nA. \n\nIntroduction\n\nThe proposed Project is designed to assist the Government to establish and strengthen\n1. \nthe  institutions  needed  for  effective  water  resource  management  in  the  country,  as  well  as  to\naddress,  through  the  provision  of  urgently  needed  infrastructure,  some  consequences  of  the\nlack of adequate water resource management in the past. The economic and financial analyses\nwere  done for only  one  component  of the Project, the Kelani Conservation Barrage, as this is\nthe  only  component  that  results  in  directly  productive  and  measurable  benefits.  Other\ncomponents  have  the  overall  objective  of  building  capacity  for  integrated  water  resource\nmanagement,  and  will  have  longer  term  impacts  by  establishing  the  enabling  environment  for\nfuture sector investments.\n\nThe  main  aims  of  the  Kelani  Conservation  Barrage  proposed  to  be  constructed  at\n\n2. \nAmbatale on the Kelani River are to\n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\n(iii) \n \n\n(iv) \n \n\n(v) \n \n\nimprove the discharge and energy efficiency of the existing pumping facilities at the\nAmbatale intake by raising the river level, thereby significantly increasing the quantity\nof water that can be extracted during the dry season;\n\nensure  that  saline  water  due  to  tidal  effects  does  not  enter  the  water  intake  at\nAmbatale;\n\nconserve  existing  water  resources  in  the  basin  by  eliminating  the  need  for\nunscheduled  releases  from  an  upstream  reservoir,  a  practice  currently  adopted  on\noccasions to drive out saline water and raise water levels to avoid pump shutdowns;\n\nprovide improved sediment exclusion and desilting to protect against the buildup of\nsand at the existing Ambatale intake; and\n\nsatisfy the future demand for potable water in the Greater Colombo area in a cost-\neffective and sustainable manner, with particular regard to the poor and low-income\nhouseholds in central Colombo and northern towns in the area.\n\n3. \nThe  proposed  barrage  aims  to  improve  the  management  of  water  resources  of  the\nKelani  River.  Therefore,  the  major  benefits  are  derived  from  restoring  the  capacity  of  the\nAmbatale water supply intake to the original design and providing the opportunity to expand its\ncapacity  in  the  future.  The  barrage  provides  a  cost-effective  solution  to  satisfy  the  immediate\nand urgent demand for additional potable water in the Greater Colombo area, and will contribute\nto  future  demand  needs.  Keeping  this  in  view,  the  economic  and  financial  analyses  seek  to\njustify the investment in terms of its potential impact on the overall present and future operations\nof the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) in augmenting the water supply.\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  these  objectives,  the  economic  analysis  has  focused  on  the\n4. \ncomparison between the with- and without-Project cases. Alternatives to augmenting the water\nsupply  for  the  Greater  Colombo  area  using  other  sources  were  considered.  Groundwater  is\nalready  exploited  to  some  extent,  but  is  considered  to  have  limited  potential  for  further\ndevelopment,  particularly  due  to  problems  with  its  quality.  The  most  practical  alternative,  and\nthe  one  considered  in  the  analysis  (para.  8),  is  extraction  of  raw  water  from  the  Kalu  River.\nAnother  alternative  was  provision  of  further  upstream  storage.  However,  investigation  and\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nimplementation of this project would be a long-term undertaking. Because the lead time for this\nis too long in view of the current urgency to supply additional water, it was not been considered\nas a realistic alternative.\n\nB. \n\nProject Costs and Benefits\n\n1. \n\nCosts\n\n5. \nAt January 2000 prices, the costs of constructing the Kelani Conservation Barrage were\nestimated in terms of capital costs, replacement capital costs over the life of the barrage, and\nannual  operating  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs.  The  capital  replacement  costs  relate  to  the\nperiodic  replacement  of  inflating  equipment  for  the  rubber  barrier  (15  years),  miscellaneous\nequipment including gates and screens (20 years), and the rubber barrier itself (30 years).\n\n6. \nShadow factors of 1.0 for skilled labor, 0.7 for unskilled labor, and 1.1 for electricity were\nused  to  convert  financial  values  into  economic  values.  Conversion  factors  were  not  applied  to\ntradable  goods.  Other  financial  costs  were  converted  to  economic  costs  using  a  standard\nconversion  factor  of  0.94,  computed  from  10  years  data  of  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka.\nEconomic costs were computed from constant 2000 prices.\n\n2. \n\nQuantified Benefits\n\nThe  main  benefits  attributable  to  the  construction  of  the  Kelani  Conservation  Barrage\n\n7. \nwere evaluated in terms of cost savings\n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\nfrom providing equivalent raw water volumes from an alternative source (the Kalu\nRiver) in the dry season;\n\naccruing from improved efficiency of the existing pumping facilities due to higher river\nlevels at Ambatale in the dry season; and\n\n(iii) \n \n\nfrom lower raw water extraction losses at Ambatale in the dry season.\n\nIn the economic analysis, the value of the additional water extraction offered by Kelani\n8. \nConservation  Barrage  was  measured  in  terms  of  the  costs  saved  by  not  having  to  extract\nequivalent  volumes  of  raw  water  for  the  Greater  Colombo  area  from  the  next  most  practical\nalternative.  As  noted,  the  only  reliable  alternative  source  of  appropriate  size  that  could  be\ntapped within the time frame required is transbasin transfers from the Kalu River, the adjacent\nriver  basin  to  the  south.  Three  potential  alternative  scenarios  (low,  medium,  and  high1)  were\nconsidered  for  future  incremental  raw  water  extraction  at  Ambatale.  The  results  of  modeling\nshow that in all three scenarios, the dry season demand deficits begin to rise significantly from\n2005  onward,  and  become  substantial  between  2015  and  2025  without  the  Project.  The\neconomic value of the incremental raw water extracted from the Kelani River with the Project is\nequivalent  to  the  economic  cost  of  conveying  that  water  from  the  Kalu  River  to  Ambatale  for\ntreatment  and  distribution  to  Colombo  North.    In  the  medium-demand  scenario,  the  capital\ninvestment  required  is  estimated  at  $18.4  million,  with  annual  O&M  costs  rising  from  about\n$57,000 in 2010 to $76,000 in 2025.\n\n                                                \n1 \n\nIn the three scenarios, total raw water extraction is projected to increase by 40, 57, and 75 percent, respectively,\nfrom  the  1999  levels  by  the  year  2025.    Incremental  extraction  per  year  has  been  projected  accordingly.    The\nmedium-demand scenario is considered the most likely.\n\n\f 68\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\n9. \nThe  construction  of  the  Kelani  Conservation  Barrage  will  raise  average  water  levels  at\nthe  existing  Ambatale  intakes  by  an  average  of  one  meter  in  the  dry  season  from  January  to\nApril  each  year.  This  will  generate  savings  in  energy  costs  ($22,000  per  year  from  2005\nonward). There will also be savings in pump maintenance costs ($15,000 per year) attributable\nto reduced pumping head and less sand entering the intakes.\n\nRaw water extraction losses were estimated to be 350,000 cubic meters (m3) per year,\n10. \nbased on NWSDB\u2019s records (1996-1997)2 of the number of times and duration when the intake\npumps  tripped  due  to  low  water  levels.  The  losses  are  projected  to  increase  to  430,000  m3  in\n2001 and 560,000 m3 by 2005. Using the present average water tariff of SLRs13.40 per m3 as a\nreflection of the economic cost, the resulting loss would rise from $66,000 to $81,000 by 2001\nand $106,000 by 2005.\n\n3. \n\nNonquantified Benefits\n\nThe  economic  evaluation  is  further  supported  by  an  assessment  of  a  number  of  non-\n\n11. \nquantified factors, which have a positive impact on the investment decision. These are\n\n (i) \n\n(ii) \n \n\n(iii) \n \n\n(iv) \n \n\nsocial benefits in terms of more cost-effective supplies of potable water to the\ncommunities north of the Kelani River within the Greater Colombo area;\n\nprotection  of  Colombo\u2019s  major  source  of  potable  water  from  the  possibility  of\nfuture  saline  intrusion  in  the  dry  season,  which  could  potentially  disrupt  the\ncapital\u2019s water supplies;\n\nimproved  water  resource  management  for  the  Kelani  River  in  terms  of  more\neffective  water  allocation  between  potable  water  supplies  for  Colombo  and\nhydropower  utilization  in  the  upper  catchment,  by  eliminating  the  need  for\nunscheduled  releases  from  a  hydropower  reservoir  to  push  back  the  saline\nwedge; and\n\navoidance of the economic disruption and environmental problems that would be\ncaused  in  the  without-Project  case  by  the  construction  of  the  raw  water  main\npipeline  from  the  alternative  source,  the  Kalu  River.  The  potential  disruption  of\nroad traffic on the suburban roads between the Kalu the Kelani rivers would have\na direct adverse impact on the social, economic, and commercial life of important\nareas of Colombo.\n\nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n12. \nThe results of the economic analysis are presented in terms of (i) average incremental\neconomic  cost  (AIEC),  and  (ii)  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  The  AIEC  is  a  useful\nmeasure  in  determining  the  marginal  economic  cost  of  the  incremental  raw  water  provided  by\nthe Kelani Conservation Barrage.  It is also a useful indicator of the additional tariff implications.\nThe  AIEC  was  calculated  as  a  function  of  the  incremental  raw  water  in  the  dry  season.    At  a\ndiscount  rate  of  12  percent  and  a  medium-demand  scenario,  the  AIEC  is  SLRs10.50  per  m3,\nwhich compares favorably with NWSDB\u2019s present average unit costs in 1998 of SLRs14.60 per\nm3  every  unit  billed.    Even  in  the  worst  case  low-demand  scenario,  the  AIEC  at  SLRs12.50  is\nless than the unit costs for every unit billed.\n\n                                                \n2  No  such  records  were  available  for  1998-1999.  The  estimate  has  been  adjusted  downward,  as  many  of  the\n\nrecorded observations in 1996 were outside the normal dry season.\n\n\f 69\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\n13. \nThe results of the EIRR calculations for the base case in each scenario, as well as of the\nsensitivity tests are summarized in Table A12.1.  The base case EIRRs range from 16.0 percent\nto 22.1 percent. The sensitivity tests indicate that the EIRRs are robust, with all rates of return\nremaining above 10 percent, except in one test with the low-demand scenario.\n\nTable A12.1:  EIRR by Scenario\n(percent)\n\nMedium Demand High Demand\n\nItem\n\nBase Case\n\nCosts +10%\n\nBenefits \u201310%\n\nCosts +10% and\nBenefits \u201310%\nBenefits lagged 2 yr\n\nCosts +10% and\nBenefits lagged 2 yr\n\nLow Demand\n16.0\n13.5\n13.3\n11.1\n\n10.9\n9.4\n\n22.1\n19.3\n19.0\n16.3\n\n14.5\n12.8\n\n22.1\n19.3\n19.1\n16.4\n\n14.5\n12.9\n\nD. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n14. \nThe  cost  estimates  were  made  in  April  2000  prices.  Inflation  rates  were  assumed  at  8\npercent for local costs and 2.4 percent for foreign costs, and constant purchasing power parity\nmethod was used. The capital costs for the Kelani Conservation Barrage were estimated to be\n$11.4  million,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies,  over  the  five-year  project  period.\nAssuming that the Government will onlend to NWSDB 50 percent of the total cost, and that the\nonlending will be for 24 years with 2 years grace, the interest during construction is estimated to\nbe $1.2 million. The debt repayment profile shows annual repayments rising from $0.6 million in\n2005 to $0.8 million in 2006, before declining slowly during the remaining repayment period.\n\n1. \n\nNWSDB\u2019s Financial Performance\n\nA  review  of  NWSDB\u2019s  audited  financial  statements  for  1992-1998  indicates  that  its\n15. \noverall financial performance has been more or less consistent with a no profit/no loss position\nto  provide  an  affordable  water  supply  service  to  customers.  Net  operating  income  has  ranged\nfrom SLRs80 million to SLRs180 million per year, which implies a decline in real terms, taking\ninto  account  an  average  annual  inflation  of  8  percent.  The  only  year  in  which  a  deficit  was\nrecorded  was  in  1996.  During  the  period  under  review,  the  annual  operating  ratio  has  ranged\nfrom  95  percent  to  130  percent,  which  is  above  the  international  norms  for  the  urban  water\nsupply  sector.  The  average  tariff  per  unit  of  water  has,  however,  remained  almost  static  at\nbetween SLRs10 and SLRs13 per m3.\n\n16. \n\nThe main factors contributing to NWSDB\u2019s performance are the following:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nBoth operating revenue and operating expenses nearly tripled over the six-year\nperiod 1992-1998.\n\nAnnual depreciation charges more than doubled from SLRs199 million in 1992 to\nSLRs474  million  in  1998.  A  significant  part  of  this  increase  occurred  during  the\nlast  three  years  largely  due  to  a  revaluation  of  assets  and  an  increased  capital\nexpenditure program.\n\n\f 70\n\nAppendix 12, page 5\n\n(iii) \n\nInterest charges also tripled, from SLRs101 million in 1992 to SLRs300 million in\n1998. In this context, NWSDB is favored by the fact that about 50 percent of its\ncapital  investment  program  is  grant-financed  by  the  Government,  even  though\nthe other half has been financed at hard onlending terms with an interest rate of\n10 percent.\n\n17. \nNWSDB  has  a  high  level  of  accounts  receivable,  about  50  percent  (equivalent  to  six\nmonths) of annual revenue, whereas three months revenue is an acceptable target.  It is evident\nthat  NWSDB  needs  to  address  this  situation.  The  latest  projections  prepared  by  the  Finance\nDepartment  expect  average  water  tariffs  to  rise  by  nearly  70  percent  in  current  prices,  from\nSLRs13.6 per m3 in 1999 to SLRs17.9 per m3 in 2002 and SLRs22.6 per m3 in 2005. A policy to\nguide future tariff revisions was approved in June 2000. It includes tariff increases of about 25\npercent  to  become  effective  on  1  December  2000.  Further  revision  of  tariffs  will  be  guided  by\nthe covenants under the ongoing Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.3\n\n18. \nFinally, one of NWSDB\u2019s major operational issues is the high level of nonrevenue water\nand  unaccounted-for  water.  According  to  NWSDB  data,  countrywide  nonrevenue  water  has\nconsistently been 40-45 percent of recorded annual raw water production, and 55 percent in the\nGreater  Colombo  area,  with  an  unaccounted-for  water  factor  of  about  35  percent.  NWSDB  is\naddressing  this  issue  with  the  support  of  Japanese  and  Norwegian  aid,  particularly  in  the\nGreater  Colombo  area.  With  the  success  of  this  ongoing  campaign,  the  level  of  nonrevenue\nwater is expected to decline significantly by 2005.\n\n2. \n\nFinancial Impact of Kelani Conservation Barrage\n\nAs  the  Kelani  Conservation  Barrage  will  not  be  a  profit  center  in  its  own  right4,  an\n19. \nassessment was made of the key cost parameters that will have a direct impact on NWSDB\u2019s\nfuture  financial  projections  and  commitments.    The  main  factors  are  annual  costs  for  (i) O&M,\n(ii) depreciation  charges,  (iii)  interest  charges,  and  (iv) repayment  of  principal  and  the\noutstanding debt.\n\n20. \nThe financial impact of the barrage on NWSDB\u2019s performance was measured in terms of\nthe  percentage  increases  in  annual  O&M,  and  depreciation  and  interest  charges  over  the\nprojected  values  without  the  barrage.  The  figures  for  the  year  2005  are  summarized  in  Table\nA12.2.\n\n                                                \n3 \n\n4 \n\nLoan  SRI  1575: Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project,  for  $75,000,000,  approved  on  6  November\n1997.\nSince  the  barrage  is  not  a  revenue-generating  project  in  itself,  its  financial  internal  rate  of  return  was  not\nestimated.  Economic justification was found to be sufficient. The average incremental financial cost of raw water\nwas, however, estimated at SLRs12.2 per m3 in the medium-demand scenario, compared with the current tariff\nof SLRs13.6 per m3.\n\n\f 71\n\nAppendix 12, page 6\n\nTable A12.2: Impact of Kelani Conservation Barrage\non Selected NWSDB Financial Parameters\nin 2005\n\nPercent Increase\n\nCost Component\nOperation and maintenance\nDepreciation\nInterest Charges\nTotal Costs\nNWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board.\n\n0.1\n2.1\n4.7\n1.1\n\n21. \nEstimates of the annual O&M costs of the Kelani Conservation Barrage were based on\nan assumption of 0.25 percent per annum on the capital costs of civil works and 2.5 percent on\nthe  costs  of  electrical  and  mechanical  equipment.  Depreciation  charges  for  the  barrage  were\ncalculated on a straight-line basis without annual revaluation, and are estimated to be $383,000\nbased  on  an  average  weighted  depreciation  factor  of  2.6  percent  per  year  (equivalent  to  an\naverage  asset  life  of  38  years).  Interest  charges  have  been  estimated  based  on  the  terms\nindicated in para. 14 above.\n\n22. \nIn  view  of  the  financial  parameters  highlighted  in  Table  A12.2,  it  is  anticipated  that  the\nKelani  Conservation  Barrage  will  have  a  marginal  impact  on  future  average  water  tariffs.  For\nexample, NWSDB\u2019s projected average water tariff of SLRs22.60 per m3 for 2005 will need to be\nincreased by only SLRs0.30 per m3 to incorporate the cost impact of the barrage.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 15 August 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nSLRe1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 Sri Lanka Rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs)\n= $0.0128\n= SLRs78.175\n", "The Sri Lanka rupee is allowed to float against a weighted average basket of currencies of\nSri Lanka\u2019s major trading partners.
