I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nloans to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Greater Mekong Subregion \nNam Ngum 3 Hydropower Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance \n(TA)  for  Strengthening  Biodiversity  Protection  and  Management  in  the  Nam  Ngum  3 \nHydropower Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. 1  \n \n2.  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide two project loans to the \nGovernment of the Lao PDR to support the development of the Nam Ngum 3 Hydropower \nProject and associated dedicated transmission facilities in the Lao PDR for exporting electricity \nto Thailand. The government will use the funds for its equity share in the 440-megawatt (MW) \nbuild\u2013own\u2013operate\u2013transfer Nam Ngum 3 hydropower plant (NN3). The proposed project will \n(i) potentially provide revenue flows to the government in the form of taxes, royalties, and \ndividends currently estimated at $771 million over the 27 year concession period; (ii) increase \nregional cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS); (iii) promote economic growth in \nthe Lao PDR through private sector investment, technology transfer, employment generation, \nand local infrastructure development; and (iv) ensure sustainable development in northeast \nThailand by achieving energy security and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Nam \nNgum 3 Power Company (NN3PC) will sell to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand \n(EGAT) on average 2,072 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually from NN3, which, if generated by the \nThai power system, would annually create 1 million tons of carbon-dioxide emissions. The \nproposed NN3 would be the second large-scale hydropower plant to receive ADB financing in \nthe Lao PDR, following Nam Theun 2, which was approved in 2005. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Hydropower is the major source of electricity in the Lao PDR, providing stable and \ninexpensive  supplies.  Today,  the  Lao  PDR  has  harnessed  2,530 MW  of  its  estimated \n18,000 MW hydropower capacity, or 14%. About 520 MW is consumed within the country; the \nremaining is exported. Present electrification rate is 64%, and the government plans to achieve \nan  electrification  ratio  of  90%  by  2020.  The  government  has  signed  memoranda  of \nunderstanding  with  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam  to  export  to  each  of  these  countries  up  to \n7 gigawatts and 5 gigawatts respectively. The government has decided to hold minority equity \nstakes in export-oriented projects to enhance the revenues it receives and allow it to ensure that \nany  adverse  social  and  environmental  impacts  of  projects  are  mitigated  effectively  and \nsustainably. However, the government does not have the resources to raise the financing \nrequired to build these projects on its own, and needs to mobilize financing from the private \nsector through public\u2013private partnership (PPP). The project is located upstream of two existing \nhydropower plants on the Nam Ngum,2 a tributary to the Mekong, and is considered as a PPP in \nview of close cooperation between the government and its private sector partners in the NN3. \nThe PPP mechanism for power projects primarily revolve on the build-operate-transfer concept \nwith the off-taker entering into long-term power purchase agreements which guarantee cost \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  As nam means river in Lao, throughout this report names starting with nam indicate the name of a river, e.g., Nam \nNgum River. Likewise, ban means village as the first word of a name. ", "2 \nrecovery power purchase price. The success of the Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project3 in \nattracting  private  financing  has  encouraged  the  development  of  several  other  hydropower \nprojects as PPPs. The construction of 750 MW of hydropower capacity is under way as PPPs. \nIncluding the proposed NN3, 9,500 MW of hydropower capacity is at various stages of pre-\nconstruction development.    \n \n4.  Thailand\u2019s electricity is generated mainly by thermal power plants that burn the fossil \nfuels natural gas and lignite, as Thailand has limited hydropower and other renewable energy \n(solar, biomass and wind) sources to meet the demand growth. Installed capacity in Thailand \nwas 29,212 MW in 2009, and peak demand for power reached 22,315 MW. The Thailand Power \nDevelopment Plan, 2010, which runs from 2010 to 2030, estimates that the country will need an \nadditional 21,564 MW of electricity-generating capacity by 2020 to maintain economic growth. \nThe plan envisions sourcing more than 5 GW from neighboring countries. The proposed NN3 is \none of the hydropower sources from which Thailand intends to import electricity starting in \nJanuary 2017.  \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP),4 2007\u20132011 for the Lao PDR aligns with the \ngovernment\u2019s Sixth Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010, which prioritizes developing \nagriculture and natural resources, education, health, and infrastructure. It incorporates the GMS \nstrategy  to  foster  connectivity,  promote  large-scale  foreign  direct  investment,  and  create \nregional public goods. The CSP midterm review, 5 2007\u20132011 for the Lao PDR recognizes the \nimportance of developing hydropower for export to generate foreign currency revenues for the \ngovernment  through  royalties,  taxes,  and  dividends  on  its  equity  investment.  The  PPP \nhydropower projects being developed will help to broaden social and economic development by \nexpanding  the government\u2019s revenue  base. The  NN3  loan  is  listed  as firm  in the  country \noperations and business plan for 2011. The regional cooperation business plan, 2010\u201320126 for \nthe GMS has four pillars, two of which the project addresses: (i) integrating national markets to \npromote  economic  efficiency  and  private  sector  development,  and  (ii) managing  the \nenvironment and shared natural resources to help ensure sustainable development and the \nconservation of natural resources. The project will contribute to achieving these objectives by \nproviding low-cost and renewable energy to meet rising demand in Thailand, and by contributing \nto the foreign exchange revenues of the Lao PDR, which will provide funds needed to meet its \npoverty-reduction goals. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be increased financial resources for the Government of the Lao PDR to \nallocate for socioeconomic development and increased access to environmentally sustainable \nrenewable energy in Thailand. The outcome is increased regional cooperation between the Lao \nPDR and Thailand through the trade of clean energy. \n \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2005.

The government has requested a loan of $98.2 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) to help finance the project. The Lao PDR is a group A country, fully eligible for \nAsian Development Fund financing. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 7 years,7 an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year (with \ninterest and other charges during construction capitalized in the loan), and such other terms and \nconditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  OCR  loan  is  deemed \nappropriate for the Lao PDR in this case in view of the commercial characteristics of the project \nand its ability to earn the government revenue in foreign currency. \n \n10.  The  government  has  further  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR10,619,000 million ($16.9 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help \nfinance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest rate of 2.02% per annum (the interest and other charges during construction to be \ncapitalized in the loan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements.

LHSE  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  NN3PC  implementing  agency.8 The \ngovernment will enter into the concession agreement with the NN3PC, which defines in full the \nresponsibilities of the NN3PC. Annex C of the agreement regulates the implementation of social \nand environmental safeguards. The NN3PC and the government will jointly implement Annex C \naccording to agreed responsibility sharing described in the project administration manual.  \n \n14.  Potential revenue flows to the government are currently estimated at $771 million9 over \n27 years starting in 2017. The commitment is to direct $202 million in dividends to priority \nsectors focusing on poverty reduction and environmental management to ensure that the project \nimpact is significant. The proposed revenue management arrangements10 will mirror existing \narrangements regarding (i) the allocation of revenues to eligible priority programs and (ii) the \nflow of funds to a dedicated treasury account. Significant progress has been made under the \nPublic Financial Management Strengthening Program11, including arrangements to (i) include \nthe allocation of revenues as an integral part of budget execution reports filed by the Ministry of \nFinance, and (ii) strengthening audit arrangements under the State Audit Organization with \nregular monitoring using existing institutional arrangements for monitoring and evaluation. \n                                                \n8  NN3PC is a special-purpose company incorporated by the shareholders GMS Lao Company Ltd. of the Lao PDR \n(27%); Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Public Company Ltd. of Thailand (25%); Axia Power Holdings \nB.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Marubeni Corporation of Japan (25%); and the Lao Holding State Enterprise of \nthe Lao PDR (23%). The lead sponsor, GMS Lao Company, is a wholly owned subsidiary of GMS Power Public \nCompany Limited, which is one of Thailand\u2019s leading private power developers and a shareholder in the Theun \nHinboun Power Company.  \n9  Revenues to Government consist of taxes ($222 million), royalties ($205 million), and dividends (344 million) from \nLHSE resulting from the Project. \n10  The Revenue management arrangements will take advantage of the work already done under those arrangements \nfor the Nam Theun 2 Hydropower Project. \n11  ADB. 2008.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n16.  ADB conducted technical due diligence on the proposed investment and is satisfied with \nthe  rationale,  technical  specifications,  quantities,  and  cost  estimates.  The  project  forms  a \ncascade with other projects planned, existing, and under construction in the Nam Ngum Basin.14  \nLocated about 115 kilometer (km) north of Vientiane on the Nam Ngum, it consists of a 220 \nmeter high concrete-faced rockfill dam, a 10.6 km tunnel, an underground power station with an \ninstalled capacity of 440 MW, and nearly 1 km tailrace tunnel conveying the water back to the \nNam Ngum. The distance from the power house to the confluence with the Mekong is about 256 \nkm, of which 72 km is occupied by the Nam Ngum 1 and Nam Ngum 2 reservoirs, both totaling \n572 square kilometers of surface area at full supply level, located between the project and the \nMekong. The estimated mean annual energy generation of 2,114 GWh will be evacuated via a \n99 km, 500 kilovolts double-circuit transmission line to the planned Nabong substation,15 from \nwhere it will be delivered to EGAT on the Lao PDR\u2013Thailand border.16 The dam will create a \nlong and narrow reservoir with a surface area of 27.5 square kilometers. The dam will be one of \nthe highest of its type in the world, and the highest in the Lao PDR. The technology of concrete-\nfaced rockfill dams is well understood. However, it has been decided to establish a Dam Safety \nReview Panel to ensure the safety of the project during construction and operation stages.

Nabong \u2013 Udon Thani Power Transmission Project, (TA 7026-LAO, $760,000, approved on 12 \nDecember 2007) \n16  The Nam Ngum 2 Hydropower Company has already built and owns a 230 kV switchyard at the location of the \nNabong substation and the, 500 kV transmission line (27 km) to the Lao PDR\u2013Thai border. These facilities are \nrequired to evacuate the power generated by the Nam Ngum 2 hydropower plant. The Nabong facilities, to be used \nfor common power evacuation facilities by several hydropower plants in north\u2013central Laos, will be sold to \nElectricit\u00e9 du Laos, to allow for open access. It has been proposed that ADB finance, under a separate loan for \nBoard consideration in early 2012, the expansion of the Nabong substation and provide the funds to Electricit\u00e9 du \nLaos  to buy the existing facilities.  \n17 Summary Technical Description provides further technical details of the project.

Financial consultants prepared a financial management assessment of LHSE, including \na risk management assessment, in accordance with ADB guidelines. As a holding company for \ngovernment investments, LHSE does not directly construct, own, or operate the projects it \ninvests in. Instead, it purchases equity in the special purpose company established for each \nproject. LHSE has no direct role in project procurement or related disbursements. GMS Lao, the \nmain proponent in NN3PC, has ample experience in procurement using internationally accepted \nprocesses. Further, procurement undertaken so far for the project, which includes the three \nmain contract packages, was monitored by the Lender\u2019s Technical Adviser and found to be \nacceptable by ADB. \n \n20.  LHSE has previous experience with ADB and other development partners through its \npurchase of equity in the Nam Theun 2 Power Company, which was funded with the proceeds \nof grants and loans from ADB, the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association, the \nEuropean Investment Bank, and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement. Project implementation \nwas undertaken by the Nam Theun 2 Power Company, the project owner. LHSE\u2019s functions and \nresponsibilities were limited to disbursing loan proceeds used to fund its equity purchase in the \nproject.  ADB  assessed  LHSE\u2019s  performance  as  satisfactory.  As  a  shareholder  in  project \ncompanies, LHSE has financial management systems generally sufficient to record, monitor, \ncontrol, and report on project-related financial transactions. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and LHSE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  Poverty in the Lao PDR has strong correlations with geography and ethnic identity. \nWhile poverty has declined nationally, 58% of households in northern provinces are poor, \ncompared with 4.4% in Vientiane Capital. This is partly because of mountainous terrain and \naccess difficulties, and partly because a higher proportion of ethnic minorities in these areas. \nPoverty incidence among ethnic minorities in the Lao PDR is 40%\u201355%, greater than in the \nmajority Lao PDR-Thailand rate of 29%. Almost all affected people in the project impact area \nare  ethnic  minorities,  whose  subsistence  livelihoods  depend  heavily  on  natural  resources. \nDirectly  and  indirectly  affected  communities  will  benefit  from  improved  access  to  markets, \nsecondary  education,  health-care  facilities,  with  the  provision  of  all-weather  roads,  and \nelectricity. Xaysomboun District\u2019s economy will be significantly affected, by net benefits in the \nform of accelerated economic growth, reduced poverty, and new jobs. Currently limited health-\ncare infrastructure and services in affected areas will be upgraded with improved year-round \n ", "9 \naccess and services. Also, resettled households will be assured of permanent tenure rights to \nhousing and agricultural land, to protect their continued access to natural resources, which will \nbe a first in rural areas of Phoukout District. Details of resettlement and restoration management \nprocesses are in the resettlement and ethnic minority development plan. \n23.  The influx of labor and camp followers will apply pressure on existing sanitation and \npublic  health  facilities,  while  increasing  the  risk  of  sexual  exploitation  of  women  and  the \nassociated risk of HIV transmission. Ethnic minority women and children are typically more \nvulnerable to exploitation. The project has developed several plans described in the EIA to \nmitigate these issues.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n24.  The project is classified category A18 for environment, for involuntary resettlement, and \nfor indigenous people under the SPS. The potential environment and social impacts and risks of \nthe Project and its associated facilities were identified and assessed in the Environmental \nImpact  Assessment  which  has  been  posed  on  ADB's  website  since  14  January  2011.  A \ncumulative impact assessment for the Project was completed in 2007.19 A peer review was \nconducted on 11 February 2011; review of its later versions were undertaken to enhance \nmitigation measures and conservation and offset programs to meet SPS requirements.  NN3PC \nwill undertake an updated comprehensive biodiversity study on project areas commencing in the \nlast  quarter  of  2011  to  reconfirm  the  extent  of  conservation  and  offset  programs.  An \nIndependent  Advisory  Panel,  to  be  financed  by  ADB,  will  be  constituted  to  assist  the \ngovernment  evaluate  the  impacts  on  biodiversity,  assess  the  adequacy  of  recommended \nmeasures to achieve a no net loss of biodiversity and implement an effective biodiversity offset \nprograms. Measures to address the social impacts of the project are described in the draft \nResettlement and Ethnic Minority Development Plan which has been posted on ADB\u2019s website \non 6 June 2011. The directly affected Khmu ethnic community living in Ban Xiengdet has \nprovided broad community support to the Project. Such support is documented in meeting \nagreements and household level consent to relocate forms authenticated by village leaders. \nEffective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate and compensate for the adverse impacts, and to \nensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social protection requirements, are incorporated in the safeguard \nreports and plans. The institutional capacity and commitment of NN3PC to manage project\u2019s \nenvironmental and social risks are deemed adequate,20 while collaboration with the NNRBC is \nconsidered  crucial  in  managing  cumulative  impacts  at  the  river  basin  level.  Information \ndisclosure  and  consultations  have  been  and  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n25.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.21 The project benefits are expected to outweigh the mitigated risks. \n \n                                                \n18 http://www.adb.org/Documents/TARs/LAO/40514-LAO-TAR.pdf \n19  ADB. 2007.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n26.  The government and LHSE have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n27.  The government and LHSE have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n28.  The effectiveness of the loans are conditional upon (i) the subsidiary loan agreement on \nbehalf of the Government and LHSE becoming effective, and (ii) the concession agreement, \nacceptable to ADB becoming effective.  \n29.  Each request by the borrower for a withdrawal from the loan account for a deposit of \nfunds into a designated NN3PC account shall be accompanied with (i) a certification that goods \nand works have been obtained from an ADB member country (ii) an interim payment certificate; \nand (iii) the endorsement of the interim payment certificate by the lender\u2019s technical advisors. \nSuch documents shall be provided by NN3PC through LHSE for eligible costs for the month \nfollowing the date of such request is submitted to MOF. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n30.
