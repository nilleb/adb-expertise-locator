It  connects  Central  Asia  to  Europe,  the \nRussian Federation, and Turkey. The subregion, once part of the \nhistoric Silk Road, is becoming a transit route for crude oil exports. \nIt has the potential to become an established business, logistics, \nand transit hub. But to tap this potential, it first needs to expand \nand improve its transport network, including roads, railways, and \nports. \n \nThe Agarak\u2013Kapan\u2013Yerevan\u2013Bavra road crosses Armenia from \nsouth  to  north,  and  then  connects  to  Georgia's  southern  road \ncorridor, reaching the ports of Poti and Batumi in the Black Sea in \nthe west, and Tbilisi in the east. This corridor complements the \neast\u2013west highway being reconstructed between Azerbaijan and \nGeorgia. \n \nArmenia  and  Georgia  have  requested  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners  to  cofinance  the \nreconstruction  of  the  corridor.  ADB  proposes  to  support  the \nreconstruction  of  this  corridor  through  separate  multitranche \nfinancing facilities (MFFs). ADB is also financing investments in \nthe  Azerbaijan  section  of  the  Azerbaijan  to  Georgia  corridor.  \nCross-border and trade facilitation work is being developed under \nthe Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation program. The \nimplementation of the physical infrastructure will be accompanied \nby  technical  assistance  to  be  separately  prepared  for  this \npurpose. \n \nThe  North\u2013South  Road  Corridor  Investment  Program  (the \nInvestment  Program)  in  Armenia  combines  physical  and \nnonphysical  investments.  The  physical  component  involves \nimprovement of various sections along the route. The nonphysical \ncomponent  targets  institutional  effectiveness,  including  better \n ", "ii   \n   \n \nplanning,  maintenance,  project  management,  safeguards \ncompliance,  monitoring,  reporting,  evaluation,  and  results \nmeasurement. \n \nTranche 1 Project will (i) reconstruct an 18.4 kilometer (km) four-\nlane section of the corridor between Yerevan and Ashtarak, (ii) \nimprove  road  safety  for  the  Yerevan\u2013Ararat  road,  (iii)  prepare \ndesign and bidding documents for tranche 2 and 3, and (iv) help \nimplement the road subsector plan under the Transport Sector \nStrategy. \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The Government requests ADB to help finance the Investment \nFacility Proposal  Program through an MFF up to the equivalent of $500 million. The \nfinancing will be in the form of ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n(OCR) and Special Funds resources. The MFF will be structured \naround  multiple  loans,  subject  to  the  submission  of  related \nperiodic  financing  requests  (PFRs)  by  the  Government  and \nexecution of related loan agreements and other warranties and \nrepresentations. \n \nThe Government will enter into a framework financing agreement \n(FFA) with ADB. The first tranche amounts to $60 million to be \nfinanced  from  the  Special  Funds  resources.  The  first  PFR  is \npresented to the Board together with this report and the FFA. \n \nThe MFF is considered a suitable modality in this case on account \nof the following: \n \n(i)  The size of the Investment Program is large and needs a \nfinancing scheme that offers greater flexibility, predictability \nand continuity. The MFF offers these elements better than \nstand-alone or program loan lending modalities of ADB. \n(ii)  The  MFF  demands  sound  platform  for  a  long  term \npartnership  in  the  sector  that  combines  project  finance, \nmanagement  and  support  for  institutional  efficiency.  The \nGovernment  has  developed  such  sector  strategy,  policy \nframework and road map. These will require strengthening \nover time but the basic elements are in place, thus meeting \nthe principal MFF criteria. \n(iii)  The MFF provides financing stability for a long term program. \nIt also allows the Government and ADB to finance more than \none sector at a time. The current business plan covers roads, \nurban  services  and  reforms.  Given  the  limited  financing \nenvelope but multiple needs, the MFF allows funding to be \nstructured around both priorities and project readiness. \n(iv)  The MFF front-loads a critical analytical work at the start, \nthus placing greater emphasis on implementation. Financing \nwill be matched closely to project readiness as the previous \ntranche allocates enough resources to prepare the next one \n(including  design  work).  This  helps  speed  up  contract \nawards, disbursements, and results. ", "  iii\n   \nRationale  Rehabilitation of the road network is a top priority for Armenia. \nImproving logistics increases trade, investment flows and jobs.  \nBetter connectivity aids regional cooperation and integration and \nincreases the country's competitiveness. This Investment Program \ncomplements similar ones in Azerbaijan and Georgia supported \nby ADB. It fits within ADB's Strategy 2020, and is part of country \noperations  business  plan.  It  is  also  aligned  to  the  regional \ncooperation  economic  program  for  Central  Asia  and  the \nCaucasus.  The  corridor  provides  Central  Asian  countries  with \nimproved access to the ports of Poti and Batumi and connects the \nCaspian Sea to the Black Sea.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Investment Program will contribute to economic development \nand regional trade. The outcome will be a more efficient, safer and \nsustainable transport network. \n   \nInvestment Plan   The  Investment  Plan  is  estimated  at  $962  million.  The  share \nassigned to ADB over the next few years is $500 million. The \nestimated total cost of Tranche 1 Project is $70 million. \n \nInvestment Program \n($ million) \nItem  Cost \nA.

An OCR loan will have \nan  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the related loan agreement. A loan from \nthe  Special  Funds  resources  will  have  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and interest of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the related loan \nagreement. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization   Until 30 June 2017 \n   \nEstimated Completion  31 December 2016 \nDate \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Transport and Communication (MOTC) \n   \nImplementation  The Project Governing Council (PGC), comprising members from \nArrangements  ministries  of  transport  and  communication,  economy,  finance, \njustice,  territorial  administration,  and  civil  societies  will  provide \noverall oversight of the Investment Program. PGC is cochaired by \nthe ministers of economy and transport and communication. Its \nkey  functions  include  (i)  guiding  overall  policy  and  strategic \ndirections, (ii) reviewing performance, and (iii) coordinating with \nother projects financed by other development partners. \n \nImplementation and monitoring will be delegated to the Armenian \nRoads Directorate (ARD), which will serve as the implementing \nagency. ARD will set up a program management unit (PMU) to \nhandle all day-to-day execution tasks, including (i) screening and \napproving individual tranche projects; (ii) planning and executing \nprocurement; (iii) reviewing and approving final project designs; \n(iv)  managing  contractors  and  supervising  consultants;  (v) \nmaintaining  financial  management  controls,  including  project \naccounts; (vi) monitoring and reporting on project implementation \nperformance  and  results;  (vii)  dealing  with  all  warranties  and \nrepresentations  made  to  ADB,  including  full  compliance  with \nenvironmental and social safeguard policies and action plans; and \n(viii) managing the institutional effectiveness program. ", "  v\n   \nProcurement  ARD will procure works and goods to be financed under the MFF \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  A \nprocurement plan has been prepared for Tranche 1 Project. Civil \nworks are packaged into one contract to be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding. Small works costing less than $1 \nmillion, although not anticipated at this stage, will be procured \nusing  national  competitive  bidding  procedures.  National \ncompetitive bidding will be conducted according to the Law on \nProcurement of Armenia (effected on 5 June 2000 and updated in \n2008), subject to clarifications and modifications as agreed with \nADB.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Investment  Program  will  require  consulting  services  to  (i) \nprepare detailed designs and supervise works; (ii) monitor project \nperformance, including benefits and safeguards compliance; and \n(iii)  help  prepare  and  implement  individual  tranche  projects. \nMOTC will select consulting firms and/or individuals in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  using  the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection,  quality-based  selection,  or \nconsultants'  qualification  selection  method  depending  on  the \nneeds of individual project components and procurement plan. \nADB and MOTC will undertake appropriate due diligence before \nusing  any  of  the  suggested  methods,  and  identify  a  suitable \nweighting system for evaluating the firms' proposals. \n \nTranche  1  Project  will  require  about  89  person-months  of \ninternational  and  296  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices to work on project design and supervision of awarded \ncivil  works  contracts.  These  advisors  will  be  tasked  with  the \npreparation of investments under subsequent tranches. In addition \nto these services, under the Tranche 1 Project, the Government \nwill procure the services of international (32 person-months) and \nnational (45 person-months) experts to help strengthen a road \nsubsector  plan  and  guide  its  implementation.  For  project \nmanagement  and  administration,  ARD  will  recruit  a  team  of \nindividual consultants, which will be work in the PMU. \n   \nAdvance Contracting and  To  facilitate  project  implementation  the  Government  requested \nRetroactive Financing  ADB approval for advance contracting and retroactive financing \nfor works and consulting services.  \n   \nEnvironment  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  for  the \nAssessment  Investment Program was prepared. Tranche 1 Project is classified \ncategory B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken \n(Supplementary Appendix G). \n   \nSocial Safeguard  Involuntary resettlement: Category C - limited or no impact \nAssessment  Indigenous people: Category C - limited or no impact \nA summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix \n11. This is based on consultations during the preparation of the \n ", "vi   \n   \n \nInvestment Program and the Tranche 1 Project. \n   \nInvestment Program  The Investment Program will benefit road users, road construction \nBenefits and  companies,  traders,  and  others  who  derive  income  from  the \nBeneficiaries  development  of  transport,  logistics  and  trade  along  the  road \ncorridor. The direct benefits include (i) lower road transport and \nmaintenance costs, (ii) faster and more reliable road transport \nservices, (iii) reduced traffic accidents, (iv) improved access to \nmarkets and social services, and (v) jobs and income created \nduring implementation (i.e., use of local labor and construction \nmaterials) and after completion (i.e., roadside business activities). \nThe  direct  benefits  will  initially  accrue  to  vehicle  owners  and \noperators and road construction companies, but will ultimately be \nshared with passengers and freight customers through reduced \nbus  fares  and  freight  charges.  While  Armenia  is  the  major \nbeneficiary, other countries in the Caucasus subregion will also \nbenefit  from  a  more  efficient  movement  of  traffic  to  and  via \nArmenia. Indirect benefits, which are expected to become tangible \nafter the completion of Tranche 1 Project, include improved road \nnetwork management, and increased business activities and jobs \nthat have forward or backward links to the corridor. \n \nThe Investment Program will contribute to poverty reduction by \nstimulating  economic  development.  This  will  benefit  rural \ncommunities, especially the rural poor and women. In particular, it \nwill increase the mobility of about 3 million people living in six \nmarzes (provinces), where the road corridor lies. \n \nThe  majority  of  women  in  the  program  areas  are  engaged  in \nagriculture-related activities or with small and medium-size agro-\nindustries (including cottage industries). Reduced travel time and \nmore available transport services will help improve the lives of \npeople\u2014especially  women,  the  elderly,  and  children\u2014as \nimproved  road  transport  under  the  Investment  Program  will \nincrease their access to the nearest markets and social service \ndelivery, including schools, hospitals, and clinics. The investments \nwill also create direct employment opportunities in industry and \nservices. It is anticipated that greater road connectivity may have \na positive impact on less-educated girls and women by promoting \ntheir access to more education and training opportunities. \n \nArmenia has many historical sites that date back to the 4th and \n5th centuries and are home to Christian shrines and places of \nreligious worship. Jermuk and Tatev are the two tourism hot spots \nalong the north\u2013south road corridor. These attract tourists from \naround the world. It is expected that the corridor will promote \ntourism activities and socioeconomic development in the region. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Investment  Program  was  designed  with  the  following \nassumptions:  (i)  continued  Government  commitment  to  the \nconcept  of  transport  and  economic  corridors;  (ii)  efficient ", "  vii\nimplementation of the sector strategy, policy framework and road \nmap;  (iii)  adequate  external  financial  resources;  (iv)  adequate \nroad maintenance; (v) timely provision of counterpart funds; and \n(vi) sound designs and civil works schedules and efficient MOTC's \ndiligent oversight of works and contracts. \n \nThe main risks include (i) macroeconomic instability in Armenia \nand the subregion due to the current global financial crisis, (ii) \nreduced  commitment  to  corridors  and  weak  implementation \ncapacity, and (iii) cost overruns due to sharp escalation of prices. \nThe Government is committed to mitigate these risks.  \n \nThe recent macroeconomic imbalances are being corrected with \nhelp  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  and  other \npartners  such  as  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  After  the  global \nfinancial  crisis  in  2008,  the  foreign  debt  of  Armenia  is  being \nclosely monitored by external aid agencies, especially the IMF. \nThe latter expects that Armenia\u2019s debt ratios will rise sharply\u2014\nalbeit from a low base\u2014with the ratio of public debt to gross \ndomestic product (GDP) increasing from 18% in 2008 to 43% \nin 2010. However, the debt\u2013GDP level is not projected to be \nexcessive. Standard stress tests show that Armenia is at low \nrisk  of  debt  distress.  Economic  conditions  are  expected  to \nimprove by the end of 2010.  \n \nThe investment plan includes contingencies. The same applies to \nthe financing plan. This will help tackle possible cost overruns \nand/or changes to the program and Tranche 1 Project. Tranche 1 \nProject  is  fairly  straightforward  and  unlikely  to  need  extra \nfinancing.  \n ", "viii   \n   \n \nPROJECT MAP \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) and (ii) proposed administration of cofinancing that may be \nprovided by development partners under the MFF, to the Republic of Armenia for the North\u2013South \nRoad  Corridor  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Trade and Transport in the Subregion  \n \n  1.  Subregional Context \n \n2.  The Caucasus subregion acts as a landbridge between the Black and Caspian seas. It \nconnects Central Asia to Europe, the Russian Federation, and Turkey. The subregion, once part \nof the historic Silk Road, is becoming a transit route for crude oil exports. It has the potential to \nbecome an established business, logistics and transit hub. But to tap this potential, it first needs \nto expand and improve its transport network, including roads, railways and ports. \n \n3.  The Agarak\u2013Kapan\u2013Yerevan\u2013Bavra road crosses Armenia from south to north, and then \nconnects to Georgia's southern road corridor, reaching the ports of Poti and Batumi in the Black \nSea in the west, and Tbilisi in the east. An integrated road corridor between Armenia and \nGeorgia connects not only these two countries, but also complements another road corridor \nbeing developed between Azerbaijan and Georgia. The latter is already under reconstruction. \nADB is financing a share of the investments in the Azerbaijan section of the corridor. Given the \nsize of the investments in Armenia and Georgia, both countries have approached ADB and \nother development partners to cofinance the new corridor. This submission covers only the \ninvestments in Armenia. A parallel proposal is being prepared for Georgia. \n \n  2.   Trade and Transport \n \n4.  Armenia is a mountainous landlocked country bordering Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran, and \nTurkey.  The  location  presents  an  opportunity  for  trade;  the  topography\u2014a  challenge.  The \ntransport infrastructure, built mostly under the former Soviet Union in 1960s\u20131970s, is in a poor \ncondition. This affects transit costs, competitiveness, trade, investment and job creation. \n \n5.  Armenia has achieved impressive economic recovery since independence. Economic \nrecovery began in 1993, yielding annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.4% during \n1993\u20132000; it then accelerated to double-digit growth during 2001\u20132007. Transport demand \ngrew correspondingly by 8% in terms of value of merchandise exports and 20% for imports \nduring 2003\u20132008. Exports are predominantly precious stones (principally diamonds), ferrous \nmetals, ore and beverages, accounting for about 70% of the total. Imports include mainly fuel, \nbitumen,  and  precious  stones  accounting  for  around  one-third  of  the  total.  The  Russian \nFederation, Kazakhstan and European countries are the main trading partners.  \n \n6.  Armenia's  transport  policy  is  captured  in  the  National  Program  (2006\u20132009).1 This \nsupports a so-called Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with the European Union \n(EU) signed in 1996. But Armenia has ambitions not only to improve connectivity to Europe, but \n                                                 \n1  Government of Armenia. 2006. Armenia National Program (2006\u20132009). Yerevan (23 March).  \n ", "2   \nalso to Central Asia. Armenia has signed most of the international conventions relating to \ntransport and trade facilitation. It is expected to negotiate and sign a free trade agreement with \nthe EU in 2010 and looking into similar arrangements with Asia.  \n \nB.   Sector Performance and Analysis \n \n7.  The road subsector has technical, operational, financial, regulatory, and institutional \ndeficiencies. Combined, these lead to an inefficient, incomplete, and unsafe network of widely \nvariable quality. These problems can be addressed over time through targeted investments and \nreforms, including greater institutional effectiveness. \n \n  1.  Road Network \n \n8.  The road network in Armenia was developed mostly in the 1960s\u20131970s. The country is \nreasonably well-connected with a coverage ratio of about 280 kilometers (km) of roads per \n1,000 square km (km2). The network is 7,704 km long (1,686 km of interstate roads, 4,056 km of \nrepublic roads, and 1,962 km of local roads). Road conditions vary among marzes (provinces), \nranging from only 10% being in good condition in some (Tavush) to 90% in others (Ararat and \nVayots Dzor). The average roughness for interstate roads is about 5.0 meters (m) per km \ninternational roughness index (IRI). Lack of quality control during construction and inadequate \nmaintenance since independence has resulted in rapid deterioration of pavements. A large part \nof the road network is in a poor state of repair, with only about 15% of interstate and republic \nroads in good condition. The north\u2013south road corridor is also deteriorating fast and cannot \nmeet  the  increasing  traffic  demand.  The  total  cost  of  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  is \nestimated  at  $1.5  billion\u2013$2.0  billion  up  to  2020.  External  assistance  has  helped  Armenia \nimprove interstate and local roads since 1995, but pavements that were not rehabilitated now \nrequire full reconstruction. A detailed assessment of the road subsector, including a problem \ntree analysis, is in Appendix 2. \n \n9.  International road corridors in Armenia are substandard and do not comply with the \nrequirements of international agreements and conventions. For instance, Armenia is a signatory \nto the EU Agreement on Traffic Arteries2 that includes two roads in Armenia classified as \"the \ninternational E-road network.\" These are routes E117 and E691. They form the north\u2013south \nroad corridor. The agreement stipulates minimum conditions to which the selected roads should \nconform in terms of classification, geometric standards, road safety equipment, environment \nand landscaping, and maintenance. \n \n2.  Cross-Border Traffic \n \n10.  Cross-border traffic has been increasing. It uses three main crossings: two with Georgia \n(Bagratashen and Bavra) in the north, and one with Iran (Mehri) in the south. Trucks entering \nfrom Georgia come primarily from the Russian Federation, other Commonwealth of Independent \nStates countries, Europe, and Turkey. The average number of trucks entering Armenia daily in \n2007 was 84 from Iran and 114 from Georgia. In 2008, an average of 59 trucks per day entered \nfrom Georgia as transit traffic\u201447% from the port of Poti, 6% from the port of Batumi, and 40% \nfrom Sarpi (Georgia\u2013Turkey border). By comparison, only eight loaded trucks per day transited \nfrom Armenia through Georgia. Turkish trucks on the Transports Internationaux Routiers system \nenter Armenia through Georgia. \n \n                                                 \n2 United Nations. 1975. European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries (AGR). Washington, D.C. ", "  3\n  3.  Road Sector Management \n \n11.  Road  sector  management  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunication (MOTC). The work covers strategy, policy, planning, investment, regulation, \nasset management, evaluation and results reporting. The Armenia Roads Directorate (ARD), a \nnoncommercial state organization, assists MOTC in managing the network, including designing \nand  implementing  projects  financed  by  external  aid  agencies.  In  the  case  of  government-\nfinanced road works, which are limited to rural and local roads, ARD is responsible for feasibility \nstudies and management of the construction and periodic maintenance works outsourced to \nprivate  firms  through  competitive  bidding.  ARD  also  conducts  safety  audits  and  monitors \nenvironmental and social compliance requirements. ARD maintains a road inventory and traffic \ndatabase  and  uses  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance  Model  (HDM-4)  to  prioritize  its \nmaintenance program. \n \n12.  While the institutional capacities of MOTC and ARD are improving over the years, they \nare still weak. The main gap is project management, evaluation and reporting. MOTC does not \nalways  have  enough  financial  resources  for  maintenance  and  operations.  Road  asset \nmanagement is below par, although improving. Besides organizational gaps, MOTC encounters \ndifficulties  to  retain  talented  staff,  especially  for  project  management.  With  the  planned \ninvestments of $1 billion over the medium term, the workload will be increasing and this implies \nhigher  investments  in  human  resources.  MOTC  needs  an  action  plan  to  train  more  road \nengineers, economists and other road sector professionals. An HDM-4 needs to be expanded to \nintroduce  fully  integrated  pavement  and  bridge  management  systems.  A  comprehensive \ntransport development strategy is in place, prepared with ADB assistance.3  This has paved the \nway for a policy framework, road map and investment program in Appendix 3. But the challenge \nis to raise finance and execute the investments. The strategy focuses first on the reconstruction \nof major road corridors, institutional effectiveness and people. Rural roads and improved urban \ntransport systems are also part of the strategy. \n \n  4.  Road Maintenance and Financing \n \n13.  Road  maintenance  has  been  a  problem  for  most  of  the  past  decade,  inadequate \nfinancing being a key contributor to it. This has cut the quality and value of road assets. But the \nsituation is being reversed with a 25% annual increase in budgetary allocations for rehabilitation, \nrepairs  and  winter  maintenance.  The  allocation  is  now  equivalent  to  $66  million  a  year\u2014\n$5,600/km\u2014quite close to international standards. The challenge will be to maintain this level of \nfunding.  The  cost  of  overlay  programs  alone  ranges  from  $20  million  to  $46  million.  The \napplication of a \"user-pays\" approaches and the introduction of a transparent and autonomous \nroad fund are being considered as additional measures to reinforce maintenance. The road \nsector policy framework and road map calls for incorporating these measures.  \n \n14.  MOTC adopted a 3-year maintenance program during 2006\u20132008.4 A second 3-year \nperformance-based  maintenance  program  started  in  2008,  with  34  contracts  under  ARD's \nsupervision, covering 2,892 km of routine and 3,127 km of winter maintenance. MOTC also \nintroduced  performance-based  routine  and  winter  maintenance  contracts  on  main  and \nsecondary roads in 2006. Performance-based contracts allow MOTC and ARD to reduce the \nadministration and financial burden and improve road conditions. The benefit of performance \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2007.

Yerevan.  \n ", "4   \ncontracts is visible in areas where MOTC-administered roads merge with city-administered \nroads, as the latter are generally in worse condition. The next step for MOTC is to extend \nperformance contracts to periodic maintenance and rehabilitation works. This is envisaged \nunder the sector policy framework. \n \n  5.   Road Safety \n \n15.  Road safety in Armenia has been deteriorating quite fast. The number of accidents \nalmost doubled from 1,025 in 2003 to 1,943 in 2007, and fatalities rose from 252 to 371 during \nthe same period. The fatality rate of 10.6 per 10,000 vehicles is eight times higher than that in \nEuropean countries. Of particular concern is the large number of pedestrian fatalities. The \nNational Road Safety Council (NRSC), established in 2005 as a nongovernment organization, \nhas been sponsoring a number of campaigns, including Think Before You Drive in 2006, and \ndrove the initiative for a mandatory seat belt law in 2007. Other activities to improve road safety \ninclude (i) permanent stakeholder working groups including traffic police and nongovernment \norganizations,  (ii)  school  visits  and  awareness  campaign  programs,  and  (iii)  road  safety \nprograms  to  identify  accident  black  spots.  Self-financing  of  traffic  police  has  led  to  an \nimprovement in enforcement, in particular concerning the wearing of seat belts and drink driving. \nHowever, NRSC notes that traffic accident rates are underreported. For instance, accidents \ninvolving uninsured vehicles are not reported to police, and fatalities are reported within 7 days \nof an accident, compared with the international norm of reporting within 30 days. \n \n6.  Design, Construction, and Consulting Services \n \n16.  Road design, construction, and pricing standards for civil works are outdated and do not \ncomply  with  international  best  practice  and  standards.  Inherited  from  former  Soviet  Union \nstandards, these are not based on economic efficiency, and unit prices are derived from price \nschedules of the 1970s\u20131980s with almost no competition-driven costs.5 Geometric designs are \nbased on the technical classification of roads (categories I\u2013V) without due regard to their \nfunctions.  Construction  specifications  are  not  benchmarked  or  adjusted  to  modern  road \nconstruction equipment. This contributes to high construction costs. Inefficient and outdated \nconstruction  equipment  employed  by  the  local  contractors  makes  them  uncompetitive  and \nunreliable.  Despite  being  built  up  with  external  aid,  the  construction  industry  remains \nfragmented and weak. There are no national contractors with enough resources to manage \nlarge  contracts.  International  contractors  have  not  worked  in  Armenia  and  alliances  with \ninternational groups have not been materialized. In addition, bitumen and prefabricated concrete \nelements  for  road  construction  are  usually  imported,  posing  additional  challenges  to  road \nconstruction. However, cement for construction is abundant in Armenia and even exported \naround the region. \n \n7.  Government Strategy, Policy, and Road Map \n \n17.  Faced with competing transport routes across the Caucasus, the Government's strategy \nis to develop transit routes that provide shorter and competitive links and services to national \nand international operators. The proposed corridor is part of this strategy (Appendix 3). The \npolicy framework calls for improved road management, institutional effectiveness, outsourcing to \nthe  private  sector  and  greater  attention  to  maintenance.  The  investment  plan  comprises \nphysical and nonphysical investment components and is phased. The physical component \n                                                 \n5  Price schedules are converted to current prices on the basis of the arbitrary conversion factors issued by the \nMinistry of Urban Development. The local contractors' prices are evaluated against these price schedules. ", "  5\ntargets upgrading and rehabilitating major highways, lifeline road networks. The nonphysical \ncomponent targets institutional effectiveness, planning, project management, best practice and \nstandards related to construction, maintenance and operations, improved safety, and training. It \nalso covers monitoring, reporting, and evaluation. The total cost of the investment plan is \nestimated  at  $1.45  billion  over  the  medium  term  (2010\u20132017).  International  financing \ninstitutions\u2014including ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank\u2014have been requested to help \nfinance this investment plan. \n \n8.  ADB's Strategy and Sector Assistance \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Armenia6focuses on transport and urban \n \ninfrastructure, regional cooperation and private sector development. \n \n19.  ADB assistance to Armenia has focused thus far on the rehabilitation of rural roads (two \nloans approved for $48 million since 2007). ADB is also financing water and sanitation services \nin secondary towns (an investment being executed through a management contract with an \ninternational operator). In 2009, Armenia benefited from a crisis support facility arranged by \nADB on account of the sharp economic downturn following the global financial crisis. \n \n9.  Lessons \n \n20.  ADB experience with road projects in Armenia is confined to the rural roads program \napproved in 2007. Some issues arising from this operation suggest some lessons, including the \nneed to pay more attention to (i) sound cost estimations to avoid supplementary financing \nrequests, (ii) realistic procurement schedules backed by better planning and advance actions, \n(iii) more extensive stakeholder consultation for better social safeguard planning, (iv) adequate \nand timely government counterpart funding, and (v) improved project management.  Under the \nproposed MFF each tranche will be converted into a loan only when the executing agency has \nprepared a detailed project design and is ready for bidding and contract award. This will be \ncomplemented by advance actions on land acquisition and resettlement, which in turn implies \nadequate counterpart financing. A program management unit will be set up to strengthen project \nmanagement and execution scheduling, evaluation, results measurement, and reporting. \n  \n10.  Other External Assistance \n \n21.  The road subsector has received $300 million in external assistance since 1995 mainly for \nrehabilitation of 1,100 km of interstate and rural roads. Apart from ADB, other sources of \nexternal assistance are the World Bank, the Lincy Foundation (funded by Armenia Diaspora in \nthe United States), and the Millennium Challenge Corporation. External assistance helped with \nroads  and  \"soft\"  infrastructure,  including  management  and  planning  capacities  of  MOTC. \nExternal financiers are earmarking an additional $250 million for the sector during 2010\u20132012. \nThis includes $110 million from the World Bank, $40 million\u2013$50 million from the European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank, and $70 million \nfrom JICA (the latter directed at the north\u2013south road corridor). More information on external \nassistance is given in Appendix 4. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007.

The Investment Program will contribute to economic development and regional trade. \nThe outcome will be a more efficient, safer, and sustainable transport network. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n23.  Key outputs include (i) 550-km of improved road sections in the corridor, (ii) modernized \nborder and customs infrastructure and related facilities, and (iii) more efficient and effective road \ncorridor management. \n \n24.  The outputs of the Tranche 1 Project will be (i) a reconstructed 18.4 km four-lane section \nof the corridor between Yerevan and Ashtarak; (ii) improved safety of the Yerevan\u2013Ararat road; \n(iii) due diligence, final design and bidding documents for tranche 2 and 3 projects; and (iv) \nexecution of road sector institutional effectiveness plan. A preliminary road design for Tranche 1 \nProject has been completed and is summarized in Appendix 5. Tranche 1 Project is ready for \nbidding under advance contracting. \n \n25.  Tranche 2 project may include (i) upgrading an 88-km Ashtarak\u2013Gyumri section of the \ncorridor, (ii) developing a cross-border agreement with Georgia, (iii) undertaking feasibility studies \nand completing the design of subsequent tranches, (iv) improving border infrastructure, systems \nand procedures, and (v) completing the implementation of institutional effectiveness reforms. \nSubsequent tranches under the MFF will complete the upgrading of remaining parts of the north\u2013\nsouth road corridor. All subprojects will be selected based on the criteria in Appendix 6. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n26.  Concept of Transport and Economic Corridors. The proposed MFF supports the \nconcept of road corridors, not just national road sections. The idea is to improve national and \nregional connectivity and in this manner expand the regional cooperation agenda. Azerbaijan \nand Georgia are already following this approach. The proposed MFF brings Armenia into the \nsame model. The investments will benefit all the countries in the region and ultimately connect \nthe  Caspian  Sea  to  the  Black  Sea.  The  Investment  Program  was  prepared  and  will  be \nimplemented in close coordination with all the players involved in subregional roads corridor \ndevelopment programs. It is also being coordinated with other development partners and linked \nto Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC). \n \n27.  Strong Cofinancing Content. ADB has been working with agencies on the definition, \nfinancing and implementation of a regional investment programs. CAREC is the reference point \nfor coordination, although at the subregional level. ADB intends to establish a formal mechanism \nto expand partnerships and cofinancing.    \n \nD.  Investment Plan \n \n28.  The Investment Plan is estimated at $962 million (Table 1). Tranche 1 Project amounts \nto $70 million (Table 2).

Financing Plan \n \n29.  The Government has requested ADB to finance the Investment Program through an MFF \nup to $500 million. A framework financing agreement (FFA) has been negotiated and its signing \nby the Government is being delayed due to the need on the part of the Government to complete \nintergovernmental procedures and to obtain requisite signing authorizations. The FFA signing is \nexpected before the Board approval. Financing will be provided in tranches through individual \nloans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources and ordinary capital resources (OCR) in accordance \nwith relevant ADB policies and the FFA to be signed between ADB and Armenia, subject to \nmodifications that may be included under individual financing agreements. An OCR loan will have \nan interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the related loan agreement. A loan from the Special Funds resources will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and interest of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the related loan agreement. The tentative financing plan for the Investment Program is \nshown in Table 3. The financing plan for Tranche 1 Project is in Table 4.

The  Investment  Program  sets  out  a  framework  for  effective  partnership  with  third \nparties\u2014investors and financiers\u2014over the medium term. While some multilateral development \npartners may provide financing for some parts of the Investment Program in parallel, other \ndevelopment  partners  may  determine  to  complement  ADB's  financing,  after  the  Board's \napproval of the proposed MFF, through cofinancing to be administered by ADB. The amounts of \ncofinancing to be provided by such other development partners and administered by ADB will \nbe within the total MFF amount. Such cofinancing may be provided as loans or grants, and may \ntake the form of parallel or joint cofinancing. ADB's administration of such cofinancing from time \nto time will be reported to the Board for information annually.7 JICA is expected to extend \nfinancing towards the Investment Program. This cofinancing is part of an Accelerated Cofinancing \nScheme agreed with ADB in 2007. The cofinancing will be made on a joint basis and will be \nadministered by ADB. ADB has been requested to raise additional cofinancing for the Investment \nProgram.  \n \nTable 4: Financing Plan for Tranche 1 Project \n \nAmount \nSource  ($ million)  % \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n31.  The  Project  Governing  Council  (PGC),  consisting  of  members  from  the  Armenia's \nministries of economy, finance, justice, transport and communication, territorial administration, \nand civil societies, will provide overall guidance to the executing agency responsible for the \nInvestment Program. PGC will be cochaired by the ministers of economy and of transport and \ncommunication. \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2008. Mainstreaming the Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila. See paragraph 79. ", "  9\n32.  MOTC will be the executing agency and will sign and act as an employer for contracts \nwith consultants and contractors. Implementation and monitoring will be delegated to ARD, \nwhich will serve as the implementing agency. A facility administration memorandum (FAM) \nsummarizes the list of executing tasks and their sequencing (Supplementary Appendix H). Key \nfunctions assigned to ARD include (i) screening and approving individual tranche projects; (ii) \nplanning and executing procurement; (iii) reviewing and approving final project designs; (iv) \nmanaging  contractors  and  supervising  consultants;  (v)  maintaining  financial  management \ncontrols, including project accounts; (vi) monitoring and reporting on project implementation \nperformance and results; (vii) dealing with all warranties and representations made to ADB, \nincluding full compliance with environmental and social safeguard policies and action plans; and \n(viii)  managing  the  institutional  effectiveness  program.  ARD  will  set  up  a  program \nimplementation unit (PMU) structured to include technical, legal, financial, feasibility study and \nproject design, and procurement and project management teams. These teams will also engage \nthe services of evaluation and safeguards experts. The program implementation organization \nchart is in Appendix 8.   \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n33.  The Investment Program will be implemented over 7 years starting in 2009. Tranche 1 \nProject  is  expected  to  start  in  April  2010,  with  completion  by  December  2013.  The \nimplementation schedules for the Investment Program and Tranche 1 Project are in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n34.  ARD will procure works and goods to be financed under the MFF according to ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The procurement plan for the \nfirst 18 months of the Tranche 1 Project is in Appendix 10. Civil works for Tranche 1 Project are \npackaged into one contract to be procured through international competitive bidding. Small \nworks costing less than $1 million, although not anticipated at this stage, will be procured using \nnational competitive bidding procedures, which will be conducted according to the Law on \nProcurement of Armenia (dated 1 January 2005), subject to clarifications and modifications as \nagreed with ADB. \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n \n35.  The  Investment  Program  will  require  services  of  international  and  national  experts.  \nThese services will involve consulting firms and individuals. The work includes design and \nsupervision, safeguards, due diligence or feasibility studies for subsequent tranches, monitoring, \nevaluation and reporting, and assistance with procurement. Experts will also be engaged to \nwork on institutional effectiveness programs, including help with planning, project management, \nand training. MOTC will select firms according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time), using the quality- and cost-based selection, quality-\nbased  selection,  or  consultant  qualification  selection  method  depending  on  the  needs  of \nindividual project components and the agreed procurement plans. ADB and MOTC will perform \ndue diligence in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants before using any \nof the selection methods. \n \n36.  Tranche 1 Project will require immediate assistance. This includes about 89 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  296  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  The  most \nimmediate task is to complete the final design (preliminary design already done) and supervise \nthe construction of the agreed road sections. They will also prepare tranche 2 and 3 investments, \n ", "10   \nincluding completing design work. Another immediate task is to strengthen a road subsector plan \nand guide its implementation. ARD will engage 32 person-months of international and 45 person-\nmonths of national consulting services for this work. Terms of references are in Supplementary \nAppendixes B, C, and D. The principal approach is to agree on the core team members and to \nleave contingency financing to secure the services of short-term experts, as and when required. \nThe detailed design work will require the services of a consulting firm to be selected on the basis \nof consultants' qualification selection. The scope of services is small and the Government wishes \nto expedite completion of designs for bidding the civil works. Other assignments will follow quality- \nand cost-based selection. Full technical proposal will be used for evaluating proposals for the \nsupervision work, and simplified technical proposals will be used for the experts needed to work \non the road subsector plan. It is envisaged that 80:20 quality\u2013cost ratio will be used, although \nother  weighting  system  may  be  considered,  depending  on  the  circumstances.  For  project \nmanagement and administration, ARD will recruit a team of individual consultants in accordance \nwith ADB's procedures for recruitment of individual consultants to work in the PMU. \n \n5.  Program Performance Monitoring, Evaluation and Results \n \n37.  The Investment Program will be monitored and evaluated against a set of indicators \nrelating to the impact, outcome, and outputs in the design and monitoring framework shown in \nAppendix 1. MOTC will provide detailed baseline indicators before start of civil works, and will \nadopt systematic data collection procedures for reporting on results. A team of experts located \nin the PMU will assist MOTC with this work. \n \n6.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n38.  To  facilitate  program  implementation,  the  Government  requested  ADB  approval  for \nadvance contracting and retroactive financing of works, goods, and consulting services eligible \nfor  financing  from  the  MFF  proceeds.  Advance  contracting  will  help  the  Government  start \nprocurement activities prior to the signing of legal agreements. The Government was informed \nthat, in order for expenses incurred under advance contracting to be eligible for retroactive \nfinancing,  such  procedures  (including  advertising)  must  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Once a tranche becomes effective, up to \n20% of resources from such tranche financing may be used to retroactively finance eligible \nexpenditures incurred during the period not exceeding 12 months prior to signing of the relevant \nlegal  agreement.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  any  concurrence  by  ADB  with  the \nprocedures,  documentation,  or  proposal  for  award  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  such \nexpenses or the related project.  \n \n7.  Anticorruption  \n \n39.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. The Government acknowledges that, consistent with its commitment to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly \nor through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nany project under the MFF. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for individual tranche \nprojects. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of ARD and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers financed under the MFF. In case of any irregularities, \nADB reserves the right to suspend and/or terminate financing under the MFF. \n ", "  11\n40.  The  Government  agreed  to  take  additional  measures  to  tighten  and  supervise \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency  related  to  the  Investment  Program.  These \nmeasures include (i) independent external auditing of contracts, project accounts, and financial \nstatements;  (ii)  decisions  on  all  procurement-related  matters  by  the  PGC;  and  (iii)  timely \ndisclosure of information on selection of consultants and contractors through local newspapers. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n41.  The loan proceeds under the MFF will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time), primarily utilizing direct payment \nprocedure. To facilitate cash flows and program implementation, the imprest account procedures \ndescribed in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook will be followed. ARD will open and manage an \nimprest account at a bank acceptable to ADB after the effectiveness of each individual tranche. \nThe imprest account will be exclusively used to finance ADB's share of eligible expenditures under \nthe concerned tranche and will be liquidated and replenished in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. The total advance will not exceed ADB\u2019s estimated share of eligible \nproject expenditures to be financed through the imprest account for the next 6 months, or 10% of \nthe  tranche  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  For  simplified  documentation,  the  statement  of \nexpenditure procedures, as described in the Loan Disbursement Handbook, will be followed to \nreimburse expenditures and liquidate advances provided to the imprest account for any individual \npayment transaction of $100,000 equivalent or less. The Ministry of Finance will monitor the \nimprest account and review monthly reconciliation of the accounts. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n42.  The Government agreed to adhere to sound financial management requirements during \nimplementation of the Investment Program. ARD will be responsible for financial management \nfunctions. Financial management assessment of ARD was conducted in 2007. The review and \nupdate  of  this  assessment  in  2009  confirms  that  ARD's  financial  management  system  is \nsatisfactory as it has (i) extensive experience in external aid projects and associated risks are low, \n(ii)  an  adequate  accounting  system  supported  by  standardized  accounting  software,  (iii)  a \nsystematized bookkeeping and reporting system, and (iv) a consistent internal control system. \n \n43.  ARD will maintain separate project records and accounts adequately to identify (i) the \ngoods and services financed from the MFF proceeds, (ii) the financing resources received, (iii) \nthe  project  expenses  incurred  on  the  components  of  each  project,  and  (iv)  the  use  of \ncounterpart funds. ARD will engage independent external auditors acceptable to ADB to audit \nproject accounts including the imprest account and the statement of expenditure procedures \nannually. ARD will submit to ADB certified copies of audited annual project accounts with a \nseparate audit opinion on the imprest account and the statement of expenditure procedures, as \nwell as the auditor\u2019s report in English within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year during \nimplementation.  ARD  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  timely  submission  of  audited \nannual  project  accounts,  and  the  suspension  of  disbursements  of  ADB  loans  in  case  of \nnoncompliance with the requirement. \n \n44.  ARD will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on individual tranche \nprojects, which will include (i) a narrative description of progress made during the reporting \nperiod, (ii) changes in the implementation schedule, (iii) problems or difficulties encountered, \nand (iv) activities to be undertaken in the next reporting period. ARD will prepare and submit to \nADB a project completion report within 3 months of the completion of each tranche, and a \nprogram completion report after the completion of all tranches under the Investment Program. \n ", "12   \n10.  Reviews \n \n45.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the approval of each tranche, and \nat least three review missions annually. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake a \nmidterm review of the Tranche 1 Project in 2011 and a midterm review of the Investment \nProgram in 2014. The timing of midterm reviews of subsequent tranches will be agreed during \nthe appraisal of each tranche. The midterm reviews will assess whether attainment of program \nobjectives  are  still  likely.  The  work  will  focus  on  (i)  execution  milestones,  institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, and financial aspects; \n(ii) whether covenants remain relevant or need to be reconsidered; (iii) validate the soundness \nof the program and/or tranche; and (iv) review, and if needed, revise the design and monitoring \nframework of the Investment Program. \n \n11.  Preparation of Subsequent Tranche Projects \n \n46.  MOTC/ARD will prepare subsequent tranche projects to be financed under the MFF. This \nwork will include technical, commercial, financial, safeguards, governance, implementation and \nother due diligence. Future tranches will also require final designs and advance actions on \nprocurement. MOTC/ARD will then prepare and submit a periodic financing requests (PFRs) to \nADB for approval with the project appraisal report and a summary of the design and procurement \nplan. The PFRs and the project appraisal report will be prepared in accordance with the criteria \nand  procedures  stated  in  Schedule  4  of  the  FFA,  and  other  related  requirements  of  the \nGovernment and ADB. ADB will undertake due diligence on these submissions in accordance \nwith its operating policies and procedures, and approve PFRs when deemed ready. If required by \nADB, ARD will amend the PFRs and request the Government to resubmit it to ADB for approval. \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n47.  The Investment Program will improve the north\u2013south road corridor and will benefit road \nusers, road construction companies, traders, and people. The direct benefits will include (i) \nlower road transport and maintenance costs, (ii) faster and more reliable road transport services, \n(iii) reduced traffic accidents, (iv) improved access to markets and social services, and (v) jobs \nand income created during implementation (i.e., use of local labor and construction materials) \nand after completion (i.e., roadside business activities). The direct benefits will initially accrue to \nvehicle owners and operators and road construction companies, but ultimately be shared with \npassengers  and  freight  customers  through  reduced  bus  fares  and  freight  charges.  While \nArmenia is the major beneficiary, other countries in the Caucasus subregion will also benefit \nfrom efficient movement of traffic to and via Armenia. Indirect benefits, which are expected to \nbecome  tangible  after  completion  of  the  Tranche  1  Project,  will  include  (i)  improved  road \nnetwork management, and (ii) increased business activities and jobs that have forward or \nbackward linkages to the north\u2013south road corridor development. \n \n48.  The Investment Program will contribute to poverty by stimulating economic development. In \nparticular, it will increase the mobility of about 3 million people living in six marzes (provinces), \nwhere the north\u2013south road corridor lies. The poverty incidence in two marzes (25.5% in Ararat \nand 32.1% in Shirak) exceeds the national average of 25.0%. The unemployment rate is high \n(about 12%) in Shirak and Syunik marzes as compared with the national average of 6.2%. It will \nsignificantly benefit the predominantly rural populations in Aragatsotn, Ararat, and Vayots Dzor \nmarzes, which are deprived of reliable access to health care services. The Investment Program will ", "  13\ngenerate an estimated 2,500\u20133,000 jobs during implementation, of which an estimated 45%\u201350% \nwill be sourced locally in the form of unskilled labor or related services to the construction sites. \n \n49.  The employment level among the households along the north\u2013south road corridor is 70%, \nof  which  around  30%  are  engaged  in  agriculture  activities  or  small  and  medium-size  agro-\nindustries (including cottage industries). Reduced travel time and better transport services will \nhelp improve the lives of people\u2014especially women, the elderly, and children\u2014as improved road \ntransport under the Investment Program will increase their access to the nearest markets and \nsocial service delivery institutions such as schools, hospitals, and clinics, and create employment \nopportunities. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n \n50.  Armenia has many historical sites that date back to the 4th and 5th centuries and are \nhome to Christian shrines and places of religious worship. Jermuk and Tatev are the two \ntourism hot spots along the north\u2013south road corridor which attract many tourists from around \nthe  world.  The  Investment  Program  is  expected  to  promote  tourism  activities  and  thus \nsocioeconomic development in the region. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n51.  Economic  analysis  of  all  projects  financed  under  the  MFF  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.8 The  economic \nanalysis for Tranche 1 Project is in Appendix 12. It is based on a comparison of with- and \nwithout-project cases and covers a period of 23 years (2010\u20132032), comprising 3 years of \nconstruction  and  20  years  of  operation.  On  the  basis  of  projected  GDP  growth  and  the \nestimated income elasticity of demand in Armenia, traffic on the improved Yerevan\u2013Ashtarak \nroad is projected to grow by 8.3% annually, with average daily traffic increasing from about \n13,060 vehicles in 2012 to 65,605 vehicles in 2032. \n \n52.  The major benefits of Tranche 1 Project are savings in vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime. The upgraded road will have an average IRI value of 2.0 m/km, compared with the present \nIRI  value  of  5.4  m/km  in  2009.  Savings  on  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time  were \ncalculated using the HDM-4 software. The economic analysis shows that Tranche 1 Project is \neconomically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 16.8% and an \nestimated net present value of $12.4 million at a 12% discount rate. A sensitivity analysis of the \neconomic viability of Tranche 1 Project shows that the EIRR is reduced to 14.9% when the \ncapital cost is increased by 20%, and to 14.6% when road user benefits are reduced by 20%. In \nthe case of a simultaneous increase in cost of 20% and reduction in benefit of 20%, the EIRR is \nreduced to 12.9%. The switching values are 67% for cost increase, 40% for benefit reduction, \nand 25% for a combination of cost increase and benefit reduction. This proves the robustness of \nthe economic viability of the Tranche 1 Project. Detailed economic analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nC.  Social Safeguards \n \n53.  A land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) regulating land acquisition and \nresettlement activities for the Investment Program in compliance with national laws and ADB's \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  has  been  prepared  and  was  approved  by  the \nGovernment (Supplementary Appendix E). The LARF is summarized in the summary social \nsafeguards (Appendix 13). The resettlement classification of the Tranche 1 Project is C. Civil \nworks will entail the improvement of an existing four-lane highway and will take place within the \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "14   \nexisting right-of-way or on unused state-owned land. No relocation of households or acquisition \nof productive land is expected. Borrow pits or quarries are also available in the state-owned \nempty land, within easy access and away from residential areas. \n \n54.  In Armenia there are no groups with characteristics fitting the definition of indigenous \npeople  of  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  Therefore,  the  entire  Investment \nProgram and all tranche projects will be categorized as C for impact on indigenous people. \n \n55.   Information  and  periodic  seminars  on  HIV/AIDS  prevention  will  be  made  available \nthrough  the  construction  company  to  people  associated  with  the  Investment  Program  and \nresidents in the program area. These outreach activities will be designed by the construction \ncompany and submitted to MOTC for approval as part of the health and safety management \npart  of  the  quality  assurance  and/or  quality  control  plan.  ADB  will  review  and  make \nrecommendations, if necessary. The preparation and execution of this plan will be an integral \npart of the construction contract. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n \n56.  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  covering  environment \nsafeguard  tasks  for  the  Investment  Program  in  compliance  with  national  laws  and  ADB's \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  has  been  prepared  and  was  approved  by  the  Government \n(Supplementary Appendix F). The environmental classification for the Tranche 1 Project is \ncategory B. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)  and  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix G. It shows that the Tranche 1 Project road section would not have a \nsignificant irreversible or permanent negative environmental impact during or after construction. \nMOTC will require the contractor to refine and implement the environmental management plan \n(EMP) outlined in the IEE, and abide by the environmental laws and regulations of Armenia and \nADB's policies, procedures, and guidelines. A cumulative impact assessment is not required as it \nis unlikely that significant cumulative or induced impacts will occur as a result of the Investment \nProgram. However, tranche 2 and 3 projects will widen and upgrade the existing road sections \nand this may impact on areas of environmental or archaeological importance. The terms of \nreferences  for  the  environmental  impact  assessment  for  tranche  2  and  3  projects  include \nprovisions to ensure that the scope covers associated impacts. \n \nE.  Assumptions and Risks \n \n57.  The Investment Program was designed with the following assumptions: (i) continued \nGovernment  commitment  to  the  concept  of  transport  and  economic  corridors;  (ii)  efficient \nimplementation of the sector strategy, policy framework and road map; (iii) adequate external \nfinancial resources; (iv) adequate road maintenance; (v) timely provision of counterpart funds; \nand (vi) sound designs and civil works schedules and MOTC's efficient and diligent oversight of \nworks and contracts. \n \n58.  Risks to the Investment Program include (i) macroeconomic instability in Armenia and \nthe subregion due to the current global financial crisis, (ii) reduced commitment to corridors and \nweak implementation capacity, and (iii) cost overruns due to sharp escalation of prices. The \nGovernment is committed to mitigate these risks. The recent macroeconomic imbalances are \nbeing corrected with help from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other partners such \nas ADB and the World Bank. After the global financial crisis in 2008, the foreign debt of Armenia \nis being closely monitored by external aid agencies, especially the IMF. The latter expects that ", "  15\nArmenia\u2019s debt ratios will rise sharply\u2014albeit from a low base\u2014with the ratio of public debt \nto GDP increasing from 18% in 2008 to 43% in 2010. However, the debt\u2013GDP level is not \nprojected to be excessive. Standard stress tests show that Armenia is at low risk of debt \ndistress. Economic conditions are expected to improve by the end of 2010. \n \n59.  The investment plan and the financing plan for the Tranche 1 Project include large \ncontingencies. This will help tackle possible cost overruns and/or changes to the program and \nTranche 1 Project scope. Tranche 1 Project is fairly straightforward and unlikely to need extra \nfinancing. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n60.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances incorporated in the various legal documents: \n \n(i)  Road subsector plan.

Each civil works contract will contain provisions (a) \nprohibiting use of child labor and differentiation in wages between men and women \nfor work of equal value or type, (b) requiring dissemination of information on the \nrisks of sexually transmitted diseases to those employed at the construction sites, \nand (c) requiring health, sanitation, and appropriate working conditions at the \nconstruction  sites.  Compliance  with  these  assurances  will  be  recorded  in  the \nproject performance monitoring system and monitored during implementation. \n \n(x)  Health risks and prevention. All civil works contracts include a requirement to \nconduct  an  information  and  education  campaign  on  sexually  transmitted \ndiseases and HIV/AIDS for construction workers as part of the health and safety \nprogram at campsites during the construction period. \n \n(xi)  Illegal trafficking. Undertake concrete and adequate measures to detect and \nprevent  trafficking  of  humans,  wildlife,  endangered  species,  and  illegal \nsubstances through the road corridor. \n \n(xii)  Change in ownership and operation.

Build, equip, operate, maintain, \nand manage the facilities financed under the Investment Program in compliance \nwith all international agreements and conventions to which Armenia is a party. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n61.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I \nrecommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate \nprincipal  amount  not  exceeding  $500,000,000  equivalent  to  the  Republic  of \nArmenia for the North\u2013South Road Corridor Investment Program comprising \n \n(a)  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights \n38,443,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and \n \n(b)  loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; and \n \n(ii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  cofinancing  to  be  provided  to  the  Republic  of \nArmenia for the North\u2013South Road Corridor Investment Program by development \npartners in the form of loans and grants as described in paragraph 30 of this \nReport;  \n \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthe Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \nC.

Road Network \n \n1.  The road network in Armenia was developed mostly in the 1960s\u20131970s. The country is \nreasonably well-connected with a coverage ratio of about 280 kilometers (km) of roads per \n1,000 square km (km2). The network is 7,704 km long (1,686 km of interstate roads, 4,056 km of \nrepublic roads, and 1,962 km of local roads). Some 2,224 km of local roads were redesignated \nas  republic  roads  in  2008  with  2,500  km  remaining  undesignated.  Lengths  by  marzes \n(provinces) and function are given in Table A2.1. \n  \nTable A2.1: Road Length by Marzes, 2008 \nLength by Road Function (km)  Area   Road Density \nMarz \nInterstate  Republic  Local  Total  km2  km/1,000 km2 \nAragatsotn  178.2  427.0 150.0 755.2 2,753  274 \nArarat  103.6  294.3 238.1 636.0 2,096  303 \nArmavir  167.3  274.7 209.4 651.4 1,242  525 \nGegharkunik  224.5  350.3 211.8 786.6 3,300  238 \nLori  213.4  471.4 223.1 907.9 3,789  240 \nKotayk  49.0  442.8 118.8 610.6 2,089  292 \nShirak  112.9  469.9 283.4 866.2 2,681  323 \nSyunik  373.0  470.7 220.4 1,064.1 4,506  236 \nVayots Dzor  113.3  394.3 116.2 723.8 2,308  314 \nTavush  150.8  460.9 190.8 802.5 2,704  297 \nTotal Above  1,686.0  4,056.3 1,962.0 7,704.3 27,468  280 \nYerevan    725.0  \nGyumri    265.0  \nVanadzor    162.0  \nOther towns    1,962.7  \n   Total    10,818.8  \nSource: Decree of Government of Armenia dated 1 March 2008. \n \n2.  The road network is 78% paved, 19% gravel, and 3% earth. The interstate network is \nfully paved, and about 90% of republic roads (prior to 2008 additions) are paved. It is estimated \nthat 15% of interstate and republic roads are in good condition, 75% in fair condition, and 10% \nin poor condition. Local roads and many roads redesignated as republic roads in 2008 are in \npoor condition. Road conditions vary among marzes, ranging from only 10% being in good \ncondition  in  some  (Tavush)  to  90%  in  others  (Ararat  and  Vayots  Dzor).  The  average \ninternational roughness index (IRI) value for interstate roads is about 5.0. Lack of quality control \nduring  construction  and  ineffective  maintenance  since  independence  has  resulted  in  rapid \ndeterioration  of  pavements,  prompting  urgent  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  External \nassistance  has  helped  Armenia  rehabilitate  interstate  and  local  roads  since  1995,  but \npavements  that  were  not  rehabilitated  require  reconstruction.  Substantial  investments, \nestimated  at  $1.5  billion\u2013$2.0  billion,  will  be  required  to  improve  the  road  network  to  an \nacceptable level. \n  \n3.  International  road  corridors  in  Armenia  are  standards  and  do  not  comply  with  the \nrequirements  of  international  agreements  and  conventions.  For  instance,  Armenia  is  a ", "Appendix 2  23\ncontracting party to the European Union (EU) Agreement on Traffic Arteries1 that includes two \nroads in Armenia classified as \"the international E-road network.\" These are routes E117 and \nE691 that form the north\u2013south road corridor. The agreement stipulates conditions to which the \nselected roads should conform in terms of classification, geometric standards, road safety \nequipment, environment and landscaping, and maintenance. \n \nB.  Road Subsector Management \n \n4.  Road  sector  management  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunication (MOTC). The work covers strategy, policy, planning, investment, regulation, \nasset management, evaluation and results reporting. The Armenia Roads Directorate (ARD), a \nnoncommercial state organization, assists MOTC in managing the network, including designing \nand  implementing  projects  financed  by  external  aid  agencies.  In  the  case  of  government-\nfinanced road works, which are limited to rural and local roads, ARD is responsible for the \nfeasibility  studies  and  management  of  the  construction  and  periodic  maintenance  works \noutsourced to private firms through competitive bidding. ARD also conducts safety audits, and \nmonitors environmental and social compliance requirements. ARD maintains a road inventory \nand traffic database and uses the Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM-4) to prioritize \nits maintenance program. \n \n5.  While the institutional capacities of MOTC and ARD are improving over the years, they \nare still weak. The main gap is project management, evaluation and reporting. The ministry \ndoes not always have enough financial resources for maintenance and operations. Road asset \nmanagement  is  below  par,  although  improving.  Besides  organizational  gaps,  the  ministry \nencounters difficulties  to  retain  talented  staff,  especially  for  project  management.  With  the \nplanned investments of $1 billion over the medium term, the workload will be increasing and this \nimplies higher investments in human resources. The ministry needs an action plan to train more \nroad  engineers,  economists  and  other  road  sector  professionals.  An  HDM-4  needs  to  be \nexpanded  to  introduce  fully  integrated  pavement  and  bridge  management  systems.  A \ncomprehensive transport development strategy is in place, prepared with ADB assistance.2  \nThis has paved the way for a policy framework, road map and investment program. But the \nchallenge is to raise finance and execute the investments. The strategy focuses first on the \nreconstruction of major road corridors, institutional effectiveness and people. Rural roads and \nimproved urban transport systems are also part of the strategy. \n \nC.  Road Transport \n \n6.  Road transport is largely privatized and is developing rapidly to meet the demand for \nhigher service quality. There has been significant progress in private sector involvement in \nurban  transport.  The  Government  has  removed  most  of  the  subsidies  to  public  transport \ncompanies and privatized bus and taxi companies. The number of bus and minibus routes and \nthe number of vehicles operating them are given in Table A2.2. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  United Nations. 1975.

Cross-border traffic has been increasing. It uses three main crossings: two with Georgia \n(Bagratashen and Bavra) in the north, and one with Iran (Mehri) in the south. Trucks entering \nfrom Georgia come primarily from the Russian Federation, other Commonwealth of Independent \nStates countries, Europe, and Turkey. The average number of trucks entering Armenia daily in \n2007 was 84 from Iran and 114 from Georgia. In 2008, an average of 59 trucks per day entered \nfrom Georgia as transit traffic\u201447% from the port of Poti, 6% from the port of Batumi, and 40% \nfrom Sarpi (Georgia\u2013Turkey border). By comparison, only eight loaded trucks per day transited \nfrom Armenia through Georgia. Turkish trucks on the Transports Internationaux Routiers system \nenter Armenia through Georgia. \n \nD.  Vehicle Fleet  \n \n8.  The vehicle registrations show that cars constitute 80% of the fleet (Table A2.3). There \nis little variation in car ownership levels between marzes, ranging from 45 vehicles per 1,000 \npeople in Gegharkunik to 79 in Vayots Dzor. Yerevan is an exception, with 120 vehicles per \n1,000 people, a reflection of higher incomes.

Road Sector Financing and Maintenance \n \n12.  Road  maintenance  has  been  a  problem  for  most  of  the  past  decade,  inadequate \nfinancing being a key contributor to it. This has cut the quality and value of road assets. But the \nsituation  is  being  reversed  with  a  25%  annual  increase  in  budgetary  allocations  for \nrehabilitation, repairs and winter maintenance. The allocation is now equivalent to $66 million a \nyear\u2014$5,600/km\u2014quite close to international standards. The challenge will be to maintain this \nlevel of funding. The cost of overlay programs alone ranges from $20 million to $46 million. The \napplication of a \"user-pays\" approaches and the introduction of a transparent and autonomous \nroad fund are being considered as additional measures to reinforce maintenance. The road \nsector  policy  framework  and  road  map  calls  for  incorporating  these  measures.  MOTC \nexpenditures on roads for 2006\u20132007, the budget allocation for 2008, and expenditure planned \nunder the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework 2009\u20132011 are given in Table A2.6.

For the first time, MOTC adopted a 3-year maintenance program for 2006\u20132008 in 2005 \n(Decision No. 2412-N, Endorsement of 3-Year Development and Annual Work Plan for State ", "Appendix 2  27\nRoads, 29 December 2005). MOTC also introduced performance-based maintenance contracts \non the main and secondary roads in 2006\u20132008. A second round of 3-year routine maintenance \ncontracts started in 2008, with 34 contracts under ARD's supervision. These cover 2,892 km, \nwith winter maintenance of 3,127 km. \n \n14.  Funding for local roads was transferred to the responsibility of MOTC under the 10 \ndecree  on  10  January  2008.  Some  2,277  km  was  transferred  with  most  of  the  length \nredesignated as republic road, but without additional budgetary funding for maintenance and \nupgrading. The 2007 budget allocated an average of $5,600/km for routine maintenance. About \n$12 million is needed for routine maintenance of the transferred roads. \n \n15.  The cost of an overlay program (30 millimeters [mm] to 50 mm) ranges from $20 million \nto $36 million a year, depending on its scope (Table A2.7). The funding of this program needs to \nbe sought with consideration given to introducing a road fund. For a sustainable, transparent, \nand accountable road fund, management by an autonomous committee or board, consisting of \ngovernment representatives, road administration, road users, etc., is advisable. \n \nTable A2.7: Periodic Road Maintenance Program \nOverlay Length   Cost/sq m  Annual Cost  \nOption \n(km over 10 years)  ($)  ($ million) \n30% of Interstate (1,686*0.3=500)  30  500,000m*8m*30/10=12.0 \nI \n15% of Republic (4,056*0.15 =600)  20  600,000m*7m*20/10= 8.4 \n30% of Interstate (1,686*0.3=500)  30  500,000m*8m*30/10=12.0 \nII \n30% of Republic (4,056*0.3=1,200)  20  1,200,000*7*20/10=16.8 \n30% of Interstate (1,686*0.3=500)  30  500,000m*8m*30/10=12.0 \nIII  30% of Republic (4,056*0.3=1,200)  20  1,200,000*7*20/10=16.8 \n30% of Local (1,962*0.3=600)  20  600,000*6*20/10=7.2 \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n \n16.  Recommended measures to improve road maintenance include (i) introducing a periodic \nroad  maintenance  program  and  allocating  sufficient  funds,  possibly  through  introducing  a \ndedicated road fund; (ii) implementing computerized road asset management and programming \ntools built on databases of road inventory, condition, contract documents, unit prices of work \nitems,  and  available  funds;  (iii)  developing  road  maintenance  manuals;  (iv)  extending \nperformance-based road maintenance to fully cover the road network; and (v) controlling vehicle \noverloading. \n \nG.  Road Safety \n \n17.  The  road  safety  situation  in  Armenia  is  serious  and  deteriorating.  The  number  of \naccidents almost doubled from 1,025 in 2003 to 1,943 in 2007, and fatalities rose from 252 in \n2003 to 371 in 2007 (Table A2.8). The fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles is eight times as high as \nin European countries. Of particular concern is the large number of pedestrian fatalities. \n \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.8: Road Accidents, 2001\u20132007 \nItem  2001  2002 2003 2004 2005  2006  2007\nNumber of accidents  1,021  1,002 1,025 1,164 1,312  1,574  1,943\nDeaths  237  235 252 259 310  332  371\nInjuries  1,258  1,213 1,294 1,492 1,774  2,089  2,720\nSource: 2007. Statistical Yearbook of Armenia. Yerevan: National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia. \n \n18.  The National Road Safety Council (NRSC), established in 2005 as a nongovernment \norganization (NGO), sponsored a number of campaigns, including Think Before You Drive in \n2006, and drove the initiative for a mandatory seat belt law in 2007. Other activities to address \nroad safety included (i) establishing permanent stakeholder working groups that included traffic \npolice and nongovernment organizations, (ii) launching school visits and campaign programs, \nand (iii) launching a road safety program to identify accident black spots. The NRSC notes that \ntraffic accident rates are underreported. For instance, accidents involving uninsured vehicles are \nnot reported to police, and fatalities are reported only within 7 days of an accident occurrence, \ncompared with the international norm of reporting within 30 days. Self-financing of traffic police \nhas led to an improvement in enforcement, in particular concerning wearing of seat belts and \ndrink driving. \n \n19.  Road safety workshops held in September\u2013October 2008 highlighted the need for a $10 \nmillion program for 2009\u20132013 targeting a 10% reduction in fatalities (saving around 50 lives \nannually). It also emphasized the need for a road safety board chaired by the prime minister to \nwhich a permanent secretariat would report. The secretariat (expected to be within ARD) would \nmonitor working groups for data management, safety engineering, and vulnerable road users. A \ndraft action plan was prepared that includes measures on seat belt enforcement ($2.0 million), \nspeed management ($2.0 million), drink driving ($2.0 million), and vulnerable road users ($1.5 \nmillion). \n \n20.  Some of the low-cost road safety measures can be implemented on a priority basis (i) \nimproving road signage and marking, (ii) posting and enforcing reasonable speed limits, (iii) \nupgrading U-turn facilities to make them safer and eliminate abusive use of the median strip on \ndual-carriageway roads, and (iv) improving some of the long uninterrupted descents. \n \nH.  Construction industry \n \n21.  The construction industry in Armenia is fragmented and weak, but is gradually building \ncapacity  through  donor-funded  roads  projects.  After  independence,  there  were  large  road \nconstruction  companies  that  were well  equipped  with  plant  and  machinery.  The  plant and \nequipment is on average 20 years old and operating inefficiently. The limited market for road \nconstruction works has discouraged contractors from investing in new equipment. Replacement \nof plant and equipment requires contractors to borrow money, depreciate the new fleet, and \nadjust their unit prices. Hence, there are no national contractors who have the resources to \nmanage large contracts. International contractors have not worked in Armenia and alliances \nwith international groups have not been tried. In addition, bitumen and prefabricated concrete \nelements  for  road  construction  are  imported,  posing  additional  challenges  to  the  road \nconstruction  industry.  Cement  for  construction,  however,  is  abundant  in  Armenia  and  is \nexported around the region. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2  29\nI.  Design, Construction, and Pricing Standards \n \n22.  Road design, construction, and pricing standards for civil works are outdated and do not \ncomply  with  international  best  practice  and  standards.  Inherited  from  former  Soviet  Union \nstandards, these are not based on economic efficiency, and unit prices are derived from price \nschedules of the 1970s\u20131980s with almost no competition-driven costs.3 Geometric designs are \nbased on the technical classification of roads (categories I\u2013V) without due regard to their \nfunctions.  Construction  specifications  are  not  benchmarked  or  adjusted  to  modern  road \nconstruction  equipment.  These  factors,  along  with  inefficient  and  outdated  construction \nequipment employed by the national contractors and imported construction materials, have \ncontributed to high construction costs. \n \n23.  Geometric highway design standards are given in Table A2.9. The axle-load limit on \ninterstate roads is 11.5 tons and on all other roads it is 10.0 tons.

Sector Challenges \n \n1.  Armenia has experienced turbulent conditions since independence. This affected the \nroads subsector, which experiences the pressure and constraints associated with moving from \ncentral planning to market orientation. Within this context the subsector faces development \nchallenges, both physical and nonphysical. The physical challenges are (i) the degraded state \nand substandard technical condition of the road network, especially subregional corridors; and \n(ii)  underused  and  dilapidated  infrastructure  at  the  international  borders.  The  nonphysical \nchallenges are (i) limited institutional capacity to deliver the roads development program, (ii) \ninsufficient road maintenance funding, (iii) lack of human resources and action plan to develop \nsuch  resources,  (iv)  a  weak  construction  industry  and  outdated  design  and  construction \nstandards, and (v) a deteriorating road safety record. \n \nB.  Strategic Context \n \n  1.  Physical Infrastructure \n \n2.  The  road  network  is  deteriorated  and  extremely  variable  in  quality.  Before  2003, \ninvestment in roads and maintenance was negligible. It has increased somewhat since then, but \nsignificant parts of the road network remain in a poor state. In 2008, about 4% of the interstate \nroads and 30% of republic roads were reported to be in a poor state of repair.  \n \n3.  The North\u2013South Road Corridor Investment Program aims to promote regional trade \nthrough investment in road and border infrastructure, and this will require substantial investment. \nThe Government's medium-term investment plan up to 2017 is estimated at about $1.45 billion \n(Table A3.1).   \n \n2.  Nonphysical Infrastructure \n \n4.  Institutional capacities of the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) and the \nArmenian Roads Directorate (ARD) are gradually increasing. However, there are institutional, \ntechnical, financial, and operational constraints that need urgent attention and action. The \nconstraints are (i) inadequacy of financing for road maintenance and operations; (ii) absence of \nadequate  planning  and  human  resource  training  integrated  with  university  programs  and \ncurricula; (iii) lack of a competitive and efficient construction industry; (iv) lack of competitive \nconsulting engineers; (v) inadequate and outdated design, construction, and pricing standards; \nand (vi) absence of road asset management and monitoring mechanisms. A strategy to solve \nthese  issues  was  prepared  under  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  technical \nassistance.1 The  Investment  Plan  will  help  implement  the  road  subsector  plan  under  the \nTransport Sector Strategy. \n \n5.  Shortage of financing for the road subsector reduces the sustainability of the assets \nbeing rehabilitated and/or reconstructed. The cost of a bitumen overlay program ranges from \n$20 million to $46 million. This program is heavily underfunded and new sources of funding \nneed to be found. Stable and secure funding is required, including application of a \"user-pays\" \napproaches and the introduction of a transparent and autonomous road fund. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed \nLoan to Armenia for the Rural Road Sector Project. Manila [Loan 2351-ARM]). \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n \n6.  MOTC  and  ARD  lack  adequate  management  and  technical  skills,  systems,  and \nprocedures. Retaining talented staff is a challenge and there are no programs that link industry \nwith the engineering universities to supply needed human resources for the road subsector. \nWith the planned investments of over $1 billion in the medium term, the workload will increase, \nparticularly as the entire road network undergoes improvement. This should prompt investments \nin developing human resources and an action plan to train road engineers, economists, and \nother related professionals to international standards. \n \n7.  The construction industry in Armenia is fragmented and weak but gradually is building \ncapacity through donor-funded roads and highways programs. However, there are no national \ncontractors with the resources to undertake large contracts. International contractors have not \nworked in Armenia and alliances with international groups have not been tried. The contractors' \nequipment and technologies are outdated and inefficient. In addition, bitumen and prefabricated \nconcrete elements for road construction are imported, posing additional challenges to the road \nconstruction  industry.  Cement  for  construction,  however,  is  abundant  in  Armenia  and  is \nexported around the region. \n \n8.  Design, construction, and pricing standards for civil works in Armenia are outdated and \ndo not comply with international best practices and standards. Inherited from former Soviet \nUnion standards, they are not based on economy and efficiency, and unit prices are derived \nfrom price schedules of the 1970s\u20131980s with no competition-driven costs. The geometric \ndesigns are based on the technical classification of roads (categories I\u2013V) without due regard to \nfunction (trunk road or rural road), and construction specifications are not adjusted to modern \nroad  construction  equipment.  All  of  these  factors,  together  with  inefficient  and  outdated \nconstruction equipment employed by local contractors, contribute to high construction costs. \n \n9.  Road asset management needs to be introduced to capitalize on the intensifying road \nimprovement program in Armenia. ARD maintains a road inventory and traffic database. The \nHighway  Design  and  Maintenance  Model  (HDM-4)  is  used  to  prioritize  the  maintenance \nprogram. This platform will need to be expanded to introduce fully integrated pavement and \nbridge management systems. \n \nC.  Policy Framework \n \n10.  The Government's short- to medium-term policy priorities in the road subsector are to (i) \ndefine and implement a roads development strategy; (ii) mobilize needed financial, technical, \nand human resources to support the implementation of the strategy; (iii) strengthen policy \nmaking and planning roles of institutions; (iv) develop capacities of road subsector institutions \nfor efficient road management; (v) improve the worsening road safety situation; (vi) establish a \nlegal and regulatory framework for the private sector to participate in road network development, \nfinancing, maintenance, and operation, and (vii) introduce revenue generating mechanisms. The \nsector road map was developed in line with this policy framework. \n \nD.  Investment Plan and Sector Road Map \n \n11.  A medium-term road subsector investment plan for 2010\u20132017 was prepared based on \nthe Armenia Transport Sector Development Strategy 2020. Priority investments were identified \nto improve the interstate and rural road network during 2010\u20132017 at an estimated cost of $1.45 \nbillion.  The  investment  components  of  the  plan  will  construct,  upgrade,  and  rehabilitate \napproximately 1,460 kilometers (km) of roads, comprising 620 km of subregional road corridors ", "Appendix 3  33\nand  840  km  of  rural  roads.  The  noninvestment  component  will  focus  on  priority  reforms, \nincluding the development of regulations and operational procedures; encouragement of private \nsector  participation  in  construction  and  maintenance;  and  capacity  building  for  planning, \nmonitoring, evaluation, and reporting. Most of this will be financed from external aid agencies \nalong with Government budgets. The Investment Program will improve the north\u2013south road \ncorridor and help the Government implement the road subsector plan. The Government is \nseeking other external assistance to implement its investment plan, with the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, and World Bank as the main sources. The indicative investment plan is shown in Table \nA3.1 and the road subsector road map is in Table A3.2. \n \nTable A3.1: Indicative Investment Plan, 2010\u20132017 \nLength Cost \nRoad and Section  Financing  Status  Completion\n(km)  ($ million) \nA.

The Agarak\u2013Kapan\u2013Yerevan\u2013Bavra route (M1 and M2 roads), crossing \nArmenia from south to north, is further connected to the east\u2013west highway of Georgia that \nleads to Poti and Batumi on the Black Sea. It is part of the Asian Highway (AH 82) and the \n\"international E-road network\" designated as E117 and E691 roads. \n \n2.  Tranche 1 Project: Yerevan\u2013Ashtarak and Yerevan\u2013Ararat Road Improvement. The \nproposed Tranche 1 Project will reconstruct the existing 18.4 kilometer (km) o the existing dual-\ncarriageway and four-lane road, including the intersections between Yerevan and Ashtarak to \ninternationally acceptable standards, and improve traffic safety measures between Yerevan and \nArarat (about 38 km). The road works will be confined to the existing right-of-way and be \nconstructed in sections, one side of the four-lane carriageway at a time to enable continued use \nof the existing road during construction. There will be no changes to vertical or horizontal \nalignments. The works are comprised of: \n \nA.  Yerevan\u2013Ashtarak Road Improvement \n \n(i)  reconstruct the road bed and pavement structure including surface pavement; \n(ii)  reconstruct  the  road  shoulders  and  road  drainage  system,  including  cross \ndrainage and side ditches; \n(iii)  improve  traffic  safety  measures  including  traffic  signs,  direction  signs,  traffic \ndelineators, guardrails, traffic markings, waiting lanes, and interchanges; \n(iv)  install speed warning and traffic monitoring equipment; \n(v)  improve road lighting at key locations and major interchanges; \n(vi)  repair road structures including bridges, overpasses, underpasses, and cutting \nand/or embankment slopes; and \n(vii)  landscaping. \n \nB.  Yerevan-Ararat Road Safety Improvement  \n \n(i)  improve  traffic  safety  measures  including  traffic  signs,  direction  signs,  traffic \ndelineators, guardrails, traffic markings, and waiting lanes; and \n(ii)  install speed warning and traffic monitoring equipment. \n \n3.  Existing Project Road Conditions. The existing 18.4 km Yerevan\u2013Ashtarak road (Km \n11.8 to Km 30.2) is four-lane divided highway originally built in the 1970s with extensions in the \nmid-1980s; partial pavement rehabilitation was done between 1990 and 2004. The original \nconstruction quality was substandard; pavement service life has expired and the surface is \ndeteriorating rapidly. Hence, reconstruction of pavement layers and subgrade is needed to meet \nthe design and construction standards associated with international transit routes. The road is \nnot adequately drained; the shoulders in some parts are narrow and not properly paved. There \nare  15  existing  structures  that  provide  crossing  and/or  grade  separation  to  the  traffic, \npedestrians,  and  wildlife.  Some  substructures  have  been  exposed  without  proper  slope \nprotection, and some superstructure has been covered with inadequate pavement, which needs \nrehabilitation to ensure structural integrity.   \n \n4.  The existing 38 km Yerevan\u2013Ararat road (Km 9.6 to Km 47.2) is four-lane divided \nhighway built in the mid-1970s and rehabilitated substantially in 2002\u20132003. It is in relatively \ngood condition and the wide median allows for future expansion to six lanes.  \n \n ", "38  Appendix 5 \n5.  Both  road  sections  are  located  in  arid  areas.  The  landscape  along  the  Yerevan\u2013\nAstharak road is gently rolling uplands, and is flat along the Yerevan\u2013Ararat road. There are no \nunique areas, no protected areas, and no forests or ecological reserves, but there are two \nknown  archeological  sites  along  the  Yerevan\u2013Astharak  road.  There  may  be  undiscovered \narchaeological remains or artifacts below ground.  \n \n6.  The core samples taken from the selected locations indicate that the thickness of the \nexisting asphalt concrete varies between 10 centimeters (cm) and 18 cm built on 12\u201318 cm of \nbase and sub-base material. The subgrade material appears to be unsuitable soil, and includes \nboulders. Hence, findings of the preliminary design indicate that pavement layers and subgrade \nneed to be replaced with properly engineered materials. Detailed calculations will be carried out \nat the detailed design stage to design pavement type, layer thicknesses, and subgrade strength \nrequired to sustain the projected cumulative axle loads over the life of the pavement. \n \n7.  Geometric Design Standards. The project road will be classified as a category 1 road. \nGeometric design parameters shown in Table A5 will be adopted for the detailed design. They \nfollow the Construction Norms of Republic of Armenia IV11.05.02\u201499 with some adjustments \nmade to take into account the E-road standards (refer to United Nations document on European \nAgreement on Main International Traffic Arteries, 2008).1  \n \nTable A5: Adopted Geometric Design Standard \u2013 Category 1 \nNo.  Main Parameter  Unit  Flat  Rolling \n1.

Pavement Improvements. The preliminary pavement design consists of 50 millimeters \n(mm) of fine-grained asphalt concrete as a surface course (wearing course), 70 mm of coarse-\ngrained asphalt concrete as a binder course, 80 mm of aggregate mix with bitumen and 350 mm \nof crushed stone aggregate as a base course (road base), and 150 mm of gravel-sand as a \nsub-base. Armenia has abundant deposits of cement for construction of cement concrete roads. \nHowever, roads have traditionally been built with asphalt concrete. A detailed study will be \nundertaken during the detailed design by the international pavement specialist, and will include \n(i) a comparative analysis of asphalt concrete and cement concrete pavements to arrive at the \nbest option, (ii) detailed pavement calculations and design for the preferred pavement option, \nand (iii) detailed construction specifications for the preferred pavement option. The analysis of \nbest option will be based on projected cumulative equivalent standard axle loads, state-of-the-\nart construction standards and equipment application, the availability of domestic materials, \n                                                 \n1  http://www.unece.org/trans/conventn/legalinst.html.

Road Safety Improvement. Road safety provisions on both roads are inadequate and \ndo not comply with international standards. There are randomly located U-turn facilities; signage, \nroad markings, and lighting are absent or inadequate; there are insufficient crash barriers and \nmedian separation barriers; and traffic flows at some interchanges are unsafe. The median \nseparation is misused by local traffic and this poses a large safety hazard. The proposed \nimprovements are summarized in para. 2.   \n \n10.  Material, Equipment, and Labor. Construction materials, such as embankment soil, \naggregate, gravel, and sand, are locally available. A detailed material source study and analysis \nwill be carried out during the detail design or prior to the construction works. Other materials \nsuch as bitumen, steel, high-strength cement, mechanical/electrical material and equipment, \nand spare parts will be imported. Dismantled asphalt pavement materials can be used for the \nroad bed or as recycled asphalt pavement material, if the material can be treated satisfactorily \nand the quality maintained successfully in the required tests prior to construction. Most skilled \nand all unskilled labor is available in Armenia for road construction. \n ", "40  Appendix 6 \nSELECTION CRITERIA AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR PROJECTS \n \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Sustainable Development Program of the Government, which was approved in October 2008, is a long term \ndevelopment strategy. The program is Armenia\u2019s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II), which builds \non the considerable achievements of PRSP I, and has three key goals covering the period 2009\u20132021 (with specific \nmedium-term targets for 2009\u20132015): (i) reducing poverty and eliminating extreme poverty, (ii) ensuring human \ndevelopment, and (iii) deepening economic growth and accelerating the development of lagging regions. According to \nthe Sustainable Development Program, the development and increased efficiency of the transport system is viewed \nas an important prerequisite for ensuring high growth, increased access to and efficiency of social services, increased \nlabor force mobility, and elimination of regional disparities. That is why the Government made improving the existing \nregional road network a priority task, and it has developed an investment plan to improve the main road network. Its \nphysical component will upgrade and rehabilitate Armenia's major highways, lifeline road network, and the cross-\nborder infrastructure; the nonphysical component will facilitate implementation of the road sector development plan. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Investment  Program  is  estimated  at  $1.45  billion  over  the  medium  term  (2010\u20132020). \nInternational  financing  institutions  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  World  Bank,  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and other bilateral aid \nagencies will share these investment costs. \n \nThe Agarak\u2013Kapan\u2013Yerevan\u2013Bavra route (M1 and M2 roads) crossing Armenia from south to north is connected to \nthe east\u2013west highway of Georgia that leads to Poti and Batumi on the Black Sea. This route provides Armenia with \nthe shortest access to the seaports linked to the Russian Federation, Europe, and Turkey. Meanwhile in Georgia, the \neast\u2013west highway is being improved as the Government\u2019s top priority, and Georgia plans to improve the Bavra\u2013\nZhdanov\u2013Akhaltskha\u2013Batumi road as an alternative link to Black Sea ports from Tbilisi. This will enable cargoes from \nArmenia to be transported to Black Sea ports more easily via a shorter route. On this basis, the Government has \nselected the north\u2013south road corridor to be improved under the Investment Program as a priority, and ADB will \nsupport this program through a multitranche financing facility (MFF) of up to $500 million. The Government requested \nADB to extend technical assistance for preparing the North\u2013South Road Corridor Investment Program to be financed \nby a blending of ADB's Asian Development Fund and ordinary capital resources and implemented in phases in line \nwith the priorities that will be identified by the transport sector strategy currently under preparation. \n \nTranche 1 Project of the Investment Program will (i) reconstruct an 18.4-kilometer (km), four-lane section of the \nYerevan\u2013Ashtarak road to international standards, and (ii) facilitate implementation of the road subsector plan under \nthe Transport Sector Strategy. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe human development Index (computed by the United Nations Development Programme, 2006) for Armenia is \n0.777, which gives the country a rank of 83rd out of 179 countries. It is better placed than Georgia (93rd) and \nAzerbaijan (97rd). The Human Poverty Index-1 value was 4.5 % for Armenia (2006) and, according to it, Armenia \nranks 14th among 135 developing countries. The situation with human poverty is better than in the neighboring \ncountries (the value for Georgia was 5.5% and for Azerbaijan 11.8%). \n \nArmenia\u2019s rates for poverty (25.0% of the population) and extreme poverty (3.8%) in 2007 declined from the 2004 \nrates of 34.6% for poverty and 6.4% for extreme poverty. Poverty has become shallower and less severe as the \npoverty gap and the severity of poverty have also declined significantly. In 2007, the poverty gap was estimated at \n4.9% (down from 7.4% in 2004), while the severity of poverty was estimated at 1.5% (down from 2.4% in 2004). The \ndeficit between the consumption of the poor and the poverty line (expressed as a percentage of the poverty line) fell \nfrom 21% in 2004 to 19%. During 2004\u20132007, income inequality slightly decreased. Inequality measured by the Gini \ncoefficient indicates that the population polarization in Armenia is deeper in income distribution than in consumption. \nIn 2007 the consumption inequality measured by the Gini coefficient increased by 0.028 compared with 2004 (0.288 \n ", "52  Appendix 11 \nin 2007 compared with 0.260 in 2004), while income inequality decreased by 0.024 (0.371 in 2007 compared with \n0.395 in 2004). \n \nPrudent fiscal and monetary policies were instrumental in maintaining macroeconomic stability and contributing to \npoverty reduction. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 13.1% per year on average during 2003\u20132007, and \ninflation averaged 3.9% during the same period. Social expenditures increased to 4.7% of GDP, well above the \nprojected PRSP I goal of 3.0%. Increased resources to the social sectors improved the access to and quality of \ngeneral secondary education, and led to improvements in the use of and geographic access to basic health services, \nmost notably through the free provision of primary health care to the population. \n \nHowever, despite the fast poverty reduction (including very poor) in Armenia, the poverty level still significantly varies \namong marzes (provinces), and between rural and urban areas. This situation is mostly a result of the existing \ndifferences of economic development, and the peculiarities of physical, geographical, and infrastructure development \nof different regions. According to 2005 and 2006 National Statistical Service Household Survey data, the poverty \nincidence is higher in marzes affected by the earthquake of 1988; in bordering regions; in the regions with \nunfavorable conditions for agriculture, especially with small share of irrigated agriculture land; and in marzes with a \npredominantly urban population. The analysis of poverty incidence by gender during 1999\u20132007 shows that there are \nno significant gender disparities regarding poverty in the country.  \n \nAfter growing at an average rate of 13.5% in 2006\u20132007, the Armenian economy moderated with real GDP growth of \n6.8% in 2008. It declined by 9.7% in the first 4 months of 2009 and is expected to decelerate by around 9.5% in 2009. \nRemittances, which at $1.5 billion accounted for 13% of GDP in 2008, are projected to be around 30% less in 2009. \nThe Armenian dram has depreciated by 25% against the US dollar, which is significant as 70% of the economy is \ndollarized. The Government faces a revenue shortfall of 22% and a financing gap of $460 million. The fiscal deficit is \nestimated to increase from AMD40 billion (1.0% of GDP), forecast in the original 2009 budget, to 6.5% of GDP. \nUnemployment has increased and is likely to further rise. According to the National Statistical Service of Armenia, in \n2009 unemployment is 6.6% (compared with 8% in 2007 and 6.2% in 2008), though unofficial estimates suggest \nfigures closer to 20%\u201325%. The poverty and social analysis conducted for Tranche 1 Project will also be conducted \nfor future tranche(s) as required.   \n \n2. Design Features \n \nDesign features may be incorporated to preserve and enhance local access along the four-lane highway for local \nproduce vendors, such as creation of roadside markets, through local consultation, with full sanitary facilities on wide \npull-out lanes. Other possible design features with poverty reduction potential will be explored during the planning \nand implementation of Tranche 1 Project and following tranches following recommendations in ADB\u2019s Technical Note \non  Social  Analysis  for  Transport  Projects  (http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Transport-Projects-Social-\nAnalysis/Transport-Social-Analysis.pdf)  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe social and poverty impact analysis of tranche 1 and 2 projects indicate that the poverty incidence in two marzes \nout of five (Ararat 25.5% and Shirak 32.1%) exceeded the national average of 25%. The unemployment rate is high in \nShirak (11.8%) and Syunik (11.8%) marzes compared with the national republic average of 6.2%. While the \nInvestment Program aims to facilitate regional trade and benefit major businesses and those involved in trade, it will \nalso significantly benefit rural communities, especially rural poor. This is important taking into consideration that in \nthree marzes (Aragatsotn, Ararat, and Vayots Dzor) the population is predominantly rural. While the incidence of rural \npoverty declined by 19.7% between 2004 and 2007, the trend is still 1.6 times lower than that in the urban area. In \n2007, 25.5% of the rural population was poor compared to 25% of the population of Armenia and 24.7% in the urban \narea. The Investment Program will increase the mobility of about 1 million people living in six marzes, where the \nnorth\u2013south corridor lies. In terms of human poverty modified index of 2005, an unfavorable situation has been \nrecorded in three marzes\u2014Aragatsotn (49.6%), Ararat (8.7%), and Shirak 34.8%, compared with the national \naverage of 32.4%). From the viewpoint of human poverty (as against income poverty), the rural population is most \nvulnerable. The marz-level analysis of human modified index components shows that the most influential factor of \nhuman poverty in Armenia is the lack of access to health care services. According to survey data, about 62% of \nsurveyed households visited health care facilities in case of need. Those who did not visit health care facilities (about \n38%) cited high official and nonofficial payments for treatment as reasons for nonattendance. \n \nAlmost all marzes, except Ararat, are also in unfavorable situations in terms of social vulnerability index of 2005. In \nSyunik marz the social vulnerability index (37.5%) exceeds the national average (36.6%) and in Shirak it is equal to ", "Appendix 11  53\nthe national average. This is because some social groups are heavily represented in the composition of marz \npopulation (lonely elderly, unemployed, elderly, and poverty family benefits receivers). \n \nThe majority of households in the program areas are engaged in agriculture activities or small and medium-size agro-\nindustries (including cottage agro-industries). According to the same socioeconomic survey, 71.4% of household \nheads are employed, and about 30% of them are mainly occupied in agriculture activity. About 48% of households \nrefer land as the main source of their food production, about 24% of households of which mentioned land as the main \nsource of their income; 50% of surveyed households use the road corridor every day and about 40% use it several \ntimes a month. The majority of respondents think that improvement of the road will have a positive social impact. \nAbout 57% of the respondents believe that, as a result of the improvements, the road will be safer. More than 30% or \nrespondents think that it will also have a positive economic impact. Hence, 17.9% of respondents think that it will \npromote trade and 14.3% think that the Investment Program will create short-term job opportunities for the community \nmembers during the construction period. \n \nReduced travel time and more available transport services will help improve the lives of people, especially women, \nthe elderly, and children, as improved road transport under the Investment Program will increase their access to the \nnearest markets and social service delivery institutions such as schools, hospitals, and clinics, and create job \nopportunities. The Investment Program will generate estimated 2,500\u20133,000 jobs during implementation, of which an \nestimated 45%\u201350% will be sourced locally in the form of unskilled labor or related services to the construction sites. \n \nLocal community members have some concerns about construction waste, disturbance of land, and safety of their \nfamily members. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nConsultation was carried out with all the stakeholders during the program preparation. Consultations were held at \nvarious levels such as the Armenian Roads Directorate (ARD), the Ministry of Transport and Communication \n(MOTC), the State Committee of Real Estate Cadastre, Municipality of Yerevan, Real World Real People (a \nnongovernment organization providing HIV/AIDS prevention and education services), and local communities to be \ndirectly affected by the Investment Program. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy recommends that (i) \nconsultation  on  safety,  social,  and  cultural  concerns  will  be  continued  throughout  the  implementation  of  the \nInvestment Program; (ii) men and women are given equal employment opportunities directly, or indirectly, arising \nfrom the Investment Program and without any differentiation of wages for equal work; and (iii) mechanisms for \nmaximizing local employment benefits will be included in the bidding documents. These activities will be carried out \nby the program management unit to be established within ARD, with social and resettlement specialists supported by \nthe supervision consultants. The specialists will organize public information meetings and workshops for stakeholders \nand affected persons, addressing the safety, social, and cultural issues and, in particular for involuntary resettlement. \nThe  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  has  been  formulated  and  has  been  translated  into \nArmenian, which will be distributed to the program regions for review and endorsement. During the different stages of \nthe  Investment  Program  (planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring)  following  actions  will  be  undertaken:  (i) \ndistribution of public information brochures or booklets in Armenian, (ii) placement of copies of land acquisition and \nresettlement plans (LARP) in Armenian in the marzes and local government offices, and (iii) uploading of the LARPs \nonto ADB's website. Community authorities and relevant stakeholders will be informed about all aspects of the \nInvestment  Program,  and  their  assistance  will  be  solicited.  The  processes  and  mechanisms  ensuring  active \ninvolvement of all stakeholders and affected persons will be detailed in the LARPs prepared for all future tranche \nprojects, including the date, list of participants, and minutes of consultation meetings and workshops. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n  Information sharing          Consultation        Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nViews and concerns of all stakeholders will be taken into account through consultation meetings and workshops and \naddressed whenever feasible. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. The Investment Program will have a positive impact on gender equality. The majority of women in \nthe program areas are engaged in agriculture activities or small and medium-sized agro-industries (including cottage \nagro-industries). Reduced travel time and more available transport services will help improve the lives of women and \nchildren, as improved road transport under the Investment Program will increase their access to the nearest markets \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \nand social service delivery institutions such as schools, hospitals, and clinics, and create employment opportunities. It \nis anticipated that greater road connectivity will have a positive impact on less-educated girls and women by \npromoting their access to more education and training opportunities. \n \n2.

Introduction \n \n1.  An economic analysis has been undertaken for Tranche 1 Project, which will improve to \ninternational standard 18.4 kilometers (km) of the four-lane road section between Yerevan and \nAshtarak. This is part of M1, the main gateway to Yerevan from the north. The road has never \nbeen rehabilitated and is in poor condition. The Project will reconstruct the carriageways and \nprovide road furniture of appropriate standard. It will rationalize and improve U-turn facilities and \nupgrade the M1\u2013M3 intersection. The benefits considered for normal and generated traffic are (i) \nvehicle  operating  cost  savings  from  the  improvement  in  the  road  surface  quality  and  the \nprovision of paved shoulders, and (ii) time savings.  \n \nB.  Basic Parameters \n \n2.  The  parameter  values  for  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance  Model  (HDM-4) \nanalysis are given in Table A12.1. \n \nTable A12.1: Typical Vehicle Base Data \nTrucks \nItem  Car Minibus Bus 2-Axle  3-Axle  >3-Axle\nEconomic cost ($'000)  17 16 40 20  30  80\nFuel cost (cent per liter)  74 74 57 74  57  57\nOil cost ($ per liter)  5.5 4.1 4.1 2.7  2.7  2.7\nTyre cost ($ per tyre)  51 76 144 212  212  255\nMaintenance labor ($ per hour)  4.9 8.6 8.2 9.6  9.6  11.0\nCrew wages ($ per hour)  0.0 1.0 1.3 1.7  1.7  2.3\nNo. of passengers  2.5 15 40 0  0  0\nPassenger work time ($ per hour)  2.50 2.50 2.50       \nNon-work time ($ per hour)  0.83 0.83 0,83       \nWork-related time (%)  75 75 75       \nAnnual utilization (km'000)  20 60 70 30  86  86\nVehicle life years  10 7 8 12  14  14\nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n \n3.  Generated Traffic. Combined generated and induced traffic has been assumed to be \n10% of normal traffic. Generated and induced benefits are evaluated at 50% of normal traffic \nbenefits\u2014equivalent to a normal traffic increase of 5%. The current international roughness \nindex (IRI) of the project road is 5.4. After improvement, the IRI will initially be reduced to 2.0. \n \nC.  Traffic Analysis \n \n4.  Base-Year Traffic Volume. Traffic counts were taken at three locations on the M1 and \nat  the  Armenia\u2013Georgia  border  crossing  of  Bagratashen  in  May\u2013July  2009  (Table  A12.2). \nBased on Armenian Roads Directorate (ARD) monthly count data for interstate roads, the \nvolume in May is typical of annual traffic volume and no seasonal adjustment factor has been \napplied. The volume in July at ARD's automatic counter at Km 20.7 (the count site) is on \naverage 19.7% above annual average daily traffic volume. The July count has been adjusted by \na factor of 0.835 to annual average daily traffic. ", "Appendix 12  57\n \n5.  The Project comprises three homogeneous sections for traffic volume: (i) from the start \nof the four-lane road at Km 11.8 to the junction for Ashtarak at Km 23.2, (ii) from Ashtarak \njunction to the M3 intersection at Km 25.2, and (iii) from the M3 intersection to the end of the \nfour-lane section at Km 30.2. Traffic volume on section (ii) is estimated at 70.0% of that on \nsection (i), and the volume on section (iii) is estimated at 43.0% of that on section (i). The \ndistance-weighted average volume for the Project is 81.3% of the volume on the counted \nsection (i). The base-year 2009 traffic volume on the Project after seasonal adjustment and \nadjustment for homogeneous sections is 11,257 (16,582 multiplied by 0.835 multiplied by 0.813). \n \n6.  The Armenia\u2013Georgia border on the north\u2013south corridor at Bavra is unusable by heavy \nvehicles due to the deteriorated state of the road in Georgia immediately north of the border. \nThis road is under reconstruction and vehicles traveling to western Georgia and Turkey via \nBagratashan will be divert to much shorter M1 route via Bavra by November 2010, before \ncompletion  of  the  project.  Based  on  the  results  of  an  origin-and-destination  survey  at \nBagratashan, it is estimated that 56% of vehicles (423 vehicles) will divert. The base-year traffic \nvolume for the project road, including diversion, is 11,680 (Table 12.2). \n \nTable A12.2: Traffic Counts \n          Trucks      Peak Hr \nPick-  Mini- 2-  3-  >3- (% of \nLocation  Car  up  bus  Bus  Axle  Axle  Axle  Total  PCUs  AADT) \n24-hour count:                     \nM-1 Km 20.7  13,761  938  965  217  446  191  64  16,582  17,275  8.1 \nM-1 Km 30  4,755  493  341  72  351  117  36  6,165  6,749  7.8 \nM-1 Km 70  2,215  236  229  26  121  33  31  2,891  3,161  8.3 \nBagratashen  527  26  34  3  15  6  145  756  1,004  7.4 \nComposition (%)                     \nM-1 Km 20.7  83.0  5.7  5.8  1.3  2.7  1.2  0.4  100.0     \nM-1 Km 30  77.1  8.0  5.5  1.2  5.7  1.9  0.6  100.0     \nM-1 Km 70  76.6  8.2  7.9  0.9  4.2  1.1  1.1  100.0     \nBagratashen  69.7  3.4  4.5  0.4  2.0  0.8  19.2  100.0     \nWeighted \nAverage  \nKm 11.8\u2013Km 30.2  9,601  650  672  149  311  138  159  11,680     \nComposition %:  82.2  5.5  5.7  1.3  2.7  1.2  1.4  100.0     \nAADT = annual average daily traffic, PCU = equivalent passenger car unit, M = motorway, km = kilometer. \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates.  \n \n7.  Future Traffic. Traffic growth over the analysis period to 2032 is based on projected \ngrowth of gross domestic product (GDP) and an estimate of demand elasticity. The International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) June 2009 forecast for Armenia\u2019s GDP is growth of 1.3% in 2010, 3.5% in \n2011, and 4.5% per annum in 2012\u20132014. A GDP growth rate of 6.0% has been assumed for \n2014\u20132020, and of 7.0% for 2020\u20132032. Little or no change in population is expected over the \nperiod. The average elasticity of traffic growth to GDP is taken as 1.2. The forecast traffic \nvolume with and without the Project is given in Table A12.3.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "58  Appendix 12 \nTable A12.3: Traffic Forecast \nSection  2012  2015  2020  2025  2032 \nWith Project  13,060  17,110  24,490  36,660  65,605 \nWithout Project  13,060  15,550  22,270  33,330  59,641 \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates.  \n \nD.  Economic Analysis  \n \n8.  Economic Costs. The economic cost of the Project comprises (i) capital investment, \nincluding  civil  works  and  physical  contingency,  environmental  mitigation,  and  consulting \nservices for construction supervision; and (ii) net road maintenance during the analysis period. \nAll cost elements are valued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and \nduties excluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.97 is applied to nontradable items and labor. \nA shadow wage rate factor of 0.7 is used to estimate the economic price of unskilled labor, \nestimated to account for 5% of the construction cost. The periodic maintenance cost saving will \noccur with the project case, as a thicker overlay will be required in the without-project case to \nlower the high IRI. The total economic cost for improving the 18.4 km road is estimated at $29.6 \nmillion. The residual value was assumed 30% of the initial investment cost. \n \n9.  Economic Benefits. The major economic benefits of the Project are savings on vehicle \noperating costs and travel time because of improved road conditions. These savings were \ncalculated using the Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM-4) model. Travel time \nsavings for passengers were calculated at $2.50 per hour for work-related trips\u2014the average \nhourly wage rate plus an overhead factor of one-third. For non-business trips, one third of the \nvalue of the work time saved is used as a proxy for willingness to pay. The time saved for freight \nis estimated at $0.3 per ton per hour as defaulted in HDM-4. It is in line with a load of 2 tons with \na value of $10,000 per ton. The time savings for freight are, however, minor as freight traffic \nconstitutes only 5% of forecast traffic. \n \n10.  Economic Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value. The economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) and the economic net present value (at a discount rate of 12%) were calculated \nby comparing the with-project and without-project scenarios for a 20-year period of operation. In \nthe  without-project  case,  surface  condition  is  calculated  within  HDM-4  based  on  typical \nmaintenance of an interstate highway. With the Project, the improved road section will be of a \nquality appropriate for the north\u2013south corridor and for the main approach to Yerevan from the \nnorth, directly improving accessibility between the two largest cities of Yerevan and Gyumri, and \nbetween Armenia and the subregion. The Project will facilitate business and reduce the cost of \ndoing business. As rural roads are being improved under the ADB and other external assistance, \nthe  accessibility  of  rural  areas  to  international  markets  through  the  improved  north\u2013south \ncorridor will be improved, providing all-weather access, faster travel, lower operating costs, and \nexport of agro-based products.  \n \n11.  The EIRR is estimated at 16.8% and the net present value at $12.4 million (Table A12.4). \nThe cost and benefit streams over the analysis period are in Table A12.5. \n ", "Appendix 12  59\n \nTable A12.4: Construction Cost and Economic Analysis Results \n    Economic         \nLength  Cost  2009  NPV \nLocation  (km)  ($ million)  IRI  AADT  EIRR  ($ million)\nYerevan \u2013 Ashtarak  18.4  29.6  5.4  11,680  16.8  12.4 \nAADT = annual average daily traffic, EIRR = economic rate of return, IRI = international roughness index, km = \nkilometer, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A12.5: Cost and Benefit Stream \n($ million) \nCost Benefit\nInitial Periodic\u00a0Maintenance Total VOC Time\u00a0 Total Net\nYear Investment With Without Cost Saving Saving Benefit Benefit\n2010 8.87 0.00 0.00 8.87 0.00 0.00 0.00 (8.87)\n2011 14.79 0.00 3.59 11.20 0.79 0.40 1.20 (10.00)\n2012 5.91 0.00 0.00 5.91 0.94 0.49 1.43 (4.48)\n2013 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.27 0.08 1.35 1.35\n2014 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.62 0.31 1.93 1.93\n2015 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 2.04 0.60 2.64 2.64\n2016 0.00 0.00 3.59 (3.59) 2.54 0.98 3.51 7.10\n2017 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1.88 0.29 2.18 2.18\n2018 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 2.39 0.65 3.04 3.04\n2019 0.00 2.76 0.00 2.76 3.00 1.10 4.10 1.34\n2020 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 3.62 1.69 5.31 5.31\n2021 0.00 0.00 3.59 (3.59) 4.48 2.44 6.92 10.50\n2022 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 3.15 1.07 4.23 4.23\n2023 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 3.95 1.79 5.74 5.74\n2024 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 4.92 2.71 7.63 7.63\n2025 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 6.06 3.87 9.92 9.92\n2026 0.00 2.76 3.59 (0.83) 7.41 5.26 12.68 13.50\n2027 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 6.13 2.63 8.75 8.75\n2028 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 7.67 4.00 11.67 11.67\n2029 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 9.46 5.77 15.23 15.23\n2030 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 11.68 7.72 19.40 19.40\n2031 0.00 0.00 3.59 (3.59) 14.36 10.46 24.82 28.41\n2032 (8.87) 0.00 0.00 (8.87) 17.52 13.83 31.35 40.22\nEIRR 16.8%\nNPV 12.4\n \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n12.

The  Government  of  Armenia  has  developed  a  North\u2013South  Road  Corridor  Investment \nProgram (the Investment Program) that will rehabilitate, improve, or construct the north-south road \ncorridor in various regions of Armenia. The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) will be \nthe executing agency and the Armenian Roads Directorate (ARD) will be the implementing agency. \nThe Government has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help finance the Investment \nProgram through a multitranche financing facility (MFF) up to the equivalent of $500 million and to be \nimplemented in tranches. \n \n2.  The Investment Program appraisal includes the appraisal of Tranche 1 Project that will \nreconstruct an 18.4-kilometer (km), four-lane section of the Yerevan\u2013Ashtarak road and not entail \nland acquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts. However, tranche 2 and 3 projects are expected \nto have substantial LAR impacts. The Investment Program will not cause impacts on indigenous \npeople, as in Armenia there is no group that, based on the indigenous people definition of the \nADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), can be classified as such. \n  \nB.  General Procedures \n3.  LAR will be carried out according to the relevant laws of Armenia, ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), Operations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement (2006) and the \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  framework  (LARF)  prepared  by  ARD  for  the  Investment \nProgram. Based on ADB policy and practice, the appraisal of the MFF and of each tranche and \napproval of each project implementation will entail the following LAR-related conditions: \n(i)   MFF Tranche 1 Project appraisal: Conditional on preparation/disclosure of a land \nacquisition and resettlement framework for the MFF acceptable to ADB and the land \nacquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs) for all tranche projects requiring LAR. \n(ii)   Tranches 2 and 3 periodic financing request (PFR) approval: Conditional on \nLARF review/update, and preparation/disclosure of LARPs fitting the updated LARF \nfor roads with LAR. \n(iii)  Contract  awards  signing:  Conditional  on  the  preparation/disclosure  of \nupdated/implementation-ready  LARPs  approved  by  ADB  and  reflecting  final \nimpacts, affected persons lists, and official compensation rates. \n(iv)  Provision  of  notice  to  proceed  to  contractors:  Conditional  on  full \nimplementation  of  LARP  (full  delivery  of  compensation/rehabilitation)  for  the \nrelevant project. Such a condition will be clearly defined in the text of the civil \nworks contract. \n \n4.  Based  on  the  above,  appraisal,  signing  of  contract  awards  and  civil  works \nimplementation for each individual project or subproject are conditional on the following: \n \n(i)  Appraisal: (a) approval of the LARF and the LARP by ADB and Government, \nand (b) full disclosure of this LARP to the affected persons. \n(ii)  Contract awards signing and LARP implementation: (a) update of the final \nLARP  based  on  detail  design  as  indicated  in  para.  3,  (b)  disclosure  of  the \nupdated  LARP  to  the  affected  persons,  and  (c)  mobilization  of  the  external \nmonitoring agency. The updated LARPs will reflect final impacts, final affected \npersons lists, and final compensation rates, and will be readily implementable.  \n ", "62  Appendix 13 \n(iii)  Provision of no-objection to initiation of civil works: (a) full implementation of \nthe compensation program described in this LARP, including the full delivery of \ncompensation to the affected persons; and (b) preparation of a compliance report \nby the external monitoring agency.  \n \n5.  To meet these conditions, ARD has prepared a LARF for the MFF. No LARP was prepared \nfor Tranche 1 Project as it has no LAR impacts. \n \nC.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework \n6.  The LARF lists the following principles: (i) LAR will be avoided or at least minimized, (ii) \ncompensation will guarantee the maintenance of the pre-Investment Program living standards of \nthe people affected, (iii) those affected will be fully informed/consulted on compensation options, (iv) \nthe sociocultural institutions of those people will be supported and used, (v) LAR provisions will \nequally apply to women and men, (vi) lack of formal title will not be a bar to compensation/rehabilitation, \n(vii) particular attention will be paid to households headed by women and to vulnerable groups, (viii) \nLAR will be conceived and executed as an integral part of the Investment Program and LAR \nbudgets will be included in the costs of the Investment Program, and (ix) compensation will be fully \nprovided prior to ground leveling and demolition. The LARF also covers all issues relevant to \neffectively conducting LAR tasks in compliance with ADB policy and sets the eligibility/entitlement \nprovisions detailed in Table A13. \n \nTable A13: Compensation Matrix \nType of Loss  Application   Definition of Affected Persons  Compensation Entitlements \nPermanent loss of Affected  Owner with full registration   Compensation at market rate plus 15% either in \nagricultural land  person losing  cash or through replacement plots acceptable to the \n  agricultural  affected persons. \nland regardless Unregistered persons with  Affected persons will be legalized and provided the \nof impact  ownership rights  same compensation as registered owner. \nseverity   Informal settlers/ affected persons  One-time self-relocation allowance in cash equal to 1 \nwith no registration/valid  year at minimum salary. \ndocumentation \nNon-agricultural  Affected  Owner with full registration  Compensation at market rate plus 15% either in \nland  person losing  cash of through replacement plots acceptable to the \ntheir  affected persons. \ncommercial/  Unregistered persons with  Affected persons will be legalized and provided the \nresidential land  ownership rights  same compensation as registered owner. \nRenter/leaseholder  Rental allowances in cash for 3 months \nInformal settlers/ affected persons  One-time self-relocation allowance in cash equal to 1 \nwithout registration/valid  year at minimum salary \ndocumentation \nResidential    All affected person irrespective of  Cash compensation plus 15% for loss of houses at \nbuildings  registration status   full replacement cost free of depreciation/transaction \ncosts.

Eligibility \n \n7.  Affected persons  entitled to compensation or at least rehabilitation under the Investment \nProgram are \n(i)  all affected persons losing land either covered by legal title/traditional land rights, \nunregistered persons with ownership rights, or without legal status; \n(ii)  tenants and sharecroppers whether registered or not; \n(iii)  owners of buildings, crops, plants, or other objects attached to the land; and \n(iv)  affected persons losing business, income, and salaries. \n \n8.  Compensation eligibility will be limited by a cut-off date, which is the date of affected \nperson census carried out during the preratioon of each of subsequent tranche projects under \nthe Investment Program. Affected persons who settle in the affected areas after the cut-off date \nwill not be eligible for compensation. They will, however, be given sufficient advance notice, \nrequested to vacate premises, and dismantle affected structures prior to implementation. Their \ndismantled structures materials will not be confiscated and they will not pay any fine or suffer \nany sanction. \n \n9.  Institutional  Responsibilities.  MOTC/ARD  has  overall  responsibility  for  LARP \npreparation,  implementation,  and  financing  and  will  exercise  its  functions  through  a  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  unit  (LARU)  tasked  with  management,  planning,  and \nimplementation of land acquisition and resettlement works. The LARU will be aided by a social \nsafeguard team under the supervision consultants. ARD will coordinate with local governments \nthat have jurisdiction over land administration/title verification, and the independent assessors \nresponsible for asset valuation. Apart from ARD and local governments, the Ministry of Finance \n ", "64  Appendix 13 \nwill be responsible for providing LAR funds to ARD and the State Committee of Real Estate will \nbe responsible for all legal matters regarding land ownership and with the legalization of eligible \naffected persons. The LARU will be assisted in preparing the LARPs by resettlement specialists \nunder the design contracts.  \n \n10.  Disclosure  and  Consultation.  LAR  tasks  will  require  intensive  consultations  with \naffected persons, the results of which will be fully documented in the LARPs. As an appraisal \ncondition, LARF and LARPs in English will be disclosed on the ADB website. The LARF and the \nLARPs in Armenian will be disclosed on ARD's website and at local government offices. A \npamphlet in Armenian summarizing the LARPs will be sent to all affected persons. \n \n11.  Grievance  Procedures.  Grievances  will  be  first  handled  at  the  village  level  with \ninvolvement of the rayon (district) government. If no solution is reached, the persons affected \nwill raise the complaint to ARD's regional office. If no settlement is reached, the case can be \nbrought to the central ARD. If the grievance remains unsettled, the persons affected will be able \nto seek redress at the communal court.  \n \n12.  Monitoring and Evaluation. ARD will monitor implementation of the LAR and will report \nto  ADB  through  quarterly  progress  reports.  External  monitoring  will  be  carried  out  by  an \nindependent agency, who will prepare a compliance report at the end of the implementation of \nthe LARP for each tranche project under the Investment Program. \n \n8.  Finances and Schedules. The LARF prescribes that each LARP detail LAR budgets and \nprovide clear schedules linking LAR tasks with the initiation of civil works. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090930150602+08'00'", "Subject": "Reports and Recommendations of the President", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "north-south road corridor investment, armenian roads directorate, ministry of transport communications, adb technical assistance 7208, adb project 42145, rrp: arm 42145", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091001122524+08'00'", "Title": "North-South Road Corridor Investment Program"}, "author_page": " \nVice-President  X.
