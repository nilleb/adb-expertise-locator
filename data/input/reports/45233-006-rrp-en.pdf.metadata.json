THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the additional financing of the Social Protection Development \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing will help the Government of Pakistan continue to \nsupport the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), the country\u2019s primary social protection \nprogram and one of the largest social protection programs in South Asia, against the backdrop of \nthe difficult macroeconomic situation the country faces.2 The support will (i) enable disbursement \nof unconditional cash transfer (UCT) payments to eligible BISP beneficiaries; and (ii) further \nimprove  BISP\u2019s  capacity  for  financial  management  and  control,  and  policy  research,  data \nanalytics and intervention design. The additional financing modality is considered appropriate \ngiven strong links with the original project in terms of design and implementation arrangements \nand resultant productivity gains. This support is aligned to the government\u2019s Ehsaas poverty \nalleviation program3 and one of the key operational priorities of Strategy 2030 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB): addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, with a focus \non strengthening social protection systems and service delivery for those in need.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Macroeconomic  challenges.  While  economic  growth  has  been  relatively  high\u2014\naveraging close to 5% during 2014\u20132019\u2014the government needs to address large budget and \ncurrent account deficits, rising debt obligations, and falling foreign exchange reserves. On 12 May \n2019, a $6 billion 39-month extended fund facility (EFF) arrangement for Pakistan was reached \nwith the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 5 Under the EFF, the IMF and development partners \nwill support the government\u2019s efforts to position the economy on the path of sustainable and \nbalanced growth and increased per capita income through a targeted fiscal consolidation program \nto help reduce public debt and build resilience while expanding social spending to support the \nmost vulnerable. The EFF emphasizes the importance of the BISP, recognizing that fiscal \nconsolidation will entail reductions in public expenditure programs that could have an adverse \nimpact  on  the  poor  and  most  vulnerable.  Given  the  weak  macroeconomic  backdrop,  and \nconsistent with the IMF\u2019s policy advice, the additional financing provides timely support to the \ngovernment by continuing to support activities under the current project such as UCTs that \nprovide a financial cushion to the poorest sections of society.6 \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019.

Washington, DC. \n6  Detailed Sector Assessment: BISP and Pakistan Social Protection Agenda (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). Currently, Rs.5,000 (or around $31.50) per beneficiary family is being paid each quarter. \nThe government announced in March 2019 that this would increase to Rs.5,500 per quarter from the July-September \n2019 quarter. However, the formal instructions from the Ministry of Finance are yet to be issued. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  Poverty and human development. Despite substantial reductions in poverty rates during \n2001\u20132015, a quarter of the population remains below the poverty line. Rural poverty remains \nmore than twice as high as urban poverty, with rural areas still accounting for 80% of poor \nindividuals, a share that is unchanged since 2001. In addition, 24.3% of the population of 200 \nmillion live under the poverty line, and a further 10% are near-poor and highly vulnerable to shocks \nthat could pull them below the poverty line. Persistent cycles of low human capital investment, \nespecially for women, and poor health outcomes are the main factors behind this chronic \nintergenerational poverty and continued gender inequality.7 Despite its lower-middle-income \nstatus, Pakistan remains one of the lowest performers in human capital development in South \nAsia. It ranks the highest in South Asia and the third highest globally in stunting and wasting rates, \nwith almost half of under-5 children being stunted. Almost 23 million children are out of school.8 \nHealth outcomes in Pakistan remain poor, with one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in the \nregion at 178 per 100,000 live births. While communicable diseases continue to be a concern \n(Pakistan has the second highest global burden of hepatitis C and the sixth highest global burden \nof tuberculosis), noncommunicable chronic diseases now account for over half of all deaths.9 In \naddition, health care expenditure remains a critical risk factor for keeping people in poverty or \npulling people into poverty. Out-of-pocket health care expenditure, for example, accounts for two-\nthirds of all health care expenditure in Pakistan.10 \n \n5.  National social protection and poverty reduction strategy. In April 2019, the Prime \nMinister launched the Ehsaas program. The program is specifically targeted at: \u201cextreme poor, \norphans, widows, the homeless, the disabled, those who risk medical impoverishment, for the \njobless, for poor farmers, for laborers, for the sick and undernourished; for students from low-\nincome backgrounds and for poor women and elderly citizens.\u201d The Ehsaas program contains \nfour pillars: (i) addressing elite capture and making the government system work for equality, (ii) \nsafety nets, (iii) human capital development, and (iv) jobs and livelihoods. The BISP supports \npillar 2, which provide cash transfers, poverty graduation programs, and a targeted safety net. \nThe BISP is also expanding its support to pillar 3, with conditional cash transfers (CCTs) for \neducation, health, and nutrition. As of January 2019, the BISP had disbursed a cumulative total \nof $3.6 billion through UCTs to over 5.6 million families. The BISP plans to gradually expand this \ncoverage to 7 million households (the poorest 20% of the population).11 \n \n6.  The current project. The Social Protection Development Project loan was approved on \n22 October 2013.12 The loan agreement and the project agreement were signed on 25 November \n2013, and the loan became effective on 24 June 2014. The current closing date of the loan is 30 \nJune 2022. The current project was restructured through a minor change in scope on 8 December \n2017 with three outputs: (i) cash transfer program coverage expanded (output 1), (ii) the BISP \ngraduation program implemented (new output 2), and (iii) financial management and control \nsystems and policy research improved (new output 3). As of June 2019, the Social Protection \nDevelopment Project has enabled the enrollment of 855,052 beneficiaries (about 15% of the total \n5.6 million eligible beneficiaries) that are eligible for 10 quarterly payments.13 \n                                                \n7  ADB.

Performance  of  current  project.  The  Social  Protection  Development  Project  is \nperforming well. As of 25 June 2019, the project was assessed as (i) delivering expected outputs, \n(ii) showing satisfactory implementation progress, (iii) on track in ADB\u2019s project performance \nmonitoring system, (iv) complied with in terms of safeguards policy compliance, and (v) successful \nin terms of management of risks. ADB allocated SDR283,776,000 (about $394,537,000 as of 25 \nJune 2019) to the project.14 Of this amount, 84% (about $331.4 million) was allocated for UCT; \n9% (about $37.6 million) for the BISP graduation program; and 7% (about $25.5 million) for other \ncosts, including interest charges. As of 25 June 2019, the total disbursed amount was $383.9 \nmillion (about 97.3% of total available funds), with cumulative contract award of $325.9 million. \nThe investments in UCTs have had positive impacts through the reduction in the poverty rate by \n3 percentage points. Impact evaluation studies report empowerment of women in terms of \nelevated household status and improved mobility outside the home, overall reduction in the \ndependence of beneficiary households on casual labor, and an increase in the proportion of \nbeneficiary households that own small livestock.15 \n \n8.  Safeguard  compliance.  Compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements  is  rated \nsatisfactory.  The  current  project  was  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). There have been no project activities resulting in or leading to involuntary resettlement, \nor that have negatively affected indigenous peoples or the environment. Since the project did not \nsupport any physical intervention, no land acquisition was required. In addition, the project is \nclassified with a gender equity theme since its beneficiaries are all women and its focus is on \nempowering women. \n \n9.  Management of risks. The current project is performing well, no integrity concerns have \nbeen raised, and the procurement risk level is rated moderate. The pre-mitigation financial \nmanagement risk level rating remains substantial. BISP has implemented a number of measures \nduring 2014\u20132019 to safeguard against risks of error, fraud, and corruption.16 However, efforts to \nimprove financial management, internal control and risk management need to remain a high \npriority given its importance to Government\u2019s social protection agenda and the level of funding it \nreceives from the national budget (around $1.1 billion in FY2020).17 This approach is in line with \noperational priority 6 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which focuses on strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity, and emphasizes the importance of strong financial management systems \nand controls for successful development outcomes. \n \n10.  Government support for BISP. The government has renewed its commitment to the \nBISP against a backdrop of significant macroeconomic challenges (para. 3). The additional \nfinancing will scale up the scope of the current project to include (i) continuation of UCT payments \nunder  the  BISP  to  cushion  the  impacts  of  these  macroeconomic  challenges,  (ii)  further \nimprovements in financial management and control systems of the BISP to support these UCTs, \nand (iii) strengthening of policy research functions in line with the Ehsaas program (para. 5). The \nadditional financing will also provide an invaluable opportunity to set the direction of ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n5 to 10 as a large number of eligible beneficiaries could not be enrolled due to a discrepancy in their data\u2014primarily \nthe absence of a computerized national identity card or CNIC. \n14 This was 6% less than the initial ADB Board-approved project amount of $430 million, because of changes in the \nSDR conversion rate. \n15 Oxford Policy Management. 2016.

Social protection beyond UCTs. The intervention highlighted in the figure is important \nfor the government and ADB because reviews of UCT show that while they provide a financial \ncushion for the poor, improve household consumption, and increase women\u2019s empowerment, \nthey  have  limited  impact  on  the  reduction  of  poverty.  In  light  of  these  findings  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s renewed commitment to poverty reduction and social protection through the Ehsaas \nprogram, the BISP is expanding its approach and is looking at alternate modalities that target the \nimprovement of human capital, including poverty graduation programs and CCTs, based on global \nbest practices. There is considerable international evidence that CCTs are helpful in addressing \nbehavioral factors in the areas of elementary education and health sectors. In addition to providing \na financial cushion for the poor, CCTs also aim to provide a further impact by encouraging the \naccumulation of human capital of children through improved health, education, and nutrition, \nwhich have been shown to be the key drivers of poverty reduction. Improved human capital leads \nto a decrease in intergenerational poverty. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The overall aggregate impact and outcome for the overall project remains the same as the \ncurrent project. The project is aligned with the following impact: income poverty and non-income \n                                                \n18 ADB. Forthcoming.

Outputs \n \n13.  The additional financing will scale up outputs 1 and 3 of the current project: cash transfer \nprogram coverage expanded (output 1) and financial management and control systems and policy \nresearch improved (output 3). ADB value addition is produced through diagnostic and technical \nsupport to help BISP improve its financial management and control systems and deepen its \nknowledge of global best practices in social protection and poverty reduction to help it move \nbeyond UCTs to programs that improve human capital and reduce intergenerational poverty. \n \n14.  A detailed description of activities under outputs 1 and 3 that will be funded by the \nadditional financing follows: \n(i)  Continue  unconditional  cash  transfers  (Output  1).  UCTs  have  been \ninstrumental in cushioning the financial shock of slowing economic growth, rapid \ninflation, and increasing food prices on the poor, particularly women. The additional \nfinancing will continue to support UCT payments to eligible BISP beneficiaries for \nsix  quarterly  installments  from  April  2019  onwards,  which  will  thereafter  be \ncontinued through the government\u2019s own resources.20 \n(ii)  Institutional strengthening: addressing error, fraud, and corruption (Output \n3). The government recognizes that institutional strengthening of the BISP is \ncritical given the large volume of public funds that it is responsible for. Based on \nvarious external reviews, including the recent recommendations of the assessment \nof error, fraud and corruption controls in BISP\u2019s cash transfer programs (footnote \n16), the BISP has highlighted the following high-priority reforms that could be \nsupported under the additional financing: \n(a)  working with beneficiary communities to increase their awareness of UCTs \nand their ability to navigate within it to minimize leakage of funds at the \ncommunity level; \n(b)  introducing and  publicizing  reliable  whistle-blowing  hotlines  and  social \nmedia platforms; \n(c)  expanding  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities  to  explicitly  include \nreporting on error, fraud, and corruption;  \n(d)  developing a policy for obtaining repayment of money obtained by fraud or \ncorruption\u2014in  addition  to  sanctions  applied  for  offending  employees, \nbanks and beneficiaries; and \n(e)  develop and implement a comprehensive Risk Management Framework \nthat strengthens financial management and improves detection of error, \nfraud and corruption risk.  \n(iii)  Institutional strengthening: policy research (Output 3). The BISP is keen to \nestablish a policy research unit (PRU) to help it transition from its UCT-oriented \napproach to one that will have a greater impact on reducing intergenerational \n                                                \n19 Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission. 2007.

The final payment for \nthis group is scheduled for Quarter 1 2021. The additional financing will cover six quarterly UCT payments amounting \nto around $166 million for the remaining 800,052 beneficiaries.

The government will contribute an estimated $4.5 million for overheads for processing \nof UCT payments, administrative expenses, office space, costs of running the PRU, and taxes \nand duties financed by the government, and approximately $11 million for interest charges during \nimplementation. The financing plan is in Table 2 and further detailed in the project administration \nmanual (PAM).22 \n \n                                                \n21 The interest includes a maturity premium of 10 basis points.

For fiscal year 2020 (ending \nJune), the overall program cost is budgeted at $1.1 billion. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n17.  A small-scale technical assistance (TA) amounting to $225,000 and financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) was approved on 30 \nAugust 2019. The TA will support the engagement of additional consultant resources to help \ndevelop  detailed  design  of  interventions  for  (i)  policy  research  strengthening,  including \ndeveloping  a  work  plan for priority  areas for  policy  research,  (ii) strengthening financial \nmanagement and internal controls and the error, fraud and corruption mitigation, and (iii) \nstrategic decision making through the development of a strategic business plan for BISP that \nwill focus on improving BISP\u2019s role in supporting the Ehsaas program. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Procurement of goods, consulting, and non-consulting services under the additional \nfinancing shall follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nProcurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and detailed in the PAM. The additional \nfinancing will not alter the existing implementation arrangements except for the inclusion of new \nactivities such as the establishment of the PRU. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements  \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period   October 2019\u2013September 2022 \nEstimated completion date   30 September 2022 (loan closing date: 31 March 2023)  \nManagement    \n(i) Executing agency   BISP  \n(ii) Implementing agency   BISP  \n(iii) Implementation unit   BISP-PRU, DG (Cash Transfer), DG (Internal Audit), DG (Finance & \nAccounts) and heads of other relevant wings. \nProcurement of Goods  RFQ  20 contracts  $0.2 million \nConsulting services  ICS  244 person-months  $1.5 million \n  Firms  5 contracts using  $3.6 million \nQCBS, 90:10 and 1 \ncontract using LCS  \nRetroactive financing and advance  The government has also requested retroactive financing (subject to the \ncontracting   ceiling of 20% of the loan amount) to cover the financing of UCT payments for \nADB Beneficiaries for up to two quarters from April to September 2019. \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the Government of Pakistan and ADB. \n ", "8 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BISP = Benazir Income Support Program, DG = Director General, ICS = individual \nconsulting selection, PRU = policy research unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, RFQ= Request For \nQuotation, UCT = unconditional cash transfer.,  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19.  The overall procurement management risk is classified moderate because of inclusion of \nadditional  procurement resources  in  the  BISP to  ensure  timely  completion  of  procurement \nactivities for the current project, as well as for the additional financing. The strategic procurement \nplan, attached to the PAM, was developed to ensure value for money by choosing appropriate \nbid packaging, bidding procedures, bid documents, and contract modalities. Research institutes \nor firms will be recruited following the quality- and cost-based selection method. As the scope of \nservices will be developed during implementation, if necessary, other appropriate selection \nmethods, including different types of contract modalities, will be determined at a later stage. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n20.  Since the additional financing will finance a change in project scope, due diligence on \neconomic, financial, procurement, safeguard, capacity, social, and poverty aspects for the current \nproject have all been updated.23 Staff and technical assistance resources were mobilized to \nensure timely preparation of high-quality due diligence documentation. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  All outputs and activities supported under this additional financing project are expected to \nresult in economic and financial benefits for beneficiaries. These benefits are derived from (i) \nGovernment\u2019s implementation of the EFF, which is expected to improve its fiscal position and, in \nturn, Government\u2019s ability to fund critical social and economic infrastructure investments (para. \n6), and (ii) the activities financed by the additional financing, that is, continued UCT payments and \nstrengthened institutional capacity for improved financial management and control and policy \nresearch functions for cost effective and evidence-based decision making.  \n \n22.  Improved public finances and reduced public debt will create fiscal space for an increase \nin social spending to strengthen social protection as well as infrastructure and human capital \ndevelopment. The FY2020 national budget announced on 11 June incorporates agreed EFF \nmeasures. The primary deficit is slightly higher compared to FY2019. While this would ordinarily \nmean there is limited room for new policies, there is a 52% increase in expenditure for the Ehsaas \nprogram including BISP. This is expected to help cushion the poor from shocks and the short-\nterm impact of economic reforms.24 On the revenue side, the 34.8% increase in net revenue for \nthe  federal  government  includes  increases  in  recurrent  revenues  and  other  revenues  (for \nexample, royalties and dividends) and reductions in tax expenditure (for example, concessions \nand incentives). There are no planned increases in indirect taxes that could adversely affect the \npoor and near poor (example, the sales tax will remain at 17%). \n \n23.  Continuing UCT payments and improved institutional strengthening will, in the short term, \nimprove income and consumption-related poverty and vulnerability, and, in the long-run, generate \nbroader socio-economic benefits through the development of human capital, which is a pre-\nrequisite for reducing intergenerational poverty. UCTs can yield fiscal savings for the government \nin the medium- to long-term and can have important positive multiplier effect, including improved \n                                                \n23 These updated assessments can all be accessed from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n24 Recent data on income distribution for Pakistan suggest that income share of the poorest 20% of the population fell \nsharply from 9.8% to 5.9% during FY2013-FY2016, that is, during the implementation of the previous IMF program. \n ", "9 \ncontributions to income tax revenue. Finally, although the BISP is subject to regular evaluation, \nthere is need for improvement in financial management and controls. Overall, efficiency and \nproductivity gains from reforms in these areas will help improve: (i) error, fraud and corruption \nmitigation, (ii) beneficiary awareness about their cash payments, and (iii) policy research for cost \neffective and evidence-based programs. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n24.  BISP is the flagship social protection program of Government and is one of the most \nextensively documented and evaluated program in the public sector in Pakistan. Its expansion \nhas been accompanied by key developments such as: (i) switching from community-based \ntargeting to more effective targeting using a proxy means test-based poverty score cards, (ii) \ndeveloping one of the largest databases of poor households (the National Socio-Economic \nRegistry), and (iii) increasing the use of personal identification number (or PIN) controlled debit \ncards or biometric verification card-less system for payments to beneficiaries. However, further \nwork is needed in specific areas, in particular, timely completion and submission of audited \nfinancial statements. For example, the FY2017 and FY2018 audited entity financial statements \nand management letters were received with significant delays. Other high priority measures \ninclude undertaking regular analysis of payment complaints to identify causes and trends and \nimprove detection of suspected cases of corruption, and appointing specialist investigators to \ninvestigate  occurrences  of  corruption  (footnote  15).  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and BISP. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social and Gender \n \n25.  Pakistan has a large informal economy, limited employment opportunities in formal labor \nmarkets, inadequate insurance schemes, and an increasing trend of natural and manmade \ndisasters, all which make the country\u2019s poor highly susceptible to falling below the poverty line. \nAdditional support to the BISP will ensure the continuity of UCT and provide relief to the extreme \npoor. In addition, Pakistan was ranked second from last in the 2018 Global Gender Gap Index, \nsurpassing only Yemen.25 Sociocultural constraints on girls\u2019 and women\u2019s access to health, \neducation, training, jobs, financing, and ease of mobility have led to high levels of gender \ninequality and poverty. The overall literacy rate for women in Pakistan is 51.8%, compared to an \nalready low 72.5% for men. This is even lower in rural areas, with 40.5% for women compared to \n66.3% for men.26 Labor force statistics show that labor force participation is 25% for females \ncompared to 82% for males (ages 15 and above). Pakistan\u2019s female labor force participation rate \nis among the lowest in the world and in South Asia. Employment for women is mostly in the \ninformal economy, estimated to be about 72% of the economy. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n26.  Following  ADB\u2019s Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  project  classification  of  C  for  the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples is retained (para. 8). In addition, \nthe project is classified with a gender equity theme (para. 8). Since the additional financing will \nnot support any physical intervention, land acquisition is not required. \n \n                                                \n25 World Economic Forum. 2018.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n28.  The government and the BISP have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n29.  The government and the BISP have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n30.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the additional financing of the Social \nProtection Development Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n3 September 2019\n                                                \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB staff will monitor the implementation of mitigating measures on a regular basis. \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n \nCurrent project \nIncome poverty and non-income poverty for poor families in Pakistan reduced (2007 National Social Protection \nStrategy)a \n \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n \nResults Chain  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and Reporting  Risks \nwith Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms \nOutcome  By 2023:  a\u2013c.
