The  additional  financing  modality  is  considered  appropriate \ngiven strong links with the original project in terms of design and implementation arrangements \nand  resultant  productivity  gains.  This  support  is  aligned  to  the  government\u2019s  Ehsaas  poverty \nalleviation  program 3 and  one  of  the  key  operational  priorities  of  Strategy  2030  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB): addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, with a focus \non strengthening social protection systems and service delivery for those in need.4 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nMacroeconomic  challenges.  While  economic  growth  has  been  relatively  high\u2014\naveraging close to 5% during 2014\u20132019\u2014the government needs to address large budget and \ncurrent account deficits, rising debt obligations, and falling foreign exchange reserves. On 12 May \n2019, a $6 billion 39-month extended fund facility (EFF) arrangement for Pakistan was reached \nwith the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 5 Under the EFF, the IMF and development partners \nwill  support  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  position  the  economy  on  the  path  of  sustainable  and \nbalanced growth and increased per capita income through a targeted fiscal consolidation program \nto help reduce public debt and build resilience while expanding social spending to support the \nmost  vulnerable.  The  EFF  emphasizes  the  importance  of  the  BISP,  recognizing  that  fiscal \nconsolidation  will  entail  reductions  in  public  expenditure  programs  that  could  have  an  adverse \nimpact  on  the  poor  and  most  vulnerable.  Given  the  weak  macroeconomic  backdrop,  and \nconsistent  with  the  IMF\u2019s  policy  advice,  the  additional  financing  provides  timely  support  to  the \ngovernment  by  continuing  to  support  activities  under  the  current  project  such  as  UCTs  that \nprovide a financial cushion to the poorest sections of society.6 \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2019.

Currently, Rs.5,000 (or around $31.50) per beneficiary family is being paid each quarter. \nThe government announced in March 2019 that this would increase to Rs.5,500 per quarter from the July-September \n2019 quarter. However, the formal instructions from the Ministry of Finance are yet to be issued. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and human development. Despite substantial reductions in poverty rates during \n4. \n2001\u20132015, a quarter of the population remains below the poverty line. Rural poverty remains \nmore  than  twice  as  high  as  urban  poverty,  with  rural  areas  still  accounting  for  80%  of  poor \nindividuals,  a share that is  unchanged  since  2001. In  addition,  24.3%  of the  population  of 200 \nmillion live under the poverty line, and a further 10% are near-poor and highly vulnerable to shocks \nthat could pull them below the poverty line. Persistent cycles of low human capital investment, \nespecially  for  women,  and  poor  health  outcomes  are  the  main  factors  behind  this  chronic \nintergenerational  poverty  and  continued  gender  inequality. 7  Despite  its  lower-middle-income \nstatus, Pakistan remains one of the lowest performers in human capital development in South \nAsia. It ranks the highest in South Asia and the third highest globally in stunting and wasting rates, \nwith almost half of under-5 children being stunted. Almost 23 million children are out of school.8 \nHealth outcomes in Pakistan remain poor, with one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in the \nregion  at  178  per  100,000  live  births. While  communicable  diseases  continue  to  be  a concern \n(Pakistan has the second highest global burden of hepatitis C and the sixth highest global burden \nof tuberculosis), noncommunicable chronic diseases now account for over half of all deaths.9 In \naddition,  health  care  expenditure remains  a  critical  risk factor for keeping  people  in  poverty  or \npulling people into poverty. Out-of-pocket health care expenditure, for example, accounts for two-\nthirds of all health care expenditure in Pakistan.10 \n \n5. \nNational  social  protection  and  poverty  reduction  strategy.  In  April  2019,  the  Prime \nMinister launched the Ehsaas program. The program is specifically targeted at: \u201cextreme poor, \norphans,  widows,  the  homeless,  the  disabled,  those  who  risk  medical  impoverishment,  for  the \njobless, for  poor farmers, for  laborers, for  the  sick  and  undernourished; for  students from  low-\nincome  backgrounds  and for  poor  women  and  elderly  citizens.\u201d The  Ehsaas  program  contains \nfour pillars: (i) addressing elite capture and making the government system work for equality, (ii) \nsafety  nets,  (iii)  human  capital  development,  and  (iv)  jobs  and  livelihoods.  The  BISP  supports \npillar 2, which provide cash transfers, poverty graduation programs, and a targeted safety net. \nThe  BISP  is  also  expanding  its  support  to  pillar  3,  with  conditional  cash  transfers  (CCTs)  for \neducation, health, and nutrition. As of January 2019, the BISP had disbursed a cumulative total \nof $3.6 billion through UCTs to over 5.6 million families. The BISP plans to gradually expand this \ncoverage to 7 million households (the poorest 20% of the population).11 \n \nThe current project. The Social Protection Development Project loan was approved on \n6. \n22 October 2013.12 The loan agreement and the project agreement were signed on 25 November \n2013, and the loan became effective on 24 June 2014. The current closing date of the loan is 30 \nJune 2022. The current project was restructured through a minor change in scope on 8 December \n2017 with three outputs: (i) cash transfer program coverage expanded (output 1), (ii) the BISP \ngraduation  program  implemented  (new  output  2),  and  (iii)  financial  management  and  control \nsystems  and  policy  research  improved  (new  output  3).  As  of  June  2019,  the  Social  Protection \nDevelopment Project has enabled the enrollment of 855,052 beneficiaries (about 15% of the total \n5.6 million eligible beneficiaries) that are eligible for 10 quarterly payments.13 \n                                                 \n7  ADB.

Manila. \n\n13  The current project envisaged the enrolment of 2.4 million new eligible beneficiaries for the cash transfer program. \nHowever, this number was subsequently reduced to 855,092 and the number of quarterly payments increased from \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPerformance  of  current  project.  The  Social  Protection  Development  Project  is \n7. \nperforming well. As of 25 June 2019, the project was assessed as (i) delivering expected outputs, \n(ii)  showing  satisfactory  implementation  progress,  (iii)  on  track  in  ADB\u2019s  project  performance \nmonitoring system, (iv) complied with in terms of safeguards policy compliance, and (v) successful \nin terms of management of risks. ADB allocated SDR283,776,000 (about $394,537,000 as of 25 \nJune 2019) to the project.14 Of this amount, 84% (about $331.4 million) was allocated for UCT; \n9% (about $37.6 million) for the BISP graduation program; and 7% (about $25.5 million) for other \ncosts,  including  interest charges.  As  of  25  June 2019,  the  total  disbursed  amount  was  $383.9 \nmillion (about 97.3% of total available funds), with cumulative contract award of $325.9 million. \nThe investments in UCTs have had positive impacts through the reduction in the poverty rate by \n3  percentage  points.  Impact  evaluation  studies  report  empowerment  of  women  in  terms  of \nelevated  household  status  and  improved  mobility  outside  the  home,  overall  reduction  in  the \ndependence  of  beneficiary  households  on  casual  labor,  and  an  increase  in  the  proportion  of \nbeneficiary households that own small livestock.15 \n \n8. \nSafeguard  compliance.  Compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements  is  rated \nsatisfactory.  The  current  project  was  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009). There have been no project activities resulting in or leading to involuntary resettlement, \nor that have negatively affected indigenous peoples or the environment. Since the project did not \nsupport  any  physical  intervention,  no  land  acquisition  was  required.  In  addition,  the  project  is \nclassified  with  a  gender equity  theme  since  its  beneficiaries  are  all  women  and  its focus  is  on \nempowering women. \n \nManagement of risks. The current project is performing well, no integrity concerns have \n9. \nbeen  raised,  and  the  procurement  risk  level  is  rated  moderate.  The  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement risk level rating remains substantial. BISP has implemented a number of measures \nduring 2014\u20132019 to safeguard against risks of error, fraud, and corruption.16 However, efforts to \nimprove  financial  management, internal  control  and  risk  management  need  to  remain  a  high \npriority given its importance to Government\u2019s social protection agenda and the level of funding it \nreceives from the national budget (around $1.1 billion in FY2020).17 This approach is in line with \noperational priority 6 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which focuses on strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity, and emphasizes the importance of strong financial management systems \nand controls for successful development outcomes. \n \n10. \nGovernment  support  for  BISP.  The  government  has  renewed  its  commitment  to  the \nBISP  against  a  backdrop  of  significant  macroeconomic  challenges  (para.  3).  The  additional \nfinancing will scale up the scope of the current project to include (i) continuation of UCT payments \nunder  the  BISP  to  cushion  the  impacts  of  these  macroeconomic  challenges,  (ii)  further \nimprovements in financial management and control systems of the BISP to support these UCTs, \nand (iii) strengthening of policy research functions in line with the Ehsaas program (para. 5). The \nadditional  financing  will  also  provide  an  invaluable  opportunity  to  set  the  direction  of  ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                 \n\n5 to 10 as a large number of eligible beneficiaries could not be enrolled due to a discrepancy in their data\u2014primarily \nthe absence of a computerized national identity card or CNIC. \n\n14 This was 6% less than the initial ADB Board-approved project amount of $430 million, because of changes in the \n\nSDR conversion rate. \n\n15 Oxford Policy Management. 2016.

The intervention highlighted in the figure is important \nfor the government and ADB because reviews of UCT show that while they provide a financial \ncushion  for  the  poor,  improve  household  consumption,  and  increase  women\u2019s  empowerment, \nthey  have  limited  impact  on  the  reduction  of  poverty.  In  light  of  these  findings  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s renewed commitment to poverty reduction and social protection through the Ehsaas \nprogram, the BISP is expanding its approach and is looking at alternate modalities that target the \nimprovement of human capital, including poverty graduation programs and CCTs, based on global \nbest practices. There is considerable international evidence that CCTs are helpful in addressing \nbehavioral factors in the areas of elementary education and health sectors. In addition to providing \na financial cushion for the poor, CCTs also aim to provide a further impact by encouraging the \naccumulation  of  human  capital  of  children  through  improved  health,  education,  and  nutrition, \nwhich have been shown to be the key drivers of poverty reduction. Improved human capital leads \nto a decrease in intergenerational poverty. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe overall aggregate impact and outcome for the overall project remains the same as the \ncurrent project.

The  government  recognizes  that  institutional  strengthening  of  the  BISP  is \ncritical given the large volume of public funds that it is responsible for. Based on \nvarious external reviews, including the recent recommendations of the assessment \nof error, fraud and corruption controls in BISP\u2019s cash transfer programs (footnote \n16),  the  BISP  has  highlighted  the  following  high-priority  reforms  that  could  be \nsupported under the additional financing: \n(a) \n\nworking with beneficiary communities to increase their awareness of UCTs \nand  their  ability  to  navigate  within  it  to  minimize  leakage  of  funds  at  the \ncommunity level; \nintroducing  and  publicizing  reliable  whistle-blowing  hotlines  and  social \nmedia platforms; \nexpanding  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities  to  explicitly  include \nreporting on error, fraud, and corruption;  \ndeveloping a policy for obtaining repayment of money obtained by fraud or \ncorruption\u2014in  addition  to  sanctions  applied  for  offending  employees, \nbanks and beneficiaries; and \ndevelop  and  implement  a  comprehensive  Risk  Management  Framework \nthat  strengthens  financial  management  and  improves  detection  of  error, \nfraud and corruption risk.  \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(iii) \n\nInstitutional  strengthening:  policy  research  (Output  3).

The strategic procurement \nplan, attached to the PAM, was developed to ensure value for money by choosing appropriate \nbid packaging, bidding procedures, bid documents, and contract modalities. Research institutes \nor firms will be recruited following the quality- and cost-based selection method. As the scope of \nservices  will  be  developed  during  implementation,  if  necessary,  other  appropriate  selection \nmethods, including different types of contract modalities, will be determined at a later stage. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nSince  the  additional  financing  will  finance  a  change  in  project  scope,  due  diligence  on \n20. \neconomic, financial, procurement, safeguard, capacity, social, and poverty aspects for the current \nproject  have  all  been  updated.23 Staff  and  technical  assistance  resources  were  mobilized  to \nensure timely preparation of high-quality due diligence documentation. \n \nA. \n \n21. \nAll outputs and activities supported under this additional financing project are expected to \nresult  in  economic  and  financial  benefits  for  beneficiaries.  These  benefits  are  derived  from  (i) \nGovernment\u2019s implementation of the EFF, which is expected to improve its fiscal position and, in \nturn, Government\u2019s ability to fund critical social and economic infrastructure investments (para. \n6), and (ii) the activities financed by the additional financing, that is, continued UCT payments and \nstrengthened  institutional  capacity  for  improved  financial  management  and  control  and  policy \nresearch functions for cost effective and evidence-based decision making.  \n \n22. \nImproved public finances and reduced public debt will create fiscal space for an increase \nin  social  spending  to  strengthen  social  protection  as  well  as  infrastructure  and  human  capital \ndevelopment.  The  FY2020  national  budget  announced  on  11  June  incorporates  agreed  EFF \nmeasures. The primary deficit is slightly higher compared to FY2019. While this would ordinarily \nmean there is limited room for new policies, there is a 52% increase in expenditure for the Ehsaas \nprogram including BISP. This is expected to help cushion the poor from shocks and the short-\nterm impact of economic reforms.24 On the revenue side, the 34.8% increase in net revenue for \nthe  federal  government  includes  increases  in  recurrent  revenues  and  other  revenues  (for \nexample, royalties and dividends) and reductions in tax expenditure (for example, concessions \nand incentives). There are no planned increases in indirect taxes that could adversely affect the \npoor and near poor (example, the sales tax will remain at 17%). \n \n23. \nContinuing UCT payments and improved institutional strengthening will, in the short term, \nimprove income and consumption-related poverty and vulnerability, and, in the long-run, generate \nbroader  socio-economic  benefits  through  the  development  of  human  capital,  which  is  a  pre-\nrequisite for reducing intergenerational poverty. UCTs can yield fiscal savings for the government \nin the medium- to long-term and can have important positive multiplier effect, including improved \n\n                                                 \n23 These updated assessments can all be accessed from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n24 Recent data on income distribution for Pakistan suggest that income share of the poorest 20% of the population fell \nsharply from 9.8% to 5.9% during FY2013-FY2016, that is, during the implementation of the previous IMF program. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\ncontributions to income tax revenue. Finally, although the BISP is subject to regular evaluation, \nthere  is  need  for  improvement  in  financial  management  and  controls.  Overall,  efficiency  and \nproductivity  gains from  reforms  in these  areas  will  help  improve:  (i)  error, fraud  and  corruption \nmitigation, (ii) beneficiary awareness about their cash payments, and (iii) policy research for cost \neffective and evidence-based programs. \n \nB. \n \nBISP  is  the  flagship  social  protection  program  of  Government  and  is  one  of  the  most \n24. \nextensively documented and evaluated program in the public sector in Pakistan. Its expansion \nhas  been  accompanied  by  key  developments  such  as:  (i)  switching  from  community-based \ntargeting  to  more  effective  targeting  using  a  proxy  means  test-based  poverty  score  cards,  (ii) \ndeveloping  one  of  the  largest  databases  of  poor  households  (the  National  Socio-Economic \nRegistry), and (iii) increasing the use of personal identification number (or PIN) controlled debit \ncards or biometric verification card-less system for payments to beneficiaries. However, further \nwork  is  needed  in  specific  areas,  in  particular,  timely  completion  and  submission  of  audited \nfinancial statements. For example, the FY2017 and FY2018 audited entity financial statements \nand  management  letters  were  received  with  significant  delays.  Other  high  priority  measures \ninclude  undertaking  regular  analysis  of  payment  complaints  to  identify  causes  and  trends  and \nimprove  detection  of  suspected  cases  of  corruption,  and  appointing  specialist  investigators  to \ninvestigate  occurrences  of  corruption  (footnote  15).  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and BISP. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty, Social and Gender \n \n25. \nPakistan has a large informal economy, limited employment opportunities in formal labor \nmarkets,  inadequate  insurance  schemes,  and  an  increasing  trend  of  natural  and  manmade \ndisasters, all which make the country\u2019s poor highly susceptible to falling below the poverty line. \nAdditional support to the BISP will ensure the continuity of UCT and provide relief to the extreme \npoor. In addition, Pakistan was ranked second from last in the 2018 Global Gender Gap Index, \nsurpassing  only  Yemen. 25 Sociocultural  constraints  on  girls\u2019  and  women\u2019s  access  to  health, \neducation,  training,  jobs,  financing,  and  ease  of  mobility  have  led  to  high  levels  of  gender \ninequality and poverty. The overall literacy rate for women in Pakistan is 51.8%, compared to an \nalready low 72.5% for men. This is even lower in rural areas, with 40.5% for women compared to \n66.3%  for  men.26 Labor  force  statistics  show  that  labor  force  participation  is  25%  for  females \ncompared to 82% for males (ages 15 and above). Pakistan\u2019s female labor force participation rate \nis  among  the  lowest  in  the  world  and  in  South  Asia. Employment  for  women  is  mostly  in  the \ninformal economy, estimated to be about 72% of the economy. \n \nD. \n \n26. \nFollowing  ADB\u2019s Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  the  project  classification  of  C  for  the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples is retained (para. 8). In addition, \nthe project is classified with a gender equity theme (para. 8). Since the additional financing will \nnot support any physical intervention, land acquisition is not required. \n \n                                                 \n25 World Economic Forum. 2018.
