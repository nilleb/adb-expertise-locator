The report also describes \nthe  proposed  administration  of  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  $15,000,000  to  be  provided  by \nLeading  Asia's  Private  Infrastructure  Fund  (LEAP)1,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed \nequity investment by ADB, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the equity investment by LEAP. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n2. \nProject  identification.  With  about  161  million  people,  Bangladesh  has  the  8th  largest \npopulation in the world. It is also the 10th most densely populated country with 1,090 people per \nsquare kilometer.2 The country has delivered steady economic growth in recent years and remained \nresilient despite recent global economic cycles since 2008; its real gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth was 6.6% in 2015 and 7.1% in 2016, led by the industrial sector, which accounts for almost \none-third of GDP.3 Poverty has halved since 2000, the gender gap has narrowed, and the country \nhas made progress in providing access to health and basic social services.4 \n \n3. \nNotwithstanding its achievements and economic resilience in recent years, Bangladesh \nfaces major challenges in its effort to maintain this growth trend and move closer to upper middle-\nincome status\u2014and the country\u2019s infrastructure deficiencies remain a major constraint and a top \npriority  that  needs  to  be  addressed.  It  ranked  107th  in  quality  of  infrastructure  in  the  World \nEconomic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Report, 2017\u20132018, behind India (66th), Sri Lanka \n(85th), and Bhutan (89th) in South Asia.5 Electricity consumption was 304.0 kilowatt-hours (kWh) \nper capita in 2016 and is relatively low by global standards. In comparison, electricity consumption \nper capital is 718.3 kWh in the Philippines, 730.0 kWh in India, and 2,728 kWh in Thailand.6 To \naddress this issue\u2014and to promote a stable power supply that underpins economic growth\u2014the \nGovernment of Bangladesh has prioritized efforts to increase generation capacity, as well as to \nexpand and improve the country\u2019s power transmission and distribution network. To support the \ngovernment\u2019s  initiatives,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  international  financial \ninstitutions have made investing in Bangladesh\u2019s power infrastructure a strategic priority. \n \nProject design. Independent power producers (IPPs) and quick rental plants own about \n4. \n40% of Bangladesh\u2019s current installed capacity. Summit and its group subsidiaries (the Group) \ntogether comprise the largest IPP with a portfolio of 15 power plants and an installed capacity of \n1,201 megawatts (MW).7 Established in 1997, the Group cosponsored Bangladesh\u2019s first power \nplant  and  was  the  first  IPP  to  supply  electricity  to  the  Bangladesh  national  grid.  Its  portfolio \nrepresents 21% of Bangladesh\u2019s privately installed capacity and 9% of total installed capacity.

(KPCL), a company with three heavy fuel oil (HFO) \n\npower plants. The aggregate installed capacity of KPCL\u2019s portfolio is 277 MW.  \n\n \n\n\f2016, Summit was established as a Singaporean holding company for the Group to enable it to \nbroaden its access to global financial markets.  \n  \n5. \nPolicy) \n\n(Confidential  information  redacted  under  para.  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \n\nTable 1: Future Pipeline Projects \n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy) \n\n \nMarket advantages. Bidders for power development projects must demonstrate sufficient \n6. \ntechnical expertise and operational experience. As the largest IPP in Bangladesh, the Group has \ncertain competitive and comparative market advantages over its peers in winning bids to develop \npower projects. Therefore, ADB has an opportunity to participate in the imminent expansion of a \nproven power company that is poised to capitalize on business prospects in Bangladesh\u2019s vibrant \nand dynamic power market. This would allow ADB to achieve both developmental and financial \nobjectives,  while  transferring  international  best  practices  in  safeguards  and  governance  to  the \nGroup as a key shareholder of Summit. \n \nInvestee. This proposal involves an equity investment as a cornerstone investor8 and as \n7. \npart of an expected initial public offering (IPO) of Summit\u2019s shares on the Singapore Exchange \nLimited  (SGX).  At  the  time  of  Summit\u2019s  establishment  in  2016,  a  consortium  of  international \ninvestors including the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Islamic Development Bank \n(IDB) invested in Summit.9 (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunications Policy) \n \nIntegrity  due diligence  was  conducted.10 The results  of  such  analysis  are set  out  in  the \n8. \nintegrity disclosure document.11 ADB\u2019s review of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe \nthat such entity has been established or is being used for money laundering or terrorism financing \nin  the  jurisdictions  involved  in  the  project.  Enhanced  tax  integrity  due  diligence  was  also \nconducted. 12  The  results  of  such  analysis  are  likewise  set  out  in  the  integrity  disclosure \ndocument.13 ADB's review does not give ADB cause to believe that the transaction is being used \nfor cross-border tax evasion. \n \nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nImpact.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  Power  System  Master  Plan  for  Bangladesh,14 \n9. \nespecially  the  plan  to  enhance  imported  energy  infrastructure  and  to  construct  a  robust,  high-\nquality power network. It will help address a widening gap between the demand and supply of \nelectricity and natural gas, both of which are critical for continued industrial and economic growth.  \n\n10. \n\nOutcome. The project's outcome will be increased delivery of affordably priced energy. \n\n                                                \n8 A cornerstone investor generally refers to a class of investors who commit in advance to invest a fixed amount of \n\nmoney or buy a fixed number of shares in an IPO under a cornerstone subscription agreement. \n\n9 IFC  invested  in  Summit  both  directly  and  via  the  IFC  Emerging  Asia  Fund,  L.P.;  IDB  invested  via  EMA  Power \n\nInvestment Ltd., a joint venture between the IDB Infrastructure Fund II and Daelim Energy Co.

The outputs of the project are (i) new capital raised through an IPO, (ii) installed \n\n11. \ncapacity of power plants increased, (iii) growth of the local economy supported.  \n \nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n12. \nConsistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nseveral of ADB\u2019s strategic priorities. It is a private sector investment supporting inclusive growth \nand  infrastructure  development.15 The  project  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh16 from  both  a  strategic  and  thematic perspective  as  it  is  envisaged  to \nease infrastructure constraints, develop resilient energy infrastructure, encourage private sector \ninvestment,  and  improve  governance.17 The  project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  operational  plan  for \nregional cooperation and integration given the potential cross-border economic benefits resulting \nfrom (i) the integration of a Bangladesh-focused IPP with global financial markets, via the listing \nin  Singapore,  which  will  help  enhance  the  company\u2019s  governance  by  harmonizing  it  with \ninternational standards, and (ii) the company\u2019s envisaged expansion of its operations into LNG \nimportation, which may involve regional cross-border trade of LNG.18 \n \n13. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  In  November  2014,  ADB  approved  a  $75  million \nproject  finance  loan  for  a  341  MW  combined  cycle  gas  turbine  power  plant  promoted  by  the \nGroup.19 ADB played a catalytic role in helping the company access international lenders to reach \na  successful  financial  close  for  this  project.  The  project  realized  the  envisaged  output  of \ncommissioning  additional  grid-connected  power  generation  capacity.  ADB  has  also  approved \nother  private  and  public  sector  projects  in  support  of  the  Bangladesh  energy  sector,  including \nadditional generation capacity, LNG import facilities, and gas transmission networks.20 Therefore, \nthe proposed participation in Summit\u2019s IPO as a cornerstone investor is an example of the ADB\u2019s \nefforts to evolve from a reliable financier of single, private sector projects into an enabler of future \ngrowth, i.e., to assist ADB\u2019s established private sector partners in substantially expanding their \noperations by accessing global equity capital markets and mobilizing sufficient capital to develop \nan entire pipeline of projects. ADB has succeeded with this approach in several peer markets, \nsuch as India and Thailand. \n \nD. \n\nProject Cost and Financing Plan \n\n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \n\n14. \nPolicy) \n \nE. \n\n15. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nTable 3 summarizes the implementation arrangements.21 \n\n                                                \n15 ADB. 2014.

For the power sector, \nrelevant laws and regulations include the Electricity Act (1910), the Bangladesh Energy \nRegulatory  Commission  Act  (2003),  the  Private  Sector  Power  Generation  Policy  of \nBangladesh (1996, revised in 2004), and the Quick Enhancement of Electricity and Energy \nSupply  (Special  Provision)  Act  (2010,  amended  in  2015).  Such  laws  and  regulations \ngovern  aspects  including  electricity  generation,  transmission,  and  marketing,  as  well  as \nprovide  frameworks  for  establishing  tariffs,  incentives,  and  penalties.  For  future  LNG \noperations, relevant laws include the Bangladesh Petroleum Act (1974), the Bangladesh \nGas Act (2010), and the Petroleum Act (2016). LNG regulations provide a legal framework \nfor all aspects of managing petroleum, gas, liquid hydrocarbons, and other related fuels\u2014\nfrom exploration and importation to storage and transmission. \n(Confidential  information  redacted  under  para.  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \nPolicy) \nEnergy  tariffs  in  Bangladesh  are  generally  regulated  according  to  the  negotiated  and \nagreed  tariff  charge  between  a  project  bidder  and  the  contractual  offtaker,  which  in \nBangladesh\u2019s power sector is either the BPDB or the BREB. The agreed tariff is enshrined \nin  the  PPA  and  typically  contains  a  formula  comprising  capacity  payments,  energy \npayments, and start-up payments. These tariffs may vary from one PPA to another, but \ngenerally contain (i) capacity payments for making energy capacity available, (ii) energy \npayments  for  the  net  electrical  output  that  is  dispatched,  and  (iii)  start-up  payments  for \nsynchronizing turbines to the grid system.  \n\nThe  Group  relies  on  third-party  contractors  for  the  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance  of  its  power  plants\u2014particularly  for  large-scale  power  plants.  In  some \ninstances, the Group will enter into turnkey, fixed-price, lump-sum EPC contracts where \nthe contractor assumes total responsibility from plant design to plant performance, and will \nbe  liable  for  penalties if certain  parameters  or obligations  are  not  met.  To  that end,  the \nGroup has established several long-term strategic partnerships with top-tier suppliers and \ncontractors, such as General Electric and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4. \nTypically,  the  Group\u2019s  plants  are  able  to  generate  power  24  hours  a  day,  although  the \ncapacity  generated  and  electricity  produced  may  vary  hour-to-hour  based  on  dispatch \ninstructions. For reciprocating engine power plants, the Group\u2019s in-house operating team \ncarries out operation and maintenance (O&M). For CCGT projects, third-party contractors \ntypically  manage  O&M  under  medium-term  agreements.  All  plants  are  professionally \nmaintained on a planned annual schedule and in accordance with the original equipment \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommendations. Gas and liquid fuels that are required to run the power \nplants  are  procured  through  gas  supply  agreements  and  fuel  supply  agreements,  as \napplicable. Plants are run and monitored during the operations phase, in compliance with \ncommercial  contracts,  financing  agreements,  and  regulatory  requirements.  PPA  tenors \ngenerally range from five years to 22 years, and the company typically initiates a renewal \nprocess (for each expiring PPA) about two years before the expiry date. \n\nBPDB = Bangladesh Power Development Board; BREB = Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board; CCGT = combined \ncycle gas turbine; EPC = engineering, procurement, and construction; LNG = liquefied natural gas; O&M = operation \nand maintenance; PPA = power purchase agreement.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Summit.  \n \nF. \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \n\n16.  \nPolicy) \n \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\n(Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \n\nA. \n\nThe Assistance \n\n17. \nPolicy) \n \nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\n18. \nADB  adds  significant  value  as  a  cornerstone  investor,  particularly  in  the  book-building \nprocess leading up to the IPO.22 ADB\u2019s presence provides comfort to other potential investors, \nespecially in the areas of corporate governance, and environmental and social safeguards. The \nGroup is the first Bangladesh-based IPP to tap the international equity markets through the SGX. \nThe  project  is  expected  to  yield  significant  developmental  impacts  in  Bangladesh.  With  a \nsuccessful capital raising, Summit can mobilize additional long-term project financing, which is \ncurrently limited and hampers the company\u2019s growth and its investments into Bangladesh\u2019s power \nsector. The IPO also sets a precedent for other emerging markets IPPs with future growth plans \nthat are intending to list their companies on regulated and well-developed exchanges such as the \nSGX. \n \nC. \n\nRisks  \n\n (Confidential information redacted under para. 97(v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy) \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  is  classified \n26. \ncategory  A  for  environment,  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  B  for \nindigenous peoples. ADB\u2019s equity investment will be earmarked for Summit\u2019s future pipeline of \nprojects that comply with ADB policy requirements, including safeguards requirements 1\u20133 of the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. ADB\u2019s investment will not be applied towards any existing projects \nor any future HFO-based power projects.23 This will be reflected in the investment documentation. \nThe  risks  and  impacts  associated  with  Summit\u2019s  future  pipeline  of  projects  are  not  clear  (i.e., \nunknown and/or not identified at this stage). Therefore, the proposed categorizations consider the \npotential risks of any future projects resulting in significant environment, involuntary resettlement, \nor indigenous people impacts. \n \n \n27.  \nPolicy) \n \n\n(Confidential  information  redacted  under  para.  97(v)  of  ADB\u2019s  Public  Communications \n\n                                                \n22 Book-building is the process by which the investment banks that underwrite an IPO determine the price at which to \n\noffer a company\u2019s shares to the public markets based on indicative demand from investors. \n\n23 The Group\u2019s existing portfolio contains three thermal power plants that use HFO, which is typically high in sulfur content \n(i.e., 3% as opposed to the World Bank Group\u2019s environment, health, and safety guidelines of 1%).

Safeguards requirements 1\u20133 and \nthe  environmental  and  social  requirements  in  the  ESMS  (e.g.,  categorization  checklists,  initial \nenvironmental  examinations,  environmental  impact  assessment  reports,  social  audit  reports, \ndisclosures, and internal and/or third-party reporting) will be mandatory for all future projects using \nADB proceeds. The ESMS will be updated and adopted by Summit before any commitment of \nADB funds. The company will also report to ADB\u2014semiannually for projects under construction \nand annually thereafter\u2014on ongoing compliance with the ESMS and Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements. These obligations will be documented to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. \n \n31. \nThe Group will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.25 Summit will report yearly to ADB on its compliance with such laws and the measures \ntaken. The project is classified as having some gender elements. It will increase the proportion of \nwomen  targeted  for  jobs  during  operations  to  7.5%  (from  5%)  and  ensure  at  least  30%  of \ncommunity engagement initiatives benefit women.
