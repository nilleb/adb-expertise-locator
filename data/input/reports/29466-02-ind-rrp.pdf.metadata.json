An initial environmental examination (IEE) and \nan  Environmental  Management  Plan  have  been  undertaken. \nA  summary  IEE  was  circulated  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s)  Board  of  Directors  and  posted  on  the  ADB  website  on \n7 August 2006. \n \nThe supplementary loan for the Kolkata Environmental Improvement \nProject  (the  Project)  will  support  the  Kolkata  Municipal  Corporation \n(KMC) in achieving the original scope and objectives of the Project: \nthe  Calcutta  (Kolkata)  Environmental  Improvement  Project  (Loan \n1813-IND).  The  Project  will  continue  to  (i)  improve  environmental \nconditions  in  the  outer  areas  of  Kolkata,  (ii) reduce  poverty  in  low-\nincome  areas  through  affordable  access  to  basic  urban  services, \n(iii) facilitate \nthrough  participatory \nprocesses, (iv) protect the environment from adverse developmental \nimpacts,  and  (v)  help  the  KMC  develop  as  a  proficient  and \nautonomous municipality. The Project will contribute to achieving the \ntargets  of  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  in  particular \nMDG 7. \n \nDespite initial delays and the subsequent cancellation of part of the \nloan  proceeds,  implementation  of  the  Project  is  now  in  full  swing, \nand  there  are  strong  justifications  for  providing  the  supplementary \nloan.  The  executing  agencies  have  overcome  the  steep  initial \nlearning curve and are now well equipped to complete the scope of \nthe  Project  as  proposed.  The  Government  of  West  Bengal  (GoWB) \nis  strongly  committed,  and  during  the  last  18  months,  substantial \nstrengthening  of  project  management  has  been  apparent.  As  of \n10  November  2006,  under  ADB\u2019s  financing,  contracts  worth  $120.7 \nmillion have already been awarded, and the remaining contracts are \nbeing  tendered.  Disbursements  will  soon  follow.  The  request  for \nsupplementary  financing  meets  the  criteria  under  the  ADB\u2019s  policy \nfor supplementary financing1 as demonstrated by the following: \n \n\ncommunity  empowerment \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Project  is  a  priority  for  both  the  GoWB  and  the \nGovernment of India\u2019s development strategy. \nThe  timely  provision  of  funds  is  critical  for  maintaining  the \ncurrent momentum and the positive impacts that are already \napparent as a result of the Project.   The  supplementary loan \n\n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. A Review of the Policy on Supplementary Financing: Addressing Challenges and Broader Needs.

If the full project scope were not completed, the impacts \nand  objectives  envisaged  for  the  Project  would  be  seriously \nundermined,  for  instance,  some  facilities  currently  under \nconstruction would be underutilized or redundant.  \nThe  continued  value-added  involvement  of  ADB  in  this \nProject  will  ensure  that  the  unique  ecological  characteristics \nof the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW) are maintained through \nthe  application  of  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  its \naccumulated  knowledge.  In  August  2002,  the  EKW,  into \nwhich some of the treated wastewater from the project areas \n(from  Borough  VII,  part  of  Borough  XI,  and  Borough  XII)  is \nlist \ndesigned \nmaintained by the Ramsar Bureau established under Article 8 \nof  the  Ramsar  Convention,  which  recognizes  the  EKW  as  a \n\u201cwetland  of  international  importance\u201d  (site  number  1208)  for \nits  approach  to  treating  the  city  of  Kolkata\u2019s  wastewater, \nwhereby  it  efficiently  recovers  nutrients  from  the  wastewater \nand  uses  the  treated  water  for  pisiculture  (fish  farming)  and \nagriculture. This  intervention  has  a significant  demonstration \neffect  as  an  urban  sector,  eco-friendly,  best  practice  that \ncould be maximized in India. \nThe  Project  remains  technically  feasible,  economically  and \nfinancially  viable,  and  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements. By rationalizing and extending the coverage to \na  new  borough,  the  most  congested  and  rapidly  expanding \narea of Kolkata\u2019s outer peripheries, the Project enhances and \nfurther  strengthens  the  Project\u2019s  original  objectives  and \nthan  150,000  additional \nextends \nbeneficiaries than originally envisaged.  \nThe due diligence matrix for ADB\u2019s policy on supplementary \nfinancing  has  been  observed  for  all  steps,  and  all  new  or \nrevised policies approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors since \nthe  original  appraisal  of  the  Project  have  been  taken  into \nconsideration  as  required  by  the  policy  on  supplementary \nfinancing. \nThe  provision  of  this  supplementary  loan  allows  ADB  to \nits  governance  and \ncontinue \nanticorruption \nlong-term \nrelationship with the GoWB. \n\nreforms  and \n\nto  enhance \n\nits  benefits \n\nthe  GoWB \n\nto  assist \n\nto  more \n\nits \n\nin \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii)  The financial health of both the KMC and the GoWB is sound \n\nas demonstrated by the financial analysis. \n\n        \n \nThe  overall  impact  of  the  Project  is  sustained  improvement  in  the \nenvironmental  health  and  quality  of  life  of  residents  of  the  city  of \nKolkata.  The  outcomes  of  the  Project  are  (i) the  provision  of \nsewerage  and  drainage  facilities  for  more  than  2  million  people, \n(ii)  an   improvement   in   environmental   conditions   and   reduced \n\n\f \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agencies \n\n \n\nv\n\nflooding  incidents  in  Kolkata,  (iii) an  improvement  in  solid  waste \nmanagement  services  for  more  than  5  million  people,  (iv) the \nenhancement  of  basic  urban  services  for  0.2  million  slum  dwellers, \nand  (v) an  improvement  in  the  financial  sustainability  of    the  KMC \nwhereby  it  can  meet  all  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  urban \nservices for which it is responsible. \n\nThe  revised  total  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n$401.4  million,  including  taxes,  duties,  and  physical  and  price \ncontingencies,  of  which  the  investment  cost  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary loan is $113.6 million. The supplementary loan from \nADB  financing  is  proposed  to  amount  to  $80  million.  With  the \nproposed  supplementary  loan,  ADB  will  cover  64.2%  of  the  total \ninvestment requirement for the Project. \n \nA  supplementary  loan  of  $80  million  from  the  ordinary  capital \nresources  of  ADB  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based  lending facility. The supplementary  loan  \nwill be fully synchronized with the original loan, and will have  a term \nof  19  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  year,  and  any \nother  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements.  \n \nUnder  the  revised  financing  arrangements,  the  two  ADB  loans  will \ncover  64.2%  of  the  total  investment  costs.  Of  the  total  investment \ncost, the GoWB will finance 18.5% and the KMC will finance 17.3%. \nThe Government of India will pass the proposed supplementary loan \non to the GoWB as 70% debt on the same terms and conditions as \nfor the original loan and 30% grant. The GoWB will then onlend the \nfull  amount  of  the  loan  portion  to  the  KMC  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as for the original loan, while the grant portion will also be \npassed on to the KMC as a grant. \n \n31 December 2010 \n \n30 June 2010 \n\n \nImplementation  arrangements  for  the  proposed  supplementary  loan \nwill remain the same as for the original loan for the Project. The two \nproject  management  units  (PMUs)  established  under  each  of  the \nexecuting  agencies\u2014the  KMC  and  the  Irrigation  and  Waterways \nDepartment\u2014will  continue  to  implement  the  respective  components \nof  the  Project,  i.e.,  the  Irrigation  and  Waterways  Department  PMU \nwill continue to be responsible for implementing canal works and the \nKMC  PMU  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  implementing  all  the \nthe  Project.  To  streamline  project \nremaining  works  under \nmanagement and speed up implementation, the KMC will act as the \nlead  executing  agency  responsible  for  overall  project  planning, \nbudgeting, reporting, and execution and will be ADB\u2019s primary point \nof contact for the Project period. \n \nKolkata  Municipal  Corporation  and \nDepartment \n\nIrrigation  and  Waterways \n\n \n\n\f \nProcurement \n\nvi \n\n \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n \n \n\nlimited \n\n \nthe  proposed \nProcurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under \nsupplementary  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  \nProcurement  Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time).  \nAll  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  $10  million  equivalent  or \nmore  will  be  procured  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive \nbidding procedures, and civil works contracts estimated to cost less \nthan  $10  million  will  be procured  using  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures.  Procurement  of  goods  will,  to  the  extent  practicable, \nbe  grouped  into  packages  larger  than  $1  million  to  be  suitable  for \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Goods  that  cannot  be \ngrouped  into  larger  contracts  and  are  estimated  to  cost  less  than \n$1 million per contract will be procured following national competitive \nbidding  or \ninternational  bidding  procedures,  and \nmiscellaneous minor goods estimated to cost less than $100,000 will \nbe  purchased \nfollowing  shopping  procedures.  All  civil  works, \nequipment purchases, and consulting contracts under the proposed \nsupplementary  loan  will  be  separate  from  contracts  under  the \noriginal loan for the Project. \n  \nUnder the original loan for the Project, and following ADB\u2019s quality-\nbased  selection  procedures,  an  international  consulting  firm  has \nalready been engaged as the project management consultant and a \nnational  consulting  firm  has  been  engaged  as  the  design  and \nconstruction supervision consultant. Additional consulting services\u2014\n63  person-months  for  the  project  management  consultant  and \n367  person-months  for  the  design  and  construction  supervision \nconsultant\u2014will  be  required  to  implement  the  Project,  including \nworks  under  the  proposed  supplementary  loan.  The  proposed \nadditional  consulting  services  will  be  provided  by  the  current \nconsulting  firms,  which  will  be  engaged  under  the  supplementary \nloan  through  single  source  selection  procedures  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from \ntime to time). Each of the firms will be requested to provide a biodata \ntechnical  proposal  for  review  by  the  KMC  and  ADB  and  for \nsubsequent negotiations. In addition, a national firm will be engaged \nas  creative  consultants  for  30  person-months  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedures. \n\nThe  Project  will  provide  sewerage  and  drainage  facilities  for  more \nthan  2  million  people,  improved  environmental  conditions  and  solid \nwaste  management  services  for  more  than  5  million  people,  and \nenhanced basic urban services for 0.2 million slum dwellers. With an \nincrease in the number of beneficiaries by more than 150,000 and in \nthe  number  of  property  connections  to  sewer  lines  by  30,200  (the \noriginal  target  was  90,000  whereas  the  revised  target  is  120,200), \nthe  proposed  supplementary  loan  will  further  refine  the  Project\u2019s \nscope, coverage, and benefits. \n \nRisks  and  assumptions  originally  identified  under  the  Project  were \nreassessed to establish continued and additional risks to the Project, \nincluding  those  specific  to  the  proposed  supplementary  loan,  and \nmitigation  measures  are  proposed.  Key  risks  identified  during  the \noriginal  Project  appraisal  pertained to (i)  land  acquisition,  (ii) user \n\n\f \n\n \n\nvii\n\ncharges,  (iii) rationalization  of  the  KMC\u2019s  staff,  (iv) property  tax \nreforms,  and  (v) state  of  the  GoWB\u2019s  finances.  Significant  progress \nwith land acquisition for the Project, comprehensive  analysis  of  the \nfinancial soundness  of the  GoWB      and    the    KMC,    and    progress  \nwith  the  KMC  Capacity-Building  Program  under  the  Department  for \nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  grant  provide \nadequate  assurances  that  risks  (i),  (iii),  and  (v)  have  been \nminimized,  including  for  the  supplementary  loan.  With  regard  to \nproperty tax reforms, the KMC has already prepared and ratified the \nnecessary  legal  documents  and  forwarded  them  to  the  legal \nassembly of the GoWB. The GoWB has provided  assurances  that  \na    relevant    act    will  be  effected  by  the  end  of  fiscal  year  2007. \nFurthermore,  the  original  objective  of  property  tax  reforms  was  to \nstrengthen the ailing financial standing of the GoWB, which is not the \ncase anymore, as demonstrated by the new financial analysis of the \nGoWB and the KMC. The loan covenant on introducing user charges \nfor  domestic  water  and  sewerage  consumption  is  still  outstanding, \nand  the  risk  in  relation  to  this  aspect  of  the  Project  remains. \nTo  minimize  this  risk,  a  phased  and  realistic  road  map  for  tariff \nimplementation,  with  firm  milestones,  has  been  agreed  with  the \nGoWB and the KMC to achieve the original objectives of the Project. \nSuch  a  road  map  has  been  reflected  in  additional  covenants  in  the \nproposed Loan Agreement for supplementary financing. \n \nThe  risk  of  delayed  implementation,  as  experienced  in  the  early \nyears  of  Project  implementation,  is  minimal,  as  the  capacity  and \nmandate  of  the  PMUs  were  significantly  enhanced  in  the  last \n2  years  and  the  PMUs  have  already  completed  detailed  design, \ntender  document  preparation,  and  land  acquisition  for  all  the \nremaining  major  contracts  under  the  Project,  including  contracts \nunder the proposed supplementary loan. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nix\n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nsupplementary loan to India for the Kolkata Environmental Improvement Project.1 A revised design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\nProject Rationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nAccording  to  India\u2019s  2001  population  census,  more  than  285  million  people  (27.8%  of  the \ntotal  population)  live  in  urban  areas.  Given  current  trends  in  population  growth  and  migration,  \nthe urban population is estimated to reach 575 million by 2030. Estimates indicate that the urban \nsector contributes 50\u201352% of India\u2019s gross domestic product. Sixty-five percent of employment in \ntrade, commerce, and financial services; 65% of manufacturing employment; and 68% of transport \nsector employment are concentrated in urban areas. Despite the significance of the urban sector, \npoverty,  inadequate  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  and  environmental  degradation  are \nwidespread  in  India\u2019s  cities.  Poor  urban  management  is  not  only  undermining  India\u2019s  ability  to \ndeliver  a  good  quality  of  life  to  its  citizens,  but  is  also  constraining  potential  local  and  national \neconomic  growth.  Estimates  indicate  that  one  third  of  India\u2019s  urban  population  lives  below  the \npoverty  line.  The  provision  of  basic  infrastructure  facilities  and  services,  and  consequent \nenvironmental  health  conditions,  is  poor  for  many  segments  of  society,  but  especially  for  those \nliving in slums and poorer communities, where conditions are rapidly deteriorating. The need for a \nstrong focus on and accelerated investment in urban development is clear. \n \n3. \nKolkata,  the  capital  of  the  state  of  West  Bengal,  is  one  of  India\u2019s  most  populous  cities. \nAccording  to  the  2001  census,  Kolkata  has  a  population  of  4.58  million,  while  the  urban \nagglomeration  as  a  whole  houses  an  estimated  13.20  million  people.  Kolkata\u2019s  municipal \nadministration  dates  back  to  1727.  The  Kolkata  Municipal  Corporation  (KMC)  Act  (1980)  is  a \nprogressive piece of legislation that contains many of the reforms currently under consideration in \nIndia\u2019s  urban  sector  and  was  enacted  well  before  the  74th  Constitutional  Amendment  Act,  which \ndelegated  power  to  from  the  central  Government  to  local  bodies.  The  KMC  is  made  up  of  \n15  boroughs  subdivided  into  141  wards.  Some  36,000  executive  officers  and  staff  carry  out  the \nmunicipality\u2019s functions. \n \nThe  KMC\u2019s  average  population  density  is  more  than  24,000  people  per  square  kilometer, \n4. \none of the highest population densities in India. While more than 85% of the KMC\u2019s population has \naccess to piped water, only 50% of the KMC\u2019s population has a sewer connection, and in the outer \nareas this figure drops to about 17%. Sewage and storm water from the inner core area of Kolkata \nare conveyed by artificially created channels referred to as dry weather flow (DWF) channels and \nstorm  water  flow  channels,  respectively.  Both  types  of  channels  flow  through  the  East  Kolkata \nWetlands (EKW) before eventually entering the Kulti River. Kolkata\u2019s flat topography necessitates \npumping virtually all sewage and storm water to the points of discharge: either sewage treatment \nplants (STPs) or the DWF and storm water flow channels. The flat topography also leads to severe \nand  rapid  silting  of  many  of  the  channels,  which  aggravates  flooding.  The  extent  of  solid  waste \ncollection  is  quite  high  in  the  inner  core  areas,  covering  about  70\u201390%  of  the  urban  population, \nwhereas  collection  efficiency  in  the  outer  areas  is  much  lower.  Registered  bustees  (slum  or  low-\nincome  communities)  represent  around  30%  of  the  population,  with  unregistered  bustees  and \nillegal squatters accounting for approximately an additional 9%. \n \n5. \nIn  the  1990s,  faced  with  severe  environmental  degradation  and  a  growing  urban  poverty \nproblem, the Government of West Bengal (GoWB) prepared two long-term documents: the Basic \n                                                 \n1   The name of the original Project was the Calcutta Environmental Improvement Project, which has now been changed \nto the Kolkata Environmental Improvement Project, because the name of the city has changed officially from Calcutta \nto Kolkata. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nDevelopment  Plan  and  the  Master  Plan  for  Water  Supply,  Sewerage,  and  Drainage,  Kolkata \nMetropolitan  District  (1996\u20132001).  These  plans,  which  address  the  institutional  and  planning \naspects  of  development  as  well  as  its  physical  investment  requirements,  have  since  been \nprogressively  implemented.  Kolkata  has  also  benefited  from  India\u2019s  Megacity  Scheme,  which \npromotes  the  establishment  of  revolving  funds  for  sustained  investment  in  urban  infrastructure \nthrough the adoption of direct and indirect cost-recovery measures, and the Bustee Improvement \nProgram,  whose  implementation  began  in  1970  and  focuses  on  sanitation.  Loan  1813-IND: \nCalcutta (Kolkata) Environmental Improvement Project2 was founded on these plans and schemes \nand takes Kolkata\u2019s pressing urban needs into account. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n6. \nOn  19  December  2000,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Calcutta \n(Kolkata)  Environmental  Improvement  Project  (the  Project)  for  $250  million  to  help  the  GoWB \nimprove sanitation in the outer areas of the municipality of Kolkata. The Project became effective \non 16 April 2002 and has a closing date of 31 December 2007. The Project components are (i) part \nA:  stakeholder  consultation  program,  (ii) part  B:  sewerage  and  drainage  (S&D)  improvements, \n(iii) part  C:  solid  waste  management,  (iv) part  D:  slum \nimprovements,  (v) part  E:  canal \nimprovements,  and  (vi) part  F:  implementation  assistance  and  capacity  building.  In  parallel,  \na  $42  million  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom  grant  is \nsupporting modernization and strengthening of the KMC. The project area covers boroughs I, VII, \nXI,  XII,  XIII,  XIV,  and  XV  for  part  B,  while  physical  works  under  parts  A,  C,  D,  E,  and  F  cover \ndifferent boroughs. \n \n7. \nThe  Project\u2019s  objectives  are  to  (i) improve  environmental  conditions  in  the  outer  areas  of \nKolkata,  (ii) reduce  poverty  in  low-income  areas  by  means  of  affordable  access  to  basic  urban \nservices,  (iii) facilitate  community  empowerment  through  participatory  processes,  (iv)  protect  the \nenvironment from adverse developmental impacts, and (v) help the KMC develop into a proficient \nand autonomous municipality.3 \n \nC. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nThe total cost of the Project was estimated at $360 million equivalent, including duties and \n\n8. \ntaxes. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the original cost estimates and the financing plan, respectively. \n \nOf the total cost of $360 million, ADB provided a loan of $250 million (the original loan) from \n9. \nits  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR),  representing  approximately  69%  of  the  total  original  project \ncost. The original loan was for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 6 years. The original \nloan, which initially consisted of a pool-based loan and a London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  loan,  was  changed  in  July  2002  to  an  entirely  LIBOR-based  loan,  and  the  amortization \nschedule  was  adjusted  accordingly  as  determined  in  accordance  with  interest  rates  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based loan regulations. \n \nThe Government of India passed the original loan to the GoWB as 70% ($175 million) debt \n10. \nand  30%  ($75  million)  grant.  GoWB  then  onlent  the  full  amount  of  the  loan  portion  to  KMC  on \nterms  acceptable  to  ADB,  while  the  grant  portion  was  passed  on  to  KMC  also  as  a  grant.  \nIn addition, the GoWB provided further budgetary support of $54.6 million, of which $9.17 million \nwas allocated to the Irrigation and Waterways Department (I&WD), the second executing agency \nfor  the  Project  (the  KMC  was  the  first),  as  a  grant  to  meet  the  cost  of  canal  improvements  and \nresettlement, and $45.43 million was allocated as a grant to the KMC. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2000.

Subsequently,  in  2005,  the  Government  of  India  requested  the  cancellation  of \n$42.2  million  allocated  for  interest  during  construction,  which  was  no  longer  necessary,  as  the \nGovernment had changed its policy and started paying interest during construction when it became \ndue rather than capitalizing it. An additional rationale for these cancellations was that India had a \nfew nonperforming urban projects that eventually had to be cancelled. Thus, the Government was \nseriously concerned that this Project would remain nonperforming, and might have to be cancelled \neventually  as  well,  because  no  significant  project  implementation  took  place  for  almost  4  years \ninitially and little progress was apparent. \n \n12. \nDuring  the  last  18  months,  however,  the  Project  has  seen  substantial  strengthening  of \nproject management and speedy progress of project implementation (para. 13). At the same time, \nstrong  growth  of  the  overall  Indian  economy  in  recent  years  has  resulted  in  major  inflation, \nespecially  in  construction  prices  across  the  country,  and  in  strengthening  of  the  Indian  rupee \nagainst the US dollar. As a result, a significant financial gap became evident in the Project, which \nis now performing well. The KMC attempted to reshuffle and rationalize the use of available funds \nby  cutting  the  physical  scope  of  the  S&D  and  canal  improvement  components,  but  these \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ncomponents,  in  particular,  the  S&D  works,  constitute  integral  packages  of  network  development, \ntherefore  partial  reduction  of  the  physical  scope  of  the  Project  would  seriously  undermine  the \nimpacts  envisaged  under  the  Project  and  jeopardize  achievement  of  the  Project\u2019s  objectives.  \nFor  instance,  some  facilities  currently  under  construction  would  be  underutilized  or  would  be \nredundant unless the full Project scope were to be completed. Note also that current rationalization \nof  the  Project  scope  would  result in  more  than  150,000  additional  project  beneficiaries  under the \nS&D improvement component.  \n \nD. \n\nStatus and Progress of Project Implementation \n\n1. \n\nSummary of Project Implementation Progress \n\n13. \nDespite  significant  start-up  delays,  the  executing  agencies  are  strongly  committed  and \nproject  implementation  is  now  progressing  steadily,  as  seen  in  the  expeditious  tendering  and \nimplementation of contracts over the last 18 months. This is a result of a major initiative undertaken \nby the GoWB in 2004\u20132005 to reorganize and strengthen the project management units (PMUs) in \norder to speed up project implementation (Appendix 2 provides details on measures introduced by \nthe  executing  agencies).  As  of  10  November  2006,  under  ADB  financing,  contracts  worth  \n$120.7  million  have  been  awarded  under  the  Project.  Even  though  only  $30.8  million  of  ADB \nfinancing has been disbursed so far, the PMUs are projecting expenditure of $50 million by the end \nof  fiscal  year  (FY)  2007  based  on  work  progress  and  contractors\u2019  projections.  The  remaining \ncontracts are in the final stages of detailed design and tender document preparation. ADB\u2019s Loan \nFinancial  Information  System 4  report  rates  the  Project  as  partially  satisfactory  based  on  past \ndelays. All civil works and equipment purchase contracts are expected to be awarded by the end of \n2007, including packages under the proposed supplementary loan, and no further time overrun is \nexpected  under  the  Project.  Appendix  3  provides  details  of  the  implementation  status  of  each \ncomponent of the Project.  \n \n\n2. \n\nCompliance Review \n\nA  comprehensive  assessment  of  compliance  with  the  original  loan  covenants  was  carried \n14. \nout  and  is  summarized  in  Appendix  4.  Two  major  covenants  that  remain  outstanding  are  (i) the \nintroduction of an area-based property tax, and (ii) the introduction of water and sewerage tariffs. \nWith  regard  to  property  tax  reform,  the  KMC  has  already  prepared,  ratified,  and  forwarded  the \nnecessary  legal  documents  to  the  provincial  legal  assembly  of  the  GoWB  and  the  GoWB  has \nprovided  assurances  that  a  relevant  act  will  be  approved  by  its  legal  assembly  by  the  end  of \nFY2007. Based on lessons from project implementation, GoWB, ADB and KMC agreed that a more \nphased  tariff  implementation  road  map,  with  firm  milestones,  is  needed  to  achieve  the  original \nobjectives  of  the  Project.  Such  a  road  map  has  been  reflected  in  additional  covenants  in  the \nproposed  Loan  Agreement  for  supplementary  financing.  For  example,  the  KMC  has  agreed  to \ninitially  introduce  a  flat-rate  tariff  by  30  June  2007.  Subsequently,  the  KMC  will  install  at  least \n100,000 household water meters, conduct the necessary preparatory tariff analysis, and reassess \nwillingness to pay by updating an earlier study5 by March 2007. \n \n15. \nEnvironment.  Supplementary  Appendix  A  presents  a  review  of  compliance  with \nenvironmental  safeguards.  The  assessment  indicates  that  mitigation  measures  proposed  in  the \noriginal  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  for  the  Project  have  been  incorporated  in  bidding \ndocuments.  The  executing  agencies  have  prepared  the  necessary  environmental  assessment \ndocuments, such as IEEs, prior to commencement of works in all boroughs. These separate IEEs \nhave now been incorporated in the revised IEE for the Project. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2006. Loan Financial Information System Report. Manila \n5   A willingness-to-pay study was conducted in 2000 with the assistance of the World Bank (Weston International, USA, \net  al.  November  2001.  An  Assessment  of  Social  Aspects  and  Willingness  to  Pay:  Project  Preparation  Studies  for \nCalcutta Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Projects, World Bank Project No. P.O.50648. Kolkata). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\n16. \nThe  Project  was  originally  classified  as  category  B  for  environment  in  2000  when  it  was \napproved. However, in August 2002, the EKW, into which some of the treated wastewater from the \nproject  areas  (from  Borough  VII,  part  of  Borough  XI,  and  Borough  XII)  is  designed  to  be \ndischarged, was included in the list maintained by the Ramsar Bureau established under Article 8 \nof the Ramsar Convention, which recognizes the EKW as a \u201cwetland of international importance\u201d \n(site  number  1208)  for  its  approach  to  treating  the  city  of  Kolkata\u2019s  wastewater,  whereby  it \nefficiently  recovers  nutrients  from  the  wastewater  and  uses  the  treated  water  for  pisiculture  (fish \nfarming) and agriculture. This designation of the receiving water body has resulted in the Project \nbeing  reclassified  as  category  B  (sensitive)  for  environment  under  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \n(2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines.6 Furthermore, the KMC is currently conducting \na  comprehensive  study  of  the  Project\u2019s  potential  environmental  impacts  on  the  EKW  in  order  to \npropose  dropping  two  STPs  from  the  Project  and  instead  discharging  the  sewage  from  Borough \nVII, part of Borough XI, and Borough XII) into the DWF channel to be treated through the fisheries \nin  the  EKW.  The  DWF  channel  is  an  artificial  channel  that  carries  wastewater  from  almost  the \nentire core of the city to the Kulti River, after traveling a distance of more than 30 kilometers (km), \nwhere  it  undergoes  a  process  of  natural  treatment  through  fisheries  and  agriculture  in  the  EKW \narea.  \n \nSocial Safeguards. The Project was classified as category A for involuntary resettlement in \n17. \n2000.  A  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  in  2000.  Changes  in  design  and  physical  scope  during \nproject implementation have increased the number of affected persons for the canal improvement \ncomponent  by  3%,  but  the  current  project  design  and  scope  will  nevertheless  have  similar \nresettlement  impacts  as  originally  envisaged  under  the  Project.  Compliance  assessment  shows \nthat  implementation  of  the  Project  in  general  has  been  in  accordance  with  the  original  loan \ncovenants and relevant ADB policies. \n \nAn  updated  resettlement  plan  is  required 7 because  (i) a  detailed  Project  design  is  now \n18. \navailable, (ii) there are some modifications in the Project\u2019s scope and design, and (iii) entitlements \nfor  affected  persons  have  changed.  The  Project  is  providing  improved  compensation  for  those \naffected  by  canal  improvements.  Salient  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  include  ensuring  that \nthe updated resettlement plan includes (i)  revision of the number of affected persons based on the \nupdated socioeconomic information, including a census of highly vulnerable persons; (ii) inventory \nof  common  property \nrestoration  and  social  support; \n(iv) documentation  on  land  acquired,  particularly  private  land,  ensuring  consistency  with  the \nresettlement  plan  and  loan  agreements;  (v) assessment  of  temporary  impacts  in  relation  to  S&D \nimprovements  and  subsequent  entitlements;  (vi) detailed  budget  and  flow  of  funds;  and  (vii) full \ndocumentation  of  disclosure  and  consultation  activities.  Recommendations  on  and  a  review  of \ncompliance  with  the  resettlement  plan  implementation  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  B.  \nThe executing agencies have prepared an updated resettlement plan.8 \n \n19. \nGender issues have been carefully integrated into project planning, including resettlement \nplanning  and  implementation.  During  the  stakeholder  consultation  process,  specific  consultations \nwere  carried  out  separately  for  female  groups  to  provide  information  on  various  issues  such  as \nappropriate  entitlements,  formation  and  role  of  user  groups,  self-help  groups,  and  field-level \nmonitoring  committees,  in  order  to  address  women\u2019s  concerns  and  to  motivate  and  support  their \nparticipation in the planning and implementation of project works at the local level. Female-headed \nhouseholds are considered to be vulnerable and are accorded additional entitlements.9 In addition, \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n7  Para. 28, p. 41, of the original Loan Agreement. \n8   The updated resettlement plan was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 22 August 2006. \n9  To  assist  the  highly  vulnerable,  the  Project  will  provide  them  with  first-floor  Valmiki  Ambedkar  Shahari  Aawas  Yojna \n(VAMBAY)  apartments, which have commercial possibilities, provide access to land for social forestry and vegetable \nor  other  crop  production  along  rehabilitated  canal  banks,  and  facilitate  access  to  Government  livelihood  and  other \nsocial  programs.  VAMBAY  is  a  scheme  of  the  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  and  Poverty  Alleviation  of  the \nGovernment  of  India.  This  scheme,  launched  in  December  2001,  provides  grant  subsidy  for  construction  and \nrehabilitation of the dwelling units for the slum dwellers and the population living below the poverty line. \n\n(iii) strategies  on \n\nincome \n\nlosses; \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nlegal titles will be in the name of women, and thus the Project will help promote the empowerment \nof  women. 10  Other  project  actions  consistent  with  gender  development  are  (i) ensuring  an \nadequate gender balance among the PMUs\u2019 staff; (ii) addressing and monitoring gender issues;11 \n(iii) ensuring  that  women  benefit  from  poverty  alleviation  schemes  for  the  urban  poor,  from  the \nformation  of  women\u2019s  self-help  groups,  and  from  vocational  training  provided  for  such  groups;12 \nand (iv) empowering women through gender sensitization, participation, and training. \n \n\n3. \n\nLessons  \n\n20. \nPast  urban  development  projects  in  India,  including  the  Project,  experienced  significant \ndelays  in  the  executing  agencies  undertaking  initial  activities  during  the  project  start-up  period. \nThese  resulted  in  both  time  and  cost  overruns,  leading  to  the  Borrower  incurring  undue \ncommitment  charges.  Indeed,  the  cancellations  of  some  of  the  loan  proceeds  under  the  Project \nwere closely related to the accumulation of commitment charges accruing from significant start-up \ndelays.  To  give  the  executing  agencies  more  time  to  carry  out  project  start-up  activities,  the \nGovernment of India also tended to delay loan signing for as long as possible following approval by \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors, thereby reducing the commitment charges payable. For instance, in the \ncase of the Project, the loan signing was delayed by 12 months. Furthermore, unlike experienced \nnational  agencies,  such  as  the  National  Highway  Authority  of  India  or  other  central  government \nentities,  at  the  time  of  project  appraisal,  state  governments  and  local  urban  bodies  do  not  have \ndedicated  PMUs  that  can  take  on  advance  procurement  activities.  Thus  a  new  PMU  has  to  be \ncreated for implementing each ADB loan project with staff deputed from several state government \nagencies or specifically hired for the purpose. This implies that PMUs\u2019 capacities to take on project-\nrelated work, especially their understanding of ADB procedures and requirements, need to be built \nup from scratch, which takes time. \n \nIt was therefore apparent that consultant support would be required not just at the detailed \n21. \nengineering design and supervision stage, but also at the project preparatory stage. In the absence \nof  retroactive  financing  arrangements,  state  governments  had  to  wait  for  loans  to  be  signed  and \nmade  effective  to  mobilize  consultants,  which  is  why,  under  the  Project,  appointing  consultants \nafter  the  loan  signing  took  11  months.  Such  initial  delays  in  appointing  consultants  have  a \nsignificant  impact  on  subsequent  project  implementation,  because  the  preparation  of  generic \nprequalification and standard bidding documents, detailed engineering surveys, and specific tender \ndocuments  can  only  take  place  after  the  project  management  and  design  and  construction \nsupervision  consultants  are  in  place.  As  a  result,  in  the  case  of  the  Project,  it  took  more  than  \n2 years after the appointment of the consultants to award the first major civil works contract. \n \n22. \nBoth the Government of India and ADB found these significant start-up delays and resulting \ntime and cost overruns to be excessively costly. To overcome these start-up delays, in 2003 and \n2004,  Government  and  ADB  representatives  participated  in  extensive  discussions  and  reviews \npertaining to urban sector projects in India. For its part, the Government of India agreed to set up \ndedicated PMUs at the time of project appraisal, while ADB agreed to provide support to executing \nagencies  to  (i) establish  project  management  and  implementation  units  far  ahead  of  loan \neffectiveness;  (ii) strengthen  the  managerial  and  institutional  capabilities  of  such  units;  (iii) help \ndevelop  tender  documents,  select  consultants,  and  prequalify  contractors;  (iv) familiarize  project \nstaff with ADB policies and procedures; and (v) develop a strong sense of ownership among state \nand  municipal  governments  and  promote    public  participation.  The  experience  of  providing \nadvance  support  to  the  executing  agencies  was  successful  and  it  has  now  been  adopted  in  all \nurban projects in India and other South Asian countries. \n\n                                                 \n10 These apartments come with legal titles for occupants, turning informal dwellers on government lands to legal owners \n\nof well-built apartments. \n\n11 This is included in the implementation schedule for the resettlement plan, especially domestic violence issues. \n12 The Project has introduced skills training programs, self-help groups, and financing support for the self-help groups as \nadditional measures to augment the income levels of affected families. Women are the main beneficiaries of programs \ncurrently run at the Nonadanga relocation site. \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4. \n\nProject Benefits and Impacts \n\n23. \nAs  substantial  physical  progress  only  started  in  the  last  18  months,  the  Project\u2019s  benefit \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  process  has  been  delayed.  However,  the  collection  of  baseline \ndata on indicators to be used for monitoring project outputs and benefits has been completed for all \nworks, and the data will be used during the comprehensive midterm review of the Project, which is \nscheduled for December 2007. After completion, the Project is expected to provide (i) S&D facilities \nfor  more  than  2  million  people,  (ii) improved  solid  waste  management  facilities  for  more  than  \n5 million people, and (iii) improved basic urban services for 0.2 million slum dwellers. \n \n24.  With  assistance  from  nongovernment  organizations  and  consultants,  the  Project  has \nconducted extensive consultations with affected families, local leaders, and other stakeholders on \nvarious  social  development  issues.  Using  those  inputs,  the  Project  has  moved  forward  with  a \nnumber  of  schemes  designed  to  extend  short-term  and  long-term  benefits  to  the  urban  poor, \nincluding  vocational  training,  insurance  schemes,  and  health  and  hygiene  awareness  programs. \nSelf-help  groups  are  being  established,  and  the  Social  Development  Unit  is  coordinating  with \nseveral government agencies to ensure that the schemes dovetail with their own schemes. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \n\nCost Overrun \n\n \nA. \n \n25. \nDuring  detailed  design  and  project  implementation,  the  physical  scope  of  the  Project  has \nundergone some modifications and changes, and the unit costs of goods and materials have risen \nsignificantly since 1999, when the original cost estimates for the Project were prepared. Based on \nrevised  cost  estimates,  the  overall  increase  in  the  project  cost  is  $113.6  million,  which  is  around \n32%  of  the  original  total  project  cost  estimate  ($360.0  million)  and  around  39%  of  the  currently \navailable  total  Project  funds  ($287.8  million).  S&D  improvements,  canal  improvements,  and \nimplementation  assistance  are  the  major  project  components  for  which  cost  overruns  are \nsignificant. Additional funds for contingencies are also required. Major factors causing project cost \noverruns  include  (i) price  increases  caused  by  general  inflation;  (ii) physical  changes  in  the \nProject\u2019s  design  and  scope;  and  (iii) cost  underestimation  at  the  appraisal  stage,  in  particular,  \nof market rates for construction works and materials. \n \nFurther analysis of the cost overrun shows that in monetary terms, of the total cost overrun \n26. \nof  $113.6  million,  $99.5  million  is  for  civil  works  (87.5%  of  the  total  cost  overrun);  followed  by  \n$9.4  million  for  contingencies  (8.2%);  $8.0  million  for  consultancy  costs  (7.1%);  $3.9  million  for \ntaxes  and  duties  (3.4%);  $3.1  million  for  incremental  administration  (2.8%);  $1.8  million  for \nresettlement  (1.6%);  and  $0.3  million  for  land  acquisition(0.2%).  At  the  same  time,  project  cost \nreductions  occurred  in  two  expenditure  categories  that  include  equipment  ($12.3  million)  and  the \nsmall-scale loan facility ($0.1 million) resulting mainly from changes in the Project\u2019s design and/or \nscope. \n \n27. \nThe cost overrun is due primarily to price escalation from 1999 to 2005, which accounted \nfor  37%  of  the  escalation  in  total  project  costs,  with  the  balance  explained  by  changes  in  the \nProject\u2019s  scope  and/  or  design  (30%)  and  cost  underestimation  at  the  original  appraisal  stage \n(33%). In particular, civil works, which constitute about 70% of the revised cost estimate, witnessed \na cost escalation of 55%. \n \n28. \nPrice  Escalation.  The  average  annual  inflation  rate,  based  on  India\u2019s  wholesale  price \nindex,  was  around  5%  during  1999\u20132005;  however,  during  this  period,  inflation  fluctuated  from \nyear to year and for different commodity groups in particular years. While average inflation for all \ncommodity groups was around 4.8% during this period, major construction materials such as iron \nand steel and cement recorded higher inflation rates of 7.7% and 5.5%, respectively. Considering \nthe  composition  of  construction  materials  in  project  costs,  the  price  escalation  for  the  Project  is \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nestimated at 5.5% per year. The price contingencies provided under the original Project, amounting \nto 12% of the base cost, were thus insufficient to cover the real price increase of around 37%.  \n \n29. \nCost  Increase  Resulting  from  Changes  in  Project  Scope  and/or  Design.  During  the \ndetailed design and implementation of the Project, it has undergone some changes in design and \nphysical  scope  as  noted  earlier,  including  the  inclusion  of  Borough  VII,  the  changes  in  the  canal \nimprovement  works,  an  increase  in  the  number  of  project-affected  persons  to  be  resettled, \nchanges in the entitlements for the affected families a reduction in the equipment component, and \nan increase in project implementation assistance caused by the delay in implementation. Based on \na  cost  estimate  analysis  broken  down  by  component  (Appendix  5),  of  the  total  cost  increase \nresulting  from  such  changes  (30%),  changes  in  project  scope  contribute  around  13%  and  the \nbalance, i.e., 17%, can be explained by design changes, such as the change from a separate to a \ncombined sewer system and increase in number of pumping stations required for the system. \n \n30. \nCost  Increase  due  to  Underestimation.  Engineers\u2019  cost  estimates  during  the  original \nProject  appraisal,  which  were  subsequently  reflected  in  tender  documents,  were  based  on  the \nschedule  of  rates  (state-imposed  ceilings  on  rates  that  are  periodically  updated  but  do  not \nnecessarily  reflect  market  rates).  The  bids  for  the  tendered  contracts  under  the  Project  indicated \nthat  the  variation  between  the  engineers\u2019  estimates  and  the  bid  amounts  has  been  rather  large. \nThe  cost  increase  due  to  this  underestimation  amounts  to  33%  of  the  total  cost  overrun.  \nThe highest variation (38%) between the estimates and the lowest bid values was observed in the \nS&D improvements packages (Appendix 5). Appendix 5 includes further details at cost overrun and \nprice escalation analysis. \n \nB. \n\nKey Physical Changes and Design Modifications \n\nIn  2003,  the  GoWB  decided  to  build  a  centrally  located  biomedical  and  hazardous  waste \n31. \nmanagement  facility  as  part  of  a  build-own-and-transfer  scheme  for  the  city  rather  than \nconstructing  the  facility  as  originally  expected  under  the  Project.  Therefore,  following  a  request \nfrom the Government of India, $19 million originally allocated for this component was reallocated to \nallow additional S&D improvement works in various wards of Borough VII. Borough VII is the most \ncongested, populous, and rapidly expanding area in the outer periphery of the city and is currently \ndischarging  its  sewage  into  canals,  thereby  creating  a  significant  environmental  hazard.  \nIts inclusion in the Project was considered necessary because it would not only benefit the largest \nnumber  of  beneficiaries  per  unit  investment,  thereby  giving  the  largest  return  on  investment,  \nit would also result in the largest corresponding improvement in Kolkata\u2019s environmental sanitation. \nSome  items  of  equipment  were  also  dropped  from  the  solid  waste  management  component,  as \nthey had either already been purchased by the KMC with its own funds (because of earlier delays \nin  project  implementation)  or  are  no  longer  required  because  of  the  planned  outsourcing  of  solid \nwaste management responsibilities. \n \n32. \nThe  sanitary  landfill  site  previously  identified  under  the  Project  now  falls  within  the  EKW \nboundary,  which  is  now  a  wetland  protected  under  the  Ramsar  Convention.  Therefore,  the  KMC \nhas agreed to identify an alternative parcel of KMC land for the sanitary landfill site. \n \n33. \nAs already mentioned, the KMC is currently conducting a comprehensive study to identify \nthe Project\u2019s potential environmental impacts on the EKW to propose dropping the two STPs from \nthe Project and instead discharging the sewage from Borough VII, part of Borough XI, and Borough \nXII into the DWF channel to be treated through the fisheries in the EKW. \n \n34. \n \nC. \n\nAppendix 6 summarizes all physical changes and their rationales.  \n\nImpact on the Project \n\n35. \nThe proposed supplementary loan will support the KMC in achieving the original objectives \nof  the  Project  (para.  7),  and  will  cover  cost-overruns  and  modified  activities  under  the  following \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n \n\nparts  of  the  Project:  (i)  part  B:  Sewerage  and  Drainage  Improvement;  (ii)  part  C:  Solid  Waste \nManagement;  (iii)  part  E:  Canal  Improvements;  and  (iv)  part  F:  Implementation  Assistance  and \nCapacity  Building.  In  particular,  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  will  cover  civil  works  contracts \nfor  S&D  improvement  works  in  boroughs  VII  and  XV,  STP  construction  for  sewage  effluent  from \nBorough  VII,  rehabilitation  works  in  the  Churial  canal,  pumping  station  at  Gushighata,  and \nadditional consulting services. The supplementary loan is required to complete the full scope of the \nProject and is crucial for sustaining the current momentum and impacts already apparent under the \nProject and ensuring that its objectives and impacts are achieved. \n \nFor ease of administration and monitoring, contracts for civil works and consulting services \n36. \nunder the proposed supplementary loan have been completely separated from the original loan for \nthe  Project.  A  procurement  plan  is  included  in  Appendix  7.  Planning,  layout,  and  detailed \nengineering  design  for  works  in  all  boroughs  have  been  completed  and  tender  documents  have \nbeen  prepared  for  most  of  the  works  to  be  carried  out  under  the  proposed  supplementary  loan.  \nA proposed revised implementation schedule for the Project is included in Appendix 8.   \n \n37. \nThe  capacity  of  the  executing  agencies  to  implement  the  Project  and  undertake  the \nnecessary  procurement  was  reassessed.  Various  measures  have  been  proposed  to  help  the \nexecuting  agencies  strengthen  their  capacity,  for  example,  holding  a  dedicated  procurement \nworkshop  for  the  executing  agencies  with  ADB,  harmonizing  the  procurement  procedures  and \nresources of the KMC and the I&WD, and providing technical assistance (TA) for capacity building \nfor  the  authorities  responsible  for  monitoring  and  managing  ecological  resources. 13  These \nmeasures  and  details  of  the  implementation  capacity  assessment  of  the  executing  agencies  are \nincluded in Appendix 2 and paras. 71\u201374. These assessments show that the executing agencies \nwill have adequate resources and capacity. \n \nD. \n\nRationale for the Proposed Supplementary Loan \n\n38. \nDespite  the  initial  delays  and  subsequent  cancellations  of  parts  of  the  loan  proceeds,  \nproject  implementation  is  now  in  full  swing  and  there  are  strong  justifications  for  providing  the \nsupplementary  loan.  The  EAs  have  overcome  the  steep  initial  learning  curve  and  are  now  well \nequipped  to  complete  the  project  scope.  The  Government  of  India  is  strongly  committed,  and \nduring  the  last  18  months,  substantial  strengthening  of  project  management  has  been  apparent. \nUnder  ADB  financing,  contracts  worth  $120.70  million  have  already  been  awarded  and  the \nremaining  contracts  are  being \nfollow.  \nThe  request  for  supplementary  financing  meets  ADB\u2019s  criteria  under  its  policy  for  supplementary \nfinancing14 as demonstrated by the following: \n\ntendered.  Disbursements  will  soon \n\nfinalized  and \n\n(i)   \n\n(ii)   \n\nThe  Project  is  a  priority  for  both  the  GoWB\u2019s  and  the  Government  of  India\u2019s \ndevelopment  strategy.  The  Administrative  Report  (2001\u20132005)  of  the  Municipal  Affairs \nDepartment  of  the  GoWB15 mentions  the  Project  as  a  priority  and  further  states  that \n\"both  the  state  government  and  the  KMC  are  paying  special  attention  to  proper \nimplementation and timely completion of the Project.\"  \nThe  timely  provision  of  funds  is  critical  for  maintaining  the  current  momentum  and \npositive impacts that are already apparent under the Project. The supplementary loan is \nnecessary to complete the sewerage, drainage, and canal works in an integral manner \nfor the entire catchment area. If the full project scope were not completed, the impacts \nand  objectives  envisaged  for  the  Project  would be  seriously  undermined,  for  instance, \nsome facilities currently under construction would be underutilized or redundant.  \n\n                                                 \n13 A  component  TA  is  currently  being  processed  under  TA  4814-IND  (ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  Cluster  for \nProject  Processing  and  Capacity  Development.  Manila)  to  support  capacity  building  and  training  for  responsible \nauthorities  and  users  of  the  EKW,  including  fishery  cooperatives,  farmers,  and  fishers;  to  develop  a  comprehensive \nEKW management plan; and to strengthen the regulatory framework. \n\n14  ADB. 2005.

Kolkata.  \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n(iii)  \n\n \n\nThe  continued  value-added  involvement  of  ADB  in  this  Project  will  ensure  that  the \nunique ecological characteristics of the EKW are maintained through the application of \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and accumulated knowledge. The EKW, which is part \nof  the  Project,  is  a  Ramsar-protected  site  that  has  been  selected  for  its  approach  to \ntreating  the  city  of  Kolkata\u2019s  wastewater,  whereby  it  efficiently  recovers  nutrients  from \nthe wastewater and uses the treated water for pisiculture (fish farming) and agriculture. \nThe  significant  demonstration  effect  of  the  Project  in  relation  to  eco-friendly  best \npractices  in  the  urban  sector  can  be  maximized.  An  evaluation  study  of  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  notes  that  \u201cADB  has  not  maximized  its  potential  for  value \naddition  to  client  countries  such  as  India.\u201d  This  opportunity  to  realize  this  potential \nshould not be missed.  \nThe  Project  remains  technically  feasible  and  economically  and  financially  viable  and \ncomplies  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements.  By  rationalizing  and  extending  the \ncoverage  to  a  new  borough,  the  most  congested  and  rapidly  expanding  area  in \nKolkata\u2019s  outer  periphery,  the  Project  enhances  and  further  strengthens  the  original \nobjectives  and  extends \nthan  150,000  additional \nbeneficiaries.  \nThe  steps  listed  in  the  matrix  of  due  diligence  for  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  supplementary \nfinancing (footnote 14) have all been observed and all new or revised policies approved \nby  the  Board  since  the  original  appraisal  of  the  Project  have  been  taken  into \nconsideration as required by the policy. \nThe  provision  of  this  supplementary  loan  will  permit  ADB  to  continue  to  assist  the \nGoWB  with  its  governance  and  anticorruption  reforms  and  will  enhance  ADB\u2019s  long-\nterm relationship with the GoWB. \nThe financial health of both the KMC and the GoWB is sound as demonstrated by the \nfinancial analysis. \n\nthe  project  benefits \n\nto  more \n\n(iv)  \n\n(v)   \n\n(vi)  \n\n(vii)  \n\n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n39. \nSocial. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the Project is in Appendix 9. \nThe  executing  agencies  prepared  an  updated  resettlement  plan  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  in \nline  with  (i) the  Land  Acquisition  Act  (1894,  amended  in  1984),  (ii) the  National  Policy  on \nResettlement  and  Rehabilitation  for  Project  Affected  Families, 16  and  (iii) ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995). A summary of the updated resettlement plan is in Appendix 10. \nThe  Project  design  has  carefully  incorporated  engineering  solutions  to  minimize  land  acquisition \nand resettlement impacts.17 Changes in project design had the objective of minimizing disruptions \nto the project area population. In the case of canal improvements, which affect the most people of \nall the project components, design changes avoided densely populated canal tracts.18 Component \nsiting and alignment continue to be studied with the objective of further reducing land acquisition \nand resettlement impacts as the Project is implemented. \n \n40. \nFor  the  S&D  improvement  component,  the  2.58  hectares  required  for  sewage  pumping \nstations  is  government  land.19 STP  works  will  be  within  existing  facilities.  The  S&D  improvement \ncomponent will result in temporary impacts because of the construction of trunk sewer lines. Solid \nwaste management components will be sited on a 60-hectare KMC property. The eventual closure \nof  the  current  landfill  site  will  affect 655  garbage  sorters.  For  the  canal  improvement  component, \n\n                                                 \n16  Government  of India. 2003.

Gazette \n\nof India, Delhi. \n\n17 For example, the need for maintaining an engineering right-of-way on either side of the canals have been reconsidered \nin  light  of  the  impacts  on  shopkeepers,  and  the  engineering  right-of-way  will  be  maintained  on  one  bank  without \ndisturbing shops. \n\n18 For  example,  in  the  case  of  the  Keorapukur  canal,  works  were  reduced  from  9  km  to  1.15  km.  In  the  case  of  the \nChurial canal, the same objective of avoiding a densely populated settlement was achieved through a slight diversion \nthrough the Churial extension canal that involved an increase in the canal\u2019s length from 24 km to 27.55 km. \n\n19 Eight drainage pumping stations originally proposed have been dropped from the Project based on the revised project \n\ndesign. \n\n\f \n\n11\n \n\n \n\n \n\n77.31 km of canals will be improved. While land acquisition is not required at the canal sites, it will \naffect  3,626  households  dwelling  along  the  canals.  Government  land  will  be  used  for  relocation \nsites. \n \n41. \nThe Project\u2019s positive environmental impacts will result in public health benefits and it will \nimprove  the  quality  of  life  of  urban  residents.  While  no  significant  adverse  impacts  on  vulnerable \ngroups have been identified, the resettlement plan will provide additional entitlements to vulnerable \naffected  persons,  including  indigenous  peoples,  should  they  experience  adverse  resettlement \nimpacts. \n \n42. \nEnvironmental.  Environmental  screening  and  an  assessment  of  the  Project\u2019s  physical \nscope and design changes were carried out, and a revised IEE (Supplementary Appendix D) was \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines  (footnote  6).  The  Project  has  been  recategorized  as  category  B  (sensitive)  for \nenvironment.  The  summary  IEE  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  has  been  disclosed  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s disclosure and public communication policies. \n \n43. \nA  draft  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  has  been  prepared  as  part  of  the  revised \nIEE for the management and monitoring of environmental impacts arising from the existing scope \nand design of the Project. The revised IEE and the draft EMP take into consideration the potential \nimpacts, the proposed mitigation measures, and the environmental monitoring program allowing for \nthe  most  sensitive  case  scenario  (for  potential  environmental  impact  purposes),  i.e.,  the  sewage \nfrom  concerned  boroughs  being  treated  through  the  fisheries  and  agriculture  in  the  EKW. 20  \nA  comprehensive  environmental  study  will  be  undertaken  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \napproval prior to any proposed diversion of sewage into the EKW. \n \nThe revised IEE shows that the Project, including works under the proposed supplementary \n44. \nloan,  will  still  result  in  net  environmental  benefits.  The  draft  EMP,  the  EKW  management  plan \ncurrently  being  prepared  with  Project  support,  and  the  legal  framework  for  the  EKW  (the  EKW \nConservation and Management Act 2006) will further ensure that adequate measures are taken to \nmitigate potential impacts on the EKW and the wider environment. \n \nF. \n\nRevised Cost Estimates \n\n45. \nRevised  costs  for  the  Project,  including  those  to  be  financed  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary loan, are estimated at $401.4 million including taxes and duties, physical and price \ncontingencies,  and  front-end  fees.  However,  commitment  and  interest  charges  have  not  been \nincluded  in  line  with  Government  policy  to  pay  interest  during  construction  when  it  becomes  due \nrather than capitalizing it. Table 3 summarizes the revised cost estimates for the Project. Details of \nrevised  cost  estimates  are  included  in  Appendix  11.  Appendix  12  presents  details  of  the  revised \neconomic analysis. \n \nG. \n \n46. \nThe  original  loan  of  $250.0  million  was  allocated  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR.  The  available  loan \namount is now $177.8 million. With an additional $80.0 million proposed under the supplementary \nloan from ADB\u2019s OCR, the total available ADB loan amount will be $257.8 million. The Government \nof India requested that the repayments of the supplementary OCR loan be fully synchronized with \nthe repayments of the original loan.21 Consequently, the supplementary OCR loan will have a term \n\nRevised Financing Plan \n\n                                                 \n20 Authorities  have  been  identified  for  implementing  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  requirements.  Responsibilities \nfor reporting and review, cost estimates, and feedback and adjustment have been identified. The PMUs will submit to \nEMP progress reports to ADB on a 6-monthly basis, including monitoring results.  The EMP ensures proper operation \nand maintenance of fisheries facilities to improve water treatment functions and maintain them at a desired level. \n\n21  This is allowed under the OM Section H5/BP.

The proposed supplementary loan \nwill  cover  70.4%  ($80.0  million)  of  the  additional  financing  requirement  of  $113.6  million.  Of  the \ntotal  investment  costs,  the  GoWB  will  finance  18.5%  and  the  KMC  will  finance  17.3%,  which  will \ninclude  taxes  and  duties,  land,  a  portion  of  contingencies,  civil  works,  and  incremental \nadministration. ADB\u2019s loan funds will fund part of civil works, equipment, consultancy services and \na portion of contingencies. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 4.  \n \n48. \nThe  Government  of  India  will  pass  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  on  to  the  GoWB  as \n70% debt on the same terms and conditions as for the original loan and 30% grant. The GoWB will \nthen onlend the full amount of the loan portion to the KMC on the same terms and conditions as for \nthe original loan, and the grant portion will be passed on to the KMC also as a grant. The existing \nonlending agreement, signed between KMC and GoWB, will be revised, as acceptable to ADB, to \nreflect the changes arising from the proposed supplementary loan. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n22  Repayments will commence on 1 July 2007. \n\n\f13\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGoWB \n\nKMC \n\nTable 4: Revised Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \n\nOrdinary Capital Resources:  Original Allocation \nOrdinary Capital Resources: Supplementary Allocation      \n\nGoWB Contribution: Original Allocation \nGoWB Contribution: Supplementary Allocation \n\nKMC Contribution: Original Allocation \nKMC Contribution: Supplementary Allocation \n\n \n\nTotal \n\nGoWB = Government of West Bengal, KMC = Kolkata Municipal Corporation.  \na  This is less than the current cost-sharing for India, which is 70%. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nH. \n\nRemedial Steps \n\n$ million \n257.8 \n177.8 \n80.0 \n74.1 \n54.6 \n19.5 \n69.5 \n55.4 \n14.1 \n401.4 \n\nPercent \n64.2a \n \n \n18.5 \n \n \n17.3 \n \n \n100.0 \n\n49. \nReliable  Costing. To minimize underestimation and/or overestimation errors in the future, \nadequate  steps  have  been  taken  during  cost  estimation  that  include  (i) the  use  of  an  updated \nschedule  of  rates  (2005)  applicable  to  the  KMC  and  of  market  rates  where  applicable,  (ii) an \nadequate premium to take into account the gap between the engineers\u2019 estimates and contracted \namounts  based  on  already  tendered  work  packages,  (iii) the  use  of  adequate  provisions  for  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  requirements,  and  (iv) a  requirement  for  implementation  assistance \nduring  the  revised  project  period.  As  the  preparation  of  detailed  engineering  design  and  tender \ndocuments  has  already  been  completed  for  most  remaining  contracts  under  the  Project,  the \nvariation  that  generally  arises  during  the  detailed  engineering  design  phase  has  already  been \nminimized. Annual cost updates will be continued and will be monitored by project review missions. \n \n50. \nPrice  Contingencies. Adequate price contingencies have been included to accommodate \nprice  escalation.  Given  the  status  of  remaining  works,  which  are  mostly  at  the  tender  stage,  the \nrisks of time overruns are minimized. Furthermore, adequate provisions have been included in the \ncost estimates to meet unforeseen variations during the contract implementation period. To provide \nrisk  coverage  for  the  uncompleted  and  ongoing  work  packages  under  the  original  loan,  an \nadequate contingency of about 16% is provided under the supplementary loan. \n \nin \n51. \nconstruction activities is essential. For this purpose, the PMUs will continue to update the existing \ncritical  path  method  diagrams  as  part  of  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  and  to \nimplement necessary measures. The implementation periods for ongoing and future packages and \nthe revised Project completion date are reasonable and the capacity of the executing agencies to \nimplement the Project is adequate, hence the risk of time overruns is minimal. \n \nI. \n\nfurther  cost  overruns,  minimizing  delays \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nImplementation.  To  prevent \n\nTimely \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n52. \nImplementation arrangements for the proposed supplementary loan will remain the same as \nfor  the  original  loan  for  the  Project.  The  two  PMUs  established  under  each  of  the  executing \nagencies\u2014the  I&WD  and  the  KMC\u2013will  continue  to  implement  the  respective  components  of  the \nProject,  i.e.,  the  I&WD  PMU  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  implementing  canal  improvement \nworks,  while  the  KMC  PMU  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  implementing  all  the  remaining \nworks,  such  as  S&D  improvement  works,  slum  improvements,  solid  waste  management,  and \nstakeholder consultation. As the two PMUs share the same premises and supporting consultants, \ncoordination between the two is already good. \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n53. \nTo improve efficiency and streamline project implementation, the KMC will act as the lead \nexecuting agency responsible for overall project planning, budgeting, reporting, and execution and \nthe  primary  point  of  contact  for  ADB  for  the  revised  project  period.  While  the  PMUs  share \nconsultants,  such  as  the  design  and  construction  supervision  consultant  (DSC)  and  the  project \nmanagement  consultant  (PMC),  as  well  as  the  Social  Development  Unit,  the  KMC  PMU  will \ncontinue  to  manage  consultants/  contracts  and  be  accountable  for  ensuring  that  all  ADB  and \nGoWB  policies  and  ADB\u2019s  loan  covenants  for  both  the  original  and  the  supplementary  loan  are \nadhered to during the revised project implementation period. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n54. \nThe Project was originally expected to be implemented over 7 years with a completion date \nof 31 December 2007. Given the delays in Project implementation, it is envisaged that the Project \nwill now be completed by 30 June 2010. The proposed supplementary loan will be implemented in \nparallel  with  the  original  project  activities.  The  completion  date  for  activities  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary loan is 30 June 2010. A proposed revised implementation schedule is included in \nAppendix  8  and  a  detailed  project  schedule  identifying  critical  paths  and  milestones  for  all \npackages is included in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n55. \nProcurement  of  all  goods  and  services  under  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time \nto  time).  All  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $10  million  or  more  will  be \nprocured  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Civil  works  contracts \nestimated  to  cost  less  than  $10  million  will  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. Procurement of goods will, to the extent practicable, be grouped into packages larger \nthan $1 million to be suitable for international competitive bidding procedures. Goods that cannot \nbe grouped into larger contracts and are estimated to cost less than $1 million per contract will be \nprocured  following  national  competitive  bidding  or  limited  international  bidding  procedures,  and \nmiscellaneous  minor  goods  costing  less  than  $100,000  will  be  purchased  following  shopping \nprocedures.  All  NCB  procurement  under  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  shall  be  conducted  in \naccordance  with  the  procurement  procedures  agreed  for  the  original  Loan  Agreement.  In  2004, \nbefore commencement of NCB procurement, ADB reviewed the standard bidding documents to be \nused  under  the  Project  to  ensure  consistency  with  the  ADB  requirements.  Under  the  proposed \nsupplementary  loan,  these  bidding  documents  will  be  reviewed  and  modified  as  necessary  to \nensure  consistency  with  the  updated  ADB  requirements  before  commencement  of  NCB \nprocurement.  All  civil  works,  equipment  purchases,  and  consulting  contracts  under  the  proposed \nsupplementary  loan  will  be  separated  from  contracts  under  the  original  loan  for  the  Project.  \nThe procurement plan for the Project (Appendix 7), which also details contracts to be funded under \nthe supplementary loan, will be updated annually by the executing agencies for approval by ADB.  \n \n56. \nThe  two  PMUs  have  requested  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  (i) advance  contracting  to  recruit \nconsultants and to procure goods and civil works; and (ii) retroactive financing of up to 20% of the \nproposed supplementary loan amount for eligible expenditures, including consultants, goods, and \ncivil works, incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but no earlier than 1 January 2006 or 12 months \nbefore  the  signing  of  the  Loan  Agreement.  Advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  are \nnecessary  to  avoid  any  disruption  and  ensure  smooth  and  continuous  project  implementation.  \nThe  two  PMUs  have  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive \nfinancing does not constitute a commitment to finance the supplementary loan. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n57. \nUnder  the  original  loan  for  the  Project,  an  international  consulting  firm  has  already  been \nengaged  as  the  PMC  and  a  national  consulting  firm  has  been  engaged  as  the  DSC  following \nADB\u2019s  quality-based  selection  procedures.  Additional  consulting  services  under  the  PMC  \n\n\f \n\n15\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(63 person-months) and the DSC (367 person-months) will be required to implement the Project, \nincluding  works  under  the  proposed  supplementary  loan.  The  proposed  additional  consulting \nservices will be provided by the respective firms currently working as the PMC and DSC, which will \nbe engaged for the additional works under the supplementary loan through single source selection \nprocedures  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). The executing agencies have found the performance of both firms to be satisfactory, \nand single source selection is considered to be the most appropriate and advantageous method for \nthe selection of the PMC and DSC, because the proposed tasks represent a natural continuation of \ntheir previous work. Each of the firms will be requested to provide a biodata technical proposal for \nthe KMC\u2019s and ADB\u2019s review and for subsequent negotiations. \n \n58. \nIn  addition,  a  national  firm  will  be  engaged  as  creative  consultants  to  provide  consulting \nservices  for  30  person-months  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nusing quality- and cost-based selection procedures. As these services will involve public relations, \nincluding  extensive  consultations  with  affected  families  and  other  stakeholders,  local  firms  are \ndeemed  to  be  appropriate.  Furthermore,  an  adequate  number  of  local  firms  qualified  to  perform \nsuch services exists in the market. Outline terms of reference for additional consulting services are \nincluded in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n59. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith the KMC and the GoWB. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, \nand transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nrelevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records \nand accounts of the executing agencies; the PMUs; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \nThe GoWB and the KMC are already implementing various anticorruption and governance \n60. \nmeasures  in  the  Project,  for  example,  (i)  public  disclosure  of  project  progress,  including  physical \nand  financial  details,  via  information  centers,  newspapers,  and  the  Project\u2019s  website;  (ii)  public \naudits  of  project  works  by  field-level  committees  in  every  borough;  (iii)  public  disclosure  of  the \nresults of all tenders on the Project\u2019s website; (iv) mobilization of third-party \u201cflying squads\u201d to carry \nout random spot checks of quality and safety aspects at work sites; (v) development of a regulatory \nframework for better management of the EKW area; (vi) redress of public grievances through such \nmeans as complaint registers at information centers, an online complaint handling system, and a \nrequirement  to  respond  to  complaints  within  24  hours  of  receipt;  and  (vii)  computerization  of  all \ndata relating to contracts under the Project. The GoWB and the KMC will ensure strict adherence \nto such Project-specific anticorruption measures (Appendix 13).  \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n61. \nDisbursement  of  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  proceeds  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  detailed \narrangements between ADB and the GoWB. No imprest account has yet been established with the \nReserve  Bank  of  India  for  the  original  loan.  The  KMC  may  request  the  opening  of  a  separate \nimprest account for the supplementary loan to ensure timely release of loan proceeds and efficient \nproject  implementation.  The  KMC  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  imprest  account  and \nensuring  timely  release  of  funds.  The  KMC  may  also  establish  a  second-generation  imprest \naccount  in  a  noninterest  bearing  current  account  with  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB. \nADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures will be followed to replenish and liquidate the imprest \naccount for eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 per payment. The advance to the imprest \naccount  and  the  second-generation  imprest  account  will  be  limited  to  projected  disbursement  for \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nthe next 6 months, or 5% of the loan, whichever is lower. Auditors, satisfactory to ADB, will audit \nthe  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedures.  A  separate  audit \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedures  will  be \nincluded in the annual audit report. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n62. \nThe  PMUs  will  continue  to  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify \nfinancing  resources  received  and  expenditures  made  on  the  Project,  including  all  goods,  works, \nand services financed by the supplementary loan proceeds, the KMC, and the GoWB. The project \naccounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound \nauditing  standards  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMUs  will  submit  annual  audited  reports \nand related financial statements to ADB within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year. The KMC \nwas made aware of ADB\u2019s policy on delayed submission, and also of the importance of satisfactory \nand acceptable quality, of audited reports. The KMC, as the lead executing agency for the Project, \nwill  support  the  I&WD  in  ensuring  that  financial  audit  statements  for  the  Project  are  submitted \nwithin the agreed time frame.  \n \nThe  PMUs  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports,  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB,  with \n63. \ninformation  on  (i) progress  made  against  established  targets,  including  preidentified  monitoring \nindicators;  (ii) delays  and  problems  encountered,  and  actions  taken  to  resolve  them;  (iii) work \ncarried  out  by  consultants;  (iv) updated  results  of  water  quality  monitoring  and  action  taken  on \nloan  covenants; \nproblems  encountered;  (v) changes \n(vii) proposed program of activities for the next quarter; and (viii) progress expected during the next \n3 months. The quarterly report will be submitted to ADB by the end of first week of the following \nquarter. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMUs will prepare and submit to \nADB a project completion report on the execution of the Project, including its costs and compliance \nwith the loan covenants. \n \n\nin  project  staff;  (vi) compliance  with \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe  BME  process  currently  being  carried  out  by  the  executing  agencies  will  include  the \n64. \nproposed supplementary loan, and the BME for the Project will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  the  project  performance  monitoring  system.  The  collection  of  BME  baseline \ndata, including contracts under the proposed supplementary loan, will be completed by the end of \nDecember  2006.  These  data  will  be  used  as  benchmarks  for  monitoring  project  outcomes, \nincluding of the proposed supplementary loan, throughout the Project period. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nBecause  of  implementation  delays,  the  midterm  review  of  the  Project  has  not  yet  been \n65. \ncarried out. A comprehensive midterm review will be carried out in December 2007, by which time \nall  major  contracts  should  have  been  awarded  and  commenced,  including  contracts  financed  by \nthe supplementary loan. The midterm review will include a comprehensive review; an evaluation of \nthe  project  outputs  against  the  indicators  set  by  the  BME;  and  a  review  of  implementation \narrangements,  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  of  progress  on  the  Capacity-Building \nProgram.  The  midterm  review  will  also  identify  implementation  constraints  and  critical  issues,  \nif  any,  in  order  to  recommend  corrective  measures  and  adjustments  in  the  project  design  for \nspeedy implementation. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n66.  With an increase in the number of beneficiaries by more than 150,000 and in the number of \nproperty  connections  to  sewer  lines  by  30,200  (original  target  90,000,  revised  target  120,200),  \nthe  design,  scope,  and  coverage  of  most  components  of  the  Project  have  been  refined  and \n\n\f \n\n17\n \n\n \n\n \n\nexpanded.  Therefore  the  benefits  and  impacts  anticipated  under  the  Project  not  only  remain \nrelevant, but will be further enhanced. \n \n67. \nThe Project will improve the urban environment and enhance human capital, which will lead \nto  improvements  in  health  and  increased  productivity,  particularly  among  slum  dwellers  and  the \npoor, especially poor women. In the long run, improved health will contribute to better educational \nstandards and economic growth. The Project will have large benefits for women. As caretakers of \nthe  home  environment,  women  are  particularly  affected  by  poor  living  conditions,  especially  poor \nsanitation conditions, and improved environmental sanitation will enhance their quality of life. Given \nits framework to mitigate environmental and social risks effectively, the Project will help ensure that \nthe ecological characteristics of the EKW are not adversely affected. \n \n68. \nEconomic  Analysis.  An  economic  analysis  of  the  components  considered  for  the \nproposed  supplementary  loan  was  carried  out,  namely,  the  S&D  improvement  and  canal \nimprovement  component.  The  analysis  reappraised  the  economic  viability  of  the  components \nincorporating design changes, revised cost estimates, and updated information available from the \nsocioeconomic survey. \n \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  S&D  improvement  component  is \n69. \nestimated at 12.7% for the full project scope including all seven boroughs and at 11.8% for the two \nboroughs under the supplementary loan. Both these figures are around the economic opportunity \ncost of capital of 12.0%. For the canal improvement component, the EIRR is estimated at 19.2%, \nmuch  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  12.0%.  Combining  both  S&D  and  canal \nimprovement components, the EIRR is estimated at 13.3%. The sensitivity analysis with respect to \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  and  assumptions  about  the  beneficiaries  demonstrates \nthe robustness of the analysis. Appendix 12 presents details of the revised economic analysis. \n \n70. \nThe  analysis  does  not  include  some  important  benefits  that  are  difficult  to  quantify  at \npresent  or  might  incur  double  counting  under  some  circumstances.  These  benefits  include \n(i) reduced private and public costs of mosquito control, (ii) appreciation of land values because of \nthe  improved  environment  and  the  reduced  risk  of  flooding,  (iii) psychological  benefits  from \nreductions  in  morbidity  and  mortality,  (iv) reduced  disruptions  to  traffic  because  of  flooding, \n(v) benefits to visitors and nonresidents working in the areas, and (vi) positive impacts on tourism \nand tourist-related businesses. If these nonquantified benefits were considered, the EIRR would be \nmuch higher. \n \n71. \nFinancial Analysis. A financial analysis was carried out to confirm the financial viability of \nthe  components  as  determined  during  the  original  Project  appraisal  using  the  revised  cost \nestimates  and  paying  particular  attention  to  the  components  considered  for  funding  under  the \nproposed  supplementary  loan.  Hence  the  S&D  improvement  component,  the  only  revenue-\ngenerating  component,  was  reappraised  to  confirm  its  financial  viability.  As  the  KMC  has  no \nnonrevenue-generating  components  to  maintain  and  the  revenue-generating  component  may  not \nbe self-financing within the sector, the KMC\u2019s overall financial capacity was also assessed. \n \n72. \nThe  functional  efficiency  of  accounting  practices  in  the  KMC  has  recently  improved \nconsiderably.  The  preparation  of  accounts  and  financial  statements  on  a  timely  basis  and  the \ncompletion of the backlog of audits are among the loan covenants that the KMC has complied with. \nIn  addition,  various  reforms  in  accounting  procedures  are  under  way  in  the  KMC  under  the \nCapacity-Building Program funded by the DFID. By 2008, a fully computerized accounting system \nis  expected  to  be  in  place.  Training  the  KMC\u2019s  accounting  personnel  in  the  newly  computerized \nenvironment  is  also  progressing.  This  capacity  building  is  expected  to  improve  the  KMC\u2019s  tax \ncollection efficiency to 80% of the total dues as required under the loan covenants for the original \nProject. \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n73. \nThe  KMC\u2019s  financial  performance  for  the  last  5  years  shows  that  it  has  achieved  a  cash \nsurplus in its revenue account since FY2003. From FY2001 to FY2005, revenues generated by the \nKMC  have  increased  from  around  66%  of  the  total  amount  billed  to  73%,  thereby  reducing  its \ndependence  on  transfers  from  the  GoWB.  During  the  same  period,  collection  efficiencies  for \nproperty  taxes  and  commercial  and  bulk  water  supply  charges  improved  substantially  from  24% \nand 29%, respectively, to 64% and 66%, respectively. However, the proposed reforms to introduce \narea-based  property  taxes  and  user  charges  for  water  and  sewerage  are  long  overdue.  Once \nthese are implemented, the KMC\u2019s receipts under the revenue account will improve considerably. \n \nThe  S&D  improvement  component  covered  under  the  proposed  supplementary  loan \n74. \n(boroughs VII & XV) is estimated to have a financial internal rate of return of 6.6%, which is above \nthe weighted average of cost of capital of 4.9%. Even though the full S&D improvement component \nunder  the  original  loan  and  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  together  is  estimated  to  have  a \nfinancial internal rate of return of only 1.31%, the S&D improvement component can generate more \nthan enough revenues to cover the incremental O&M costs resulting from the Project. Indeed, the \nincremental revenues from the Project are estimated to cover the full O&M costs as well as 58% of \nthe capital costs resulting from the Project. Given that 30% of the capital costs are provided as a \ngrant, the actual subsidy required for the S&D improvement component is not a substantial burden \nfor the KMC (Supplementary Appendix H: provides details). \n \nB. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nRisks and assumptions originally identified under the Project were reassessed to establish \n75. \ncontinued  and  additional  risks  to  the  Project,  including  those  specific  to  the  proposed \nsupplementary  loan,  and  to  recommend  mitigation  measures.  Key  risks  identified  during  the \noriginal Project appraisal pertained to (i) land acquisition, (ii) user charges, (iii) rationalization of the \nKMC\u2019s  staff,  (iv) property  tax  reforms,  and  (v) state  of  the  GoWB\u2019s  public  finances.  Significant \nprogress  on  land  acquisition  for  the  Project,  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  GoWB\u2019s  and  KMC\u2019s \nfinancial soundness, and progress on the Capacity-Building Program for the KMC under the DFID \ngrant  provide  adequate  assurances  that  risks  (i),  (iii),  and  (v)  have  been  minimized  for  both  the \nProject  and  the  supplementary  loan.  With  regard  to  property  tax  reforms,  the  KMC  has  already \nprepared and ratified the necessary legal documents and forwarded them to the legal assembly of \nthe  GoWB,  which  has  provided  assurances  that  a  relevant  act  will  be  effected  by  the  end  of \nFY2007.  Furthermore,  the  original  objective  of  property  tax  reforms  was  to  strengthen  the  then \nailing  financial  standing  of  the  GoWB,  which  is  no  longer  the  case.  The  loan  covenant  on  the \nintroduction  of  user  charges  for  domestic  water  and  sewerage  consumption  is  still  outstanding.  \nTo  minimize  this  risk,  a  phased  and  realistic  tariff  implementation  road  map  with  firm  milestones \nhas been agreed with the GoWB and the KMC to achieve the Project\u2019s original objectives. Such a \nroad  map  has  been  reflected  in  additional  covenants  in  the  proposed  loan  agreement  for \nsupplementary financing.  \n \n76. \nThe risk of delayed implementation, as experienced in the early years of implementation of \nthe  Project,  is  minimal,  as  the  capacity  and  mandate  of  the  PMUs  have  been  significantly \nenhanced  in  the  last  2  years  and  the  PMUs  have  already  completed  detailed  design,  tender \ndocument preparation, and land acquisition for all the remaining major contracts under the Project, \nincluding contracts under the proposed supplementary loan. \n \nEnvironmental  Risks. Risks that may be posed by the possible disposal of sewage from \n77. \nBorough  VII,  part  of  Borough  XI,  and  Borough  XII  into  the  DWF  channel  will  be  mitigated  by  the \nimplementation of adequate mitigation measures and regular monitoring as outlined in the revised \nIEE. \n \n78. \nFinancial  Viability.  The  financial  viability  of  such  revenue-generating  components  as  the \nS&D improvements depends on the proposed user fee structure for the forecast period from 2010 \n(the revised project completion date). It is assumed that by FY2011, the implementation of all S&D \n\n\f \n\n19\n \n\n \n\n \n\nimprovement works will have been completed and that property tax and water and sewerage tariff \nreforms  will  have  been  introduced.  Revenue  collection  from  these  charges  will  determine  cost \nrecovery for the S&D improvement component. In the absence of compliance in relation to these \nreforms,  the  financial  viability  of  the  Project  will  be  compromised.  However,  the  sound  cash  flow \nsituation  projected  for  the  KMC  could  support  the  Project  even  if  this  component  were  not  being \nfinancially sustainable on a stand-alone basis. \n \n79. \nEconomic  Growth  and  Political  Stability.  The  success  of  the  Project  in  achieving  its \nimpacts  assumes  stability  in  the  economic  and  political  environments  of  both  the  Government  of \nIndia and the GoWB. As both governments show ample signs of stability, the risks to the Project \nare minimal. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n(ii) \n\n80. \nIn addition to the assurances set forth in the amended and restated Loan Agreement dated \n24  July  2002  and  the  Project  Agreement  dated  18  December  2001,  both  for  the  Calcutta \nEnvironmental  Improvement  Project,  the  Government  of  India  and  the  GoWB  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i) \n\nThe GoWB and the KMC will ensure that the project director of the KMC PMU continues to \nbe  a special  secretary,  that  the  project  director of  the  I&WD  PMU  continues  to  be  a  chief \nengineer, and that both PMUs continue to have qualified and experienced project staff for \nthe revised duration of the Project. \nThe GoWB and the KMC will ensure that BME of the Capacity-Building Program funded by \nthe  DFID,  is  carried  out.  The  baseline  data  for  the  Capacity-Building  Program  will  be \ncollected and monitoring indicators will be established by March 2007. \nThe GoWB  and the KMC will ensure that the Project\u2019s capacity-building and social sector \ninterventions continue to be supported by the DFID throughout the revised Project period. \nThe  GoWB  will  ensure  that  the  KMC  completes  stakeholder  consultations  and consensus \nbuilding on water tariffs by 31 December 2006. \nThe KMC will complete a study of willingness to pay by 31 December 2006. \nThe  KMC  will  finalize  its  water  tariff  strategy  and  publicly  disclose  it  on  its  website  by  \n31 March 2007. \n(vii) \nThe KMC will have introduced a flat-rate water tax/tariff no later than 30 June 2007. \n(viii)  The  GoWB  and  the  KMC  will  ensure  that  by  28  February  2007,  at  least  100,000  water \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nmeters will have been procured. \nThe GoWB and the KMC will ensure that the city sewerage and drainage master plan has \nbeen completed by 31 March 2007. \nThe KMC will submit to ADB an EMP of the EKW, including a detailed study, satisfactory to \nADB, on the potential impacts of additional sewage discharges from the catchment zones \ncovered under the Project into the EKW in the event the KMC chooses alternative treatment \nthrough the fisheries in the EKW. The study will provide scientific and quantitative evidence \nthat  (a)  all  types  of  sewage-receiving  environments  within  the  EKW  will  be  capable  of \ntreating current and proposed additional sewage discharges to required levels; (b) effluent \ndischarged into receiving waters will meet inland surface water standards, as prescribed by \nlocal  statutes  and  Government  of  India  regulations  and  requirements,  and  those  in  the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  Pollution  Prevention  and  Abatement  Handbook 23 as  referred  to  in  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002);  (c)  current  and  proposed  additional  discharges  will  not  have \nadverse impacts on the ecological resources in the EKW and other receiving environments \nthroughout  the  Project\u2019s  design  life;  and  (d)  associated  canals  and/or  channels  and  the \nEKW  as  a  whole  can  absorb  the  current  and  additional  pollution  load  without  posing  a \nsignificant environmental threat of any kind. The study and the resettlement plan should be \npublicly disclosed and discussed with affected persons in the Project area. \n\n                                                 \n23  World Bank.1998.

As the project \nmanagement  units  (PMUs)  established  for  each  of  the  executing  agencies  share  the  same \npremises  and  supporting  consultants,  coordination  between  the  two  is  good.  The  I&WD  PMU  is \nresponsible for implementing canal works, while the KMC PMU is responsible for implementing all \nother  activities  under  the  Project,  such  as  the  sewerage  and  drainage,  slum  improvement,  and \nsolid waste management works and the community consultation program. \n \nThe  PMUs  are  assisted  by  the  design  and  construction  supervision  consultant  (DSC),  \n2. \nthe  project management  consultant  (PMC),  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  individual \nsocial development and creative consultants. While both PMUs share these consultants, the KMC \nPMU  manages  their  contracts  and  is  accountable  for  ensuring  that  all  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) and Government of West Bengal (GoWB) policies and ADB loan covenants are adhered to \nduring  project  implementation.  Furthermore,  the  KMC  PMU  acts  as  the  lead  PMU  and  is \nresponsible  for  overall  project  planning,  budgeting,  execution,  and  implementation  and  is  ADB\u2019s \nprimary point of contact for the Project.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nIn  2004\u20132005,  the  KMC  and  GoWB  undertook  a  major  initiative  to  reorganize  and \nstrengthen  the  PMUs  to  speed-up  project  implementation,  which  had  been  slow.  This  resulted  in \nthe following:  \n\nAssessment of Implementation and Procurement Capacity \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nUpgrading of the post of project director from the rank of joint commissioner to that \nof  commissioner  of  the  KMC,  with  the  posting  of  a  senior  Indian  administrative \nservice  officer  as  project  director  in  February  2005,  thereby  strengthening  the \nproject director\u2019s decision-making capacity and autonomy.  \nSetting up of a Contracts Management Unit within the KMC PMU headed by a chief \nengineer deputed from the KMC. The other members of the Contracts Management \nUnit  include  two  deputy  chief  engineers,  six  executive  engineers,  and 12  assistant \nengineers. \nEstablishment of a new unit, the Social Development Unit (SDU). The SDU consists \nof  social  sector  staff  seconded  to  the  PMUs  from  the  KMC  and  experts  and \nconsultants engaged  from  the  market.  The  SDU  engages NGOs  to  carry  out  field-\nlevel  activities.  The  SDU  currently  has  4  KMC  staff  and  7  consultants  assisted  by  \n10  NGOs  and  3  community  mobilizers.  The  PMUs  have  also  engaged  benefit \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  consultants,  who  are  supervised  by  the  SDU.  Planning, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation  of  the  stakeholder  consultation  process,  resettlement \nactivities,  and  other  social  sector  initiatives  of  the  Project  are  specific  SDU \nresponsibilities.  Creative  consultants  have  been  engaged  to  provide  design  and \noperational  support  to  the  Project\u2019s  communication  and  public  relations  activities. \nThe allocation of person-months for the DSC and PMC has been revised to suit the \nProject\u2019s current needs.  \nEstablishment  of  a  Project  Accounts  Unit  (PAU),  headed  by  a  senior  state  audit \naccounts officer, which consists of a mix of finance and accounts officers seconded \nto the KMC PMU from the KMC and chartered accountants hired from the market. \nThe Project\u2019s accounting system has been fully computerized and is operational.  \nEstablishment  of  a  separate  Project  Coordination  Unit  in  the  KMC  PMU  under  a \nsenior  administrative  officer  from  the  GoWB\u2019s  civil  service.  Special  officers  are \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nrecruited  for  this  unit  to  look  after  land  acquisition  matters,  environmental  issues, \nand  all  interdepartmental  coordination  issues  arising  during  the  implementation  of \nthe Project.  \n\n \n4. \nThese  structural  changes  were  coupled  with  PMU  empowerment  and  autonomy.  \nThe financial and decision-making powers of the project director are now equivalent to those of the \nKMC\u2019s commissioner. Similarly, the PMUs\u2019 accounting system is now independent, and payments \nand  disbursements  are  being  processed  and  made  from  the  PMUs  rather  than  the  KMC,  which \nwas the practice prior to 2005.  \n \n5. \nThe  Project  Steering  Committee  has  been  reconstituted  with  the  minister  of  municipal \naffairs  as  chair  and  the  project  director  (in  place  of  the  KMC\u2019s  commissioner)  as  the  convenor.  \nA  Project  Review  Committee  has  been  set  up  under  the  mayor  of  Kolkata  to  undertake  monthly \nreviews  of  the  Project.  A  Coordination  Committee  under  the  secretary  of  municipal  affairs  is  in \nplace that includes representatives of all GoWB departments and utility providers connected with \nthe Project.  \n \nThe  I&WD  project  director  is  a  chief  engineer  seconded  from  the  GoWB  to  the  Project. \n6. \nAlthough, unlike the KMC PMU, I&WD PMU has not undergone major changes in its organizational \nsetup, it was sufficiently strengthened during 2005\u20132006 to enable it to implement and monitor the \ncanal  rehabilitation  works.  In  addition  to  the  project  director,  the  I&WD  PMU  has  two  project \nmanagers  who  are  superintending  engineers,  six  executive  engineers,  four  assistant  engineers, \nand one subassistant engineer. \n \n7. \nThe  PMUs  handle  procurement  following  ADB  norms  with  assistance  from  the  DSC  and \nPMC.  The  KMC  PMU\u2019s  Technical  and  Finance  Committee  consists  of  team  leaders  of  the \nContracts  Management  Unit,  Project  Accounts  Unit,  the  DSC,  and  the  PMC.  It  is  headed  by  the \nproject  director.  Relevant  KMC  officials  and/or  engineers  are  invited  to  the  meetings  of  this \ncommittee  as  and  when  required.  The  committee  is  responsible  for  all  procurement  matters, \nincluding the evaluation and recommendation of tenders and bids. Similarly, the I&WD PMU has a \nProject  Implementation  Committee  consisting  of  the  I&WD  project  director,  the  project  manager, \nthe  DSC  team  leader,  and  the  PMC  team  leader.  It  performs  the  same  functions  as  the  KMC\u2019s \nTechnical and Finance Committee.  \n \nThe PMUs have also created a technical subcommittee to oversee the technical aspects of \n8. \nvarious  work  packages  that  consists  of  team  leaders  and  deputy  team  leaders  of  the  Contracts \nManagement Unit, the DSC, and the PMC. This subcommittee meets on a fixed day each week. \nKey PMU officials attend procurement training programs and workshops held in India or abroad on \na regular basis, including those organized by ADB. For consistency and harmonization, during the \nAppraisal Mission for the Project it was agreed that the team leader of the PAU of KMC be made a \npermanent member of the Procurement Committee of the I&WD PMU. For further strengthening of \nthe  two  PMUs\u2019  procurement  skills,  it  was  proposed  by  ADB  that,  with  ADB  support,  a  dedicated \nprocurement  workshop  be  organized  by  the  end  of  2006.  Furthermore,  the  KMC,  as  the  lead \nexecuting  agency  for  the  Project,  will  ensure  that  all  necessary  steps  are  carried  out  in  a  timely \nmanner,  such  as  (a)  providing  training  to  the  I&WD,  (b)  engaging  consultants  and  auditors  as \nrequired, (c) seconding personnel to the I&WD as applicable, and (d) assisting I&WD in submitting \nall required reports and information to ADB. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe  functional  efficiency  of  the  KMC\u2019s  accounting  practices  has  recently  improved \nconsiderably.  The  preparation  of  accounts  and  financial  statements  on  a  timely  basis  and  the \ncompletion of backlogged audits are among the loan covenants that the KMC has complied with. \nAlso  various  accounting  procedures  reforms  are  under  way  in  the  KMC  under  the  Capacity-\n\nAssessment of Financial Capacity \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\n \nBuilding Program funded by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom. \nBy  2008,  a  completely  computerized  accounting  system  is  expected  to  be  in  place.  Training  of \nKMC  accounting  personnel  in  the  newly  computerized  environment  is  also  progressing.  \nThis  capacity  building  among  KMC  accounting  staff  is  expected  to  improve  the  KMC\u2019s  tax \ncollection efficiency to 80% as required under ADB\u2019s loan covenants for the Project. \n \n10. \nThe  KMC\u2019s  financial  performance  for  the  last  5  years  shows  that  it  has  achieved  a  cash \nsurplus.  From  fiscal  year  (FY)  2001  to  FY2005,  revenues  generated  by  the  KMC  increased  from \naround  66%  of  total  receipts  to  73%,  an  average  annual  growth  rate  of  10%.  The  other  major \nsource  of  recurrent  revenues  is  annual  transfers  from  the  GoWB  to  the  KMC.  In  FY2001,  total \ntransfers from the GoWB to the KMC represented 34% of the KMC\u2019s receipts. This figure declined \nto 27% in FY2005, demonstrating a decline in the KMC\u2019s dependence on the state. Nevertheless, \nthe  proposed  reforms  to  introduce  area-based  property  taxes  and  user  charges  for  water  and \nsewerage are long overdue. Once these have been implemented, the KMC\u2019s revenues will improve \nconsiderably.  Further  details  of  the  assessment  of  the  KMC\u2019s  and  GoWB\u2019s  financial  capacity  are \nincluded in Supplementary Appendix H. \n \nThus with the support of consultants and by means of the internal arrangements for dealing \n11. \nwith  various  aspects  of  the  Project,  the  two  executing  agencies  have  adequate  capacity  to \nimplement the Project. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nIMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS SUMMARY1 \n \n\nPart A: Stakeholder Consultation Process \n\nPart B: Sewerage and Drainage Improvements \n\nA. \n \n1. \nThe  stakeholder  consultation  process  is  being  implemented  smoothly.  Implementation \narrangements  for  this  component  were  slightly  rearranged  in  2005  to  improve  the  efficiency  of \nimplementation.  While  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  community-based  organizations, \nand  field-level  coordinators  continue  to  be  responsible  for  field-level  implementation,  a  Social \nDevelopment  Unit  (SDU)  has  been  created,  consisting  of  Kolkata  Municipal  Corporation  (KMC) \nofficials and consultants and shared by both the project management units (PMUs), to manage and \ncoordinate  overall  implementation  of  part  A,  the  stakeholder  consultation  process;  part  D,  slum \nimprovements;  benefit monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  social  interventions  across all  components \nof  the  Project.  With  the  assistance  of  NGOs  and  consultants,  extensive  consultations  on  various \nsocial development issues have been carried out with affected families and other stakeholders.  \n \n2. \nThe community development plan has been finalized and linked to government schemes for \nthe  urban  poor.  Four  NGOs  have  been  engaged  to  help  implement  the  community  development \nplan, and the Project has moved forward with a number of schemes designed to extend short-term \nand  long-term  benefits  to  the  urban  poor,  including  vocational  training,  insurance  schemes,  and \nhealth and hygiene awareness programs. Self-help groups are also being established. The Project \nis  coordinating  with  several  GoWB  agencies  to  ensure  that  these  schemes  dovetail  with  theirs. \nExamples  of  good  practice  include  promoting  house  connections  to  sewer  lines  through  door-to-\ndoor  campaigns,  holding  frequent  public  meetings,  distributing  information  leaflets  to  citizens, \nestablishing  ward-level  coordination  committees,  and  setting  up  information  centers  in  project \nareas and public complaints registers at the contractors\u2019 site offices. These measures are helping \nto generate wide public support for the Project. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nSewerage  and  drainage  (S&D)  improvements  suffered  from  serious  start-up  delays  and \ncontract  awards  and  physical  works  have  only  commenced  in  the  last  18  months.  However, \ndetailed  design  and  tender  document  preparation  for  all  remaining  contracts  have  now  been \ncompleted.  Works  under  six  contracts  are  in  progress  and  major  civil  works  contracts  for  two \nboroughs are being tendered. All contracts under the S&D works will be awarded by March 2007 \nand all works will be completed by mid-2010. The KMC PMU is exploring measures to expedite the \nS&D works to make up for lost time. As part of such efforts, the KMC PMU organized a workshop \nfor contractors in May 2006 to seek feedback and identify potential constraints and opportunities. \nThe participants\u2019 recommendations, such as introducing a bonus clause in remaining contracts, are \nbeing incorporated in the Project\u2019s implementation and contract documentation. \n \n4. \nS&D  works  in  the  project  boroughs  have  been  grouped  under  six  works  packages.  While \nworks under four packages are in progress, bid documents for works packages in Borough XV has \nbeen sent to ADB for approval, and detailed design for works package in Borough VII is complete \nand tender documents are being prepared. In addition, pilot works are being implemented in one \nward of each of the boroughs, of which four packages have been completed and works for the rest \nare in progress. Because of the delayed start-up, however, physical progress for S&D works has \nonly just started, with only 52 kilometers of S&D pipes of the total 424 kilometers under the Project \ncompleted to date.   \n \n5. \nS&D  Pumping  Stations.  Pumping  stations  under  the  Project  are  divided  into  six  works \npackages. Technical evaluation of works package for construction of pumping stations in boroughs \nXII,  XIII,  and  XIV  is  in  progress,  and  works  package  for  augmentation  of  the  existing  pumping \nstations in boroughs I, XI, XIII, XIV, and XV has been tendered. While works package for pumping \n                                                 \n1  As of 10 November 2006. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n27\n\nPart C: Solid Waste Management \n\nProcurement  of  Equipment.  Smaller  equipment  (1  suction  machine,  2  jetting  machines, \n\n \n \nstations in boroughs I and XV is being tendered, tender documents for, works package for pumping \nstations for Borough VII and Borough XV are being prepared. \n \n6. \nSewage Treatment Plants (STPs). Based on the satisfactory outcome of a detailed impact \nstudy, an alternative proposal for treating sewage effluent from boroughs VII and XII and parts of \nBorough  XI  may  be  adopted  and  the  construction  of  two  new  STPs  may  be  dropped  from  the \nProject. Therefore the detailed design of the two STPs has been put on hold. The remaining works \ninclude augmenting three STPs, of which financial evaluation of works package for augmentation \nof  the  South  Suburban  East  STP  is  in  progress;  and  tender  documents  for  works  package  for \naugmentation of the Bangur STP and works package for augmentation of the Garden Reach STP \nare being prepared. Tenders for these two packages will be invited in December 2006.  \n \n7. \nLake  Rehabilitation  Works.  Rehabilitation  works  for  identified  small  parks  and  water \nbodies  have  been  divided  into  two  works  packages.  While  rehabilitation  works  under  the  larger \nworks package have been completed, contract documentation for the remaining works package is \nbeing finalized, with contract award expected in March 2007.  \n \n8. \netc.) has already been procured. The purchase of water meters will start in January 2007.  \n \nC. \n \n9. \nDetailed design of the sanitary landfill is in its final stages. A noteworthy development is that \nthe Project has engaged consultants to package transfer and disposal responsibilities for the city\u2019s \nsolid waste management under a public-private partnership modality. The consultants will conduct \nthe  necessary  viability  assessments  and  options  analysis  and  will  prepare  contract  documents \nunder  an  appropriate  public-private  partnership  modality  for  the  construction,  operation,  and \nfinancing of a solid waste management and disposal system for Kolkata, including the construction \nand  operation  of  the  sanitary  landfill.  In  the  long  run,  the  KMC  is  also  considering  involving  the \nprivate  sector  in  primary  collection  of  solid  waste,  which  will  reduce  and  rationalize  the  massive \nworkforce  currently  engaged  in  the  sector.  Subsequent  to  the  adoption  of  the  findings  of  the \nconsultants\u2019  assessments,  the  tender  process  for  the  new  sanitary  landfill  is  expected  to  start  in \nJune 2007. \n \n10. \nProcurement  of  equipment  and  vehicles  for  collection  efficiency  improvement  is  almost \ncomplete.  This  subcomponent  consists  of  10  packages,  out  of  which  five  packages  have  been \ncompleted:  procurement  of  mechanical  sweepers,  bulldozers,  vehicles  with  containers  and  pay \nloaders.  While  contracts  for  the  purchase  of  other  collection  equipment  has  been  awarded, \ncontract for the procurement of collection bins, push carts, etc. is expected to be awarded in March \n2007.   \n \nD. \n \n11. \nSlum  improvements  are  progressing  well.  Works  have  started  in  all  slum  areas  identified \nunder  the  Project.  Field-level  committees  have  been  formed  in  all  slums  and  meet  at  least  once \nevery month. Four\u2013hundred-and-fifty user groups have already been formed for the operation and \nmaintenance of assets in 14 slums. Similarly, 15 self-help groups have been formed and financing \nsupport  for  the  self-help  groups  has  been  established.  Noteworthy  good  practices  include  the \nintegration  of  slum  improvement  activities  under  the  Project  with  the  KMC\u2019s  poverty  alleviation \nprograms,  resulting  in  long-term  social  security  benefits  for  slum  dwellers,  such  as  insurance \nschemes.  Most  of  the  civil  works  under  the  slum  improvement  component  have  already  been \nimplemented or are under implementation. \n \n\nPart D: Slum Improvement Works \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nPart E: Canal Improvements \n\nCanal  Rehabilitation.  Works  under  this  subcomponent  are  being  implemented  under  \n\n12. \nSlum improvement works are being executed through 15 works packages. Works under the \nfirst  six  packages  have  been  completed.  While  works  four  packages  are  in  progress,  financial \nevaluation  of  three  packages  are  in  progress,  and  the  remaining  packages  are  currently  being \nfinalized for tender. As noted earlier, the community development plan is assisting slum dwellers to \nform self-help groups and to benefit from other long-term Project and Government of West Bengal \ninitiatives.  \n \nE. \n \nCanal  improvements  are  divided  into  three  types  of  packages:  canal  rehabilitation,  bridge \n13. \nconstruction,  and  construction  of  canal  pumping  stations.  While  contracts  for  bridge  construction \nhave  been  awarded,  implementation  of  canal  rehabilitation  and  pumping  station  works  has  been \nslow,  with  only  one  contract  currently  in  the  implementation  phase.  Most  of  the  remaining \npackages  are  at  the  tendering  stage,  and  detailed  engineering  design  of  works  for  the  Churial \ncanal is under way. Similar to the S&D works, this component of the Project has gained renewed \nmomentum only in the last 18 months, and since then has been moving ahead speedily. This part \nalso involves the resettlement of 3,626 families, which is being undertaken as agreed in the original \nand revised resettlement plans. \n \n14. \n11  work  packages.  Works  package  for  rehabilitation  of  downstream  of  the  Tollygunge-\nPanchannagram  canal  has  been  awarded.  Financial  evaluation  of  the  following  packages: \nrehabilitation  of  the  rest  of  the  Tollygunge-Panchannagram  canal  and  Monikhali  canal  (upstream \nand  branch  canals)  have  been  completed.  Detailed  design and  tender  document  preparation  are \nunderway for the remaining works packages.  \n \nConstruction  of  Canal  Pumping  Stations.  Three  canal  pumping  stations  will  be \n15. \nconstructed  under  a  single  package  at  Keorapukur,  Monikhali,  and  Chowbaga  under  a  single \npackage, financial evaluation of which has been completed. A pumping station at Ghushighata will \nbe constructed under a separate package that is currently being designed. \n \n16. \nConstruction of Bridges. The construction of 53 bridges over canals is included under two \nworks  packages.  Work  under  the  first  package,  comprising  23  bridges,  is  in  progress  and  is \nexpected  to  be  completed  in  December  2006.  Work  under  the  second  package,  comprising  \n30 bridges, has recently started.  \n \n17. \nResettlement and Rehabilitation of Canal Bank Dwellers. Of the 3,626 affected families, \n229  families  have  already  been  relocated  in  apartments  being  constructed  by  the  Kolkata \nMunicipal Metropolitan Development Authority under the Valmiki Ambedkar Shahari Aawas Yojna2  \nSimilarly, 352 families will be relocated to these apartments in March 2007. All these families are \ndisplaced  by  canal  works  in  the  Tollygunge-Panchannagram  basin.  In  addition,  the  Project  is \nexpected  to  construct  1,417  apartments  in  phases  at  Nonadanga  by  November  2007.  Another  \n510  apartments  will  be  constructed  in  Kasba  by  June  2007  and  57  more  apartments  will  be \nconstructed  in  Purba  Putiary,  Purba  Barsiha,  and  Sampa  Mirzanagar  by  November  2007  for \nrelocating families affected by other canal works. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  Valmiki Ambedkar Shahari Aawas Yojna (VAMBAY)  is a scheme of the Ministry  of Urban Development and Poverty \nAlleviation  of  the  Government  of  India.  This  scheme,  launched  in  December  2001,  provides  grant  subsidy  for \nconstruction and rehabilitation of the  dwelling units for the slum dwellers and the population living  below the poverty \nline. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29\n\nPart F: Implementation Assistance and Capacity Building \n\nF. \n \n18. \nConsulting  services  by  the  project  management  consultant  and  design  and  construction \nsupervision  consultant  are  ongoing.  In  parallel,  the  Capacity-Building  Program  funded  by  the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  is  being  implemented  by  a \nseparate  KMC  department.  Coordination  between  the  PMUs  and  the  KMC\u2019s  Capacity-Building \nProgram team needs immediate strengthening. Baseline data collection for benefit monitoring and \nevaluation of the Capacity-Building Program has started. The Capacity-Building Program is being \nimplemented  under  the  following  subcomponents  (each  being  carried  out  by  a  consulting  firm \nengaged \n(i)  organizational  development;  \n(ii)  computerization;  (iii)  public  relations  and  communication;  (iv)  geographic  information  system;  \n(v) program management, including implementation, change management and governance, social \ninclusion,  and  urban  planning;  and  (vi)  resource  mobilization.

The  cost  increase  in  sewerage  and  drainage  (S&D)  was  caused  by  (i)  price  escalation  in  construction  materials,  \n(ii)  inclusion  of  Borough  VII,  (iii)  increase  in  property  connections,  (iv)  change  in  design,  (v)  high  risk  premium \nimposed in the bid value (the work areas are heavy traffic zones), and (vi) engineer\u2019s underestimation of enhanced \nfinancing and insurance costs for large international competitive bidding (ICB) packages.  \n\n3. The cost increase in canal improvement works was caused by (i) change in physical scope (e.g., number of bridges, \nand  length  of  canals),  (ii)  underestimation  of  the  project  deliverables,  and  (iii)  engineer\u2019s  underestimation  of  unit \ncosts.  \n\n4. The cost increase in resettlement was caused by change from temporary shelters to permanent shelters. \n5. The  cost  decrease  in  solid  waste  management  (SWM)  was  caused  by  (i)  removal  of  bio  medical  and  hazardous \n\nwaste treatment plant, and (ii) removal of some equipment. \n\n6. The cost increase in implementation assistance was purely caused by an extension of implementation period. \n7.

For  instance,  the \nexisting  pumping  station  at  Beerpara  was  found  to  be  adequate  to  handle  the  flow,  and  hence  the  proposal  for  an \nadditional pumping station was dropped. Similarly, flow generated from an area in Ward 5 could not be diverted directly \nto the Circular Canal because of the area\u2019s physical constraints, thus a new pumping station with a capacity of 610 lps \nwas designed within the existing pumping stations premises.  \n\nHydraulic modeling showed that all six existing pumping stations had to be augmented to cope with the calculated DWF \ndischarge from the area. All DWF is designed to reach the pumping station LS-5, from where it will be pumped to the \nKeorapukur MPS to be pumped to the South Suburban (East) STP.  \n  \n\nThe  number,  size,  and  location  of  these  pumping  stations  were  determined  from  the  conclusions  of  the  hydraulic \nmodeling carried out during the detailed engineering design phase. \n\n2 (total \ncapacity \n50 MLD) \n\n2 (total \ncapacity 150 \nMLD)  \n\nThe capacity of the two STPs proposed will need to be increased to 150 MLD because of the inclusion of S&D works in \nBorough  VII.  However,  the  KMC  is  currently  conducting  a  comprehensive  study  to  identify  potential  environmental \nimpacts on the East Kolkata Wetlands to propose alternative treatment of sewage from Boroughs VII, XI and XII into the \nDWF channel to be treated through the fisheries in the East Kolkata Wetlands.  \n  \n\nOf the four existing DWF pumping stations in Borough XIII, two pumping stations (LS-3 and the Keorapukur MPS) were \nconsidered for augmentation in the original Project design. However, during detailed design it became evident that all \nfour existing pumping stations (LS-1, LS-2, LS-3, and the Keorapukur MPS) needed augmentation in order to pump the \nDWF to the South Suburban (East) STP as originally envisaged.  \n\nPart A: Stakeholder  \nConsultation Process \nNo change in \ndeliverables, mode of \nsupervision rearranged \n\nPart B: Sewerage and  \nDrainage  Improvementsa \nTotal number of \nbeneficiaries  \n\nTotal number of \nconnections  \nBorough I \n\nNew pumping stations  \n\nBorough XI \n\nAugmentation of pumping \nstations \n\nBorough XII \n\nNew pumping stations \n\nSTP \n\nBorough XIII \n\nAugmentation of pumping \nstations \n\n \n\n\fDetails \n\nOriginal  \n\nRevised \n\nDescription \n\n \n\nNew pumping stations \n\nBorough XIV \n\nAugmentation of pumping \nstations \n\nNew pumping stations \n\n4 \n\n  \n\n2 \n\n1 \n\n  \n\n3 \n\n  \n\n1 \n\n  \n\n1 \n\n3 \n\n  \n\n2 \n\nFour new SWF pumping stations were considered in the original Project design. However, after detailed engineering \ndesign (and the fact that the S&D system being built was now a combined one), it was found that one additional \npumping stations at Canal Road would be sufficient to handle the DWF from the area. The remaining SWF will be \ndischarged by gravity.  \n  \n\nThe flow to the existing Jinjira Bazar pumping station (capacity 558 lps) was overestimated during the original project \ndesign. During detailed design and hydraulic modeling, the design flow to this pumping station was estimated to be 344 \nlps, which is well below the capacity of the pumping station. Hence, augmentation of this pumping station was dropped \nfrom the Project.  \nThe  original  Project  design  had  considered  only  one  new  SWF  pumping  station  near  the  Parnasree  canal.  During \ndetailed  design,  it  was  found  that  the  SWF  can  be  achieved  by  gravity  at  this  location.  Furthermore,  during  detailed \nhydraulic modeling and design, it was found that to achieve optimal utilization of existing canals and effective utilization \nof the existing DWF network, three more DWF pumping stations were required: (i) at the Diamond Harbour Road canal \n(capacity  178  lps);  (ii)  adjacent  to  the  Begore  Branch  canal  (capacity  305  lps);  and  (iii)  at  the  Behala  Flying  Club \n(capacity 545 lps).  \n\nOf the three new pumping stations proposed for Borough XV, the Karbala pumping station for DWF and the Monikhali \npumping  station  1  have  been  eliminated,  as  it  was  found  possible  during  the  detailed  design  phase  to  divert  DWF  to \nexisting systems and/or canals by gravity. Due to the lack of land, the location of the Monikhali pumping station 2 was \nshifted to Mudiali for the disposal of SWF to the Monikhali canal. Similarly, detailed design of S&D works in Borough XV \nestablished the need for constructing another pumping station within the existing Santoshpur pumping station premises \nto augment pumping capacity at that location from 464 lps to 1,108 lps.  \n\nSavings from the elimination of the biomedical and hazardous waste subcomponent were reallocated to allow additional \nS&D  works  in  various  wards  of  Borough  VII.  Borough  VII  was  selected  as  it  is  the  most  congested,  populous,  and \nrapidly expanding area in the periphery of Kolkata and is currently discharging its sewage into canals, thereby creating a \nsignificant environmental hazard. Its inclusion in the Project was considered a necessary step, because it would not only \nbenefit the largest number of beneficiaries, thereby giving the largest return on investment, but it would also result in the \nlargest  corresponding  improvement  in  environmental  sanitation  in  Kolkata.  The  design  principles  follow  the  least-cost \napproach and comply with safeguards.  \n\nBorough XV \n\nNew pumping stations \n\n  \n\nBorough VII \n\n  \n\n  \n\nS&D network, pumping \nstations and  \npumping main \n\nBorough \nnot \ncovered \n\nRehabilitation of public \nfacilities (Subhas and \nRabindra lakes) \n\n2 large \nlakes \n\n \n\nAs the rehabilitation of facilities at the Subhas and Rabidra lakes were being taken up by the KMC from its own funds, \nother  parks,  water  bodies,  and  public  spaces  within  Kolkata  have  been  taken  up  based  on  consultations  with  the \nboroughs  under  the  Project  (technically  feasible  and  compliant  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements).  \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3\n7\n\n \n \n\n36.3 km of  \nS&D \nnetwork, \naugmentation \nof 7 pumping \nstations, 3 \nnew pumping \nstations,  \n0.90 km of \npumping \nmain \n14 small \nwater bodies \nand parks \n\n\fDetails \n\nOriginal  \n\nRevised \n\nDescription \n\nPart C: Solid Waste Management \n\nBiomedical and \nhazardous waste facility \n\nProcurement of cleaning, \nwaste collection, and \nother equipment \n\n1 \n\n0 \n\nVarious \n\nVarious \n\nSanitary landfill  \n\n1 \n\n1 \n\nPart D: Slum Improvement \n\nTollygunge-\nPanchannagram basin  \nde-siltation  \nPart E: Canal Improvement Works \n\n \n\nIncrement in the canal de-\nsiltation and lining works, \nand number of bridges \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n3\n8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\nThe  government  of  West  Bengal  decided  to  take  up  construction  of  a  central  biomedical  and  hazardous  waste \nmanagement  facility  as  part  of  a  private  build-own-and-transfer  scheme  for  the  city.  Therefore  the  savings  from  this \nsubcomponent were reallocated to allow additional S&D works in various wards of Borough VII. \nThe equipment budget was slightly reduced because the equipment had either already been purchased by the KMC\u2019s \nown  funds  (because  of  the  delay  in  project  implementation  the  KMC  could  no  longer  wait  for  project  funds  for  some \ncrucial items of equipment) or the items no longer need to be purchased separately because of the planned outsourcing \nof  solid  waste  management  responsibilities  under  the  private  sector  partnership  scheme  currently  being  designed  for \nthe KMC.  \nThe Project is in the process of packaging the entire transfer and disposal part of the solid waste management process \ninto  a  public-private  partnership  contract  and  envisages  private  investment  in  construction  and  operation  of  the \nmunicipal landfill. Therefore the Asian Development Bank\u2019s contribution to the sanitary landfill was reduced. \n\nDe-siltation of the Tollygunge-Panchannagram basin has been taken up under part E: canal improvement works. There \nare  no  significant  deviations  from  other  slum  improvement  works.  As  already  noted,  the  SDU  is  now  responsible  for \noversight of this part of the works. \n\nAfter the cancellation of significant funds from the original loan, the KMC attempted to reshuffle and stretch the available \nfunds by cutting some of the physical scope under the canal components (even though the project preparatory technical \nassistance  and  the  original  Project  appraisal  had  appraised  them).  For  instance,  de-silting  and  lining  of  significant \nlengths of the Churial canal and other canals were dropped. As these subcomponents form an integral part of the larger \ncatchment area, the lack of improvements or their removal from the Project would undermine the impacts and objectives \nenvisaged for the Project. Furthermore, detailed design showed that if the complete canal improvement works were not \ncarried  out,  the  effects  of  the  S&D  system  would  not  be  fully  realized.  Therefore  these  subcomponents  will  be \nimplemented under the proposed supplementary loan. The modifications are based on outputs and recommendations \nfrom  the  hydraulic  modeling  and  the  current  scope  of  S&D  works.  The  basic  objectives  are  to  provide  relief  from \nrecurrent  waterlogging  and  flooding  problems upstream  of  the Tollygunge-Panchannagram  basin.  In some cases, the \ncanal lining length has been reduced. The largest increment has been in the number of bridges (from 30 to 53). These \nwere considered necessary, pursuant to detailed design and hydraulic modeling, to avoid flow obstructions in the canal \nand  to  provide  reasonable  connectivity  in  the  area.  Furthermore,  a  pumping  station  at  Gaushighata,  instead  of  at  the \nChurial canal as in the original design, was found to be more effective for the functioning of the SWF channel and for \nminimizing flooding risks, based on detailed hydraulic modeling and design.  \n\nDWF = dry weather flow, KMC = Kolkata Municipal Corporation, lps = liters per second,   mld = million liters per day, MPS = main pumping station, S&D = sewerage and drainage, \nSDU = Social Development Unit, STP = sewage treatment plant, SWF = storm water flow.  \na   Even  though  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  had  designed  separate  S&D  networks  under  the  original  Project,  it  was  later  negotiated  and  included  in  the  Loan \nAgreement  that  combined  sewers  would  be  built  in  keeping  with  the  city\u2019s  existing  (combined)  system  and  separate  storm  water  drains  would  be  built  where  feasible.  However, \nduring detailed design it was found that most of the lanes and by-lanes in the Project areas are narrow and already contain underground utility cables, therefore laying a separate \nsystem was not deemed feasible. This has resulted in changes in the length of the sewer network, pumping mains, and associated infrastructure; however, overall coverage and \nhousehold connections have increased as shown here. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n39\n\nPROCUREMENT PLAN \n \nTable A7.1 Project Information \n\nIndia \nIndia  \nKolkata Environmental Improvement Project \nLoan 1813-IND and TBD (for the proposed \nsupplementary loan) \n16 April 2002 (original loan), TBD (for the proposed \nsupplementary loan) \n$257.1 million \n$177.8 million \nKolkata Municipal Corporation and Irrigation and \nWaterways Department \nNot applicable \nNot applicable \nThe Telegraph and Anandabazar Patrika \n2000\u20132010 \n\nCountry \nName of Borrower \nProject Name \nLoan or TA Reference \n\nDate of Effectiveness \n\nAmount US$ \nOf which Committed, US$ \nExecuting Agency \n\nApproval Date of Original Procurement Plan \nApproval of most recent Procurement Plan \nPublication for Local Advertisements \nPeriod Covered by this Plan \nTA = technical assistance, TBD = To be decided. \n \n \n\nTable A7.2: Procurement Thresholds, Goods and Related Services,  \nWorks and Supply and Installa \n\nProcurement Method \nInternational Competitive Bidding (ICB) Works \nICB Goods \nNational Competitive Bidding (NCB) Worksb \nNCB Goods \nLimited International Bidding (LIB) \nShopping Works \nShopping Goods \na  These thresholds apply only to the proposed supplementary loan. \nb  The standard bidding documents to be used under the Project will be reviewed and modified as necessary to ensure \nconsistency with the updated Asian Development Bank requirements before commencement of National Competitive \nBidding procurement. \n\nAmount \n$10,000,000 and above  \n$1,000,000 and above \nLess than $10,000,000 \nLess than $1,000,000 \nLess than $1,000,000 \nLess than $100,000 \nLess than $100,000 \n\nTable A7.3: Procurement Thresholds, Consultants Servicesa \n\nProcurement Method  \nConsultants qualifications selection  \nSingle source selection may be used to engage the existing \nproject management consultants, the design and construction \nsupervision consultants for the execution and/or continuation of \nservices under the supplementary loan. \na  These thresholds apply only to the proposed supplementary loan. \n\n \n \n\nAmount \n\nLess than $200,000 \nLess than $100,000 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n \nTable A7.4: List of Contract Packages in Excess of $100,000, Goods, Works and Consulting Servicesa \n\nContract \nNo.\n\nContract Description\n\nEstimated Cost \n($ million)\n\nProcurement \nMethod\n\nExpected Date of \nAdvertisement\n\nPrior Review \nY/N\n\nComments\n\nLoan Source\n\nSewerage and Drainage Improvement\nConstruction of S&D Network for Borough XI -

The Kolkata municipal \narea has a high population density, and between 1950 and 1970 grew by about 20\u201330% each decade, with much of \nthe growth occurring over short periods because of geopolitical events or natural disasters. However, since the 1970s, \nthe rate of population growth has declined considerably. Between 1971 and 1981, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation \n(KMC) recorded an annual growth rate of less than 0.5%, and between 1981 and 1991 the total growth for the decade \nwas  a  little  over  6%.  The  1991  census  recorded  a  population  for  the  Kolkata  municipal  area  of  4.38  million,  with  a \nheavy  concentration  in  the  inner  wards,  which  are  thought  to  have  population  densities  of  up  to  four  times  what  an \nurban area can support on a sustainable basis. Thus people in these areas are likely to move to the outer areas, with a \nconsequent  readjustment  of  population  densities.  The  outer  areas,  which  comprise  the  project  area  for  most  of  the \ncomponents,  currently  have  a  total  population  of  around  1.40  million,  with  densities  ranging  from  7,000  to  29,000 \npeople per square kilometer. Based on land use maps and recent growth trends, the population in the outer areas is \nexpected to grow to around 1.47 million by 2011 and 1.52 million by 2021. \n \nAround 50% of the project area population live in slum housing or worse.1 A slum dwelling is typically a single-roomed, \nsingle-story  dwelling  constructed  of  nonpermanent  building  materials.  About  700,000  people  live  in  such  houses. \nAbout  26\u201330%  of  the  slum-dwelling  households  in  the  project  area  live  below  the  poverty  line,  that  is,  about \n180,000\u2013210,000  people  or  13\u201315%  of  the  project  area  population. 2 Low-income  or  slum  settlements  comprise \nregistered  bustees  (29%  of  the  project  area  population), 3  refugee  colonies  (11%),  unregistered  settlements \n(unregistered  bustees  and  canal  bank  settlements)  (10%),  and  pavement  dwellers.  The  KMC  Act  (1980)  and  the \nThika  Tenancy  Act  aim  to  mainstream  the  poor  into  society  by  providing  them  with  security  of  tenure  and  basic \nservices.  Under  a  series  of  refugee  rehabilitation  schemes,  the  Government  of  West  Bengal  is  progressively \nrecognizing  refugee  colonies  by  providing  them  with  land  titles  and  basic  amenities.  The  KMC  does  not  recognize \nunregistered  settlements  and  pavement  dwellers,  who  are  therefore  not  entitled  to  any  security  of  tenure  or  basic \nservices.  \n\nIn  the  project  area,  only  17%  of  residents  have  a  sewerage  connection,  fewer  than  50%  are  covered  by  a  drainage \nsystem,  and  70%  are  served  by  solid  waste  collection.  While  infrastructure  deficiencies  affect  all  segment  of  society, \nthey particularly affect the urban poor, more than 90% of whom must share toilet facilities. Drainage systems are aging \nand inadequate, which gives rise to frequent flooding and environmental contamination of low-lying residential areas. \nIndustrial  wastes  flow,  largely  untreated,  into  the  surrounding  environment,  exposing  the  community  to  acids,  toxic \nchemicals, paints and varnishes, and other highly toxic compounds. Smoke from the burning of dung, wood, coal, and \nkerosene  inside  slum  dwellings  predisposes  occupants,  especially  young  children  and  women,  to  acute  respiratory \ninfections.  Some  77%  of  respondents  to  a  socio-economic  survey  conducted  during  project  preparation  reported \nhaving  no  separate  and  dedicated  cooking  area.  Degradation  of  the  environment  is  leading  to  increasing  concern \nabout  morbidity  and  mortality  rates.  Although  the  KMC\u2019s  database  on  public  health  is  limited,  it  shows  that  mortality \nrates  due  to  acute  respiratory  infections  and  diarrhea  account  for  around  29%  of  all  infant  deaths.  The  population \ndensity  typical  of  slum  settlements  remains  a  major  public  health  concern  with  regard  to  the  transmission  of \ncommunicable diseases, especially tuberculosis. \n \n \nB. \n \nAn estimated 200,000 people live below the poverty line in the project area. The stakeholder consultation process and \nthe Capacity-Building Program will have a direct impact on poor groups through the development of mechanisms and \napproaches  to  the  design  and  operation  of  projects  that  will  specifically  make  provisions  for  the  underprivileged.  In \n\nPoverty Analysis                                                                  Proposed Classification: Targeted Intervention \n\n                                                 \n1  For  classification  purposes,  the  term  slum  refers  to  low-income  settlements  with  a  high  population  density  that  lack \n  adequate public services and amenities. \n2  The poverty line is defined as the income necessary to buy food to meet a daily intake of 2,400 calories of energy in \n \n3  A bustee is a settlement of primarily low-income people. \n\nrural areas or 2,100 calories in urban areas and certain basic nonfood items, such as clothing and transportation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\naddition, the stakeholder consultation process will empower communities, enabling them to participate more actively \nand constructively in all civic matters. Up to 5 million people will benefit from the Project, of which some 50% reside in \nslum  settlements.  Under  the  Capacity-Building  Program,  skills  will  be  developed  in  the  KMC,  in  nongovernmental \norganizations  (NGOs),  and  in  community-based  organizations  to  ensure  effective  program  delivery,  and  systems \nwill be institutionalized under the Project. The Program will also empower civil society in general. Extending access to \nthe sewerage system and ensuring better solid waste management for the poor will enhance their health.  \n\nThe project interventions in the slum communities  will address poverty in two  ways. First, the slum communities  will \nhave  greater  access  to  basic  facilities,  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Second,  the  standard  of  shelter  in  the \nslums  is  expected  to  improve,  as  the  communities  will  be  offered  financial  assistance  to  rehabilitate  their  homes, \nwhere appropriate. About 190,000 slum dwellers  will benefit from direct slum intervention under the Project. A crisis \nmanagement approach  will be adopted to address immediate needs for water supply and sanitation in unrecognized \nlow-income  settlements.  Up  to  65,000  slum  dwellers  will  benefit  from  targeted  settlements  in  Cossipore,  Garden \nReach, and Jadavpur. Proposed civil works include (i) providing water standposts (9,350 units), (ii) constructing and/or \nconverting  sanitary  latrines  (4,200  units),  (iii)  constructing  and/or  renovating  community  latrines  (910  units),  and \n(iv) constructing washing and/or bathing platforms (430 units). Longer-term improvements will include a wide range of \namenities  to  improve  the  living  conditions  of  slum  dwellers.  The  same  rights  and  responsibilities  that  the  KMC  has \nconveyed to dwellers in registered bustees will accrue to slum dwellers in unrecognized bustees. This will be achieved \nthrough a pilot scheme to establish land titles, register dwellings, recognize tenancy rights, impose rent controls, and \nassess municipal tax liabilities. Security of tenure will enhance tenants\u2019 creditworthiness and improve their access to \nfinancing for physical improvements. A small-scale loan facility of $60,000 will be established to finance the physical \nimprovement of slum dwellings on a pilot basis. Proposed civil works include (i) widening and realigning neighborhood \naccess lanes (1,490 meters); (ii) providing electric lighting to illuminate lanes and open public spaces (40 poles and \nwiring);  (iii)  widening,  realigning,  and  lining  drains  (595  meters);  (iv)  constructing  sewer  and  drainage  lines  (380 \nmeters); (v) building water supply lines (785 meters); (vi) providing solid waste containers (6 units); and (vii) improving \npublic open spaces (3,182 square meters). An estimated 190,000 people will benefit from improved facilities under this \ncomponent. \n \nThe canal bank dwellers  who are relocated under the canal  rehabilitation  works  will have an improved quality  of life \nthrough the provisions of the Asian Development Bank-approved resettlement plan. The Government of West Bengal \nand the KMC have recognized this exercise as an opportunity to help the canal bank dwellers improve their standard \nof  living.  The  resettlement  plan  ensures  a  minimum  standard  of  housing  for  relocation  and  addresses  the  special \nneeds of vulnerable groups, such as children and female household heads, through specially designed rehabilitation \nprograms. \n  \n\n   No \n\n    Yes \n\nParticipation Process \n\nC. \nIs there a stakeholder analysis:                      \n \nThe stakeholder consultation process will promote stakeholders\u2019 involvement in the Project and contribute to effective \nimplementation  of  the  project  investments.  The  process  is  designed  to  ensure  stakeholder  awareness,  participation, \nand  education  with  respect  to  the  implementation  and  management  of  the  project  facilities.  It  will  also  educate \ncommunities  about  the  link  between  environmental  sanitation  and  health.  The  project  beneficiaries  will  be  consulted \nabout  project  operations,  as  well  as  the  implications  for  the  community  in  terms  of  benefits  and  responsibilities. \nInformation about stakeholders\u2019 needs and expectations under the Project will be conveyed to the project management \nteams.  Using  existing  community  networks  where  possible,  stakeholders  will  be  encouraged  to  become  involved  in \nproject  design,  implementation,  operation  and  maintenance,  and  monitoring.  As  a  cross-cutting  component,  the \nstakeholder consultation process will underpin the promotion of affordable access by the poor to basic urban services \nin  low-income  areas  and  facilitate  community  empowerment  through  the  development  and  adoption  of  demand-led, \nparticipatory approaches across all project components.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy:                             \n \nThe  stakeholder  consultation  process  will  underpin  the  Project\u2019s  sustainability  through  improved  representation. \nIn addition, the process will empower communities, enabling them to participate more actively and constructively on all \ncivic matters. NGOs will also be mobilized to facilitate consultation, community mobilization, participation in prioritizing \ncommunity  requirements,  planning  and  scheduling  of  civil  works,  management  of  the  small-scale  loan  facility,  and \nmaintenance. The NGOs will work with community-based organizations and other civil society organizations. \n \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n45\n\nGender Development \n\nD. \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nAlthough  the  Project  is  not  specifically  targeted  at  women,  all  components  will  help  improve  their  quality  of  life. \nWomen, as \u201ccaretakers\u201d of the home environment, are affected by poor living conditions, particularly poor sanitation \nstandards. In addition, their exposure to cooking smoke substantially increases the risk of acute respiratory infection. \nImproved environmental sanitation and the replacement of traditional indoor cooking fires will enhance their quality of \nlife. \n \nGender  issues  have  been  carefully  integrated  in  resettlement  planning  and  implementation.  Female-headed \nhouseholds  are  considered  to  be  vulnerable  households  and  are  accorded  additional  entitlements.4 In  addition,  legal \ntitles  will be in the name of  women, and thus the Project will help promote the empowerment of  women.5 Among the \nresettlement  plan\u2019s  actions  consistent  with  gender  development  are  (i)  ensuring  an  adequate  gender  balance  among \nthe staff of the project management units; (ii) addressing gender issues and monitoring them;6 (iii) ensuring that women \nbenefit from poverty alleviation schemes for the urban poor, the formation of women\u2019s self-help groups, and provision \nof vocational training;7  and (iv) empowering women through sensitization, participation, and training.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?                               \n \nE.

A resettlement plan has been prepared \nand updated to ensure the provision of assistance and \ncompensation to affected persons. \n\nAffordability analysis looked at monthly direct user \ncharges and expressed such charges as ratios of \nprojected median and lower-bound incomes, \nrespectively. In FY2002, the user charge would \nrepresent 1.1% and 1.6%, respectively; in FY2006, it \nwould represent 1.3% and 1.8%; and in FY2011, it \nwould represent 1.2% and 1.6%. All these ratios are \nsubstantially below the affordability limit of 2.5%. The \nproposed cost-recovery mechanisms are considered \nto be affordable. \n \nIndirect recovery of costs for the solid waste \nmanagement operations is proposed through the \nconsolidated rate charge (15%) as currently applied. \nThis will represent 1.3 % of the median household \nincome. As with sewerage and drainage, poor \nhouseholds will not contribute because they are \nexempted from the consolidated rate charge. \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n\n4   To  assist  the  highly  vulnerable,  the  Project  will  provide  them  with  first-floor  Valmiki  Ambedkar  Shahari  Aawas  Yojna \n(VAMBAY)  apartments  that  have  commercial  possibilities,  provide  access  to  land  for  social  forestry  and  production  of \nvegetables and other crops on rehabilitated canal banks, and facilitate access to Government livelihood and other social \nprograms.  VAMBAY  is  a  scheme  of  the  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  and  Poverty  Alleviation  of  the  Government  of \nIndia. This scheme, launched in December 2001, provides grant subsidy for construction and rehabilitation of the dwelling \nunits for the slum dwellers and the population living below the poverty line. \n\n5   The  apartments  come  with  legal  titles  for  occupants,  turning  informal  dwellers  on  government  lands  to  legal  owners  of \n\nwell-built apartments. \n\n6   This is included in the resettlement plan implementation schedule, in particular, addressing domestic violence issues. \n7   The  Project  has  introduced  skills  training  programs,  self-help  groups,  and  assisting  individuals  in  opening  savings \naccounts  and  accessing  financial  institutions  as  additional  measures  to  augment  the  existing  income  levels  of  affected \nfamilies. Women are the main beneficiaries of programs currently being run at the Nonadanga relocation site. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \n\nIssues \n\nLabor \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nSignificant/ Not \nSignificant/ None \n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None  \n\n Significant \n\n Not significant \n\n None  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nThe Project will not result in negative labor impacts.

The supplementary loan has been proposed to address (i) cost \noverruns,  (ii)  price  escalation,  (iii)  cost  increases  caused  by  physical  and  design  changes,  and  \n(iv) cost underestimates. A resettlement plan was prepared for the Project in 2000 and updated in \n2006  based  on  project  design  and  physical  changes,  specifically:  (i)  increase  in  the  length  of \ncanals  to  be  improved,  (ii)  cancellation  of  sewage  treatment  plant  components  and  drainage \npumping stations, and (iii) change in the location of the solid waste management facility. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nA. \n \n2. \nThe  project  design  has  carefully  incorporated  engineering  solutions  to  minimize  land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. The objective of changes in the project design was to cause \nthe least disruption to the project area population. In the case of canal improvements, which of all \nthe  project  components  affect  the  most  people,  design  changes  led  to  the  avoidance  of  densely \npopulated  canal  tracts.1 Reviews  of  siting  and  alignment  continue  with  the  objective  of  reducing \nland acquisition and resettlement impacts as the Project is implemented. \n \nComponents B (sewerage and drainage improvements), C (solid waste management), and \n3. \nE  (canal  improvements)  require  land.  For  Component  B,  the  2.58  hectares  required  for  sewage \npumping  stations  is  government  land,2 and  sewage  treatment  plant  works  will  take  place  within \nexisting  facilities.  Component  B  will  result  in  temporary  impacts  because  of  the  construction  of \ntrunk  sewer  lines.  For  component  C,  an  estimated  60  hectares  are  required  for  the  solid  waste \nmanagement  facility  and  this  land  will  be  Kolkata  Municipal  Corporation  (KMC)  property.  \nThe  eventual  closure  of  the  current  landfill  site  will  affect  garbage  sorters.  For  component  E,  \n77.31  kilometers  of  canals  will  be  improved.  While  land  acquisition  is  not  required  at  the  canal \nsites, the component will affect a significant numbers of canal dwellers and government land  will \nbe used for relocation sites. Table A10.1 summarizes component E\u2019s resettlement impacts. \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Entitlements \n\nThe policy framework and entitlements for the Project are based on (i) the Land Acquisition \n4. \nAct (1894, amended in 1984); (ii) the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation for Project \nAffected Families; and (iii) ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). The entitlement matrix \nfor the Project, based on the foregoing, is given in Table A10.2.3 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  For  example,  in  the  case  of  the  Keorapukur  canal,  works  were  reduced  from  9  km  to  1.15  km.  In  the  case  of  the \nChurial canal, the same objective of avoiding a densely populated settlement was achieved through a slight diversion \nthrough the Churial extension canal that involved an increase in the canal\u2019s length from 24 km to 27.55 km. \n\n2  Eight  drainage  pumping  stations  originally  proposed  have  been  dropped  from  the  Project  based  on  revised  project \n\n3  An assessment of the status and progress of project implementation shows that for components that will require land \nand result in resettlement impacts, progress has been slow. This pace ensures that all affected persons are provided \nwith compensation and assistance based on the updated resettlement plan. \n\ndesign. \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nTable A10.1: Summary of Resettlement Impacts Caused by Component E \n\nItem \nNumber of Affected Households \nNumber of Affected Persons  \nNumber of Affected Persons without Land Titles \nNumber of Female-Headed Households \nNumber of Very Poor Households (incomes less than Rs2,300 per  \n\nmonth) \n\nNumber of Elderly and/or Disabled Affected Persons \nNumber of Residential Structures Affected \nMain Type of Residential Structure \nNumber of Affected Shops \nNumber of Affected Common Property Resources \nAverage Annual Household Income (Rs) \nPrimary Source of Income \n\n                   Total \n          3,626 \n            16,317 \n            16,317 \n             462 \n          2,765  \n  \n             399 \n          3,177 \n                   Kutcha (96%)a \n             449 \n               18 \n   2,000\u20132,500 \n                Wages (82%),  \n self-employment (18%) \n\nAverage Household Size (number of people) \na Kutcha  are dwellings that typically have bamboo mat or mud walls with roof tiles and mud floors. \nSource: Kolkata Municipal Corporation. 2006.

Every month, a series of interactive sessions is held with all stakeholders, including affected \npersons,  ward  committee  members,  municipal  councilors,  and  representatives  of  civil  society \ngroups. Thirty-seven canal resettlement groups with a total of 460 affected person members have \nbeen  formed.  These  groups  meet  regularly  to  decide  on  and  discuss  issues  pertaining  to  their \ncommunities and will be the basis of housing cooperatives when affected persons are moved to \nthe Valmiki Ambedkar Shahari Aawas Yojna (VAMBAY) apartments.4 VAMBAY is a scheme of the \nMinistry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation of the Government of India. This scheme, \nlaunched  in  December  2001,  provides  grant  subsidy  for  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  the \ndwelling units for the slum dwellers and the population living below the poverty line.  The Project \nregularly  distributes  English  and  local-language  pamphlets  containing  information  about  the \nProject\u2019s progress to stakeholders. In addition, information booths have been set up at construction \nsites and in resettlement areas and are being set up in boroughs and canal settlements to increase \ninformation dissemination. Information about resettlement planning was disclosed to affected persons \nand other stakeholders. \n \nAt  the  settlement  level,  canal  resettlement  groups  address  the  grievances  of  affected \n6. \npersons. The groups are expected to resolve any issues brought to their attention within a week, \nafter  which  the  grievance  is  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  relevant  nongovernment  organization \n(NGO), which has 1 week to resolve grievances.5 Grievances not resolved by the NGO are brought \nto  the  attention  of  the  Social  Development  Unit,  which  in  consultation  with  the  councilor  and \nappropriate  government  authority,  will  address  the  grievance  within  one  week.  Grievances  not \nredressed  by  the  Social  Development  Unit  (SDU)  are  brought  to  the  Grievance  Redress \nCommittee,  which  consists  of  the  councilor,  two  SDU  staff,  two  project  staff,  and  two \nrepresentatives  from  the  canal  resettlement  groups.  Grievances  not  addressed  by  the  Grievance \nRedress Committee within 2 weeks can be taken to the appropriate court. \n\n                                                 \n4  Canal resettlement groups will also be responsible for the operation and maintenance of infrastructure facilities, such \n\nas drainage, internal pathways, solid waste collection, and water supply in the apartments. \n\n5  Suggestion  boxes  have  been  placed  at  settlement  sites  so  that  affected  persons  who  hesitate  to  approach  canal \nresettlement  groups,  NGOs,  or  SDU  can  convey  their  complaints.  The  NGOs  collect  these  complaints  and  forward \nthem to the SDU via the field staff every week. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nItem \nNumber  Type of Loss \n \n\n \n\nApplication \n\n \n\nDefinition of Entitled \nPerson \n\nCompensation Policy \n\nImplementation Issues \n\nTable A10.2: Entitlement Matrix \n\nCanal \nImprovement \nWorks \nLoss of \nstructure \n\n1 \n\nLoss of residential \nstructure \n\nEncroacher/squatter \nhousehold head \n\n(cid:131)  Provision of 190-square \nfoot VAMBAY apartment \nwith connections to basic \nurban services (water \nsupply, electricity, and \nsewage) allotted on a 99-\nyear nonresalable lease. \nTransport and labor \nsupport of Rs300.a  \n(cid:131)  Exemption from any \n\n(cid:131) \n\nregistration costs and \nother fees related to \nmoving into VAMBAY \napartments. \n\n(cid:131)  Additional compensation \nfor highly vulnerable \nhouseholds (item 4). \n\n(cid:131)  Provision of 100-square \nfoot shops, which will \nform part of the VAMBAY \ncomplex,d provided to \naffected persons with the \ncondition that any \nemployee will be \nretained. \nTransport and labor \nsupport of Rs300.  \n\n(cid:131) \n\n(cid:131)  Exemption from any \n\nregistration costs and \nother fees related to \nshops. \n\n(cid:131)  Additional compensation \nfor highly vulnerable \nhouseholds (item 4).  \n\n(cid:131)  Each affected family \nwill contribute 5%b of \nthe total cost of the \napartment, which is \nestimated at  \nRs4,000.c The \nGovernment of India \nwill contribute \nRs30,000 from its basic \nservices for the urban \npoor program.

The affected household will \ncontribute 5% of the cost of the unit, and in exchange, rather than informal dwellers on government \nland  they  become  legal  owners  of  units  with  access  to  basic  urban  infrastructure.  Units  will  be \nprovided  on  a  99-year  nonresaleable  lease  in  the  name  of  the  female  head  of  household.  In \naddition,  affected  households  are  entitled  to  a  relocation  grant  of  Rs300.  The  highly  vulnerable \ngroup  comprises  households  headed  by  women,  the  elderly,  the  disabled  and/or  handicapped, \nvery poor households with incomes of less than Rs2,300 per month, and child laborers. Legal titles \nwill be in the name of women, and thus the Project will help promote the empowerment of women. \nTo  assist  the  highly  vulnerable,  the  Project  will  provide  them  with  first-floor  VAMBAY  apartments \nthat have commercial possibilities, provide access to land for social forestry and the production of \nvegetables  and  other  crops  along  rehabilitated canal  banks,  and  facilitate  access  to  Government \nlivelihood  and  other  social  programs.  Child  laborers  (i)  will  be  provided  with  schooling  based  on \nnational education policy, (ii) will be given assistance based on a plan of action for rehabilitation, \nand (iii) will gradually discontinue work and be mainstreamed into the education system.  \n \nE. \n \n8. \nThe KMC has established the SDU within its Project Management Unit that coordinates its \nactivities  with  all  government  agencies  as  well  as  with  NGOs.  The  Irrigation  and  Waterways \nDepartment,  the  other  executing  agency  for  the  Project,  is  responsible  for  implementing  canal \nworks.  The SDU  is  responsible  for all  tasks  connected  with  the  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  of \nthe  affected  people  in  a  participatory  manner,  for  the  livelihood  restoration  program,  for  internal \nmonitoring,  and  for  reporting.  This  requires  the  SDU  to  be  in  regular  consultation  with  affected \npersons in the field. Even though a strong field presence is essential, no staff will be recruited for \nthis  purpose  in  either  the  KMC  or  the  Irrigation  and  Waterways  Department.  Instead,  the  Project \nwill use consultants and engage NGOs as implementing agencies. Two NGOs have been engaged \nspecifically for field-level implementation of resettlement activities. The total estimated resettlement \ncosts  are  $6.90  million,  including  for  transferring  land  from  other  government  departments,  for \ntransit  villages,  for  VAMBAY  units,  for  income  restoration,  and  for  administration.  Resettlement \nimplementation is expected to be completed within a 19-month time frame.  \n \nF. \n\nInstitutional Framework, Resettlement Costs, and Implementation Schedule \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n9. \nInternal  and  external  monitoring  will  make  use  of  both  quantitative  and  qualitative \napproaches  using  a  variety  of  tools  and  methods,  such  as  key  informant  interviews,  focus  group \ndiscussions,  community  public  meetings,  structured  direct  observations,  and  case  studies.  The \nSDU will prepare a monthly plan to check the progress of implementation of the resettlement plan \nand  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  regular  internal  monitoring.  Internal  monitoring  will  cover \ncompensation and assistance; resettlement entitlements; transit camps; land development; income \nrestoration;  special  interventions  for  vulnerable  groups;  empowerment  of  through  sensitization, \nparticipation, and training; information sharing and consultation; grievance redress; implementation \nstrategy and schedule sharing; coverage of affected persons under various government schemes \nfor poverty alleviation and income generation; and formation of women\u2019s self-help groups and the \nprovision  of  vocational  training  for  such  groups.  Internal  monitoring  reports  will  be  monthly.  An \nexternal  monitor  will  be  engaged  primarily  to  create  a  database  to  be  used  as  a  baseline  for \nmonitoring project output and impacts, assess project outcomes and impacts, and identify quality \nof  life  indicators  against  which  the  impacts  can  be  monitored.  The  external  monitor  will  submit \nquarterly  reports  in  the  first  3  years  and  two  reports  for  the  remainder  of  the  Project\u2019s  duration. \nExternal monitoring will verify the results of internal monitoring and evaluate whether the objectives \nof  the  plan  are  being  met.  The  external  monitor  will  submit  reports  to  both  ADB  and  the  Project \nManagement Units.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n54 \n\n \n\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A11.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n\n($ million)\n\nForeign \nExchange\n\nLocal \nCurrency\n\nTotal\n\n% of Total \nBase Cost\n\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\nItem\nA.

The  economic  analysis \nreappraises  the  economic  viability  of  the  Project  incorporating  design  changes,  revised  cost \nestimates,  and  updated  information  available  from  the  socioeconomic  survey  in  accordance  with \nthe Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.2 \n \n2. \nThe Project focuses on providing services to the outer areas of Kolkata, which have been \nexperiencing  rapid  population  growth  of  around  2.5%  annually,  much  higher  than  the  annual \ngrowth  rate  of  1%  observed  in  the  city\u2019s  core  areas,  and  which  are  therefore  facing  increasing \ndemand for urban services. Service coverage in the outer areas is low with 32% coverage by water \nsupply,  17%  by  sewerage  systems,  less  than  50%  by  drainage  systems,  and  less  than  70%  by \nsolid waste management. Without the Project, the service coverage would deteriorate further, as it \nwould  be  unable  to  keep  up  with  the  population  growth.  Furthermore,  by  focusing  on  the  outer \nareas, the Project targets the poor, as the incidence of poverty is much higher in the outer areas of \nKolkata.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  main  goals  of  the  Project  are  to  improve  the  social,  economic,  and  environmental \nquality of life in Kolkata; to reduce poverty in low-income  areas by ensuring affordable access to \nbasic  urban  services;  to  reduce  flooding  in  low-income  areas;  and  to  improve  sewerage  and \ndrainage  (S&D)  management  systems,  thereby  decreasing  the  incidence  of  waste-related  and \nwaterborne  diseases.  The  economic  rationale  for  the  intervention  is  sound,  because  (i)  the \ninvestment is large enough to achieve significant economies of scale; (ii) the services provided are \nof a public good nature, including protection of the environment and of public health; (iii) the Project \nfocuses  on  low-income  communities  with  a  view  to  distributing  income; 3  and  (iv)  wastewater \nmanagement needs to be centrally controlled and monitored, as the wastewater discharges affect \nthe larger ecological system of the East Kolkata Wetlands, requiring management of externalities. \n \n4. \nWhile the KMC, under the KMC Act, is responsible for all urban services assisted under the \nProject,  some  service  delivery  may  be  suitable  for  private  sector  participation  under  overall \nsupervision by the KMC. In particular, the transfer and disposal of municipal solid waste, including \na  compost  plant,  are  being  considered  for  a  public-private  partnership,  and  the  Project  has \nengaged  consultants  to  conduct  the  necessary  assessments  and  prepare  a  package  and/or \ncontract  under  an  appropriate  modality.  The  KMC  is  also  considering  extending  a  public-private \npartnership modality to primary collection of municipal solid waste in the long run.     \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The capital work includes sewerage and drainage and a sewerage treatment plant for sewage effluent from Borough \n\nRationale for Government Intervention \n\n2   ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n3  One-third of the population in the outer areas of Kolkata belong to low-income communities. \n\nVII. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n57\n\nCost Overruns and Change in Project Beneficiaries \n\nAlternatives Considered for the Supplementary Loan \n\nC. \n \n5. \nThe  supplementary  loan  of  $79.33  million  is  required  because  of  two  main  reasons:  \n(i)  there  was  a  loan  cancellation  of  $72.2  million  by  the  Government  in  expectation  of  the  rupee \ndepreciating against the dollar and lower cost inflation; and (ii) there was cost escalation because \nof  minor  design  changes,  higher  than  expected  price  increases  in  materials  and  rupee \nappreciation, underestimation of costs at the appraisal stage, and delayed implementation. While \nthe Project has suffered from the cost escalation, the number of project beneficiaries was revised \nupward during the detailed design period, partially offsetting the negative impact on net benefits of \nthe cost escalation. The beneficiary population is now based on 2001 census figures, which were \nnot  available  at  the  appraisal  stage,  and  design  modifications  allowed  for  more  household \nconnections  for  the  S&D  component.  In  particular,  Borough  VII,  which  was  added  to  the  original \nscope of the S&D component, is the most congested borough among the outer areas and has an \nestimated 338,697 beneficiaries. All the economic costs and benefits are adjusted to constant 2006 \nprices.  \n \nD. \n \n6. \nFor the S&D component, the area coverage, the number of beneficiaries, and the amount of \ndry  weather  flow  (DWF)  and  storm  water  flow  discharges  are  reestimated  for  each  borough.  \nThe  sewer  network  and  the  location  of  pumping  stations  are  reconfigured  to  optimize  system \nefficiency. Gravity outfall was proposed rather than pumping to the extent possible to minimize the \ninvestment  and  operation  costs.  The  Government  also  proposed  to  drop  two  sewage  treatment \nplants  (STPs)  and  discharge  sewage  effluent  into  the  DWF  channels  to  further  reduce  costs. \nHowever, as the environmental impacts of discharging sewage effluent into the DWF channels and \ntreating it in the East Kolkata Wetlands could be significant, the two STPs are still included under \nthe  Project.  Reducing  the  coverage  of  S&D  and  canal  components  was  also  considered  to \ndownsize the Project and retain it within currently available funds, but as the Project was prepared \nas  an  integrated  environmental  improvement  of  the  outer  areas,  dropping  some  boroughs  or \ncanals would undermine the environmental impact of the Project. It was therefore decided to retain \nthe original scope of the Project for the S&D and canal components. \n \n7. \nAt  the  micro  design  level,  alternative  designs  were  considered  and  the  best  design  was \nselected  based  on  three  factors:  (i)  the  cost-effectiveness  of  the  design,  (ii)  the  operation  and \nmaintenance capacity of the executing agencies, and (iii) the health hazard risk. Cost-effectiveness \nis assured by covering only the already densely populated areas or high population growth areas, \nas  well  as  by  using  locally  available  materials  and  equipment  for  construction  and  maintenance; \nthe  technology  selected  is  manageable  given  the  executing  agencies\u2019  current  capacity;  and  no \nsignificant health hazard risks are anticipated.  \n \nF. \n \nThe  components  financed  under  the  supplementary  loan  mainly  include  (i)  S&D \n8. \nimprovements  in  boroughs  VII  &  XV,  and  (ii)  canal  improvements  along  the  Churial  and  Suti \ncanals. Economic analysis is undertaken for the S&D component assuming the entire scope of the \nProject financed by both the existing and the supplementary loans including seven boroughs, and \nthe  scope  of  the  Project  financed  by  only  the  supplementary  loan  including  two  boroughs,  while \neconomic analysis for canal improvements is conducted for the entire project scope only financed \nby both the existing and the supplementary loans.  \n \n9. \nAssumptions. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is calculated by estimating the \nincremental  economic  benefits  and  costs  over  a  25-year  period  upon  commission  of  the  Project.  \nAll  the  costs  are  expressed  in  constant  2006  prices  and  are  adjusted  to  economic  prices  with  a \nshadow exchange rate factor of 1.1 and a shadow wage rate of 0.7 for unskilled labor. Incremental \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs (0.7% of investment costs) are added to capital costs to \n\nEconomic Viability of the Project \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nobtain  the  total  economic  cost  of  the  Project.  For  the  S&D  component,  the  capital  replacement \ncosts are added at 80% of equipment investment costs in fiscal year (FY) 2024.   \n \n10. \nThe S&D component will benefit 1.34 million people in the entire scope and 0.44 million in \nthe limited scope financed only by the supplementary loan by FY2010, the first year of operation. \nThe  canal  component  will  benefit  1.25  million  people  in  the  entire  scope  by  FY2010.  These  are \nincreases from the appraisal figure of 1.07 million for the S&D component in the entire scope and \n0.72  million  for  the  canal  component  in  the  entire  scope,  respectively.  One  of  the  quantified \neconomic  benefits  for  both  components  is  health  benefits,  which  are  estimated  by  multiplying \ndisability-adjusted  life  years  saved  because  of  the  Project  by  the  median  per  capita  income. \nDisability-adjusted life years are derived from the number of life years lost because of a disability \nusing a scale from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (death). In 1992, an estimated 171 disability-adjusted life \nyears  per  1,000  population  were  lost  in  West  Bengal. 4 For  this  economic  analysis,  disability-\nadjusted life year losses attributable to poor S&D and poor canal management are assumed to be \n15%  and  2%,  respectively.  The  median  household  income  in  2006  prices  is  Rs103,496  ($2,352) \nper year. This means that the average loss per capita resulting from illness is Rs2,923 ($66.4) per \nyear. Hence the per capita loss caused by poor S&D and poor canal management is Rs452 ($10) \nand  Rs52  ($1.2)  per  year,  respectively.  The  economic  value  of  health  benefits  is  assumed  to \nincrease  in  line  with  real  increases  in  state  domestic  product  per  capita.  The  per  capita  state \ndomestic product of West Bengal increased at an average annual rate of 5.51% during FY1993\u2013\nFY2002.5 This analysis assumed that the per capita value of health benefits increases at an annual \nrate of 6%.  \n \n11. \nOther quantified benefits for the S&D component include (i) savings in household (private) \nhealth  expenditures  that  represent  about  1.9%  of  total  household  expenditure  in  the  KMC  area;  \n(ii)  savings  in  public  health  expenditures  equivalent  to  15%  of  the  amount  spent  annually  on \nhospital  and  health  services  by  the  KMC;  (iii)    savings  in  the  costs  of  repairing  damage  to  roads \nand  vehicles  caused  by  flooding,  assuming  that  20%  of  the  KMC\u2019s  expenditure  on  road \nmaintenance  is  related  to  flooding  and  an  50%  of  vehicle  maintenance  expenditures  are  due  to \nflooding;  (iv)  avoided  expenditures  on  construction  and  maintenance  of  septic  tanks  considering \nthe  average  annual  price  per  household  for  cleaning  and  renting  a  septic  tank;  (v)  benefits  from \ncleaner water downstream of the STPs for communities that use canal water for washing, bathing, \ndomestic water supply, irrigation, etc; and (vi) business benefits derived from fewer disruptions of \neconomic  activities  from  flooding,  especially  for  small  firms  and  the  informal  sector.  Other \nquantified benefits for canal components include (i) savings in expenditures on repairs of dwellings \nand  other  properties  damaged  by  waterlogging,  assuming  that  6.25%  (5.00%  for  dwellings  and \n1.25%  for  other  properties)  of  total  household  expenditures  on  repairs  is  related  to  flooding;  \n(ii) recreational benefits estimated at 1% of income; (iii) reduced productive days lost because of \nflooding,  assuming  that  the  average  number  of  days  lost  is  5  (2.5  days  for  working  days  lost \nbecause  of  flooding  and  2.5  days  because  of  disruption  and  clean-up  operations  after  flooding) \ndays per household per year; and (iv) savings in private and public health expenditures.  \n \n12. \nBoth  components  also  yield  unquantifiable  benefits,  including  (i)  reduced  private  and \npublic  costs  of  mosquito  control,  (ii)  appreciation  of  land  values  because  of  the  improved \nenvironment and reduced risks of flooding, (iii) psychological benefits from reductions in morbidity \nand  mortality,  (iv)  reduced  traffic  disruptions  caused  by  flooding,  (v)  benefits  to  visitors  and \nnonresidents  working  in  the  areas,  and  (vi)  positive  impacts  on  tourism  and  tourist-related \nbusinesses. Hence the estimated EIRRs should be considered conservative.  \n \n13. \nEIRR. The economic viability of the Project is summarized in Table A13. The EIRR for the \nS&D component is estimated at 12.7% for a full scope and at 11.8% for a supplementary scope, \nwhich  are  around  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  12.0%.  At  the  same  time,  the  EIRR  for  the \n\n                                                 \n4   Health and Family Welfare Department, GoWB. 1999. Health Indicators \u2013 West Bengal.

Combining both S&D and canal \nimprovement  components,  the  EIRR  is  estimated  at  13.3%.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  also \nconducted  with  respect  to  cost  and  benefit  assumptions  and  is  also  presented  in  Table  A13. \nSwitching  values  for  two  parameters  critical  for  the  EIRR  computation  (i.e.,  the  percentage  of \ncapital costs assumed to go toward O&M costs and the number of beneficiaries) are shown in the \nbottom  panel  of  Table  A13.  In  the  base  case  scenario,  O&M  costs  are  assumed  to  be  0.7%  of \ncapital costs, while the 10% EIRR switching value for the percentage of capital cost going toward \nO&M costs is as high as 5.9% for the total investments. This means that even if the annual O&M \ncosts  increase  up  to  8.4  times  as  much  as  that  assumed  in  the  base  case  scenario,  the  Project \nremains  economically  viable  with  an  EIRR  of  10%.  Similarly,  the  number  of  beneficiaries  can  be \ndecreased  by  a  maximum  of  29.5%  from  the  base  case  assumption  for  the  Project  to  be \neconomically  viable  with  an  EIRR  of  10%.  In  sum,  the  components  financed  under  the \nsupplementary  loan  are  considered  to  still  be  economically  viable,  given  the  large  unquantifiable \neconomic benefits and positive externalities that would enhance the Project\u2019s economic benefits.     \n \nTable A13: Summary Result of Economic Viability of the Project \n\nAnalysis Scenario\n\nSewerage and Drainage Component\n\nCanal Improvement Works\n\nFull Scope\n\nNPV (Rs.
