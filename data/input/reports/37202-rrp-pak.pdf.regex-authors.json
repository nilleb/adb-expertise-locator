Third Quarter TA Loan Review Mission Report ", " \nLOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY \n \nBorrower  Islamic Republic of Pakistan \n \nProposal   The proposed subprogram 2 of the Punjab Resource Management \nProgram (PRMP) consists of (i) a program loan of $200 million from \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) ordinary capital resources (OCR) \nfor  public  resource  management  reforms;  and  (ii)  a  technical \nassistance  (TA)  grant  of  $150,000  to  support  the  preparation  of \nsubprogram 3 of the PRMP. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \n  Sector:  Law, economic management, and public policy \n  Subsector: Subnational or local government administration \n  Themes: Governance, capacity development  \n  Subthemes: Public governance, organizational development \n   \nEnvironment  Category  C.  A  review  of  the  environmental  implications  was \nAssessment  undertaken and no adverse environmental impacts were identified.  \n   \nRationale  Support  from  subprogram  1  of  the  PRMP  improved  the  short-  to \nmedium-term fiscal management of the Government of the Punjab \n(GOP) and also led to relatively robust local government development \nbudgets. These achievements enabled higher social sector spending \nand  helped  sustain  the  delegation  of  service  delivery  to  local \ngovernments under the devolution program. However, the incidence of \npoverty  in  Punjab  remains  high,  the  level  of  development  remains \nbelow its potential, and social indicators are poor. Sustainable growth \nto  address  these  concerns  requires  continuity  of  the  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms initiated under subprogram 1.  \n \nImprovement in public sector governance and resource management \nyields considerable development gains. In the context of the current \ndevolution, sustained assistance to provincial and local governments is \nrequired so they can adjust to their new roles. The focus needs to be \non  policy  setting,  financing,  monitoring,  and  oversight  and  on  the \nrealignment  of  systems,  procedures,  and  governance  structures. \nSubprogram 2 supports such reforms and is in line with the medium-\nterm  budget  framework  developed  by  GOP.  The  emphasis  is  on \nimproved  revenue-generating  capacity,  civil  service  reforms,  and \nprivate sector development. These will enable GOP to improve service \ndelivery,  reduce  public  sector  employment  pressures,  and  support \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.   \n \nEstimated PRMP  Subprogram 2 is expected to be completed by 30 June 2007. The \nCompletion Date   overall PRMP is to be implemented by 30 June 2008. \n \nProgram Loan  The goal of subprogram 2 is to improve fiscal and financial governance \nObjective and Scope  and public service delivery, leading to poverty reduction in Punjab. The \npurpose and policy objectives of subprogram 2 are to assist Punjab \nthrough reforms in governance structures, systems, and procedures to \n(i)  provide  \u201cfiscal  space\u201d  for  sustainable  development  and  improve \nmonitoring mechanisms to ensure allocation and utilization of funds is ", "ii   \neffective  and  transparent;  (ii)  adjust  and  strengthen  institutional \narrangements to increase the pro-poor impact of public expenditure \nand  to  improve  service  delivery;  and  (iii)  create  a  conducive \nenvironment  for  private  sector  development,  growth,  and  income \ngeneration.  \n \nSubprogram 2 will enable GOP to realize the policy agenda outlined in \nthe  Punjab  Economic  Report.  That  agenda  includes  improving \ngovernance, strengthening fiscal and financial structures, developing \nthe  private  sector,  ensuring  effective  public  service  delivery,  and \nreducing the economy\u2019s vulnerability to shocks. Subprogram 2 builds \non  other  ADB-financed  governance-related  programs,  such  as  the \nDecentralization Support Program and the Devolved Social Services \nProgram,  that  are  promoting  fiscal  devolution,  decentralized  social \nservice delivery, local accountability, and gender reform.  \n \nComponents and  Subprogram 2 will support reform measures under three components: \nOutputs   (i)  reforming  provincial  finances  through  fiscal  restructuring  and \nfinancial management; (ii) reforming processes and institutions for pro-\npoor service delivery; and (iii) creating opportunities for growth and \nincome generation through private sector. The following outputs are \nenvisaged  (i)  strengthened  provincial  revenues;  (ii)  rationalized \nprovincial expenditures; (iii) improved effectiveness, predictability, and \naccountability  in  financial  management;  (iv)  better  strategic \nprogramming of investments for poverty reduction; (v) restructured and \nstrengthened  government,  administration,  and  human  resource \ndevelopment;  (vi)  regulatory  and  administrative  reforms  for  private \nsector development; and (viii) reduced direct public sector involvement \nin economic and/or commercial operations. \n \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \n  provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  for  the \nundisbursed balance of 0.75% per annum in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nstandard  procedures,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nprogram agreements.  \n \nThe Government of Pakistan (the Government) will onlend the local \ncurrency generated from the proceeds of the loan to GOP, at terms \nand conditions similar to those given by ADB to the Government. The \nGovernment will assume the foreign exchange risk and GOP will bear \nthe interest rate risk. \n \nProgram Period and  Subprogram 2 will be completed by 30 June 2007. The loan will be \nTranching  released in two equal tranches of $100 million each. The first tranche \nwill be released upon satisfactory attainment of agreed achievements, \non the date of loan effectiveness or shortly thereafter. The second \ntranche  will  be  available,  upon  satisfactory  attainment  of  agreed \nachievements, within 18 months from loan effectiveness. The closing \ndate for withdrawals is 31 December 2007. ", "  iii\nExecuting Agency  The  Planning  and  Development  Department  (P&DD)  of  GOP  will \n  continue to be the executing agency for PRMP.  \n   \nImplementation  P&DD  has  established  a  well  equipped  and  staffed  program \nArrangements  management unit (PMU) to coordinate, facilitate, monitor, and evaluate \noverall implementation. P&DD will be responsible for administering the \nutilization  of  loan  proceeds.  It  will  deliver  a  draft  policy  matrix  for \nsubprogram 3 as a second tranche condition for subprogram 2. The \nPMU will function as the secretariat of the PRMP steering committee to \nbe chaired by the chief secretary of GOP. The steering committee will \nprovide  guidance  and  oversight  and  will  be  responsible  for \ninterdepartmental  and  policy  coordination.  It  will  liaise  with  the \nGovernment  to  ensure  that  the  PRMP  is  in  line  with  structural \nadjustment and governance initiatives at the federal level.  \n  \nProcurement  The loan will finance foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties \nand taxes) of imports procured in and from ADB\u2019s member countries. \nThe Government will certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds \nthe amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the program loan \nin a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use of loan \nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.  \n \nCounterpart Funds   The local currency counterpart funds, to be generated from the loan, \nwill be used to retire expensive provincial debt. The savings to be \ngenerated  from  the  retirement  of  expensive  debt  will  be  used  to \nfinance the cost of structural adjustment, establish funds and facilities, \nand  finance  high-priority  social  and  human  development  programs \ntargeted at the poor. GOP will certify the utilization of counterpart funds \nin line with the loan agreement through audited statements acceptable \nto ADB. In addition, GOP is committed to use its own resources to \ncapitalize pension and General Provident Funds.  \n \nTechnical  The purpose of the TA grant is to enable GOP to prepare subprogram \nAssistance   3. The TA will assist GOP in: (i) fiscal and financial management, \nto Support   (ii) civil service reforms, (iii) private sector development, and (iv) reform \nSubprogram 3 of  management and policy dialogue. The TA will enhance the capacities \nPRMP  of the P&DD and key implementing agencies through lessons learned \n  from the implementation of subprogram 2.  \n   \nThe total cost of the TA, including contingencies, is estimated to be \n \n$187,500 equivalent. ADB will finance $150,000 equivalent on a grant \n \nbasis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  to  cover  the  entire  foreign \n \nexchange cost and part of the local currency cost, mainly for domestic \n \nconsultants. GOP\u2019s contribution will be 20% of the total TA cost. The \n \nTA will require 3 person-months of international and 20 person-months \n \nof domestic consulting services. \n ", "iv   \n \nCofinancing Grant to  The  United  Kingdom,  through  its  Department  for  International \nSupport Public  Development, is intending to cofinance, on a parallel and tied basis, a \nResource  TA  grant  of  \u20a43  million  to  strengthen  Punjab\u2019s  public  resource \nManagement in  management.   \nPunjab    \n \nProgram Benefits  Subprogram  2  is  expected  to  yield  significant  benefits  through \nand Beneficiaries  comprehensive improvement in public service delivery. Sustainable pro-\npoor public service delivery under subprogram 2 will be derived from \n(i) measures  that  improve  fiscal  discipline  and  enable  increased \nspending in high-priority areas for poverty reduction, as outlined in the \nPunjab  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy;  (ii)  stronger  governance \nmechanisms,  institutional  arrangements,  and  accountability  for \nexpenditure management and service delivery; and (iii) an environment \nthat  offers  more  opportunities  for  growth,  employment,  and  income \ngeneration.   \n \nIdentifiable benefits will accrue over the medium term in line with the \noutcomes detailed in the program framework and policy matrix. Specific \nand immediate impacts of subprogram 2 will include fiscal restructuring \nand utilization of loan proceeds to retire expensive provincial debt and to \ncapitalize the pension and General Provident Funds. Subprogram 2 will \nalso help the provincial civil service to be more responsive to clients. \n \nRisks and  The realization of benefits will depend on a number of assumptions \nSafeguards  that are subject to a variety of risks. Mitigating measures have been \nintegrated in the design of subprogram 2 as appropriate, taking into \naccount lessons learned from subprogram 1. \n \nPolitical risks in Punjab remain comparatively low. The elections in \nOctober 2002 gave a clear majority to the party closely associated with \nthe  administration  that  initiated  Pakistan\u2019s  reform  agenda.  The \nGovernment and GOP remain strongly committed to the PRMP.  \n \nSubprogram  2  aims  to  reduce  abuses  of  power  and  rent-seeking \nopportunities.  Reforms  could  be  undermined  or  delayed  by  vested \ninterests  that  stand  to  lose  from  greater  transparency  and \naccountability. Strong ownership and support for subprogram 2 at the \nhighest political level and in the civil services mitigates such risks.  \n \nInsufficient capacity within GOP to implement the envisaged reforms \nhas been addressed through arrangements for expeditious deployment \nof  specialist  assistance  and  capacity  building  support  under  an \nongoing  ADB-financed  TA  loan  for  strengthening  public  resource \nmanagement.  \n \nWhile Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic indicators have been strong over the \npast three years, poverty levels remain high and must be reduced. \nRising cost of oil, insecurity in the region, and the cost of earthquake \nreconstruction accentuate the macroeconomic risks. While some of the \nrisks are beyond the control of the Government and GOP, prudent and \nconsistent  economic  management  strategy  can  mitigate \nmacroeconomic vulnerability.   ", "v \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 2 of the Punjab Resource Management \nProgram (PRMP). The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for supporting \nthe preparation of subprogram 3 of the PRMP, and, if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The program \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \n2.  Significant Economic Recovery. Structural reforms were undertaken under a standby \nagreement in 2000. These were followed by a 3-year poverty reduction and growth facility of the \nInternational Monetary Fund in 2001. Since then, the economy has steadily improved. From a \nlow of 1.8% growth in gross domestic product (GDP), at constant factor cost, in fiscal year (FY) \n2001, the economy grew by 8.4% in FY2005. This remarkable progress has been achieved as a \nresult of the consistency and continuity of the economic policy framework and the reform \nprocess. Improvements in the external balance of payments, credit rating, and re-entry into \ninternational  capital  markets  accompanied  this  accelerated  growth.  Monetary  expansion, \ncoupled with a buoyant stock market and greater private sector participation, reinforced the \ngrowth momentum. Significant gains by the manufacturing sector, especially by large-scale \nmanufacturing, was accompanied by fairly good performance by the agriculture and services \nsectors. The overall growth enabled Pakistan to successfully complete and graduate out of the \npoverty reduction and growth facility in 2004. 2   \n \n3.  The Government of Pakistan (the Government) expects the economy to grow by more \nthan 7% during FY2006. To sustain the growth momentum, the Government is taking steps to \nincrease investment. Total investment grew at 16.9% in FY2005. Foreign direct investment has \nalso increased significantly. The Government\u2019s privatization program alone has generated net \nforeign  investment  of  over  PRs70  billion  in  FY2004  and  FY2005.3  With  good  rainfall,  the \nGovernment anticipates an increase of 50% in cotton production as well as a good wheat crop. \n \n4.  Availability of Fiscal Space at the National Level. One of the biggest changes during \nthe  last  few  years  has  been  the  creation  of  \u201cfiscal  space\u201d.  Debt  restructuring,  following \nrenegotiation through the Paris Club;4 aid and soft-loan inflows; greater foreign remittance \ninflows through banking channels; and open market buying of US dollars by the State Bank of \nPakistan have built up a foreign exchange reserve of some $12 billion. The fiscal deficit for \nFY2006  is  expected  to  remain  below  4%  of  GDP.  The  Central  Board  of  Revenue  is \nstrengthening tax collection.5 In FY2005, collection targets were met and a record amount of \nPRs590 billion was collected. The target for FY2006 at PRs660 billion is likely to be met. On the \nexpenditure side, the escalation of debt service payments has slowed because of better terms \nfor foreign debt and a general reduction in interest rates. Nonetheless, with the rise in inflation, \ninterest rates are rising.  \n                                                 \n1  For a more detailed analysis, see Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2005. Pakistan Economic Update. Islamabad; \nand State Bank of Pakistan. 2004. Annual Report. Islamabad.  \n2  In June 2004, the International Monetary Fund completed the eighth review of Pakistan\u2019s performance under the 3-\nyear poverty reduction and growth facility, and released $253 million. \n3  Based on the presentation of Dr. Hafeez Sheikh, Minister for Privatization to the Pakistan Development Forum on \n25 April 2005.  \n4   An informal group of official creditors that renegotiates external debts.  \n5  Changes in tax rates, tax administration, and collection were announced in the fiscal year (FY) 2006 budget.  ", "2     \n5.  Poverty Reduction Remains Top Priority. Despite a number of initiatives aimed at \ndeveloping Pakistan\u2019s economic and social sectors, the country\u2019s level of development remains \nbelow its potential and social indicators are poor.6 There has also been criticism that recent \ngrowth has neither made a significant impact on poverty reduction nor generated sufficient \nemployment opportunities. A substantial part of employment is informal. High population growth \nhas led to increasing numbers of unskilled and semi-skilled workers who cannot be absorbed \ninto the labor market, giving rise to social tensions and fueling extremist groups.7 To counter \nthese  trends,  the  Government\u2019s  economic  policies  seek  to  uplift  livelihoods  and  create \nopportunities for the poor through support for employment-generating activities, more effective \nsocial sector spending, and more participation in local decision making.  \n \n6.  The Government has declared poverty reduction to be its overriding policy objective and \nhas prepared a poverty reduction strategy (PRS) paper.8 A poverty partnership agreement with \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) signed in September 20029 sets out a shared vision and key \npriorities  for  reducing  poverty  in  Pakistan.  Availability  of  fiscal  space  has  enabled  the \nGovernment to increase its social sector and poverty-related expenditure substantially in the last \nfew years, from PRs167 billion in FY2002, to PRs278 billion in FY2005, and an anticipated \nPRs325 billion in FY2006, a 95% increase in the last 4 years. There are still questions about the \nabsorptive  capacity  of  organizations  in  the  social  sector10  and  the  effectiveness  of  such \nexpenditures,  but  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  poverty  reduction  is  well  established,  and \nindicative  surveys  have  started  to  report  some  improvements,  including  a  decrease  in \nunemployment.11  \n \n7.  Far-Reaching Governance Reforms. Governance reforms are the cornerstone of the \nGovernment\u2019s  agenda  for  reducing  poverty.  The  previous  administration  embarked  on  an \nambitious program of restructuring and reforming government institutions at all levels\u2014federal, \nprovincial,  and  local\u2014and  a  bold  step  was  taken  with  the  devolution  plan  announced  by \nPresident Musharraf in 2000 and the promulgation of new local government ordinances (LGOs) \nby all provinces in 2001. These reforms will have a fundamental impact on identifying and \nimplementing development programs and allocating financial resources.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \n8.  Public Resource Management and Governance. Although the first generation reforms \nat the federal level have done much to stabilize Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic environment in  \nrecent years, second-generation structural reforms at provincial and local government levels are \nrequired to deliver the social and other public services needed to bring about a direct and \nsustained improvement in the quality of life. Accordingly, ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \n                                                 \n6  Pakistan ranks 142 out of 177 countries in the Human Development Index. Its low ranking compared to other \ncountries with similar level of income indicates the low priority that social sectors have historically received. See \nMahbub ul Haq Human Development Centre. 2004. Human Development in South Asia 2004. Karachi. \n7  For further details on Pakistan\u2019s labor market and challenges, see International Labour Organization. 2000. \nPakistan Country Employment Policy Review. Islamabad.  \n8  An  interim  poverty  reduction  strategy  (PRS)  paper  was  prepared  in  November  2001,  following  extensive \nconsultation with stakeholders. It outlines key processes to be set in motion to ensure full participation in \nformulation of the PRS paper, including at the provincial level and by the newly elected district officials and civil \nsociety. Details on the interim PRS paper and an assessment of progress in finalizing the PRS paper can be found \nat http://www.imf.org. Currently, the Ministry of Finance is planning a revision of the PRS paper. \n9  ADB. 2002. Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and ADB. Manila.  \n10 Sharp increases in proposed spending when these organizations do not have the ability to ensure efficient \nallocation and usage, could imply either wasteful expenditure or unspent resources at the end of the year. \n11 Preliminary poverty surveys conducted by the Government show some improvements, including a decrease in \nunemployment.  ", "    3 \nupdate  (2006\u20132008)  for  Pakistan12  reiterates  the  need  for  continued  support  for  good \ngovernance,  sustainable  pro-poor  growth,  and  social  development.13  Emphasis  on  good \ngovernance is reflected in ADB funding for several key governance programs approved in the \nlast 4 years (Supplementary Appendix 1). Emphasis on good governance is integral to public \nresource management reforms that emphasize (i) sustainable public finance, (ii) effective civil \nservice, (iii) efficient and sufficient public service delivery, and (iv) private sector development.  \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n9.  Significance of Punjab. Punjab has nearly half the national population of 140 million \nand estimated 57% of the national GDP. Throughout 1990s, Punjab\u2019s real GDP grew at 4.5% \nper annum, while the GDP growth for the country was 4.1%. Punjab has also led the country in \nthe recent economic recovery. However, the per capita income increase by about 2.1% per \nannum during the 1990s has not been evenly spread. As a result, despite Punjab\u2019s good \nperformance,  it  is  also  home  to  most  of  Pakistan\u2019s  poor.  A  more  detailed  account  of  the \nsocioeconomic sectors of Punjab is in Appendix 2. \n \n10.  Opportunities for Sustainable Reforms. The stable macroeconomic environment, and \nthe fiscal space at the national level in Pakistan, provides an opportunity for Punjab to achieve \nsustainable  growth  through  suitable  policies  and  institutional  reforms.  The  strategy  of  the \nGovernment of the Punjab (GOP), as formulated in the Punjab Economic Report14 is to: (i) \nimprove governance, (ii) strengthen fiscal and financial structures, (iii) create a more supportive \nenvironment for private-sector-led growth, (iv) reform the delivery of public services, and (v) \naddress  the  vulnerability  of  the  province\u2019s  economy  to  external  negative  factors.  PRMP \nsubprogram 1 supported GOP to take action on some of these elements. Subprogram 2 will \nhelp implement GOP\u2019s strategy outlined in Punjab Economic Report by formulating appropriate \nreform policies.15  \n \n11.  Key Functions of Provincial Government. Pakistan\u2019s constitution places great weight \non the delivery of public services by provinces, including social and physical infrastructure and \nassociated services. Such services include agriculture, natural resources and environmental \nmanagement,  social  services,  physical  infrastructure,  economic  services  for  private  sector \ndevelopment, and asset protection and public order. Good coordination between federal and \nprovincial governments is required since some of these services may also be provided by the \nfederal government. The constitution encourages the federal and provincial governments to take \nsteps  to  improve  the  social  and  economic  status  of  women.  Major  service  functions  are \ndelegated to local governments at district, tehsil16, and union levels.  \n \n12.  Impact of Decentralization With the adoption of LGOs in 2001, primary responsibility \nfor  most  service  delivery  was  delegated  to  local  governments.  As  a  result,  provincial \nresponsibilities have been redefined at all stages of public service delivery, including planning, \nfinancing, execution, and monitoring. Provincial governments have a key role in (i) ensuring that \nstable, predictable, and sufficient fiscal resources are made available; (ii) devising instruments \nfor intergovernmental financing to encourage local government implementation of province-wide \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2005.

This  requires  an  adjustment  to  key  provincial  institutions  and  governance \narrangements.   \n \n13.  Fiscal  Policies  and  Constraints.  GOP  manages  substantial  funds.  Its  total \nexpenditures in FY2005 are estimated at PRs156 billion. Pakistan\u2019s constitution limits provinces\u2019 \ntax-raising powers, and GOP receives nearly 70% of its fiscal resources from federal transfers. \nSpending policies in Punjab have been more conservative than those of other provinces, and \nthe average fiscal deficit is estimated to be only 1\u20132% of provincial GDP. However, because of \na rigid and skewed expenditure structure, as well as inappropriate planning, budgeting, and \nmonitoring  mechanisms,  funds  have  increasingly  been  channeled  for  non-developmental \nexpenditure, resulting in a progressive deterioration of public services and institutions.  \n \n14.  Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers. Most taxes and other forms  of revenues are \ncollected by the federal government. The provinces receive a share of the revenues from these \ntaxes through transfers. The list of taxes that contribute to the pool that is shared with the \nprovinces, the provincial and federal shares of the pool, and the formula that determines the \nhorizontal distribution of resources among the provinces are decided at least once every 5 years \nby the National Finance Commission (NFC). A new NFC award is expected to become effective \nin 2006, and it is anticipated that the provinces will share 48% of the \u201cdivisible pool.\u201d Shared tax \ntransfers (out of the divisible pool) account for 75\u201380% of total federal transfers to GOP, with \nthe  remainder  comprising  other  direct  transfers,  loans,  and  grants.  Provincial  finance \ncommissions (PFCs) have been established to allocate funds between the provinces and their \nlocal governments. The allocation is based on a number of criteria, including population, area \n(to reflect population densities), relative poverty, and revenue effort,17 and is complemented by \ntied or incentive-matching grants to achieve development goals and protect crucial programs.  \n \n15.  Budgeting and Expenditure Management. Traditionally, budgets have been prepared \nannually and there has been little medium- or long-term planning. Unpredictability in timing and \nshortfalls in federal resource transfers have hampered budget implementation, and resulted in a \nshortfall of actual spending against targets. Expenditures are allocated in a mechanical way that \ndoes not adequately reflect policy priorities or the needs of citizens, especially the poor. The \nannual development program (ADP) has become overloaded with a large number of schemes \nwith doubtful economic returns initiated because of political pressure. This has resulted in a \nlarge portfolio of underfunded ongoing projects, with a spillover of commitments and huge time \nand  cost  overruns.  In  order  to  improve  financial  planning  and  expenditure  management, \nsubprogram  1  supported  the  introduction  of  a  medium-term  budget  framework  (MTBF). \nHowever, more fundamental changes in budgeting and expenditure management are required \nto align budget allocations with policy priorities and improve efficiency in implementation. \n \n16.  Public Service Delivery Outcomes and Mechanisms. Lack of fiscal space has been a \nmajor reason for the continuous deterioration in the quality of public services. Public services \nare incapable of coping with a growing population and increasing environmental pressures. \nThey are often characterized by physical inaccessibility, facilities in a poor physical condition, \nweak institutional management capacity, lack of community involvement, low service standards, \nlack of attention to gender equity, and poor staff quality. Human development and the physical \n                                                 \n17 The ability of the local government to raise own resources through local taxes and other levies. ", "    5 \ninfrastructure are marked by a vicious cycle of shortage of funds, resulting in limited spending, \nservice delivery, development, and willingness to pay. Processes and institutional arrangements \nthat are still rooted in the administrative system that preceded Pakistan\u2019s independence have \nresulted in rigid  and  control-oriented  procedures  at  the provincial  level  that  are  inefficient, \nunsustainable, and unresponsive to the dynamic needs of society. A serious attempt to reform \nservice  delivery  structures  began  with  the  recent  devolution  plan,  but  this  needs  to  be \ncomplemented by further measures at the provincial level. A considerable improvement in social \nsector indicators is needed if Pakistan is to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. \n \n17.  Provincial\u2013Private  Sector  Relations.  Although  there  have  been  numerous  policy \nstatements  that  call  for  private  sector  development  and  the  investment  regime  has  been \nconsiderably liberalized over the past decade, there is still significant Government involvement \nat the policy and regulatory levels in the provision of infrastructure and economic support \nservices.  Regulatory  overlap  and  inconsistencies  remain  across  federal  and  provincial \ngovernments and institutions, resulting in high compliance costs for businesses. In addition, \nimperfections in the legal system and in access to justice impede acquisition and disposition of \nproperty and the enforcement of contracts.  \n \n18.  Traditionally,  the  Government  favored  supply  of  cheap,  often  subsidized,  inputs, \nincluding  infrastructure-related  services,  credit,  industrial,  and  agricultural  inputs.  The \nGovernment  has  also  attempted  to  regulate  prices  of  outputs,  in  particular  for  agricultural \nproduce. Government involvement has been mainly through about 130 autonomous bodies and \npublic sector organizations (PSOs) that employ more than 100,000 people. The performance of \nthese  PSOs  is  not  well  documented,  but  is  generally  considered  to  be  poor  and  their \naccumulated losses are estimated at about PRs35 billion. There is a realization that the role of \nGovernment needs to shift from providing key services directly to creating an environment that \nencourages private initiative and public\u2013private partnerships for the delivery of public goods and \nservices. \n \n19.   PRMP and Related Programs. ADB\u2019s strategy for its support to Punjab hinges on \ngovernance reforms and the creation of fiscal space, leading to efficient and effective public \nservice delivery outcomes. In addition to the PRMP, the Punjab Devolved Social Services \nProgram (DSSP)18 aims to support GOP to meet its social sector spending targets and to \nimprove mechanisms for fiscal transfers. The total financing available under the DSSP is $200 \nmillion, consisting of $75 million from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund, $75 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources (OCR), and a $50 million grant from the Department for International \nDevelopment  (DFID)  of  the  United  Kingdom.  As  agreed  with  GOP,  $75 million  has  been \nearmarked for formula-based transfers under the PFC to local governments, while $105 million \nwould be used to implement GOP\u2019s goal of sound provincial debt management and accelerated \nretirement of expensive debt. Under the DSSP, GOP agreed that fiscal savings accruing from \nreductions in interest rate charges will be invested in social sectors. DSSP further complements \nthe PRMP policy objectives to increase social sector allocations in line with Punjab\u2019s PRS and \nMTBF targets.  \n \n20.   In addition, the World Bank is supporting GOP through two Education Sector Reform \nPrograms since 2004.19 These programs of $100 million each increase the funds available for \neducation sector goals, such as higher primary school enrollment rates, especially for girls. \n                                                 \n18  ADB.  2003.

", "6     \nB.  Issues and Opportunities  \n21.  GOP faces fiscal, governance, and institutional challenges. Some of these have already \nbeen  identified  under  subprogram  1,  and  work  to  address  them  has  already  begun.20  A \nsuccessful response to the challenges could have a significant effect on the province\u2019s ability to \ndeliver high-quality public services, reduce poverty, and improve the quality of life for a large \nportion of the population.   \n \n1.  Fiscal \n \n22.  Until a few years ago, as witnessed in the federal government and other provinces, total \npublic spending in Punjab was being squeezed. On one hand, there were resource mobilization \nconstraints at the provincial level and flows from the central divisible pool were limited. Some of \nthese  constraints  continue.  On  the  other  hand,  ongoing  commitments  consumed  most \nrevenues, leaving little room for incremental spending or for adjusting allocations to support \npolicy priorities. Some of these issues were addressed under subprogram 1, with the result that \nrevenues from taxes within provincial control increased and changes in expenditure priorities \nwere made. However, much remains to be done.  \n \n23.  Narrow  Tax  Base  and  Inefficient  Collection.  As  key  taxes  are  collected  and \nadministered by the federal government, the provincial tax structure was characterized by many \nlow-yielding, inelastic taxes that did not add to provincial revenues. The share of provincial \ntaxes  had  declined  over  the  years  to  less  than  7%  of  GOP\u2019s  total  revenue  in  FY2003. \nSubprogram 1 identified this as a major problem and set targets for increased local-source \nrevenue for the province. In FY2005, the government local-source revenues grew by more than \n40%. Considerable potential for improvement remains, in particular for collection of agricultural \nincome tax (AIT) and the introduction of a general sales tax on services. Since 2000, GOP has \ntaken decisive steps to reform its provincial tax structure and has reduced the number of taxes \nfrom 36 to 9. It has changed assessments for agricultural income and is gradually introducing a \ngeneral sales tax on services. To generate returns, reforms in the tax structure need to be \ncomplemented  by  reforms  in  the  collection  system.  In  the  past,  tax  collection  has  been \ninefficient in part because of the large number of agencies involved. A review and consolidation \nof collection mechanisms would enhance transparency and effectiveness yielding considerable \nbenefits. Making the AIT income-based or shifting to a presumptive tax21 could yield significant \nbenefits for the province, and this is part of the reform agenda for subprogram 2.  \n \n24.  Unreliable Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers. The high degree of dependence on \nfederal  transfers  leaves  provincial  governments  exposed  to  national  policies  and  federal \nperformance, with little leeway to compensate for shortfalls in such transfers. The volatility of \ntransfers from the federal government\u2019s divisible pool makes provincial revenue and expenditure \nestimates unrealistic. However, partly because of higher economic growth rates and a better \nperformance from the federal revenue administration system, revenue transfers to the provinces \nhave improved substantially and have been in line with the budgeted receipts, resulting in a \nsharp decline in the unpredictability and volatility of transfers. The new NFC award, expected to \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2005. Punjab Resource Management Program Progress Report: Release of Second Tranche.

It allows the payee to create an asset based on a presumed income and actual withholding tax \npaid. ", "    7 \nbe announced by December 2005,22 should reduce uncertainty further as it is anticipated that \nresources available to the provinces will improve further.  \n \n25.   With  fiscal  decentralization,  much  spending  authority  has  been  delegated  to  local \ngovernments.  A  key  challenge  is  to  develop  a  sustainable,  transparent,  and  effective \nintergovernmental transfer mechanism. The first steps have been taken at the provincial level \nwith the establishment of PFCs and the introduction of block allocations to districts. Some of the \nbasic requirements for supporting the devolution framework have been met under subprogram \n1, but much remains to be done on matters pertaining to administrative and financial reform and \nenhancing governmental capacity to deliver social and public services of an acceptable quality. \nThe  ongoing  Decentralization  Support  Program  (DSP)23  is  supporting  the  provincial \ngovernments to finalize the PFC awards through focused TA and continued policy dialogue. \nSubprogram 2 complements and reinforces this process by seeking assurances from GOP that \ndevelopment budgets will be transferred to local governments in a predictable, timely, and \ntransparent manner. Under PRMP, GOP will complete the establishment of the PFC before the \nend of 2005. It will allocate PRs99 billion partly according to a formula and partly to reward the \nbetter performing local governments. \n \n26.  Skewed  and  Rigid  Expenditure  Structure  and  Unfunded  Liabilities.  On  the \nexpenditure side, flexibility is limited by high operating costs (salaries and pension payments), \nwhich account for more than half of total spending. This is a result of an overextended, partly \nuneconomic, public infrastructure and overstaffed, ineffective social service networks that are \nfiscally unsustainable. The servicing of provincial debt as a percentage of the total provincial \nexpenditures continues to decrease and dropped from 13.5% in FY2000 to an estimated 9% in \nFY2006. This is partly because of the increase in provincial revenues and partly because of \nmeasures such as early retirement of cash development loans (supported under subprogram 1). \nThe provincial government continues to take steps to limit further increases in operating costs, \nreduce subsidies, and implement its debt management strategy.   \n \n27.  Increase of Liabilities. Punjab\u2019s debt has increased considerably over the past decade, \nand there was an accumulated debt stock of PRs162.6 billion at the end of FY2005. A large \nportion of this, PRs67.5 billion, was financed by cash development loans with high interest rates \n(some above 17% per annum). Refinancing of liabilities was initiated through subprogram1 and \nso far PRs5.76 billion of expensive cash development loans has been retired. GOP needs to \nimplement its debt reduction strategy to make the debt burden more manageable and create \nfiscal  space  to  re-prioritize  its  expenditures.  Although  GOP  could  use  the  proceeds  of \nsubprogram 2 for the same purpose, it also needs to establish dedicated funds to cover its \nunfunded and contingent liabilities. In particular, the unfunded liabilities of the pensions and the \nGeneral Provident Funds need to be addressed urgently. Now that some fiscal space has been \ncreated for Punjab in the last couple of years, GOP needs to take a close and critical look at its \nexpenditure priorities so that actual expenditures can be brought into line with the priorities \nidentified by the medium-term vision of the government. \n  \n28.  Inefficient  Subsidies.  The  major  subsidy  provided  by  GOP  is  for  wheat  prices. \nHowever,  this  is  not  targeted  at  the  poor.  In  fact,  it  leads  to  market  distortion,  as  the \nGovernment buys wheat expensively (and bears storage and transportation costs) and sells it \n                                                 \n22 The fifth National Finance Commission award, adopted in 1997, was supposed to be valid for 5 years but failure to \nreach agreement on a sixth award has meant that the fifth is still in operation. \n23  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on the Proposed Program and \nTechnical Assistance Loans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Decentralization Support Program. Manila. \n ", "8     \nmore  cheaply  to  the  mills.  The  overall  benefit  of  the  subsidy  is  diluted  since  it  leads  to \n(i) corruption when government stockpiles are released to mills, (ii) an incentive to smuggle \nsubsidized wheat out of the country (predominantly to Afghanistan), and (iii) hoarding because \ndemand and supply in local markets do not match. GOP started to reduce this subsidy under \nsubprogram 1 from PRs2 billion in FY2004 and is committed to phasing it out completely.       \n \n2.   Governance and Institutional Issues \n \n29.  Although  the  Punjab  LGO  was  promulgated  in  2001,  putting  administrative  and \ninstitutional changes in place will take time. Local governments have been empowered to take \nover  a  number  of  important  functions,  especially  those  related  to  provision  of  local  public \nservices. Significant changes are still needed in the administration, institutional structure, and in \nrules,  regulations,  and  laws  related  to  local  administration.  Subprogram  2  will  continue  to \nsupport GOP to achieve specific targets in this regard. \n \n30.  More Private Sector Involvement. To improve the coverage and quality of services, \nwater supply, sanitation, road construction, and maintenance could be partially provided by the \nprivate sector. The potential for public\u2013private partnerships is being explored. Subprogram 2 will \nhelp GOP to work more closely with the private sector by (i) facilitating governance structures in \nspecific sectors, (ii) amending rules and laws governing such activities, and (iii) establishing \ninstitutional  arrangements  to  improve  links  with  institutions  such  as  the  Punjab  Health \nFoundation. Continuing the work of subprogram 1, subprogram 2 will work with GOP to further \nreduce direct public sector involvement, especially through an action plan to restructure PSOs \nowned by GOP. \n \n31.   A major impediment to private sector development is the inability of companies to secure \nland assets. In Pakistan, the management of land records faces two fundamental problems: \n(i) maintenance of records is poor and records are updated only after a considerable time-lag, \nand  (ii)  the  records  contain  only  presumptive  title  holders  on  the  title  documents.  These \nproblems reduce the value of the title document and restrict the use of land for collateral. A vast \namount of valuable resources cannot be used as security to finance the needs of businesses. \nUnder subprogram 2, GOP will improve the maintenance of the land records by automating the \nproperty record and property tax collection databases in the urban areas through selected \nTMAs. A World Bank study is attending to similar issues for the rural areas. Both initiatives are \nexpected to improve the business environment substantially and to increase private sector \ndevelopment.  \n \n32.  Ineffective and Rigid Administrative Structures. The public sector as a whole is \noverextended.  Punjab\u2019s  public  sector  employs  nearly  1  million  people,  most  of  whom  are \nemployees of GOP. There are about 862,000 official positions in education, health, police, \nirrigation, and agriculture. The administrative structure is centralized and does not allow for \nflexibility in responding to needs, in particular in those areas where services are delivered at the \nlocal level. Most employees are at lower salary grades, including 20% at grade 1, which is \nessentially unskilled staff, and 40% at low-skilled grades 2\u20135. As a result, the bureaucracy has \nbecome unmanageable, with considerable duplication of functions. Efforts by GOP to address \nthese shortcomings, as well as the development of a civil service reform strategy, will be \nsupported under subprogram 2.  \n \n33.  Tackling  Rent-seeking  Behavior.  Rent-seeking  takes  place  when  uncompensated \nvalue  is  extracted  from  others  by  manipulating  the  economic  environment.  Rent-seeking \nopportunities  exist  in  all  societies  and  come  in  different  forms  (from  creating  economic ", "    9 \ndistortions through favoritism to share value manipulation). In Pakistan, because of the low \nsalaries and lack of accountability, public servants indulge in rent-seeking activities that have a \ndirect impact on the poor by reducing their disposable income after rents have been extracted \nfrom the system. Another major cause of rent-seeking in the public sector is low budgets for the \noperational  costs  of  running  public  services.  These  low  budgets  encourage  rent-seeking \nbehavior so that operational costs can be funded. Subprogram 2 includes four major activities \nthat will assist Punjab to decrease rent-seeking: (i) greater accountability as a result of better \nprocurement rules and regulations that require all procured goods to be listed as unit costs on \nGOP official procurement website; (ii) the introduction of public expenditure tracking surveys to \nidentify leaks from budgets to \u201cfrontline\u201d service providers; (iii) the establishment of a change \nmanagement unit (CMU) to help GOP identify opportunities for restructuring the civil service and \nmaking it more efficient and accountable; and (iv) a progressive increase in operational budgets \nto minimize rent-seeking caused by the need to finance operational costs. \n \n34.  Human  Resources  Management  and  Accountability.  The  weak  performance  of \nPunjab\u2019s public institutions is largely a reflection of inadequate human resources policies and \nmanagement, and lack of accountability. In many cases, staff do not have the skills to perform \nthe functions they are assigned to carry out. This is partly because of frequent rotations of \nstaff\u2014despite  the  recently  announced  minimum  tenure  policy  by  the  cabinet\u2014as  well  as \nappointments made under political pressure. GOP has recently issued a revised appointments \npolicy and increased the number of services that are contracted to the private sector, a trend \nthat needs to be continued. However, promotion policy and guidelines are not clear, and, in the \nabsence of clear accountability, rules, and performance monitoring systems, upward mobility of \nstaff is still based more on seniority than on performance. Together with a highly compressed \nwage  structure  that  has  not  kept  pace  with  market  trends,  especially  for  positions  of \nresponsibility, it has become increasingly difficult to attract and retain suitable talent for key \ninstitutions. However, Punjab has a large human resources pool to tap into, and improvements \nin human resources policy, combined with greater outsourcing to the private sector (using \nclearly defined performance criteria) could yield considerable efficiency gains.  \n \n35.  Another  serious  challenge  for  GOP  since  the  devolution  of  powers  in  2001  is  the \nstreamlining  of  the  provincial  civil  service.  Currently,  most  local  government  technical  and \nadministrative staff are recruited and managed by the provincial government, which distorts \naccountabilities at the local level. This has serious implications for local government human \nresources management and public service delivery. Under the revised legal framework, GOP is \nmandated to create and support a district civil service in order to remove these distortions. \nPRMP will work with GOP to do this and through the TA program, ADB will help GOP to prepare \na workable and efficient human resources policy with a medium- to long-term vision. The CMU \nto be established under subprogram 2 will also play a role in rationalizing and reforming the civil \nservice at the provincial and local levels. \n \n36.  Gender Inequalities.  The provincial governments are committed to gender equality \nand, in consultation with the federal government, have prepared gender reform action plans \n(GRAPs). These contain gender commitments made by the federal and provincial governments \nthrough four central themes: (i) improving the representation and participation of women in \npolitical and administrative structures; (ii) moving from social welfare to women\u2019s development \nand  eventually  to  gender  equality;  (iii) restructuring  provincial  and  district  government \narrangements from a gender perspective; and (iv) using planning and budgetary processes to \nnarrow the gender gap. GOP has recently approved a major program to fund the actions \nproposed in GRAP. To ensure that there is continuity in these gender-related reforms, there is ", "10    \nan  urgent  need  to  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the  GRAP  with  subprogram  2 \n(Supplementary Appendix 2).  \n \n3.  Lessons Learned  \n37.  The formulation and design of subprogram 2 build on the institutions, mechanisms, \nexperiences, and achievements of subprogram 1. Subprogram 2 also benefits from the lessons \nlearned in implementation of governance and social sector programs in Pakistan.24   \n \n(i)  Strong leadership, ownership, and consultation. To succeed, the reforms \nmust be designed, owned, and implemented by stakeholders, especially GOP \nand its departments. Accordingly, high-level support has been integrated into the  \nsubprogram  2  design  through  the  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  chief \nsecretary.  The  reform  agenda  was  developed  by  GOP  and  was  expanded \nthrough two Punjab Development Forums (16-17 September 2003, 18-19 April \n2005) to enable broad-based stakeholder participation.25 There have also been \nextensive consultations with representatives from civil society, the private sector, \nthe media, and other partner organizations. \n \n(ii)  Improved coordination, facilitation, and monitoring. Stakeholder coordination \nis required to maintain and enhance aid effectiveness and avoid overlaps. To \nensure this, a provincial reform coordination office under the chief secretary has \nbeen  operational  since  September  2005  to  coordinate  the  interventions  of \ninternational development partners as well as between various GOP departments \ninvolved in implementing PRMP.  \n \n(iii)  Effective management of change. The fundamental nature of PRMP reforms \nrequires  a  coordinated  change  management  process  for  a  phased  and \nsequenced implementation with stakeholder support at all stages. Accordingly, a \nCMU under the chief secretary will be set up with emphasis on feedback from all \nlevels of the civil service. This feedback will serve to refine policy reforms during \nsubprogram 2, as well as to define the reform agenda for subprogram 3.  \n \n(iv)  Enhanced communication on policy reforms. Dissemination of reforms and \noutcomes is important for reducing resistance to change and enabling a wider \nconsensus. Subprogram 2 will provide regular and targeted information on policy \nreforms at the PRMP website. The program management unit (PMU) will also \ndevelop a time-bound media plan including translation into local languages to \neffectively articulate reforms to a wider audience.  \n \n(v)   Proactive Implementation. It is important that the PMU proactively anticipates \nand  resolves  implementation  issues  rather  than  merely  coordinating \nimplementation. Subprogram 2 expects the PMU to play a more active role in \nfacilitating implementation, monitoring results, and generating ideas about further \nreforms to be included under subprogram 3. The delay in some of the outputs of \nsubprogram 1 is linked to capacity issues at the PMU. There were delays in \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2005.

Summary information on external assistance to the sector and \non ADB assistance to GOP is in Appendix 3.  \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n39.  Under subprogram 1, the GOP managed to achieve effective short- to medium-term \nfiscal  management.  This  enabled  higher  social  sector  spending  and  relatively  robust  local \ngovernment  development  budgets.  However,  long-term  resource  management  will  require \nimprovements in the policy making environment. Long-term change management can only be \nsustained through a professional and accountable civil service. In addition, effective long-term \nresource management will entail rationalizing the role of the public sector, taking into account \nthe  current  and  future  liabilities  of  GOP,  and  the  need  to  improve  its  revenue generating \ncapacity. Facilitating private sector development will enable GOP to improve service delivery, \nreduce  public  sector  employment  pressures,  and  support  sustainable  economic  growth. \nSubprogram  2  will  support  this  agenda  in  line  with  the  medium-term  budget  framework \ndeveloped by GOP (Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix 4). \n \n40.  Subprogram 2 formulation was coordinated with stakeholder from various levels of GOP, \ncivil society, private sector, NGOs, and development partners. The GOP is fully committed to \nthe  subprogram  2  reform  agenda.  The  program  framework  is  in  Appendix  1,  and  the \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix are in Appendix 4. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome   \n41.  Governance Reforms for Poverty Reduction. The goal of the subprogram 2 is to \nimprove fiscal and financial governance and public service delivery, leading to poverty reduction \nin Punjab. Subprogram 2 seeks to support the GOP to realize the policy agenda outlined in the \nPunjab  Vision  2020,26  the  Punjab  Economic  Report  (footnote  14),  and  the  national  PRS. \nTechnical support will be provided to GOP to undertake policy and institutional reforms and to \neffectively manage change management process. Subprogram 2 will build on other governance-\nrelated programs such as the DSP (footnote 23) and the DSSP (footnote 18) that promote fiscal \ndevolution, decentralized social service delivery, local accountability, and implementation of the \nprovincial gender reform action plan.  \n \n42.  Realign Governance Structures, Systems, and Procedures.  The purpose and policy \nobjectives of subprogram 2 are to assist Punjab through reforms in governance structures, \nsystems, and procedures to: \n(i)   provide  fiscal  space  for  sustainable  development  and  improve  monitoring \nmechanisms for effective and transparent allocation and utilization of funds; \n(ii)   adjust and strengthen institutional arrangements to increase the pro-poor impact \nof public expenditure and improve service delivery; and  \n                                                 \n26  Government of the Punjab. 2004.

Program Cluster Modality. The PRMP cluster modality consists of three subprograms \nwith each subprogram divided into three components with specified key result areas (KRAs): (i) \nreforming  provincial  finances  through  fiscal  restructuring  and  financial  management;  (ii) \nreforming processes and institutions for pro-poor service delivery, and (iii) creating opportunities \nfor growth and income generation through private sector development. The second tranche of \nthe two tranche subprogram 1 was released in June 2005. Of the 22 second tranche conditions, \nthe GOP fully complied with 18 and substantially complied with 4 (Supplementary Appendix 5). \nThe GOP remains committed to complying fully with the 4 conditions that were assessed as \nsubstantially complied.  \n \n44.  Subprogram 2, consisting of two tranches, builds on subprogram 1 by targeting 11 \noutcomes to allow for a streamlined focus on the key priorities of GOP (paras. 46-66), as \nidentified  in  the  development  policy  letter  (Appendix  4),  particularly  in  fiscal  and  financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  civil  service  reforms.  Subprogram  2  also  emphasizes  on \ncapacity development of the executing and implementing agencies to implement the proposed \nreforms and to help GOP to develop further reform solutions to be supported under subprogram \n3. Use of the sizeable TA27 resources provided by ADB and DFID will support capacity building.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n45.  Subprogram 2 follows the PRMP cluster design. The components and KRAs remain the \nsame as for subprogram 1. However, while subprogram 1 had a strong focus on component 1, \nsubprogram 2 emphasis is on components 2 and 3 for establishing a long-term basis for \neconomic growth and poverty reduction and supporting private sector development. Table 1 \npresents an overview of focal areas under each of the seven KRAs. Further details on the \nsequencing of reforms are outlined in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). \n \nTable 1: Focal Areas of Subprogram 2 \nKey Result Areas (KRAs)  Focal Area  \nFirst Tranche  Second Tranche  \nComponent 1: Reforming Provincial Finances through Fiscal Restructuring and Financial Management \nKRA1.

Reforming Provincial Finances through Fiscal Restructuring and Financial \nManagement \n \na.  KRA 1: Strengthen Provincial Revenues \n \n46.  Progress to date. GOP implemented major reforms to consolidate, restructure, and \nenhance collection of provincial taxes and other revenues to provide the basis for sustainable \nprovincial revenue. The major result was an increase in provincial tax receipts in FY2004 by \nmore  than  44%  in  nominal  terms,  reflecting  higher  levels  of  provincial  revenue-generating \nresponsibilities as part of the overall devolution process in Pakistan. The much higher than \nenvisaged increase\u2014a minimum of 12% was targeted\u2014was achieved by (i) broadening the \nbase  of  professional  tax  by  including  lawyers,  jewelers,  and  wholesale  tobacco  dealers; \n(ii) revising the urban immovable property tax (UIPT); (iii) revising stamp duty collection; and \n(iv) introducing a flat rate abiana (irrigation water charge). Subprogram 2 will continue to support \nreforms to strengthen provincial revenues.  \n \n47.  Outcome 1: Broaden Tax Base: Rationalize and Restructure Provincial Taxes and \nDuties. Under subprogram 2, the tax structure and rates will be rationalized to increase annual \nprovincial tax revenues by at least 14% in FY2006 and by 16% in the budget for FY2007. Efforts \nto increase the collection of AIT will be supported and the UIPT rates will be increased. The \nExcise and Taxation Department (E&TD) will phase-in rationalization of the tax rate, simplify tax \nassessment  and  collection,  and  reduce  differential  tax  rates  between  owner-occupied  and \nrented commercial and residential properties. E&TD will also formulate a policy to revise the tax \nassessment valuation table every 3 years, based on the UIPT index assessment. The revision \nto the valuations will take account of inflation and ensure that the tax base remains realistic and \nbuoyant. Capacity development of the Board of Revenue (BOR) will ensure that the targets for \ntaxation reform are achievable. BOR will also simplify, rationalize, and enhance the elasticity of \nstamp duty by reducing the number of serials and exemptions and converting flat rate duties to \nad valorem duties. \n \nb.  KRA 2: Rationalize Provincial Expenditures \n \n48.  Progress to date. Subprogram 1 helped to change GOP\u2019s expenditure pattern by re-\nprofiling debt and building a long-term strategy to gradually reduce the servicing of debt. Within \nthe  first  year  of  PRMP,  there  was  an  increase  in expenditures on high-priority social sector  \n ", "14    \ninterventions. In the GOP white paper, 2004\u20132005, budgetary allocations for FY2005 increased \nover the previous year by 19.8% for health, 28.4% for education, and 591.0% for water supply. \nAllocations in the ADP for FY2005 increased over the previous year by 37.7% for education, \n132.6% for health, and 167.1% for water supply.  These developments were directly supported \nby (i) reducing the provincial debt by retiring cash development loans using the proceeds of the \nfirst tranche of the PRMP; (ii) reducing contingent liabilities (e.g., limiting the GOP\u2019s guarantee \nof loans to PSOs and establishing a separate General Provident Fund; (iii) restructuring and \nrationalizing government subsidies by phasing out subsidies that do not explicitly target the \npoor; and (iv) rationalizing the ADP and making it consistent with availability of funds in the \nMTBF projections. Subprogram 2 will further rationalize expenditures and continue to create \nfiscal space through debt restructuring \n \n49.  Outcome 2:   Reduce Provincial Debt and Contingent Liabilities. To reduce its debt \nburden, GOP will accelerate the retirement of expensive domestic public debt. It is projected \nthat debt servicing of interest only will be reduced from 6.4% of current expenditures in FY2005 \nto 5.0% in FY2006. GOP is committed to establishing a legal and regulatory framework for the \ncapitalization of both the pension fund and the General Provident Fund. It is expected that GOP \nwill capitalize the pension and General Provident Funds with an amount of at least PRs12 billion \nby the end of subprogram 2.  \n \n50.  Outcome 3:   Re-prioritization of Expenditures to Improve Public Service Delivery.  \nSubprogram  2  will  focus  on  ameliorating  the  chronic  problems  of  low  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) budgets and inadequate non-salary budgets28 that have impeded effective \nservice  delivery  outcomes  and  encouraged  rent-seeking  behavior.  In  the  past,  O&M29 \nallocations have been less than 5% of current expenditures and non-salary allocations have \nbeen less than 9%. GOP is committed to increasing expenditure on O&M to at least 8% and on \nnon-salary expenditures to at least 12% of current expenditures. \n \nc.  KRA 3: Improve Effectiveness, Predictability, and Accountability in \nFinancial Management \n \n51.  Progress to date. As a result of subprogram 1, there has been considerable progress in \nfinancial  management.  Achievements  include  (i)  the  MTBF;  (ii)  more  transparent  inter-\ngovernment  financing  (in  conjunction  with  the  DSP);  and  (iii) timely,  reliable  and  publicly \navailable accounts, which are reconciled by function and object and published on GOP website. \nSubprogram 2 will help GOP to refine the MTBF format.  \n \n52.  Outcome 4: Transparent and User-friendly Budgets within the MTBF and Timely, \nReliable and Publicly Accessible Accounts. Under subprogram 2, the refined MTBF will be \napproved and will guide GOP\u2019s budgetary planning for FY2006 and FY2007. A dedicated MTBF \ncell will be established, and the budgets of the Communications and Works Department, and \nthe Irrigation Department will follow the MTBF format. The PFC award will be finalized and \nissued before FY2007 budget is prepared according to the new approved framework. The PFC \n                                                 \n28 Non-salary is a provision in the current budget for operational expenses other than salary and allowance of staff \nand includes provisions for office stationery and other consumables, fuel, electricity, telephone and gas charges, \nand for petty repairs. \n29 The operation and maintenance (O&M) provision in the current budget relates to assets created and maintained by \nthe infrastructure departments such as Communication and Works, Irrigation and Public Health Departments. The \nreleases are made in the annual budget on the basis of a yardstick proposed by the department concerned and \napproved by the Finance Department and include expenditures on road repairs, repair and maintenance of \nbuildings, barrages and canals, etc.  \n ", "    15 \naward will reflect the inter-governmental improvements by instituting new performance and \nincentive-based grants system for local governments.  \n53.  The  implementation  by  GOP  of  agreements  on  the  Project  for  Integrated  Financial \nReporting and Auditing is ongoing with World Bank support covers a wide range of public sector \naccounting  and  auditing  reforms.  GOP  will  place  monthly  civil  accounts  on  the  financial \ndepartment  website.  An  action  plan  will  facilitate  the  preparation  of  district  budgets  and \naccounts according to the national accounting model. Financial rules will be revised to ensure \nconsistency with the new accounting framework.  \n \n54.  Outcome 5:  Transparent  and  Efficient  Procurement  of  Goods  and  Services. \nSubprogram 2 will focus on transparent and efficient procurement of goods and services. During \nthe next 12 months, the annual procurement plans of the Services and General Administration \nDepartment (S&GAD), the Health Department, and possibly others will be posted on GOP\u2019s \nprocurement website. S&GAD will standardize common procurement items and will update the \npurchase manual. These activities will be based on international best practices and procedures \nfor procuring goods and services. Capacity development of S&GAD will be undertaken at the \nsame time. GOP will notify departmental purchase committees through amendments to the \npurchase manual on the eligibility criteria for pre-qualifying suppliers based on international best \npractices. It will design specifications for tenders and evaluate tender bids based on transparent \nand  defensible  criteria.  Clear  dispute  resolution  criteria  will  be  inserted  into  the  updated \npurchase manual. Subprogram 2 will further facilitate the posting of unit costs of procured goods \non the official government website. \n \nd.  KRA 4: Improve Strategic Programming of Investments for Poverty \nReduction \n55.  Progress to date. Under subprogram 1, important milestones were reached. First, a \ndraft medium-term poverty-focused investments strategy was developed for key sectors and \nshared at the second Punjab Development Forum in 2005. Second, progress was made in \ndeveloping effective systems and procedures to meet provincial goals and priorities, including \nmedium-term strategies for the education, health, water supply and sanitation, housing, urban \ndevelopment,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  and  livestock  and  dairy  development \nsectors. Third, PRMP helped to improve monitoring, feedback and evaluation systems, primarily \nby reconciling actual expenditures against budget estimates and revised estimates, which are \nupdated quarterly on GOP\u2019s website. An annual report on capacity building actions by the \nprovince and local governments was also launched. Subprogram 2 will help GOP to further \nimprove capacity development for strategic programming.  \n56.  Outcome 6:  Effective Systems and Procedures to Implement Provincial Goals \nand Priorities. Subprogram 2 will invest in a capacity development program for GOP that will \nenable the poverty-focused investments strategy to be implemented in at least six departments. \nFollowing extensive consultation with provincial and local government agencies, a package of \nreforms (i.e., a draft policy matrix) will be drawn up and implemented under subprogram 3. In \naddition, subprogram 2 will strengthen expenditure tracking systems to assess the actual results \nof inputs and revenues allocated for pro-poor social sector spending and will take gender \nconsiderations into account. Such tracking procedures will result in better long-term planning \nand  resource  allocation.  The  TA  project  will  build  capacities  in  the  provincial  and  local \ngovernments so they can build on what has already been achieved under the DSP.  \n ", "16    \ne.  KRA  5:  Restructure  and  Strengthen  Government,  Administration, \nand Human Resource Development \n \n57.  Progress  to  date.  The  Finance  Department  and  the  Planning  and  Development \nDepartment (P&DD) have begun to implement major reforms to improve their planning and \nfiscal  and  financial  management.  Implementation  of  a  restructuring  plan  for  the  Finance \nDepartment began in January 2005. The P&DD established a number of semi-autonomous \nunits  and  cells  which  reflect  the  province\u2019s  need  to  respond  to  globalization  and  the \ndepartment\u2019s  new  roles  under  devolution.  Subprogram  2  will  strengthen  these  institutional \nreforms and initiate further policy shifts to streamline human resources management in two \nmore departments.  \n \n58.  Outcome 7:  Reform, Restructure, and Enhance Capacity of Provincial Agencies \nResponsible for Policy, Planning, and Fiscal and Financial Management. To facilitate a \nchange  in  management,  a  departmental  restructuring  study  will  be  undertaken  using  TA \nresources. The results of this study will be used to guide the reform process over the next 18 \nmonths. Before then, GOP will (i) clearly differentiate between contract jobs and regular jobs \n(with incentive and pay structures), setting out the principles for these categories in the Health \nand Irrigation and Power Departments; (ii) clarify the rules governing mobility between district \nand  provincial  workforces  in  the  Education  Department;  and  (iii)  reorganize  the  Finance \nDepartment and P&DD along functional lines. GOP will enlarge the scope of delegation of \ndepartmental authority to improve efficiency in at least three departments (Irrigation and Power, \nFinance, and Health) and issue a revised delegation of authority during 2006.  \n \n59.  To deepen the reform process, GOP will establish a CMU which will guide and support \nthe Government on civil service restructuring. The CMU will conduct professionally facilitated \nmonthly workshops, the findings of which will be published in a bulletin. It will be responsible for \nincluding gender considerations in all its proposed reform initiatives. \n \n60.  Outcome 8:  Merit-based,  Transparent,  and  Institutionalized  System  of \nRecruitment, Promotions, and Transfers. Subprogram 2 will aim to improve the quality of \npersonnel  recruitment  and  career  management.  GOP  will  amend  Punjab\u2019s  Public  Service \nCommission Regulations to strengthen the autonomy of members by enhancing their period of \ntenure while making tenure nonrenewable. GOP will also incorporate members\u2019 eligibility criteria \ninto  the  regulations  to  improve  the  selection  of  the  commission\u2019s  members.  S&GAD  will \nannounce a human resources policy to support merit-based recruitment and promotion. The \nHealth and Education departments will institute pay structures that incorporate incentives for \ncontract posts in remote areas. The Finance Department and S&GAD will begin the civil service \ncensus before the end of 2005 and complete it for at least 10 districts or departments within \nGOP before June 2007. The census will be used to develop a database to reconcile payroll and \npension records and employee-related liabilities. Commitments under the GOP gender reform \naction plan will also be implemented through subprogram 2.30 \n  \nf.  KRA 6: Regulatory and Administrative Reforms for Private Sector \nDevelopment and Public Private Partnership \n \n61.  Progress to date. Subprogram 1 helped GOP to initiate reforms in the private sector. \nFirst, new labor policies, rules, and regulations were supported. Administrative reforms included \n                                                 \n30  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to Support Implementation of Gender Reform Action Plan. Manila.

", "    17 \nthe establishment of a child protection bureau and the Punjab Social Health Management \nCompany, a public\u2013private partnership. Second, work commenced on addressing the problems \nin  securing  land  assets,  a  major  impediment  to  private  sector  development.  Third,  a  new \nindustrial policy, 2004-2005, including guidelines for enhanced private sector development, was \napproved.  Several  industrial  estates  were  established  as  public\u2013private  partnerships  to \novercome  the  problem  of  securing  land  assets.  Under  subprogram  2,  private  sector \ndevelopment will be supported by further reforms.  \n \n62.  Outcome 9:  Streamlined  Regulations  and  Effective  Implementation  for \nSustainable Private Sector Development. Under subprogram 2, an urban development policy \nand institutional framework will be approved by the chief minister with time-bound targets to \nrevise and develop zoning and building regulations in Lahore and one other city in line with \nmodern urban planning standards. The provincial cabinet will approve time-bound proposals to \nrevive the Punjab Health Foundation with a view to pilot-testing public\u2013private partnership in the \nmanagement of basic health units (including a monitoring and evaluation system) and other \nhealth facilities.  \n \n63.  GOP will approve a policy to develop markets outside cities for bulk trading of agriculture \nproducts. The provincial cabinet will approve amendment in laws designed to eliminate the \nmonopoly of public sector nominated market committees and to allow private firms and farmers \nto sell their produce in any market. With the support of other departments, P&DD will undertake \nan assessment to identify all existing laws, policies and regulations that hamper private sector \ndevelopment.   \n \n64.  Outcome 10: Transparent Security of Property Rights and Improved Utilization of \nLand  Assets,  through  Effective  Land  Registration  and  Management  System.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the provincial cabinet will approve changes to the Rent Control Ordinance, 1959, \nto ensure that (i) rental transactions are governed by contracts between tenant and owner \n(sanctity of contract); (ii) the controller\u2019s powers to fix rents are withdrawn (henceforth rents will \nbe governed by contract); and (iii) the pro-tenant bias is reduced in matters relating to eviction of \ntenants and role of the rent controller is reduced in eviction proceedings (eviction should be \ngoverned by contract and breaches should be decided by the relevant court). The BOR will \ninitiate a technical study of urban land titling systems in order to improve documentation and \nprovide  greater  security  for  and  transparency  of  property  rights  and  systems  for  property \nregistration. E&TD will formulate a policy with a phased, time-bound action plan for automation \nof  urban  property  records  and  property  tax  collection  systems  in  five  TMAs  (e.g., Lahore, \nRawalpinidi, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, and Sialkot). These reforms will lead to higher property \ntax collection, minimize rents, and result in secure land titling.  \n \ng.  KRA 7: Reduce Direct Public Sector Involvement in Economic and/or \nCommercial Operations \n \n65.  Progress to date. Under subprogram 1, studies were undertaken to assess the public \nliabilities of the province and its PSOs. Recommendations of the studies will be implemented \nduring subprogram 2. \n \n66.  Outcome 11: Reform of PSOs Involved in Economic and Commercial Activities: \nRestructure, Privatize, or Close. GOP restructured the Punjab Mineral Development Board in \n2005 as part of subprogram 1. It is currently restructuring the Punjab Provincial Cooperative \nBank. Under subprogram 2, GOP will restructure the Agricultural Research Board, the Punjab \nLibrary Foundation, and the Punjab Privatization Board. It will restructure small industrial estates ", "18    \nunder  the  Pakistan  Small  Industries  Corporation  by  transferring  the  management  of  small \nindustrial estates to associations of industrialists. GOP will announce a PSO management \npolicy with a 2-year phased restructuring plan for all PSOs including timeframes for privatization, \ndivestment, liquidation or restructuring, including rationalization of staffing structures in PSOs. A \nstudy under the TA loan is assessing the viability of such key PSOs as the Punjab Small \nIndustries  Corporation,  the  Tourism  Development  Corporation  of  Punjab,  the  Punjab \nGovernment Printing Press, the Punjab Seed Corporation, and the Bank of Punjab. GOP will be \nsupported to outsource the management and operations of well-equipped vocational training \ninstitutions as part of the ongoing PSO restructuring process. Throughout subprogram 2, ADB \nwill work with GOP to reduce the public sector\u2019s direct engagement in commercial activities and \nto identify policy options for further private sector development. \n  \nC.  Important Features \n \n67.  As part of PRMP, subprogram 2 is a critical link between what has been achieved during \nsubprogram 1 and what is expected during subprogram 3. As envisaged at the design of PRMP, \nthe cluster modality has enabled a dynamic development process by integrating various reform \ninitiatives  over  a  medium-term  time  frame,  while  allowing  flexibility  for  performance-based \nadjustments.  The  effective  short-  to  medium-term  fiscal  management  achieved  during \nsubprogram 1 indicates that creating fiscal space is a better development intervention than \nfinancing incremental expenditures. In addition, subprogram 2 integrates the key elements of \nADB\u2019s poverty reduction, private sector development, governance, gender, and anti-corruption \nstrategies. The expected impact of subprogram 2 is considerably enhanced by building on other \nADB-financed governance-related programs, such as the DSP and DSSP, which promote fiscal \ndevolution, decentralized social service delivery, local accountability, and gender reform.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n68.  Loan Amount and Standard Terms and Conditions. The Government has requested \na loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s OCR to help finance subprogram 2 of the PRMP. The loan \nwill have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement.31 The federal government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB.    \n \n69.  Interest rate and currency conversion options may be exercised in accordance with the \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nconversion guidelines. \n \n70.  Cost of Reforms. The cost of adjustment for subprogram 2 of PRMP is estimated to be \nabout PRs25 billion ($418 million equivalent)32, consisting of the following main components \n(Supplementary Appendix 6): \n(i)   restructuring of provincial liabilities, including debt write-off and provisioning against \nguarantees ($215 million equivalent); and  \n                                                 \n31 A waiver of the usual 1% front-end fee and a waiver of 20-basis points of the lending spread are given to all new \npublic sector loans approved before 30 June 2006.  \n32 Estimated adjustment costs are in Supplementary Appendix 6. ", "    19 \n(ii)  funding of pension liabilities and recapitalization of the General Provident Fund \n($203 million equivalent). \n \n71.  Onlending to GOP. The Government will onlend the local currency generated from the \nproceeds of the loan to GOP. The terms and conditions will be the same as those given by ADB \nto the Government. The Government will assume the foreign exchange risk and GOP will bear \nthe interest rate risk. \n \n72.  Counterpart Funds. The local currency counterpart funds, to be generated from the \nloan, will be used to retire expensive provincial debt (i.e., cash development loans). The savings \nto be generated from the retirement of expensive debt will be used to finance the cost of \nstructural adjustment, establish funds and facilities, and finance high-priority social and human \ndevelopment programs targeted at the poor. GOP will certify the utilization of counterpart funds \nin line with the loan agreement through audited statements acceptable to ADB. In addition, GOP \nis committed to use its own resources to capitalize pension and General Provident Funds. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n  1.    Program Management  \n \n73.  Execution and Implementation Arrangements. GOP will be responsible for program \nimplementation  and  the  effective  utilization  of  the  counterpart  funds  generated  from  loan \nproceeds. P&DD will continue to be the executing agency for the PRMP cluster and the TA loan. \nThe PMU is staffed and equipped and will help P&DD to coordinate and facilitate efforts at all \nimplementing agencies33 to ensure that the targeted achievements are attained. The PMU will \nliaise  with  ADB  on  all  program  administration  matters  and  will  inform  the  public  of \nimplementation progress through the PRMP website and other initiatives prepared under the \nmedia plan.34  \n \n74.  Since activities under the TA loan are still ongoing, the implementing agencies are in \nplace. All agencies have focal persons and a core team which will help to implement the PRMP \nagenda and ensure accountability.35 P&DD will be responsible for delivering a draft policy matrix \nfor subprogram 3 (this will be a second tranche achievement for subprogram 2). \n \n75.  Oversight  Arrangements.  A  high-level  steering  committee  established  under \nsubprogram 1 and chaired by the chief secretary of GOP will continue to provide guidance on \nsubprogram 2.36 The steering committee will convene at least quarterly and major decisions and \nrecommendations will be posted on the PRMP website. The PMU will continue to be the \nsecretariat to the committee. It is expected that GOP will nominate at least one woman to the \nsteering committee. The PMU will also make special efforts to increase the number of female \nprofessional staff for effective tracking of gender equity measures taken during the PRMP-led \nreform process. \n \n76.  Financial  Management  Arrangements.  DFID  conducted  a  Punjab  fiduciary  risk \nassessment in July 2005. The assessment concluded that GOP had developed a program to \nminimize  such  fiduciary  risks  associated  with  (i)  procurement,  (ii) budget  implementation \n(reporting and oversight of expenditure), and (iii) parliamentary accountability with support of \nsubprogram 1 as well as DSP and World Bank-funded education sector support programs. \n                                                 \n33 Implementing agencies are mentioned in terms of assigned responsibilities in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. \n34  http://www.punjab-prmp.gov.pk/ \n35  For focal persons and departmental core teams see, http://www.punjab-prmp.gov.pk/focal.htm \n36  For members of the steering committee, see http://www.punjab-prmp.gov.pk/steering_committee.htm ", "20    \nSubprogram 2 will continue to provide financial management support (Appendix 4). Based on \nthis fiduciary assessment, the financial management arrangements for subprogram 2 are felt to \nbe satisfactory. \n \n77.  Coordination with other Reform Initiatives and Consultations. GOP has formed a \nprovincial coordination office under the chief secretary, which will ensure better coordination \nbetween the various programs and projects funded by development partners in Punjab, a list of \nwhich is provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n78.  Role of the Government. The Government will be the borrower of the program loan and \nwill channel the funds from ADB to GOP. The Government will ensure that adequate information \nis made available to GOP to facilitate implementation of policy measures linked to federal \ninitiatives, such as pension reform, civil service reform, and the MTBF, so as to promote \nconsistency and to integrate approaches where possible. The Government will also support the \nearly  repayment  of  GOP\u2019s  expensive  domestic  loans.  GOP  will  provide  information  on \nimplementation progress to facilitate monitoring of the utilization of the PRMP proceeds by the \nGovernment. \n \n  2.   Implementation Period and Tranching \n \n79.  The completion date for subprogram 2 is 30 June 2007. The PRMP overall program is \nexpected to be fully implemented by 30 June 2008. The loan proceeds will be available for \nwithdrawal  in  two  tranches,  the  $100  million  first  tranche  will  be  available  on  satisfactory \nattainment of agreed achievements upon the date of loan effectiveness or shortly thereafter, \nand the $100 million second tranche upon attainment of agreed achievements expected with 18 \nmonths from loan effectiveness. The closing date for withdrawals is 31 December 2007. \n \n  3.   Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n80.  The  program  loan  will  follow  ADB  standard  procedures  for  procurement  and \ndisbursement. Proceeds of the loan will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost, \nexcluding local duties and taxes, of imports37 produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member \ncountries.  All  procurement  under  the  program  loan  will  be  undertaken  through  normal \ncommercial  practices  for  the  private  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed  procurement \nprocedures acceptable to ADB, with due consideration to economy and efficiency.  \n \n81.  Disbursements  under  the  program  loan  will  be  made  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  simplified \ndisbursement procedures and audit requirements.38 To withdraw the proceeds of the loan, the \nGovernment will certify that the value of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected \ndisbursements under the program loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use \nof loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.  \n  4.   Program Monitoring, Reporting, and Consultations \n82.  To monitor the implementation of subprogram 2, GOP will establish a comprehensive \nmonitoring and evaluation system, which under the policy matrix will be converted into a work \nplan to be broken down into months, with indicators, baselines, and targets. This work planning \nwill be undertaken by the PMU, in consultation with the implementing agencies, and will be an \n                                                 \n37 Eligible imports are total imports minus imports from non-member countries, noneligible imports specified in the list \nof ineligible items, and imports financed already by ADB or other international and bilateral development agencies. \nSee Appendix 6 for the list of ineligible items.  \n38 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements of Program Loans. Manila.  ", "    21 \neffectiveness condition for subprogram 2. Reporting on progress towards reform actions as \nagreed  in  the  work  plan  will  be  monitored  monthly.  The  monthly  progress  review  will  be \nconducted by the chairman of P&DD and the quarterly progress within the PRMP cluster will be \nmonitored by the steering committee. The PMU will prepare a quarterly progress report for the \nsteering committee, which will advise on corrective measures if there are delays. The quarterly \nprogress against the work plan will be shared with the ADB and the PMU will also update the \nproject website regularly.  \n \n83.  In addition to the quarterly progress reports, the PMU will produce an annual report on \nprogram implementation for submission to ADB. ADB will send regular review missions and \nconduct semiannual reviews jointly with GOP to evaluate progress towards the achievements \nand advise GOP on actions required. Details on roles, responsibilities, and time frames\u2014\ntogether with program monitoring and evaluation framework\u2014are described in the program \nadministration memorandum. GOP will prepare a midyear report on its budget performance not \nlater  than  28  February  of  each  year  to  identify  corrective  measures  if  required  under  the \nmedium-term fiscal framework. ADB will help GOP to strengthen the proposed subprogram 3 \nand to ensure that it reflects lessons learned from the implementation of earlier subprograms \nand changes in the external environment.  \n \n84.  The reform process will involve periodic consultations with officials from NGOs, public \naccess  to  information  (on  proposed  reforms  and  implementation  progress),  systematic \nconsultation with civil society organizations, establishment of special purpose forums (such as \nthe  Punjab  Development  Forums),  and  arrangements  for  third  party  validation  of  selected \nreform outcomes. Such public consultations will be incorporated into the subprogram 2 work \nplan and summarized in the progress reports. \n5.   Sustainability \n85.  PRMP has already helped to bring about significant reforms in development planning \nand resource management systems in Punjab. GOP has taken significant steps in this regard, \ninitiating important reforms including the introduction of an MTBF, taxation reforms, reforms of \nthe procurement of goods and services, improvements to the planning and approval process for \ndevelopment projects with a poverty focus, and the approval of a new industrial policy that \naddresses many of the concerns of the private sector. Under subprogram 1, initial steps to \nincrease the pro-business orientation of legal instruments and to reduce bureaucratic discretion \nhave already improved the business climate. Subprogram 2 will build on and support GOP to \nimplement an essentially homegrown reform agenda. Given GOP\u2019s strong sense of ownership \nof  the  reform  process,  the  prospects  for  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  PRMP\u2019s \nachievements are good.   \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nA.  TA Loan and Cofinanced TA Grant  \n \n86.  TA for the PRMP. The reform agenda of subprogram 1 was supported by a TA grant to \nbuild capacity for poverty reduction and resource management in Punjab, approved in 2002,39 \nand by a TA loan in 2003.40 Further TA to prepare subprogram 2 was approved in 2004.41 \n                                                 \n39 ADB. 2002.

", "22    \nCompletion of the TA loan was planned for the end of 2005, but implementation has taken \nlonger than expected and the TA loan duration will be extended throughout the life of the PRMP.  \n \n87.  TA Loan Review. During the preparation of subprogram 2, a TA loan review42 was \nconducted to (i) assess the status of contracts under existing TA; (ii) review the needs of various \nimplementing agencies; (iii) facilitate discussions to revise components of the TA loan in light of \nthe policy commitments under subprogram 2; (iv) assess the capacity needs of the executing \nagency and the PMU so that these are reflected and costed in the revised TA loan structure; \nand (v) consult DFID officials to harmonize ADB and DFID TA to GOP.  \n \n88.  Refinement of the TA Loan Components. The revised components of the TA loan  \n(Supplementary Appendix 7 and Appendix 8) are (i) capacity development interventions to \nconsolidate reforms under subprogram 1 and to facilitate subprogram 2 policy agenda; (ii) \nsupport for change management within GOP and technical support for operations and policy \ndialogue on civil service reforms; (iii) project implementation support to bolster PMU capacity, \nwhich has been a constraint on effective implementation of the TA; and (iv) special reform \ninitiatives  that  comprise  the  ongoing  TA  packages  and  special  interventions  identified  by \nimplementing agencies. \n \n89.  Revised Procedures to Engage Consultants. Since the beginning of the TA, the \nquality- and cost-based selection method was relied upon to the exclusion of all other methods \nto  engage  consultants.  No  individual  consultants  were  selected  for  any  of  the  studies  or \nassignments. It has been agreed with the Government that the protocols developed under the \nDSP  will  be  used  to accommodate  the  needs  of  the  implementing  agencies and  that  the \nconsultant selection process will be revised.  \n \n90.  DFID TA Grant. DFID will provide parallel and tied cofinancing through a TA grant to \ncomplement the TA loan project under PRMP. DFID assistance will support GOP to implement \nand deepen reforms under PRMP. DFID will support (i) fiscal and financial management; (ii) \npoverty-focused planning; (iii) procurement reforms; (iv) international technical advice for civil \nservice reforms; and (v) an enabling environment for private sector development.  \n \n91.  ADB TA resources will therefore be used to assist the executing agency for PRMP \nimplementation and for capacity development, while DFID TA resources will fund studies and \nsurveys, and provide short- and long-term international expertise in the areas noted above. \n \n92.  Implementation Arrangements for the ADB\u2013DFID TA Project. The executing agency \nfor the TA Project will continue to be the P&DD. The ADB-financed TA loan will be supported by \nother  line  departments,  in  particular  the  Finance  Department,  which  will  remain  the  key \nimplementing  agency.  P&DD,  through  the  PMU,  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the \nimplementing agencies and for the timely implementation of the TA. The DFID TA will also be \nchanneled  through  the  P&DD  and  a  subcommittee  within  the  P&DD  will  oversee  its \nimplementation. DFID support to GOP will be facilitated by an international firm that will liaise \nclosely with the PMU  and all implementing agencies. The firm will ensure that the DFID-\nfinanced TA is harmonized with the ADB TA Loan.      \n \n93.  TA Loan Implementation. An annual work plan will be prepared by the PMU for the TA \nproject. All work plans other than the first one will include the DFID TA outcomes during the year \n                                                                                                                                                          \n41 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Support for Subprogram 2 of the Punjab \nResource Management Program. Manila. \n42 The full report of the Technical Assistance Review is in Supplementary Appendix 7.   ", "    23 \nto ensure that there will be no overlap. An executive committee of the steering committee will be \nconstituted. This will consist of key implementing agencies and will be chaired by the chairman \nof P&DD. The executive committee will review progress every month and approve new capacity \ndevelopment and special reform initiatives. Every quarter, PRMP implementing agencies will \nidentify areas requiring technical support and the PMU will provide expertise to draft terms of \nreference for capacity development activities and projects. The terms of reference and cost of \nthe  capacity  development  and  special  reform  initiatives  will  be  submitted  to  the  PMU  for \nclearance and then to the P&DD chairman for approval. ADB and the steering committee will be \nupdated through quarterly progress meetings. P&DD will process the revisions and seek the \napproval of the federal executive committee of the national economic council before December \n2005. GOP has agreed to the following: (i) the PRMP steering committee will meet every \nquarter; (ii) the executive committee of the steering committee headed by the chairman of \nP&DD will review progress at least every month and take decisions for timely and efficient \nprocurement; (iii) the cabinet committee formed to review progress under subprogram 1 will be \nrevived, it will meet twice a year; and (iv) a procurement cell will be established within the PMU \nto be financed by ADB TA grant resources to give support to the executing and implementing \nagencies in engaging consultants. \n \nB.  Proposed TA Grant for Support for Subprogram 3 of Punjab  \n \n94.  The purpose of the TA grant is to enable GOP to prepare subprogram 3. The TA will \nfocus  on:  (i)  fiscal  and  financial  management,  (ii)  civil  service  reforms,  (iii)  private  sector \ndevelopment, and (iv) reform management and policy dialogue. The overall output of the TA will \nstrengthen the capacities of the P&DD and key implementing agencies for the preparation of \nsubprogram 3, taking account of lessons learned during subprogram 2.  \n \n95.  The total cost of the TA including contingencies is estimated to be $187,500 equivalent. \nADB will finance $150,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program to \ncover the entire foreign exchange cost and part of the local currency cost, mainly for domestic \nconsultants. GOP\u2019s contribution will be $37,500, 20% of the total (Appendix 7). \n \n96.  The TA will require 3 person-months of international and 20 person-months of national \nconsulting services. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 7. All \nconsultants will be recruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants using arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n97.  Subprogram 2 is expected to yield significant benefits by supporting a comprehensive \nchange in public service delivery. Sustainable pro-poor public service delivery will be derived from \n(i) actions that improve fiscal discipline and allow more spending on high-priority poverty reduction \nmeasures; (ii) better governance mechanisms, institutional arrangements, and accountability for \nexpenditure  management  and  service  delivery;  and  (iii)  an  environment  that  offers  more \nopportunities for growth, employment, and income generation. Identifiable  benefits  will  accrue \nover the medium term in line with the outcomes detailed in the program framework and policy \nmatrix.  Subprogram  2  will  have  specific  and  immediate  impacts  on  fiscal  restructuring  and \nutilization of loan proceeds to capitalize the pension and General Provident Funds. Subprogram 2 \nwill help the provincial civil service to become more responsive to the needs of the population.  \n ", "24    \n98.  GOP has commenced reforms by preparing an MTBF, reforming taxation, improving \nprocurement procedures, and approving a new industrial policy that addresses many of the \nconcerns of the private sector. Initial steps to make orientation of the legal instruments under \nsubprogram 1 more pro-business have already improved the business climate. With the current \npace of reforms and the long-term commitment of GOP, sustainability is embedded in the \nreform process.  \n \nB.  Impacts \n99.  Subprogram 2 is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction by facilitating a \nshift toward more social sector spending (Appendix 9). The impact on labor markets, prices, net \npublic transfers, and access to public goods and services is expected to be positive in the long \nterm. There are no significant adverse impacts directly associated with Subprogram 2, although \nsome adjustment may take place in the provincial civil service. It is expected that basic labor \nrights of affected employees will be protected. Subprogram 2 will reduce the gender bias in \npublic sector employment and will contribute to achieving the goals of Punjab\u2019s PRS paper.  A \nreview of the environment implications was undertaken and no adverse environmental impacts \nwere identified. Subprogram 2 will neither lead to any involuntary resettlement measures nor will \nit have any impact on indigenous people.  \n \nC.  Risks \n100.  The realization of these benefits and impacts will depend on a number of assumptions \nthat are subject to a variety of risks. Mitigating measures have been integrated into the design of \nsubprogram 2, taking into account lessons learned from subprogram 1. \n \n101.  Political Risks. Political risks in Punjab remain comparatively low. The elections in \nOctober 2002 gave a clear majority to the party most closely associated with the administration \nthat initiated Pakistan\u2019s reform agenda. The Government and GOP remain strongly committed \nto the PRMP. However, political risks may evolve if macroeconomic achievements do not trickle \ndown to the majority of voters. \n \n102.  Governance.  Subprogram  2  aims  to  reduce  abuses  of  power  and  rent-seeking \nopportunities. Reforms could be undermined or delayed by vested interests that stand to lose \nfrom  greater  transparency  and  accountability.  However,  strong  ownership  and  support  for \nsubprogram 2 at the highest political and bureaucratic levels mitigates this risk. A new CMU \nunder the chief secretary of Punjab will be established to encourage more stakeholders within \nthe civil service to participate and contribute to policy reforms. The Punjab Development Forum \nthat began under subprogram 1 has institutionalized broad-based stakeholder participation and \nhas also become an effective oversight mechanism. In addition, subprogram 2 design has been \nled and defined by GOP. Subprogram 2 interventions for civil service reforms are also expected \nto generate proactive support for reforms from the civil servants.  \n \n103.  Implementation  Risks.  Subprogram  2  implementation  demands  considerable \ninstitutional capacity. Insufficient capacity within GOP to handle the envisaged reforms could \nimpede implementation. The ongoing TA loan that started under subprogram 1 will be made \nflexible to help the PMU and departments to overcome capacity limitations. Emphasis will be \ngiven to strengthening the strategic planning process and to managing change to successfully \nimplement the PRMP reforms. In addition, subprogram 2 expects the PMU to play a proactive \nrole in facilitating implementation, monitoring results, and generating ideas.  \n ", "    25 \n104.  Macroeconomic and Exogenous Risks. Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic indicators have \nbeen strong over the past 3 years. However, while structural reforms are beginning to show \npositive  results,  poverty  levels  remain  high  and  must  be  reduced.  The  rising  cost  of  oil, \ninsecurity  in  the  region,  and  the  cost  of  earthquake  reconstruction  accentuate  the \nmacroeconomic risks. While some of the risks are beyond the control of the Government and \nGOP, prudent and consistent economic management strategy can mitigate macroeconomic \nvulnerability. Significant increase in the allocations for social sector and direct poverty reduction \nmeasures  along  with  effective  social  service  delivery  will  lead  to  higher  poverty  reduction \nimpact. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n105.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  GOP  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Usage of loan proceeds. GOP will ensure that the fiscal space generated out of \nthe retirement of cash development loans will be used for increased spending in \nhigh priority areas for poverty reduction as outlined in the Punjab PRS paper. \n \n(ii)  Transparency and anticorruption measures. The Government and GOP each \nacknowledge that ADB, consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  reserves  the  right  to  undertake,  directly  or \nthrough  its  agents,  investigation  of  any  possible  financial  or  management \nimpropriety in the conduct of subprogram 2. The Government and GOP will \ncooperate fully and ensure that each of the Punjab\u2019s agencies cooperates with \nany such investigation and extends all necessary assistance, including access to \nrelevant books and records. \n \n(iii)  Support for Punjab\u2019s GRAP. GOP will provide continued policy and financial \nsupport  for  successful  implementation  of  GRAP.  GOP  will  take  proactive \nmeasures  to  (a)  strengthen  the  Women\u2019s  Development  Department  at  the \nprovincial and district level; (b) implement cost-neutral reforms, such as reforms \nto increase women\u2019s employment in the public sector, and budgetary reforms; (c) \nprovide required budget allocations under revenue and development budget as \noutlined  in  the  GRAP;  and  (d)  establish  incentive  grants  for  women\u2019s \ndevelopment under PFC, as approved under the GRAP.  \n \n(iv)  Gender considerations in reforms. The CMU will ensure to include gender \nconsiderations in all proposed reforms. \n \n(v)  TA. GOP  will ensure that in carrying out the policy measures and activities \nincluded under PRMP and the policy matrix, due consideration will be given to \nthe findings and recommendations of the TA project loan and TA grants. GOP \nwill allow ADB to provide comments on the findings and recommendations of the \nTAs, for consideration in policy measures for this and upcoming programs in \nPunjab.  The  GOP  will  make  adequate  funding  provision  for  timely  TA \nimplementation. \n \n(vi)  DFID cofinancing. In case the cofinancing from DFID can not be obtained at the \nlatest by 28 February 2006, the Government and ADB will take all necessary and \nappropriate steps to make other arrangements to cover the shortfall. ", "26    \n(vii)  Coordination  of  reforms.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate \ninformation is made available to GOP to facilitate consistency of fiscal projections \nwith the federal government. The Government will continue to improve the MTBF \non the national level, including NFC projections, and work with the provincial \ngovernment toward an integrated national MTBF. GOP will coordinate reform \nmeasures  with  initiatives  at  the  federal  level  to  ensure  consistency  in \napproaches, including its reforms in the civil service and its reforms in pensions. \n \n(viii)  Environmental and safety standards. The Housing and Urban Development \nDepartment will ensure that the zoning and building regulations to be developed \nunder the Program will include environmental and safety standards.  \n \n(ix)  Consultative  action  plan  to  foster  PSO  reforms.  The  policy  on  the \nprivatization/liquidation/restructuring of provincial PSOs will include a policy and \naction  plan  for  employees  in  such  PSOs,  developed  in  consultation  with \nrepresentatives of employees of PSOs. \n \n(x)  Communication strategy. Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, P&DD will \ndevelop a communication strategy and a media plan to provide regular and \ntargeted information on PRMP policy reforms. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n106.  The following conditions will be met before the loan becomes effective: \n \n(i)  All tranche 2 conditions under subprogram 1 will have been fully complied with. \n  \n(ii)  The TA loan period will have been extended to 30 June 2008 to cover the entire \nprogram period. The revised and expanded list of activities to be financed under \nthe  TA  loan  will  have  been  presented  and  mutually  agreed  with  ADB.  The \nPlanning Commission pro forma II for the TA loan project will have been revised \nand approved by the provincial development working party.  \n \n(iv)  The PMU will have finalized a time-bound work plan, including indicators and \ntargets, to monitor the progress of the implementation of subprogram 2.  \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n107.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan of $200,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 2 of the \nPunjab Resource Management Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 15 years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Program Agreements presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nJoseph B.

Punjab\u2019s Socioeconomic Performance  \n \n1.  Punjab had a total population of about 74 million in 1998 (the year of the last census), \nwhich is more than half the national total, and an estimated1 provincial gross domestic product \n(GDP) of about 57% of the national total. The GDP growth of the country is significantly \ndetermined by Punjab\u2019s performance. In the recent national recovery, Punjab has been leading \nthe  country.  Throughout  the  1990s,  Punjab\u2019s  real  GDP  grew  by  4.5%  per  annum,  while \nPakistan\u2019s growth was 4.1% per annum. As Punjab\u2019s population grew by about 2.4% per \nannum, per capita income increased by about 2.1% per annum over the 1990s. This increase \nhas not been shared equally. As a result, despite the relatively good economic performance of \nPunjab, it still houses most of the country\u2019s poor.  \n \n2.  The agriculture sector contributes about 27% of provincial GDP, industry 22.5%, and \nservices 50.5%.2 The share of agriculture in Punjab\u2019s GDP is slightly higher than its share in the \nnational GDP, while the share of industry is slightly lower. This is not surprising, given that \nPunjab has one of the largest canal networks in the world and a very fertile and deep top soil \ncover.  \n \n3.  Given the stable macroeconomic environment, and the \u201cfiscal space\u201d available at the \nnational level, Punjab has a good opportunity to ensure that it moves on a path of sustainable \ngrowth by ensuring suitable policy and institutional reforms. The Punjab Economic Report notes \nthat: \u201cThe Government of the Punjab (GOP) has indicated the main elements of its economic \nstrategy.  This  rests  on  five  pillars:  (i)  improving  governance;  (ii)  strengthening  fiscal  and \nfinancial structures; (iii) creating a more supportive environment for private sector-led growth; \n(iv)  reforming  the  delivery  of  public services;  and  (v)  addressing  the  provincial  economy\u2019s \nvulnerability to shocks.\u201d3 The Punjab Resource Management Program Subprogram1 allowed \nthe GOP to move on some of these elements. Subprogram 2 will build on the reform foundation \nlaid by subprogram 1.  \n \n1.  Agriculture \n \n4.  Agriculture provides 28% of Punjab\u2019s output and 40% of its employment. Punjab has a \ngrain surplus and helps feed other provinces. It also earns significant foreign exchange through \nrice and cotton exports. Agriculture is also the main feeder for the largest industry in the country: \ntextiles. However, over the last decade and a half, employment in agriculture has been falling, \nand growth rates, although positive, have been in the 4\u20135% range. The green revolution of the \n1960s  increased  inputs  through  the  use  of  high-yield  variety  seeds,  better  fertilizer,  and \npesticides. These measures have been adopted in over 80% of the irrigated land. Nevertheless, \nthe sector is still characterized by low productivity in terms of efficiency of use of resources and \ninputs. Yields in Punjab (and in Pakistan as a whole) continue to be well below the potential \nassessed values.  \n \n5.  A major challenge for GOP over the next few years will be the introduction of the private \nsector in agricultural marketing, storage, transportation, grading, packaging, and export areas. \n                                                 \n1  Estimates and estimation methodology are given in:  Government of the Punjab, World Bank, Asian Development \nBank, Department for International Development of the United Kingdom. 2005. Punjab Economic Report. Towards \na Medium-Term Development Strategy. Lahore.  \n2  Footnote 1, p.  2. \n3  Footnote 1. p. 1. ", "  Appendix 2      33 \nTraditionally, these areas have been either monopolized by the state or very heavily regulated. \nGOP opened these areas to the private sector a few years ago, but the pace of reform has been \nslow and uneven. Subprogram 2 has identified some agricultural subsectors where the GOP \nneeds to move quickly to provide the right regulatory environment for private sector entry. \n \n2.  Industry and Non-Farm Sectors \n \n6.  Almost nine  out of 10 people employed in Punjab work in the private sector. Private \nsector development is the only way the province can ensure job creation, development, and \npoverty  reduction.  The  non-farm  sectors  (manufacturing,  construction,  wholesale  and  retail \ntrade, and transport and other services) contributed around two thirds of the total provincial \nGDP in 2003. While, in percentage terms, agricultural employment has declined in Punjab, \nemployment in industry increased by 1.7 million and in services by 2.3 million during the 1990s. \nCombined, these sectors now employ more people than the agriculture sector. Punjab has the \nlargest number of the country\u2019s small and medium-sized enterprises. Since most employment in \nthe private sector is in microenterprises in Punjab (as in the remaining parts of the country), the \nstrategy for the non-agriculture sector has to ensure that special attention is paid to small and \nmedium-sized enterprises. The GOP has already taken a few steps in this direction, some under \nsubprogram 1, and more will be identified in subprogram 2.  \n \n7.  Punjab contains some of the fastest growing urban areas of the country. Lahore, the \nprovincial capital, is a prime destination for investment and in-country migration. Faisalabad, \nGujrat, Gunranwala, Rawalpindi, Sahiwal, Sheikhupura, and Sialkot are also growing rapidly. As \na result, there is significant potential for job creation and growth in urban development and \nconstruction.  However,  this  needs  to  be  tapped  and  the  province  has  to  incentivize  the \ndevelopment of urban areas to ensure optimal growth. The current regulatory structures, rules \nand  laws  pertaining  to  buildings,  urban  property  taxes,  and  other  areas  related  to  urban \ndevelopment are outdated and sometimes archaic. These need to be streamlined to bring them \nin line with the existing and future requirements. \n \n8.  Given current macroeconomic stability, the province has a good window of opportunity to \ncapitalize on developing some of its potential in non-farm related areas, such as manufacturing, \nconstruction, and services. Punjab will need to prioritize the development of the private sector in \nthese areas. Subprogram 2 will identify the need for reforms in (i) public\u2013private partnerships, \n(ii) private sector development, (iii) the regulatory framework for urban development, and (iv) the \nregulatory framework for urban land transfers and titling. Some of these issues need to be taken \nup with the federal government. The reforms identified under subprogram 2 will only pertain to \nareas within the domain of GOP.  \n  \n3.  Social Sectors in Punjab \n \n9.  Pakistan ranks 142nd in the human development index out of a total of 177 countries.4 \nOn some of the more specialized indices, like the health or corruption index, Pakistan fares \neven more poorly. In the social sector, Punjab ranks fairly well compared to other provinces, but \ncompared to the social sectors in other developing countries its performance is not good.  \n10.  The social sectors are closely tied to the quality of life of citizens. Much more investment \nis needed if Pakistan is to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Since one of the \n                                                 \n4  Pakistan ranks 142 out of 177 countries in the Human Development Index. Its low ranking compared to other \ncountries with similar level of income indicates the low priority that social sectors have historically received. See \nMahbub ul Haq Human Development Centre. 2004. Human Development in South Asia 2004. Karachi. ", " 34  Appendix 2 \nmain  aims  of  subprogram2  is  poverty  reduction  and  facilitating  rapid  progress  towards \nachievement of the MDGs, social sector monitoring in essential. When subprogram 1 was \ndesigned and implemented, Punjab lacked some basic social statistics. The following analysis is \nbased on the multiple indicator cluster survey, 2003-04, conducted by GOP, in collaboration \nwith the federal government and the United Nations International Children Fund.   \n \n11.  Literacy and Education. In education, Punjab is faring better than other provinces. \nHowever, the literacy rate is only 54%, and net enrollment ratios for primary, middle, and \nsecondary level are low. Gender differences continue to be fairly significant in Punjab, (except \nfor middle schools) and there are significant variations between districts, where literacy rates \nrange from 80% to 40%. The federal and provincial governments have increased allocations for \neducation  and  the  Punjab  education  sector  reform  program  is  already  being  successfully \nimplemented. New enrollments and awareness of education have increased. \n \n12.  The private sector has expanded rapidly. According to one estimate, some 30% of \nchildren attending schools in Punjab now go to private sector.5 It has also been shown in some \nsurveys that private schools, even those with fees comparable with those in the public sector, \ndeliver better education than their public counterparts.6 This does not imply that there is no role \nfor public schools. On the contrary, the public sector can provide funding for schooling, while the \nmanagement and provision of schooling can be organized in several ways. Subprogram 2 will \nidentify  ways  in  which the  education  sector  can  be  further  strengthened.  This will  include \nproviding a better framework for public\u2013private partnerships, encouraging GOP to pilot options \nto assess their feasibility, and strengthening policy-making at the provincial level.   \n \n13.  Health. As in education, Punjab\u2019s performance compares well with that of the rest of the \ncountry. However, the data is not impressive and demonstrate the relative neglect of the sector. \nThere are very significant differences between districts. Only 33% of births are attended by a \nskilled health worker, and in some districts the percentage is as low as 7%. Contraceptive \nprevalence is low everywhere. Under-5 mortality is higher in Punjab than in other provinces and \noral rehydration therapy usage is lower. About 34% of children in Punjab are not covered by \nimmunization services, and in the worst performing district this increases to 81%.  \n \n14.  If the province is going to achieve the health-related MDGs, it clearly has to (i) accord \nthe health sector a higher priority, (ii) increase expenditure on the sector, (iii) find ways of \nextending  the  service  to  more  people,  and  (iv)  ensure  better  quality  of  health  services. \nSubprogram 2 will address some of these objectives, especially by facilitating the entry of \nprivate sector in provision, quality assurance, and third party monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n15.  Water and Sanitation. Data in this sector is not very reliable. Multiple indicator cluster \nsurvey data report that 97% of Punjab has access to improved drinking water, but in 2005, even \nLahore, the provincial capital and the largest city of the province, experienced several disease \noutbreaks caused by contaminated water. Although the population has fairly good access to \ndrinking water sources, the same is not true for sanitation. Solid waste management is clearly \nunderprovided,  and  sanitation  coverage  is  low.  There  are  significant  differences  between \ndistricts.  Water  and  waste  management  has  traditionally  been  a  state-provided  area,  and \ncontinues to be so. Subprogram 2 will introduce legal and institutional mechanisms to allow \n                                                 \n5  Federal Bureau of Statistics, Government of Pakistan. 2005.

Social  Sectors,  Devolution,  and  Punjab  Resource  Management  Program.  The \nprovision of education up to secondary level; primary and tertiary health care; and water and \nsanitation have been devolved to the districts. In fact, water and sanitation provision has been \ndevolved to the tehsil level.7 However, the province retains the power to formulate policy, set the \nregulatory framework, and to plan and implement vertical programs for these sectors. There are \na number of federal vertical programs especially in health. Subprogram 2 cannot bind the \ndistricts or tehsils since it has been negotiated exclusively with the province. Hence, it restricts \nitself to suggesting policy reforms in those areas that are within the mandate of the provincial \ngovernment, particularly introducing the private sector in construction of facilities, provision of \nservices, quality monitoring and evaluation, and third party verifications.  \n \n4.  The Employment and Growth Challenge \n \n17.  The labor force of Punjab was estimated at about 27 million in 2002.8 About 70% was \nrural, 80% male, and 60% self-employed. The public sector employed only about 11% of the \nlabor force (however, 18% of urban female workers are employed by the public sector). The \nprivate sector, including the informal sector, provides most of the employment in Punjab. The \nPunjab Economic Report states that almost 86% of workers are employed in microenterprises \nemploying fewer than five workers. During the past decade, there has been a significant drop in \nthe percentage of the workforce employed in agriculture (from 51.1% to 42.8%). Meanwhile, \nthere have been increases in manufacturing (11.3% to 15.7%), community and social services \n(13.2% to 14.8%), wholesale and retail trade (12.1% to 14.1%), and transport, storage and \ncommunication (4.5% to 5.4%) sectors. This is in line with literature on employment transitions \nassociated with economic development.  \n \n18.  Real Earnings of Labor Declined Over the Latter Part of the 1990s. The biggest \ndecline in real earnings was in wages for casual labor. There is some evidence of increasing \nreliance on casual and contract labor even in most formal sectors, which has increased the \nuncertainty of income for laborers. Recent economic growth has meant some gains in wages, \nbut for this to be sustained better jobs need to be created and there need to be significant \nincreases in productivity in most sectors. The labor force in Punjab will continue to grow at \nabout  3%  per  annum  for  the  next  decade  until  it  reaches  about  36  million  by  2011\u201312. \nAccording  to  various  government  labor  force  surveys,  unemployment  in  the  province  has \nincreased over the past 15 years. The unemployment rate was around 3% in 1984\u201385, and it \nhad reached 8.5% by 2001\u201302 (about 2.3 million people). Although the recent recovery has led \nto a slight decrease to 7.4% (labor force survey, 2003\u201304), about 10 million new productive and \nwell-paying jobs need to be created by 2011\u201312.  \n \n5.  The Poverty Challenge \n \n19.  As  with  Pakistan,  poverty  in  Punjab  declined  rapidly  in  the  1980s  but  increased \nsignificantly in the 1990s. By 2002, poverty had increased to 34.1% (compared with the national \nestimate of 37.1%) and incidence was much higher in rural areas. Of people living in rural \nareas, 37% fall below the poverty line (the national figure is 41.6%), while only 27% of urban \nPunjabis fall below the poverty line (the national figure is 26.4%). \n                                                 \n7  Tehsil is a sub-district in Pakistan. \n8  All figures in this section are from the Punjab Economic Report (footnote 1). ", " 36  Appendix 2 \n20.  Punjab can be divided into three regions: north, central, and south.9 Although the overall \npoverty level in the province was 34.1% in 2001\u201302, it was 29.8% in the north region, 31.8% in \ncentral, and 40.4% in south. For rural poverty, the figures were 37% overall; 33.8%, south; \n35.3%, central; and 40.8%, south. For urban areas, figures were 27.4% overall; 20.1%, north; \n24.6%, central; and 38.7%, south. Not only is the south poorer, its socioeconomic indicators \n(urbanization, literacy, health, infrastructure, and development of industry) are worse. Any anti-\npoverty strategy must take these regional disparities into account.  \n \nB.   Institutional Framework and Government Responsibilities  \n \n21.  Constitutional Provisions. The allocation of responsibilities between the federal and \nprovincial governments is specified in the Fourth Schedule (under Article 4) of the Constitution \nof Pakistan of 1973. The Federal Legislative List sets out the functions to be performed by the \nGovernment, while the Concurrent List delineates the functions that can be performed either by \nthe federal or the provincial governments. In the event of any conflict between the legislation of \nthe two tiers of government, that of the federal government prevails. Residual functions, not \nenumerated in either list, are the responsibility of the provinces.  \n \n22.  Federal Government Functions. According to the Federal Legislative List, the federal \ngovernment is responsible for regulatory as well as service functions. In addition, the federal \ngovernment is currently performing several functions specified in the Concurrent List.10 The \n \nweak  financial  position  of  provincial  governments  and  their  overwhelming  dependence  on \nfederal grants and transfers greatly dilutes their ability to perform several of the functions in the \nConcurrent List. \n \n23.  Provincial  Government  Functions.  Functions  not  mentioned  in  either  the  Federal \nLegislative List or the Concurrent List are the responsibility of the provincial governments. \nProvinces  have  sole  responsibility  for  law  and  order,  justice,  provincial  highways,  urban \ntransport, secondary and university education, agriculture extension and provision of inputs, \nirrigation and land reclamation, industries, and mineral resources. The provinces undertake \nsome of the functions in the Concurrent List, including social welfare, labor exchanges, training \nestablishments, and management of historical monuments and sites. \n   \n24.  Local  Government  Functions  and  Decentralization  Reforms.  Punjab  Local \nGovernment Ordinance (PLGO), 2001, provides the basic political and administrative framework \nfor local government. District governments are responsible for schools, colleges, and district \nhealth  services;  and  tehsil  municipal  administrations  (TMAs)  for  water  supply  and  waste \ndisposal, in coordination with union administrations. District governments are independent local \ngovernments, while TMAs and union administrations are autonomous corporate bodies. These \nnew responsibilities require changes in the provincial structures for these services and will entail \na transfer of human and financial resources from the province to local governments. Given the \ncomplexity  of  the  task,  the  transfer  of  powers  is  taking  place.  The  role  of  provincial  line \ndepartments in policy making, regulation, standard setting, quality control, and monitoring has \nstill not been brought in to conformity with local government legislation.  \n \n                                                 \n9 The division is not only historical, but it can also be justified on the basis of socioeconomic and geographic \ncharacteristics of the regions. \n10 This  includes  population  planning  and  social  welfare;  labor  exchanges;  training  establishments;  electricity; \nconservation of ancient and historical monuments and sites; curriculum, syllabus planning, running centers of \nexcellence, and standards of education; and tourism. \n ", "  Appendix 2      37 \n25.  The local government system is based on the premise that if locally managed basic \nservices will be more responsive to local needs and service delivery will improve. During the first \n4  years  since  the  PLGO  came  into  force,  service  delivery  showed  signs  of  improvement, \nalthough there were great variations among districts. The district government budget barely \ncovers the fixed expenses for operating the services transferred to them. District governments \nhave little control over provincial staff and staff transfers. There have been no allocations to the \nnew local governments from the provincial development budget. Despite problems with the \nrelease of funds and procedural constraints, local governments\u2019 use of the fund available to \nthem has been satisfactory in most cases. However, very little capacity-building has been \nundertaken and most has been at the district government level. TMAs and union administrations \nhave  received  little  attention.  Under  the  Asian  Development  Bank-funded  Decentralization \nSupport  Program11  and  other  external  assistance,  efforts  are  being  made  to  improve  the \ncapacity of local governments, particularly  to improve financial management and audits of \nexpenditures. The accountant general\u2019s office is preparing appropriation accounts for the district \ngovernments. \n \nC.  Civil Service  \n \n26.  The civil service in Pakistan used to consist of federal, provincial, and local council \nservices. Devolution reform has created a third tier of government at the local level12 but \nbudgetary and administrative controls mean that personnel management remains a provincial \nfunction.  Federal  government  officers  hold  key  positions  at  provincial  and  district  levels \n(provincial government staff also hold posts in district governments). The dominant feature of \ncivil service is centralization of personnel management and control functions. Accountability \nstructures are weak and political interference is rife.  \n \n27.  Under  an  amendment  to  the  PLGO,  the  provincial  government  is  committed  to \nadministratively realign its departments according to a structure outlined in the devolution plan \nby 31 December 2005. In addition, the amended PLGO calls for the creation of a district service \nand district and tehsil cadres by the same date. The purpose of the amendments is to relocate \nthe  main  accountability  for  service  delivery  to  the  districts  and  to  empower  the  district \ngovernments with the necessary authority to ensure that services are delivered. This is a \nsubstantial and complex task and involves reviewing and reorganizing the civil service at all \nthree levels of government. The review of the entire staffing needs at the local level will have to \nbe followed up with the establishment of a legal basis for new district service and cadres, \nincluding new arrangements for appointments, promotions, and transfers, in addition to ensuring \nthe flow of financial and other resources to implement this undertaking. Federal and provincial \ninputs  into  district  service  delivery  management  will  need  to  be  rationalized  and  incentive \nstructures put in place to attract the talent needed to manage the district level assignments. An \nappropriate mix of career and contract positions will have to be determined.  \n \n28.  Federal and provincial initiatives demonstrate enthusiasm for civil service reforms. A civil \nservice reform unit to steer civil service reform has been established. GOP is focusing on the \ncapacity building of its civil service through its management and professional development \ndepartment. The World Bank is helping the federal government to develop a vision for civil \nservice reform and to build the capacity of mid-career and senior public sector managers.

Manila. \n12  The local councils which existed before devolution did not have civil servants or the same functions as required \nunder Punjab Local Government Ordinance. Most employees they had, at the lower level, are now tehsil municipal \nadministration staff. ", " 38  Appendix 2 \nsuccess of this initiative depends on an objective assessment of the situation, involving the \nstakeholders. Realistic solutions must be developed and, most importantly, political commitment \nthrough matching resource allocations will need to be demonstrated. \n \nD.  Fiscal Restructuring and Financial Management \n29.  Fiscal restructuring in order to increase development spending is the basis for improved \npublic resource management. Punjab\u2019s public finances have continued to suffer from structural \nrigidities  that  have  steadily  eroded  its  fiscal  base,  and  contributed  to  inadequate  service \ndelivery. The issues that have particularly affected public finances and financial management \ninclude inflexibility of expenditures, overstaffing, overextension of the governmental mandate, \nvertical revenue-expenditure imbalances, inadequate fiscal transparency and weak monitoring, \npoorly functioning internal controls, weak accounting mechanisms, and delays in recording \ntransactions. In particular, the weak monitoring of budgets has eroded their usefulness as \ninstruments for implementing and updating government policies.  \n \n30.  Volatility  of  Transfers  from  the  Federal  Divisible  Pool.  The  National  Finance \nCommission  (NFC)  award  of  1997  rendered  provinces  more  vulnerable  to  fluctuations  in \nresource transfers. Previous NFC awards had given provincial governments disproportionate \nshares of the more buoyant federal taxes, including customs and excise. The 1997 award, \nhowever, shifted to a system that shares federal taxes among provinces equally through a \nsingle divisible pool. Moreover, federal fiscal reforms reduced the collection of key taxes such \nas customs tariffs and income tax, thereby reducing the size of the divisible pool. At the same \ntime, the monthly transfers to the provinces were linked to actual tax receipts of federal taxes in \nthe previous month, making provincial governments vulnerable to seasonal fluctuations. Added \nto this uncertainty is the federal government\u2019s consistent overestimation of revenues. A new \nNFC award is expected to become effective in 2006, with a 48% share of the divisible pool for \nthe provinces. Shared tax transfers (from the divisible pool) account for 75\u201380% of total federal \ntransfers to Punjab, with the remainder consisting of other direct transfers, loans, and grants. \n \n31.  The volatility of transfers from the divisible pool has also made provincial revenue and \nexpenditure  estimates  unrealistic.  Consequently,  there  has  been  a  build  up  of  federal \ngovernment liabilities, with provincial governments lacking the funds to meet even their fiduciary \nobligations. All these developments have led to fiscal stress at federal and provincial levels.  \n \n32.  Given that most expenditure commitments of the provincial governments are for fixed \ncosts such as salaries and pensions, the seasonal fluctuations in resource transfers have had \nimplications for expenditure management and have led to GOP having to arrange overdrafts \nfrom the State Bank of Pakistan. The overall budgetary deficits of GOP have therefore only \nbeen financed by building up arrears and by using off-budget funds held in a fiduciary capacity \nand reflected in the movement of the Public Fund Account. The outcome is the uncovered gap \nbetween the amount set by GOP to discharge its obligations in respect of the General Provident \nFund and the actual liability on this account.  \n33.  Resource  Mobilization.  GOP  currently  collects  about  27%  of  the  total  receipts  it \nutilizes, with the remainder coming from federal transfers and grants. Of the taxes collected by \nGOP, 35% are direct and 65% indirect. The most important are duties on stamps (indirect), \nrepresenting  29.2%  of  the  taxes  raised  by  GOP;  motor  vehicle  tax  (indirect),  16%;  urban \nimmovable property tax (direct), 15.6%; land revenue, 13.2%; sales tax on services (indirect), \n6.8%; and electricity duty (indirect), 6.3%; and agricultural income tax, 5.1%.  \n ", "  Appendix 2      39 \n34.  Expenditure  Management.  GOP  cannot  fund  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M) \nexpenditures or undertake capital investments in high-priority areas. This has led to a sharp \ndeterioration of key physical and social infrastructure, impairing prospects for growth. There is a \nsignificant backlog of infrastructure requiring regular repair and maintenance.  \n \n35.  In general, there are significant weaknesses in the auditing and reporting functions of \nGOP that make it difficult to accurately assess costs and expenditures in key sectors. There are \ntypically substantial discrepancies between revised estimates, estimates from the civil accounts, \nand estimates from the appropriation accounts. The civil accounts, which are records of actual \nexpenditure, are not published by GOP, and therefore, it is not possible to assess whether \nbudgetary  releases  have  actually  been  spent  properly.  A  comprehensive  analysis  of \nexpenditures  is  a  cumbersome  exercise.  The  Punjab  Public  Financial  Management  and \nAccountability Assessment in May 2005 recorded that the system through which public services \nobtained most of their resources did not function efficiently. It noted significant procedural \ndelays in the system that hindered the spending powers of the executive. These included a \nlengthy procurement process; many committees, which slow down decision-making; lack of \nincentives for taking timely decisions; and duplicate controls through pre-audit processes. \n \n36.  Multiyear  budgeting  is  a  prerequisite  for  estimating  the  funds  needed  to  complete \nongoing projects. GOP has already started to restructure its finances and is considering other \nmeasures to achieve the goals of the medium-term budget framework. To improve budgetary \npractices  and  ensure  the  attainment  of  medium-  and  long-term  goals,  GOP  has,  with  the \nassistance  of,  Department  for  International  Development,  already  started  performance \nbudgeting in, among others, the education, health, and agriculture sectors. \n \nE.   Development Planning and Resource Allocation \n \n37.  The  institutionalization  of  efficient  development  planning  and  resource  allocation \nsystems is key to effective public policy. In Pakistan, and in Punjab in particular, the systems \nare cumbersome, outdated, and may actually hinder implementation of development initiatives.  \n \n38.  Administrative  Budget  Preparation  Exercise.  GOP\u2019s  budgets  focus  on  nominal \nexpenditures rather than on outputs. This, combined with inadequately maintained accounts and \nineffectual monitoring, have weakened the link between allocations and outcomes, making \nbudget preparation a routine, administrative exercise that is not linked to policy objectives. \nBudget  allocations  continue  to  be  made  incrementally,  rather  than  in  the  wider  frame  of \nmedium-term priorities and poverty goals. The bulk of budgetary expenditures (about 75% of the \ntotal) are classified as permanent recurrent expenditures, which are rarely reviewed to establish \ntheir relevance to GOP\u2019s development priorities.  \n \n39.  Identification  and  Approval  of  Development  Schemes.  The  Planning  and \nDevelopment Department (P&DD) issues a directive and guidelines to all departments at the \nend of the second quarter of the fiscal year, asking them to recommend development schemes \nfor inclusion in the annual development program. Each department submits estimates for next \nyear\u2019s development expenditure to P&DD in the form of draft demands for funds. \n \n40.  As the third quarter of the fiscal year closes, the draft demands are reviewed by P&DD. \nBefore  1998,  the  bulk  of  provincial  development  schemes  were  funded  by  the  federal \ngovernment through cash development loans. The federal government stopped providing cash \ndevelopment  loans  to  provincial  governments  in  1998.  Nevertheless,  the  approval  of  the \nPlanning Commission is still required for all schemes of over PRs200 million. In Punjab, all ", " 40  Appendix 2 \ndevelopment schemes over PRs20 million are approved by the provincial development working \nparty,  chaired  by  a  representative  of  P&DD,  although  development  schemes  are  now \nimplemented at the district level. Schemes less than PRs20 million are approved by district \ndevelopment committees. Similarly, all schemes that have a component of foreign funding are \napproved  by  the  Provincial  Development  Working  Party.  Thus,  in  spite  of  devolution  of \nimplementation responsibilities, approval processes are yet to be entirely devolved. The process \ndescribed above has the following flaws:   \n \n(i)  Once approved, development schemes are not necessarily funded as part of the \nannual development program. There is no coherent link between approval and \nallocation of funds. While a certain degree of overprogramming is advisable to \nensure  that  funds  are  not  left  unused,  the  system  of  according  approval  to \nprojects  without  ensuring  availability  of  funds  makes  planning  process \nmeaningless. Given that the bulk of the annual development program resources \nare used to fund ongoing schemes, most of which are subject to cost and time \noverruns, preparing new schemes and having them approved is a wasted effort. \n \n(ii)  The absence of a link between approval and allocation creates a discrepancy \nbetween actual and required allocations for projects in the annual development \nprogram. Annual required allocations as specified in the Planning Commission \npro forma I (PC-I) of projects are included in the annual development program, \nwhich means schemes are often not completed on time or within the original cost \nestimates. Moreover, links between initial and recurrent costs of new projects \nhave not been established through well-defined procedures. While the PC-Is give \nestimates of future recurrent costs, there is no procedure for ensuring that these \nare  reflected  in  subsequent  recurrent  expenditures  funded  by  the  Finance \nDepartment. This results in a disconnection between development and recurrent \nbudgets, with obvious consequences in the form of mismatches.    \n \n41.  The provincial planning process is thus characterized by rigidities and structural defects \nleading  to  distortions  in  project  portfolio.  Development  budgets  or  annual  development \nexpenditures are considered more important than recurrent expenditure, primarily for political \nreasons. As a result, the service infrastructure created by GOP has expanded, while resources \navailable for non-salary operation and maintenance have decreased, leading to deterioration in \nservice delivery.  \n \n42.  Incremental Demands. P&DD\u2019s instructions to departments specify that the increase in \ndraft demands have to be within a certain percentage increase of the previous year\u2019s allocations \n(for FY2004 it was 20%). There is a tendency for departments to prepare draft demands \naccording to this \u201cformula\u201d, i.e., adding to last year\u2019s allocations up to the ceiling specified \nwithout considering whether the level of expenditure is required or can be accommodated. This \nstrategy has advantages for the departments, as it provides access to limited resources given \nthat P&DD tries to accommodate the maximum number of schemes in the annual development \nprogram, even if the resources are allocated are far below the required amounts for each \nscheme. The departments use their draft demands to claim future resource allocations, without \nconsidering the status of the underfunded and incomplete ongoing programs.

Background and Rationale \n \n1.  The Government of Pakistan (the Government) and the Government of the Punjab \n(GOP) launched a major governance program in 2000. The Punjab Resource Management \nProgram (PRMP) is a continuation of these efforts. Subprogram 1 was successfully completed \nand subprogram 2 will continue policy dialogue to improve Punjab\u2019s governance mechanisms \nand systems.   \n  \nB.  Purpose and Output \n \n2.  The  purpose  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  is  to  provide  advice  for  the \nimplementation  of  subprogram  2  and  for  further  broad-based  policy  reforms  through  the \npreparation of subprogram 3. Policy reforms under the PRMP are divided into the three areas: \n(i) fiscal and financial management, (ii) processes and institutions for pro-poor service delivery, \nand (iii) private sector development. PRMP will achieve its purpose when policy reforms result in \npublic resource management that is efficient, cost-effective, transparent, and accountable and \nleads to higher equity and sustainability. The TA will have four components. \n \n3.  Fiscal and Financial Management (Component 1). A key responsibility of the program \nmanagement unit (PMU) is to provide timely advice to the implementing departments and to \ncoordinate support for implementation targets. Experts will be engaged to facilitate (i) revenue \nand  expenditure  management;  (ii)  restructuring  of  public  debt  and  provincial  liabilities; \n(iii) analysis  of  inefficient  subsidies  and  options  for  phasing  them  out;  (iv)  improved \naccountability  and  financial  management  systems;  and  (v)  a  review  of  reforms  for  public \nprocurement systems. \n \n4.  Civil Service Reform (Component 2). To sustain the ongoing reforms, GOP will reform \nits human resource management. This component will support the GOP to (i) review and assess \nvarious options on restructuring the provincial civil service; (ii) assist in the preparation of a \nhuman resources policy; (iii) provide technical peer review for amendments to the legislation \nand  rules  of  the  provincial  public  service  commission;  and  (iv)  design  a  medium-  term \ndepartmental restructuring plan. In addition, this component will help the change management \nunit to circulate viable options for civil service reforms. \n \n5.  Private  Sector  Development  (Component  3).  A  key  focus  of subprogram  2  is  to \nfacilitate province-wide reforms for private sector activities, forging public\u2013private partnerships \nand reducing GOP\u2019s direct involvement in commercial activities. Under this component, TA will \nbe provided to (i) draft laws, regulations and rules required to effect changes in the legal regime \nthat  impedes  private  sector  growth  in  Punjab;  (ii)  prepare  templates  for  public\u2013private \npartnerships; (iii) design provincial and local government innovations in business processes to \nencourage the inclusion of private sector in service delivery; (iv) help the provincial and local \ngovernments to privatize and outsource agriculture-related functions; and (v) prepare options for \nprivatizing public sector organizations. \n \n6.  Reform Management and Policy Dialogue (Component 4). The second phase of the \nPRMP  will  require  the  Government  to  mobilize  technical  and  administrative  expertise  to \nconsolidate the achievements under subprogram 1 and to design demand-driven investments \n   ", " 56  Appendix 7 \nunder the TA loan. Consulting inputs under this component will assist the PMU to review the \nwork plans of departments, and advise on contracting procedures to carry out interventions \nunder the TA loan. Assistance will be provided to the PMU, the Finance Department and the \nPlanning and Development Department (P&DD) to (i) manage the work plan for the TA loan in \nline with the policy commitments of subprogram 2; (ii) develop capacities of key officials and \nplayers in the reform process; (iii) help the PMU to institute a performance monitoring and \nevaluation system for the reforms; (iv) provide civil society, and GOP\u2019s partner organizations \nwith strategic information and conduct policy dialogue; and (v) publicize progress on reforms \nthrough electronic and print media and professional and public exchanges.  \n \n7.  The TA will emphasize extensive stakeholder participation (GOP, civil society groups, \npoliticians from the provincial and local government levels, private sector, and the media) to \ndevelop subprogram 3, and, based on continuous policy dialogue, to implement and further \nimprove the reform agenda.  \n \nC.  Methodology, Key Activities, and Required Consultancy Expertise \n \n8.  The  TA  will  fund  (i)  foreign  and  domestic  experts  to  ensure  program  coordination, \nenhance policy analysis within the PMU, and develop the policy reform agenda for subprogram \n3; (ii) workshops to promote participation by civil society and other stakeholders; (iii) studies to \nenhance public resource management; and (iv) policy dialogue to broaden the reform ownership \nand include civil society. \n \n9.  In view of the overall scope of the TA on supporting the development of subprogram 3 of \nPRMP the following sector expertise will be required: \n \n(i)  fiscal  and  financial  management:  financial  governance  specialist,  pension \nspecialist, tax and tax policy specialist; \n(ii)  civil service reform, change management specialist, and public administration \nspecialist; \n(iii)  private sector development: private sector specialist; and \n(iv)  reform  management  and  policy  dialogue:  public  administration  and  capacity \ndevelopment specialist.  \n \nD.  Cost and Financing  \n \n10.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $187,500  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will provide $150,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. GOP will contribute the remaining local currency cost of $37,500 equivalent in \nkind by providing office accommodation, counterpart staff support, and facilities for seminars \nand meetings.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n11.  The  executing  agency  for  the  TA  will  be  the  P&DD.  Implementing  agencies  to  be \nsupported by the TA will include the departments of Planning and Development, Finance, \nExcise and Taxation, Management and Professional Development, Industries, Commerce and \nInvestment Promotion, Labor and Manpower, and Food. Each implementing agency already has \na core team, which, together with the consultants for the TA, will be responsible for undertaking \nthe key activities agreed upon for their particular area.

The  TA  is  expected  to  begin  once  subprogram  2  becomes  effective.  It  will  be \nimplemented within 18 months.  \n \n13.  All consultants will prepare inception reports on their respective work assignments within \n4 weeks of the commencement of their services. These will be used to fine-tune the work \nprogram and establish time-bound outputs. A full report, together with a description of proposed \nactivities and achievements for subprogram 3 will conclude the respective assignments. The \nfinal report, which will include complete documentation of all outputs, will be submitted within 1 \nmonth of the end of the assignment.   \n \n14.  The TA will require 3 person-months of international and 20 person-months of national \nconsulting services. All consultants will be recruited as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants using arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n \n   ", "58  Appendix 8             \nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\u2013DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF \nTHE UNITED KINGDOM (DFID) JOINT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT  \n \n1.  Rationale.  Implementing  and  sustaining  policy  reforms  under  the  Punjab  Resource \nManagement Program (PRMP) will require consistent, timely, and tailored technical assistance \n(TA) to the executive agency and implementing agencies over the life of PRMP. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) provided a TA loan during subprogram 1 of the PRMP, although for a \nnumber of reasons implementation was delayed. The term of the TA loan has now been \nextended.1  ADB  also  provided  advisory  TA  to  the  executing  agency,  the  Planning  and \nDevelopment Department (P&DD), for undertaking technical studies to support implementation \nof subprogram 1 reforms. However, during the design of subprogram 2, the government of the \nPunjab (GOP) and ADB re-affirmed the need for TA loan project to continue with modified \ncomponents. In addition, the DFID has agreed to complement the TA resources available to \nGOP by providing \u20a43 million over the next 3 years. DFID support to PRMP will be provided \nthrough the parallel and tied financing, details of which are contained in a memorandum of \nunderstanding between ADB and DFID. \n \n2.  ADB\u2013DFID Synergy. In close consultation with GOP, DFID and ADB have outlined their \nareas of support (Table A8). The delineation of responsibilities is tentative and subject to further \nrefinement and modification.  \n \n3.  Implementation Arrangements. The DFID TA will be implemented through the P&DD \nand the PRMP steering committee will approve its quarterly work plans. DFID will recruit an \ninternational firm to support TA implementation and the firm will submit monthly progress reports \nto all stakeholders including the PRMP program management unit. An executive sub-committee \nof the steering committee will review progress on the ADB\u2013DFID TA project monthly. \n \nTable A8: ADB-DFID Areas of Technical Assistance  \n \nComponent   Details \n  Asian Development Bank (ADB) Technical Assistance (TA) \nLoan Support \n1.

Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy  \n \n1.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n1.  In the aftermath of the steeply increasing incidence of poverty during the 1990s, the \nGovernment of the Punjab (GOP) produced a poverty reduction strategy (PRS) paper. This was \nbased on an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of poverty in the province and an \nextensive  consultative  process  that  included  civil  society.  The  PRS  paper  identified \n(i) governance reform, (ii) strengthening of planning capability, (iii) improvements to service \ndelivery, (iv) fiscal and financial reform, (v) income and employment generation, and (vi) gender \nmainstreaming as key elements of effective poverty reduction in Punjab. The Punjab Resource \nManagement Program (PRMP) aims to cover each of these. Subprogram 1 of the PRMP has \nalready helped to produce poverty-focused investment strategies for six key sectors in order to \nimplement the Punjab PRS. \n \n2.  In an earlier Asian Development Bank (ADB) poverty assessment for Pakistan,1 poor \ngovernance was identified as the key cause of poverty in Pakistan. Poor governance not only \nresulted in poor public service delivery and greater vulnerability, but also led to a drop in \nbusiness confidence, which in turn resulted in lower investment levels and growth. The poverty \nassessment was the main input for the country strategy and program, 2002\u20132006,2 which laid \nout ADB\u2019s medium-term development strategy for Pakistan. The country strategy and program \nwas developed in the context of the national PRS paper and the efforts to create a feasible \nmonitoring  framework  linked  to  the  budget  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund's  poverty \nreduction  and  growth  facility.  In  2004,  Pakistan  successfully  graduated  from  the  poverty \nreduction and growth facility.  \n \n2.  Poverty Analysis: Poverty and Public Resource Management in Punjab \n \n3.  Although there are several initiatives in Punjab for improving the quality and provision of \nservice delivery, obstacles remain. Services are insufficient and their quality leaves much to be \ndesired, which increases poverty. Inadequate public services and large social service deficits in \nhealth and education, combined with traditionally inadequate budgets for maintenance of roads, \nirrigation systems, water supply schemes, and other infrastructure, have contributed directly to \nlow economic growth, poor social indicators, and an inability to reduce poverty. Poor service \ndelivery is tied to declining public sector expenditures and to poor incentives for service delivery. \nHowever, it is encouraging that levels of investment in the social sector have recently increased. \nThe Punjab Education Sector Reform Program (funded by the World Bank) focuses on pro-poor \ninitiatives, including the provision of free books and stipends to girl students as part of efforts to \nincrease enrollments and retention in poor districts. Interventions under the Decentralization \nSupport Program3 and the Devolved Social Services Program (DSSP)4 are building capacities \nat provincial and local government levels for efficient and effective pro-poor service delivery with \nbetter monitoring, evaluation, and gender sensitivity. There have been major accomplishments \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2002. Poverty in Pakistan: Issues, Causes and Institutional Responses. Manila.  \n2   ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "Appendix 9  61\nunder subprogram 1, including the development of poverty-focused investment strategies for \nkey social sectors. \n \n4.  Subprogram  1  has  helped  to  reduce  the  high  debt  service  burden  through  early \nretirement of cash development loans. The initial restructuring of provincial taxes has resulted in \nan increase in revenues, although Punjab still feels fiscal squeeze with low revenues and high \nestablishment costs. Almost 80% of provincial current expenditures are committed to pensions, \ninterest payments, subsidies, wages, and grants to local governments. The annual development \nprogram  is  still  overloaded  with  ongoing  projects  that  entail  a  large  \u201cthrow  forward\u201d  of \nexpenditure liabilities. The budget process focus on inputs and the inability to prioritize or review \nmost  expenditure  items,  combined  with  the  tendency  to  enforce  damaging  short-term \nexpenditure controls to address the fiscal squeeze, have seriously reduced the effectiveness of \npublic expenditures in Punjab. The continuity of reforms in underlying systems and processes to \nmanage public resources is crucial if the incidence of poverty in Punjab to be arrested and \nreversed.  \n \n3.  Participation Process \n \na.  Stakeholder Analysis  \n \n5.  The outcomes of stakeholder consultations at all three levels of government and civil \nsociety have been incorporated into the design of the PRMP. Lessons learned during the \nconsultative process for the preparation of the Decentralization Support Program and the DSSP \nhave also been included.  \n \n6.  The PRMP approach was the result of policy dialogue which began in 2002 with ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA).5 The PRMP is built on a continuous policy dialogue, which will \ncontinue  upto  2008.  All  key  stakeholders,  including  politicians,  civil  servants,  civil  society \norganizations,  media,  private  sector  representatives  and  other  partner  organizations,  are \nregularly consulted. The cluster approach, with regular dialogue, has ensured that the reforms, \ndespite being demanding, have stayed broadly on track. \n \n7.  An important feature of the PRMP is its support for the Punjab Development Forum \n(PDF). This is now is a well established and regular event which brings all stakeholders together \nto (i) study and evaluate development progress in Punjab, (ii) discuss key challenges, and (iii) \nprovide guidance on how to meet development challenges.6  \n \nb.  Participation Strategy \n \n8.  One  of  the  central  themes  in  GOP\u2019s  current  efforts  at  poverty  reduction  is  its \nparticipatory approach, and the Punjab PRS paper was formulated on the basis of wide-ranging \nconsultations with major stakeholders. GOP\u2019s commitment to participation is reflected in the \nongoing reform effort, which emphasizes consultation through initiatives such as the PDF. \nConsultations were a regular feature of subprogram 1 and included the Medium-Term Budget \nFramework (MTBF) Forum in October 2004. PRMP is designed to (i) ensure that the systems \nand procedures in the public sector promote accessibility, accountability and transparency; and \n(ii) devote  considerable  resources  to  developing  the  capacities  of  provincial  government \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

With clear evidence of \nparticipatory approaches gaining ground in government processes, there is an urgent need to \ninstitutionalize of wider stakeholder participation with the support of the political leadership and \nbureaucracy.  \n \n9.  In line with the recommendations of evaluations of other policy-based lending, the PRMP \nwill  continue  to  convene  the  PDF  and  to  conduct  other  participatory  processes  engaging \nstakeholders at federal, provincial, and local levels. The PRMP receives oversight and guidance \nthrough a high-level steering committee, which includes representatives of civil society and the \nprivate sector. As the reform process under PRMP deepens, the role of the steering committee \nwill  become  central  to  its  success;  more  vigorous  and  regular  direction  from  the  steering \ncommittee will be required under subprogram 2. \n \n4.  Social Issues \n \n10.  The Punjab PRS paper highlighted the need to set up of a system of monitoring and \nevaluating social and economic conditions. The paper identified key indicators, baselines, and \ntargets, and clearly defined the responsibility for collection of data related to each indicator. The \nADB  TA  on  Local  Government  Performance  Enhancement7  and  Gender  and  Governance \nMainstreaming8  also  established  baselines  and  targets  for  gender,  access,  equity,  and \nsustainability. In addition, the TA on Enhancing Capacity for Poverty Reduction and Resource \nManagement in Punjab9 provides for the engagement of a monitoring and evaluation specialist \nwho will work with GOP to develop key performance indicators to monitor progress against \nsocial sector targets. The work on monitoring and evaluation has been done under previous TA \nand  the  DSSP  is  encouraging.  The  executing  agency  of  the  PRMP,  the  Planning  and \nDevelopment Department (P&DD), intends to undertake a major capacity building initiative to \nimprove its monitoring and evaluation systems and processes, including those carried out by the \nPunjab Economic Research Institute and the Bureau of Statistics.  \n \na.  Gender \n \n11.  Recent data from the Pakistan integrated household survey, 2000-01, and the multiple \nindicator cluster survey, 2003-04, confirm the wide gender disparities in Punjab in relation to \naccess to basic social services, such as health and education, and employment opportunities. \nLarge disparities persist across urban and rural sectors and across different income levels. \nThese disparities are higher in rural areas. Reported labor force participation by women is \nextremely low. \n \n12.  A  preliminary  gender  review  of  federal,  provincial,  and  district  level  public  sector \nexpenditure and its management suggests a critical need for cross-sector and comprehensive \ngender analysis, planning, budgeting, auditing, and monitoring systems, and a methodology and \nmechanisms to ensure gender-balanced resource distribution at all the three levels. Fulfilling \ncommitments on mainstreaming gender is one of the key objectives of the PRMP. The approval \nand implementation of the provincial gender reform action plan (GRAP) was achieved under \nsubprogram 1. A PRs612 million GRAP Planning Commission pro forma I (PC-I) with the \nobjective of mainstreaming gender at all levels of the government has been approved by GOP.  \n                                                 \n7  Technical assistance loan approved under ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "Appendix 9  63\n \nb.  Access \n \n13.  The reforms proposed under PRMP will promote (i) improved public access to services, \nand (ii) access to timely reliable information on resource management issues. Public access to \nservices will have a direct impact on improving the welfare of the poor while improving access to \ninformation will enhance the pro-poor focus of public expenditures. There will be positive direct \nimpacts from greater access to pro-poor service delivery. Improved governance will result in \nlower transaction costs as rent-seeking behavior and graft are reduced. The resulting lower \ntransaction costs will benefit the poor and the non-poor alike, which will improve access for all. \nThe impact of the reforms carried out under subprogram 1 is already visible as key sectors now \nhave poverty-focused investment strategies and progress has been made towards preparing \nbudgets according to the MTBF. Subprogram 2 would help further refine and institutionalize the \npoverty-focused investment strategy. \n \n14.  The PRMP aims to improve effectiveness, predictability, and accountability in financial \nmanagement  by  ensuring  transparency  in  (i) the  budgeting  process,  (ii) intergovernmental \nfinancing, and (iii) procurement of goods and services. Affording access to this information to all \nstakeholders will improve public oversight and monitoring and help keep expenditures focused \nin a pro-poor direction. Improving monitoring, feedback, and evaluation systems will ensure that \ndecisions are based on analysis of widely understandable and available information about \nprevailing conditions and that information is not the privilege of the few to be used for personal \nor political expediency. Both aspects of access\u2014to services and to information\u2014are critical for \nthe success of the PRMP and will feature prominently in subprogram 2.  \n \nc.  Equity \n \n15.  Equity is the main consideration of the PRMP, and it therefore supports the phasing out \nof subsidies that do not explicitly target the poor. The PRMP will support more spending for pro-\npoor public service delivery and more transparent and efficient public resource management. \nEquity will be supported by making the public sector human resources management more merit- \nbased. \n \n16.  In Pakistan, there are often horizontal imbalances across local government units with \nregard to resource endowments. The PRMP will help to ensure greater equity across local \ngovernments. A more proactive criteria-based approach toward resource sharing among the \ndistricts on the one hand and between the province and the districts on the other would go a \nlong way towards rationalizing resource allocations and putting in place a more pro-poor focus. \nDistrict level poverty-focused investment plans and programs will be supported.  \n \nd.  Sustainability \n \n17.  ADB actively supports measures to improve effective resource management (which was \nidentified as the basis for poverty reduction in Punjab in the PRS paper). PRMP has already \nhelped bring about significant reforms in development planning and resource management \nsystems.  GOP  has  already  begun  important  reforms,  including  preparation  of  the  MTBF, \ntaxation reforms, reforms in procurement of goods and services, improvements to the planning \nand approval process for development projects with a poverty focus, and the approval of a new \nindustrial policy that addresses many of the concerns of the private sector. Initial steps to \nstrengthen  the  pro-business  orientation  of  legal  instruments  and  to  reduce  bureaucratic \ndiscretion began under subprogram 1 and have already started to improve the business climate. \n   ", "64   Appendix 9 \n \nSubprogram 2 will build on this and support GOP to implement the essentially homegrown \nreform agenda that was begun under subprogram 1. Given GOP\u2019s strong sense of ownership of \nthe reform process, the prospects for the long-term sustainability of the PRMP\u2019s achievements \nare good.   \nTable A9.1: Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \nA.

Effective public resource management will increase revenues, improve allocation \nefficiency of public expenditures toward high socioeconomic returns, enhance sustainability of and access by the poor \nto public services, including for basic social services and infrastructure, and promote private sector development and \nemployment generation. Governance reforms, including public resource management, are a central element in the \ncountry poverty analysis. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Poverty Classification \n   \nThe Punjab Resource Management Program is a central element of the  Poverty Intervention \nPunjab poverty reduction strategy paper to reduce the incidence of poverty \nin Punjab from 33% in 1999 to 28% in 2006. The Punjab Resource \nManagement  Program  is  supporting  the  three  components  of  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  poverty  reduction  strategy:  pro-poor \nsustainable economic growth, good governance, and social development. \nPro-poor sustainable economic growth is to be achieved through measures \nthat increase the enabling environment for private sector development. \nThis, in turn, will promote employment opportunities for Pakistan\u2019s rapidly \ngrowing population and raise real wages of the working poor. To support \ngovernance, the Program will increase transparency and accountability in \nutilization of funds, and develop institutional arrangements and processes \nthat  allow  for  greater  participation  of  civil  society  in  investment \nprogramming. Improved fiscal management will provide space for financing \nhigh-priority  expenditures  targeted  at  the  poor.  Support  to  social \ndevelopment will come about through enhanced public sector allocations \nfor health, education, or water supply and sanitation, as well measures that \nallow greater competition and participation by the private sector in service \nprovision to improve service quality. Adjustments at the provincial level are \nparticularly important to bring about as most of social development services \nthat impact on the livelihood off the poor are delivered at provincial and \ndistrict level.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  Yes    \n \nIs there a participation strategy? Yes          \n \nStakeholder consultation has been pursued throughout program formulation, and a Punjab Development Forum (PDF) \nprocess was constituted for wider stakeholder consultation and participation of civil society prior to finalizing the \nProgram.
