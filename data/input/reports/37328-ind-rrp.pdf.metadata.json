Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to \nsupport  implementation  of  the  civil  works.  Road  improvement \nworks  under  the  Project  include  rehabilitating  and  improving \nexisting  roads,  strengthening  existing  culverts  and  bridges,  and \nconstructing new bridges and cross-drainage structures.   \n \nThe Project will also enhance overall sector management capacity \nby providing (i) equipment for the government of Madhya Pradesh \n(GOMP)  to  enhance  sector  capacity  such  as  road  safety  and \ncontrol of overloading; and (ii) technical assistance (TA) to support \nGOMP  sector  development  initiatives,  especially  for  reform  and \nthe  Madhya  Pradesh  Public  Works \ncapacity  building  of \nDepartment (MPPWD), including (a) enhancing planning capacity, \n(b) improving business processes, (c) improving human resources \nmanagement, and (d) increasing private sector participation. \n \nThe  state  road  network  requires  improvement  in  terms  of \ncoverage  and  conditions.  About  half  of  the  state  roads  are \nassessed  to  have  deteriorated  severely  and  require  major \nrehabilitation  largely  because  of  the  continuous  shortfall  in \ninvestment  on  road  maintenance  until  recently,  and  increasing \nvolume of traffic and loads. The rehabilitation of 1,800 km of state \nroads  under  the  Project  will  help  complete  the  strategically \nimportant  state  road  network  and  help  meet  the  increased \ndemands of road transport. \n \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\f \n\nii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\n \n\nis \n\nin \n\nin  charge  of  overall  sector  development  and \nMPPWD \nmanagement. However, it lacks modern project management and \nprocurement systems, which often leads to cost and time overruns \nin  project  delivery.  For  efficient  and  effective  road  asset \ndevelopment  and  management  covering  all  categories  of  roads, \nthe  overall  capacity  of  MPPWD  must  be  enhanced.  The  Madhya \nPradesh  Road  Development  Corporation \n(MPRDC)  was \nestablished  in  line  with  a  comprehensive  reform  under  the \nMadhya  Pradesh  State  Roads  Sector  Development  Program  to \nefficiently implement projects of strategically important state roads \nby  adopting  modern  systems \nits  business  processes. \nImprovements  to  road  safety  and  control  of  overloading  are  also \nrequired for the safe and efficient use of road assets. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  transport  efficiency  of  the  state  road \nnetwork,  which  will  contribute \nto  expansion  of  economic \nopportunities  and  poverty  reduction.  This  will  be  realized  by  (i) \nimproving  the  state  road  network,  (ii)  facilitating  safe  and \nappropriate  road  usage,  (iii)  increasing  efficiency  of  transport \nservices,  and  (iv)  enhancing  GOMP  capacity  for  road  asset \ndevelopment  and  management.  Improved  roads  will  improve \naccessibility  to  social  services  and  markets,  and  enhance  the \nefficiency of road transport usage. With the central location of the \nstate  in  the  country,  the  Project  will  improve  transport  efficiency \nfor the rest of India. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $400  million, \nincluding taxes and duties. \n \nA loan of $320,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.35% per annum, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n \nThe  Government  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds  in  local  currency \nto  GOMP  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  received  from \nADB. GOMP will bear the foreign exchange risk on the loan. \n \nUntil 31 December 2010 \n \n30 June 2010 \n\n \nGOMP acting through MPRDC \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\niii   \n\n \n\nThe chief engineer at MPRDC headquarters will be designated as \nthe  \u201cproject  in  charge\u201d  for  project  implementation.  Seven  project \nimplementation  units,  each  headed  by  a  divisional  manager,  will \nbe responsible for project implementation in the field. One or two \nfull-time  project  managers  will  be  assigned  for  each  contract \npackage.  The  divisional  managers  will  be  delegated  adequate \ntechnical  and  administrative  authority  for  expeditious  project \nimplementation. Construction supervision consultants engaged by \nMPRDC will act as the engineer for construction contracts. \n \nProcurement  under  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  the  Government\u2019s  tender  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB. The civil works contracts will be procured under international \ncompetitive  bidding.  The  Project  will  provide  $1  million  for \nequipment  to  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding \nprocedures if the estimated contract is valued from $0.1 million to \n$1  million,  and  shopping  if  the  estimated  contract  amount  is  less \nthan $0.1 million.   \n \nTwo international consulting firms will be recruited for construction \nsupervision  of  civil  works  under  the  Project.  MPRDC  will  select \nand engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). \nAbout  56  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  1,758 \nperson-months of national consultants will be required. \n \nThe improved state road network management through the sector \ndevelopment  program  and  the  TA,  and  improved  road  network \nunder  the  Project  will  enhance  the  overall  road  condition  and \nusability,  thus  increasing  travel  speeds  and  reducing  travel  time, \naccidents,  and  overloading.  The  Project  will  also  enhance \nMPPWD\u2019s capacity for road asset development and management, \nin  road  administration  and \nwhich  will \nimprove  governance \naccountability,  and  create  an  environment \nthat  encourages \ncompetition and efficiency within MPPWD and in the construction \nindustry.  This  will  ensure  more  efficient  road  asset  development \nand  management,  and  higher  quality  of  construction  and \nmaintenance,  resulting  in  decreased  recurrent  costs  over  the \nmedium  and  long  term.  These  will  lead  to  overall  social  and \neconomic development in Madhya Pradesh. \n \nPoverty  incidence  is  significantly  higher  in  Madhya  Pradesh  than \nin India overall. The Project will improve access to socioeconomic \nservices, increase employment opportunities, and improve means \nof  transport  services,  which  will  in  turn  reduce  poverty  in  the \nregion,  and  stimulate  economic  growth  and  human  development \nin the state. Improved mobility will provide households with better \npaying jobs outside of their villages.  \n \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\nto  due  diligence \n\nThe  risk  of  initial  delays  has  already  been  mitigated  through \nMPRDC\u2019s advance actions and TA provided by ADB. Training on \nsafeguard  requirements  has  been  provided  to  MPRDC  staff  to \nmitigate  the  potential  risk  of  initial  delays  due  to  procedural \nfor \nclearance.  The  TA  provides  support \nsubproject  approval.  Frameworks  for  safeguarding  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  have  been  set  up  so  that  network \ndevelopment  will  be  ensured  while  minimizing  or  nullifying \nnegative  impacts  on  land  acquisition,  involuntary  resettlement, \nand social and environmental aspects.  \n \nThe  sector  reform  agenda  reflects  the  context  of  the  state  of \nMadhya  Pradesh  in  the  institutional  development  action  plan  by \ntaking into account the rather short-term project duration, actions \ntaken by GOMP, and the recent GOMP policy recommendations.  \n \nThe  risk  of  an  inefficient  and  ineffective  maintenance  budget  will \nbe  mitigated  by  implementing  budget  monitoring  systems  for  full \nutilization and road management systems for better planning and \nbudgeting through the TA. GOMP has increased its maintenance \nbudget,  which  substantially  covers  the  requirement  since  the \ncurrent  fiscal  year  2006/07  especially  due  to  provision  of  the \nGovernment  of  India\u2019s  grant-in-aide  under  the  12th  Finance \nCommission. \n \nIn  conjunction  with  the  Project,  TA  will  be  provided  to  support \nGOMP\u2019s sector development initiatives. MPPWD will be equipped \nwith  (i)  norm-based  planning  and  budgeting,  (ii) \nimproved \nresources \nbusiness  practices,  and \nmanagement. An alternative realigned structure of the state\u2019s road \nsector  institutions  will  be  proposed  for  long-term  road  sector \nreform. The estimated cost of the TA is $1,250,000, of which ADB \nwill  finance  $1,000,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special \nFund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  TA  consultants \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. \n \n\nimproved  human \n\n(iii) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nv\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  India  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Roads  Sector  Project  II.  The  report  also  describes \nproposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Institutional  Strengthening  of  Madhya  Pradesh  Public \nWorks Department, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nThe state of Madhya Pradesh is located in center of India. Traffic from the surrounding \n2. \nstates  passes  through  the  state  using  the  road  and  rail  networks.  Railways  connecting  north\u2013\nsouth and east\u2013west regions of India pass through Madhya Pradesh with a total length of about \n5,900  kilometers  (km).  However,  due  to  the  state\u2019s  vast  area,  the  railway  services  cannot \nprovide  the  desired  connectivity  to  major  economic  zones  and  centers.  The  railway  network \ntraversing  the  state  serves  the  needs  of  cross-country  traffic  more  than  those  of  Madhya \nPradesh. In total, 11 major districts in the state have little rail service. Civil aviation, ports, and \ninland waterways have a very limited role in the state\u2019s overall economy and transport services. \nAs a result, roads are the predominant mode of transport. \n \n3. \nMadhya Pradesh has 72,000 km of roads, of which 60,000 km are surfaced. It has 4,286 \nkm of national highways, 8,728 km of state highways, 10,817 km of major district roads (MDRs), \nand  48,590  km  of  other  district  roads  (ODRs)/village  roads.  The  road  network  is  75  km/100 \nsquare km (km2) in the country, and 45 in Madhya Pradesh. Surfaced roads, e.g., black-topped \nor  bitumen,  cement,  or  water-bound  macadam,  comprise  21.4  km/100  km2  in  the  country  and \n8.4 in Madhya Pradesh. Most roads (85%) are surfaced; most (98%) unsurfaced roads such as \ngravel and earthen roads are in the ODR/village road category. Only 8% of state highways have \ntwo  or  more  lanes,  52%  are  single  lane;  90%  of  MDRs  are  single  lane.  All  the  ODRs/village \nroads  are  single  lane.  About  half  of  the  roads  in  each  category  of  national  highways,  state \nhighways,  and  MDRs,  and  80%  of  ODRs/village  roads  are  assessed  to  have  deteriorated \nseverely  and  require  major  rehabilitation  largely  because  of  continuous  shortfall  in  investment \non road maintenance until recently, and increasing volume of traffic and loads. Increasing and \nimproving  the  existing  highway  network  in  the  state  by  widening  existing  carriageways,  and \nstrengthening and constructing or reconstructing bridges and culverts is required. \n \n4. \nMadhya  Pradesh Public Works Department (MPPWD) is responsible for the state road \nnetwork.  The  Government  of  India\u2019s  (the  Government)  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Road  Transport, \nand  Highways  (MOSRTH)  administers  national  highways,  but  delegates  development  and \nmaintenance of these roads to MPPWD. MPPWD\u2019s district administrations manage most ODRs \nand  village  roads.  In  addition,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Rural  Roads  Development  Authority  is \nresponsible  for  developing  ODRs/village  roads,  which  are  funded  through  a  special  scheme \ninitiated  by  the  Government  (Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana  or  PMGSY).  For  the  state \nroad  network,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Road  Development  Corporation  (MPRDC)  develops  and \nmanages strategically important roads including all state highways and some national highways \ndelegated  by  MOSRTH  and  MDRs  delegated  by  MPPWD.  MPRDC  also  implements  all  build-\noperate-transfer (BOT) roads and bridges. \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nMPRDC  was  established  in  line  with  a  comprehensive  reform  under  the  ADB-funded \n5. \nMadhya  Pradesh  State  Roads  Sector  Development  Program  (MPSRSDP). 1  MPRDC  was \nincorporated  as  a  company  under  the  Indian  Companies  Act,  1956,  primarily  to  take  over  the \nfunctions  of  the  former  Madhya  Pradesh  Rajya  Setu  Nirman  Nigam  Limited  and  to  promote \npublic-private  partnership  projects  in  the  road  sector.  It  is wholly  owned  by  the  government  of \nMadhya Pradesh (GOMP) and has been declared and notified as the highway authority under \nsection  4  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Highway  Act,  2004.  MPRDC  has  started  functioning  as  the \nstate highway authority as was envisaged in the reform program. \n \n6. \nMPRDC is a lean organization: using consultants for project preparation and supervision \nduring  delivery  periods,  adopting  modern  procurement  systems  guided  by  FIDIC2 conditions, \nand  setting  up  computerized  road  asset  management  and  financial  management  systems.  An \nADB  TA  strengthened  MPRDC  capacity.  MPPWD,  which  implements  all  other  state  roads, \nfollows  the  Public  Works  Manual  designed  largely  in  line  with  the  Central  Public  Works \nDepartment manual. It lacks modern project management and procurement systems, and often \nexperiences cost and time overruns in project delivery. \n \nBudgetary  expenditure  for  state  roads  in  2004/05  was  Rs673  crore 3  ($150  million) \n7. \nagainst  an  original  budget  of  Rs886  crore  ($197  million).  The  extent  of  underspending  was \nequivalent to 24% of the original budget. In 2005/06, the budget increased by 29% at Rs1,080 \ncrore ($240 million). The 2006/07 budget has increased further to Rs1,598 crore ($355 million). \nHowever, an increasing proportion of road sector spending is taking place outside the budget, \nespecially on Bond4/BOT roads. Reconstruction of more than 900 km of roads is planned under \nthe Bond/BOT scheme by 2007/08 at a total cost of about Rs950 crore ($211 million). This will \nbring the total length of Bond/BOT roads throughout the state to 2,000 km. \n \n8. \nRevenues relating to road use include registration fees, vehicle taxes, passenger taxes, \nand goods tax were Rs560 crore ($124 million) in 2005/06, which increased from Rs393 crore \n($87  million)  in  2001/02.  The  average  annual  increase  is  9.4%  with  a  substantial  increase  of \n15% during the last 2 years due to introduction of a smart card system for vehicle registration \nand  tax  payment.  In  addition,  road  users  pay  fees  at  border  posts  for  overloading  control; \ncommercial sales taxes such as vehicles, fuel, tires, and spare parts; central road fund share; \nand  tolls  to  MPPWD  and  BOT  concessionaires.  Road  users  paid  approximately  Rs340  crore \n($76 million) in 2005/06 to GOMP and the Bond/BOT concessionaires. \n \n9. \nThe  Madhya  Pradesh  Transport  Department  is  responsible  for  licensing,  registration, \nand  regulation  of  motor  vehicles,  drivers,  and  passenger  and  freight  transport.  Motor  vehicle \nregistration increased from 2.9 million in 2001 to 4.2 million in 2005, which is 9.4% increase per \nyear on average. Of 3.8 million motor vehicles registered, 76% were two wheelers. Of vehicles \nother  than  two  wheelers,  43%  were  tractors/trailers,  20%  cars  and  jeeps,  11%  commercial \ntrucks,  and  2%  buses  and  minibuses.  Motor  vehicles  on  roads  in  Madhya  Pradesh  increased \nfrom 2.6 million in 2001 to 3.9 million in 2005, an average increase of 10.2% per year. \n \n10. \nThe  state-owned  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Road  Transport  Corporation,  which  was \nresponsible  for  about  3%  of  the  state\u2019s  buses,  is  being  closed  down  in  a  phased  manner.  A \nnumber  of  government-operated  routes  have  now  been  released  for  private  sector  operation, \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2002.

Manila.  \n\n2  Federation Internationale Des Ingenieurs-Conseils \n3   A crore is equal to Rs10,000,000. \n4  Bonds roads are those financed under the Madhya Pradesh Infrastructure Investment Fund Scheme. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nand  once  the  corporation  is  closed  all  routes  will  be  released  to  the  private  sector.  Route \npermits are given for private operators. GOMP  sets fares, which are generally followed. Truck \nhire  rates  are  fixed  by  market  demand.  Competition  is  good.  Private  sector  operators  provide \nmost  of  the  services  for  passenger  and  freight  transport.  Madhya  Pradesh  Transport \nDepartment is also responsible for enforcing axle-load regulations. It has a system of 39 weigh \nstations at entry points into the state, and mobile squads to carry out its responsibilities. Traffic \npolice,  under  the  Home  Department,  are  responsible  for  enforcing  traffic  and  road  safety \nregulations. \n \n11. \nThe  road  accident  rate  in  Madhya  Pradesh  was  12.4  fatalities  per  10,000  vehicles  in \n2004, decreasing from 13.2 in 2001. The rate now has improved to the national average (12.8 in \n2003).  However,  it  is  still  much  higher  than  in  Australia,  Europe,  Japan,  and  United  States. \nAccidents  are  primarily  due  to  driver  error,  followed  by  poor  mechanical  condition  of  motor \nvehicles.  \n \n12. \nprovides more details of the state road sector.   \n \nB. \n\nThe  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  Project  is  in  Appendix  1.  Appendix  2 \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nMain Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n\n \n13. \nThe  state\u2019s  road  network  requires  improvement  in  terms  of  coverage  and  condition. \nDemands  for  road  transport  are  increasing.  Insufficient  funding  for  road  maintenance  has \nincreased the backlog of deferred maintenance. GOMP is now working to reduce the backlog of \ndeferred  maintenance  as  set  out  in  Refurbishing  Roads  in  Madhya  Pradesh.5 The  state  road \nrehabilitation  program  is  to  immediately  strengthen  and  improve  the  state  road  network  by \n2009/10. \n \n14. \nGOMP  also  takes  on  sector  development  initiatives  under  the  State  Road  Policy  to \ndevelop  and  sustain  the  road  network  in  accordance  with  Indian  Roads  Congress  standards, \ndevelop  efficient  asset  management  systems,  enhance  the  capacity  for  effective  and  efficient \nroad  construction,  attract  private  sector  financing  roads,  and  ensure  high  standards  of  road \nsafety and travel comfort.  \n \n\na. \n\nReform and Capacity Building in Road Sector Management \n\n \n15. \nUnder  the  MPSRSDP,  substantial  sector  reform  was  achieved.  Major  achievements \ninclude  enactment  of  the  State  Highway  Act,  2004,  and  incorporation  of  MPRDC  and  its \nsubsequent notification as the highway authority for state highways. MPRDC has adopted best \npractices  of  planning  and  maintenance  systems,  financial  management,  and  procurement. \nMPRDC is now regarded as the benchmark for good practices in managing the state highway \nnetwork.  GOMP  highly  appreciated  the  contributions  made  by  the  TA  provided  in  parallel  with \nthe MPSRSDP loan, especially in terms of establishing and building MPRDC capacity. MPPWD \nintends to adopt relevant MPRDC technologies and practices. \n \n16. \nGOMP recently provided policy recommendations to improve MPPWD operations, which \ninclude  development  of  appropriate  road  development  plans,  improvement  of  MPPWD\u2019s \nbusiness  procedures  and  practices,  and  human  resources  management.  GOMP  recently \n\n                                                 \n5   Government of Madhya Pradesh. 2005. Refurbishing Roads in Madhya Pradesh. Bhopal. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\ndecided  to  abolish  the  letter-of-credit  system  to  streamline  administrative  procedures  for \ntransparent,  effective,  and  efficient  use  of  the  allocated  budget.  MPPWD  also  initiates \nenhancement  of  the  planning  capacity  to  prioritize  roads  for  improvement  on  the  basis  of \neconomic  viability  and  to  prepare  condition-based  budget  allocation  for  maintenance.  Such \ninitiatives  include  establishment  of  the  Planning  Unit  at  the  state  center,  training  of  project \nmanagement skills, and pilot implementation of road management systems in selected districts. \n \n\nb. \n\nRoad Maintenance Financing \n\n \n17. \nThe nonplan budget has been substantially increased from Rs136 crore to Rs423 crore \nduring  the  past  5  years  (from  2002/03  to  2006/07).  The  Planning  Commission  estimates  the \nmaintenance  requirement  as  Rs500  crore  per  annum.  The  budget  allocation  since  the  current \nfiscal  year  2006/07  substantially  covers  the  requirement  especially  due  to  provision  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s grant-in-aide (about Rs147 crore annually) under the 12th Finance Commission. \nAfter  GOMP\u2019s  road  improvement  program,  the  budget  requirement  for  maintenance  will  be \nincreased and is estimated at Rs650 crore annually between 2009/10 and 2014/2015. Revenue \nrelating  to  road  use  is  estimated  at  Rs557  crore  in  2005/06,  increasing  by  15%  from  the \nprevious year, which is absorbed in the general government revenue. GOMP also established \nan  earmarked  reserve  known  as  the  Kisan  Road  Fund,  which  is  exclusively  used  for \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  of  state  roads.  About  Rs100  crore  to  Rs120  crore  has  been \ncollected every year from a major portion (85%) of one half of market cess levied on agriculture \nproduce since 2001. \n \n18. \nThe  primary  concern  is  the  efficient  and  effective  utilization  of  the  budget.  Due  to  the \nstrong GOMP initiatives on effective use of gang labor, the increase to maintenance excluding \nsalary and wages is much higher, from Rs56 crore in 2002/03 to Rs296 crore in 2006/07. The \nshare of the salary/wage element in the nonplan budget is reduced from 70% in 2003/04 to 40% \nin  2006/07  (as  of  October  2006).  This  demonstrates  GOMP\u2019s  increased  commitment  to \nmaintenance  and  increased  efficiency  of  road  maintenance  works.  GOMP  is  expected  to \nimprove efficiency, e.g., further 30% reduction from the current level of the wage/salary element \nof maintenance works by the end of the Project. Increased construction quality due to inclusion \nof  3\u20135-year  performance  guarantee  in  civil  works  contracts  will  also  increase  the  efficiency  of \nmaintenance works and hence reduce maintenance costs. \n \n\nc. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n \nGOMP  took  on  major  initiatives  to  facilitate  road  development  through  public-private \n19. \npartnerships, such as enactment of the Madhya Pradesh Highway Act, 2004, and Indian Tolls \n(Madhya Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1992. The 1992 amendment of the Indian Tolls Act and the \nIndian Tolls (Madhya Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1992, empower GOMP to enter into contracts \nfor  development  of  public  roads  and  bridges  with  private  entities,  appoint  them  as  lessees  for \ncollection of tolls on contracted roads or bridges, and give them protection in the matter of toll \ncollection as if they were employed by GOMP. Currently, MPRDC manages 1,540 km of roads \nunder  the  BOT  scheme.  An  additional  640  km  is  proposed  to  be  developed  under  the  BOT \nscheme in 2006/07. All state highway maintenance is now contracted out to the private sector. A \nmaintenance,  operate,  and  transfer  scheme  has  been  introduced  and  will  be  applied  to  ADB-\nfunded roads where it is financially viable. MPRDC will explore more opportunities for applying \nBOT and maintenance, operate, and transfer schemes to high-density state roads. \n \n20.  MPPWD contracts all road improvement and part of periodic maintenance to the private \nsector.  MPPWD  will  increase  the  contracting  out  of  maintenance  works  by  incorporating  3\u20135-\n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nyear maintenance works into civil works contracts. This will be in accordance with the reduction \nin gang labor to keep roads in a maintainable condition. \n \n\nd. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n21. \nThe  state  Road  Safety  Council  was  reconstituted  in  2006,  chaired  by  a  chief  minister \nand  comprising  representatives  of  all  government  agencies,  road  user  groups,  and  transport \nexperts concerned. Committees coordinate various efforts to improve road safety. District road \nsafety  committees  under  the  leadership  of  a  district collector  meet  2\u20134  times  a  year  to  review \nroad  safety  issues,  especially  a  road  safety  program  comprising  20  issues  such  as \nimplementation  of  improvements  to  road  sections  that  are  prone  to  accidents,  e.g.,  geometry, \nguardrails and other protective measures at bridges and high embankments, advance warning \nmeasures to prevent accidents during the heavy rain season, reflective markers on the side of \ncarriageways,  and  use  of  helmets  and  seatbelts.  The  traffic  police  collects  and  analyzes \naccident  data.  Other  initiatives  taken  by  GOMP  include  road  safety  education  included  in  the \nschool  curriculum,  establishment  of  trauma  care  centers,  and  setting  up  of  an  accident \nassistance number.  \n \n22.  MPRDC  has  established  a  road  safety  cell  to  institutionalize  safety  measures,  and \nmodified the accident investigation and prevention manual prepared for the Ministry of Shipping, \nRoad Transport and Highways under ADB TA6 to reflect local experiences and to adapt it to the \nroad network. The accident investigation and prevention manual was prepared in 1996 to guide \nhighway authorities and engineers in reducing road accidents and fatalities in India. Based on \nthis,  MPRDC  conducts  a  road  safety  audit  to  ensure  safety  features  are  incorporated  in  road \ndesign. MPRDC conducted a road safety audit for the proposed Project and the previous ADB \nproject (footnote 1).  \n \n23. \nIn  1996,  the  Government  recommended  establishing  the  Directorate  of  Safety  and \nTraffic  Management  and  setting  up  a  road  safety  fund,  earmarking  1%  of  cess  revenue  for \nnational  highways.  An  expert  committee  at  MOSRTH  will  review  these  recommendations  and \nfinalize  a  state  road  safety  policy  to  address  legal,  institutional,  and  financial  issues  for  road \nsafety. This will provide a new context for the funding and institutional setup for road safety at \nthe state level. \n \n \n \nThe state has a legal framework for controlling overloading of vehicles. The weakness is \n24. \nthe lack of inspection, surveillance, and enforcement system to enforce it. GOMP (i) has drawn \nup a phased statewide program to strengthen and improve infrastructure at state border check \nposts to strengthen overloading control, (ii) is undertaking a rigorous inspection at border check-\npost  locations,  and  (iii)  has  allocated  funds  for  10  electronic  weigh  bridges  and  surveillance \nmechanisms that MPRDC installed at the state borders and key locations on the road network \nunder the MPSRSDP (footnote 1). Private investors are being invited to install weigh bridges at \n26 other locations; GOMP will provide state support for their operation. As an added precaution \nagainst  enforcement  officers\u2019  laxity  and  corruption,  closed-circuit  television  cameras  are  being \ninstalled  and  connected  by  satellites  to  the  nearest  road  transport  offices,  allowing  weighing \noperations to be monitored remotely. Collection of the composition fee has increased as a result \nof these efforts: in 2004/05, it was 27% higher than in 2003/04, and in 2005/06, 60% higher than \n\nControl of Overloading \n\ne. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB.  2002.

GOMP recently increased the composition fee by more than 100%, thus sensitizing \ntruck  operators  and  discouraging  them  from  plying  overloaded  trucks.  In  November  2005,  the \nSupreme Court of India passed a judgment banning overloading of trucks to prevent premature \ndamage  to  roads,  and  mandated  that  excess  cargo  be  offloaded  at  the  risk  and  cost  of  the \nvehicle owner before the truck would be permitted to continue its journey, even after payment of \nthe penalty. GOMP\u2019s efforts are expected to eventually reduce vehicle overloading. \n \n25. \ndevelopment action plan (Appendix 3). \n \n \n \nThe road sector in India has received substantial external assistance in the recent past. \n26. \nADB has provided loans and TA amounting to about $3.4 billion. The World Bank has provided \nloans  and  grants  amounting  to  $5.6  billion  to  upgrade  national  highways,  improve  state \nhighways,  and  upgrade  rural  roads.  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  (JBIC)  has \nprovided  five  loans  amounting  to  $0.33  billion  to  upgrade  national  highways  and  construct \nbridges. The government of the United Kingdom has provided TA support for the sector. ADB\u2019s \nsupport  for  the  road  sector  has  been  developed  in  close  collaboration  with  these  key  players. \nCoordination  with  the  World  Bank  has  particularly  been  active  for  transport.  Mini-retreats  for \ntransport operations in the South Asia region have become a regular practice for headquarters \nstaff.  For  the  resident  missions,  a  broad-based  sector  collaboration  mechanism  has  been \ninstituted  to  facilitate  the  exchange  of  information  between  key  sector  coordinators  of  both \ninstitutions. With the Japanese Government and JBIC, cooperation has been active, particularly \nfor  railway  and  urban  sectors.  ADB  has  formed  a  close  partnership  with  the  Department  for \nInternational Development (United Kingdom) in the provision of TA for areas that contribute to \npoverty  reduction  in  India.  The  two  organizations  regularly  hold  coordination  meetings.  A \nsummary of external assistance is in Appendix 4. \n \n27. \nSince  2002,  ADB  has  provided  three  loans  to  improve  India\u2019s  state  road  network\u2014to \nMadhya  Pradesh  in  2002,  Chhattisgarh  in  2003,  and  Uttaranchal  in  2006.  Other  state  road \nprojects  under  preparation  for  the  eight  northeastern  states  are  in  the  2007  pipeline;  and  the \nsecond  project  for  Chhattisgarh  and  the  first  for  Jharkhand,  both  of  which  are  in  the  2008 \npipeline. In principle, ADB provides support to improve state road sector management capacity \nalong with physical investment to improve the state road network. The first loan demonstrated \nmajor sector reform achievements, including establishment of MPRDC and its adoption of best \nfinancial  management,  and  public \npractices \nprocurement.  GOMP  requested  the  proposed  Project  based  on  the  substantial  progress  with \nsector  reforms  under  the  first  ADB  assistance  (footnote  1)  to  pursue  sector  development  and \nimprove the state road network. \n \n \n \n28.  Many ongoing ADB-financed road sector projects in India are experiencing delays. The \nMPSRSDP  is  no  exception.  These  delays  are  mostly  attributable  to  (i)  lack  of  safeguard \nconsideration  in  selecting  and  preparing  investment,  and  insufficient  support  in  safeguards \nplanning  and  implementation;  and  (ii)  the  gap  in  support  between  the  feasibility  phase  and \nconstruction  to  executing  agencies,  which  are  often  not  familiar  with  ADB  procedures  in \nprocurement of civil works contracts and recruitment of consultants. \n \n\nfor  planning  and  maintenance  systems, \n\nLessons \n\n3. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\n29.  MPRDC  acquired  substantial  experience  under  the  MPSRSDP.  GOMP  engaged \ndetailed  project  report  consultants  to  prepare  projects  and  asked  ADB  for  TA7 to  support  the \npreconstruction  activities  of  MPRDC  so  that  the  construction  can  be  commenced  without \nunnecessary delay after loan approval. MPRDC took actions to facilitate advance clearance of \nquarry  sites  and  utility  shifting,  and  will  have  the  supervision  consultants  involved  in  finalizing \ndrawings.  GOMP  also  initiated  advance  actions  for  contracting  such  as  engagement  of \nconstruction  supervision  consultants  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents.  GOMP  further \ntakes  policy  initiatives  for  speedy  completion  of  construction  works  such  as  regular  monthly \ndistrict review meetings to expeditiously resolve issues encountered during implementation. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n30. \nThe  Project  will  improve  transport  efficiency  of  the  state  road  network,  which  will \ncontribute to expansion of economic opportunities and poverty reduction. This will be realized by \n(i)  improving  the  state  road  network,  (ii)  facilitating  safe  and  appropriate  road  usage,  (iii) \nincreasing  efficiency  of  transport  services,  and  (iv)  enhancing  GOMP  capacity  for  road  asset \ndevelopment and management. Improved roads will improve accessibility to social services and \nmarkets,  and  enhance  the  efficiency  of  road  transport  usage.  With  the  central  location  of  the \nstate in the country, the Project will improve transport efficiency for the rest of India.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nthe  Project \n\nimprovement  works  under \n\nInvestment Component. The Project will rehabilitate and reconstruct about 1,800 km of \n31. \nstate roads identified under the state road rehabilitation program, which identifies about 10,000 \nkm  of  state  roads  for  rehabilitation and  improvement.  During  feasibility  studies,  GOMP  initially \nselected  more  than  4,000  km  of  state  roads,  and  a  list  of  about  1,800  km  of  state  roads  was \nidentified  for  the  Project,  taking  into  account  preliminary  assessment  of  traffic  volume,  social \nand  environmental  impacts,  improvement  to  the  overall  state  road  network,  state  priority,  and \nproject  readiness  (Appendix  5).  Road \ninclude \nrehabilitating  and  improving  existing  roads;  strengthening  existing  culverts  and  bridges,  and \nconstructing new bridges and cross-drainage structures. Based on the feasibility study and the \nproject  selection  and  prioritization  report,  the  candidate  subprojects  will  be  reviewed  and \napproved in accordance with a set of selection criteria (Appendix 6). Consulting services will be \nprovided to support implementation of the civil works.   \n \n32. \nInstitutional Development Component. The Project will provide equipment necessary \nfor  GOMP  to  enhance  sector  capacity,  such  as  road  safety  and  control  of  overloading.  Major \nequipment includes those for safety training, vehicle fitness testing, and weigh bridges. A TA will \nbe  attached  to  the  loan  to  support  GOMP  initiatives  of  sector  development,  especially  for \nMPPWD reform and capacity building, including  (i) enhancing planning capacity, (ii) improving \nbusiness  processes,  (iii)  improving  human  resources  management,  and  (iv)  increasing  private \nsector participation. The detailed institutional development action plan is set out in Appendix 3. \nThe consultants will identify the specification and timing of other equipment required during TA \nimplementation. \n \n\n                                                 \n7   A component TA of $250,000 for project preparation support for the Project was provided under the TA Cluster to \nIndia  for  Project  Processing  and  Capacity  Development  (ADB.  2006.    Technical  Assistance  Cluster  to  India  for \nProject Processing and Capacity Development. Manila.) \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nfinancing; \n\nincorporating  ADB\u2019s \n\n33. \nThe  Project  was  prepared  with  the  enhanced  capacity  of  MPRDC,  which  has  been \ngained through MPSRSDP preparation and implementation, and ADB TA provided for capacity \nbuilding of MPRDC. MPRDC engaged detailed project report consultants with its own funds for \npossible  ADB \nrequirement  of  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental  studies  into  the  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  GOMP  asked  ADB  for  TA  to \nsupplement the detailed project report consultants\u2019 work to fully comply with ADB requirements. \nEngineering design is prepared to minimize social and environmental impacts. Advance actions \nhave been taken to ensure that the construction can be commenced without unnecessary delay. \nAll  of  these  are  enabled  by  MPRDC\u2019s  familiarity  with  ADB  procedures  and  requirements,  and \nMPRDC\u2019s enhanced capacity for project planning and implementation, which improved project \nreadiness,  mitigating  the  risk  of  delay.  The  Project  demonstrates  the  success  in  capacity \ndevelopment of MPRDC in preparing and implementing state road projects. \n \n34. \nThe  major  constraints  of  the  road  sector  in  Madhya  Pradesh  are  (i)  limited  physical \nnetwork of roads in terms of coverage and conditions, and (ii) limited resources of road sector \ninstitutions against the requirement of providing a road network in the vast area of the state. The \nfirst ADB assistance, the MPSRSDP, established MPRDC to manage the strategically important \nstate  road  network  by  adopting  modern  business  practices  for  road  asset  development  and \nmanagement.  MPRDC  is  now  regarded  as  the  benchmark  for  good  practice  in  managing  the \nstate road network. By adopting the sector loan modality, the Project provides an opportunity to \nextend  the  capacity  development  efforts  to  MPPWD,  enabling  overall  sector  capacity  to  be \nenhanced in conjunction with improvements to the physical road network. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n35. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $400  million,  including  taxes,  duties, \ncommitment  charges,  and  interest  during  construction  (Table  1).  The  detailed  cost  estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 7.   \n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounta\n\n \n\n1. \n2. \n \n\nInvestment Component \nInstitutional Development Component \nSubtotal (A) \n\nItem \nA.

The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per  annum,  and  such  other \nterms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  Government  has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices \nwere  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on any  communication  or  advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n37. \nADB will finance 80% of the total project cost, taking into account that (i) the Project is \npart  of  the  $1.1  billion  Madhya  Pradesh  state  roads  rehabilitation  program  for  2006\u20132009, \nexcluding  projects  under  National  Highway  Development  Program  (NHDP),  PMGSY,  and \nMPSRSDP;  (ii)  ADB  provided  a  loan  under  the  MPSRSDP  with  ADB  cost  sharing  at  57.4% \n($150 million of the total project cost of $261.2 million), which has not encountered any issues of \ncounterpart funding with 42.6% government sharing; (iii) the Project is part of ADB assistance to \nthe  Government\u2019s  overall  development  program  for  the  road  sector,  including  the  NHDP-III \n($12.5 billion by 2012) and PMGSY ($11 billion by 2009); (iv) 20 projects have been approved \nso far at the final stage of the current country strategy and program period (2003\u20132007), and the \naggregate ADB financing will not exceed the ADB\u2019s country cost-sharing ceiling of 70% during \nthat period; (v) state road development is the priority for ADB assistance in India and the Project \nserves  less-developed  areas  in  one  of  the  poorest  states;  and  (vi)  the  higher  cost  sharing  by \nADB helps the fiscal reforms of the state. \n \n38. \nThe Government will provide the loan proceeds in local currency to GOMP on the same \nterms and conditions as received from ADB. GOMP will bear the foreign exchange risk on the \nloan.

MPRDC is \n39. \nwholly owned by GOMP and was originally established as the project management unit for the \nMPSRSDP.  It  has  been  equipped  with  capacity  to  implement  the  Project.  The  Project  will  be \nimplemented based on the organizational structure indicated in Appendix 8. The chief engineer \nfor  project \nat  MPRDC  headquarters  will  be  designated  as \nimplementation.  The  Environmental  Cell  at  MPRDC  headquarters,  reporting  to  the  chief \nengineer,  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  social  safeguards  and  engineering \n\nthe  \u201cproject \n\nin  charge\u201d \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\naspects  of  subprojects.  Seven  project  implementation  units,  located  in  the  divisions,  each \nheaded  by  a  divisional  manager  will  be  responsible  for  subproject  implementation  in  the  field. \nOne or two full-time project managers will be assigned for each contract package. The divisional \nmanagers  will  be  delegated  adequate  technical  and  administrative  authority  for  expeditious \nproject  implementation.  Construction  supervision  consultants  engaged  by  MPRDC  will  act  as \nthe engineer for the construction contracts.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n40. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  inclusive  of  procurement  and \npreconstruction  activities  in  2007,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  30  June  2010.  The \nimplementation schedule is included in Appendix 9.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n41. \nProcurement  to  be  financed  from  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  civil  works  have \nbeen packaged into a number of contracts in accordance with the geographic location and size \nof the contracts. The civil works contracts will be undertaken in 15 contract packages (Appendix \n10).  All  these  contracts  are  estimated  at  more  than  $10  million  and  will  be  procured  through \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. ADB standard bidding documents for large works \nwith  postqualification  under  the  two-envelope  system  will  be  adopted.  Equipment  financed \nunder  the  Project  will  be  $1  million  under  the  institutional  development  component,  and \nprocured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures  if  the  estimated  contract  is \nbetween $0.1 million and $1 million, and shopping if the estimated contract amount is less than \n$0.1 million. Contract packaging for equipment will be based on required technical features and \ntiming  of  procurement;  the  TA  consultants  will  finalize  detailed  specifications  and  identify  the \npackages during TA implementation. The procurement plan is in Appendix 11. NCB procedures \nadopted for procurement of goods and services under the Project will use the advertised tender \nenquiry  method  stipulated  in  the  Government\u2019s  General  Financial  Rules,8 as  reflected  in  the \nprocurement plan. Any modifications to the procurement plan will be subject to prior approval by \nADB. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n42.  MPRDC will select two internationally recruited consulting firms to supervise construction \nof civil works under the Project. One consultant will be engaged for Bhopal region and the other \nfor  Jabalpur  region.  MPRDC  will  select  and  engage  the  consultants  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and \ncost-based  selection  procedures  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (using the full technical proposal method) as reflected in the procurement plan. The \noutline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  for  construction  supervision  are  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. About 56 person-months of international and 1,760 person-months \nof national consultants are expected to be required. \n \n\n5. \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\n43. \nThe  process  of  advance  contracting  has  been  initiated  for  recruiting  construction \nsupervision  consultants  as  normal  procedures.  ADB  management  has  approved  advance \n\n                                                 \n8   Compilation of General Financial Rules (2005) and Compendium of Rules on Advances to Government Servants \n\nalong with circulars, Government decisions, and other relevant materials, Nabhi Publication, 2006. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\ncontracting  of  civil  works.  The  Government  has  been  informed  that  approval  of  advance \nprocurement action does not in any way commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n44. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government,  GOMP,  and  MPRDC.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations  and  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n45. \nUnder the MPSRSDP, MPRDC was created to provide efficient project implementation, \nadopting  international  best  practices  for  asset  management  systems,  financial  management \nsystems,  and  procurement  procedures.  Roads  under  public-private  partnership  schemes  have \nincreased  to  1,500 km. MPRDC  discloses  its  activities  including  information  of  tender  call  and \nproject implementation to the public through its website. GOMP also takes initiatives to improve \ngovernance in MPPWD, including a recent major step of abolishing a letter-of-credit system to \nstreamline administrative procedures for transparent, effective, and efficient use of the allocated \nbudget. The efficiency of the road maintenance budget has also been improved and is closely \nmonitored.  To  enhance  overall  road  sector  management,  a  TA  will  be  attached  to  the  loan  to \nprovide  institutional  strengthening  of  MPPWD,  which  will  improve  governance  in  road \nadministration  and  accountability,  and  create  an  environment  encouraging  competition  and \nefficiency within MPPWD and the construction industry. \n \n\n7. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n46. \nLoan  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Direct  payment  and  reimbursement  procedures  will  be \nused  for  civil  works,  consulting  services,  and  equipment.  Any  individual  payment  to  be \nreimbursed under statement of expenditure procedures will not exceed $100,000. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n47. \nFor  the  Project,  MPRDC  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  expenditures  incurred,  and \nuse of local funds under the project components and their subprojects. The accounts will be set \nup  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  Independent  private  sector  auditors, \nacceptable  to  ADB,  will  audit  MPRDC\u2019s  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  annually. \nMPRDC  will  submit  the  audited  reports  to  ADB  within  9  months  of  the  close  of  each  financial \nyear. \n \n48.  MPRDC will prepare and provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on progress made \nduring the review period, changes if any of the implementation schedule, problems or difficulties \nencountered  and  remedial  actions  taken,  anticipated  problems  and  proposed  remedial \nmeasures, and work to be undertaken in the following period. MPRDC will submit the quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB within 45 days from the close of each quarter. These reports will also \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\ninclude  a  summary  financial  account  for  each  subproject,  expenditures  to  date,  report  on \nperformance monitoring, and the results of monitoring of the social and environmental impacts. \n \n49.  MPRDC  will  prepare  and  provide  ADB  with  a  subproject  completion  report  within  3 \nmonths  of  physical  completion  of  each  individual  subproject,  and  a  project  completion  report \nwithin  3  months  of  completion  of  transactions  under  the  Project.  These  reports  will  include  a \ndetailed  evaluation  of  subprojects  and  the  overall  Project,  respectively,  covering  the  design, \ncosts,  contractor  and  consultant  performance,  social  and  economic  impact,  economic  rate  of \nreturn, and other details relating to the Project as may be requested by ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n50.  MPRDC  will,  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  develop  a  systematic  project \nperformance monitoring system, in a form and substance acceptable to ADB, for use throughout \nthe life of the Project. \n \nThe  project  performance  monitoring  system  will  follow  the  baseline  for  performance \n51. \nindicators to be used for monitoring implementation of each subproject. In accordance with the \nsystem, MPRDC will conduct evaluation surveys annually under each subproject to evaluate the \nscope, implementation arrangements, progress, and achievements of project objectives. \n \n\n10. \n\nProject Review \n\n52. \nADB  and  GOMP  will  meet  regularly  as  required  to  discuss  project  progress  and  any \nchanges  to  implementation  arrangements  or  remedial  measures  required  to  achieve  the \nobjectives of the subprojects and Project. In January 2009, ADB, the Government, GOMP, and \nMPRDC will undertake a midterm review of the Project. The review will focus on issues related \nto  implementation  arrangements,  and  agreement  on  changes,  if  needed,  to  achieve  the \nobjectives of the Project. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nA  TA  for  $1,000,000  for  Institutional  Strengthening  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Public \n53. \nWorks Department will be provided to support GOMP\u2019s sector development initiatives set out in \nthe  action  plan  (Appendix  3).  The  objective  is  to  strengthen  MPPWD\u2019s  capacity  in  road  asset \ndevelopment  and  management.  During  TA  implementation,  MPPWD  will  be  equipped  with  (i) \nnorm-based planning and budgeting, (ii) improved business practices, and (iii) improved human \nresources management. An alternative realigned structure of the state\u2019s road sector institutions \nwill  be  proposed  for  long-term  road  sector  reform.  The  previous  ADB-financed  TA  for \nInstitutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for the Madhya Pradesh State Road Sector in \n2002 successfully developed the capacity of MPRDC, which adopted best practices of planning \nand  maintenance  systems,  financial  management,  and  procurement.  The  proposed  TA  will \nmake  recommendations  to  modernize  MPPWD\u2019s  operations,  adopting  MPRDC  technologies \nand practices in the context of the MPPWD environment. MPPWD will be the Executing Agency \nfor the TA. \n \n54. \nThe  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment  of  Japan,  and  be  carried  out  by  an  international  consulting  firm,  to  be  recruited \nusing  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (using the simplified technical proposal method). The TA \nwill  be  implemented  during  12  months  from  October  2007  to  September  2008.  International \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nconsulting inputs of about 30 person-months and national inputs of about 40 person-months are \nrequired. Terms of reference for the TA are in Supplementary Appendix B. Major equipment to \nbe purchased includes computers and software for project management, financial management, \nand  road  asset  management.  The  TA  consultants  will  identify  the  specification  and  timing  of \nother equipment required. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nEconomic Assessment \n\nInstitutional and Operational Improvements \n\nA. \n \n55. \nImproving management of the state road network through the institutional development \ncomponent  and  the  TA,  and  improvement  of  the  road  network  under  the  Project  will  enhance \nthe overall road condition and usability, thus increasing travel speeds and reducing travel time, \naccidents, and overloading. The enhancement of MPPWD\u2019s capacity in road asset development \nand management will improve governance in road administration and accountability, and create \nan environment encouraging competition and efficiency within MPPWD and in the construction \nindustry. This will ensure more efficient road asset development and management, and higher \nquality  of  construction  and  maintenance,  resulting  in  decreased  recurrent  costs  over  the \nmedium and long term. These will lead to overall social and economic development in Madhya \nPradesh. \n \nB. \n \n56. \nThe  approach  used  to  evaluate  the  Project  follows  the  standard  practice  of  comparing \nlife-cycle road agency and user costs with and without the Project, using net present value with \na  12%  discount  rate  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  decision  criteria.  The \nHighway  Development  and  Management  Model,  HDM-4,  was  used  for  the  analysis.  The \nanalysis focuses on savings in transport costs. Value added from better transport links resulting \nin  new  industries and  employment  are  not  quantified in  this  analysis  but  are  captured  through \nbenefits to generated traffic.  \n \n57. \nThe EIRR for the roads evaluated varied between 13% and 49%. The Project will be for \nthe  state  road  sector  rather  than  for  individual  roads.  While  the  Project  as  a  whole  is  robust, \nsome  individual  roads  are  marginal.  Options  such  as  reducing  the  formation  width  could  be \nconsidered if the costs turn out higher than anticipated at the detailed design stage. \n \nThe sensitivity of the EIRR for the project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in \n58. \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i) \nconstruction costs increase by 15%; (ii) no time saving; (iii) benefits decrease by 15%; and (iv) \n50% reduction to generated traffic in addition to a combination of (i) and (iii). The results show \nthat the quantified economic benefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. Three of the roads \nhave an EIRR below 12% in some of the sensitivity analysis cases. The EIRRs in these cases \nrange  from  9.9  %  to  11.6%,  marginally  below  12%.  These  three  roads  serve  relatively  less-\ndeveloped  areas  of  the  state  and  their  improvement  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the \ndevelopment  of  these  areas.  Considering  their  positive  development  impact  and  the  fact  that \neven in the worst case sensitivity scenario, they have an EIRR more than 9%, these three roads \nare  recommended  for  implementation  under  the  Project  along  with  all  other  roads  included  in \nthe analysis. Details of the economic assessment are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancial Sustainability \n\nC. \n \n59. \nIncremental recurrent costs associated with the Project are estimated at 7%\u20138% of the \ncurrent  MPPWD  maintenance  budget  and  2%  of  the  overall  MPPWD  budget  on  an  annual \nbasis.  The  maintenance  will  be  required  after  project  completion  in  2010  and  the  appropriate \nbudget  increase  is  expected,  considering  the  trend  in  recent  years.  Funds  are  expected  to  be \navailable  to  meet  these  costs.  For  financially  viable  road  sections,  MPRDC  will  apply  the \nmaintenance,  operate,  and  transfer  scheme  to  finance  maintenance  outside  of  the  GOMP \nbudget. \n \nD. \n \n\nSocial Impacts \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Impact \n\n \n60.  Madhya  Pradesh  is  one  of  the  most  economically  backward  states  in  the  country  with \n37.06% people living below the poverty line, significantly higher than India\u2019s average of 27.09%. \nThe  estimated  annual  per  capita  income  of  those  living  below  the  poverty  line  in  the  state  is \nRs3,889.32 (less than $90). The state also ranks low in terms of the human development index, \nwhich is 0.394 in comparison to the national value of 0.472.  \n \nAn  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation  on \n61. \nthe  core  sample  subproject.  The  assessment  indicates  that  agriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  the \npeople  in  the  area,  with  the  majority  deriving  their  livelihood  from  agriculture  and  labor  (both \nagricultural and nonagricultural). In some subproject sections, mainly towns and marketplaces, \nsome  depend  on  small  trade  and  business  for  their  livelihood.  Seasonal  migration  to \nneighboring districts and states for employment is a common feature with a number of sample \nhouseholds  (21%  of  the  surveyed  households)  in  the  subproject  villages  migrating  for  2\u20133 \nmonths  to  work  on  construction  sites  and  other  nonagricultural  wage  labor  opportunities.  The \nconsiderable  range  between  high  and  low  income  groups  and  high  incidence  of  poverty,  in \nkeeping  with  the  state  data,  is  reflected  in  the  sample  subproject  area  with  42%  of  the  total \nsample households covered during the socioeconomic survey comprising poor households.   \n \nThe  Project  will  rehabilitate  the  deteriorated  and  damaged  state  roads  of  Madhya \n62. \nPradesh  to  provide  reliable  road  transport  services.  The  Project  is  expected  to  stimulate \neconomic growth and human development in the  state by  improving access to socioeconomic \nservices  and  providing  a  better  quality  of  life  for  project  beneficiaries  in  the  long  term.  A \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n\n2.  \n\nGender \n\n \n63.  Madhya  Pradesh  ranks  28th  among  other  states  on  the  gender  disparity  index  with  a \nvalue  of  0.6629 in  comparison  to  the  national  average.10 The  gender  ratio  of  the  population  is \n920  females  for  every  1,000  males  (2001  census).  The  literacy  rate  is  64.11%;  76.80%  for \nmales and 50.28% for females (2001 census). Focus group discussions were undertaken with \nwomen from varying socioeconomic groups in the sample subproject. The assessment identified \nthat women in most socioeconomic groups are disadvantaged by their low status in households \nand  communities  in  terms  of  access  and  control,  which  are  among  the  significant  reasons  for \n\n                                                 \n9   National Planning Commission, Government of India. 2001. National Human Development Report. New Delhi.  \n10  India,  with  a  gender  disparity  index  value  of  0.574,  ranks  103rd  in  the  World  (United  Nations  Development \n\nProgramme. 2003. Human Development Indicators. New York.) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nwhy  women  are  constrained  from  actively  participating  in  society  consequently  hampering  the \nprocess of their empowerment and development. \n \n64. \nThe  Project  will  have  positive  impacts  on  both  men  and  women,  and  offer  special \nbenefits  to  women  by  increasing  the  opportunity  for  girls  to  access  higher  education,  and  the \naccess  of  women  and  children  to  improved  local  services  and  higher  levels  of  health  care \noutside the village.  \n \n\n3. \n\nHIV/AIDS \n\n4. \n\nHuman Trafficking \n\n65. \nIndia is on the brink of one of the biggest public health challenges in its history. National \nAids  Control  Organization  statistics  report  HIV/AIDS  estimates  for  India  for  2004  as  5.134 \nmillion infections, and note that HIV infection is typically concentrated among poor, marginalized \ngroups,  including  sex  workers,  drug  users,  migrant  laborers,  and  truck  drivers  who  are \ncategorized  as  \u201chigh  risk  groups.\u201d  These  groups,  particularly  truckers,  drive  the  HIV/AIDS \nepidemic and many studies indicate that infection is spreading rapidly to the general population. \nMadhya  Pradesh,  categorized  as  a  \u201clow  prevalence  state\u201d  with  regard  to  HIV/AIDS,  officially \nreported  1,729  cases  of  infection  as  of  August  2006.11 The  detailed  study  undertaken  during \nproject preparation did not anticipate any risks of increased HIV/AIDS as a result of the Project. \nIn  addition,  state,  district,  and  block  campaigns  by  the  health  department  and  state  AIDS \nControl  Society  are  being  undertaken  to  increase  awareness  of  the  disease.  Interactions  with \nthe chief medical health officer, AIDS counsellors, and block medical officers in the core sample \nsubproject  indicate  that  annually  2\u20133  block  awareness  campaigns  are  organized  to  increase \nawareness of HIV/AIDS.  \n \n \n \n66. \nDuring  the  detailed  study  undertaken  during  project  preparation,  one  of  the  key \ncomponents was to assess the current status of human trafficking risks in the subproject areas \nand  project  implications.  Semistructured  interactions  were  undertaken  with  different  key \nstakeholders such as village head, men\u2019s and women\u2019s groups, village school teachers, as well \nas  with  district  and  block  government  personnel.  No  human  trafficking  risks  were  found  in  the \narea; none of the stakeholders reported any cases during the course of the study. Further the \ncommunity  noted  that  due  to  the  sociocultural  setting  of  the  area  with  society  and  villages \nhaving very close social and cultural ties, trafficking risks have not been identified. In addition, \nthough  migration  remains  a  common  phenomenon  in  rural  areas,  this  is  largely  a  seasonal \nphenomenon  limited  to  searches  for  labor  opportunities  to  nearby  growth  centers  to  work  on \nconstruction  sites  and  other  nonagricultural  wage  labor  to  sustain  livelihoods.  Both  the \ncommunity  consultations  and  socioeconomic  survey  in  the  subproject  area  identified  that  for \nmigrating  families,  generally  the  men  seasonally  migrate  without  women  and  children  thereby \nfurther reducing the possibility of trafficking via migration. Since all the subprojects are existing \nstate roads, the proposed augmentation is not expected to lead to human trafficking in the area.    \n \n\n5. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n \n67.  Madhya  Pradesh,  as  per  the  Census  of  India  2001,  has  a  population  of  12,233,474 \nscheduled tribe members, constituting 20.3% of the total state population compared to 8.2% of \nthe  national  population.  Some  presence  of  indigenous  peoples  groups  such  as  \u2013  Gonds  and \nBaiga was noted on the sample subproject section passing through districts of Dindori, Mandla, \n\n                                                 \n11  Source: National AIDS Control Organization. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\n \n\nand  Seoni.  However,  since  the  Project  entails  rehabilitation  of  existing  road  alignments,  the \nsocial  assessments  have  not  identified  any  adverse  impact  on  tribal  groups  within  the  area  of \ninfluence of the project road. The assessment also notes that indigenous groups in the project \narea have been mainstreamed and assimilated into the local population. The study undertaken \nindigenous  and \nindicate  differential \nfor  project  preparation  did  not \nnonindigenous groups in project locations. The improved road network is expected to augment \naccess  to  socioeconomic  facilities  of  tribal  groups  along  with  other  sections  of  the  subproject \npopulation.  The  subproject  construction  will  not  have  any  adverse  consequences  on \nsocioeconomic conditions and will not result in any disruption of their community life or culture of \ntheir communities. \n \n68. \nAn  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  was  prepared  for  the  Project  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) (Supplementary Appendix D) to be \nused if an indigenous peoples development plan is required.   \n \n\nimpacts  between \n\n6. \n\nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n\n \n69. \nThe  Project  entails  rehabilitation  of  existing  state  roads,  which  will  occur  within  the \navailable right-of-way; no land acquisition is expected. The project design avoids or minimizes \nthe  need  for  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  by  adopting  the  most  feasible \ntechnical design.  \n \n70. \nThe sample subproject was assessed for involuntary resettlement impact. Due diligence \nwas undertaken based on the preliminary designs and confirmed that the sample subproject will \nnot entail any involuntary resettlement and land acquisition impact.  \n \n71. \nA resettlement framework has been prepared for the Project, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), to address any adverse resettlement impacts on assets \nsuch as land, structures, and cultural assets arising during detailed design and construction of \nthe sample subproject and for additional subprojects. Short resettlement plans (RPs), if required \nfor future subprojects, will be prepared in accordance with the agreed resettlement framework \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E).  MPRDC  will  ensure  that  under  contracts  for  civil  works  no \ncontractor  will  commence  construction  or  displace  people  until  those  affected  have  been \ncompensated in accordance with the resettlement plan acceptable to ADB. RP approval will be \nobtained prior to award of civil works contracts. MPRDC will translate all RPs under the Project \ninto local language and distributed them to the people affected. The RPs will also be posted on \nADB and MPRDC websites. Any changes to RPs based on detailed designs will also be subject \nto prior approval by ADB. \n \nE. \n \n72. \nThe  overall  environment  categorization  for  the  Project  is  B.  However,  if  during \nimplementation any subproject selected will pass through national parks, sanctuaries, or other \nareas designated as environmentally sensitive, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) must \nbe  completed  for  the  subproject  following  the  procedure  described  in  the  environmental \nassessment review framework (EARF) (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n73. \nThe overall Project is not expected to have adverse environmental impacts as shown in \nthe findings of the initial environmental examination (IEE) of the sample subproject. This sample \nsubproject  was  selected  as  about  38  km  of  its  190  km  length  (about  20%)  passes  through \nseveral  pacts  of  forested  areas.  The  subproject  IEE  provides  a  picture  of  all  potential  generic \n\nEnvironmental Impacts \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nRisks \n\nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  civil  works  of  the  Project  and  the  recommended \nmitigation  measures  for  the  sample  subproject,  which  could  be  adopted  for  follow-up \nsubprojects.  The  IEE  duly  shows  that  the  environmental  impact  will  mostly  occur  during \nconstruction  and  is  mostly  due  to  clearing  for  widening  the  carriageway,  construction  work \nrelated to compaction of the embankment and cut and fill, as well as from quarrying to support \nconstruction activities. The carriageway clearing is not expected to affect the forested area since \nthe available right-of-way has been 10\u201330 meters. The environmental impacts are all temporary \nand therefore, a further EIA is not required. Adequate mitigation measures have been provided \nand  are  summarized  in  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The  EMP  for  this \nsubproject  was  prepared  to  guide  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures.  MPRDC  will  be \nresponsible for implementing overall mitigation measures with some to be implemented by the \ncontractors, especially mitigation measures during construction. The new Environmental Cell of \nMPRDC  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  EMP  implementation.  The  summary  IEE,  including \nthe EMP matrix, is presented in Supplementary Appendix G.  \n \n74. \nThe  environmental  assessment  of  the  follow-up  subprojects  will  be  prepared  and \nreviewed by following the procedure described in the EARF (Supplementary Appendix F). The \nEARF was formulated to ensure that follow-up subprojects will be prepared to comply with the \nGovernment and state laws and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). \n \nF. \n \n75. \nA  draft  sector  assistance  program  evaluation  identified  issues  of  state  road  projects  in \nIndia, including (i) initial delays in implementation, (ii) risk of incomplete network development by \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  (iii) \ntotal  avoidance  of \nappropriateness of sector development framework, and (iv) a need for government discipline to \nefficiently and effectively secure the maintenance budget.  \n \nThe risk of initial delays has already been mitigated through MPRDC\u2019s advance actions \n76. \nand  TA  provided  by  ADB  (Supplementary  Appendix  H).  MPRDC  is  now  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  and  procedures  based  on  substantial  experience  gained  through  MPSRSDP \npreparation and implementation. Training on safeguard requirements was provided to MPRDC \nstaff  to  mitigate  potential  risk  of  initial  delays  due  to  procedural  clearance.  TA  also  provided \nsupport to due diligence for subproject approval. \n \n77. \nProject roads were identified in accordance with strategic importance and the state road \nrehabilitation  program.  The  Project  will  minimize/nullify  any  negative  social  and  environmental \nimpacts through appropriate engineering design, which is possible as no populated areas have \nbeen  identified  along  the  project  roads.  In  addition,  frameworks  for  safeguarding  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  have  been  set  up  so  that  network  development  will  be  ensured  while \nminimizing/nullifying  negative  impacts  on  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nsocial and environmental aspects. \n \n78. \nThe risk of an unrealistic sector reform agenda has been mitigated by reflecting the state \ncontext in the institutional strengthening action plan by taking into account the rather short-term \nproject duration, actions taken by GOMP, and recent GOMP policy recommendations.  \n \n79. \nthe \nrequirement  since  the  current  fiscal  year  2006/07  especially  due  to  the  provision  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  grant-in-aide  under  the  12th  Finance  Commission.  The  risk  of  inefficient  and \n\nits  maintenance  budget,  which  substantially  covers \n\nGOMP  has \n\nincreased \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\n \n\nineffective maintenance budget will be mitigated by implementing budget monitoring systems for \nfull utilization and road management systems for better planning and budgeting through the TA. \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nImplementation \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government,  GOMP,  and  MPRDC  have \n\n80. \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \nA. \n \n81. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  GOMP  and  MPRDC  and  other  agencies  at  state  level \nundertake  activities  and  respective  responsibilities  and  assurances  given,  to  achieve  the \nobjectives of the Project in a timely manner.  \n \n82. \nGOMP will ensure that MPRDC and other agencies at state level undertake activities and \nrespective  responsibilities  and  assurances  given,  to  achieve  the  objectives  of  the  Project  in  a \ntimely manner.  \n \n83. \n \nB. \n \n84. \nGOMP  will  implement  measures  included  in  the  institutional  development  action  plan \nduring  the  project  implementation  period  and  also  implement  the  agreed  recommendations  of \nthe TA for institutional strengthening of MPPWD, in a timely manner. \n \n85. \nmechanism is available to MPRDC for maintenance of the roads improved under the Project. \n \nC. \n\nThe  Government  and  GOMP  will  ensure  that  adequate  and  timely  funding  or  other \n\nGOMP will provide timely and adequate counterpart funds for the Project.  \n\nSubproject Selection Criteria and Implementation \n\nSector Development and Road Maintenance  \n\nGOMP  through  MPRDC  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  meet  and  are  implemented,  to \n\n86. \nthe satisfaction of ADB, in accordance with the provisions set forth in Appendix 6. \n\nEnvironmental Considerations \n\nGOMP through MPRDC will ensure that: \n\nD. \n \n87. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nlaws  and  regulations  of \n\nthe  Project  is  carried  out  and  all  project/subproject  facilities  are  designed, \nconstructed,  operated,  maintained,  and  monitored  in  compliance  with  the \nthe  Government,  GOMP,  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental \nEnvironment Policy (2002), and the EARF (Supplementary Appendix F); \nan IEE or EIA report as required will be prepared, including an EMP with budget \nidentifying  the  cost  of  its  implementation  (as  incorporated  in  the  related \nfor  each \nprocurement  bid  document),  with  adequate  public  consultation \nsubproject,  in  accordance  with  the  EARF.

The  reorganized  state  of  Madhya  Pradesh  came  into  existence  on  1  November \n2000 with 45 districts. The total geographic area of the state is now 308,000 square kilometers. \nIt  is  situated  in  the  very  heart  of  India  and  is  surrounded  by  five  states:  Chhattisgarh,  Gujarat, \nMaharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. \n \n2. \nBecause  of  the  state\u2019s  central  location,  traffic  from  surrounding  states  passes  through \nthe state road and rail network. Railways connecting north\u2013south and east\u2013west regions pass \nthrough  Madhya  Pradesh  with  a  total  length  of  about  5,900  kilometers  (km).  However,  due  to \nMadhya  Pradesh's  vast  area,  the  railway  services  cannot  provide  the  desired  connectivity  to \nmajor economic zones and centers. The railway network traversing Madhya Pradesh serves the \nneeds of cross-country traffic more than those of Madhya Pradesh. In total, 11 major districts in \nMadhya  Pradesh  have  little  rail  service.  Civil  aviation,  port,  and  inland  waterway  have  a  very \nlimited  role  in  the  state\u2019s  overall  economy  and  transport  services.  As  a  result,  roads  are  the \npredominant mode of transport services. \n \nA. \n \n3. \n \n\nIn 2006, the road network in Madhya Pradesh was as presented in Table A2.1. \n\nRoad Network and Traffic \n\nTable A2.1: Road Length in Madhya Pradesh \n\nNo.  Class of Road \n\n1  National Highways  \n2 \nState Highways  \n3  Major District Roads  \n4  Other District Roads/Village Roads  \n\n \n\nTotal Length  \n\nLength (km) \n4,286 \n8,728 \n10,817 \n48,590 \n72,421 \n\nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Madhya Pradesh Public Works Department Annual Administration Report 2005\u20132006,  \ncorrect as of March 2006. \n\n \n4. \nNot all roads are of the same type in terms of width or quality. If the type of road surface \nis taken as an indicator of quality, then most of the higher class of roads have been provided with \na  sealed  (bitumen  or  concrete)  surface  while  the  less  important  remain  unsealed  (metalled  or \ngravel). Table A2.2 shows the current status of the road network within the state. About 628 km \n(8%)  of  state  highways  and  1,607  km  of  major  district  roads  (15%)  remain  unsealed.  While \nsealing  all  roads  may  be  desirable,  the  implications  in  terms  of  the  huge  capital  investment \nrequirement and commitment for recurring maintenance expenditure require such decisions to be \ntaken on the basis of sound economic analysis. \n. \n\n\f24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\nTable A2.2: Distribution of Roads by Type of Surface \n(kilometers) \nSealed \n\nMetalled \n\nGravel \n\nNo.  Class of Road \n\nNational Highways \n1 \n2 \nState Highways \n3  Major District Roads \n4  Other District Roads/Village Roads \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n4,286 \n8,100 \n9,210 \n13,720 \n35,316 \n\n \n\n579 \n1,486 \n22,636 \n24,701 \n\n \n\n49 \n121 \n12,234 \n12,404 \n\nTotal \n\n4,286 \n8,728 \n10,817 \n48,590 \n72,421 \n\nSource: Madhya Pradesh Public Works Department Annual Administration Report 2005\u20132006, updated \nas of March 2007 for national highways and state highways. \n\n \n5. \nThe carrying capacity of a road is governed by its carriageway width. Building wide roads \nwhen not warranted by traffic density does not make economic sense. Consequently, nearly half \nthe state highways, most of the major district roads, and all other district roads are single lane. \nTable A2.3 indicates the distribution of roads by carriageway width. \n \n\nTable A2.3: Distribution of Roads by Carriageway Width (%) \n\nPercent of Road Length  \n\nNo.  Class of Road \n\n1 \nState Highways \n2  Major District Roads \nOther District Roads \n3 \n\nSingle \nLane \n52 \n90 \n100 \n\nIntermediate \nLane \n40 \n9 \n0 \n\nTwo or More \nLanes \n\n8 \n1 \n0 \n\nTotal \n\n100 \n100 \n100 \n\nSource: Madhya Pradesh Public Works Department \n\nInstitutions of State Roads Asset Management \n\n \n6. \nThe  number  of  motorized  vehicles  registered  increased  from  2.9  million  in  2001  to  4.2 \nmillion in 2005, representing an average 9.4% increase per year. Of 3.8 million motor vehicles \nregistered, 76% were two-wheelers. Other than two wheelers, 20% were cars and jeeps, 11% \ncommercial trucks, 2% buses and minibuses, and 43% tractors/trailers. Motor vehicles on roads \nincreased from 2.6 million in 2001 to 3.9 million in 2005, an average 10.2% increase per year. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nMadhya Pradesh Public Works Department (MPPWD) is responsible for the 72,000 km \nstate  road  network.  Madhya  Pradesh  Road  Development  Corporation  (MPRDC)  develops  and \nmanages  strategically  important  roads  including  all  state  highways,  some  national  highways, \nand major district roads delegated by MPPWD. MPRDC also implements all build-own-transfer \n(BOT)  roads  and  bridges.  The  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways  administers  national \nhighways, but delegates development and maintenance of these roads to MPPWD. The district \nadministrations manage other district roads and village roads. The Rural Engineering Service is \ninvolved in the construction of rural roads and other rural civil engineering works. The Madhya \nPradesh  Rural  Roads  Development  Authority  is  responsible for  developing  other  district  roads \nand  village  roads,  which  are  funded  through  special  schemes  initiated  by  the  central \nGovernment.  \n \n \n \n8. \nMPPWD is responsible for the construction and maintenance of public buildings, roads, \nand  other  works  on  behalf  of  the  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  (GOMP).  The  engineer-in-\n\nMPPWD \n\n1. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25\n\nchief is the technical head of the department and professional advisor to GOMP on policy and \nimplementation  related  to  public  works.  The  engineer-in-chief  reports  to  the  MPPWD  principal \nsecretary and secretary. MPPWD  is organized into six zones of which five are responsible for \nconstruction  and  maintenance  of  roads  including  other  district  roads  and  village  roads.  The \nzones are headed by chief engineers located at Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, and Rewa. \nThe  chief  engineers  are  responsible  for  policy  implementation  and  overall  supervision  of \nMPPWD administration at the zone level, and construction and maintenance of works within the \nzone. \n \n9. \nBefore  2000,  25  circle  offices  were  headed  by  superintending  engineers  in  the  zones. \nThey  were  responsible  for  supervision  of  the  district  division  offices  and  were  important  links \nbetween  the  districts  and  the  state.  After  these  offices  were  abolished  in  2000,  a  gap  in \nsupervision and coordination was noted. The circle offices have been reinstated. \n \n10. \nEach  circle  office  is  responsible  for  4\u20135  works  divisions.  Each  district  has  about  two \ndivisions; the current 45 districts have 83 divisions. The divisions are the basic operating units \nand  are  headed  by  executive  engineers,  who  are  responsible  for  management  of  works \nincluding  management  of  contracts  and  payment  for  works.  A  division  can  handle  an  annual \nworkload of about Rs10 crore.1 \n \nThe  divisions  are  divided  into  3\u20134  subdivisions;  the  state  has  264  subdivisions.  The \n11. \nsubdivisions  are  headed  by  assistant  engineers,  who  manage  and  supervise  works.  This \ninvolves  design  and  contract  management  including  quality  control  and  testing.  The  assistant \nengineers  are  required  to  check  the  quality  and  quantity  (measurement)  of  works,  and  are \nauthorized to make staged payments to contractors and labor. Under every subdivision are 4\u20136 \nsections  headed  by  subengineers,  who  are  the  basic  field  functionaries.  They  are  responsible \nfor  managing  actual  construction  activity  in  the  field,  taking  measurements,  giving  day-to-day \nguidance and reporting to the assistant engineer. \n \n12.  MPPWD also has an electrical and mechanical wing, which is responsible for installing \nand  maintaining  electricity  supply  in  public  buildings  and  maintaining  department  equipment \nincluding machinery for roads. The electrical and mechanical wing has 3 circles, 6 divisions, and \n48 subdivisions. \n \n13.  MPPWD \nis  a  well-organized  department  with  clearly  defined  duties  and \nresponsibilities  for  all  professional  staff;  (ii)  has  competent  and  qualified  engineers  and  other \nsupport staff to manage the road network and buildings in urban areas; (iii) has tools, plant, and \nadequate  staff  to  operate  and  maintain  them  in  working  condition;  and  (iv)  has  a  well-defined \naccounting  and  auditing  system  managed  under  the  overall  government  systems.  However, \nMPPWD requires improvements in certain areas including quality control, works management, \nand human resources development and management. \n \n14. \nQuality  Control.  Quality  control  of  works  is  the  responsibility  of  contractors  under  the \nsupervision of MPPWD staff. Contractors are responsible for establishing field laboratories and \ncarrying out mandatory tests for materials and quality of work. MPPWD does not have enough \nlaboratories  or  a  well-defined  system  for  testing  and  quality  control  in  the  divisions  to  enable \nrigorous  testing.  The  state  has  one  laboratory  for  testing  and  quality  control  for  road  works; \nevery  zone  has  a  regional  moratory.  However,  given  the  large  area  of  the  state  and  the \n\n(i) \n\n                                                 \n1   A crore is equal to Rs10,000,000. \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nextensive road network, adequate arrangements for quality control and testing of road material \nare needed. \n \n15.  Works  Management.  The  works  management  system  is  in  need  of  overhaul. \nAdherence  to  old  codes  and  procedures  sometimes  result  in  project  implementation  delays. \nDecision  making  is  not  sufficiently  decentralized.  Operation  decisions  are  delayed  because  of \ntoo many levels of interventions, and the tendency to adhere to established management and \nconstruction practices; staff are not motivated to accept new challenges. \n \nHuman  Resources  Development  and  Management.  No  regular  arrangement  seems \n16. \nto be in place to provide training and reorientation to officers of the department. The state does \nnot  have  a  single  research  or  training  institute  dedicated  to  the  roads  sector.  Cadre \nmanagement has not received due attention in PWD. Promotion prospects are poor and many \nprofessional  staff  remain  at  lower  levels  for  long  periods.  Discussions  with  MPPWD  officers \nindicate that many junior engineers remain at the same level for up to 20 years, as do assistant \nengineers.  Because  of \nin  GOMP  administration, \nfinancial  stringency  and  overstaffing \nrecruitment  of  new  staff  into  government  employment  has  been  restricted  to  certain  reserved \ncategories.  During  the  last  10  years,  virtually  no  assistant  engineers  have  been  recruited. \nImproved capability of engineering staff and reform of the human resources management policy \nare  needed.  The  MPPWD  engineers  are  competent  but  they  are  demoralized.  Good  results \ncannot  be  expected  without  increased  training,  capacity  building,  more  effective  cadre \nmanagement,  and  career  development  strategies.  Avenues  for  staff  promotion  have  to  be \nensured, particularly for lower level functionaries. \n \n \n \n17.  MPRDC  was  established  in  line  with  a  comprehensive  reform  under  the  Madhya \nPradesh State Roads Sector Development Program.2 MPRDC was incorporated as a company \nunder  the  Indian  Companies  Act,  1956,  primarily  to  take  over  the  functions  of  the  Madhya \nPradesh Rajya Setu Nirman Nigam Limited and to promote public-private partnership projects in \nthe Madhya Pradesh road sector. It was declared  and notified as the highway authority under \nsection  4  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Highway  Act,  2004.  MPRDC  has  started  functioning  as  the \nstate highway authority as was envisaged in the reform program. \n \n18.  MPRDC is a lean organization: using consultants for project preparation and supervision \nduring delivery, adopting modern procurement systems guided by FIDIC conditions, and setting \nup computerized road asset management and financial management systems.3 Its capacity was \nstrengthened  with  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nMPRDC  is  headed  by  a  managing  director,  supported  by  a  chief  engineer  and  two  deputy \ngeneral  managers  (DGMs)  for  human  resources  and  management  information  systems,  and \nfinance and accounting. The chief engineer is supported by two general managers for planning \nand maintenance, and projects; and one DGM for BOT. The general manager for planning and \nmaintenance  has  two  sections:  (i)  planning  and  maintenance,  and  (ii)  road  safety,  which \nincludes  the  environment  and  social  management  unit.  The  general  manager  for  projects  has \nfour  sections:  (i)  highway  engineering,  (ii)  quality  control,  (iii)  procurement,  and  (iv)  bridge \n\nMPRDC \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n2   Asian  Development  Bank.  2002.

MPRDC  adopted  a  computerized  financial \nmanagement  system  under  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Roads  Sector  Development  Program.  The  system  has \nbeen commissioned and MPRDC officials are operating it. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\nRoad Transport Regulation and Industry \n\nengineering.  Each  section  is  headed  by  a  DGM  supported  by  an  assistant  general  manager. \nMPRDC  has  seven  division  offices,  which  are  in  charge  of  day-to-day  project  and  contract \nmanagement  for  each  project.  Each  division  office  is  headed  by  a  DGM  supported  by  five \nassistant general managers, 12 managers, and support staff. \n \n19.  MPRDC  adopts  a  modern  management  structure  including  computerized  systems  of \nroad asset management and financial management. It has been equipped with capacity to use \nmodern systems. However, concerns about long-term knowledge and know-how accumulation \nin the organization are related to the large number of staff deputed from MPPWD. Also, weak \nskills  in  project  and  contract  management  are  apparent  at  the  division offices.  GOMP  initiates \nsupport  to  increase  the  number  of  MPRDC  regular  staff,  and  MPRDC  provides  training \nopportunities for the staff to develop skills in various areas. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nThe Madhya Pradesh Transport Department is responsible for (i) licensing, registration, \nand  regulation  of  motor  vehicles,  drivers,  and  passenger  and  freight  transport;  and  (ii)  road \nsafety policy and enforcement of axle-load regulations. It has a system of 39 weigh stations at \nentry points into the state, and mobile squads to carry out its responsibilities. The department is \nheaded by a principal secretary and its functions are designed in accordance with the provisions \nof  the  Motor  Vehicles  Act,  1988.  The  principal  legislation  and  regulations  affecting  the \nfunctioning  of  the  department  are  Motor  Vehicles  Act,  1988;  Central  Motor  Vehicles  Rules, \n1989;  Madhya  Pradesh  Motor  Vehicles  Tax  Act,  1991;  Madhya  Pradesh  Motor  Vehicles  Tax \nRules,  1991;  and  Madhya  Pradesh  Motor  Vehicle  Rules,  1994.  Principal  functions  of  the \ndepartment  are  revenue  collection;  registration  of  vehicles;  issuance  of  permits;  inspection  of \nvehicles  and  enforcement  of  penalties  under  various  central  and  state  laws  and  regulations; \nmonitoring, \ntransport \narrangements;  prevention  of  vehicular  pollution  and  enforcement  related  regulations;  and \nmaintenance  of  statistical  data  for  the  use  of  central  and  state  governments  and  transport \norganizations. Traffic police are responsible for enforcing traffic and road safety regulations. The \ntraffic police are under the Home Department. \n \nTo modernize its functioning, Madhya Pradesh Transport Department has recently taken \n21. \nseveral  initiatives.  Among  the  initiatives  to  control  and  check  overloading  of  goods  carrying \nvehicles, the department is installing electronic weigh bridges at all major border crossings with \nother  states.  This  helps  the  state  identify  vehicles  violating  the  gross  vehicle  weight  and  axle-\nload  regulations  besides  earning  substantial  revenues  from  fines  and  penalties.  MPDRC  will \ndevelop some of the integrated border check posts on a BOT basis. \n \n22. \nThe  state-owned  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Road  Transport  Corporation,  which  was \nrunning about 3% of the state\u2019s buses, is being closed down in a phased manner. A number of \ngovernment-operated routes have now been released for private sector operation, and once the \ncorporation is closed, all routes will be released to the private sector. Route permits are given \nfor private operators. GOMP sets fares, which are generally followed. Truck hire rates are fixed \nby market demand. Competition is good. Private sector operators provide most of the services \nfor passenger and freight transport. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nBudgetary expenditure for state roads in 2004/05 was Rs673 crore ($150 million) against \nan original budget of Rs886 crore ($197 million). The extent of underspending was equivalent to \n\nimplementation,  and  coordination  of \n\nRoad Expenditures and Revenues \n\ninterstate  and \n\ninterregional \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n24%  of  the  original  budget.  The  2005/06  budget  was  29%  greater  than  the  previous  year  at \nRs1,080  crore  ($240  million).  The  2006/07  budget  has  increased  to  Rs1,598  crore  ($355 \nmillion). However, an increasing proportion of road sector spending is taking place outside the \nbudget,  especially  on  Bond 4/BOT  roads.  Reconstruction  of  more  than  900  km  of  roads  is \nplanned  under  the  Bond/BOT  scheme  by  2007/08  at  a  total  cost  of  about  Rs950  crore  ($211 \nmillion).  This  will  bring  the  total  length  of  bond/BOT  roads  throughout  the  state  to  2,000  km. \nTable A2.4 summarizes the plan and nonplan budget allocation in recent years. \n \n\nTable A2.4: MPPWD Budget Allocation and Expenditure (Rs crore) \n2003/04 \n  \n\n2002/03 \n  \n\n2005/06 \n  \n\n2006/07a \n  \n\n2004/05 \n\n  \n\n  Wages/Salary \n  Renewal/Blacktop \n  Maintenance \n   Other \n\n Item  \nA.

The average annual increase is 9.4% with a substantial increase \nin the last 2 years by 15% due to a smart-card system for vehicle registration and tax payment. \nIn  addition,  road  users  pay  fees  at  border  posts  and  to  flying  squads  for  overloading  control; \ncommercial sales taxes such as vehicles, fuel, tires, and spare parts; central road fund share; \nand  tolls  to  MPPWD  and  BOT  concessionaires.  Road  users  paid  approximately  Rs340  crore \n($76 million) in 2005/06 to the GOMP and the Bond/BOT concessionaires. \n \nE. \n \n25. \nThe  road  network  of  the  state  is  very  poor  in  terms  of  coverage  and  conditions,  and \ndemands  for  road  transport  are  increasing.  Insufficient  funding  to  road  maintenance  has \nincreased the backlog of deferred maintenance. GOMP is working to reduce the backlog as set \nout  in  Refurbishing  Roads  in  Madhya  Pradesh,  May  2005.  This  is  a  state  road  rehabilitation \nprogram  to  immediately  strengthen  and  upgrade  the  state  road  network  by  2009/10.  The \nprogram  (Table  A2.5)  intends  to  improve  some  22,000  km  of  state  roads  though  various \nschemes, including the central road fund, Bond/BOT schemes, and ADB assistance. \n\nMain Sector Issues and Government Initiatives \n\n                                                 \n4  Bonds roads are those financed under the Madhya Pradesh Infrastructure Investment Fund Scheme. \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nTable A2.5 State Roads Rehabilitation Program \n\nRs crore \n\nMajor District \nRoad \n\nState Highway \nKm \n1,520 \n1,385 \n580 \n \n3,485 \n\n \nItem \n2006/07 \n2007/08 \n2008/09 \n2009/10 \nTotal \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Government of Madhya Pradesh. 2005.

MPRDC  has  adopted  best  practices  for  planning  and  maintenance  systems, \nfinancial  management,  and  procurement.  MPRDC  is  now  regarded  as  a  benchmark  of  good \npractice  in  managing  the  state  highway  network.  GOMP  highly  appreciates  the  contributions \nmade  by  the  TA  provided  in  parallel  with  the  loan,  especially  in  terms  of  establishing  MPRDC \nand developing its capacity. MPPWD intends to adopt technologies and practices of MPRDC in \nthe context of MPPWD. \n \n28. \nGOMP recently provided policy recommendations to improve MPPWD operations, which \ninclude  development  of  an  appropriate  road  development  plan,  improvement  of  MPPWD\u2019s \nbusiness procedures and practices, and human resources management. A major step taken by \nGOMP  is  to  abolish  the  letter-of-credit  system  to  streamline  administrative  procedures  for \ntransparent, effective, and efficient use of the allocated budget. MPPWD is also enhancing its \nplanning  capacity  to  prioritize  roads  for  improvement  on  an  economic  basis  and  to  prepare  a \ncondition-based budget for maintenance. Such initiatives include establishing the Planning Unit, \ntraining in project management skills, and pilot implementation of road management systems in \nselected districts. \n \n\n2. \n\nRoad Maintenance Financing and Operations \n\n \n29. \nThe nonplan budget has been substantially increased from Rs136 crore to Rs423 crore \nin the past 5 years (from 2002/03 to 2006/07). The maintenance requirement, estimated by the \nPlanning Commission, is Rs500 crore per annum. The budget allocation since the current fiscal \nyear  2006/07  substantially  covers  requirements  especially  due  to  the  provision  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  grant-in-aide  (about  Rs147  crore  annually)  under  12th  Finance  Commission. \nAfter the GOMP\u2019s road improvement program, the budget requirement for maintenance will be \nincreased  and  is  estimated  at  Rs650  crore  annually  between  2009/10  and  2014/15.  Revenue \nrelating  to  road  use  is  estimated  at  Rs557  crore  in  2005/06,  increasing  by  15%  from  the \nprevious year, which is absorbed in the general government revenue. GOMP also established \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nan  earmarked  reserve,  the  Kisan  Road  Fund,  which  is  exclusively  used  for  development  and \nmaintenance  of  state  roads.  About  Rs100  crore\u2013Rs120  crore  has  been  collected  every  year \nfrom a major portion (85%) of one half of market cess levied on agriculture produce since 2001. \n \nOf  concern  is  the  efficient  and  effective  utilization  of  the  budget.  Due  to  the  strong \n30. \nGOMP  initiative  on  effective  use  of  gang  labor,  the  increase  to  maintenance  excluding  salary \nand wages is much higher, from Rs56 crore in 2002/03 to Rs296 crore in 2006/07. The share of \nthe salary/wage element in the nonplan budget has been reduced from 70% in 2003/04 to 40% \nin  2006/07  as  of  October  2006  (Table  A2.4).  These  demonstrate  GOMP\u2019s  increased \ncommitment  to  maintenance  and  increased  efficiency  of  road  maintenance  works.  GOMP  is \nexpected  to  further  improve  efficiency,  e.g.,  further  30%  reduction  of  the  current  wage/salary \nelement of maintenance works by the end of the Project. Increased construction quality due to \ninclusion  of  3\u20135-year  performance  guarantees  into  civil  works  contracts  will  increase  the \nefficiency of maintenance works and hence reduce maintenance costs. \n \n\n3. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n \n31. \nGOMP  took  on  major  initiatives  to  facilitate  road  development  through  public-private \npartnerships  such  as  enactment  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Highway  Act,  2004,  and  Indian  Tolls \n(Madhya Pradesh Amendment) Act, 1992. The 1992 amendment of the Indian Tolls Act and the \nIndian  Tolls  (Madhya  Pradesh  Amendment)  Act,  1992,  together  empower  GOMP  to  enter  into \ncontracts  for  development  of  public  roads  and  bridges  with  private  entities,  appoint  them  as \nlessees  for  collection  of  tolls  on  contracted  roads  or  bridges,  and  give  them  protection  in  the \nmatter of toll collection as if they were employed by GOMP. Currently, MPRDC manages 1,540 \nkm of roads under the BOT scheme. An additional 640 km are proposed to be developed under \nthe BOT scheme in 2006/07. Maintenance of state highways is now 100% contracted out to the \nprivate  sector.  A  maintenance,  operate,  and  transfer  scheme  has  been  introduced  and  will be \napplied  to  all  ADB-funded  projects.  MPRDC  will  explore  more  opportunities  for  BOT  and \nmaintenance, operate, and transfer schemes for high-density state roads. \n \n32.  MPPWD contracts all road improvements and part of periodic maintenance to the private \nsector.  It  will  increase  the  contracting  out  of  maintenance  works  by  incorporating  3\u20135-year \nmaintenance  works  into  civil  works  contracts.  This  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  reduction  of \ngang labor to keep roads in a maintainable condition. \n \n\n4. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n \n33. \nThe  road  accident  rate  in  Madhya  Pradesh  was  12.4  fatalities  per  10,000  vehicles  in \n2004, decreasing from 13.2 in 2001. The rate has now improved to the national average (12.8 in \n2003). However, it is still much higher than rates in Australia, Europe, Japan, and United States. \nAbout  30%  of  fatal  accidents  are  head-on  collisions.  Most  accidents  are  the  fault  of  drivers, \nfollowed by defects in the mechanical condition of motor vehicles.  \n \n34. \nThe  state  Road  Safety  Council  was  reconstituted  in  2006,  chaired  by  a  chief  minister \nand  represented  by  all  government  agencies,  road  user  groups,  and  transport  experts \nconcerned.  Committees  have  been  established  to  coordinate  various  efforts  to  improve  road \nsafety. District road safety committees under the leadership of a district collector meet 2\u20134 times \na  year  to  review  road  safety-related  aspects,  especially  a  road  safety  program  comprising  20 \nissues  such  as  implementation  of  advance  warning  measures  to  prevent  accidents  during  the \nheavy rainy season, reflective markers on the side of trucks, and use of helmet and seatbelts. \nOther initiatives taken by GOMP include road safety education, which is included in the school \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\ncurriculum,  establishment  of  trauma  care  centers,  and  provision  of  an  accident  assistance \nnumber.  The  traffic  police  are  responsible  for  accident  data  collection  and  analysis.  The \nrelatively high share of accidents due to mechanical defects is a concern. \n \nA  road  safety  cell  has  been  formulated  in  MPRDC.  MPRDC  has  modified  the  accident \n35. \ninvestigation and prevention manual prepared for the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and \nHighways under ADB TA5 to reflect local experiences and to adapt it to the road network under \nGOMP.  The  accident  investigation  and  prevention  manual  was  prepared  in  1996  to  guide \nhighway authorities and engineers in reducing road accidents and fatalities in India. Based on \nthis, MPRDC conducts a road safety audit to ensure safety features are incorporated in designs. \nMPRDC  conducted  road  safety  audits  for  the  proposed  Project  and  the  previous  ADB  project \n(footnote 2).  \n \n36. \nIn  1996,  the  Government  recommended  establishing  the  Directorate  of  Safety  and \nTraffic  Management  and  setting  up  a  road  safety  fund,  earmarking  1%  of  cess  revenue  for \nnational  highways.  An  expert  committee  at  the  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Road  Transport,  and \nHighways will review these recommendations and finalize a road safety policy to address legal, \ninstitutional, and financial issues for road safety. This will provide a new context for state funding \nand institutional setup for road safety. \n \n\n5. \n\nControl of Overloading \n\n \n37. \nThe legal framework is in place to control overloading of vehicles. The weakness is the \nlack of inspection, surveillance, and enforcement system to enforce it. GOMP has drawn up a \nphased statewide program to strengthen and improve infrastructure at state border check posts \nto  strengthen  overloading  control.  GOMP  is  undertaking  a  rigorous  inspection  at  the  border \ncheck-post  locations.  It  has  allocated  funds  for  10  electronic  weigh  bridges  and  surveillance \nmechanisms,  which  MPRDC  installed  at  the  state  borders  and  key  locations  on  the  road \nnetwork under the previous loan (footnote 2). Private investors are being invited to install weigh \nbridges at another 26 locations. GOMP will provide state support to their operation. As an added \nprecaution against enforcement officers\u2019 laxity and corruption, closed-circuit television cameras \nare  being  installed  and  connected  by  satellite  to  the  nearest  road  transport  offices,  allowing \nremote monitoring of weighing operations. Collection of the composition fee has increased as a \nresult  of  these  efforts:  in  2004/05,  it  was  27%  higher  than  in  2003/04,  and  in  2005/06,  60% \nhigher than in 2004/05. GOMP recently increased the composition fee by more than 100%, thus \nsensitizing truck operators and discouraging them from plying overloaded trucks. In November \n2005, the Supreme Court of India passed a judgment banning overloading of trucks to prevent \npremature damage to roads, and mandated that excess cargo be offloaded at the risk and cost \nof  the  vehicle  owner  before  the  truck  would  be  permitted  to  continue  its  journey,  even  after \npayment of penalty. GOMP\u2019s efforts are expected to eventually reduce vehicle overloading. \n \n38. \ndevelopment action plan (Appendix 3). \n \n \n\nKey  sector  development  initiatives  undertaken  are  summarized  in  the  institutional \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB.  2002.

If ADB finds that a proposed \nsubproject  is  not  likely  to  satisfy  the  eligibility  criteria  and/or  that  the  agreed \nprocedures, ADB will advise MPRDC either (a) to modify the subproject proposal \nin a manner that will make it eligible for approval; or (b) that the subproject must \nbe  rejected.  If  a  subproject  is  rejected,  MPRDC  may  propose  a  replacement \nsubproject.  If  the  ADB  finds  that  the  proposed  subproject  is  likely  to  satisfy  the \neligibility  criteria  and  procedures,  ADB  will  advise  whether,  based  on  the \nresettlement  checklist  a  short  resettlement  plan  is  required,  and  based  on  the \nindigenous  people  checklist,  whether  an \ninitial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) is required for all subprojects.  \n\nrequired.

Poverty Analysis  \nThe  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  rehabilitate  the  existing  state  roads  in  Madhya  Pradesh  and  augment  existing \nconnectivity within the state. The Project will cover an estimated of 1,969.36 kilometers (km) of state roads hence creating a \nreliable  and  efficient  road  network  within  the  state.  Some  of  the  immediate  benefits  will  be  in  terms  of  improved  access  to \nsocioeconomic  facilities,  safe  and  comfortable  travel  with  reduced  fuel  consumption  and  vehicle  operating  costs,  and \ndevelopment of the rural economy. \n \nA  socioeconomic  baseline  survey  was  undertaken  on  a  sample  subproject  in  Nov\u2013Dec  2006,  based  on  a  representative \nsample covering a total of 619 households. The social assessment and analysis of the secondary data reveal that agriculture \nis the mainstay of people in the area, with the majority deriving their livelihoods from agriculture and labor (both agricultural \nand  nonagricultural).  Some  of  the  major  crops  grown  in  the  area  are  wheat,  soybeans,  pulses,  and  maize.  In  some \nsubproject sections, mainly town portions and market places, some of the population is also dependent upon small trade and \nbusiness for fulfillment of their livelihood needs. Seasonal migration to neighboring districts and states for employment is a \ncommon  feature  of  the  area  with  a  number  of  sample  households  (21%  of  the  surveyed  households)  in  the  subproject \nvillages migrating for 2\u20133 months to work on construction sites and other nonagricultural wage labor opportunities.  \n \nPoverty in the state is estimated at 37.06%, significantly higher than India\u2019s average of 27.09%, with an estimated annual per \ncapita  income  of  those  living  below  the  poverty  line  at  Rs3889.32  (less  than  $90).  The  Project  is  expected  to  stimulate \neconomic  growth  and  human  development  in  the  state.  The  survey  findings  indicate  that  86.43%  of  the  respondents \nconfirmed the need for the Project and perceive a positive linkage between poverty reduction and road improvement. \n \nThe households covered during the socioeconomic survey consider the  perceived socioeconomic benefits of the Project in \nterms of improved access to socioeconomic services, increased employment opportunities, and improved means of transport \nservices  as  the  major  positive  impact  of  the  project  construction  that  would  in  turn  reduce  poverty  in  the  region.  The \nhouseholds  engaged  in  wage  labor  regard  improved  mobility  as  an  opportunity  that  would  provide  them  better  paying  jobs \noutside  their  villages.  The  communities  also  felt  that  the  Project,  by  improving  transport  services,  would  possibly  result  in \ncheaper services, thereby benefiting those working outside the villages.   \n \n\n \n\n \n\nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nConsultations and meetings with the various project communities were organized during the social survey to ascertain their \nresponse to road construction, the communities\u2019 needs and demands, an estimate of the communities\u2019 losses, and steps to \nmitigate them.  \n \nIn the case of the sample subproject, a number of focus group discussions  were organized during the course of the social \n\n  Yes \n\n  Yes \n\n  No \n\n  No \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\n \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nappraisal.  These  discussions  were  held  with  men,  women,  farmers,  indigenous  people,  scheduled  castes,  high  income \ngroups, poor, shopkeepers, truckers, etc. to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the Project as well as its impacts. Other \nkey  stakeholders  such  as  panchayati  raj  members  such  as  village  sarpanch,  village  health  workers,  block  development \nofficers,  aanganwadi  workers,  auxiliary  nurse  midwives,  and  school  teachers  were  consulted  by  means  of  key  stakeholder \ndiscussions. These discussions and consultations undertaken confirmed the need for the Project with a positive response of \nthe  community  and  different  stakeholders  toward  the  Project  among  all  socioeconomic  groups.  The  key  benefits  of  the \nProject as voiced by the stakeholders will be in terms of augmented access to socioeconomic services.   \n \nMadhya Pradesh Road Development Corporation (MPRDC) will ensure that for additional subprojects, essential participation \nfocuses will be adhered to with the related stakeholders to enhance economic development and growth of the communities. \nThe perceptions and priorities of the stakeholders will be considered while finalizing project design and mitigation measures \nto address risks, if any.  \n\n \n\n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGender participation was ensured during the course of the social study by undertaking gender analysis to assess the impact \nof the Project. Focus group discussions were undertaken with women belonging to different socioeconomic groups such as \nhigh income group, poor, scheduled tribe women, and women belonging to scheduled castes, and other backward classes. \nThese discussions brought forth that the Project will provide benefits for both men and women and special benefits to women \nby increasing the opportunity among girls to access higher education, and access for women and children to improved local \nservices and higher levels of health care outside the village. Focus group discussions with the women of various castes and \ncommunities revealed that women of all castes want the construction of roads. \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n Yes \n\n No  \n\nE.
