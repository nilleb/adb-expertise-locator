I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed debt \ninvestment in bonds of up to $50,000,000 to be issued by Georgian Railway JSC (joint stock \ncompany) for the Georgian Railway Green Bond Project in Georgia. \n \n2.  Georgian Railway will issue $500 million of 5\u20137-year Eurobonds, which will be listed on \nthe London Stock Exchange. The proceeds of the issuance, combined with Georgian Railway\u2019s \nown resources, will be used to roll over Georgian Railway\u2019s existing $500 million in Eurobonds, \nand partly finance capital expenditures in relation to the company\u2019s ongoing railway modernization \nproject. The proceeds of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) subscription will be earmarked up \nto (i) $4 million for capital expenditures related to the upgrade of two existing substations; and (ii) \n$46 million for the partial refinancing of debts (existing Eurobonds) incurred to improve existing \nrailway lines as part of the ongoing modernization project, covering preliminary works, subgrade \nworks, the upgrade of associated infrastructure and electric traction supply lines, and railway track \nenhancements.  The  proceeds  will  not  finance  any  tunnel-related  works  and  any  capital \nexpenditures, upgrades, or repairs linked to new railway lines. The instrument is targeted to be \nissued in June 2021. The bonds are expected to be recognized as green bonds in compliance \nwith the International Capital Markets Association\u2019s Green Bond Principles.1 The instrument is \nexpected to be the first-ever green bond to be issued by a state-owned enterprise in the South \nCaucasus, and the second from a Georgian issuer. ADB\u2019s subscription to the bond as an anchor \ninvestor is expected to boost investor confidence in the issuance, particularly given market \nuncertainties  because  of  the  ongoing  pandemic,  and  thereby  help  ensure  financial  and \noperational sustainability of Georgian Railway. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Georgia lies at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, serving as an \nimportant section of international trade and transport corridors, such as the Transport Corridor \nEurope Caucasus Asia corridor, as well as the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC) Railway Corridor 2: Mediterranean\u2013East Asia and CAREC Railway Corridor 6: Europe\u2013\nMiddle East\u2013South Asia.2 Establishing sustainable and efficient transport networks that improve \nconnectivity with neighboring trading partners can lead to increased trade flows and improved \ncompetitiveness. In line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023,3 Georgia can \nleverage such advantages to strengthen its position as an international gateway by upgrading its \ntransport network in a sustainable manner. \n \n4.  Project design. Georgian Railway\u2019s main objective for the proposed bond issuance is to \nrestructure its liability profile by rolling over its $500 million in Eurobonds that had been issued \nprimarily to fund the company\u2019s ongoing modernization project. Since 2010, Georgian Railway \nhas been working on a multiyear, phased modernization of its network. The project includes \nimproving the bottleneck in a 40-kilometer mountainous region, which delays operations and \naccelerates the depreciation of tracks and rolling stock. (Confidential information deleted.) Once \nthe modernization project, involving the entire rail network, is completed in 2023, it is expected to \n \n1  International Capital Market Association. 2018. Green Bond Principles.

Country Partnership Strategy: Georgia, 2019\u20132023\u2014Developing Caucasus\u2019s Gateway to the World. \nManila. \n ", "2 \nincrease freight capacity from 27 million to 48 million tons per annum, increase passenger \ncapacity from 4.5 million to 8.0 million per annum, increase the maximum cargo speed, reduce \nthe transport time of freight trains, and improve transport safety by reducing derailment risk. Once \nthe ongoing capital expenditure is completed, improved and expanded railway operations may \nhelp reduce carbon emissions through cargo and passenger modal shifts from more greenhouse \ngas-intensive road-based transport to rail. Notwithstanding the above, the project will not be \neligible for climate financing. This is because it is not possible to meaningfully quantify the \nincremental greenhouse gas emission reduction accruing out of the modernization project, due to \nthe absence of a comprehensive traffic survey and demand analysis study on the likely extent of \nmodal shift in the project area.4 However, the bond issuance will be in compliance with the Green \nBond Principles (footnote 1).5 \n \n5.  To fund the modernization project in phases, Georgian Railway initially issued $250 million \nin Eurobonds in 2010, which were subsequently refinanced in 2012 by a $500 million Eurobond \nissuance with a bullet repayment in 2022. The proposed bond issuance would be primarily used \nto roll over these existing Eurobonds and thus help reprofile Georgian Railway\u2019s balance sheet \nby ensuring much-needed liquidity, which is critical for Georgian Railway\u2019s sustainability and \ncompletion  of  its  modernization  project.  Given  the  capital-intensive  nature  of  the  ongoing \ninvestment (with long payback period), Georgian Railway\u2019s current operating cash flow is not \nsufficient to cover such bullet repayment while at the same time maintaining the momentum of \nongoing capital expenditures. The role of ADB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment as anchor investors to support the issuance of the green bonds will thus enable \nGeorgian Railway to repay its upcoming liabilities, and to maintain the momentum of modernizing \nthe entire railway network, which is vital to the country. \n \n6.  Of Georgian Railway\u2019s total cargo throughput in 2020, transit accounted for 50%, exports \nfor 10%, and imports for 23%. Local shipments accounted for only 17%. Because Georgian \nRailway\u2019s mainline railway network is a key link in the shortest route from the Caspian Sea and \nCentral Asia to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean basin, it is uniquely positioned to capitalize \non trade between Europe, the Caspian Sea region, and Central Asia. Therefore, Georgian \nRailway\u2019s modernization project is critical for Georgia to serve as a gateway for trade with Europe \nnot only for other Caucasus countries but also for neighboring economies, which form an integral \npart of key regional cooperation and integration initiatives. \n \n7.  ADB and Georgian Railway will execute an agreement stipulating specific requirements, \nincluding development outcome, safeguards and social dimensions, gender elements, and an \nanticorruption policy. Georgian Railway will commit to undertake a number of improvements in \nsafeguards and gender design to comply with ADB\u2019s requirements. These actions are expected \nto have a demonstrational effect across the transport sector in Georgia and significantly add value \nto one of Georgia\u2019s largest employers, with more than 12,000 employees as of the end of 2020. \nThe project will support Georgian Railway\u2019s efforts to access international capital markets at a \ntime when liquidity is uncertain because of the negative economic effects of the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic.  \n \n4  Under the joint Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) methodology for tracking climate change mitigation finance \ntypology, railways are an eligible mitigation activity; however, the methodology also requires a clear demonstration \nof a modal shift from a higher-carbon mode, as well as the consequent estimations for greenhouse gas emission \nreductions.  \n5  Green bonds projects (following the Green Bonds Principles) do not necessarily qualify as climate finance projects \n(following the joint MDB methodology), as the latter have more stringent eligibility criteria.  \n \n ", "3 \n8.  One-ADB approach. The project has been developed and processed by ADB\u2019s Private \nSector Operations Department \u2013 in close collaboration with Central and West Asia Department \n(CWRD). The project opportunity was identified during CWRD\u2019s technical assistance (TA)6 \nsupport to Georgian Railway and the Government of Georgia to formulate a long-term business \nstrategy for rail passenger services, optimize passenger operations, and finalize a fair and \ntransparent  public  service  contract  between  Georgian  Railway  and  the  government.  Once \ncompleted, the TA is expected to identify a road map for Georgian Railway to reduce its financial \nburden stemming from loss-making, yet socioeconomically desirable, passenger rail services and \nimprove  its  sustainability.  The  support  for  the  bond  issuance  thus  complements  CWRD\u2019s \nupstream engagement with Georgian Railway. ADB\u2019s Georgia Resident Mission is involved in \nprocessing the project and engaged in managing ADB\u2019s relationship with Georgian Railway. \n \n9.  Gender equality. Few women are employed in transport (2% in construction and 4% in \ntransport and communication) in Georgia.7 Transport usage, trip patterns, and mobility often have \nsignificant gender constraints. Even when women have access to public transport, it is often \nconsidered unsafe as sexual harassment on public transport has been reported as a growing \nproblem  in  many  countries  in  CAREC.8 Key  gender  issues  considered  in  designing  and \nimplementing the ongoing modernization project include access, safety, and provision of equal \njob opportunities in transport. Gender elements have been incorporated into the project to align \nwith ADB requirements. \n \n10.  Issuer. Georgian Railway is Georgia\u2019s sole railway company operating in Georgia and is \nwholly owned by the Partnership Fund JSC, Georgia\u2019s sovereign investment fund. Georgian \nRailway  provides  freight  services,  transshipping  a  variety  of  cargo,  including  crude  oil,  oil \nproducts, ores, and grains, principally from the Caspian Sea and Central Asia in the east to the \nBlack Sea in the west. Georgian Railway also provides passenger services. Its total infrastructure \nincluded a 1,436-kilometer railway network (of which 97% is electrified), 1,323 bridges, 40 tunnels, \n31 passenger stations, and 99 cargo stations as of the end of 2020. Georgian Railway is a \nvertically  integrated  natural  monopoly  that  owns  and  operates  the  tracks,  stations,  other \ninfrastructure and rolling stock comprising Georgia\u2019s entire national railway system, as well as the \nland adjoining the tracks. Georgian Railway is authorized to set its own tariffs independently of \ngovernment approval. The company\u2019s mainline rail network, together with that of Azerbaijan \nRailways (a closed joint stock company), forms the Caucasus railway corridor, which is a key \nsegment of the Transport Corridor Europe Caucasus Asia corridor, as well as the CAREC Railway \nCorridor 2: Mediterranean\u2013East Asia and CAREC Railway Corridor 6: Europe\u2013Middle East\u2013South \nAsia (footnote 2). Three of Georgian Railway\u2019s lines terminate at the Black Sea, at the Georgian \nport cities of Batumi, Kulevi, and Poti, with easy on-shipment of transit cargo to the Mediterranean \nbasin and Europe.  \n \n11.  COVID-19 impact. In early 2020, the government ordered a temporary suspension of rail \npassenger operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, ridership decreased \nsignificantly. In 2020, Georgian Railway transported only 0.9 million passengers compared with \n3.0 million in 2019. The pandemic slowed the pace of some of Georgian Railway\u2019s modernization \nworks. However, the temporary restrictions placed by the government in 2020 on air and overland \ntransport have positively impacted Georgian Railway\u2019s freight transport volumewhich was 11.1 \nmillion tons in 2020 compared with 10.9 million tons in 2019 \n \n \n6  ADB. 2020.

Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: provision of a safer, more \nefficient  transport  corridor,  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  Georgia \n(footnote 3) to develop efficient and sustainable transport and storage systems, and with ADB\u2019s \nCAREC 2030 transport strategy,9 to improve service levels and operation efficiency of railways. \n \n14.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcomes: Georgian Railway\u2019s financial \nsustainability and railway operations improved through the issuance of Eurobonds, increasing the \nvolume of cargo and passengers transported, reducing travel time for freight trains from the \nAzerbaijan border to the Georgian port of Batumi, and improving train speeds in gorge sections \nof the railway network project. \n \n15.  Outputs. The outputs of the project are (i) Georgian Railway\u2019s Eurobonds fully issued and \nsubscribed,  (ii)  Georgian  Railway\u2019s  network  improved  with  freight  and  passenger  capacity \nincreased and gender responsiveness improved through installation of gender-awareness boards \nat train stations, (iii) gender inclusiveness in Georgian Railway\u2019s workplace enhanced, and (iv) \nopportunities for women in transport improved. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n16.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country partnership strategy. The project is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s Strategy  2030,10 which  prioritizes  addressing  remaining  poverty  and \nreducing inequality, accelerating progress in gender equality, making cities more livable, and \nmeeting  cross-border  infrastructure  needs,  which  is  aligned  with  the operational  priority  of \nfostering regional cooperation and integration. ADB support for the project is in line with ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Georgia,  2019\u20132023  (footnote  3)  as  the  project  promotes \neconomic development and makes urban areas more livable through more efficient transport. \nSupporting the first green bond issuance from a state-owned enterprise in the South Caucasus \nwill boost the financial sustainability of Georgian Railway, which will in turn help to address the \nultimate goal of the country partnership strategy to expand trade, improve regional connectivity \nand logistics, create more jobs, and combat poverty through the development of economic \ncorridors in Georgia, as Georgian Railway is an important part of such corridors. \n \n17.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s CAREC 2030 transport strategy (footnote 9), which targets increasing \nsustainability, and with its strategic pillar on railways, which focuses on developing effective rail \ninfrastructure, and alleviating cross-border bottlenecks via increased freight capacity and railway \nnetwork  length.  The  project  will  thus  benefit  connectivity  in  CAREC  Railway  Corridor  2: \nMediterranean\u2013East Asia and CAREC Railway Corridor 6: Europe\u2013Middle East\u2013South Asia. The \nproject is consistent with the Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations through its support \nfor an essential transport infrastructure provider.11 \n \n \n9  ADB. 2020.

The transaction benefits from lessons from ADB\u2019s \nsuccessful green bond projects across Asia and the Pacific, including Georgia.12 One of the key \nlessons from prior transactions is the importance of identifying credible issuers who are committed \nto strictly adhering to the criteria required for green bond issuances. Georgian Railway is \ncommitted to the sustainability agenda and is seen as an appropriate partner for ADB. This \ntransaction benefits from ADB\u2019s internal knowledge of the commercial structuring of and market \nfor corporate bonds, including green bonds\u2014learnt from prior similar transactions. \n \nD.

The Assistance \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s assistance will comprise an investment of up to $50 million in Eurobonds to be \nissued by Georgian Railway.  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n24.  Financial additionalities. ADB\u2019s support\u2014as an anchor investor\u2014to Georgia\u2019s first-ever \ngreen bond issuance in the railway sector is expected to fill a critical market gap. The issuance \ncomes at a time of significantly uncertain investor confidence in and appetite for Georgian \nRailway\u2019s proposed bonds because of economic and market disruptions caused by COVID-19. \nADB\u2019s participation will improve the commercial viability of the issuer by helping it raise required \nlong-term financing to meet its near-term obligations and extend the tenor of its debt profile\u2014a \ncritical requirement for it to continue its ongoing modernization plans unhindered. More generally, \nADB will add value by helping further develop the hitherto limited green bond market in the South \nCaucasus by ensuring that the bond issuance complies with international market standards. \nADB\u2019s involvement will also help raise the profile and utility of green instruments and standards \nin the region. \n \n25.  Nonfinancial additionalities. ADB will require Georgian Railway to adopt environmental \nand social standards in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Georgian Railway \nwill also be required to strengthen gender design features in its operations to tackle key gender \nequality issues. As one of the largest employers in Georgia, Georgian Railway has the potential \nto not only have a demonstrational impact on other transport industry actors but also serve as a \n \n12 ADB. 2020.

Georgian Railway will improve the safety of female \nworkers and passengers by adopting gender-responsive communication at train stations and by \nintroducing a corporate policy supporting procedures and awareness campaigns against sexual \nharassment and on other gender issues in the transport sector, including the need for a respectful \nwork environment and zero tolerance for gender-based violence. The project is expected to lead \nto  increased  regional  trade  and  connectivity  via  optimized  logistical  chains  and  improved \ntransport. ADB will continue to work with Georgian Railway through the approved TA (provided \nthrough ADB\u2019s sovereign operations) to formulate a long-term business strategy for rail passenger \nservices and design a fair and transparent public service contract, which will contribute to a more \nefficient and sustainable rail transport system. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n26.  (Confidential information deleted.)  \n \n27.  (Confidential information deleted.)  \n \n28.  (Confidential information deleted.)  \n \n29.  (Confidential information deleted.)  \n \n30.  (Confidential information deleted.)  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n31.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category B), and \nindigenous peoples (category C).13 Safeguard Policy Requirement 4 for general corporate finance \nand existing facilities is applicable. \n \n32.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse \nimpacts. The environmental and social measures and the institutional capacity and commitment \nof  Georgian  Railway  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts  will  be \nstrengthened in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. A corporate audit of \nGeorgian Railway\u2019s environmental and social management system (ESMS) and an environmental \nand social compliance audit of existing facilities and activities to be financed by ADB were \nundertaken by an external third party in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements. \n \n33.  The existing facility audit noted the presence of hazardous materials and waste associated \nwith  the  use  of  oil  containing  polychlorinated  biphenyl,  asbestos,  and  asbestos-containing \nmaterials in existing infrastructure. Georgian Railway will develop a program to phase out the use \nof polychlorinated biphenyl throughout its operations, which will include procedures for handling \nand storing the waste material. The company will develop an asbestos management plan to avoid, \nminimize, and mitigate the potential environmental and health and safety risks associated with \nthe disturbance, removal, or demolition of structures containing asbestos or asbestos-containing \n \n13 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "7 \nmaterials. The audit determined that, while no additional land has or will be acquired for the \nactivities being financed by ADB, there are potential risks associated with activities that may \ncause economic displacement. Georgian Railway will be required to upgrade its ESMS in line with \nADB\u2019s requirements to incorporate involuntary resettlement screening, categorization, and impact \nmitigation, and to report to ADB on overall land acquisition status. Use of ADB proceeds will not \nbe committed to activities likely to generate economic displacement until adequate assessment \nand management planning have been put in place to avoid, minimize, and/or compensate for \nimpacts. No impacts are anticipated on indigenous peoples  or vulnerable ethnic minorities \nbecause of ADB-financed activities. \n \n34.  Georgian Railway engages contract labor in its operations but does not have a formal \nsystem to monitor labor conditions to ensure that they are compliant with local, national, and \nInternational Labour Organization standards. However, Georgian Railway does have internal \noccupational  health  and  safety  policies  and  procedures  that  apply  to  all  workers.  The \nimplementation  of  the  occupational  health  and  safety  policies  and  procedures  requires \nstrengthening to ensure that the system is compliant with relevant standards and that the resulting \nsafety  culture  is  cascaded  to  contractors.  Georgian  Railway  will  develop  a  contractor \nmanagement plan to fill these gaps and will augment its community consultation measures and \ncommunity grievance mechanism in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n35.  Effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. Gender analysis conducted during due diligence indicated that Georgian Railway \nfollows Georgian labor laws, which include principles on equality, as well as railway regulations \non rights and obligations of railway passengers. However, Georgian Railway\u2019s corporate policies \ndo not contain specific gender-sensitive references or provisions to tackle gender issues. In \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998),14 Georgian Railway has \nincorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment in its business \nactivities. Key features of the gender action plan are (i) improving the safety of female workers \nand passengers along the railway lines with gender-responsive communication at train stations, \nand (ii) developing an anti\u2013sexual harassment policy that will be implemented together with an \nawareness campaign for staff and contractors on sexual harassment and other gender issues in \nthe  transport  sector.  Georgian  Railway  will  increase  opportunities  for  young  women  in  its \ninternship program to further attract women into the transport sector and create jobs for women \nthrough the project. Georgian Railway will submit periodic reports to ADB on implementation of \ngender measures. \n \n36.  Georgian Railway will (i) comply with ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure \nthat investments using ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by \nnational laws and regulations, and (iii) strengthen its ESMS to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. The ESMS will \nset out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national labor laws and measures to \ncomply  with the  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy (2001).15 The ESMS will contain requirements, as applicable, for information \ndisclosure and consultation with project-affected people, following ADB requirements. Georgian \nRailway will report regularly to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws and (ii) the measures \ntaken.16 \n \n \n14 ADB. 1998. Policy on Gender and Development. Manila. \n15 ADB. 2003.
